</p>  <h2 align="center">II, 31. Charm against worms.</h2>  
<p>1. With Indra's great mill-stone, that crushes all vermin, do I grind to pieces the worms, as lentils with a mill-stone.<br> 2. I have crushed the visible and the invisible worm, and the kur&ucirc;ru, too, I have crushed. All the algandu and the saluna, the worms, we grind to pieces with our charm.<br> 3. The algandu do I smite with a mighty weapon: those that have been burned, and those that have not been burned, have become devoid of strength. Those that are left and those that are not left do I destroy with my song, so that not one of the worms be left.<br> 4. The worm which is in the entrails, and he that is in the head, likewise the one that is in the ribs: avaskava and vyadhvara, the worms, do we crush with (this) charm.<br> 5. The worms that are within the mountains, forests, plants, cattle, and the waters, those that have settled in our bodies, all that brood of the worms do I smite.</p>
