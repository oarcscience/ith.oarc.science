## VII, 83. Charm against dropsy.

1\. Thy golden chamber, king Varuna, is built in the waters! Thence the
king that maintains the laws shall loosen all shackles!  
2. From every habitation (of thine), O king Varuna, from here do thou
free us! In that we have said, 'ye waters, ye cows;' in that we have
said, 'O Varuna,' from this (sin), O Varuna, free us!  
3. Lift from us, O Varuna, the uppermost fetter, take down the
nethermost, loosen the middlemost! Then shall we, O Âditya, in thy law,
exempt from guilt, live in freedom!  
4. Loosen from us, O Varuna, all fetters, the uppermost, the nethermost,
and those imposed by Varuna! Evil dreams, and misfortune drive away from
us: then may we go to the world of the pious!
