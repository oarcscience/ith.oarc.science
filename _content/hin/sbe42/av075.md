## IV, 10. The pearl and its shell as an amulet bestowing long life and prosperity.

1\. Born of the wind, the atmosphere, the lightning, and the light, may
this pearl shell, born of gold, protect us from straits!  
2. With the shell which was born in the sea, at the head of bright
substances, we slay the Rakshas and conquer the Atrins (devouring
demons).  
3. With the shell (we conquer) disease and poverty; with the shell, too,
the Saânvâs. The shell is our universal remedy; the pearl shall protect
us from straits!  
4. Born in the heavens, born in the sea, brought on from the river
(Sindhu), this shell, born of gold, is our life-prolonging amulet.  
5. The amulet, born from the sea, a sun, born from Vritra (the cloud),
shall on all sides protect us from the missiles of the gods and the
Asuras!  
6. Thou art one of the golden substances, thou art born from Soma (the
moon). Thou art sightly on the chariot, thou art brilliant on the
quiver. \[May it prolong our lives!\]  
7. The bone of the gods turned into pearl; that, animated, dwells in the
waters. That do I fasten upon thee unto life, lustre, strength,
longevity, unto a life lasting a hundred autumns, May the (amulet) of
pearl protect thee!
