## I, 8. Against sorcerers and demons.

1\. May this oblation carry hither the sorcerers, as a river (carries)
foam! The man or the woman who has performed this (sorcery), that person
shall here proclaim himself!  
2. This vaunting (sorcerer) has come hither: receive him with alacrity!
O Brihaspati, put him into subjection; O Agni and Soma, pierce him
through!  
3. Slay the offspring of the sorcerer, O soma-drinking (Indra), and
subject (him)! Make drop out the farther and the nearer eye of the
braggart (demon)!  
4. Wherever, O Agni Gâtavedas, thou perceivest the brood of these hidden
devourers (atrin), do thou, mightily strengthened by our charm, slay
them: slay their (brood), O Agni, piercing them a hundredfold!
