</p>  <h2 align="center">II, 25. Charm with the plant prisniparn&icirc; against the demon of disease, called kanva.</h2>  
<p>1. The goddess Prisniparn&icirc; has prepared prosperity for us, mishap for Nirriti (the goddess of destruction). For she is a fierce devourer of the Kanvas: her, the mighty, have I employed.<br> 2. The Prisniparn&icirc; was first begotten powerful; with her do I lop off the heads of the evil brood, as (the head) of a bird.<br> 3. The blood-sucking demon, and him that tries to rob (our) health, Kanva, the devourer of our offspring, destroy, O Prisniparn&icirc;, and overcome!<br> 4. These Kanvas, the effacers of life, drive into the mountain; go thou burning after them like fire, O goddess Prisniparn&icirc;!<br> 5. Drive far away these Kanvas, the effacers of life! Where the dark regions are, there have I made these flesh-eaters go.</p>
