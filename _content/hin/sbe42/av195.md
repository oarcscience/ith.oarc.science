## VI, 29. Charm against ominous pigeons and owls.

1\. Upon those persons yonder the winged missile shall fall! If the owl
shrieks, futile shall this be, or if the pigeon takes his steps upon the
fire!  
2. To thy two messengers, O Nirriti, who come here, despatched or not
despatched, to our house, to the pigeon and to the owl, this shall be no
place to step upon!  
3. He shall not fly hither to slaughter (our) men; to keep (our) men
sound he shall settle here! Charm .him very far away unto a distant
region, that (people) shall behold you (i.e. him) in Yama's house devoid
of strength, that they shall behold you bereft of power!
