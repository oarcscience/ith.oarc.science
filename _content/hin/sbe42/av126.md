## VI, 77. Charm to cause the return of a truant woman.

1\. The heavens have stood, the earth has stood, all creatures have
stood. The mountains have stood upon their foundation, the horses in the
stable I have caused to stand.  
2. Him that has control of departure, that has control of coming home,
return, and turning in, that shepherd do I also call.  
3. O Gâtavedas (Agni), cause thou to turn ill; a hundred way's hither
shall be thine, a thousand modes of return shall be thine: with these do
thou restore us again!
