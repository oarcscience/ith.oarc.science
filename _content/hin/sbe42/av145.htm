</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 1. Battle-charm for confusing the enemy.</h2>  
<p>1. Agni shall skilfully march against our opponents, burning against their schemes and hostile plans; G&acirc;tavedas shall confuse the army of our opponents and deprive them (of the use) of their hands!<br> 2. Ye Maruts are mighty in such matters: advance ye, crush ye, conquer ye (the enerny)! These Vasus when implored did crush (them). Agni, vily, as their vanauard shall skilfully attack!<br> 3. O Maghavan, the hostile army which contends against us--do ye, O Indra, Vritra's slayer, and Agni, burn against them!<br> 4. Thy thunderbolt, O Indra, who hast been driven forward swiftly by thy two bay steeds, shall advance, crushing the enemies. Slay them that resist, pursue, or flee, deprive their schemes of fulfilment!<br> 5. O Indra, confuse the army of the enemy; with the impact of the fire and the wind scatter them to either side!<br> 6. Indra shall confuse the army, the Miaruts shall slay it with might! Agni shall rob it of its sight; vanquished it shall turn about!</p>
