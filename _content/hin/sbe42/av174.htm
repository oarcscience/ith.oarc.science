</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 13. Charm for conducting a river into a new channel.</h2>  
<p>1. Because of yore, when the (cloud-) serpent was slain (by Indra), ye did rush forth and shout (anadat&acirc;), therefore is your name 'shouters' (nadyah rivers'): that is your designation, ye streams!<br> 2. Because, when sent forth by Varuna, ye then quickly did bubble up; then Indra met (&acirc;pnot) you, as ye went, therefore anon are ye 'meeters' (&acirc;pah waters')!<br> 3. When reluctantly ye flowed, Indra, forsooth, did with might choose (av&icirc;varata) you as his own, ye goddesses! Therefore 'choice' (v&acirc;r 'water') has been given you as your name!<br> 4. One god stood upon you, as ye flowed according to will. Up breathed (ud &acirc;nishuh) they who are known as 'the great' (mah&icirc;h). Therefore 'upbreather' (udakam 'water') are they called!<br> 5. The waters are kindly, the waters in truth were ghee. These waters, truly, do support Agni and Soma. May the readily flowing, strong sap of the honey-dripping (waters) come to me, together with life's breath and lustre!<br> 6. Then do I see them and also do I hear them; their sound, their voice doth come to me. When, ye golden-coloured, I have refreshed myself with you, then I ween, ambrosia (amrita) am I tasting!<br> 7. Here, ye waters, is your heart, here is your calf, ye righteous ones! Come ye, mighty ones, by this way here, by which I am conducting you here!</p>
