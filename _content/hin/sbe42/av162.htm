<p>1. Your minds, your purposes, your plans, do we cause to bend. Ye persons yonder, that are devoted to other purposes, we cause you to comply!<br> 2. With my mind do I seize your minds: do ye with your thoughts follow my thought! I place your hearts in my control: come ye, directing your way after my course!<br> 3. I have called upon heaven and earth, I have called upon the goddess Sarasvat&icirc;, I have called upon both Indra and Agni: may we succeed in this. O Sarasvat&icirc;!</p>
