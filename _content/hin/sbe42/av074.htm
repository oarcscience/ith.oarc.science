</p>  <h2 align="center">IV, 9. Salve (&acirc;&ntilde;gana) as a protector of life and limb.</h2>  
<p>1. Come hither! Thou art the living, protecting eye-ointment of the mountain, given by all the gods as a safeguard, unto life.<br> 2. Thou art a protection for men, a protection for cattle, thou didst stand for the protection of horses and steeds.<br> 3. Thou art, O salve, both a protection that crushes the sorcerers, and thou hast knowledge of immortality (amrita). Moreover, thou art food for the living, and thou art, too, a remedy aorainst jaundice.<br> 4. From him over whose every limb and every joint thou passest, O salve, thou dost, as a mighty intercepter, drive away disease.<br> 5. Him that bears thee, O salve, neither curse, nor sorcery, nor burning pain does reach; nor does the,vishkandha come upon him.<br> 6. From evil scheme, from troubled dream, from evil deed, and also from foulness.; from the evil eye of the enemy, from this protect us, O salve!<br> 7. Knowing this, O salve, I shall speak the truth, avoid falsehood. May I obtain horses and cattle, and thy person, O serving-man!<br> 8. Three are servants of the salve: the takman (fever), the bal&acirc;sa, and the serpent. The highest of the mountains, Trikakud ('Three-peaks') by name, is thy father.<br> 9. Since the salve of Trikakud is born upon the Himavant, it shall demolish all the wizards and all the witches.<br> 10. Whether thou art derived from the (mountain) Trikakud, or art said to come from the (river) Yamun&acirc;, both these names of thine are auspicious: with these, O salve, protect us!</p>
