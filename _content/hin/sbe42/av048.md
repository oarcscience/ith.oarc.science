## IV, 4. Charm to promote virility.

1\. Thee, the plant, which the Gandharva dug up for Varuna, when his
virility had decayed, thee, that causest strength\[1\], we dig up.  
2. Ushas (Aurora), Sûrya, (the sun), and this charm of mine; the bull
Pragâpati (the lord of creatures) shall with his lusty fire arouse
him!  
3. This herb shall make thee so very full of lusty strength, that thou
shalt, when thou art excited, exhale heat as a thing on fire!  
4. The fire of the plants, and the essence of the bulls shall arouse
him! Do thou, O Indra, controller of bodies, place the lusty force of
men into this person!  
5. Thou (O herb) art the first-born sap of the waters and also of the
plants. Moreover thou art the brother of Soma, and the lusty force of
the antelope buck!  
6. Now, O Agni, now, O Savitar, now, O goddess Sarasvatî, now, O
Brahmanaspati, do thou stiffen the pasas as a bow!  
7. I stiffen thy pasas as a bowstring upon the bow. Embrace thou (women)
as the antelope buck the gazelle with ever unfailing (strength)!  
8. The strength of the horse, the mule, the goat and the ram, moreover
the strength of the bull bestow upon him, O controller of bodies
(Indra)!

\[1. The original, more drastically, sepaharshanîm. By a few changes and
omissions in stanzas 3, 6, and 7 the direct simplicity of the original
has been similarly veiled.\]
