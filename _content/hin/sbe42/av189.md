## VI, 114. Expiatory formula for imperfections in the sacrifice.

1\. The god-angering (deed), O ye gods, that we, the (Brahman) gods,
have committed, from that do ye, O Âdityas, release us, by virtue of the
order of the universe!  
2. By virtue of the order of the universe do ye, O reverend Âdityas,
release us here, if, O ye carriers of the sacrifice, though desirous of
accomplishing (the sacrifice), we did not accomplish (it)!--  
3. (If), when sacrificing with the fat (animal), when offering oblations
of ghee with the spoon, when desiring to benefit you, O all ye gods, we
have contrary to desire, not succeeded!
