## VIII, 1. Prayer for exemption from the dangers of death.

1\. To the 'Ender,' to Death be reverence! May thy in-breathing and thy
out-breathing remain here! United here with (life's) spirit this man
shall be, sharing in the sun, in the world of immortality (amrita)!  
2. Bhaga has raised him up, Soma with his rays (has raised) him up, the
Maruts, the gods, (have raised) him up, Indra and Agni (have raised) him
up unto well-being.  
3. Here (shall be) thy (life's) spirit, here thy inbreathing, here thy
life, here thy mind! We rescue thee from the toils of Nirriti
(destruction) by means of our divine utterance.  
4. Rise up hence, O man! Casting off the footshackles of death, do not
sink down! Be not cut off from this world, from the sight of Agni and
the sun!  
5. The wind, Mâtarisvan, shall blow for thee, the waters shall shower
amrita (ambrosia) upon thee, the sun shall shine kindly for thy body!
Death shall pity thee: do not waste away!  
6. Thou shalt ascend and not descend, O man! Life and alertness do I
prepare for thee. Mount, forsooth, this imperishable, pleasant car; then
in old age thou shalt hold converse with thy family!  
7. Thy mind shall not go thither, shall not disappear! Do not become
heedless of the living, do not follow the Fathers! All the gods shall
preserve thee here!  
8. Do not long after the departed, who conduct (men) afar! Ascend from
the darkness, come to the light! We lay hold of thy hands.  
9. The two dogs of Yama, the black and the brindled one, that guard the
road (to heaven), that have been despatched, shall not (go after) thee!
Come hither, do not long to be away; do not tarry here with thy mind
turned to a distance!  
10. Do not follow this path: it is terrible! I speak of that by which
thou hast not hitherto gone. Darkness is this, O man, do not enter it!
Danger is beyond, security here for thee.  
11. May the fires that are within the waters gLiard thee, may (the fire)
which men kindle guard thee, may Gâtavedas Vaisvânara (the fire common
to all men) guard thee! Let not the heavenly (fire) together with the
lightning burn, thee!  
12. Let not the flesh-devouring (fire) menace thee: move afar from the
funeral pyre! Heaven shall guard thee, the earth shall guard thee, the
sun and moon shall guard thee, the atmosphere shall guard thee against
the divine missile!  
13. May the alert and the watchful divinities guard thee, may he that
sleeps not and nods not guard thee, may he that protects and is vigilant
guard thee!  
14. They shall guard thee, they shall protect thee. Reverence be to
them. Hail be to them!  
15. Into converse with the living Vâyu, Indra, Dhâtar, and saving
Savitar shall put thee; breath and strength shall not leave thee! Thy
(life's) spirit do we call back to thee.  
16. Convulsions that draw the jaws together, darkness, shall not come
upon thee, nor (the demon) that tears out the tongue (?)! How shalt thou
then waste away? The Âdityas and Vasus, Indra and Agni shall raise thee
up unto well-being!  
17. The heavens, the earth, Pragâpati, have rescued thee. The plants
with Soma their king have delivered thee from death.  
18. Let this man remain right here, ye gods, let him not depart hence to
yonder world! We rescue him from death with (a charm) of thousandfold
strength.  
19. I have delivered thee from death. The (powers) that furnish strength
shall breathe upon thee. The (mourning women) with dishevelled hair,
they that wail lugubriously, shall not wail over thee!  
20. I have snatched thee (from death), I have obtained thee; thou hast
returned with renewed youth. O thou, that art (now) sound of limb, for
thee sound sight, and sound life have I obtained.  
21. It has shone upon thee, light has arisen, darkness has departed from
thee. We remove from thee death, destruction, and disease.
