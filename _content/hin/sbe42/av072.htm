</p>  <h2 align="center">VIII, 2. Prayer for exemption from the dangers of death.</h2>  
<p>1. Take hold of this (charm) that subjects to immortality (life), may thy life unto old age not be cut off! I bring to thee anew breath and life: not to mist and darkness, do not waste away!<br> 2. Come hither to the light of the living; I rescue thee unto a life of a hundred autumns! Loosing the bands of death and imprecation, I bestow upon thee long life extended very far.<br> 3. From the wind thy breath I have obtained, from the sun thine eye; thy soul I hold fast in thee: be together with thy limbs, speak articulating with thy tongue!<br> 4. With the breath of two-footed and four-footed creatures I blow upon thee, as on Agni when he is born (as on fire when kindled). I have paid reverence, O death, to thine eye, reverence to thy breath.<br> 5. This (man) shall live and shall not die: we rouse this man (to life)! I make for him a remedy: O death, do not slay the man!<br> 6. The plant g&icirc;val&acirc; (quickening'), na-gh&acirc;-rish&acirc; ('forsooth-no-harm'), and g&icirc;vant&icirc; ('living), a victorious, mighty saviour-plant do I invoke, that he may be exempt from injury.<br> 7. Befriend him, do not seize him, let him go, (O death); though he be thy very own, let him abide here with unimpaired strength! O Bhava and Sarva, take pity, grant Protection; misfortune drive away, and life bestow!<br> 8. Befriend him, death, and pity him: may he from here arise! Unharmed, with sound limbs, hearing perfectly, through old age carrying a hundred years, let him get enjoyment by himself (unaided)!<br> 9. The missile of the gods shall pass thee by! I pass thee across the mist (of death); from death I have rescued thee. Removing far the flesh-devouring Agni, a barrier do I set around thee, that thou mayest live.<br> 10. From thy misty road that cannot be withstood, O death, from this path (of thine) we guard this (man), and make our charm a protection for him.<br> 11. In-breathing and out-breathing. do I prepare for thee, death in old age, long life, and prosperity. All the messengers of Yama, that roam about, dispatched by Vivasvant's son, do I drive away.<br> 12. Ar&acirc;ti (grudge), Nirriti (destruction), Gr&acirc;hi (seizure), and the flesh-devouring Pis&acirc;kas (do we drive) away to a distance, and hurl all wicked Rakshas away into darkness as it were.<br> 13. I crave thy life's breath from the immortal, life-possessing Agni G&acirc;tavedas. That thou shalt not take harm, shalt be immortal in (Agni's) company, that do I procure for thee, and that shall be fulfilled for thee!<br> 14. May heaven and earth, the bestowers of happiness, be auspicious and harmless to thee; may the sun-shine, and the wind blow comfort to thy heart; may the heavenly waters, rich in milk, flow upon thee kindly!<br> 15. May the plants be auspicious to thee! I have raised thee from the lower to the upper earth: there may both the &Acirc;dityas, the sun and the moon, . protect thee.<br> 16. Whatever garment for clothing, or whatever girdle thou makest for thyself, agreeable to thy body do we render it; not rough to thy touch shall it be!<br> 17. When thou, the barber, shearest with thy sharp well-whetted razor our hair and beard, do not, while cleansing our face, rob us of our life!<br> 18. Rice and barley shall be auspicious to thee, causing no bal&acirc;sa, inflicting no injury! They two drive away disease, they two release from calamity.<br> 19. Whatever thou eatest or drinkest, the grain of the plough-land or milk, whatever is or is not to be eaten, all that food do I render for thee free from poison.<br> 20. To day and to night both do we commit thee: from the demons that seek to devour, do ye preserve this (man) for me!<br> 21. A hundred years, ten thousand years, two, three, four ages (yuga) do we allot to thee; Indra and Agni, and all the gods without anger shall favour thee!<br> 22. To autumn thee, to winter, spring and summer, do we commit; the rains in which grow the plants shall be pleasant to thee!<br> 23. Death rules over bipeds, death rules over quadrupeds. From that death, the lord of cattle, do I rescue thee: do not fear!<br> 24. Free from harm thou shalt not die; thou shalt not die: do not fear! Verily, they do not die there, they do not go to the nethermost darkness;--<br> 25. Verily, every creature lives there, the cow, the horse, and man, where this charm is performed, as the (protecting) barrier for life.<br> 26. May it preserve thee from sorcery, from thy equals and thy kin! Undying be, immortal, exceedingly vital; thy spirits shall not abandon thy body!<br> 27. From the one and a hundred deaths, from the dangers that are surmountable, from that Agai Vaisv&acirc;nara (the funeral pyre?) may the gods deliver thee!<br> 28. Thou, the remedy called p6tudru, art the body of Agni, the deliverer, slayer of Rakshas, slayer of rivals, moreover thou chasest away disease.</p>
