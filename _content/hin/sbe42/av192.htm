</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 113. Expiation for certain heinous crimes.</h2>  
<p>1. On Trita the gods wiped off this sin, Trita wiped it off on human beings; hence if Gr&acirc;hi (attack of disease) has seized thee, may these gods remove her by means of their charm!<br> 2. Enter into the rays, into smoke, O sin; go into the vapours, and into the fog! Lose thyself on the foam of the river! 'Wipet off, O P&ucirc;shan, the misdeeds upon him that practiseth abortion!<br> 3. Deposited in twelve places is that which has been wiped off Trita, the sins belonging to humanity. Hence if Gr&acirc;hi has seized thee, may these gods remove her by means of their charm!</p>
