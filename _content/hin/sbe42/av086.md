## IV, 19. Mystic power of the apâmârga-plant, against demons and sorcerers.

1\. On the one hand thou deprivest of kin, on the other thou now
procurest kinfolk. Do thou, moreover, cut the offspring of him that
practises spells, as a reed that springs up in the rain!  
2. By a Brâhmana thou hast been blest, by Kanva, the descendant of
Nrishad. Thou goest like a stronor army; where thou hast arrived, O
plant, there there is no fear.  
3. Thou goest at the head of the plants, spreading lustre, as if with a
light. Thou art on the one hand the protector of the weak, on the other
the slayer of the Rakshas.  
4. When of yore, in the beginning, the gods drove out the Asuras with
thee, then, O plant, thou wast begotten as apâmârga ('wiping out').  
5. Thou cuttest to pieces (vibhindatî), and hast a hundred branches;
vibhindant ('cutting to pieces') is thy father's name. Do thou (turn)
against, and cut to pieces (vi bhindhi) him that is hostile towards
us!  
6. Non-being arose from the earth, that goes to heaven, (as) a great
expansion. Thence, verily, that, spreading vapours, shall turn against
the performer (of spells)!  
7. Thou didst grow backward, thou hast fruit which is turned backward.
Ward off from me all curses, ward off very far destructive weapons!  
8. Protect me with a hundredfold, guard me with a thousandfold
(strength)! Indra, the strong, shall put strength into thee, O prince of
plants!
