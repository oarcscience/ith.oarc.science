</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 44. Charm against excessive discharges from the body.</h2>  
<p>1. The heavens have stood still, the earth has stood still, all creatures have stood still. The trees that sleep erect have stood still: may this disease of thine stand still!<br> 2. Of the hundred remedies which thou hast, of the thousand that have been collected, this is the most excellent cure for discharges, the best remover of disease.<br> 3. Thou art the urine of Rudra, the navel of amrita (ambrosia). Thy name, forsooth, is vish&acirc;nak&acirc;, (thou art) arisen from the foundation of the Fathers, a remover of diseases produced by the winds (of the body).</p>
