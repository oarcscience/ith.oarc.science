<p>1. The sorcerer (y&acirc;tudh&acirc;na) that vaunts himsel and the Kim&icirc;din do thou, O Agni, convey hither! For thou, O god, when lauded, becomest the destroyer of the demon.<br> 2. Partake of the ghee, of the sesame-oil, O Agni G&acirc;tavedas, that standest on high, conquerest by thyself! Make the sorcerers howl!<br> 3. The sorcerers and the devouring (atrin) Kim&icirc;din shall howl! Do ye, moreover, O Agni and Indra, receive graciously this our oblation!<br> 4. Agni shall be the first to seize them, Indra with his (strong) arms shall drive them away! Every wizard, as soon as he comes, shall proclaim himself, saying, 'I am he'!<br> 5. We would see thy might, O G&acirc;tavedas; disclose to us the wizards, O thou that beholdest men! May they all, driven forth by thy fire, disclosing themselves, come to this spot!<br> 6. Seize hold, O G&acirc;tavedas: for our good thou wast born! Become our messenger, O Agni, and make the sorcerers howl!<br> 7. Do thou, O Agni, drag hither the sorcerers, bound in shackles; then Indra with his thunderbolt shall cut off their heads!</p>
