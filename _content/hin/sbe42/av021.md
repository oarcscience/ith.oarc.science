## II, 8. Charm against kshetriya, hereditary disease.

1\. Up have risen the majestic twin stars, the vikritau ('the two
looseners'); may they loosen the nethermost and the uppermost fetter of
the kshetriya (inherited disease)!  
2. May this night shine (the kshetriya) away, may she shine away the
witches; may the plant, destructive of kshetriya, shine the kshetriya
away!  
3. With the straw of thy brown barley, endowed with white stalks, with
the blossom of the sesame--may the plant, destructive of kshetriya,
shine the: kshetriya away!  
4. Reverence be to thy ploughs, reverence to thy wagon-poles and yokes!
May the plant, destructive of kshetriya, shine the kshetriya away!  
5. Reverence be to those with sunken eyes reverence to the indicenous
(evils?), reverence to the lord of the field! May the plant, destructive
of kshetriya, shine the kshetriya away!
