# PRAYERS FOR LONG LIFE AND HEALTH (ÂYUSHYÂNI).

## III, 11. Prayer for health and long life.

1\. I release thee unto life by means of (my) oblation, from unknown
decline, and from consumption. If Grâhi (seizure) has caught hold
(gagrâha) of this person here, may Indra and Agni free him from that!  
2. If his life has faded, even if he has passed away, if he has been
brought to the very vicinity of death, I snatch him from the lap of
Nirriti (the goddess of destruction): I have freed him unto a life of a
hundred autumns.  
3. I have snatched him (from death) by means of an oblation which has a
thousand eyes, hundredfold strength, and -ensures a hundredfold life, in
order that Indra may conduct him through the years across to the other
side of every misfortune.  
4. Live thou, thriving a hundred autumns, a hundred winters, and a
hundred springs! May Indra, Agni, Savitar, Brihaspati (grant) thee a
hundred years! I have snatched him (from death) with an oblation that
secures a life,of a hundred years.  
5. Enter ye, O in-breathirig and out-breathing, as two bulls a stable!
Away shall go the other deaths, of which, it is said, there are a
hundred more!  
6. Remain ye here, O in-breathing and out-breathing, do not go away from
here; do ye car anew to old age his body and his limbs!  
7. To old age I make thee over, into old age I urge thee; may a happy
old age guide thee! Away shall go the other deaths, of which, it is
said, there are a hundred more!  
8. Upon thee (life unto) old age has been deposited, as a rope is tied
upon a bull. That death which has fettered thee at thy birth with a firm
rope, Brihaspati with the hands of the truth did strip off from thee.
