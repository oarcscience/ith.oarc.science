<p>1. Rohan! art thou, causing to heal (rohan&icirc;), the broken bone thou causest to heal (rohan&icirc;): cause this here to heal (rohaya), O arundhat&icirc;!<br> 2. That bone of thine which, injured and burst, exists in thy person, Dh&acirc;tar shall kindly knit together again, joint with joint!<br> 3. Thy marrow shall unite with marrow, and thy joint (unite) with joint; the part of thy flesh that has fallen off, and thy bone shall grow together again!<br> 4. Thy marrow shall be joined together with marrow, thy skin grow together with skin! Thy blood, thy bone shall grow, thy flesh grow together with flesh!<br> 5. Fit together hair with hair, and fit together skin with skin! Thy blood, thy bone shall grow: what is cut join thou together, O plant!<br> 6. Do thou here rise up, go forth, run forth, (as) a chariot with sound wheels, firm feloe, and strong nave; stand upright firmly!<br> 7. If he has been injured by falling into a pit, or if a stone was cast and hurt him, may he (Dh&acirc;tar, the fashioner) fit him together, joint to joint, as the wagoner (Ribhu) the parts of a chariot!</p>
