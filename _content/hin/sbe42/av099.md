## VI, 75. Oblation for the suppression of enemies (nairbâdhyam havih).

1\. Forth from his home do I drive that person yonder, who as a rival
contends with us: through the oblation devoted to suppression Indra, has
broken him to pieces.  
2. Indra, the slayer of Vritra, shall drive him to the remotest
distance, from which in all successive years he shall not again
return!  
3. He shall go to the three distances, he shall go beyond the five
peoples; he shall go beyond the three ethers, whence he shall not again
in all successive years return, while the sun is upon the heavens!
