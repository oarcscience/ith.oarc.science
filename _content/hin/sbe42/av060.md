## XIX, 38. The healing properties of bdellium.

1\. \[Neither diseases, nor yet a curse, enters this person, O
arundhatî!\] From him that is penetrated by the sweet fragrance of the
healing bdellium, diseases flee in every direction, as antelopes and as
horses run.  
2. Whether, O bdellium, thou comest from the Sindhu (Indus), or whether
thou art derived from the sea, I have seized the qualities of both, that
this person shall be exempt from harm.
