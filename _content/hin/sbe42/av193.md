## VI, 120. Prayer for heaven after remission of sins.

1\. If air, or earth and heaven, if mother or father, we have injured,
may this Agni Gârhapatya (household fire) without fail lead us out from
this (crime)  
to the world of well-doing!  
2. The earth is our mother, Aditi (the universe) our kin, the air our
protector from hostile schemes. May father sky bring prosperity to us
from the world of the Fathers; may I come to my (departed) kin, and not
lose heaven!  
3. In that bright world where our pious friends live in joy, having cast
aside the ailments of their own bodies, free from lameness, not deformed
in limb, there may we behold our parents and our children!
