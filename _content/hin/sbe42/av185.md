## VI, 128. Propitiation of the weather-prophet.

1\. When the stars made Sakadhûma their king they bestowed good weather
upon him: 'This shall be his dominion,' they said.  
2. Let us have good weather at noon, good weather at eve, good weather
in the early morning, good weather in the niyht  
3. For day and night, for the stars, for sun and moon, and for us
prepare good weather, O king Sakadhûma!  
4. To thee, O Sakadhûma, ruler of the stars, that gavest us good weather
in the evening in the night, and by day, let there ever be obeisance!
