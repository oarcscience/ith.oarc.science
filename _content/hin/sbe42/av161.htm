</p>  <h2 align="center">VII, 12. Charm to procure influence in the assembly.</h2>  
<p>1. May assembly and meeting, the two daughters of Prag&acirc;pati, concurrently aid me! May he with whom I shall meet co-operate with me, may I, O ye Fathers, speak agreeably to those assembled!<br> 2. We know thy name, O assembly: 'mirth,' verily, is thy name; may all those that sit assembled in thee utter speech in harmony with me!<br> 3. Of them that are sitting together I take to myself the power and the understanding: in this entire vathering render, O Indra, me successful!<br> 4. If your mind has wandered to a distance, or has been enchained here or there, then do we turn it hither: may your mind take delight in me!</p>
