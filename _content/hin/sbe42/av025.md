## I, 24. Leprosy cured by a dark plant.

1\. The eagle (suparna) that was born at first, his gall thou wast, O
plant. The Âsurî having conquered this (gall) gave it to the trees for
their colour.  
2. The Âsurî was the first to construct this remedy for leprosy, this
destroyer of leprosy. She has destroyed the leprosy, has made the skin
of even colour.  
3. 'Even-colour' is the name of thy mother; 'Even-colour' is the name of
thy father; thou, O plant, producest even colour: render this (spot) of
even colour!  
4. The black (plant) that produces even colour has been fetched out of
the earth. Do thou now, pray, perfect this, construct anew the colours!
