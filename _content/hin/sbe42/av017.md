## I, 10. Charm against dropsy.

1\. This Asura rules over the gods; the commands of Varuna, the ruler,
surely come true. From this (trouble), from the wrath of the mighty
(Varuna), do I, excelling in my incantation, lead out this man.  
2. Reverence, O king Varuna, be to thy wrath, for all falsehood, O
mighty one, clost thou discover. A thousand others together do I make
over to thee: this thy (man) shall live a hundred autumns!  
3. From the untruth which thou hast spoken, the abundant wrong, with thy
tongue--from king, Varuna I release thee, whose laws do not fail.  
4. I release thee from Vaisvânara (Agni), from the great flood. Our
rivals, O mighty one, do thou censure here, and give heed to our prayer!
