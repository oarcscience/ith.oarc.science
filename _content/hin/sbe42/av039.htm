</p>  <h2 align="center">IV, 7. Charm against poison.</h2>  
<p>1. This water (v&acirc;r) in the (river) Varan&acirc;vat&icirc; shall ward off (v&acirc;ray&acirc;tai)! Amrita (ambrosia) has been poured into it: with that do I ward off (v&acirc;raye) poison from thee.<br> 2. Powerless is the poison from the east, powerless that from the north. Moreover the poison from the south transforms itself into a porridge.<br> 3. Having made thee (the poison) that comes from a horizontal direction into a porridge, rich in fat, and cheering, from sheer hunger he has eaten thee, that hast an evil body: do thou not cause injury!<br> 4. Thy bewildering quality (madam), O (plant?) that art bewildering (madivati), we cause to fall like a reed. As a boiling pot of porridge do we remove thee by (our) charm.<br> 5. (Thee, O poison) that art, as it were, heaped about the village, do we cause to stand still by (our) charm. Stand still as a tree upon its place; do not, thou that hast been dug with the spade, cause injury!<br> 6. With broom-straw (?), garments, and also with skins they purchased thee: a thing for barter art thou, O plant! Do not, thou that hast been dug with the spade, cause injury!<br> 7. Those of you who were of yore unequalled in the deeds which they performed-may the), not injure here our men: for this very purpose do I engage you!</p>
