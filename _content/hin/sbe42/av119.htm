</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 25. Charm to arouse the passionate love of a woman.</h2>  
<p>1. May (love), the disquieter, disquiet thee; do not hold out upon thy bed! With the terrible arrow of K&acirc;ma (love) do I pierce thee in the heart.<br> 2. The arrow, winged with longing, barbed with love, whose shaft is undeviating desire, with that, well-aimed, K&acirc;ma shall pierce thee in the heart!<br> 3. With that well-aimed arrow of K&acirc;ma which parches the spleen, whose plume flies forward, which burns up, do I pierce thee in the heart.<br> 4. Consumed by burning ardour, with parched mouth, do thou (woman) come to me, pliant, (thy) pride laid aside, mine alone, speaking sweetly and to me devoted!<br> 5. I drive thee with a goad from thy mother and thy father, so that thou shalt be in my power, shalt come up to my wish.<br> 6. All her thoughts do ye, O Mitra and Varuna, drive out of her! Then, having deprived her of her will,.put her into my power alone!</p>
