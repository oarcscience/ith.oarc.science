<p>1. This plant is born of honey, with honey do we dig for thee. Of honey thou art begotten, do thou make us full of honey!<br> 2. At the tip of my tongue may I have honey, at my tongue's root the sweetness of honey! In my power alone shalt thou then be, thou shalt come up to my wish!<br> 3. Sweet as honey is my entrance, sweet as honey my departure. With my voice do I speak sweet as honey, may I become like honey!<br> 4. I am sweeter than honey, fuller of sweetness than licorice. Mayest thou, without fail, long for me alone, (as a bee) for a branch full of honey!<br> 5. I have surrounded thee with a clinging sugarcane, to remove aversion, so that thou shalt not be averse to me!</p>
