## IX, 8. Charm to procure immunity from all diseases.

1\. Headache and suffering in the head, pain in the ears and flow of
blood, every disease of the head, do we charm forth from thee.  
2. From thy ears, from thy kankûshas the earpain, and the
neuralgia--every disease of the head do we charm forth from thee.  
3. (With the charm) through whose agency disease hastens forth from the
ears and the mouth-every disease of the head do we charm forth from
thee.  
4. (The disease) that renders a man deaf and blind--every disease of the
head do we charm forth from thee.  
5. Pain in the limbs, fever in the limbs, the neuralgia that affects
every limb-every disease of the head do we charm forth from thee.  
6. (The disease) whose frightful aspect makes man tremble, the takman
(fever) that comes every autumn, do we charm forth from thee.  
7. The disease that creeps along the thighs, and then enters the canals,
out of thy inner parts do we charm forth.  
8. If from the heart, from love, or from disgust, it arises, from thy
heart and from thy limbs the balâsa do we charm forth.  
9. Jaundice from thy limbs, diarrhoea from within thy bowels, the core
of disease from thy inner soul do we charm forth.  
10. To ashes (âsa) the balâsa shall turn; what is diseased shall turn to
urine! The poison of all diseases I have charmed forth from thee.  
11. Outside the opening (of the bladder) it shall run off; the rumbling
shall pass from thy belly! The poison of all diseases I have charmed
forth from thee.  
12. From thy belly, lungs, navel, and heart-the poison of all diseases I
have charmed forth from thee.  
13. (The pains) that split the crown (of the head), pierce the head,
without doing injury, without causing disease, they shall run off
outside the opening (of the bladder)!  
14. They that pierce the heart, creep along the ribs, without doing
injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening

injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening
(of the bladder)!  
16. They that pierce crosswise, burrow in thy abdomen, without doing
injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening
(of the bladder)!  
17. They that creep along the rectum, twist the bowels, without doing
injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening
(of the bladder)!  
18. They that suck the marrow, and split the joints, without doing
injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening
(of the bladder)!  
19. The diseases and the injuries that paralyse thy limbs, the poison of
all diseases I have charmed forth from thee.  
20. Of neuralgia, of abscesses, of inflation, or of inflammation of the
eyes, the poison of all diseases I have driven forth from thee.  
21. From thy feet, knees, thighs, and bottom; from thy spine, and thy
neck the piercing pains, from thy head the ache I have removed.  
22. Firm are the bones of thy skull, and the beat of thy heart. At thy
rising, O sun, thou didst remove the pains of the head, quiet the pangs
in the limbs.
