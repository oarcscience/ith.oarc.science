## X, 4. Charm against serpents, invoking the horse of Pedu that slays serpents.

1\. To Indra belongs the first chariot, to the gods the second chariot,
to Varuna, forsooth, the third. The serpents' chariot is the last: it
shall hit a post, and come to grief!  
2. The young darbha-grass burns (the serpents?), the tail of the horse,
the tail of the shaggy one, the seat of the wagon (burns the
serpents?).  
3. Strike down, O white (horse), with thy forefoot and thy hind-foot! As
timber floating in water, the poison of the serpents, the fierce fluid,
is devoid of strength.  
4. Neighing loudly he dived down, and, again diving up, said: 'As timber
floating in water, the poison of the serpents, the fierce fluid, is
devoid of strength.'  
5. The horse of Pedu slays the kasarnîla, the horse of Pedu slays the
white (serpent), and also the black. The horse of Pedu cleaves the head
of the ratharvî, the adder.  
6. O horse of Pedu, go thou first: we come after thee! Thou shalt cast
out the serpents from the road upon which we come!  
7. Here the horse of Pedu was born; from here is his departure. Here are
the tracks of the serpent-killing, powerful steed!  
8. May the closed (serpent's jaw) not snap open, may the open one not
close! The two serpents in this field, man and wife, they are both
bereft of strength.  
9. Without strength here are the serpents, those that are near, and
those that are far. With a club do I slay the vriskika (scorpion), with
a staff the serpent that has approached.  
10. Here is the remedy for both the aghâsva and the svaga! Indra (and)
Pedu's horse have put to naught the evil-planning (aghâyantam)
serpent.  
11. The horse of Pedu do we remember, the strong, with strong footing:
behind he, staring forth, these adders.  
12. Deprived are they of life's spirit, deprived of poison, slain by
Indra with his bolt. Indra hath slain them: we have slain them.  
13. Slain are they that are striped across, crushed are the adders! Slay
thou the one that produces a hood, (slay) the white and the black in the
darbha-grass!  
14. The maiden of the Kirâta-tribe, the little one digs up the remedy,
with golden spades, on the mountain's back.  
15. Hither has come a youthful physician: he slays the speckled
(serpent), is irresistible. He, forsooth, crushes the svaga and the
vriskika both.  
16. Indra did set at naught for me the serpent, (and so did) Mitra and
Varuna, Vâta and Parganya both.  
17. Indra did set at naught for me the serpent, the adder, male and
female, the svaga, (the serpent) that is striped across, the kasarnîla,
and the dasonasi.  
18. Indra slew thy first ancestor, O serpent, and since they are
crushed, what strength, forsooth, can be theirs?  
19. I have gathered up their heads, as the fisherman the karvara (fish).
I have gone off into the river's midst, and washed out the serpent's
poison.  
20. The poison of all serpents the rivers shall carry off! Slain are
they that are striped across, crushed are the adders!  
21. As skilfully I cull the fibre of the plants, as I guide the mares,
(thus), O serpent, shall thy poison go away!  
22. The poison that is in the fire, in the sun, in the earth, and in the
plants, the kândâ-poison, the kanaknaka, thy poison shall go forth, and
come!  
23. The serpents that are sprung from the fire, that are sprung from the
plants, that are sprung from the water, and originate from the
lightning; they from whom great brood has sprung in many ways, those
serpents do we revere with obeisance.  
24. Thou art, (O plant), a maiden, Taudî by name.; Ghritâkî, forsooth,
is thy name. Underfoot is thy place: I take in hand what destroys the
poison.  
25. From every limb make the poison start; shut it out from the heart!
Now the force that is in thy poison shall go down below!  
26. The poison has gone to a distance: he has shut it out; he has fused
the poison with poison. Agni has put away the poison of the serpent,
Soma has led it out. The poison has gone back to the biter. The serpent
is dead!
