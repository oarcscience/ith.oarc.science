</p>  <h2 align="center">I, 23. Leprosy cured by a dark plant.</h2>  
<p>1. Born by night art thou, O plant, dark, black, sable. Do thou, that art rich in colour, stain this leprosy, and the gray spots!<br> 2. The leprosy and the gray spots drive away from here--may thy native colour settle upon thee--the white spots cause to fly away!<br> 3. Sable is thy hiding-place, sable thy dwelling-place, sable art thou, O plant: drive away from here the speckled spots!<br> 4. The leprosy which has originated in the bones, and that which has originated in the body and upon the skin, the white mark begotten of corruption, I have destroyed with my charm.</p>
