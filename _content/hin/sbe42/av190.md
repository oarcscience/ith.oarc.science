## VI, 115. Expiatory formulas for sins.

1\. From the sins which knowingly or unknowingly we have committed, do
ye, all gods, of one accord, release us!  
2. If awake, or if asleep, to sin inclined, I have committed a sin, may
what has been, and what shall be, as if from a wooden post, release
me!  
3. As one released from a wooden post, as one in a sweat by bathing (is
cleansed) of filth, as ghee is clarified by the sieve, may all (the
gods) clear me from sin!
