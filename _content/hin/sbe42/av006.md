## V, 4. Prayer to the kushtha-plant to destroy takman (fever).

1\. Thou that art born upon the mountains, as the most potent of plants,
come hither, O kushtha, destroyer of the takman, to drive out from here
the takman!  
2. To thee (that growest) upon the mountain, the brooding-place of the
eagle, (and) art sprung from Himavant, they come with treasures, having
heard (thy fame). For they know (thee to be) the destroyer of the
takman.  
3. The asvattha-tree is the seat of the gods in the third heaven from
here. There the gods procured the kushtha, the visible manifestation of
amrita (ambrosia).  
4. A golden ship with golden tackle moved upon the heavens. There the
gods procured the kushtha, the flower of amrita (ambrosia).  
5. The paths were golden, and golden were the oars; golden were the
ships, upon which they carried forth the kushtha hither (to the
mountain).  
6. This person here, O kushtha, restore for me, and cure him! Render him
free from sickness for me!  
7. Thou art born of the gods, thou art Soma's good friend. Be thou
propitious to my in-breathing and my out-breathing, and to this eye of
mine!  
8. Sprung in the north from the Himavant (mountains), thou art brought
to the people in the east. There the most stiperior varieties of the
kushtha were apportioned.  
9. 'Superior,' O kushtha, is thy name; 'superior' is the name of thy
father. Do thou drive out all disease, and render the takman devoid of
strength!  
10. Pain in the head, affliction in the eye, and ailment of the body,
all that shall the kushtha heal-a divinely powerful (remedy), forsooth!
