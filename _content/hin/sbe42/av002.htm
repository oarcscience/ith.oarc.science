Charm against takman (fever) and related diseases.</h2>  
<p>1. May Agni drive the takman away from here, may Soma, the press-stone, and Varuna, of tried skill; may the altar, the straw (upon the altar), and the brightly-flaming fagots (drive him away)! Away to naught shall go the hateful powers!<br> 2. Thou that makest all men sallow, inflarning them like a searing fire, even now, O takman, thou shalt become void of strength: do thou now go away down, aye, into the depths!<br> The takman that is spotted, covered Nvith spots, like reddish sediment, him thou, (O plant) of unremitting potency, drive away down below!<br> 4. Having made obeisance to the takman, I cast him down below: let him, the champion of Sakambhara, return again to the Mah&acirc;vrishas!<br> 5. His home is with the M&ucirc;gavants, his home with the Mah&acirc;vrishas. From the moment of thy birth thou art indigenous with the Balhikas.<br> 6. O takman, vy&acirc;la, v&icirc;gada, vy&acirc;nga, hold off (thy missile) far! Seek the gadabout slave-girl, strike her with thy bolt!<br> 7. O takman, go to the M&ucirc;gavants, or to the Balhikas farther away! Seek the lecherous S&ucirc;dra female: her, O takman, give a good shaking-up!<br> 8. Go away to the Mah&acirc;vrishas and the M&ucirc;gavants, thy kinsfolk, and consume them! Those (regions) do we bespeak for the takman, or these regions here other (than ours).<br> 9. (If) in other regions thou dost not abide, mayest thou that art powerful take pity on us! Takman, now, has become eager: he will go to the Balhikas.<br> 10. When thou, being cold, and then again deliriously hot, accompanied by cough, didst cause the (sufferer) to shake, then, O takman, thy missiles were terrible: from these surely exempt us!<br> 11. By no means ally thyself with bal&acirc;sa, cough and spasm! From there do thou not return hither again: that, O takman, do I ask of thee!<br> 12. O takman, along with thy brother bal&acirc;sa, along with thy sister cough, along with thy cousin p&acirc;man, go to yonder foreign folk!<br> 13. Destroy the takman that returns on (each) third day, the one that intermits (each) third day, the one that continues without intermission, and the autumnal one; destroy the cold takman, the hot, him that comes in summer, and him that arrives in the rainy season!<br> 14. To the Gandh&acirc;ris, the M&acirc;gavants, the Angas, and the Magadhas, we deliver over the takman, like a servant, like a treasure!</p>
