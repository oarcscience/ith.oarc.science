## I, 34. Charm with licorice, to secure the love of a woman.

1\. This plant is born of honey, with honey do we dig for thee. Of honey
thou art begotten, do thou make us full of honey!  
2. At the tip of my tongue may I have honey, at my tongue's root the
sweetness of honey! In my power alone shalt thou then be, thou shalt
come up to my wish!  
3. Sweet as honey is my entrance, sweet as honey my departure. With my
voice do I speak sweet as honey, may I become like honey!  
4. I am sweeter than honey, fuller of sweetness than licorice. Mayest
thou, without fail, long for me alone, (as a bee) for a branch full of
honey!  
5. I have surrounded thee with a clinging sugarcane, to remove aversion,
so that thou shalt not be averse to me!
