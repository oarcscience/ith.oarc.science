</p>  <h2 align="center">V, 7. Prayer to appease Ar&acirc;ti, the demon of grudge and avarice.</h2>  
<p>1. Bring (wealth) to us, do not stand in our way, O Ar&acirc;ti; do not keep from us the sacrificial reward as it is being taken (to us)! Adoration be to the power of grudge, the power of failure, adoration to Ar&acirc;ti!<br> 2. To thy advising minister, whom thou, Ar&acirc;ti, didst make thy agent, do we make obeisance. Do not bring failure to my wish!<br> 3. May our wish, instilled by the gods, be fulfilled by day and night! We go in quest of Ar&acirc;ti. Adoration be to Ar&acirc;ti!<br> 4. Sarasvat&icirc; (speech), Anumati (favour), and Bhaga (fortune) we go to invoke. Pleasant, honied, words I have spoken on the occasions when the gods were invoked.<br> 5. Him whom I implore with V&acirc;k Sarasvat&icirc; (the goddess-of speech), the yoke-fellow of thought, faith shall find to-day, bestowed by the brown soma!<br> 6. Neither our wish nor our speech do thou frustrate! May Indra and Agni both bring us wealth! Do ye all who to-day desire to make gifts to us gain favour with Ar&acirc;ti!<br> 7. Go far away, failure! Thy missile do we avert. I know thee (to be) oppressive and piercing, O Ar&acirc;ti!<br> 8. Thou dost even transform thyself into a naked woman, and attach thyself to people in their sleep, frustrating, O Ar&acirc;ti, the thought, and intention of man.<br> 9. To her who, great, and of great dimension, did penetrate all the regions, to this golden-locked Nirriti (goddess of misfortune), I have rendered obeisance.<br> 10. To the gold-complexioned, lovely one, who rests upon golden cushions, to the great one, to that Ar&acirc;ti who wears golden robes, I have rendered obeisance.</p>
