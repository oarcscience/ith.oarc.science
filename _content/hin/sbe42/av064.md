## II, 32. Charm to secure perfect health.

1\. From thy eyes, thy nostrils, ears, and chin--the disease which is
seated in thy head--from thy brain and tongue I do tear it out.  
2. From thy neck, nape of the neck, ribs, and spine--the disease which
is seated in thy fore-arm--from thy shoulders and arms I do tear it
out.  
3. From thy heart, thy lungs, viscera, and sides; from thy kidneys,
spleen, and liver we do tear out the disease.  
4. From thy entrails, canals, rectum, and abdomen; from thy belly, guts,
and navel I do tear out the disease.  
5. From thy thighs, knees, heels, and the tips of thy feet--from thy
hips I do tear out the disease seated in thy buttocks, from thy bottom
the disease seated in thy buttocks.  
6. From thy bones, marrow, sinews and arteries; from thy hands, fingers,
and nails I do tear out the disease.  
7. The disease that is in thy every limb, thy every hair, thy every
joint; that which is seated in thy skin, with Kasyapa's charm, that
tears out, to either side we do tear it out.
