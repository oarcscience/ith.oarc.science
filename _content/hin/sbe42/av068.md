## II, 28. Prayer for long life pronounced over a boy.

1\. For thee alone, O (death from) old age, this (boy) shall grow up:
the other hundred kinds of death shall not harm him! Like a provident
mother in her lap Mitra shall befriend him, shall save him from
misfortune!  
2. May Mitra or Varuna, the illustrious, cooperating, grant him death
from old age! Then Agni, the priest, who knows the ways, promulgates all
the races of the gods.  
3. Thou, (O Agni), rulest over all the animals of the earth, those which
have been born, and those which are to be born: may not in-breathing
leave this one, nor yet out-breathing, may neither friends nor foes slay
him!  
4. May father Dyaus (sky) and mother Prithivi (earth), co-operating,
grant thee death from old age, that thou mayest live in the lap of Aditi
a hundred winters, guarded by in-breathing and outbreathing!  
5. Lead this dear child to life and vigour, O Agni, Varuna, and king
Mitra! As a mother afford him protection, O Aditi, and all ye gods, that
he may attain to old age!
