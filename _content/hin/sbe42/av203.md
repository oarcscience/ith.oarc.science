## XI, 1. The preparation of the brahmaudana, the porridge given as a fee to the Brahmans.

1\. O Agni, come into being! Aditi here in her throes, longing for sons,
is cooking the porridge for the Brahmans, The seven Rishis, that did
create the beings, shall here churn thee, along with progeny!  
2. Produce the smoke, ye lusty friends; unharmed by wiles go ye into the
contest! Here is the Agni (fire) who gains battles, and commands
powerful warriors, with whom the gods did conquer the demons.  
3. O Agni, to a great heroic deed thou wast aroused, to cook the
Brahman's porridge, O Gâtavedas! The seven Rishis, that did create the
beings, have produced thee. Grant her (the wife) wealth together with
undiminished heroes!  
4. Burn, O Agni, after having been kindled by the firewood, bring
skilfully hither the gods that are to be revered! Causing the oblation
to cook for these (Brahmans), do thou raise this (sacrificer) to the
highest firmament!  
5. The, threefold share which was of yore assigned to you (belongs) to
the gods, the (departed) Fathers, and to the mortals (the priests). Know
your shares! I divide them for you: the (share) of the gods shall
protect this (woman)!  
6. O Agni, possessed of might, superior, thou dost without fail prevail!
Bend down to the ground our hateful rivals!--This measure, that is being
measured, and has been measured, may constitute thy kin into (people)
that render thee tribute!  
7. Mayest thou together with thy kin be endowed with sap! Elevate her
(the wife) to great heroism! Ascend on high to the base of the
firmament, which they call 'the world of brightness'!  
8. This great goddess earth, kindly disposed, shall receive the
(sacrificial) skin! Then may we go to the world of well-doing
(heaven)!  
9. Lay these two press-stones, well coupled, upon the skin; crush
skilfully the (soma-) shoots for the sacrificer! Crush down, (O earth),
and beat down, those who are hostile to her (the wife); lift up high,
and elevate her offspring!  
10. Take into thy hands, O man, the press-stones that work together: the
gods that are to be revered have come to thy sacrifice! Whatever three
wishes thou dost choose, I shall here procure for thee unto
fulfilment.  
11. This, (O winnowing-basket), is thy purpose, and this thy nature: may
Aditi, mother of heroes, take hold of thee! Winnow out those who are
hostile to this (woman); afford her wealth and undiminished heroes!  
12. Do ye, (O grains), remain in the (winnowing-) basket, while (the
wind) blows over you; be separated, ye who are fit for the sacrifice,
from the chaff! May we in happiness be superior to all our equals! I
bend down under our feet those that hate us.  
13. Retire, O woman, and return promptly! The stable of the waters
(water-vessel) has settled upon thee, that thou mayest carry it: of
these (the waters) thou shalt take such as are fit for sacrifice; having
intelligently divided them off, thou shalt leave the rest behind!  
14. These bright women, (the waters), have come hither. Arise, thou
woman, and gather strength! To thee, that art rendered by thy husband a
true wife, (and) by thy children rich in offspring, the sacrifice has
come: receive the (water-) vessel!  
15. The share of food that belongs to you of yore has been set aside for
you. Instructed by the Rishis bring thou (woman) hither this water! May
this sacrifice win advancement for you, win prAection, win offspring for
you; may it be mighty, win cattle, and heroes for you!  
16. O Agni, the sacrificial pot has settled upon thee: do thou shining,
brightly glowing, heat it with thy glow! May the divine descendants of
the Rishis, assembled about their share (of the porridge), full of
fervour, heat this (pot) at the proper time!  
17. Pure and clear may these sacrificial women, the waters bright, flow
into the pot! The), have given us abundant offspring and cattle. May he
that cooks the porridge go to the world of the pious (heaven)!  
18. Purified by (our) prayer, and clarified by the ghee are the
soma-shoots, (and) these sacrificial grains. Enter the water; may the
pot receive you! When ye have cookect this (porridge) go ye to the world
of the pious (heaven)!  
19. Spread out far unto great extent, with a thousand surfaces, in the
world of the pious! Grandfathers, fathers, children, grandchildren--I am
the fifteenth one that did cook thee.  
20. The porridge has a thousand surfaces, a hundred streams, and is
indestructible; it is the road of the gods, leads to heaven. Yonder
(enemies) do I place upon thee: injure them and their offspring; (but)
to me that brings gifts thou shalt be merciful!  
21. Step upon the altar (vedi); make this woman thrive in her progeny;
repel the demons.; advance her! May we in happiness be superior to all
our equals! I bend down under our feet all those that hate us.  
22. Turn towards her with cattle, (thou pot), face towards her, together
with the divine powers! Neither curses nor hostile magic shall reach
thee; rule in thy dwelling free from disease!  
23. Properly built, placed with care, this altar (vedi) has been
arranged of yore for the Brahmans porridge. Put it, O woman, upon the
purified amsadhrl; place there the porridge for the divine
(Brâhmanas)!  
24. May this sacrificial ladle (sruk), the second hand of Aditi, which
the seven Rishis, the creators of the beings, did fashion, may this
spoon, knowing the limbs of the porridge, heap it upon the altar!  
25. The divine (Brâhmanas) shall sit down to thee, the cooked saerfice:
do thou again descending from the fire, approach them! Clarified by soma
settle in the belly of the Brâhmanas; the descendants of the Rishis who
eat thee shall not take harm!  
26. O king Soma, infuse harmony into the good Brâhmanas who shall sit
about thee! Eagerly do I invite to the porridge the Rishis, descended
from Rishis, that are born of religious fervour, and gladly obey the
call.  
27. These pure and clear sacrificial women (the waters) I put into the
hands of the Brâhmanas severally. With whatever wish I pour this upon
you, may Indra. accompanied by the Maruts grant this to me!  
28. This gold is my immortal light, this ripe fruit of the field is my
wish-granting cow. This treasure I present to the Brâhmanas: I prepare
for myself a road that leads. to the Fathers in the heavens.  
29. Scatter the spelt into Agni Gâtavedas (the fire), sweep away to a
far distance the chaff! This (chaff) we have heard, is the share of the
ruler of the house (Agni), and we know, too, what belonos to Nirriti
(destruction) as her share.  
30. Note, (O porridge), him that takes pains, and cooks and presses the
soma; lift him up to the heavenly road, upon which, after he has reached
the fullest age, he shall ascend to the highest firmament, the supreme
heavens!  
31. Anoint (with ghee), O adhvaryu (priest), the surface of this
sustaining (porridge), make skilfully a place for the melted butter;
with ghee do thou anoint all its limbs! I prepare for myself a road that
leads to the Fathers in the heavens.  
32. O sustaining (porridge), cast destruction and strife among such as
are sitting about thee, and are not Brâhmanas! (But) the descendants of
the -Rishis, that eat thee, being full of substance, spreading forth,
shall not take harm!  
33. To the descendants of the Rishis I make thee over, O porridge; those
who are not descended from Rishis have no share in it! May Agni as my
guardian, may all the Maruts, and all the gods watch over the cooked
food!  
34. Thee (the porridge) that milkest the sacrifice, art evermore
abundant, the male milch-cow, the seat of wealth, we beseech for
immortality of off-spring and long life with abundance of wealth.  
35. Thou art a lusty male, penetratest heaven: go thou to the Rishis,
descended from Rishis! Dwell in the world of the pious: there is a
well-prepared (place) for us two!  
36. Pack thyself up, go forth! O Agni, prepare the roads, that lead to
the gods! By these: well-prepared (roads) may we reach the sacrifice,
standing upon the firmament (that shines) with seven rays!  
37. With the light with which the gods, having cooked the porridge for
the Brâmanas, ascended to heaven, to the world of the pious, with that
would we go to the world of the pious, ascending to the light, to the
highest firmament!
