## VI, 136. Charm with the plant nitatni to promote the growth of hair.

1\. As a goddess upon the goddess earth thou wast born, O plant! We dig
thee up, O nitatni, that thou mayest strengthen (the growth) of the
hair.  
2. Strengthen the old (hair), beget the new! That which has come forth
render more luxurious!  
3. That hair of thine which does drop off, and that which is broken root
and all, upon it do I sprinkle here the all-healing herb.
