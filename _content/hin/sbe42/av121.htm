</p>  <h2 align="center">VII, 38. Charm to secure the love of a man.</h2>  
<p>1. This potent herb do I dig out: it draws toward me the eve, causes (love's) tears. It brings back him who has gone to a distance, rejoices him that approaches me.<br> 2. By (the plant) with which the &Acirc;sur&icirc; allured Indra away from the gods, by that do I subject thee, that I may be well-beloved of thee!<br> 3. Thy face is turned towards Soma (the nioon), thy face is turned towards S&ucirc;rya (the sun), thy face is turned towards all the gods: 't is tliee here that we do invoke.<br> 4. My speech, not thine, (in this matter) hath weight: in the assembly, forsooth, do thou speak! To me alone shalt thou belong, shalt not even discourse of other women!<br> 5. Whether thou art beyond the haunts of men, or whether across the river, this very herb, as if a captive bound, shall bring, thee back to me!</p>
