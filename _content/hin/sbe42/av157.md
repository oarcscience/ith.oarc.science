## VI, 64. Charm to allay discord.

1\. Do ye agree, unite yourselves, may your minds be in harmony, just as
the gods of old in harmony-. sat down to their share!  
2. Same be their counsel, same their assembly, same their aim, in common
their thought! The 'same' oblation do I sacrifice for you: do ye enter
upon the same plan!  
Same be your intention, same your hearts! Same be your mind, so that it
may be perfectly in common to you!
