</p>  <h2 align="center">III, 18. Charm of a woman against a rival or co-wife.</h2>  
<p>1. I dig up this plant, of herbs the most potent, by whose power rival women are overcome, and husbands are obtained.<br> 2. O thou (plant) with erect leaves, lovely, do thou, urged on by the gods, full of might, drive away my rival, make my h usband mine alone!<br> 3. He did not, forsooth, call thy name, and thou shalt not delight in this' husband! To the very farthest distance do we drive our rival.<br> 4. Superior am I, O superior (plant), superior, truly, to superior (women). Now shall my rival be inferior to those that are inferior!<br> 5. I am overpowering, and thou, (O plant), art completely overpowering. Having both grown full of power, let us overpower my rival!<br> 6. About thee (my husband) I have placed the overpowering (plant), upon thee placed the very overpowering one. May thy mind run after me as a calf after the cow, as water along its course!</p>
