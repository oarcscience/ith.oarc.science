## I, 14. A woman's incantation against her rival.

1\. I have taken unto myself her fortune and her glory, as a wreath off
a tree. Like a mountain with broad foundation may she sit a long time
with her parents!  
2. This woman shall be subjected to thee as thy wife, O king Yama; (till
then) let her be fixed to the house of her mother, or her brother, or
her father!  
3. This woman shall be the keeper of thy house, O king (Yama), and her
do we make over to thee! May she long sit with her relatives, until (her
hair) drops from her head!  
4. With the incantation of Asita, of Kasyapa, and of Gaya do I cover up
thy fortune, as women cover (something) within a chest.
