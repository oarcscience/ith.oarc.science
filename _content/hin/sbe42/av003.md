## VI, 20. Charm against takman (fever).

1\. As if from this Agni (fire), that burns and flashes, (the takman)
comes. Let him then, too, as a babbling drunkard, pass away! Let him,
the impious one, search out some other person, not ourselves! Reverence
be to the takman with the burning weapon!  
2. Reverence be to Rudra, reverence to the takman, reverence to the
luminous king Varuna! Reverence to heaven, reverence to earth, reverence
to the plants!  
3. To thee here, that burnest through, and turnest all bodies yellow, to
the red, to the brown, to the takman produced by the forest, do I render
obeisance.
