## VI, 130. Charm to arouse the passionate love of a man.

1\. This yearning love comes from the Apsaras, the victorious, imbued
with victory. Ye gods, send forth the yearning love: may yonder man burn
after me!  
2. My wish is, he shall long for me, devoted he shall long for me! Ye
gods, send forth the yearning love: may yonder man burn after me!  
3. That yonder man shall long for me, (but) I for him nevermore, ye
gods, send forth the yearning love: may yonder man burn after me!  
4. Do ye, O Maruts, intoxicate him (With love); do thou, O mid-air,
intoxicate him; do thou, O Agni, intoxicate him! May yonder man burn
after me!
