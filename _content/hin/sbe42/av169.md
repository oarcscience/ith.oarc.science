## III, 14. Charm for the prosperity of cattle.

1\. With a firmly founded stable, with wealth, with well-being, with the
name of that which is born on a lucky day do we unite you (O cattle)!  
2. May Aryaman unite you, may Pûshan, Brihaspati, and Indra, the
conqueror of booty, unite you! Do ye prosper my possessions!  
Flocking together without fear, making ordure in this stable, holding
honey fit for soma, free from disease, ye shall come hither!  
4. Right here come, ye cows, and prosper here like the sakâ-bird! And
right here do ye beget (your youn(y)! May ye be in accord with me!  
5. May your stable be auspicious to you, prosper ye like the sâri-birds
and parrots! And right here do ye beget (your young)! With us do we
unite you.  
6. Attach yourselves, O cows, to me as your possessor; may this stable
here cause you to prosper! Upon you, growing numerous, and living, may
we, increasing in wealth, alive, attend!
