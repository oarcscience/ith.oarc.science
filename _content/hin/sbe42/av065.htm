</p>  <h2 align="center">IX, 8. Charm to procure immunity from all diseases.</h2>  
<p>1. Headache and suffering in the head, pain in the ears and flow of blood, every disease of the head, do we charm forth from thee.<br> 2. From thy ears, from thy kank&ucirc;shas the earpain, and the neuralgia--every disease of the head do we charm forth from thee.<br> 3. (With the charm) through whose agency disease hastens forth from the ears and the mouth-every disease of the head do we charm forth from thee.<br> 4. (The disease) that renders a man deaf and blind--every disease of the head do we charm forth from thee.<br> 5. Pain in the limbs, fever in the limbs, the neuralgia that affects every limb-every disease of the head do we charm forth from thee.<br> 6. (The disease) whose frightful aspect makes man tremble, the takman (fever) that comes every autumn, do we charm forth from thee.<br> 7. The disease that creeps along the thighs, and then enters the canals, out of thy inner parts do we charm forth.<br> 8. If from the heart, from love, or from disgust, it arises, from thy heart and from thy limbs the bal&acirc;sa do we charm forth.<br> 9. Jaundice from thy limbs, diarrhoea from within thy bowels, the core of disease from thy inner soul do we charm forth.<br> 10. To ashes (&acirc;sa) the bal&acirc;sa shall turn; what is diseased shall turn to urine! The poison of all diseases I have charmed forth from thee.<br> 11. Outside the opening (of the bladder) it shall run off; the rumbling shall pass from thy belly! The poison of all diseases I have charmed forth from thee.<br> 12. From thy belly, lungs, navel, and heart-the poison of all diseases I have charmed forth from thee.<br> 13. (The pains) that split the crown (of the head), pierce the head, without doing injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening (of the bladder)!<br> 14. They that pierce the heart, creep along the ribs, without doing injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening (of the bladder)!<br> 15. They that pierce the sides, bore along the ribs, without doing injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening (of the bladder)!<br> 16. They that pierce crosswise, burrow in thy abdomen, without doing injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening (of the bladder)!<br> 17. They that creep along the rectum, twist the bowels, without doing injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening (of the bladder)!<br> 18. They that suck the marrow, and split the joints, without doing injury, without causing disease, they shall run off outside the opening (of the bladder)!<br> 19. The diseases and the injuries that paralyse thy limbs, the poison of all diseases I have charmed forth from thee.<br> 20. Of neuralgia, of abscesses, of inflation, or of inflammation of the eyes, the poison of all diseases I have driven forth from thee.<br> 21. From thy feet, knees, thighs, and bottom; from thy spine, and thy neck the piercing pains, from thy head the ache I have removed.<br> 22. Firm are the bones of thy skull, and the beat of thy heart. At thy rising, O sun, thou didst remove the pains of the head, quiet the pangs in the limbs.</p>
