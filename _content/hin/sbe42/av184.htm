</p>  <h2 align="center">VII, 9. Charm for finding lost property.</h2>  
<p>1. On the distant path of the paths P&ucirc;shan was born, on the distant path of heaven, on the distant path of the earth. Upon the two most lovely places both he walks hither and away, knowing (the way).<br> 2. P&ucirc;shan knows these regions all; he shall lead us by the most dangerless (way). Bestowing well-being, of radiant glow, keeping our heroes undiminished, he shall, alert and skilful, go before us!<br> 3. O P&ucirc;shan, under thy law may we never suffer harm: as praisers of thee are we here!<br> 4. P&ucirc;shan shall from the east place his right hand about us, shall bring again to us what has been lost: we shall come upon what has been lost!</p>
