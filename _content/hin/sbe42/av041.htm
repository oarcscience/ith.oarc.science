</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 13 Charm against snake-poison.</h2>  
<p>1. Varuna, the sage of heaven, verily lends (power) to rne. With mighty charms do I dissolve thy poison. The (poison) which has been dug, that which has not been dug, and that which is inherent, I have held fast. As a brook in the desert thy poison has dried up.<br> 2. That poison of thine which is not fluid I have confined within these (serpents?). I hold fast the sap that is in thy middle, thy top, and in thy bottom, too. May (the sap) now vanish out of thee from fright!<br> 3. My lusty shout (is) as the thunder with the cloud: then do I smite thy (sap) with my strong charm. With manly strength I have held fast that sap of his. May the sun rise as light from the darkness!<br> 4. With my eye do I slay thy eye, with poison do I slay thy poison. O serpent, die, do not live; back upon thee shall thy poison turn!<br> 5. O kair&acirc;ta, speckled one, upatrinya (grass-dweller?), brown one, listen to me; ye black repulsive reptiles, (listen to me)! Do not stand upon the ground of my friend; cease with your poison and make it known (to people?)!<br> 6. I release (thee) from the fury of the black serpent, the taim&acirc;ta, the brown serpent, the poison that is not fluid, the all-conquering, as the bowstring (is loosened) from the bow, as chariots (from horses).<br> 7. Both &Acirc;lig&icirc; and Vilig&icirc;, both father and mother, we know your kin everywhere. Deprived of your strength what will ye do?<br> 8. The daughter of urug&ucirc;l&acirc;, the evil one born with the black--of all those who have run to their hiding-place the poison is devoid of force.<br> 9. The prickly porcupine, tripping down from the mountain, did declare this: 'Whatsoever serpents, living in ditches, are here, their poison is most deficient in force.'<br> 10. T&acirc;buvam (or) not t&acirc;buvam, thou (O serpent) art not t&acirc;buvam. Through t&acirc;buvam thy poison is bereft of force.<br> 11. Tastuvam (or) not tastuvam, thou (O serpent) art not tastuvam. Through tastuvarn thy poison is bereft of force.</p>
