<p>1. The eagle (suparna) that was born at first, his gall thou wast, O plant. The &Acirc;sur&icirc; having conquered this (gall) gave it to the trees for their colour.<br> 2. The &Acirc;sur&icirc; was the first to construct this remedy for leprosy, this destroyer of leprosy. She has destroyed the leprosy, has made the skin of even colour.<br> 3. 'Even-colour' is the name of thy mother; 'Even-colour' is the name of thy father; thou, O plant, producest even colour: render this (spot) of even colour!<br> 4. The black (plant) that produces even colour has been fetched out of the earth. Do thou now, pray, perfect this, construct anew the colours!</p>
