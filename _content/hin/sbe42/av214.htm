</p>  <h2 align="center">XIX, 54. Prayer to K&acirc;la (time), personified as a primordial power.</h2>  
<p>1. From Time the waters did arise, from Time the brahma (spiritual exaltation), the tapas (creative fervour), the regions (of space did arise). Through Time the sun rises, in Time he goes down again.<br> 2. Through Time the wind blows, through Time (exists) the great earth; the great sky is fixed in Time. In Time the son (Prag&acirc;pati) begot of yore that which was, and that which shall be.<br> 3. From Time the Riks arose, the Yagus was born from Time; Time put forth the sacrifice, the imperishable share of the gods.<br> 4. Upon Time the Gandharvas and Apsarases are founded, upon Time the worlds (are founded), in Time this Angiras and Atharvan rule over the heavens.<br> 5. Having conquered this world and the highest world, and the holy (pure) worlds (and) their holy divisions; having by means of the brahma (spiritual exaltation) conquered all the worlds, Time, the highest God, forsooth, hastens onward.</p>
