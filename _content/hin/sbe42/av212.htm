<p>1. To the bull that slays the enemy, to K&acirc;ma, do I render tribute with ghee, oblation, and (sacrificial) melted butter. Do thou, since thou hast been extolled, hurl down my enemies by thy great might!<br> 2. The evil dream which is offensive to my mind and eye, which harasses and does not please me, that (dream) do I let loose upon my enemy. Having praised K&acirc;ma may I prevail!<br> 3,. Evil dreams, O K&acirc;ma, and misfortune, O K&acirc;ma, childlessness, ill-health, and trouble, do thou, a strong lord, let loose upon him that designs evil against us!<br> 4. Drive them away, O K&acirc;ma, thrust them away, O K&acirc;ma; may they that are my enemies fall into trouble! When they have been driven into the nethermost darkness, do thou, O Agni, burn up their d welling- places!<br> 5. That milch-cow, O K&acirc;ma, whom the sages call V&acirc;k Vir&acirc;g (ruling, or resplendent speech), is said to be thy daughter; by her drive away my enemies; breath, cattle, and life shall give them a wide birth!<br> 6. With the strength of K&acirc;ma, Indra, king Varuna, and Vishnu, with the impelling force (savena) of Savitar, with the priestly power of Agni, do I drive forth the enemies, as a skilled steersman a boat.<br> 7. My sturdy guardian, strong K&acirc;ma, shall procure for me full freedom from enmity! May the gods collectively be my refuge, may all the gods respond to this, my invocation!<br> 8. Taking pleasure in this (sacrificial) melted butter, and ghee do ye, (O gods), of whom K&acirc;ma is the highest, be joyful in this place, procuring for me full freedom from enmity!<br> 9. O Indra and Agni, and K&acirc;ma, having formed an alliance, do ye hurl down my enemies; when they have fallen into the nethermost darkness, do thou, O Agni, burn up after them their dwelling places!<br> 10. Slay thou, O K&acirc;ma, those that are my enemies, hurl them down into blind darkness. Devoid of vigour, Without sap let them all be; they shall not live a single day!<br> 11. K&acirc;ma has slain those that are my enemies, a broad space has he furnished me to thrive in. May the four directions of space bow down to me, and the six broad (regions) carry ghee to me!<br> 12. They (the enemies) shall float down like a boat cut loose from its moorings! There is no returning again for those who have been struck by our missiles.<br> 13. Agni is a defence, Indra a defence, Soma a defence. May the gods, who by their defence ward off (the enemy), ward him off!<br> 14. With his men reduced, driven out, the hated (enemy) shall go, shunned by his own friends! And down upon the earth do the lightnings alight; may the strong god crush your enemies!<br> 15. This mighty lightning supports both moveable and immoveable things, as well as all thunders. May the rising sun by his resources and his majesty hurl down my enemies, lie the mighty one!<br> 16. With that triple-armoured powerful covering of thine, O K&acirc;ma, with the charm that has been made into an Invulnerate armour spread (over thee), with that do thou drive away those who are my enemies; may breath, cattle, and life give them a wide berth!<br> 17. With the weapon with which the god drove forth the Asuras, with which Indra led the Dasyus to the nethermost darkness, with that do thou, O K&acirc;ma, drive forth far away from this world those who are my enemies!<br> 18. As the gods drove forth the Asuras, as Indra. forced the demons into the nethermost darkness, thus do thou, O K&acirc;ma, drive forth far away from this world those who are my enemies!<br> 19. K&acirc;ma was born at first; him neither the gods, nor the Fathers, nor men have equalled. To these art thou superior, and ever great; to thee, O K&acirc;ma, do I verily offer reverence.<br> 20. As great as are the heavens and earth in extent, as far as the waters have swept, as far as fire; to these art thou superior, &amp;c.<br> 21. Great as are the directions (of space) and the intermediate direction on either side, great as are the regions and the vistas of the sky; to these art thou superior, &amp;c.<br> 22. As many bees, bats, kur&ucirc;ru-worms, as many vaghas and tree-serpents as there are; to these art thou superior, &amp;c.<br> 23. Superior art thou to all that winks (lives), superior to all that stands still (is not alive), superior to the ocean art thou, O K&acirc;ma, Manyu! To these art thou superior, &amp;c.<br> 24. Not, surely, does the wind equal K&acirc;ma, not the fire, not the sun, and not the moon. To these art thou superior, &amp;c.<br> 25. With those auspicious and gracious forms of thine, O K&acirc;ma, through which what thou wilst becometh reaL with these do thou enter into us, and elsewhere send the evil thoughts!</p>
