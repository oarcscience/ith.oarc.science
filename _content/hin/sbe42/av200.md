## V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.

1\. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching the
heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the Sriñgaya
Vaitahavyas.  
2. The persons who pierced Brihatsâman, the descendant of Angiras, the
Brâhmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their
offspring.  
3. They who spat upon the Brâhmana, who desired tribute from him, they
sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.  
4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches does she
destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born (there).  
5. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, when eaten,
is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a crime
against the Fathers.  
6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the
Brâhmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the Brâhmana is
oppressed.  
7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed,
two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor of the
Brahman.  
8. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship; misfortune
strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a Brâhmana.  
9. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our shade,'
him who covets the wealth that belongs to a Brâhmana, O Nârada!  
10. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by the gods: no
one who has devoured the cow of a Brâhmana retains the charge of a
kingdom.  
11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, because they
had injured the offspring of a Brâhmana, were ruined irretrievably.  
12. The kûdî-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of
death), which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O oppressor of
Brahmans, the gods did declare (to be) thy couch.  
13. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed
(Brahman), as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of Brahmans, the
gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.  
14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they moisten
his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign
to thee as thy share of water.  
15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor of
Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not guide his
friend according to his will.
