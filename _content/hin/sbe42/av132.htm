</p>  <h2 align="center">I, 18. Charm to remove evil bodily characteristics from a woman.</h2>  
<p>1. The (foul) mark, the lal&acirc;m&icirc; (with spot on the forehead), the Ar&acirc;ti (grudging demon), do we drive out. Then the (signs) that are auspicious (shall remain) with us; (yet) to beget offspring do we bring the Ar&acirc;ti!<br> 2. May Savitar drive out uncouthness from her feet, may Varuna, Mitra, and Aryaman (drive it) out from her hands; may Anumati kindly drive it out for us! For happiness the gods have created this woman.<br> 3. The fierceness that is in thyself, in thy body, or in thy look, all that do we strike away with our charm. May god Savitar prosper thee!<br> 4. The goat-footed, the bull-toothed, her who scares the cattle, the snorting one, the vil&icirc;dh&icirc; (the driveling one), the lal&acirc;m&icirc; (with spot on the forehead), these do we drive from us.</p>
