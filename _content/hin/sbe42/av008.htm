</p>  <h2 align="center">I, 12. Prayer to lightning, conceived as the cause of fever, headache, and cough.</h2>  
<p>1. The first red bull, born of the (cloud-)womb, born of wind and clouds, comes on thundering with rain. May he, that cleaving moves straight on, spare our bodies; he who, a single force, has passed through threefold!<br> 2. Bowing down to thee that fastenest thyself with heat upon every limb, we would reverence thee with oblations; we would reverence with oblations the crooks and hooks of thee that hast, as a seizer, seized the limbs of this person.<br> 3. Free him from headache and also from cough, (produced by the lightning) that has entered his every joint! May the flashing (lightning), that is born of the cloud, and born of the wind, strike the trees and the mountains!<br> 4. Comfort be to my upper limb, comfort be to my nether; comfort be to my four members, comfort to my entire body!</p>
