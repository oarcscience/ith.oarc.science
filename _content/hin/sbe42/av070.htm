</p>  <h2 align="center">VII, 53. Prayer for long life.</h2>  
<p>1. When, O Brihaspati, thou didst liberate (us) from existence in yonder world of Yama, (and) from hostile schemes, then did the Asvins, the physicians of the gods, with might sweep death from us, O Agni!<br> 2. O in-breathing and out-breathing, go along with the body, do not leave it: may they be thy allies here! Live and thrive a hundred autumns; Agni shall be thy most excellent shepherd and overseer!<br> 3. Thy vital force that has been dissipated afar, thy in-breathing and thy out-breathing, shall come back again! Agni has snatched them from the lap of Nirriti (the goddess of destruction), and I again introduce them into thy person.<br> 4. Let not his in-breathing desert him, nor his out-breathing quit him and depart! I commit him to the Seven Rishis: may they convey him in health to old age!<br> 5. Enter, O in-breathing and out-breathing, like two bulls into a stable: this person shall here flourish, an unmolested repository for old age!<br> 6. Life's breath we do drive into thee, disease we do drive away from thee. May this excellent Agni endow us with life from every source!<br> 7. Ascending from the darkness of death to the highest firmament, to S&ucirc;rya (the sun), the god among gods, we have reached the highest light.</p>
