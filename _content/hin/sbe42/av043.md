## VII, 56. Charm against the poison of serpents, scorpions, and insects.

1\. The poison infused by the serpent that is striped across, by the
black serpent, and by the adder; that poison of the kankaparvan ('with
limbs like a comb,' scorpion) this plant has driven out.  
2. This herb, born of honey, dripping honey, sweet as honey, honied, is
the remedy for injuries; moreover it crushes insects.  
3. Wherever thou hast been bitten, wherever thou hast been sucked, from
there do we exorcise for thee the poison of the small, greedily biting
insect, (so that it be) devoid of strength.  
4. Thou (serpent) here, crooked, without joints, and without limbs, that
twisteth thy crooked jawsmayest thou, O Brihaspati, straighten them out,
as  
a (bent) reed!  
5. The poison of the sarkota (scorpion) that creeps low upon the ground,
(after he) has been deprived of his strength, I have taken away;
moreover I have caused him to be crushed.  
6. There is no strength in thy arms, in thy head, nor in the middle (of
thy body). Then why dost thou so wickedly carry a small (sting) in thy
tail?  
7. The ants devour thee, pea-hens hack thee to pieces. Yea, every one of
you shall declare the poison of the sarkota powerless!  
8. Thou (scorpion) that strikest with both, with mouth as well as tail,
in thy mouth there is no poison: then what can there be in the
receptacle in thy tail?
