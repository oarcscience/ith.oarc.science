</p>  <h2 align="center">V, 19. Imprecation against the oppressors of Brahmans.</h2>  
<p>1. Beyond measure they waxed strong, just fell short of touching the heavens. When they infringed upon Bhrigu they perished, the Sri&ntilde;gaya Vaitahavyas.<br> 2. The persons who pierced Brihats&acirc;man, the descendant of Angiras, the Br&acirc;hmana--a ram with two rows of teeth, a sheep devoured their offspring.<br> 3. They who spat upon the Br&acirc;hmana, who desired tribute from him, they sit in the middle of a pool of blood, chewing hair.<br> 4. The cow of the Brahman, when roasted, as far as she reaches does she destroy the lustre of the kingdom; no lusty hero is born (there).<br> 5. A cruel (sacrilegious) deed is her slaughter, her meat, when eaten, is sapless; when her milk is drunk, that surely is accounted a crime against the Fathers.<br> 6. When the king, weening himself mighty, desires to destroy the Br&acirc;hmana, then royal power is dissipated, where the Br&acirc;hmana is oppressed.<br> 7. Becoming eight-footed, four-eyed, four-eared, four-jawed, two-mouthed, two-tongued, she dispels the rule of the oppressor of the Brahman.<br> 8. That (kingdom) surely she swamps, as water a leaking ship; misfortune strikes that kingdom, in which they injure a Br&acirc;hmana.<br> 9. The trees chase away with the words: 'do not come within our shade,' him who covets the wealth that belongs to a Br&acirc;hmana, O N&acirc;rada!<br> 10. King Varuna pronounced this (to be) poison, prepared by the gods: no one who has devoured the cow of a Br&acirc;hmana retains the charge of a kingdom.<br> 11. Those full nine and ninety whom the earth did cast off, because they had injured the offspring of a Br&acirc;hmana, were ruined irretrievably.<br> 12. The k&ucirc;d&icirc;-plant (Christ's thorn) that wipes away the track (of death), which they fasten to the dead, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did declare (to be) thy couch.<br> 13. The tears which have rolled from (the eyes of) the oppressed (Brahman), as he laments, these very ones, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br> 14. The water with which they bathe the dead, with which they moisten his beard, that very one, O oppressor of Brahmans, the gods did assign to thee as thy share of water.<br> 15. The rain of Mitra and Varuna does not moisten the oppressor of Brahmans; the assembly is not complacent for him, he does not guide his friend according to his will.</p>
