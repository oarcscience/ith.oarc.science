## VI, 11. Charm for obtaining a son (pumsavanam).

1\. The asvattha (ficus religiosa) has mounted the samî (mimosa suma):
then a male child was produced. That, forsooth, is the way to obtain a
son; that do we bring to (our) wives.  
2. In the male, forsooth, seed doth grow, that is poured into the
female. That, forsooth, is the way to obtain a son; that has been told
by Pragâpati.  
3. Pragâpati, Anumati, and Sinîvâlî have fashioned him. May he
(Pragâpati) elsewhere afford the birth of a female, but here he shall
bestow a man!
