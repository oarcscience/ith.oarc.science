</p>  <h2 align="center">VI, 32. Charm for driving away demons (Rakshas and Pis&acirc;kas).</h2>  
<p>1. Do ye well offer within the fire this oblation with ghee, that destroys the spook! Do thou, O Agni, burn from afar against the Rakshas, (but) our houses thou shalt not consume!<br> 2. Rudra has broken your necks, ye Pis&acirc;kas: may he also break your ribs, ye spooks! The plant whose power is everywhere has united you with Yama (death).<br> 3. Exempt from danger, O Mitra and Varuna, may we here be; drive back with your flames the devouring demons (Atrin)! Neither aider, nor support do they find; smiting one another they go to death.</p>
