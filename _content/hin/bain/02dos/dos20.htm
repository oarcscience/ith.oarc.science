And they looked at one another, dazed and bewildered, for they thought that they had awoken from a dream.

And perceiving all, by the power of his mystical intuition, he said to himself: There are those two foolish lovers rejoicing to have awoken from a dream; not knowing that it was but a dream within a dream, and that they are still asleep.
