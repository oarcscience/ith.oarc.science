<p>If all great men were good and all good men would write a book, this world would be made better by their activities.</p>  
<p>Rishi Gherwal's books are observation of nature and nature is God's "Master-piece". They are historical records of true facts of the Hindu books on philosophy, and are like a visit to that old ancient Temple of Mathra.</p>  
<p>His manner of teaching and writing inspires us with the knowledge of ourselves, to be the same as the Universal Brotherhood&#8212;, Self of the Universe, with God's poise and sense of mastery.</p>  
<p>His books give us the blessed assurance that</p>  
<p>we no longer need to travel to get wisdom. Study TRUTH and absorb its teachings, and the world will come to you, as it has to him.</p>  
<p>May Peace be Unto him, together with a benediction of love, with our blessings.</p>
