This is a translation of the Laghu Yoga Vashishta, traditionally written
by the sage Vasistha, one of the teachers of Rama. This is the 'shorter'
Yoga Vashishta. This is not an academic or critical translation, but it
may appeal to the casual reader. The author of this book, Singh Gherwal,
may have been a westerner with a Hindu pseudonym. He states that he is a
teacher of Kundalini Yoga. Gherwal wrote a number of popularized books
on this and related topics.

Another public domain translation, that of K. Narayanaswami Aiyar
\[1896\], is in preparation and will be posted at this site at a later
date.

<span class="small">Production Notes: This was a self-published book,
and it has a number of typographical errors which I corrected [in the
usual way](errata), including a couple of Hindu technical terms which I
was able to track down using Wikipedia. There were also a number of
punctuation errors, mostly quotation marks, which I corrected
silently.--J.B. Hare, September 7, 2008.</span>
