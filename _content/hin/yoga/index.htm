<H4>Yogi Publication Society</H4>
<p>These are the Yogi Publication Society books specifically themed around Yoga, authored by William Atkinson under a variety of pseudonyms. There were many others published by the YPS, some of which can be found on the <A HREF="../../eso/index">Esoteric Page</A>. This is because they reflect Western Esoteric beliefs, rather than Hinduism, or Yogic knowledge.</P>
