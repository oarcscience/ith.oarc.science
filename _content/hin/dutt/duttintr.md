# A NOTE ON THE LATE ROMESH C. DUTT

ROMESH CHUNDER DUTT, to whom English readers are indebted for the
condensed metrical version of the ancient Indian epics given in this
volume, was one of the most distinguished sons of modern India. He came
of a Hindu family standing high among the Kayasths, second of the great
castes in Bengal, was born in 1848, and grew to manhood amid influences
of deep spiritual disturbance. In those days an Indian youth who had
felt the call of the West encountered the sternest opposition from both
his own family and the community, if hie avowed his ambition of making
the voyage to Europe. Rornesh Dutt, having passed through the Presidency
College, Calcutta, took his fate into his own hands. Accompanied by two
friends, both of whom after wards rose to eminence in Bengal, he
secretly took ship, came to London, entered for the Indian Civil
Service, and took third place in the open examination of 1869. He was
the first of his race to attain the rank of divisional commissioner, and
long before his retirement in 1897, at the end of twenty-five years'
service, had made a high reputation as an administrator. He sat for a
time in the Bengal Legislative Council, and, in recognition of his
official work, received the Companionship of the Indian Empire. He died
on November 30, 1909, at Baroda, the capital of the important Native
State which he had served with brilliant success as revenue minister and
dewan.

The influences which determined his literary activity were primarily
European. As a student in Calcutta he had made acquaintance with the
English classics, and later, while at University College, had read the
poets insatiably. Nevertheless his first successes were achieved in his
mother tongue. He wrote in Bengali poems and plays, historical and
social novels, and aroused a storm of protest within the orthodox
community of his Province by publishing a Bengali translation of the Rig
Veda. In English, of which he had complete mastery, his first complete
essay was a history of civilisation in Ancient India, which, though not
a work of original research, fulfilled a useful purpose in its day. When
freedom from Government service gave him the opportunity he set himself
to writing the *Economic History of India* and *India in the Victorian
Age*, the two together forming, his chief contribution to the subject
which he, more than any other Indian of his time, had made his own. In
these books, as in others of kindred theme and purpose, there is much
criticism of British administration, strongly felt if temperately
expressed. Apart from this, its more controversial side, the work of
Romesh Dutt is valuable mainly in that it has helped to reveal to his
own people no less than to ours, the spiritual riches of ancient India.
