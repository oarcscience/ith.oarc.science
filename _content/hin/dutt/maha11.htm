<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">I</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">KURU WOMEN VISIT THE BATTLE-FIELD</H2>
<P>Spake the ancient Dhrita-rashtra, father of a hundred sons,<BR>
Sonless now and sorrow-stricken, dark his ebbing life-tide runs:</P>
<P>"Gods fulfil my life's last wishes! Henchmen, yoke my royal car,<BR>
Dhrita-rashtra meets his princes in the silent field of war,</P>
<P>Speed unto the Queen Gandhari, to the dames of Kuru's house,<BR>
To each dear departed warrior wends his fair and faithful spouse!"</P>
<P>Queen Gandhari sorrow-laden with the ancient Pritha came,<BR>
And each weeping widowed princess and each wailing childless dame,</P>
<P>And they saw the hoary monarch, father of a perished race,<BR>
Fresh and loud awoke their sorrow, welling tears suffused their face,</P>
<P>Good Vidura ever gentle whispered comfort unto all,<BR>
Placed the dames within their chariots, left Hastina's palace hall!</P>
<P>Loud the wail of woe and sorrow rose from every Kuru house,<BR>
Children wept beside their mothers for each widowed royal spouse,</P>
<P>Veil&eacute;d dwellers of the palace, scarce the gods their face had seen,<BR>
Heedless now through mart and city sped each widowed childless queen,</P>
<P>From their royal brow and bosom gem and jewel cast aside,<BR>
Loose their robes and loose their tresses, quenched their haughty queenly pride!</P>
<P>So when falls the antlered monarch, struck by woe and sudden fear<BR>
Issuing from their snowy mountains listless stray the dappled deer,</P>
<P>So when smit by sudden panic, milk-white mares that scour the plain,<BR>
Wildly toss their flowing tresses, shake their soft and glossy mane!</P>
<P>Clinging to her weeping sister wept each dame in cureless pain,<BR>
For the lord the son or father in the deathful battle slain,</P>
<P>Wept and smote her throbbing bosom and in bitter anguish wailed,<BR>
Till her senses reeled in sorrow, till her woman's reason failed!</P>
<P>Veil&eacute;d queens and bashful maidens, erst they shunned the public eye,<BR>
Blush nor shame suffused their faces as they passed the city by,</P>
<P>Gentle-bosomed, kindly hearted, erst they wiped each other's tear,<BR>
Now by common sorrow laden knew no sister's words of cheer!</P>
<P>With this troop of wailing women, deep in woe, disconsolate,<BR>
Slow the monarch of the Kurus passed Hastina's outer gate,</P>
<P>Men from stall and loom and anvil, men of every guild and trade,<BR>
Left the city with the monarch, through the open country strayed,</P>
<P>And a universal sorrow filled the air and answering sky,<BR>
As when ends the mortal's Yuga and the end of world is nigh!</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">II</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">GANDHARI'S LAMENT FOR THE SLAIN</H2>
<P>Stainless Queen and stainless woman, ever righteous ever good,<BR>
Stately in her mighty sorrow on the field Gandhari stood!</P>
<P>Strewn with skulls and clotted tresses, darkened by the stream of gore,<BR>
With the limbs of countless warriors is the red field covered o'er,</P>
<P>Elephants and steeds of battle, car-borne chiefs untimely slain,<BR>
Headless trunks and heads dissevered fill the red and ghastly plain,</P>
<P>And the long-drawn howl of jackals o'er the scene of carnage rings,<BR>
And the vulture and the raven flap their dark and loathsome wings,</P>
<P>Feasting on the blood of warriors foul <I>Pisachas</I> fill the air,<BR>
Viewless forms of hungry <I>Rakshas</I> limb from limb the corpses tear!</P>
<P>Through this scene of death and carnage was the ancient monarch led,<BR>
Kuru dames with faltering footsteps stepped amidst the countless dead,</P>
<P>And a piercing wail of anguish burst upon the echoing plain,<BR>
As they saw their sons or fathers, brothers, lords, amidst the slain,</P>
<P>As they saw the wolves of jungle feed upon the destined prey,<BR>
Darksome wanderers of the midnight prowling in the light of day!</P>
<P>Shriek of pain and wail of anguish o'er the ghastly field resound,<BR>
And their feeble footsteps falter and they sink upon the ground,</P>
<P>Sense and life desert the mourners as they faint in common grief,<BR>
Death-like swoon succeeding sorrow yields a moment's short relief!</P>
<P>Then a mighty sigh of anguish from Gandhari's bosom broke,<BR>
Gazing on her anguished daughters unto Krishna thus she spoke:</P>
<P>"Mark my unconsol&eacute;d daughters, widowed queens of Kuru's house,<BR>
Wailing for their dear departed, like the osprey for her spouse!</P>
<P>How each cold and fading feature wakes in them a woman's love,<BR>
How amidst the lifeless warriors still with restless steps they rove,</P>
<P>Mothers hug their slaughtered children all unconscious in their sleep,<BR>
Widows bend upon their husbands and in ceaseless sorrow weep,</P>
<P>Mighty Bhishma, hath he fallen, quenched is archer Karna's pride,<BR>
Doth the monarch of Panchala sleep by foeman Drona's side?</P>
<P>Shining mail and costly jewels, royal bangles strew the plain,<BR>
Golden garlands rich and burnished deck the chiefs untimely slain,</P>
<P>Lances hurled by stalwart fighters, clubs of mighty wrestlers killed<BR>
Swords and bows of ample measure, quivers still with arrows filled!</P>
<P>Mark the unforgotten heroes, jungle prowlers 'mid them stray,<BR>
On their brow and mail&eacute;d bosoms heedless perch the birds of prey,</P>
<P>Mark they great unconquered heroes famed on earth from west to east,<BR>
<I>Kankas</I> perch upon their foreheads, hungry wolves upon them feast!</P>
<P>Mark the kings, on softest cushion scarce the needed rest they found,<BR>
Now they lie in peaceful slumber on the hard and reddened ground,</P>
<P>Mark the youths who morn and evening listed to the minstrel's song,<BR>
In their ear the loathsome jackal doth his doleful wail prolong!</P>
<P>See the chieftains with their maces and their swords of trusty steel,<BR>
Still they grasp their tried weapons,--do they still the life-pulse feel?"</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">III</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">GANDHARI'S LAMENT FOR DURYODHAN</H2>
<P>Thus to Krishna, Queen Gandhari strove her woeful thoughts to tell,<BR>
When, alas, her wandering vision on her son Duryodhan fell,</P>
<P>Sudden anguish smote her bosom and her senses seemed to stray,<BR>
Like a tree by tempest shaken senseless on the earth she lay!</P>
<P>Once again she waked in sorrow, once again she cast her eye<BR>
Where her son in blood empurpled slept beneath the open sky,</P>
<P>And she clasped her dear Duryodhan, held him close unto her breast,<BR>
Sobs convulsive shook her bosom as the lifeless form she prest,</P>
<P>And her tears like rains of summer fell and washed his noble head,<BR>
Decked with garlands still untarnished, graced with <I>nishkas</I> bright and red!</P>
<P>"'Mother!' said my dear Duryodhan when he went unto the war,<BR>
'Wish me joy and wish me triumph as I mount the battle-car,'</P>
<P>'Son!' I said to dear Duryodhan, 'Heaven avert a cruel fate,<BR>
<I>Yato dharma stato jayah!</I> Triumph doth on Virtue wait!'</P>
<P>But he set his heart on battle, by his valour wiped his sins,<BR>
Now he dwells in realms celestial which the faithful warrior wins,</P>
<P>And I weep not for Duryodhan, like a prince he fought and fell,<BR>
But my sorrow-stricken husband, who can his misfortunes tell!</P>
<P>Ay! my son was brave and princely, all resistless in the war,<BR>
Now he sleeps the sleep of warriors, sunk in gloom his glorious star,</P>
<P>Ay! My son 'mid crown&eacute;d monarchs held the first and foremost way,<BR>
Now he rests upon the red earth, quenched his bright effulgent ray,</P>
<P>Ay! my son the best of heroes, he hath won the warrior's sky,<BR>
Kshatras nobly conquer, Krishna, when in war they nobly die!</P>
<P>Hark the loathsome cry of jackals, how the wolves their vigils keep,<BR>
Maidens rich in song and beauty erst were wont to watch his sleep,</P>
<P>Hark the foul and blood-beaked vultures flap their wings upon the dead,<BR>
Maidens waved their feathery <I>pankhas</I> round Duryodhan's royal bed,</P>
<P>Peerless bowman! mighty monarch! nations still his hests obeyed,<BR>
As a lion slays a tiger, Bhima hath Duryodhan slayed!</P>
<P>Thirteen years o'er Kuru's empire proud Duryodhan held his sway,<BR>
Ruled Hastina's ancient city where fair Ganga's waters stray,</P>
<P>I have seen his regal splendour with these ancient eyes of mine,<BR>
Elephants and battle-chariots, steeds of war and herds of kine,</P>
<P>Kuru owns another master and Duryodhan's day is fled,<BR>
And I five to be a witness! Krishna, O that I were dead!</P>
<P>Mark Duryodhan's noble widow, mother proud of Lakshman bold,<BR>
Queenly in her youth and beauty, like an altar of bright gold,</P>
<P>Torn from husband's sweet embraces, from her son's entwining arms,<BR>
Doomed to life-long woe and anguish in her youth and in her charms,</P>
<P>Rend my hard and stony bosom crushed beneath this cruel pain,<BR>
Should Gandhari live to witness noble son and grandson slain?</P>
<P>Mark again Duryodhan's widow, how she hugs his gory head,<BR>
How with gentle hands and tender softly holds him on his bed,</P>
<P>How from dear departed husband turns she to her dearer son,<BR>
And the tear-drops of the mother choke the widow's bitter groan,</P>
<P>Like the fibre of the lotus tender-golden is her frame,<BR>
O my lotus! O my daughter! Bharat's pride and Kuru's fame!</P>
<P>If the truth resides in Vedas, brave Duryodhan dwells above,<BR>
Wherefore linger we in sadness severed from his cherished love,</P>
<P>If the truth resides in <I>Sastra</I>, dwells in sky my hero son,<BR>
Wherefore linger we in sorrow since their earthly task is done?</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">IV</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">FUNERAL RITE</H2>
<P>Victor of a deathful battle, sad Yudhishthir viewed the plain,<BR>
Friends and kinsmen, kings and chieftains, countless troops untimely slain,</P>
<P>And he spake to wise Sudharman pious priest of Kuru's race,<BR>
Unto Sanjay, unto Dhaumya, to Vidura full of grace,</P>
<P>Spake unto the brave Yuyutsu, Kuru's last surviving chief,<BR>
Spake to faithful Indrasena, and to warriors sunk in grief:</P>
<P>"Pious rites are due to foemen and to friends and kinsmen slain,<BR>
None shall lack a fitting funeral, none shall perish on the plain."</P>
<P>Wise Vidura and his comrades sped on sacred duty bound,<BR>
Sandalwood and scented aloes, fragrant oil and perfumes found,</P>
<P>Silken robes of costly splendour, fabrics by the artist wove,<BR>
Dry wood from the thorny jungle, perfume from the scented grove,</P>
<P>Shattered cars and splintered lances, hewed and ready for the fire,<BR>
Piled and ranged in perfect order into many a funeral pyre.</P>
<P>Kings and princes, noble warriors, were in rank and order laid,<BR>
And with streams of fragrant <I>ghrita</I> were the rich libations made,</P>
<P>Blazed the fire with wondrous radiance by the rich libations fed,<BR>
Sanctifying and consuming mortal remnants of the dead.</P>
<P>Brave Duryodhan and his brothers, Salya of the mighty car,<BR>
Bhurisravas king of nations, Jayadratha famed in war,</P>
<P>Abhimanyu son of Arjun, Lakshman proud Duryodhan's son,<BR>
Somadatta and the Srinjays famed for deeds of valour done,</P>
<P>Matsya's monarch proud Virata, Drupad fair Panchala's king,<BR>
And his sons, Panchala's princes, whose great deeds the minstrels sing,</P>
<P>Cultured monarch of Kosala and Gandhara's wily lord,<BR>
Karna, proud and peerless archer, matchless with his flaming sword,</P>
<P>Bhagadatta eastern monarch all resistless in his car,<BR>
Ghatotkacha son of Bhima, Alambusha famed in war,</P>
<P>And a hundred other monarchs all received the pious rite,<BR>
Till the radiance of the fire-light chased the shadows of the night!</P>
<I><P>Pitri-medha</I>; due to fathers was performed with pious care,<BR>
Hymns and wails and lamentations mingled in the midnight air,</P>
<P>Sacred songs of <I>rik</I> and <I>saman</I> rose with women's piercing wail,<BR>
And the creatures of the wide earth heard the sound subdued and pale,</P>
<P>Smokeless and with radiant lustre shone each red and lighted pyre,<BR>
Like the planets of the bright sky throbbing with celestial fire!</P>
<P>Men in nations, countless, nameless, from each court and camp afar,<BR>
From the east and west collected, fell in Kuru-Kshetra's war,</P>
<P>Thousand fires for them were lighted, they received the pious rite,<BR>
Such was good Yudhishthir's mandate, such was wise Vidura's might,</P>
<P>All the dead were burned to ashes and the sacred rite was o'er,<BR>
Dhrita-rashtra and Yudhishthir slowly walked to Ganga's shore!</P>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">V</H2>
<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">OBLATION TO KARNA</H2>
<P>Sacred Ganga, ample-bosomed, sweeps along in regal pride,<BR>
Rolling down her limpid waters through high banks on either side,</P>
<P>Childless dames and weeping widows thither in their anguish came,<BR>
Due and holy rites to render to departed chiefs of fame,</P>
<P>Casting forth their jewelled girdles, gems and scarfs belaced with gold,<BR>
Gave oblations of the water unto warriors true and bold,</P>
<P>Unto fathers, unto husbands, unto sons in battle slayed,<BR>
Offerings of the sacred water sorrowing wives and mothers made.</P>
<P>And so great the host of mourners wending to perform the rite,<BR>
That their footsteps made a pathway in the sad and sacred site,</P>
<P>And the shelving banks of Ganga, peopled by the sorrowing train,<BR>
Wide-expanding, vast and sealike, formed a scene of woe and pain!</P>
<P>But a wave of keener sorrow swept o'er Pritha's heaving breast,<BR>
As unto her weeping children thus her secret she expressed:</P>
<I><P>"He, my sons, the peerless bowman, mighty in his battle-car,<BR>
Who by will of fate untimely was by Arjun slain in war,</P>
<P>He whom as the son of Radha, chariot-driver ye have thought,<BR>
But who shone with SURYA'S lustre as his countless foes he fought,</P>
<P>He who faced your stoutest warriors and in battle never failed,<BR>
Bravely led the Kuru forces and in danger never quailed,</P>
<P>He who knew no peer in prowess, owned in war no haughtier name,<BR>
Yielded life but not his honour and by death hath conquered fame,</P>
<P>He in truth who never faltered, never left his vow undone,<BR>
Offer unto him oblation, Karna was my eldest son!</P>
<P>Karna was your honoured elder and the Sun inspired his birth,<BR>
Karna in his rings and armour Sun-like trod the spacious earth!"</P>
</I><P>Pritha spake; the Pandav brothers groaned in penitence and pain,<BR>
And they wept in woe and anguish for the brother they had slain.</P>
<P>Hissing forth his sigh of anguish like a crushed and wounded snake,<BR>
Sad Yudhishthir to his mother thus his inward feelings spake:</P>
<P>Didst thou, mother, bear the hero fathomless like ocean dread,<BR>
Whose unfailing glistening arrows like its countless billows sped,</P>
<P>Didst thou bear that peerless archer all-resistless in his car,<BR>
Sweeping with the roar of ocean through the shattered ranks of war?</P>
<P>Didst thou hide the mighty warrior, mortal man of heavenly birth,<BR>
Crushing 'neath his arm of valour all his foemen on the earth,</P>
<P>Didst thou hide the birth and lineage of that chief of deathful ire,<BR>
As a man in folds of garments seeks to hide the flaming fire?</P>
<P>Arjun wielder of Gandiva was for us no truer stay<BR>
Than was Karna for the Kurus in the battle's dread array,</P>
<P>Monarchs matched not Karna's glory nor his deeds of valour done,<BR>
Midst the mighty car-borne warriors mightiest warrior Karna shone!</P>
<P>Woe to us! our eldest brother we have in the battle slain,<BR>
And our nearest dearest elder fell upon the gory plain,</P>
<P>Not the death of Abhimanyu from the fair Subhadra torn,<BR>
Not the slaughter of the princes by the proud Draupadi borne,</P>
<P>Not the fall of friends and kinsmen and Panchala's mighty host,<BR>
Like thy death afflicts my bosom, noble Karna loved and lost!</P>
<P>Monarch's empire, victor's glory, all the treasures earth can yield,<BR>
Righteous bliss and heavenly gladness, harvest of the heavenly field,</P>
<P>All that wish can shape and utter, all that nourish hope and pride,<BR>
All were ours, O noble Karna, hadst thou rested by our side,</P>
<P>And this carnage of the Kurus these sad eyes had never seen,<BR>
Peace had graced our blessed empire, happy would the earth have been!"</P>
<P>Long bewailed the sad Yudhishthir for his elder loved and dead,<BR>
And oblation of the water to the noble Karna made,</P>
<P>And the royal dames of Kuru viewed the sight with freshening pain,<BR>
Wept to see the good Yudhishthir offering to his brother slain,</P>
<P>And the widowed queen of Karna with the women of his house<BR>
Gave oblations to her hero, wept her loved and slaughtered spouse!</P>
<P>Done the rites to the, departed, done oblations to the dead,<BR>
Slowly then the sad survivors on the river's margin spread,</P>
<P>Far along the shore and sandbank of the sacred sealike stream<BR>
Maid and matron lave their bodies 'neath the morning's holy beam,</P>
<P>And ablutions done, the Kurus slow and sad and cheerless part,<BR>
Wend their way to far Hastina with a void and vacant heart.</P>
