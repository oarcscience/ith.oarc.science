<P>20. On account of connexion, thus elsewhere also.</P>
<P>In the B<I>ri</I>had-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka (V, 5) it is said that Brahman is to be meditated upon as abiding within the orb of the sun and within the right eye; and then the text mentions two secret names of Brahman--<I>aham</I> and <I>ahar</I>. Here the P&ucirc;rvapakshin holds that both these names are to be comprehended in each of the two meditations 'On account of connexion,' i.e. on account of the object of meditation, i.e. Brahman being one only, although connected with different abodes, it is 'thus elsewhere also,' i.e. the same conclusion which had been arrived at in the case of the <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>nd</I>ilya-vidy&acirc;s, has to be accepted with regard to Brahman abiding in the sun and in the eye. The meditation is one only, and hence the two secret names apply to Brahman in both its abodes.--This view the next S&ucirc;tra negatives.</P>
