<P>11. Bliss and other qualities, as belonging to the subject of the qualities.</P>
<P>The point to be decided here is whether, or not, the essential qualities of Brahman are to be included in all meditations on the highest Brahman.--Since there is no valid reason for including in a meditation those qualities which are not expressly mentioned in the section containing that meditation, only those qualities which are thus expressly mentioned should be included!--This prim&acirc; facie view is negatived by the S&ucirc;tra. The clause, 'on account of non-difference,' has to be carried on from the preceding S&ucirc;tra. As the 'subject of the qualities,' i.e. Brahman is the same in all meditations, the qualities which do not exist apart from their subject, viz. bliss, and so on, are to be comprised in all meditations.--But for the same reason then such qualities as 'having joy for its head' (Taitt. Up. II, 5) would also have to be included in all meditations on Brahman!--This the next S&ucirc;tra negatives.</P>
