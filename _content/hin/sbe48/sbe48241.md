38\. If you say, as in the case of the organs; we deny this, on account
of enjoyment and so on.

It may possibly be said that, in the same way as the enjoying
(individual) soul, although in itself without a body, is seen to rule
the sense-organs, the body, and so on, the great Lord also, although
without a body, may rule the Pradhâna. But this analogy cannot be
allowed 'on account of enjoyment,' and so on. The body's being ruled by
the soul is due to the unseen principle in the form of good and evil
works, and has for its end the requital of those works. Your analogy
would thus imply that the Lord also is under the influence of an unseen
principle, and is requited for his good and evil works.--The Lord cannot
therefore be a ruler.
