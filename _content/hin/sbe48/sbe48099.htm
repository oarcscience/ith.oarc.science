<P>33. Moreover, they record him in that.</P>
<P>They (i.e. the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyins) speak of him, viz. Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara who has heaven for his head, &amp;c.--i.e. the highest Self--as within that, i.e. the body of the devotee, so as to form the abode of the oblation to Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a; viz. in the text,'Of that Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara Self the head is Sute<I>g</I>as,' and so on. The context is as follows. The clause 'He who meditates on the Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara Self as pr&acirc;de<I>s</I>am&acirc;tra,' &amp;c. enjoins meditation on the highest Self having the three worlds for its body, i.e. on Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara. The following clause 'he eats food in all worlds' teaches that the attaining of Brahman is the reward of such meditation. And then the text proceeds to teach the Agnihotra offered to Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, which is something subsidiary to the meditation taught. The text here establishes an identity between the members--fire, sun, &amp;c.--of the Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara enjoined as object of meditation (which members</P>

<P>are called Sute<I>g</I>as, Vi<I>s</I>var&ucirc;pa, &amp;c.), and parts--viz. head, eye, breath, trunk, bladder, feet--of the worshipper's body. 'The head is Sute<I>g</I>as'--that means: the head of the devotee is (identical with) heaven, which is the head of the highest Self; and so on up to 'the feet,' i.e. the feet of the devotee are identical with the earth, which constitutes the feet of the highest Self, The devotee having thus reflected on the highest Self, which has the three worlds for its body, as present within his own body, thereupon is told to view his own chest, hair, heart, mind and mouth as identical with the altar, grass and the other things which are required for the Agnihotra; further to identify the oblation to Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a with the Agnihotra, and by means of this Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a-agnihotra to win the favour of Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara, i.e. the highest Self. The final--conclusion then remains that Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara is none other than the highest Self, the supreme Person.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara.'</P>
