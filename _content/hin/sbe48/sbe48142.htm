<P>44. And on account of such words as Lord.</P>
<P>That embracing highest Self is further on designated by terms such as Lord, and so on. 'He is the Lord of all, the master of all, the ruler of all. He does not become greater by good works, nor smaller by evil works. He is the lord of all, the king of beings, the protector of beings. He is a bank and a boundary so that these worlds may not be confounded. Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as seek to know him by the study of the Veda. He who knows him becomes a Muni.

<P>the ether evolving forms and names is something different from the released individual soul. The declarations of general Unity which we meet with in the texts rest thereon, that all sentient and non-sentient beings are effects of Brahman, and hence have Brahman for their inner Self. That this is the meaning of texts such as 'All this is Brahman,' &amp;c., we have explained before. And the texts denying plurality are to be understood in the same way.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the designation of something different, and so on.'</P>
