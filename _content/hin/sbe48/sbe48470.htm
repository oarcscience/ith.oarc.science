<P>23. Should it be said that (the stories told in the Upanishads) are for the purpose of the P&acirc;riplava; not so, since (certain stories) are specified.</P>
<P>We meet in the Ved&acirc;nta-texts with certain stories such as 'Pratardana the son of Divod&acirc;sa came to the beloved abode of Indra,' &amp;c., and similar ones. The question here arises whether the stories are merely meant to be recited at the A<I>s</I>vamedha sacrifice or to convey knowledge of a special kind.--The P&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that as the text' they tell the stories' declares the special connexion of those stories with the so-called p&acirc;riplava performance,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_698"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 698</FONT></A></P>
<P>they cannot be assumed to be mainly concerned with knowledge.--This view the S&ucirc;tra negatives, on the ground that not all stories of that kind are specially connected with the p&acirc;riplava. The texts rather single out special stories only as suitable for that performance; on the general injunction quoted above there follows an injunction defining <I>which</I> stories are to be told, 'King Manu, the son of Vivasvat,' &amp;c. The stories told in the Ved&acirc;nta-texts do not therefore form parts of the p&acirc;riplava performance, but are connected with injunctions of meditations.</P>
