<P>2. And on account of its being declared that to which the released have to resort.</P>
<P>The Person who is the abode of heaven, earth, and so</P>

<P>on, is also declared by the text to be what is to be reached by those who are released from the bondage of Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra existence. 'When the seer sees the brilliant maker and Lord as the Person who has his source in Brahman, then possessing true knowledge he shakes off good and evil, and, free from passion, reaches the highest oneness' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 3). 'As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their name and form, thus a wise man freed from name and form goes to the divine Person who is higher than the high' (III, 2, 8). For it is only those freed from the bondage of Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra who shake off good and evil, are free from passion, and freed from name and form.</P>
<P>For the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra state consists in the possession of name and form, which is due to connexion with non-sentient matter, such connexion springing from good and evil works. The Person therefore who is the abode of heaven, earth, &amp;c., and whom the text declares to be the aim to be reached by those who, having freed themselves from good and evil, and hence from all contact with matter, attain supreme oneness with the highest Brahman, can be none other than this highest Brahman itself.</P>
<P>This conclusion, based on terms exclusively applicable to the highest Brahman, is now confirmed by reference to the absence of terms specially applicable to the individual soul.</P>
