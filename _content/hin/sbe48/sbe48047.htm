<P>14. If, on account of its being a word denoting an effect, (&acirc;nandamaya be said) not (to denote the highest Self); (we say) no, on account of abundance.</P>
<P>We deny the conclusion of the P&ucirc;rvapakshin, on the ground of there being abundance of bliss in the highest Brahman, and 'abundance' being one of the possible meanings of -maya.--Since bliss such as described in the Taitt. Up.--bliss which is reached by successively multiplying by hundred all inferior kinds of bliss--cannot belong to the individual soul, we conclude that it belongs to Brahman; and as Brahman cannot be an effect, and as -maya. may have the sense of 'abounding in,' we conclude that the &acirc;nandamaya is Brahman itself; inner contradiction obliging us to set aside that sense of -maya which is recommended by regard to 'consequence' and frequency of usage. The regard for consistency, moreover, already has to be set aside in the case of the 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>amaya'; for in that term -maya</P>
<P><A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A></P>
<P>cannot denote 'made of.' The 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>amaya' Self can only be called by that name in so far as air with its five modifications has (among others) the modification called pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, i.e. breathing out, or because among the five modifications or functions of air pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a is the 'abounding,' i.e. prevailing one.--Nor can it be truly said that -maya is but rarely used in the sense of 'abounding in': expressions such as 'a sacrifice abounding in food' (annamaya), 'a procession with many carriages' (<I>s</I>aka<I>t</I>amay&icirc;), are by no means uncommon.--Nor can we admit that to call something 'abounding in bliss' implies the presence of <I>some</I> pain. For 'abundance' precludes paucity on the part of that which is said to abound, but does not imply the presence of what is contrary. The presence or absence of what is contrary has to be ascertained by other means of proof; and in our case we do ascertain the absence of what is contrary to bliss by such means, viz. the clause 'free from evil,' &amp;c. Abundance of bliss on the part of Brahman certainly implies a relation to paucity on the part of some other bliss; and in accordance with this demand the text says 'That is one measure of human bliss,' &amp;c. (II, 8, 1). The bliss of Brahman is of measureless abundance, compared to the bliss of the individual soul.--Nor can it be maintained that the individual soul may be viewed as being an effect of bliss. For that a soul whose essential nature is knowledge and bliss should in any way be changed into something else, as a lump of clay is made into a pot, is an assumption contradicted by all scripture, sacred tradition, and reasoning. That in the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra state the soul's bliss and knowledge are contracted owing to karman will be shown later on.--The Self of bliss therefore is other than the individual soul; it is Brahman itself.</P>
<P>A further reason for this conclusion is supplied by the next S&ucirc;tra.</P>
