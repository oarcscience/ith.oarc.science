<P>4. There may be (a double sense) of the one (word), as in the case of the word 'Brahman.'</P>
<P>Since in the clause 'from that Self there sprang Brahman,' the word 'sprang' cannot be taken in its literal senbe, it may be used there in a secondary sense; while the same word as connected with the subsequent clauses 'from V&acirc;yu Agni,' &amp;c., may have its primary sense. This would be analogous to the use of the word Brahman in Mu. Up. I, 1. There in the clause 'From him is born that Brahman, name, form, and matter' (9). the word <I>Brahman</I> is used in a secondary sense, i.e. denotes the Pradh&acirc;na; while in the same chapter, in the clause 'Brahman swells by means of brooding' (8), the same word denotes Brahman in its primary sense. It is true indeed that in this latter case the. word 'Brahman' occurs twice; while in the Taitt. text the word 'sambh&ucirc;ta' occurs once only, and has to be carried</P>

<P>over from the first clause into the subsequent ones; but this makes no difference, for, in the case of such carrying over of a word, no less than in the case of actual repetition, the general denotation of the word is repeated.--The next S&ucirc;tra refutes this objection.</P>
