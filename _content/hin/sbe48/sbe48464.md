17\. And of him who is chaste; for in Scripture (this is declared).

The knowledge of Brahman belongs to those who have to observe chastity,
and men living in that state have not to perform the Agnihotra, the
Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa, and similar works. For this reason also knowledge
cannot be subsidiary to works.--But, it may be objected, there is no
such condition of life; for texts such as 'he is to perform the
Agnihotra as long as he lives,' declare men to be obliged to perform
sacrifices and the like up to the end of their lives, and Sm*ri*ti texts
contradicting Scripture have no authority.--To meet this the Sûtra adds
'for in Scripture.' The three stages of life are recognised in Scripture
only; cp. texts such as 'Those who in the forest practise penance and
faith' (*Kh*. Up. V, 10, 1); 'Wishing for that

world only mendicants wander forth from their homes' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4,
22). The text as to the lifelong obligatoriness of the Agnihotra is
valid for those only who do not retire from worldly life.
