32\. On account of imaginative identification, thus *G*aimini thinks;
for thus the text declares.

The teacher *G*aimini is of opinion that the altar is stated to be the
chest of Vai*s*vânara, and so on, in order to effect an imaginative
identification of the offering to Prâ*n*a which is daily performed by
the meditating devotees and is the means of pleasing Vai*s*vânara,
having the heaven and so on for his body, i.e. the highest Self, with
the Agnihotra-offering. For the fruit due to meditation on the highest
Self, as well as the identity of the offering to breath with the
Agnihotra, is declared in the following text, 'He who without knowing
this offers the Agnihotra--that would be as if removing the live coals
he were to pour his libation on dead ashes. But he who offers this
Agnihotra with a full knowledge of its purport, he offers it in all
worlds, in all beings, in all Selfs. As the fibres of the Ishîkâ reed
when thrown into the fire are burnt, thus all his sins are burnt.' (V,
24, 1-3.)
