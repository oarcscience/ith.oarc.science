<P>5. Should it be said, on account of absence of mention in the first (reply); we say no, for just that (is meant), on the ground of fitness.</P>
<P>An objection is raised to the conclusion arrived at under III, 1, 1; on the ground that in the first oblation, described in <I>Kh</I>. Up. V, 4, 2, as being made into the heavenly world, water is not mentioned at all as the thing offered. The text says, 'on that altar the gods offer <I>s</I>raddh&acirc;'; and by <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; (belief) everybody understands a certain activity of mind. Water therefore is not the thing offered.--Not so, we reply. It is nothing else but water, which there is called <I>s</I>raddh&acirc;. For thus only question and answer have a sense. For the question is, 'Do you know why in the fifth libation water is called man?' and at the outset of the reply <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; is mentioned as constituting the oblation made into the heavenly world viewed as a fire. If here the word <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; did not denote water, question and answer would refer to different topics, and there would be no connexion. The form in which the final statement is introduced (iti tu pa<I>&ntilde;k</I>amy&acirc;m, &amp;c., 'but thus in the fifth oblation,' &amp;c.), moreover, also intimates that <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; means water. The word 'iti,' <I>thus</I>, here intimates that the answer is meant to dispose of the question, 'Do you know <I>how</I>?' &amp;c. <I>S</I>raddh&acirc; becomes moon, rain, food, seed, embryo in succession, and <I>thus</I> the water comes to be called man. Moreover, the word <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; is actually used in the Veda in the sense of 'water'; 'he carries water, <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; indeed is water' (Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. I, 6, 8, 1). Aad what the text says as</P>

<P>to king Soma (the moon) originating from <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; when offered, also shows that <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; must mean water.</P>
