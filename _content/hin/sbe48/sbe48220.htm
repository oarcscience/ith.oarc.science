<P>15. And as there are objections in both cases.</P>
<P>A difficulty arises not only on the view of the atoms having colour and other sensible qualities, but also on the view of their being destitute of those qualities. For as the qualities of effected things depend on the qualities of their causes, earth, water, and so on, would in that case be destitute of qualities. And if to avoid this difficulty, it be held that the atoms do possess qualities, we are again met by the difficulty stated in the preceding S&ucirc;tra. Objections thus arising in both cases, the theory of the atoms is untenable.</P>
