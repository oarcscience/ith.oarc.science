<P>30. On account of the impossibility (of qualification for the madhuvidy&acirc;, &amp;c.) (<I>G</I>aimini maintains the non-qualification (of gods, &amp;c.).</P>
<P>So far it has been proved that also the gods, and so on, are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman. But a further point here presents itself for consideration, viz. whether the gods are qualified or not to undertake those meditations of which they themselves are the objects. The S&ucirc;tra states as a p&ucirc;rvapaksha view held by <I>G</I>aimini, that they are not so qualified, for the reason that there are no other &Acirc;dityas, Vasus, and so on, who could be meditated on by the &Acirc;dityas and Vasus themselves; and that moreover for the &Acirc;dityas and Vasus the qualities and position of those classes of deities cannot be objects of desire, considering that they possess them already. The so-called Madhuvidy&acirc; (<I>Kh</I>. Up. III) represents as objects of devout meditation certain parts of the sun which are being enjoyed by the different classes of divine beings, Vasus, &Acirc;dityas, and so on--the sun being there called 'madhu.' i.e. honey or nectar, on account of his being the abode of a certain nectar to be brought about by certain sacrificial works to be known from the <I>Ri</I>g-veda, and so on; and as the reward of such meditation the text names the attainment of the position of the Vasus, &Acirc;dityas, and so on.</P>
