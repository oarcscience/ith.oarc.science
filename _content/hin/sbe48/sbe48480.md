These works are to be performed also on account of their being
co-operative towards knowledge in so far, namely, as they give rise to
the desire of knowledge; and their thus being enjoined for a double

the sacrificer and another text with his desire to reach the heavenly
world.--Nor does this imply a difference of works--this the next Sûtra
declares.
