<P>33. And likewise non-entireness of the Self.</P>
<P>On your view there would likewise follow non-entireness of the Self. For your opinion is that souls abide in numberless places, each soul having the same size as the body which it animates. When, therefore, the soul previously abiding in the body of an elephant or the like has to enter into a body of smaller size, e. g. that of an ant, it would follow that as the soul then occupies less space, it would not remain entire, but would become incomplete.--Let us then avoid this difficulty by assuming that the soul passes over into a different state--which process is called pary&acirc;ya,--which it may manage because it is capable of contraction and dilatation.--To this the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</P>
