<P>other meanings, that of Brahman. Compare 'For who could breathe, who could breathe forth, if that ether were not bliss?' (Taitt. Up. II, 7); 'All these beings take their rise from the ether' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. I, 9, 1). It has to be kept in view that in the text under discussion the meaning 'Brahman' is supported by what is said about the qualities of the small ether--viz. freedom from sin, &amp;c.--and hence is stronger than the other meaning--, according to which &acirc;k&acirc;<I>s</I>a signifies the elemental ether.</P>
<P>So far the S&ucirc;tras have refuted the view of the small ether being the element. They now enter on combating the notion that the small ether may possibly be the individual soul.</P>
