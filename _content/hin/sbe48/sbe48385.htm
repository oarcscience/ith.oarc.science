<P>1. What is understood from all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts (is one), on account of the non-difference of injunction and the rest.</P>
<P>The S&ucirc;tras have stated whatever has to be stated to the end of rousing the desire of meditation-concluding with the fact that Brahman bestows rewards. Next the question is introduced whether the vidy&acirc;s (i.e. the different forms of meditation on Brahman which the Ved&acirc;nta-texts enjoin) are different or non-different, on the decision of which question it will depend whether the qualities attributed to Brahman in those vidy&acirc;s are to be comprised in one act of meditation or not.--The first subordinate question arising here is whether one and the same meditation--as e.g. the vidy&acirc; of Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara--which is met with in the text of several <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, constitutes one vidy&acirc; or several.--The vidy&acirc;s are separate, the P&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains; for the fact that the same matter is, without difference, imparted for a second time, and moreover stands under a different heading--both which circumstances necessarily attend the text's being met with in different <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s--proves the difference of the two meditations. It is for this reason only that a restrictive injunction, such as the one conveyed in the text, 'Let a man tell this science of Brahman to those only who have performed the rite of carrying fire on their head' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 10)--which restricts the impaiting of knowledge to the &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>ikas, to whom that rite is peculiar--has any sense; for if the vidy&acirc;s were one, then the rite mentioned, which is a part of the vidy&acirc;, would be valid for the members of other <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s also, and then the restriction enjoined by the text would have no meaning.--This view is set aside by the S&ucirc;tra, 'What is understood from all the Ved&acirc;nta-texts' is one and the same meditation, 'because there is non-difference of injunction and the rest.' By injunction is meant the</P>

<P>injunction of special activities denoted by different verbal roots--such as up&acirc;s&icirc;ta 'he should meditate,' vidy&acirc;t 'he should know.' The and the rest' of the S&ucirc;tra is meant to comprise as additional reasons the circumstances mentioned in the P&ucirc;rva M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc;-s&ucirc;tras (II, 4, 9). Owing to all these circumstances, non-difference of injunction and the rest, the same vidy&acirc; is recognised in other <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s also. In the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;andogya (V, 12, 2) as well as in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka we meet with one and the same injunction (viz. 'He should meditate on Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara'). The form (character, r&ucirc;pa) of the meditations also is the same, for the form of a cognition solely depends on its object; and the object is in both cases the same, viz. Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara. The name of the two vidy&acirc;s also is the same, viz. the knowledge of Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara. And both vidy&acirc;s are declared to have the same result, viz. attaining to Brahman. All these reasons establish the identity of vidy&acirc;s even in different <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s.--The next S&ucirc;tra refers to the reasons set forth for his view by the P&ucirc;rvapakshin and refutes them.</P>
