<P>35. On account of the inferential sign further on, together with <I>K</I>aitraratha.</P>
<P>The kshattriya-hood of <I>G</I>&acirc;na<I>s</I>ruti is further to be accepted on account of the Kshattriya Abhiprat&acirc;rin <I>K</I>aitraratha, who is mentioned further on in this very same Sa<I>m</I>vargavidy&acirc; which Raikva imparts to <I>G</I>&acirc;na<I>s</I>ruti.--But why?--As follows. The section beginning 'Once a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin</P>
<P><A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A></P>
<P>begged of Saunaka K&acirc;peya and Abhiprat&acirc;rin K&acirc;kshaseni while being waited on at their meal,' and ending 'thus do we, O Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, meditate on that being,' shows K&acirc;peya, Abhiprat&acirc;rin, and the Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin to be connected with the Sa<I>m</I>varga-vidy&acirc;. Now Abhiprat&acirc;rin is a Kshattriya, the other two are Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as. This shows that there are connected with the vidy&acirc;, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and from among non-Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, a Kshattriya only, but not a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra. It therefore appears appropriate to infer that the person, other than the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a Raikva, who is likewise connected with this vidy&acirc;, viz. <I>G</I>&acirc;nasruti, is likewise a Kshattriya, not a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra.--But how do we know that Abhiprat&acirc;rin is a <I>K</I>aitraratha and a Kshattriya? Neither of these circumstances is stated in the legend in the Sa<I>m</I>varga-vidy&acirc;! To this question the S&ucirc;tra replies, 'on account of the inferential mark.' From the inferential mark that <I>S</I>aunaka K&acirc;peya and Abhiprat&acirc;rin K&acirc;kshaseni are said to have been sitting together at a meal we understand that there is some connexion between Abhiprat&acirc;rin and the K&acirc;peyas. Now another scriptural passage runs as follows: 'The K&acirc;peyas made <I>K</I>aitraratha perform that sacrifice' (T&acirc;<I>nd</I> Br&acirc;. XX, 12, 5), and this shows that one connected with the K&acirc;peyas was a <I>K</I>aitraratha; and a further text shows that a <I>K</I>aitraratha is a Kshattriya. 'from him there was descended a <I>K</I>aitraratha who was a prince.' All this favours the inference that Abhiprat&acirc;rin was a <I>K</I>aitraratha and a Kshattriya.</P>
<P>So far the S&ucirc;tras have shown that there is no inferential mark to prove what is contradicted by reasoning, viz. the qualification of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras. The next S&ucirc;tra declares that the non-qualification of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra proved by reasoning is confirmed by Scripture and Sm<I>ri</I>ti.</P>
