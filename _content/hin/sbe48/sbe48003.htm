<P>MAY my mind be filled with devotion towards the highest Brahman, the abode of Lakshmi who is luminously revealed in the Upanishads; who in sport produces, sustains, and reabsorbs the entire Universe; whose only aim is to foster the manifold classes of beings that humbly worship him.</P>
<P>The nectar of the teaching of Par&acirc;sara's son (Vy&acirc;sa),--which was brought up from the middle of the milk-ocean of the Upanishads--which restores to life the souls whose vital strength had departed owing to the heat of the fire of transmigratory existence--which was well guarded by the teachers of old--which was obscured by the mutual conflict of manifold opinions,--may intelligent men daily enjoy that as it is now presented to them in my words.</P>
<P>The lengthy explanation (v<I>ri</I>tti) of the Brahma-s&ucirc;tras which was composed by the Reverend Bodh&acirc;yana has been abridged by former teachers; according to their views the words of the S&ucirc;tras will be explained in this present work.</P>
