7\. And as in the case of the 'Great.'

In the case of the passage 'Higher than the intellect is the Great
Self,' we conclude from the co-ordination of 'the Great' with the Self
that what the text means is not the 'Great' principle of the Sankhyas;
analogously we conclude that the 'Unevolved,' which is said to be higher
than the Self, cannot be the Pradhâna of Kapila's system.
