<P>17. And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heard the Upanishads.</P>
<P>Other scriptural texts give an account of the way--the first station of which is light--that leads up to the highest Person, without any subsequent return, the soul of him who has read the Upanishads, and has thus acquired a knowledge of the true nature of the highest Self.
