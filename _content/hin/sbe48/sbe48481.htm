<P>34. In any case they are the same, on account of twofold inferential signs.</P>
<P>There is no radical difference of works; but in any case, i.e. whether they be viewed as duties incumbent on the &acirc;<I>s</I>rama or as auxiliary to knowledge, sacrifices and other works are one and the same. For Scripture, in enjoining them in both these aspects, makes use of the same terms, so that we recognise the same acts, and there is no means of proof to establish difference of works.</P>
