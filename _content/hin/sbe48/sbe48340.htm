<P>23. Not very long; on account of special statement.</P>
<P>Does the soul in its descent through ether, and so on, stay at each stage for a not very long time, or is there nothing to define that time?--It stays at each stage for an indefinite time, there being nothing to define the time.--</P>
<P><A NAME="page_597"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 597</FONT></A></P>
<P>Not so, the S&ucirc;tra decides. For there is a special statement, i.e. the text says that when the soul has become rice or grain or the like, the passing out of that stage is beset with difficulties. From this we infer that as there is no such statement concerning the earlier stages, the soul stays at each of them for a short time only.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the not very long time.'</P>
