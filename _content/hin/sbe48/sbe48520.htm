<P>mind are united with mind and breath only; so we conclude from the subsequent clause 'breath with fire' that breath becomes united with fire only.--Against this prim&acirc; facie view the S&ucirc;tra declares 'that breath becomes united with the ruler of the organs, i.e. the individual soul, on account of the going to it, and so on.' That breath goes to the individual soul, the following text declares, 'At the time of death all the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as go to the Self of a man about to expire ' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 3, 38), Similarly Scripture mentions the departure of pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a together with the soul, 'after him thus departing the prawa departs'; and again its staying together with the soul, 'What is that by whose departure I shall depart, and by whose staying I shall stay?' (Pr. Up. VI, 3). We therefore conclude that the text 'breath with fire' means that breath joined with the individual soul becomes united with fire. Analogously we may say in ordinary life that the Yamuna is flowing towards the sea, while in reality it is the Yamuna joined with the Gang&acirc; which flows on.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the ruler.'</P>
