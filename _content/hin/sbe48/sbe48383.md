39\. For the same reasons *G*aimini (thinks it to be) religious action.

For the same reasons, viz. possibility and scriptural declaration, the
teacher *G*aimini thinks that religious works, viz. sacrifices, gifts,
offerings, and meditation, of themselves bring about their rewards. For
we observe that in ordinary life actions such as ploughing and the like,
and charitable gifts and so on, bring about their own reward, directly
or indirectly. And although Vedic works do not bring about their rewards
immediately, they may do so mediately, viz. by means of the so-called
*apûrva*. This follows also from the form of the Vedic injunctions, such
as 'He who is desirous of the heavenly world is to sacrifice.' As such
injunctions enjoin sacrifices as the means of bringing about the object
desired to be realised, viz. the heavenly world and the like, there is
no other way left than to assume that the result (which is seen not to
spring directly from the sacrifice) is accomplished by the mediation of
the apûrva.
