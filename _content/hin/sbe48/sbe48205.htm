<P>36. And because all the attributes are proved (to be present in Brahman).</P>
<P>As all those attributes required to constitute causality which have been or will be shown to be absent in the Pradh&acirc;na, the atoms, and so on, can be shown to be present in Brahman, it remains a settled conclusion that Brahman only is the cause of the world. Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'that which has the nature of depending on a motive.'</P>
