<P>29. And on account of denial.</P>
<P>Texts such as 'This is that great unborn Self, undecaying, undying' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 4, 25), 'By the old age of the body that does not age' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VIII, 1, 5), deny of Brahman the properties of non-sentient matter. From this it follows that the relation of the two can only be that of distinguishing attribute and thing distinguished, and hence of part and whole. Brahman distinguished by sentient and non-sentient beings in their subtle state is the cause; distinguished by the same beings in their gross state is the effect: the effect thus is non-different from the cause, and by the knowledge of the causal Brahman the effect is likewise known. All these tenets are in full mutual agreement. Brahman's freedom from defects also is preserved; and this and Brahman's being the abode of all blessed qualities prove that Brahman possesses the 'twofold characteristics.'--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the coils of the snake.'</P>
