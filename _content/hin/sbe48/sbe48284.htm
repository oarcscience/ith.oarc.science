<P>38. And on account of the absence of sam&acirc;dhi.</P>
<P>If the internal organ were the agent, it would be such even in that final state of meditation, called sam&acirc;dhi, which is the instrument of Release. But that state consists therein that the meditating being realises its difference from Prak<I>ri</I>ti, and this is a conception which Prak<I>ri</I>ti itself (of which the internal organ is only a modification) cannot form. The Self alone, therefore, is the agent. But this would imply that the activity of the Self is never at rest! Of this difficulty the next S&ucirc;tra disposes.</P>
