<P>9. 'On account of conduct'; not so, since (<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>a) connotes works; thus K&acirc;rsh<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>g</I>ini thinks.</P>
<P>In the phrases 'those whose works were good' (rama<I>n</I>&icirc;ya-<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>), and 'those whose works were bad' (kap&ucirc;y&acirc;-<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>), the word <I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>a does not denote good and evil works (i.e. not such works as the Veda on the one hand enjoins as leading to certain rewards, and on the other prohibits, threatening punishment), for, in Vedic as well as ordinary language, the term <I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>a is generally used in the sense of &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ra, i.e. general conduct. In ordinary speech such words as &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ra, <I>s</I>&icirc;la, v<I>ri</I>tta are considered synonymous, and in the Veda we read 'whatever works (karm&acirc;<I>n</I>i) are blameless, those should be regarded, not others. Whatever our good conduct (su-<I>k</I>arit&acirc;ni) was, that should be observed by thee, nothing else' (Taitt. Up. I, 11, 2)--where 'works' and 'conduct' are distinguished. Difference in quality of birth therefore depends on conduct, not on the remainder of works performed with a view to certain results.--This prim&acirc; facie view the S&ucirc;tra sets aside, 'not so,because the scriptural term <I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>a connotes works; thus the teacher <I>K</I>&acirc;rsh<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>g</I>ini thinks.' For mere conduct does not lead to experiences of pleasure and pain; pleasure and pain are the results of <I>works</I> in the limited sense.</P>
