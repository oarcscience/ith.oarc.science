Not with one; because each element by itself is incapable of producing
an effect. Such incapability is declared by Scripture and tradition

\[paragraph continues\] VI, 3) teaches that the elements were rendered
tripartite in order to be capable of evolving names and forms; and of
similar import is the following Sm*ri*ti text, 'Possessing various
powers these (elements), being separate from one another, were unable to
produce creatures without combining. But having entered into mutual
conjunction they, from the Mahat down to individual beings, produce the
Brahma egg.' From this it follows that in the clause 'breath is united
with fire' the word *fire* denotes fire mixed with the other elements.
Breath and soul therefore are united with the aggregate of the
elements.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the elements.'
