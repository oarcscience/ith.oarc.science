<P>20. (It is) a mark indicating that the promissory statement is proved; thus &Acirc;<I>s</I>marathya thinks.</P>
<P>According to the teacher &Acirc;<I>s</I>marathya the circumstance that terms denoting the individual soul are used to denote Brahman is a mark enabling us to infer that the promissory declaration according to which through the knowledge of one thing everything is known is well established. If the individual soul were not identical with Brahman in so far as it is the effect of Brahman, then the knowledge of the soul--being something distinct from Brahman--would not follow from the knowledge of the highest Self. There are the texts declaring the oneness of Brahman previous to creation, such as 'the Self only was this in the beginning' (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 4, 1, 1), and on the other hand those texts which declare that the souls spring from and again are merged in Brahman; such as 'As from a blazing fire sparks being like unto fire fly forth a thousandfold, thus are various beings brought forth from the Imperishable, and return thither also' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 1). These two sets of texts together make us apprehend that the souls are one with Brahman in so far as they are its effects. On this ground a word denoting the individual soul denotes the highest Self as well.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_35"></A><A HREF="sbe48161.htm#fr_35">391:1</A> If it be insisted upon that the Self in 'for the desire of the Self' is the individual Self, we point out that terms denoting the individual Self at the same time denote the highest Self also. This tenet of his R&acirc;m&acirc;nu<I>g</I>a considers to be set forth and legitimately proved in S&ucirc;tra 23, while S&ucirc;tras 21 and 22 although advocating the right principle fail to assign valid arguments.</P>
