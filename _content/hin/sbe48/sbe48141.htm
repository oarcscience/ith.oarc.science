<P>43. On account of difference in deep sleep and departing.</P>
<P>We have to supply 'on account of designation' from the preceding S&ucirc;tra. Because the text designates the highest Self as something different from the individual Self in the state of deep sleep as well as at the time of departure, the highest Self is thus different. For the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka, after having introduced the individual Self in the passage 'Who is that Self?--He who consisting of knowledge is among the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as,' &amp;c. (B<I>ri.</I> Up. IV, 3, 7), describes how, in the state of deep sleep, being not conscious of anything it is held embraced by the all-knowing highest Self, embraced by the intelligent Self it knows nothing that is without, nothing that is within' (IV, 3, 21). So also with reference to the time of departure, i.e. dying 'Mounted by the intelligent Self it moves along groaning' (IV, 3, 35). Now it is impossible that the unconscious individual Self, either lying in deep sleep or departing from the body, should at the same time be embraced or mounted by itself, being all-knowing. Nor can the embracing and mounting Self be some other individual Self; for no such Self can be all-knowing.--The next S&ucirc;tra supplies a further reason.</P>
