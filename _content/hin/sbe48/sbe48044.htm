<P>11. On account of the uniformity of view.</P>
<P>'In the beginning the Self was all this; there was nothing else whatsoever thinking. He thought, shall I send forth worlds? He sent forth these worlds' (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 4, 1, 1); 'From that Self sprang ether, from ether air, from air fire, from fire water, from water earth' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'From this great Being were breathed forth the <I>Ri</I>g-veda,' &amp;c.--These and similar texts referring to the creation have all the same purport: they all teach us that the Supreme Lord is the cause of the world. We therefore conclude that in the <I>Kh</I>. passage also the Sat, which is said to be the cause of the world, is the Supreme Lord.</P>
