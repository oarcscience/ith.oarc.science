<P>18. For (there is the text) 'whatever he does with knowledge.'</P>
<P>The declaration made in the text 'whatever he does with knowledge that is more vigorous,' viz. that the knowledge of the Udg&icirc;tha has for its result non-obstruction of the result of the sacrifice, implies that the result of works actually performed <I>may</I> be obstructed. We thus arrive at the conclusion that the text of the S&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yanins,' his friends enter upon his good works,' refers to those good works of the man possessing knowledge the results of which were somehow obstructed (and hence did not act themselves out during his lifetime, so that on his death they may be transferred to others).--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the Agnihotra and the rest.'</P>
