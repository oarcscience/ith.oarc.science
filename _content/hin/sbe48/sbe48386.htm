<P>2. If it be said (that the vidy&acirc;s are not one) on account of difference, we deny this, since even in one (vidy&acirc; there may be repetition).</P>
<P>If it be said that there is no oneness of vidy&acirc;, because the fact of the same matter being stated again without difference, and being met with in a different chapter, proves the object of injunction to be different; we reply that even in one and the same vidy&acirc; some matter may be repeated without any change, and under a new heading (in a different chapter); if, namely, there is difference of cognising subjects. Where the cognising person is one only, repetition of the same matter under a new heading can only be explained as meaning difference of object enjoined, and hence separation of the two vidy&acirc;s. But where the cognising persons are different (and this of course is eminently so in the case of different <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s), the double statement of one and the same matter explains itself as subserving the cognition of those different persons, and hence does not imply difference of matter enjoined.--The next S&ucirc;tra</P>
