4\. Scripture also declares this.

Scripture also shows that (identical) meditation is what all the
Vedânta-texts intimate. The *Kh*ândogya (VIII, 1, 1 ff.) declares that
that which is within the small space in the heart is to be enquired
into, and then in reply to the

question what the thing to be enquired into is, says that it is the
highest Self possessing the eight attributes, freedom from all evil and
the rest, which is to be meditated upon within the heart. And then the
Taittiriya-text, referring to this declaration in the *Kh*ândogya, says,
'Therein is a small space, free from all grief; what is within that is
to be meditated upon' (Mahânâr. Up. X, 23), and thus likewise enjoins
meditation on the highest Self possessing the eight qualities. And this
is possible only if, owing to unity of vidya, the qualities mentioned in
the first text are included also in the meditation enjoined in the
second text.--Having thus established the unity of meditations, the
Sûtras proceed to state the practical effect of such unity.
