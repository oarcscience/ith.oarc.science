<P>19. And (the qualities) thus being equal, on account of non-difference.</P>
<P>In the book of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka, called Agnirahasya, we meet with a meditation on Brahman called <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>nd</I>ilyavidy&acirc;; and there is also a <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>nd</I>ilya-vidy&acirc; in the B<I>ri</I>had&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka . The P&ucirc;rvapakshin holds that these two meditations are different since the latter text mentions qualities--such as Brahman being the lord of all--which are not mentioned in the former; the objects of meditation thus being different, the meditations themselves are different.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> --This the S&ucirc;tra negatives. The object of meditation is 'equal,' for both texts state the same qualities, such as 'consisting of mind,' and so on; and the additional qualities stated in the B<I>ri</I>had-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, such as the rulership of Brahman,'do not differ' from those equally stated by both texts, such as Brahman realising all its purposes, and so on. Thus the objects of meditation do not differ in character.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'what is equal.'</P>
