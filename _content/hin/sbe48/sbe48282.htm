<P>36. (There would be) absence of definite rule, as in the case of consciousness.</P>
<P>The S&ucirc;tra points out a difficulty which arises on the view of the Self not being an agent. S&ucirc;tra 32 has declared that if the Self were all-pervading it would follow that there would be no definite determination with regard to consciousness. Similarly, if the Self were not an agent but all activity belonged to Prak<I>ri</I>ti it would follow that as Prak<I>ri</I>ti is a common possession of all souls, all actions would result in enjoyment (experience) on the part of all souls, or else on the part of none; for as each Self is held to be omnipresent, they are all of them in equal proximity to all parts of the Pradh&acirc;na. For the same reason it could not be maintained that the distribution of results between the different souls depends on the different internal organs which are joined to the souls; for if the souls are omnipresent, no soul will be exclusively connected with any particular internal organ.</P>
