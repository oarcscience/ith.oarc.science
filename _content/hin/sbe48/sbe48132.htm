<P>34. And on account of (<I>G</I>&acirc;na<I>s</I>ruti ) kshattriya-hood being understood.</P>
<P>The first section of the vidy&acirc; tells us that <I>G</I>&acirc;na<I>s</I>ruti bestowed much wealth and food; later on he is represented as sending his door-keeper on an errand; and in the end, as bestowing on Raikva many villages--which shows him to be a territorial lord. All these circumstances suggest <I>G</I>&acirc;na<I>s</I>ruti's being a Kshattriya, and hence not a member of the lowest caste.--The above S&ucirc;tra having declared that the kshattriya-hood of <I>G</I>&acirc;na<I>s</I>ruti is indicated in the introductory legend, the next S&ucirc;tra shows that the same circumstance is indicated in the concluding legend.</P>
