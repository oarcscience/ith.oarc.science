<P>7. If it be said that (the effect is) non-existing; we say no, there being a mere denial.</P>
<P>But, an objection is raised, if Brahman, the cause, differs in nature from the effect, viz. the world, this means that cause and effect are separate things and that hence the effect does not exist in the cause, i.e. Brahman; and this again implies that the world originates from what has no existence!--Not so, we reply. For what the preceding S&ucirc;tra has laid down is merely the denial of an absolute rule demanding that cause and effect should be of the same nature; it was not asserted that the effect is a thing altogether different and separate from the cause. We by no means abandon our tenet that Brahman the cause modifies itself so as to assume the form of a world differing from it in character. For such is the case with the honey</P>

<P>and the worms also. There is difference of characteristics, but--as in the case of gold and golden bracelets--there is oneness of substance.--An objection is raised.</P>
