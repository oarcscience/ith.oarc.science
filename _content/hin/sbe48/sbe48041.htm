<P>The Pradh&acirc;na is not the cause of the world for the following reason also:</P>
<P>8. And because there is no statement of its having to be set aside.</P>
<P>If the word 'Sat' denoted the Pradh&acirc;na as the cause of the world, we should expect the text to teach that the idea of having his Self in that 'Sat' should be set aside by <I>S</I>vetaketu as desirous of Release; for that idea would be contrary to Release. So far from teaching this, the text, however, directly inculcates that notion in the words 'Thou art that.'--The next S&ucirc;tra adds a further reason.</P>
