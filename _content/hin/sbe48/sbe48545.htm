<P>9. On the passing away of the effected (world of Brahma), together with its ruler, (the souls go) to what is higher than that; on account of scriptural declaration.</P>
<P>On the passing away of the effected world of Brahma, together with its ruler Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha, who then recognises his qualification for higher knowledge, the soul also which had gone to Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha attains to true knowledge and thus reaches Brahman, which is higher than that,</P>

<P>i.e. higher than the effected world of Brahm&acirc;. This is known from the texts declaring that he who proceeds on the path of light reaches immortality and does not return; and is further confirmed by the text, 'They all, reaching the highest immortality, become free in the world of Brahman (Brahm&acirc;) at the time of the great end ' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 6).</P>
