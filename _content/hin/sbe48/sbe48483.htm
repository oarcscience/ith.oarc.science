<P>It has been declared that the members of the four &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas have a claim to the knowledge of Brahman, and that the duties connected with each &acirc;<I>s</I>rarna promote knowledge. A doubt now arises whether those men also who, on account of poverty and so on, stand outside the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas are qualified for the knowledge of Brahman, or rtot.--They are not, the P&ucirc;rvapakshin holds, since such knowledge is to be attained in a way dependent on the special duties of each &acirc;<I>s</I>rama; while those who do not belong to an &acirc;<I>s</I>rama are not concerned with &acirc;<I>s</I>rama duties.--This view the S&ucirc;tra rejects. Those also who do not stand within any &acirc;<I>s</I>rama are qualified for knowledge, 'because that is seen,' i.e. because the texts declare that men such as Raikva, Bh&icirc;shma, Sa<I>m</I>varta and others who did not belong to &acirc;<I>s</I>rama were well grounded in the knowledge of Brahman. It can by no means be maintained that it is &acirc;<I>s</I>rama duties only that promote knowledge; for the text 'by gifts, by penance, by fasting, and so on' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 4, 22) distinctly declares that charity also and other practices, which are not confined to the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas, are helpful towards knowledge. In the same way as in the case of those bound to chastity--who, as the texts show, may possess the knowledge of Brahman--knowledge is promoted by practices other than the Agnihotra and the like, so--it is concluded--in the case of those also who do not belong to any abrama knowledge may be promoted by certain practices not exclusively connected with any &acirc;<I>s</I>rama, such as prayer, fasting, charity, propitiation of the divinity, and so on.</P>
