<P>25. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the fire and so on.</P>
<P>The S&ucirc;tras return, from their digression into the discussion of two special points, to the question as to those whose condition of life involves chastity. The above S&ucirc;tra declares that as persons of that class are referred to by Scripture as specially concerned with meditation ('He who is founded on Brahman reaches immortality;' 'those who in the forest,' &amp;c.), their meditation does not presuppose a knowledge of the kindling of fire and so on, i.e. a knowledge of the Agnihotra, the Dar<I>s</I>ap&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa, and all those other sacrifices which require the preliminary establishnlent of the sacred fires, but a knowledge of those works only which are enjoined for their special condition of life.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the kindling of the fire.'</P>
