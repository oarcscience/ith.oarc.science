<P>13. But of the others having enjoyed in Sa<I>m</I>yamana, there is ascent and descent; as such a course is declared.</P>
<P>Of the others, i.e. those who do not perform sacrifices, and so on, there is ascent to the moon and descent from there, only after they have in the kingdom of Yama suffered the punishments due to their actions. For the text declares that evil-doers fall under the power of Yama, and have to go to him, 'He who thinks, this is the world there is no other, falls again and again under my sway' (Ka. Up. I, 2, 6); 'the son of Vivasvat, the gathering place of men' (<I>Ri</I>k Sa<I>m</I>h. X, 14, 1); 'King Yama,' and other texts.</P>
