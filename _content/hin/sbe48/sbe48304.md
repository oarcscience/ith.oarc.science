6\. And (they are) minute.

As the text 'these are all alike, all infinite' (B*ri*. Up. I, 5, 13),
declares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the
prâ*n*as are all-pervading.--To this the Sûtra replies, that they are
minute; for the text 'when the vital breath passes out of the body, all
the prâ*n*as pass out after it' (B*ri*. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those
prâ*n*as to be of limited size, and as when passing out they are not
perceived by bystanders, they must be of minute size--The text which
speaks of them as infinite is a text enjoining meditation ('he who
meditates on them as infinite'), and infinity there means only that
abundance of activities which is an attribute of the prâ*n*a to be
meditated on.
