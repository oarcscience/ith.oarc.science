19\. And (the qualities) thus being equal, on account of non-difference.

In the book of the Vâ*g*asaneyaka, called Agnirahasya, we meet with a
meditation on Brahman called *S*â*nd*ilyavidyâ; and there is also a
*S*â*nd*ilya-vidyâ in the B*ri*hadâra*n*yaka . The Pûrvapakshin holds
that these two meditations are different since the latter text mentions
qualities--such as Brahman being the lord of all--which are not
mentioned in the former; the objects of meditation thus being different,
the meditations themselves are different.

\[paragraph continues\] --This the Sûtra negatives. The object of
meditation is 'equal,' for both texts state the same qualities, such as
'consisting of mind,' and so on; and the additional qualities stated in
the B*ri*had-âra*n*yaka, such as the rulership of Brahman,'do not
differ' from those equally stated by both texts, such as Brahman
realising all its purposes, and so on. Thus the objects of meditation do
not differ in character.--Here terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'what is
equal.'
