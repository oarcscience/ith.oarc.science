<P>8. But on account of nearness there is that designation.</P>
<P>Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha is the first created being (as declared by the text 'he who creates Brahma'); he thus stands near to Brahman, and therefore may be designated by the same term (viz. Brahman). This explanation is necessitated by the reasons set forth in the preceding S&ucirc;tras (which show that the real highest Brahman cannot be meant).--But, if the soul advancing on the path of the Gods reaches Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha only, texts such as 'This is the path of the Gods, the path of Brahman; those who proceed on that path do not return to the life of man' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. IV, 15, 6), and 'moving upwards by that a man reaches immortality' (VIII, 6, 6), are wrong in asserting that that soul attains to immortality and does not return; for the holy books teach that Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha, as a created being, passes away at the end of a dvipar&acirc;rdha-period; and the text 'Up to the world of Brahman the worlds return again' (Bha. G&icirc;. VIII, 16) shows that those who have gone to Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha necessarily return also.</P>
