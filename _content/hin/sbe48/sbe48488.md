41\. Nor the (expiatory performance) described in the chapter treating
of qualification; that being impossible on account of the Sm*ri*ti
referring to such lapse.

Those expiatory performances which are described in the chapter treating
of qualification (Pû. Mî. Sû. VI) are not possible in the case of him
who has lapsed from the condition of a Naish*th*ika; since such
expiations do not apply to him, as is shown by a Sm*ri*ti text referring
to such lapse, viz. 'He who having once entered on the duties of a
Naish*th*ika lapses from them, for such a slayer of the Self I do not
see any expiatory work by which he might become clean.' The expiatory
ceremony referred to in the Pûrva Mimâ*m*sâ therefore applies to the
case of other Brahma*k*ârins only.

expiation, as in the case of eating.](sbe48489)
