<P>40. But from the highest, this being declared by Scripture.</P>
<P>Is the activity of the individual soul independent (free), or does it depend on the highest Self? It is free; for if it were dependent on the highest Self, the whole body of scriptural injunctions and prohibitions would be unmeaning. For commandments can be addressed to such</P>

<P>agents only as are capable of entering on action or refraining from action, according to their own thought and will.</P>
<P>This prim&acirc; facie view is set aside by the S&ucirc;tra. The activity of the individual soul proceeds from the highest Self as its cause. For Scripture teaches this. 'Entered within, the ruler of creatures, the Self of all'; 'who dwelling in the Self is different from the Self, whom the Self does not know, whose body the Self is, who rules the Self from within, he is thy Self, the inward ruler, the immortal one.' Sm<I>ri</I>ti teaches the same, 'I dwell within the heart of all; memory and knowledge as well as their loss come from me'(Bha. G&icirc;. XV, 15); 'The Lord, O Ar<I>g</I>una, dwells in the heart of all creatures, whirling, by his mysterious power, all creatures as if mounted on a machine' (Bha. G&icirc;. XVIII, 61).--But this view implies the meaninglessness of all scriptural injunctions and prohibitions!--To this the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</P>
