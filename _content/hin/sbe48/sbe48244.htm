<P>41. And there is not (origination) of the instrument from the agent.</P>
<P>'The internal organ called Pradyumna originates from Sa<U>n</U>karsha<I>n</I>a,' i. e. the internal organ originates from the individual soul which is the agent. But this is inadmissible, since the text 'from him there is produced breath, mind, and all sense-organs' (Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) declares that the mind also springs from none else but the highest Brahman. As the Bh&acirc;gavata doctrine thus teaches things opposed to Scripture, its authoritativeness cannot be admitted.--Against these objections the next S&ucirc;tra declares itself.</P>
