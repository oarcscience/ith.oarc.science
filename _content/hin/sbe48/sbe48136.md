38\. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and
performance of (Vedic) matter.

The *S*ûdra is specially forbidden to hear and study the Veda and to
perform the things enjoined in it. 'For a *S*ûdra is like a cemetery,
therefore the Veda must not be read in the vicinity of a *S*ûdra;'
'Therefore the *S*ûdra is like a beast, unfit for sacrifices.' And he
who does not hear the Veda recited cannot learn it so as to understand
and perform what the Veda enjoins. The prohibition of hearing thus
implies the prohibition of understanding and whatever depends on it.
