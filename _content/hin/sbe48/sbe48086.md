20\. And not that which Sm*ri*ti assumes, on account of the declaration
of qualities not belonging to that; nor the embodied one.

'That which Sm*ri*ti assumes' is the Pradhâna; the 'embodied one' is the
individual soul. Neither of these can be the Ruler within, since the
text states attributes which cannot possibly belong to either. For there
is not even the shadow of a possibility that essential capability of
seeing and ruling all things, and being the Self of all, and immortality
should belong either to the non-sentient Pradhâna or to the individual
soul.--The last two Sûtras have declared that the mentioned qualities
belong to the highest Self, while they do not belong to the individual
soul. The next Sûtra supplies a new, independent argument.
