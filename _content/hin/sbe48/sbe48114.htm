<P>15. And on account of there being observed in that (small ether), supporting which is a greatness of that (i. e. Brahman).</P>
<P>In continuation of the passage 'It is the Self free from Sin,' &amp;c., which refers to the small ether, the text says: 'it is a bank, a limitary support, that these worlds may not be confounded.' What the text here says about the small ether supporting the world proves it to be the highest Brahman; for to support the world is the glory of Brahman. Compare 'He is the Lord of all, the king of all things, the protector of all things. He is a bank and a boundary, so that these worlds may not be confounded' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 4, 22); 'By the command of that Imperishable, O G&acirc;rg&icirc;, heaven and earth stand, held apart' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. III, 8, 9). Now this specific greatness of the highest Brahman, which consists in its supporting the world, is also observed in the small ether--which proves the latter to be none other than Brahman.</P>
