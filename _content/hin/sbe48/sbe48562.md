11\. The presence, *G*aimini holds; because the text declares
manifoldness.

The teacher *G*aimini holds that the Released one has a body and senses;
because the text declares manifoldness--'He is onefold, he is threefold,
he is fivefold, he is sevenfold' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 26, 2). The Self which
is one and indivisible cannot be manifold, and the various forms of
manifoldness of which the text speaks therefore must depend on the body.
The text which speaks of the absence of a body refers to the absence of
that body only which is due to Karman; for this latter body only is the
cause of pleasure and pain. Next the Reverend Bâdarâya*n*a decides this
point by the declaration of his own view.

[Next: 12. For this reason Bâdarâyana holds him to be of both kinds; as
in the case of the twelve days' sacrifice](sbe48563)
