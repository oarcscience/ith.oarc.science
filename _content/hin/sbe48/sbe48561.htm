<P>10. The absence, B&acirc;dari holds; for thus Scripture says.</P>
<P>A doubt arises whether the Released has a body and sense-organs, or not; or whether he has them or not just as he pleases. The teacher B&acirc;dari holds that body and sense-organs are absent; since the text declares this. The text--'as long as he is embodied there is no freedom from pleasure and pain; but when he is free from the body then neither pleasure nor pain touches him' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VIII, 12, 1)--declares that pleasure and pain are necessarily connected with embodiedness; and the text--'having risen from this body and reached the highest light he manifests himself in his own shape' (VIII, 12, 3)--declares that the Released one is without a body.</P>
