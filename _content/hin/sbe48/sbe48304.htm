<P>6. And (they are) minute.</P>
<P>As the text 'these are all alike, all infinite' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. I, 5, 13), declares speech, mind, and breath to be infinite, we conclude that the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as are all-pervading.--To this the S&ucirc;tra replies, that they are minute; for the text 'when the vital breath passes out of the body, all the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as pass out after it' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. V, 4, 2), proves those pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as to be of limited size, and as when passing out they are not perceived by bystanders, they must be of minute size--The text which speaks of them as infinite is a text enjoining meditation ('he who meditates on them as infinite'), and infinity there means only that abundance of activities which is an attribute of the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a to be meditated on.</P>
