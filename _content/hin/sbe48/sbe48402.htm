<P>18. The new (thing is enjoined); on account of the statement of what has to be done.</P>
<P>The S&ucirc;tra discusses an additional question connected with the meditation on breath. Both texts--the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya as well as the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka-declare that water constitutes a dress for pra<I>n</I>a, and refer to the rinsing of the mouth</P>

<P>with water. The doubt here arises whether what the texts mean to enjoin is the rinsing of the mouth, or a meditation on pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a as having water for its dress.--The P&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains the former view; for, he says, the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka uses the injunctive form 'he is to rinse,' while there is no injunctive form referring to the meditation; and what the text says in praise of the breath thus not being allowed to remain naked may be taken as a mere glorification of the act of rinsing. And as ordinary rinsing of the mouth, subsequent to eating, is already established by Sm<I>ri</I>ti and custom, we must conclude that the text means to enjoin rinsing of the mouth of a different kind, viz. as auxiliary to the meditation on pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a.--To this the S&ucirc;tra replies that what the text enjoins is the new' thing, i.e. the previously non-established meditation on water as forming the dress of pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a. 'On account of the statement of what has to be done,' i.e. on account of the statement of what is not established--for only on the latter condition Scripture has a meaning. The beginning as well as the end of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyaka-text clearly refers to a meditation on the water used for rinsing as forming a dress for pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a; and as rinsing is already established by Sm<I>ri</I>ti and custom, we naturally infer that what the text enjoins is a meditation on breath as having the water used in rinsing for its dress. This also explains why the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-text does not mention the rinsing at all, but merely the clothing of breath with water.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the statement of what has to be done."</P>
