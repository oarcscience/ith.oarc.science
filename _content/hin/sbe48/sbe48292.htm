<P>46. And Sm<I>ri</I>ti texts declare this.</P>
<P>That the world and Brahman stand to each other in the relation of part and whole, the former being like the light and the latter like the luminous body, or the former being like the power and the latter like that in which the power inheres, or the former being like the body and the latter like the soul; this Par&acirc;<I>s</I>ara also and other Sm<I>ri</I>ti writers declare, 'As the light of a fire which abides in one place only spreads all around, thus this whole world is the power (<I>s</I>akti) of the highest Brahman.' The 'and' in the S&ucirc;tra implies that scriptural texts also ('of whom the Self is the body' and others) declare that the individual Self is a part of Brahman in so far as it is its body.</P>
<P>But if all individual souls are equal in so far as being alike parts of Brahman, alike actuated by Brahman, and alike knowing subjects, what is the reason that, as Scripture teaches, some of them are allowed to read the Veda and act according to its injunctions, while others are excluded therefrom; and again that some are to see, feel, and so on, while others are excluded from these privileges?--This question is answered by the next S&ucirc;tra.</P>
