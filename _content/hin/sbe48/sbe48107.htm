<P>8. And on account of the suitability of the attributes.</P>
<P>The attributes also which the text ascribes to the bh&ucirc;man suit the highest Self only. So immortality ('The Bh&ucirc;man is immortal,' VII, 24, 1); not being based on something else ('it rests in its own greatness'); being the Self of all ('the bh&ucirc;man is below,' &amp;c., 'it is all this'); being that which produces all ('from the Self there springs breath,' &amp;c.). All these attributes can be reconciled with the highest Self only.--The P&ucirc;rvapakshin has pointed to the text which declares the 'I' to be the Self of all (VII, 25, 1); but what that text really teaches is meditation on Brahman under the aspect of the 'I.' This appears from the introductory clause 'Now follows the instruction with regard to the I.' That of the 'I,' i.e. the individual Self, also the highest Self is the true Self, scripture declares in several places, so e.g. in the text about the inward Ruler (B<I>ri</I>. Up. III, 7). As therefore the individual soul finds its completion in the highest Self only, the word 'I' also extends in its connotation up to the highest Self; and the instruction about the 'I' which is given in the text has thus for</P>

<P>its object meditation on the highest Self in so far as having the individual Self for its body. As the highest Self has all beings for its body and thus is the Self of all, it is the Self of the individual soul also; and this the text declares in the passage beginning 'Now follows the instruction about the Self,' and ending 'Self is all this.' In order to prove this the text declares that everything originates from the highest Self which forms the Self of the individual soul also, viz. in the passage 'From the Self of him who sees this, perceives this, knows this, there springs breath,' &amp;c.--that means: breath and all other beings spring from the highest Self which abides within the Self of the meditating devotee as its inner ruler. Hence, the text means to intimate, meditation should be performed on the 'I,' in order thus firmly to establish the cognition that the highest Self has the 'I,' i.e. the individual soul for its body.</P>
<P>It is thus an established conclusion that the bh&ucirc;man is the highest Self. Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'fulness.'</P>
