<P>12. The breath, and so on, on the ground of the complementary passage.</P>
<P>We see from a complementary passage, viz. 'They who know the breath of breath, the eye of the eye, the ear of the ear, the food of food, the mind of mind,' that the 'five-people' are the breath, and eye, and so on, all of which have their abode in Brahman.</P>
<P>But, an objection is raised, while the mantra 'in whom the five five-people,' &amp;c., is common to the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas and the M&acirc;dhyandinas, the complementary passage 'they who know the breath of breath,' &amp;c., in the text of the former makes no mention of food, and hence we have no reason to say that the 'five-people' in their text are the breath, eye, and so on.</P>
<P>To this objection the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</P>
