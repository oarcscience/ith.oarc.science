<P>4. Nor like grass and so on; because (milk) does not exist elsewhere.</P>
<P>This argumentation does not hold good; for as grass and the like do not transform themselves without the guidance of an intelligent principle, your proving instance is not established.--But why is it not established?--'Because it does not exist elsewhere.' If grass, water and so on changed into milk even when consumed by a bull or when not consumed at all, then indeed it might be held that they change without the guidance of an intelligent principle. But nothing of the kind takes place, and hence we conclude that it is the intelligent principle only which turns the grass eaten by the cow into milk.--This point has been set forth above under S&ucirc;tra 3; the present S&ucirc;tra is meant to emphasise and particularise it.</P>
