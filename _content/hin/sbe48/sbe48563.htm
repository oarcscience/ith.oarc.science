<P>12. For this reason B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a (holds him to be) of both kinds; as in the case of the twelve days' sacrifice.</P>
<P>'For this reason,' i.e. for the reason that the text refers to the wish of the Released, the Reverend B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a is of opinion that the Released may, at his liking, be with or without a body. This satisfies both kinds of texts. The case is analogous to that of the twelve days' sacrifice which, on the basis of twofold texts--'Those desirous of prosperity</P>
<P><A NAME="page_764"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 764</FONT></A></P>
<P>are to celebrate the dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha,' and 'The priest is to offer the dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha for him who desires offspring'--belongs, according to difference of wish, either to the sattra or the ah&icirc;na class of sacrifices.--The next S&ucirc;tra declares that the body and the sense-organs of the Released are not necessarily created by the Released himself.</P>
