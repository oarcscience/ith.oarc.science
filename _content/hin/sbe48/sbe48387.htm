<P>3. For (the <I>s</I>irovrata) concerns the mode of the study of the Veda; also on account of (that rite) being a heading in the sam&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ra; and the restriction is like that of the libations.</P>
<P>What the text says as to a restriction connected with the 'vow of the head,' does not intimate a difference of vidy&acirc;s. For that vow does not form part of the vidy&acirc;. The restriction refers only to a peculiarity of the <I>study</I> of the Veda on the part of the &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>ikas, being meant to establish that they should possess that special qualification which the rite produces; but it does not affect the vidy&acirc; itself. This is proved by the subsequent clause, 'a man who has not performed that rite may not <I>read</I> the text,' which directly connects the rite with the studying of the text. And it is further proved by the fact that in the book of the &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>ikas, called 's&acirc;m&acirc;<I>k</I>ara, 'that rite is referred to as a rite connected with the Veda (not with the special vidy&acirc; set forth in the Mu<I>nd</I>aka), viz. in the passage, 'this is explained already by the Veda-observance' (which extends the details of the <I>s</I>irovrata, there called veda-vrata, to other observances). By the <I>knowledge of Brahman</I> (referred to in the Mu<I>nd</I>aka-text 'let a man tell this science of Brahman to those only,' &amp;c.), we have therefore to understand knowledge of the Veda in general. And that restriction is 'like that of the libations'--i.e. it is analogous to the restriction under which the sava-libations, beginning with the Saptas&ucirc;rya-libation, and terminating with the <I>S</I>ataudana-libation, are offered in the one fire which is used by the followers of the Atharvan, and not in the ordinary three fires.</P>
