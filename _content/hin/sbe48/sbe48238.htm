<P>35. And on account of the endurance of the final (size), and the (resulting) permanency of both; there is no difference.</P>
<P>The final size of the soul, i.e. the size it has in the state of Release, is enduring since the soul does not subsequently pass into another body; and both, i.e. the soul in the state of Release and the size of that soul, are permanent (nitya). From this it follows that that ultimate size is the true essential size of the soul and also belongs to it previously to Release. Hence there is no difference of sizes, and the soul cannot therefore have the size of its temporary bodies. The &Acirc;rhata theory is therefore untenable.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the impossibility in one.'</P>
