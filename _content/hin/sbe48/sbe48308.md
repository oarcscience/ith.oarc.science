10\. And there is no objection on account of its not having an activity
(kara*n*a); for (Scripture) thus declares.

The kara*n*a of the Sûtra means kriyâ, action. The objection raised on
the ground that the principal breath does not exercise any form of
activity helpful to the soul, is without force, since as a matter of
fact Scripture declares that there is such an activity, in so far as the
vital breath supports the body with all its organs. For the text (*Kh*.
Up. V, 1, 7 ff.) relates how on the successive departure of speech, and
so on, the body and the other organs maintained their strength, while on
the departure of the vital breath the body and all the organs at once
became weak and powerless.--The conclusion therefore is that the breath,
in its fivefold form of prâ*n*a, apâna, and so on, subserves the
purposes of the individual soul, and thus occupies the position of an
instrument, no less than the eye and the other organs.

But as those five forms of breath, viz. prâ*n*a, udâna, &c., have
different names and functions they must be separate principles (and
hence there is not *one* principal breath)! To this the next Sûtra
replies.
