<P>50. What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as this is seen.</P>
<P>Knowledge, as enjoined by Scripture, is twofold, having</P>

<P>for its fruit either exaltation within the sphere of the Sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra, or final Release. With regard to the former the question arises whether it springs up only immediately subsequent to the good works which are the means to bring it about; or, indefinitely, either subsequent to such works or at some later time.--The P&ucirc;rvapakshin holds the former view. A man reaches knowledge through his good deeds only, as the Lord himself declares, 'Four kinds of men doing good works worship me,' &amp;c.(Bha. G&icirc;. VII, 16); and when those works have been accomplished there is no reason why the result, i.e. knowledge, should be delayed.--This view the S&ucirc;tra disposes of. 'What is comprised in this world,' i.e. meditation, the result of which is worldly exaltation, springs up immediately after the works to which it is due, in case of there being no other works of greater strength obstructing the rise of knowledge; but if there is an obstruction of the latter kind, knowledge springs up later on only. 'For this is seen,' i.e. Scripture acknowledges the effects of such obstruction; for a statement such as ' what he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad that is more vigorous,' means that works joined with the knowledge of the Udg&icirc;tha, and so on, produce their results without obstruction (which implies that the action of other works is liable to be obstructed).--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'what belongs to this world.'</P>
