<P>8. If that be declared on account of name; (we object, since) that is also (where the objects of injunction differ).</P>
<P>If the oneness of the vidy&acirc;s be maintained on the ground that both have the same name, viz. udg&icirc;tha-vidy&acirc;, we point out that oneness is found also where the objects enjoined are different. The term agnihotra is applied equally to the permanent agnihotra and to that agnihotra which forms part of the sacrifice called 'Ku<I>nd</I>ap&acirc;yin&acirc;m ayanam'; and the term udg&icirc;tha is applied equally to the many different meditations described in the first prap&acirc;<I>th</I>aka of the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya.</P>
