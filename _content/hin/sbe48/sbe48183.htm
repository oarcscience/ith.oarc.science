<P>13. Thereby also the remaining (theories) which are not comprised (within the Veda) are explained.</P>
<P>Not comprised means those theories which are not known to be comprised within (countenanced by) the Veda. The S&ucirc;tra means to say that by the demolition given above of the S&acirc;<U>n</U>khya doctrine which is not comprised within the Veda the remaining theories which are in the same position, viz. the theories of Ka<I>n</I>&acirc;da, Akshap&acirc;da, <I>G</I>ina, and Buddha, must likewise be considered as demolished.</P>
<P>Here, however, a new objection may be raised, on the ground namely that, since all these theories agree in the view of atoms constituting the general cause, it cannot be said that their reasoning as to the causal substance is ill-founded.--They indeed, we reply, are agreed to that extent, but they are all of them equally founded on Reasoning only, and they are seen to disagree in many ways as to the nature of the atoms which by different schools are held to be either fundamentally void or non-void,</P>

<P>having either a merely cognitional or an objective existence, being either momentary or permanent, either of a definite nature or the reverse, either real or unreal, &amp;c. This disagreement proves all those theories to be ill-founded, and the objection is thus disposed of.--Here finishes the section of 'the remaining (theories) non-comprised (within the Veda).'</P>
