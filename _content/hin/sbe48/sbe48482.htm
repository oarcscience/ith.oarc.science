<P>Texts such as 'By works of sacred duty he drives away evil' declare that sacrifices and similar works have the effect of knowledge 'not being overpowered,' i.e. of the origination of knowledge not being obstructed by evil works.

This proves that the works are the same in either case.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the being enjoined' (of sacrifices, and so on).</P>
