<P>50. And by a subsequent (Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a) also the 'being of such a kind' of the word (is proved). But the connexion is on account of plurality.</P>
<P>The subsequent Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (<I>S</I>at. Br. X, 5, 4) also proves that the text treating of the altars made of mind, and so on, enjoins a meditation only. For that Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (which begins 'This brick-built fire-altar is this world; the waters are its enclosing-stones,' &amp;c.) declares further on 'whosoever knows this thus comes to be that whole Agni who is the space-filler,' and from this it appears that what is enjoined there is a meditation with a special result of its own. And further on (X, 6) there is another meditation enjoined, viz. one on Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara. All this shows that the Agnirahasya book (<I>S</I>at. Br. X) is not solely concerned with the injunction of outward sacrificial acts.--But what then is the reason that such matters as the mental (meditative) construction of fire-altars which ought to be included in the B<I>ri</I>had-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka are included in the Agnirahasya?--'That connexion is on account of plurality,' i.e. the altars made of mind, and so on, are, in the sacred text, dealt with in proximity to the real altar made of bricks, because so many details of the latter are mentally to be accomplished in the meditation.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'option with the previous one.'</P>
