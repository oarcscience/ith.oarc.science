<P>13. Not so, on account of non-specification.</P>
<P>Nor is it true that the text 'Doing works here,' &amp;c., is meant to divert him who knows the Self from knowledge and restrict him to works. For there is no special reason to hold that that text refers to works as independent means of a desirable result: it may as well be understood to refer to works merely subordinate to knowledge. As he who knows the Self has to practise meditation as long as he lives, he may also have to practise, for the same period, works that are helpful to meditation. Having thus refuted the objection on the ground of the reason of the matter, the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra proceeds to give his own interpretation of the text.</P>
