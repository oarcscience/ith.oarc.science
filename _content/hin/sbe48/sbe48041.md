The Pradhâna is not the cause of the world for the following reason
also:

8\. And because there is no statement of its having to be set aside.

If the word 'Sat' denoted the Pradhâna as the cause of the world, we
should expect the text to teach that the idea of having his Self in that
'Sat' should be set aside by *S*vetaketu as desirous of Release; for
that idea would be contrary to Release. So far from teaching this, the
text, however, directly inculcates that notion in the words 'Thou art
that.'--The next Sûtra adds a further reason.
