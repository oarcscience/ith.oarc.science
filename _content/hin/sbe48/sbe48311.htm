<P>13. But the rule (over the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as) on the part of Fire and the rest, together with him to whom the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a belong (i.e. the soul), is owing to the thinking of that (viz. the highest Self); on account of scriptural statement.</P>

<P>It has been shown that the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, together with the main pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, originate from Brahman, and have a limited size. That the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as are guided by Agni and other divine beings has also been explained on a previous occasion, viz. under S&ucirc;. II, 1, 5. And it is known from ordinary experience that the organs are ruled by the individual soul, which uses them as means of experience and fruition. And this is also established by scriptural texts, such as 'Having taken these pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as he (i.e. the soul) moves about in his own body, according to his pleasure'(B<I>ri</I>. Up. II, 1, 18). The question now arises whether the rule of the soul and of the presiding divine beings over the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as depends on them (i.e. the soul and the divinities) only, or on some other being.--On them only, since they depend on no one else!--Not so, the S&ucirc;tra declares. The rule which light, and so on, i.e. Agni and the other divinities, together with him to whom the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as belong i.e. the soul, exercise over the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as, proceeds from the thinking of that, i.e. from the will of the highest Self.--How is this known?--'From scriptural statement.' For Scripture teaches that the organs, together with their guiding divinities and the individual soul, depend in all their doings on the thought of the highest Person. 'He, who abiding within Fire, rules Fire from within.--He, who abiding within the air--within the Self--within the eye, and so on' (B<I>ri</I>. Up III, 7); 'From fear of it the wind blows, from fear of it the sun rises, from fear of it Agni and Indra, yea Death runs as the fifth' (Taitt. Up. II, 8, 1); 'By the command of that Imperishable one, sun and moon stand, held apart'(B<I>ri</I> Up III, 8, 9).</P>
