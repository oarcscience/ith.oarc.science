<P>15. They, with the exception of the best, are organs, on account of being so designated.</P>
<P>Are all principles called pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as to be considered as 'organs' (indriy&acirc;<I>n</I>i), or is the 'best,' i.e. the chief pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, to be excepted?--All of them, without exception, are organs; for they all are called pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as equally, and they all are instruments of the soul.--Not so, the S&ucirc;tra replies. The 'best' one is to be excepted, since only the prawas other than the best are designated as organs. Texts such as 'the organs are ten and one' (Bha. G&icirc;. XIII, 5) apply the term 'organ' only to the senses of sight and the rest, and the internal organ.</P>
