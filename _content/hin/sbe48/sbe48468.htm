<P>21. If it be said that they are mere glorification, on account of their reference; not so, on account of the newness.</P>
<P>The following point is next enquired into. Are texts such as 'That Udg&icirc;tha is the best of all essences, the highest, holding the supreme place, the eighth' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. I, 1, 3) meant to glorify the Udg&icirc;tha as a constituent element of the sacrifice, or to enjoin a meditation on the Udg&icirc;tha as the best of all essences, and so on? The P&ucirc;rvapakshin holds the former view, on the ground that the text declares the Udg&icirc;tha to be the best of all essences in so far as being a constituent element of the sacrifice. The case is analogous to that of texts such as 'the ladle is this earth, the &acirc;havan&icirc;ya is the heavenly world,' which are merely meant to glorify the ladle and the rest as constituent members of the sacrifice.--This view the latter part of the S&ucirc;tra sets aside 'on account of newness.'</P>
<P><A NAME="page_697"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 697</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Texts, as the one referring to the Udg&icirc;tha, cannot be mere glorifications; for the fact of the Udg&icirc;tha being the best of essences is not established by any other means of proof, and the text under discussion cannot therefore be understood as a mere anuv&acirc;da, meant for glorification. Nor is there, in proximity, any injunction of the Udg&icirc;tha on account of connexion with which the clause declaring the Udg&icirc;tha to be the best of all essences could naturally be taken as an anuv&acirc;da (glorifying the thing previously enjoined in the injunctive text); while there is such an injunction in connexion with the (anuv&acirc;da) text 'The ladle is this earth,' and so on. We thus cannot but arrive at the conclusion that the text is meant to enjoin a meditation on the Udg&icirc;tha as being the best of all essences, and so on--the fruit of such meditation being an increase of vigour and efficacy on the part of the sacrifice.</P>
