<P>26. If it be objected that (Brahman is) not (denoted) on account of the metre being denoted; (we reply) not so, because thus the direction of the mind (on Brahman) is declared; for thus it is seen.</P>
<P>The previous section at first refers to the metre called G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, 'The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; indeed is everything' (III, 12, 1), and then introduces--with the words 'this is also declared by a <I>Rik</I> verse'--the verse, 'Such is the greatness of it (viz. the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;),' &amp;c. Now, as this verse also refers to the metre, there is not any reference to the highest Person.--To this objection the second part of the S&ucirc;tra replies. The word 'G&acirc;yatr&icirc;' does not here denote the metre only, since this cannot possibly be the Self of all; but the text declares the application of the idea of G&acirc;yatr&icirc; to Brahman, i.e. teaches, to the end of a certain result being obtained, meditation on Brahman in so far as similar to G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. For Brahman having four feet, in the sense indicated by the <I>rik</I>, may be compared to the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; with its four (metrical) feet. The G&acirc;yatr&icirc; (indeed has as a rule three feet, but) occasionally a G&acirc;yatr&icirc; with four feet is met with; so, e.g., 'Indra<I>s</I> <I>s</I>a<I>k</I>&icirc;pati<I>h</I> | valena p&icirc;<I>d</I>ita<I>h</I> | du<I>sk</I>yavano v<I>ri</I>sh&acirc; | samitsu s&acirc;sahi<I>h</I>.' We see that in other passages also words primarily denoting metres are employed in other senses; thus, e.g., in the sa<I>m</I>vargavidy&acirc; (<I>Kh</I>. Up. IV, 3, 8), where Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> (the name of a metre of ten syllables) denotes a group of ten divine beings.</P>

<P>For this conclusion the next S&ucirc;tra supplies a further argument.</P>
