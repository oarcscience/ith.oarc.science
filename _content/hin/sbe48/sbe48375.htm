<P>31. But on account of resemblance.</P>
<P>The 'but' sets aside the p&ucirc;rvapaksha. There is no truth in the assertion that from the designation of the Highest as a biidge (or bank) it follows that there is something beyond the Highest. For Brahman in that text is not called a bank with regard to something to be reached thereby; since the additional clause 'for the non-confounding of these worlds' declares that it is compared to a bridge or bank in so far as it binds to itself (<I>setu</I> being derived from <I>si</I>, to bind) the whole aggregate of sentient and non-sentient things without any confusion. And in the clause 'having passed beyond that bridge' the <I>passing beyond</I> means <I>reaching</I>; as we say, 'he passes beyond the VedAnta,' meaning 'he has fully mastered it.'</P>
