<P>41. There is non-restriction of determination, because this is seen; for there is a separate fruit, viz. non-obstruction.</P>
<P>There are certain meditations connected with elements of sacrificial actions; as e.g. 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om as udg&icirc;tha.' These meditations are subordinate elements of the sacrificial acts with which they connect themselves through the udg&icirc;tha and so on, in the same way as the quality of being made of par<I>n</I>a wood connects itself with the sacrifice through the ladle (made of par<I>n</I>a wood), and are to be undertaken on that very account. Moreover the statement referring to these meditations, viz. 'whatever he does with knowledge, with faith, with the Upanishad, that becomes more vigorous,' does not allow the assumption of a special fruit for these meditations (apart from the fruit of the sacrificial performance); while in the case of the ladle being made of par<I>n</I>a wood the text mentions a special fruit ('he whose ladle is made of par<I>n</I>a wood does not hear an evil sound'). The meditations in question are therefore necessarily to be connected with the particular sacrificial performances to which they belong.--This view the S&ucirc;tra refutes, 'There is non-restriction with regard to the determinations.' By 'determination' we have here to understand the definite settling of the mind in a certain direction, in other words, meditation. The meditations on the udg&icirc;tha and so on are not definitely connected with the sacrificial performances; 'since that is seen,' i.e. since the texts themselves declare that there is no such necessary connexion; cp. the text, 'therefore both perform the sacrificial work, he who thus knows it</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> (i. e. who possesses the knowledge implied in the meditations on the sacrifice), as well as he who does not know'--which declares that he also who does not know the meditations may perform the work. Were these meditations auxiliary elements of the works, there could be no such absence of necessary connexion (as declared in this text). It thus being determined that they are not auxiliary elements, a special result must be assigned to the injunction of meditation, and this we find in the greater strength which is imparted to the sacrifice by the meditation, and which is a result different from the result of the sacrifice itself. The <I>greater strength</I> of the performance consists herein, that its result is not impeded, as it might be impeded, by the result of some other performance of greater force. This result, viz. absence of obstruction, is something apart from the general result of the action, such as the reaching of the heavenly world, and so on. This the S&ucirc;tra means when saying, 'for separate is non-obstruction.' As thus those meditations also which refer to auxiliary members of sacrifices have their own results, they may or may not be combined with the sacrifices, according to wish. Their case is like that of the godohana vessel which, with the view of obtaining a certain special result, may be used instead of the <I>k</I>amasa.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'non-restriction of determination.'</P>
