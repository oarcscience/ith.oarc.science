<P>22. There is entering into similarity of being with those, there being a reason.</P>
<P>The text describes the manner in which those who perform sacrifices, and so on, descend from the moon as follows: 'They return again that way as they came, to the ether, from the ether to the air. Then having become air they become smoke, having become smoke they become mist,' &amp;c. The doubt here arises whether the soul when reaching ether, and so on, becomes ether in the same sense as here on earth it becomes a man or other being, or merely becomes similar to ether, and so on.--The former view is the true one; for as the soul in the <I>s</I>raddh&acirc; state becomes the moon, so it must likewise be held to <I>become</I> ether, and so on, there being no reason for a difference in the two cases.--This prim&acirc; facie view the S&ucirc;tra sets aside. The descending soul enters into similarity of being with ether, and so on; since there is a reason for this. When the soul becomes a man or becomes the moon, there is a reason for that, since it thereby becomes capacitated for the enjoyment of pain and pleasure. But there is no similar reason for the soul becoming ether, and so on, and hence the statement that the soul becomes ether, and so on, can only mean that, owing to contact with them, it becomes similar to them.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'entering into similarity of being.'</P>
