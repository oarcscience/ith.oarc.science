'The internal organ called Pradyumna originates from
Sa<u>n</u>karsha*n*a,' i. e. the internal organ originates from the
individual soul which is the agent. But this is inadmissible, since the
text 'from him there is produced breath, mind, and all sense-organs'
(Mu. Up. II, 1, 3) declares that the mind also springs from none else
but the highest Brahman. As the Bhâgavata doctrine thus teaches things
opposed to Scripture, its authoritativeness cannot be admitted.--Against
these objections the next Sûtra declares itself.
