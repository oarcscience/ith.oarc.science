30\. And (the divinity is) endowed with all powers, because that is
seen.

The highest divinity which is different in nature from all other things
is endowed with all powers; for scriptural texts show it to be such,
'His high power is revealed as manifold, as essential, and so his
knowledge, force, and action' (*S*vet. Up. VI, 8). In the same way
another text first declares the highest divinity to differ in nature
from everything else, 'Free from sin, from old age, from death and
grief, from hunger and thirst',and then goes on to represent it as
endowed with all powers, 'realising all its wishes, realising all its
intentions',&c.(*Kh*. Up. VIII, 1, 5). Compare also 'He, consisting of
mind, having pra*n*a for his body, whose form is light, who realises his
wishes,' &c. (*Kh*. Up. III, 14, 2).
