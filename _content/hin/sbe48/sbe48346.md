who sleep, shaping one desired thing (kâma) after the other.' The term
'kâma' there denotes not mere desires, but such things as sons and the
like which are objects of desire. For sons and so on are introduced as
'kâmas' in previous passages: 'Ask for all kâmas according to thy wish';
'Choose sons and grandsons living a hundred years' (Ka. Up. I, 1, 25;
23). The individual soul thus creates chariots, and so on, in its
dreams. That the soul has the power of realising all its

wishes is known from the declaration of Pra*g*âpati. It is therefore
able to create, even in the absence of special instruments.--This view
is set aside by the next Sûtra.
