12\. And (it is) minute.

This prâ*n*a also is minute, since as before (i.e. as in the case of the
organs) the text declares it to pass out of the body, to move, and so
on, 'him when he passes out the prâ*n*a follows after' (B*ri*. Up. V, 4,
2). A further doubt arises, in the case of prâ*n*a, owing to the fact
that in other texts it is spoken of as of large extent, 'It is equal to
these three worlds, equal to this Universe' (B*ri*. Up. I, 3, 22); 'On
prâ*n*a everything is founded'; 'For all this is shut up in prâ*n*a.'
But as the texts declaring the passing out, and so on, of the prâ*n*a,
prove it to be of limited size, the all-embracingness ascribed to
prâ*n*a in those other texts must be interpreted to mean only that the
life of all living and breathing creatures depends on breath.--Here
terminates the adhikara*n*a of 'the minuteness of the best.'
