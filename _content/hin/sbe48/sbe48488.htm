<P>41. Nor the (expiatory performance) described in the chapter treating of qualification; that being impossible on account of the Sm<I>ri</I>ti referring to such lapse.</P>
<P>Those expiatory performances which are described in the chapter treating of qualification (P&ucirc;. M&icirc;. S&ucirc;. VI) are not possible in the case of him who has lapsed from the condition of a Naish<I>th</I>ika; since such expiations do not apply to him, as is shown by a Sm<I>ri</I>ti text referring to such lapse, viz. 'He who having once entered on the duties of a Naish<I>th</I>ika lapses from them, for such a slayer of the Self I do not see any expiatory work by which he might become clean.' The expiatory ceremony referred to in the P&ucirc;rva Mim&acirc;<I>m</I>s&acirc; therefore applies to the case of other Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins only.</P>
