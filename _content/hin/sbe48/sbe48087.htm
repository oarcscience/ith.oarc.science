<P>21. For both also speak of it as something different.</P>
<P>Both, i.e. the M&acirc;dhyandinas as well as the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas, distinguish in their texts the embodied soul, together with speech and other non-intelligent things, from the Ruler within, representing it as an object of his rule. The M&acirc;dhyandinas read, 'He who dwells in the Self, whom the Self does not know,' &amp;c.; the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas, 'He who dwells</P>

<P>within understanding', &amp;c. The declaration of the individual Self being ruled by the Ruler within implies of course the declaration of the former being different from the latter.</P>
<P>The conclusion from all this is that the Ruler within is a being different from the individual soul, viz. the highest Self free from all evil, N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the internal Ruler'.</P>
