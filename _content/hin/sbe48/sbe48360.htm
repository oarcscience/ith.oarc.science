<P>16. And (the text) says so much only.</P>
<P>Moreover the text 'the True, knowledge, infinite is Brahman' only teaches that Brahman has light for its essential nature, and does not negative those other attributes of Brahman--omniscience, being the cause of the world, &amp;c.--which are intimated by other texts. What is the object of the negation in 'not so, not so' will be shown further on.</P>
