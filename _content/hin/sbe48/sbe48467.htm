<P>20. Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying.</P>
<P>As the second part of the text 'Let him approach carrying the firewood below the ladle; for above he carries</P>
<P><A NAME="page_696"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 696</FONT></A></P>
<P>it for the gods' (which refers to a certain form of the Agnihotra), although having the form of an anuv&acirc;da, yet must be interpreted as an injunction, since the carrying of firewood above is not established by any other injunction; so the text under discussion also must be taken as an injunction of the different stages of life (which are not formally enjoined elsewhere). No account being taken of the text of the <I>G</I>&acirc;b&acirc;las, 'Having completed his studentship he is to become a householder,' &amp;c., it is thus a settled conclusion that the texts discussed, although primarily concerned with other topics, must at the same time be viewed as proving the validity of the several conditions of life. From this it follows that the text enjoining the performance of the Agnihotra up to the end of life, and similar texts, are not universally binding, but concern those only who do not retire from worldly life.--The final conclusion therefore is that as the knowledge of Brahman is enjoined on those who lead a life of austerity (which does not require the performance of sacrifices and the like), it is not subordinate to works, but is in itself beneficial to man.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'benefit to man.'</P>
