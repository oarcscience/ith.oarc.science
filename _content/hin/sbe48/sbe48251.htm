<P>5. The non-abandonment of the promissory statement (results) from non-difference.</P>
<P>It is not appropriate to assume, from deference to the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-text, a secondary meaning for those other texts also which declare Ether to have originated. For the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogyaitself virtually admits the origination of Ether; in so far, namely, as the clause 'that by which the non-heard is heard,' &amp;c., declares that through the knowledge of Brahman everything is known. This declaration is not abandoned, i.e. is adhered to, only if the Ether also is an effect of Brahman and thus non-different from it.</P>
