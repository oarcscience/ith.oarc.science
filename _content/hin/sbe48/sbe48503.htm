<P>6. And the ideas of &Acirc;ditya and the rest on the member; on account of this being rational.</P>
<P>'He who shines up there let a man meditate on him as the Udg&icirc;tha' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. I, 3, 1).--With regard to this and similar meditations connected with subordinate parts of sacrificial performances there arises the doubt whether</P>
<P><A NAME="page_720"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 720</FONT></A></P>
<P>the idea of &Acirc;ditya and so on has to be superimposed on the subordinate part of the sacrifice, such as the Udg&icirc;tha, or vice vers&acirc; (i.e. whether &Acirc;ditya should be meditated upon under the aspect of the Udg&icirc;tha, or vice vers&acirc;).--The P&ucirc;rvapakshin holds the former view. For the general principle is that the lower being should be viewed under the aspect of the higher, and the Udg&icirc;tha and so on, which are parts of the sacrifices through which certain results are effected, are superior to the divinities who do not accomplish any result.--Of this view the S&ucirc;tra disposes. The ideas of &Acirc;ditya and so on are to be superimposed on the 'members,' i.e. the Udg&icirc;tha and so on, which are constituent members of the sacrifices; because of the gods only superiority can be established. For it is only through the propitiation of the gods that sacrifices are capable of bringing about their results. The Udg&icirc;tha and the rest therefore are to be viewed under the aspect of &Acirc;ditya and so on.--Here terminates the adhikara<I>n</I>a of 'the ideas of &Acirc;ditya and so on.'</P>
