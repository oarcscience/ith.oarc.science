<A HREF="sbe48009">There is no proof of non-differenced substance</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48010">Sabda proves difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48011">Pratyaksha--even of the nirvikalpaka kind--proves difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48012">The bhed&acirc;bheda view is untenable</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48013">Inference also teaches difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48014">Perception does not reveal mere being</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48015">Plurality is not unreal</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48016">Being and consciousness are not one</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48017">The true meaning of Svayamprak&acirc;satva</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48018">Consciousness is not eternal</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48019">There is no consciousness without object</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48020">Consciousness is capable of change</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48021">Consciousness is the attribute of a permanent Conscious self</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48022">The view that the conscious subject is something unreal, due to the ahamk&acirc;ra, cannot be maintained</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48023">The conscious subject persists in deep sleep</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48024">The conscious subject persists in the state of release</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48025">In cases of Scripture conflicting with Perception, Scripture is not stronger. The True cannot be known through the Untrue</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48026">No scriptural texts teach a Brahman devoid of all difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48027">Nor do Smriti and Pur&acirc;na teach such a doctrine</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48028">The theory of Nescience cannot be proved</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48029">All knowledge is of the Real</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48030">Neither Scripture nor Smriti and Pur&acirc;na teach Nescience</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48031"> Scripture does not teach that Release is due to the knowledge of a non-qualified Brahman.--the meaning of 'tat tvam asi.'</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48032">Summary statement as to the way in which different scriptural texts are to reconciled</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48033">Nescience cannot be terminated by the simple act of cognising Brahman as the universal self</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48034">The Ved&acirc;ntin aiming to ascertain the nature of Brahman from Scripture,...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48035">2. Brahman is that from which the origin of this world proceed</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48036">3. Because Scripture is the source of the knowledge of Brahman</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48037">4. The connexion of Scripture with the highest aim of man</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48038">5. Seeing that which is not founded on Scripture...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48039">6. ...the word 'seeing' has a secondary (figurative) meaning</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48040">7. Because release is taught of him who takes his stand on it</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48041">8. And because there is no statement of its having to be set aside</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48042">9. And on account of the contradiction of the initial statement</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48043">10. On account of (the individual soul) going to the Self</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48044">11. On account of the uniformity of view</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48045">12. And because it is directly stated in Scripture</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48046">13. The Self consisting of Bliss is the highest Self on account of multiplication</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48047">14. If, on account of its being a word denoting an effect...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48048">15. And because he is declared to be the cause of thatra</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48049">16. And because that (Brahman) which is referred to in the mantra...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48050">17. Not the other, on account of impossibility</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48051">18. And on account of the declaration of difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48052">19. And on account of desire, there is no regard to what is inferred</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48053">20. And Scripture teaches the joining of this with that</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48054">21. The one within the sun and the eye...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48055">22. And on account of the declaration of difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48056">23. Ether is Brahman...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48057">24. For the same reason breath is Brahman</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48058">25. The light is Brahman...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48059">26. If it be objected that Brahman is not denoted...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48060">27. And thus also, because thus only the designation of the beings...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48061">28. If it be said that Brahman is not recognised...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48062">29. Pr&acirc;na is Brahman...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48063">30. If it be said that Brahman is not denoted...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48064">31. The instruction given by Indra about himself...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48065">32. If it be said that Brahman is not meant...</A><BR>

<A HREF="sbe48066">Second P&acirc;da</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48067">1. Everywhere; because there is taught what is known</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48068">2. And because the qualities meant to be stated are possible in Brahman</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48069">3. But, on account of impossibility, not the embodied soul</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48070">4. And because there is (separate) denotation of the object and the agent</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48071">5. On account of the difference of words</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48072">6. And on account of Smriti</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48073">7. Should it be said that the passage does not refer to Brahman...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48074">8. Should it be said that there is attainment of fruition...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48075">9. The eater is the highest Self on account of there being taken all that is movable and immovable</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48076">10. And on account of the topic of the whole section</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48077">11. The two entered into the cave...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48078">12. And on account of distinctive qualities</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48079">13. The Person within the eye is the highest Self...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48080">14. And on account of the statement as to abode...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48081">15. And on account of the text referring only to what is characterised by pleasure</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48082">16. For that very reason that ether is Brahman</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48083">17. And on account of the statement of the way of him who has heard the Upanishads</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48084">18. Not any other, on account of non-permanency of abode, and of impossibility</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48085">19. The internal Ruler ... is the highest Self</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48086">20. And not that which Smriti assumes...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48087">21. For both also speak of it as something different</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48088">22. That which possesses the qualities of invisibility...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48089">23. Not the two others, on account of distinction and statement of difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48090">24. And on account of the description of its form</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48091">25. Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara is the highest Self...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48092">26. That which the text refers to is an inferential mark--thus</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48093">27. Should it be said that it is not so, on account of the word...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48094">28. For the same reasons not the divinity and the element</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48095">29. Gaimini thinks that there is no objection to the word 'Agni'...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48096">30. On account of definiteness; thus &Acirc;smarathya opines</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48097">31. On account of meditation, B&acirc;dari thinks</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48098">32. On account of imaginative identification, thus Gaimini thinks...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48099">33. Moreover, they record him in that</A><BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Third P&acirc;da</H3>
<A HREF="sbe48100">Third P&acirc;da: 1. The abode of heaven, earth is the highest Self...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48101">2. And on account of its being declared that to which the released have to resort</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48102">3. Not that which is inferred...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48103">4. On account of the declaration of difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48104">5. On account of the subject-matter</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48105">6. And on account of abiding and eating</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48106">7. The bh&ucirc;man is the highest Self</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48107">8. And on account of the suitability of the attributes</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48108">9. The Imperishable is Brahman, on account of its supporting that which is the end of ether</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48109">10. And this supporting springs from command...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48110">11. And on account of the exclusion of what is of another nature than Brahman</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48111">12. On account of his being designated as the object of seeing, the highest Self is that object</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48112">13. The small ether is Brahman...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48113">14. On account of the going and of the word...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48114">15. And on account of there being observed in that small ether...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48115">16. And on account of the settled meaning</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48116">17. If it be said that on account of reference to the other one he is meant; we say no...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48117">18. ... the soul in so far as its true nature has become manifest</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48118">19. And the reference has a different meaning</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48119">20. If it be said, owing to the scriptural declaration of smallness...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48120">21. And on account of the imitation of that</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48121">22. The same is declared by Smriti also</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48122">23. On account of the term, the one measured</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48123">24. But with reference to the heart, men being qualified</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48124">25. Also beings above them, i.e. men...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48125">26. If it be said that there results a contradiction to work; we deny this</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48126">27. If it be said that a contradiction will result with regard to words...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48127">28. And for this very reason eternity of the Veda</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48128">29. And on account of the equality of names and forms there is no contradiction...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48129">30. On account of the impossibility of qualification...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48130">31. And on account of (meditating on the part of the gods) being in the Light</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48131">33. That grief of him arose...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48132">34. And on account of G&acirc;na<I>s</I>ruti kshattriya-hood being understood</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48133">35. On account of the inferential sign further on...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48134">36. On account of the reference to ceremonial purifications...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48135">37. And on account of the procedure, on the ascertainment of the non-being of that</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48136">38. And on account of the prohibition of hearing, studying, and performance of (Vedic) matter</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48137">39. And on account of Smriti</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48138">40. On account of the trembling</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48139">41. On account of light being seen</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48140">42. The ether, on account of the designation of something different, and so on</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48141">43. On account of difference in deep sleep and departing</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48142">44. And on account of such words as Lord</A><BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Fourth P&acirc;da</H3>
<A HREF="sbe48143">Fourth P&acirc;da: 1. If it be said that some mention that which rests on Inference ...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48144">2. But the subtle body, on account of its capability</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48145">3. Matter in its subtle state subserves an end...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48146">4. And on account of there being no statement of its being an object of knowledge</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48147">5. ... the intelligent Self is meant...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48148">6. And of three only there is this mention and question</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48149">7. And as in the case of the 'Great.'</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48150">8. On account of there being no special characteristic; as in the case of the cup</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48151">9. But she begins with light; for thus some read in their text</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48152">10. And on account of the teaching of formation ... there is no contradiction; as in the case of the honey</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48153">11. Not from the mention of the number even, on account of the diversity and of the excess</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48154">12. The breath, and so on, on the ground of the complementary passage</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48155">13. By light, food not being mentioned in the text of some</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48156">14. And on account of Brahman as described being declared to be the cause with regard to Ether, and so on</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48157">15. From connexion</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48158">16. Because it denotes the world</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48159">17....the inferential marks of the individual soul and the chief vital air</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48160">18. But Gaimini thinks that it has another purport...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48161">19. On account of the connected meaning of the sentences</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48162">20. It is a mark indicating that the promissory statement is proved...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48163">21. Because (the soul) when it will depart is such; thus Audulomi thinks</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48164">22. On account of Brahman's abiding within the individual soul...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48165">23. Brahman is the material cause...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48166">24. And on account of the statement of reflection</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48167">25. And on account of both being directly declared</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48168">26. On account of the Self making itself</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48169">27. Owing to modification</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48170">28. And because it is called the womb</A><BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">First P&acirc;da</H3>
<A HREF="sbe48172">First P&acirc;da: 1. ... want of room for other Smritis</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48173">2. And on account of the non-perception of truth on the part of others</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48174">3. Hereby the Yoga is refuted</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48175">4. Not, on account of the difference of character of that; and its being such (appears) from Scripture</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48176">5. But there is denotation of the superintending deities, on account of distinction and entering</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48177">7. If it be said that the effect is non-existing; we say no</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48178">8. On account of such consequences in reabsorption the Ved&acirc;nta-texts would be inappropriate</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48179">9. Not so; as there are parallel instances</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48180">10. And on account of the objections to his view</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48181">11. Also in consequence of the ill-foundedness of reasoning</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48182">12. Should it be said that inference is to be carried on in a different way...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48183">13. Thereby also the remaining theories which are not comprised within the Veda are explained</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48184">14. If it be said that from Brahman becoming an enjoyer...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48185">15. The non-difference of the world from that Brahman...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48186">16. And because (the cause) is perceived in the existence of the effect</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48187">17. And on account of the existence of that which is posterior</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48188">19. And like a piece of cloth</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48189">20. And as the different vital airs</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48190">21. From the designation of the 'other' as non-different from Brahman...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48191">22. But Brahman is additional, on account of the declaration of difference</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48192">23. And as in the analogous case of stones and the like, there is impossibility of that</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48193">24. ... as in the case of milk</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48194">25. And as in the case of the gods...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48195">26. Or the consequence of the entire Brahman entering into the effect...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48196">27. But on account of Scripture; Brahman's possession of various powers being founded upon the word</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48197">28. And thus in the Self; for there are manifold powers</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48198">29. And on account of the defects of his view also</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48199">30. And the divinity is endowed with all powers, because that is seen</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48200">31. Not, on account of the absence of organs...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48201">32. Brahman is not the cause; on account of the world having the nature of what depends on a motive</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48202">33. But it is mere sport, as in ordinary life</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48203">34. Not inequality and cruelty...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48204">35. If it be said 'not so, on account of non-distinction of deeds'...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48205">36. And because all the attributes are proved to be present in Brahman</A><BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Second P&acirc;da</H3>
<A HREF="sbe48206">Second P&acirc;da: 1. Not that which is inferred, on account of the impossibility of construction, and on account of activity</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48207">2. If it be said--like milk or water; there also intelligence guides</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48208">3. And because from the independence of the Pradh&acirc;na there would follow the non-existence of what is different from creation</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48209">4. Nor like grass and so on; because milk does not exist elsewhere</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48210">5. And if you say--as the man and the stone; thus also</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48211">6. And on account of the impossibility of the relation of principal and subordinate matter</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48212">7. And if another inference be made the result remains unchanged...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48213">8. And even if it be admitted; on account of the absence of a purpose</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48214">9. And it is objectionable on account of the contradictions</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48215">10. Or in the same way as the big and long from the short and the atomic</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48216">11. On both assumptions also there is no motion, and thence non-being of the origination of the world</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48217">12. And because owing to the acknowledgment of samav&acirc;ya, there results a regressus in infinitum from equality</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48218">13. And because the world also would thus be eternal</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48219">14. And on account of the atoms having colour</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48220">15. And as there are objections in both cases</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48221">16. And as it is not accepted, it is altogether disregarded</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48222">17. Even on the aggregate with its two causes...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48223">18. If it be said that this is to be explained through successive causality...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48224">19. And on account of the cessation of the preceding...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48225">20. There not being a cause, there results contradiction...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48226">21. There is non-establishment...</A><BR>

<A HREF="sbe48457">10. (It is) non-comprehensive</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48458">11. There is distribution, as in the case of the hundred</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48459">12. Of him who has merely read the Veda</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48460">13. Not so, on account of non-specification</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48461">14. Or the permission is for the purpose of glorification</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48462">15. Some also, by proceeding according to their liking</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48463">16. And destruction</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48464">17. And of him who is chaste...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48465">18. A reference only ... on account of absence of injunction</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48466">19. It is to be accomplished, ... on account of scriptural statement of equality</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48467">20. Or an injunction, as in the case of the carrying</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48468">21. If it be said that they are mere glorification, on account of their reference; not so, on account of the newness</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48469">22. And on account of the words denoting becoming</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48470">23. .. the stories told in the Upanishads ...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48471">24. This follows also from the textual connexion of those stories with injunctions</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48472">25. For this very reason there is no need of the lighting of the fire...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48473">26. And there is need of all works...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48474">27. But all the same he must be possessed of calmness...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48475">28. And there is permission of all food in the case of danger of life ...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48476">29. And on account of non-sublation</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48477">30. This is said in Smriti also</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48478">31. ... as to non-proceeding according to liking</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48479">32. The works of the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas ...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48480">33. And on account of co-operativeness</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48481">34. In any case they are the same, on account of twofold inferential signs</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48482">35. ... knowledge not to be overpowered</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48483">36. Also in the case of those outside, as this is seen</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48484">37. Smriti also states this</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48485">38. And there is the promotion of knowledge through special acts of duty</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48486">39. But better than that is the other also on account of an inferential mark</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48487">40. But of him who has become that there is no becoming not that...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48488">41. Nor the expiatory performance...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48489">42. A minor one, thus some; and hence they hold the existence of expiation, as in the case of eating.</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48490">43. But in either case such men stand outside...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48491">45. They are the priest's work...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48492">46. There is injunction of other auxiliary means...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48493">47. But on account of the existence of knowledge in all, there is winding up with the householder</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48494">48. On account of the others also being taught...</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48495">49. Not manifesting itself; on account of the connexion</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48496">50. What belongs to this world, there being no obstruction at hand; as this is seen</A><BR>
<A HREF="sbe48497">51. In the same way there is non-determination...</A><BR>
