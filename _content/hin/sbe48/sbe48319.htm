<P>2. But on account of (water) consisting of the three elements; on account of predominance.</P>
<P>Water alone could not produce a new body; for the text <I>Kh</I>. Up. VI, 3, 4, 'Each of these he made tripartite,' shows that all the elements were' made tripartite to the end of producing bodies. That the text under discussion mentions water only, is due to the predominance of water; and that among the elements giving rise to a new body water predominates, we infer from the fact that blood and the other humours are the predominating element in the body.</P>
