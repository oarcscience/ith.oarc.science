<P>27. At departing; there being nothing to be reached. For thus others (also declare).</P>
<P>The further question arises whether the putting off of all good and evil deeds takes place only at the time when the soul leaves the body, or also after it has departed and is on its journey to the world of Brahman. The P&ucirc;rvapakshin holds the latter view, for, he says, the texts declare both. The Kaush&icirc;takins say that the soul shakes off its good and evil deeds when it crosses the river Vira<I>g</I>&acirc; in the world of Brahman; while the T&acirc;<I>n</I>dins say 'Shaking off all evil, and shaking off the body,' &amp;c., which shows that the deeds are shaken off at the time when the soul leaves the body. And when the <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>t</I>y&acirc;yanaka says that 'his sons obtain his inheritance, his friends his good deeds,' and so on, this also intimates that the deeds are shaken off at the time when the soul leaves the body. We therefore must conclude that a part of the deeds is left behind at the moment of death, and the remainder on the journey to the world of Brahman.--This view the S&ucirc;tra controverts. All the good and evil deeds of the dying man are left behind, without remainder, at the time when the soul parts from the body. For after the soul of him who knows has departed from the body, 'there is nothing to be reached,' i.e. there are no further pleasures and pains to be enjoyed as the result of good and evil deeds, different from the obtaining of Brahman, which is the fruit of knowledge. Thus others 'also declare that, subsequently to the soul's departure from the body, there is no enjoyment of any pain or pleasure different from the obtaining of Brahman. 'But when he is free of the body, then neither pleasure nor pain</P>

<P>touches him'; 'Thus does that serene being, rising from this body, appear in its own form as soon as it has approached the highest light' (<I>Kh.</I> Up. VIII, 12, 1; 3); 'For him there is delay only so long as he is not freed (from the body); then he will be perfect' (VI, 14, 2).</P>
