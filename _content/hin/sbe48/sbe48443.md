The above conclusion is further confirmed by the fact of injunction,
i.e. thereby that clauses such as 'he is to meditate on the Udgîtha'

such as 'he is to bring water in the godohana vessel for him who desires
cattle'; for the latter state a special qualification on the part of him
who performs the action, while the former do not, and hence cannot claim
independence.
