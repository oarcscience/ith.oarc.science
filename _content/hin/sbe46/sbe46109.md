### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 5.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 20–21.

#### ÂPRÎ HYMN.

1\. Sacrifice sharp gh*ri*ta to the well-kindled light, to Agni
*G*âtavedas.

2\. May the unbeguiled Narâ*s*a*m*sa make this sacrifice ready; for he
is a sage with honey in his hand.

3 [1](sbe46109.htm#an_5:5:3:1). Agni, magnified by us, bring hither to
our help the bright, beloved Indra, with easy-going chariots.

4\. Soft like wool [1](sbe46109.htm#an_5:5:4:1) spread thyself (O
Barhis). The hymns have been sung to thee. Be to us for success, O
beautiful (Barhis)!

5\. O divine, easily passable doors, open yourselves for our protection.
Fill the sacrifice (with bliss) further and further!

6\. We approach (with prayers) Night and Morning, whose face is
beautiful, the increasers of vital strength, the two young mothers of
*Ri*ta.

7\. On the wind's flight, magnified, ye two divine Hot*ri*s of man, come
hither to this our sacrifice.

8 [1](sbe46109.htm#an_5:5:8:1). I*l*â, Sarasvatî, and Mahî, the three
comfort-giving goddesses, they who do not fail, shall sit down on the
sacrificial grass.

9\. Come hither as a friend, Tvash*tri* and mighty in welfare, and also
by thyself, protect us in every sacrifice.

10\. Where thou knowest, O tree (i. e. sacrificial

go.

11\. Svâhâ to Agni and Varu*n*a! Svâhâ to Indra and the Maruts! Svâhâ to
the gods for our offering!
