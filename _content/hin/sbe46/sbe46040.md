### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 142.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 10–11.

#### ÂPRÎ HYMN.

1\. Being inflamed, Agni, bring hither to-day the gods to the man who
holds forth the (sacrificial) ladle. Spin out the ancient thread (of
sacrifice) [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:1:1) for the sacrificer who has
prepared Soma.

2\. Measure out, O Tanûnapât [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:2:1), the
sacrifice rich in ghee, rich in honey, of a priest like me, of a
sacrificer who has toiled hard.

3\. The brilliant, purifying, wonderful
Narâ*s*a*m*sa [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:3:1) mixes the sacrifice with
honey three times a day, the god worthy of worship among the gods.

4\. Agni, magnified [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:4:1) by us, bring hither
the bright, beloved Indra. For this my prayer is
addressed [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:4:2) to thee whose tongue is good.

5\. (Priests) hold forth the (sacrificial) ladle, strewing the
sacrificial grass at the decorous service of the
sacrifice;—I [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:5:1)
trim [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:5:2) (the sacrificial grass) which best
receives the gods with its wide extent, a big shelter for Indra.

6 [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:6:1). May the divine doors open themselves,
the increasers of *Ri*ta, the never sticking, large ones, the purifying,
much-desired (doors), that the gods may come forth.

7\. May Night and Dawn, of glorious appearance, the two neighbouring
(goddesses), wearing beautiful ornaments [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:7:1),
the young [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:7:2) mothers of *Ri*ta, sit down
together on the sacrificial grass [3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:7:3).

8\. May the two divine Hot*ri*s, eager in praising (the gods), the sages
with lovely tongues, perform

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

for us to-day this successful sacrifice which attains to Heaven.

9\. The brilliant (goddess) placed among the gods, among the
Maruts [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:9:1), Hotrâ
Bhâratî [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:9:2), I*l*â, Sarasvatî, and
Mahî [3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:9:3): may these worshipful (goddesses)
sit down on the sacrificial grass.

10\. May Tvash*tri*, inclined towards us, pour forth for us, in our
navel [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:10:1), that wonderful seed with many
treasures [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:10:2), plentiful by itself, for the
sake of prosperity and wealth [3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:10:3).

11\. Letting go (the sacrificial food to the gods) sacrifice by thyself
to the gods, O tree [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:11:1).
May [2](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:11:2) Agni make the offerings
ready [3](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:11:3), the god among the gods, the wise
one.

12\. For Him who is accompanied by Pûshan and by the Maruts, by the
Vi*s*ve devâ*h*, (by) Vâyu [1](sbe46040.htm#an_1:142:12:1), who is moved
by the Gâyatra song, for Indra pronounce the Svâhâ over the offering.

13\. Come hither to the offerings over which the Svâhâ has been
pronounced, in order to feast. Indra! Come hither! Hear our call! Thee
they call at the worship.

#### NOTES.

The hymn is an Âprîsûkta. The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Anush*t*ubh. The
whole hymn is closely related to I, 13.—Verse 10: cf. VS. XXVII, 20; TS.
IV, 1, 8, 3; MS. II, 12, 6.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:142:1:1">1</span>. The third Pâda of this verse is
identical with VIII, 13, 14.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:142:2:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 13, 2, note 1.

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:142:3:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 13, 2, note 1.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:142:4:1">1</span>. 'Magnified' is î*li*tá*h*; comp.
the note on I, 1, 1. The verse is addressed to the I*d*a*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:142:4:2">2</span>. The text has á*kkh*a … va*k*yáte.
To me there seems to be no doubt that this is the passive of va*k*, not
of va*ñk*. Comp. the name of the priest a*kkh*âvâka, and the phrase
á*kkh*oktibhi*h* matînâ´m, I, 61, 3; 184, 2. The same passive of va*k*
is found III, 39, 1. matí*h* hridá*h* â´ va*k*yámânâ (then follows
á*kkh*a … *g*igâti); X, 47, 7 (stómâ*h*) … mánasâ va*k*yámânâ*h*.—It may
be observed that in our passage as well as in III, 39, 1 and X, 47, 7,
the forms va*k*yáte, va*k*yámânâ, va*k*yámânâ*h* are preceded by a
vowel; and we may infer that the poet did not say u*k*yáte, &c., in
order to avoid the hiatus.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:142:5:1">1</span>. The poet begins as if he intended
to say, 'Priests … lay down the sacrificial grass.' But he continues, I
lay down.' Dr. Neisser (Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XX, 60) tries to
explain the difficulty in a way in which I cannot follow him.

Note <span id="an_1:142:5:2">2</span>. On the verb v*rig* technically
connected with barhí*h*, see Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 152 seq., and
compare vol. xxxii, I, 38, 1, note 2; I, 64, 1, note 2.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:142:6:1">1</span>. With the whole verse compare I,
13, 6.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:142:7:1">1</span>. Pischel's opinion (Vedische
Studien, II, 113 seq.) that pé*s*a*h* means 'Gestalt,' 'Form,' 'Farbe,'
'rûpa,' does not convince me.

Note <span id="an_1:142:7:2">2</span>. See Geldner, Kuhn's Zeitschrift,
XXVIII, 195.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

Note <span id="an_1:142:7:3">3</span>. Comp. VIII, 87, 4. â´ barhí*h*
sîdatam sumát. Geldner (Vedische Studien, II, 190) translates: 'das
schöne Opfergras.'

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:142:9:1">1</span>. 'Should we read márteshu for
marútsu?' M. M. This conjecture seems perhaps rather bold.

Note <span id="an_1:142:9:2">2</span>. Hotrâ Bhâratî, i. e. the
personified Offering of the Bharatas, seems to be one goddess, more
usually called simply Bhâratî. Comp. I, 22, 10; II, 1, 11; III, 62, 3;
Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I, 322; H. O., Religion des Veda, 243, note
2. Pischel's opinion (Vedische Studien, II, 85) is different.

Note <span id="an_1:142:9:3">3</span>. See above, I, 13, 9, note 1.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:142:10:1">1</span>. On the navel as the symbol of
the connection between father and son, see Bergaigne, I, 35, 36, and
comp. the well-known name Nâbhânedish*th*a.

Note <span id="an_1:142:10:2">2</span>. For purú vâ´ram very probably
puruvâ´ram should be read (Grassmann). See II, 40, 4. puruvâ´ram … râyás
pósham ví syatâm nâ´bhim asmé.

Note <span id="an_1:142:10:3">3</span>. With the last Pâda compare II,
40, 4, quoted in note 2, and II, 3, 9. pra*g*â´m Tvásh*t*â ví syatu
nâ´bhim asmé; see also Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ IV, I, 8, 3. Tvash*tri* is
generally considered as giving sons; see H. O., Religion des Veda, 234.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:142:11:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 13, 11, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:142:11:2">2</span>. The second hemistich recurs I,
105, 14.

Note <span id="an_1:142:11:3">3</span>. See Neisser, Zur Vedischen
Verballehre, 22.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_1:142:12:1">1</span>. The text has 'for Vâyu,' not
'for (the god) accompanied by Vâyu.' But there is no doubt that
pûsha*n*váte, &c., refers to Indra, and that Vâyu is named merely as a
companion of Indra.
