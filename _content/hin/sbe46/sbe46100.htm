<p>1. Thy auspicious face, O mighty Agni, shines in the neighbourhood of the sun&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:1:1">1</A>. Brilliant to see, it is seen even by night. Soft to behold is the food in thy (beautiful) body&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:1:2">2</A>.</p>  
<p>2. O Agni, disclose (wise) thoughts for him who praises thee; (disclose) the opening, when thou, O strong-born, hast been praised with trembling. Grant unto us, O very great one, such a rich prayer as thou with all the gods wilt hold dear, O brilliant one.</p>  
<p>3. From thee, O Agni, genius is born, from thee (wise) thoughts, from thee beneficent hymns. From thee comes wealth adorned with heroes&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:3:1">1</A> to the thus-minded mortal who worships thee.</p>  
<p>4. From thee the racer is born that wins booty, whose energy expands round-about&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:4:1">1</A>, the helpful, of true strength; from thee delightful wealth sent by the gods; from thee, O Agni, the swift and impetuous horse.</p>  
<p>5. Thee, O Agni, the pious mortals seek to win by their prayers as the first, thee the god with agreeable speech, O immortal, who drivest away malice, the household god, the lord of the house, the wise one.</p>  
<p>6. (Drive) far from us senselessness and anguish; (drive) far all ill-will from him whom thou attendest&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46100.htm#an_4:11:6:1">1</A>. Be gracious at evening, Agni, son of strength, to him whom thou, the god, attendest with welfare.</p>

<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi. Metre, Trish<I>t</I>ubh.&#8212;Verse 1 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:11:1:1">1</A>. Comp. above, IV, 10, 5. ro<I>k</I>ate up&acirc;k&eacute;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:11:1:2">2</A>. Literally, 'in thy appearance' (r&ucirc;p&eacute;). Thus the Soma is stated, IX, 16, 6, to purify itself r&ucirc;p&eacute; avy&aacute;ye, literally, 'in the appearance of the sheep,' i.&nbsp;e. in the filter made of sheep's hair.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:11:3:1">1</A>. See Lanman, p. 560; Pischel, Ved. Studien, II, 115.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:11:4:1">1</A>. On v&iacute;h&acirc;y&acirc;<I>h</I>, see V. Henry, Les livres VIII et IX de l&#8217;Atharva-v&eacute;da (1894), p. 40 (AV. VIII, 2, 7).</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:11:6:1">1</A>. Probably the correct Padap&acirc;<I>th</I>a reading would be, as Prof. Bartholomae (Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, XV, 190) has noticed, y&aacute;m nip&acirc;&acute;si (cf. P&acirc;da d: y&aacute;m &#8230; s&aacute;<I>k</I>ase). If y&aacute;t is correct, the translation will be: '(drive) far all ill-will when thou protectest (us).'&#8212;Bartholomae proposes either to change asm&aacute;t to asm&acirc;t, or to interpret it as an equivalent of asm&acirc;t. It is possible, though in my opinion not very probable, that the text should be changed. The ablative asm&aacute;t very frequently depends on &acirc;r&eacute;.</p>
