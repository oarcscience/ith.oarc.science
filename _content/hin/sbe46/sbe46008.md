### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 31.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 32–35.

1\. Thou, O Agni, (who art) the first Aṅgiras *Ri*shi, hast become as
god the kind friend of the gods. After thy law the sages, active in
their wisdom [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:1:1), were born, the Maruts with
brilliant spears.

2\. Thou, O Agni, the first, highest Aṅgiras, a sage, administerest the
law of the gods, mighty for the whole world, wise, the son of the two
mothers [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:2:1), reposing everywhere for (the use
of) the living [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:2:2).

3\. Thou, O Agni, as the first, shalt
become [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:3:1) manifest to Mâtari*s*van, through
thy high wisdom, to Vivasvat. The two worlds trembled at (thy) election
as Hot*ri*. Thou hast sustained the burthen; thou, O Vasu, hast
sacrificed to the great (gods) [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:3:2).

4\. Thou, O Agni, hast caused the sky to
roar [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:4:1) for Manu, for the well-doing
Purûravas, being thyself a greater well-doer. When thou art loosened by
power (?) [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:4:2) from thy parents, they led thee
hither before and afterwards again.

5\. Thou, O Agni, the bull, the augmenter of prosperity, art to be
praised by the sacrificer who raises the spoon, who knows all about the
offering [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:5:1) and (the sacrifice performed
with) the word Vasha*t*. Thou (god) of unique vigour art the first to
invite [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:5:2) the clans.

6\. Thou, O Agni, leadest forward the man who follows crooked
ways [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:1), in thy company at the
sacrifice [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:2), O god dwelling among all
tribes, who in the strife of heroes, in the decisive moment for the

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

obtainment of the prize [3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:3), even with few
companions killest many foes in the
battle [4](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:6:4).

7\. Thou, O Agni, keepest that mortal [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:7:1) in
the highest immortality, in glory day by day, (thou) who being thirsty
thyself [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:7:2) givest happiness to both races
(gods and men), and joy to the rich.

8\. Thou, O Agni, praised by us, help the glorious singer to gain
prizes. May we accomplish our work with the help of the young active
(Agni). O Heaven and Earth! Bless us together with the gods.

9\. Thou, O Agni, in the lap of thy parents, a god among gods, O
blameless one, always watchful, be the body's creator and guardian to
the singer. Thou, O beautiful one, pourest forth all wealth.

10\. Thou, O Agni, art our guardian, thou art our father. Thou art the
giver of strength; we are thy kinsmen. Hundredfold, thousandfold
treasures come together in thee, who art rich in heroes, the guardian of
the law, O undeceivable one.

11\. Thee, O Agni, the gods have made for the living as the first
living [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:11:1), the clan-lord of the
Nahusha [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:11:2). They have made (the goddess)
I*l*â the teacher of men (manusha), when a son of my father is
born [3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:11:3).

12\. Thou, O Agni, protect with thy guardians, O god, our liberal givers
and ourselves, O venerable one! Thou art the protector of kith and
kin [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:12:1) and of the cows, unremittingly
watching over thy law.

13 [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:1). Thou, O Agni, art kindled four-eyed,
as the closest guardian for the sacrificer who is without (even) a
quiver [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:2). Thou acceptest in thy mind the
hymn even of the poor [3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:3) who has made
offerings [4](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:13:4), that he may prosper without
danger.

14\. Thou, O Agni, gainest [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:14:1) for the
widely-renowned

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

worshipper that property which is desirable and excellent. Thou art
called the guardian and father even of the
weak [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:14:2); thou instructest the simple, thou,
the greatest sage, the quarters of the
world [3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:14:3).

15\. Thou, O Agni, protectest on every side like well-stitched armour
the man who gives sacrificial fees. He who puts sweet food (before the
priests), who makes them comfortable in his dwelling, who kills living
(victims), he (will reside) high in
heaven [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:15:1).

16\. Forgive, O Agni, this our fault (?) [1](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:16:1),
(look graciously at) this way which we have wandered from afar. Thou art
the companion, the guardian, the father of those who offer Soma; thou
art the quick one [2](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:16:2) who makes the mortals
*Ri*shis [3](sbe46008.htm#an_1:31:16:3).

17\. As thou didst for Manus, O Agni, for Aṅgiras, O Aṅgiras, for Yayâti
on thy (priestly) seat, as for the ancients, O brilliant one, come
hither, conduct hither the host of the gods, seat them on the
sacrificial grass, and sacrifice to the beloved (host).

18\. Be magnified, O Agni, through this spell which we have made for
thee with our skill or with our knowledge. And lead us forward to better
things. Let us be united with thy favour, which bestows strength.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi of the hymn is Hira*n*yastûpa Âṅgirasa. To him tradition
ascribes the authorship of the collection I, 31–35, probably because in
X, 149, 5 the poet invokes Savit*ri*, 'as Hira*n*yastûpa the Âṅgirasa
has called thee, O Savit*ri*.' Vedic theologians of course tried to find
out where this invocation of Hira*n*yastûpa to Savit*ri* was preserved,
and the hymn, I, 35, seemed to agree best with the conditions

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

of the case (comp. Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Ges. XLII, 230). By this and
many similar cases it is made probable that at the time when the
Anukrama*n*î was composed, all real knowledge as to authors to whom the
collections of the first Ma*nd*ala belong, was lost.

The metre is *G*agatî; only the verses 8, 16, 18 are Trish*t*ubh. Verse
1 = VS. 34, 12. Verse 8 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 12 = VS. 34, 13. With
verse 16 comp. AV. III, 15, 4.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:31:1:1">1</span>. Vidmanâ´pasa*h* seems to be nom.
plur., not gen. sing. Comp. I, 111, 1. tákshan rátham … vidmanâ´pasa*h*,
'they (the *Ri*bhus), active in their wisdom, have wrought the chariot.'

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:31:2:1">1</span>. As to dvi*m*âtâ´ *s*ayú*h*, comp.
III, 55, 6 (*s*ayú*h* parástât ádha nú dvimâtâ´); Pischel, Vedische
Studien, II, 50.—On Agni's two mothers and his double birth see
Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 52.

Note <span id="an_1:31:2:2">2</span>. By 'living' I have translated âyú.
See on this word, Bergaigne, Rel. Véd., I, 59 seq.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:31:3:1">1</span>. Probably Bergaigne (Rel. Véd. I,
55, note 2) is right in conjecturing bhava*h* for bhava. In this case we
should have to translate: 'Thou as the first hast become manifest to
Mâtari*s*van.'

Note <span id="an_1:31:3:2">2</span>. I believe that to mahá*h* we have
to supply devâ´n; see II, 37, 6; III, 7, 9; VI, 16, 2; 48, 4, &c. 'Can
it not be an adverb? See vol. xxxii, p. 307; Lanman, p. 501,' M. M.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:31:4:1">1</span>. Comp. V, 58, 6. let Dyu (sky) roar
down, the bull of the dawn. V, 59. 8. may Dyaus Aditi (the unbounded)
roar for our feast.

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

Note <span id="an_1:31:4:2">2</span>. The translation of *s*vâtra is
purely conjectural. It rests on the supposition that the word is related
to *s*û*s*uve, *s*avas, &c. (thus Grassmann). Boehtlingk-Roth connect it
with svad, which is phonetically impossible; they give the meaning
'schmackhaft,' and paraphrase our passage: das mit einer Lockspeise (z.
B. mit einem Spahn) von den Reibhölzern abgenommene Feuer kann man hin
and her tragen. Ludwig: mit Geprassel. I do not see how this translation
would fit for a number of the passages in which the word occurs.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:31:5:1">1</span>. With the third Pâda compare VI, 1,
9. yá*h* â´hutim pári véda námobhi*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:31:5:2">2</span>. Avívâsasi cannot belong to the
relative clause. The accent must be changed accordingly.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:31:6:1">1</span>. It is very curious to find here
Agni as the protector of the v*rig*inavartani, the man who follows
crooked ways. Ludwig tries to explain the passage by understanding the
vidatha, in which Agni is here said to protect the sinner, as an asylum,
but we have no reason to believe that the word could have this meaning.
See the next note.

Note <span id="an_1:31:6:2">2</span>. On the derivation and meaning of
vidátha various opinions have been pronounced in the last years, which
have been collected by Prof. Max Müller in his note on V, 59, 2 (vol.
xxxii p. 349 seq.; see also Bartholomae, Studien zur indogermanischen
Sprachgeschichte, I, 41). Without trying to discuss here all different
theories, I immediately proceed to state my own opinion, though I am far
from claiming certainty for it. It will, however, I believe, solve the
difficulties tolerably well. I propose to derive vidátha from vi-dhâ;
the dh was changed into d by the same 'Hauchdissimilationsgesetz'
(Brugmann, Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik, vol. i, p. 355 seq.),
according to which Arian \*bháudhati was changed into Sanskrit

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

bódhati. No one will doubt that the operation of this
'Hauchdissimilationsgesetz' could be annihilated by opposite forces, but
it must be admitted that the forms with 'Hauchdissimilation' could also
remain intact. The verb vi-dhâ means 'to distribute, to arrange, to
ordain;' thus the original meaning of vidátha must be, like the meaning
of vidhâ´na, 'distribution, disposition, ordinance.' In V, 3, 6 we read
vidátheshu áhnâm: this phrase receives its explanation by VII, 66, 11.
ví yé dadhú*h* *s*arádam mâ´sam â´t áha*h*; ahorâtrâ´*n*i vidádhat, X,
190, 2; mâsâ´m vidhâ´nam, X, 1.38, 6; *ri*tû´n … ví dadhau, I, 95, 3. We
may call attention also to VI, 51, 2. véda yá*h* trî´*n*i vidáthâni
eshâm devâ´nâm *g*ánma, 'he who knows their threefold division, the
birth of the gods;' VI, 8, 1. prá nú vo*k*am vidáthâ *g*âtávedasa*h*, 'I
will proclaim the ordinances of *G*âtavedas.' Within the sphere of the
Vedic poets’ thoughts, the most prominent example of something most
artificially 'víhita' was the sacrifice (comp. ví yé dadhú*h* …
ya*gñ*ám, VII, 66, 11; *s*á*m*sâti ukthám yá*g*ate ví û dhâ*h*, IV, 6,
11; \[the moon\] bhâgám devébhya*h* ví dadhâti â-yán, X, 85, 19; and the
following very significant passage: ya*gñ*ásya tvâ vidáthâ p*rikkh*am
átra káti hótâra*h* *ri*tu*s*á*h* ya*g*anti, Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XXIII, 57).
Thus ya*gñ*á and vidátha, 'sacrifice' and 'ordinance,' became nearly
synonymous (comp. III, 3, 3, &c.). It would be superfluous to quote the
whole number of passages which show this, but I believe that an
attentive reader will discern at least in some of them the traces of the
original meaning of vidátha; see, for instance, II, 1, 4; III, 28,
4.—Finally vidátha seems to mean 'the act of disposing of any business'
or the like; this meaning appears, I believe, in passages like the
well-known phrase, b*ri*hát vadema vidáthe suvî´râ*h* (comp.
suvî´râsa*h* vidátham â´ vadema): 'may we with valiant men mightily
raise our voice at the determining (of ordinances, &c.).' Thus the words
vidátha and sabhâ´ approach each other in their meaning; a person
influential in council is called both vidathỹa and sabhéya (see
Boehtlingk-Roth, s. v. vidathỹa).

Note <span id="an_1:31:6:3">3</span>. The exact meaning of paritakmya is
not quite

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

free from doubt. Comp. Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 203,
note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:31:6:4">4</span>. Prof. Max Müller translates this
verse: 'Thou savest the man who has gone the wrong way in the thick of
the battle, thou who art quick at the sacrifice; thou who in the strife
of heroes, when the prize (or the booty) is surrounded (beset on all
sides), killest,' &c.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:31:7:1">1</span>. The phrase begins as if a relative
clause were to follow attached to the words 'that mortal.' But, instead
of this, afterwards a relative clause follows referring to 'thou, O
Agni.'

Note <span id="an_1:31:7:2">2</span>. Roth (Ueber gewisse Kürzungen des
Wortendes, p. 4) and Bartholomae (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXIX, 559) think
that a dative (like tât*ri*shâ*n*â´ya) is required; Agni gives comfort
to both thirsty races, gods and men. Roth takes tât*ri*shâ*n*á\[*h*\]
for an abbreviation of tât*ri*shâ*n*â´ya; Bartholomae conjectures
tât*ri*shâ´ya. It would be more easy to change the form into a dative
with the ending -â (= -ai); comp. Kluge, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 309
Pischel-Geldner, I, 61; Aufrecht, Festgruss an Böhtlingk, I; J. Schmidt,
Pluralbildungen, 234. But why not leave the nominative? Agni, being
thirsty himself, quenches the thirst of other beings. Comp. J. Schmidt,
Pluralbildungen, 309.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:31:11:1">1</span>. Âyúm âyáve. See verse 2, note 2.

Note <span id="an_1:31:11:2">2</span>. The names Nahus, Nahusha have
much the same value as Manus, Manusha. But it seems that not all the
Aryan tribes, but only a certain part of them, were considered as
descendants of Nahus. Comp. Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, II, 324.

Note <span id="an_1:31:11:3">3</span>. The last words are very obscure.
Mamaka occurs only in one other passage, belonging to the same
collection of hymns, I, 34, 6: there the A*s*vins are invoked to bestow
blessings on 'my son' (mámakâya sûnáve). 'When a son of my father is
born' may mean 'When I am

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

born,' or 'When a new issue is born within our tribe:' then—thus we may
possibly supply—the goddess I*l*â, the teacher of mankind, will be the
new-born child's teacher also. Another possible explanation would be to
take Mamaka as a proper name. Or Prof. Max Müller may be right, who
writes: 'Could not pitú*h* yát putrá*h* mámakasya *g*â´yate refer to
Agni, who, in III, 29, 3, was called i*l*âyâ*h* putra*h*. Her father and
husband (Manu) is also the father of mankind, therefore of the poet who
says: Whenever the son of my father is born, they made I*l*â (his
mother) the teacher of man.'

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_1:31:12:1">1</span>. Trâtâ´ tokásya tánaye seems to be
nothing else but trâtâ´ tokásya tánayasya, which would have had one
syllable too much.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:31:13:1">1</span>. Comp. on this verse, Pischel, I,
216 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:31:13:2">2</span>. Agni is to protect the man who
has no quiver, and cannot, therefore, protect himself. The four eyes of
the divine guardian seem to signify that he can look in all directions,
and perhaps also that he has the power of seeing invisible bad demons.
The watchdogs of Yama also are four-eyed, X, 14, 10. 11; comp. H. O.,
Religion des Veda, 474, note 4. Comp. nishaṅgin, Rig-veda III, 30, 15;
V, 57, 2; X, 103, 3.

Note <span id="an_1:31:13:3">3</span>. On kîrí, comp. Pischel loc. cit.

Note <span id="an_1:31:13:4">4</span>. Râtáhavya*h* means either a man
who has made offerings, or a god to whom offerings are made. That it
stands here in the first sense is shown with great probability by VIII,
103, 13, where the kîrí*h* râtáhavya*h* svadhvará*h* is described, the
man who, though poor, makes offerings and is a good sacrificer. But if
we are right in our translation of râtáhavya*h*, the verb vanóshi cannot
belong to the relative clause; I propose to read vanoshi without accent.
The way in which Pischel tries to explain the accent of vanóshi, by
taking the words kîré*h* *k*it mántram mánasâ as a parenthesis, is too
artificial.

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_1:31:14:1">1</span>. I think that we should here, as
in verse 13, read vanoshi without accent.

Note <span id="an_1:31:14:2">2</span>. This must be at least the
approximate meaning of âdhra. 'For âdhrasya one expects radhrasya,'
M. M.

Note <span id="an_1:31:14:3">3</span>. I think that the quarters of the
world have nothing to do here, but that instead of prá dí*s*a*h* we
should read (with Ludwig) pradí*s*a*h*. A similar mistake regarding the
word pradi*s* occurs several times in the text of the Rig-veda. I
propose to translate the corrected text: 'Thou instructest the simple,
well knowing the (divine) commandments.' Comp. vayúnâni vidvâ´n, dûtỹâni
vidvâ´n, &c.

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_1:31:15:1">1</span>. 'Der ist des himels ebenbild'
(Ludwig). But this word upamâ´ is, as far as we can see, not very
ancient. I take upamâ´, with Boehtlingk-Roth, as an adverbial
instrumental like dakshi*n*â´, madhyâ´, &c. Prof. Max Müller translates
'close or near to heaven.'

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_1:31:16:1">1</span>. *S*ará*n*i designates in the
Atharva-veda VI, 43, 3 a fault or defect, the exact nature of which
cannot be determined. Boehtlingk-Roth propose Widerspänstigkeit,
Hartnäckigkeit; Max Müller. Abweg, Fehltritt.

Note <span id="an_1:31:16:2">2</span>. On bh*ri*mi, comp. M. M.’s note
on II, 34, 1.

Note <span id="an_1:31:16:3">3</span>. Comp. III, 43, 5. kuvít mâ
*rí*shim papivâ´*m*sam sutásya (supply kárase), 'Wilt thou make me a
*Ri*shi after I have drunk Soma?'
