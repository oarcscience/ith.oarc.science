### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 188.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 8–9.

#### ÂPRÎ HYMN.

1\. Being kindled thou reignest to-day, a god with the gods, O conqueror
of thousandfold (wealth)! As messenger, as a sage, carry the oblations
(to the gods).

2\. O Tanûnapât! For him who walks in righteousness the sacrifice is
anointed with honey. May he [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:2:1) grant
thousandfold food.

3\. Receiving libations, worthy of being
magnified [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:3:1) bring hither to us the
worshipful gods. Agni! Thou art a winner of thousandfold (bliss).

4\. They have spread with might the eastward-turned sacrificial grass,
blessing (our tribe) with a thousand men [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:4:1),
(at the place) where you reign, O Âdityas!

5\. The Prince, the Sovereign, the mighty ones, the eminent
ones [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:5:1), the (Divine) Doors, which are many
and more than many, have sent forth streams of ghee.

6\. Adorned with gold, wearing beautiful ornaments you verily reign
high [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:6:1) in your splendour. Sit down here, ye
two Dawns [2](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:6:2).

7\. May the two fine-voiced divine Hot*ri*s, the sages, perform as the
first this sacrifice for us.

8\. Bhâratî! I*l*â! Sarasvatî! All ye (goddesses) whom I invoke, promote
us to splendour.

9\. Tvash*tri* indeed, the eminent (god) has shaped all forms, all
cattle. Do thou by sacrifice produce their increase.

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

10\. Yield up by thyself, O tree, (the sacrificial food) to the abode of
the gods [1](sbe46049.htm#an_1:188:10:1). May Agni make the offerings
relishable.

11\. Agni going in front of the gods is anointed with this Gâyatra song;
he shines when Svâhâ is pronounced (over the oblations).

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Agastya, the metre Gâyatrî. This Âprî hymn is closely
related to hymn X, 110, the author of which no doubt knew and imitated
our hymn.—No verses occur in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:188:2:1">1</span>. I have taken dádhat as a third
person, the subject being Tanûnapât. But it may be a participle
referring to ya*gñ*á*h*: 'the sacrifice which procures thousandfold food
is anointed with honey.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:188:3:1">1</span>. The text has î´*d*ya*h*.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:188:4:1">1</span>. 'This is the Da*s*avîra sacrifice
of the *S*âktyas. Ten valiant sons are born to those who perform it.'
Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a Brâhma*n*a. XXV, 7, 4.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:188:5:1">1</span>. These are evidently names of the
divine doors.—As to the nominative dúra*h*, see Lanman, p. 486.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:188:6:1">1</span>. On adhi-vi-râ*g*, comp. IX, 75,
3. ádhi trip*ri*sh*th*á*h* ushása*h* ví râ*g*ati.

Note. <span id="an_1:188:6:2">2</span>. I. e. Dawn and Evening.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:188:10:1">1</span>. Literally: 'to the abode, for
the gods.' Comp. the corresponding verse (10) of the Âprî hymn X, 110.
devâ´nâm pâ´tha*h*.
