### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 10.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 10.

1 [1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:1:1). O Agni! May we to-day successfully
perform, with thy heedfulness [2](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:1:2), this
praise [3](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:1:3) which touches thy heart, which is
like a horse, like auspicious power of the mind.

2\. For verily thou, O Agni, hast become the charioteer of auspicious
power of the mind, of real ability, and of the mighty *Ri*ta.

3\. Through these our hymns direct thyself hither-wards to us like the
sun with its light [1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:3:1), O Agni, gracious with
all thy faces.

4\. May we to-day worship thee, O Agni, praising thee with these songs.
Thy roarings thunder like (the thunder) of Heaven.

5\. Thy sweetest aspect, O Agni, shines near us for glory's sake, now by
day, now by night, like gold.

6\. Like purified gh*ri*ta is thy stainless body; (it is) brilliant
gold: that (body) of thine has shone [1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:6:1), O
self-dependent one, like gold.

7\. For even a malice which one has committed, thou verily drivest away
entirely, O righteous Agni, from the sacrificing
mortal [1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:7:1).

8\. May our friendship, O Agni, our brotherhood with you, the gods, be
blessed. This is our navel (i. e. relation) in our seat, in this
udder [1](sbe46099.htm#an_4:10:8:1).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is stated to be Padapaṅkti (verses 4, 6, 7,
Padapaṅkti or Ush*n*ih; verse 5, Mahâpadapaṅkti; verse 8, Ush*n*ih): see
on this metre M. M., vol. xxxii, p. xcviii seq.; H. O., Prolegomena, p.
98; Kühnau, Die Trish*t*ubh-*G*agatî-Familie, p. 234 seq.—Verse 1 = SV.
I, 434; MS. I, 10, 3. Verses 1–3 = SV. II, 1127–1129; VS. XV, 44–46.
Verses 1–4 = TS. IV, 4, 4, 7. Verse 1, 2, 4 = MS. II, 13, 8. Verse 3 =
MS. IV, 10, 2. Verse 6 = TS. II, 2, 12, 7; MS. IV, 12, 4.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:10:1:1">1</span>. The Avasâna in this verse ought to
stand before h*ri*disp*ris*am, not after this word, as the traditional
text places it. *Ri*dhyâma, consequently, cannot be accented.

Note <span id="an_4:10:1:2">2</span>. Dr. Neisser's opinion on óha is
different (Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XVIII, 312).

Note <span id="an_4:10:1:3">3</span>. I read stómam, which is frequently
found as the object of the verb *ri*dh, and which in several passages
receives the epithet h*ri*disp*rís*.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:10:3:1">1</span>. On the syntactical form of this
comparison, see Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier, p. 95.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:10:6:1">1</span>. Or ro*k*ate, 'shines'?

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:10:7:1">1</span>. The Avasâna ought to stand before
mártât. Cf. above, verse 1, note 1.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_4:10:8:1">1</span>. Cf. above, IV, 7, 7. The meaning
seems to be: in this sacrificial place, where the cows give milk.
