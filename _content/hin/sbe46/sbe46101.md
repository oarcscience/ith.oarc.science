### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 12.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 12.

1\. May the man who holds the sacrificial ladle and kindles thee, O
Agni, who thrice prepares food for thee on this day, victoriously
overcome (his foes) through his lustre, wise through the power of thy
mind, O *G*âtavedas.

2 [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:2:1). He who toiling brings fuel to thee,
doing service to thy, the great (god's) face, O Agni, kindling thee at
evening and at dawn—he prospers, obtains wealth, and destroys his
enemies.

3\. Agni is master of mighty royal power [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:3:1);
Agni (is master) of gain, of the highest wealth. He, the youngest,
self-dependent (god) in the right way distributes treasures to the
mortal worshipper.

4\. Whatever sin, O youngest (god), we have committed against thee in
thoughtlessness, men as we are [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:4:1), make thou
us sinless before Aditi; release us from (every) guilt on all sides, O
Agni!

5\. Even from great guilt, O Agni, from the prison of gods and of
mortals—let us, thy friends, never be harmed; grant luck and weal to
kith and kin.

6 [1](sbe46101.htm#an_4:12:6:1). As you formerly have released, O Vasus,
the buffalo cow bound by the foot, O worshipful gods, thus take away
from us this distress. May, O Agni, our life be further prolonged.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 4 = TS. IV, 7, 15, 6; MS. III, 16, 5.
Verse 5 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 6 = TS. IV, 7, 15, 7; MS. III, 16, 5; IV,
11, 1.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:12:2:1">1</span>. With the beginning of this verse,
comp. above, IV, 2, 6.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:12:3:1">1</span>. Comp. Roth, Zeitschr. der D. Morg.
Ges., XLVIII, 114.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:12:4:1">1</span>. Grassmann is right in giving to
purushatrâ´ the meaning 'unter den Menschen,' and in observing with
reference to our passage: 'wo die Bedeutung "nach Menschenweise" (s.
purushátâ) besser passt.' The same is the opinion of Böhtlingk-Roth. No
doubt we should read purushátâ; cf. VII, 57, 4 = X, 15, 6. yát va*h*
â´ga*h* purushátâ kárâma; IV, 54, 3. á*k*ittî yát *k*ak*ri*má….
purushatvátâ.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:12:6:1">1</span>. This verse is identical with
Rig-veda X, 126, 8.
