### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 28.

#### ASH*T*AKA III. ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 31.

1\. O Agni *G*âtavedas, accept graciously our offering, the sacrificial
cake at the morning libation, O god who givest wealth for our prayers.

2\. The sacrificial cake, O Agni, has been baked or made ready for thee:
accept it graciously, O youngest (god).

3\. Agni, accept eagerly the sacrificial cake which has been offered,
which has stood overnight. Thou art the son of strength, established at
the sacrifice.

4\. At the midday libation, *G*âtavedas, accept here graciously the
sacrificial cake, O sage. Agni, the wise ones do not diminish at the
sacrificial distributions [1](sbe46088.htm#an_3:28:4:1) the portion
which belongs to thee, the vigorous one [2](sbe46088.htm#an_3:28:4:2).

5\. Agni, at the third libation take joyfully the sacrificial cake, O
son of strength, which has been offered. And in thy admirable way place
our wakeful sacrifice, blessed with treasures, before the immortal gods.

6\. Agni, grown strong, O *G*âtavedas, accept graciously our offering,
the sacrificial cake which has stood overnight.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Gâyatrî in verses 1, 2, 6, Ush*n*ih in
verse 3, Trish*t*ubh in verse 4, and *G*agatî in verse 5.—No verse
occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

This Sûkta and the following are, as their position at the end of the
Anuvâka and the number of their verses show, later additions to the
original collection. The 28th hymn contains verses destined for the
offerings of sacrificial cakes to Agni at each of the three Savanas.
Quite in the same way hymn 52, which also belongs to the later
additions, refers to sacrificial cakes offered to Indra. The oblation of
such cakes to Indra at each Savana is found also in the later Vedic
ritual (comp. Kâtyâyana IX, 9, 2 seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, X, 369,
376), and several verses of III, 52 are indicated there as Puronuvâkyâ
verses for those very offerings; see Â*s*valâyana *S*rautasûtra V, 4, 2.
3. After each cake-offering to Indra follows the
Svish*t*ak*ri*t-oblation to Agni: and for these oblations Â*s*valâyana
(loc. cit. Sûtra 6) prescribes verses 1, 4, and 5 of our hymn, according
to the order of the three Savanas. From the text of the hymn it seems to
be evident that verses 1–3 have been composed for the first, verse 4 for
the second, and verses 5–6 for the third Savana. With this distribution
the change of the metres evidently stands in connection. In accordance
with the theories of the later Vedic theologians, we have here the
Gâyatrî as the characteristic metre of the first, the Trish*t*ubh of the
second, the *G*agatî of the third Savana.

Comp. also Â*s*valâyana VI, 5, 25, and the very ingenious but at the
same time somewhat hazardous observations of Bergaigne, Recherches sur
l’Histoire de la Liturgie Védique, 16 seq.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:28:4:1">1</span>. The text has vidátheshu.

Note <span id="an_3:28:4:2">2</span>. Comp. I, 36, 1, note 2.
