<p>1. May the mortal truly by sacrifices, O god, (magnify) the stronger one for help; may the P&ucirc;ru, when good service has been performed, magnify Agni (and thereby draw him) hither for his aid.</p>  
<p>2. For thou art manifestly considered as his (i.&nbsp;e. Agni's) disposer, highly brilliant by thyself&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:1">1</A>: (magnify then Agni who is) a firmament of bright splendour, lovely beyond&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:2">2</A> thought&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:2:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>3. (It is) yonder (sun?) who verily has been yoked by his (i.&nbsp;e. Agni's) light&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:1">1</A> through the impetuous speech&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:2">2</A>&#8212;(by the light of Agni) whose flames mightily shine as if (they were made to shine) by the sperm of heaven&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:3:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>4. Through his, the wise one's, insight there is wealth on his, the wonderful (Agni's), chariot. And Agni is praised, he who is to be invoked among all peoples.</p>  
<p>5. Now indeed our liberal lords have manifestly attained&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46121.htm#an_5:17:5:1">1</A> treasure. Offspring of vigour! Protect us for the sake of victory! Help us to welfare! And assist us to grow strong in fights i</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;No verse occurs in the other Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s.</p>  
<p><a name="page_404"><font size="1" color="green">p. 404</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:17:2:1">1</A>. I have translated the text in its traditional form, which I think is correct. On the vocative vidharman, comp. Delbr&uuml;ck, Altindische Syntax, p. 106. One could think, however, of reading v&iacute;dharman as a locative, and sv&aacute;ya<I>s</I>astare, and of considering m&aacute;nyase as a first person, like ar<I>k</I>ase, &amp;c.: 'For in his extension, brilliant by itself, I manifestly comprehend that firmament,' &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:17:2:2">2</A>. Cf. VIII, 72, 3. ant&aacute;<I>h</I> i<I>k</I><I>kh</I>anti t&aacute;m <I>g</I>&aacute;ne rudr&aacute;m par&aacute;<I>h</I> man&icirc;sh&aacute;y&acirc;. 'Ueber alle Vorstellung hinaus.' Ludwig.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:17:2:3">3</A>. If we read sv&aacute;ya<I>s</I>astara<I>h</I>, v&iacute;dharman, and explain m&aacute;nyase as second person, the following translation of this difficult verse may be attempted: 'Thou art manifestly, indeed, considered as very brilliant by thyself in its (the firmament's) extension: that firmament of bright splendour (I praise), lovely beyond thought.' It is not very probable, however, that &aacute;sya should refer to anything else but Agni.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:17:3:1">1</A>. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, whom Ludwig follows, very probably is right in interpreting as&aacute;u as the sun.&#8212;On the Sandhi, compare Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;nd. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 679.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:17:3:2">2</A>. Through the sacred spell, by which the sun is made to rise through the kindling of the fire.&#8212;Cf. VIII, 17, 1, 5. tu<I>g</I>&acirc;&acute; &#8230; g<I>ri</I>bh&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:17:3:3">3</A>. Does this mean that Agni's flames shine like lightning which receives its light from the waters of the cloud, the sperm of heaven? Cf. IX, 74, 1, where it is said of the Soma mixed with water: div&aacute;<I>h</I> r&eacute;tas&acirc; sa<I>k</I>ate.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:17:5:1">1</A>. I think that sa<I>k</I>anta should be accented, because it is connected with h&iacute;.</p>
