<p>1. Log by log&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:1:1">1</A> be kind towards us. Flash by flash grant us thy, the Vasu's, favour&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:1:2">2</A>. Bring hither, O god, the gods that we may sacrifice. Sacrifice, O Agni, as a kind friend to thy friends.</p>  
<p>2. Thou whom the gods, Varu<I>n</I>a, Mitra, Agni, thrice every day bring hither by sacrifice day by day, Tan&ucirc;nap&acirc;t, make this our sacrifice honey-sweet, having its abode in ghee&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:2:1">1</A>, (this sacrifice) which worships (the gods).</p>  
<p>3. (Our adoring) thought rich in all boons goes forward for worshipping as the first the Hot<I>ri</I> of the sacred food (i<I>l</I>), for saluting the strong bull with adoration and homage. May he, the best sacrificer, incited (by our prayers) sacrifice to the gods&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:3:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>4. Upwards your&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:1">1</A> course has been directed at the worship; upwards (your) flames&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:2">2</A> are gone; ready (for receiving you) is the air&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:4:3">3</A>. Or the Hot<I>ri</I> has sat down at heaven's navel. We spread out the sacrificial grass which receives the gods.</p>  
<p>5&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:1">1</A>. Choosing in their mind the sevenfold work of the Hot<I>ri</I>s&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:2">2</A>, enlivening everything (the gods) came hither in the right way. (The divine doors&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:3">3</A>) with men as their ornaments&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:4">4</A>, born at the sacrifices&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:5:5">5</A>, have come hither and thither to this sacrifice, many of them.</p>  
<p>6. Hither (shall come) the two Dawns&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:1">1</A>, the neighbourly (goddesses) of glorious appearance&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:2">2</A>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_237"><font size="1" color="green">p. 237</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Of different forms, they both smile. (They shall come) that Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a may be satisfied with us, and Indra accompanied by the Maruts with their powers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:6:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>7. I catch hold of the two divine Hot<I>ri</I>s first. The seven strong ones&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:7:1">1</A> rejoice according to their wont. Teaching the right, they proclaim the right, the guardians of law, contemplating the law.</p>  
<p>8&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:8:1">1</A>. May Bh&acirc;rat&icirc;, in concord with the Bh&acirc;rat&icirc;s, I<I>l</I>&acirc; with the gods, Agni with men, Sarasvat&icirc; with all (beings) belonging to Sarasvat&icirc; (come) hither; may the three goddesses sit down on this sacrificial grass.</p>  
<p>9. O divine Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, grant us and send forth this our seed which is to thrive: (the seed) from which a manly son is born able and skilful, who sets to work the press-stones, loving the gods.</p>  
<p>10. O tree&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46064.htm#an_3:4:10:1">1</A>, send (the offering) forth to the gods. May Agni the slaughterer make the offering ready. May the same, the very true Hot<I>ri</I>, sacrifice according as he knows the generations of the gods.</p>  
<p>11. Agni, being kindled, come hither, on one chariot with Indra, with the quick gods. May Aditi, the mother of noble sons, sit down on our sacrificial grass. With Sv&acirc;h&acirc; may the immortal gods rejoice.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi. Metre, Trish<I>t</I>ubh.&#8212;Verse 9 = TS. III, 1, 11, 1; MS. IV, 13, 10. Verse 10 = VS. XXVII, 21; TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; MS. II, 12, 6.</p>  
<p><a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="green">p. 238</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:1:1">1</A>. Agni is invoked as personified in each log of fuel which is put on the sacrificial fire.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:1:2">2</A>. Comp. VII, 39, 1. sumat&iacute;m v&aacute;sva<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:2:1">1</A>. Comp. II, 3, 11. gh<I>ri</I>t&aacute;m asya y&oacute;ni<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:3:1">1</A>. Comp. X, 110, 3. s&aacute;<I>h</I> en&acirc;n yakshi ishit&aacute;<I>h</I> y&aacute;<I>g</I>&icirc;y&acirc;n (cf. also X, 110, 9).</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:4:1">1</A>. The text has the dual v&acirc;m. But who are the two beings addressed? According to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, Agni and the Barhis, which does not seem very probable. The structure of the phrase gives the impression&#8212;though this impression is by no means certain&#8212;that v&acirc;m, which belongs to g&acirc;tu, is to be supplied to so<I>k</I>&icirc;&acute;<I>m</I>shi also. If we are right in this supposition, are not the two beings in question the two first of the three sacred fires, the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya and G&acirc;rhapatya? These two fires are frequently spoken of in the ritual texts as of a dyad, with the omission of the third fire.&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller proposes to change v&acirc;m into v&acirc;. According to him the meaning may be: Either the road has been made upward, i.&nbsp;e. the flames have gone upward to the sky, or Agni has sat down at heaven's navel.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:4:2">2</A>. Comp. VII, 43, 2. &ucirc;rdhv&acirc;&acute; <I>s</I>o<I>k</I>&icirc;&acute;<I>m</I>shi devay&ucirc;&acute;ni asthu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:4:3">3</A>. Possibly the words &ucirc;rdhv&acirc;&acute; <I>s</I>o<I>k</I>&icirc;&acute;<I>m</I>shi pr&aacute;sthit&acirc; r&aacute;<I>g</I>&acirc;<I>m</I>si may form one clause, 'upwards (your) flames are gone towards the sky.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:5:1">1</A>. On this verse, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 115 seq.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:5:2">2</A>. On the seven priests of the ancient Soma sacrifice, comp. H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 383 seq.</p>  
<p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:5:3">3</A>. That this subject is to be supplied, is shown by the regular composition of the &Acirc;pr&icirc; hymns. It is confirmed by the word p&ucirc;rv&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, which is evidently an epithet of the divine doors; comp. I, 188, 5; VII, 2, 5.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:5:4">4</A>. 'In human form.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:5:5">5</A>. The text has vid&aacute;theshu.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:6:1">1</A>. I.&nbsp;e. Night and Dawn.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:6:2">2</A>. Comp. above, I, 142, 7.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:6:3">3</A>. Comp. M.&nbsp;M., vol. xxxii, p. 196 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:7:1">1</A>. Comp. above, I, 127, 5, note 1. Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 96) may be right in taking the seven p<I>ri</I>ksh&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> as the A&#7749;giras, the sapt&aacute; v&iacute;pr&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:8:1">1</A>. The verses 8&#8211;11 are repeated in VII, 2, 8&#8211;11.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:4:10:1">1</A>. The tree is the sacrificial post (y&ucirc;pa).</p>
