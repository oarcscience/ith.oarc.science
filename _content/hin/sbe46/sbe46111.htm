<p>1. O friends, (bring) together your united food and praise to Agni, the strongest (god) of (human) dwellings, the offspring of Vigour, the mighty one&#8212;</p>  
<p>2. At whose onslaught&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:2:1">1</A>, wherever it be, men rejoice in the seat of men, whom the worthy ones kindle, whom (human) creatures produce.</p>  
<p>3. When we get together the food and the offerings of men, he has grasped, with the strength of his splendour, the rein of <I>Ri</I>ta.</p>  
<p>4. He indeed produces light even by night to him who is afar, when he, the ever-young purifier, destroys the lords of the forest.</p>  
<p>5. He at whose officiating (men) pour down the offering of their sweat on the paths&#8212;to Him who is noble by his own nature, the worlds have risen as to ridges (of hills)&#8212;</p>  
<p>6. He whom the mortal has acquired, the much-desired (god), for the refreshment of every one, the sweetener of nourishment, the homestead for the &Acirc;yu&#8212;</p>  
<p>7. He indeed, the beast, mows off deserts and habitable land like a mower, the golden-bearded with brilliant teeth, the <I>Ri</I>bhu of undecaying strength.</p>  
<p>8. The bright one for whom (the gh<I>ri</I>ta) streams (quickly) like an axe&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:1">1</A>, as at (the sacrifice of) Atri. Him the well-bearing mother has born, as soon as&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:2">2</A> she had enjoyed love&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:8:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>9. He who satisfies thee for refreshment, O Agni</p>  
<p><a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="green">p. 383</font></A></p>  
<p>who drinkest butter: mayst thou bestow splendour, renown, and (wise) mind on such mortals&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:9:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>10. Thus I have seized upon the spirit of Adhri<I>g</I>(?) as upon a head of cattle given by thee&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46111.htm#an_5:7:10:1">1</A>. May then Atri, O Agni, overcome the Dasyus who do not give (to the Brahmans); may Isha overcome the men (who do not give).</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The <I>Ri</I>shi is Isha &Acirc;treya (cf. verse 10); the metre is Anush<I>t</I>ubh (verse 10, Pa&#7749;kti).&#8212;Verse 1 = VS. XV, 29; TS. II, 6, 11, 4; IV, 4, 4, 3; MS. IV, 11, 1. Verses 2, 3 = TS. II, 1, 11, 3; MS. IV, 12, 4.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:7:2:1">1</A>. Y&aacute;sya s&aacute;m-<I>ri</I>tau: see I, 127, 3.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:7:8:1">1</A>. With the expression sv&aacute;dhiti<I>h</I>-iva r&icirc;&acute;yate (Lanman, Noun-Inflection, p. 375), compare V, 48, 4. r&icirc;<I>t</I>&iacute;m para<I>s</I>&oacute;<I>h</I>-iva. Of course we must ask: what is the thing that streams so brightly and quickly as an axe moves? The thing in question is stated to stream (r&icirc;yate) for Agni now as it did at Atri's sacrifice. The expression 'as at Atri's sacrifice' seems to show that something like prayers or libations is alluded to. The verb r&icirc;yate, on the other hand, seems to point either to rivers, or to streams of Soma or of Gh<I>ri</I>ta. Thus, considering that Gh<I>ri</I>ta is mentioned much more frequently in connection with Agni than Soma, we are led to the conclusion that the poet speaks here of streams of Gh<I>ri</I>ta. Should we not for <I>s</I>&uacute;<I>k</I>i<I>h</I> read <I>s</I>&uacute;<I>k</I>i, which would be here as in IV, 1, 6; VI, 10, 2; IX, 67, 12, an epithet of Gh<I>ri</I>ta? 'He for whom the bright (Gh<I>ri</I>ta) streams quickly like an axe.' The origin of the reading</p>  
<p><a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="green">p. 384</font></A></p>  
<p>s&uacute;<I>k</I>i<I>h</I> may easily be accounted for; the word was thought to refer to Agni.&#8212;Another interpretation of this hemistich has been given by Benfey, Vedica and Linguistica, p. 177.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:7:8:2">2</A>. Kr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;: cf. I, 58, 3, note 1 (<A HREF="sbe46012.htm#page_47">p. 47</A>).</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:7:8:3">3</A>. 'Sobald sie den Liebesgenuss erlangt hatte.' Pischel, Ved. Studien, 1, 71.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:7:9:1">1</A>. The first hemistich speaks of the worshipper in the singular, the second in the plural.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:7:10:1">1</A>. This hemistich is quite obscure. With many&uacute;m &acirc;&acute; dade, cf., for instance, X, 48, 2. d&aacute;<I>s</I>yubhya<I>h</I> p&aacute;ri n<I>ri</I>m<I>n</I>&aacute;m &acirc;&acute; dade. Adhr&iacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I> may be the genitive of a proper name, as I have translated it; but this is quite doubtful. Was the hymn intended for a charm in which the sacrificer seized a head of cattle which represented the spirit of an enemy, and thus deprived that enemy of his courage?</p>
