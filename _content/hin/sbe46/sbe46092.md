### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 3.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 20–22.

1\. Draw Rudra hither for your protection [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:1:1),
the king of sacrifice, the truly sacrificing Hot*ri* of the two
worlds [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:1:2), the golden-coloured Agni, before
the unseen thunderbolt (strikes you).

2\. This is the home which we have prepared for thee as a well-dressed,
loving wife (prepares the marriage-bed) for her
husband [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:2:1). Directed hitherward, dressed (in
offerings and prayers?) [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:2:2) sit down. These
(sacrificial ladles or prayers?) are turned towards thee, O most skilful
one [3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:2:3)!

3\. To him who hears us, who is not proud, who beholds men, to the
merciful, immortal god recite a prayer, O worshipper, a hymn—(to Agni)
whom the presser (of Soma), the Madhu-presser, magnifies like the
pressing-stone [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:3:1).

4\. Thou who art well-intentioned, give heed to this our
toiling [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:4:1), to this
*Ri*ta [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:4:2), O observer of *Ri*ta! When will our
hymns share in thy rejoicings? When will our friendship dwell in thy
house?

5\. How wilt thou, O Agni, before Varu*n*a, and how wilt thou, and which
sin of ours wilt thou blame before Dyaus? How wilt thou speak to
bountiful Mitra, to the Earth? What (wilt thou say) to Aryaman, to
Bhaga?

6\. What wilt thou say, O Agni, when thou hast grown strong on the
Dhish*n*ya altars [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:1)? What to strong Vâta who
goes forward in triumph [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:2)? To the
Nâsatya [3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:3) who goes round the
earth [4](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:4), to … [5](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:6:5)?
What, O Agni, to Rudra, the man-killer?

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

7\. How (wilt thou speak) to great Pûshan who brings prosperity? What
(wilt thou say) to martial Rudra, the giver of
offerings [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:7:1)? What
sin [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:7:2) wilt thou announce to wide-ruling
Vish*n*u, what, O Agni, to the mighty weapon (of the gods)?

8\. How wilt thou answer, when thou art asked, to the
righteous [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:8:1) host of the Maruts? How to the
mighty Sun, to the quick Aditi [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:8:2)? Accomplish
thy work, O *G*âtavedas, thou who knowest the Heaven!

9\. I magnify [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:1) the *Ri*ta of the
cow [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:2) ruled by *Ri*ta and also by the raw
one [3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:3), the honey-sweet, ripe (milk), O Agni.
Though being black this (cow) swells of bright drink, of
… [4](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:9:4) milk.

10\. With *Ri*ta indeed, with the milk of the
back [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:10:1), the bull has been anointed, Agni the
man. Without trembling he moved on bestowing his vigour. The speckled
bull has poured out his bright udder [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:10:2).

11 [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:11:1). By the *Ri*ta the Aṅgiras have broken
the rock and cleft it asunder; they have shouted together with the cows.
Prosperously the men have surrounded [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:11:2) the
Dawn. The Sun appeared when Agni (the fire) had been
born [3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:11:3).

12\. By the *Ri*ta the immortal, uninjured [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:12:1)
goddesses, the Waters, O Agni, with their honey-sweet waves have sped
forward [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:12:2) for ever to flow (along their
course), like a racer incited by shouting when (the race-horses) are let
loose.

13\. Go never on thy crooked way to the spirit (which avenges the guilt)
of anybody [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:13:1), of a vassal who has
trespassed, or of a friend. Require not (of us),a sinful brother's
debt [2](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:13:2). May we not have to suffer under the
spirit which avenges a friend's or a (hostile) deceiver's
guilt [3](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:13:3).

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

14\. Protect us, O Agni, with all thy protection, thou who art
protected, O martial one [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:14:1), and art
gladdened (by us). Sparkle forth, and destroy even strong evil! Slay the
Rakshas even though it has grown large.

15\. Be gracious, O Agni, through these our hymns. Touch, O hero, this
wealth moved by our prayers. And accept, O Aṅgiras, our sacred words.
May the praise, beloved by the gods, resound to
thee [1](sbe46092.htm#an_4:3:15:1).

16\. I, the priest, have rehearsed to thee the omniscient one, O Agni,
worshipper (of the gods), all these songs, these inmost words, these
recitations and words of wisdom, to thee the wise one, with prayers and
hymns.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—Verse 1 = SV. I, 69; TS. I, 3, 14, 1; TB.
II, 8, 6, 9; MS. IV, 11, 4. Verse 6 = MS. IV, 11, 4.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:3:1:1">1</span>. On the identification of Agni with
Rudra, comp. Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, III, 36; von Bradke, Dyâus Asura,
p. 54 (Rig-veda I, 27, 10; III, 2, 5; VIII, 72, 3).

Note <span id="an_4:3:1:2">2</span>. The second Pâda of this verse is
identical with VI, 16, 46.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:3:2:1">1</span>. Cf. Hirzel, Gleichnisse and
Metaphern im Rigveda, p. 69.

Note <span id="an_4:3:2:2">2</span>. On párivîta*h* Sâya*n*a remarks,
yash*t*avyadevais te*g*obhir vâ parivîta*h*. In the commentary on I,
128, 1, on the other hand, he says, *ri*tvigbhi*h* paridhibhir vâ parito
vesh*t*ita*h*.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

Note <span id="an_4:3:2:3">3</span>. I take su-apâka as a compound of su
and a-pâka (comp. Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h. XX, 44 = Taitt. Br. II, 6, 8, 4 =
Maitr. Sa*m*h. III, 11, 1, where Tvash*tri* is called apâká*h*). In
Rig-veda VI, 11, 4 we read: ádidyutat sú ápâka*h* vibhâ´vâ; in VI, 12,
2. â´ yásmin tvé sú ápâke ya*g*atra, &c. Should we not correct in both
passages suapâka*h*, suapâke?

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:3:3:1">1</span>. The pressing-stone (grâ´van) is
frequently considered as speaking, as praising the gods. Cf.
Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I, p. 152 sq.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_4:3:4:1">1</span>. The Padapâ*th*a has *s*ámyai. I
think it should be *s*ámyâ*h*.

Note <span id="an_4:3:4:2">2</span>. I. e. to this sacrifice, which is
considered as one of the chief manifestations of *Ri*ta. See H. O.,
Religion des Veda, p. 197.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_4:3:6:1">1</span>. At the Soma sacrifice fire burns on
eight altars called Dhish*n*ya; see Weber, Indische Studien, X, pp. 366,
375.

Note <span id="an_4:3:6:2">2</span>. See vol. xxxii, p. 164.

Note <span id="an_4:3:6:3">3</span>. This is the only passage in the
Rig-veda in which nâsatya occurs in the singular.

Note <span id="an_4:3:6:4">4</span>. On pári*g*man, cf. above, I, 79, 3
note.

Note <span id="an_4:3:6:5">5</span>. Kshé (cf. Lanman, pp. 440, 448,
534) is evidently corrupt. But neither Bollensen's conjecture, uksh*n*é,
nor those of Ludwig (*k*akshe, yakshe), carry conviction.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:3:7:1">1</span>. It is very strange to find Rudra
here designated as 'giver of offerings.' But it seems too bold to
explain havi*h*-dé as a dative of havi*h*-ád ('eater of offerings').

Note <span id="an_4:3:7:2">2</span>. I read with Grassmann répa*h*
('sin') for réta*h* ('sperm').

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_4:3:8:1">1</span>. The text has *ri*tâ´ya, used as an
adjective (see Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, III, 216).

Note <span id="an_4:3:8:2">2</span>. Aditi is masculine and seems to be
an epithet ('unrestrained, free') of the Sun. Cf. vol. xxxii, p. 262;
Bergaigne, III, 92. Probably at the same time the word is intended to
allude to the goddess Aditi.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_4:3:9:1">1</span>. The text has î*l*e, on which Ludwig
says, 'so viel wie nî*l*e.' Î*l*e of course cannot be the same as
nî*l*e, but should we not conjecture nî*l*é? Cf. above, IV, 1, 11.
v*ri*shabhásya nî*l*é, and IV, 1, 12. *ri*tásya yónâ v*ri*shabhásya
nî*l*é. The translation would be, 'By *Ri*ta the *Ri*ta is restrained in
the nest of the cow.'

Note <span id="an_4:3:9:2">2</span>. The '*Ri*ta of the cow,' if the
reading is correct (see note 1), seems to be the milk.

Note <span id="an_4:3:9:3">3</span>. The 'raw one' is the cow as opposed
to the ripe milk.

Note <span id="an_4:3:9:4">4</span>. The meaning of *g*â´marya (ἅπαξ
λεγόμενον) is unknown. Cf. Bergaigne. II, 398, note 1. Sâya*n*a reads
*g*â amarye*n*a. 'I should prefer *g*â amartyena.' M. M.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_4:3:10:1">1</span>. Does this mean, with the milk that
comes from the ridge of heaven? Cf. IV, 20, 4. sám ándhasâ mamada*h*
p*ri*sh*th*ỹena.

Note <span id="an_4:3:10:2">2</span>. This Pâda seems to be an imitation
of VI, 66, 1, where P*ris*ni ('the speckled one') is the mother of the
Maruts: sak*rí*t *s*ukrám duduhe p*ris*ni*h* û´dha*h*. See vol. xxxii,
p. 368.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_4:3:11:1">1</span>. Here we have again the same myth
of the Aṅgiras and the cows, to which so many allusions are found in the
preceding hymns.

Note <span id="an_4:3:11:2">2</span>. The red cows of the myth are the
dawns; the

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aṅgiras besiege
the stronghold in which these cows are imprisoned.

Note <span id="an_4:3:11:3">3</span>. On the kindling of the fire as a
charm by which the sun is made to rise, see H. O., Religion des Veda, p.
109 seq. The Aṅgiras kindle the fire for performing their sacrifice;
thereby they make the sun rise.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_4:3:12:1">1</span>. The same epithet is applied to the
waters also in X, 104, 8.

Note <span id="an_4:3:12:2">2</span>. The optative dadhanyu*h* is very
strange. Probably we ought to read dadhanvu*h*.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_4:3:13:1">1</span>. The meaning seems to be that Agni
is requested not to turn against the sacrificer a spirit which has to
avenge the guilt committed by a third person. 'Why not read ya*gñ*am? Go
not secretly to anybody's sacrifice, not of a hostile house, not of a
friend. Do not require (of us) a sinful brother's debt. May we not feel
the might of friend or foe.' M. M.

Note <span id="an_4:3:13:2">2</span>. Geldner (Ved. Studien II, 157)
translates and interprets: 'tilge nicht, O Agni, die Schuld eines
falschen Bruders,' nämlich die Schuld an die Manen, also dem Sinn nach
'mache ihn kinderlos.' This is quite unacceptable.

Note <span id="an_4:3:13:3">3</span>. The text is evidently corrupt. I
propose to read: mâ´ sákhyu*h* yakshám mâ´ ripó*h* bhu*g*ema. Comp. V,
70, 4. mâ´ kásya adbhutakratû yakshám bhu*g*ema tanû´bhi*h*.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_4:3:14:1">1</span>. I cannot adopt Bergaigne's opinion
on súmakha (Quarante Hymnes, p. 75).

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_4:3:15:1">1</span>. Or, awake for thee.
