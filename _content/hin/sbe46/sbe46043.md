### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 145.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 14.

1\. Ask ye him. He has come. He knows. He the intelligent one moves
forward; He moves along (his way) (?) [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:1:1). In
him all commands, all wishes dwell. He is the lord of strength, of
mighty power.

2\. They ask him. He himself [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:2:1) does not ask
in turn what he, the wise one, has grasped by his own mind
alone [2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:2:2). He does not forget the first word
nor another word. Unconfused he adheres to his own power of mind.

3\. To him go the sacrificial ladles, to him go the
racers [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:3:1). He alone may hear all my words.
He who pronounces many praishas [2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:3:2), the
conqueror, the accomplisher of sacrifices whose blessings are flawless,
the young child has assumed vigour.

4\. When he has come together [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:1) (with his
companions [2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:2)), he goes to greet
them [3](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:3). As soon as born he steals upon (his
prey) together with his companions. He strokes the
… [4](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:4) to give him delight and joy, when the
loving ones [5](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:5) approach him who stands on
them [6](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:4:6).

5\. He, the animal living in the water and walking in the
forest [1](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:5:1), has been placed on the highest
skin [2](sbe46043.htm#an_1:145:5:2) (sky?). He has proclaimed his rules
to the mortals: for Agni, the knowing one, is intent upon *Ri*ta (Right)
and is true.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, *G*agatî; the last verse is Trish*t*ubh.—No
verse occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:145:1:1">1</span>. The Sa*m*hitâ text has sâ´ nṽ
îyate, the Pada text, sá*h* nú îyate. Comp. Prâti*s*âkhya 314. I propose
to read sâ´nu (= sá ánu) îyate.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:145:2:1">1</span>. See Geldner, Ved. Studien, II, p.
188.

Note <span id="an_1:145:2:2">2</span>. Possibly we should read svéna
evá.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:145:3:1">1</span>. The text (árvatî*h*) implies that
these race-horses are mares. Probably, as Sâya*n*a explains, the prayers
(stutaya*h*) are alluded to. See on the prayers compared with horses,
Bergaigne, II, 284 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:145:3:2">2</span>. Praishá is the technical
designation of the sacrificial commands of one priest (or more
especially, of the Maitrâvaru*n*a) to another priest; comp. Schwab, Das
Altindische Thieropfer, p. 90; H. O., Religion des Veda, 390.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:145:4:1">1</span>. Samâ´rata may be the third person
of singular or of plural.

Note <span id="an_1:145:4:2">2</span>. I supply 'with his companions' in
consideration of the second Pâda (yú*g*yebhi*h*). It is difficult to say
who Agni's companions are (the flames? the officiating priests?).

Note <span id="an_1:145:4:3">3</span>. Ludwig's conjecture, úpa stâ´yam
*k*arati, is very ingenious. 'He stealthily approaches them.'—On
upasthâ´yam, comp. also Bollensen, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl.
Gesellschaft, XLVII, 586.

Note <span id="an_1:145:4:4">4</span>. The meaning of *s*vântám, which
occurs here and in the obscure passage X, 61, 21 (ádha gâ´va*h* úpamâtim
kanâ´yâ*h* ánu *s*vântásya kásya *k*it párâ îyu*h*), is unknown.
Possibly it is related to *s*vâtrá, which means something like
'powerful' or 'prosperous.'

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

Note <span id="an_1:145:4:5">5</span>. The prayers? The oblations?

Note <span id="an_1:145:4:6">6</span>. Api-sthitám may have active or
passive meaning, 'he who stands on somebody or something,' and 'he on
whom somebody or something stands.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:145:5:1">1</span>. The first Pâda (and probably also
the fourth) belong to the metrical. type described by H. O.,
Prolegomena, p. 68 seq.: the first part, before the caesura, consists of
four syllables; and then the Pâda goes on as if it had the pentasyllabic
opening.

Note <span id="an_1:145:5:2">2</span>. After Agni's abode in the Waters
and in the wood has been mentioned in the first Pâda, the second Pâda
possibly refers to his heavenly abode to which the adjective upamá
(highest') seems to point. Thus the 'highest skin' would be the sky. But
Sâya*n*a, who refers it to the Vedi, may possibly be right. His
explanation would very well agree with the second hemistich.
