### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 5.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 24–25.

1\. Shining Agni has awoke over against the Dawns, the priest who traces
the footsteps of the sages [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:1:1). With his broad
stream of light kindled by the pious, the carrier (of the gods) has
opened the two doors of darkness.

2\. Agni has grown strong by praises, by the speeches of the praisers,
by hymns, the adorable one. Loving many aspects of *Ri*ta the messenger
has shone up at the bursting forth of the Dawn.

3\. Agni has been established among the tribes of men, the son of the
waters, Mitra [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:3:1), acting in the right way. The
delightful, worshipful one has reached the top; the priest has become
one who should be invoked by prayers.

4\. Agni becomes Mitra [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:4:1), when he has been
kindled; he the Hot*ri* (Agni becomes) Mitra; he, *G*âtavedas, (becomes)
Varu*n*a. The quick Adhvaryu, the domestic (god, Agni, becomes) Mitra,
the Mitra (i. e. friend or ally) of the rivers and of the mountains.

5\. He observes the deceiver's dear summit [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:1),
the footstep of the bird [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:1); the vigorous
one [2](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:2) observes the course of the Sun. Agni
observes at his (?) navel the seven-headed
(song?) [3](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:3); tall (Agni) observes the enjoyment
of the gods.

6\. The *Ri*bhu [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:1) has created for himself a
good name worthy of being magnified, he, the god who knows all laws. The
skin of the herbs [2](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:2), the bird's
footstep [3](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:3) rich in ghee: Agni watches (all)
that, never failing.

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

7\. Agni has approached the place [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:7:1) rich in
ghee (the altar), with broad passages, (the place) longing (for him),
longing (himself). He the resplendent, bright, tall purifier has made
his two parents [2](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:7:2) new again and again.

8\. As soon as born he has grown by the
grass [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:8:1), when the sprouting (grass-)blades
strengthen him with ghee. Like waters beautiful on their precipitous
path, Agni, being in the lap of his parents, has escaped into wide
space.

9\. Receiving praise the vigorous one [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:9:1) has
shone forth with his fuel, on heaven's summit, on the earth's navel. May
Agni worthy of being magnified, (being) Mitra and Mâtari*s*van, the
messenger, carry hither the gods that they may receive our sacrifice.

10\. The tall one has, by (receiving) fuel, upheld the firmament, Agni,
becoming the highest of lights, when Mâtari*s*van for the sake of the
Bh*ri*gus [1](sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:10:1) kindled the carrier of
oblations, (Agni) who dwelt in secret.

11 = III, 1, 23.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.—No verse occurs in the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:5:1:1">1</span>. On pada-vî´, comp. Pischel,
Vedische Studien, I, 299.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:5:3:1">1</span>. Mitra has here and in verse 4 two
meanings: it is the name of the god Mitra, with whom Agni is identified
(Bergaigne, Religion Védique, III, 134 seq.), and it means also 'friend'
or 'ally' (comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 186, note 1). See von Bradke,
Dyâus Asura, p. 13.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:5:4:1">1</span>. See verse 3, note 1.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:5:5:1">1</span>. All this is very enigmatical. In
the parallel passage, IV, 5, 8, we have, instead of ripá*h* ágram, the
reading rupá*h* ágram, which is confirmed by verse 7 of the same hymn
(ágre rupá*h*) and by X, 13, 3 (pá*ñk*a padâ´ni rupá*h* ánu aroham); in
support of the reading ripá*h*, on the other side, the verse, X, 79, 3
(ripá*h* upásthe antá*h*), may be quoted. The meaning of rúp is unknown;
ríp means 'deceit' and 'deceiver:' but what is the summit of the
deceiver? Bergaigne (Religion Védique, II, 77 seq.) has tried to solve
the riddle, but it is really hopeless.—The meaning of the following
words, padá*m* vé*h*, is not quite so obscure; there is at least some
probability that the bird is Agni himself (cf. below, III, 7, 7), or
possibly the sun. The latter explanation is advocated by Prof. Max
Müller, who writes: 'May it not be a description of sunrise? priyam
ripa*h* agram I do not understand; but padam ve*h* is the place of the
bird, as in I, 130, 3. ve*h* na garbham, the nest of the bird or of the
sun. This nest is covered by a stone, is in fact the vra*g*a, which has
to be opened to let out the light of day. It is also the yoni or the
altar. Ripa*h* agram may possibly be the summit of the Pa*n*i or of
V*ri*tra, X, 79, 3.'

Note <span id="an_3:5:5:2">2</span>. See above, I, 36, 1, note 2.

Note <span id="an_3:5:5:3">3</span>. Saptá-*s*îrshan ('seven-headed')
occurs again in two other passages of the Rig-veda (VIII, 51, 4, and X,
67, 1); in both it is an epithet of words which signify 'hymn' or
'prayer' (arká, dhî´). Possibly a similar word should be supplied here.
But why are the prayers called 'seven-headed?' Does this refer to
unknown technicalities of the Vedic liturgy? Does it stand in connection
with the seven tones of the scale, with the expression saptá dhîtáya*h*,
with the number of the seven Hot*ri*s? 'Celui qui a sept têtes est sans
doute un personnage équivalent à lui seul au

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

groupe des sept prêtres,' says Bergaigne (II, 145), which is very
ingenious, but should not be given as a doubtless fact.—Prof. Max Müller
observes that sapta*s*îrshan may be, like saptâsya, the vra*g*a of
Pa*n*i, opened by Agni, IV, 51, 4, and that B*ri*haspati is called
saptâsya, IV, 50, 4, and saptagu, X, 47, 6.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:5:6:1">1</span>. Agni is here called *Ri*bhu in his
quality as a skilful artisan. See Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 408.

Note <span id="an_3:5:6:2">2</span>. There seems to be no doubt that
sasá (comp. sasyá) means 'herb' or possibly 'grain' in X, 79, 3; the
text there has sasám ná pakvám; comp. I, 66, 2. yáva*h* ná pakvá*h*. The
same meaning is quite admissible in I, 51, 3; V, 21, 4; VIII, 72, 3;
though these passages are too uncertain for deciding anything. I cannot
find any reason for believing that we have here and in IV, 5, 7; 7, 7
(see below), another word derived from the root sas, and meaning 'the
sleeper.' At all events I neither pretend to know what mysteries are
hidden under the 'skin of the herbs,' nor what stories may have happened
to the 'peau du dormeur' (Bergaigne, II, 78 seq.).

Note <span id="an_3:5:6:3">3</span>. See verse 5, note 1.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:5:7:1">1</span>. Yónim, literally 'womb.'

Note <span id="an_3:5:7:2">2</span>. Probably Heaven and Earth.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_3:5:8:1">1</span>. Prof. Max Müller refers this to the
grass of the barhis, or the tender blades in which the spark is caught
and kept alive by ghee.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:5:9:1">1</span>. Comp. above, I, 36, 1, note 2.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_3:5:10:1">1</span>. I have adopted, though I do not
believe it certain, Grassmann's opinion on the meaning of pári in this
connection. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 123, note 4.
