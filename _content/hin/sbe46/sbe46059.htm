<p>1. The Hot<I>ri</I> who is found on the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat has sat down (there), the fierce, the resplendent, the dexterous one, the protector of (his own) infallible laws&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:1:1">1</A>, the highest Vasu, he who brings thousandfold (gain), the pure-tongued Agni.</p>  
<p>2. Be thou our messenger, be our protector far and wide; be thou, O bull, a leader towards greater wealth. O Agni! for the continuation of our children and of ourselves be thou an unremitting, brilliant protector.</p>  
<p>3. May we worship thee at thy highest birth (-place), O Agni; may we worship thee with praises in thy lower abode. I honour the womb from which thou hast sprung. When thou hast been kindled, they have offered offerings in thee.</p>  
<p>4. Agni, being the best sacrificer perform thou the sacrifice with the oblation. With thy readiness to hear (us) hail our gift, the wealth (which we offer). For thou art the treasure-lord of treasures; thou art the deviser of brilliant speech.</p>  
<p>5. Thy wealth of both kinds&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46059.htm#an_2:9:5:1">1</A> never fails, when thou art born (kindled) day by day, "O wonderful one. Make thy singer, O Agni, rich in food; make him the lord of wealth with excellent offspring.</p>  
<p>6. With this face of thine, as a bounteous (lord), a sacrificer to the gods, the best performer of sacrifices with happiness, as an undeceivable guardian and far-reaching protector, shine among us, O Agni, with light and wealth.</p>

<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi. Metre, Trish<I>t</I>ubh.&#8212;According to an observation of Bergaigne's, hymns of six verses composed in Trish<I>t</I>ubh should precede hymns of the same extent composed in G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. Though this law is not without exceptions (see H.&nbsp;O., Die Hymnen des Rigveda, I, 202 seq.), the suspicion is raised that the hymns 9 and 10 should each be divided into two T<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as.&#8212;Verse 1 = VS. XI, 36; TS. III, 3, 11, 2; IV, 1, 3, 3; MS. II, 7, 3. Verse 2 = TS. III, 5, 11, 2; MS. IV, 10, 4. Verse 3 = VS. XVII, 75; TS. IV, 6, 5, 4; MS. II, 10, 6. Verse 6 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 2; MS. IV, 10, 5.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:9:1:1">1</A>. The long compound looks suspicious; possibly it should be read &aacute;dabdhavrata<I>h</I> pr&aacute;mati<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:9:5:1">1</A>. V&aacute;su and dh&aacute;na frequently receive the epithet ubh&acirc;ya; see VI, 19, 10; VII, 82, 4; 83, 5; X, 84, 7. No doubt celestial and terrestrial goods are referred to, see II, 14, 11; V, 68, 3; VI, 59, 9; VII, 97, 10; IX, 19, 1; 100, 3.</p>
