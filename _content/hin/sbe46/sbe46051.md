### MA*ND*ALA II, HYMN 1.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 17–19.

1 [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:1:1). Thou, O Agni, the flaming one, (art
born) from out the Heavens [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:1:2), thou (art born)
from out the Waters and the stone (the flint); thou (art born) from out
the forests and the herbs; thou art born bright, O Lord of men, (as
belonging) to men [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:1:3).

2 [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:2:1). To thee, O Agni, belongs the Hot*ri*'s
and the Pot*ri*'s office exercised at the appointed season; to thee
belongs the office of the Nesh*tri*; thou art the
Agnîdh [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:2:2) for the righteous. To thee belongs
the office of the Pra*s*âst*ri*; thou actest as an Adhvaryu, and thou
art the Brahman and the master of the house in our
house [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:2:3).

3 [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:3:1). Thou, O Agni, art Indra, a bull among
(all) beings. Thou art the wide-ruling Vish*n*u, worthy of adoration.
Thou art the Brahman, a gainer of wealth, O
Brahma*n*aspati [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:3:2). Thou, O Vidhart*ri* (i. e.
who keepest asunder all things), art united with Pura*m*dhi (or the
Liberality of the gods) [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:3:3).

4\. Thou, O Agni, art the king Varu*n*a whose laws are firm; thou
becomest Mitra, the wondrous one, worthy of being magnified. Thou art
Aryaman, the lord of beings, whom I may
enjoy [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:4:1). Thou, O god, art
A*ms*a [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:4:2), desirous of distributing (goods) in
the assembly [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:4:3).

5\. Thou, O Agni, being Tvash*tri*, (grantest) to thy worshipper
abundance in heroes. To thee, who art accompanied by the (divine)
wives [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:1), who art great like Mitra, belongs
relationship [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:2). Thou,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

the quick inciter [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:3), givest abundance in
horses. Thou, rich in wealth, art the host of
men [4](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:5:4).

6\. Thou, O Agni, art Rudra, the Asura of the high
Heaven [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:6:1); thou, being the host of the Maruts,
rulest over nourishment. Thou goest along with the flame-coloured Winds,
bringing happiness to our home. Thou, being Pûshan, protectest thy
worshippers by thy own might.

7\. Thou, O Agni, art a giver of wealth to him who does service to
thee [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:7:1); thou art the god Savit*ri*, a
bestower of treasures. Thou, being Bhaga, O lord of men, rulest over
wealth. Thou art a protector in his house to him who has worshipped
thee. [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:7:2).

8\. Towards thee, in the house, the lord of the clan, O Agni, the clans
strive, towards thee, the bounteous king. Thou with the beautiful face
possessest all things. Thou art equal to thousands, to hundreds, to ten
(of others).

9\. Thee, O Agni, men (make) their father by their
sacrifices [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:9:1); thee who shinest with thy body
they (invite) to brotherhood by their (sacrificial) work. Thou becomest
a son to him who has worshipped thee. As a kind friend thou protectest
against attack.

10\. Thou, O Agni, art *Ri*bhu, to be adored when near. Thou rulest over
strength [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:10:1), over wealth rich in food. Thou
shinest [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:10:2), thou burnest for the sake of
giving (wealth). Thou art a hewer [3](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:10:3), an
expander of sacrifice.

11\. Thou, Agni, O god, art Aditi to the worshipper. Thou, being Hotrâ
Bhâratî [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:11:1), growest strong by prayer. Thou
art I*d*â, living a hundred winters, for (the increase of) ability.
Thou, the killer of V*ri*tra, O Lord of wealth, art
Sarasvatî [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:11:2).

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

12\. Thou, O Agni, well kept, art the highest vital power. In thy lovely
colour and in thy appearance (dwell all) beauties. Thou art great
strength that carries us forward. Thou art abundant wealth, extending on
all sides.

13\. The Âdityas have made thee, O Agni, their mouth; the bright ones
have made thee their tongue, O Sage. The Râti-sâ*k* gods (i. e. the
'bounteous' gods) accompany thee at the sacrifices. In thee the gods eat
the offering which is offered to them.

14\. In thee, O Agni, with (thy) mouth [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:14:1) all
the guileless [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:14:2) immortal gods eat the
offering which is offered to them. Through thee the mortals taste their
drink. Thou hast been born, the bright one, as the child of the plants.

15 [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:15:1). Thou art united with them and equal to
them in strength, O well-born Agni, nay, thou surpassest them, O god,
when thy power [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:15:2) has expanded here in its
greatness over Heaven and Earth, over both worlds.

16\. The liberal lords who pour out, O Agni, over thy praisers gifts at
the head of which there are cows [1](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:16:1), the
ornament of which are horses: lead both ourselves and them to welfare.
May we speak loud in the assembly [2](sbe46051.htm#an_2:1:16:2), rich in
valiant men.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is G*ri*tsamada, the metre *G*agatî.—Verse 1 = VS. XI, 27;
TS. IV, 1, 2, 5; TÂ. X, 76, 1; MS. II, 7, 2. Verse 2 = RV. X, 91, 10.
Verse 6 = TS. I, 3, 14, 1; TB. III, 12, 2, 1. Verse 13 = TB. II, 7, 12,
6.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_2:1:1:1">1</span>. Among the numerous texts which
treat of the different origins of Agni (see Bergaigne, I, 20 seq.),
especially the following two verses may be compared with this passage:
VI, 48, 5. yám â´pa*h* ádraya*h* vánâ gárbham *ri*tásya píprati sáhasâ
yá*h* mathitá*h* *g*â´yate n*rí*bhi*h* p*ri*thivyâ´*h* ádhi sâ´navi; X,
45, 1. divá*h* pári prathamám *g*a*gñ*e agní*h* asmát dvitî´yam pári
*g*âtávedâ*h* t*ri*tî´yam apsú n*ri*mánâ*h* á*g*asram índhâna enam
*g*arate svâdhî´*h*.

Note <span id="an_2:1:1:2">2</span>. The text (dyúbhi*h* tvám
â*s*u*s*ukshá*n*i*h*) seems to be corrupt. I believe that tvám, which is
so frequently repeated through this verse and through the next verses,
has been put here in the wrong place, and that we should read,
dyúbhya*h* â´ *s*u*s*ukshá*n*i*h*.

Note <span id="an_2:1:1:3">3</span>. With the last words of this verse,
comp. the conclusion of verse 24.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_2:1:2:1">1</span>. This whole verse is repeated, X,
91, 10.

Note <span id="an_2:1:2:2">2</span>. In my opinion there is no doubt
that instead of the traditional reading, agnít, the correct form is
agnî´t. The word is a compound of agní and idh and means 'the inflamer
of the fire.' Cf. M. M., Hist. of A. S. L., 1859, pp. 450, 469.

Note <span id="an_2:1:2:3">3</span>. This is the most ancient list of
the 'seven priests,' by the side of whom the g*ri*há-pati or 'master of
the house' is mentioned as the eighth. Comp. the formula in which the
Adhvaryu names the officiating priests, Kâtyâyana IX, 8, 8 seq., and see
the remarks of Weber, Indische Studien, X, 141, 376, and my own
exposition, Religion des Veda, 383 seq., 396. The 'Brahman' mentioned in
our verse is the Brâhma*n*â*kkh*a*m*sin of the later ritual. Comp.
Kâtyâyana IX, 8, 11; *S*atapatha Brâhma*n*a IV, 6, 6, 5.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_2:1:3:1">1</span>. On verses 3–6, see von Bradke,
Dyâus Asura, p. 52 seq.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

Note <span id="an_2:1:3:2">2</span>. B*ri*haspati or Brahma*n*aspati is
the Brahman among the gods. But it is doubtful whether the title of
Brahman in this connection should be understood in the later technical
sense of the word, as the Ritvi*g* who has to superintend the whole
sacrifice. Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, 396, note 1.

Note <span id="an_2:1:3:3">3</span>. Vidhart*ri* seems to be here
another name of Bhaga; (comp. VII, 41, 2. bhágam huvema … yá*h*
vidhartâ´). It is known that no god is so frequently mentioned in
connection with Pura*m*dhi as Bhaga. The passages have been collected by
Grassmann in his Dictionary, s. v. púra*m*-dhi.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_2:1:4:1">1</span>. Prof. von Bradke (Dyâus Asura, 53)
believes that the text is corrupt; he thinks that the fourth Pâda may
have occupied the place of a lost continuation of the relative clause,
yásya sam-bhú*g*am. I cannot but share the feeling on which Prof. von
Bradke's remark rests, though I do not believe that the solution of the
difficulty which he proposes is very probable. Could not the correct
reading be yâsi (instead of yásya) sam-bhú*g*am, 'thou goest to the
enjoyment (of goods)?' Comp. VI, 71, 6, where the traditional text has
vâmásya hí ksháyasya deva bhû´re*h*, and ksháyasya doubtless should be
changed into ksháyasi.

Note <span id="an_2:1:4:2">2</span>. On A*ms*a, as one of the Âdityas,
comp. Bergaigne, III, 39, 99.

Note <span id="an_2:1:4:3">3</span>. Vidáthe: comp. the note on I, 31,
6. It is tempting to conjecture vidhaté (comp. verse 5), but there is no
necessity for such a conjecture. Comp., for instance, VI, 24, 2. vidáthe
dâti vâ´*g*am.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_2:1:5:1">1</span>. Gnâva*h* should be read without
accent, as Grassmann, Prof. Weber, and M. Henry (Revue Critique, Jan.
12, 1891, p. 23) have seen. Cf. Lanman, 518, 519.

Note <span id="an_2:1:5:2">2</span>. The meaning probably is, 'Thou art
related to the other gods and to men,' or 'Thou art related to us.'
Comp. VIII, 27, 10; 73, 12.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

Note <span id="an_2:1:5:3">3</span>. Agni seems to be identified here
with Apâm napât, who frequently is called â*s*u-héman. Comp. Windisch,
Festgruss an Roth, 143 seq.

Note <span id="an_2:1:5:4">4</span>. The men, of course, are the Maruts,
as is shown by the well-known use of *s*árdha*h* (cf. vol. xxxii, p. 67
seq.).

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_2:1:6:1">1</span>. Comp. von Bradke, Dyâus Asura, J3
seq.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_2:1:7:1">1</span>. As to ara*m*k*rí*te, cf. VIII, 67,
3.

Note <span id="an_2:1:7:2">2</span>. Or, thou art a protector to him who
has worshipped thee in his house.—Among the various ways for explaining
or removing the metrical deficiency of the last Pâda the correction dáme
â´ (for dáme) is recommended by verse 8.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_2:1:9:1">1</span>. Ish*t*íbhi*h*, standing by the side
of *s*ámyâ, seems to be derived from the root ya*g*. Thus î*g*é, î*g*âná
stand by the side of *s*a*s*amé, *s*a*s*amâná.—Cf. ish*t*íbhi*h*
matíbhi*h*, II, 18, 1.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_2:1:10:1">1</span>. The names of the three *Ri*bhus
are *Ri*bhu, Vâ*g*a, Vibhvan. The word vâ´*g*a used here evidently
alludes to the second of these names.

Note <span id="an_2:1:10:2">2</span>. Bergaigne (Religion Véd., II, 406)
no doubt is right in believing that the verb ví bhâsi ('thou shinest')
alludes to the name Vibhvan. Comp. X, 91, 1. vibhú*h* vibhâ´vâ.

Note <span id="an_2:1:10:3">3</span>. Vi-*s*íkshu*h* again seems to
convey an allusion to the *Ri*bhu myth. When dividing the cup of
Tvash*tri* into four cups, the *Ri*bhus say, sákhe ví *s*iksha (IV, 35,
3). This ví *s*iksha and the corresponding adjective vi-*s*íkshu should
be derived from the root *s*as, 'to cut to pieces.'

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_2:1:11:1">1</span>. Here we have the three goddesses
of the Âprî hymns, Bhâratî, I*d*â, and Sarasvatî. Of the goddess

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bhâratî the full
name is given, Hotrâ Bhâratî, i. e. 'the Offering of the Bharatas.'
Comp. Bergaigne, I, 322 seq.

Note <span id="an_2:1:11:2">2</span>. Comp. VI, 6.1, 7, where Sarasvatî
is called v*rí*traghnî´.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_2:1:14:1">1</span>. Or 'through (thee who art their)
mouth.'

Note <span id="an_2:1:14:2">2</span>. Comp. I, 19, 3. ví*s*ve devâ´sa*h*
adrúha*h*; vol. xxxii, pp. 53, 55.

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_2:1:15:1">1</span>. On this verse, compare Pischel,
Vedische Studien, I, 97.

Note <span id="an_2:1:15:2">2</span>. On p*ri*kshá*h*, see above, I,
127, 5, note 1.

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_2:1:16:1">1</span>. On gó-agra, compare Pischel,
Vedische Studien, I, 51.

Note <span id="an_2:1:16:2">2</span>. Vidáthe: comp. the note on I, 31,
6.
