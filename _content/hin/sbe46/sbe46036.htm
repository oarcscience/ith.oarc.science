<p>1. I deem Agni to be the munificent Hot<I>ri</I>, the Vasu, the Son of strength&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:1">1</A>, <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, like a priest, <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:2">2</A>: the best performer of the sacrifice, the god who with his upright body that is turned towards the gods, and with his flame longs for the shine of the (boiling) ghee&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:1:3">3</A>, of the butter that is offered in (the fire).</p>  
<p>2. May we, the sacrificers, call thee hither, the best of sacrificers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:1">1</A>, the first of the A&#7749;giras, O priest, with our prayers, with priestly prayers, O bright one&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:2">2</A>: thee who like the heaven encompassest the earth&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:2:3">3</A>, the Hot<I>ri</I> of human tribes, the manly flame-haired, whom these folks&#8212;whom all folks should favour in order to speed him (to our sacrifice).</p>  
<p>3. He indeed, shining mightily with his shining strength&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:1">1</A>, becomes the conqueror of deceitful foes&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:2">2</A>&#8212;like an axe, the conqueror of deceitful foes&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:2">2</A>.

Conquering he holds himself back; he does not proceed&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:6">6</A>. As with a conquering bow-man he proceeds&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:3:6">6</A>.</p>  
<p>4. Even what is firm gives way before him: thus it is known. With hottest kindling-sticks&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:1">1</A> one worships him&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:4:2">2</A> for winning his favour, one worships Agni for winning his favour.

<p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></A></p>  
<p>5. Let us place that power&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:1">1</A> of his in our neighbourhood&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:2">2</A>&#8212;(that power) which is more visible by night than by day&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:3">3</A>&#8212;(more visible) than by day to the unremitting&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:4">4</A> (worshipper). Therefore his life is a firm hold&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:5">5</A>, like (a father's) safe refuge to a son: (the fires) that never grow old, tending to blessings enjoyed or not enjoyed (before)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:5:6">6</A>&#8212;the fires that never grow old, tending (to such blessings).</p>  
<p>6. He indeed makes a mighty noise like the host of the Maruts, &#8230;&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1">1</A> on the rich fields, &#8230;&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1">1</A> on the &#8230;&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:1">1</A>. He, the seizer, ate the offerings&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:6:2">2</A>, he who has deservedly become the banner of the sacrifice. And when he joyously and joyfully (proceeds), all followed gladly on his path; men (have followed) his path as for a triumphal procession.</p>  
<p>7. When forsooth the K&icirc;stas&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:1">1</A> striving for heaven, when the Bh<I>ri</I>gus have addressed him paying reverence&#8212;the Bh<I>ri</I>gus producing him by attrition, with worship: Agni is the lord of goods, the bright one, who is their&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:2">2</A> supporter. May the wise one accept the wonted coverings&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:7:3">3</A>; may the wise one accept them.</p>  
<p>8. We invoke thee, the lord of all people, the common master of the house of all, to enjoy (the sacrifice): (we call) thee who truly art carried by prayers as by a vehicle&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:8:1">1</A> to enjoy (the sacrifice): the guest of men in whose presence (they live) as before a father's (face), and all those immortals (attain) to strength, and the offerings among the gods (attain) to strength.</p>  
<p>9. Thou, O Agni, art born, the mightiest by might&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:9:1">1</A>, for the divine world, the strongest one, like wealth for the divine world. For thy delight is most strong, and thy power is most brilliant. And</p>

<p>10.

<p>11. Thus being seen by us, bring near to us, O Agni, graciously united with the gods, benignantly, great wealth benignantly. Make us behold great (bliss of valiant offspring&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46036.htm#an_1:127:11:1">1</A>), O mightiest one, that we may obtain such enjoyment. Produce great bliss of valiant offspring, O bountiful Lord, (as fire is produced) by attrition, for those who praise thee, like a strong hero in thy might.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The <I>Ri</I>shi is Paru<I>k</I><I>kh</I>epa Daivod&acirc;si, the metre Atyash<I>t</I>i (verse 6 Atidh<I>ri</I>ti).&#8212;Verses 1&#8211;3 = SV. II, 1163&#8211;1165. Verse 1 = SV. I, 465; VS. XV, 47; TS. IV, 4, 4, 8; MS. II, 13, 8; AV. XX, 67, 3.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:1:1">1</A>. There is no doubt that the reading of the Rig-veda text v&aacute;sum is correct; the S&acirc;ma-veda has v&aacute;so<I>h</I>. Comp. H.&nbsp;O., Prolegomena, p. 280.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:1:2">2</A>. 'Is it a play on the word? Like a priest knowing all things?' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:1:3">3</A>. There is a metrical irregularity in this P&acirc;da; it has six syllables instead of five before the caesura. The text, however, seems to be correct.</p>  
<p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:2:1">1</A>. The first P&acirc;da is Trish<I>t</I>ubh instead of <I>G</I>agat&icirc;. It would be easy to correct huvemahi, but that form is never found in the Rig-veda, though both huvema and hav&acirc;mahe are frequent. Thus it is very probable that we have here a metrical irregularity of the type described by H.&nbsp;O., Prolegomena, p. 117.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:2:2">2</A>. Comp. VIII, 60, 3. v&iacute;prebhi<I>h</I> <I>s</I>ukra m&aacute;nmabhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:2:3">3</A>. If the explanation of p&aacute;ri<I>g</I>man which we have adopted (see above, I, 79, 3, note 2) is correct, it will be impossible, of course, to accept Bergaigne's opinion (Rel. V&eacute;d., II, 505, note I) that the accusative dy&acirc;&acute;m is governed by p&aacute;ri<I>g</I>m&acirc;nam.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:3:1">1</A>. In the second P&acirc;da one syllable is wanting. The text seems to be correct, and the irregularity apparently is the typical one described by H.&nbsp;O., Prolegomena, p. 68 seq.: the P&acirc;da has the tetrasyllabic beginning (before the caesura), and it goes on as if the beginning had been pentasyllabic. Several P&acirc;das of the same irregular structure occur in our hymn, thus in verse 9: tv&aacute;m (read tu&aacute;m) agne || s&aacute;has&acirc; s&aacute;hantama<I>h</I>; verse 10: pr&aacute; va<I>h</I> mah&eacute; || s&aacute;has&acirc; s&aacute;hasvate; usha<I>h</I>-b&ucirc;dhe || pa<I>s</I>u-s&eacute; n&aacute; agn&aacute;ye.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:3:2">2</A>. The comparison para<I>s</I>&uacute;<I>h</I> n&aacute;, 'like an axe,' raises doubts as to the correctness of druham-tar&aacute;<I>h</I>. Para<I>s</I>&uacute;<I>h</I> seems to point to a compound containing the element dr&uacute;, 'wood;' comp. below, 130, 4; VII, 104, 21. The second member of the compound would be han, which is frequently used with the meaning of cutting wood (II, 14, 2; X, 89, 7). Thus the reading would be dru-h&aacute;ntara<I>h</I> (comp. v<I>ri</I>tra-h&aacute;ntama<I>h</I>), 'a mighty wood-cutter.' As to this use of the comparative, see Delbr&uuml;ck. Altindische Syntax, p. 196.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:3:3">3</A>. Comp. V, 7, 2. y&aacute;sya s&aacute;m<I>ri</I>tau.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:3:4">4</A>. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller (Science of Thought, p. 325) . believes that the root <I>s</I>ru occurs here in the sense of shaking. To me it seems that this <I>s</I>r&uacute;vat is a misspelling</p>  
<p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A></p>  
<p>for sr&uacute;vat. The opinion of Pischel and Geldner (Vedische Studien, I, p. vi) is different.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:3:5">5</A>. The meaning of the comparison which I have indicated by the words in parentheses, becomes clear from VIII, 40, 1. v&aacute;n&acirc;-iva v&acirc;&acute;te &iacute;t.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:3:6">6</A>. The two last P&acirc;das are very obscure. In the last P&acirc;da but one n&aacute; would seem to be comparative, not negative, because it has the same meaning in the last P&acirc;da, and because its vowel does not coalesce with the following initial vowel (comp. Benfey's dissertation, 'Behandlung des auslautenden a in n&aacute; "wie" and n&aacute; "nicht."' But then instead of yamate a substantive meaning something like 'hero' would be required. And also instead of the instrumental dhanva-s&aacute;h&acirc; one should expect to find a nominative; comp. Benfey, Vedica and Linguistica, p. 180, note 1.&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller translates: 'Holding out (or resisting) he stands firm, he does not budge; holding his bow he does not budge.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:4:1">1</A>. The words t&eacute;<I>g</I>ish<I>th</I>&acirc;bhi<I>h</I> ar&aacute;<I>n</I>ibhi<I>h</I> are repeated, probably by the same poet, below, 129, 5.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:4:2">2</A>. It may be observed that several times in the Paru<I>k</I><I>kh</I>epa hymns the parallelism between two subsequent P&acirc;das has corrupted the text, the reading of the one P&acirc;da being wrongly introduced into the other. For instances I refer to I, 129, 11, where the last vaso has been added from the preceding P&acirc;da, and to the last P&acirc;da but one of I, 135, 4. Possibly our P&acirc;da, which in its traditional form is metrically abnormal (comp., however, M.&nbsp;M.&#8217;s Hymns to the Maruts, 1st ed., p. cxii), has suffered damage in the same way. The comparison of I, 129, 5 would lead us to conjecture: t&eacute;<I>g</I>ish<I>th</I>&acirc;bhi<I>h</I> ar&aacute;<I>n</I>ibhi<I>h</I> n&aacute; &aacute;vase. 'One worships him in order that he may grant his favour as if (he were to help us) with hottest kindling-sticks. One worships Agni in order that he may grant his favour.'</p>

M.&nbsp;M., vol. xxxii, p. 302; Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, p. 96 seq. The translation of such a word can only be tentative.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:5:2">2</A>. To &uacute;par&acirc;su something like viksh&uacute; (IV, 37, 3) seems to be supplied.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:5:4">4</A>. &Aacute;pr&acirc;yus seems to be an anomalous formation, instead of &aacute;pr&acirc;yu, unless we have to read &aacute;pr&acirc;yuve. According to Pischel (G&ouml;ttinger Gel. Anzeigen, 1890, p. 542), &aacute;pr&acirc;yushe would mean 'dem der da lebt.' But I do not think that this &aacute;pr&acirc;yus should be separated from &aacute;pr&acirc;yu, which, as may be seen from I, 89, I compared with III, 5, 6 and X, 4, 7, is identical in meaning with, and evidently etymologically related to, &aacute;prayu<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ant.</p>

For &acirc;&acute;rtan&acirc; he proposes the translation, 'ploughed field.' I have left both words un-translated.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:7:1">1</A>. Who the K&icirc;stas (cf. Lanman, p. 346) are is not known. They seem, however, either to be identical with the Bh<I>ri</I>gus or to be another ancient and probably mythical family of priests like them. They are mentioned also in VI, 67, 10.</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:8:1">1</A>. V&acirc;&acute;has and its compounds, such as st&oacute;mav&acirc;has, ukth&aacute;v&acirc;has, g&iacute;rv&acirc;has, have been treated of by Dr. Neisser in his ingenious article on v&aacute;hni, Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, XVIII, 301 seq. (comp. on v&aacute;hni, vol. xxxii, p. 37 seq.). Dr. Neisser tries to show that by the side of v&aacute;hni, derived from vah = Latin vehere, and meaning 'draught-horse' (and besides&#8212;though Dr. Neisser does not admit this, see p. 316&#8212;'a person that drives in a chariot'), there existed a second substantive v&aacute;hni connected with the Greek &#0949;&#8020;&#0967;&#0949;&#0963;&#0952;&#0945;&#0953;, and meaning both 'erhaben' and 'erhebend,' i.&nbsp;e. praising the gods (loc. cit., p. 314). With this second v&aacute;hni he connects v&acirc;&acute;has and its compounds. One of the principal arguments of Dr. Neisser is the fact quite correctly stated by him (p. 301), that 'the word v&aacute;hni very frequently associates itself to the term h&oacute;t<I>ri</I>, while it does not with the compounds havyav&aacute;h and havyav&acirc;&acute;hana.' This fact, indeed, points to the conclusion that 'those compounds belong to another sphere of ideas than v&aacute;hni' (p. 302). But Dr. Neisser seems to me to go too far in concluding that v&aacute;hni, standing as an epithet of Agni, is not derived from vah = vehere. Agni's action consists not only in carrying the sacrificial food to the gods, but also in carrying the gods to the sacrifice of men, and in coming to that sacrifice himself with his chariot and his horses. Nor do the words st&oacute;mav&acirc;has or ukth&aacute;v&acirc;has, if derived from vah = vehere, necessarily presuppose the admissibility of expressions such as 'uktham (stomam) vahati vipra<I>h</I> dev&acirc;n a<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a' (p. 303), but those compounds may also rest on an idea conveyed by expressions such as 'uktham (stoma<I>h</I>) vahati dev&acirc;n upa ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>am,' which idea is quite Vedic. Thus st&oacute;mav&acirc;has in my opinion means, as an epithet of the god, 'carried by the stoma as by a vehicle' (comp. VII, 24, 5. esh&aacute; st&oacute;ma<I>h</I> mah&eacute; ugr&acirc;&acute;ya v&acirc;&acute;he dhur&iacute;-iva &aacute;tya<I>h</I> n&aacute; v&acirc;<I>g</I>&aacute;yan adh&acirc;yi). or, as an epithet of the human worshippers, fitting out the</p>  
<p><a name="page_136"><font size="1" color="green">p. 136</font></A></p>  
<p>stoma as a vehicle.' I believe that the words in question can thus be explained in conformity with the whole range of Vedic thought, and the artificial distinction of two different substantives v&aacute;hni, &amp;c., will be avoided. For special indications pointing in the same direction, which are furnished by the passages which contain the words here treated of, I refer to Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, II, 286 seq., and to the article of Dr. Neisser himself, p. 321 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:10:4">4</A>. <I>G</I>arate, 'he wakes,' at the same time can mean 'he sings,' and 'he is praised.' Comp. Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, X III, 298.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:10:5">5</A>. The translation 'dawn' is conjectural only. But it gives a good meaning in all the passages which contain the word <I>ri</I>sh&ucirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;m (besides our passage, V, 25, 1; VIII, 71, 15; X, 6, 1). Prof. Max M&uuml;ller translates the last two P&acirc;das: 'he sings like Rebha at the head of all singers, like a clever Hot<I>ri</I> among the singers.'&#8212;Comp. Lanman, p. 424.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:127:11:1">1</A>. I supply suv&icirc;&acute;ryam; see the last P&acirc;da but one.</p>
