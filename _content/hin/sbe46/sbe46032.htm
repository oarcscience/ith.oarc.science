<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:1:2">2</A>. Two new discussions on dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; have been given by Hillebrandt (Ved. Mythologie, I, 175 seq.; comp. the criticisms of Ludwig, Ueber die neuesten arbeiten auf dem gebiete der R&#803;gveda-forschung, 85 seq.) and Pischel (Ved. Studien, II, 82 seq.). Hillebrandt arrives at the conclusion that dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; is the Earth (in the dual, Heaven and Earth; in the plural, Heaven. Air, and Earth), and besides the Vedi, i.&nbsp;e. the excavated spot of ground which serves as a kind of altar for the sacrifice. Similar is</p>  
<p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="green">p. 121</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Pischel's opinion. He believes that the singular dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; is everywhere to be interpreted as a proper name: the name of a goddess of wealth and prosperity. The dual dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>e means 'Heaven and Earth:' thus the original meaning of dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; must have been, as Pischel concludes, either Heaven or Earth. He tries to show that it is Earth, and so does Prof. Hillebrandt. The goddess of wealth originally was a goddess of the earth conceived as the liberal giver of wealth. This goddess, Prof. Pischel thinks, was closely related to, or even identical with, the goddess Aditi, whom the same scholar also believes to be a personification of the Earth.</p>  
<p>I must confess that even this close agreement of these two distinguished scholars has failed to convince me. It is quite true that the dual dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>e means Heaven and Earth, and it is possible that the singular may, at least in some passages, mean the Earth. But I cannot believe that this is the original meaning of the word. Originally, in my opinion, dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; was an implement used at the sacrifice, more especially at the Soma sacrifice. The &aacute;dr&icirc; (Soma-stones) are said to rest in the lap of the dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; (I, 109, 3). In a Ya<I>g</I>us Mantra referring to the sacrificial preparation of Soma (V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; VI, 26) the dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc;, or more exactly the Dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc;s, as goddesses (dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a dev&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I>), are mentioned together with the sacrificial fire, the waters, and the gr&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>, the stones. In a similar connection we find a Ya<I>g</I>us formula pronounced when the Adhvaryu began to beat the Soma plants with the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>usavana stone (see Weber, Indische Studien, X, 370). There the Soma was addressed first, and then the two Dhisha<I>n</I>&acirc;s: 'Do not be afraid, do not be terrified, assume sap (O Soma!). O two Dhisha<I>n</I>&acirc;s! Being firm show firmness!' (V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; VI, 35). Here the <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (III, 9, 4, 18) says, that some authorities refer the last words to the two boards (phalake) on which the pressing-stones rest (see Hillebrandt, Ved. Mythologie, I, 149 seq.). But the author of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a himself declares that Heaven and Earth are addressed; for as to the boards</p>  
<p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></A></p>  
<p>used for pressing the Soma, it would be of no consequence if they were broken.&#8212;Other passages in which the dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I> are mentioned in connection with the preparation of the Soma, are Rig-veda IX, 59, 2; X, 17, 2. In the last passage the lap of the Dh.' is mentioned as in I, 109, 3 (see above). The dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; was anointed, I, 102, 1. The dhish&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; is mentioned in connection with the waters which were fetched by the Adhvaryus and used at the sacrifice, X, 30, 6, and in connection with the sacrificial fire, III, 2, 1, and in our passage. I have therefore no doubt that according to the original meaning the Dhisha<I>n</I>&acirc; was, as stated above, a sacrificial implement used chiefly, though not exclusively, at the pressing of the Soma. I do not venture to determine the exact nature of this implement, but I think that from the passages collected above it will be evident that it was a sort of support on which the pressing-stones rested. A similar support may have been used for the vessel containing the sacrificial water, and for the sacrificial fire. This support was considered as yielding the Soma to Indra, as strengthening Indra, as inciting Indra and the gods to liberality towards men. Thus we have a goddess Dhisha<I>n</I>&acirc; who wears the aspect of a goddess of wealth. She is invoked as one of the Gn&acirc;s in I, 22, 10 with Hotr&acirc; Bh&acirc;rat&icirc;. Finally the Earth, the support of everything, was likened to this support of the pressing-stones and of the Soma; and Heaven and Earth were then considered as the two Dhisha<I>n</I>&acirc;s.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:2:1">1</A>. On the solemn formulas of invocation, called Nivids, see Haug's Aitareya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, p. 32 seq.; Weber, Indische Studien, IX, 355; H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 387, note 2. Of course, the Nivids which <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana (<I>S</I>rautas&ucirc;tra VIII, 16&#8211;25) gives, cannot be those to which the poets of the Rig-veda several times allude.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:2:2">2</A>. On &Acirc;yu as one of the mythical ancestors of</p>  
<p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A></p>  
<p>mankind, nearly related to Manu, see Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, I, 59 seq.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:2:3">3</A>. Ushas is called viv&aacute;svat&icirc;, III, 30, 13 (cf. Bergaigne, I, 86); we are justified, consequently. in translating viv&aacute;svat&acirc; <I>k</I>&aacute;kshas&acirc;, 'with the irradiating look.' But in giving this translation we should not forget that the poet no doubt at the same time intended to allude to the name of Vivasvat, the father of Yama.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:3:1">1</A>. The text has &icirc;<I>l</I>ata. Comp. above, I, 1, 1, note 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:3:2">2</A>. Agni seems to be called Bharat&aacute; as belonging to the people of Bharatas. Comp. H.&nbsp;O., 'Buddha, sein Leben, seine Lehre, seine Gemeinde' (first edition), p. 414 seq. More usually Agni is designated as Bh&acirc;&acute;rata.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:3:3">3</A>. S<I>ri</I>pr&aacute;d&acirc;num. On d&acirc;&acute;nu, the meaning of which I consider to be 'rain' or the like, comp. the discussion of Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, vol. xxxii, 113 seq. The exact meaning of s<I>ri</I>pr&aacute;, which should not be compared with the Greek &#0955;&#0953;&#0960;&#0945;&#0961;&#8057;&#0962;, cannot be determined. The etymology is a very unsafe guide in such questions, and neither the connection with the root s<I>ri</I>p, 'to creep,' 'to crawl,' nor with the noun sarp&iacute;s, 'butter,' seems to lead to a satisfactory result. The passages in which s<I>ri</I>pr&aacute; or compounds of this adjective occur, point to a meaning like 'great,' 'mighty,' 'fine.' Thus s<I>ri</I>pr&aacute;bho<I>g</I>as seems to be something like purubh&oacute;<I>g</I>as or subh&oacute;<I>g</I>as; Indra's arms (kar&aacute;sna) are called both s<I>ri</I>pr&aacute; (VIII, 32, 10) and p<I>ri</I>th&uacute; (VI, 19, 3); finally s<I>ri</I>pr&aacute;d&acirc;nu, which is used here as an epithet of Agni, and VIII, 25, 5 of Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, does not seem to differ very much from sud&acirc;&acute;nu.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:4:1">1</A>. M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, the messenger of Vivasvat, who carried the fire from heaven to earth, was originally distinct from Agni, but is identified with him in several passages. See M.&nbsp;M., Physical Religion, p. 152; Bergaigne. Religion V&eacute;dique, I; 52 seq.; H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 122.</p>  
<p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:5:1">1</A>. Comp. above, 95, 1, and I, 113, 2. r&uacute;<I>s</I>advats&acirc;. The calf, of course, is Agni.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:5:2">2</A>. Literally, 'turned towards each other.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:5:3">3</A>. The gold is again Agni.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:6:1">1</A>. The first P&acirc;da is identical with X, 139, 3.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:6:2">2</A>. I prefer with Ludwig to take v&eacute;<I>h</I> as a nominative (comp. Lanman, Noun-Inflection, 375) instead of a genitive.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:7:1">1</A>. Compare the very obscure verse X, 31, 5. iy&aacute;m s&acirc;&acute; bh&ucirc;y&acirc; ush&aacute;s&acirc;m iva ksh&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, 'may she be the earth, as it were, of the dawns.' 'She' may possibly be the earth, which would be designated here as a dwelling-place or support of the dawns.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:96:8:1">1</A>. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller proposes another translation of s&aacute;nara. He writes: 'One expects an opposition between tur&aacute; and s&aacute;nara. S&aacute;nara can hardly be the same as v&icirc;r&aacute;vat in the next line. I should like to take s&aacute;nara as a variety of s&aacute;na and san&acirc;t&aacute;na. Give us fleeting, i.&nbsp;e. daily wealth, and give us old, i.&nbsp;e. lasting wealth!'</p>
