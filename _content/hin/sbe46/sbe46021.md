### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 71.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 15–16.

1\. The loving (women) have (amorously)
excited [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:1:1) their lover, as wives of the same
nest (house) their own husband. The sisters have delighted in the dark
and in the red (goddess) [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:1:2), as the cows in
the brightly shining dawn.

2\. Our fathers, the Aṅgiras [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:2:1), have broken
even the strong fortresses by their hymns, the rock by their shouting.
They have opened to us the path of the great heaven; they have obtained
day and sun and the shine of the dawn [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:2:2).

3\. They founded the *Ri*ta; they set into motion the thought of
it [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:1). Thus then the widely-spread
(prayers) [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:2) of the
poor [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:3) which seek to obtain (wealth), which
are free from thirst [4](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:4), the active,
approach [5](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:5) the tribe of the
gods [6](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:3:6), strengthening them by offering them
delight.

4\. When Mâtari*s*van had produced him by attrition, he, the reddish,
the noble one, who was brought to many
places [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:4:1), has come to every house. Then the
Bh*ri*gu-like [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:4:2) has undertaken the
messengership [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:4:3) (for the mortal) as for a
mightier king, being attached to him.

5\. When he had created sap to the great father Heaven, the knowing one
stealthily approached the speckled (cows). The archer fiercely shot an
arrow at him. The god turned his impetuous power against his
daughter [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:5:1).

6\. Augment, O Agni, twofold the strength of

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

the man who worships [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:6:1) thee in his house, or
offers adoration to the loving one [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:6:2) day by
day. May he whom thou incitest be united with
riches [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:6:3).

7\. Every nourishment goes towards Agni [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:7:1),
as the seven young [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:7:2) rivers (flow) into the
ocean. Our strength does not shine from
kinsmen [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:7:3). Do thou therefore who knowest
this, procure among the gods kindness for us.

8 [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:1). When the sharp
splendour [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:2) reached the lord of men to
incite him [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:3), the bright sperm poured down
from Heaven (or, from the god Dyaus) [4](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:4), Agni
produced [5](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:5) and furthered the blameless,
young, well-wishing host [6](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:8:6).

9\. He who traverses the paths quickly [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:9:1)
like thought, the Sun alone rules over wealth altogether. (There are)
the two kings Mitra and Varu*n*a with graceful
hands [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:9:2), who watch over the beloved
ambrosia [3](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:9:3) in the cows.

10\. Do not forget, O Agni, who art a sage possessed of
knowledge [1](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:10:1), our paternal friendship. Old
age impairs the appearance (of men) as a cloud (covers the sun or the
sky). Before this curse (attains us), think thou (of
us) [2](sbe46021.htm#an_1:71:10:2).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.

Though the hymns 71–73 are not composed in the Virâ*g* metre like the
preceding hymns, it is shown by 'manifold evidence that they had the
same origin. Verse 8 = VS. XXXIII, 11; TS. I, 3, 14, 6; MS. IV, 14, 15.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:71:1:1">1</span>. Comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien,
II, 134.

Note <span id="an_1:71:1:2">2</span>. if the text is correct, the
'sisters' may either

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

be the ten fingers which generate Agni by attrition (III, 29, 13; IV, 6,
8), or the streams of water among which Agni grows up, or streams of
Gh*ri*ta or the like (comp. II, 5, 5 see below). Why these sisters are
said to delight in the dark and in the bright goddess, the Night and the
Dawn, remains doubtful.

But I think there are reasons which strongly recommend a correction of
the text. In III, 55, II we read *s*yâ´vî *k*a … árushî *k*a svásârau,
'the two sisters, the dark one and the red one.' Is it not probable that
in our passage also it is the sisters who are described as dark and red?
The dark goddess and the red goddess of course are Night and Dawn, and
Night and Dawn, as is well known, are sisters in Vedic poetry. And
furthermore the 'sisters' are described in our verse as amorously
exciting the god Agni: for it cannot well be doubted that the svásâra*h*
of the third Pâda are identical with the u*s*atî´*h* of the first:
similarly it is said in 70, 7—in a hymn belonging to the same collection
with out Sûkta—that the Nights and Dawns augment Agni's greatness; in
other passages Agni is represented as beloved by the Dawn, or as suckled
by Night and Dawn (Bergaigne, Religion Védique, II, 14. 15). The
'sisters' then are stated in our verse to delight (a*g*ushran), probably
in Agni: now we read in II, 2, 2. abhí tvâ náktî*h* ushása*h* vavâ*s*ire
ágne vatsám ná svásareshu dhenáva*h*, 'The Nights and Dawns, Agni, have
lowed at thee as the milch-cows in their stalls at their calves;' comp.
Bergaigne, II, 15. Thus everything is clear, if we take the u*s*atî´*h*
and the svásâra*h* for the bright and dark goddesses, i. e. for the
Dawns and Nights. The correction of the text to which this
interpretation leads, is svásâra*h* *s*yâ´vî*h* árushî*h* a*g*ushran,
'the dark and the red sisters have delighted (in Agni).' It is easy to
understand that the corruption of the text was occasioned by the simile
of the fourth Pâda. The words ushásam ná *g*â´va*h* seemed to demand a
parallel nominative and a parallel accusative in the third Pâda. The
nominative was svásâra*h*, but there was no accusative. Thus probably
arose the reading *s*yâ´vîm árushîm.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:71:2:1">1</span>. On the Aṅgiras as the fathers of
the priestly tribes, see H. O., Religion des Veda, 278.

Note <span id="an_1:71:2:2">2</span>. The phrase ushása*h* ketú*h*
occurs several times in the Rig-veda. I think that ketúm usrâ´*h* means
exactly the same; it has been shown by Kaegi, Festgruss an Boehtlingk,
p. 49, and by Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XV, 185, that a
genitive sing. usrâ´*h* existed.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:71:3:1">1</span>. Ludwig refers asya to the
sacrificer, Bollensen to Agni, and so does Sâya*n*a. I believe that asya
should be explained as *ri*tásya; the phrase *ri*tásya dhîtí is
frequently used, comp. IV, 23, 8; IX, 76, 4; 97, 34; 111, 2. See also
Ludwig's note on III, 31, 1 (vol. v, p. 65).—Prof. Max Müller refers
*ri*ta to Agni. 'One might translate it by righteous: They established
the righteous (Agni), they moved his mind (made him attend?).'

Note <span id="an_1:71:3:2">2</span>. The substantive (of feminine
gender) which is to be supplied to didhishṽa*h*, át*ri*shyantî*h*, &c.,
seems to me to be gíra*h* or the like. Aryá*h* stands frequently
together with gíra*h*.—Prof. Max Müller writes: 'Could not ari be a
feminine like *k*arsha*n*i and vi*s*; see before, I, 70, I. We should
then translate, and then the people emulous, widely spread, never
flagging \[the stones also are called at*ri*shitâ*h*
at*ri*sh*n*a*g*a*h*, X, 94, 11\], and active go towards the gods.'

Note <span id="an_1:71:3:3">3</span>. See above, 70, 1, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:71:3:4">4</span>. Are the prayers called 'free from
thirst' because they are accompanied by libations of Gh*ri*ta, Soma,
&c.?

Note <span id="an_1:71:3:5">5</span>. I believe that devâ´n *g*ánma
depends both on á*kkh*â and on vardháyantî*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:71:3:6">6</span>. Devâ´n, or rather devâ´m, is gen.
plur.; see above, 70, 6, with note 1.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:71:4:1">1</span>. The place in which víbh*ri*ta*h*
stands would seen to show that it is an epithet of Mâtari*s*van, and so
it is understood by Ludwig and by Bergaigne (Rel. Véd. I, 54).

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But it is Agni
himself, not Mâtari*s*van, who is very frequently mentioned as
víbh*ri*ta or the like. As we read here, víbh*ri*ta*h* …
g*ri*hé-g*ri*he, it is said in V, II, 4. agním nára*h* ví bharante
g*ri*hé-g*ri*he, 'the men carry Agni hither and thither, to every
house;' comp. I, 70, 10; III, 55, 4; X, 1, 2; 45, 2; 80, 4. Thus I
believe the poet means to say that Mâtari*s*van first kindled Agni, in
one place of course, and that Agni then was brought to many places, to
all human dwellings. I think that the text indeed can be understood in
this way, if we suppose that the author, for the sake of the metre,
allowed himself a hyperbaton or synchysis.

We must not omit to mention that the first Pâda of I, 148, 1 is nearly
identical with our passage: máthît yát îm vish*t*á*h* mâtarí*s*vâ. This
Pâda is deficient by one syllable. If we were to read víbh*ri*ta*h*, as
in our passage, this would lead indeed to the conclusion that there is
no hyperbaton in our verse—for the verse, I, 148, 1, could not be
explained in that way—but that víbh*ri*ta*h* refers to Mâtari*s*van. I
think, however, that it is more than doubtful that the verse, I, 148, 1,
really ought to be corrected in this way; whatever may have been the
original form of that verse, it is quite possible, and even probable,
that it differed from our passage just in that one word.

Note <span id="an_1:71:4:2">2</span>. The exact meaning of
Bh*rí*gavâ*n*a is doubtful. It is, of course, derived from Bh*rí*gu as
vásavâna, tákavâna, from vásu, táku. Agni is called Bh*rí*gavâ*n*a also
in IV, 7, 4. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 54.

Note <span id="an_1:71:4:3">3</span>. With the words â´ dûtỹam vivâya
comp. IV, 9, 6. véshi ít u asya dûtỹam.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:71:5:1">1</span>. This difficult verse evidently
treats of the incest which the father Dyaus has committed with his
daughter. Compare on this subject Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. II, 109 seq. Agni
seems to be represented here as stimulating the desire of the father;
the 'sap' (rása) probably is the sperm, comp. I, 105, 2.

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

In the second Pâda, Agni, having done, as it seems, some mischief, goes
away to the speckled cows.' We cannot say who these speckled cows were;
they evidently are identical with those mentioned in another passage
treating of the same story, X, 61, S.—Bergaigne paraphrases the second
Pâda of our verse, wrongly in my opinion, 'Agni sort furtivement de
cette fille, de cette vache, p*ris*anî´.'

The archer who shoots at Agni (third Pâda) is not better known to us
than the speckled cows. Bergaigne's opinion, 'que cet archer n’est autre
que le père lui-même,' is not very convincing.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:71:6:1">1</span>. The traditional reading vibhâ´ti
('he who shines for thee in his house') gives no satisfactory sense. I
propose to read vidhâ´ti. Cf. I, 120, 1. kathâ´ vidhâti ápra*k*etâ*h*.

Note <span id="an_1:71:6:2">2</span>. I have some doubts as to the
correctness of u*s*atá*h* (Sa*m*hitâpâ*th*a, u*s*ató) ánu dyû´n. U*s*át,
of course, is an epithet not of the days, but of Agni. But then we
expect the dative. Correcting the text (u*s*até) is all the easier,
because before a following vowel the dative and the genitive were, in
the original pronunciation, identical (u*s*atá<sup><span
class="small">ऽ</span></sup>ánu; see my Prolegomena, 447 sqq.); the
spellings of the Sa*m*hitâpâ*th*a, u*s*ató ánu and u*s*até ánu, belong
to the inventions of Vedic grammarians.

Note <span id="an_1:71:6:3">3</span>. Literally, May he whom thou
incitest drive on the same chariot with riches. Comp. such expressions
as rathî´*h* râyá*h* and the like.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:71:7:1">1</span>. Comp. IV, 44, 2. yuvó*h* vápu*h*
abhí p*rí*ksha*h* sa*k*ante; VII, 90, 5.

Note <span id="an_1:71:7:2">2</span>. Comp. I, 26, 10, note 1.

Note <span id="an_1:71:7:3">3</span>. Ludwig: nicht unter unsern
freunden ward auszfündig gemacht die kraftspeise. Grassmann: nicht bei
Verwandten ward uns Nahrung sichtbar. Wilson: Our food is not partaken
of by our kinsmen. Griffith: Not by our brethren was our food
discovered.—Ludwig and Grassmann translate as if the text had *g*âmíshu.
What the

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

instrumental means is shown, I believe, for instance, by IV, 14, 2. ví
sû´rya*h* ra*s*míbhi*h* *k*ékitâna*h*, 'the sun shining with his rays.'
Thus in our passage the poet seems to me to say, 'We have no strong
kinsmen who might add lustre to our strength. Agni, procure thou
strength to us.' Comp. X, 23, 7. vidmá hí te prámatim deva *g*âmivát,
'for we know, O god, thy providing care like that of a kinsman.'—Prof.
Max Müller proposes the translation: 'Our wealth is not known by our
kinsmen, i. e. we cannot support them as we ought.'

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:71:8:1">1</span>. The poet returns here to the myth
of which he had spoken in verse 5. Should the order of the verses be
changed?—On our verse, compare Geldner, Ved. Studien, II, 34.

Note <span id="an_1:71:8:2">2</span>. Té*g*as seems to be here a synonym
of rétas, as in the later language.

Note <span id="an_1:71:8:3">3</span>. Is the lord of men Agni? See the
third Pâda.—Ishé I consider, with Geldner, as an infinitive.

Note <span id="an_1:71:8:4">4</span>. My translation rests on the
supposition that dyaû*h* is to he corrected into dyó*h*; thus the
ablative is obtained, of which the word abhî´ke is usually accompanied
(comp. Lanman, 433; Collitz, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, X, 15). If we
leave the reading dyaú*h*, this nominative will be the subject of the
verb â´na*t*. Then té*g*a*h* must be accusative dependent on â´na*t*,
and we can scarcely avoid making n*ri*pátim to depend on the infinitive
ishé. This is the way which Geldner has followed in interpreting this
passage. But I cannot consider this separation of n*ri*pátim from the
verb â´na*t* very probable.

Note <span id="an_1:71:8:5">5</span>. The exact meaning of *g*anayat
seems to be here, 'he caused them to be born.' Comp. *S*atapatha
Brâhma*n*a I, 7, 4, 4. yathâ tad devâ reta*h* prâ*g*anayan (comp.
Aitareya Brâhma*n*a III, 34; see also Rig-veda X, 61, 7).

Note <span id="an_1:71:8:6">6</span>. This may be the host of the seven
*Ri*shis. Comp. III, 31, 1–5; IV, 1, 12 seq. (?). Or the Maruts are
alluded to (comp. below, 72, 4), though that seems to me less probable.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:71:9:1">1</span>. Literally, in one day. But
sadyá*h* has already in the Rig-veda the secondary meaning 'immediately,
quickly.'

Note <span id="an_1:71:9:2">2</span>. Comp. III, 56, 7. râ´*g*ânâ
mitrâ´-váru*n*â supâ*n*î´.

Note <span id="an_1:71:9:3">3</span>. See below, 72, 6.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:71:10:1">1</span>. Comp. VII, 18, 2: there the words
abhí vidú*h* kaví*h* sán are identical with our text.

Note <span id="an_1:71:10:2">2</span>. Of the second hemistich Prof.
Collitz has treated in Bezzenberger's Beiträge, X, 15, note. He
paraphrases the meaning in the following way: 'Der Sinn des ganzen
Verses ist: unsere Freundschaft mit dir, Agni, stammt aus alter Zeit.
Nun sagt man zwar "im Alter ändert sich das Aussehn wie das der Wolke."
Aber stehe du uns bei vor diesem Fluche.' I do not believe that this
interpretation, though very ingenious, gives the real meaning of the
Vedic poet.—Comp. I, 179, I. minâ´ti *s*ríyam *g*arimâ´ tanû´nâm.
