<p>1. He has brought down (i.&nbsp;e. surpassed) the wisdom of many a worshipper&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:1:1">1</A>, he who holds in his hand all manly power. Agni has become the lord of treasures, he who brought together all (powers of) immortality.</p>  
<p>2&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:1">1</A>. All the clever immortals when seeking did not find the calf though sojourning round about us. The attentive (gods), wearying themselves, following his footsteps&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:2">2</A>, stood at the highest, beautiful&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:2:3">3</A> standing-place of Agni.</p>  
<p>3. When the bright ones&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:1">1</A> had done service&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:3:2">2</A> to thee, the bright one, Agni, with Gh<I>ri</I>ta through three autumns, they assumed worshipful names; the well-born shaped their own bodies.</p>  
<p>4. Acquiring (or, exploring?) for themselves the two great worlds, the worshipful ones brought forward their Rudra-like powers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:1">1</A>. The mortal, when (beings) were in discord&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:4:2">2</A>, perceived and found out Agni standing in the highest place.</p>  
<p>5. Being like-minded they&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:1">1</A> reverentially approached him on their knees. Together with their wives they venerated the venerable one&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:2">2</A>. Abandoning their bodies they made them their own&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:3">3</A>, the (one) friend waking when the (other) friend closed his eyes&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:5:4">4</A>.</p>  
<p>6. When the worshipful (gods) have discovered the thrice seven secret steps&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:1">1</A> (or, places) laid down in thee, they concordantly guard with them immortality.</p>  
<p><a name="page_83"><font size="1" color="green">p. 83</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Protect thou the cattle and that which remains steadfast&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:6:2">2</A> and that which moves.</p>  
<p>7. Knowing, O Agni, the established orders&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:1">1</A> of (human) dwellings, distribute in due order gifts&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:2">2</A> that they may live. Knowing the ways which the gods go&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:7:3">3</A>, thou hast become the unwearied messenger, the bearer of oblations.</p>  
<p>8. They who knew the right way and were filled with good intentions, beheld from heaven the seven young&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:1">1</A> (rivers) and the doors of riches. Saram&acirc; found the strong stable of the cows from which human clans receive their nourishment&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:8:2">2</A>.</p>  
<p>9. The Earth has spread herself far and wide with them who are great in their greatness, the mother Aditi, for the refreshment of the bird&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:1">1</A>, with her sons who have assumed all powers of their own dominion&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:9:2">2</A>, preparing (for themselves) the way to immortality.</p>  
<p>10. When the immortals created the two eyes of heaven&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:1">1</A>, they placed fair splendour in him (Agni)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:2">2</A>. Then they rush down&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:3">3</A> like streams let loose. The red ones have recognised, O Agni, those which are directed downwards&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46022.htm#an_1:72:10:4">4</A>.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;Verse 1 = TS. II, 2, 12, 1. Verse 3 = TB. II, 4, 5, 6. Verses 8&#8211;9 = TB. II, 5, 8, 10.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:1:1">1</A>. The meaning seems to me to be: by his wisdom he excels all human wisdom. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller translates: 'Agni, who holds in his hand all that men desire, conquers</p>  
<p><a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="green">p. 84</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (or, wins for himself) the praises of many a wise worshipper.' And the last P&acirc;da: 'he who brought together all immortal blessings.'&#8212;On <I>s</I>a<I>s</I>vat, see VI, 61, 1; VII, 18, 18; VIII, 23, 28.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:2:1">1</A>. Here we have again the myth of the hidden Agni whom the gods seek. Agni is meant by the calf.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:2:2">2</A>. Going on foot, S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:2:3">3</A>. I follow S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, Bollensen, and Ludwig in taking <I>k</I>&acirc;&acute;ru as a locative.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:3:1">1</A>. 'Was not S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a right in taking this verse as referring to the Maruts? Cf. VI, 48, 21.&#8230; su<I>g</I>&acirc;ta also is an epithet of the Maruts, I, 88, 3; 166, 12.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:3:2">2</A>. As to the subjunctive, comp. Delbr&uuml;ck, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, p. 67. The Taittir&icirc;ya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (II, 4, 5, 6) reads sapary&aacute;n.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:4:1">1</A>. I follow the Padap&acirc;<I>th</I>a which has rudr&iacute;y&acirc;. But possibly we may have the nom. plur. rudr&iacute;y&acirc;<I>h</I>: 'the worshipful Rudriyas (i.&nbsp;e. Maruts) rushed forward.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:4:2">2</A>. The translation of nem&aacute;dhit&acirc; is in jeopardy.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:5:1">1</A>. Probably the mortals, as Ludwig understands it. Comp. m&aacute;rta<I>h</I>, verse 4.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:5:2">2</A>. The venerable one is Agni.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:5:3">3</A>. Possibly the text is corrupt. In IV, 24, 3 we read ririkv&acirc;&acute;<I>m</I>sa<I>h</I> tanv&#771;a<I>h</I> k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>vata tr&acirc;&acute;m, 'abandoning (i.&nbsp;e. risking) their bodies they took him (Indra) for their protector' (comp. I, 100, 7). Should sv&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> have supplanted another word, for instance, tr&acirc;&acute;m? As the pronoun sv&aacute; very frequently stands in apposition with tan&ucirc;&acute;, it may have found its way also into passages to which it did not belong.</p>  
<p><a name="page_85"><font size="1" color="green">p. 85</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:5:4">4</A>. The meaning seems to be that whenever the attention of one of the friends relaxed, another friend watched instead of the first. See Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLIV, 328; Bartholomae, Studien zur indogerm. Sprachgeschichte, I, 95.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:6:1">1</A>. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains the tr&iacute;<I>h</I> sapt&aacute; pad&acirc;&acute; as the three times seven kinds of sacrifices, the seven P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as, the seven Havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as, the seven Somaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as. But this later system of the twenty-one forms of sacrifice can scarcely have existed at the time of the Rig-veda Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;. Three times seven is a favourite number in Rig-vedic mysticism; comp. I, 191, 12. 14; IV, 1, 16; VII, 87, 4; VIII, 46, 26; 69, 7; 96, 2; IX, 70, 1; 86, 21; X, 64, 8; 90, 15: Possibly three times seven pieces of wood (sam&iacute;dha<I>h</I>) are alluded to, comp. X, 90, 15, but everybody who has studied Bergaigne's Arithm&eacute;tique mythologique (Rel. V&eacute;d. II, 114 seq.; see especially p. 122) will admit that there are ever so many possible interpretations of a passage like this. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller's translation is: 'The worshipful gods found in thee the twenty-one words which are hidden in thee. They guard with them the immortal (Agni).'&#8212;Instead of avidan (Padap&acirc;<I>th</I>a) I think we must read &aacute;vidan.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:6:2">2</A>. Ludwig certainly is wrong in translating 'h&uuml;te du den wandel von tier and pflanze.' The author of this group of hymns is very fond of the phrase sth&acirc;t&uacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>ar&aacute;tham and the like; see I, 68, 1; 70, 3. 7. Tire same phrase, in one or the other of its possible shapes, has evidently been used by him here also. The plural masculine sth&acirc;t<I>r&icirc;&acute;</I><I>n</I> is indeed very strange. Possibly J. Wackernagel is right in reading sth&acirc;t<I>r&icirc;&acute;</I>n (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, 287; comp. Lanman, p. 422); the reading sth&acirc;t<I>r&icirc;&acute;</I><I>n</I> may be due to the neighbourhood of pa<I>s</I>&ucirc;&acute;n. This sort of blunder is very frequent in the text of the Rig-veda. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller suggests: the stabled cattle and what moves about (in the meadows).</p>  
<p><a name="page_86"><font size="1" color="green">p. 86</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:7:1">1</A>. On vay&uacute;na, comp. Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 295. 300. 'The thoughts of human beings.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:7:2">2</A>. <I>S</I>ur&uacute;dh: Pischel, Ved. Studien, I, 32. 50.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:7:3">3</A>. 'Which lead to the gods?' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:8:1">1</A>. Comp. I, 26, 10, note 1.&#8212;'Beheld the seven young rivers coming down from heaven.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:8:2">2</A>. See Delbr&uuml;ck, Syntaktische Forschungen, I, 87.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:9:1">1</A>. The bird seems to be Agni.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:9:2">2</A>. The Padap&acirc;<I>th</I>a gives su-apaty&acirc;&acute;ni. There is no doubt a word su-apaty&aacute;, 'blessed with good offspring.' This is frequently used together with such nouns as rayi, kshaya, ish; it stands in several passages by the side of pra<I>g</I>&acirc;vat. See I, 117, 19; II, 2, 12; 4, 8; 9, 5; III, 3, 7; 16, 1; IV, 2, 11; X, 30, 12. But from this word should be distinguished sva-paty&aacute;, derived from sv&aacute;-pati (X, 44, 1, &amp;c.), 'a man's own dominion,' or 'own rulership;' comp. <I>g</I>&acirc;spaty&aacute;. This word is found here, and in some other passages, for instance, VII, 91, 3. v&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc; &iacute;t n&aacute;ra<I>h</I> svapaty&acirc;&acute;ni <I>k</I>akru<I>h</I>, 'the heroes have exercised all the powers of their own dominion;' VIII, 15, 10. satr&acirc;&acute; v&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc; svapaty&acirc;&acute;ni dadhishe, 'thou hast assumed (Indra) all powers of thy own dominion altogether.'&#8212;Ludwig translates correctly, 'alle selbstherlichkeit.'</p>  
<p>The Taittir&icirc;ya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a reads <I>k</I>akr&uacute;<I>h</I> for tasth&uacute;<I>h</I>. This reading evidently rests on Rig-veda IV, 34, 9; VII, 91, 3. There is no reason, however, for preferring this to the traditional reading of our Rik-text.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:10:1">1</A>. The sun and the moon? This very natural explanation will scarcely be modified on account of passages like the following (<I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a I, 6, 3, 38):</p>  
<p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'These are the two eyes of the sacrifice, the (oblations of butter called) &Acirc;<I>g</I>yabh&acirc;gas.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:10:2">2</A>. Comp. below, 73, 4.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:10:3">3</A>. It is not necessary to change the text; I believe, however, that the conjecture adh&aacute;<I>h</I> ksharanti (they stream downwards) would not be quite improbable. Comp. my Prolegomena, p. 369, note 1.&#8212;The subject seems to be the streams of sacrificial libations.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:72:10:4">4</A>. Both expressions, 'the red ones' and 'those which are directed downwards,' are feminine. The red ones may be the dawns. But these cannot be called 'directed downwards.' I take, therefore, the one noun as a nominative, the other as an accusative. Cannot 'those which are directed downwards' be the libations of Gh<I>ri</I>ta and the like, which the dawns see?&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller translates: 'People recognised the red netherward mares (of thee), O Agni.' He supplies <I>g</I>v&acirc;l&acirc;<I>h</I> or takes arush&icirc;<I>h</I> as mares, cf. V, 56, 6.</p>
