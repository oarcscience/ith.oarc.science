### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 23.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 23.

1\. Produced by attrition, well preserved in his abode, the young sage,
the leader of worship, Agni ever young in the
forests [1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:1:1) that grow old—*G*âtavedas, has
here assumed immortality [2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:1:2).

2\. The two Bharatas [1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:2:1), Deva*s*ravas and
Devavâta, in the midst of wealth have produced by attrition Agni the
skilful (god). Agni, look forth with mighty wealth, and then
be [2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:2:2) for us a guide of food day by day.

3 [1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:1). The ten fingers have brought him to the
birth, the ancient, beloved (Agni), well born in his
mothers [2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:2). Praise, O Deva*s*ravas, the Agni
of Devavâta who [3](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:3:3) should be the lord of
people.

4\. I have laid [1](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:1)
thee [2](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:2) down in the best (place) of the
earth [3](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:3), in the place of
I*l*â [3](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:3), in the auspiciousness of days. O
Agni, as the god who has belonged to
Manus [4](sbe46083.htm#an_3:23:4:4), shine with wealth on the
D*ri*shadvatî, on the Âpayâ, on the Sarasvatî.

5 = III, 1, 23.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shis are Deva*s*ravas Bhârata and Devavâta Bhârata (see verse
2); the metre is Trish*t*ubh (verse 5 Satob*ri*hatî).—No verse occurs in
the other Sa*m*hitâs.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:23:1:1">1</span>. The 'forests' are the fuel. 'Does
the poet mean: Never consumed in the consumed wood or forests,

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

i. e. the fire burns and is kept alive while the wood is burnt up?'
M. M.

Note <span id="an_3:23:1:2">2</span>. Or, 'he has received the drink of
immortality'—which may refer to the ghee offered in the fire.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:23:2:1">1</span>. On the tribe of the Bharatas
having their seats, as verse 4 seems to show, on the borders of the
Sarasvatî and of the D*ri*shadvatî, see H. O., Buddha (first edition),
413 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:23:2:2">2</span>. This is an imperative in -tât,
signifying, as Delbrück has shown (Syntaktische Forschungen, III, 2
seq.; Altindische Syntax, 363), an injunction to be carried out after
something else has been done or has happened. Agni is first to look
about (ví pa*s*ya), and shall then become (bhavatât) a guide of food,
i. e. he shall lead plenty of food to the worshipper's house.—Prof. Max
Müller translates ishâ´m netâ´, 'a guide to food.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:23:3:1">1</span>. Should this Satob*ri*hatî,
standing alone among Trish*t*ubh verses, be considered as forming a
distich together with verse 2? Comp. H. O., Die Hymnen des Rigveda, vol.
i, p. 102, note 7.

Note <span id="an_3:23:3:2">2</span>. The woods.

Note <span id="an_3:23:3:3">3</span>. Agni, not Devavâta, is referred
to.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:23:4:1">1</span>. Or, 'he has laid.' The form may be
first or third person, present or perfect.

Note <span id="an_3:23:4:2">2</span>. Agni is addressed.

Note <span id="an_3:23:4:3">3</span>. The best place of the earth, the
place of I*l*â (i. e. of the nourishment coming from the cow, of the
ghee offered into Agni) is the sacrificial ground or more especially the
spot on which the sacrificial fire is established.

Note <span id="an_3:23:4:4">4</span>. Or 'to men.' The Padapâ*th*a has
mâ´nushe, but mâ´nusha*h* seems more probable.
