<p>1. Produce thy stream of flames like a broad onslaught. Go forth impetuous like a king with his elephant&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:1:1">1</A>; &#8230; &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:1:2">2</A> after thy greedy onslaught, thou art an archer; shoot the sorcerers with thy hottest (arrows).</p>  
<p>2. Thy whirls fly quickly. Fiercely flaming touch (them). O Agni, (send forth) with the ladle&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:2:1">1</A> thy heat, thy winged (flames); send forth unfettered thy firebrands all around.</p>  
<p>3. Being the quickest, send forth thy spies against (all evildoers). Be an undeceivable guardian of this clan. He who attacks us with evil spells, far or near, may no such (foe) defy thy track.</p>  
<p>4. Rise up, O Agni! Spread out against (all foes)! Burn down the foes, O (god) with the sharp weapon! When kindled, O Agni, burn down like dry brushwood, the man who exercises malice against us.</p>  
<p>5. Stand upright, strike (the foes) away from us! Make manifest thy divine (powers), O Agni! Unbend the strong (bows) of those who incite demons (against us)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:5:1">1</A>. Crush all enemies, be they relations or strangers.</p>  
<p>6. He knows thy favour, O youngest one, who makes a way for a sacred speech like this. Mayst thou beam forth to his doors all auspicious days and the wealth and the splendour of the niggard.</p>  
<p>7. Let him, O Agni, be fortunate and blessed with good rain, who longs to gladden thee with</p>  
<p><a name="page_332"><font size="1" color="green">p. 332</font></A></p>  
<p>constant offerings and hymns through his life in his house. May such longing ever bring auspicious days to him.</p>  
<p>8. I praise thy favour; it resounded here. May this song (which is like) a favourite wife, awaken for thee&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:8:1">1</A>. Let us brighten thee, being rich in horses and chariots. Mayst thou maintain our knightly power day by day.</p>  
<p>9. May (the worshipper) here frequently of his own accord approach thee, O (god) who shinest in darkness&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:9:1">1</A>, resplendent day by day. Let us worship thee sporting and joyous, surpassing the splendour of (other) people.</p>  
<p>10. Whoever, rich in horses and rich in gold, approaches thee, O Agni, with his chariot full of wealth&#8212;thou art the protector and the friend of him who always delights in showing thee hospitality.</p>  
<p>11. Through my kinship (with thee) I break down the great (foes) by my words&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:11:1">1</A>. That (kinship) has come down to me from my father Gotama. Be thou attentive to this our word, O youngest, highly wise Hot<I>ri</I>, as the friend of our house.</p>  
<p>12. May those guardians of thine, infallible Agni, sitting down together protect us, the never sleeping, onward-pressing, kind, unwearied ones, who keep off the wolf, who never tire.</p>  
<p>13&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:13:1">1</A>. Thy guardians, O Agni, who seeing have saved the blind son of Mamat&acirc; from distress&#8212;He the possessor of all wealth has saved them who have done good deeds. The impostors, though trying to deceive, could not deceive.</p>  
<p>14. In thy companionship we dwell, protected by thee. Under thy guidance let us acquire gain. Accomplish both praises&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46093.htm#an_4:4:14:1">1</A>, O (thou who art the)</p>  
<p><a name="page_333"><font size="1" color="green">p. 333</font></A></p>  
<p>truth! Do so by thy present power, O fearless one!</p>  
<p>15. May we worship thee, O Agni, with this log of wood. Accept the hymn of praise which we recite. Burn down those who curse us, the sorcerers. Protect us, O (god) who art great like Mitra, from guile, from revilement, and from disgrace.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The hymn is addressed to Agni Rakshohan. The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;Verses 1&#8211;15 = TS. I, 2, 14, 1&#8211;6; MS. IV, 11, 5. Verses 1&#8211;5 = VS. XIII, 9&#8211;13; MS. II, 7, 15.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:1:1">1</A>. On &iacute;bhena, cf. Pischel-Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, p. xv.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:1:2">2</A>. The meaning of dr&ucirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;n&aacute;<I>h</I>, which evidently should be pronounced dru<I>n</I>&acirc;n&aacute;<I>h</I> (H.&nbsp;O., Prolegomena, p. 478), is uncertain. This verb is stated to occur still in one other passage, Maitr. Sa<I>m</I>h. II, 4, 2. tad ya eva<I>m</I> vidv&acirc;nt sur&acirc;m pibati na haina<I>m</I> dr&ucirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;ti (dru<I>n</I>&acirc;ti, two MSS.). But should we not read there hru<I>n</I>&acirc;ti? [And possibly in our passage, as Prof. Max M&uuml;ller observes, hr&ucirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;n&aacute;<I>h</I>?]</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:2:1">1</A>. On <I>g</I>uhv&#771;&acirc;, see Pischel, Vedische Studien, II, 113. Wherever butter is poured out with the ladle, the flames arise.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:5:1">1</A>. The third P&acirc;da is identical with X, 116, 5 b.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:8:1">1</A>. Or 'resound to thee' (s&aacute;m <I>g</I>areta). Cf. above, 3, 15. Shall we read, in consideration of this parallel</p>  
<p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="green">p. 334</font></A></p>  
<p>passage, s&aacute;m dev&aacute;v&acirc;t&acirc; <I>g</I>arat&acirc;m iy&aacute;m g&icirc;&acute;h ('may this song beloved by the gods resound' or 'awaken')?</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:9:1">1</A>. On d&oacute;sh&acirc;vasta<I>h</I>, see above, I, 1, 7, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:11:1">1</A>. I have taken man&aacute;<I>h</I> as acc. plural. If it is gen. singular, the translation will be: 'Through my kinship with the great (Agni) I break down (my foes) by my words.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:13:1">1</A>. This verse is identical with I, 147, 3. See the notes there. The original place of this verse seems to be in the first Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala, because it mentions M&acirc;mateya.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 14.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:4:14:1">1</A>. Probably the praise or song of the gods and of men. See vol. xxxii, p. 439.</p>
