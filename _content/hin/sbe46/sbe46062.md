### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 2.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 8, VARGA 17–19.

#### TO AGNI VAI*S*VÂNARA.

1\. For Vai*s*vânara, the increaser of *Ri*ta, for Agni we
produce [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:1:1) a
Dhisha*n*â [2](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:1:2) like purified ghee. And
verily [3](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:1:3) by their prayer the invoking men
(accomplish) him, the Hot*ri*, as the axe accomplishes a chariot.

2\. By his birth he has given splendour to both worlds (Heaven and
Earth). He became the praiseworthy son of his parents, Agni, the carrier
of oblations, never ageing, with satisfied mind, undeceivable, the guest
of men, rich in light.

3\. Through the power of their mind, within the sphere of their superior
strength the gods have procreated Agni by their thoughts. Desirous of
winning the prize [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:3:1) I address Him who shines
with his splendour, who is great in his light, as (one who desires to
win the prize addresses his) race-horse.

4\. Desirous of winning the choice, glorious, and praiseworthy prize
(which is the gift) of the joy-giver, we choose the boon of the
Bh*ri*gus [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:4:1), the
U*s*i*g* [2](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:4:2), who has the mind of a sage, Agni,
who reigns with his heavenly light.

5\. Men, having spread the sacrificial grass, holding the sacrificial
ladle, have placed here in front (as Purohita), for the sake of (the
divine) blessing, Agni renowned for strength, with great splendour,
united with all the gods, the Rudra of
sacrifices [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:5:1), who accomplishes the oblations
of active (worshippers).

6\. O (Agni) whose flame is purifying, around thy

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

dwelling, O Hot*ri*, the men who at the sacrifices have spread the
sacrificial grass, O Agni, seeking (how to do) honour (to thee), and
(desiring) thy friendship, surround thee (reverentially);—bestow thou
wealth on them!

7\. He has filled the two worlds (Heaven and Earth) and the great Sun,
when the active ones (i. e. the priests) held him fast who had been
born. He the sage is led round for the performance of worship, like a
racer for the winning of the prize [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:7:1), with
satisfied mind.

8\. Adore ye him, the giver of offerings, the best performer of worship;
honour ye him the domestic *G*âtavedas. Agni, the charioteer of the
mighty *Ri*ta, he who dwells among manifold tribes, has become the
Purohita of the gods.

9\. The immortal U*s*i*g*s have purified three logs for the
vigorous [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:1) Agni [2](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:2)
who wanders round the earth [3](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:3): of these they
have placed one among the mortals for their enjoyment; two have passed
into the sister world [4](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:9:4).

10\. The food offered by men has sharpened him, the sage of the tribes,
the lord of the tribes, as an axe. Busily he goes to the heights and to
the depths. He has held fast the germ in these worlds.

11\. He the generator, the strong one, stirs in the resplendent bellies
like a roaring lion, Vai*s*vânara with his broad stream of light, the
immortal, distributing goods and treasures to his worshipper.

12\. Vai*s*vânara has mounted the firmament, the back of heaven, as of
old, glorified by those who are rich in good thoughts. He, creating
wealth for the creatures as of old, goes watchful round the common
course.

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

13\. The righteous, worshipful priest deserving of praise, the dweller
in heaven [1](sbe46062.htm#an_3:2:13:1) whom Mâtari*s*van has
established (on earth): him we approach whose way is bright and hair
golden, the resplendent Agni, for the sake of ever new welfare.

14\. Like the flaming one (the sun?) on his way, the quick one, of
sun-like aspect, the banner of heaven, who dwells in light, who wakes at
dawn—Agni the head of heaven, the unrepressed, him we approach with
adoration, the strong one mightily.

15\. The joy-giving, bright Hot*ri*, in whom is no falsehood, the
domestic, praiseworthy dweller among all tribes, like a splendid
chariot, wonderful to behold, established by Manus: him we constantly
approach for the sake of wealth.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is *G*agatî.—Verse 7 = VS. XXXIII, 75. Verse
9 = MS. I, 3, 35.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:2:1:1">1</span>. Literally, 'we generate.'

Note <span id="an_3:2:1:2">2</span>. On the meaning of this word, which
I may be allowed to leave in its Sanskrit form, I refer to I, 96, 1,
note 2.

Note <span id="an_3:2:1:3">3</span>. Literally, 'doubly.' Comp. below,
III, 17, 5, note 1.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:2:3:1">1</span>. Vâ´*g*a*m* sanishyán refers to the
worshipper who desires to obtain vâ´*g*a (quick strength, and the booty
or prize obtained by it), and in the comparison, to the owner of a
race-horse who desires to win the race.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:2:4:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 60, 1 (see above).

Note <span id="an_3:2:4:2">2</span>. Comp. Bergaigne, Religion Védique,
I, 57 seq.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:2:5:1">1</span>. Comp. von Bradke, Dyâus Asura, p.
54.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:2:7:1">1</span>. Again, as in verse 3, vâ´*g*asâtaye
means, with reference to the race, 'for the winning of the prize,' and
with reference to sacrifice, 'for the obtainment of quick strength, of
booty, &c.'

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:2:9:1">1</span>. See above, I, 36, 1, note 2.

Note <span id="an_3:2:9:2">2</span>. Agni is stated here to have one
terrestrial and two celestial forms: the fire belonging to men, and, it
seems, sun and lightning. Comp. M. M., Physical Religion, 229;
Bergaigne, Religion Védique, I, 22. With regard to the three forms of
Agni, compare also H. O., Religion des Veda, 106 seq.

Note <span id="an_3:2:9:3">3</span>. On pári*g*man, comp. above, I, 79,
3, note 2.

Note <span id="an_3:2:9:4">4</span>. Into the celestial world.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_3:2:13:1">1</span>. I read divikshayám (Bergaigne,
Rel. Védique, I, 55, note). The blunder has been caused by X, 63, 5.
dadhiré diví ksháyam.
