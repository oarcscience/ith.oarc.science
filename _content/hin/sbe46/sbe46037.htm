<p>1. He was born in Manu's firm law&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:1">1</A>, the Hot<I>ri</I>, the best sacrificer, according to the will of the U<I>s</I>i<I>g</I>s&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:2">2</A>, Agni, according to his own will. Always listening to him who wishes to be his friend, like a treasure to him who aspires to renown, the unbeguiled Hot<I>ri</I> sat down in the abode of food (on the altar); enveloped&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:1:3">3</A> (he sat down) in the abode of food.</p>  
<p>2. We render him attentive&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:2:1">1</A>, the promoter of sacrifice, on the path of <I>Ri</I>ta, by adoration with offerings, in the divine world, by (adoration) with offerings &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:2:2">2</A>. In bringing us vigour he never becomes worn out with this body of his: he whom M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van (has brought) to Manu from afar, the god whom he has brought from afar.</p>  
<p>3. In his (own) way he moves in one moment round the terrestrial (space), the sudden devourer (emitting) his sperm, the bellowing bull emitting his sperm, the bellower&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:3:1">1</A>, looking round with a hundred eyes, the god who quickly courses in the forests&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:3:2">2</A>, taking his seat on the lower ridges, Agni, and on the highest ridges.</p>  
<p>4. This highly wise Purohita, Agni watches sacrifice and service&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:1">1</A> house by house; by (the power of) his mind he is intent upon sacrifice. By (the power of) his mind helpful to him who desires food&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:2">2</A>, he looks on all creatures, since he has been born, the guest adorned with ghee, (since) the helpful carrier (of the gods)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:4:3">3</A> has been born.</p>  
<p><a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="green">p. 138</font></A></p>  
<p>5. When through his (Agni's) power the bounties grow in strength, with the roar of Agni&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:5:1">1</A> as with that of the Maruts&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:5:2">2</A>&#8212;like bounties offered to a vigorous man: then he by his greatness stirs up the gift of goods. May he protect us from misfortune and injury, from evil spell and injury.</p>  
<p>6. The far-reaching&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:1">1</A> steward&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:2">2</A> has taken all goods&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:3">3</A> in his right hand, and strongly advancing does not let them loose; desirous of glory he does not let them loose. For every supplicant&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:4">4</A> thou hast carried the oblations to the gods&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:6:5">5</A>. For every righteous one he procures a treasure; Agni opens both folds of the door (for him).</p>  
<p>7. He has been established as the most blissful one in the enclosures of men, Agni, at the sacrifices, like a noble lord of the clans, a beloved lord of the clans at the sacrifices: he rules over the oblations of men to which nourishing power has been imparted&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:7:1">1</A>. May he protect us from harm that comes from Varu<I>n</I>a, from harm&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:7:2">2</A> that comes from the great god.</p>  
<p>8. They magnify Agni the Hot<I>ri</I>, the dispenser of goods. They have roused the beloved, the most shining steward&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46037.htm#an_1:128:8:1">1</A> (of sacrifice); they have roused the carrier of oblations. The gods desirous of goods (have roused) him in whom all life dwells, who possesses all wealth, the Hot<I>ri</I>, the worshipful sage, the lovely one for the sake of bliss; with praises (they have roused), desirous of goods, the lovely one.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;Verse 6 = TB. II, 5, 4, 4.</p>  
<p><a name="page_139"><font size="1" color="green">p. 139</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:1:1">1</A>. As to dh&aacute;r&icirc;ma<I>n</I>i, comp. IX, 86, 4, where it is said that the streams of Soma flow forward, 'dh&aacute;r&icirc;ma<I>n</I>i;' Bergaigne, III, 219. 'Domain, precinct, sanctuary?' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:1:2">2</A>. The U<I>s</I>i<I>g</I>as (comp. above, I, 60, 2, note 1) are closely related to the Bh<I>ri</I>gus; they are considered as the first sacrificers, the first worshippers of Agni. See Bergaigne, I, 57 seq.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:1:3">3</A>. Enveloped in fuel and libations.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:2:1">1</A>. Comp. M.&nbsp;M.&#8217;s note, vol. xxxii, p. 437.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:2:2">2</A>. Comp. Lanman, pp. 516, 518.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:3:1">1</A>. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller translates the second and third P&acirc;das: 'again and again shouting, bellowing forth his sperm, yea, placing his sperm with bellowing.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:3:2">2</A>. Of course the fuel is alluded to.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:4:1">1</A>. Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;sya adhvar&aacute;sya, 'sacrifice and service;' comp. above, I, 1, 4, note 1.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:4:2">2</A>. The translation is doubtful. If the denominative ish&ucirc;y is derived from &iacute;shu, the meaning must be 'to fly like an arrow,' or possibly 'to shoot arrows.' But I do not think that the poet can have meant to say that Agni acts as a vedh&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> and looks on all creatures 'for him who flies like an arrow,' or 'for him who shoots arrows.' We should rather have to write ish&ucirc;yate without accent, so that the translation would be: 'By (the power of) his mind helpful (Agni) flies like an arrow; he looks on all creatures' (comp. VI, 3, 5, where it is said that Agni shoots arrows). But possibly ish&ucirc;y, which is found only here, may be a synonym of ishudhy, see verse 6. It may be a denominative from ish, influenced by the type of verbs like <I>ri</I><I>g</I>&ucirc;y, krat&ucirc;y,</p>  
<p><a name="page_140"><font size="1" color="green">p. 140</font></A></p>  
<p>vas&ucirc;y, &amp;c. Then the accent can be retained, and the translation would be as given in the text ('to him who desires food').</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:4:3">3</A>. On v&aacute;hni, comp. above, I, 127, 8, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:5:1">1</A>. The cerebral <I>n</I> in ave<I>n</I>a clearly points to the correction of the text agn&eacute;<I>h</I> r&aacute;ve<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:5:2">2</A>. The Maruts are called bho<I>g</I>&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, V, 53, 16 (stuh&iacute; bho<I>g</I>&acirc;&acute;n, 'praise the liberal ones'). Here we have the corresponding abstract noun.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:6:1">1</A>. V&iacute;h&acirc;yas (comp. Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, III, 287) seems to be formed like v&iacute;mahas, v&iacute;<I>k</I>etas, v&iacute;manas. The meaning then will be 'of extended h&acirc;yas.' The substantive h&acirc;yas, which is not found in the texts separately, may be derived from <I>g</I>&iacute;h&icirc;te or from hin&oacute;ti, and mean something like 'energy.' At all events it seems impossible to connect this adjective v&iacute;h&acirc;yas with the substantive vih&acirc;yas, 'the aerial space,' belonging to the classical language.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:6:2">2</A>. Comp. the remark above, I, 58, 7, note 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:6:3">3</A>. I propose to read v&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc; v&iacute;-h&acirc;y&acirc;<I>h</I> arat&iacute;<I>h</I> v&aacute;s&ucirc; dadhe h&aacute;ste d&aacute;kshi<I>n</I>e. Comp. IX, 18, 4. &acirc;&acute; y&aacute;<I>h</I> v&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc;ni v&acirc;&acute;ry&acirc; v&aacute;s&ucirc;ni h&aacute;stayo<I>h</I> dadh&eacute;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:6:4">4</A>. Comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 191.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:6:5">5</A>. Comp. VIII, 19, 1. devatr&acirc;&acute; havy&aacute;m &oacute;hire.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:7:1">1</A>. I<I>l</I>&acirc;&acute; k<I>ri</I>t&aacute; seems to be identical with &iacute;shk<I>ri</I>ta.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:7:2">2</A>. Regarding the metre, comp. Lanman, p. 383.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:128:8:1">1</A>. Comp. I, 58, 7, note 1.</p>
