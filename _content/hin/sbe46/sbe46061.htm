<p>1. Thou wilt have me, O Agni, as a strong (master) of Soma&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:1">1</A>: therefore thou hast made me the carrier (of the gods?) to perform worship at the sacrifice&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:2">2</A>. Sending my thoughts to the gods&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:3">3</A> I make the (press-) stone ready&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:4">4</A>; I toil, O Agni: find thou pleasure in thy own body&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:1:5">5</A>.</p>  
<p>2&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:1">1</A>. Eastward we have turned the sacrifice&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:2">2</A>; may the prayer increase. They honoured Agni with fuel and adoration. They have taught (him) the sacrificial ordinances of the sages of Heaven&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:2:3">3</A>. Though he (Agni) is clever and strong, they have sought a way for him.</p>  
<p>3. He has conceived freshness&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:1">1</A>, the wise one of pure&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:2">2</A> powers, he who is by his birth well allied with Heaven and Earth. The gods have found Agni the conspicuous one in the waters, in the work&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:3:3">3</A> of the sisters.</p>  
<p>4. The seven young (wives)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:4:1">1</A> made the blessed one grow who had been born white, ruddy in his growth. They ran up to him like mares&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:4:2">2</A> to a newborn foal. The gods wondered at Agni at his birth.</p>  
<p>5. Spreading with his bright limbs to the aerial space, purifying his power&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:5:1">1</A> by wise purifications, clothing himself in light, the life of the waters&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:5:2">2</A>, he creates mighty, perfect beauty.</p>  
<p>6. He has gone to (the waters) who do not eat, the undeceived ones, the young (daughters) of Heaven who are not clothed and (yet) are not naked.</p>  
<p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Here the former young (women) having the same origin, the seven sounds&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:6:1">1</A> have conceived one germ.</p>  
<p>7. His compact masses assuming every shape are spread in the womb of ghee, in the streaming of honey. There the swelling milch-cows have stationed themselves. Great are the parents of the wonderfully mighty (Agni) who are turned towards each other&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:7:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>8. Having been carried (in the waters) thou hast shone forth, O son of strength, assuming wonderful shapes brilliant and fierce. The streams of honey and ghee drip, where the male has grown by wisdom.</p>  
<p>9. By (his) nature he has found his father's udder&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:1">1</A>; he has sent forth his streams and his showers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:2">2</A>. Walking&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:3">3</A> hidden to his dear friends he has not been hidden to the young (daughters) of Heaven&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:9:4">4</A>.</p>  
<p>10. He bore (in his womb) the germ of the sire, of the father who begat him&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:1">1</A>. He, being one, sucked many (nurses) rich in milk&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:2">2</A>. Observe for this manly, bright one the two wives bound in kinship, belonging to men&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:10:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>11. The great one has grown up in the wide unbounded space&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:1">1</A>. The Waters (have made) Agni (grow): for many glorious ones&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:2">2</A> (have come) together&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:3">3</A>. He lay in the womb of <I>Ri</I>ta, the domestic (god) Agni, in the work&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:11:4">4</A> of the uterine sisters.</p>  
<p>12. Like a horse that carries (the prize), in the assembly of the great (waters)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:1">1</A>, visible to his son&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:2">2</A>, he whose &#8230; is light&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:3">3</A>: he who as father begat the ruddy cows&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:4">4</A>, he the son of the waters is the most manly, restless&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:12:5">5</A> Agni.</p>  
<p>13. To him, the glorious son of the waters and of the plants, the blessed wood&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:13:1">1</A> has given birth, in his many shapes. Even the gods, for they agreed in</p>  
<p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></A></p>  
<p>their mind, honoured him who had been born the most wonderful and strong.</p>  
<p>14. Mighty rays of light like brilliant lightnings, milking (the sap of) immortality in the boundless stable, accompanied Agni whose &#8230; is light&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:14:1">1</A>, who had grown up in his own house, as it were in secret.</p>  
<p>15. I magnify thee, worshipping thee with offerings; I magnify (thee) desirous of thy friendship, of thy favour. Together with the gods give help to him who praises thee, and protect us with thy domestic faces.</p>  
<p>16. As thy followers, O Agni, best leader, winning all precious (treasures), pressing onward with fertile glory, may we overcome the godless who seek to combat us.</p>  
<p>17. Thou hast been here as the banner of the gods, Agni, joy-giving, knowing all wisdom. As the domestic (god) thou hast harboured the mortals. As the charioteer thou goest along straightway after the gods.</p>  
<p>18. The immortal, the king, has sat down in the dwelling of the mortals, performing the sacrifices&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:18:1">1</A>. He the ghee-faced one has shone forth widely, Agni knowing all wisdom.</p>  
<p>19&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:19:1">1</A>. Come to us with thy gracious friendship, speeding, great, with thy great blessings. Bestow on us plentiful victorious wealth; make our share glorious and adorned with fine speech.</p>  
<p>20. These old births of thine, O Agni, and the recent ones I have told forth to thee the ancient one. These great libations (of Soma) have been prepared for the manly one; generation by generation <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas has been placed (on the altar).</p>  
<p>21. <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, placed (on the altar) generation</p>  
<p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></A></p>  
<p>after generation, is kindled by the Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitras, the indefatigable (or everlasting). May we dwell in the grace of him the worshipful, yea, in his blissful kindness.</p>  
<p>22. Bring thou, O strong one, this sacrifice of ours to the gods, O wise one, as a liberal giver. Bestow on us, O Hot<I>ri</I>, abundant food; Agni, obtain by sacrificing mighty wealth for us.</p>  
<p>23. Procure, O Agni, for ever, to him who implores thee, (the gift of) nourishment&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46061.htm#an_3:1:23:1">1</A>, the wonderful acquiring of the cow. May a son be ours, offspring that continues our race. Agni, may this favour of thine abide with us!</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The <I>Ri</I>shi is Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;mitra G&acirc;thina, the metre Trish<I>t</I>ubh.&#8212;Verse 1 = MS. IV, 11, 2. Verse 19 = MS. IV, 14, 15. Verse 23 = SV. I, 76; VS. XII, 51; TS. IV, 2, 4, 3; MS. II, 7, 11; IV, 11, 1; 12, 3.</p>  
<p>Comp. on this hymn Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 157 seq., and the article of Regnaud, &Eacute;tudes V&eacute;diques, l&#8217;hymne III, 1 du Rig-Veda.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:1:1">1</A>. V&aacute;kshi, which is very frequent as 2nd person of vah, occurs also as belonging to va<I>s</I> (see VII, 98, 2. p&icirc;t&iacute;m &iacute;t asya vakshi), and in this sense no doubt it is to be understood in our passage.&#8212;Ludwig and Geldner take tav&aacute;sam v&aacute;kshi agne as a parenthesis. G. translates: 'Du hast mich zu deinem Somaschenken&#8212;denn dich gel&uuml;stet nach dem starken, o Agni&#8212;bestellt, dass ich vor den Weisen opfern soll.' To me it seems more natural to understand the first P&acirc;da as one continual clause; v&aacute;kshi is accented on account of the logical dependence in which this clause</p>  
<p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></A></p>  
<p>stands, the clause being considered, even without a subordinating word, as a dependent one. See Delbr&uuml;ck, Altindische Syntax, p. 42; A. Mayr, Sitzungsberichte der phil. hist. Classe der Kais. Akademie der Wissenschaften, Vol. LXVIII (Vienna, 1871), 248, 259.&#8212;If we were to consider v&aacute;kshi as a locative infinitive (see Bartholomae's theory on such infinitives, Indogermanische Forschungen, II, 271 seqq.), the translation would be: 'Thou hast made me, O Agni, a strong carrier of Soma at the carrying (of the oblations),' &amp;c. I do not think, however, this interpretation of v&aacute;kshi very probable, nor is it, as far as I can see, favoured by any passage which contains the word.&#8212;For s&oacute;masya tav&aacute;sam, Prof. Max M&uuml;ller suggests the translation 'strong of Soma,' i.&nbsp;e. full of Soma.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:1:2">2</A>. The text has vid&aacute;the.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:1:3">3</A>. The traditional text has &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a d&icirc;&acute;dyat, which means, 'shining towards or as far as the gods.' The verb d&icirc; with a<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a occurs still in two other passages of this Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala, in 15, 5 and 55, 3. In the first of these passages the text seems to be correct: dev&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a d&icirc;&acute;dy&acirc;na<I>h</I>, 'shining as far as the gods.' In the second passage I believe that we ought to read &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a d&icirc;dhye p&ucirc;rvy&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i, 'I think of the ancient things,' or more exactly, 'I send my thoughts to the ancient things.' In the same way it seems to me very probable that in our verse d&icirc;&acute;dhyat would be the correct reading, for the participle refers to the priest who says of himself, 'I make the stone ready;' and this priest does not send his light (d&icirc;&acute;dyat) but his thoughts (d&icirc;&acute;dhyat) to the gods. Comp. I, 132, 5 = 139, 1. dev&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a n&aacute; dh&icirc;t&aacute;ya<I>h</I>; III, 4, 3, and numerous passages which represent the mati, the gira<I>h</I>, &amp;c., as going towards (&aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a) the gods, such as III, 39, 1; 42, 3; VII, 10, 3; 36, 9; X, 43, 1; 47, 6.&#8212;Prof. von Roth (Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Ges., XLVIII, 108) speaks of the 'h&auml;ufige Verwechslungen von Formen der beiden Wurzeln 2 d&icirc; scheinen und 1 dh&icirc; wahrnehmen, denken.' The reading d&icirc;&acute;dyat in our verse, and d&icirc;dye III, 55, 3, may rest on the influence of III, 15, 3. dev&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>&acirc; d&icirc;&acute;dy&acirc;na<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:1:4">4</A>. On the accent of yu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&eacute; the same may be said as above (note 1) regarding the accent of v&aacute;kshi.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:1:5">5</A>. I.&nbsp;e. cause the fire to flare up.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:2:1">1</A>. The verses 2, 3, and 4 have been translated by Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, I, 109.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:2:2">2</A>. Many sacrificial rites are performed from west to cast; comp. with regard to the Barhis, I, 188, 4; X, 110, 4; with regard to the sacrificial ladle, III, 6, 1; V, 28, 1; to the Havirdh&acirc;nas, V&acirc;<I>g</I>as. Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; V, 17. Thus the whole sacrifice is spoken of as proceeding in an eastward direction; see X, 66, 12. pr&acirc;&acute;<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>am na<I>h</I> ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m pr&aacute; nayata; X, 87, 9. ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m pr&acirc;&acute;<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>am &#8230; pr&aacute; naya.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:2:3">3</A>. Comp. Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata XIV, 280. tasm&acirc;t svaya<I>m</I> <I>s</I>&acirc;dhi ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>e vidh&acirc;&acute;nam. Vid&aacute;tha indeed is here an equivalent of vidh&acirc;na.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:3:1">1</A>. The meaning seems to be that Agni won vigour (m&aacute;ya<I>h</I>) by dwelling in the waters (see P&acirc;da 3); comp. the well-known words &acirc;&acute;pa<I>h</I> h&iacute; sth&aacute; maya<I>h</I>-bh&ucirc;va<I>h</I> (X, 9, I), 'for you, O waters, give vigour.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:3:2">2</A>. More exactly, of purified faculties.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:3:3">3</A>. The accent ap&aacute;si, instead of &aacute;pasi, looks very suspicious. It is easy, but perhaps too easy, to correct &aacute;pasi, as possibly in III, 6, 7. &aacute;pa<I>h</I> should be read for ap&aacute;<I>h</I>. (In I, 31, 8; 151, 4 Grassmann is wrong in assuming a neutral stem ap&aacute;s- 'die Arbeit.') To me Ludwig's conjecture up&aacute;si (in the lap of the sisters, i.&nbsp;e. of the waters) seems excellent. Up&aacute;si occurs in V, 43, 7; X, 27, 13 in the meaning of up&aacute;sthe. Thus up&aacute;si sv&aacute;s<I>r&icirc;</I><I>n</I>&acirc;m would be the same as ap&acirc;&acute;m up&aacute;sthe; comp. I, 144, 2; VI, 8, 4; IX, 86, 25; X, 45, 3; 46, 1. 2, &amp;c.&#8212;Comp. below, verse 11, note 4.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:4:1">1</A>. Of course the seven wives are the rivers or waters.</p>  
<p><a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:4:2">2</A>. I cannot adopt Prof. Weber's conjecture asv&#771;a<I>h</I> (Altiranische Sternnamen, 10). His translation is: 'Die G&ouml;tter liefen zu dem wundersamen Agni bei seiner Geburt (neugierig) hinzu, wie die jungen M&auml;dchen zu einem neugebornen Kinde.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:5:1">1</A>. For kr&aacute;tum pun&acirc;n&aacute;<I>h</I>, cf. III, 31, 16; VIII, 12, 11; 13, I; 53, 6.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:5:2">2</A>. I take p&aacute;ri as belonging to v&aacute;s&acirc;na<I>h</I>; <I>s</I>&oacute;<I>k</I>i<I>h</I> and &acirc;&acute;yu<I>h</I> are objects. Comp. X, 16, 5. &acirc;&acute;yu<I>h</I> v&aacute;s&acirc;na<I>h</I>; X, 53, 3. s&aacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute;yu<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; ag&acirc;&acute;t surabh&iacute;<I>h</I> v&aacute;s&acirc;na<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:6:1">1</A>. The number of the seven sounds (comp. Sten Konow, Das S&acirc;mavidh&acirc;na-br&acirc;&acute;hma<I>n</I>a, p. 33, note 3) seems to be connected with the seven <I>Ri</I>shis, see IX, 103, 3. v&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>&icirc;<I>h</I> <I>r&iacute;</I>sh&icirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;m sapt&aacute; (comp. IX, 62, 17). The seven sounds seem to be identified with the seven rivers also in III, 7, 1 (see below). Comp. Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, II, 132; H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 117, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:7:1">1</A>. Heaven and Earth.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:9:1">1</A>. Comp. Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, II, 99.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:9:2">2</A>. See volume xxxii, 441 seq. (I, 2, 3, note 1).</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:9:3">3</A>. Here I believe we have an anacoluthon. The poet seems to have intended to say, 'Him who walked &#8230; the daughters of Heaven saw.'&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller translates this hemistich: 'He found him (the father) moving along with dear friends, with the young maidens of Heaven&#8212;he was not hidden.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:9:4">4</A>. Agni was hidden to the gods but not to the waters.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:10:1">1</A>. The verse X, 3, 2, though very obscure, seems to contain a similar idea. Should the meaning be that</p>  
<p><a name="page_226"><font size="1" color="green">p. 226</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Agni bears in his womb the Dawn, the daughter of Heaven?</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:10:2">2</A>. The waters.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:10:3">3</A>. This phrase, which I have translated as literally as possible, is very obscure. The two wives seem to be wives of Agni. Are they Night and Dawn (the two sabard&uacute;ghe, III, 55, 12?), whose designation as 'belonging to men' seems not to be impossible? Or the two kindling-sticks (comp. V, 47, 5)? Or the two Darvis (V, 6, 9)?</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:11:1">1</A>. Comp. V, 42, 17. ura&uacute; dev&acirc;<I>h</I> anib&acirc;dh&eacute; sy&acirc;ma.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:11:2">2</A>. This is feminine.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:11:3">3</A>. The phrase ya<I>s</I>&aacute;sa<I>h</I> s&aacute;m h&iacute; p&ucirc;rv&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> occurs also X, 46, 10. It may have been, as Geldner believes, a proverbial locution. But the verb which it is most natural to supply, seems to be gam (i, y&acirc;), so that the meaning may have been: 'Many superior (wives) are wont to assemble,' i.&nbsp;e. where one such wife is, there will be many. This is applied here to the waters, in X, 46, 10 to such beings as &iacute;sha<I>h</I>, &ucirc;t&aacute;ya<I>h</I> or the like. That ya<I>s</I>&aacute;s may be meant for the waters is shown by VII, 36, 6, where the ya<I>s</I>&aacute;sa<I>h</I> v&acirc;va<I>s</I>&acirc;n&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, mentioned by the side of Sarasvat&icirc;, evidently are the waters.&#8212;It should be observed that several expressions of this hymn have been made use of by the author of X, 46.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:11:4">4</A>. Or rather 'in the lap' (up&aacute;si). Comp. above, verse 3, note 3.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 12.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:12:1">1</A>. With regard to akr&aacute;<I>h</I> I adopt the translation proposed by Geldner (Ved. Studien, I, 168).&#8212;On the accent of mah&icirc;&acute;n&acirc;m, see Lanman, p. 398.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:1:12:2">2</A>. This seems to be the human worshipper. I cannot follow Prof. von Roth, Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 118, who explains s&ucirc;n&aacute;ve as a corrupt third person of the verb su.</p>
