### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 25.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 17–18.

1\. Address thy song [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:1:1) for your sake to the
god Agni, for his help. He is our Vasu. May the son of the
dawns(?) [2](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:1:2) give us (wealth). May the
righteous one help us across our enemies.

2\. He is the true one, whom the men of old, whom the gods have kindled,
the Hot*ri* with the delightful tongue, rich in splendour with glorious
shine.

3\. As such, with thy widest thought and with thy best favour, shine
wealth on us, excellent Agni, for our beautiful
praises [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:3:1).

 

4\. Agni reigns among the gods, Agni among mortals, entering among them.
Agni is the carrier of our offerings. Serve ye Agni with prayers!

5\. Agni gives to the worshipper a son most mightily renowned, a knower
of mighty spells, most excellent, unconquered, who brings renown to his
lord [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:5:1).

6\. Agni gives a good lord who is victorious in battles with his men;
Agni (gives) a steed, swiftly running, victorious (in races),
unconquered.

 

7\. Sing mightily to Agni the (song) which may best bring him (to us), O
(god) rich in splendour [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:7:1)! From thee
(proceeds) wealth (mighty) like a
buffalo-cow [2](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:7:2); from thee proceed gains.

8\. Thy brilliant flames resound mightily like the pressing-stone (of
the Soma) [1](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:8:1). And thy roaring arose like
thunder by itself from heaven [2](sbe46129.htm#an_5:25:8:2).

9\. Thus we have paid homage, desirous of goods, to powerful Agni. May
he, the highly wise one, help us, as with a ship, across all enemies.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shis are the Vasûyava*h* Âtreyâ*h* (cf. verse 9); the metre is
Anush*t*ubh. Verse 5 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 6 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 7 =
SV. I, 86; VS. XXVI, 12; TS. I, 1, 14, 4. The Sûkta consists of hymns of
three verses each.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:25:1:1">1</span>. On gâsi, comp. Neisser,
Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XX, 70, note 1; Bartholomae, Indogermanische
Forschungen, II, 278, 283.

Note <span id="an_5:25:1:2">2</span>. *Ri*shû*n*â´m: comp. above, I,
127, 10, note 5.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:25:3:1">1</span>. On suv*ri*ktí, comp. above, II, 4,
1, note 1.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:25:5:1">1</span>. I. e. to his father? Or to his
patrons?

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_5:25:7:1">1</span>. This vocative very probably refers
to Agni.

Note <span id="an_5:25:7:2">2</span>. Or 'like a king's consort'? It may
be doubted whether the difference of accent (máhishî and mahishî´) holds
good for the Rig-veda.—Comp. on máhishîva, Roth, Zeitschr. der Deutschen
Morgenländ. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 680.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:25:8:1">1</span>. B*ri*hat is not the name of the
Sâman; cf. X, 64, 15 (100, 8). grâ´vâ yátra madhu-sút u*k*yáte b*ri*hát.
Comp. Hillebrandt, Vedische Mythologie, I, p. 153.—The singular u*k*yate
is explained by the connection with grâ´vâ.

Note <span id="an_5:25:8:2">2</span>. With the last Pâda comp. the
conclusion of V, 52, 6 (vol. xxxii, p. 312).
