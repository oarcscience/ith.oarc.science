<p>1. Stand upright for us, O Agni, Hot<I>ri</I> of the sacrifice, the best performer of sacrifices among the gods. For thou art the master of every thought; thou promotest the worshipper's prayer.</p>  
<p>2. The unerring Hot<I>ri</I> has sat down among the people, joy-giving Agni, the wise one at the sacrifices&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:2:1">1</A>. Like Savit<I>ri</I> he has sent his light upward. Like a builder he has reared his smoke up to the sky.</p>  
<p>3&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:1">1</A>. (The ladle) glowing, filled with gifts, with butter, is stretched forth. From left to right (does Agni move) choosing the divine people. Upright (stands) the (sacrificial) post like a new-born foal&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:2">2</A>; well-placed, well-established it anoints the victims&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:3:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>4. After the sacrificial grass has been spread and the fire kindled, the delighted Adhvaryu has stationed himself upright. Agni, the Hot<I>ri</I>, chosen from of old, goes round thrice, like a shepherd.</p>  
<p>5. As Hot<I>ri</I>, measuredly running, Agni, the joy-giving, sweet-tongued, the righteous, goes around by his own might. His flames run forward like race-horses; all beings are afraid when he has shone forth.</p>  
<p>6. Beautiful, O fair-faced Agni, is thy aspect, who art terrible and manifold; pleasant (it is). As they have not hindered thy light by darkness, no bespatterers have left stains on thy body.</p>  
<p>7. He whose mother (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:1">1</A> has not been hindered from giving birth, nor his father and mother whenever</p>  
<p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="green">p. 341</font></A></p>  
<p>they were incited (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:2">2</A>: this Agni, the purifier, well-established like Mitra&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:7:3">3</A>, has shone among the tribes of men,&#8212;</p>  
<p>8. Agni, whom the twice-five sisters&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:8:1">1</A>, dwelling together, have engendered among the human tribes, who awakes at dawn, who is bright like an elephant's (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:8:2">2</A> tooth, whose mouth is beautiful, who is sharp like an axe.</p>  
<p>9&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:9:1">1</A>. Agni, those golden horses of thine swimming in ghee, the red ones which go straight forward, the fleet ones, the brilliant, manly, wonderful horses, puissant stallions, have called hither the divine people.</p>  
<p>10. Those victorious, never-tiring&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:10:1">1</A>, fierce flames of thine, O Agni, which move about, hasten&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:10:2">2</A> to their goal like hawks; they roar mightily like the host of the Maruts.</p>  
<p>11&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:11:1">1</A>. (This) hymn has been produced for thee, O Agni, when thou wert kindled. May (the priest) recite the litany; mayst thou distribute (treasures) to him who sacrifices. Men have set down Agni as the Hot<I>ri</I>, the U<I>s</I>i<I>g</I>s, adoring (Him), the praise of &Acirc;yu&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46095.htm#an_4:6:11:2">2</A>.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;Verse 6 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:2:1">1</A>. The text has vid&aacute;theshu. Cf. above, I, 31, 6 note.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:3:1">1</A>. With the first hemistich compare above, III, 19, 2. See also VI, 63, 4.</p>  
<p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="green">p. 342</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:3:2">2</A>. On akr&aacute;, see Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 168.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:3:3">3</A>. The meaning seems to be that the sacrificial post, which has been anointed itself, imparts ointment to the victim tied to it.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:7:1">1</A>. The meaning of s&acirc;&acute;tu is uncertain. Boehtlingk-Roth give 'receptaculum.' Joh. Schmidt (Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV, p. 29, cf. H&uuml;bschmann, Indogerm. Vocalsystem, p. 75) translates 'Mutterleib,' and connects the word with str&icirc;&acute;. If 'womb' is right, it seems to be the womb from which Agni was born.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:7:2">2</A>. Does this ish<I>t</I>&aacute;u belong to ish, 'to incite,' or to ish, 'to wish'? 'Whenever he (Agni) wishes.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:7:3">3</A>. On the well-established Mitra, comp. H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, p. 186, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:8:1">1</A>. The ten sisters of course are the fingers.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:8:2">2</A>. In translating athary&#771;a<I>h</I> n&aacute; d&aacute;ntam I have followed the opinion of Pischel (Vedische Studien, I, 99) on the meaning of athar&icirc;&acute; though his theory is very doubtful.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:9:1">1</A>. With this description of Agni's horses, comp. above, IV, 2, 2. 3.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:10:1">1</A>. On ay&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I>, cf. above, III, 18, 2, note 1.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:10:2">2</A>. See Geldner, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 234.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:11:1">1</A>. The second hemistich of this verse is nearly identical with V, 3, 4.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:6:11:2">2</A>. Cf. n&aacute;r&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa, vol. xxxii, p. 439.</p>
