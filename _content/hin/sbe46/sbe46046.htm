<p>1. When M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van &#8230;&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:1">1</A> had produced by attrition the Hot<I>ri</I>, the &#8230;&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:1:2">2</A> who belongs to all gods, whom they have established among the human clans, shining like the sun, resplendent that (he might show his beautiful) shape&#8212;</p>  
<p>2. They did not deceive him&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:1">1</A> who had granted a hymn (to the worshipper). Agni is my protection; therewith he is satisfied. They took pleasure in all his&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:2:2">2</A> works&#8212;(in the works) of the singer who brought praise.</p>  
<p>3. Whom the worshipful (gods)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:1">1</A> took and placed in his own seat (as priest) with their praises: him they&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:3:2">2</A> have carried forward, taking hold of him in their search, hastening like horses that draw a chariot.</p>  
<p>4. The marvellous one destroys many things with his jaws. Then&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:4:1">1</A> the resplendent one shines in the forest. Then the wind blows after his flame day by day as after the arrow of an archer, after a weapon that has been shot.</p>  
<p>5. Him whom no impostors, no harmful foes&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:1">1</A>, no harm-doers may harm when he dwells in (his mother's) womb, him the blind ones bereft of sight did not damage by looking at him&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46046.htm#an_1:148:5:2">2</A>. His own friends have protected him.</p>  
<p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;Verse 1 = MS. IV, 14, 15.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:1:1">1</A>. The first P&acirc;da is identical with the first P&acirc;da of I, 71, 4 (see our note there) with the exception of the word vish<I>t</I>&aacute;<I>h</I>, instead of which that parallel passage has the reading v&iacute;-bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I>. It seems impossible to explain vish<I>t</I>&aacute;<I>h</I>, and the concurrence of the metrical irregularity in the same part of the P&acirc;da&#8212;though metrical irregularities are not infrequent in this hymn&#8212;invites to a correction of the text. If v&iacute;-bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I> in I, 71, 4 (see note there) refers to M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, which I consider as doubtful, it would be easy to find for our passage an equivalent of that word little differing from the traditional vish<I>t</I>&aacute;<I>h</I>, namely, v&iacute;sthita<I>h</I>: 'when M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, standing in different places, had produced him by attrition.' Of course whoever adopts a conjecture like this, can scarcely avoid understanding v&iacute;-bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I> in I, 71, 4 as an epithet of M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, not of Agni. Another way to correct our passage would be to put into the text a form derived from the root vish, 'to accomplish a work,' for instance, vish<I>t</I>y&acirc;&acute; (to be read as trisyllabic): 'when M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van by his effort,' &amp;c. Grassmann's v&iacute;-sita<I>h</I> is quite improbable.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:1:2">2</A>. Vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;-apsum (Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text, vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;&acute;psum), evidently an epithet of Agni the Hot<I>ri</I>, seems corrupt. Shall we read vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;-psum ('endowed with all food')&#8212;comp. VIII, 22, 12. h&aacute;vam vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;psum vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;v&acirc;ryam&#8212;or vi<I>s</I>va-p&uacute;sham (Sa<I>m</I>h., vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;p&uacute;sham, 'all-nourishing') or vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;-apasam ('doing all works')? Also vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;-psnyam may be thought of. It is impossible, of course, to arrive at any certain conclusion.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:2:1">1</A>. 'He' seems to be Agni. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, however, explains: dad&acirc;nam id agnaye kurv&acirc;<I>n</I>am eva m&acirc;m. This would lead to a translation like this: '(The enemies) did</p>  
<p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A></p>  
<p>not deceive (me, the worshipper) who had addressed a hymn (to Agni).'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:2:2">2</A>. On 'his' S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a remarks, 'ya<I>g</I>am&acirc;nasya mama.' But the word may refer to Agni.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:3:1">1</A>. There is no reason for abandoning here the usual meaning of ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&iacute;ya. On the gods seeking after Agni, comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:3:2">2</A>. It is very probable, to say the least, that 'they' are again the gods.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:4:1">1</A>. Is the first &acirc;&acute;t dissyllabic? More probably the P&acirc;da is deficient by one syllable.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:5:1">1</A>. Two syllables are wanting before the caesura of the first P&acirc;da.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:148:5:2">2</A>. Was there a belief that a blind man by turning his blind eyes on somebody could do him harm? Possibly we might have to translate: 'Him (his foes) blind and bereft of sight did not damage though looking at him (i.&nbsp;e. though turning their blind eyes on him).'&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller writes: 'Could it be: Even the blind saw, but did not injure him (andh&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> apa<I>s</I>yan n&aacute; dabhan); abhikhy&acirc;&acute;, when he was seen, no longer in the womb?'</p>
