<p>1. Thee, O Agni, the gods concordantly have ever set to work as their divine steward; with this intention&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:1">1</A> they have set thee to work. They have generated&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:2">2</A> thee, O worshipful one&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:2">2</A>, the immortal among the mortals, the wise, god-loving god; they have generated every wise, god-loving (Agni)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>2. Do thou, [O Agni&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:1">1</A>,] turn to brother Varu<I>n</I>a, towards the gods&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:2">2</A> with thy kindness&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:3">3</A>, to (Varu<I>n</I>a) who accepts the sacrifice, to the eldest (god) who accepts the sacrifice, the righteous &Acirc;ditya who supports the (human) tribes, the king who supports the (human) tribes.</p>  
<p>3. O friend, turn to thy friend (Varu<I>n</I>a), as a wheel of a chariot&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:3:1">1</A> rapidly (follows) the swift (horse), for our sake, O wonderful one, rapidly. O Agni, find mercy (for us) with Varu<I>n</I>a, with the all-brilliant Maruts. Bless (us), O flaming one, that we may propagate ourselves, that we may press onward; bless us, O wonderful one!</p>  
<p>4. Mayst thou, O Agni, who knowest Varu<I>n</I>a, deprecate for us the god's anger. Being the best sacrificer, the best carrier (of the gods), flaming, remove from us all hatred.</p>  
<p>5. As such, O Agni, be for us the lowest &nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:5:1">1</A> (god) with thy help, our nearest (friend) while this dawn shines forth. Being liberal (towards us), cause, by sacrificing, Varu<I>n</I>a to go away from us. Love mercy; readily hear our call.</p>  
<p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></A></p>  
<p>6. His, the fortunate god's, appearance is excellent, and most brilliant among mortals. Like the bright, heated butter of the cow (the appearance) of the god is lovely, like the bountifulness of a milch-cow.</p>  
<p>7. Three&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:7:1">1</A> are those highest, true, and lovely births of this god Agni. Being enveloped in the infinite&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:7:2">2</A> he has come hither, the bright, brilliant, shining Aryan.</p>  
<p>8. He, the messenger, longs for all seats, the Hot<I>ri</I> with the golden chariot, with the lovely tongue, with the red horses, of marvellous appearance, brilliant, always lovely like an assembly abundant in food.</p>  
<p>9. He, the kinsman of sacrifice, has enlightened men&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:9:1">1</A>. They lead him forward by a great rope&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:9:2">2</A>. He dwells in his (the mortal's) dwelling, accomplishing (his task). The god has obtained the companionship of the mortal.</p>  
<p>10. May this Agni, the knowing one, lead us to the god-given treasure which belongs to him&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:10:1">1</A>. That (treasure) which all the immortals have created by their thought, which Dyaus, the father, the begetter (has created): that real (treasure) they have besprinkled&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:10:2">2</A>.</p>  
<p>11. He has been born in the dwellings as the first, at the bottom of the great (air)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:1">1</A>, in the womb of this air&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:2">2</A>, footless, headless, hiding both his ends, drawing towards himself (his limbs?), in the nest of the bull&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>12. The host&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:1">1</A> came forth wonderfully at first, in the womb of <I>Ri</I>ta, in the nest of the bull&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:2">2</A>, lovely and young, of marvellous appearance, and brilliant&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:3">3</A>. Seven friends&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:4">4</A> were born for the bull.</p>  
<p>13. Here our human fathers have sat down&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:1">1</A>,</p>  
<p><a name="page_309"><font size="1" color="green">p. 309</font></A></p>  
<p>aspiring after <I>Ri</I>ta&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:2">2</A>. Invoking the dawns&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:3">3</A>, they have driven out the milch-cows which dwelt in the rock-stable, in the prison.</p>  
<p>14. Having rent the rock they cleaned themselves. Others around told forth that (deed) of theirs. Taking &#8230; as an instrument (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:14:1">1</A>, they sang triumphantly&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:14:2">2</A>. They found the light; they chanted their prayers.</p>  
<p>15. Longing for the cows in their mind, those men, the U<I>s</I>i<I>g</I>s&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:15:1">1</A>, have opened with godly words the fast-holding, closed rock, which enclosed and encompassed the cows, the firm stable full of cows.</p>  
<p>16. They have devised the first name of the milch-cow; they have found the three times seven highest (names or essences) of the mother&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:1">1</A>. The hosts&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:2">2</A>, understanding this, acclaimed. The red one&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:3">3</A> became visible through the brilliant (milk?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:4">4</A> of the cow.</p>  
<p>17. The confused&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:17:1">1</A> darkness disappeared; the sky appeared in splendour; the shine of the goddess Dawn rose up. The Sun ascended to the wide plains, beholding right and wrong deeds among the mortals.</p>  
<p>18. Then, afterwards, being awoke they looked around; then they took that treasure given by Heaven, all the gods in all the houses. O Mitra, may true (fulfilment) belong to (our) prayer, O Varu<I>n</I>a!</p>  
<p>19. I will address flaming Agni, the Hot<I>ri</I>, the supporter of everything&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:19:1">1</A>, the best sacrificer. He has perforated, as it were, the pure udder of the cows, (and has made flow the milk) purified like the poured sap of the Soma shoots.</p>  
<p>20. He, the Aditi (i.&nbsp;e. the freedom) of all the</p>  
<p><a name="page_310"><font size="1" color="green">p. 310</font></A></p>  
<p>worshipful gods, the guest&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:20:1">1</A> of all men, Agni, choosing (for us) the protection of all gods&#8212;may he, <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, be merciful.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The <I>Ri</I>shi is V&acirc;madeva, the metre Trish<I>t</I>ubh, except in verses 1&#8211;3, the metres of which are Ash<I>t</I>i, Ati<I>g</I>agat&icirc;, and Dh<I>ri</I>ti respectively.&#8212;Verses 4&#8211;5 = VS. XXI, 3&#8211;4; TS. II, 5, 12, 3; IV, 2, 11, 3; TB. III, 7, 11, 3; 12, 6; T&Acirc;. II, 4, 4; IV, 20, 3; MS. IV, 10, 4; 14, 17. Verse 20 = VS. XXXIII, 16; TB. II, 7, 12, 5.&#8212;The hymn has been translated and commented upon by Bergaigne, Quarante Hymnes du Rig-v&eacute;da, p. 11 seq.</p>  
<p>This S&ucirc;kta seems to be composed of two independent hymns. Grassmann believed that the first three verses are the fragment of one hymn, and that verses 4&#8211;20 form a second hymn. His reason was that verses 1&#8211;3 are composed in metres similar to Atyash<I>t</I>i, while the rest are composed in Trish<I>t</I>ubh. I think that he was on the right way, but his opinion should be slightly modified. In verses 1&#8211;5 Agni is invoked to appease the anger of Varu<I>n</I>a; while, on the other hand, no allusion to Varu<I>n</I>a occurs in verses 6&#8211;20. I believe, therefore, that the first hymn should be considered as consisting of verses 1&#8211;5; it is composed in the metres of the Atyash<I>t</I>i class (1&#8211;3) with two concluding Trish<I>t</I>ubh verses (4, 5). The second hymn comprises the verses 6&#8211;20. The arrangers of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, however, considered these two hymns as one, as is shown by the position which they have assigned to it, before the second S&ucirc;kta, which has the same number of verses (20) as this first S&ucirc;kta. Comp. my Prolegomena, p. 141.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:1:1">1</A>. I.&nbsp;e. with the intention that he should act as the steward of the gods. As to &iacute;ti kr&aacute;tv&acirc;, comp. I, 138, 3. &iacute;ti</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:1:2">2</A>. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, whom Ludwig follows, seems to be right in explaining ya<I>g</I>ata as a vocative ('ya<I>g</I>an&icirc;ya'), and <I>g</I>anata as 3rd plural ('a<I>g</I>anayan'). Bergaigne takes both forms as 2nd plural imperative: 'honorez l&#8217;immortel chez les mortels; engendrez le Dieu qui honore les Dieux.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:1:3">3</A>. I cannot believe that Bergaigne is right in translating v&iacute;<I>s</I>vam &acirc;&acute;devam, 'celui qui honore tous les Dieux.' His theory is that v&iacute;<I>s</I>vam d&eacute;pend &#8230; de &acirc;&acute;, qui logiquement gouverne le terme dev&aacute; &agrave; l&#8217;accusatif.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:2:1">1</A>. The metre shows, as Benfey (Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 19, note 1) has pointed out, that this vocative agne is a spurious addition.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:2:2">2</A>. Should we not read dev&aacute;m? 'Turn to brother Varu<I>n</I>a with thy kindness, towards the god who accepts the sacrifice.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:2:3">3</A>. Or 'for the sake of his kindness,' 'for winning his favour (for the mortals)'? Sumat&icirc;&acute; may be dative; see Lanman, p. 382; Brugmann, Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik, II, p. 602. Comp. I, 186, 10. &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>&acirc; sumn&acirc;&acute;ya vav<I>ri</I>t&icirc;ya dev&acirc;&acute;n, 'may I turn to the gods for the sake of their favour.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:3:1">1</A>. I believe that r&aacute;thyeva (Padap&acirc;<I>th</I>a r&aacute;thy&acirc;-iva) stands for r&aacute;thyam-iva. Comp. Lanman, p. 331; Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;ndischen Gesellschaft, XLVIII, p. 681 seq. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller refers r&aacute;thy&acirc;-iva to two horses; he translates: 'O friend, bring hither thy friend, as two swift chariot-horses bring rapidly a swift wheel.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:5:1">1</A>. I.&nbsp;e. the nearest to men.</p>  
<p><a name="page_312"><font size="1" color="green">p. 312</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:7:1">1</A>. Literally 'thrice.' But I think that we should correct tr&icirc;&acute; ('three'). The same blunder seems to occur in III, 56, 5. tr&icirc;&acute; sadh&aacute;sth&acirc; sindhava<I>h</I> tr&iacute;<I>h</I> (read tr&icirc;&acute;) kav&icirc;n&acirc;&acute;m, 'Three are your abodes. O rivers; three (are those) of the sages.' Comp. also III, 56, 8; I, 116, 4.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:7:2">2</A>. This seems to mean, in the infinite sky.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:9:1">1</A>. M&aacute;nusha<I>h</I> seems to be acc. plur.; comp. VII, 86, 7. &aacute;<I>k</I>etayat a<I>k</I>&iacute;ta<I>h</I>, 'he has enlightened the unenlightened ones.' Bergaigne takes m&aacute;nusha<I>h</I> as a genitive depending on ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;bandhu<I>h</I>, 'fils du sacrifice de Manus.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:9:2">2</A>. Bergaigne compares IX, 87, 1, where it is said that they lead Soma to the sacrificial grass like a horse by ropes (&aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>&acirc; barh&iacute;<I>h</I> ra<I>s</I>an&acirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I> nayanti).

<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:10:1">1</A>. Comp. below, verse 18.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:10:2">2</A>. I.&nbsp;e. anointed, adorned. 'Poured down.' M.&nbsp;M.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:11:1">1</A>. Mah&aacute;<I>h</I> budhn&eacute; seems to mean, mah&aacute;<I>h</I> r&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I> budhn&eacute;; comp. r&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I> budhn&aacute;m, I, 52, 6; budhn&eacute; r&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I>, II, 2, 3; mah&aacute;<I>h</I> r&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I>, I, 6, 10; r&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I> mah&aacute;<I>h</I>, I, 168, 6; mah&icirc;&acute; r&aacute;<I>g</I>as&icirc;, IX, 68, 3.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:11:2">2</A>. With the second P&acirc;da, compare IV, 17, 14. tva<I>k</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> budhn&eacute; r&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I> asya y&oacute;nau.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:11:3">3</A>. The bull seems to be Agni himself. Comp. verse 12.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 12.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:12:1">1</A>. The word <I>s</I>&aacute;rdha (or <I>s</I>&aacute;rdha<I>h</I>? see note 3), which in most passages is applied to the host of the Maruts (see vol. xxxii, p. 67 seq.), seems here to refer to the company of the A&#7749;giras or seven <I>Ri</I>shis, alluded to in the fourth</p>  
<p><a name="page_313"><font size="1" color="green">p. 313</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> P&acirc;da. The seven <I>Ri</I>shis, 'our fathers' (verse 13), have, with the aid of Agni, rent the mountain and delivered the cows or dawns (verses 13 seqq.; IV, 2, 15 seq.). Comp. H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, p. 145 seq.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:12:2">2</A>. The bull again seems to be Agni. Comp. verse 11, note 3.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:12:3">3</A>. Do these epithets (comp. verse 8, P&acirc;da 3) refer to the s&aacute;rdha (host)? Or are they applied to Agni, so that we would have to translate: 'Lovely was the young one (Agni), of marvellous appearance, and brilliant'? In this way Bergaigne interprets the passage. If this translation is right, <I>s</I>&aacute;rdha<I>h</I> may be considered as neuter, and the first P&acirc;da could be translated: The first host came forth wonderfully.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:12:4">4</A>. Evidently the seven <I>Ri</I>shis (see note 1). Bergaigne: Les sept pri&egrave;res? ou les sept rivi&egrave;res?</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:13:1">1</A>. The seven <I>Ri</I>shis sat down for chanting and sacrificing, by which they have opened the mountain-prison of the cows.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:13:2">2</A>. The mention of <I>Ri</I>ta in this connection is both Vedic and Avestic. Comp. Darmesteter, Ormazd et Ahriman, p. 146; H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, p. 144, note 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:13:3">3</A>. The cows in this myth seem to be a mythical representation of the dawns. Comp. M.&nbsp;M., Science of Language, II, p. 584; H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, pp. 147, 149 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 14.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:14:1">1</A>. Pa<I>s</I>v&aacute;yantra (comp. <I>s</I>l&oacute;kayantra, IX, 73, 6) is quite doubtful. Does there exist a stem pa<I>s</I>va, meaning possibly, 'the herd of cattle'? And can we translate, they who had their (battering-?) machines directed on the cow-herds'? Or, 'holding the herds with their instruments (i.&nbsp;e. with the ropes used for drawing the cows out of the cavern)'?&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller suggests the translation, 'the cattle-drivers,' and writes, 'Does it stand for pa<I>s</I>u-yantr&acirc;sa<I>h</I>?</p>  
<p><a name="page_314"><font size="1" color="green">p. 314</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Yantra seems the same as yoktra, or something like it, cf. X, 94, 7, 8. Pa<I>s</I>uyantra would be they who hold the ropes of the cattle, who drive them away.' Bergaigne's translation, 'n&#8217;ayant rien (d&#8217;autre) pour conduire le b&eacute;tail' (pa<I>s</I>u-ayantra), and that of Roth ('die der Sperre ledigen Thiere [pa<I>s</I>va<I>h</I> ayantr&acirc;sa<I>h</I>] erhoben ein Freudengeschrei,' Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 678), do not carry conviction, nor does a conjecture like pa<I>s</I>v&acirc;&acute; yant&acirc;&acute;ra<I>h</I> ('the leaders of the cattle together with the cattle itself shouted triumphantly'), seem to furnish a satisfying solution of the difficulty.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:14:2">2</A>. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, 120.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 15.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:15:1">1</A>. On the U<I>s</I>i<I>g</I>s, compare Bergaigne's Religion V&eacute;dique, I, 57 seq.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 16.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:16:1">1</A>. The mother seems again to be the cow, or more exactly the Dawn considered as the mother of the cows (m&acirc;t&acirc;&acute; g&aacute;v&acirc;m, IV, 52, 2. 3; VII, 77, 2), and as the mother of the <I>Ri</I>shis (IV, 2, 15). Comp. V, 45, 2. &acirc;&acute; &ucirc;rv&acirc;&acute;t g&aacute;v&acirc;m m&acirc;t&acirc;&acute; <I>g</I>&acirc;nat&icirc;&acute; gat. The seven names of the cow are mentioned also in I, 164, 3, its three times seven names, in VII, 87, 4.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:16:2">2</A>. Bergaigne (Quarante Hymnes, p. 14) and Pischel (Ved. Studien, II, 121 seq.) give to the word vr&acirc; the meaning 'woman' (Bergaigne: 'femme,' particuli&egrave;rement 'femme en rut,' 'femme amoureuse'). I prefer to follow the opinion of Bechtel, Nachrichten der G&ouml;ttinger Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, philolog.-historische Klasse, 1894, p. 393 seq. The hosts seem to be the assembly of the <I>Ri</I>shis.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:16:3">3</A>. The dawn.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:1:16:4">4</A>. Comp. IX, 81, 1 (H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, p. 147, note 1). dadhn&acirc;&acute; y&aacute;t &icirc;m &uacute;nn&icirc;t&acirc;<I>h</I> ya<I>s</I>&aacute;s&acirc; g&aacute;v&acirc;m, 'When (the Somas) have been drawn, together with the brilliant curds of the cow.'
