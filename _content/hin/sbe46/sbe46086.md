### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 26.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 26–27.

1\. With our offerings revering in our mind Agni Vai*s*vânara, the
follower of truth, the finder of the sun—we, the
Ku*s*ikas [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:1:1), desirous of goods, call with
our prayers the god who gives rain, the charioteer, the, cheerful.

2\. We call that beautiful Agni to help us, Vai*s*vânara, Mâtari*s*van
the praiseworthy [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:2:1); we the men (call)
B*ri*haspati [2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:2:2) for (the worship) of the
divine host, the priest who hears us, the. guest who swiftly glides
along.

3\. Vai*s*vânara, neighing like a horse, is kindled by the
women [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:3:1), by the Ku*s*ikas, from age to age;
may this Agni give us abundance in valiant men and in horses and
treasures, he who wakes among the immortals.

 

4\. May the Vâ*g*as [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:4:1) come forward, the
Agnis with their powers. United [2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:4:2) they have
harnessed the spotted deer for their triumphal
procession [3](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:4:3). The Maruts, mightily growing,
the all-wealthy, make the mountains tremble, the unbeguiled ones.

5\. The Maruts who possess the beauty of
Agni [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:5:1), belong to all races of men. We
implore their fierce, strong help. They are tumultuous, the sons of
Rudra, clothed in rain, hot-spirited like
lions [2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:5:2), givers of rain.

6\. We implore with our best praises every host, every troop (of the
Maruts) [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:6:1), the splendour of Agni,

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

the power of the Maruts. With the spotted deer as
horses [2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:6:2), with gifts that cannot be taken
away, they go to the sacrifice wise in the (sacrificial)
ordinances [3](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:6:3).

 

7\. Agni am I, by birth *G*âtavedas. Ghee is my eye; (the drink of)
immortality is in my mouth. The threefold
song [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:7:1) traversing the aerial space, the
imperishable Gharma [2](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:7:2), the sacrificial food
am I by name.

8\. With three purifying strainers he (Agni) purified the song, with his
heart the thought, discovering the light. The mightiest treasure he
produced by the powers of his own nature, and then he looked over heaven
and earth.

9\. Carry him who is the inexhaustible spring with a hundred rills, who
has knowledge of prayers (?), the father of (every speech) that should
be uttered, the roaring one [1](sbe46086.htm#an_3:26:9:1), gladly
excited in the lap of his parents—carry him the truth-speaking across
(all dangers), O ye two worlds!

#### NOTES.

Vi*s*vâmitra is the *Ri*shi of this Sûkta with the exception of the
seventh verse of which the Âtman or Brahman is the *Ri*shi. The metre is
*G*agatî verses 1–6, Trish*t*ubh verses 7–9.—Verse 5 = TB. II, 7, 12, 3.
Verse 7 = VS. XVIII, 66; MS. IV, 12, 5.

The position of this Sûkta in the collection shows that it is to be
divided into three independent hymns. This is confirmed by the metre,
the first and second of these three hymns being in *G*agatî, the third
in Trish*t*ubh, and also by the contents: the first hymn is addressed to
Agni Vai*s*vânara, the second to Agni accompanied by the Maruts, the
third contains mystical speculations about the nature and the deeds of
Agni.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:26:1:1">1</span>. The Ku*s*ikas are identical with
the Vi*s*vâmitras, or possibly the latter form one branch of the
Ku*s*ikas; see H. O., Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen
Gesellschaft, XLII, 209.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:26:2:1">1</span>. On the relation of Mâtari*s*van to
Agni, see above, I, 96, 4, note 1.

Note <span id="an_3:26:2:2">2</span>. B*ri*haspati, though in his origin
distinct from Agni, is here identified with him, like Mâtari*s*van.

#### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:26:3:1">1</span>. By the ten fingers. Comp. above,
I, 71, 1.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_3:26:4:1">1</span>. I adopt the interpretation of
Bergaigne (Religion Védique, II, 405, note 1) and Pischel (Vedische
Studien, I, 46). Vâ´*g*â*h* seems to be the proper name synonym with
*Ri*bháva*h*; the Maruts may be called Vâ´*g*â*h* as they are called
several times *Ri*bhukshá*n*a*h*. But it is possible that we should have
to translate simply, 'May the powers of strength,' &c.; comp. below, 27,
1.

Note <span id="an_3:26:4:2">2</span>. Possibly we have to supply,
'united with their spotted deer, with their beauty,' &c.; see II, 36, 2.
ya*gñ*aí*h* sámmi*s*lâ*h* p*rí*shatîbhi*h* *ri*sh*t*íbhi*h*; VII, 56, 6.
*s*riyâ´ sámmi*s*lâ*h*. Or the meaning may be, 'the Maruts united with
Agni or with the Agnis;' comp. I, 166, 11. sámmi*s*lâ*h* índre.

Note <span id="an_3:26:4:3">3</span>. On *s*ubhé, see M. M., I, 87, 3,
note 2 (vol. xxxii, p. 162).

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_3:26:5:1">1</span>. Or, they receive their beauty
through Agni.

Note <span id="an_3:26:5:2">2</span>. Of heshákratu the probable
explanation has been given by Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 48. See also
von Bradke, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVIII, 297.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:26:6:1">1</span>. Comp. V, 53, II, vol. xxxii, p.
320.

Note <span id="an_3:26:6:2">2</span>. Comp. II, 34, 4, vol. xxxii, p.
302, note 5.

Note <span id="an_3:26:6:3">3</span>. The text has vidátheshu.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:26:7:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 51, 4. arkám
saptá*s*îrshâ*n*am … tridhâ´tum uttamé padé. Is the song called
tridhâ´tu because it is sung by the three Udgât*ri*s (singers)? Or
because it generally comprises three verses (see H. O., Zeitschrift der
Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XXXVIII, 453)?

Note <span id="an_3:26:7:2">2</span>. The Gharma is the offering of hot
milk brought to the A*s*vins. On the probable meaning of this offering,
see H. O., Religion des Veda, 447 seq.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:26:9:1">1</span>. The translation of me*l*í (comp.
IV, 7, 11; Atharva-veda XI, 7, 5; Taitt. Sa*m*h. V, 7, 8, 1) is quite
conjectural.
