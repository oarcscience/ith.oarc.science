### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 149.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 18.

1 [1](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:1:1). Towards great wealth this lord of the
house [2](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:1:2)
advances [3](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:1:3), the strong one in the abode of
strong wealth. Let the stones honour him as he speeds forward.

2\. He the manly (bull) as of men so of the two worlds, whose stream is
drunk by living beings [1](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:2:1) in consequence of
his renown—he who running forward has ripened in (his mother's) womb—

3\. He who lighted up the … [1](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:3:1) stronghold,
the racer, the sage, like a … [2](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:3:2) horse,
shining like the sun, endowed with hundredfold life.

4\. He who has a twofold birth (celestial and terrestrial), the flaming
one has approached the threefold light, all spaces of the atmosphere,
the Hot*ri*, the best sacrificer, in the abode of the Waters.

5\. This is the Hot*ri* having a twofold
birth [1](sbe46047.htm#an_1:149:5:1) who has bestowed all the best
gifts, out of desire of glory, on the quick mortal who worships him.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Virâ*g*.—Verses 3–5 = SV. II, 1124–1126.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:149:1:1">1</span>. My translation of this verse
differs from that of Pischel, Ved. Studien, II, 100.

Note <span id="an_1:149:1:2">2</span>. On páti*h* dán, comp. Hübschmann,
Vocalsystem, 142; Bartholomae, Arische Forschungen, I, 70; Joh. Schmidt,
Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXVII, 309; Pischel, Vedische Studien,

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> II, 93 seq.;
Bartholomae, Indogermanische Forschungen, III, 100 seq.

Note <span id="an_1:149:1:3">3</span>. Comp. X, 93, 6. mahá*h* sá
râyá*h* â´ îshate.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:149:2:1">1</span>. Comp. I, 80, 4, and similar
passages, in which the waters are called *g*îvá-dhanyâ*h*, 'the prize
(of contests) which living beings have gained.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:149:3:1">1</span>. We do not know what nâ´rmi*n*î
is. Possibly in this word two words, ná ármi*n*î, are contained, so that
the particle ná would be repeated in each of the three Pâdas. The
translation would then be: 'he who lighted up the ármi*n*î (?) like a
stronghold.'

Note <span id="an_1:149:3:2">2</span>. I place no confidence in the
attempts to find the meaning of a word like nabhanỹa*h* with the aid of
etymology only. The same word occurs in I, 173, 1 as an epithet of the
Sâman which the priest, who is compared to a bird, sings (gâ´yat sâ´ma
nabhanỹam yáthâ vé*h*). It occurs also in VII, 42, 1. prá krandanú*h*
nabhanuỹasya vetu. The connection in which these words stand, seems to
show that the meaning is: 'the noise of the sacrificial fire shall
arise;' very probably the fire is compared to a horse, and its noise to
the neighing of that horse. Thus nabhanỹa would be in VII, 42, 1, quite
as in our passage, an epithet of a horse. This epithet may refer either
to the swift motion of the horse and of the Sâman ascending to the gods,
or more probably to the gay voice of the horse, the loud noise of the
Sâman.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:149:5:1">1</span>. Two syllables are wanting in the
first Pâda.
