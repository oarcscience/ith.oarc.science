### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 143.

#### ASH*T*AKA II, ADHYÂYA 2, VARGA 12.

1\. I bring forward my most powerful, entirely new (pious) thought
(i. e. hymn). the prayer of my words [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:1:1) to
Agni, the son of strength; he is the child of the
Waters [2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:1:2), the beloved one, who together
with the Vasus has sat down on the Earth as a Hot*ri* observing the
appointed time (for sacrificing).

2\. Being born in the highest heaven Agni became visible to
Mâtari*s*van. By the power of his mind, by his greatness when kindled,
his flame filled Heaven and Earth with light.

3 [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:3:1). His flames are fierce; never ageing
are the flames of him who is beautiful to behold, whose face is
beautiful, whose splendour is beautiful. The never sleeping, never
ageing (rays) of Agni whose power is light, roll forward like streams
across the nights (?) [2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:3:2).

4\. Him the all-wealthy, whom the Bh*ri*gus have set to work on the
navel of the earth, with the whole power of the
world [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:4:1)—stir up that Agni by thy prayers in
his own house—(him) who alone rules over goods like Varu*n*a.

5\. He who is not to be kept back like the roar of the Maruts, like an
army [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:5:1)that is sent forward, like the
thunderbolt of heaven—Agni eats with his sharp jaws, he chews, he throws
down the forests as a warrior throws down his foes.

6\. Would Agni eagerly come to our hymn? Would He the Vasu together with
the Vasus fulfil our desire? Will He, the driver, stir our prayers

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

that they may be successful? (Thus thinking) I praise Him whose face is
bright, with this my prayer.

7\. He who has kindled him strives [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:7:1)
towards Agni as towards Mitra (or, towards a friend)—(to Agni) whose
face shines with ghee, the charioteer of *Ri*ta. May he who when kindled
becomes a racer [2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:7:2), shining at the
sacrifices [3](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:7:3), lift up our bright-coloured
prayer.

8 [1](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:8:1). Preserve us, O Agni, never failing
with thy never-failing, kind and mighty guardians; protect our people
all around with those undeceived, undismayed, never slumbering
(guardians), O thou our wish [2](sbe46041.htm#an_1:143:8:2)!

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, *G*agatî; the last verse Trish*t*ubh. The hymn
has been translated by Kaegi, Siebenzig Lieder des Rigveda, p.
100.—Verse 7 = TB. I, 2, 1, 12.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:143:1:1">1</span>. Comp. VIII, 59, 6. vâ*k*á*h*
mátim.

Note <span id="an_1:143:1:2">2</span>. Agni who is considered as born
from the Waters, is identified several times with a god who, like
Mâtari*s*van, in my opinion had an independent origin, with Apâm napât
('Child of the Waters'). Comp. Bergaigne, Rel. Védique, II, 17 seq.;
H. O., Religion des Veda, 118 seq.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:143:3:1">1</span>. There is no sufficient reason for
transposing verses 3 and 4 (Kaegi).

Note <span id="an_1:143:3:2">2</span>. Probably we should read áti
aktû´n; comp. VI, 4, 5. áti eti aktû´n.—See Bergaigne, Mélanges Renier,
p. 96.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:143:4:1">1</span>. Bhúvanasya seems to depend on
ma*g*mánâ; comp. VII, 82, 5. bhúvanasya ma*g*mánâ.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:143:5:1">1</span>. Pischel (Vedische Studien, I.
231) seems to me to be right in denying that sénâ ever means 'Geschoss,'
and in translating sénâ s*ri*sh*t*â´ 'exercitus effusus.' The opinion of
Prof. von Bradke and Prof. Bloomfield is different; see Zeitschrift der
Deutschen Morgenl. Gesellschaft, XLVI, 456; XLVIII, 549.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:143:7:1">1</span>. The text adds the dativus ethicus
va*h*, 'for you' (comp. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 206), which can
scarcely be translated.

Note <span id="an_1:143:7:2">2</span>. Geldner (Vedische Studien, I,
168) has shown that akrá very probably means 'horse.' Agni is very
frequently compared to a horse.—Comp. Ludwig, Ueber die neuesten
Arbeiten auf dem Gebiete der Rigveda-Forschung, p. 54; Roth, Zeitschrift
der D. Morg. Ges., XLVIII, 118.

Note <span id="an_1:143:7:3">3</span>. See above, I, 31, 6, note 2.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:143:8:1">1</span>. With Pâdas C D compare the verse
VI, 8, 7. ádabdhebhi*h* táva gopâ´bhi*h* ish*t*e asmâ´kam pâhi
trishadhastha sûrî´n.

Note <span id="an_1:143:8:2">2</span>. 'What is ish*t*e? Is it thou our
wish, or thou our sacrifice?' M. M.
