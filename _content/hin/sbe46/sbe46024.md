### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 74.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 21–22.

1\. Going forward to the sacrifice let us repeat a prayer to Agni who
hears us, may he be afar or with us—

2\. He who foremost [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:2:1) in
… [2](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:2:2), when the human tribes met (in battle),
has preserved his home to the worshipper.

3\. And let the people say 'Agni is born, the slayer of foes (or, the
slayer of V*ri*tra), he who wins the prize in every battle.'

4\. The man in whose home thou art a messenger, and to whose sacrificial
food thou eagerly comest for feasting, to whose worship thou impartest
wonderful power—

5\. Such a man the people call a giver of good oblations, O Aṅgiras, a
friend of the gods, O son of strength [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:5:1), and
a possessor of a good Barhis (or sacrificial grass).

6\. And thou shalt conduct them hither, the
gods [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:6:1), that we may praise them, that they
may eagerly come, O resplendent one, to the sacrificial offerings.

7\. No noise [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:7:1) of the horses of the moving
chariot [2](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:7:2) is heard any way, when thou goest
on thy messengership, O Agni.

8\. When guarded by thee the racer becomes fearless; the worshipper, O
Agni, who is behind, gains the advantage [1](sbe46024.htm#an_1:74:8:1)
over him who is ahead.

9\. And thou winnest, O Agni, brilliant, high bliss in strong heroes
from the gods, O god, for the worshipper.

#### NOTES.

This hymn opens the section ascribed to Gotama Râhûga*n*a, and belonging
indeed, as several passages show, to the family of the Gotamas (comp.
Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLII, 221). The metre is
Gâyatrî.—Verse 1 = VS. III, 11; TS. I, 5, 5, 1; MS. I, 5, 1 (I, 5, 5.
6). Verses 1–3 = SV. II, 729. 730. 732. Verse 3 = TS. III, 5, 11, 4; MS.
IV, 10, 3.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:74:2:1">1</span>. Or pûrvyá*h*, 'the old Agni,' cf.
IX, 96, 10? (M. M.)

Note <span id="an_1:74:2:2">2</span>. I have left untranslated the
obscure word snî´hitîshu (Sâya*n*a, vadhakâri*n*îshu). It seems to be
identical with snéhiti, which occurs VIII, 96, 13. ápa snéhitî*h*
n*ri*mánâ*h* adhatta (the Sâma-veda has the reading snîh°). Here the
verb ápa adhatta (comp. VI., 20, 5; X, 164, 3) and the comparison of the
second hemistichs of the two following verses, 14 and 15, seem to show
that the word means some kind of hostile powers, which would do very
well for our passage.—In Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka IV, 23 the word snî´hiti
occurs in an enumeration of the 'terrible substances' (ghorâ´*h*
tanúva*h*) of Agni.—Comp. Ludwig, Ueber die neuesten Arbeiten auf dem
Gebiete der *Ri*g-veda-Forschung, p. 93.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:74:5:1">1</span>. See above, I, 26, 10, note 1.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:74:6:1">1</span>. See Delbrück, Syntaktische
Forschungen, I, 20, 111.

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:74:7:1">1</span>. On upabdí, which literally means
the noise produced by going, see Joh. Schmidt, Kuhn's Zeitschrift, XXV,
55; Hübschmann, Das indogermanische Vocal-system, 124.

Note <span id="an_1:74:7:2">2</span>. Yó*h* (comp. X, 176, 3?) seems to
be a genitive of yú, 'the going one;' comp. sva-yú, *s*ubham-yú; Lanman,
401.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:74:8:1">1</span>. The last syllable of asthât has
the value of two syllables.
