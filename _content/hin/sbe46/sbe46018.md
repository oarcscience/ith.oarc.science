### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 68.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 12.

1\. Cooking [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:1:1) (the oblations?) the quick one
has approached the sky. He has revealed the nights and what stands and
moves [2](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:1:2)—

2\. When he the god, alone of all these
gods [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:2:1) encompassed (the others) by his
greatness.

3\. When thou, O god, hadst been born living from the dry (wood), then
all (gods and men?) were pleased with thy wisdom.

4\. They all obtained the name of divinity, of
immortality [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:4:1), serving the *Ri*ta in due
way.

5\. The instigations of *Ri*ta, the thought of
*Ri*ta [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:5:1): they all performed the works of
\[?\] the full-lived one [2](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:5:2).

6\. Bestow wealth, thou who art the knowing one, on him who worships
thee or who does service to thee [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:6:1).

7\. He who sits down as the Hot*ri* among the offspring of Manu: he
verily is the master of all these riches.

8\. They longed together for the seed in their
bodies [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:8:1), and the wise ones were concordant
among each other in their minds.

9\. They took pleasure in his will, as sons (take pleasure) in their
father's (will), the quick ones who have listened to his command.

10\. He who is rich in food has opened the gates of
wealth [1](sbe46018.htm#an_1:68:10:1). The householder (Agni) has
adorned the sky with stars.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:68:1:1">1</span>. Boehtlingk-Roth are wrong in
deriving *s*rî*n*án (which should more correctly be written *s*ri*n*án,
comp. my Prolegomena, 477) from the root *s*ri. They supply an object
like *s*o*k*i*h* and translate: 'Licht verbreitend hebt er sich zum
Himmel.'

Note <span id="an_1:68:1:2">2</span>. Lanman, 422.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:68:2:1">1</span>. Bollensen conjectures devâ´nâm
devá*h* (instead of devá*h* devâ´nâm) which seems to be right (comp.
below, 69, 2), though this conjecture is not absolutely necessary (see
my Prolegomena, 97):

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:68:4:1">1</span>. Am*rí*tam belongs to nâ´ma; comp.
V, 57, 5. am*rí*tam nâ´ma bhe*g*ire; X, 123, 4. vidát gandharvá*h*
am*rí*tâni nâ´ma.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:68:5:1">1</span>. With *ri*tásya dhîtí*h* comp. I,
71, 3; IV, 23, 8; IX, 76, 4; 97, 34; 111, 2.—Prof. Max Müller thinks
that *ri*ta should be taken as a name of Agni: 'for the righteous (Agni)
are the prayers, for the righteous the devotion.'

Note <span id="an_1:68:5:2">2</span>. Is vi*s*vâ´yu*h* an adverb meaning
'eternally'? As vi*s*vâ´yu is an epithet of Agni frequently used in the
Rig-veda and especially in the Parâ*s*ara hymns (see 67, 6. 10; 68, 5;
73, 4), one feels tempted to read vi*s*vâ´yo*h* (comp. IV, 42, 1.
râsh*t*rám kshatríyasya vi*s*vâ´yo*h*).

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:68:6:1">1</span>. Comp. III, 59, 2. yá*h* te âditya
*s*íkshati vraténa.

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:68:8:1">1</span>. Some light is thrown on this
obscure verse by the hymn, I, 72, a hymn belonging, as our hymn does, to
the Parâ*s*ara collection. It is shown by the second verse of that hymn
(see below), that the searching ones, 'ámûrâ*h*,' are the gods who seek
Agni. It seems probable, consequently, that the 'seed' is Agni (comp. I,
164, 35, where Soma is said to be v*rí*sh*n*a*h* á*s*vasya réta*h*, 'the
seed of the manly horse'). Of the same searching gods in I, 72, 5 the
expression sa*mg*ânânâ´*h* is used; comp. sám *g*ânata in our passage.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:68:10:1">1</span>. Râ´ya*h* must be a genitive;
comp. I, 72, 8. râyá*h* dúra*h* ví *ri*ta*gñ*â´*h* a*g*ânan. Probably
the accent should be râyá*h*; comp., however, Lanman, 431.
