### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 67.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 11.

1\. Victorious [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:1:1) in the forests, a friend
among men, he demands obedience like a king, the undecaying
one [2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:1:2).

2\. Like good peace, like fortunate wisdom, may he (Agni) be a kind
Hot*ri*, a carrier of offerings.

3\. Having taken in his hand all manly powers, he has made the gods
fear, when sitting down in his hiding-place.

4\. There the thoughtful men find him, when they have recited the spells
which they had fashioned in their heart.

5\. As the goat [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:5:1) (supports) the
earth [2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:5:2), thus he supports the
earth [2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:5:2); he upholds the sky by his
efficacious spells.

6\. Protect the dear [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:6:1) footsteps of the
cattle [2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:6:2). O Agni, thou who hast a full life,
thou hast gone from covert to covert [3](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:6:3).

7\. He who has seen him the hidden one, he who has got near to the
stream of *Ri*ta [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:7:1)—

8\. They who get him off, doing service to *Ri*ta, to
him [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:8:1) he then indicates riches.

9\. He who grows up with might within the plants, and within the
children [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:9:1), and within the sprouting
grass [2](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:9:2)—

10\. The splendour \[?\] in the home of the
waters [1](sbe46017.htm#an_1:67:10:1), the full-lived. The sages made
him as if building a seat.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi and metre.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:67:1:1">1</span>. '*G*âyu*h*: aus *g*yâyu*h*, wie
der compar. *g*yâyân *g*yesh*th*a*h* zeigt,' Ludwig. But what shows that
*g*yâyân is the comparative of *g*âyu*h* and that the utterly impossible
change of *g*y into *g* is possible? Ludwig's translation 'überwindend'
is right; comp. I, 119, 3.

Note <span id="an_1:67:1:2">2</span>. I propose to read a*g*uryá*h*.
Prof. Max Müller conjectures—as Roth (Pet. Dict.) has done—that
*s*rush*t*i may mean 'obedient, servant;' he translates: 'He desires a
servant (or worshipper) who is not aged.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:67:5:1">1</span>. On the mythical goat whose office
it is to support the worlds, comp. I, 164, 6; VIII, 41, 10; X, 82, 6;
Bergaigne, III, 21; H. O., Religion des Veda, 72.

Note <span id="an_1:67:5:2">2</span>. For 'earth' the text has two
different words, kshâ´m and p*ri*thivî´m. Prof. Max Müller conjectures
dyâ´m for kshâ´m: 'He, Agni, supports the earth, as the buck the sky.'

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:67:6:1">1</span>. Literally, 'the dear footsteps;'
but the meaning of priyá may be compared to that of the Homeric φίλος,
his own.

Note <span id="an_1:67:6:2">2</span>. One could be tempted to refer the
word pa*s*u to Agni, whose footsteps (padâ´ni) the 'wise ones' follow
(65, 2), and whom they find out in his hiding. Thus we could translate,
'Look at the dear footsteps of the beast.' But the comparison of 70, 6
makes it more probable that the imperative ní pâhi is addressed to Agni.
I believe therefore that Grassmann is right in translating 'Die lieben
Stätten der Heerden schütze.' Ludwig's translation is

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

similar to this. Prof. Max Müller translates: 'Observe the footsteps of
the animal (the stolen animal of the thief Agni).'

Note <span id="an_1:67:6:3">3</span>. With guhâ´ gúham comp. I, 53, 7.
yudhâ´ yúdham, purâ´ púram.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:67:7:1">1</span>. Dhâ´râm *ri*tásya: comp. V, 1 2,
2. *ri*tásya dhâ´râ*h* ánu t*ri*ndhi pûrvî´*h*, 'open the many streams
of *Ri*ta;' VII, 43, 4. *ri*tásya dhâ´râ*h* sudúghâ*h* dúhânâ*h*,
'milking the streams of *Ri*ta flowing with plenty.' The stream of
*Ri*ta seems to mean the stream of blessings (such as rain, ghee, &c.)
which flows to mankind according to the eternal laws of *Ri*ta.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:67:8:1">1</span>. The poet passes over from the
plural to the singular.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:67:9:1">1</span>. Bollensen's conjecture pra*g*â´su
(instead of pra*g*â´*h* utá) seems very probable to me. Prof. von Roth
(Ueber gewisse Kürzungen des Wortendes, p. 2) takes a different view.

Note <span id="an_1:67:9:2">2</span>. Comp. I, 95, 10 (see below); VII,
9, 3. apâ´m gárbha*h* prasṽa*h* â´ vive*s*a, 'the son of the waters has
entered upon the sprouting grass.'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:67:10:1">1</span>. 'Why not *k*iti*h* apâm dame,
that is, the (burning) pile in the home of the waters.' M. M.
