### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 76.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 24.

1\. What supplication is to thy mind's
taste [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:1:1)? What (pious) thought may be, O
Agni, most agreeable to thee? Or who has won for himself thy wisdom by
sacrifices? Or with what thoughts may we worship
thee [2](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:1:2)?

2\. Come hither, Agni, sit down here as a Hot*ri*. Become our
undeceivable leader [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:2:1). May Heaven and Earth,
the all-embracing, protect thee. Offer the sacrifice to the gods that
they may be highly gracious to us.

3\. Burn down all sorcerers, O Agni; become a protector of the
sacrifices against imprecations. And. conduct hither the lord of Soma
(Indra) with his two bay horses. We have prepared hospitality for him,
the good giver.

4\. With words procuring offspring, carrying thee (to our sacrifice)
with my mouth [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:1), I
call [2](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:2) thee hither, and thou shalt sit down
here with the gods. Perform the service of a Hot*ri* and of a
Pot*ri* [3](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:3), O worshipful one. Be thou a giver
and a father [4](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:4:4) of riches.

5\. As thou didst perform sacrifice to the gods with the sacrificial
food of the wise Manu [1](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:5:1), a sage together
with sages, thus, O highly truthful Hot*ri*, perform thou the sacrifice
to-day, O Agni, with thy joy-giving sacrificial
ladle [2](sbe46026.htm#an_1:76:5:2).

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. Metre, Trish*t*ubh.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:76:1:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a takes vára in the sense
of 'holding back' (comp. I, 143, 5), and makes mánasa*h* depend on
várâya. He says, 'he agne te tava manaso varâya nivâra*n*âyâsmâsv.
avasthâpanâya kopetir bhuvat kîd*ris*am upagamana*m* bhavet.' The modern
translators are evidently right in assigning to vára the meaning of
'wish' or the like (comp. VII, 59, 2. yá*h* va*h* várâya dâ´*s*ati), but
they differ as to whether mánasa*h* should be taken as belonging to
várâya or to úpeti*h*. Ludwig translates, 'Welches nahen des geistes ist
gegenstand der wal dir?' Grassmann, 'Welch Nahen ist nach deines Herzens
Wunsche?' My opinion is that the tradition of the text is not quite free
from suspicion. My doubts are based on VI, 21, 4. kás te ya*gñ*á*h*
mánase *s*ám várâya, 'What sacrifice (O Indra) is agreeable to thy mind,
to thy wish?' Here we have a question addressed to the god, beginning
with kás te, quite similar to the question of our poet, which begins
with kâ´ te. We have the word *s*ám, as in our passage *s*á*m*tamâ. We
have várâya exactly as in our passage. We have, by the side of várâya, a
case-form of mánas as in our passage. But we have the dative mánase
instead of the genitive mánasa*h*. We may add that there are some other
passages in which a dative of a similar meaning stands likewise by the
side of várâya: thus, VIII, 82, 3. áram várâya manyáve bhûvat te indra
*s*ám (comp. bhuvat agne *s*á*m*tamâ in our passage) h*ri*dé, 'May it
be, O Indra, according to thy wish and thy mood, may it be agreeable to
thy heart;' VIII, 84, 4. várâya deva manyáve, 'to thy wish, O god, to
thy mood.'

All this tends to raise the supposition that in our

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

passage also we should read mánase várâya, which datives seem to depend
on *s*á*m*tamâ. We should then translate, 'What supplication, what
(pious) thought may be, O Agni, most agreeable to thy mind and to thy
wish?'

Note <span id="an_1:76:1:2">2</span>. This seems to be a Pâda of the
defective type, with four syllables before the caesura and ending as if
there were five syllables before the caesura; comp. my Prolegomena, 68
seq. It would be easy, however, to restore the normal metrical form, for
instance, by reading túbhyam instead of te.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:76:2:1">1</span>. Pura*h*-etâ´, literally, 'he who
goes before somebody.'

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:76:4:1">1</span>. It would be unnatural to give to
the medium â´ huve the passive sense and not to translate it, as it must
be translated in so many passages, 'I call (thee) hither.' But, if so,
it is very difficult to avoid the conclusion that váhni*h* âsâ´ ('he who
carries somebody with his mouth;' comp. I, 129, 5; VI, 11, 2; 16, 9;
VII, 16, 9; X, 115, 3 see vol. xxxii, pp. 42 seq.) refers here not to
Agni, the divine carrier, but to the human priest, who with his mouth,
i. e. by his songs, carries Agni to his sacrifice. Váhni is used very
frequently indeed of human worshippers, and generally the transferring
of epithets of the divine priest Agni to human priests, and vice versa,
is quite to the taste of Vedic poets.—Comp. on â´ huve and váhni*h*
âsâ´, Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beiträge, XVIII, 320 seq.; XX, 69, and
below, I, 127, 8, note 1; S. B. E., vol. xxxii, p. 42. See also
Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, 473, who very rightly observes: es liegt
kein Grund vor, dem huvé den Character einer ersten Person zu versagen.

Note <span id="an_1:76:4:2">2</span>. On the accent of huvé, on which
Ludwig bases very bold conclusions, see Delbrück, Altindische Syntax,
41; Weber, Indische Studien, XIII, 73.

Note <span id="an_1:76:4:3">3</span>. Comp. X, 3, 3.—On the priestly
functions of the

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pot*ri*, see
Weber, Indische Studien, X, 141, 366, 376 seq.; H. O., Religion des
Veda, 391.

Note <span id="an_1:76:4:4">4</span>. On these vocatives, see Delbrück,
Altindische Syntax, 106.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:76:5:1">1</span>. Manus is here a proper name; comp.
Bergaigne, I, 65 seq. On his priestly character, comp. H. O., Religion
des Veda, 275.

Note <span id="an_1:76:5:2">2</span>. On *g*uhṽâ, comp. Pischel, Ved.
Studien, II, 113. The ladle is meant for the flame of Agni.
