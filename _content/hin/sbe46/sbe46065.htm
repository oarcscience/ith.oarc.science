<p>1. Shining Agni has awoke over against the Dawns, the priest who traces the footsteps of the sages&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:1:1">1</A>. With his broad stream of light kindled by the pious, the carrier (of the gods) has opened the two doors of darkness.</p>  
<p>2. Agni has grown strong by praises, by the speeches of the praisers, by hymns, the adorable one. Loving many aspects of <I>Ri</I>ta the messenger has shone up at the bursting forth of the Dawn.</p>  
<p>3. Agni has been established among the tribes of men, the son of the waters, Mitra&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:3:1">1</A>, acting in the right way. The delightful, worshipful one has reached the top; the priest has become one who should be invoked by prayers.</p>  
<p>4. Agni becomes Mitra&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:4:1">1</A>, when he has been kindled; he the Hot<I>ri</I> (Agni becomes) Mitra; he, <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, (becomes) Varu<I>n</I>a. The quick Adhvaryu, the domestic (god, Agni, becomes) Mitra, the Mitra (i.&nbsp;e. friend or ally) of the rivers and of the mountains.</p>  
<p>5. He observes the deceiver's dear summit&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:1">1</A>, the footstep of the bird&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:1">1</A>; the vigorous one&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:2">2</A> observes the course of the Sun. Agni observes at his (?) navel the seven-headed (song?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:5:3">3</A>; tall (Agni) observes the enjoyment of the gods.</p>  
<p>6. The <I>Ri</I>bhu&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:1">1</A> has created for himself a good name worthy of being magnified, he, the god who knows all laws. The skin of the herbs&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:2">2</A>, the bird's footstep&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:6:3">3</A> rich in ghee: Agni watches (all) that, never failing.</p>  
<p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></A></p>  
<p>7. Agni has approached the place&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:7:1">1</A> rich in ghee (the altar), with broad passages, (the place) longing (for him), longing (himself). He the resplendent, bright, tall purifier has made his two parents&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:7:2">2</A> new again and again.</p>  
<p>8. As soon as born he has grown by the grass&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:8:1">1</A>, when the sprouting (grass-)blades strengthen him with ghee. Like waters beautiful on their precipitous path, Agni, being in the lap of his parents, has escaped into wide space.</p>  
<p>9. Receiving praise the vigorous one&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:9:1">1</A> has shone forth with his fuel, on heaven's summit, on the earth's navel. May Agni worthy of being magnified, (being) Mitra and M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, the messenger, carry hither the gods that they may receive our sacrifice.</p>  
<p>10. The tall one has, by (receiving) fuel, upheld the firmament, Agni, becoming the highest of lights, when M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van for the sake of the Bh<I>ri</I>gus&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46065.htm#an_3:5:10:1">1</A> kindled the carrier of oblations, (Agni) who dwelt in secret.</p>  
<p>11 = III, 1, 23.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;No verse occurs in the other Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:1:1">1</A>. On pada-v&icirc;&acute;, comp. Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 299.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:3:1">1</A>. Mitra has here and in verse 4 two meanings: it is the name of the god Mitra, with whom Agni is identified (Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, III, 134 seq.), and it means also 'friend' or 'ally' (comp. H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 186, note 1). See von Bradke, Dy&acirc;us Asura, p. 13.</p>  
<p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:4:1">1</A>. See verse 3, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:5:1">1</A>. All this is very enigmatical. In the parallel passage, IV, 5, 8, we have, instead of rip&aacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;gram, the reading rup&aacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;gram, which is confirmed by verse 7 of the same hymn (&aacute;gre rup&aacute;<I>h</I>) and by X, 13, 3 (p&aacute;<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a pad&acirc;&acute;ni rup&aacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;nu aroham); in support of the reading rip&aacute;<I>h</I>, on the other side, the verse, X, 79, 3 (rip&aacute;<I>h</I> up&aacute;sthe ant&aacute;<I>h</I>), may be quoted. The meaning of r&uacute;p is unknown; r&iacute;p means 'deceit' and 'deceiver:' but what is the summit of the deceiver? Bergaigne (Religion V&eacute;dique, II, 77 seq.) has tried to solve the riddle, but it is really hopeless.&#8212;The meaning of the following words, pad&aacute;<I>m</I> v&eacute;<I>h</I>, is not quite so obscure; there is at least some probability that the bird is Agni himself (cf. below, III, 7, 7), or possibly the sun. The latter explanation is advocated by Prof. Max M&uuml;ller, who writes: 'May it not be a description of sunrise? priyam ripa<I>h</I> agram I do not understand; but padam ve<I>h</I> is the place of the bird, as in I, 130, 3. ve<I>h</I> na garbham, the nest of the bird or of the sun. This nest is covered by a stone, is in fact the vra<I>g</I>a, which has to be opened to let out the light of day. It is also the yoni or the altar. Ripa<I>h</I> agram may possibly be the summit of the Pa<I>n</I>i or of V<I>ri</I>tra, X, 79, 3.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:5:2">2</A>. See above, I, 36, 1, note 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:5:3">3</A>. Sapt&aacute;-<I>s</I>&icirc;rshan ('seven-headed') occurs again in two other passages of the Rig-veda (VIII, 51, 4, and X, 67, 1); in both it is an epithet of words which signify 'hymn' or 'prayer' (ark&aacute;, dh&icirc;&acute;). Possibly a similar word should be supplied here. But why are the prayers called 'seven-headed?' Does this refer to unknown technicalities of the Vedic liturgy? Does it stand in connection with the seven tones of the scale, with the expression sapt&aacute; dh&icirc;t&aacute;ya<I>h</I>, with the number of the seven Hot<I>ri</I>s? 'Celui qui a sept t&ecirc;tes est sans doute un personnage &eacute;quivalent &agrave; lui seul au</p>  
<p><a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></A></p>  
<p>groupe des sept pr&ecirc;tres,' says Bergaigne (II, 145), which is very ingenious, but should not be given as a doubtless fact.&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller observes that sapta<I>s</I>&icirc;rshan may be, like sapt&acirc;sya, the vra<I>g</I>a of Pa<I>n</I>i, opened by Agni, IV, 51, 4, and that B<I>ri</I>haspati is called sapt&acirc;sya, IV, 50, 4, and saptagu, X, 47, 6.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:6:1">1</A>. Agni is here called <I>Ri</I>bhu in his quality as a skilful artisan. See Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, II, 408.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:6:2">2</A>. There seems to be no doubt that sas&aacute; (comp. sasy&aacute;) means 'herb' or possibly 'grain' in X, 79, 3; the text there has sas&aacute;m n&aacute; pakv&aacute;m; comp. I, 66, 2. y&aacute;va<I>h</I> n&aacute; pakv&aacute;<I>h</I>. The same meaning is quite admissible in I, 51, 3; V, 21, 4; VIII, 72, 3; though these passages are too uncertain for deciding anything. I cannot find any reason for believing that we have here and in IV, 5, 7; 7, 7 (see below), another word derived from the root sas, and meaning 'the sleeper.' At all events I neither pretend to know what mysteries are hidden under the 'skin of the herbs,' nor what stories may have happened to the 'peau du dormeur' (Bergaigne, II, 78 seq.).</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:6:3">3</A>. See verse 5, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:7:1">1</A>. Y&oacute;nim, literally 'womb.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:7:2">2</A>. Probably Heaven and Earth.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:8:1">1</A>. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller refers this to the grass of the barhis, or the tender blades in which the spark is caught and kept alive by ghee.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:9:1">1</A>. Comp. above, I, 36, 1, note 2.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:5:10:1">1</A>. I have adopted, though I do not believe it certain, Grassmann's opinion on the meaning of p&aacute;ri in this connection. Comp. H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 123, note 4.</p>
