<p>1. Benevolent Agni has looked on the breaking of the shining dawns, on the bestowal of treasures. Come to the dwelling of the virtuous (mortal), ye A<I>s</I>vins. The god S&ucirc;rya rises with his light.</p>  
<p>2. The god Savit<I>ri</I> has sent his light upward&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:1">1</A>, shaking his banner&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:2">2</A> like a warrior who fights for cows&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:2:3">3</A>. Varu<I>n</I>a and Mitra follow the law, when they make the Sun rise on heaven.</p>  
<p>3. Him whom (the gods) dwelling in firm peace, and never losing their object, have created for dispersing the darkness&#8212;Him, the Sun, the all-observer, the seven young fallow mares carry forward.</p>  
<p>4. With (thy horses) most ready to run thou goest&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:1">1</A> forward, spreading out thy web (of light), removing (from the world) the black cloth (of darkness), O god. The rays of the Sun have shaken&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:4:2">2</A> the darkness, and have sunk it into the waters like a hide.</p>  
<p>5. Unsupported, unattached, spread out downwards-turned&#8212;how is it that he&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46102.htm#an_4:13:5:1">1</A> does not fall down? By what power of his does he move? Who has seen (that)? Erected as the pillar of Heaven he protects the firmament.</p>  
<p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 357</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;Verse 4 = TB. II, 4, 5, 4.</p>  
<p>This hymn and the next evidently form a couple. They have the same number of verses, and are composed in the same metre. They are both addressed to Agni in his matutinal character, or rather to the A<I>s</I>vins, who are invoked to partake of the matutinal oblation (13, 1; 14, 1. 4). The first verse of 13 is quite similar to that of 14; the same may be said of the second verses of the two hymns; the concluding verse of both is identical.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:13:2:1">1</A>. Cf. above, IV, 6, 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:13:2:2">2</A>. Cf. Zend drafsha, 'banner.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:13:2:3">3</A>. Cf. IV, 40, 2. s&aacute;tv&acirc; bharish&aacute;<I>h</I> gavish&aacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:13:4:1">1</A>. The Sun is addressed.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:13:4:2">2</A>. It is more natural to take d&aacute;vidhvata<I>h</I> as nom. plur. than as gen. sing. (Ludwig).</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_4:13:5:1">1</A>. The Sun.</p>
