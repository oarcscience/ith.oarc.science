### MA*ND*ALA III, HYMN 27.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 1, VARGA 28–30.

1\. Forward (goes) your [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:1:1) strength tending
heavenward, rich in offerings, with the (ladle) full of ghee. To the
gods goes (the worshipper) desirous of their favour.

2\. I magnify [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:2:1) with prayer Agni who has
knowledge of prayers (?), the accomplisher of sacrifice, who hears us,
and in whom (manifold wealth) has been laid down.

3\. O Agni, may we be able to bridle thee the strong
god [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:3:1); may we overcome (all) hostile powers.

 

4\. Agni, inflamed at the sacrifice, the purifier who should be
magnified, whose hair is flame—him we approach (with prayers).

5\. With his broad stream of light the immortal Agni, clothed in ghee,
well served with oblations, is the carrier of offerings at the
sacrifice.

6\. Holding the (sacrificial) ladles, performing the sacrifice they have
with right thought pressingly brought Agni
hither [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:6:1) for help.

 

7\. The Hot*ri*, the immortal god goes in front with his secret
power [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:7:1), instigating the
sacrifices [2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:7:2).

8\. The strong (horse, i. e. Agni) is set at the races. He is led forth
at the sacrifices, the priest, the accomplisher of sacrifice.

9\. He has been produced [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:9:1) by prayer, the
excellent one. I have established [2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:9:2) him, the
germ of beings, for ever the father of
Daksha [3](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:9:3).

 

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

10\. I have laid thee down [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:10:1), the excellent
one, with the nourishment [2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:10:2) of Daksha, O
thou who art produced by power, O Agni, thee the resplendent one, O
U*s*i*g* [3](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:10:3).

11\. The priests, eager to set to work the
*Ri*ta [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:11:1), kindle with quick strength Agni
the governor [2](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:11:2), him who crosses the
waters [3](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:11:3).

12\. I magnify [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:12:1) the child of vigour at
this sacrifice, who shines under the heaven, the thoughtful Agni.

 

13\. He who should be magnified and adored, who is visible through the
darkness, Agni, the manly, is kindled [1](sbe46087.htm#an_3:27:13:1).

14\. Agni, the manly, is kindled, he who draws hither the gods like a
horse. The (worshippers) rich in offerings magnify him.

15\. We the manly ones will kindle thee the manly (god), O manly Agni
who shinest mightily.

#### NOTES.

The same *Ri*shi. The metre is Gâyatrî.—The position of the hymn in the
collection shows that it is to be divided into T*rik*as, and this is
confirmed by the ritual use of several of these T*rik*as (see Bergaigne,
Recherches sur l’Histoire de la Liturgie Védique, 19, note 1). Some of
the T*rik*as at least, however, do not seem to form independent hymns;
verse 10 very probably stands in connection with verse 9, and the same
seems to be the case with verses 12 and 13. Ludwig (IV, 305) and
Bergaigne (loc. cit.) consider the whole Sûkta as a collection of
Sâmidhenîs or verses to be recited for each piece of wood thrown into
the fire. Comp. Hillebrandt, Neu- und Vollmondsopfer, 77.—Verse 1

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

5; MS. IV, 11, 2. Verse 4 = TS. II, 5, 8, 6; TB. III, 5, 2, 3. Verses
5–6 = TB. III, 6, 1, 3; MS. IV, 10, 1 (verse 5 = MS. IV, 11, 2). Verses

AV. XX, 102, 1–3.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_3:27:1:1">1</span>. Of the priests and sacrificers?

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_3:27:2:1">1</span>. The text has î´*l*e.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_3:27:3:1">1</span>. Comp. above, II, 5, 1.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_3:27:6:1">1</span>. Comp. IV, 17, 18. vayám hí â´ te
*k*ak*ri*má sabâ´dha*h*.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_3:27:7:1">1</span>. Mâyáyâ: comp. H. O., Religion des
Veda, 163, 294.

Note <span id="an_3:27:7:2">2</span>. Vidáthâni: comp. I, 31, 6, note 2.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_3:27:9:1">1</span>. This seems to mean, 'he has been
set to work.'

Note <span id="an_3:27:9:2">2</span>. Â´ dadhe must be first person
(comp. ní dadhe, verse 10) for the bhûtâ´nâm gárbha*h* is Agni.

Note <span id="an_3:27:9:3">3</span>. Or, the father of intelligence.
Daksha is the personified intelligence. Comp. vol. xxxii, p. 245 seq.;
Bergaigne, Religion Védique, III, 93 seq.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_3:27:10:1">1</span>. See above, III, 23, 4.

Note <span id="an_3:27:10:2">2</span>. The text has i*l*â´, the same
word as in 24, 2.—Prof. Max Müller observes, 'Could it be, ni tvâ dadhe
i*l*â, I have placed thee on the altar with nutriment, son of the
strength of Daksha?'

Note <span id="an_3:27:10:3">3</span>. Or, 'the willing one.'

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_3:27:11:1">1</span>. 'Setting to work the Right
(*Ri*ta)' means here 'performing the sacrifice.' The sacrifice is
considered as a sphere especially pervaded by the power of *Ri*ta. Comp.
H. O., Religion des Veda, 197.

Note <span id="an_3:27:11:2">2</span>. Yantûram (comp. VIII, 19, 2.
agním î*li*shva yantûram; Lanman, 486) must be the same as yantâ´ram
(comp. μάρτυρ? \[M. M.\] See de Saussure, Mémoire sur le Système
Primitif des Voyelles, p. 207; but comp. also Kretschmer, Kuhn's
Zeitschrift, XXXI, p. 447). To me it seems to be an accommodation to
aptúram, facilitated probably by the influence of the genitive yantúr.
See Lanman, Noun-Inflection in the Veda, p. 486; Wackernagel in Kuhn's
Zeitschrift, XXV, 287.

Note <span id="an_3:27:11:3">3</span>. See Pischel, Vedische Studien, I,
122 seq.; H. O., Göttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen, 1889, p. 4 seq.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_3:27:12:1">1</span>. The text has î*l*e. In the same
way î*l*énya*h* verse 13, î*l*ate verse 14.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_3:27:13:1">1</span>. Observe sám idhyate here and
verse 14, sám idhîmahi verse 15. The verses 13–15 form one T*rik*a.
