<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi. Metre, Trish<I>t</I>ubh.</p>  
<p>Though the hymns 71&#8211;73 are not composed in the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> metre like the preceding hymns, it is shown by 'manifold evidence that they had the same origin. Verse 8 = VS. XXXIII, 11; TS. I, 3, 14, 6; MS. IV, 14, 15.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:1:1">1</A>. Comp. Geldner, Vedische Studien, II, 134.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:1:2">2</A>. if the text is correct, the 'sisters' may either</p>  
<p><a name="page_76"><font size="1" color="green">p. 76</font></A></p>  
<p>be the ten fingers which generate Agni by attrition (III, 29, 13; IV, 6, 8), or the streams of water among which Agni grows up, or streams of Gh<I>ri</I>ta or the like (comp. II, 5, 5 see below). Why these sisters are said to delight in the dark and in the bright goddess, the Night and the Dawn, remains doubtful.</p>  
<p>But I think there are reasons which strongly recommend a correction of the text. In III, 55, II we read <I>s</I>y&acirc;&acute;v&icirc; <I>k</I>a &#8230; &aacute;rush&icirc; <I>k</I>a sv&aacute;s&acirc;rau, 'the two sisters, the dark one and the red one.' Is it not probable that in our passage also it is the sisters who are described as dark and red? The dark goddess and the red goddess of course are Night and Dawn, and Night and Dawn, as is well known, are sisters in Vedic poetry. And furthermore the 'sisters' are described in our verse as amorously exciting the god Agni: for it cannot well be doubted that the sv&aacute;s&acirc;ra<I>h</I> of the third P&acirc;da are identical with the u<I>s</I>at&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> of the first: similarly it is said in 70, 7&#8212;in a hymn belonging to the same collection with out S&ucirc;kta&#8212;that the Nights and Dawns augment Agni's greatness; in other passages Agni is represented as beloved by the Dawn, or as suckled by Night and Dawn (Bergaigne, Religion V&eacute;dique, II, 14. 15). The 'sisters' then are stated in our verse to delight (a<I>g</I>ushran), probably in Agni: now we read in II, 2, 2. abh&iacute; tv&acirc; n&aacute;kt&icirc;<I>h</I> ush&aacute;sa<I>h</I> vav&acirc;<I>s</I>ire &aacute;gne vats&aacute;m n&aacute; sv&aacute;sareshu dhen&aacute;va<I>h</I>, 'The Nights and Dawns, Agni, have lowed at thee as the milch-cows in their stalls at their calves;' comp. Bergaigne, II, 15. Thus everything is clear, if we take the u<I>s</I>at&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> and the sv&aacute;s&acirc;ra<I>h</I> for the bright and dark goddesses, i.&nbsp;e. for the Dawns and Nights. The correction of the text to which this interpretation leads, is sv&aacute;s&acirc;ra<I>h</I> <I>s</I>y&acirc;&acute;v&icirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;rush&icirc;<I>h</I> a<I>g</I>ushran, 'the dark and the red sisters have delighted (in Agni).' It is easy to understand that the corruption of the text was occasioned by the simile of the fourth P&acirc;da. The words ush&aacute;sam n&aacute; <I>g</I>&acirc;&acute;va<I>h</I> seemed to demand a parallel nominative and a parallel accusative in the third P&acirc;da. The nominative was sv&aacute;s&acirc;ra<I>h</I>, but there was no accusative. Thus probably arose the reading <I>s</I>y&acirc;&acute;v&icirc;m &aacute;rush&icirc;m.</p>  
<p><a name="page_77"><font size="1" color="green">p. 77</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:2:1">1</A>. On the A&#7749;giras as the fathers of the priestly tribes, see H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 278.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:2:2">2</A>. The phrase ush&aacute;sa<I>h</I> ket&uacute;<I>h</I> occurs several times in the Rig-veda. I think that ket&uacute;m usr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> means exactly the same; it has been shown by Kaegi, Festgruss an Boehtlingk, p. 49, and by Bartholomae, Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, XV, 185, that a genitive sing. usr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> existed.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:3:1">1</A>. Ludwig refers asya to the sacrificer, Bollensen to Agni, and so does S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a. I believe that asya should be explained as <I>ri</I>t&aacute;sya; the phrase <I>ri</I>t&aacute;sya dh&icirc;t&iacute; is frequently used, comp. IV, 23, 8; IX, 76, 4; 97, 34; 111, 2. See also Ludwig's note on III, 31, 1 (vol. v, p. 65).&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller refers <I>ri</I>ta to Agni. 'One might translate it by righteous: They established the righteous (Agni), they moved his mind (made him attend?).'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:3:2">2</A>. The substantive (of feminine gender) which is to be supplied to didhishv&#771;a<I>h</I>, &aacute;t<I>ri</I>shyant&icirc;<I>h</I>, &amp;c., seems to me to be g&iacute;ra<I>h</I> or the like. Ary&aacute;<I>h</I> stands frequently together with g&iacute;ra<I>h</I>.&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller writes: 'Could not ari be a feminine like <I>k</I>arsha<I>n</I>i and vi<I>s</I>; see before, I, 70, I. We should then translate, and then the people emulous, widely spread, never flagging [the stones also are called at<I>ri</I>shit&acirc;<I>h</I> at<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>a<I>g</I>a<I>h</I>, X, 94, 11], and active go towards the gods.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:3:3">3</A>. See above, 70, 1, note 1.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:3:4">4</A>. Are the prayers called 'free from thirst' because they are accompanied by libations of Gh<I>ri</I>ta, Soma, &amp;c.?</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:3:5">5</A>. I believe that dev&acirc;&acute;n <I>g</I>&aacute;nma depends both on &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>&acirc; and on vardh&aacute;yant&icirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:3:6">6</A>. Dev&acirc;&acute;n, or rather dev&acirc;&acute;m, is gen. plur.; see above, 70, 6, with note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:4:1">1</A>. The place in which v&iacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I> stands would seen to show that it is an epithet of M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, and so it is understood by Ludwig and by Bergaigne (Rel. V&eacute;d. I, 54).</p>  
<p><a name="page_78"><font size="1" color="green">p. 78</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> But it is Agni himself, not M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, who is very frequently mentioned as v&iacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta or the like. As we read here, v&iacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I> &#8230; g<I>ri</I>h&eacute;-g<I>ri</I>he, it is said in V, II, 4. agn&iacute;m n&aacute;ra<I>h</I> v&iacute; bharante g<I>ri</I>h&eacute;-g<I>ri</I>he, 'the men carry Agni hither and thither, to every house;' comp. I, 70, 10; III, 55, 4; X, 1, 2; 45, 2; 80, 4. Thus I believe the poet means to say that M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van first kindled Agni, in one place of course, and that Agni then was brought to many places, to all human dwellings. I think that the text indeed can be understood in this way, if we suppose that the author, for the sake of the metre, allowed himself a hyperbaton or synchysis.</p>  
<p>We must not omit to mention that the first P&acirc;da of I, 148, 1 is nearly identical with our passage: m&aacute;th&icirc;t y&aacute;t &icirc;m vish<I>t</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> m&acirc;tar&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc;. This P&acirc;da is deficient by one syllable. If we were to read v&iacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I>, as in our passage, this would lead indeed to the conclusion that there is no hyperbaton in our verse&#8212;for the verse, I, 148, 1, could not be explained in that way&#8212;but that v&iacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I> refers to M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van. I think, however, that it is more than doubtful that the verse, I, 148, 1, really ought to be corrected in this way; whatever may have been the original form of that verse, it is quite possible, and even probable, that it differed from our passage just in that one word.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:4:2">2</A>. The exact meaning of Bh<I>r&iacute;</I>gav&acirc;<I>n</I>a is doubtful. It is, of course, derived from Bh<I>r&iacute;</I>gu as v&aacute;sav&acirc;na, t&aacute;kav&acirc;na, from v&aacute;su, t&aacute;ku. Agni is called Bh<I>r&iacute;</I>gav&acirc;<I>n</I>a also in IV, 7, 4. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 54.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:4:3">3</A>. With the words &acirc;&acute; d&ucirc;ty&#771;am viv&acirc;ya comp. IV, 9, 6. v&eacute;shi &iacute;t u asya d&ucirc;ty&#771;am.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:5:1">1</A>. This difficult verse evidently treats of the incest which the father Dyaus has committed with his daughter. Compare on this subject Bergaigne, Rel. V&eacute;d. II, 109 seq. Agni seems to be represented here as stimulating the desire of the father; the 'sap' (r&aacute;sa) probably is the sperm, comp. I, 105, 2.</p>  
<p><a name="page_79"><font size="1" color="green">p. 79</font></A></p>  
<p>In the second P&acirc;da, Agni, having done, as it seems, some mischief, goes away to the speckled cows.' We cannot say who these speckled cows were; they evidently are identical with those mentioned in another passage treating of the same story, X, 61, S.&#8212;Bergaigne paraphrases the second P&acirc;da of our verse, wrongly in my opinion, 'Agni sort furtivement de cette fille, de cette vache, p<I>ri</I><I>s</I>an&icirc;&acute;.'</p>  
<p>The archer who shoots at Agni (third P&acirc;da) is not better known to us than the speckled cows. Bergaigne's opinion, 'que cet archer n&#8217;est autre que le p&egrave;re lui-m&ecirc;me,' is not very convincing.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:6:1">1</A>. The traditional reading vibh&acirc;&acute;ti ('he who shines for thee in his house') gives no satisfactory sense. I propose to read vidh&acirc;&acute;ti. Cf. I, 120, 1. kath&acirc;&acute; vidh&acirc;ti &aacute;pra<I>k</I>et&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:6:2">2</A>. I have some doubts as to the correctness of u<I>s</I>at&aacute;<I>h</I> (Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;p&acirc;<I>th</I>a, u<I>s</I>at&oacute;) &aacute;nu dy&ucirc;&acute;n. U<I>s</I>&aacute;t, of course, is an epithet not of the days, but of Agni. But then we expect the dative. Correcting the text (u<I>s</I>at&eacute;) is all the easier, because before a following vowel the dative and the genitive were, in the original pronunciation, identical (u<I>s</I>at&aacute;<sup><small>&#2365;</small></sup>&aacute;nu; see my Prolegomena, 447 sqq.); the spellings of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;p&acirc;<I>th</I>a, u<I>s</I>at&oacute; &aacute;nu and u<I>s</I>at&eacute; &aacute;nu, belong to the inventions of Vedic grammarians.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:6:3">3</A>. Literally, May he whom thou incitest drive on the same chariot with riches. Comp. such expressions as rath&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> r&acirc;y&aacute;<I>h</I> and the like.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:7:1">1</A>. Comp. IV, 44, 2. yuv&oacute;<I>h</I> v&aacute;pu<I>h</I> abh&iacute; p<I>r&iacute;</I>ksha<I>h</I> sa<I>k</I>ante; VII, 90, 5.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:7:2">2</A>. Comp. I, 26, 10, note 1.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:7:3">3</A>. Ludwig: nicht unter unsern freunden ward auszf&uuml;ndig gemacht die kraftspeise. Grassmann: nicht bei Verwandten ward uns Nahrung sichtbar. Wilson: Our food is not partaken of by our kinsmen. Griffith: Not by our brethren was our food discovered.&#8212;Ludwig and Grassmann translate as if the text had <I>g</I>&acirc;m&iacute;shu. What the</p>  
<p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></A></p>  
<p>instrumental means is shown, I believe, for instance, by IV, 14, 2. v&iacute; s&ucirc;&acute;rya<I>h</I> ra<I>s</I>m&iacute;bhi<I>h</I> <I>k</I>&eacute;kit&acirc;na<I>h</I>, 'the sun shining with his rays.' Thus in our passage the poet seems to me to say, 'We have no strong kinsmen who might add lustre to our strength. Agni, procure thou strength to us.' Comp. X, 23, 7. vidm&aacute; h&iacute; te pr&aacute;matim deva <I>g</I>&acirc;miv&aacute;t, 'for we know, O god, thy providing care like that of a kinsman.'&#8212;Prof. Max M&uuml;ller proposes the translation: 'Our wealth is not known by our kinsmen, i.&nbsp;e. we cannot support them as we ought.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:8:1">1</A>. The poet returns here to the myth of which he had spoken in verse 5. Should the order of the verses be changed?&#8212;On our verse, compare Geldner, Ved. Studien, II, 34.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:8:2">2</A>. T&eacute;<I>g</I>as seems to be here a synonym of r&eacute;tas, as in the later language.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:8:3">3</A>. Is the lord of men Agni? See the third P&acirc;da.&#8212;Ish&eacute; I consider, with Geldner, as an infinitive.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:8:4">4</A>. My translation rests on the supposition that dya&ucirc;<I>h</I> is to he corrected into dy&oacute;<I>h</I>; thus the ablative is obtained, of which the word abh&icirc;&acute;ke is usually accompanied (comp. Lanman, 433; Collitz, Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, X, 15). If we leave the reading dya&uacute;<I>h</I>, this nominative will be the subject of the verb &acirc;&acute;na<I>t</I>. Then t&eacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I> must be accusative dependent on &acirc;&acute;na<I>t</I>, and we can scarcely avoid making n<I>ri</I>p&aacute;tim to depend on the infinitive ish&eacute;. This is the way which Geldner has followed in interpreting this passage. But I cannot consider this separation of n<I>ri</I>p&aacute;tim from the verb &acirc;&acute;na<I>t</I> very probable.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:8:5">5</A>. The exact meaning of <I>g</I>anayat seems to be here, 'he caused them to be born.' Comp. <I>S</I>atapatha Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a I, 7, 4, 4. yath&acirc; tad dev&acirc; reta<I>h</I> pr&acirc;<I>g</I>anayan (comp. Aitareya Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a III, 34; see also Rig-veda X, 61, 7).</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:8:6">6</A>. This may be the host of the seven <I>Ri</I>shis. Comp. III, 31, 1&#8211;5; IV, 1, 12 seq. (?). Or the Maruts are alluded to (comp. below, 72, 4), though that seems to me less probable.</p>  
<p><a name="page_81"><font size="1" color="green">p. 81</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:9:1">1</A>. Literally, in one day. But sady&aacute;<I>h</I> has already in the Rig-veda the secondary meaning 'immediately, quickly.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:9:2">2</A>. Comp. III, 56, 7. r&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>&acirc;n&acirc; mitr&acirc;&acute;-v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>&acirc; sup&acirc;<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute;.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:10:1">1</A>. Comp. VII, 18, 2: there the words abh&iacute; vid&uacute;<I>h</I> kav&iacute;<I>h</I> s&aacute;n are identical with our text.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:71:10:2">2</A>. Of the second hemistich Prof. Collitz has treated in Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, X, 15, note. He paraphrases the meaning in the following way: 'Der Sinn des ganzen Verses ist: unsere Freundschaft mit dir, Agni, stammt aus alter Zeit.

I do not believe that this interpretation, though very ingenious, gives the real meaning of the Vedic poet.&#8212;Comp.
