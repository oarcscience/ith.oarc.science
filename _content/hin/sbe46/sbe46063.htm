<p>1. They have worshipped Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara with his broad stream of light with prayers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:1:1">1</A> and treasures in order that he may walk on firm ground. For immortal Agni honours the gods, and from of old he has not violated the laws.</p>  
<p>2. The wonderful messenger goes between the two worlds (heaven and earth), the Hot<I>ri</I> who has sat down, the Purohita of Manus. He takes care of his wide dwelling day by day, Agni who, incited by the gods, gives wealth for our prayers.</p>  
<p>3. The priests have exalted with their thoughts Agni, the banner of sacrifices, the achiever of sacrifice&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:3:1">1</A>. From him in whom they have put together their (sacrificial) works and their prayers, the sacrificer desires blessings.</p>  
<p>4. The father of sacrifices, the miraculous lord of those who know prayers (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:1">1</A>, Agni, is the measure and rule&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:4:2">2</A> of the sacrificers; he has entered the two manifold-shaped worlds; the sage beloved by many people is glorified in his foundations.</p>  
<p>5. The gods have established here in great beauty Agni the bright with his bright chariot, whose every law is golden&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:5:1">1</A>, Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara who dwells in the waters, who finds the sun, the diver, the swift one covered with strength, the quick one.</p>  
<p>6. Agni, spreading out with his thought the manifold-adorned sacrifice, together with the gods and</p>  
<p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></A></p>  
<p>with the people of Manus, goes as a charioteer to and fro with (gods and men) who accomplish the sacrifice, the quick, domestic (god), the dispeller of curses.</p>  
<p>7. Agni, be wakeful&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:7:1">1</A> in our life which may be blessed with offspring; swell with sap; shine upon us (plenty of) food. Stir up vigour and the great ones, O watchful (god). Thou art the U<I>s</I>i<I>g</I> (or willing one) of the gods, the good-minded (lord) of prayers.</p>  
<p>8. The lord of the tribe, the vigorous&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:8:1">1</A> guest, the guider of prayers, the U<I>s</I>i<I>g</I> (or willing one) of those who invoke him, <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, the light of worship&#8212;him men constantly praise with adoration, with solicitations for their welfare.</p>  
<p>9. The resplendent, joyous god, Agni on his chariot, has with his might encompassed the dwellings. May we honour in our house with beautiful prayers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:9:1">1</A> his commands who is rich in manifold prosperity.</p>  
<p>10. O Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara, I love thy statutes by which thou hast found the sun, O far-seeing one. When born thou hast filled the worlds, heaven and earth; Agni, thou encompassest all these (beings) by thyself.</p>  
<p>11. For Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara's wonderful deeds he the sage alone has by his great skill mightily&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46063.htm#an_3:3:11:1">1</A> let loose (his powers?). Agni has been born exalting. both his parents, Heaven and Earth, rich in seed.</p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre.&#8212;Verse 10 = MS. IV, 11, 1. Verse 11 = TS. I, 5, 11, 1.</p>  
<p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:1:1">1</A>. A meaning like 'prayer' seems to recommend itself for most of the passages in which the substantive v&iacute;p occurs, for instance, V, 68, 1. pr&aacute; va<I>h</I> mitr&acirc;&acute;ya g&acirc;yata v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>&acirc;ya v&iacute;p gir&acirc;&acute;; IX, 22, 3. et&eacute; p&ucirc;t&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> vipa<I>s</I><I>k</I>&iacute;ta<I>h</I> s&oacute;m&acirc;sa<I>h</I> &#8230; v&iacute;p&acirc;&acute; v&iacute; &acirc;&acute;na<I>s</I>u<I>h</I> dh&iacute;ya<I>h</I>; IX, 65, 12. ay&acirc;&acute; <I>k</I>itt&aacute;<I>h</I> v&iacute;p&acirc;&acute; an&aacute;y&acirc; h&aacute;ri<I>h</I> pavasva dh&acirc;&acute;ray&acirc;; III, 10, 5 (see below), &amp;c. As the verb vip means 'to be in trembling agitation,' the same word as a substantive may designate enthusiastic thoughts or prayers. Comp. v&eacute;pate mat&icirc;&acute;, IX, 71, 3; X, II, 6, and the nouns v&iacute;pra, vipa<I>s</I><I>k</I>&iacute;t, vipodh&acirc;&acute;. We need not enter here upon the question, whether some concrete trembling or shaking objects also were designated as v&iacute;pa<I>h</I>, and whether Bergaigne (Religion V&eacute;dique, I, p. vii) is right in taking the v&iacute;p &aacute;ya<I>h</I>-agr&acirc;, with which Trita killed the boar (X, 99, 6), as a 'pri&egrave;re &agrave; pointe de fer' (comp. Macdonell, Journ. R. Asiatic Society, 1893, p. 431; 1895, p. 185).&#8212;In our verse v&iacute;pa<I>h</I> may be either nominative or accusative. I have translated it as an accusative; in the case of the nominative the translation would be: 'The prayers have worshipped Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara with treasures.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:3:1">1</A>. The text has vid&aacute;thasya.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:4:1">1</A>. &Aacute;sura<I>h</I> vipa<I>h</I>-<I>k</I>&iacute;t&acirc;m. On the meaning of &aacute;sura, which implies the possession of secret, supernatural power, see H.&nbsp;O., Religion des Veda, 162 seq.&#8212;Comp. von Bradke, Dy&acirc;us Asura, pp. 64&#8211;65.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:4:2">2</A>. 'Richtschnur und Weg der Opferer,' Pischel, Vedische Studien, I, 306.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:5:1">1</A>. Literally, 'whose rules are yellow.' The meaning is that Agni's whole sphere of activity bears the golden</p>  
<p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="green">p. 235</font></A></p>  
<p>yellow colour. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a gives the interesting remark 'haritva<I>k</I>am iti <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;ntaram,' but no doubt h&aacute;rivratam is right.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:7:1">1</A>. Comp. Neisser, Bezzenberger's Beitr&auml;ge, XIII, 297.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:9:1">1</A>. Comp. II, 4, 1, note 1.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_3:3:11:1">1</A>. Prof. Max M&uuml;ller proposes to translate, 'has sent forth his great song,' and observes, 'Might not b<I>ri</I>hat be like b<I>ri</I>hat s&acirc;&acute;ma, a name of a hymn?'</p>
