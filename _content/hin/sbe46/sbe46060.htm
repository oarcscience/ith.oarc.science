<p>1. Agni is to be invoked as the first like a father, when he has been inflamed by Manus&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:1">1</A> in the abode of I<I>d</I>&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:1:2">2</A>. When he has invested himself with beauty, the wise immortal, he, the glorious strong (horse) is to be smoothed (by the worshippers as by grooms).</p>  
<p>2. Agni with bright splendour, mayest thou hear my call with all my prayers, thou a wise immortal. The two tawny (horses) draw thy chariot or the two red (horses), or He the wide-ranging one has made the two ruddy (horses draw his chariot)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:2:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>3. They have generated the well-born (Agni) in her who lies on her back&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:1">1</A>. Agni became a germ in the manifoldly-adorned (wives)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:2">2</A>. Even in the &#8230;&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:3">3</A> the wise one dwells by night uncovered in his powers&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:3:4">4</A>.</p>  
<p>4. I besprinkle with my offering, with Gh<I>ri</I>ta, Agni who abides turned towards all beings, who widely extends throughout, who is mighty in his vigour, who shows himself most capacious by the food (which he consumes), and robust&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:4:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>5. I besprinkle Him who is turned towards (us) from all sides; may he gladly accept that with his benevolent mind. Agni, who is like a beautiful youth, who has the appearance of one eagerly striving, is not to be touched, when he hurries around with his body.</p>  
<p>6. Mayst thou know the portion (belonging to thee), being strong through thy desire. With thee as our messenger may we speak like Manu. Gaining</p>

<p>wealth&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46060.htm#an_2:10:6:1">1</A> I invoke with my (sacrificial) ladle, with my eloquence, the faultless Agni who mixes the honey-drink.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">NOTES.</h3>  
<p>The same <I>Ri</I>shi and metre. On the position of this hymn in the collection and its division into T<I>ri</I><I>k</I>as, see the note on II, 9.&#8212;Verses 4&#8211;5 = VS. XI, 23&#8211;24; TS. IV, 1, 2, 4. 5; MS. II, 7, 2.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:10:1:2">2</A>. &Iacute;<I>d</I> is a synonym of &iacute;<I>d</I>&acirc;; i<I>l</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> pad&eacute; means the same as &iacute;<I>l</I>&acirc;y&acirc;<I>h</I> pad&eacute;.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:10:2:1">1</A>. I cannot accept Prof. Lanman's scansion of this P&acirc;da (Noun-Inflection, 342), ut&aacute; arush&acirc;&acute;ha <I>k</I>akre v&iacute;bh<I>ri</I>tra<I>h</I>. In my opinion the only reading in conformity with the use of Vedic poets is ut&acirc;&acute;rush&acirc;&acute; &aacute;ha, &amp;c.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_2:10:3:1">1</A>. Comp. III, 29, 3 (see below). Of course the kindling-stick is alluded to.</p>
