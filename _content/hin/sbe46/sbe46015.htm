<p>1&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:1">1</A>. Thee who hidest thyself in secret like a thief with an animal&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:2">2</A> (which he has stolen)&#8212;who hadst harnessed&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:1:3">3</A> adoration and carriedst adoration&#8212;</p>  
<p>2. The wise unanimously followed by thy foot-marks&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:2:1">1</A>. All (gods) deserving worship (reverentially) sat down near thee.</p>  
<p>3. The gods followed the laws of <I>Ri</I>ta. There was an encompassing as the heaven (encompasses) the earth&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:3:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>4. In the lap, in the womb of <I>Ri</I>ta, the waters nourish the fine child with praise, him who is well born.</p>  
<p>5. Like good fortune, like a broad abode, like the fertile hill&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:5:1">1</A>, like the refreshing stream,</p>  
<p>6. Like a racer urged forward in the race, like the rapids of the Sindhu&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:6:1">1</A>&#8212;who can hold him back?</p>

<p>8. When he has spread through the forests, driven by the wind, Agni shears the hair of the earth.</p>  
<p>9. Sitting in the waters he hisses like a swan. (He is) most famous by his power of mind, he who belongs to the clans, awakening at dawn&#8212;</p>  
<p>10. A performer of worship like Soma, the god born from <I>Ri</I>ta, like a young (?)&nbsp;<A HREF="sbe46015.htm#an_1:65:10:1">1</A> beast, far-extending, far-shining.</p>

<p>The authorship of the whole collection, I, 65&#8211;73, is ascribed to Par&acirc;<I>s</I>ara <I>S</I>&acirc;ktya. These hymns are addressed exclusively to Agni. The greater part of them (65&#8211;70) is composed in the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> metre; comp. on this metre my Prolegomena, 95 seq. I have given there my reasons for considering that each verse consists of twenty, not of forty syllables.</p>  
<p>This section ascribed to Par&acirc;<I>s</I>ara has been treated of by Bollensen, Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XXII, 569 seq. No verse of these hymns composed in the metre Dvipad&acirc; Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> (I, 65&#8211;70) occurs in the other Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:1:1">1</A>. Professor Max M&uuml;ller proposes the following translation for verses 1 and 2: The wise (gods) together followed thee (Agni) when in hiding, by means of footsteps, as one follows a thief by the animal; they followed thee who accepts and carries adoration (to the gods). All the worshipful gods sat down (reverentially) near thee.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:1:2">2</A>. There is no reason for reading with Bartholomae (Studien zur indogermanischen Sprachgeschichte, I, 48) pa<I>s</I>v&acirc;&acute;n (gen. plur.) n&aacute; t&acirc;y&uacute;m.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:1:3">3</A>. Ludwig proposes yuv&acirc;n&aacute;m, which is quite unnecessary.&#8212;See also Gaedicke, 173.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:2:1">1</A>. We have here the well-known myth of the hidden Agni discovered by the gods. The 'wise ones,' (dh&icirc;&acute;r&acirc;<I>h</I>) are no doubt the searching gods, the same who are called y&aacute;<I>g</I>atr&acirc;<I>h</I> in the last P&acirc;da, and who are expressly designated as dev&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> in verse 3. Comp. Bergaigne, I, 110.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:3:1">1</A>. Regarding the construction, see Gaedicke, 192.&#8212;Professor Max M&uuml;ller's opinion on this phrase differs from</p>  
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p>  
<p>mine. He writes: 'I should prefer par&icirc;sh<I>t</I>i. But parish<I>t</I>i seems to mean a running about, reconnoitring, searching. "There was searching on earth as in heaven," lit. earth, like heaven, was reconnoitring-ground.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:5:1">1</A>. Comp. VIII, 50, 2. gir&iacute;<I>h</I> n&aacute; bhu<I>g</I>m&acirc;&acute;. I believe that Boehtlingk-Roth, Bollensen, and Grassmann are right in correcting our passage accordingly; ra<I>n</I>v&acirc;&acute;, p<I>ri</I>thv&icirc;&acute;, <I>s</I>ambh&uacute; follow the gender of the corresponding substantives, and the same may be expected here. Comp. Lanman, 530. The meaning is that Agni yields nourishment to all beings as a mountain fertilises the country by the waters which come down from it; comp. VIII, 49, 2. gir&eacute;<I>h</I> iva pr&aacute; r&aacute;s&acirc;<I>h</I> asya pinvire d&aacute;tr&acirc;<I>n</I>i puruba&oacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:6:1">1</A>. Regarding the construction, comp. Gaedicke, 252 seq.; Bergaigne, M&eacute;langes Renier, 95. Joh. Schmidt (Die Pluralbildungen der indogerm. Neutra, 305) and Ludwig (V, 524) are wrong in taking ksh&oacute;da<I>h</I> as a locative or as an instrumental respectively.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:7:1">1</A>. Comp. Pischel-Geldner, Vedische Studien, I, p. xvi.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:65:10:1">1</A>. Can <I>s</I>&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc; be the nominative of a stem <I>s</I>&iacute;<I>s</I>van which stands by the side of <I>s</I>&iacute;<I>s</I>u as <I>r&iacute;</I>bhvan of <I>ri</I>bh&uacute;? Prof. Max M&uuml;ller proposes: 'Large like a cow with young, like a pregnant cow.'</p>
