### MA*ND*ALA IV, HYMN 1.

#### ASH*T*AKA III, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 12–15.

1\. Thee, O Agni, the gods concordantly have ever set to work as their
divine steward; with this intention [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:1) they
have set thee to work. They have generated [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:2)
thee, O worshipful one [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:2), the immortal among
the mortals, the wise, god-loving god; they have generated every wise,
god-loving (Agni) [3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:1:3).

2\. Do thou, \[O Agni [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:1),\] turn to brother
Varu*n*a, towards the gods [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:2) with thy
kindness [3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:2:3), to (Varu*n*a) who accepts the
sacrifice, to the eldest (god) who accepts the sacrifice, the righteous
Âditya who supports the (human) tribes, the king who supports the
(human) tribes.

3\. O friend, turn to thy friend (Varu*n*a), as a wheel of a
chariot [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:3:1) rapidly (follows) the swift
(horse), for our sake, O wonderful one, rapidly. O Agni, find mercy (for
us) with Varu*n*a, with the all-brilliant Maruts. Bless (us), O flaming
one, that we may propagate ourselves, that we may press onward; bless
us, O wonderful one!

4\. Mayst thou, O Agni, who knowest Varu*n*a, deprecate for us the god's
anger. Being the best sacrificer, the best carrier (of the gods),
flaming, remove from us all hatred.

5\. As such, O Agni, be for us the lowest  [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:5:1)
(god) with thy help, our nearest (friend) while this dawn shines forth.
Being liberal (towards us), cause, by sacrificing, Varu*n*a to go away
from us. Love mercy; readily hear our call.

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

6\. His, the fortunate god's, appearance is excellent, and most
brilliant among mortals. Like the bright, heated butter of the cow (the
appearance) of the god is lovely, like the bountifulness of a milch-cow.

7\. Three [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:7:1) are those highest, true, and
lovely births of this god Agni. Being enveloped in the
infinite [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:7:2) he has come hither, the bright,
brilliant, shining Aryan.

8\. He, the messenger, longs for all seats, the Hot*ri* with the golden
chariot, with the lovely tongue, with the red horses, of marvellous
appearance, brilliant, always lovely like an assembly abundant in food.

9\. He, the kinsman of sacrifice, has enlightened
men [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:9:1). They lead him forward by a great
rope [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:9:2). He dwells in his (the mortal's)
dwelling, accomplishing (his task). The god has obtained the
companionship of the mortal.

10\. May this Agni, the knowing one, lead us to the god-given treasure
which belongs to him [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:10:1). That (treasure)
which all the immortals have created by their thought, which Dyaus, the
father, the begetter (has created): that real (treasure) they have
besprinkled [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:10:2).

11\. He has been born in the dwellings as the first, at the bottom of
the great (air) [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:1), in the womb of this
air [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:2), footless, headless, hiding both his
ends, drawing towards himself (his limbs?), in the nest of the
bull [3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:11:3).

12\. The host [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:1) came forth wonderfully at
first, in the womb of *Ri*ta, in the nest of the
bull [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:2), lovely and young, of marvellous
appearance, and brilliant [3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:3). Seven
friends [4](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:12:4) were born for the bull.

13\. Here our human fathers have sat down [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:1),

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

aspiring after *Ri*ta [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:2). Invoking the
dawns [3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:13:3), they have driven out the milch-cows
which dwelt in the rock-stable, in the prison.

14\. Having rent the rock they cleaned themselves. Others around told
forth that (deed) of theirs. Taking … as an instrument
(?) [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:14:1), they sang
triumphantly [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:14:2). They found the light; they
chanted their prayers.

15\. Longing for the cows in their mind, those men, the
U*s*i*g*s [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:15:1), have opened with godly words
the fast-holding, closed rock, which enclosed and encompassed the cows,
the firm stable full of cows.

16\. They have devised the first name of the milch-cow; they have found
the three times seven highest (names or essences) of the
mother [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:1). The
hosts [2](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:2), understanding this, acclaimed. The
red one [3](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:3) became visible through the
brilliant (milk?) [4](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:16:4) of the cow.

17\. The confused [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:17:1) darkness disappeared;
the sky appeared in splendour; the shine of the goddess Dawn rose up.
The Sun ascended to the wide plains, beholding right and wrong deeds
among the mortals.

18\. Then, afterwards, being awoke they looked around; then they took
that treasure given by Heaven, all the gods in all the houses. O Mitra,
may true (fulfilment) belong to (our) prayer, O Varu*n*a!

19\. I will address flaming Agni, the Hot*ri*, the supporter of
everything [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:19:1), the best sacrificer. He has
perforated, as it were, the pure udder of the cows, (and has made flow
the milk) purified like the poured sap of the Soma shoots.

20\. He, the Aditi (i. e. the freedom) of all the

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

worshipful gods, the guest [1](sbe46090.htm#an_4:1:20:1) of all men,
Agni, choosing (for us) the protection of all gods—may he, *G*âtavedas,
be merciful.

#### NOTES.

The *Ri*shi is Vâmadeva, the metre Trish*t*ubh, except in verses 1–3,
the metres of which are Ash*t*i, Ati*g*agatî, and Dh*ri*ti
respectively.—Verses 4–5 = VS. XXI, 3–4; TS. II, 5, 12, 3; IV, 2, 11, 3;
TB. III, 7, 11, 3; 12, 6; TÂ. II, 4, 4; IV, 20, 3; MS. IV, 10, 4; 14,
17. Verse 20 = VS. XXXIII, 16; TB. II, 7, 12, 5.—The hymn has been
translated and commented upon by Bergaigne, Quarante Hymnes du Rig-véda,
p. 11 seq.

This Sûkta seems to be composed of two independent hymns. Grassmann
believed that the first three verses are the fragment of one hymn, and
that verses 4–20 form a second hymn. His reason was that verses 1–3 are
composed in metres similar to Atyash*t*i, while the rest are composed in
Trish*t*ubh. I think that he was on the right way, but his opinion
should be slightly modified. In verses 1–5 Agni is invoked to appease
the anger of Varu*n*a; while, on the other hand, no allusion to Varu*n*a
occurs in verses 6–20. I believe, therefore, that the first hymn should
be considered as consisting of verses 1–5; it is composed in the metres
of the Atyash*t*i class (1–3) with two concluding Trish*t*ubh verses (4,
5). The second hymn comprises the verses 6–20. The arrangers of the
Sa*m*hitâ, however, considered these two hymns as one, as is shown by
the position which they have assigned to it, before the second Sûkta,
which has the same number of verses (20) as this first Sûkta. Comp. my
Prolegomena, p. 141.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_4:1:1:1">1</span>. I. e. with the intention that he
should act as the steward of the gods. As to íti krátvâ, comp. I, 138,
3. íti

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

krátvâ bubhu*g*riré. Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 530, paraphrases
íti krátvâ: mit Entschluss 'so sei es.'

Note <span id="an_4:1:1:2">2</span>. Sâya*n*a, whom Ludwig follows,
seems to be right in explaining ya*g*ata as a vocative ('ya*g*anîya'),
and *g*anata as 3rd plural ('a*g*anayan'). Bergaigne takes both forms as
2nd plural imperative: 'honorez l’immortel chez les mortels; engendrez
le Dieu qui honore les Dieux.'

Note <span id="an_4:1:1:3">3</span>. I cannot believe that Bergaigne is
right in translating ví*s*vam â´devam, 'celui qui honore tous les
Dieux.' His theory is that ví*s*vam dépend … de â´, qui logiquement
gouverne le terme devá à l’accusatif.'

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_4:1:2:1">1</span>. The metre shows, as Benfey (Vedica
und Verwandtes, p. 19, note 1) has pointed out, that this vocative agne
is a spurious addition.

Note <span id="an_4:1:2:2">2</span>. Should we not read devám? 'Turn to
brother Varu*n*a with thy kindness, towards the god who accepts the
sacrifice.'

Note <span id="an_4:1:2:3">3</span>. Or 'for the sake of his kindness,'
'for winning his favour (for the mortals)'? Sumatî´ may be dative; see
Lanman, p. 382; Brugmann, Grundriss der vergleichenden Grammatik, II, p.
602. Comp. I, 186, 10. á*kkh*â sumnâ´ya vav*ri*tîya devâ´n, 'may I turn
to the gods for the sake of their favour.'

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_4:1:3:1">1</span>. I believe that ráthyeva
(Padapâ*th*a ráthyâ-iva) stands for ráthyam-iva. Comp. Lanman, p. 331;
Roth, Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft, XLVIII,
p. 681 seq. Prof. Max Müller refers ráthyâ-iva to two horses; he
translates: 'O friend, bring hither thy friend, as two swift
chariot-horses bring rapidly a swift wheel.'

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_4:1:5:1">1</span>. I. e. the nearest to men.

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_4:1:7:1">1</span>. Literally 'thrice.' But I think
that we should correct trî´ ('three'). The same blunder seems to occur
in III, 56, 5. trî´ sadhásthâ sindhava*h* trí*h* (read trî´) kavînâ´m,
'Three are your abodes. O rivers; three (are those) of the sages.' Comp.
also III, 56, 8; I, 116, 4.

Note <span id="an_4:1:7:2">2</span>. This seems to mean, in the infinite
sky.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_4:1:9:1">1</span>. Mánusha*h* seems to be acc. plur.;
comp. VII, 86, 7. á*k*etayat a*k*íta*h*, 'he has enlightened the
unenlightened ones.' Bergaigne takes mánusha*h* as a genitive depending
on ya*gñ*ábandhu*h*, 'fils du sacrifice de Manus.'

Note <span id="an_4:1:9:2">2</span>. Bergaigne compares IX, 87, 1, where
it is said that they lead Soma to the sacrificial grass like a horse by
ropes (á*kkh*â barhí*h* ra*s*anâ´bhi*h* nayanti). Sâya*n*a says,
stutirûpayâ ra*gg*vâ, 'by a rope which has the shape of praises.'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_4:1:10:1">1</span>. Comp. below, verse 18.

Note <span id="an_4:1:10:2">2</span>. I. e. anointed, adorned. 'Poured
down.' M. M.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_4:1:11:1">1</span>. Mahá*h* budhné seems to mean,
mahá*h* rá*g*asa*h* budhné; comp. rá*g*asa*h* budhnám, I, 52, 6; budhné
rá*g*asa*h*, II, 2, 3; mahá*h* rá*g*asa*h*, I, 6, 10; rá*g*asa*h*
mahá*h*, I, 168, 6; mahî´ rá*g*asî, IX, 68, 3.

Note <span id="an_4:1:11:2">2</span>. With the second Pâda, compare IV,
17, 14. tva*k*á*h* budhné rá*g*asa*h* asya yónau.

Note <span id="an_4:1:11:3">3</span>. The bull seems to be Agni himself.
Comp. verse 12.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_4:1:12:1">1</span>. The word *s*árdha (or *s*árdha*h*?
see note 3), which in most passages is applied to the host of the Maruts
(see vol. xxxii, p. 67 seq.), seems here to refer to the company of the
Aṅgiras or seven *Ri*shis, alluded to in the fourth

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pâda. The seven
*Ri*shis, 'our fathers' (verse 13), have, with the aid of Agni, rent the
mountain and delivered the cows or dawns (verses 13 seqq.; IV, 2, 15
seq.). Comp. H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 145 seq.

Note <span id="an_4:1:12:2">2</span>. The bull again seems to be Agni.
Comp. verse 11, note 3.

Note <span id="an_4:1:12:3">3</span>. Do these epithets (comp. verse 8,
Pâda 3) refer to the sárdha (host)? Or are they applied to Agni, so that
we would have to translate: 'Lovely was the young one (Agni), of
marvellous appearance, and brilliant'? In this way Bergaigne interprets
the passage. If this translation is right, *s*árdha*h* may be considered
as neuter, and the first Pâda could be translated: The first host came
forth wonderfully.

Note <span id="an_4:1:12:4">4</span>. Evidently the seven *Ri*shis (see
note 1). Bergaigne: Les sept prières? ou les sept rivières?

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_4:1:13:1">1</span>. The seven *Ri*shis sat down for
chanting and sacrificing, by which they have opened the mountain-prison
of the cows.

Note <span id="an_4:1:13:2">2</span>. The mention of *Ri*ta in this
connection is both Vedic and Avestic. Comp. Darmesteter, Ormazd et
Ahriman, p. 146; H. O., Religion des Veda, p. 144, note 2.

Note <span id="an_4:1:13:3">3</span>. The cows in this myth seem to be a
mythical representation of the dawns. Comp. M. M., Science of Language,
II, p. 584; H. O., Religion des Veda, pp. 147, 149 seq.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_4:1:14:1">1</span>. Pa*s*váyantra (comp.
*s*lókayantra, IX, 73, 6) is quite doubtful. Does there exist a stem
pa*s*va, meaning possibly, 'the herd of cattle'? And can we translate,
they who had their (battering-?) machines directed on the cow-herds'?
Or, 'holding the herds with their instruments (i. e. with the ropes used
for drawing the cows out of the cavern)'?—Prof. Max Müller suggests the
translation, 'the cattle-drivers,' and writes, 'Does it stand for
pa*s*u-yantrâsa*h*?

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Yantra seems the
same as yoktra, or something like it, cf. X, 94, 7, 8. Pa*s*uyantra
would be they who hold the ropes of the cattle, who drive them away.'
Bergaigne's translation, 'n’ayant rien (d’autre) pour conduire le
bétail' (pa*s*u-ayantra), and that of Roth ('die der Sperre ledigen
Thiere \[pa*s*va*h* ayantrâsa*h*\] erhoben ein Freudengeschrei,'
Zeitschr. der D. Morg. Gesellschaft, XLVIII, 678), do not carry
conviction, nor does a conjecture like pa*s*vâ´ yantâ´ra*h* ('the
leaders of the cattle together with the cattle itself shouted
triumphantly'), seem to furnish a satisfying solution of the difficulty.

Note <span id="an_4:1:14:2">2</span>. See Geldner, Vedische Studien, I,
120.

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_4:1:15:1">1</span>. On the U*s*i*g*s, compare
Bergaigne's Religion Védique, I, 57 seq.

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_4:1:16:1">1</span>. The mother seems again to be the
cow, or more exactly the Dawn considered as the mother of the cows
(mâtâ´ gávâm, IV, 52, 2. 3; VII, 77, 2), and as the mother of the
*Ri*shis (IV, 2, 15). Comp. V, 45, 2. â´ ûrvâ´t gávâm mâtâ´ *g*ânatî´
gat. The seven names of the cow are mentioned also in I, 164, 3, its
three times seven names, in VII, 87, 4.

Note <span id="an_4:1:16:2">2</span>. Bergaigne (Quarante Hymnes, p. 14)
and Pischel (Ved. Studien, II, 121 seq.) give to the word vrâ the
meaning 'woman' (Bergaigne: 'femme,' particulièrement 'femme en rut,'
'femme amoureuse'). I prefer to follow the opinion of Bechtel,
Nachrichten der Göttinger Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften,
philolog.-historische Klasse, 1894, p. 393 seq. The hosts seem to be the
assembly of the *Ri*shis.

Note <span id="an_4:1:16:3">3</span>. The dawn.

Note <span id="an_4:1:16:4">4</span>. Comp. IX, 81, 1 (H. O., Religion
des Veda, p. 147, note 1). dadhnâ´ yát îm únnîtâ*h* ya*s*ásâ gávâm,
'When (the Somas) have been drawn, together with the brilliant curds of
the cow.' The brilliant milk of the cow which the

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Ri*shis have
obtained, seems to be considered as a magical means for procuring to men
the aspect of the brilliant light of the dawn. Comp. H. O., Religion des
Veda, p. 450.

##### Verse 17.

Note <span id="an_4:1:17:1">1</span>. On dúdhitam, comp. Geldner, Ved.
Studien, II, 9, and see Rig-veda II, 17, 4; IV, 16, 4.

##### Verse 19.

Note <span id="an_4:1:19:1">1</span>. Comp. vol. xxxii, p. 330 (V, 54,
10, note 1).

##### Verse 20.

Note <span id="an_4:1:20:1">1</span>. 'Guest' is átithi*h*; the play on
words (áditi*h* and átithi*h*) is untranslatable.
