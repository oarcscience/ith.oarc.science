<p>1. Garu&#7693;a said: Tell me, O Ke&#347;ava, by what sins particular signs are produced, and to what sorts of birth such sins lead?</p>  
<p>2. The Blessed Lord said: The sins on account of which the sinful returning from hell come to particular births, and the signs produced by particular sins,--these hear from me.</p>  
<p>3. The murderer of a Br&#257;hma&#7751; becomes consumptive, the killer of a cow becomes hump-backed and imbecile, the murderer of a virgin becomes leprous,--all three born as outcastes.</p>  
<p>4. The slayer of a woman and the destroyer of embryos becomes a savage full of diseases; who commits illicit intercourse, a eunuch; who goes with his teacher's wife, diseased-skinned.</p>  
<p>5. The eater of flesh becomes very red; the drinker of intoxicants, one with discoloured teeth; the Br&#257;hma&#7751; who, on account of greed, eats what should not be eaten, becomes big-bellied.</p>  
<p>6. He who eats sweet foods, without giving to others, becomes swollen-necked; who gives impure food at a &#346;r&#257;ddha ceremony is born a spotted leper.</p>  
<p>7. The man who, through pride, insults his teacher, becomes an</p>  
<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></A></p>  
<p>epileptic; who despises the Vedas and the &#346;&#257;stras certainly becomes jaundiced.</p>  
<p>8. Who bears false witness becomes dumb; who breaks the meal-row&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_55"></A><A HREF="#fn_54"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> becomes one-eyed; who interferes with marriage becomes lipless; who steals a book-is born blind.</p>  
<p>9. Who strikes a cow or a Br&#257;hma&#7751; with his foot is born lame and deformed; who speaks lies becomes a stammerer, and who listens to them becomes deaf.</p>  
<p>10. A poisoner becomes insane; an incendiary becomes bald; who sells flesh becomes unlucky; who eats fled of other beings becomes diseased.</p>  
<p>11. Who steals jewels is born in a low caste; who steals gold gets diseased nails; who steals any metal becomes poverty-stricken.</p>  
<p>12. Who steals food becomes a rat; who steals grain becomes a locust; who steals water becomes a Ch&#257;taka-bird&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_56"></A><A HREF="#fn_55"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and who steals poison, a scorpion.</p>  
<p>13. Who steals vegetables and leaves becomes a peacock; perfumes, a musk-rat; honey, a gad-fly; flesh, a vulture; and salt, an ant.</p>  
<p>14. Who steals betel, fruits and flowers becomes a forest-monkey; who steal shoes, grass and cotton are born from sheeps' wombs.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></A></p>  
<p>15. Who lives by violence, who robs caravans on the road, and who is fond of hunting, certainly becomes a goat in a butcher's house.</p>  
<p>16. Who dies by drinking poison becomes a black serpent on a mountain; whose feature is unrestrained becomes an elephant in a desolate forest.</p>  
<p>17. Those twice-born who do not make offering to the World-deities, and who eat all foods without consideration, become tigers in a desolate forest.</p>  
<p>18. The Br&#257;hmi&#7751; who does not recite the G&#257;yatr&#299;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_56"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, who does not meditate at twilight, who is inwardly wicked while outwardly pious, becomes a crane.</p>  
<p>19. The Br&#257;hmi&#7751; who officiates for one unfit to perform sacrifice becomes a village hog, and by too many sacrifices he becomes an ass; by eating without grace, a crow.</p>  
<p>20. The twice-born who does not impart learning to the deserving becomes a bull; the pupil who does not serve his teacher becomes an animal,--an ass or a cow.</p>  
<p>21. Who threatens and spits at his teacher, or browbeats a Br&#257;hma&#7751;, is born as a Br&#257;hmi&#7751;-fiend in a waterless wilderness.</p>  
<p>22. Who does not give to a twice-born according to his promise becomes a jackal; who is not hospitable to the goody becomes a howling Fire-face.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_57"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="green">p. 41</font></A></p>  
<p>23. Who deceives a friend becomes a mountain-vulture; who cheats in selling, an owl; who speaks ill of caste and order is born a pigeon in a wood.</p>  
<p>24. Who destroys hopes and who destroys affection, who through dislike abandons his wife, becomes a ruddy goose for a long time.</p>  
<p>25. Who hates mother, father and teacher, who quarrels with sister and brother, is destroyed when an embryo in the womb, even for a thousand births.</p>  
<p>26. The woman who abuses her mother-in-law and father-in-law, and causes constant quarrels; becomes a leech; and she who scolds her husband becomes a louse.</p>  
<p>27. Who, abandoning her own husband, runs after another man, becomes a flying-fox, a house-lizard, or a kind of female serpent.</p>  
<p>28. He who cuts off his lineage, by embracing a woman of his own family, having become a hyena and a porcupine, is born from the womb of a bear.</p>  
<p>29. The lustful man who goes with a female ascetic becomes a desert fiend; who consorts with an immature girl becomes a huge snake in a wood.</p>  
<p>30. Who covets his teacher's wife, becomes a chameleon; who goes with the king's wife becomes corrupt; and with his friend's wife, a donkey.</p>  
<p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></A></p>  
<p>31. Who commits unnatural vice becomes a village pig; who consorts with a &#346;&#363;dra woman becomes bull; who is passionate becomes a lustful horse.</p>  
<p>32-33. Who feeds upon the eleventh-day offerings to the dead is born a dog. The devalaka is born from the womb of a hen.</p>  
<p>The wretch among twice-born who worships the deities for the sake of wealth is called a devalaka and is unfit to offer oblations to ale deities and forefathers.</p>  
<p>34. Those who are very sinful, having passed through dreadful hells produced by their great sins, are born here upon the exhaustion of their karma.</p>  
<p>35. The murderer of a Br&#257;hma&#7751; goes into the womb of an ass, a camel and a she-buffalo; a drinker of intoxicants enters the wombs of a wolf, a dog and a jackal.</p>  
<p>36. The stealer of gold attains the condition of a worm, an insect and a bird. Who goes with his teacher's wife, goes to the condition of grass, bushes and plants.</p>  
<p>37. Who steals another's wife, who misappropriates deposits, who robs a Br&#257;hmi&#7751;, is born as a Br&#257;hmi&#7751;-fiend.</p>  
<p><a name="page_43"><font size="1" color="green">p. 43</font></A></p>  
<p>38-40. The Br&#257;hmi&#7751;'s possessions acquired by deception, enjoyed even in friendship, afflict the family even for seven generations,--and by forcible robbery even as long as the moon and stars exist:</p>  
<p>A man may digest even iron filings, powdered stone, and poison; but where is the person in the three worlds who can digest a Br&#257;hmi&#7751;'s wealth!</p>  
<p>Chariots and troops supported by the wealth of a Br&#257;hmi&#7751; crumble away in battle like artificial river-banks of sand.</p>  
<p>41-43. By appropriating temple property, by taking a Br&#257;hmi&#7751;'s possessions, and by neglecting Br&#257;hmi&#7751;s, families become broken up.</p>  
<p>He is called a neglector who, instead of making a gift to one who is well-read in the Vedas and &#346;&#257;stras and has resorted to him, gives it to some other,</p>  
<p>But it is no neglect if the Br&#257;hmi&#7751; is without Veda-knowledge; it would be like offering to ashes instead of to the blazing fire near by.</p>  
<p>44. Having neglected, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya, and having experienced the results in the successive hells, he is born blind and in poverty, becoming not a giver but a beggar.</p>  
<p>45. Who takes away a plot of land, which was given by himself for another, is born for sixty thousand years as a worm in excrement.</p>  
<p>46. The sinner who takes back by force what has been given by himself, goes into hell until the coming of the deluge.</p>  
<p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="green">p. 44</font></A></p>  
<p>47. Having given the means of subsistence and a piece of land, he should then protect it firmly. Who does not protect, but robs, is born as a lame dog.</p>  
<p>48. Who gives the means of support to Br&#257;hmi&#7751;s obtains fruit equal to that of a lakh of cows; who robs Br&#257;hmi&#7751;s of their means of sup port becomes an ape, a dog and a monkey.</p>  
<p>49. These and other signs and births, O Lord of Birds, are seen to be the karma of the embodied, made by themselves in this world.</p>  
<p>50. Thus the makers of bad karma, having experienced the tortures mf hell, are born with the residues of their sins, in these stated forms.</p>  
<p>51. Then, obtaining for thousands of lives the bodies of animals, they suffer from carrying burdens and other miseries.</p>  
<p>52. Having experienced as a bird the misery of cold, rain and heat, he afterwards reaches the human state, when the good and evil are balanced.</p>  
<p>53. Man and woman having come together, he becomes an embryo in due course. Having suffered the miseries from conception onwards to death, he again dies.</p>  
<p>54. Birth and death are the lot of all embodied beings; thus turns the wheel in the four kingdoms of beings.</p>  
<p>55. As the wheel of time turns, so mortals revolve by my magic. They revolve at one time of earth, at another in hell, held fast by the noose of karma.</p>  
<p><a name="page_45"><font size="1" color="green">p. 45</font></A></p>  
<p>56. He who does not mike gifts becomes poverty--stricken and through poverty he commits sin; by the force of sin he goes to hell, and is again born in poverty and again becomes sinful.</p>  
<p>57. Karma which has been made, whether good or evil, must inevitably be suffered. Karma not suffered does not fade away even in tens of millions of ages.</p>
