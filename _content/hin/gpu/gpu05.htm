<p>1. Garu&#7693;a said: What are the torments like that the sinful suffers, having passed along the way of Yama into the abode of Yama? Tell me this, O Ke&#347;ava.</p>  
<p>2. The Blessed Lord said: Listen, O Descendant of Vinat&#257;. I will tell it to you from the beginning to the end. Even at the description of hell you will tremble.</p>  
<p>3. Four and forty yojanas, O K&#257;&#347;yapa, beyond the city of Bahubh&#299;ti, lies the great city of the King of Justice.</p>  
<p>4-5. The sinful man cries when he hears the mingled wails of 'Oh, Oh,' and having heard his cry, those who walk about in the city of Yama.</p>  
<p>All go to the door-keeper and report it to him. The doorkeeper Dharmadhwaja, always stands there.</p>  
<p>6. He, having gone to Chitragupta,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_28"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> reports the good and evil deeds. Then Chitragupta tells it to the King of Justice.</p>  
<p>7. The men who are Deniers, O T&#257;rkshya, and always delight in great sin; these are all, as is proper, well-known to the King of Justice.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A></p>  
<p>8. <A HREF="errata.htm#2">Nevertheless</A>, he asks Chitragupta about their sins. Chitragupta, although he is all-knowing, enquires of the &#346;rava&#7751;as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_30"></A><A HREF="#fn_29"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>9. The &#346;rava&#7751;as are the sons of Br&#257;hma&#7751; who wander in heaven, on earth, and in the nether regions, hear and understand at a distance, and see a long way off.</p>  
<p>10. Their wives have a similar nature, and are called, distinctively, Sravan&#299;s. They know accurately all that is done by women.</p>  
<p>11. These report to Chitragupta everything that is said and done, openly and secretly, by men.</p>  
<p>12. These followers of the King of Justice know accurately all the virtues and vices of mankind, and the karma born of mind, speech and body.</p>  
<p>13. Such is the power of these, who have authority over mortals and immortals. Thus do these truth-speaking &#346;rava&#7751;as relate the actions of man.</p>  
<p>14. To the man who pleases them by austerity, charity and truthful speech, they become benevolent, granting heaven and liberation.</p>  
<p>15. Knowing the wicked actions of the sinful, those truth-speakers, relating them before the King of Justice, become dispensers of misery.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A></p>  
<p>16. The sun and moon, fire, wind, sky, earth and water, the heart. Yama, day and night, the two twilights, and Justice--know the actions of man.</p>  
<p>17 The King of Justice, Chitragupta, &#346;rava&#7751;as, the sun <A HREF="errata.htm#3">and</A> others see fully the sins and merits of the embodied being.</p>  
<p>18. Then Yama, having assured himself concerning the sins of the sinful, summons them and shows them his own very terrible form.</p>  
<p>19-21. Very sinful people behold the terrifying form of Yama--huge of body, rod in hand, seated on a buffalo,</p>  
<p>Roaring like a cloud at the time of pralaya, like a mountain of lampblack, terrible with weapons gleaming like lightning, possessing thirty-two arms,</p>  
<p>Extending three yojanas, with eyes like wells, with mouth gaping with formidable fangs, with red eyes and a long nose.</p>  
<p>22. Even Chitragupta is fearful, attended by Death, Fever and others. Near to him are all the messengers, resembling Yama, roaring.</p>  
<p>23. Having seen him, the wretch, overcome with fear, cries 'Oh, Oh.' The sinful soul who made no gifts trembles and cries again.</p>  
<p>24. Then, by command of Yama, Chitragupta speaks to all those sinners, who are crying, and bewailing their karmas.</p>  
<p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></A></p>  
<p>25. 'O, you sinners, evil-doers, polluted with egoism, injudicious, why ever did you commit sin?</p>  
<p>26. 'O, you foolish people, why ever did you commit that misery-giving sin which is born of lust, anger and association with the sinful.</p>  
<p>27 'Hitherto you have committed sins with great delight, and thereby are now destined for torment. It is no use turning your faces away.</p>  
<p>28. 'The sinful actions done by you are very many, and those sins are the cause of unavoidable misery.</p>  
<p>29. 'It is known that Yama deals equally with the fool and the learned, the <A HREF="errata.htm#4">beggar</A> and the wealthy, the strong and the weak.'</p>  
<p>30. Hearing these words of Chitragupta, the sinful then grieve over their karmas, and remain silent and motionless.</p>  
<p>31. The King of Justice, seeing them standing motionless like thieves, has fitting punishment ordered for the sinful.</p>  
<p>32. Then the cruel messengers, having beaten them, say, 'Go along, you sinner, to the very dreadful terrifying hells.'</p>  
<p>33. The messengers, Pracha&#7751;&#7693;a, Cha&#7751;&#7693;aka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and others, executors of the sentences of Yama, having bound them with one noose, lead them towards the hells.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A></p>  
<p>34. There is one big tree there, glowing like a blazing fire. It covers five yojanas and is one yojana in height.</p>  
<p>35. Having bound them on the tree by chains, head downwards, they beat them. They, for whom there is no rescuer, cry, burning there.</p>  
<p>36. Many sinful ones are hung on that silk-cotton tree, exhausted by hunger and thirst, and beaten by the messengers of Yama.</p>  
<p>37. 'Oh, forgive my faults'--with suppliant hands, those most. sinful people, helpless, implore the messengers.</p>  
<p>31. Again and again they are forcibly struck, by the messengers, with metal rods, with hammers, with iron clubs, with spears, with maces and with big pestles.</p>  
<p>39-40. Thus beaten they become still, swooning away. Then, seeing them quiet, the servants address them thus:</p>  
<p>'O, you sinners, you evildoers, <A HREF="errata.htm#5">why ever</A> did you commit such wicked deeds? You did not even make the easy water and food offerings at all.</p>  
<p>41. 'You did not give even halt a mouthful of food to the dog or the crows, nor honour your guests, nor make the water-offering to the forefathers.</p>  
<p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></A></p>  
<p>42. You did not meditate well upon Yama and Chitragupta, nor repeat their mantra, along with which torment cannot exist.</p>  
<p>43. You never visited any places of pilgrimage, nor worshipped the deities. Though living as a householder you did not even express compassion.</p>  
<p>44. 'You did not do any acts of service. Suffer the fruits of your own sin! Because you are devoid of righteousness you deserve to be beaten.</p>  
<p>45. 'Forgiveness of faults is done by the Lord Hari&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_32"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> &#298;&#347;wara. We only punish miscreants, as we are ordered.'</p>  
<p>46. Thus having spoken the messengers heat them mercilessly; and on account of the beating they fall down like glowing charcoal.</p>  
<p>47. In falling their limbs are cut by the sharp leaves, and they cry, fallen down and bitten by dogs.</p>  
<p>48. Then the mouths of those who are crying are filled with dust by the messengers; and, being bound with various nooses some are beaten with hammers.</p>  
<p>49. Some of the sinful are cut with saws, like firewood, and others thrown flat on the ground, are chopped into pieces with axes.</p>  
<p>50. Some, their bodies half-buried in a pit, are pierced in the head with arrows. Others, fixed in the middle of a machine, are squeezed like sugar-cane.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A></p>  
<p>51. Some are surrounded closely with blazing charcoal, enwrapped with torches, and smelted like a lump of ore.</p>  
<p>52. Some are plunged into heated butter, and others into heated oil, and like a cake thrown into the frying-pan they are turned about.</p>  
<p>53. Some are thrown in the way, in front of huge maddened elephants, and some with hands and feet bound are placed head downwards.</p>  
<p>54. Some are thrown into wells; some are hurled from heights; others plunged into pits full of worms, are eaten away by them.</p>  
<p>55. By the hard beaks of huge flesh-eating crows and vultures they are pecked in the head, eyes and faces.</p>  
<p>56. Others clamour: 'Give up, give up my wealth, which you owe me. In the world of Yama I see my wealth being enjoyed by you.'</p>  
<p>57. Thus disputing, the sinful, in the hell-region, are given pieces of flesh torn off with pincers by the messengers.</p>  
<p>58. Thus quarrelling, they are taken hold of by the messengers, by order of Yama, and thrown into the dreadful hells, T&#257;misra and others,</p>  
<p>59. Hells full of great misery are there,--near to the tree,--in which there is great misery indescribable in words.</p>  
<p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></A></p>  
<p>60. There are eighty-four lakhs of hells, O Bird, the midst of which are twenty-one most dreadful of the dreadful.</p>  
<p>61-64. T&#257;misra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_33"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Loha&#347;a&#7751;ku,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Maharaurava&#347;&#257;lmal&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Raurava,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Ku&#7693;mala,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> K&#257;las&#363;traka,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> P&#363;tim&#7771;ittika,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>

<p>All formed of various afflictions and diseases of different classes, the various fruits of sin, and inhabited by multitudes of servants.</p>  
<p>65. The sinful fools, devoid of righteousness, Who have fallen into these, experience there, until the end of the age, the various torments of hell.</p>  
<p>66. Men and women suffer the torments of T&#257;misra, Andhat&#257;misra, Raurava and other hells, which are produced by secret association.</p>  
<p>67. Thus he who was holding a family or gratifying his belly, having given up both, and being departed, obtains appropriate fruit.</p>

<p>68. Having cast off his body, which was nourished at the expense of other creatures, he goes alone to hell, provisioned with the opposite of happiness.</p>  
<p>69. The man experiences in a foul hell what is ordained by his fate, like an invalid who has been robbed of his wealth, the support of his family.</p>  
<p>70: The individual, who was fond of supporting his family by unrighteous means alone, goes to Andhat&#257;misra, which is the place of uttermost darkness.</p>  
<p>71. Having experienced in due order the torments below, he comes here again, purified.</p>
