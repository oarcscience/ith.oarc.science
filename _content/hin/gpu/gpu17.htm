<p>1-2. Garu&#7693;a said: The righteous man having enjoyed heaven, is born in a stainless family. Now tell me how he is produced in the womb of the mother.</p>  
<p>I wish to hear what, in this body, the man of good deeds thinks. Tell me, O Treasure-house of Compassion!</p>  
<p>3-4. The Blessed. Lord said: You have asked well, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya. I will tell you that supreme secret, even by knowing which one becomes all-knowing.</p>  
<p>I will tell you the real nature of that body which possesses the attributes of the universal Egg,--the object of concentration of Yogins.</p>  
<p>5-6. Hear how the Yogins perform the meditation upon the six chakras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> within it, and likewise meditation upon the nature of Chit and &#256;nanda in the Brahmarandhra,</p>  
<p>And how he of good deeds is born in the house of the pure and prosperous. I will tell you also about the rites and observances of the parents.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></A></p>  
<p>7-10. After menstruation the women should be avoided for four days. Their face should not be seen during that time, lest sin should arise in the body.</p>  
<p>Having bathed, and washed her clothes, a woman becomes pure on the fourth day. From the seventh day she becomes fit to perform the rites of worship to the forefathers and the Shining Ones.</p>  
<p>During the seven days the embryo continues impure. Here the sons gradually enter during the eighth day.</p>  
<p>Sons are born on even nights, daughters on odd. Keeping away from, her during the first seven days, on even nights he enters.</p>  
<p>11-12. Sixteen nights are declared to be common for women.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> On the fourteenth night the seed remains there certainly.</p>  
<p>Then is produced the righteous son, a store of auspicious qualities. That night is never obtained by vulgar people.</p>  
<p>13. On the firth. day women should eat sweet foods. Pungent, acid, astringent and hot things should be entirely avoided.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></A></p>  
<p>14-18. The husband, like a husbandman, having sown the seed of great potentiality in the field which is productive of grain, reaps a good harvest.</p>  
<p>The man, having chewed betel,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> put on flowers and sandal-paste, and clean clothes, and with righteous thoughts in his mind, should unite with his good wife.</p>  
<p>According to the thoughts in his mind at the time of union will be the nature of the one who enters the womb.</p>  
<p>The intelligence joined with the seed remains always in the sperm, When desire, thought and sperm become united,</p>  
<p>Then the man obtains semen, and in the interior of the womb the formation of ovum takes place, by the union of sperm and germ [cells]</p>  
<p>19. The good son who enters the womb is the giver of the highest bliss. For him there are numerous rites, such as the Punsavana.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20-23. The meritorious soul obtains birth in a high family. At the time of his birth Br&#257;hmi&#7751;s receive much wealth.</p>  
<p>He grows up in his parents' house, endowed with learning and modesty, becoming skilful in all the sciences, by association with the wise.</p>  
<p>In his youth he is divinely handsome, wealthy and benevolent, arising as the result of great merit, austerities, and pilgrimages to sacred waters, formerly done.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_144"><font size="1" color="green">p. 144</font></A></p>  
<p>Then he constantly strives to discriminate between the self and the not-self. By adhy&#257;ropa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and apav&#257;da&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he meditates upon Br&#257;hma&#7751;.</p>  
<p>24. For the understanding of the dissociation of Br&#257;hma&#7751; from that with which he is associated, I will tell you the attributes of earth and the others, which are of the genus "Not-self."</p>  
<p>25-30. Earth, water, fire, air and ether--these are called the stable elements. This body is made up of the five elements.</p>  
<p>Skin, bones, nerves, hair and flesh,--these are the five attributes of earth, O Lord of birds, declared to you by me.</p>  
<p>Saliva, urine, sperm, marrow, and blood, the fifth,--are said to be the five attributes of water. Now hear those of fire:--</p>  
<p>Hunger, thirst, sloth, sleep and sexual desire--are called the five attributes of fire by Yogins everywhere, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya.</p>  
<p>Bending, running, jumping, stretching and moving,--these are declared the five attributes of air.</p>  
<p>Speech, thought, vacuity, delusion and mental instability--the five attributes of ether, may be understood by you with effort.</p>  
<p>31. Mind, reason, individualisation, analysis--these four are called the Internal Means, and have the flavour of past karma.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="green">p. 145</font></A></p>  
<p>32. Ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose are the sense organs. The organs of speech, hands, feet, the organs of generation and of excretion are the organs of action.</p>  
<p>33. Dik, V&#257;ta, Arka, Prachetas, the two A&#347;vins, Vahni, Indra, Upeudra, Mitra, are declared to be the duties of the organs of sense and action,</p>  
<p>34-35. I&#7693;&#257;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Pingal&#257;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Su&#7779;umn&#257;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> thirdly, and also G&#257;ndh&#257;r&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Gajajihva,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> P&#363;&#7779;&#257;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> Ya&#347;asvin&#299;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>

<p>36-39. Pr&#257;&#7751;a, Ap&#257;na, Sam&#257;na, Ud&#257;na, and Vy&#257;na also,--N&#257;ga, K&#363;rma, K&#7771;ikala, Devadatta and Dhana&ntilde;jaya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A>:--</p>  
<p>In the heart, Pr&#257;&#7751;a; in the anus, Ap&#257;na; in the navel, Sam&#257;na; in the region of the throat, Ud&#257;na; and distributed all over the body, Vy&#257;na:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_146"><font size="1" color="green">p. 146</font></A></p>  
<p>Vomiting is called N&#257;ga; opening and shutting the eyes is known as K&#363;rma; the cause of hunger is to be known as K&#7771;ikala; Yawning, Devadatta;</p>  
<p>Dhana&ntilde;jaya, all-pervading, does not leave even the corpse, and carries all over the body the nourishment which is obtained by eating mouthfuls of food.</p>  
<p>40-43. The air called Vy&#257;na carries the essential part in all the N&#257;&#7693;&#299;s. Food, as soon as eaten, is split into two by that air.</p>  
<p>Having entered near the anus it separates the solid and liquid portions, placing the water over the fire, and the solid over the water,</p>  
<p>The Pr&#257;na standing under the fire, inflames it slowly. The fire, inflamed by the air, separates the substance from the waste.</p>  
<p>The Vy&#257;na air makes the essence go all over, and the waste, forced through the twelve gateways, is ejected from the body.</p>  
<p>44. Ears, eyes, nostrils, tongue, teeth, navel, nails, anus, generative organs, head, trunk, hair--are called unclean places.</p>  
<p>45. Thus the airs, having <A HREF="errata.htm#20">derived</A> their power from the self, perform their own functions, affecting people, just as does the rising of the sun.</p>  
<p>46. Now hear, O Bird, the two-fold nature of the body of man. One is Vy&#257;vah&#257;rika, and the second P&#257;ram&#257;rthika.</p>  
<p><a name="page_147"><font size="1" color="green">p. 147</font></A></p>  
<p>47-52. On the Vy&#257;vah&#257;rika there are thirty-five millions of hairs of the body, seven hundred thousands of hairs of the head, it is said, and twenty nails;</p>  
<p>There are said to be thirty-two teeth usually, O son of Vinat&#257;; the flesh is said to be one thousand <i>pal&#257;s</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and blood one hundred <i>pal&#257;s</i>;</p>  
<p>Fat is ten <i>pal&#257;s</i>; skin is seven <i>pal&#257;s</i>, marrow is twelve <i>pal&#257;s</i>; the "great blood" is three palas;</p>  
<p>Seed is known to be two <i>ku&#7693;avas</i>; ovum one <i>ku&#7693;ava</i>; and bones in the body are said to be three hundred and sixty;</p>  
<p>The <i>n&#257;&#7693;&#299;s</i>, both dense and subtle, number tens of million; bile is fifty <i>pal&#257;s</i>; phlegm is half of that;</p>  
<p>The waste materials are not measurable, as they are constantly changing. The body which possesses these attributes is Vy&#257;vah&#257;rika.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>53. All the worlds, mountains, continents, oceans, suns and planets are in the P&#257;ram&#257;rthika&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> body.</p>  
<p>54. In the P&#257;ram&#257;rthika body, there are six chakras in which are said to be located the attributes of the egg of Brahm&#257;.</p>  
<p>55. I will tell you about these, which are the objects of meditation of Yogins. By pondering upon them one becomes the enjoyer of the nature of Vair&#257;ja.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="green">p. 148</font></A></p>  
<p>56-59. Below the feet is called Atala; above the feet, Vitala; at the knees know it as Sutala; at the thighs Mah&#257;tala;</p>  
<p>At the hips, Tal&#257;tala; at the secret part Ras&#257;tala; at the loins P&#257;t&#257;la; these are declared to be the seven worlds:</p>  
<p>Bh&#363;loka, at the middle of the navel; above it the Bhuvarloka; in the heart, Svarloka; at the throat it should be known as Maharloka;</p>  
<p>Janaloka, in the region of the mouth; Tapolaka, at the forehead; Satyaloka in the Brahmarandhra--these are the fourteen worlds.</p>  
<p>60-61. Meru is situated in the triangle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; Mandara is in the inverted triangle; Kail&#257;&#347;a is in the right triangle; Him&#257;chala, in the left triangle.</p>  
<p>Ni&#7779;ada is in the upper lines Gandham&#257;dana in the lines on the right; Rama&#7751;a in the lines on the left;--the seven great mountains.</p>  
<p>62-65. Jambu is in the place of the bones; S&#257;ka is situated in the marrow; the Ku&#347;a continent is situated in the flesh; the Krauncha continent in the nerves;</p>  
<p>The &#346;&#257;lmal&#299; continent is in the skin; Gomeda, in the mass of hair; Pu&#7779;kara, in the place of the nails;--and next the oceans:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="green">p. 149</font></A></p>  
<p>In the urine the K&#7779;&#257;ra ocean; the K&#7779;&#299;ra ocean in the milk; the Sura ocean is situated in the phlegm; in the <A HREF="errata.htm#21">marrow</A>, the Gh&#7771;ita ocean;</p>  
<p>The Rasa ocean in the juices; the Dadhi ocean is known to be in the ova; the Sw&#257;du ocean in the region of the soft palate; you should know son of Vinat&#257;.</p>  
<p>66-68. The sun is situated in the N&#257;da chakra; the moon is in the Bindu chakra; Mars is situated, it should be known, in the eyes; Mercury is in the heart, it is declared;</p>  
<p>Jupiter is in the Vi&#7779;&#7751;u-sth&#257;na, it should be known; Venus is situated in the seed; Saturn is in the navel; R&#257;hu, in the face, it is declared;</p>  
<p>Ketu is situated in the lungs;--in the body is the circle of the planets. In all these forms one should meditate on his own body.</p>  
<p>69-71. Always at dawn, sitting steadily cross-legged, one should meditate upon the six chakras, in the order of the Ajap&#257;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The G&#257;yatr&#299; called Ajap&#257; is the giver of liberation to the sages; by merely thinking upon it one is released from all sin.</p>  
<p>Listen, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya, and I will explain the best method of Ajap&#257;, by doing which the individual always gives up his separateness.</p>  
<p>72-73. M&#363;l&#257;dh&#257;ra, Sw&#257;dhishth&#257;na, Ma&#7751;ip&#363;raka, An&#257;hatam, Vi&#347;uddhi and also &#256;j&ntilde;&#257;,--are spoken of as the six chakras.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="green">p. 150</font></A></p>  
<p>One should meditate in order upon the chakras, at the root of the generative organ; in the region of the pelvis; in the navel; in the heart; in the throat; between the eyebrows; at the top of the head.</p>  
<p>74-75. The m&#363;l&#257;dh&#257;ra is four-petalled and resplendent, with letters from va to sa; the Sv&#257;dhi&#7779;&#7789;h&#257;na resembles the sun, is six-petalled, and has the letters from ba to la; the Ma&#7751;ip&#363;raka is red in colour and has ten petals, from da to pha; the An&#257;hata is twelve-petalled, from ka to t&#7717;a, and is golden-coloured;</p>  
<p>The vi&#347;uddhi lotus is sixteen-petalled, with the vowels, and has the light of the moon; the M&#257;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> lotus is two-petalled, has the letters ha and k&#7779;a, and is red in colour; the one at the top of the head is the most resplendent, this lotus has a thousand petals, and is the seat of truth and bliss, ever auspicious, light-possessing and eternal.</p>  
<p>76. One should meditate, in order, in the chakras, on Ga&#7751;e&#7779;a, on Vidhi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on Vi&#7779;h&#7751;u, on &#346;iva, on J&#299;va, on Guru, and on Parambrahma&#7751;, all-pervading.</p>  
<p>17-80. It is said by the wise that the subtle movements of the breath in one day and night number twenty-one thousand six hundred.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="green">p. 151</font></A></p>  
<p>It goes out with the sound of "ha," and enters again with the sound of "sa." The individual is, indeed, always repeating the mantra. "Ha&#7745;sa, ha&#7745;sa,"--</p>  
<p>Six hundred for Ga&#7751;e&#347;a; six thousand for Vedhas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; six thousand for Hari&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; six thousand for Hara.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>A thousand for the J&#299;v&#257;tman; a thousand for Guru; a thousand or the Chid&#257;tman;--thus one should understand the respective numbers of the repetitions.</p>  
<p>81-82. Aru&#7751;a and other sages, who know the succession of Teachers, meditate upon the deities presiding over the chakras, who are rays of Brahma&#7751;.</p>  
<p>The sages, &#346;uka and ethers, teach it to their pupils; therefore a wise man, after meditating upon the path of the Great Ones, should always meditate thus.</p>  
<p>83. Having worshipped mentally in all the chakras, with unwavering mind, he should repeat the Ajap&#257;-g&#257;yatr&#299; according to the instructions of the Teacher.</p>  
<p>84-88. He should meditate in the Ran&#7693;hra, with the thousand-petalled lotus inverted, upon the Blessed Teacher within the Ha&#7745;sa, whose lotus-hand frees from fear.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="green">p. 152</font></A></p>  
<p>He should regard his body as being washed in the flow of nectar from His feet. Having worshipped in the five-fold way he should prostrate, singing His praise.</p>  
<p>Then he should meditate on the Ku&#7751;&#7693;alin&#299;, as moving upwards and downwards, as making a tour of the six chakras, placed in three-and-a-half coils.</p>  
<p>Then he should meditate on the place called Su&#7779;umn&#257;, which goes out of the Randhra; thereby he goes to the highest state of Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</p>  
<p>Then he should always meditate, between four o'clock and sunrise, on my form, self-illumined, eternal and ever-blissful.</p>  
<p>89. He should bring his mind to a state of steadiness, not by efforts alone, but under the instruction of a teacher, without whom he falls.</p>  
<p>90. Having done the inward-sacrifice he should perform the outward-sacrifice. Having done the purificatory ablution, and the Sandhy&#257;, he should worship Hari and Hara.</p>  
<p>91-94. For those who are attached to the body facing-inward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> does not come about. For then devotion is easier, and that gives liberation.</p>  
<p>Tapas, and Yoga, and others, are also ways to liberation, but for those who are attached to the world of change the path by devotion to me is far superior.</p>  
<p>This is the conclusion of the all-knowing Brahma and others, after having conned the Vedas and the &#346;&#257;stras for three periods.</p>  
<p>Sacrifices and other righteous duties purify the mind. The devotion to me has a form of fruit from which the obtainer never falls away.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="green">p. 153</font></A></p>  
<p>95. The good man who follows this, O T&#257;rk&#7779;ya, by the union due to devotion to me, goes to eternal liberation.</p>
