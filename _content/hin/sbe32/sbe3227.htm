<p>1. Let us now proclaim for the robust <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:1">1</A> host, for the herald <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:2">2</A> of the powerful (Indra), their ancient greatness! O ye strong-voiced Maruts, you heroes, prove your powers on your march, as with a torch, as with a sword <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:1:3">3</A>!</p>  
<p>2. Like parents bringing a dainty to <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:2:1">1</A> their own <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:2:2">2</A> son, the wild (Maruts) play playfully at the sacrifices. The Rudras reach the worshipper with their protection, strong in themselves, they do not fail the sacrificer.</p>  
<p>3. For him to whom the immortal guardians have given fulness of wealth, and who is himself a giver of oblations, the Maruts, who gladden men with the milk (of rain), pour out, like friends, many clouds.</p>  
<p>4. You who have stirred <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:1">1</A> up the clouds with might, your horses rushed <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:2">2</A> forth, self-guided. All beings who dwell in houses <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:4:3">3</A> are afraid of you, your march is brilliant with your spears thrust forth.</p>  
<p>5. When they whose march is terrible have caused the rocks to tremble <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:1">1</A>, or when the manly Maruts have shaken the back of heaven, then every lord of the forest fears at your racing, each shrub flies out of your way <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:2">2</A>, whirling like chariot-wheels <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:5:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>6. You, O terrible Maruts, whose ranks are never broken, favourably <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:1">1</A> fulfil our prayer <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:2">2</A>! Wherever your gory-toothed <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:3">3</A> lightning bites <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:4">4</A>, it crunches <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:5">5</A> cattle, like a well-aimed bolt <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:6:6">6</A>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></A></p>  
<p>7. The Maruts whose gifts are firm, whose bounties are never ceasing, who do not: revile <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:7:1">1</A>, and who are highly praised at the sacrifices, they sing their song <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:7:2">2</A> for to drink the sweet juice: they know the first manly deeds of the hero (Indra).</p>  
<p>8. The man whom you have guarded, O Maruts,&#8212;shield him with hundredfold strongholds from injury <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:8:1">1</A> and mischief,&#8212;the man whom you, O fearful, powerful singers, protect from reproach in the prosperity of his children.</p>  
<p>9. On your chariots, O Maruts, there are all good things, strong weapons <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:1">1</A> are piled up clashing against each other. When you are on your journeys, you carry the rings <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:2">2</A> on your shoulders, and your axle turns the two wheels at once <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:9:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p>10. In their manly arms there are many good things, on their chests golden chains <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:1">1</A>, flaring <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:2">2</A> ornaments, on their shoulders speckled deer-skins <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:3">3</A>, on their fellies sharp edges <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:10:4">4</A>; as birds spread their wings, they spread out splendours behind.</p>  
<p>11. They, mighty by might, all-powerful powers <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:1">1</A>, visible from afar like the heavens <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:2">2</A> with the stars, sweet-toned, soft-tongued singers with their mouths <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:11:3">3</A>, the Maruts, united with Indra, shout all around.</p>  
<p>12. This is your greatness <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:1">1</A> O well-born Maruts!&#8212;your bounty <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:3">3</A> extends far, as the sway <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:2">2</A> of Aditi <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:4">4</A>. Not even <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:5">5</A> Indra in his scorn <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:12:6">6</A> can injure that bounty, on whatever man you have bestowed it for his good deeds.</p>  
<p>13. This is your kinship (with us), O Maruts, that you, immortals, in former years have often protected the singer <A HREF="sbe3227.htm#an_1:166:13:1">1</A>. Having through this prayer granted a hearing to man, all these heroes together have become well-known by their valiant deeds.</p>  
<p><a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></A></p>  
<p>14. That we may long flourish, O Maruts, with your wealth, O ye racers, that our men may spread in the camp, therefore let me achieve the rite with these offerings.</p>  
<p>15. May this praise, O Maruts, this song of M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya, the son of M&acirc;na, the poet, ask you with food for offspring for ourselves! May we have an invigorating autumn, with quickening rain!</p>  
<p><a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>This hymn is ascribed to Agastya, the reputed son of Mitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>au, and brother of Vasish<I>th</I>a. The metre in verses 1-13 is <I>G</I>agat&icirc;, in 14, 15 Trish<I>t</I>ubh. No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:1:1">1</A>. Rabhas&aacute;, an adjective of r&aacute;bhas, and this again from the root rabh, to rush upon a thing, &acirc;-rabh, to begin a thing. From this root rabh we have the Latin robur, in the general sense of strength, while in rabies the original meaning of impetuous motion has been more clearly preserved. The Greek &#0955;&#0940;&#0946;&#0961;&#0959;&#0962;, too, as pointed out by Cowell, comes from this root. In the Vedic Sanskrit, derivatives from the root rabh convey the meaning both of quickness and of strength. Quickness in ancient languages frequently implies strength, and strength implies quickness, as we see, for instance, from the German sn&euml;l, which, from meaning originally strong, comes to mean in modern German quick, and quick only. The German bald again, meaning soon, comes from the Gothic balths, the English bold. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 145, 3. <I>s</I>&iacute;<I>s</I>u<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; adatta s&aacute;m r&aacute;bha<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The child (Agni) acquired vigour.</p>  
<p>Indra is called rabha<I>h</I>-d&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, giver of strength; and rabhas&aacute;, vigorous, is applied not only to the Maruts, who in V, 58, 5, are called r&aacute;bhish<I>th</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>, the most vigorous, but also to Agni, II, 10, 4, and to Indra, III, 31, 12.</p>  
<p>In the sense of rabid, furious, it occurs in</p>  
<p>X, 95, 14. &aacute;dha enam v<I>r&iacute;</I>k&acirc;<I>h</I> rabhas&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> ady&uacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May rabid wolves eat him!</p>  
<p>In the next verse rabhas&aacute;, the epithet of the wolves, is replaced by &aacute;<I>s</I>iva, which means unlucky, uncanny.</p>  
<p>In our hymn rabhas&aacute; occurs once more, and is applied there, in verse 10, to the a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&iacute; or glittering ornaments of the Maruts. Here S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a translates it by lovely, and it was most likely intended to convey the idea of lively or brilliant splendour, though it may mean also strong. See also IX, 96, 1.</p>  
<p><a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:1:2">2</A>. Ket&uacute;, derived from an old root ki, in Sanskrit <I>k</I>i, to perceive, from which also <I>k</I>itra, conspicuous, ken-speckled, beautiful, means originally that by which a thing is perceived or known, whether a sign, or a flag, or a herald. It is the Gothic haidu, species. It then takes the more general sense of light and splendour. In our passage, herald seems to me the most appropriate rendering, though B. and R. prefer the sense of banner. The Maruts come before Indra, they announce the arrival of Indra, they are the first of his army.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:1:3">3</A>. The real difficulty of our verse lies in the two comparisons aidh&acirc;&acute;-iva and yudh&acirc;&acute;-iva. Neither of them occurs again in the Rig-veda. B. and R. explain aidh&acirc;&acute; as an instrumental of a&iacute;dh, flaming, or flame, and derive it from the root idh, to kindle, with the preposition &acirc;. Professor Bollensen in his excellent article Zur Herstellung des Veda (Orient and Occident, vol. iii, p. 473) says: 'The analysis of the text given in the Pada, viz. aidh&acirc;&acute;-iva and yudh&acirc;&acute;-iva, is contrary to all sense. The common predicate is tavish&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i kartana, exercise your power, you roarers, i.&nbsp;e. blow as if you meant to kindle the fire on the altar, show your power as if you went to battle. We ought therefore to read aidh&eacute; va and yudh&eacute; | va. Both are infinitives, aidh is nothing but the root idh + &acirc;, to kindle, to light.' Now this is certainly a very ingenious explanation, but it rests on a supposition which I cannot consider as proved, viz. that in the Veda, as in P&acirc;li, the comparative particle iva may be changed, as shown in the preface to the first edition, to va. It must be admitted that the two short syllables of iva are occasionally counted in the Veda as one, but yudh&eacute;-iva, though it might become yudh&aacute; iva, would never in the Veda become yudh&eacute;va.</p>  
<p>As yudh&acirc;&acute; occurs frequently in the Veda, we may begin by admitting that the parallel form aidh must be explained in analogy to yudh&acirc;&acute;. Now y&uacute;dh is a verbal noun and means fighting. We have the accusative y&uacute;dham, I, 53, 7; the genitive yudh&aacute;<I>h</I>, VIII, 27, 17; the dative yudh&eacute;, I, 61, 13; the locative yudh&iacute;, I, 8, 3; the instrumental yudh&acirc;&acute;, I, 53, 7, &amp;c.; loc. plur. yut-s&uacute;, I, 91, 21. As long as y&uacute;dh</p>  
<p><a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></A></p>  
<p>retains the general predicative meaning of fighting, some of these cases may be called infinitives. But y&uacute;dh soon assumes not only the meaning of battle, battle-ground, but also of instrument of fighting, weapon. In another passage, X, 103, 2, y&uacute;dha<I>h</I> may be taken as a vocative plural, meaning fighters. Passages in which y&uacute;dh means clearly weapon, are, for instance,</p>  
<p>V, 52, 6. &acirc;&acute; rukma&iacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; yudh&acirc;&acute; n&aacute;ra<I>h</I> <I>ri</I>shv&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> <I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> as<I>ri</I>kshata.</p>  
<p>With their bright chains, with their weapon, the tall men have stretched forth the spears.</p>  
<p>X, 55, 8. p&icirc;tv&icirc;&acute; s&oacute;masya div&aacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; v<I>ri</I>dh&acirc;n&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&ucirc;&acute;ra<I>h</I> n&iacute;<I>h</I> yudh&acirc;&acute; adhamat d&aacute;sy&ucirc;n.</p>  
<p>The hero, growing, after drinking the Soma, blew away from the sky the enemies with his weapon. See also X, 103, 4.</p>  
<p>I therefore take y&uacute;dh in our passage also in the sense of weapon or sword, and, in accordance with this, I assign to a&iacute;dh the meaning of torch. Whether a&iacute;dh comes from idh with the preposition &acirc;, which, after all, would only give edh, or whether we have in the Sanskrit a&iacute;dh the same peculiar strengthening which this very root shows in Greek and Latin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>, would be difficult to decide. The torch of the Maruts is the lightning, the weapon the thunderbolt, and by both they manifest their strength; ferro et igne, as Ludwig remarks.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilson</span>: We proclaim eagerly, Maruts, your ancient greatness, for (the sake of inducing) your prompt appearance, as the indication of (the approach of) the showerer (of benefits). Loud-roaring and mighty Maruts, you exert your vigorous energies for the advance (to the sacrifice), as if it was to battle.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:2:1">1</A>. That &uacute;pa can be construed with the accusative is clear from many passages:</p>  
<p>III, 35, 2. &uacute;pa im&aacute;m ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m &acirc;&acute; vah&acirc;ta<I>h</I> &iacute;ndram.</p>  
<p>Bring Indra to this sacrifice!</p>  
<p>I, 25, 4. v&aacute;ya<I>h</I> n&aacute; vasat&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &uacute;pa.</p>  
<p>As birds (fly) to their nests.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:2:2">2</A>. N&iacute;tya, from ni + tya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_109"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>, means originally what is inside, internus, then what is one's own; and is opposed to n&iacute;sh<I>t</I>ya, from nis + tya, what is outside, strange, or hostile. N&iacute;tya has been well compared with ni<I>g</I>&aacute;, literally eingeboren, then, like n&iacute;tya, one's own. What is inside, or in a thing or place, is its own, is peculiar to it, does not move or change, and hence the secondary meanings of n&iacute;tya, one's own, unchanging, eternal. Thus we find n&iacute;tya used in the sense of internal or domestic:</p>  
<p>I, 73, 4. t&aacute;m tv&acirc; n&aacute;ra<I>h</I> d&aacute;me &acirc;&acute; n&iacute;tyam iddh&aacute;m &aacute;gne s&aacute;<I>k</I>anta kshit&iacute;shu dhruv&acirc;&acute;su.</p>  
<p>Our men worshipped thee, O Agni, lighted within the house in safe places.</p>  
<p>This I believe to be a more appropriate rendering than if we take n&iacute;tya in the sense of always, continuously lighted, or, as some propose, in the sense of eternal, everlasting.</p>  
<p>VII, 1, 2. daksh&acirc;&acute;yya<I>h</I> y&aacute;<I>h</I> d&aacute;me &acirc;&acute;sa n&iacute;tya<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Agni who is to be pleased within the house, i.&nbsp;e. as belonging to the house, and, in that sense, who is to be pleased always. Cf. I, 140, 7; 141, 2; X, 12, 2, and III, 25, 5, where n&iacute;tya<I>h</I>, however, may have been intended as an adjective belonging to the vocative s&ucirc;no.</p>  
<p>Most frequently n&iacute;tya occurs with s&ucirc;n&uacute;, I, 66, 1; 185, 2; t&aacute;naya, III, 15, 2; X, 39, 14; tok&aacute;, II, 2, 11; &acirc;p&iacute;, VII, 88, 6; p&aacute;ti, I, 71, 1, and has always the meaning of one's own, very much like the later Sanskrit ni<I>g</I>a, which never occurs in the Rig-veda, though it makes its appearance in the &Acirc;tharva<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>N&iacute;sh<I>t</I>ya, extraneus, occurs three times in the Rig-veda:</p>  
<p>VI, 75, 19. y&aacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> sv&aacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;ra<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> y&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>a n&iacute;sh<I>t</I>ya<I>h</I> <I>g</I>&iacute;gh&acirc;<I>m</I>sati.</p>  
<p>Whoever wishes to hurt us, our own friend or a stranger from without.</p>  
<p>X, 133, 5. y&aacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> indra abhi-d&acirc;&acute;sati s&aacute;-n&acirc;bhi<I>h</I> y&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>a n&iacute;sh<I>t</I>ya<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>He who infests us, O Indra, whether a relative or a stranger.</p>  
<p>VIII, I, 13. m&acirc;&acute; bh&ucirc;ma n&iacute;sh<I>t</I>y&acirc;<I>h</I>-iva &iacute;ndra tv&aacute;d &aacute;ra<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>-iva.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></A></p>  
<p>Let us not be like outsiders, O Indra, not like strangers to thee.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilson</span>: Ever accepting the sweet (libation), as (they would) a son, they sport playfully at sacrifices, demolishing (all intruders).</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Wie einen nicht absterbenden Sohn das Madhu bringend.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:4:1">1</A>. &Aacute;vyata, a Vedic second aorist of v&icirc; (a<I>g</I>), to stir up, to excite. From it pravaya<I>n</I>a, a goad, pra-vetar, a driver. The Greek &#0959;&#7990;-&#0963;-&#0964;&#0961;&#0959;&#0962;, gad-fly, has been referred to the same root. See Fick, W&ouml;rterbuch, p. 170.</p>  
<p>Roth (Wenzel, Instrumental, p. 54) translates: 'While you quickly throw yourselves into the mists;' from a verb vy&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:4:2">2</A>. Adhra<I>g</I>an, from dhra<I>g</I>, a root which, by metathesis of aspiration, would assume the form of dra<I>gh</I> or dragh. In Greek, the final medial aspirate being hardened, reacts on the initial media, and changes it to t, as b&acirc;hu becomes &#0960;&#8134;&#0967;&#0965;&#0962;, budh &#0960;&#0965;&#0952;, bandh, &#0960;&#0949;&#0957;&#0952;. This would give us &#0964;&#0961;&#0949;&#0967;, the Greek root for running, Goth. thrag-jan.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:4:3">3</A>. Harmy&aacute; is used here as an adjective of bh&uacute;vana, and can only mean living in houses. It does not, however, occur again in the same sense, though it occurs several times as a substantive, meaning house. Its original meaning is fire-pit, then hearth, then house, a transition of meaning analogous to that of aedes. Most of the ancient nations begin their kitchen with a fire-pit. &#8216;They dig a hole in the ground, take a piece of the animal's raw hide, and press it down with their hands close to the sides of the hole, which thus becomes a sort of pot or basin. This they fill with water, and they make a number of stones red-hot in a fire close by. The meat is put into the water, and the stones dropped in till the meat is boiled. Catlin describes the process as awkward and tedious, and says that since the Assinaboins had learnt from the Mandans to make pottery, and had been supplied with vessels by the traders, they had entirely done away the custom, &#8220;excepting at public festivals; where they seem, like all others of the human family, to take pleasure in cherishing and perpetuating</p>  
<p><a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></A></p>  
<p>their ancient customs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_110"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.&#8221;&#8217; This pit was called harmy&aacute;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_111"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A> or gharm&aacute;, which is the Latin formus. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>VII, 56, 16. t&eacute; harmye-sth&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&iacute;<I>s</I>ava<I>h</I> n&aacute; <I>s</I>ubhr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The Maruts bright like boys standing by the hearth.</p>  
<p>From meaning fire-pit, or hearth, harmy&aacute; afterwards takes the more general sense of house:</p>  
<p>VII, 55, 6. t&eacute;sh&acirc;m s&aacute;m hanma<I>h</I> aksh&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i y&aacute;th&acirc; id&aacute;m harmy&aacute;m t&aacute;th&acirc;.</p>  
<p>We shut their eyes as we shut this house (possibly, this oven).</p>  
<p>VII, 76, 2. prat&icirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;&acute; &acirc;&acute; ag&acirc;t &aacute;dhi harmy&eacute;bhya<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The dawn comes near, over the house-tops.</p>  
<p>X, 46, 3. <I>g</I>&acirc;t&aacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; harmy&eacute;shu.</p>  
<p>Agni, born in the houses.</p>  
<p>X, 73, 10. many&oacute;<I>h</I> iy&acirc;ya harmy&eacute;shu tasthau.</p>  
<p>He came from Manyu, he remained in the houses.</p>  
<p>In some of these passages harmy&aacute; might be taken in the sense of householder; but as harmy&aacute; in VII, 55, 6, has clearly the meaning of a building, it seems better not to assign to it unnecessarily any new significations.</p>  
<p>If harmya or *harma meant originally a fire-pit, then a hearth, a house, we see the close connection between harma and gharma, harmya and gharmya. Thus by the side of harmyesh<I>th</I>a we find gharmyesh<I>th</I>a (RV. X, 106, 5). We find gharma meaning, not only heat in general, but fire-pit, hearth; and we find the same word used for what we should call the pit, a place of torture and punishment from which the gods save their worshippers, or into which they throw the evil-doers.</p>

<p>When thou, Indra, hadst placed <I>S</I>ush<I>n</I>a, who was anxious to fight, in the darkness of the pit.</p>

<p>You, N&acirc;satyas, always grant your aid to Ka<I>n</I>va when thrown into the pit.</p>  
<p>This fiery pit into which Atri is thrown, and whence he, too, was saved by the A<I>s</I>vins, is likewise called gharm&aacute;, I, 112, 7; 119, 6; VIII, 73, 3; X, 80, 3.</p>

<p>When Yama is seated in the house, or in the nether world.</p>  
<p>When the Pitars, too, the spirits of the departed, the Manes, are called gharma-s&aacute;d, this is probably intended to mean, dwelling on the hearth (X, 15, 9 and 10), and not dwelling in the abode of Yama.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:5:1">1</A>. Nad certainly means to sound, and the causative might be translated by 'to make cry or shriek.' If we took p&aacute;rvata in the sense of cloud, we might translate, 'When you make the clouds roar;' if we took p&aacute;rvata for mountain, we might, with Professor Wilson, render the passage by 'When your brilliant coursers make the mountains echo.' But nad, like other roots which afterwards take the meaning of sounding, means originally to vibrate, to shake; and if we compare analogous passages where nad occurs, we shall see that in our verse, too, the Vedic poet undoubtedly meant nad to be taken in that sense:</p>  
<p>VIII, 20, 5. &aacute;<I>k</I>yut&acirc; <I>k</I>it va<I>h</I> &aacute;<I>g</I>man &acirc;&acute; n&acirc;&acute;nadati p&aacute;rvat&acirc;sa<I>h</I> v&aacute;nasp&aacute;ti<I>h</I>, bh&ucirc;&acute;mi<I>h</I> y&acirc;&acute;meshu re<I>g</I>ate.</p>  
<p>At your racing even things that are immovable vibrate, the rocks, the lord of the forest; the earth quivers on your ways. (See I, 37, 7, note I.) Grassmann here translates nad&aacute;yanta by ersch&uuml;ttern, but in VIII, 20, 5 by erdr&ouml;hnt.</p>

III, 1, 10), i.&nbsp;e. to behave like or to be like a chariot, whether the comparison is meant to express simply the quickness of chariots or the whirling of their wheels.

<p>Stretch out your arms with kindness to this worshipper! In one passage of the ninth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala (IX, 65, 30) we meet with su-<I>k</I>et&uacute;nam, as an accusative, referring to Soma, the gracious, and this would pre-suppose a substantive <I>k</I>et&uacute;na, which, however, does not exist.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:6:2">2</A>. Sumat&iacute; has, no doubt, in most passages in the Rig-veda, the meaning of favour, the favour of the gods. 'Let us obtain your favour, let us be in your favour,' are familiar expressions of the Vedic poets. But there are also numerous passages where that meaning is inapplicable, and</p>  
<p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></A></p>  
<p>where, as in our passage, we must translate sumat&iacute; by prayer or desire.</p>  
<p>In the following passages sumat&iacute; is clearly used in its original sense of favour, blessing, or even gift:</p>  
<p>I, 73, 6 (7). su-mat&iacute;m bh&iacute;ksham&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Begging for thy favour.</p>  
<p>I, 171, 1. su-ukt&eacute;na bhikshe su-mat&iacute;m tur&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>&acirc;m.</p>  
<p>With a hymn I beg for the favour of the quick Maruts.</p>  
<p>I, 114, 3. a<I>s</I>y&acirc;&acute;ma te su-mat&iacute;m.</p>  
<p>May we obtain thy favour! Cf. I, 114, 9:</p>

<p>I, 156, 3. mah&aacute;<I>h</I> te vish<I>n</I>o (&iacute;ti) su-mat&iacute;m bha<I>g</I>&acirc;mahe.</p>  
<p>May we, O Vish<I>n</I>u, enjoy the favour of thee, the mighty!</p>  
<p>Bhiksh, to beg, used above, is an old desiderative form of bha<I>g</I>, and means to wish to enjoy.</p>  
<p>III, 4, 1. su-mat&iacute;m r&acirc;si v&aacute;sva<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Thou grantest the favour of wealth.</p>

<p>The lighted fire went up for the favour of wealth. Cf. VII, 60, 11; IX, 97, 26.</p>

<p>Mayest thou, Vish<I>n</I>u, give thy favour, which is glorious among men!</p>  
<p>X, 11, 7. y&aacute;<I>h</I> te agne su-mat&iacute;m m&aacute;rta<I>h</I> &aacute;kshat.</p>

<p>May your favour, O A<I>s</I>vins, hasten towards us, like a cow!</p>  
<p>But this meaning is by no means the invariable meaning of sumat&iacute;, and it will easily be seen that, in the following</p>  
<p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></A></p>  
<p>passages, the word must be translated by prayer. Thus when Sarasvat&icirc; is called (I, 3, 11) <I>k</I>&eacute;tant&icirc; su-mat&icirc;n&acirc;&acute;m, this can only mean she who knows of the prayers, as before she is called <I>k</I>odayitr&icirc;&acute; s&ucirc;n<I>r&iacute;</I>t&acirc;n&acirc;m, she who excites songs of praise:</p>  
<p>I, 151, 7. &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a g&iacute;ra<I>h</I> su-mat&iacute;m gantam asma-y&ucirc;&acute; (&iacute;ti).</p>  
<p>Come towards the songs, towards the prayer, you who are longing for us. Cf. X, 20, 10.</p>  
<p>II, 43, 3. t&ucirc;sh<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute;m &acirc;&acute;s&icirc;na<I>h</I> su-mat&iacute;m <I>k</I>ikiddhi na<I>h</I>.</p>

<p>V, 1, 10. &acirc;&acute; bh&aacute;ndish<I>th</I>asya su-mat&iacute;m <I>k</I>ikiddhi.</p>  
<p>Take notice of the prayer of thy best praiser! Cf. V, 33, I.</p>  
<p>VII, 18, 4. &acirc;&acute; na<I>h</I> &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> su-mat&iacute;m gantu &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a.</p>  
<p>May Indra come to our prayer!</p>  
<p>VII, 31, 10. pr&aacute;-<I>k</I>etase pr&aacute; su-mat&iacute;m k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>udhvam.</p>  
<p>Make a prayer for the wise god!</p>  
<p>IX, 96, 2. su-mat&iacute;m y&acirc;ti &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a.</p>  
<p>He (Soma) goes near to the prayer.</p>

<p>Let us praise to-day the glorious A<I>s</I>vins with our prayers.</p>  
<p>IX, 74, 1. t&aacute;m &icirc;mahe su-mat&icirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>We implore him with prayer.</p>  
<p>In our passage the verb pipartana, fill or fulfil, indicates in what sense sumat&iacute; ought to be taken. Su-mat&iacute;m pipartana is no more than k&acirc;&acute;mam pipartana, fulfil our desire! See VII, 62, 3. &acirc;&acute; na<I>h</I> k&acirc;&acute;mam p&ucirc;purantu; I, 158, 2. k&acirc;mapr&eacute;<I>n</I>a-iva m&aacute;nas&acirc;. On sumn&aacute;, see Burnouf, &Eacute;tudes, p. 91, and Aufrecht, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 274.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:6:3">3</A>. Kr&iacute;vi<I>h</I>-dat&icirc; has been a crux to ancient and modern interpreters. It is mentioned as a difficult word in the Nigha<I>n</I><I>t</I>u, and all that Y&acirc;ska has to say is that it means possessed of cutting teeth (Nir. VI, 30. krivirdat&icirc; vikartanadant&icirc;). Professor Roth, in his note to this passage, says that krivi can never have the meaning of well, which is ascribed to it in the Nigha<I>n</I><I>t</I>u III, 23, but seems rather to mean an animal, perhaps the wild boar, &#0954;&#0940;&#0960;&#0961;&#0959;&#0962;, with metathesis of v and r. He translates our passage: 'Where</p>  
<p><a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></A></p>  
<p>your lightning with boar-teeth tears.' In his Dictionary, however, he only says, 'krivis, perhaps the name of an animal, and dant, tooth.' S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a contents himself with explaining kr&iacute;virdat&icirc; by vikshepa<I>n</I>a<I>s</I>&icirc;ladant&icirc;, having teeth that scatter about.</p>  
<p>My own translation is founded on the supposition that kr&iacute;vis, the first portion of kr&iacute;virdat&icirc;, has nothing to do with krivi, but is a dialectic variety of krav&iacute;s, raw flesh, the Greek &#0954;&#0961;&#8051;&#0945;&#0962;, Latin caro, cruor. It means what is raw, bloody, or gory. From it the adjective kr&ucirc;ra, horrible, cruentus (Curtius, Grundz&uuml;ge, p. 142; Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. ii, p. 235). A name of the goddess Durg&acirc; in later Sanskrit is kr&ucirc;radant&icirc;, and with a similar conception the lightning, I believe, is here called kr&iacute;virdat&icirc;, with gory teeth.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:6:4">4</A>. It should be observed that in r&aacute;dati the simile of the teeth of the lightning is carried on. For r&aacute;dati may be supposed to have had in the Veda, too, the original meaning of r&acirc;dere and r&ocirc;dere, to scratch, to gnaw. Rada and radana in the later Sanskrit mean tooth. It is curious, however, that there is no other passage in the Rig-veda where rad clearly means to bite. It means to cut, in</p>  
<p>I, 61, 12. g&oacute;<I>h</I> n&aacute; p&aacute;rva v&iacute; rada tira<I>s</I><I>k</I>&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Cut his joint through, as the joint of an ox.</p>  
<p>But in most passages where rad occurs in the Veda, it has the meaning of giving. It is not the same which we have in the Zend r&acirc;d, to give, and which Justi rightly identifies with the root r&acirc;dh. But rad, to divide, may, like the German theilen in zutheilen, have taken the meaning of giving. Greek &#0948;&#0945;&#0943;&#0969; means to divide, but yields &#0948;&#0945;&#0943;&#0962;, portion, meal, just as Sanskrit day, to divide, yields d&acirc;yas, share, i.&nbsp;e. inheritance.</p>  
<p>This meaning is evident in the following passages:</p>  
<p>VII, 79, 4. t&acirc;&acute;vat usha<I>h</I> r&acirc;&acute;dha<I>h</I> asm&aacute;bhyam r&acirc;sva y&acirc;&acute;vat stot<I>r&iacute;</I>-bhya<I>h</I> &aacute;rada<I>h</I> g<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;n&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Grant us, Ushas, so much wealth as thou hast given to the singers, when praised.</p>  
<p>I, 116, 7. kaksh&icirc;&acute;vate aradatam p&uacute;ram-dhim.</p>  
<p>You gave wisdom to Kaksh&icirc;vat.</p>  
<p>I, 169, 8. r&aacute;da mar&uacute;t-bhi<I>h</I> <I>s</I>ur&uacute;dha<I>h</I> g&oacute;-agr&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></A></p>  
<p>Give to the Maruts gifts, rich in cattle.</p>  
<p>VII, 62, 3. v&iacute; na<I>h</I> sah&aacute;sram <I>s</I>ur&uacute;dha<I>h</I> radantu.</p>  
<p>May they (the gods) give to us a thousand gifts!</p>  
<p>I, 117, 11. v&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>am v&iacute;pr&acirc;ya&#8212;r&aacute;dant&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Giving spoil to the sage!</p>  
<p>VI, 61, 6. r&aacute;da p&ucirc;sh&acirc;&acute;-iva na<I>h</I> san&iacute;m.</p>  
<p>Give us, Sarasvat&icirc;, wealth, like P&ucirc;shan!</p>  
<p>IX, 93, 4. rada &iacute;ndo (&iacute;ti) ray&iacute;m.</p>  
<p>Give us, O Indra, wealth!</p>  
<p>VII, 32, 18. rada-vaso (&iacute;ti).</p>  
<p>Indra, thou who givest wealth!</p>  
<p>In many passages, however, this verb rad is connected with words meaning way or path, and it then becomes a question whether it simply means to grant a way, or to cut a way open for some one. In Zend, too, the same idiom occurs, and Professor Justi explains it by 'prepare a way.' I subjoin the principal passages:</p>  
<p>VI, 30, 3. y&aacute;t &acirc;bhya<I>h</I> &aacute;rada<I>h</I> g&acirc;t&uacute;m indra.</p>  
<p>That thou hast cut a way for them (the rivers). Cf. VII, 74, 4.</p>  
<p>IV, 19, 2. pr&aacute; vartan&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> arada<I>h</I> vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;-dhen&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Thou (Indra) hast cut open the paths for all the cows.</p>  
<p>X, 75, 2. pr&aacute; te aradat v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> y&acirc;&acute;tave path&aacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Varu<I>n</I>a cut the paths for thee to go.</p>  
<p>VII, 87, 1. r&aacute;dat path&aacute;<I>h</I> v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> s&ucirc;&acute;ry&acirc;ya.</p>  
<p>Varu<I>n</I>a cut paths for S&ucirc;rya.</p>  
<p>V, 80, 3. path&aacute;<I>h</I> r&aacute;dant&icirc; suvit&acirc;&acute;ya dev&icirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>She, the dawn, cutting open the paths for welfare.</p>  
<p>VII, 60, 4. y&aacute;smai &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;dhvana<I>h</I> r&aacute;danti.</p>  
<p>For whom the &Acirc;dityas cut roads.</p>  
<p>II, 30, 2. path&aacute;<I>h</I> r&aacute;dant&icirc;<I>h</I>&#8212;dh&ucirc;naya<I>h</I> yanti &aacute;rtham.</p>  
<p>Cutting their paths, the rivers go to their goal.</p>  
<p>This last verse seems to show that the cutting open of a road is really the idea expressed by rad in all these passages. And thus we find the rivers themselves saying that Indra cut them out or delivered them:</p>  
<p>III, 33, 6. &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> asm&acirc;&acute;n aradat v&aacute;<I>g</I>ra-b&acirc;hu<I>h</I>. Cf. X, 89, 7.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:6:5">5</A>. Ri<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;ti, like the preceding expressions kr&iacute;virdat&icirc; and r&aacute;dati, is not chosen at random, for though it has the</p>  
<p><a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></A></p>  
<p>general meaning of crushing or destroying, it is used by the Vedic poets with special reference to the chewing or crunching by means of the teeth. For instance,</p>  
<p>I, 148, 4. pur&ucirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i dasm&aacute;<I>h</I> n&iacute; ri<I>n</I>&acirc;ti <I>g</I>&aacute;mbhai<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Agni crunches many things with his jaws.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:6:6">6</A>. S&uacute;dhit&acirc;-iva barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc;. I think the explanation of this phrase given by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a may be retained. He explains s&uacute;dhit&acirc; by suhit&acirc;, i.&nbsp;e. sush<I>th</I>u prerit&acirc;, well thrown, well levelled, and barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; by hatis, tats&acirc;dhan&acirc; hetir v&acirc;, a blow or its instrument, a weapon. Professor Roth takes barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; as an instrumental, used adverbially, in the sense of powerfully, but he does not explain in what sense s&uacute;dhit&acirc;-iva ought then to be taken. We cannot well refer it to didy&uacute;t, lightning, on account of the iva, which requires something that can form a simile of the lightning. Nor is su-dhit&acirc; ever used as a substantive so as to take the place of sv&aacute;dhit&icirc;va. S&uacute;-dhita has apparently many meanings, but they all centre in one common conception. S&uacute;-dhita means well placed, of a thing which is at rest, well arranged, well ordered, secure; or it means well sent, well thrown, of a thing which has been in motion. Applied to human beings, it means well disposed or kind.</p>

<p>As applied to &acirc;&acute;yus, life, s&uacute;dhita may be translated by well established, safe:</p>  
<p>II, 27, 10. a<I>s</I>y&acirc;&acute;ma &acirc;&acute;y&ucirc;<I>m</I>shi s&uacute;-dhit&acirc;ni p&ucirc;&acute;rv&acirc;.</p>

<p>That man dwells secure in his own house.</p>  
<p>Applied to a missile weapon, s&uacute;dhita may mean well placed, as it were, well shouldered, well held, before it is thrown; or well levelled, well aimed, when it is thrown:</p>  
<p>I, 167, 3. mimy&aacute;ksha y&eacute;shu s&uacute;-dhit&acirc;&#8212;<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>

<p>Thou, Indra, O hero, struckest both enemies, the barbarous and the Aryan fiends, like forests with well-aimed weapons.</p>  
<p>Applied to a poem, s&uacute;dhita means well arranged or perfect:</p>  
<p>I, 140, 11. id&aacute;m agne s&uacute;-dhitam d&uacute;<I>h</I>-dhit&acirc;t &aacute;dhi priy&acirc;&acute;t &ucirc;<I>m</I> (&iacute;ti) <I>k</I>it m&aacute;nmana<I>h</I> pr&eacute;ya<I>h</I> astu te.</p>  
<p>May this perfect prayer be more agreeable to thee than an imperfect one, though thou likest it.</p>  
<p>VII, 32, 13. m&aacute;ntram &aacute;kharvam s&uacute;-dhitam. A poem, not mean, well contrived.</p>  
<p>As applied to men, s&uacute;dhita means very much the same as hit&aacute;, well disposed, kind:</p>  
<p>IV, 6, 7. &aacute;dha mitr&aacute;<I>h</I> n&aacute; s&uacute;-dhita<I>h</I> p&acirc;vak&aacute;<I>h</I> agn&iacute;<I>h</I> d&icirc;d&acirc;ya m&acirc;&acute;nush&icirc;shu viksh&uacute;.</p>  
<p>Then, like a kind friend, Agni shone among the children of man.</p>  
<p>V, 3, 2. mitr&aacute;m s&uacute;-dhitam.</p>  
<p>VI, 15, 2. mitr&aacute;m n&aacute; y&aacute;m s&uacute;-dhitam.</p>

<p>X, 115, 7. mitr&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> n&aacute; y&eacute; s&uacute;-dhit&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>At last s&uacute;-dhita, without reference to human beings, takes the general sense of kind, good:</p>  
<p>III, 11, 8. p&aacute;ri v&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc;ni s&uacute;-dhit&acirc; agn&eacute;<I>h</I> a<I>s</I>y&acirc;ma m&aacute;nma-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May we obtain through our prayers all the goods of Agni.</p>  
<p>Here, however, pr&aacute;y&acirc;<I>m</I>si may have to be supplied, and in that case this passage, too, should be classed with those mentioned above, VIII, 60, 4, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>If then we consider that s&uacute;dhita, as applied to weapons, means well held or well aimed, we can hardly doubt that barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; is here, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a says, some kind of weapon. I should derive it from barhayati, to crush, which we have, for instance,</p>  
<p>I, 133, 5. pi<I>s</I>&aacute;&#7749;ga-bh<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>im ambhri<I>n</I>&aacute;m pis&acirc;&acute;<I>k</I>im indra s&aacute;m m<I>ri</I><I>n</I>a, s&aacute;rvam r&aacute;ksha<I>h</I> n&iacute; barhaya.</p>  
<p>Pound together the fearful Pi<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>i with his fiery weapons, strike down every Rakshas.</p>  
<p>II, 23, 8. b<I>r&iacute;</I>haspate deva-n&iacute;da<I>h</I> n&iacute; barhaya.</p>  
<p>B<I>ri</I>haspati strike down the scoffers of the gods. Cf. VI, 61, 3.</p>  
<p>Barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; would therefore mean a weapon intended to crush an enemy, a block of stone, it may be, or a heavy club, and in that sense barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; occurs at least once more:</p>  
<p>VIII, 63, 7. y&aacute;t p&acirc;&acute;<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a-<I>g</I>anyay&acirc; vi<I>s</I>&acirc;&acute; &iacute;ndre gh&oacute;sh&acirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;s<I>ri</I>kshata, &aacute;st<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;t barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; vip&aacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>When shouts have been sent up to Indra by the people of the five clans, then the club scattered the spears; or, then he scattered the spears with his club.</p>  
<p>In other passages Professor Roth is no doubt right when he assigns to barh&aacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; an adverbial meaning, but I do not think that this meaning would be appropriate in our verse. Grassmann also translates, 'ein wohlgezielter Pfeil.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:7:1">1</A>. Al&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I>, a word which occurs but once more, and which had evidently become unintelligible even at the</p>  
<p><a name="page_227"><font size="1" color="green">p. 227</font></A></p>  
<p>time of Y&acirc;ska. He (Nir. VI, 2) explains it by alam&acirc;tardano megha<I>h</I>, the cloud which opens easily. This, at least, is the translation given by Professor Roth, though not without hesitation. Alam&acirc;tardana<I>h</I>, as a compound, is explained by the commentator as &acirc;tardanapary&acirc;pta<I>h</I>, alam &acirc;tardayitum udakam, i.&nbsp;e. capable of letting off the water. But Devar&acirc;<I>g</I>aya<I>g</I>van explains it differently. He says: alam pary&acirc;ptam &acirc;tardanam hi<I>m</I>s&acirc; yasya, bah&ucirc;dakatv&acirc;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>abalo megho vi<I>s</I>eshyate, i.&nbsp;e. whose injuring is great; the dark cloud is so called because it contains much water. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a. too, attempts several explanations. In III, 30, 10, he seems to derive it from t<I>ri</I>h, to kill, not, like Y&acirc;ska, from t<I>ri</I>d, and he explains its meaning as the cloud which is exceedingly hurt by reason of its holding so much water. In our passage he explains it either as an&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>a, free from injury, or good hurters of enemies, or good givers of rewards.</p>  
<p>From all this I am afraid we gain nothing. Let us now see what modern commentators have proposed in order to discover an appropriate meaning in this word. Professor Roth suggests that the word may be derived from r&acirc;, to give, and the suffix t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>a, and the negative particle, thus meaning, one who does not give or yield anything. But, if so, how is this adjective applicable to the Maruts, who in this very verse are praised for their generosity? Langlois in our passage translates, 'heureux de nos louanges;' in III, 30, 10, qui laissait fl&eacute;trir les plantes.' Wilson in our passage translates, 'devoid of malevolence;' but in III, 30, 10, 'heavy.'</p>  
<p>I do not pretend to solve all these difficulties, but I may say this in defence of my own explanation that it fulfils the condition of being applicable both to the Maruts and to the demon Bala. The suffix t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>a is certainly irregular, and I should much prefer to write al&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>a, for in that case we might derive l&acirc;trin from l&acirc;tra, and to this l&acirc;tra, i.&nbsp;e. r&acirc;tra, I. should ascribe the sense of barking. The root rai or r&acirc; means to bark, and has been connected by Professor Aufrecht with Latin rire, inrire, and possibly inritare&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_112"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_228"><font size="1" color="green">p. 228</font></A></p>  
<p>thus showing a transition of meaning from barking, to provoking or attacking. The same root r&acirc; explains also the Latin l&acirc;trare, to bark, allatrare, to assail; and, whatever ancient etymologists may say to the contrary, the Latin latro, an assailer. The old derivation 'latrones eos antiqui dicebant, qui conducti militabant, &#7936;&#0960;&#8056; &#0964;&#8134;&#0962; &#0955;&#0945;&#0964;&#0961;&#0949;&#0943;&#0945;&#0962;,' seems to me one of those etymologies in which the scholars of Rome, who had learnt a little Greek, delighted as much as scholars who know a little Sanskrit delight in finding some plausible derivation for any Greek or Latin word in Sanskrit. I know that Curtius (Grundz&uuml;ge, p. 326) and Corssen (Kritische Nachtr&auml;ge, p. 239) take a different view; but a foreign word, derived from &#0955;&#0940;&#0964;&#0961;&#0959;&#0957;, pay, hire, would never have proved so fertile as latro has been in Latin.</p>  
<p>If then we could write al&acirc;tri<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I>, we should have an appropriate epithet of the Maruts, in the sense of not assailing or not reviling, in fact, free from malevolence, as Wilson translated the word, or rather S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's explanation of it, &acirc;tardanarahita. What gives me some confidence in this explanation is this, that it is equally applicable to the other passage where al&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>a occurs, III, 30, 10:</p>  
<p>al&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> val&aacute;<I>h</I> indra vra<I>g</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> g&oacute;<I>h</I> pur&acirc;&acute; h&aacute;nto<I>h</I> bh&aacute;yam&acirc;na<I>h</I> v&iacute; &acirc;ra.</p>  
<p>Without barking did Vala, the keeper of the cow, full of tear, open, before thou struckest him.</p>  
<p>If it should be objected that vra<I>g</I>&aacute; means always stable, and is not used again in the sense of keeper, one might reply that vra<I>g</I>&aacute;<I>h</I>, in the nom. sing., occurs in this one single passage only, and that bh&aacute;yam&acirc;na<I>h</I>, fearing, clearly implies a personification. Otherwise, one might translate: 'Vala was quiet, O Indra, and the stable of the cow came open, full of fear, before thou struckest.' The meaning of al&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&aacute; would remain the same, the not-barking being here used as a sign that Indra's enemy was cowed, and no longer inclined to revile or defy the power of Indra.

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:8:1">1</A>. Abh&iacute;-hruti seems to have the meaning of assault, injury, insult. It occurs but once, but abh&iacute;-hrut, a feminine substantive with the same meaning, occurs several times. The verb hru, which is not mentioned in the Dh&acirc;tup&acirc;<I>th</I>a, but has been identified with hvar, occurs in our hymn, verse 12:</p>  
<p>I, 128, 5. s&aacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> tr&acirc;sate du<I>h</I>-it&acirc;&acute;t abhi-hr&uacute;ta<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>s&acirc;t agh&acirc;&acute;t abhi-hr&uacute;ta<I>h</I>.</p>

<p>For thou, god, art the deliverer from all assaults. Vishp&aacute;<I>t</I>, deliverer, from vi and spa<I>s</I>, to bind.</p>  
<p>V&iacute;-hruta, which occurs twice, means evidently what has been injured or spoiled:</p>  
<p>VIII, 1, 12. &iacute;shkart&acirc; v&iacute;-hrutam p&uacute;nar (iti).</p>  
<p>He who sets right what has been injured. Cf. VIII, 20, 26.</p>  
<p>&Aacute;vi-hruta again clearly means uninjured, intact, entire:</p>  
<p>V, 66, 2. t&acirc;&acute; h&iacute; kshatr&aacute;m &aacute;vi-hrutam&#8212;&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&acirc;te.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:9:1">1</A>. Tavish&aacute; certainly means strength, and that it is used in the plural in the sense of acts of strength, we can see from the first verse of our hymn and other passages. But when we read that tavish&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i are placed on the chariots of the Maruts, just as before bhadr&acirc;&acute;, good things, food, &amp;c., are mentioned, it is clear that so abstract a meaning as strength or powers would not be applicable here. We might take it in the modern sense of forces, i.&nbsp;e. your armies, your companions are on your chariots, striving with each other; but as the word is a neuter, weapons, as the means</p>  
<p><a name="page_230"><font size="1" color="green">p. 230</font></A></p>  
<p>of strength, seemed a preferable rendering. As to mithasp<I>ri</I>dhya, see I, 119, 3, <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#page_164">p. 164</A>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:9:2">2</A>. The rendering of this passage must depend on the question whether the kh&acirc;d&iacute;s, whatever they are, can be carried on the shoulders or not. We saw before (<A HREF="sbe3221.htm#page_120">p. 120</A>) that kh&acirc;d&iacute;s were used both as ornaments and as weapons, and that, when used as weapons, they were most likely rings or quoits with sharp edges. There is at least one other passage where these kh&acirc;d&iacute;s are said to be worn on the shoulders:</p>  
<p>VII, 56, 13. &aacute;<I>m</I>seshu &acirc;&acute; maruta<I>h</I> kh&acirc;d&aacute;ya<I>h</I> va<I>h</I> v&aacute;ksha<I>h</I>-su rukm&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> upa-<I>s</I>i<I>s</I>riy&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>On your shoulders are the quoits, on your chests the golden chains are fastened.</p>  
<p>In other places the kh&acirc;d&iacute;s are said to be in the hands, h&aacute;steshu, but this would only show that they are there when actually used for fighting. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 168, 3. &acirc;&acute; esh&acirc;m &aacute;<I>m</I>seshu rambh&iacute;n&icirc;-iva rarabhe, h&aacute;steshu kh&acirc;d&iacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>a k<I>ri</I>t&iacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>a s&aacute;m dadhe.</p>  
<p>To their shoulders there clings as if a clinging wife, in their hands the quoit is held and the dagger.</p>  
<p>In V, 58, 2, the Maruts are called kh&acirc;&acute;di-hasta, holding the quoits in their hands. There is one passage which was mentioned before (<A HREF="sbe3221.htm#page_112">p. 112</A>), where the kh&acirc;d&iacute;s are said to be on the feet of the Maruts, and on the strength of this passage Professor Roth proposes to alter pr&aacute;-patheshu to pr&aacute;-padeshu, and to translate, 'The kh&acirc;d&iacute;s are on your forefeet.' I do not think this emendation necessary. Though we do not know the exact shape and character of the kh&acirc;d&iacute;, we know that it was a weapon, most likely a ring, occasionally used for ornament, and carried along either on the feet or on the shoulders, but in actual battle held in the hand. The weapon which Vish<I>n</I>u holds in one of his right hands, the so-called <I>k</I>akra, may be the modern representation of the ancient kh&acirc;d&iacute;. What, however, is quite certain is this, that kh&acirc;d&iacute; in the Veda never means food, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a optionally interprets it. This interpretation is accepted by Wilson, who translates, 'At your resting-places on the road refreshments (are ready).' Nay, he</p>  
<p><a name="page_231"><font size="1" color="green">p. 231</font></A></p>  
<p>goes on in a note to use this passage as a proof of the advanced civilisation of India at the time of the Vedic <I>Ri</I>shis. 'The expression,' he says, 'is worthy of note, as indicating the existence of accommodations for the use of travellers: the prapatha is the choltri of the south of India, the sar&aacute;i of the Mohammedans, a place by the road-side where the travellers may find shelter and provisions.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:9:3">3</A>. This last passage shows that the poet is really representing to himself the Maruts as on their journey, and he therefore adds, 'your axle turns the two (IV, 30, 2) wheels together,' which probably means no more than, 'your chariot is going smoothly or quickly.' Though the expression seems to us hardly correct, yet one can well imagine how the axle was supposed to turn the wheels as the horses were drawing the axle, and the axle acted on the wheels. Anyhow, no other translation seems possible. Sam&aacute;y&acirc; in the Veda means together, at once, and is the Greek (&#8001;&#0956;&#8135;, generally &#8001;&#0956;&#0959;&#8166; or &#8001;&#0956;&#8182;&#0962;, the Latin simul. Cf. I, 56, 6; 73, 6; 113, 10; 163, 3; VII, 66, 15; IX, 75, 4; 85, 5; 97, 56.</p>  
<p>V<I>ri</I>t means to turn, and is frequently used with reference to the wheels:</p>  
<p>VIII, 46, 23. d&aacute;<I>s</I>a <I>s</I>y&acirc;v&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>&#8212;nem&iacute;m n&iacute; vav<I>ri</I>tu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The ten black horses turn down the felly or the wheel.</p>

<p>All men turn always round thee, like wheels.</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:10:3">3</A>. On &eacute;ta in the sense of fallow deer, or, it may be, antelope, see I, 165, 5, note 2, page <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#page_196">196</A>.</p>  
<p>&Eacute;ta originally means variegated, and thus becomes a name of any speckled deer, it being difficult to say what exact species is meant. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a in our passage explains &eacute;t&acirc;<I>h</I> by <I>s</I>uklavar<I>n</I>&acirc; m&acirc;l&acirc;<I>h</I>, many-coloured wreaths or chains, which may be right. Yet the suggestion of Professor Roth that &eacute;t&acirc;<I>h</I>, deer, stands here for the skins of fallow deer, is certainly more poetical, and quite in accordance with the Vedic idiom, which uses, for instance, go, cow, not only in the sense of milk,&#8212;that is done even in more homely English,&#8212;but also for leather, and thong. It is likewise in accordance with what we know of the earliest dress of the Vedic Indians, that deer-skins should here be mentioned. We learn from &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana's G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tras, of which we now possess an excellent edition by Professor Stenzler, and a reprint of the text and commentary by R&acirc;ma N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a Vidy&acirc;ratna, in the Bibliotheca Indica, that a boy when he was brought to his tutor, i.&nbsp;e. from the eighth to possibly the twenty-fourth year, had to be well combed, and attired in a new dress. A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a should wear the skin of an antelope (ai<I>n</I>eya), the Kshatriya the skin of a deer (raurava), the Vai<I>s</I>ya the skin of a goat (&acirc;<I>g</I>a). If they wore dresses, that of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a should be dark red (k&acirc;sh&acirc;ya), that of the Kshatriya bright red (m&acirc;<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ish<I>th</I>a), that of the Vai<I>s</I>ya yellow (h&acirc;ridra). The girdle of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a should be of Mu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>a grass, that of the Kshatriya a bow-string, that of the Vai<I>s</I>ya made of sheep's wool. The same regulations occur in other S&ucirc;tras, as, for instance, the Dharma-s&ucirc;tras of the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;yas and Gautamas, though there are certain characteristic differences in each, which may be due either to local or to chronological causes. Thus according to the &Acirc;pastamb&icirc;ya-s&ucirc;tras, which have been published by Professor B&uuml;hler, the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a may wear the skin of the hari<I>n</I>a deer, or that of the antelope (ai<I>n</I>eyam), but the latter must be from the black antelope (k<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>am), and, a proviso is added, that if a man wears the black antelope skin, he must never spread it out to sit or sleep on it. As materials for the dress, &Acirc;pastamba</p>  
<p><a name="page_233"><font size="1" color="green">p. 233</font></A></p>  
<p>allows <I>s</I>a<I>n</I>a, hemp&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_113"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>, or kshum&acirc;, flax, and he adds that woollen dresses are allowed to all castes, as well as the kambala (masc.), which seems to be any cloth made of vegetable substances (darbh&acirc;dinirmitam <I>k</I>&icirc;ram kambalam). He then adds a curious remark, which would seem to show</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></A></p>  
<p>that the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as preferred skins, and the Kshatriyas clothes, for he says that those who wish well to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as should wear a<I>g</I>ina, skins, and those who wish well to the Kshatriyas should wear vastra, clothes, and those who wish well to both should wear both, but, in that case, the skin should always form the outer garment. The Dharma-s&ucirc;tras of the Gautamas, which were published in India, prescribe likewise for the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a the black antelope skin, and allow clothes of hemp or linen (<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>akshauma<I>k</I>&icirc;ra) as well as kutapas (woollen cloth) for all. What is new among the Gautamas is, that they add the k&acirc;rp&acirc;sa, the cotton dress, which is important as showing an early knowledge of this manufacture. The k&acirc;rp&acirc;sa dress occurs once more as a present to be given to the Potar priest (&Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras IX, 4), and was evidently considered as a valuable present, taking precedence of the kshaum&icirc; or linen dress. It is provided that the cotton dress should not be dyed, for this, I suppose, is the meaning of avik<I>ri</I>ta. Immediately after, however, it is said, that some authorities say the dress should be dyed red (k&acirc;sh&acirc;yam apy eke), the very expression which occurred in &Acirc;pastamba, and that, in that case, the red for the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a's dress should be taken from the bark of trees (v&acirc;rksha). Manu, who here, as elsewhere, simply paraphrases the ancient S&ucirc;tras, says, II, 41:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">k&acirc;rsh<I>n</I>arauravab&acirc;st&acirc;ni <I>k</I>arm&acirc;<I>n</I>i brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;ri<I>n</I>a<I>h</I><br> vas&icirc;rann &acirc;nup&ucirc;rvye<I>n</I>a <I>s</I>&acirc;<I>n</I>akshaum&acirc;vik&acirc;ni <I>k</I>a.</div></p>  
<p>'Let Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rins wear (as outer garments) the skins of the black antelope, the deer, the goat, (as under garments) dresses of hemp, flax, and sheep's wool, in the order of the three castes.'</p>  
<p>The Sanskrit name for a dressed skin is a<I>g</I>ina, a word which does not occur in the Rig-Veda, but which, if Bopp is right in deriving it from a<I>g</I>&aacute;, goat, as &#0945;&#7984;&#0947;&#0943;&#0962; from &#0945;&#7988;&#0958;, would have meant originally, not skin in general, but a goat-skin. The skins of the &eacute;ta, here ascribed to the Maruts, would be identical with the ai<I>n</I>eya, which &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana ascribes to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, not, as we should expect, to the Kshatriya, if, as has been supposed, ai<I>n</I>eya is derived from ena, which is a secondary form, particularly in the</p>  
<p><a name="page_235"><font size="1" color="green">p. 235</font></A></p>  
<p>feminine en&icirc;, of eta. There is, however, another word, e<I>d</I>a, a kind of sheep, which, but for Festus, might be haedus, and by its side e<I>n</I>a, a kind of antelope. These two forms pre-suppose an earlier er<I>n</I>a or ar<I>n</I>a, and point therefore in a different direction, though hardly to &#7940;&#0961;&#0957;&#0949;&#0962;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:10:4">4</A>. I translate kshur&aacute; by sharp edges, but it might have been translated literally by razors, for, strange as it may sound, razors were known, not only during the Vedic period, but even previous to the Aryan separation. The Sanskrit kshur&aacute; is the Greek &#0958;&#0965;&#0961;&#8057;&#0962; or &#0958;&#0965;&#0961;&#8057;&#0957;. In the Veda we have clear allusions to shaving:</p>  
<p>X, 142, 4. yad&acirc;&acute; te v&acirc;&acute;ta<I>h</I> anu-v&acirc;&acute;ti <I>s</I>o<I>k</I>&iacute;<I>h</I>, v&aacute;pt&acirc;-iva <I>s</I>m&aacute;<I>s</I>ru vapasi pr&aacute; bh&ucirc;&acute;ma.</p>  
<p>When the wind blows after thy blast, then thou shavest the earth as a barber shaves the beard. Cf. I, 65, 4.</p>  
<p>If, as B. and R. suggest, vaptar, barber, is connected with the more modern name for barber in Sanskrit, viz. n&acirc;pita. we should have to admit a root svap, in the sense of tearing or pulling, vellere, from which we might derive the Vedic svap&ucirc;&acute; (VII, 56, 3), beak. Corresponding to this we find in Old High-German snabul, beak, (schnepfe, snipe,) and in Old Norse nef. The Anglo-Saxon neb means mouth and nose, while in modern English neb or nib is used for the bill or beak of a bird&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_114"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. Another derivation of n&acirc;pita, proposed by Professor Weber (Kuhn's Beitr&auml;ge, vol. i, p. 505), who takes n&acirc;pita as a dialectic form of sn&acirc;pitar, balneator, or lavator, might be admitted if it could be proved that in India also the barber was at the same time a balneator. Burnouf, Lotus, p. 452, translating from the S&acirc;ma<I>&ntilde;</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a-phala Sutta, mentions among the different professions of the people those of 'portier,' 'barbier,' and 'baigneur.'</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>

In English we may translate it by power. It is a substantive,</p>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:12:1">1</A>. Mahi-tvan&aacute;m, greatness, is formed by the suffix tvan&aacute;, which Professor Aufrecht has identified with the Greek &#0963;&#8059;&#0957;&#0951; (&#0963;&#0965;&#0957;&#0959;&#0957;); see Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. i, p. 482. The origin of this suffix has been explained by Professor Benfey, ibid. vol. vii, p. 120, who traces it back to the suffix tvan, for instance, i-tvan, goer, in pr&acirc;ta<I>h</I>-&iacute;tv&acirc; = pr&acirc;ta<I>h</I>-y&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:12:2">2</A>. Vrat&aacute; is one of the many words which, though we may perceive their one central idea, and their original purport, we have to translate by various terms in order to make them intelligible in every passage where they occur. Vrat&aacute; (from v<I>ri</I>, v<I>ri</I><I>n</I>oti), I believe, meant originally what is enclosed, protected, set apart, the Greek &#0957;&#0959;&#0956;&#8057;&#0962;:</p>  
<p>1. V, 46, 7. y&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> p&acirc;&acute;rthiv&acirc;sa<I>h</I> y&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> ap&acirc;&acute;m &aacute;pi vrat&eacute; t&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> dev&icirc;<I>h</I> su-hav&acirc;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;rma ya<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ata.</p>

<p>O ye gracious goddesses, who are on the earth or in the realm of the waters, grant us your protection!</p>  
<p>Here vrat&aacute; is used like v<I>ri</I><I>g</I>&aacute;na, see I, 165, 15, note 3, page <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#page_208">208</A>.</p>

<p>2. Vrat&aacute; means what is fenced off or forbidden, what is determined, what is settled, and hence, like dh&aacute;rman, law, ordinance. V&acirc;rayati means to prohibit. In this sense vrat&aacute; occurs very frequently:</p>  
<p>I, 25, 1. y&aacute;t <I>k</I>it h&iacute; te v&iacute;<I>s</I>a<I>h</I> yath&acirc; pr&aacute; deva varu<I>n</I>a vrat&aacute;m, min&icirc;m&aacute;si dy&aacute;vi-dyavi.</p>

<p>Formerly, and now, and also in future let us give praise to thee, O Varu<I>n</I>a; for in thee, O unconquerable, all laws are grounded, immovable as on a rock.</p>  
<p>A very frequent expression is &aacute;nu vrat&aacute;m, according to the command of a god, II, 38, 3; 6; VIII, 40, 8; or simply &aacute;nu vrat&aacute;m, according to law and order:</p>

<p>Aryaman protects him who acts uprightly according to law.</p>  
<p>Cf. III, 61, 1; IV, 13, 2; V, 69, 1.</p>  
<p>3. The laws or ordinances or institutions of the gods are sometimes taken for the sacrifices which are supposed to be enjoined by the gods, and the performance of which is, in a certain sense, the performance of the divine will.</p>

<p>He who worships Agni and Soma with oblations, with a godly mind, or with an offering, protect his sacrifice, shield him from evil!</p>

<p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></A></p>  
<p>Agni, the first and wisest of poets, thou performest the sacrifice of the gods.</p>

<p>Let us, who possess much wealth, perform with prayers the sacrifices of Agni within our house.</p>  
<p>In another acceptation the vratas of the gods are what they perform and establish themselves, their own deeds:</p>  
<p>III, 6, 5. vrat&acirc;&acute; te agne mahat&aacute;<I>h</I> mah&acirc;&acute;ni t&aacute;va kr&aacute;tv&acirc; r&oacute;das&icirc; (&iacute;ti) &acirc;&acute; tatantha.</p>  
<p>The deeds of thee, the great Agni, are great, by thy power thou hast stretched out heaven and earth.</p>

<p>The wise spirit established the sky, and made the width of the earth, as king he approached all beings,&#8212;all these are the works of Varu<I>n</I>a.</p>

<p>Men fight the fiend, trying to overcome by their deeds him who performs no sacrifices; or, the lawless enemy.</p>  
<p>Lastly, vrat&aacute; comes to mean sway, power, or work, and the expression vrat&eacute; t&aacute;va signifies, at thy command, under thy auspices:</p>

<p>At whose bidding the earth bows down, at whose bidding hoofed animals run about, at whose bidding the plants assume all shapes, mayest thou, O Par<I>g</I>anya, yield us great protection!</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:12:3">3</A>. D&acirc;tr&aacute;, if derived from d&acirc;, would mean gift, and that meaning is certainly the most applicable in some passages where it occurs:</p>  
<p>IX, 97, 55. &aacute;si bh&aacute;ga<I>h</I> &aacute;si d&acirc;tr&aacute;sya d&acirc;t&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Thou art Bhaga, thou art the giver of the gift.</p>  
<p>In other passages, too, particularly in those where the verb d&acirc; or some similar verb occurs in the same verse, it can hardly be doubted that the poet took d&acirc;tr&aacute;, like d&aacute;tra or d&aacute;ttra, in the sense of gift, bounty, largess:</p>  
<p>I, 116, 6. y&aacute;m a<I>s</I>vin&acirc; dad&aacute;thu<I>h</I> <I>s</I>vet&aacute;m &aacute;<I>s</I>vam&#8212;t&aacute;t v&acirc;m d&acirc;tr&aacute;m m&aacute;hi k&icirc;rt&eacute;nyam bh&ucirc;t.</p>

<p>I call for the unrivalled, the uninjured bounty of Aditi.</p>

<p>We ask thee, strong hero, for the gift which does not perish; we ask from thee the precious wealth.</p>

<p>For thou, O Agni, lord of heaven, art the master of the precious gift. Cf. IV, 38, 1.</p>  
<p>Professor Roth considers that d&acirc;tr&aacute; is derived rather from d&acirc;, to divide, and that it means share, lot, possession. But there is not a single passage where the meaning of gift or</p>  
<p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></A></p>  
<p>bounty does not answer all purposes. In VII, 56, 21, m&acirc;&acute; va<I>h</I> d&acirc;tr&acirc;&acute;t maruta<I>h</I> n&iacute;<I>h</I> ar&acirc;ma, is surely best translated by, 'let us not fall away from your bounty,' and in our own passage the same meaning should be assigned to d&acirc;tr&aacute;. The idea of d&acirc;tr&aacute;, bounty, is by no means incompatible with vrat&aacute;, realm, dominion, sway, if we consider that the sphere within which the bounty of a king or a god is exercised and accepted, is in one sense his realm. What the poet therefore says in our passage is simply this, that the bounty of the Maruts extends as far as the realm of Aditi, i.&nbsp;e. is endless, or extends everywhere, Aditi being in its original conception the deity of the unbounded world beyond, the earliest attempt at expressing the Infinite.</p>  
<p>As to d&acirc;&acute;tra occurring once with the accent on the first syllable in the sense of sickle, see M.&nbsp;M., '&Uuml;ber eine Stelle in Y&acirc;ska's Commentar zum Naigha<I>n</I><I>t</I>uka,' Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenl&auml;ndischen Gesellschaft, 1853, vol. vii, P. 375.</p>  
<p>VIII, 78, 10. t&aacute;va &iacute;t indra ah&aacute;m &acirc;-<I>s</I>&aacute;s&acirc; h&aacute;ste d&acirc;&acute;tram <I>k</I>an&aacute; &acirc;&acute; dade.</p>  
<p>Trusting in thee alone, O Indra, I take the sickle in my hand.</p>  
<p>This d&acirc;&acute;tra, sickle, is derived from do, to cut.</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi, the Infinite.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:12:4">4</A>. Aditi, an ancient god or goddess, is in reality the earliest name invented to express the Infinite; not the Infinite as the result of a long process of abstract reasoning, but the visible Infinite, visible, as it were, to the naked eye, the endless expanse beyond the earth, beyond the clouds, beyond the sky. That was called A-diti, the un-bound, the un-bounded; one might almost say, but for fear of misunderstandings, the Absolute, for it is derived from diti, bond, and the negative particle, and meant therefore originally what is free from bonds of any kind, whether of space or time, free from physical weakness, free from moral guilt. Such a conception became of necessity a being, a person, a god. To us such a name and such a conception seem decidedly modern, and to find in the Veda Aditi, the</p>  
<p><a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="green">p. 242</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Infinite, as the mother of the principal gods, is certainly, at first sight, startling. But the fact is that the thoughts of primitive humanity were not only different from our thoughts, but different also from what we think their thoughts ought to have been. The poets of the Veda indulged freely in theogonic speculations, without being frightened by any contradictions. They knew of Indra as the greatest of gods, they knew of Agni as the god of gods, they knew of Varu<I>n</I>a as the ruler of all, but they were by no means startled at the idea that their Indra had a mother, or that their Agni was born like a babe from the friction of two fire-sticks, or that Varu<I>n</I>a and his brother Mitra were nursed in the lap of Aditi. Some poet would take hold o the idea of an unbounded power, of Aditi, originally without any reference to other gods. Very soon these ideas met, and, without any misgivings, either the gods were made subordinate to, and represented as the sons of Aditi, or where Indra was to be praised as supreme, Aditi was represented as doing him homage.</p>  
<p>VIII, 12, 14. ut&aacute; sva-r&acirc;<I>g</I>e &aacute;diti<I>h</I> st&oacute;mam &iacute;ndr&acirc;ya <I>g</I>&icirc;<I>g</I>anat.</p>  
<p>And Aditi produced a hymn for Indra, the king.</p>  
<p>Here Professor Roth takes Aditi as an epithet of Agni, not as the name of the goddess Aditi, while Dr. Muir rightly takes it in the latter sense, and likewise retains st&oacute;mam instead of s&oacute;mam, as printed by Professor Aufrecht. Cf. VII, 38, 4.</p>  
<p>The idea of the Infinite, as I have tried to show elsewhere, was most powerfully impressed on the awakening mind, or, as we now say, was revealed, by the East&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_107"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. &#8216;It is impossible to enter fully into all the thoughts and feelings that passed through the minds of the early poets when they formed names for that far, far East from whence even the early dawn, the sun, the day, their own life, seemed to spring. A new life flashed up every morning before their eyes, and the fresh breezes of the dawn reached them like greetings from the distant lands beyond the mountains, beyond the clouds, beyond the dawn, beyond &#8220;the immortal</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="green">p. 243</font></A></p>  
<p>sea which brought us hither.&#8221; The dawn seemed to them to open golden gates for the sun to pass in triumph, and while those gates were open, their eyes and their mind strove in their childish way to pierce beyond the limits of this finite world. That silent aspect awakened in the human mind the conception of the Infinite, the Immortal, the Divine.&#8217; Aditi is a name for that distant East, but Aditi is more than the dawn. Aditi is beyond the dawn, and in one place (I, 113, 19) the dawn is called 'the face of Aditi,' &aacute;diter &aacute;n&icirc;kam. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>V, 62, 8. h&iacute;ra<I>n</I>ya-r&ucirc;pam ush&aacute;sa<I>h</I> v&iacute;-ush<I>t</I>au &aacute;ya<I>h</I>-sth&ucirc;<I>n</I>am &uacute;t-it&acirc; s&ucirc;&acute;ryasya, &acirc;&acute; rohatha<I>h</I> varu<I>n</I>a mitra g&aacute;rtam &aacute;ta<I>h</I> <I>k</I>aksh&acirc;the (&iacute;ti) &aacute;ditim d&iacute;tim h.</p>  
<p>Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, you mount your chariot, which is golden, when the dawn bursts forth, and has iron poles at the setting of the sun: from thence you see Aditi and Diti, i.&nbsp;e. what is yonder and what is here.</p>  
<p>If we keep this original conception of Aditi clearly before our mind, the various forms which Aditi assumes, even in the hymns of the Veda, will not seem incoherent. Aditi is not a prominent deity in the Veda, she is celebrated rather in her sons, the &Acirc;dityas, than in her own person. While there are so many hymns addressed to Ushas, the dawn, or Indra, or Agni, or Savitar, there is but one hymn, X, 72, which from our point of view, though not from that of Indian theologians, might be called a hymn to Aditi. Nevertheless Aditi is a familiar name; a name of the past, whether in time or in thought only, and a name that lives on in the name of the &Acirc;dityas, the sons of Aditi, including the principal deities of the Veda.</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi and the &Acirc;dityas.</p>  
<p>Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 107, 2. &ucirc;pa na<I>h</I> dev&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;vas&acirc; &acirc;&acute; gamantu &aacute;&#7749;giras&acirc;m s&acirc;&acute;ma-bhi<I>h</I> st&ucirc;y&aacute;m&acirc;n&acirc;<I>h</I>, &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> indriya&iacute;<I>h</I> mar&ucirc;ta<I>h</I> mar&uacute;t-bhi<I>h</I> &acirc;ditya&iacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;rma ya<I>m</I>sat.</p>  
<p>May the gods come to us with their help, praised by the songs of the A&#7749;giras,&#8212;Indra with his powers, the Maruts with the storms, may Aditi with the &Acirc;dityas give us protection!</p>  
<p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A></p>  
<p>X, 66, 3. &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> v&aacute;su-bhi<I>h</I> p&aacute;ri p&acirc;tu na<I>h</I> g&aacute;yam &acirc;ditya&iacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;rma ya<I>k</I><I>kh</I>atu, rudr&aacute;<I>h</I> rudr&eacute;bhi<I>h</I> dev&aacute;<I>h</I> m<I>ri</I><I>l</I>ay&acirc;ti na<I>h</I> tv&aacute;sh<I>t</I>&acirc; na<I>h</I> gn&acirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I> suvit&acirc;&acute;ya <I>g</I>invatu.</p>  
<p>May Indra with the Vasus watch our house, may Aditi with the &Acirc;dityas give us protection, may the divine Rudra with the Rudras have mercy upon us, may Tvash<I>t</I>ar with the mothers bring us to happiness!</p>  
<p>III, 54, 20. &acirc;ditya&iacute;<I>h</I> nah &aacute;diti<I>h</I> <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>otu y&aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>antu na<I>h</I> mar&ucirc;ta<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;rma bhadr&aacute;m.</p>  
<p>May Aditi with the &Acirc;dityas hear us, may the Maruts give us good protection!</p>  
<p>In another passage Varu<I>n</I>a takes the place of Aditi as the leader of the &Acirc;dityas:</p>  
<p>VII, 35, 6. <I>s</I>&aacute;m na<I>h</I> &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> v&aacute;su-bhi<I>h</I> dev&aacute;<I>h</I> astu <I>s</I>&aacute;m &acirc;dity&eacute;bhi<I>h</I> v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> su-<I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa<I>h</I>, <I>s</I>&aacute;m na<I>h</I> rudr&aacute;<I>h</I> rudr&eacute;bhi<I>h</I> <I>g</I>&aacute;l&acirc;sha<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;m na<I>h</I> tv&aacute;sh<I>t</I>&acirc; gn&acirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I> ih&aacute; <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>otu.</p>  
<p>May Indra bless us, the god with the Vasus! May Varu<I>n</I>a, the glorious, bless us with the &Acirc;dityas! May the relieving Rudra with the Rudras bless us! May Tvash<I>t</I>ar with the mothers kindly hear us here!</p>  
<p>Even in passages where the poet seems to profess an exclusive worship of Aditi, as in</p>  
<p>V, 69, 3. pr&acirc;t&aacute;<I>h</I> dev&icirc;&acute;m &aacute;ditim <I>g</I>ohav&icirc;mi madhy&aacute;ndine &uacute;t-it&acirc; s&ucirc;&acute;ryasya,</p>  
<p>I invoke the divine Aditi early in the morning, at noon, and at the setting of the sun,</p>  
<p>Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, her principal sons, are mentioned immediately after, and implored, like her, to bestow blessings on their worshipper.</p>  
<p>Her exclusive worship appears once, in VIII, 19, 14.</p>  
<p>A very frequent expression is that of &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> without any copula, to signify the &Acirc;dityas and Aditi:</p>  
<p>IV, 25, 3. k&aacute;<I>h</I> dev&acirc;&acute;n&acirc;m &aacute;va<I>h</I> ady&aacute; v<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&icirc;te k&aacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;ditim <I>g</I>y&oacute;ti<I>h</I> &icirc;<I>t</I><I>t</I>e.</p>  
<p>Who does choose now the protection of the gods? Who asks the &Acirc;dityas, Aditi, for their light?</p>  
<p>VI, 51, 5. v&iacute;<I>s</I>ve &acirc;dity&acirc;<I>h</I> adite sa-<I>g</I>&oacute;sh&acirc;<I>h</I> asm&aacute;bhyam <I>s</I>&aacute;rma bahul&aacute;m v&iacute; yanta.</p>  
<p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></A></p>  
<p>All ye &Acirc;dityas, Aditi together, grant to us your manifold protection!</p>  
<p>X, 39, 11. n&aacute; t&aacute;m r&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;nau adite k&uacute;ta<I>h</I> <I>k</I>an&aacute; n&aacute; &aacute;<I>m</I>ha<I>h</I> a<I>s</I>noti du<I>h</I>-it&aacute;m n&aacute;ki<I>h</I> bhay&aacute;m.</p>  
<p>O ye two kings (the A<I>s</I>vins), Aditi, no evil reaches him from anywhere, no misfortune, no fear (whom you protect). Cf. VII, 66, 6.</p>  
<p>X, 63, 5. t&acirc;&acute;n &acirc;&acute; viv&acirc;sa n&aacute;mas&acirc; suv<I>ri</I>kt&iacute;-bhi<I>h</I> mah&aacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;ditim svast&aacute;ye.</p>  
<p>I cherish them with worship and with hymns, the great &Acirc;dityas, Aditi, for happiness' sake.</p>  
<p>X, 63, 17. ev&aacute; plat&eacute;<I>h</I> s&ucirc;n&uacute;<I>h</I> av&icirc;v<I>ri</I>dhat va<I>h</I> v&iacute;<I>s</I>ve &acirc;dity&acirc;<I>h</I> adite man&icirc;sh&icirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>The wise son of Plati magnified you, all ye &Acirc;dityas, Aditi!</p>  
<p>X, 65, 9. par<I>g</I>&aacute;ny&acirc;v&acirc;&acute;t&acirc; v<I>ri</I>shabh&acirc;&acute; pur&icirc;sh&iacute;<I>n</I>&acirc; indrav&acirc;y&ucirc;&acute; (&iacute;ti) v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> mitr&aacute;<I>h</I> aryam&acirc;&acute;, dev&acirc;&acute;n &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;ditim hav&acirc;mahe y&eacute; p&acirc;&acute;rthiv&acirc;sa<I>h</I> divy&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> ap-s&uacute; y&eacute;.</p>  
<p>There are Par<I>g</I>anya and V&acirc;ta, the powerful, the givers of rain, Indra and V&acirc;yu, Varu<I>n</I>a, Mitra, Aryaman, we call the divine &Acirc;dityas, Aditi, those who dwell on the earth, in heaven, in the waters.</p>  
<p>We may not be justified in saying that there ever was a period in the history of the religious thought of India, a period preceding the worship of the &Acirc;dityas, when Aditi, the Infinite, was worshipped, though to the sage who first coined this name, it expressed, no doubt, for a time the principal, if not the only object of his faith and worship.</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi and Daksha.</p>  
<p>Soon, however, the same mental process which led on later speculators from the earth to the elephant, and from the elephant to the tortoise, led the Vedic poets beyond Aditi, the Infinite. There was something beyond that Infinite which for a time they had grasped by the name of Aditi, and this, whether intentionally or by a mere accident of language, they called d&aacute;ksha, literally power or the powerful. All this, no doubt, sounds strikingly modern, yet, though the passages in which this d&aacute;ksha is mentioned are few in number, I should not venture to</p>  
<p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></A></p>  
<p>say that they are necessarily modern, even if by modern we mean only later than 1000 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span> Nothing can bring the perplexity of the ancient mind, if once drawn into this vortex of speculation, more clearly before us than if we read:</p>  
<p>X, 72, 4-5. &acirc;dite<I>h</I> d&aacute;ksha<I>h</I> a<I>g</I>&acirc;yata d&aacute;ksh&acirc;t &ucirc;<I>m</I> (&iacute;ti) &aacute;diti<I>h</I> p&aacute;ri,&#8212;&aacute;diti<I>h</I> h&iacute; &aacute;<I>g</I>anish<I>t</I>a d&aacute;ksha y&acirc;&acute; duhit&acirc;&acute; t&aacute;va, t&acirc;&acute;m dev&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;nu a<I>g</I>&acirc;yanta bhadr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> am<I>r&iacute;</I>ta-bandhava<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Daksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha. For Aditi was born, O Daksha, she who is thy daughter; after her the gods were born, the blessed, who share in immortality.</p>  
<p>Or, in more mythological language:</p>  
<p>X, 64, 5. d&aacute;kshasya v&acirc; adite <I>g</I>&aacute;nmani vrat&eacute; r&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>&acirc;n&acirc; mitr&acirc;&acute;-v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>&acirc; &acirc;&acute; viv&acirc;sasi.</p>  
<p>Or thou, O Aditi, nursest in the birthplace of Daksha the two kings, Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>Nay, even this does not suffice. There is something again beyond Aditi and Daksha, and one poet says:</p>  
<p>X, 5, 7. &aacute;sat <I>k</I>a s&aacute;t <I>k</I>a param&eacute; v&iacute;-oman d&aacute;kshasya <I>g</I>&aacute;nman &aacute;dite<I>h</I> up&aacute;-sthe.</p>  
<p>Not-being and Being are in the highest heaven, in the birthplace of Daksha, in the lap of Aditi.</p>  
<p>At last something like a theogony, though full of contradictions, was imagined, and in the same hymn from which we have already quoted, the poet says:</p>  
<p>X, 72, 1-4. dev&acirc;&acute;n&acirc;m n&uacute; vay&aacute;m <I>g</I>&acirc;&acute;n&acirc; pr&aacute; vo<I>k</I>&acirc;ma vipany&aacute;y&acirc;, ukth&eacute;shu <I>s</I>asy&aacute;m&acirc;neshu y&aacute;<I>h</I> (y&aacute;t?) p&aacute;<I>s</I>y&acirc;t ut-tare yug&eacute;. 1.</p>

<p>his bellows); in a former age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being.</p>  
<p>3. In the first age of the gods, Being was born from Not-being, after it were born the Regions (space), from them Utt&acirc;napada;</p>  
<p>4. From Utt&acirc;napad the Earth was born, the Regions were born from the Earth. Daksha was born of Aditi, and Aditi from Daksha.</p>  
<p>The ideas of Being and Not-being (&#0964;&#8056; &#8004;&#0957; and &#0964;&#8056; &#0956;&#8052; &#8004;&#0957;) are familiar to the Hindus from a very early time in their intellectual growth, and they can only have been the result of abstract speculation. Therefore d&aacute;ksha, too, in the sense of power or potentia, may have been a metaphysical conception. But it may also have been suggested by a mere accident of language, a never-failing source of ancient thoughts. The name d&aacute;ksha-pitara<I>h</I>, an epithet of the gods, has generally been translated by 'those who have Daksha for their father.' But it may have been used originally in a very different sense. Professor Roth has, I think, convincingly proved that this epithet d&aacute;ksha-pitar, as given to certain gods, does not mean, the gods who have Daksha for their father, but that it had originally the simpler meaning of fathers of strength, or, as he translates it, 'preserving, possessing, granting faculties&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_109"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.' This is particularly clear in one passage:</p>  
<p>III, 27, 9. bh&ucirc;t&acirc;&acute;n&acirc;m g&aacute;rbham &acirc;&acute; dadhe, d&aacute;kshasya, pit&aacute;ram.</p>  
<p>I place Agni, the source of all beings, the father of strength &#8230;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></A></p>  
<p>After this we can hardly hesitate how to translate the next verse:</p>  
<p>VI, 50, 2. su-<I>g</I>y&oacute;tisha<I>h</I>&#8212;d&aacute;ksha-pit<I>r&icirc;</I>n&#8212;dev&acirc;&acute;n.</p>  
<p>The resplendent gods, the fathers of strength.</p>  
<p>It may seem more doubtful, when we come to gods like Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, whom we are so much accustomed to regard as &Acirc;dityas, or sons of Aditi, and who therefore, according to the theogony mentioned before, would have the best claim to the name of sons of Daksha; yet here, too, the original and simple meaning is preferable; nay, it is most likely that from passages like this, the later explanation, which makes Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a the sons of Daksha, may have sprung.</p>  
<p>VII, 66, 2. y&acirc;&acute;&#8212;su-d&aacute;ksh&acirc; d&aacute;ksha-pitar&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, who are of good strength, the fathers of strength.</p>  
<p>Lastly, even men may claim this name; for, unless we change the accent, we must translate:</p>  
<p>VIII, 63, 10. avasy&aacute;va<I>h</I> yushm&acirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I> d&aacute;ksha-pitara<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>We suppliants, being, through your aid, fathers of strength.</p>  
<p>But whatever view we take, whether we take d&aacute;ksha in the sense of power, as a personification of a philosophical conception, or as the result of a mythological misunderstanding occasioned by the name of d&aacute;ksha-pitar, the fact remains that in certain hymns of the Rig-veda (VIII, 25, 5) D&aacute;ksha, like Aditi, has become a divine person, and has retained his place as one of the &Acirc;dityas to the very latest time of Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>ic tradition.</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi in her Cosmic Character.</p>  
<p>But to return to Aditi. Let us look upon her as the Infinite personified, and most passages, even those where she is presented as a subordinate deity, will become intelligible.</p>  
<p>Aditi, in her cosmic character, is the Beyond, the unbounded realm beyond earth, sky, and heaven, and originally she was distinct from the sky, the earth, and the ocean. Aditi is mentioned by the side of heaven and earth, which</p>  
<p><a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></A></p>  
<p>shows that, though in more general language she may be identified with heaven and earth in their unlimited character, her original conception was different. This we see in passages where different deities or powers are invoked together, particularly if they are invoked together in the same verse, and where Aditi holds a separate place by the side of heaven and earth:</p>  
<p>I, 94, 16 (final). t&aacute;t na<I>h</I> mitr&aacute;<I>h</I> v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> mamahant&acirc;m &aacute;diti<I>h</I> s&iacute;ndhu<I>h</I> p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute; ut&aacute; dya&uacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a grant us this, may Aditi, Sindhu (sea), the Earth, and the Sky!</p>  
<p>In other passages, too, where Aditi has assumed a more personal character, she still holds her own by the side of heaven and earth; cf. IX, 97, 58 (final):</p>  
<p>I, 191, 6. dya&ucirc;<I>h</I> va<I>h</I> pit&acirc;&acute; p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute; m&acirc;t&acirc;&acute; s&oacute;ma<I>h</I> bhr&acirc;&acute;t&acirc; &aacute;diti<I>h</I> sv&aacute;s&acirc;.</p>  
<p>The Sky is your father, the Earth your mother, Soma your brother, Aditi your sister.</p>

<p>The mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the &Acirc;dityas, the source of immortality, I tell it forth to the man of understanding, may he not offend the cow, the guiltless Aditi! Cf. I, 153, 3; IX, 96, 15; V&acirc;<I>g</I>asan. Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; XIII, 49.</p>

<p>Let us for welfare step into the divine boat, with good oars, faultless and leakless&#8212;the well-protecting Earth, the peerless Sky, the sheltering, well-guiding Aditi!</p>

<p>Aditi, and Heaven and Earth.</p>  
<p>Where two or more verses come together, the fact that Aditi is mentioned by the side of Heaven and Earth may seem less convincing, because in these Nivids or long strings of invocations different names or representatives of one and the same power are not unfrequently put together. For instance,</p>  
<p>X, 36, 1-3. ush&aacute;s&acirc;n&aacute;kt&acirc; b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;&acute; (&iacute;ti) su-p&eacute;<I>s</I>as&acirc; dy&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;ksh&acirc;&acute;m&acirc; v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> mitr&aacute;<I>h</I> aryam&acirc;&acute;, &iacute;ndram huve mar&uacute;ta<I>h</I> p&aacute;rvat&acirc;n ap&aacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;n dy&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute; (&iacute;ti) ap&aacute;<I>h</I> sva&#771;r (&iacute;ti sva&#771;<I>h</I>). 1.</p>

<p>1. There are the grand and beautiful Morning and Night, Heaven and Earth, Varu<I>n</I>a, Mitra, Aryaman; I call Indra, the Maruts, the Waters, the &Acirc;dityas, Heaven and Earth, the Waters, the Heaven.</p>  
<p>2. May Heaven and Earth, the provident, the righteous, preserve us from sin and mischief! May the malevolent Nir<I>ri</I>ti not rule over us! This blessing of the gods we ask for to-day.</p>  
<p>3. May Aditi protect us from all sin, the mother of Mitra and of the rich Varu<I>n</I>a! May we obtain heavenly light without enemies! This blessing of the gods we ask for to-day.</p>  
<p>Here we cannot but admit that Dy&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;ksh&acirc;&acute;m&acirc;, heaven and earth, is meant for the same divine couple as Dy&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute;, heaven and earth, although under slightly differing names they are invoked separately. The waters are invoked twice in the same verse and under the same name; nor is there any indication that, as in other passages, the waters of the sky are meant as distinct from the waters of the sea. Nevertheless even here, Aditi, who in the third verse is called distinctly the mother of Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, cannot well have been meant for the same deity as Heaven and Earth, mentioned in the second verse; and the author of</p>  
<p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="green">p. 251</font></A></p>  
<p>these two verses, while asking the same blessing from both, must have been aware of the original independent character of Aditi.</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi as Mother.</p>  
<p>In this character of a deity of the far East, of an Orient in the true sense of the word, Aditi was naturally thought of as the mother of certain gods, particularly of those that were connected with the daily rising and setting of the sun. If it was asked whence comes the dawn, or the sun, or whence come day and night, or Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, or any of the bright, solar, eastern deities, the natural answer was that they come from the Orient, that they are the sons of Aditi. Thus we read in</p>  
<p>IX, 74, 3. urv&icirc;&acute; g&aacute;vy&ucirc;ti<I>h</I> &aacute;dite<I>h</I> <I>ri</I>t&aacute;m yat&eacute;.</p>  
<p>Wide is the space for him who goes on the right path of Aditi.</p>  
<p>In VIII, 25, 3, we are told that Aditi bore Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, and these in verse 5 are called the sons of Daksha (power), and the grandsons of <I>S</I>avas, which again means might: n&aacute;p&acirc;t&acirc; <I>s</I>&aacute;vasa<I>h</I> man&aacute;<I>h</I> s&ucirc;n&ucirc;&acute; (&iacute;ti) d&aacute;kshasya su-kr&aacute;t&ucirc; (&iacute;ti). In X, 36, 3, Aditi is called the mother of Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a; likewise in X, 132, 6; see also VI, 67, 4. In VIII, 47, 9, Aditi is called the mother of Mitra, Aryaman, Varu<I>n</I>a, who in VII, 60, 5 are called her sons. In X, 11, 1, Varu<I>n</I>a is called yahv&aacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;dite<I>h</I>, the son of Aditi (cf. VIII, 19, 12); in VII, 41, 2, Bhaga is mentioned as her son. In X, 72, 8, we hear of eight sons of Aditi, but it is added that she approached the gods with seven sons only, and that the eighth (m&acirc;rt&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&aacute;, addled egg) was thrown away: ash<I>t</I>a&uacute; putr&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> &aacute;dite<I>h</I> y&eacute; <I>g</I>&acirc;t&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> tanva&#771;<I>h</I> p&aacute;ri, dev&acirc;&acute;n &uacute;pa pr&aacute; ait sapt&aacute;-bhi<I>h</I> p&aacute;r&acirc; m&acirc;rt&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&aacute;m &acirc;syat.</p>  
<p>In X, 63, 2, the gods in general are represented as born from Aditi, the waters, and the earth: y&eacute; sth&aacute; <I>g</I>&acirc;t&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;dite<I>h</I> at-bhy&aacute;<I>h</I> p&aacute;ri y&eacute; p<I>ri</I>thivy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> t&eacute; me ih&aacute; <I>s</I>ruta h&aacute;vam.</p>  
<p>You who are born of Aditi, from the water, you who are born of the earth, hear ye all my call!</p>  
<p>The number seven, with regard to the &Acirc;dityas, occurs also in</p>  
<p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></A></p>  
<p>IX, 114, 3. sapt&aacute; d&iacute;<I>s</I>a<I>h</I> n&acirc;&acute;n&acirc;-s&ucirc;ry&acirc;<I>h</I> sapt&aacute; h&oacute;t&acirc;ra<I>h</I> <I>ri</I>tv&iacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I>, dev&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> y&eacute; sapt&aacute; t&eacute;bhi<I>h</I> soma abh&iacute; raksha na<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>There are seven regions with their different suns, there are seven Hotars as priests, those who are the seven gods, the &Acirc;dityas, with them, O Soma, protect us!</p>  
<p align="center">The Seven &Acirc;dityas.</p>  
<p>This number of seven &Acirc;dityas requires an explanation. To say that seven is a solemn or sacred number is to say very little, for however solemn or sacred that number may be elsewhere, it is not more sacred than any other number in the Veda. The often-mentioned seven rivers have a real geographical foundation, like the seven hills of Rome. The seven flames or treasures of Agni (V, 1, 5) and of Soma and Rudra (VI, 74, I), the seven paridhis or logs at certain sacrifices (X, 90, 15), the seven Harits or horses of the sun, the seven Hotar priests (III, 7, 7; 10, 4), the seven cities of the enemy destroyed by Indra (I, 63, 7), and even the seven <I>Ri</I>shis (X, 82, 2; 109, 4), all these do not prove that the number of seven was more sacred than the number of one or three or five or ten used in the Veda in a very similar way. With regard to the seven &Acirc;dityas, however, we are still able to see that their number of seven or eight had something to do with solar movements. If their number had always been eight, we should feel inclined to trace the number of the &Acirc;dityas back to the eight regions, or the eight cardinal points of the heaven. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 35, 8. ash<I>t</I>a&uacute; v&iacute; akhyat kak&uacute;bha<I>h</I> p<I>ri</I>thivy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The god Savitar lighted up the eight points of the earth (not the eight hills).</p>  
<p>But we have seen already that though the number of &Acirc;dityas was originally supposed to have been eight, it was reduced to seven, and this could hardly be said in any sense of the eight points of the compass. Cf. Taitt. &Acirc;r. I, 7, 6.</p>  
<p>As we cannot think in ancient India of the seven planets, I can only suggest the seven days or tithis of the four parvans of the lunar month as a possible prototype of the</p>  
<p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> &Acirc;dityas. This might even explain the destruction of the eighth &Acirc;ditya, considering that the eighth day of each parvan, owing to its uncertainty, might be represented as exposed to decay and destruction. This would explain such passages as,</p>  
<p>IV, 7, 5. y&aacute;<I>g</I>ish<I>th</I>am sapt&aacute; dh&acirc;&acute;ma-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Agni, most worthy of sacrifice in the seven stations.</p>  
<p>IX, 102, 2. ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;sya sapt&aacute; dh&acirc;&acute;ma-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>In the seven stations of the sacrifice.</p>  
<p>The seven threads of the sacrifice may have the same origin:</p>  
<p>II, 5, 2. &acirc;&acute; y&aacute;smin sapt&aacute; ra<I>s</I>m&aacute;ya<I>h</I> tat&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;sya net&aacute;ri, manushv&aacute;t da&iacute;vyam ash<I>t</I>am&aacute;m.</p>  
<p>In whom, as the leader of the sacrifice, the seven threads are stretched out,&#8212;the eighth divine being is manlike (?).</p>  
<p>The sacrifice itself is called, X, 124, 1, sapt&aacute;-tantu, having seven threads.</p>  
<p>X, 122, 3. sapt&aacute; dh&acirc;&acute;m&acirc;ni pari-y&aacute;n &aacute;martya<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Agni, the immortal, who goes round the seven stations.</p>  
<p>X, 8, 4. ush&aacute;h-usha<I>h</I> h&iacute; vaso (&iacute;ti) &aacute;gram &eacute;shi tv&aacute;m yam&aacute;yo<I>h</I> abhava<I>h</I> vi-bh&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;, <I>ri</I>t&acirc;&acute;ya sapt&aacute; dadhishe pad&acirc;&acute;ni <I>g</I>an&aacute;yan mitr&aacute;m tanve&#771; sv&acirc;&acute;yai.</p>  
<p>For thou, Vasu (Agni), comest first every morning, thou art the illuminator of the twins (day and night). Thou holdest the seven places for the sacrifice, creating Mitra (the sun) for thy own body.</p>  
<p>X, 5, 6. sapt&aacute; mary&acirc;&acute;d&acirc;<I>h</I> kav&aacute;ya<I>h</I> tatakshu<I>h</I> t&acirc;&acute;s&acirc;m &eacute;k&acirc;m &iacute;t abh&iacute; a<I>m</I>hur&aacute;<I>h</I> g&acirc;t.</p>  
<p>The sages established the seven divisions, but mischief befell one of them.</p>  
<p>I, 22, 16. &aacute;ta<I>h</I> dev&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> avantu na<I>h</I> y&aacute;ta<I>h</I> v&iacute;sh<I>n</I>u<I>h</I> vi-<I>k</I>akram&eacute; p<I>ri</I>thivy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> sapt&aacute; dh&acirc;&acute;ma-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May the gods protect us from whence Vish<I>n</I>u strode forth, by the seven stations of the earth!</p>  
<p>Even the names of the seven or eight &Acirc;dityas are not definitely known, at least not from the hymns of the Rig-veda. In II, 27, 1, we have a list of six names: Mitr&aacute;, Aryam&aacute;n, Bh&aacute;ga, V&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a, D&aacute;ksha, &Aacute;<I>m</I><I>s</I>a<I>h</I>. These with Aditi would give us seven. In VI, 50, 1, we have &Aacute;diti,</p>  
<p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> V&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a, Mitr&aacute;, Agn&iacute;, Aryam&aacute;n, Savit&aacute;r, and Bh&aacute;ga. In I, 89, 3, Bh&aacute;ga, Mitr&aacute;, &Aacute;diti, D&aacute;ksha, Aryam&aacute;n, V&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a, S&oacute;ma, A<I>s</I>v&iacute;n&acirc;, and S&aacute;rasvat&icirc; are invoked together with an old invocation, p&ucirc;&acute;rvay&acirc; ni-v&iacute;d&acirc;. In the Taittir&icirc;ya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka, I, 13, 3, we find the following list: 1. Mitra, 2. Varu<I>n</I>a, 3. Dh&acirc;tar, 4. Aryaman, 5. A<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, 6. Bhaga, 7. Indra, 8. Vivasvat, but there, too, the eighth son is said to be M&acirc;rt&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, or, according to the commentator, &Acirc;ditya.</p>  
<p>The character of Aditi as the mother of certain gods is also indicated by some of her epithets, such as r&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>a-putr&acirc;, having kings for her sons; su-putr&acirc;&acute;, having good sons; ugr&aacute;-putr&acirc;, having terrible sons:</p>  
<p>II, 27, 7. p&iacute;partu na<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> r&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>a-putr&acirc; &aacute;ti dv&eacute;sh&acirc;<I>m</I>si aryam&acirc;&acute; su-g&eacute;bhi<I>h</I>, b<I>ri</I>h&aacute;t mitr&aacute;sya v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>asya <I>s</I>&aacute;rma &uacute;pa sy&acirc;ma puru-v&icirc;&acute;r&acirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;rish<I>t</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May Aditi with her royal sons, may Aryaman carry us on easy roads across the hatreds; may we with many sons and without hurt obtain the great protection of Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a!</p>  
<p>III, 4, 11. barh&iacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> &acirc;st&acirc;m &aacute;diti<I>h</I> su-putr&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>May Aditi with her excellent sons sit on our sacred pile!</p>  
<p>VIII, 67, 11. p&aacute;rshi d&icirc;n&eacute; gabh&icirc;r&eacute; &acirc;&acute; &uacute;gra-putre <I>g</I>&iacute;gh&acirc;<I>m</I>sata<I>h</I>, m&acirc;&acute;ki<I>h</I> tok&aacute;sya na<I>h</I> rishat.</p>  
<p>Protect us, O goddess with terrible sons, from the enemy in shallow or deep water, and no one will hurt our offspring!</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi identified with other Deities.</p>  
<p>Aditi, however, for the very reason that she was originally intended for the Infinite, for something beyond the visible world, was liable to be identified with a number of finite deities which might all be represented as resting on Aditi, as participating in Aditi, as being Aditi. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 89, 10 (final). &aacute;diti<I>h</I> dya&ucirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> ant&aacute;riksham &aacute;diti<I>h</I> m&acirc;t&acirc;&acute; s&aacute;<I>h</I> pit&acirc;&acute; s&aacute;<I>h</I> putr&aacute;<I>h</I>, v&iacute;<I>s</I>ve dev&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> p&aacute;<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a <I>g</I>&aacute;n&acirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> <I>g</I>&acirc;t&aacute;m &aacute;diti<I>h</I> <I>g</I>&aacute;ni-tvam.</p>  
<p>Aditi is the heaven, Aditi the sky, Aditi the mother, the</p>  
<p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></A></p>  
<p>father, the son. All the gods are Aditi, the five clans, the past is Aditi, Aditi is the future.</p>  
<p>But although Aditi may thus be said to be everything, heaven, sky, and all the gods, no passage occurs, in the Rig-veda at least, where the special meaning of heaven or earth is expressed by Aditi. In X, 63, 3, where Aditi seems to mean sky, we shall see that it ought to be taken as a masculine, either in the sense of &Acirc;ditya, or as an epithet, unbounded, immortal. In I, 72, 9, we ought probably to read p<I>ri</I>thv&icirc;&acute; and pronounce p<I>ri</I>thuv&icirc;&acute;, and translate 'the wide Aditi, the mother with her sons;' and not, as Benfey does, 'the Earth, the eternal mother.'</p>  
<p>It is more difficult to determine whether in one passage Aditi has not been used in the sense of life after life, or as the name of the place whither people went after death, or of the deity presiding over that place. In a well-known hymn, supposed to have been uttered by <I>S</I>una<I>h</I><I>s</I>epa when on the point of being sacrificed by his own father, the following verse occurs:</p>  
<p>I, 24, 1. k&aacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> mahya&iacute; &aacute;ditaye p&uacute;na<I>h</I> d&acirc;t, pit&aacute;ram <I>k</I>a d<I>ri</I><I>s</I>&eacute;yam m&acirc;t&aacute;ram <I>k</I>a.</p>  
<p>Who will give us back to the great Aditi, that I may see father and mother?</p>  
<p>As the supposed utterer of this hymn is still among the living, Aditi can hardly be taken in the sense of earth, nor would the wish to see father and mother be intelligible in the mouth of one who is going to he sacrificed by his own father. If we discard the story of <I>S</I>una<I>h</I><I>s</I>epa, and take the hymn as uttered by any poet who craves for the protection of the gods in the presence of danger and death, then we may choose between the two meanings of earth or liberty, and translate, either, Who will give us back to the great earth? or, Who will restore us to the great Aditi, the goddess of freedom?</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi and Diti.</p>  
<p>There is one other passage which might receive light if we could take Aditi in the sense of Hades, but I give this translation as a mere guess:</p>  
<p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></A></p>  
<p>IV, 2, 11. r&acirc;y&eacute; <I>k</I>a na<I>h</I> su-apaty&acirc;&acute;ya deva d&iacute;tim <I>k</I>a r&acirc;&acute;sva &aacute;ditim urushya.</p>  
<p>That we may enjoy our wealth and healthy offspring, give us this life on earth, keep off the life to come! Cf. I, 152, 6.</p>  
<p>It should be borne in mind that Diti occurs in the Rig-veda thrice only, and in one passage it should, I believe, be changed into Aditi. This passage occurs in VII, 15, 12. tv&aacute;m agne v&icirc;r&aacute;-vat y&aacute;<I>s</I>a<I>h</I> dev&aacute;<I>h</I> ka savit&acirc;&acute; bh&aacute;ga<I>h</I>, d&iacute;ti<I>h</I> <I>k</I>a d&acirc;ti v&acirc;&acute;ryam. Here the name of Diti is so unusual, and that of Aditi, on the contrary, so natural, that I have little doubt that the poet had put the name of Aditi; and that later reciters, not aware of the occasional license of putting two short syllables instead of one, changed it into Aditi. If we remove this passage, then Diti, in the Rig-veda at least, occurs twice only, and each time together or in contrast with Aditi; cf. V, 62, 8, page <A HREF="#page_243">243</A>. I have no doubt, therefore, that Professor Roth is right when he says that Diti is a being without any definite conception, a mere reflex of Aditi. We can clearly watch her first emergence into existence through what is hardly more than a play of words, whereas in the epic and Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>ic literature this Diti (like the Suras) has grown into a definite person, one of the daughters of Daksha, the wife of Ka<I>s</I>yapa, the mother of the enemies of the gods, the Daityas. Such is the growth of legend, mythology and religion!</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi in her Moral Character.</p>  
<p>Besides the cosmical character of Aditi, which we have hitherto examined, this goddess has also assumed a very prominent moral character. Aditi, like Varu<I>n</I>a, delivers from sin. Why this should be so, we can still understand if we watch the transition which led from a purely cosmical to a moral conception of Aditi. Sin in the Veda is frequently conceived as a bond or a chain from which the repentant sinner wishes to be freed:</p>  
<p>VII, 86, 5. &aacute;va drugdh&acirc;&acute;ni p&iacute;try&acirc; s<I>ri</I><I>g</I>a na<I>h</I> &aacute;va y&acirc;&acute; vay&aacute;m <I>k</I>ak<I>ri</I>m&aacute; tan&ucirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I>, &aacute;va r&acirc;<I>g</I>an pa<I>s</I>u-t<I>r&iacute;</I>pam n&aacute; t&acirc;y&uacute;m s<I>ri</I><I>g</I>&aacute; vats&aacute;m n&aacute; d&acirc;&acute;mna<I>h</I> v&aacute;sish<I>th</I>am.</p>  
<p>Absolve us from the sins of our fathers, and from those</p>  
<p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A></p>  
<p>which we have committed with our own bodies. Release Vasish<I>th</I>a, O king, like a thief who has feasted on stolen cattle; release him like a calf from the rope&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_110"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>VIII, 67, 14. t&eacute; na<I>h</I> &acirc;sn&aacute;<I>h</I> v<I>r&iacute;</I>k&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;m &acirc;&acute;dity&acirc;sa<I>h</I> mum&oacute;<I>k</I>ata sten&aacute;m baddh&aacute;m-iva adite.</p>  
<p>O &Acirc;dityas, deliver us from the mouth of the wolves, like a bound thief, O Aditi! Cf. VIII, 67, 18.</p>  
<p><I>S</I>una<I>h</I><I>s</I>epa, who, as we saw before, wishes to be restored to the great Aditi, is represented as bound (dita) by ropes, and in V, 2, 7, we read:</p>  
<p><I>s</I>&uacute;na<I>h</I>-<I>s</I>&eacute;pam <I>k</I>it n&iacute;-ditam sah&aacute;sr&acirc;t y&ucirc;&acute;p&acirc;t amu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>h</I> &aacute;<I>s</I>amish<I>t</I>a h&iacute; s&aacute;<I>h</I>, ev&aacute; asm&aacute;t agne v&iacute; mumugdhi p&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&acirc;n h&oacute;tar (&iacute;ti) <I>k</I>ikitva<I>h</I> ih&aacute; t&uacute; ni-s&aacute;dya.</p>  
<p>O Agni, thou hast released the bound <I>S</I>una<I>h</I><I>s</I>epa from the stake, for he had prayed; thus take from us, too, these ropes, O sagacious Hotar, after thou hast settled here.</p>  
<p>Expressions like these, words like d&acirc;&acute;man, bond, n&iacute;-dita, bound, naturally suggested &aacute;-diti, the un-bound or unbounded, as one of those deities who could best remove the bonds of sin or misery. If we once realise this concatenation of thought and language, many passages of the Veda that seemed obscure, will become intelligible.</p>  
<p>VII, 51, 1. &acirc;dity&acirc;&acute;n&acirc;m &aacute;vas&acirc; n&ucirc;&acute;tanena saksh&icirc;m&aacute;hi <I>s</I>&aacute;rma<I>n</I>&acirc; <I>s</I>&aacute;m-tamena, an&acirc;g&acirc;<I>h</I>-tv&eacute; aditi-tv&eacute; tur&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> im&aacute;m ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m dadhatu <I>s</I>r&oacute;sham&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May we obtain the new favour of the &Acirc;dityas, their best protection; may the quick Maruts listen and place this sacrifice in guiltlessness and Aditi-hood.</p>  
<p>I have translated the last words literally, in order to make their meaning quite clear. &Acirc;&acute;gas has the same meaning as the Greek &#7940;&#0947;&#0959;&#0962;, guilt, abomination; an-&acirc;g&acirc;s-tv&aacute;, therefore, as applied to a sacrifice or to the man who makes it, means guiltlessness, purity. Aditi-tv&aacute;, Aditi-hood, has a similar meaning, it means freedom from bonds, from anything that hinders the proper performance of a religious act; it may come to mean perfection or holiness.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></A></p>  
<p>Aditi having once been conceived as granting this adititv&aacute;, soon assumed a very definite moral character, and hence the following invocations:</p>  
<p>I, 24, 15. &uacute;t ut-tam&aacute;m varu<I>n</I>a p&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>am asm&aacute;t &aacute;va adham&aacute;m v&iacute; madhyamim <I>s</I>rathaya, &aacute;tha vay&aacute;m &acirc;ditya vrat&eacute; t&aacute;va &aacute;n&acirc;gasa<I>h</I> &aacute;ditaye sy&acirc;ma.</p>  
<p>O Varu<I>n</I>a, lift the highest rope, draw off the lowest, remove the middle; then, O &Acirc;ditya, let us be in thy service free of guilt before Aditi.</p>  
<p>V, 82, 6. &aacute;n&acirc;gasa<I>h</I> &aacute;ditaye dev&aacute;sya savit&uacute;<I>h</I> <I>h</I> sav&eacute;, v&iacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc; v&acirc;m&acirc;&acute;ni dh&icirc;mahi.</p>  
<p>May we, guiltless before Aditi, and in the keeping of the god Savitar, obtain all goods! Professor Roth here translates Aditi by freedom or security.</p>  
<p>I, 162, 22. an&acirc;g&acirc;<I>h</I>-tv&aacute;m na<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>otu.</p>  
<p>May Aditi give us sinlessness! Cf. VII, 51, 1.</p>  
<p>IV, 12, 4. y&aacute;t <I>k</I>it h&iacute; te purusha-tr&acirc;&acute; yavish<I>th</I>a &aacute;<I>k</I>itti-bhi<I>h</I> <I>k</I>ak<I>ri</I>m&aacute; kit <I>k</I>it &acirc;&acute;ga<I>h</I>, k<I>ri</I>dh&iacute; s&uacute; asm&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;dite<I>h</I> &aacute;n&acirc;g&acirc;n v&iacute; &eacute;n&acirc;<I>m</I>si <I>s</I>i<I>s</I>ratha<I>h</I> v&iacute;shvak agne.</p>  
<p>Whatever, O youthful god, we have committed against thee, men as we are, whatever sin through thoughtlessness, make us guiltless of Aditi, loosen the sins on all sides, O Agni!</p>  
<p>VII, 93, 7. s&aacute;h agne en&acirc;&acute; n&aacute;mas&acirc; s&aacute;m-iddha<I>h</I> &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a mitr&aacute;m v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>am &iacute;ndram vo<I>k</I>e<I>h</I>, y&aacute;t s&icirc;m &acirc;&acute;ga<I>h</I> <I>k</I>ak<I>ri</I>m&aacute; t&aacute;t s&uacute; m<I>ri</I><I>l</I>a t&aacute;t aryam&acirc;&acute; &aacute;diti<I>h</I> <I>s</I>i<I>s</I>rathantu.</p>  
<p>O Agni, thou who hast been kindled with this adoration, greet Mitra, Varu<I>n</I>a, and Indra. Whatever sin we have committed, do thou pardon it! May Aryaman, Aditi loose it!</p>  
<p>Here the plural <I>s</I>i<I>s</I>rathantu should be observed, instead of the dual.</p>  
<p>VIII, 18, 6-7. &aacute;diti<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> d&iacute;v&acirc; pa<I>s</I>&uacute;m &aacute;diti<I>h</I> n&aacute;ktam &aacute;dvay&acirc;<I>h</I>, &aacute;diti<I>h</I> p&acirc;tu &aacute;<I>m</I>hasa<I>h</I> sad&acirc;&acute;-v<I>ri</I>dh&acirc;.</p>

<p>May Aditi by day protect our cattle, may she, who never deceives, protect by night; may she, with steady increase, protect us from evil!</p>  
<p>And may she, the thoughtful Aditi, come with help to</p>  
<p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="green">p. 259</font></A></p>  
<p>us by day; may she kindly bring happiness to us, and carry away all enemies! Cf. X, 36, 3, page <A HREF="#page_251">251</A>.</p>  
<p>X, 87, 18. &acirc;&acute; v<I>ri</I><I>s</I><I>k</I>yant&acirc;m &aacute;ditaye du<I>h</I>-&eacute;v&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May the evil-doers be cut off from Aditi! or literally, may they be rooted out before Aditi!</p>  
<p>II, 27, 24. &aacute;dite m&iacute;tra v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a ut&aacute; m<I>ri</I><I>l</I>a y&aacute;t va<I>h</I> vay&aacute;m <I>k</I>ak<I>ri</I>m&aacute; k&aacute;t <I>k</I>it &acirc;&acute;ga<I>h</I>, ur&uacute; a<I>s</I>y&acirc;m &aacute;bhayam <I>g</I>y&oacute;ti<I>h</I> indra m&acirc;&acute; na<I>h</I> d&icirc;rgh&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> abh&iacute; na<I>s</I>an t&aacute;misr&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Aditi, Mitra, and also Varu<I>n</I>a forgive, if we have committed any sin against you. May I obtain the wide and fearless light, O Indra! May not the long darkness reach us!</p>  
<p>VII, 87, 7. y&aacute;<I>h</I> m<I>ri</I><I>l</I>&aacute;y&acirc;ti <I>k</I>akr&uacute;she <I>k</I>it &acirc;&acute;ga<I>h</I> vay&aacute;m sy&acirc;ma v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>e &aacute;n&acirc;g&acirc;<I>h</I>, &aacute;nu vrat&acirc;&acute;ni &aacute;dite<I>h</I> <I>ri</I>dh&aacute;nta<I>h</I> yuy&aacute;m p&acirc;ta svast&iacute;-bhi<I>h</I> s&aacute;d&acirc; na<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May we be sinless before Varu<I>n</I>a, who is gracious even to him who has committed sin, and may we follow the laws of Aditi! Protect us always with your blessings!</p>  
<p>Lastly, Aditi, like all other gods, is represented as a giver of worldly goods, and implored to bestow them on her worshippers, or to protect them by her power:</p>  
<p>I, 43, 2. y&aacute;th&acirc; na<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> k&aacute;rat p&aacute;<I>s</I>ve n<I>r&iacute;</I>-bhya<I>h</I> y&aacute;th&acirc; g&aacute;ve, y&aacute;th&acirc; tok&acirc;&acute;ya rudr&iacute;yam.</p>  
<p>That Aditi may bring Rudra's favour to our cattle, our men, our cow, our offspring.</p>  
<p>I, 153, 3. p&icirc;p&acirc;&acute;ya dhen&uacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> <I>ri</I>t&acirc;&acute;ya <I>g</I>&aacute;n&acirc;ya mitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>&acirc; havi<I>h</I>-d&eacute;.</p>  
<p>Aditi, the cow, gives food to the righteous man, O Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, who makes offerings to the gods. Cf. VIII, 101, 15.</p>  
<p>I, 185, 3. aneh&aacute;<I>h</I> d&acirc;tr&aacute;m &aacute;dite<I>h</I> anarv&aacute;m huv&eacute;.</p>  
<p>I call for the unrivalled, uninjured gift of Aditi. Here Professor Roth again assigns to Aditi the meaning of freedom or security.</p>  
<p>VII, 40, 2. d&iacute;desh<I>t</I>u dev&icirc;&acute; &aacute;diti<I>h</I> r&eacute;k<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>.</p>

Cf. II, 40, 6; IV, 25, 5; X, 11, 2.</p>  
<p>The principal epithets of Aditi have been mentioned in the passages quoted above, and they throw no further light on the nature of the goddess. She was called dev&icirc;&acute;, goddess, again and again; another frequent epithet is anarv&aacute;n, uninjured, unscathed. Being invoked to grant light (VII, 82, 10), she is herself called luminous, <I>g</I>y&oacute;tishmat&icirc;, I, 136, 3; and sv&acirc;&acute;rvat&icirc;, heavenly. Being the goddess of the infinite expanse, she, even with greater right than the dawn, is called &uacute;r&ucirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;, VIII, 67, 12; uruvy&aacute;<I>k</I>as, V, 46, 6; uruvra<I>g</I>&acirc;, VIII, 67, 12; and possibly p<I>ri</I>thv&icirc;&acute; in I, 72, 9. As supporting everything, she is called dh&acirc;ray&aacute;tkshiti, supporting the earth, I, 136, 3; and vi<I>s</I>v&aacute;<I>g</I>any&acirc;, VII, 10, 4. To her sons she owes the names of r&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>aputr&acirc;, II, 27, 7; suputr&acirc;&acute;, III, 4, 11; and ugr&aacute;putr&acirc;, VIII, 67, 11: to her wealth that of sudravi<I>n</I>as, I, 94, 15, though others refer this epithet to Agni. There remains one name pasty&acirc;&#771;, IV, 55, 3; VIII, 27, 5, meaning housewife, which again indicates her character as mother of the gods.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>I have thus given all the evidence that can be collected from the Rig-veda as throwing light on the character of the goddess Aditi, and I have carefully excluded everything that rests only on the authority of the Ya<I>g</I>ur- or Atharva-vedas, or of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as and &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yakas, because in all they give beyond the repetitions from the Rig-veda, they seem to me to represent a later phase of thought that ought not to be mixed up with the more primitive conceptions of the Rig-veda. Not that the Rig-veda is free from what seems decidedly modern, or at all events secondary and late. But it is well to keep the great collections, as such,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></A></p>  
<p>separate, whatever our opinions may be as to the age of their component parts.</p>  
<p>In the Atharva-veda Aditi appears more unintelligible, more completely mythological, than in the Rig-veda. We read, for instance, Atharva-veda VII, 6, 1:</p>  
<p>&#8216;Aditi is the sky, Aditi is the welkin, Aditi is mother, is father, is son; all the gods are Aditi, and the five clans of men; Aditi is what was, Aditi is what will be.</p>  
<p>&#8216;We invoke for our protection the great mother of the well-ruling gods, the wife of <I>Ri</I>ta, the powerful, never-aging, far-spreading, the sheltering, well-guiding Aditi.&#8217;</p>  
<p>In the Taittir&icirc;ya-&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka and similar works the mythological confusion becomes greater still. Much valuable material for an analytical study of Aditi may be found in B. and R.'s Dictionary, and in several of Dr. Muir's excellent contributions to a knowledge of Vedic theogony and mythology.</p>  
<p align="center">Aditi as an Adjective.</p>  
<p>But although the foregoing remarks give as complete a description of Aditi as can be gathered from the hymns of the Rig-veda, a few words have to be added on certain passages where the word &aacute;diti occurs, and where it clearly cannot mean the goddess Aditi, as a feminine, but must be taken either as the name of a corresponding masculine deity, or as an adjective in the sense of unrestrained, independent, free.</p>  
<p>V, 59, 8. m&iacute;m&acirc;tu dya&uacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> v&icirc;t&aacute;ye na<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May the boundless Dy&uacute; (sky) help us to our repast!</p>  
<p>Here Aditi must either be taken in the sense of &Acirc;ditya, or better in its original sense of unbounded, as an adjective belonging to Dy&uacute;, the masculine deity of the sky.</p>  
<p>Dy&uacute; or the sky is called &aacute;diti or unbounded in another passage, X, 63, 3:</p>  
<p>y&eacute;bhya<I>h</I> m&acirc;t&acirc;&acute; m&aacute;dhu-mat p&iacute;nvate p&aacute;ya<I>h</I> p&icirc;y&ucirc;&acute;sham dya&ucirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> &aacute;dri-barh&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The gods to whom their mother yields the sweet milk, and the unbounded sky, as firm as a rock, their food.</p>  
<p>IV, 3, 8. kath&acirc;&acute; <I>s</I>&aacute;rdh&acirc;ya mar&uacute;t&acirc;m <I>ri</I>t&acirc;&acute;ya kath&acirc;&acute; s&ucirc;r&eacute; b<I>ri</I>hat&eacute; p<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>y&aacute;m&acirc;na<I>h</I>, pr&aacute;ti brava<I>h</I> &aacute;ditaye tur&acirc;&acute;ya.</p>  
<p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="green">p. 262</font></A></p>  
<p>How wilt thou tell it to the host of the Maruts, how to the bright heaven, when thou art asked? How to the quick Aditi?</p>  
<p>Here Aditi cannot be the goddess, partly on account of the masculine gender of tur&acirc;&acute;ya, partly because she is never called quick. Aditi must here be the name of one of the &Acirc;dityas, or it may refer back to s&ucirc;r&eacute; b<I>ri</I>hat&eacute;. It can hardly be joined, as Professor Roth proposes, with <I>s</I>&aacute;rdh&acirc;ya mar&uacute;t&acirc;m, owing to the intervening s&ucirc;r&eacute; b<I>ri</I>hat&eacute;.</p>  
<p>In several passages &aacute;diti, as an epithet, refers to Agni:</p>  
<p>IV, 1, 20 (final). v&iacute;<I>s</I>vesh&acirc;m &aacute;diti<I>h</I> ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&iacute;y&acirc;n&acirc;m v&iacute;<I>s</I>vesh&acirc;m &aacute;tithi<I>h</I> m&acirc;&acute;nush&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;m.</p>  
<p>He, Agni, the Aditi, or the freest, among all the gods; he the guest among all men.</p>  
<p>The same play on the words &aacute;diti and &aacute;tithi occurs again:</p>  
<p>VII, 9, 3. &aacute;m&ucirc;ra<I>h</I> kav&iacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;diti<I>h</I> viv&aacute;sv&acirc;n su-sa<I>m</I>s&aacute;t mitr&aacute;<I>h</I> &aacute;tithi<I>h</I> <I>s</I>iv&aacute;<I>h</I> na<I>h</I>, <I>k</I>itr&aacute;-bh&acirc;nu<I>h</I> ush&aacute;s&acirc;m bh&acirc;ti &aacute;gre.</p>  
<p>The wise poet, Aditi, Vivasvat, Mitra with his good company, our welcome guest, he (Agni) with brilliant light came at the head of the dawns.</p>  
<p>Here, though I admit that several renderings are possible, Aditi is meant as a name of Agni, to whom the whole hymn is addressed, and who, as usual, is identified with other gods, or, at all events, invoked by their names. We may translate &aacute;diti<I>h</I> viv&aacute;sv&acirc;n by 'the brilliant Aditi,' or 'the unchecked, the brilliant,' or by 'the boundless Vivasvat,' but on no account can we take &aacute;diti here as the female goddess. The same applies to VIII, 19, 14, where Aditi, unless we suppose the goddess brought in&nbsp;in the most abrupt way, must be taken as a name of Agni; while in X, 92, 14, &aacute;ditim anarv&aacute;<I>n</I>am, to judge from other epithets given in the same verse, has most likely to be taken again as an appellative of Agni. In some passages it would, no doubt, be possible to take Aditi as the name of a female deity, if it were certain that no other meaning could be assigned to this word. But if we once know that Aditi was the name of a male deity also, the structure of these passages becomes far more perfect, if we take Aditi in that sense:</p>  
<p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="green">p. 263</font></A></p>  
<p>IV, 39, 3. &aacute;n&acirc;gasam t&aacute;m &aacute;diti<I>h</I> k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>otu s&aacute;<I>h</I> mitr&eacute;<I>n</I>a v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>ena sa-<I>g</I>&oacute;sh&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May Aditi make him free from sin, he who is allied with Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>We have had several passages in which Aditi, the female deity, is represented as sa<I>g</I>&oacute;sh&acirc;<I>h</I> or allied with other &Acirc;dityas, but if s&aacute;<I>h</I> is the right reading here, Aditi in this verse can only be the male deity. The pronoun s&aacute; cannot refer to t&aacute;m.</p>  
<p>With regard to other passages, such as IX, 81, 5; VI, 51, 3, and even some of those translated above in which Aditi has been taken as a female goddess, the question must be left open till further evidence can be obtained. There is only one more passage which has been often discussed, and where &aacute;diti was supposed to have the meaning of earth:</p>  
<p>VII, 18, 8. du<I>h</I>-&acirc;dhya&#771;<I>h</I> &aacute;ditim srev&aacute;yanta<I>h</I> a<I>k</I>et&aacute;sa<I>h</I> v&iacute; <I>g</I>ag<I>ri</I>bhre p&aacute;rush<I>n</I>&icirc;m.</p>  
<p>Professor Roth in one of his earliest essays translated this line, 'The evil-disposed wished to dry the earth, the fools split the Parush<I>n</I>&icirc;,' and he supposed its meaning to have been that the enemies of Sud&acirc;s swam across the Parush<I>n</I>&icirc; in order to attack Sud&acirc;s. We might accept this translation, if it could be explained how by throwing themselves into the river, the enemies made the earth dry, though even then there would remain this difficulty that, with the exception of one other doubtful passage, discussed before, &aacute;diti never means earth. We might possibly translate: 'The evil-disposed, the fools, laid dry and divided the boundless river Parush<I>n</I>&icirc;.' This would be a description of a stratagem very common in ancient warfare, viz. diverting the course of a river and laying its original bed dry by digging a new channel, and thus dividing the old river. This is also the sense accepted by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, who does not say that vigraha means dividing the waves of a river, as Professor Roth renders k&ucirc;labheda, but that it means dividing or cutting through its banks. In the Dictionary Professor Roth assigns to &aacute;diti in this passage the meaning of endless, inexhaustible.</p>

<p align="center">Kan&aacute;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:12:5">5</A>. Nothing is more difficult in the interpretation of the Veda than to gain an accurate knowledge of the power of particles and conjunctions. The particle <I>k</I>an&aacute;, we are told, is used both affirmatively and negatively, a statement which shows better than anything else the uncertainty to which every translation of Vedic hymns is as yet exposed. It is perfectly true that in the text of the Rig-veda, as we now read it, kan&aacute; means both indeed and no. But this very fact shows that we ought to distinguish where the first collectors of the Vedic hymns have not distinguished, and that while in the former case we read <I>k</I>an&aacute;, we ought in the latter to read <I>k</I>a n&aacute;.</p>

<p>Many more passages might be given to illustrate the use of <I>k</I>an&aacute; or k&aacute;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>an&aacute; and its derivatives in negative sentences.</p>  
<p>Cf. I, 105, 3; 136, 1; 139, 5; II, 16, 3; 23, 5; 28, 6; III, 36, 4; IV, 31, 9; V, 42, 6; 82, 2; VI, 3, 2; 20, 4; 47, 1; 3; 48, 17; 54, 9; 59, 4; 69, 8; 75, 16; VII, 32, 1; 19; 59, 3; 82, 7; 104, 3; VIII, 19, 6; 23, 15; 24, 15; 28, 4; 47, 7; 64, 27, 66, 13; 68, 19; IX, 61, 27; 69, 6; 114, 4; X, 33, 9; 39, 11; 48, 5; 49, 10; 59, 8; 62, 9; 85, 3; 86, 11; 95, 1; 112, 9; 119, 6; 7; 128, 4; 129, 2; 152, 1; 168, 3; 185, 2.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">I d. In a few passages, however, we find the indefinite pronoun k&aacute;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>an&aacute; used in sentences which are not negative:</div></p>

<p>II. We now come to passages in which <I>k</I>an&aacute; stands for <I>k</I>a n&aacute;, and therefore renders the sentence negative without any further negative particle.

<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:12:6">6</A>. Considering the particular circumstances mentioned in this and the preceding hymn, of Indra's forsaking his companions, the Maruts, or even scorning their help, one feels strongly tempted to take ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as in its etymological sense of leaving or forsaking, and to translate, by his forsaking you, or, if he should forsake you. The poet may have meant the word to convey that idea, which no doubt would be most appropriate here; but it must be confessed, at the same time, that in other passages where ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as occurs, that meaning could hardly be ascribed to it. Strange as it may seem, no one who is acquainted with the general</p>  
<p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="green">p. 268</font></A></p>  
<p>train of thought in the Vedic hymns can fail to see that ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as in most passages means attack, onslaught; it may be even the instrument of an attack, a weapon. How it should come to take this meaning is indeed difficult to explain, and I do not wonder that Professor Roth in his Dictionary simply renders the word by forlornness, need, danger, or by estrangement, unkindness, malignity. But let us look at the passages. and we shall see that these abstract conceptions are quite out of place:</p>  
<p>VIII, 47, 7. n&aacute; t&aacute;m tigm&aacute;m <I>k</I>an&aacute; ty&aacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I> n&aacute; dr&acirc;sad abh&iacute; t&aacute;m gur&uacute;.</p>  
<p>No sharp blow, no heavy one, shall come near him whom you protect.</p>  
<p>Here the two adjectives tigm&aacute;, sharp, and gur&uacute;, heavy, point to something tangible, and I feel much inclined, to take ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as in this passage as a weapon, as something that is let off with violence, rather than in the more abstract sense of onslaught.</p>  
<p>I, 169, 1. mah&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>it asi ty&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I> var&ucirc;t&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Thou art the shielder from a great attack.</p>

<p>Who is against your great attack? Protect us with your help, O A<I>s</I>vins, ye strong ones.</p>  
<p>Here Professor Roth seems to join mah&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>it ty&aacute;<I>g</I>asa<I>h</I> abh&icirc;&acute;ke urushy&aacute;tam, but in that case it would be impossible to construe the first words, k&aacute;<I>h</I> v&acirc;m.</p>  
<p>I, 119, 8. &aacute;ga<I>k</I><I>kh</I>atam k<I>r&iacute;</I>pam&acirc;<I>n</I>am par&acirc;-v&aacute;ti pit&uacute;<I>h</I> sv&aacute;sya ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; n&iacute;-b&acirc;dhitam.</p>  
<p>You went from afar to the suppliant, who had been struck down by the violence of his own father.</p>  
<p>According to Professor Roth ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as would here mean forlornness, need, or danger. But n&iacute;b&acirc;dhita is a strong verb, as we may see in</p>  
<p>VIII, 64, 2. pad&acirc;&acute; pa<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute;n ar&acirc;dh&aacute;sa<I>h</I> n&iacute; b&acirc;dhasva mah&acirc;&acute;n asi.</p>

<p>VI, 62, 10. s&aacute;nutyena ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; m&aacute;rtyasya vanushyat&acirc;&acute;m &aacute;pi <I>s</I>&icirc;rsh&acirc;&acute; vav<I>ri</I>ktam.</p>  
<p>By your covert attack turn back the heads of those even who harass the mortal.</p>  
<p>Though this passage may seem less decisive, yet it is difficult to see how ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; could here, according to Professor Roth, be rendered by forlornness or danger. Something is required by which enemies can be turned back. Nor can it be doubtful that <I>s</I>&icirc;rsh&acirc;&acute; is governed by vav<I>ri</I>ktam, meaning turn back their heads, for the same expression occurs again in I, 33, 5. p&aacute;r&acirc; <I>k</I>it <I>s</I>&icirc;rsh&acirc;&acute; vav<I>ri</I><I>g</I>u<I>h</I> t&eacute; indra &aacute;ya<I>g</I>v&acirc;na<I>h</I> y&aacute;<I>g</I>va-bhi<I>h</I> sp&aacute;rdham&acirc;n&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Professor Ben fey translates this verse by, 'Kopf&uuml;ber flohn sie alle vor dir;' but it may be rendered more literally, 'These lawless people fighting with the pious turned away their heads.'</p>  
<p>X, 144, 6. ev&aacute; t&aacute;t &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> &iacute;ndun&acirc; dev&eacute;shu <I>k</I>it dh&acirc;ray&acirc;te m&aacute;hi ty&aacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Indeed through this draught Indra can hold out against that great attack even among the gods.</p>  
<p>X, 79, 6. k&iacute;m dev&eacute;shu ty&aacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I> &eacute;na<I>h</I> <I>k</I>akartha.</p>  
<p>What insult, what sin hast thou committed among the gods?</p>  
<p>In these two passages the meaning of ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as as attack or assault is at least as appropriate as that proposed by Professor Roth, estrangement, malignity.</p>  
<p>There remains one passage, VI, 3, 1. y&aacute;m tv&aacute;m mitr&eacute;<I>n</I>a v&aacute;ru<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> sa-<I>g</I>&oacute;sh&acirc;<I>h</I> d&eacute;va p&acirc;&acute;si ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; m&aacute;rtam &aacute;<I>m</I>ha<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>I confess that the construction of this verse is not clear to me, and I doubt whether it is possible to use ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; as a verbal noun governing an accusative. If this were possible, one might translate, 'The mortal whom thou, O God (Agni),</p>  
<p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="green">p. 270</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Varu<I>n</I>a, together with Mitra, protectest by pushing back evil.' More probably we should translate, 'Whom thou protectest from evil by thy might.'</p>  
<p>If it be asked how ty&aacute;<I>g</I>as can possibly have the meaning which has been assigned to it in all the passages in which it occurs; viz. that of forcibly attacking or pushing away, we can only account for it by supposing that tya<I>g</I>, before it came to mean to leave, meant to push off, to drive away with violence (verstossen instead of verlassen). This meaning may still be perceived occasionally in the use of tya<I>g</I>; e.&nbsp;g. dev&acirc;s tya<I>g</I>antu m&acirc;m, may the gods forsake me! i.&nbsp;e. may the gods drive me away! Even in the latest Sanskrit tya<I>g</I> is used with regard to an arrow that is let off. 'To expel' is expressed by nis-tya<I>g</I>. Those who believe in the production of new roots by the addition of prepositional prefixes might possibly see in tya<I>g</I> an original ati-a<I>g</I>, to drive off; but, however that may be, there is evidence enough to show that tya<I>g</I> expressed originally a more violent act of separation than it does in ordinary Sanskrit, though here, too, passages occur in which tya<I>g</I> may be translated by to throw, to fling; for instance, khe dh&ucirc;li<I>m</I> yas tya<I>g</I>ed u<I>k</I><I>k</I>air m&ucirc;rdhni tasyaiva s&acirc; patet, he who throws up dust in the air, it will fall on his head. Ind. Spr. 1582.</p>  
<p>Mu<I>k</I>, too, is used in a similar manner; for instance, va<I>g</I>ram mokshyate t&eacute; mahendra<I>h</I>, Mah&acirc;bh. XIV, 263. Cf. Dhammapada, ver. 389.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:166:13:1">1</A>. <I>S</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa, masc., means a spell, whether for good or for evil, a blessing as well as a curse. It means a curse, or, at all events, a calumny:</p>  
<p>I, 18, 3. m&acirc;&acute; na<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa<I>h</I> &aacute;rarusha<I>h</I> dh&ucirc;rt&iacute;<I>h</I> pr&aacute;<I>n</I>ak m&aacute;rtyasya.</p>

<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">It means blessing:</div></p>

<p>Let not an evil-speaking enemy conquer us; may we, enjoying good report, increase by our. prayers!</p>  
<p>In some passages, however, as pointed out by Grassmann, <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa may best be rendered by singer, praiser. Grassmann marks one passage only,</p>  
<p>II, 26, 1. <I>ri</I><I>g</I>&uacute;<I>h</I> &iacute;t <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa<I>h</I> vanavat vanushyat&aacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May the righteous singer conquer his enemies.</p>  
<p>He admits, however, doubtfully, the explanation of B.&nbsp;R., that <I>ri</I><I>g</I>&uacute;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa<I>h</I> may be taken as one word, meaning, 'requiring the right.' This explanation seems surrendered by B.&nbsp;R. in the second edition of their Dictionary, and I doubt whether <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa<I>h</I> can mean here anything but singer. That being so, the same meaning seems more appropriate in other verses also, which I formerly translated differently, e.&nbsp;g.</p>  
<p>VII, 56, 19. im&eacute; <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sam vanushyat&aacute;<I>h</I> n&iacute; p&acirc;nti.</p>  
<p>They, the Maruts, protect the singer from his enemy.</p>  
<p>Lastly, <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sa means praise, the spell addressed by men to the gods, or prayer:</p>  
<p>I, 33, 7. pr&aacute; sunvat&aacute;<I>h</I> stuvat&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sam &acirc;va<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Thou hast regarded the prayer of him who offers libation and praise.</p>  
<p>X, 42, 6. y&aacute;smin vay&aacute;m dadhim&aacute; <I>s</I>&aacute;<I>m</I>sam &iacute;ndre.</p>  
<p>Indra in whom we place our hope. Cf. &acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>s, Westergaard, Radices Linguae Sanscritae, s.&nbsp;v. <I>s</I>a<I>m</I>s.</p>

Pollux gives two forms, &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0957;&#0945; and &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0945;, (Pollux X, 166 &#0960;&#0964;&#0945;&#0957;&#0940;&#0954;&#0945; &#0948;&#8051; &#7952;&#0963;&#0964;&#0953; &#0968;&#0943;&#0945;&#0952;&#0959;&#0962; &#7969; &#7952;&#0957; &#0964;&#0959;&#8150;&#0962; &#7936;&#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#0943;&#0959;&#0953;&#0962; &#7971;&#0957; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0945;&#0957; &#0954;&#0945;&#0955;&#0959;&#8166;&#0963;&#0953;&#0957;.

In Old Norse we have hanp-r, in A. S. h&aelig;nep, hemp, Old High-Germ. hanaf.</p>  
<p>The occurrence of the word <I>s</I>a<I>n</I>a is of importance as showing at how early a time the Aryans of India were acquainted with the uses and the name of hemp. Our word hemp, the A. S. h&aelig;nep, the Old Norse hanp-r, are all borrowed from Latin cannabis, which, like other borrowed words, has undergone the regular changes required by Grimm's law in Low-German, and also in High-German. hanaf. The Slavonic nations seem to have borrowed their word for hemp (Lith. kanape&#771;) from the Goths, the Celtic nations (Ir. canaib) from the Romans (cf. Kuhn, Beitr&auml;ge, vol. ii, p. 382). The Latin cannabis is borrowed from Greek, and the Greeks, to judge from the account of Herodotus, most likely adopted the word from the Aryan Thracians and Scythians (Her. IV, 74; Pictet, Les Aryens, vol. i, p. 314). &#0922;&#0940;&#0957;&#0957;&#0946;&#0953;&#0962; being a foreign word, it would be useless to attempt an explanation of the final element bis, which is added to <I>s</I>a<I>n</I>a, the Sanskrit word for hemp. It may be visa, fibre, or it may be anything else. Certain it is that the main element in the name of hemp was the same among the settlers in Northern India, and among the Thracians and Scythians through whom the Greeks first became acquainted with hemp.</p>  
<p>The history of the word &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0957;&#0945;&#0946;&#0953;&#0962; must be kept distinct from that of the Greek &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0957;&#0945; or &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0945;, reed. Both spellings occur, for Pollux, X, 166, writes &#0960;&#0964;&#0945;&#0957;&#0940;&#0954;&#0945; &#0948;&#8051; &#7952;&#0963;&#0964;&#0953; &#0968;&#0943;&#0945;&#0952;&#0959;&#0962; &#7969; &#7952;&#0957; &#0964;&#0959;&#8150;&#0962; &#7936;&#0954;&#0945;&#0964;&#0943;&#0959;&#0953;&#0962; &#7971;&#0957; &#0954;&#0945;&#8054; &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0945;&#0957; &#0954;&#0945;&#0955;&#0959;&#8166;&#0963;&#0953;&#0957;, but VII, 176, &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0957;&#0945;&#0953; &#0948;&#8050; &#0964;&#8056; &#7952;&#0954; &#0954;&#0945;&#0957;&#0940;&#0946;&#0969;&#0957; &#0960;&#0955;&#8051;&#0947;&#0956;&#0945;. This word &#0954;&#0940;&#0957;&#0957;&#0945; may be the same as the Sanskrit <I>s</I>a<I>n</I>a, only with this difference, that it was retained as common property by Greeks and Indians before they separated, and was applied differently in later times by the one and the other.</P>
