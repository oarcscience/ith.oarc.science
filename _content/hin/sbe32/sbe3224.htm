<p>1. Endowed with exceeding vigour and power, the singers, the never flinching, the immovable, the impetuous, the most beloved and most manly, have decked themselves with their glittering ornaments, a few only <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:1:1">1</A>, like the heavens with the stars,</p>  
<p>2. When you have seen your way through the clefts, like birds, O Maruts, on whatever road it be <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:2:1">1</A>, then the casks (clouds) on your chariots trickle everywhere, and you pour out the honey-like fatness (the rain) for him who praises you.</p>  
<p>3. At their racings the earth shakes, as if broken <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:3:1">1</A>, when on the (heavenly) paths they harness (their deer) for victory <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:3:2">2</A>. They the sportive, the roaring, with bright spears, the shakers (of the clouds) have themselves glorified their greatness.</p>  
<p>4. That youthful company (of the Maruts), with their spotted horses <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:4:1">1</A>, moves by itself; hence <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:4:2">2</A> it exercises lordship, invested with powers. Thou indeed art true, thou searchest out sin <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:4:3">3</A>, thou art without blemish. Therefore the manly host will help this prayer.</p>  
<p>5. We speak after the kind of our old father, our tongue goes forth at the sight <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:5:1">1</A> of the Soma: when the singers (the Maruts) had joined Indra in deed <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:5:2">2</A>, then only they took their holy names;&#8212;</p>  
<p>6. These Maruts, armed with beautiful rings, obtained splendours for their glory <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:6:1">1</A>, they obtained <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:6:2">2</A> rays, and men to celebrate them; nay, armed with daggers, speeding along, and fearless, they found the beloved domain of the Maruts <A HREF="sbe3224.htm#an_1:87:6:3">3</A>.</p>

<p>This hymn is ascribed to Gotama. No verse in SV., VS., AV.</p>  
<p>Verse 2 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 7.</p>  
<p>Verse 3 = TS. IV, 3, 13, 7.</p>  
<p>Verse 6 = TS. II, 1, 11, 2; IV, 2, 11, 2.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:1:1">1</A>. K&eacute; <I>k</I>it refers to the Maruts, who are represented as gradually rising or just showing themselves, as yet only few in number, like the first stars in the sky. K&eacute; <I>k</I>it, some, is opposed to sarve, all. The same expression occurs again, V, 52, 12, where the Maruts are compared to a few thieves. B. and R., and those who follow them, translate usr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> iva st<I>r&iacute;</I>-bhi<I>h</I> by 'like cows marked with stars on their foreheads.' Such cows no doubt exist, but they can hardly be said to become visible by these frontal stars, as the Maruts by their ornaments. We must take usr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> here in the same sense as dy&acirc;&acute;va<I>h</I>; II, 34, 2, it is said that the Maruts were perceived dy&acirc;&acute;va<I>h</I> n&aacute; st<I>r&iacute;</I>-bhi<I>h</I>, like the heavens with the stars.</p>  
<p>I, 166, 11. d&ucirc;re-d<I>r&iacute;</I><I>s</I>a<I>h</I> y&eacute; divy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>-iva st<I>r&iacute;</I>-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Who are visible far away, like the heavens (or heavenly beings) by the stars.</p>  
<p>And the same is said of Agni, II, 2, 5. dya&uacute;<I>h</I> n&aacute; st<I>r&iacute;</I>bhi<I>h</I> <I>k</I>itayat r&oacute;das&icirc; (&iacute;ti) &aacute;nu. St<I>r&iacute;</I>bhi<I>h</I> occurs I, 68, 5; IV, 7, 3; VI, 49, 3; 12. It always means stars, and the meaning of rays (strahl) rests, as yet, on etymological authority only. The evening sky would, no doubt, be more appropriate than usr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, which applies chiefly to the dawn. But in the Indian mind, the two dawns, i.&nbsp;e. the dawn and the gloaming, are so closely united and identified, that their names, too, are frequently interchangeable.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:2:1">1</A>. I translate yay&iacute; not by a goer, a traveller, i.&nbsp;e. the</p>  
<p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></A></p>  
<p>cloud (this is the explanation proposed by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, and adopted by Professor Benfey), but by path. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a (TS. IV, 3, 13, 7) renders yayim by gatim. Etymologically yay&iacute; may mean either, and in some passages I feel doubtful as to which is the more appropriate meaning. But in parallel passages yay&iacute; is clearly replaced by y&acirc;&acute;ma. Thus:</p>  
<p>VIII, 7, 2. y&aacute;t&#8212;y&acirc;&acute;mam <I>s</I>ubhr&acirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;<I>k</I>idhvam.</p>  
<p>When you, bright Maruts, have seen your way.</p>  
<p>See also VIII, 7, 4. y&aacute;t y&acirc;&acute;mam y&acirc;&acute;nti v&acirc;y&uacute;-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>When they (the Maruts) go on their path with the winds.</p>  
<p>VIII, 7, 14. &aacute;dhi-iva y&aacute;t gir&icirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;&acute;m y&acirc;&acute;mam <I>s</I>ubhr&acirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;<I>k</I>idhvam.</p>  
<p>When you, bright Maruts, had seen your way, as it were, from above the mountains.</p>  
<p>The same phrase occurs, even without y&acirc;&acute;ma or yay&iacute;, in </p>  
<p>V, 55, 7. n&aacute; p&aacute;rvat&acirc;<I>h</I> n&aacute; nady&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> varanta va<I>h</I> y&aacute;tra &aacute;<I>k</I>idhvam maruta<I>h</I> g&aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ata &iacute;t u t&aacute;t.</p>  
<p>Not mountains, not rivers, keep you back; where you have seen (your way), there you go.</p>  
<p>Though yay&iacute; does not occur frequently in the Rig-veda, the meaning of path seems throughout more applicable than that of traveller.</p>  
<p>V, 87, 5. tvesh&aacute;<I>h</I> yay&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Your path, O Maruts, is blazing.</p>  
<p>V, 73, 7. ugr&aacute;<I>h</I> v&acirc;m kakuh&aacute;<I>h</I> yay&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Fearful is your pass on high.</p>  
<p>I, 51, 11. ugr&aacute;<I>h</I> yayim n&iacute;<I>h</I> ap&aacute;<I>h</I> sr&oacute;tas&acirc; asri<I>g</I>at.</p>  
<p>The fearful Indra sent the waters forth on their way streaming.</p>  
<p>X, 92, 5. pr&aacute;&#8212;yay&iacute;n&acirc; yanti s&iacute;ndhava<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The waters go forth on their path.</p>  
<p>Ludwig takes k&oacute;<I>s</I>a as buckets on the chariots of the Maruts, which seems right.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:3:1">1</A>. Cf. I, 37, 8, page 75. There is no authority for S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's explanation of vithur&acirc;&acute;-iva, the earth trembles like a widow. Vithur&acirc;&acute; occurs several times in the Rig-veda, but never in the sense of widow. Thus:</p>  
<p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></A></p>  
<p>I, 168, 6. y&aacute;t <I>k</I>yav&aacute;yatha vithur&acirc;&acute;-iva s&aacute;m-hitam.</p>  
<p>When you, Maruts, throw down what is compact, like brittle things.</p>  
<p>I, 186, 2; VI, 25, 3; 46, 6; VIII, 96, 2; X, 77, 4 (vithury&aacute;ti). The Maruts themselves are called &aacute;vithura in verse 1. Spiegel compares the Zend aiwithura. As to &aacute;<I>g</I>ma and y&acirc;&acute;ma, see I, 37, 8, page <A HREF="sbe3218.htm#page_75">75</A>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:3:2">2</A>. <I>S</I>&uacute;bh is one of those words to which it is very difficult always to assign a definite special meaning. Being derived from <I>s</I>ubh, to shine, the commentator has no difficulty in explaining it by splendour, beauty; sometimes by water. But although <I>s</I>&uacute;bh means originally splendour, and is used in that sense in many passages, yet there are others where so vague a meaning seems very inappropriate. In our verse S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a proposes two translations, either, 'When the Maruts harness the clouds,' or, 'When the Maruts harness their chariots, for the bright rain-water.' Now the idea that the Maruts harness their chariots in order to make the clouds yield their rain, can hardly be expressed by the simple word subh&eacute;, i.&nbsp;e. for brightness' sake. As the Maruts are frequently praised for their glittering ornaments, their splendour might be intended in this passage, as it certainly is in others. Thus:</p>  
<p>I, 85, 3. y&aacute;t <I>s</I>ubh&aacute;yante a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&iacute;-bhi<I>h</I> tan&ucirc;&acute;shu <I>s</I>ubhr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> dadhire vir&uacute;kmata<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>When the Maruts adorn themselves with glittering ornaments, the brilliant ones put bright weapons on their bodies.</p>  
<p>VII, 56, 6. subh&acirc;&acute; s&oacute;bhish<I>th</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>, <I>s</I>riy&acirc;&acute; s&aacute;m-mi<I>s</I>l&acirc;<I>h</I>, &oacute;<I>g</I>a<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I> ugr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The most brilliant by their brilliancy, united with beauty, terrible by terrors.</p>  
<p>In I, 64, 4, I have translated v&aacute;ksha<I>h</I>-su rukm&acirc;&acute;n &aacute;dhi yetire <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; by 'they fix gold (chains) on their chests for beauty.' And the same meaning is applicable to I, 117, 5, subh&eacute; rukm&aacute;m n&aacute; dar<I>s</I>at&aacute;m n&iacute;-kh&acirc;tam, and other passages: IV, 51, 6; VI, 63, 6.</p>  
<p>But in our verse and others which we shall examine, beauty and brilliancy would be very weak renderings for</p>  
<p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></A></p>  
<p><I>s</I>ubh&eacute;. 'When they harnessed their chariots or their deer for the sake of beauty,' means nothing, or, at least, very little. I take, therefore, <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; in this and similar phrases in the sense of triumph or glory or victory. 'When they harness their chariots for to conquer,' implies brilliancy, glory, victory, but it conveys at the same time a tangible meaning. Let us now see whether the same meaning is appropriate in other passages:</p>  
<p>I, 23, 11. <I>g</I>&aacute;yat&acirc;m-iva tanyatu<I>h</I> mar&uacute;t&acirc;m eti dh<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>uy&acirc;&acute; y&aacute;t <I>s</I>&uacute;bham y&acirc;th&aacute;<I>n</I>a nara<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The thundering voice of the Maruts comes fiercely, like that of conquerors, when you go to conquer, O men!</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'When you go to the brilliant place of sacrifice.' Wilson: 'When you accept the auspicious (offering).' Benfey: 'Wenn ihr euren Schmuck nehmt.'</p>  
<p>V, 57, 2. y&acirc;thana <I>s</I>&uacute;bham, you go to conquer. Cf. V, 55, 1.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'For the sake of water, or, in a chariot.'</p>  
<p>V, 52, 8. <I>s</I>&aacute;rdha<I>h</I> m&acirc;&acute;rutam &uacute;t <I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa&#8212;ut&aacute; sma t&eacute; <I>s</I>ubhe n&aacute;ra<I>h</I> pr&aacute; syandr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> yu<I>g</I>ata tm&aacute;n&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Praise the host of the Maruts, whether they, the men, the quickly moving, have by themselves harnessed (the chariots) for conquest.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'For the sake of water.' Cf. X, 105, 3.</p>  
<p>V, 57, 3. <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; y&aacute;t ugr&acirc;<I>h</I> p<I>r&iacute;</I>shat&icirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;yugdhvam.</p>  
<p>When you have harnessed the deer for conquest.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'For the sake of water.'</p>  
<p>III, 26, 4. <I>s</I>ubh&eacute;&#8212;p&iacute;shat&icirc;<I>h</I> ayukshata.</p>  
<p>They had harnessed the deer for victory.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'They had harnessed in the water the deer together (with the fires).'</p>  
<p>V, 63, 5. r&aacute;tham yu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ate mar&uacute;ta<I>h</I> <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; su-kh&aacute;m s&ucirc;&acute;ra<I>h</I> n&aacute;&#8212;g&oacute;-ish<I>t</I>ishu.</p>  
<p>The Maruts harness the chariot meet for conquest, like a hero in battles.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'For the sake of water.'</p>  
<p>I, 88, 2. <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; k&aacute;m y&acirc;nti&#8212;&aacute;<I>s</I>vai<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The Maruts go on their horses towards conquest.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'In order to brighten the worshipper, or, for the sake of water.'</p>  
<p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></A></p>  
<p>I, 119, 3. s&aacute;m y&aacute;t mith&aacute;<I>h</I> pasp<I>ri</I>dh&acirc;n&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> &aacute;gmata <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; makh&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;mit&acirc;<I>h</I> <I>g</I>&acirc;y&aacute;va<I>h</I> r&aacute;<I>n</I>e.</p>  
<p>When striving with each other they came together, for the sake of glory, the brisk (Maruts), immeasurable (in strength), panting for victory in the fight.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'For the sake of brilliant wealth.'</p>  
<p>VII, 82, 5. mar&uacute;t-bhi<I>h</I> ugr&aacute;<I>h</I> s&uacute;bham any&aacute;<I>h</I> &icirc;yate.</p>  
<p>The other, the fearful (Indra), goes with the Maruts to glory.</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'He takes brilliant decoration.'</p>  
<p>I, 167, 6. &acirc;&acute; asth&acirc;payanta yuvat&iacute;m y&uacute;v&acirc;na<I>h</I> <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; n&iacute;mi<I>s</I>l&acirc;m.</p>  
<p>The Maruts, the youths, placed the maid (lightning on their chariot), their companion for victory (<I>s</I>ubh&eacute; n&iacute;mi<I>s</I>l&acirc;m).</p>  
<p>S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'For the sake of water, or, on the brilliant chariot.' Cf. I, 127, 6; 165, I.</p>  
<p>VI, 62, 4. <I>s</I>&uacute;bham p<I>r&iacute;</I>ksham &iacute;sham &ucirc;&acute;r<I>g</I>am v&aacute;hant&acirc;.</p>  
<p>The A<I>s</I>vins bringing glory, wealth, drink, and food.</p>  
<p>VIII, 26, 13. <I>s</I>ubh&eacute; <I>k</I>akr&acirc;te, you bring him to glory.</p>  
<p><I>S</I>ubham-y&acirc;&acute;van is an epithet of the Maruts, I, 89, 7; V, 61, 13. Cf. <I>s</I>ubhra-y&acirc;v&acirc;n&acirc;, VIII, 26, 19 (A<I>s</I>vinau).</p>  
<p><I>S</I>ubham-y&acirc;&acute;, of the wind, IV, 3, 6.</p>  
<p><I>S</I>ubham-y&uacute;, of the rays of the dawn, X, 78, 7.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:4:1">1</A>. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a: 'With spotted deer for their horses.' See I, 37, 2, note 1, page <A HREF="sbe3218.htm#page_70">70</A>; as P&ucirc;shan is called a<I>g</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>va, having goats for his horses, RV. V, 58, 2.</p>  
<p>That the Maruts have not only p<I>ri</I>shat&icirc;s, but horses for their chariots, we have seen before. In I, 88, 1, we have &aacute;<I>s</I>vapar<I>n</I>ai<I>h</I> r&aacute;thebhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:4:2">2</A>. Ay&acirc;&acute; is a word of very rare occurrence in the Rig-veda. It is the instrum. sing. of the feminine pronominal base a or &icirc;, and as a pronoun followed by a noun it is frequently to be met with; V, 45, 11. ay&acirc;&acute; dhiy&acirc;&acute;, &amp;c. But in our verse it is irregular in form as not entering into Sandhi with &icirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;n&aacute;<I>h</I>. This irregularity, however, which might have led us to suppose an original ay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, indefatigable, corresponding</p>  
<p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></A></p>  
<p>with the following &aacute;si, is vouched for by the Pada text, in such matters a better authority than the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text, and certainly in this case fully borne out by the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya, I, 163, 10. Unless we read ay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, we must take ay&acirc;&acute; as an adverb, in the sense of thus or hence; cf. VI, 66, 4. In some passages where ay&acirc;&acute; seems thus to be used as an adverb, it would be better to supply a noun from the preceding verse. Thus in II, 6, 2, ay&acirc;&acute; refers to sam&iacute;dham in II, 6, 1. In VI, 17, 15, a similar noun, sam&iacute;dh&acirc; or gir&acirc;&acute;, should be supplied. But there are other passages where, unless we suppose that the verse was meant to illustrate a ceremonial act, such as the placing of a sam&iacute;dh, and that ay&acirc;&acute; pointed to it, we must take it as a simple adverb, like the Greek &#0964;&#8183;: RV. III, 12, 2; IX, 53, 2; 106, 14. In X, 116, 9, the Pada reads &aacute;y&acirc;<I>h</I>-iva, not &aacute;y&acirc;, as given by Roth; in VI, 66, 4, &aacute;y&acirc; n&uacute;, the accent is likewise on the first.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:4:3">3</A>. <I>Ri</I><I>n</I>a-y&acirc;&acute;van is well explained by B. and R. as going after debt, searching out sin. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, though he explains <I>ri</I><I>n</I>a-y&acirc;&acute;van by removing sin, derives it nevertheless correctly from <I>ri</I><I>n</I>a and y&acirc;, and not from yu. The same formation is found in <I>s</I>ubham-y&acirc;&acute;van, &amp;c.; and as there is <I>ri</I><I>n</I>a-y&acirc;&acute; besides <I>ri</I><I>n</I>a-y&acirc;&acute;van, so we find <I>s</I>ubham-y&acirc;&acute; besides <I>s</I>ubham-y&acirc;&acute;van. Ludwig prefers the derivation from yu.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:5:1">1</A>. The Soma-juice inspires the poet with eloquence.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:5:2">2</A>. <I>S</I>&aacute;mi occurs again in II, 31, 6; III, 55, 3; VIII, 45, 27; X, 40, 1. Grassmann has shown that it may be taken as an instrum. of <I>s</I>&aacute;m&icirc;, meaning work, but with special reference to the toil of the battle-field or the sacrifice. It is used in the former sense in</p>  
<p>VIII, 45, 27. v&iacute; &acirc;na<I>t</I> turv&aacute;<I>n</I>e <I>s</I>&aacute;mi.</p>  
<p>He (Indra) was able to overcome, lit. he reached to, or he arrived at the overcoming or at victory by toil.</p>  
<p>But, like other words which have the general meaning of working or toiling, <I>s</I>&aacute;m&icirc; is used both in a general sense, and in the more special sense of sacrifice.</p>  
<p>X, 40, 1. v&aacute;sto<I>h</I>-vasto<I>h</I> v&aacute;ham&acirc;nam dhiy&acirc;&acute; <I>s</I>&aacute;mi.</p>

<p>In these two passages it might be possible, with a slight alteration of the accent, to read dhiy&acirc;-<I>s</I>&aacute;mi as one word. Dhiy&acirc;-s&aacute;m would mean the sacrificer who is engaged in prayer; cf. dhiy&acirc;-<I>g</I>&uacute;r, V, 43, 15. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>VI, 2, 4. y&aacute;<I>h</I> te su-d&acirc;&acute;nave dhiy&acirc;&acute; m&aacute;rta<I>h</I> <I>s</I>a<I>s</I>&aacute;mate.</p>  
<p>The mortal who toils for thee, the liberal god, with prayer.</p>  
<p>There is no necessity, however, for such a change, and the authority of the MSS. is against it. See also IX, 74, 7.</p>  
<p>In III, 55, 3, <I>s</I>&aacute;mi &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a d&icirc;dye p&ucirc;rvy&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i, Roth takes s&aacute;mi as an acc. plur. neut., Lanman as an instrum., Grassmann as a locative.</p>  
<p>I glance back at the former sacrifices. See B.&nbsp;R. s.v. d&icirc; and <I>s</I>&aacute;mi.</p>  
<p>In other passages the feminine s&aacute;m&icirc; seems to mean work, sacrificial work, but, as far as we can see, not simply sacrifice. Thus the <I>Ri</I>bhus and others are said to have acquired immortality by their work or works, <I>s</I>&aacute;m&icirc; or <I>s</I>&aacute;m&icirc;bhi<I>h</I>, I, 20, 2; 110, 4; III, 60, 3; IV, 33, 4. Cf. IV, 22, 8; 17, 18; V, 42, 10; 77, 4; VI, 52, 1; VIII, 75, 14; IX, 74, 7; X, 28, 12. In VI, 3, 2, we read:</p>  
<p>&icirc;<I>g</I>&eacute; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&eacute;bhi<I>h</I> <I>s</I>a<I>s</I>am&eacute; s&aacute;m&icirc;bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>I have sacrificed with sacrifices, I have worked with pious works.</p>  
<p>Here the verb <I>s</I>am must be taken in the sense of working, or performing ceremonial worship, while in other places (III, 29, 16; V, 2, 7) it may be perhaps taken in the more special sense of singing songs of praise. The Greek &#0954;&#0940;&#0956;-&#0957;&#0969;, to work, to labour, to tire (Sanskrit <I>s</I>&acirc;myati), the Greek &#0954;&#0959;&#0956;&#0953;&#0948;&#8053; and &#0954;&#0959;&#0956;&#0943;&#0950;&#0969;, to labour for or take care of a person, and possibly even the Greek &#0954;&#8182;&#0956;&#0959;&#0962; a song or a festival (not a village song), may all find their explanation in the Sanskrit root <I>s</I>am.</p>  
<p>The idea that the Maruts did not originally enjoy divine</p>  
<p><a name="page_167"><font size="1" color="green">p. 167</font></A></p>  
<p>honours will occur again and again: cf. I, 6, 4; 72, 3. A similar expression is used of the <I>Ri</I>bhus, I, 20, 8, &amp;c. But while originally the expression of obtaining sacred names meant no more than obtaining a sacred or divine character, it was soon taken literally, and a number of names were invented for the Maruts which even in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asan. Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; XVII, 80-85 amount to 49, i.&nbsp;e. 7 &times; 7. Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&iacute;ya, properly 'worthy of sacrifice,' has the meaning of divine or sacred. The Greek &#7941;&#0947;&#0953;&#0959;&#0962; has been compared with y&acirc;<I>g</I>ya, sacrificio colendus, which is not a Vedic word.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:6:1">1</A>. <I>S</I>riy&aacute;se k&aacute;m seems to be the same as the more frequent <I>s</I>riy&eacute; k&aacute;m. Sriy&aacute;se only occurs twice more, V, 59, 3. The chief irregularity consists in the absence of Gu<I>n</I>a, which is provided for by P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini's kasen (III, 4, 9). Similar infinitives, if they may so be called, are bhiy&aacute;se, V, 29, 4; v<I>ri</I>dh&aacute;se, V, 64, 5; dhruv&aacute;se, VII, 70, 1; tu<I>g</I>&aacute;se, IV, 23, 7; <I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&aacute;se, VIII, 4, 17; v<I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>&aacute;se, VIII, 76, 1; <I>ri</I><I>k</I>&aacute;se, VII, 61, 6. In VI, 39, 5, ri<I>k</I>&aacute;se may be a dat. sing. of the masculine, to the praiser.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:6:2">2</A>. Mimikshire from myaksh, to be united with. Ra<I>s</I>m&iacute;, rays, after bh&acirc;n&uacute;, splendour, may seem weak. It might be possible to assign to ra<I>s</I>m&iacute; the meaning of reins, and take <I>ri</I>kvabhir in the sense of sounding or tinkling. In V, 79, 8, ar<I>k</I>&iacute; is used in juxtaposition with ra<I>s</I>m&iacute;.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:87:6:3">3</A>. The bearing of this concluding verse is not quite clear, unless we take it as a continuation of the preceding verse. It was there said that the Maruts (the <I>r&iacute;</I>kv&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>) obtained their holy names after having joined Indra in his work, which means that they then and there became what they are. Having thus obtained their true character and a place among the gods, they may be said to have won at the same time splendour, and worshippers to sing their praises, and to have established themselves in what became afterwards known as their own domain, their own place among the gods who are invoked at the sacrifice. See VII, 58, 1.</p>  
<p>The metre requires that we should read dh&acirc;mana<I>h</I>.</p>

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilson</span>: Combining with the solar rays, they have willingly poured down (rain) for the welfare (of mankind), and, hymned by the priests, have been pleased partakers of the (sacrificial food).
