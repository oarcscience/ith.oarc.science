<p align="center">The Prologue.</p>  
<p>The sacrificer speaks:</p>  
<p>1. To what splendour do the Maruts all equally <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:1">1</A> cling <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:2">2</A>, they who are of the same age, and dwell in the same nest? With what thoughts?&#8212;from whence are they come <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:3">3</A>? Do these heroes sing forth their (own) strength <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:1:4">4</A>, wishing for wealth?</p>  
<p>2. Whose prayers have the youths accepted? Who has turned the Maruts to his own sacrifice? By what strong desire <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:2:1">1</A> may we arrest them, they who float through the air like hawks?</p>  
<p align="center">The Dialogue.</p>  
<p>The Maruts speak:</p>  
<p>3. From whence <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:1">1</A>, O Indra, dost thou come alone, thou who art mighty? O lord of men <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:2">2</A>, what has thus happened to thee? Thou greetest (us) <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:3">3</A> when thou comest together with (us), the bright (Maruts) <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:3:4">4</A>. Tell us then, thou with thy bay horses, what thou hast against us!</p>  
<p>Indra speaks:</p>  
<p>4. The sacred songs are mine, (mine are) the prayers <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:4:1">1</A>; sweet <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:4:2">2</A> are the libations! My strength rises <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:4:3">3</A>, my thunderbolt is hurled forth. They call for me, the hymns yearn for me. Here are my horses, they carry me hither.</p>  
<p>The Maruts speak:</p>  
<p>5. From thence, in company with our strong</p>  
<p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 180</font></A></p>  
<p>friends <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:5:1">1</A>, having adorned our bodies, we now harness our fallow deer <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:5:2">2</A> with all our might <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:5:3">3</A>;&#8212;for, Indra, according to custom, thou hast come to be with us.</p>  
<p>Indra speaks:</p>  
<p>6. Where, O Maruts, was that custom with you, when you left me alone in the killing of Ahi? I indeed am terrible, powerful, strong,&#8212;I escaped from the blows of every enemy <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:6:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>The Maruts speak:</p>  
<p>7. Thou hast achieved much with us as companions <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:7:1">1</A>. With equal valour, O hero! let us achieve then many things, O thou most powerful, O Indra! whatever we, O Maruts, wish with our mind <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:7:2">2</A>.</p>  
<p>Indra speaks:</p>  
<p>8. I slew V<I>ri</I>tra, O Maruts, with (Indra's) might, having grown powerful through my own vigour; I, who hold the thunderbolt in my arms, have made these all-brilliant waters to flow freely for man <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:8:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>The Maruts speak:</p>  
<p>9. Nothing, O mighty lord, is strong <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:1">1</A> before thee: no one is known among the gods <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:2">2</A> like unto thee. No one who is now born <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:3">3</A> comes near, no one who has been born. Do what thou wilt do <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:9:4">4</A>, thou who art grown so strong.</p>  
<p>Indra speaks:</p>  
<p>10. Almighty strength be mine alone, whatever I may do, daring in my heart <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:10:1">1</A>; for I indeed, O Maruts, am known as terrible: of all that I threw down, I, Indra, am the lord.</p>  
<p>Indra speaks:</p>  
<p>11. O Maruts, now your praise has pleased me, the glorious hymn which you have made for me, ye</p>  
<p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></A></p>  
<p>men!&#8212;for me, for Indra, for the joyful hero, as friends for a friend, for your own sake, and by your own efforts <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:11:1">1</A>.</p>  
<p>Indra speaks:</p>  
<p>12. Truly, there they are, shining towards me, bringing blameless glory, bringing food. O Maruts, wherever I have looked for you, you have appeared to me in bright splendour: appear to me also now!</p>  
<p align="center">The Epilogue.</p>  
<p>The sacrificer speaks:</p>  
<p>13. Who has magnified you here, O Maruts? Come hither, O friends, towards your friends. Ye brilliant Maruts, welcoming <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:13:1">1</A> these prayers, be mindful <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:13:2">2</A> of these my rites.</p>  
<p>14. The wisdom of M&acirc;nya has brought us hither, that he should help as the poet helps the performer of a sacrifice <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:14:1">1</A>: turn hither quickly <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:14:2">2</A>! Maruts, on to the sage! the singer has recited these prayers for you.</p>  
<p>15. May this your praise, O Maruts, this song of M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya, the son of M&acirc;na <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:15:1">1</A>, the poet, bring offspring <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:15:2">2</A> for ourselves with food. May we have an invigorating autumn, with quickening rain <A HREF="sbe3226.htm#an_1:165:15:3">3</A>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p><small>A critical examination of Professor von Roth's remarks on this hymn, together with some supplementary notes of my own, will be found in the Preface to this volume.</small></p>  
<p>According to the Anukrama<I>n</I>ik&acirc; this hymn is a dialogue between Agastya, the Maruts, and Indra. A careful consideration of the hymn would probably have led us to a similar conclusion, but I doubt whether it would have led us to adopt the same distribution of the verses among the poet, the Maruts, and Indra, as that adopted by the author of the Anukrama<I>n</I>ik&acirc;. He assigns the first two verses to Indra, the third, fifth, seventh, and ninth to the Maruts, the fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth to Indra, and the three concluding verses to Agastya. I think that the two verses in the beginning, as well as the three concluding verses, belong certainly to Agastya or to whoever else the real performer of the sacrifice may have been. The two verses in the beginning cannot be ascribed to Indra, who, to judge from his language, would never say: 'By what strong desire may we arrest the Maruts?' It might seem, in fact, as if the three following verses too should be ascribed to the sacrificer, so that the dialogue between Indra and the Maruts would begin only with the sixth verse. The third verse might well be addressed to Indra by the sacrificer, and in the fourth verse we might see a description of all that he had done for Indra. What is against this view, however, is the phrase pr&aacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I> me &aacute;dri<I>h</I>. If used by the sacrificer, it might seem to mean, 'my stone, i.&nbsp;e. the stone used for squeezing the Soma, has been brought forth.' But though Professor Roth assigns this meaning to pr&aacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta in our passage, I doubt whether, in connection with &aacute;dri, or with v&aacute;<I>g</I>ra, pr&aacute;bh<I>ri</I>ta can mean anything but hurled. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 61, 12. asma&iacute; &iacute;t &ucirc;<I>m</I> (&iacute;ti) pr&aacute; bhara&#8212;v<I>ri</I>tr&acirc;&acute;ya v&aacute;<I>g</I>ram.</p>  
<p>Hurl thou, Indra, the thunderbolt against this V<I>ri</I>tra.</p>  
<p>V, 32, 7. y&aacute;t &icirc;m v&aacute;<I>g</I>rasya pr&aacute;-bh<I>ri</I>tau dad&acirc;&acute;bha.</p>  
<p>When Indra conquered him in the hurling of the thunderbolt.</p>  
<p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></A></p>  
<p>I therefore suppose the dialogue to begin with verse 3, and I find that Langlois, though it may be from different reasons, arrived at the same conclusion.</p>  
<p>There can be little doubt that the other verses, to verse 12, are rightly apportioned between Indra and the Maruts. Verse 12 might perhaps be attributed again to the worshipper of the Maruts, but as there is no absolute necessity for assigning it to him, it is better to follow the tradition and to take it as the last verse of Indra's speech. It would seem, in fact, as if these ten verses, from 3 to 12, formed an independent poem, which was intended to show the divine power of the Maruts. That their divine power was sometimes denied, and that Indra's occasional contempt of them was well known to the Vedic poets, will become evident from other hymns. This dialogue seems therefore to have been distinctly intended to show that, in spite of occasional misunderstandings between the Maruts and the all-powerful Indra, Indra himself had fully recognised their power and accepted their friendship. If we suppose that this dialogue was repeated at sacrifices in honour of the Maruts, or that possibly it was acted by two parties, one representing Indra, the other the Maruts and their followers, then the two verses in the beginning and the three at the end ought to be placed in the mouth of the actual sacrificer, whoever he was. He begins by asking, Who has attracted the Maruts to his sacrifice, and by what act of praise and worship can they be delighted? Then follows the dialogue in honour of the Maruts, and after it the sacrificer asks again, 'Who has magnified the Maruts, i.&nbsp;e. have not we magnified them?' and he implores them to grant him their friendship in recognition of his acts of worship. If then we suppose that the dialogue was the work of M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya M&acirc;nya, the fourteenth verse, too, would lose something of its obscurity. Coming from the mouth of the actual sacrificer, it would mean, 'the wisdom, or the poetical power, of M&acirc;nya has brought us to this, has induced us to do this, i.&nbsp;e. to perform this dialogue of M&acirc;nya, so that he, M&acirc;nya, should assist, as a poet assists the priest at a sacrifice.' Of course all this is and can only be guess-work.</p>  
<p><a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 184</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> We do not know the age of M&acirc;nya nor that of Agastya. We do not know whether they were Contemporaries or not. But supposing that M&acirc;nya was present at the sacrifice, v&iacute;pra might be meant for M&acirc;nya; and in the last words, too, 'the singer has recited these prayers for you,' the singer (<I>g</I>arit&acirc;&acute;) might again be M&acirc;nya, the powerful poet whose services the sacrificer had engaged, and whose famous dialogue between Indra and the Maruts was considered a safe means of winning their favour. It would be in keeping with all this, if in the last verse the sacrificer once more informed the Maruts that this hymn of praise was the work of the famous poet M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya, the son of M&acirc;na, and if he then concluded with the usual prayer for safety, food, and progeny.</p>  
<p>No verse of this hymn occurs in the S&acirc;ma-veda; verse 3 = VS. XXXIII, 27; verse 4 = VS. XXXIII, 78; verse 6 = TB. II, 8, 3, 5; verse 8 = TB. 11, 8, 3, 6; verse 9 = VS. XXXIII, 79.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:1:1">1</A>. As sam&acirc;n&icirc;&acute; occurs in the Veda as the feminine of sam&acirc;na (cf. IV, 51, 9; X, 191, 3; 4), sam&acirc;ny&acirc;&acute; might, no doubt, be taken as an instrumental, belonging to <I>s</I>ubh&acirc;&acute;. We should then have to translate: 'With what equal splendour are the Maruts endowed?' S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a adopts the same explanation, while Wilson, who seems to have read sam&acirc;ny&acirc;<I>h</I>, translates 'of one dignity.' Professor Roth, s.&nbsp;v. myaksh, would seem to take sam&acirc;ny&acirc;&acute; as some kind of substantive, and he refers to another passage, I, 167, 4, s&acirc;dh&acirc;ra<I>n</I>y&acirc;&acute;-iva mar&uacute;ta<I>h</I> mimikshu<I>h</I>, without, however, detailing his interpretation of these passages.</p>  
<p>It cannot be said that S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's explanation is objectionable, yet there is something awkward in qualifying by an adjective, however indefinite, what forms the subject of an interrogative sentence, and it would be possible to avoid this, by taking sam&acirc;ny&acirc;&acute; as an adverb. It is clearly used as an adverb in III, 54, 7; VIII, 83, 8.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:1:2">2</A>. Mimikshu<I>h</I> is the perfect of myaksh, in the sense of to be firmly joined with something. It has therefore a more definite meaning than the Latin miscere and the Greek &#0956;&#0943;&#0963;&#0947;&#0949;&#0953;&#0957;, which come from the same source, i.&nbsp;e.</p>  
<p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></A></p>  
<p>from a root mik or mig, in Sanskrit also mi<I>s</I> in mi<I>s</I>-ra; (see Curtius, Grundz&uuml;ge, p. 300.) There may be indeed one or two passages in the Veda where myaksh seems to have the simple meaning of mixing, but it will be seen that they constitute a small minority compared with those where myaksh has the meaning of holding to, sticking to; I mean</p>  
<p>X, 104, 2. mimiksh&uacute;<I>h</I> y&aacute;m &aacute;draya<I>h</I> indra t&uacute;bhyam.</p>  
<p>The Soma which the stones have mixed for thee.</p>  
<p>This form cannot be derived from mimiksh, but is the 3rd pers. plur. perf. Parasm. of myaksh. It may, however, be translated, 'This Soma which the stones have grasped or squeezed for thee,' as may be seen from passages quoted hereafter, in which myaksh is construed with an accusative.</p>  
<p>II, 3, 11. gh<I>ri</I>t&aacute;m mimikshe.</p>  
<p>The butter has been mixed.</p>  
<p>This form cannot be derived from mimiksh, but is the 3rd pers. sing. perf. &Acirc;tm. of myaksh. If the meaning of mixing should be considered inadmissible, we might in this verse also translate, 'The butter has become fixed, solid, or coagulated.'</p>  
<p>Leaving out of consideration for the present the forms which are derived from mimiksh, we find the following passages in which myaksh occurs. Its original meaning must have been to be mixed with, to be joined to, and in many passages that original sense is still to be recognised, only with the additional idea of being firmly joined, of sticking to, or, in an active sense, laying hold of, grasping firmly.</p>  
<p align="center">1. Without any case:</p>  
<p>I, 169, 3. &aacute;myak s&acirc;&acute; te indra <I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>&iacute;<I>h</I> asm&eacute; (&iacute;ti).</p>  
<p>This thy spear, O Indra, sat firm for us.</p>  
<p>This would mean that Indra held his weapon well, as a soldier ought to hold his spear. &Aacute;myak is the 3rd pers. sing. of a second aor. Parasm., &aacute;myaksham, &aacute;myak(sh + t); (Say. pr&acirc;pnoti.) Cf. VIII, 61, 18.</p>  
<p align="center">2. With locative:</p>  
<p>X, 44, 2. mimy&aacute;ksha v&aacute;<I>g</I>ra<I>h</I> n<I>ri</I>-pate gabh&aacute;stau.</p>  
<p>In thy fist, O king, the thunderbolt rests firmly.</p>  
<p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></A></p>  
<p>I, 167, 3. mimy&aacute;ksha y&eacute;shu s&ucirc;-dhit&acirc;&#8212;<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>To whom clings the well-grasped spear.</p>  
<p>VI, 50, 5. mimy&aacute;ksha y&eacute;shu rodas&icirc;&acute; n&uacute; dev&icirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>To whom the goddess Rodas&icirc; clings. (S&acirc;y. sa<I>m</I>ga<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ate.)</p>  
<p>VI, 11, 5. &aacute;myakshi s&aacute;dma s&aacute;dane p<I>ri</I>thivy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The seat was firmly set on the seat of the earth. (S&acirc;y. gamyate, parig<I>ri</I>hyate.) It is the 3rd pers. sing. aor. pass.</p>  
<p>VI, 29, 2. &acirc;&acute; y&aacute;smin h&aacute;ste n&aacute;ry&acirc;<I>h</I> mimiksh&uacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; r&aacute;the hira<I>n</I>y&aacute;ye rathe-sth&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, &acirc;&acute; ra<I>s</I>m&aacute;ya<I>h</I> g&aacute;bhastyo<I>h</I> sth&ucirc;r&aacute;yo<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; &aacute;dhvan &aacute;<I>s</I>v&acirc;sa<I>h</I> v<I>r&iacute;</I>sha<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> yu<I>g</I>&acirc;n&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>To whose hand men cling, in whose golden chariot the drivers stand firm, in whose strong fists the reins are well held, on whose path the harnessed stallions hold together. (Say. &acirc;si<I>k</I>yante, &acirc;p&ucirc;ryante; or &acirc;si<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>anti, p&ucirc;rayanti.)</p>  
<p>X, 96, 3. &iacute;ndre n&iacute; r&ucirc;p&acirc;&acute; h&aacute;rit&acirc; mimikshire.</p>  
<p>Bright colours stuck or clung or settled on Indra. (S&acirc;y. nishikt&acirc;ni babh&ucirc;vu<I>h</I>; mihe<I>h</I> sanant&acirc;t karma<I>n</I>i r&ucirc;pam.)</p>  
<p align="center">3. With instrumental:</p>  
<p>I, 165, 1. k&aacute;y&acirc; <I>s</I>ubh&acirc;&acute; mar&ucirc;ta<I>h</I> s&aacute;m mimikshu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>To what splendour do the Maruts cling; or, what splendour clings to them?</p>  
<p>V, 58, 5. sv&aacute;y&acirc; maty&acirc;&acute; mar&ucirc;ta<I>h</I> s&aacute;m mimikshu<I>h</I>. (See also I, 165, 1.)</p>  
<p>The Maruts cling to their own thought or will. (S&acirc;y. v<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>y&acirc; samyak si<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>anti.)</p>  
<p>I, 167, 4. yavy&acirc;&acute; s&acirc;dh&acirc;ra<I>n</I>y&acirc;&acute;-iva mar&uacute;ta<I>h</I> mimikshu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The Maruts cling to the young maid, as if she belonged to all. See I, 173, 12; VIII, 98, 8; or VI, 27, 6,</p>  
<p>I, 87, 6. bh&acirc;n&uacute;-bhi<I>h</I> s&aacute;m mimikshire.</p>  
<p>The Maruts were joined with splendour. (S&acirc;y. me<I>dh</I>um i<I>k</I><I>kh</I>anti.)</p>  
<p align="center">4. With accusative:</p>  
<p>VIII, 61, 18. ni y&acirc;&acute; v&aacute;<I>g</I>ram mimiksh&aacute;tu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Thy two arms which have firmly grasped the thunderbolt. (Say. parig<I>ri</I>h<I>n</I>&icirc;ta<I>h</I>.)</p>  
<p>Here I should also prefer to place VII, 20, 4, if we might read mimikshe or mimy&aacute;ksha, for it is impossible to take m&iacute;mikshan for anything but a participle of the desiderative of mih, which does not yield an appropriate meaning.</p>  
<p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></A></p>  
<p>n&iacute; v&aacute;<I>g</I>ram &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> m&iacute;mikshan.</p>  
<p>Grasping firmly the thunderbolt. (S&acirc;y. <I>s</I>atrushu pr&acirc;payan.)</p>  
<p>VI, 29, 3. <I>s</I>riy&eacute; te p&acirc;&acute;d&acirc; d&ucirc;va<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; mimikshu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Thy servants embrace thy feet for their happiness. (S&acirc;y. &acirc;si<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>anti, samarpayanti.)</p>  
<p>Like other verbs which mean to join, myaksh, if accompanied by prepositions expressive of separation, means to separate. (Cf. vi-yukta, se-junctus.)</p>  
<p>II, 28, 6. &aacute;po (&iacute;ti) s&uacute; myaksha varu<I>n</I>a bhiy&aacute;sam m&aacute;t.</p>  
<p>Remove well from me, O Varu<I>n</I>a, terror. (S&acirc;y. apagamaya.)</p>  
<p>Quite distinct from this is the desiderative or inchoative verb mimiksh, from mih, in the sense of to sprinkle, or to shower, chiefly used with reference to the gods who are asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with rain. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 142, 3. m&aacute;dhv&acirc; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m mimikshati.</p>  
<p>(Nar&acirc;sa<I>m</I>sa) sprinkles the sacrifice with rain.</p>  
<p>IX, 107, 6. m&aacute;dhv&acirc; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m mimiksha na<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Sprinkle (O Soma) our sacrifice with rain.</p>  
<p>I, 34, 3. tr&iacute;<I>h</I> ady&aacute; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m m&aacute;dhun&acirc; mimikshatam.</p>  
<p>O A<I>s</I>vins, sprinkle the sacrifice with rain thrice to-day!</p>  
<p>I, 47, 4. m&aacute;dhv&acirc; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m mimikshatam.</p>  
<p>O A<I>s</I>vins, sprinkle the sacrifice with rain!</p>  
<p align="center">5. Without m&aacute;dhu:</p>  
<p>I, 22, 13. mah&icirc;&acute; dya&ucirc;<I>h</I> p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute; <I>k</I>a na<I>h</I> im&aacute;m ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m mimikshat&acirc;m.</p>  
<p>May the great heaven and earth sprinkle this our sacrifice.</p>  
<p>6. With m&aacute;dhu in the accusative:</p>  
<p>VI, 70, 5. m&aacute;dhu na<I>h</I> dy&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute; (&iacute;ti) mimikshat&acirc;m.</p>  
<p>May heaven and earth shower down rain for us.</p>  
<p>Very frequently the A<I>s</I>vins are asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their whip. This whip seems originally, like the whip of the Maruts, to have been intended for the cracking noise of the storm, preceding the rain. Then as whips had possibly some similarity to the instruments used for sprinkling butter on the sacrificial viands, the A<I>s</I>vins are</p>  
<p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></A></p>  
<p>asked to sprinkle the sacrifice with their whip, i.&nbsp;e. to give rain:</p>  
<p>I, 157, 4. m&aacute;dhu-maty&acirc; na<I>h</I> ka<I>s</I>ay&acirc; mimikshatam.</p>  
<p>O A<I>s</I>vins, sprinkle us with your rain-giving whip.</p>  
<p>I, 22, 3. t&aacute;y&acirc; ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;m mimikshatam.</p>  
<p>O A<I>s</I>vins, sprinkle the sacrifice with it (your whip).</p>  
<p align="center">7. Lastly, we find such phrases as,</p>  
<p>I, 48, 16. s&aacute;m na<I>h</I> r&acirc;y&acirc;&acute;&#8212;mimikshv&aacute;.</p>  
<p>Sprinkle us with wealth, i.&nbsp;e. shower wealth down upon us. Here mih is really treated as a Hu-verb in the &Acirc;tmanepada, though others take it for mimikshasva.</p>  
<p>As an adjective, mimiksh&uacute; is applied to Indra (III, 50, 3), and mimiksh&aacute; to Soma (VI, 34, 4).</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:1:3">3</A>. I do not see how &eacute;t&acirc;sa<I>h</I> can here be taken in any sense but that suggested by the Pada, &acirc;&acute;-it&acirc;sa<I>h</I>, come near. Professor Roth thinks it not impossible that it may be meant for &eacute;t&acirc;<I>h</I>, the fallow deer, the usual team of the Maruts. These Etas are mentioned in verse 5, but there the Pada gives quite correctly &eacute;t&acirc;n, not &acirc;&acute;-it&acirc;n, and S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains it accordingly by gant&ucirc;n.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:1:4">4</A>. The idea that the Maruts proclaim their own strength occurred before, I, 87, 3. It is a perfectly natural conception, for the louder the voice of the wind, the greater its strength, and vice versa.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:2:1">1</A>. M&aacute;nas here, as elsewhere, is used in the sense of thought preceding speech, desire, or devotion not yet expressed in prayer. See Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>h. V, 1, 3, 3. yat purusho manas&acirc;bhiga<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ati tad v&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc; vadati, what a man grasps in his mind, that he expresses by speech. Professor Roth suggests an emendation which is ingenious, but not necessary, viz. mah&acirc;&acute; n&aacute;mas&acirc;, with great adoration, an expression which occurs, if not in VI, 52, 17, at least in VII, 12, 1. We find, however, the phrase mah&acirc;&acute; m&aacute;nas&acirc; in</p>  
<p>VI, 40, 4.</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&acirc;&acute; y&acirc;hi <I>s</I>&aacute;svat u<I>s</I>at&acirc;&acute; yay&acirc;tha &iacute;ndra mah&acirc;&acute; m&aacute;nas&acirc; soma-p&eacute;yam,<br> &ucirc;pa br&aacute;hm&acirc;<I>n</I>i <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>ava<I>h</I> im&acirc;&acute; na<I>h</I> &aacute;tha te ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> tanve&#771; v&aacute;ya<I>h</I> dh&acirc;t.</div></p>

<p>Come hither, thou hast always come, Indra, to our libation through our yearning great desire. Mayest thou hear these our prayers, and may then the sacrifice put vigour in thy body.</p>  
<p>It is curious to observe that throughout the Rig-veda the instrumental singular mah&acirc;&acute; is always used as an adjective belonging to some term or other for praise and prayer. Besides the passages mentioned, we find:</p>  
<p>II, 24, 1. ay&acirc;&acute; vidhema n&aacute;vay&acirc; mah&acirc;&acute; gir&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Let us sacrifice with this new great song.</p>  
<p>VI, 52, 17. su-ukt&eacute;na mah&acirc;&acute; n&aacute;mas&acirc; &acirc;&acute; viv&acirc;se.</p>  
<p>I worship with a hymn with great adoration, or I worship with a great hymn in adoration. VIII, 46, 14. g&acirc;ya gir&acirc;&acute; mah&acirc;&acute; v&iacute;-<I>k</I>etasam. Celebrate the wise Indra with a great song. Otherwise we might translate, Thou hast always come with a great yearning desire.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:3:1">1</A>. We ought to scan ku&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> t&#774;va&#774;m i&#772;nd&#774;ra&#774; m&acirc;&#772;hi&#774;na&#772;<I>h</I> san, because y&acirc;si, being anud&acirc;tta, could not begin a new p&acirc;da. It would be more natural to translate k&uacute;ta<I>h</I> by why? for the Maruts evidently wish to express their surprise at Indra's going to do battle alone and without their assistance. I do not think, however, that in the Rig-veda, even in the latest hymns, k&uacute;ta<I>h</I> has as yet a causal meaning, and I have therefore translated it in the same sense in which it occurs before in the poet's address to the Maruts.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:3:2">2</A>. Sat-pati, lord of men, means lord of real men, of heroes, and should not be translated by good lord. Sat by itself is frequently used in the sense of heroes, of men physically rather than morally good:</p>  
<p>II, I, 3. tv&aacute;m agne &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> v<I>ri</I>shabh&aacute;<I>h</I> sat&acirc;&acute;m asi.</p>  
<p>Thou, Agni, art Indra, the hero among heroes.</p>  
<p>I, 173, 7. sam&aacute;t-su tv&acirc; <I>s</I>&ucirc;ra sat&acirc;&acute;m ur&acirc;<I>n</I>&aacute;m.</p>  
<p>Thee, O hero, in battles the protector of (good and true) men.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:3:3">3</A>. The meaning of s&aacute;m p<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ase is very much the same as that of s&aacute;m vadasva in I, 170, 5.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:3:4">4</A>. <I>S</I>ubh&acirc;n&aacute; is evidently meant as a name for the</p>  
<p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Maruts, who thus speak of themselves in the third person, which is by no means unusual in the Rig-veda.</p>  
<p>Mah&icirc;dhara explains <I>s</I>ubh&acirc;nai<I>h</I> by <I>s</I>obhanair va<I>k</I>anai<I>h</I>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Indra certainly addresses his old friends, the Maruts, very unceremoniously, but this, though at first startling, was evidently the intention of the poet. He wished to represent a squabble between Indra and the Maruts, such as they were familiar with in their own village life, and this was to be followed by a reconciliation. The boorish rudeness, selfishness, and boastfulness here ascribed to Indra may seem offensive to those who cannot divest themselves of the modern meaning of deities, but looked upon from the right point of view, it is really full of interest.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:4:1">1</A>. Br&aacute;hm&acirc;<I>n</I>i and mat&aacute;ya<I>h</I> are here mentioned separately in the same way as a distinction is made between br&aacute;hman, st&oacute;ma, and ukth&aacute;, IV, 22, I; VI, 23, 1; between br&aacute;hm&acirc;<I>n</I>i and g&iacute;ra<I>h</I>, III, 51, 6; between br&aacute;hma, g&iacute;ra<I>h</I>, and st&oacute;ma<I>h</I>, VI, 38, 3; between br&aacute;hma, g&iacute;ra<I>h</I>, ukth&acirc;&acute;, and m&aacute;nma, VI, 38, 4, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:4:2">2</A>. <I>S</I>&aacute;m, which I have here translated by sweet, is a difficult word to render. It is used as a substantive, as an adjective, and as an adverb; and in several instances it must remain doubtful whether it was meant for one or the other. The adverbial character is almost always, if not always, applicable, though in English there is no adverb of such general import as <I>s</I>&aacute;m, and we must therefore render it differently, although we are able to perceive that in the mind of the poet it might still have been conceived as an adverb, in the sense of 'well.' I shall arrange the principal passages in which <I>s</I>&aacute;m occurs according to the verbs with which it is construed.</p>  
<p align="center">1. With bh&ucirc;:</p>  
<p>VIII, 79, 7. bh&aacute;va na<I>h</I> soma <I>s</I>&aacute;m h<I>ri</I>d&eacute;.</p>  
<p>Be thou, Soma, well (pleasant) to our heart. Cf. VIII,</p>  
<p>82, 3.</p>  
<p>VIII, 48, 4. <I>s</I>&aacute;m na<I>h</I> bhava h<I>ri</I>d&eacute; &acirc;&acute; p&icirc;t&aacute;<I>h</I> indo (&iacute;ti).</p>  
<p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></A></p>  
<p>Be thou well (sweet) to our heart, when drunk, O Soma! Cf. X, 9, 4.</p>  
<p>I, 90, 9. <I>s</I>&aacute;m na<I>h</I> bhavatu aryam&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>May Aryaman be well (kind) to us!</p>  
<p>VI, 74, 1. <I>s</I>&aacute;m na<I>h</I> bh&ucirc;tam dvi-p&aacute;de <I>s</I>&aacute;m <I>k</I>&aacute;tu<I>h</I>-pade.</p>  
<p>May Soma and Rudra be well (kind) to our men and cattle.</p>  
<p>Here <I>s</I>&aacute;m might be rendered as an adverb, or as an adjective, or even as a substantive, in the sense of health or blessing.</p>  
<p>Cf. VII, 54, I; IX, 69, 7. The expression dvip&aacute;d and <I>k</I>&aacute;tu<I>h</I>-pad is curiously like what occurs in the prayers of the Eugubian tables, Fisovie San<I>s</I>ie, ditu ocre Fisi, tote Jovine, ocrer Fisie, totar Jovinar dupursus, peturpursus fato fito (Umbrische Sprachdenkm&auml;ler, ed. Aufrecht, p. 198); and also in the edicts of Piyadasi, dupada-<I>k</I>atupadesu pakhiv&acirc;li<I>k</I>alesu, 'aux bip&egrave;des, aux quadrup&egrave;des, aux volatiles, aux animaux qui se meuvent dans les eaux.' See Burnouf, Lotus, p. 667.</p>  
<p>II, 38, 11. <I>s</I>&aacute;m y&aacute;t stot<I>r&iacute;</I>-bhya<I>h</I> &acirc;p&aacute;ye bh&aacute;v&acirc;ti.</p>  
<p>What may be well (a pleasure) for the praisers, for the friend.</p>  
<p>X, 37, 10. <I>s</I>&aacute;m na<I>h</I> bhava <I>k</I>&aacute;kshas&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Be kind to us with thy light!</p>  
<p align="center">2. With as:</p>  
<p>VIII, 17, 6. s&oacute;ma<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;m astu te h<I>ri</I>d&eacute;.</p>  
<p>May the Soma be well (agreeable) to thy heart!</p>  
<p>I, 5, 7. <I>s</I>&aacute;m te santu pr&aacute;-<I>k</I>etase.</p>  
<p>May the Somas be well (pleasing) to thee, the wise!</p>  
<p>V, 11, 5. t&uacute;bhyam man&icirc;sh&acirc;&acute; iy&aacute;m astu <I>s</I>&aacute;m h<I>ri</I>d&eacute;.</p>  
<p>May this prayer be well (acceptable) to thy heart!</p>  
<p>I, 114, 1. y&aacute;th&acirc; <I>s</I>&aacute;m &aacute;sat dvi-p&aacute;de <I>k</I>&aacute;tu<I>h</I>-pade.</p>  
<p>That it may be well for our men and cattle. Cf. X, 165, I; 3.</p>  
<p>VII, 86, 8. s&aacute;m na<I>h</I> ksh&eacute;me <I>s</I>&aacute;m &ucirc;<I>m</I> (&iacute;ti) y&oacute;ge na<I>h</I> astu.</p>  
<p>May it be well with us in keeping and acquiring!</p>  
<p>V, 7, 9. &acirc;&acute; y&aacute;<I>h</I> te&#8212;agne <I>s</I>&aacute;m &aacute;sti dh&acirc;&acute;yase.</p>  
<p>He who is lief to thee to support, i.&nbsp;e. he whom thou likest to support.</p>  
<p>V, 74, 9. <I>s</I>&aacute;m &ucirc;<I>m</I> (&iacute;ti) s&uacute; v&acirc;m&#8212;asm&acirc;&acute;kam astu <I>k</I>ark<I>ri</I>t&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>

<p>A song which is pleasant to the mighty Indra, as food to an ox.</p>

<p>X, 86, 15. manth&aacute;<I>h</I> te indra <I>s</I>&aacute;m h<I>ri</I>d&eacute;.</p>  
<p>The mixture is pleasant to thy heart, O Indra!</p>  
<p>X, 97, 18. &aacute;ram k&acirc;&acute;m&acirc;ya, <I>s</I>&aacute;m h<I>ri</I>d&eacute;.</p>  
<p>Enough for love, pleasant to the heart.</p>  
<p>VI, 34, 3. <I>s</I>&aacute;m t&aacute;t asmai.</p>  
<p>That is pleasant to him.</p>

<p align="center"><I>S</I>&aacute;m Y&oacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p><I>S</I>&aacute;m also occurs in a phrase that has puzzled the interpreters of the Veda very much, viz. <I>s</I>&aacute;m y&oacute;<I>h</I>. These are two words, and must both be taken as substantives, though originally they may have been adverbs. Their meaning seems to have been much the same, and in English they may safely be rendered by health and wealth, in the old acceptation of these words:</p>  
<p>I, 93, 7. dhattam y&aacute;<I>g</I>am&acirc;n&acirc;ya <I>s</I>&aacute;m y&oacute;<I>h</I>.</p>

<p>Let us be together with you, O Maruts, after health, wealth, water, and medicine have been showered down in the morning.</p>  
<p>VIII, 39, 4. <I>s</I>&aacute;m <I>k</I>a y&oacute;<I>h</I> ka m&aacute;ya<I>h</I> dadhe.</p>  
<p>He gave health, wealth, and happiness.</p>  
<p>VIII, 71, 15. agnim <I>s</I>&aacute;m y&oacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>a d&acirc;&acute;tave.</p>  
<p>We ask Agni to give us health and wealth.</p>  
<p>X, 9, 4. <I>s</I>&aacute;m y&oacute;<I>h</I> abh&iacute; sravantu na<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May the waters come to us, as health and wealth, or may they run towards us auspiciously.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:4:3">3</A>. If we retain the reading of the MSS. <I>s</I>&ucirc;shma<I>h</I> iyarti, we must take it as an independent phrase, and translate it by 'my strength rises.' For <I>s</I>&ucirc;shma, though in this and other places it is frequently explained as an adjective, meaning powerful, is, as far as I can see, always a substantive, and means breath, strength. There may be a few passages in which, as there occur several words for strength, it might</p>  
<p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></A></p>  
<p>be possible to translate <I>s</I>&uacute;shma by strong. But even there it is better to keep to the general meaning of s&uacute;shma, and translate it as a substantive.</p>  
<p>Iyarti means to rise and to raise. It is particularly applied to prayers raised by the poet in honour of the gods, and the similes used in connection with this, show clearly what the action implied by iyarti really is. For instance,</p>  
<p>I, 116, 1. st&oacute;m&acirc;n iyarmi abhr&iacute;y&acirc;-iva v&acirc;&acute;ta<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>I stir up hymns as the wind stirs the clouds.</p>  
<p>X, 116, 9. su-va<I>k</I>asy&acirc;&acute;m iyarmi s&iacute;ndhau-iva pr&aacute; &icirc;rayam n&acirc;&acute;vam arka&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>I stir up sweet praise, as if I rowed a ship on the river with hymns.</p>  
<p>In the sense of rising it occurs,</p>  
<p>X, 140, 2. p&acirc;vak&aacute;-var<I>k</I>&acirc;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>ukr&aacute;-var<I>k</I>&acirc;<I>h</I> &aacute;n&ucirc;na-var<I>k</I>&acirc;<I>h</I> &uacute;t iyarshi bh&acirc;n&uacute;n&acirc;.</p>  
<p>Thou risest up with splendour, Agni, thou of bright, resplendent, undiminished majesty.</p>  
<p>We might therefore safely translate in our verse 'my strength rises,' although it is true that such a phrase does not occur again, and that in other passages where iyarti and s&uacute;shma occur together, the former governs the latter in the accusative. Cf. IV, 17, 12; X, 75, 3.</p>  
<p>Mah&icirc;dhara translates, my held-up thunderbolt moves on destroying everything,' but he admits another rendering in which adri would mean the stone used for pressing the Soma.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:5:1">1</A>. If, as we can hardly avoid, we ascribe this verse to. the Maruts, we must recognise in it the usual offer of help to Indra on the part of the Maruts. The question then only is, who are the strong friends in whose company they appear? It would be well if one could render antam&eacute;bhi<I>h</I> by horses, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a does, but there is no authority for it. Sv&aacute;-kshatra is an adjective, meaning endowed with independent strength, synonymous with sv&aacute;-tavas, I, 166, 2. It is applied to the mind of Indra, I, 54, 3; V, 3, 4; to the Maruts, V, 48, 1, but never to horses. As it stands, we can only suppose that a distinction is made between the Maruts and their followers,</p>  
<p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></A></p>  
<p>and that after calling together their followers, and adorning themselves for battle, they proceed to harness their chariots. Cf. I, 107, 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:5:2">2</A>. Et&acirc;n, in all MSS. which I consulted, has here the accent on the first syllable, and Professor Aufrecht ought not to have altered the word into et&acirc;&acute;n. If the accent had not been preserved by the tradition of the schools, the later interpreters would certainly have taken et&acirc;n for the demonstrative pronoun. As it is, in spite of accent and termination, S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a in I, 166, 10, seems to take &eacute;t&acirc;<I>h</I> for et&eacute;. In other passages, however, S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, too, has perceived the difference, and in I, 169, 6, he explains the word very fully as p<I>ri</I>shadvar<I>n</I>&acirc; gant&acirc;ro v&acirc; a<I>s</I>v&acirc; v&acirc;. In this passage the Etas are clearly the deer of the Maruts, the P<I>ri</I>shat&icirc;s:</p>  
<p>I, 169, 6. &aacute;dha y&aacute;t esh&acirc;m p<I>ri</I>thu-budhn&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> &eacute;t&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>In the next verse, however, &eacute;ta seems applied to the Maruts themselves:</p>  
<p>I, 169, 7. pr&aacute;ti ghor&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>&acirc;m &eacute;t&acirc;n&acirc;m ay&acirc;&acute;s&acirc;m mar&uacute;t&acirc;m <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>ve &acirc;-yat&acirc;&acute;m upabd&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The sound of the terrible, speckled, indefatigable Maruts is heard, as they approach; unless we translate:</p>  
<p>The noise of the terrible deer of the indefatigable Maruts is heard, as they approach.</p>  
<p>In I, 166, 10, &aacute;mseshu &eacute;t&acirc;<I>h</I>, I adopt Professor Roth's conjecture, that &eacute;t&acirc;<I>h</I> means the skins of the fallow deer, so that we should have to translate: On their shoulders are the deer-skins.</p>  
<p>In the other passages where &eacute;ta occurs it is used as a simile only, and therefore throws no light on the relation of the Etas to the Maruts. In both passages, however (V, 54, 5; X, 77, 2), the simile refers to the Maruts, though to their speed only, and not to their colour.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:5:3">3</A>. M&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I>, which I have translated 'with all our might,' seems to be used almost as an adverb, mightily or quickly (makshu), although the original meaning, with our powers, through our might, is likewise applicable. The original meaning is quite perceptible in passages like</p>  
<p>V, 62, 3. &aacute;dh&acirc;rayatam p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute;m ut&aacute; dy&acirc;&acute;m m&iacute;tra-r&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;n&acirc; varu<I>n</I>&acirc; m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></A></p>  
<p>Kings Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, you have supported heaven and earth by your powers.</p>  
<p>VII, 3, 7. t&eacute;bhi<I>h</I> na<I>h</I> agne &aacute;mitai<I>h</I> m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I> <I>s</I>at&aacute;m p&ucirc;rbh&iacute;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute;yas&icirc;bhi<I>h</I> v&iacute; p&acirc;hi.</p>  
<p>With those immeasurable powers, O Agni, protect us, with a hundred iron strongholds.</p>  
<p>I, 90, 2. t&eacute;&#8212;m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I>, vrat&acirc;&acute; rakshante vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;&acute;h&acirc;.</p>  
<p>They always protect the laws by their powers.</p>  
<p>VII, 71, 1. tv&aacute;m na<I>h</I> agne m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I> p&acirc;h&iacute;.</p>  
<p>Protect us, Agni, with thy power.</p>  
<p>In other passages, however, we see m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I> used of the light or of the flames of Agni and of the dawn:</p>  
<p>IV, 14, 1. dev&aacute;<I>h</I> r&oacute;<I>k</I>am&acirc;na<I>h</I> m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Agni, the god, brilliant with his powers.</p>  
<p>VI, 64, 2. devi r&oacute;<I>k</I>am&acirc;n&acirc; m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>O goddess, brilliant with thy powers.</p>  
<p>The powers of the Maruts are referred to by the same name in the following passages:</p>  
<p>V, 58, 5. pr&aacute;-pra <I>g</I>&acirc;yante&#8212;m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The Maruts are born with their powers.</p>  
<p>VII, 58, 2. pr&aacute; y&eacute; m&aacute;ha<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I> &oacute;<I>g</I>as&acirc; ut&aacute; s&aacute;nti.</p>  
<p>The Maruts who excel in power and strength. Cf. III, 4, 6.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:6:1">1</A>. Indra in this dialogue is evidently represented as claiming everything for himself alone. He affects contempt for the help proffered by the Maruts, and seems to deny that he was at any time beholden to their assistance. By asking, Where was that custom that I should be with you and you with me in battle? he implies that it was not always their custom, and that he can dispense with their succour now. He wants to be alone, as in his former battle with Ahi, and does not wish that they should join him (cf. I, 33, 4). Professor Roth takes sam-&aacute;dhatta in the sense of implicating, but it can hardly be said that the Maruts ever implicated Indra in his fight against Ahi. Certainly this is not in keeping with the general tenor of this dialogue where, on the contrary, Indra shuns the</p>  
<p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></A></p>  
<p>company of the Maruts. But while on this point I differ from Professor Roth, I think he has rightly interpreted the meaning of &aacute;namam. Out of the four passages in which badhasna&iacute;<I>h</I> occurs, it is three times joined with nam, and every time has the sense of to bend away from, to escape from. See also Sonne, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xii, p. 348.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 7.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:7:1">1</A>. See VII, 39, 6. saksh&icirc;m&aacute;hi y&uacute;<I>g</I>yebhi<I>h</I> n&uacute; deva&iacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:7:2">2</A>. The last words leave no doubt as to their meaning, for the phrase is one of frequent occurrence. The only difficulty is the vocative maruta<I>h</I>, where we should expect the nominative. It is quite possible, however, that the Maruts should here address themselves, though, no doubt, it would be easy to alter the accent. As to the phrase itself, see</p>  
<p>VIII, 61, 4. t&aacute;th&acirc; &iacute;t asat &iacute;ndra kr&aacute;tv&acirc; y&aacute;th&acirc; v&aacute;<I>s</I>a<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May it be so, O Indra, as thou mayest desire by thy mind.</p>  
<p>VIII, 66, 4. va<I>g</I><I>r&icirc;&acute;</I>&#8212;&iacute;t karat &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> kr&aacute;tv&acirc; y&aacute;th&acirc; v&aacute;<I>s</I>at.</p>  
<p>May Indra with the thunderbolt act as he may desire in his mind. Cf. VIII, 20, 17; 28, 4, &amp;c.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:8:1">1</A>. Here again Indra claims everything for himself, denying that the Maruts in any way assisted him while performing his great deeds. These deeds are the killing of V<I>ri</I>tra, who withholds the waters, i.&nbsp;e. the rain from the earth, and the consequent liberation of the waters, so that they flow down freely for the benefit of Manu, that is, of man.</p>  
<p>When Indra says that he slew V<I>ri</I>tra indriy&eacute;<I>n</I>a, he evidently chooses that word with a purpose, and we must therefore translate it here, not only by might, but by Indra's peculiar might. Indriy&aacute;, as derived from &iacute;ndra, means originally Indra-hood, then power in general, just as verethraghna in Zend means victory in general, though originally it meant the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra.</p>  
<p>On b&aacute;dh&icirc;m, see Bollensen, Z.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G. XXII, p. 594.</p>  
<p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> He takes b&aacute;dh&icirc;m for a contraction of badhisham, in analogy with badh&icirc;s and badh&icirc;t. He refers to akram&icirc;m, X, 166, 5, and badh&icirc;m, X, 28, 7.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:9:1">1</A>. &Aacute;nutta, in the sense of 'not shaken,' not shakeable, in&eacute;branlable, is strange; likewise the genitive, where we expect the instrumental. Still, nud, by itself, occurs in similar phrases, e.&nbsp;g. VI, 17, 5, nutth&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;<I>k</I>yutam, thou shookest what is unshakeable, which might have been expressed by &aacute;<I>k</I>u<I>k</I>yava<I>h</I> &aacute;nuttam, and I cannot bring myself to believe that in our passage Aufrecht's conjectural emendation is called for. He (K.&nbsp;Z. XXVI, 611) takes &aacute;nutta for &aacute;nudatta, like pratta for pradatta, &amp;c., and proposes to omit the negative particle, translating the verse: 'Certainly it is conceded to thee, there is none among the gods like unto thee.'</p>  
<p>But though I cannot adopt this emendation here, I think that in other passages Aufrecht's rendering of &aacute;nutta is far more appropriate than to take it for a-nutta; for instance, I, 80, 7; III, 31, 13; VII, 34, 11.</p>  
<p>There remains one verse in which anutta seems to mean not shaken, not overcome, namely, VIII, 90, 5, tv&aacute;m v<I>ri</I>tr&acirc;&acute;<I>n</I>i ha<I>m</I>si aprat&icirc;&acute;ni &eacute;ka<I>h</I> &iacute;t &aacute;nutt&acirc; <I>k</I>arsha<I>n</I>i-dh<I>r&iacute;</I>t&acirc;, thou, being alone, killest the irresistible enemies with the thunderbolt (?). However, anud&acirc;, in the sense of conceding, yielding, nachgeben, is certainly a very familiar idea in Vedic poetry.</p>  
<p>II, 12, 10. y&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>s</I>&aacute;rdhate n&aacute; anu-d&aacute;d&acirc;ti <I>s</I><I>ri</I>dhy&acirc;&acute;m, who does not forgive the hurter his hurt.</p>  
<p>I, 53, 8; II, 21, 4; 23, 11; X, 38, 5, Indra is called ananud&aacute;<I>h</I>, not yielding, not surrendering.</p>  
<p>We must therefore admit two anuttas, one &aacute;-nutta, the other &aacute;nu(da)tta. In &aacute;nutta-manyu I prefer the former, 'of irresistible fury,' while Aufrecht prefers the latter, 'of recognised, or universally-admitted fury.'</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:9:2">2</A>. Dev&aacute;t&acirc; in the ordinary sense of a deity never occurs in the Rig-veda. The word, in fact, as a feminine substantive occurs but twice, and in the tenth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala</p>  
<p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></A></p>  
<p>only. But even there it does not mean deity. In X, 24, 6, dev&acirc;<I>h</I> dev&aacute;tay&acirc; means, O gods, by your godhead, i.&nbsp;e. by your divine power. In X, 98, 1, b<I>r&iacute;</I>haspate pr&aacute;ti me dev&aacute;t&acirc;m ihi, I take dev&aacute;t&acirc; in the same sense as dev&aacute;t&acirc;ti, and translate, O B<I>ri</I>haspati, come to my sacrifice.</p>  
<p>In all other places where dev&aacute;t&acirc; occurs in the Rig-veda it is a local adverb, and means among the gods. I shall only quote those passages in which Professor Roth assigns to dev&aacute;t&acirc; a different meaning:</p>  
<p>I, 55, 3. pr&aacute; v&icirc;rye&#771;<I>n</I>a dev&aacute;t&acirc; &aacute;ti <I>k</I>ekite.</p>  
<p>He is pre-eminent among the gods by his strength.</p>  
<p>I, 22, 5. s&aacute;<I>h</I> <I>k</I>&eacute;tt&acirc; dev&aacute;t&acirc; pad&aacute;m.</p>  
<p>He knows the place among the gods.</p>  
<p>I, 100, 15. n&acirc; y&aacute;sya dev&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> dev&aacute;t&acirc; n&aacute; m&aacute;rt&acirc;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute;pa<I>h</I> <I>k</I>an&aacute; <I>s</I>&acirc;vasa<I>h</I> &aacute;ntam &acirc;p&uacute;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>He, the end of whose power neither the gods among the gods, nor mortals, nor even the waters have reached.</p>  
<p>Here the translation of dev&aacute;t&acirc; in the sense of 'by their godhead,' would be equally applicable, yet nothing would be gained as, in either case, dev&aacute;t&acirc; is a weak repetition.</p>  
<p>VI, 4, 7. &iacute;ndram n&aacute; tv&acirc; <I>s</I>&aacute;vas&acirc; dev&aacute;t&acirc; v&acirc;y&uacute;m p<I>ri</I><I>n</I>anti r&acirc;&acute;dhas&acirc; n<I>r&iacute;</I>-tam&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The best among men celebrate thee, O Agni, as like unto Indra in strength among the gods, as like unto V&acirc;yu in liberality. See also devat&acirc;ti, VIII, 74, 3; X, 8, 2.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:9:3">3</A>. The juxta-position of <I>g</I>&acirc;&acute;yam&acirc;na<I>h</I> and <I>g</I>&acirc;t&aacute;<I>h</I> would seem to show that, if the latter had a past, the former had a future meaning. To us, 'No one who will be born and no one who has been born,' would certainly sound more natural. The Hindu, however, is familiar with the idea as here expressed, and in order to comprehend all beings, he speaks of those who are born and those who are being born. Thus in a Pada<I>s</I>ish<I>t</I>a of the P&acirc;vam&acirc;n&icirc;s (IX, 67) we read:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">yan me garbhe vasata<I>h</I> p&acirc;pam ugram,<br> ya<I>g</I> <I>g</I>&acirc;yam&acirc;nasya <I>k</I>a ki<I>m</I><I>k</I>id anyat,<br> <I>g</I>&acirc;tasya <I>k</I>a ya<I>k</I> <I>k</I>&acirc;pi vardhato me,<br> tat p&acirc;vam&acirc;n&icirc;bhir aham pun&acirc;mi.</div></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:9:4">4</A>. Karishy&acirc;&acute; is written in all the MSS. without a</p>  
<p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Visarga, and unless we add the Visarga on our own authority, we should have to take it as an entirely anomalous acc. plur. neut. of a passive participle of the future, karishy&aacute;m standing for k&acirc;rya&#771;m, faciendum. It is much easier, however, to explain this form if we add the Visarga, and read karishy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, which would then be a second person singular of a Vedic conjunctive of the future. This form occurs at least once more in the Veda:</p>  
<p>IV, 30, 23. ut&aacute; n&ucirc;n&aacute;m y&aacute;t indriy&aacute;m karishy&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> indra pa&uacute;<I>m</I>syam, ady&aacute; n&aacute;ki<I>h</I> t&aacute;t &acirc;&acute; minat.</p>  
<p>O Indra, let no man destroy to-day whatever manly feat thou art now going to achieve.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:10:1">1</A>. As I have translated these words, they sound rather abrupt. The meaning, however, would be clear enough, viz. almighty power belongs to me, therefore I can dare and do. If this abrupt expression should offend, it may be avoided, by taking the participle dadh<I>ri</I>shv&acirc;&acute;n as a finite verb, and translating, Whatever I have been daring, I shall do according to my will.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 11.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:11:1">1</A>. In this verse Indra, after having declined with no uncertain sound the friendship of the Maruts, seems to repent himself of his unkindness towards his old friends. The words of praise which they addressed to him in verse 9, in spite of the rebuff they had received from Indra, have touched his heart, and we may suppose that, after this, their reconciliation was complete. The words of Indra are clear enough, the only difficulty occurs in the last words, which are so idiomatic that it is impossible to render them in English. In tanve&#771; tan&ucirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I>, literally for the body by the bodies, tang is used like the pronoun self. Both must therefore refer to the same subject. We cannot translate 'for myself made by yourselves,' but must take the two words together, so that they should mean, 'the hymn which you have made for your own benefit and by your own exertions.'</p>  
<p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></A></p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 13.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:13:1">1</A>. Spiegel, in his review, called my attention to the Zend api-vat, which Burnouf discussed in his '&Eacute;tudes,' p. 328. Burnouf tries to show that vat in Zend has the meaning of knowing, and that it occurs with the preposition api, in apivatah&ecirc; and apivat&acirc;iti. If this is the same word as in Sanskrit, then apiv&acirc;tayati would be a causative, meaning to make known. The meaning of vat, however, is doubtful in Zend, and hardly appropriate in the few passages where it occurs in the Veda. Roth, in the Dictionary, explains vat by verstehn, begreifen, the causative by begreiflich machen; but in our passage he translates it by belebend, Ludwig by aufsp&uuml;rend. Till we get more light, I shall feel content to translate apivat by to approach, to obtain, and the causative by to make approach, to invite, to welcome.</p>  
<p>The following are the passages in which api-vat occurs:</p>  
<p>VII, 3, 10. &aacute;pi kr&aacute;tum su-<I>k</I>&eacute;tasam vatema.</p>  
<p>May we obtain an excellent understanding; not, Awaken in us a good sense.</p>  
<p>VII, 60, 6. Api kr&aacute;tum su-<I>k</I>&eacute;tasam v&aacute;tanta<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>They (Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a) obtaining an excellent understanding.</p>  
<p>I, 128, 2. t&aacute;m ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a-s&acirc;&acute;dham &aacute;pi v&acirc;tay&acirc;masi.</p>  
<p>Him, Agni, the performer of the sacrifice, we make approach, we invite.</p>  
<p>X, 20, I; 25, 1. bh&aacute;dram na<I>h</I> &aacute;pi v&acirc;taya m&aacute;na<I>h</I>, d&aacute;ksham ut&aacute; kr&aacute;tum.</p>  
<p>Bring to us, i.&nbsp;e. give us, a good mind, and a strong understanding.</p>  
<p>X, 13, 5. pitr&eacute; putr&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> api av&icirc;vatan <I>ri</I>tam.</p>  
<p>The sons obtained the right for the father (an obscure verse).</p>  
<p>As to svapiv&acirc;ta, VII, 46, 3, I should derive it from van, in the sense of implored, desired; see, however, Muir, Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 314, note; Nirukta, ed. Roth, p. 135.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:13:2">2</A>. On n&aacute;ved&acirc;<I>h</I>, see IV, 23, 4.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 14.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:14:1">1</A>. This is a verse which, without some conjectural</p>  
<p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A></p>  
<p>alterations, it seems impossible to translate. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, of course, has a translation ready for it, so has M. Langlois, but both of them offend against the simplest rules of grammar and logic. The first question is, who is meant by asm&acirc;&acute;n (which is here used as an amphimacer), the sacrificers or the Maruts? The verb &acirc;&acute; <I>k</I>akr&eacute; would well apply to the medh&acirc;&acute; m&acirc;ny&aacute;sya, the hymn of M&acirc;nya, which is intended to bring the Maruts to the sacrifice, this bringing to the sacrifice being the very meaning of &acirc; kar. But then we have the vocative maruta<I>h</I> in the next line, and even if we changed the vocative into the accusative, we should not gain much, as the Maruts could hardly call upon anybody to turn them towards the sage.</p>  
<p>If, on the contrary, we admit that asm&acirc;&acute;n refers to those who offer the sacrifice, then we must make a distinction, which, it is true, is not an unusual one, between those who here speak of themselves in the first person, and who provide the sacrifice, and the poet M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya M&acirc;nya, who was employed by them to compose or to recite this hymn.</p>  
<p>But even if we adopt this alternative, many difficulties still remain. First of all, we have to change the accent of <I>k</I>akr&eacute; into <I>k</I>akre, which may seem a slight change, but is not the less objectionable when we consider that in our emendations of the Vedic hymns we must think rather of accidents that might happen in oral traditions than of the lapsus calami of later scribes. Secondly, we must suppose that the hymn of M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya M&acirc;nya ends with verse 13, sand that the last verses were supplied by the sacrificers themselves. Possibly the dialogue only, from verse 3 to verse 12, was the work of M&acirc;nya, and the rest added at some solemn occasion.</p>  
<p>Other difficulties, however, remain. Duvasy&acirc;&acute;t is taken by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a as an ablative of duvasy&aacute;, worthy of d&uacute;vas, i.&nbsp;e. of worship, of sacrifice. Unfortunately this duvasy&aacute; does not occur again, though it would be formed quite regularly, like namasy&acirc;&acute;, worthy of worship, from n&aacute;mas, worship.</p>  
<p>If we take duvasy&acirc;&acute;t as the 3rd pers. sing. of the present in the Vedic conjunctive, we must also confess that this conjunctive does not occur again. But the verb duvasyati</p>  
<p><a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></A></p>  
<p>occurs frequently. It seems to have two meanings. It is derived from d&uacute;vas, which in the Vedic language means worship or sacrifice, just as karma, work, has assumed the special sense of sacrifice. Derived from d&uacute;vas in this sense, duvasyati means to worship. But d&uacute;vas meant originally any opus operatum. The root from which d&uacute;vas is derived, is lost in Sanskrit, but it exists in other languages. It must have been du or d&ucirc; in the sense of acting, or sedulously working. It exists in Zend as du, to do, in Gothic as t&aacute;ujan, gataujan, Old High-German zawjan, Modern German zauen (Grimm, Gram. i<sup>2</sup>. p. 1041). The Gothic tavi, opus, Old High-German zouwi, Middle High-German gez&ouml;uwe (Grimm, Gram. iii. p. 499), come from the same source; and it is possible, too, that the Old Norse taufr, modern t&ouml;frar, incantamenta, the Old High-German zoupar, Middle High-German zouber, both neuter, and the modern Zauber, may find their explanation in the Sanskrit d&uacute;vas. Derived from d&uacute;vas, in the sense of work, we have duvasyati in the sense of helping, providing, the German schaffen and verschaffen.</p>  
<p>In the sense of worshipping, duvasyati occurs,</p>  
<p>III, 2, 8. duvasy&aacute;ta&#8212;<I>g</I>&acirc;t&aacute;-vedasam.</p>  
<p>Worship G&acirc;tavedas.</p>  
<p>V, 28, 6. &acirc;&acute; <I>g</I>uhota duvasy&aacute;ta agn&iacute;m.</p>  
<p>Invoke, worship Agni. Cf. III, 13, 3; 1, 13.</p>  
<p>III, 3, 1. agn&iacute;<I>h</I> h&iacute; dev&acirc;&acute;n&#8212;duvasy&aacute;ti.</p>  
<p>Agni performs the worship of the gods. Cf. VII, 82, 5.</p>  
<p>I, 167, 6. sut&aacute;-soma<I>h</I> duvasy&aacute;n.</p>  
<p>He who has poured out Soma and worships.</p>  
<p>In many passages duvasyati is joined with an instrumental:</p>  
<p>V, 42, 11. n&aacute;ma<I>h</I>-bhi<I>h</I> dev&aacute;m&#8212;duvasya.</p>  
<p>Worship the god with praises.</p>  
<p>I, 78, 2. t&aacute;m u tv&acirc; g&oacute;tama<I>h</I> gir&acirc;&acute;&#8212;duvasyati.</p>  
<p>Gotama worships thee with a song.</p>  
<p>V, 49, 2. su-ukta&iacute;<I>h</I> dev&aacute;m&#8212;duvasya.</p>  
<p>Worship the god with hymns.</p>  
<p>VI, 16, 46. v&icirc;t&icirc;&acute; y&aacute;<I>h</I> dev&aacute;m&#8212;duvasy&eacute;t.</p>  
<p>He who worships the god with a feast.</p>  
<p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></A></p>  
<p>X, 14, 1. yam&aacute;m&#8212;hav&iacute;sh&acirc; duvasya.</p>  
<p>Worship Yama with an oblation.</p>  
<p>VI, 15, 6. agn&iacute;m-agnim va<I>h</I> sam&iacute;dh&acirc; duvasyata.</p>  
<p>Worship Agni with your log of wood. Cf. VIII, 44, 1.</p>  
<p>III, 1, 2. sam&iacute;t-bhi<I>h</I> agn&iacute;m n&aacute;mas&acirc; duvasyan.</p>  
<p>They worshipped Agni with logs of wood, with praise.</p>  
<p>In the more general and, I suppose, more original sense of caring for, attending, we find duvasyati:</p>  
<p>III, 51, 3. aneh&aacute;sa<I>h</I> st&uacute;bha<I>h</I> &iacute;ndra<I>h</I> duvasyati.</p>  
<p>Indra provides for the matchless worshippers.</p>  
<p>I, 112, 15. kal&iacute;m y&acirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I>&#8212;duvasy&aacute;tha<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>By the succours with which you help Kali. Cf. I, 112, 21.</p>  
<p>I, 62, 10. duvasy&aacute;nti sv&aacute;s&acirc;ra<I>h</I> &aacute;hray&acirc;<I>n</I>am.</p>  
<p>The sisters attend the proud (Agni).</p>  
<p>I, 119, 10. yuv&aacute;m ped&aacute;ve&#8212;<I>s</I>vet&aacute;m&#8212;duvasyatha<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>You provide for Pedu the white horse.</p>  
<p>If, then, we take duvasyati in the sense of working for, assisting, it may be with the special sense of assisting at a sacred act, like &#0948;&#0953;&#0945;&#0954;&#0959;&#0957;&#0949;&#8150;&#0957;; and if we take duv&aacute;s, as it has the accent on the last syllable, as the performer of a sacrifice, we may venture to translate, 'that he should help, as the singer helps the performer of the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>': The singer or the poet may be called the assistant at a sacrifice, for his presence was not necessary at all sacrifices, the songs constituting an ornament rather than an essential part in most sacred acts. But though I think it right to offer this conjectural interpretation, I am far from supposing that it gives us the real sense of this difficult verse. Duvasy&acirc;&acute;t may be, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a suggests, an ablative of duvasy&aacute;; and duvasy&aacute;, like namasy&acirc;&acute;, if we change the accent, may mean he who is to be worshipped, or worshipping. In this way a different interpretation might suggest itself, though I confess I do not see that any other interpretation as yet suggested is satisfactory. Some happy thought may some day or other clear up this difficulty, when those who have</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></A></p>  
<p>toiled, but toiled in a wrong direction, will receive scant thanks for the trouble they have taken. See Bollensen, Z.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G. XVIII, p. 606.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:14:2">2</A>. In the second line, the words &oacute; s&uacute; varta remind us of similar phrases in the Veda, but we want an accusative, governed by varta; whereas maruta<I>h</I>, to judge from its accent, can only be a vocative. Thus we read:</p>  
<p>I, 138, 4. &oacute; (&iacute;ti) s&uacute; tv&acirc; vav<I>ri</I>t&icirc;mahi st&oacute;mebhi<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>May we turn thee quickly hither by our praises!</p>  
<p>VIII, 7, 83. &oacute; (&iacute;ti) s&uacute; v<I>r&iacute;</I>sh<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>&#8212;vav<I>ri</I>ty&acirc;&acute;m.</p>  
<p>May I turn the heroes quickly hither!</p>  
<p>Compare also passages like III, 33, 8:</p>  
<p>&oacute; (&iacute;ti) s&uacute; svas&acirc;ra<I>h</I> k&acirc;r&aacute;ve <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>ota.</p>  
<p>Listen quickly, O sisters, to the poet.</p>  
<p>I, 139, 7. &oacute; (&iacute;ti) s&uacute; na<I>h</I> agne <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>uhi.</p>  
<p>Hear us quickly, O Agni.</p>  
<p>Cf. I, 182, 1; II, 34, 15; VII, 59, 5; VIII, 2, 19; X, 179, 2.</p>  
<p>Unless we change the accent, we must translate, 'Bring hither quickly!' and we must take these words as addressed to the k&acirc;r&uacute;, the poet, whose hymn is supposed to attract the gods to the sacrifice. By a quick transition, the next words, maruta<I>h</I> v&iacute;pram &aacute;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a, would then have to be taken as addressed to the gods, 'Maruts, on to the sage!' and the last words would become intelligible by laying stress on the va<I>h</I>, 'for you, and not for Indra or any other god, has the singer recited these hymns.' See, however, Preface, <A HREF="sbe3202.htm#page_xxi">p. xxi</A>.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 15.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:15:1">1</A>. I translate M&acirc;nya, the son of M&acirc;na, because the poet, so called in I, 189, 8, is in all probability the same as our M&acirc;nd&acirc;rya M&acirc;nya. But it may also be M&acirc;nya, the descendant of Mand&acirc;ri. The M&acirc;nas are mentioned I, 172, 5;182, 8.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:15:2">2</A>. V&acirc;<I>g</I>.. S. XXXIV, 48. The second line is difficult, owing to the uncertain meaning of vay&acirc;&acute;m.</p>

<p>When you Maruts came forth with your fallow deer and your horses.</p>  
<p>But what is the meaning of vay&acirc;&acute;m? Vay&acirc;&acute; means a germ, a sprout, an offshoot, a branch, as may be seen from the following passages:</p>  
<p>II, 5, 4. vidv&acirc;&acute;n asya vrat&acirc;&acute; dhruv&acirc;&acute; vay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>-iva &aacute;nu rohate.</p>  
<p>He who knows his eternal laws, springs up like young sprouts. (Better vay&acirc;&acute;-iva.)</p>

<p>From above the head of Vai<I>s</I>vanara all worlds have grown; like young sprouts.</p>  
<p>VIII, 13, 6. stot&acirc;&acute;&#8212;vay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>-iva &aacute;nu rohate. (Better vay&acirc;&acute;-iva.)</p>  
<p>The worshipper grows up like young sprouts.</p>  
<p>VIII, 13, 17. &iacute;ndram ksho<I>n</I>&icirc;&acute;<I>h</I> avardhayan vay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>-iva.</p>  
<p>The people made Indra to grow like young sprouts.</p>

<p>Agni, of whom the other fires are like parasitical shoots.</p>  
<p>I, 59, 1. vay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &iacute;t agne agn&aacute;ya<I>h</I> te any&eacute;.</p>  
<p>O Agni, the other fires are indeed offshoots of thee.</p>  
<p>II, 35, 8. vay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &iacute;t any&acirc;&acute; bh&uacute;van&acirc;ni asya.</p>  
<p>The other worlds are indeed his (the rising sun's) offshoots.</p>

<p>Like birds (?) flying up to a branch, the flames of Agni went up to heaven; (or like strong men reaching up to.)</p>

<p>VI, 57, 5. t&acirc;&acute;m p&ucirc;sh<I>n</I>&aacute;<I>h</I> su-mat&iacute;m vay&aacute;m v<I>ri</I>ksh&aacute;sya pr&aacute; vay&acirc;&acute;m-iva &iacute;ndrasya <I>k</I>a &acirc;&acute; rabh&acirc;mahe.</p>  
<p>Let us reach this favour of P&ucirc;shan and of Indra, as one reaches forth to the branch of a tree.</p>  
<p>There remain some doubtful passages in which vay&acirc;&acute; occurs, VII, 40, 5, and X, 92, 3; 134, 6. In the first passage, as in our own, vay&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> is trisyllabic.</p>  
<p>If vay&acirc;&acute; can be used in the sense of offshoot or sprout, we may conclude that the same word, used in the singular, might mean offspring, particularly when joined with tanve&#771;. 'Give a branch to our body,' would be understood even in languages less metaphorical than that of the Vedas; and as the prayer for 'olive branches' is a constant theme of the Vedic poets, the very absence of that prayer here, might justify us in assigning this sense to vay&acirc;&acute;m. In VI, 2, 5, the expression vay&acirc;&acute;vantam ksh&aacute;yam, a house with branches, means the same as n<I>ri</I>v&aacute;ntam, a house with children and men. See M.&nbsp;M., On &#0914;&#0943;&#0959;&#0962; and v&aacute;yas, in Kuhn's Zeitschrift, vol. xv, p. 215. Benfey (Endungen in &icirc;ans, p. 37) takes vay&acirc;m as a genitive plural, referring it to the Maruts, as closely connected with each other, like branches of a tree. This is much the same interpretation as that of Mah&icirc;dhara (VS. XXXIV, 48), who translates 'come near for the body, i.&nbsp;e. for the bodily strength of the fellows, the Maruts.' Ludwig takes it as a possible instrumental of vayam.</p>  
<p>It is preferable, however, to take y&acirc;s&icirc;sh<I>t</I>a as a precative &Acirc;tm., in order to account for the long &icirc;, and to accept it as a third person singular, referring to st&oacute;ma<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:165:15:3">3</A>. V<I>ri</I><I>g</I>&aacute;na means an enclosure, a &#0957;&#0959;&#0956;&#8057;&#0962;, whether it be derived from v<I>ri</I><I>g</I>, to ward off; like arx from arcere, or from v<I>ri</I><I>g</I>, in the sense of clearing, as in v<I>ri</I>kta-barhis, barh&iacute;<I>h</I> pr&aacute;. v<I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>e, I, 116, 1. In either case the meaning remains much the same, viz. a field, cleared for pasture or agriculture,&#8212;a clearing, as it is called in America, or a camp,&#8212;enclosed with hurdles or walls, so as to be capable of defence against wild animals or against enemies. In this sense, however, v<I>ri</I><I>g</I>ana is a neuter, while as a masculine it means powerful, invigorating. See Preface, <A HREF="sbe3202.htm#page_xx">p. xx</A>.</p>
