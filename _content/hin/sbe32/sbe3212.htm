<p>This subject is so important, and affects so large a number of passages in the Veda, that it requires the <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The four principal P&acirc;das.</FONT></span>most careful examination. The Vedic metres, though at first sight very perplexing, are very simple, if reduced to their primary elements. The authors of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khyas have elaborated a most complicated system. Counting the syllables in the most mechanical manner, they have assigned nearly a hundred names to every variety which they discovered in the hymns of the Rig-veda&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_57"></A><A HREF="#fn_48"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. But they also observed that the constituent elements of all these metres were really but four, (S&ucirc;tras 988, 989):</p>  
<p>1. The G&acirc;yatra p&acirc;da, of eight syllables, ending in &nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;.</p>  
<p>2. The Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a p&acirc;da, of ten syllables, ending in &nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;.</p>  
<p>3. The Traish<I>t</I>ubha p&acirc;da, of eleven syllables, ending in &nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;.</p>  
<p>4. The <I>G</I>&acirc;gata p&acirc;da, of twelve syllables, ending in &nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;.</p>  
<p>Then follows an important rule, S&ucirc;tra 990: 'The penultimate syllable,' he says, in a G&acirc;yatra and <I>G</I>&acirc;gata p&acirc;da is light (laghu), in a Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a and Traish<I>t</I>ubha p&acirc;da heavy (guru).' This is called their v<I>ri</I>tta.</p>  
<p>This word v<I>ri</I>tta, which is generally translated by metre, had evidently originally a more special meaning. It meant the final rhythm, or if we take it literally, the <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">V<I>ri</I>tta = versus.</FONT></span> turn of a line, for it is derived from v<I>ri</I>t, to turn. Hence v<I>ri</I>tta is the same word as the Latin versus, verse; but I do not wish to decide whether the connection between the two words is historical, or simply etymological. In Latin, versus is always supposed to have meant originally a furrow, then a line, then a verse. In Sanskrit the metaphor that led to the formation of v<I>ri</I>tta, in the sense of final rhythm, has nothing to do with ploughing. If, as I have tried to prove (Chips from a German Workshop,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcvi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcvi</font></A></p>  
<p>vol. i, p. 84), the names assigned to metres and metrical language were derived from words originally referring to choregic movements, v<I>ri</I>tta must have meant the turn, i.&nbsp;e. the last step of any given movement; and this turn, as determining the general character of the whole movement, would naturally be regulated by more severe rules, while greater freedom would be allowed for the rest.</p>  
<p>Having touched on this subject, I may add another fact in support of my view. The words Trish<I>t</I>ubh and Anush<I>t</I>ubh, names for the most common metres, are generally derived from a root stubh, to praise. I believe they should be derived from a root stubh, which is preserved in Greek, not only in &#0963;&#0964;&#0965;&#0966;&#0949;&#0955;&#8057;&#0962;, hard, &#0963;&#0964;&#0965;&#0966;&#0949;&#0955;&#0943;&#0950;&#0969;, to strike hard, but in the root &#0963;&#0964;&#0949;&#0956;&#0966;, from which &#0963;&#0964;&#8051;&#0956;&#0966;&#0965;&#0955;&#0959;&#0957;, stamped or pressed olives or grapes, and &#7936;&#0963;&#0964;&#0949;&#0956;&#0966;&#8053;&#0962;, untrodden (grapes), then unshaken; and in &#0963;&#0964;&#8051;&#0956;&#0946;&#0969;, to shake, to ram, &#0963;&#0964;&#0959;&#0946;&#8051;&#0969;, to scold, &amp;c. In Sanskrit this root is mentioned in the Dh&acirc;tup&acirc;<I>th</I>a X, 34, shtubhu stambhe, and it exists in a parallel form as stambh, lit. to stamp down, then to fix, to make firm, with which Bopp has compared the German stampfen, to stamp; (Glossarium, s.&nbsp;v. stambh.) I therefore look upon Trish<I>t</I>ubh as meaning originally tripudium, (supposing this word to be derived from tri and pes, according to the expression in Horace, pepulisse ter pede terram, Hor. Od. iii. i8,) and I explain its name 'Three-step,' by the fact that the three last syllables &nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#774;, which form the characteristic feature of that metre, and may be called its real v<I>ri</I>tta or turn, were audibly stamped at the end of each turn or strophe. I explain Anush<I>t</I>ubh, which consists of four equal p&acirc;das, each of eight syllables, as the 'After-step,' because each line was stamped regularly after the other, possibly by two choruses, each side taking its turn. There is one passage in the Veda where Anush<I>t</I>ubh seems to have preserved this meaning:</p>  
<p>X, 124, 9. anu-st&uacute;bham &aacute;nu <I>k</I>ar<I>k</I>&ucirc;ry&aacute;m&acirc;<I>n</I>am &iacute;ndram n&iacute; <I>k</I>ikyu<I>h</I> kav&aacute;ya<I>h</I> man&icirc;sh&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Poets by their wisdom discovered Indra dancing to an Anush<I>t</I>ubh.</p>  
<p>In V, 52, 12, <I>kh</I>anda<I>h</I>-st&uacute;bha<I>h</I> kubhany&aacute;va<I>h</I> &uacute;tsam &acirc;&acute;</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcvii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcvii</font></A></p>  
<p>k&icirc;r&iacute;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> n<I>ri</I>tu<I>h</I>, in measured steps (i.&nbsp;e. stepping the metre) and wildly shouting the gleemen have danced toward the spring.</p>  
<p>Other names of metres which point to a similar origin, i.&nbsp;e. to their original connection with dances, are Pada-pa&#7749;kti, 'Step-row;' Nya&#7749;ku-s&acirc;ri<I>n</I>&icirc;, 'Roe-step;' Abhis&acirc;ri<I>n</I>&icirc;, 'Contre-danse,' &amp;c.</p>  
<p>If now we return to the statement of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya in reference to the v<I>ri</I>ttas, we should observe how careful its author is in his language. He does not say that the penultimate is long or short, but he simply states, that, from a metrical point of view, it must be considered as light or heavy, which need not mean more than that it must be pronounced with or without stress. The fact that the author of the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya uses these terms, laghu and guru, instead of hrasva, short, and d&icirc;rgha, long, shows in fact that he was aware that the penultimate in these p&acirc;das is not invariably long or short, though, from a metrical point of view, it is always heavy or light.</p>  
<p>It is perfectly true that if we keep to these four p&acirc;das, (to which one more p&acirc;da, viz. the half Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a, consisting of five syllables, might be added) we can reduce nearly all the hymns of the Rig-veda to their simple elements which the ancient poets combined together, in general in a very simple way, but occasionally with greater freedom. The most important strophes, formed out of these p&acirc;das, are,</p>  
<p>1. Three G&acirc;yatra p&acirc;das = the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, (24 syllables.)</p>  
<p>2. Four G&acirc;yatra p&acirc;das = the Anush<I>t</I>ubh, (32 syllables.)</p>  
<p>3. Four Vair&acirc;<I>g</I>a p&acirc;das = the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>, (40 syllables.)</p>  
<p>4. Four Traish<I>t</I>ubha p&acirc;das = the Trish<I>t</I>ubh, (44 syllables.)</p>  
<p>5. Four <I>G</I>&acirc;gata p&acirc;das = the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;, (48 syllables.)</p>  
<p>Between the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; and Anush<I>t</I>ubh strophes, another strophe may be formed, by mixture of G&acirc;yatra and <I>G</I>&acirc;gata p&acirc;das, consisting of 28 syllables, and commonly called Ush<I>n</I>ih; likewise between the Anush<I>t</I>ubh and the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>, a strophe may be formed, consisting of 36 syllables, and commonly called B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;.</p>  
<p>In a collection of hymns, however, like that of the Rig-veda, where poems of different ages, different places, and</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcviii</font></A></p>  
<p>different families have been put together, we must be prepared for exceptions to many rules. Thus, although the final turn of the hendecasyllabic Traish<I>t</I>ubha is, as a rule, the bacchius, &nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;, yet if we take, for instance, the 77th hymn of the tenth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala, we clearly perceive another hendecasyllabic p&acirc;da of a totally different structure, and worked up into one of the most beautiful strophes by an ancient poet. Each line is divided into two halves, the first consisting of seven syllables, being an exact counterpart of the first member of a Saturnian verse (fato Romae Metelli); the second a dijambus, answering boldly to the broken rhythm of the first member&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_58"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. We have, in fact, a Trish<I>t</I>ubh where the turn or the three-step, &nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;, instead of being at the end, stands in the middle of the line.</p>  
<p>X, 77, 1-5, in the Pada text:</p>  
<p>1. a&#772;bhra&#772;-pru&#774;sha&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; v&acirc;&#772;<I>k</I>&acirc;&#772;&nbsp;&#781; pru&#774;sha&#774;&#773; va&#774;su&#772;,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ha&#774;vi&#772;shma&#772;nta&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; ya&#772;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;&#772;<I>h</I>&nbsp;&#781; vi&#774;-<I>g</I>&acirc;&#772;nu&#774;sha&#772;<I>h</I> | &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Another strophe, the nature of which has been totally misapprehended by native metricians, occurs in IV, 10. It is there called Padapa&#7749;kti and Mah&acirc;padapa&#7749;kti; nay, attempts have been made to treat it even as an Ush<I>n</I>ih, or as a kind of G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. The real character of that strophe is so palpable that it is difficult to understand how it could have been mistaken. It consists of two lines, the first embracing three or four feet of five syllables each, having the ictus on the first and the fourth syllables, and resembling the last line of a Sapphic verse. The second line is simply</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_xcix"><font size="1" color="green">p. xcix</font></A></p>  
<p>a Trish<I>t</I>ubh. It is what we should call an asynartete strophe, and the contrast of the rhythm in the first and second lines is very effective. I am not certain whether Professor Bollensen, who has touched on this metre in an article just published (Zeitschrift der D.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G., vol. xxii, p. 572), shares this opinion. He has clearly seen that the division of the lines, as given in the MSS. of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text, is wrong; but he seems inclined to admit the same rhythm throughout, and to treat the strophe as consisting of four lines of five syllables each, and one of six syllables, which last line is to submit to the prevailing rhythm of the preceding lines. If we differ, however, as to the internal architecture of this strophe, we agree in condemning the interpretation proposed by the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya; and I should, in connection with this, like to call attention to two important facts: first, that the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text, in not changing, for instance, the final t of mart&acirc;t, betrays itself as clearly later than the elaboration of the ancient theory of metres, later than the invention of such a metre as the Padapa&#7749;kti; and secondly, that the accentuation, too, of the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; is thus proved to be posterior to the establishment of these fanciful metrical divisions, and hence cannot throughout claim so irrefragable an authority as certainly belongs to it in many cases. I give the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; text:</p>  
<p>1. A&#772;gne&#772; ta&#774;m a&#772;dya&#772; | a&#772;sva&#772;<I>m</I> na&#774; sto&#772;ma&#772;i<I>h</I> | kra&#774;tu&#772;<I>m</I> na&#774; bha&#772;dra&#772;m,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;h<i>ri&#774;</i>di&#772;sp<i>ri&#774;</i><I>s</I>a&#774;m <i>ri&#773;</i>dhy&#774;&acirc;&#772;m&acirc;&#772; ta&#774; o&#772;hai&#772;<I>h</I>.<br> 2. A&#774;dh&acirc;&#772; hy a&#772;gne&#772; | kra&#774;to&#772;r bha&#772;dra&#772;sya&#774; | da&#772;ksha&#772;sya&#774; s&acirc;&#772;dho&#772;<I>h</I>,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ra&#774;th&icirc;&#772;r <i>ri&#774;</i>ta&#772;sya&#774; b<i>ri&#774;</i>ha&#774;to&#772; ba&#774;bh&ucirc;&#772;tha&#772;, &amp;c.</p>  
<p>Now it is perfectly true that, as a general rule, the syllables composing the v<I>ri</I>tta or turn of the different metres, and described by the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya as heavy or light, are in reality long or short. The question, however, is this, have we a right, or are we obliged, in cases where that syllable is not either long or short, as it ought to be, so to alter the text, or so to change the rules of pronunciation, that the penultimate may again be what we wish it to be?</p>  
<p>If we begin with the G&acirc;yatra p&acirc;da, we have not to read</p>  
<p><a name="page_c"><font size="1" color="green">p. c</font></A></p>  
<p>long before we find that it would be hopeless to try to crush the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses of the Vedic <I>Ri</I>shis on this <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">G&acirc;yatra P&acirc;das.</FONT></span>Procrustean bed. Even Professor Kuhn very soon perceived that this was impossible. He had to admit that in the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; the two first p&acirc;das, at all events, were free from this rule, and though he tried to retain it for the third or final p&acirc;da, he was obliged after a time to give it up even there. Again, it is perfectly true, that in the third p&acirc;da of the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, and in the second and fourth p&acirc;das of the Anush<I>t</I>ubh strophe, greater care is taken by the poets to secure a short syllable for the penultimate, but here, too, exceptions cannot be entirely removed. We have only to take such a single hymn as I, 27, and we shall see that it would be impossible to reduce it to the uniform standard of G&acirc;yatr&icirc; p&acirc;das, all ending in a dijambus.</p>

Even if we object to the endings &nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772; and &nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;, V, 33, 4, may be a <I>G</I>&acirc;gata, with vy&ucirc;ha of d&acirc;sa, the remark quoted from the Pr&acirc;ti<I>s</I>&acirc;khya being of no consequence on such points; and the same remedy would apply to V, 41, 5, with vy&ucirc;ha of eshe. In VI, 47, 31, vy&ucirc;ha of a<I>s</I>vapar<I>n</I>ai<I>h</I>; in I, 33, 9, vy&ucirc;ha of indra and rodas&icirc;; in II, 24, 5, vy&ucirc;ha of m&acirc;dbhi<I>h</I> would produce the same effect; while in I, 121, 8, we must either admit the Traish<I>t</I>ubha v<I>ri</I>tta &nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772; or scan dhu&#772;ksh&#774;a&#772;n. In III, 58, 6, I should admit vy&ucirc;ha for na&#774;r&#774;&acirc;&#772;; in IV, 26, 6, for ma&#772;ndr&#774;a&#772;m; in I, 100, 8, for gy&#774;o&#772;ti&#772;<I>h</I>, always supposing that we consider the ending &nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#774;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#772; incompatible with a Trish<I>t</I>ubh verse.</P>
