### MA*ND*ALA VII, HYMN 59.

#### ASH*T*AKA V, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 29-30.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts and Rudra</span>.

1\. Whom you protect again and again, O gods, and whom you lead, to him,
O Agni, Varu*n*a, Mitra, Aryaman, and Maruts, yield your protection.

2\. He who sacrifices, O gods, overcomes his enemies by your protection
on a happy day. He who gives to your delight, spreads forth his
dwelling, spreads out much food.

3\. This Vasish*th*a will not despise even the last among you, O Maruts;
drink [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:3:1) all of you, to-day, at my libation
here, full of desire.

4\. Your help does not indeed fail that man in battle to whom you
granted it, O men! Your newest favour has turned hither, come quick
then, ye who wish to drink.

5\. O ye whose gifts are cheering, come to drink the (juice of the Soma)
flowers: these are your libations, O Maruts, for I gave them to you, do
not go elsewhere!

6\. Sit down on our altar and protect [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:6:1) us,
to give us brilliant riches. O Maruts, who never miss the Soma mead,
hail to you here to enjoy yourselves.

7\. Having adorned their bodies, the swans with dark blue backs came
flying in secret [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:7:1)—the whole flock sat down
all around me, like gay men, delighting in the Soma offering.

8\. O Maruts, that hateful man who beyond our thoughts tries to hurt us,
O Vasus, may he catch the snares of Drub, kill him with your hottest
bolt!

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

9\. O you Maruts, full of heat, here is the libation; be pleased to
accept it, O you who destroy the enemies by your help
[1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:9:1).

10\. O you who accept the domestic sacrifices
[1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:10:1), come hither, O Maruts, do not keep away,
you who are bounteous by your help [2](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:10:2).

11\. O Maruts, strong and wise, with sun-bright skins, I choose the
sacrifice for you here and there [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:11:1)

12\. We sacrifice to Tryambaka [1](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:12:1), the
sweet-scented, wealth-increasing (Rudra). May I be detached from death,
like a gourd from its stem, but not [2](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:12:2) from
the immortal [3](sbe3249.htm#an_7:59:12:3).

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Vasish*th*a. Verse 12 addressed to Rudra.

Verse 3 occurs SV. I, 241; verse 8, AV. VII, 77, 2; TS. IV, 3, 13, 3;
MS. IV, 10, 5; verse 9, AV. VII, 77, 1; TS. IV, 3, 13, 3; MS. IV, 10, 5;
verse 10, TS. IV, 3, 13, 5; MS. IV, 10, 5; verse 11, TÂ. I, 4, 3; MS.
IV, 10, 3; verse 12, VS. III, 60; AV. XIV, 1, 17; TS. I, 8, 6, 2; MS. I,
10, 4; TA. X, 56; *S*at. Br. II, 6, 2, 12.

Metre, 1, 3, 5 B*ri*hatî; 2, 4, 6 Satob*ri*hatî; 7, 8 Trish*t*ubh; 9,
10, 11 Gâyatrî; 12 Anush*t*ubh.

##### Verse 2.

With pâda a compare I, 110, 7; with c and d, VIII, 27, 16.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_7:59:3:1">1</span>. SV. has pibantu, and as a various
reading the comment. gives pivanta. Suté sá*k*â is a standing phrase.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_7:59:6:1">1</span>. I cannot see how avitá can stand
for avishta (Delbrück, Verb, 186; Whitney, Gram. § 908). I translate as
if the text gave ávatâ.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_7:59:7:1">1</span>. On the secret approach of the
Maruts, see I, 88, 5.

##### Verse 8.

The text in the AV. VII, 77, 2, is bad, yó no márto maruto
durh*rin*âyús, práti mu*ñk*atâm sá*h*, and tápasâ for hánmanâ. The TS.
IV, 3, 13, 3, has tirá*h* satyâ´ni. It reads besides, yó no márto vasavo
durh*rin*âyús tirá*h* satyâ´ni maruta*h* *g*íghâ*m*̐sât druhá*h*
pâ´*s*am, and tápasâ. Tirá*h* *k*ittâ´ni may mean 'beyond all
conception,' as Grassmann takes it, or 'unobserved,' as B.-R. suggest.
Tirá*h* satyâ´ni might mean 'in spite of all pledges,' but that is
probably an emendation. All this shows the unsettled state of Vedic
tradition, outside that of the Rig-veda; see Oldenberg, Prolegomena, p.
328.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_7:59:9:1">1</span>. Ûtî´, taken here as a dative, by
Lanman, p. 382.

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_7:59:10:1">1</span>. On the Maruts g*ri*hamedhina*h*,
see *S*at. Br. II, 5, 3, 4. Possibly the Maruts may be called
g*ri*hamedhas, i. e. g*ri*hasthas, performing the G*ri*hya sacrifices.
See on these names TS. I, 8, 4, 1; 2.

Note <span id="an_7:59:10:2">2</span>. The last pâda in the TS. is
pramu*ñk*ánto no á*m*hasa*h*.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_7:59:11:1">1</span>. On ihéha, see Delbrück, Syntax,
p. 51. It means 'here and there,' that is, 'again and again.'

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_7:59:12:1">1</span>. Tryambaka is a name of Rudra, but
its original meaning is doubtful. Some commentators explain it by
'three-eyed,' but its natural meaning would be 'having three mothers.'
The *S*at. Br. II, 6, 2, 9, derives it from Stry-ambikâ, because Ambikâ,
Rudra's sister, shares the sacrifice with him.

Note <span id="an_7:59:12:2">2</span>. On mâ with optative, see
Delbrück, Synt. Forsch. I, 194; Syntax, 338, 361, Anm. 1.

Note <span id="an_7:59:12:3">3</span>. That am*ri*tât is right, not, as
Grassmann suggests, am*ri*ta, is clear from the parallel forms, prétó
mu*ñk*âmi nâ´múta*h*, or itó mukshîya mâ´múta*h*. Pischel in Z. D. M. G.
XL, 121, demands too much logical accuracy from a poet; see AV. XIV, I,
17; VS. III, 60.

All scholars seem to agree that this hymn is a composite hymn, and that
it breaks the law of decrease in the number of verses. It begins with
three Pragâthas, verses 1 and 2, 3 and 4, 5 and 6, which may be in their
right place. Then follow two Trish*t*ubhs, 7 and 8, which may form a
hymn by themselves. The next three Gâyatrîs, which clearly belong
together, are a later addition; so is the last verse, which ought to
stand in the Atharva rather than in the Rig-veda. The Pada text does not
divide this last verse. See on this subject, Oldenberg, Z. D. M. G.
XXXVIII, 449 seq., Proleg. 200; 511; Bergaigne, Recherches sur
l’histoire de la Sa*m*hitâ, II, 10.
