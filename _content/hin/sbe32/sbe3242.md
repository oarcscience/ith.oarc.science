### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 60.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 25.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To Agni and the Maruts</span>.

1\. I implore [1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:1) Agni, the gracious, with
salutations, may he sit down here, and gather what we have made
[2](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:2). I offer [3](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:1:3) (him
sacrifice) as with racing chariots; may I, turning to the right,
accomplish this hymn to the Maruts.

2\. Those who approached on their glorious deer, on their easy chariots,
the Rudras, the Maruts,—through fear of you, ye terrible ones, the
forests even bend down, the earth shakes, and also the mountain (cloud).

3\. At your shouting, even the mountain (cloud), grown large, fears, and
the ridge of heaven trembles. When you play together, O Maruts, armed
with spears, you run together like waters.

4\. Like rich suitors the Maruts have themselves
[1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:4:1) adorned their bodies with golden ornaments;
more glorious for glory [2](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:4:2), and powerful on
their chariots, they have brought together splendours on their bodies.

5\. As brothers, no one being the eldest or the youngest, they have
grown up together to happiness. Young is their clever father Rudra,
flowing with plenty is P*ris*ni (their mother), always kind to the
Maruts.

6\. O happy Maruts, whether you are in the highest, or in the middle, or
in the lowest heaven, from thence, O Rudras, or thou also, O Agni. take
notice of this libation which we offer.

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

7\. When Agni, and you, wealthy Maruts, drive down from the higher
heaven over the ridges, give then, if pleased, you roarers, O destroyers
of enemies [1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:7:1), wealth to the sacrificer who
prepares (Soma juice).

8\. Agni, be pleased to drink Soma with the brilliant Maruts, the
singers, approaching in companies [1](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:8:1), with the
men (Âyus [2](sbe3242.htm#an_5:60:8:2)), who brighten and enliven
everything; do this, O Vai*s*vânara (Agni), thou who art always endowed
with splendour.

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

#### NOTES.

This hymn, by the same poet, is supposed to be addressed either to the
Maruts alone, or to the Maruts and Agni. The same might have been said
of hymn 56 and others which are used for the Âgnimâruta *S*astra. See
Bergaigne, Recherches sur l’histoire de la liturgie védique, p. 38.
Metre, 1-6 Trish*t*ubh; 7, 8 *G*agatî. No verse of this hymn occurs in
SV., VS., AV., TS., TB., except verse i in AV. VII, 50, 3; TB. II, 7,
12, 4; MS. IV, 14, 11; verse 3 in TS. III, 1, 11, 5; MS. IV, 12, 5;
verse 6 in TB. II, 7, 12, 4.

##### Verse 1.

The AV. reads svâ´vasum, prasaktó, pradakshi*n*ám, all of them inferior
readings. The TB. agrees with RV., except that it seems to read
prasaptá*h* (prakarshe*n*a samâgata*h*).

Note <span id="an_5:60:1:1">1</span>. That î*l* or î*d* has originally
the meaning of imploring, asking, begging, we see from such passages as
RV. III, 48, 3. upasthâya mâtáram ánnam ai*tt*a, 'he, having approached
his mother, asked for food,' unless we prefer to construe î*d* with two
accusatives, 'he, having approached, asked his mother for food.' The
same verb is also construed with the accusative of the god implored, the
dative of the object, and the instrumental of the means by which he is
implored. See RV. VIII, 71, 14. agním î*li*shva ávase gâ´thâbhi*h*,
implore Agni with songs for his protection. Whether the root î*d* is
distantly connected with either ish, to desire (Brugmann, I, 591), or
with ard, to stir, or with ar, to go, is a question which admits of
many, or of no answer.

Note <span id="an_5:60:1:2">2</span>. Vi*k*i k*ri*tam seems to have the
settled meaning of gathering in what one has made at play, or in battle;
see X, 42, 9; 43, 5; IX, 97, 58; X, 102, 2. The same meaning is
applicable here, though we may also translate, Take notice of our
k*ri*ta or our karma, i. e. the sacrifice.' A similar thought is
expressed in verse 6. Sâya*n*a explains vi*g*ânâtu and vi*k*inuyât.

Note <span id="an_5:60:1:3">3</span>. Perhaps prá bhare means, 'I am
carried forth,' as in V, 59, 4, where it is applied to the Maruts.

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:60:4:1">1</span>. See note 2 to I, 6, 4. Instead of
svadhâ´bhi*h* we have svayám in VII, 56, 11.

Note <span id="an_5:60:4:2">2</span>. *S*riyé *s*réyâ*m*sa*h* is
difficult to translate; cf. II, 33, 3. srésh*th*a*h* *s*riyâ´ asi.
Ludwig translates, zu herlichkeit die herlichen.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_5:60:7:1">1</span>. On ri*s*âdas, see Aufrecht,
Bezzenb. Beitr. XIV, p. 32.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:60:8:1">1</span>. On ga*n*a*s*rî´, see BR. s. v.;
Lanman, 372; Benfey Vedica und Verwandtes, p. 108; Pischel, Ved. Stud.
I, 53 seq. Ludwig translates scharenherlich, but what does that mean?
'Shining in their companies' is a possible meaning, but the analogy of
abhi*s*rî´ and adhvara*s*rî´ points in another direction.

Note <span id="an_5:60:8:2">2</span>. On the Âyus as a proper name, see
Bergaigne, Rel. Véd. I, 62; II, 323.
