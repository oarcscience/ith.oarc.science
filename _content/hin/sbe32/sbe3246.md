### MA*ND*ALA VII, HYMN 56.

#### ASH*T*AKA V, ADHYÂYA 4, VARGA 23-26.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. Who are these resplendent men, dwelling together, the boys of Rudra,
also [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:1:1) with good horses?

2\. No one indeed knows their births, they alone know each other's
birthplace.

3\. They plucked each other with their beaks
[1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:3:1); the hawks, rushing like the wind, strove
together.

4\. A wise man understands these secrets [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:4:1),
that P*ris*ni, the great, bore an udder.

5\. May that clan be rich in heroes by the Maruts, always victorious,
rich in manhood!

6\. They are quickest to go, most splendid with splendour, endowed with
beauty, strong with strength.

7\. Strong is your strength, steadfast your powers, and thus by the
Maruts is this clan mighty.

8\. Resplendent is your breath, furious are the minds of the wild host,
like a shouting maniac [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:8:1).

9\. Keep from us entirely your flame, let not your hatred reach us here.

10\. I call on the dear names of your swift ones, so that the greedy
should be satisfied [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:10:1), O Maruts,

11\. The well-armed, the swift, decked with beautiful chains, who
themselves adorn their bodies.

12\. Bright are the libations for you, the bright ones, O Maruts, a
bright sacrifice I prepare for the bright. In proper order came those
who truly follow the order, the bright born, the bright, the pure.

13\. On your shoulders, O Maruts, are the rings,

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

on your chests the golden chains are fastened; far-shining like
lightnings with showers [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:13:1), you wield your
weapons, according to your wont.

14\. Your hidden [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:14:1) splendours come forth;
spread out your powers (names), O racers! Accept, O Maruts, this
thousandfold, domestic share, as an offering for the house-gods
[2](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:14:2).

15\. If you thus listen, O Maruts, to this praise, at the invocation of
the powerful sage, give him quickly a share of wealth in plentiful
offspring, which no selfish enemy shall be able to hurt.

16\. The Maruts, who are fleet like racers, the manly youths, shone like
Yakshas [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:16:1); they are beautiful like boys
standing round the hearth, they play about like calves who are still
sucking.

17\. May the bounteous Maruts be gracious to us, opening up to us the
firm heaven and earth. May that bolt of yours which kills cattle and
men, be far from us! Incline to us, O Vasus, with your favours.

18\. The Hot*ri* priest calls on you again and again, sitting down and
praising your common gift, O Maruts. O strong ones, he who is the
guardian of so much wealth, he calls on you with praises, free from
guile.

19\. These Maruts stop the swift, they bend strength by strength
[1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:19:1), they ward off the curse of the plotter,
and turn [2](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:19:2) their heavy hatred on the enemy.

20\. These Maruts stir up even the sluggard
[1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:20:1), even the vagrant
[2](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:20:2), as the gods [3](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:20:3)
pleased. O strong ones, drive away the darkness, and grant us all our
kith and kin.

21\. May we not fall away from your bounty, O

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Maruts, may we not
stay behind, O charioteers, in the distribution of your gifts. Let us
share in the brilliant wealth, the well-acquired, that belongs to you, O
strong ones.

22\. When valiant men fiercely fight together, for rivers, plants, and
houses [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:22:1), then, O Maruts, sons of Rudra, be
in battles our protectors from the enemy.

23\. O Maruts, you have valued [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:23:1) the praises
which our fathers have formerly recited to you; with the Maruts the
victor is terrible in battle, with the Maruts alone the racer wins the
prize.

24\. O Maruts, may we have a strong son, who is lord among men, a ruler,
through whom we may cross the waters to dwell in safety, and then obtain
our own home for you [1](sbe3246.htm#an_7:56:24:1).

25\. May Indra then, Varu*n*a, Mitra, Agni, the waters, the plants, the
trees of the forest be pleased with us. Let us be in the keeping, in the
lap of the Maruts; protect us always with your favours.

#### NOTES.

Ascribed to Vasish*th*a. Verse 1 occurs in SV. I, 433 verse 10 in TS.
II, 1, 11, 1; MS. IV, 11, 2; verse 12 in TB. II, 8, 5, 5; MS. IV, 14,
18; verse 13 in TB. II, 8, 5, 5; MS. IV, 14, 18; verse 14 in TS. IV, 3,
13, 6; MS. IV, 10, 5; verse 16 in TS. IV, 3, 13, 7; MS. IV, 10, 5; verse
19 in TB. II, 8, 5, 6; MS. IV, 14, 18. Metre, 1-11 Dvipadâ Virâ*g*;
12-25 Trish*t*ubh.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_7:56:1:1">1</span>. The SV. reads athâ for the older
adhâ. Sanîkâ in the edition of the Bibl. Ind. is a misprint for
sanî*l*â.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_7:56:3:1">1</span>. Sva-pû is explained by Roth as
possibly a broom, raising the dust. Grassmann translates it by light,
Ludwig by blowing. I suggest to take it for \*vapû, in the sense of beak
or claw, from vap, which follows immediately. See note to I, 88, 4. I do
not see how the other meanings assigned to svapû give any sense.
Oldenberg therefore suggests pavanta, 'Sie strömten hell auf einander zu
mit ihren svapûs.'

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_7:56:4:1">1</span>. Sâya*n*a explains etâ´ni ni*n*yâ´
by *s*vetavar*n*âni marudâtmakâni bhûtâni. He takes ûdhas as a locative.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_7:56:8:1">1</span>. Geldner translates: 'Der Spielmann
des wilden Heeres ist wie ein Muni,' and adds, 'Aber was ist ein Muni im
Veda?'

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_7:56:10:1">1</span>. I read t*ri*pán for t*ri*pát of
the Pada text, and refer vâva*s*ânâ´*h* to the Maruts. The TS. has
t*ri*pát, and the commentary explains it by t*ri*ptim. The first line is
Virâ*g*, the second Trish*t*ubh, and the Trish*t*ubh metre is afterwards
carried on.

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

##### Verse 11.

This verse refers to the Maruts, not, as Ludwig thinks, to the priests.
Dr. v. Bradke (Dyaus Asura, p. 65) proposes to join verses 10 and 11
into one Trish*t*ubh, and possibly to insert â´ before huve. I doubt
whether for the present such changes are justified. On the structure of
this hymn, see Oldenberg, Prol. 96, Anm. 3; 200, Anm. 5.

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_7:56:13:1">1</span>. TB. II, 8, 5, 6, reads
vy*ri*sh*t*ibhi*h* (not vrish*t*ibhi*h*), and the commentator explains,
vyrish*t*ibhir âyudhavi*s*eshair vyrish*t*yâkhyair, vi*s*eshe*n*a
ro*k*amânâ*h* sthitâ*h*. And again, *ri*sh*t*aya eva vi*s*ish*t*atvâd
vy*ri*sh*t*aya ity u*k*yante. Bollensen, Z. D. M. G. XLI, 501,
conjectures *ri*sh*t*ibhi*h* for vrish*t*ibhi*h*, which is very
ingenious. See also note 1 to II, 34, 2.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_7:56:14:1">1</span>. Budhnyã, explained by budhne
bhavâni, and also by kâlaprav*ri*ttâni.

Note <span id="an_7:56:14:2">2</span>. G*ri*hamedhîya may refer to the
Maruts as g*ri*hamedhâs or g*ri*hamedhinas; see RV. VII, 59, 10; VS.
XXIV, 16. The g*ri*hamedhîyâ ish*t*i in *S*at. Br. XI, 5, 2, 4, is meant
for the Maruts.

##### Verse 16.

Note <span id="an_7:56:16:1">1</span>. Yakshad*rís*a*h* is explained as
wishing to see a sacrifice or feast. Ludwig retains this meaning.
Grassmann translates, 'wie feurige Blitze funkeln.' Yaksha may mean a
shooting star or any meteor, literally what shoots or hastens along; see
VII, 61, 5. ná yâ´su *k*itrám dád*ris*e ná yakshám; also note to V, 55,
1. But d*ris* is not sad*ris*. If we follow the later Sanskrit, yaksha
would mean a class of spirits, followers of Kuvera, also ghosts in
general. If this is not too modern a conception for the Rig-veda, we
might translate yakshad*ris*, 'appearing as ghosts' (see Kau*s*. Sûtra
95 in BR.), or, considering the expression átya*h* ná ya*m*sat
yakshabh*rí*t ví*k*etâ*h*, I, 190, 4, take it for a name of horses.

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

##### Verse 19.

Note <span id="an_7:56:19:1">1</span>. Does not sáhasa â´ stand for
sáhasâ â´, and not for sáhasa*h* â´? Comp. Oldenberg, Prolegomena, 465
seq.

Note <span id="an_7:56:19:2">2</span>. On dadhanti, see Hübschmann,
Indogerm. Vocal-system, p. 12.

##### Verse 20.

Note <span id="an_7:56:20:1">1</span>. On radhra, see Pischel, Ved.
Stud. pp. 124 seq.

Note <span id="an_7:56:20:2">2</span>. Bh*ri*mi is doubtful, but as it
stands by the side of radhra, it seems to have a bad meaning, such as a
vagrant, unsteady.

Note <span id="an_7:56:20:3">3</span>. The Vasus are often mentioned
with the Âdityas and Rudras, see III, 8, 8; X, 66, 12; 128, 9. By
themselves they became almost synonymous with the Devas. Thus in VII,
ii, 4, we read that Agni became the master of all sacrifices, krátum hí
asya Vásava*h* *g*ushánta átha devâ´*h* dadhire havyavâ´ham, 'for the
Vasus liked his wisdom, therefore the Devas made him the carrier of
offerings.' See also V, 3, 10. pitâ´ Vaso yádi tát *g*osháyâse. In one
passage, VI, 50, 4, Vasava*h* means the Maruts. In our passage it seems
better to take it in the sense of gods, but we might also refer it to
the Maruts.

##### Verse 22.

Note <span id="an_7:56:22:1">1</span>. With pâda b, compare VII, 70, 3
b.

##### Verse 23.

Note <span id="an_7:56:23:1">1</span>. I have taken bhû´ri *k*akra in
the sense of magni facere, though I can find no analogous passages.

##### Verse 24.

Note <span id="an_7:56:24:1">1</span>. This verse has been well
explained by Dr. v. Bradke, Dyaus Asura, p. 66. Svám óka*h*, our own
home, occurs IV, 50, 8; V, 33, 4; VI, 41, 1; VIII, 72, 14. Abhyas means
generally to obtain what is not our own. See also VII, 48, 2. Va*h*,
which I have translated 'for you,' may also mean 'from you.'

##### Verse 25.

This verse is marked as a galita taken from VII, 34, 25, while the last
pâda is a galita taken from VII, I, 25.
