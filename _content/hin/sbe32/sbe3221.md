### MA*ND*ALA I, HYMN 64.

#### ASH*T*AKA I, ADHYÂYA 5, VARGA 6-8.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. For the manly host, the joyful, the wise, for the Maruts bring thou,
O Nodhas [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:1:1), a pure offering
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:1:2). I prepare songs, like as a handy priest
[3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:1:3), wise in his mind, prepares the water,
mighty at sacrifices.

2\. They are born, the tall bulls of Dyu [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:2:1)
(heaven), the manly youths [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:2:2) of Rudra, the
divine, the blameless, pure, and bright like suns; scattering raindrops,
full of terrible designs, like giants [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:2:3).

3\. The youthful Rudras, they who never grow old, the slayers of the
demon [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:3:1), have grown irresistible like
mountains. They throw down with their strength all beings, even the
strongest, on earth and in heaven.

4\. They deck themselves with glittering ornaments
[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:1) for a marvellous show; on their chests they
fastened gold (chains) for beauty [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:2); the
spears on their shoulders pound to pieces [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:3);
they were born together by themselves [4](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:4:4), the
men of Dyu.

5\. They who confer power [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:5:1), the roarers
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:5:2), the devourers of foes, they made winds and
lightnings by their powers. The shakers milk the heavenly udders
(clouds), they sprinkle the earth all round with milk (rain).

6\. The bounteous [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:1) Maruts pour forth
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:2) water, mighty at sacrifices, the fat milk
(of the clouds). They seem to lead [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:3) about
the powerful horse, the cloud, to make it rain; they milk the
thundering, unceasing spring [4](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:6:4)

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

7\. Mighty they are, powerful, of beautiful splendour, strong in
themselves [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:7:1) like mountains, (yet) swiftly
gliding along;—you chew up forests, like wild elephants
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:7:2), when you have assumed your powers among
the red flames [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:7:3).

8\. Like lions they roar, the wise Maruts, they are handsome like
gazelles [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:8:1), the all-knowing. By night
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:8:2) with their spotted deer (rain-clouds) and
with their spears (lightnings) they rouse the companions together, they
whose ire through strength is like the ire of serpents.

9\. You who march in companies, the friends of man, heroes, whose ire
through strength is like the ire of serpents
[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:9:1), salute heaven and earth
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:9:2)! On the seats on your chariots, O Maruts,
the lightning stands, visible like light [3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:9:3).

10\. All-knowing, surrounded with wealth, endowed with powers, singers
[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:10:1), men of endless prowess armed with strong
rings [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:10:2), they, the archers, have taken the
arrow in their fists.

11\. The Maruts who with the golden tires of their wheels increase the
rain, stir up the clouds like wanderers on the road. They are brisk,
indefatigable [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:11:1), they move by themselves;
they throw down what is firm, the Maruts with their brilliant spears
make (everything) to reel [2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:11:2).

12\. We invoke with prayer [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:1) the offspring
of Rudra, the brisk, the pure, the worshipful
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:2), the active. Cling
[3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:3) for happiness-sake to the strong company
of the Maruts, the chasers of the sky [4](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:4), the
powerful, the impetuous [5](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:12:5).

13\. The mortal whom ye, Maruts, protected, he indeed surpasses people
in strength through your protection. He carries off booty with his
horses,

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

treasures with his men; he acquires honourable
[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:13:1) wisdom, and he prospers
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:13:2).

14\. Give, O Maruts, to our lords strength glorious, invincible in
battle, brilliant, wealth-acquiring, praiseworthy, known to all men
[1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:14:1). Let us foster our kith and kin during a
hundred winters.

15\. Will [1](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:15:1) you then, O Maruts, grant unto
us wealth, durable, rich in men, defying all onslaughts
[2](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:15:2)?—wealth a hundred and a thousand-fold,
always increasing?—May he who is rich in prayers
[3](sbe3221.htm#an_1:64:15:3) (the host of the Maruts) come early and
soon!

#### NOTES.

This hymn is ascribed to Nodhas, of the family of Gotama. No verse of
this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV.; but verse 6 = TS. III, 1, 11, 7.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_1:64:1:1">1</span>. The first line is addressed by the
poet to himself.

Note <span id="an_1:64:1:2">2</span>. Suv*ri*ktí is generally explained
by a hymn of praise, and it cannot be denied that in this place, as in
most others, that meaning would be quite satisfactory. Etymologically,
however, suv*ri*ktí means the cleaning and trimming of the grass on
which, as on a small altar, the oblation is offered: cf. v*ri*ktabarhis,
I, 38, 1, note 2, page [84](sbe3219.htm#page_84). Hence, although the
same word might be metaphorically applied to a carefully trimmed, pure,
and holy hymn of praise, yet wherever in the Veda the primary meaning is
applicable, it seems safer to retain it: cf. III, 61, 5; VI, 11, 5.

Prof. Roth, in the Mélanges Asiatiques, vii, p. 612, calls the
derivation, which he himself discovered, a 'Columbus-Egg.' He derives
suv*ri*kti from su + *ri*kti, and translates it by excellent praise. He
supports the insertion of v, by the analogy of su-v-ita, for su-ita.
This derivation is certainly very ingenious, but there are some
difficulties which have still to be accounted for. That the substantive
*ri*kti does not occur by itself would not be fatal, because other words
in the Veda occur as uttarapadas only. But there is the compound
námov*ri*kti in X, 131, 2, which shows that v*ri*kti existed as a
substantive, though it is true that the Vâ*g*asaneyins (X, 32) read
namaukti instead. Taitt. S. I, 8, 21; Taitt. Br. II, 6, 1, 3; and Ath.
V. XX, 125, 2, have all namov*ri*kti. There is also the compound
sváv*ri*kti in RV. X, 21, 1. Are these to be separated from su-v*ri*kti,
and ought we not to take into consideration also the Zend hvarsta, as
pointed out by M. Darmesteter (Ormazd,

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

p\. 10, note), meaning well performed, perfect in a liturgical sense?

Note <span id="an_1:64:1:3">3</span>. Apás, with the accent on the last
syllable, is the accusative plural of ap, water, and it is so explained
by Sâya*n*a. He translates: 'I show forth these hymns of praise, like
water, i. e. everywhere, as Par*g*anya sends down rain at once in every
place.' Benfey explains: 'I make these hymns smooth like water, i. e. so
that they run smooth like water.' He compares ῥυθμός, as derived from
ῥέω. Ludwig translates: Als ein kunstfertiger das werk im geiste, auch
geschickt mit der hand mach ich schön die in der opferversammlungen
mächtig wirkenden lieder.' I thought formerly that we ought either to
change the accent, and read ápa*h*, or the last vowel, and read apâ´*h*.
In the former case the meaning would be, 'As one wise in mind and clever
performs his work, so do I compose these hymns.' In the second case we
should translate: 'Like a workman, wise in mind and handy, I put
together these hymns.'

Still there is one point which has hitherto been overlooked by all
translators, namely, that apá*h* vidátheshu âbhúva*h*, occurring in the
first and sixth verses, ought to be taken in the same sense in both
passages. Now apá*h* vidátheshu âbhúva*h* seems to mean water
efficacious at sacrifices. In the sixth verse I now translate: 'The
bounteous Maruts pour down water, mighty or efficacious at sacrifices,
the fat milk (of the clouds).' Hence in the first verse I should now
like to translate: 'I prepare my songs, like as a handy priest, wise in
his mind, prepares the water mighty or efficacious at sacrifices.' Roth
assigns to vidátha a too exclusively political meaning. Vidátha may be
an assembly, a public meeting, a witenagemot, or an ἐκκλησία, but public
meetings at that time had always a religious character, so that vidátha
must often be translated by sacrifice.

##### Verse 2.

Note <span id="an_1:64:2:1">1</span>. It is difficult to say in passages
like this, whether Dyu should be taken as heaven or as a personified
deity. When the Maruts are called Rudrásya máryâ*h*, the boys of

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rudra (VII, 56,
1), the personification is always preserved. Hence if the same beings
are called Divá*h* máryâ*h*, this too, I think, should be translated the
boys of Dyu (III, 54, 13; V, 59, 6), not the sons of heaven. The bulls
of Dyu is a more primitive and more vigorous expression for what we
should call the fertilising winds of heaven.

Note <span id="an_1:64:2:2">2</span>. Márya is a male, particularly a
young male, a young man, a bridegroom (I, 115, 2; III, 33, 10; IV, 20,
5; V, 61, 4, with vîra).

The Maruts have grown strong like well-grown manly youths. See also V,
59, 3.

V, 59, 5. máryâ*h*-iva su-v*rí*dha*h* vav*ri*dhu*h* nára*h*.

The men have grown strong like well-grown stallions.

In some passages it has simply the meaning of man:

I, 91, 13. márya*h*-iva své okyẽ.

Like a man in his own house.

Note <span id="an_1:64:2:3">3</span>. The simile, like giants, is not
quite clear. Sátvan means a strong man, but it seems intended here to
convey the idea of supernatural strength. Benfey translates, 'like brave
warriors;' Wilson, 'like evil spirits.' Ghorávarpas is an adjective
belonging to the Maruts rather than to the giants, and may mean of awful
aspect, I, 19, 5, or of cruel mind; cf. I, 39, 1, note 2.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_1:64:3:1">1</span>. Abhog-ghána*h*, the slayers of the
demon, are the slayers of the clouds, viz. of such clouds as do not
yield rain. Abho*g*, not nurturing, seems to be a name of the rainless
cloud, like Námu*k*i (na-mu*k*, not delivering rain), the name of
another demon, killed by Indra; see Benfey, Glossar, s. v. The cloud
which sends rain is called bhu*g*mán:

VIII, 50, 2. girí*h* ná bhu*g*mâ´ maghávat-su pinvate.

Like a feeding cloud he showers his gifts on the worshippers.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_1:64:4:1">1</span>. The ornaments of the Maruts are
best described V, 54, 11:

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

ámseshu va*h* *ri*sh*t*áya*h* pat-sú khâdáya*h* váksha*h*-su rukmâ´*h*.

On your shoulders are the spears, on your feet rings, on your chests
gold ornaments. See also I, 166, 10, &c.

Rukmá as a masc. plur. is frequently used for ornaments which are worn
on the breast by the Maruts. The Maruts are actually called
rukmávakshasa*h*, gold-breasted (II, 34, 2; V, 55, 1; 57, 5). In the
Â*s*val. *S*rauta-sûtra IX, 4, rukma is mentioned as an ornament to be
given to the Hot*ri* priest; it is said to be round.

Note <span id="an_1:64:4:2">2</span>. Vápushe and *s*ubhé, as parallel
expressions, occur also VI, 63, 6. Cf. Delbrück, K. Z. xviii, 96.

Note <span id="an_1:64:4:3">3</span>. Ní mim*ri*kshur does not occur
again in the Rig-veda, and Roth has suggested to read ní mimikshur
instead; see ni + marg. He does not, however, give our passage under
mya*k*, but under mraksh, and this seems indeed preferable. No doubt,
there is ample analogy for mimikshu*h*, and the meaning would be, their
spears stick firm to their shoulders. But as the MSS. give
mim*ri*kshu*h*, and as it is possible to find a meaning for this, I do
not propose to alter the text. The question is only, what does
mim*ri*kshu*h* mean? Mraksh means to grind, to rub, and Roth proposes to
render our passage by 'the spears rub together on our shoulders.' The
objections to this translation are the preposition ni, and the active
voice of the verb. I take mraksh in the sense of grinding, pounding,
destroying, which is likewise appropriate to mraksha-k*rí*tvan (VIII,
61, 10), and tuvi-mrakshá (VI, 18, 2), and I translate, 'the spears on
their shoulders pound to pieces.'

Note <span id="an_1:64:4:4">4</span>. The idea that the Maruts owe
everything, if not their birth, at least their strength (svá-tavasa*h*,
svá-bhânava*h*, sva-s*rí*ta*h*), to themselves is of frequent occurrence
in these hymns. See verse 7, note I.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_1:64:5:1">1</span>. They are themselves compared to
kings (I, 85, 8), and called î*s*âná, lords (I, 87, 4).

Note <span id="an_1:64:5:2">2</span>. Dhúni is connected with root
dhvan, to dun or

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

to din. Sâya*n*a explains it by bending or shaking, and Benfey, too,
translates it by Erschütterer. Roth gives the right meaning.

##### Verse 6.

Note <span id="an_1:64:6:1">1</span>. I translate sudâ´nava*h* by
bounteous, or good givers, for, if we have to choose between the two
meanings of bounteous or endowed with liquid drops or dew, the former is
the more appropriate in most passages. We might, of course, admit two
words, one meaning, possessed of good water, the other, bounteous; the
former derived from dâ´nu, neuter, water, or rain, the other from dânú,
giving. It cannot be denied, for instance, that whenever the Maruts are
called sudâ´nava*h*, the meaning, possessed of good rain, would be
applicable: I, 40, 1; 44, 14; 64, 6; 85, 10; II, 34, 8; III, 26, 5; V,
52, 5; 53, 6; 57, 5; VIII, 20, 18; X, 78, 5; I, 15, 2; 23, 9; 39, 10.
Yet, even in these passages, while sudâ´nava*h* in the sense of
possessed of good rain is possible throughout, that of good giver would
sometimes be preferable, for instance, I, 15, 2, as compared with I, 15,
3. Though sudâ´nu, in the sense of possessed of good water, sounds as
strange as would suv*ri*sh*t*i in the sense of possessed of good rain,
or sumegha, possessed of good clouds, yet it is difficult to separate
sudâ´nava*h* and gîrádânava*h*, both epithets of the Maruts.

When the same word is applied to Indra, VII, 31, 2; X, 23, 6; to
Vish*n*u, VIII, 25, 12; to the A*s*vins, I, 112, 11; to Mitra and
Varu*n*a, V, 62, 9; to Indra and Varu*n*a, IV. 41, 8, the meaning of
giver of good rain might still seem natural. But with Agni, VI, 2, 4;
the Âdityas, V, 67, 4; VIII, 18, 12; 19, 34; 67, 16; the Vasus, I, 106,
1; X, 66, 12; the Vi*s*ve, X, 65, 11, such an epithet would not be
appropriate, while sudâ´nava*h*, in the sense of bounteous givers, is
applicable to all. The objection that dânu, giver, does not occur in the
Veda, is of no force, for many words occur at the end of compounds only,
and we shall see passages where sudâ´nu must be translated by good
giver. Nor would the accent of dânú, giver, be an obstacle, considering
that the author of the U*n*âdi-sûtras had no Vedic

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

authority to guide him in the determination of the accent of dânú.
Several words in nu have the accent on the first syllable. But one might
go even a step further, and find a more appropriate meaning for sudâ´nu
by identifying it with the Zend hudânu, which means, not a good giver,
but a good knower, wise. True, this root dâ, to know, does not occur in
the ordinary Sanskrit; and Hübschmann (Ein Zoroastrisches Lied, 1872, p.
48) tries to prove that the root dâ, to know, does not exist in Zend
either. But even thus we might have the derivation in Sanskrit and Zend,
while the root was kept alive in Greek only (δάημι, δάεις). This,
however, is only a conjecture; what is certain is this, that apart from
the passages where sudâ´nu is thus applied to various deities, in the
sense of bounteous or wise, it also occurs as applied to the sacrificer,
where it can only mean giver. This is clear from the following passages:

I, 47, 8. su-k*rí*te su-dâ´nave.

To him who acts well and gives well.

VII, 96, 4. *g*ani-yánta*h* nú ágrava*h* putri-yánta*h* su-dâ´nava*h*,
sárasvantam havâmahe.

We, being unmarried, and wishing for wives and wishing for sons,
offering sacrifices, call now upon Sarasvat.

VIII, 103, 7. su-dâ´nava*h* deva-yáva*h*.

Offering sacrifices, and longing for the gods. Cf. X, 172, 2; 3; VI, 16,
8.

IV, 4, 7. sá*h* ít agne astu su-bhága*h* su-dâ´nu*h* yá*h* tvâ nítyena
havíshâ yá*h* ukthaí*h* píprîshati.

O Agni, let the liberal sacrificer be happy, who wishes to please thee
by perpetual offerings and hymns. See also VI, 16, 8; 68, 5; X, 172, 2,
3.

It must be confessed that even the meaning of dâ´nu is by no means quite
clear. It is clear enough where it means demon, II, 11, 18; 12, 11; IV,
30, 7; X, 120, 6, the seven demons. In I, 32, 9; III, 30, 8, dâ´nu,
demon, is applied to the mother of V*ri*tra, the dark cloud. From this
dâ´nu we have the derivative dânavá, meaning again demon. Why the
demons, conquered by Indra, were called dâ´nu, is not clear, unless they
were conceived originally as dark clouds, like Dânu, the mother of
Indra. Dânu might mean wise,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

or even powerful, for this meaning also is ascribed to dânú by the
author of the U*n*âdi-sûtras. If the latter meaning is authentic, and
not only deduced ex post from the name of Dânu and Dânava, it might
throw light on the Celtic dána, fortis, from which Zeuss derives the
name of the Danube.

Sometimes dâ´nu, as a neuter, is explained as Soma:

X, 43, 7. â´pa*h* ná síndhum abhí yát sam-áksharan sómâsa*h* índram
kulyâ´*h*-iva hradám, várdhanti víprâ*h* máha*h* asya sádane yávam ná
v*ri*sh*t*í*h* divyéna dâ´nunâ.

When the Somas run together to Indra, like water to the river, like
channels to the lake, then the priests increase his greatness in the
sanctuary, as rain the corn, by the heavenly Soma-juice, or by heavenly
moisture.

In the next verse *g*îrádânu is explained as the sacrificer whose Soma
is always alive, always ready.

In VI, 50, 13, however, dâ´nu pápri*h* is doubtful. As an epithet to
Apâ´m nápât, it may mean he who wishes for Soma, or he who grants Soma;
but in neither case is there any tangible sense, unless Soma is taken as
a name of the fertilising rain or dew. Again, VIII, 25, 5, Mitra and
Varu*n*a are called s*ri*prá-dânû, which may mean possessed of flowing
rain. And in the next verse, sám yâ´ dâ´nûni yemáthu*h* may be rendered
by Mitra and Varu*n*a, who brought together rain.

The fact that Mitra-Varu*n*au and the A*s*vins are called dâ´nunaspátî
does not throw much more light on the subject, and the one passage where
dâ´nu occurs as a feminine, I, 54, 7, dâ´nu*h* asmai úparâ pinvate
divá*h*, may be translated by rain pours forth for him, below the sky,
but the translation is by no means certain.

Dâ´nu*k*itra, applied to the dawn, the water of the clouds, and the
three worlds (V, 59, 8; 31, 6; I, 174, 7), means most likely bright with
dew or rain; and dâ´numat vásu, the treasure conquered by Indra from the
clouds, can be translated by the treasure of rain. Taking all the
evidence together, we can hardly doubt that dâ´nu existed in the sense
of liquid, rain, dew, and also Soma; yet it is equally certain that
dâ´nu existed in the sense of giver, if not of gift, and that from this,
in certain passages, at all events,

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

sudâ´nu must be derived, as a synonym of sudâ´van, sudâ´man, &c.

Spiegel admits two words dânu in the Veda and Avesta, the one meaning
enemy, the other river. Darmesteter (Ormazd, p. 220) takes dânu as a
cloud, water, or river. Ludwig translates sudânu by possessed of
excellent gifts.

Note <span id="an_1:64:6:2">2</span>. I thought formerly that pinvanti
was here construed with two accusatives, in the sense of 'they fill the
water (with) fat milk.'

Cf. VI, 63, 8. dhenúm na*h* ísham pinvatam ásakrâm.

You filled our cow (with) constant food.

Similarly duh, to milk, to extract, is construed with two accusatives:
Pan. I, 4, 51. gam dogdhi paya*h*, he milks the cow milk.

RV. IX, 107, 5. duhâná*h* û´dha*h* divyám mádhu priyám.

Milking the heavenly udder (and extracting from it) the precious sweet,
i. e. the rain.

But I now prefer to translate pinvanti apá*h* by they pour out water,
and I take páya*h* gh*ri*távat as a description of the water, namely,
the fat milk of the clouds. After that parenthesis, vidátheshu âbhúva*h*
is again an epithet of apá*h*, as it was in the first verse.

Note <span id="an_1:64:6:3">3</span>. The leading about of the clouds is
intended, like the leading about of horses, to tame them, and make them
obedient to the wishes of their riders, the Maruts. Átya*h* vâ*g*î´ is a
strong horse, possibly a stallion; but this horse is here meant to
signify the clouds. Thus we read:

V, 83, 6. divá*h* na*h* v*ri*sh*t*ím maruta*h* rarîdhvam prá pinvata
v*rí*sh*n*a*h* á*s*vasya dhâ´râ*h*.

Give us, O Maruts, the rain of heaven, pour forth the streams of the
stallion (the cloud).

In the original the simile is quite clear, and no one required to be
told that the átya*h* vâ*g*î´ was meant for the cloud. Vâ*g*ín by itself
means a horse, as I, 66, 2; 69, 3. vâ*g*î´ ná prîtá*h*, like a favourite
horse; I, 116, 6. paidvá*h* vâ*g*î´, the horse of Pedu. But being
derived from vâ´*g*a, strength, vâ*g*ín retained always something of its
etymological meaning, and was therefore easily and naturally transferred
to the cloud, the giver of strength, the source

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

of food. Even without the ná, i. e. as if, the simile would have been
understood in Sanskrit, while in English it is hardly intelligible
without a commentary. Benfey discovers some additional idea in support
of the poet's comparison: 'Ich bin kein Pferdekenner,' he says, 'aber
ich glaube bemerkt zu haben, dass man Pferde, welche rasch gelaufen
sind, zum Uriniren zu bewegen sucht. So lassen hier die Maruts die durch
ihren Sturm rasch fortgetriebenen Wolken Wasser herab strömen.'

Note <span id="an_1:64:6:4">4</span>. Útsa, well, is meant again for
cloud, though we should hardly be justified in classing it as a name of
cloud, because the original meaning of útsa, spring, is really retained,
as much as that of avatá, well, in I, 85, 10-11. The adjectives
stanáyantam and ákshitam seem more applicable to cloud, yet they may be
applied also to a spring. Yâska derives utsa from ut-sar, to go forth;
ut-sad, to go out; ut-syand, to well out; or from ud, to wet. In V, 32,
2, the wells shut up by the seasons are identified with the udder of the
cloud.

##### Verse 7.

Note <span id="an_1:64:7:1">1</span>. Svátavas means really having their
own independent strength, a strength not derived from the support of
others. The yet which I have added in brackets seems to have been in the
poet's mind, though it is not expressed. In I, 87, 4, the Maruts are
called sva-s*rí*t, going by themselves, i. e. moving freely,
independently, wherever they list. See I, 64, 4, note 4.

Note <span id="an_1:64:7:2">2</span>. M*ri*gâ´*h* hastína*h*, wild
animals with a hand or a trunk, must be meant for elephants, although it
has been doubted whether the poets of the Veda were acquainted with that
animal. Hastín is the received name for elephant in the later Sanskrit,
and it is hardly applicable to any other animal. If they are said to eat
the forests, this may be understood in the sense of crushing or chewing,
as well as of eating.

Note <span id="an_1:64:7:3">3</span>. The chief difficulty of the last
sentence has been pointed out in B. and R.'s Dictionary, s. v. â´ru*n*î.
Âru*n*î does not occur again in the whole of the Rig-veda. If we take it
with Sâya*n*a as a various reading of aru*n*î´, then. the

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aru*n*î´s could
only be the ruddy cows of the dawn or of. Indra, with whom the Maruts,
in this passage, can have no concern. Nor would it be intelligible why
they should be called â´ru*n*î in this one place only. If, as suggested
by B. and R., the original text had been yadâ´ aru*ñ*î´shu, it would be
difficult to understand how so simple a reading could have been
corrupted.

Another difficulty is the verb áyugdhvam, which is not found again in
the Rig-veda together with távishî. Távishî, vigour, is construed with
dhâ, to take strength, V, 32, 2. adhatthâ*h*; V, 55, 2. dadhidhve; X,
102, 8. adhatta; also with vas, IV, 16, 14; with pat, X, 113, 5, &c. But
it is not likely that to put vigour into the cows could be expressed in
Sanskrit by 'you join vigour in the cows.' If távishî must be taken in
the sense which it seems always to possess, viz. vigour, it would be
least objectionable to translate, 'when you joined vigour, i. e. when
you assumed vigour, while being among the Âru*n*îs.' The Âru*n*îs being
the cows of the dawn, â´ru*n*îshu might simply mean in the morning.
Considering, however, that the Maruts are said to eat up forests,
â´ru*n*î in this place, is best taken in the sense of red flames, viz.
of fire or forest-fire (dâvâgni), so that the sense would be, 'When you,
Storms, assume vigour among the flames, you eat up forests, like
elephants.' Benfey: 'Wenn mit den rothen eure Kraft ihr angeschirrt. Die
rothen sind die Antilopen, das Vehikel der Maruts, wegen der
Schnelligkeit derselben.'

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_1:64:8:1">1</span>. As pisá does not occur again in
the Rig-veda, and as Sâya*n*a, without attempting any etymological
arguments, simply gives it as a name of deer, it seems best to adopt
that sense till something better can be discovered. Supí*s*, too, does
not occur again. In VII, 18, 2, pí*s* is explained by gold, &c.; VII,
57, 3, the Maruts are called vi*s*vapí*s*.

Note <span id="an_1:64:8:2">2</span>. Kshápa*h* can only be the
accusative plural, used in a temporal sense. It is so used in the
expression kshápa*h* usrá*h* *k*a, by night and by day, lit. nights and
days (VII, 15, 8). In VI, 52, 15, we find kshápa*h* usrâ´*h* in the same
sense.

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> IV, 53, 7.
kshapâ´bhi*h* áha-bhi*h*, by night and by day. I, 44, 8, the loc. plur.
vyúsh*t*ishu, in the mornings, is followed by kshápa*h*, the acc. plur.,
by night, and here the genitive kshapá*h* would certainly be preferable,
in the sense of at the brightening up of the night. The acc. plur.
occurs again in I, 116, 4, where tisrá*h* is used as an accusative (II,
2, 2; VIII, 41, 3). Kshapá*h*, with the accent on the last, must be
taken as a genitivus temporalis, like the German Nachts (I, 79, 6). In
VIII, 19, 31. kshapá*h* vástushu means at the brightening up of the
night, i. e. in the morning. Thus, in III, 50, 4, Indra is called
kshapâ´m vastâ´ *g*anitâ´ sû´ryasya, the lighter up of nights, the
parent of the sun. In VIII, 26, 3, áti kshapá*h*, the genitive may be
governed by áti. In IV, 16, 19, however, the accusative kshápa*h* would
be more natural, nor do I see how a genitive could here be accounted
for:

dyâ´va*h* ná dyumnaí*h* abhí sánta*h* aryá*h* kshapá*h* madema saráda*h*
ka pûrvî´*h*.

May we rejoice many years, overcoming our enemies as the days overcome
the nights by splendour.

The same applies to I, 70, 4, where kshapá*h* occurs with the accent on
the last syllable, whereas we expect kshápa*h* as nom. or acc. plural.
Here B. and R. in the Sanskrit Dictionary, s. v. kshap, rightly, I
believe, suppose it to be a nom. plur. in spite of the accent.

##### Verse 9.

Note <span id="an_1:64:9:1">1</span>. Áhimanyu comes very near to
Angra-mainyu; cf. Darmesteter, Ormazd, p. 94.

Note <span id="an_1:64:9:2">2</span>. Ródasî, a dual, though frequently
followed by ubhé (I, 10, 8; 33, 9; 54, 2), means heaven and earth,
excluding the antáriksha or the air between the two. Hence, if this is
to be included, it has to be added: I, 73, 8. âpapri-vâ´n ródasî
antáriksham. Cf. V, 85, 3. We must scan r̆ōdăsî̄. See Kuhn, Beiträge, vol.
iv, p. 193. Should rodasî stand for rodasîm, as elsewhere? She is
certainly intended by what follows in the next line.

Note <span id="an_1:64:9:3">3</span>. The comparison is not quite
distinct. Amati means originally impetus, then power, e. g. V, 69, 1:

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

vav*ri*dhânâ´u amátim kshatríyasya.

Increasing the might of the warrior.

But it is most frequently used of the effulgence of the sun, (III, 38,
8; V, 45, 2; 62, 5; VII, 38, 1; 2; 45, 3.) See also V, 56, 8, where the
same companion of the Maruts is called Rodasî´. The comparative particle
ná is used twice.

##### Verse 10.

Note <span id="an_1:64:10:1">1</span>. See I, 38, 14, p. 95.

Note <span id="an_1:64:10:2">2</span>. In v*rí*sha-khâdi the meaning of
khâdi is by no means clear. Sâya*n*a evidently guesses, and proposes two
meanings, weapon or food. In several passages where khâdi occurs, it
seems to be an ornament rather than a weapon, yet if derived from khad,
to bite, it may originally have signified some kind of weapon. Roth
translates it by ring, and it is certain that these khâdis were to be
seen not only on the arms and shoulders, but likewise on the feet of the
Maruts. There is a famous weapon in India, the kakra or quoit, a ring
with sharp edges, which is thrown from a great distance with fatal
effect. Bollensen (Orient and Occident, vol. ii, p. 46) suggests for
v*rí*shan the meaning of hole in the ear, and then translates the
compound as having earrings in the hole of the ear. But v*rí*shan does
not mean the hole in the lap of the ear, nor has v*ri*shabhá that
meaning either in the Veda or elsewhere. Wilson gives for v*ri*shabha,
not for v*ri*shan, the meaning of orifice of the ear, but this is very
different from the hole in the lap of the ear. Benfey suggests that the
khâdis were made of the teeth of wild animals, and hence their name of
biters. V*rí*shan conveys the meaning of strong, though possibly with
the implied idea of rain-producing, fertilising. See p. 138. In RV. V,
87, 1, Osthoff translates sukhâdáye by jucunde praebenti, Benfey by
schönverzehrendem; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, IV, 70, has the right
rendering. Cf. note to I, 166, 9.

##### Verse 11.

Note <span id="an_1:64:11:1">1</span>. Formerly explained as 'zum Kampfe
wandelnd.' See Kuhn, Zeitschrift, vol. iv, p. 19.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Note <span id="an_1:64:11:2">2</span>. <span
class="smallcaps">Wilson</span>: Augmenters of rain, they drive, with
golden wheels, the clouds asunder; as elephants (in a herd, break down
the trees in their way). They are honoured with sacrifices, visitants of
the hall of offering, spontaneous assailers (of their foes), subverters
of what are stable, immovable themselves, and wearers of shining
weapons.

<span class="smallcaps">Benfey</span>: Weghemmnissen gleich schleudern
die Fluthmehrer mit den goldnen Felgen das Gewölk empor, die nie müden
Kämpfer, frei schreitend-festesstürzenden, die schweres thu’nden,
lanzenstrahlenden Maruts.

##### Verse 12.

Note <span id="an_1:64:12:1">1</span>. Havásâ, instead of what one
should expect, hávasâ, occurs but once more in another Marut hymn, VI,
66, ii.

Note <span id="an_1:64:12:2">2</span>. Vanín does not occur again as an
epithet of the Maruts. It is explained by Sâya*n*a as a possessive
adjective derived from vana, water, and Benfey accordingly translates it
by fluthversehn. This, however, is not confirmed by any authoritative
passages. Vanín, unless it means connected with the forest, a tree, in
which sense it occurs frequently, is only applied to the worshippers or
priests in the sense of venerating or adoring (cf. venero, venustus,
&c.)

III, 40, 7. abhí dyumnâ´ni vanína*h* índram sa*k*ante ákshitâ.

The inexhaustible treasures of the worshipper go towards Indra.

VIII, 3, 5. índram vanína*h* havâmahe.

We, the worshippers, call Indra.

Unless it can be proved by independent evidence that vanín means
possessed of water, we must restrict vanín to its two meanings, of which
the only one here applicable, though weak, is adoring. The Maruts are
frequently represented as singers and priests, yet the epithets here
applied to them stand much in need of some definite explanation, as the
poet could hardly have meant to string a number of vague and
ill-connected epithets together. If one might conjecture, svânínam
instead of vanínam would be an improvement. It is a scarce word, and
occurs but once more

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

in the Veda, III, 26, 5, where it is used of the Maruts, in the sense of
noisy, turbulent.

Note <span id="an_1:64:12:3">3</span>. Sa*sk*ata, which I have here
translated literally by to cling, is often used in the sense of
following or revering (colere):

II, I, 13. tvâ´m râti-sâ´*k*a*h* adhvaréshu sa*sk*ire.

The gods who are fond of offerings cling to thee, follow thee, at the
sacrifices.

The Soma libation is said to reach the god:

II, 22, I. sá*h* enam sa*sk*at devá*h* devám. The gods too are said to
cling to their worshippers, i. e. to love and protect them: III, 16, 2;
VII, i8, 25. The horses are said to follow their drivers: VI, 36, 3;
VII, 90, 3, &c. It is used very much like the Greek ὀπάζω.

Note <span id="an_1:64:12:4">4</span>. Ra*g*astû´*h* may mean rousing
the dust of the earth, a very appropriate epithet of the Maruts.
Sâya*n*a explains it thus, and most translators have adopted his
explanation. But as the epithets here are not simply descriptive, but
laudatory, it seems preferable, in this place, to retain the usual
meaning of rá*g*as, sky. When Soma is called ra*g*astû´*h*, IX, 108, 7,
Sâya*n*a too explains it by te*g*asâm prerakam, and IX, 48, 4, by
udakasya prerakam.

Note <span id="an_1:64:12:5">5</span>. *Rig*îshín, derived from
*rig*îsha. *Rig*îsha is what remains of the Soma-plant after it has once
been squeezed, and what is used again for the third libation. Now as the
Maruts are invoked at the third libation, they were called *rig*îshín,
as drinking at their later libation the juice made of the *rig*îsha.
This, at least, is the opinion of the Indian commentators. But it is
much more likely that the Maruts were invoked at the third libation,
because originally they had been called *rig*îshín by the Vedic poets,
this *rig*îshín being derived from *rig*îsha, and *rig*îsha from *rig*,
to strive, to yearn, like purîsha from p*rî*, manîshâ from man; (see
U*n*âdi-sûtras, p. 273.) This *rig* is the same root which we have in
ὀρέγειν, to reach, ὀργή, emotion, and ὄργια, furious transports of
worshippers. Thus the Maruts from being called *rig*îshín, impetuous,
came to be taken for drinkers of *rig*îsha, the fermenting and
overflowing Soma, and were assigned accordingly to the third libation at
sacrifices.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Rig*îshín, as an
epithet, is not confined to the Maruts; it is given to Indra, with whom
it could not have had a purely ceremonial meaning (VIII, 76, 5).

##### Verse 13.

Note <span id="an_1:64:13:1">1</span>. Âp*ríkkh*ya, literally, to be
asked for, to be inquired for, to be greeted and honoured. A word of an
apparently modern character, but occurring again in the Rig-veda as
applied to a prince, and to the vessel containing the Soma.

Note <span id="an_1:64:13:2">2</span>. Púshyati might be joined with
krátu and taken in a transitive sense, he increases his strength. But
púshyati is also used as an intransitive, and means he prospers:

I, 83, 3. ása*m*-yata*h* vraté te ksheti púshyati.

Without let he dwells in thy service and prospers.

Roth reads asa*m*yatta*h*, against the authority of the MSS.

##### Verse 14.

Note <span id="an_1:64:14:1">1</span>. The difficulty of this verse
arises from the uncertainty whether the epithets dhanasp*rí*tam,
ukthyãm, and vi*s*vá*k*arsha*n*im belong to *s*úshma, strength, or to
toká, kith and kin. Roth and Benfey connect them with toká. Now
dhanasp*rí*t is applicable to toká, yet it never occurs joined with toká
again, while it is used with *s*úshma, VI, 19, 8. Ukthyã, literally, to
be praised with hymns, is not used again as an epithet of toká, though
it is quite appropriate to any gift of the gods. Lastly,
vi*s*vá*k*arsha*n*i is never applied to toká, while it is an epithet
used, if not exactly of the strength, *s*úshma, given by the gods, yet
of the fame given by them:

X, 93, 10. dhâtam vîréshu vi*s*vá-*k*arsha*n*i *s*ráva*h*.

Give to these men world-wide glory. Cf. III, 2, 15.

The next difficulty is the exact meaning of vi*s*vá-*k*arsha*n*i, and
such cognate words as vi*s*vá-k*ri*sh*t*i, vi*s*vá-manusha. The only
intelligible meaning I can suggest for these words is, known to all men;
originally, belonging to, reaching to all men; as we say, world-wide or
European fame, meaning by it fame extending over the whole of Europe, or
over the whole world. If Indra, Agni, and the Maruts are called by

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

these names, they mean, as far as I can judge, known, worshipped by all
men. Benfey translates allverständig.

##### Verse 15.

Note <span id="an_1:64:15:1">1</span>. *Ri*ti, the first element of
*ri*ti-sáham, never occurs by itself in the Rig-veda. It comes from the
root ar, to hurt, which was mentioned before ([p.
65](sbe3218.htm#page_65)) in connection with ár-van, hurting, árus,
wound, and ári, enemy. Sám-*ri*ti occurs I, 32, 6. *Ri*ti therefore
means hurting, and *ri*ti-sáh means one who can stand an attack. In our
passage rayím vîrá-vantam *ri*ti-sáham means really wealth consisting in
men who are able to withstand all onslaughts.

The word is used in a similar sense, VI, 14, 4:

agní*h* apsâ´m *ri*ti-sáham vîrám dadâti sát-patim, yásya trásanti
sávasa*h* sam-*k*ákshi *s*átrava*h* bhiyâ´.

Agni gives a strong son who is able to withstand all onslaughts, from
fear of whose strength the enemies tremble when they see him.

In other passages *ri*ti-sáh is applied to Indra:

VIII, 45, 35. bibháya hí tvâ´-vata*h* ugrâ´t abhi-prabhaṅgína*h* dasmâ´t
ahám *ri*ti-sáha*h*.

For I stand in fear of a powerful man like thee, of one who crushes his
enemies, who is strong and withstands all onslaughts.

VIII, 68, 1. tuvi-kûrmím *ri*ti-sáham índra *s*ávish*th*a sát-pate.

Thee, O most powerful Indra, of mighty strength, able to withstand all
onslaughts.

VIII, 88, 1. tam va*h* dasmám *ri*ti-sáham—índram gî*h*-bhí*h* navâmahe.

We call Indra the strong, the resisting, with our songs.

Note <span id="an_1:64:15:2">2</span>. The last sentence finishes six of
the hymns ascribed to Nodhas. It is more appropriate in a hymn addressed
to single deities, such as Agni or Indra, than in a hymn to the Maruts.
We must supply *s*ardha, in order to get a collective word in the
masculine singular.

Nú, as usual, should be scanned n̆ū.

Note <span id="an_1:64:15:3">3</span>. Dhiyâ´-vasu, as an epithet of the
gods, means rich in prayers, i. e. invoked by many worshippers. It does

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

not occur frequently. Besides the hymns of Nodhas, it only occurs
independently in I, 3, 10 (Sarasvatî), III, 3, 2, III, 28, 1 (Agni),
these hymns being all ascribed to the family of Vi*s*vâmitra. In the
last verse, which forms the burden of the hymns of Nodhas, it may have
been intended to mean, he who is rich through the hymn just recited, or
he who rejoices in the hymn, the god to whom it is addressed.

Nodhas, the poet, belongs, according to the Anukrama*n*î, to the family
of Gotama, and in the hymns which are ascribed to him, I, 58-64, the
Gotamas are mentioned several times:

I, 60, 5. tám tvâ vayám pátim agne rayî*n*â´m prá *s*a*m*sâma*h*
matí-bhi*h* gótamâsa*h*.

We, the Gotamas, praise thee with hymns, Agni, the lord of treasures.

I, 61, 16. evá, te hâri-yo*g*ana su-v*ri*ktí índra bráhmâ*n*i
gótamâsa*h* akran.

Truly the Gotamas made holy prayers for thee, O Indra with brilliant
horses! See also I, 63, 9.

In one passage Nodhas himself is called Gotama:

I, 62, 13.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

sanâ-yaté gótama*h* indra návyam  
átakshat bráhma hari-yó*g*anâya,  
su-nîthâ´ya na*h* *s*avasâna nodhâ´*h*—  
prâtá*h* makshú dhiyâ´-vasu*h* *g*agamyât.

</div>

Gotama made a new song for the old (god) with brilliant horses, O Indra!
May Nodhas be a good leader to us, O powerful Indra! May he who is rich
in prayers (Indra) come early and soon!

I feel justified therefore in following the Anukrama*n*î and taking
Nodhas as a proper name. It occurs so again in

I, 61, 14. sadyá*h* bhuvat vîryãya nodhâ´*h*.

May Nodhas quickly attain to power!

In I, 124, 4. nodhâ´*h*-iva may mean like Nodhas, but more likely it has
the general meaning of poet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Next: I, 85. To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)](sbe3222)
