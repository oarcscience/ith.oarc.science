<p>1. In the beginning there arose the Golden Child (Hira<I>n</I>ya-garbha <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:1:1">1</A>); as soon as born, he alone was the lord of all that is. He stablished the earth and this heaven:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>2. He who gives breath, he who gives strength, whose <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:2:1">1</A> command all the bright gods revere, whose shadow <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:2:2">2</A> is immortality, whose shadow is death:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>3. He who through his might became the sole king of the breathing and twinkling <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:3:1">1</A> world, who governs all this, man and beast:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>4. He through whose might <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:4:1">1</A> these snowy mountains are, and the sea, they say, with the distant river (the Ras&acirc; <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:4:2">2</A>), he of whom these regions are indeed the two arms:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>5. He through whom the awful heaven and the earth were made fast <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:5:1">1</A>, he through whom the ether was stablished, and the firmament; he who measured the air in the sky <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:5:2">2</A>:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>

<p>6. He to whom heaven and earth <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:6:1">1</A>, standing firm by his will, look up, trembling in their mind; he over whom the risen sun shines forth:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>7. When the great waters <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:7:1">1</A> went everywhere, holding the germ (Hira<I>n</I>ya-garbha), and generating light, then there arose from them the (sole <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:7:2">2</A>) breath of the gods:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>8. He who by his might looked even over the waters which held power (the germ) and generated the sacrifice (light <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:8:1">1</A>), he who alone is God above all gods <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:8:2">2</A>:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>9. May he not hurt us, he who is the begetter of the earth, or he, the righteous, who begat the heaven; he who also begat the bright and mighty waters:&#8212;Who is the God to whom we shall offer sacrifice?</p>  
<p>[10 <A HREF="sbe3215.htm#an_10:121:10:1">1</A>. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, no other than thou embraces all these created things. May that be ours which we desire when sacrificing to thee: may we be lords of wealth!]</p>

<p>This hymn is ascribed to Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya, and is supposed to be addressed to Ka, Who, i.&nbsp;e. the Unknown God.</p>  
<p>First translated in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, 1859, p. 569; see also Hibbert Lectures; 1882, p. 301; Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 15.</p>  
<p>Verse 1 = VS. XIII, 4; XXIII, 1; XXV, 10; TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; 2, 8, 2; AV. IV, 2, 7.</p>

<p>This is one of the hymns which has always been suspected as modern by European interpreters. The reason is clear. To us the conception of one God, which pervades the whole of this hymn, seems later than the conception of many individual gods, as recognised in various aspects of nature, such as the gods of the sky, the sun, the storms, or the fire. And in a certain sense we may be right, and language also confirms our sentiment. In our hymn there are several words which do not occur again in the Rig-veda, or which occur in places only which have likewise been suspected to be of more modern date. Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha</p>  
<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A></p>  
<p>itself is an &#7941;&#0960;&#0945;&#0958; &#0955;&#0949;&#0947;&#8057;&#0956;&#0949;&#0957;&#0959;&#0957;. S&aacute;m avartata is found only in the last Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala, X, 90, 14; 129, 4. Bh&ucirc;t&aacute; also, in the sense of what is, occurs in the tenth Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala only. It is used three times (X, 55, 2; 58, 12; 90, 2) as opposed to bh&aacute;vya, i.&nbsp;e. what is and what will be; and once more in the sense of all that is (X, 85, 17). &Acirc;tmad&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, in the sense of giving life, is another &#7941;&#0960;&#0945;&#0958; &#0955;&#0949;&#0947;&#8057;&#0956;&#0949;&#0957;&#0959;&#0957;. Pra<I>s</I>&iacute;sh is restricted to Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>alas I (I, 145, 1), IX (IX, 66, 6; 86, 32), and our passage. Him&aacute;vat, &#7941;&#0960;&#0945;&#0958; &#0955;&#0949;&#0947;&#8057;&#0956;&#0949;&#0957;&#0959;&#0957;. The repetition of the relative pronoun in verses 2 and 4 is unusual. In the tenth verse the compound yat-k&acirc;ma<I>h</I> is modern, and the insertion of et&acirc;&acute;ni between tvat and any&aacute;<I>h</I> is at all events exceptional. The passage V, 31, 2 is not parallel, because in tv&aacute;t indra v&aacute;sya<I>h</I> any&aacute;t, the ablative tv&aacute;t is governed by v&aacute;sya<I>h</I>. In VI, 21, 10, n&aacute; tv&acirc;&acute;v&acirc;n any&aacute;<I>h</I> am<I>ri</I>ta tvat asti, any&aacute;<I>h</I> is separated from tv&aacute;t by a vocative only, as in VIII, 24, 11.</p>  
<p>But when we say that a certain hymn is modern, we must carefully consider what we mean. Our hymn, for instance, must have existed not only previous to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a period, for many Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as presuppose it, but previous to the Mantra period also. It is true that no verse of it occurs in the S&acirc;ma-veda, but in the S&acirc;ma-veda-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a IX, 9, 12, verse 1 at least is mentioned&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_67"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>. Most of its verses, however, occur in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, in the Taittir&icirc;ya-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, and in the Atharva-veda-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;, nay, the last verse, to my mind the most suspicious of all, occurs most frequently in the other Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s and Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as.</p>  
<p>But though most of the verses of our hymn occur in other Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s, they do not always occur in the same order.</p>  
<p>In the V&acirc;<I>g</I>. Sa<I>m</I>h. we have the first verse in XIII, 4, but no other verse of our hymn follows. We have the first verse again in XXIII, 1, but not followed by verse 2, but by verse 3 (XXIII, 3)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_68"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>. Then we have verse 1 once more</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A></p>  
<p>in XXV, 10, followed by verse 3 (XXV, 11), by verse 4 (XXV, 12), and then by verse 2 (XXV, 13).</p>  
<p>We have verses 5, 6, 7, 8 in VS. XXXII, 6 and 7, and verses 7 and 8 in VS. XXVII, 25 and 26, while verse 9 is found in XII, 102 only&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_69"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>, and the last verse in X, 20&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_70"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>, and XXIII, 65.</p>  
<p>In the Taitt. Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; the verses follow more regularly, still never quite in the same order as in the Rig-veda. In TS. IV, 1, 8, 3&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A> we have verses 1 to 8, but verse 3 before verse 2, and verse 6 before verse 5, while verse 9 follows in IV, 2, 7, 1.</p>  
<p>In TS. v. 3 stands before v. 2, in VII, 5, 16, 1, and VII, 5, 17, 1.</p>  
<p>In TS. II, 2, 12, the prat&icirc;kas of verses 1, 7, 10 are quoted in succession.</p>  
<p>Verse 7 occurs with important various readings in TA. I, 23, 8, &acirc;&acute;po ha y&aacute;d b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;&acute;r g&aacute;rbham &acirc;&acute;yan d&aacute;ksha<I>m</I> d&aacute;dh&acirc;n&acirc; gan&aacute;yant&icirc;<I>h</I> svayambh&uacute;m, t&aacute;ta im&eacute;<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>dhy&aacute;sri<I>g</I>yanta s&aacute;rg&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Lastly in the AV. we find verses 1 to 7 from IV, 2, 1, to IV, 2, 7, but arranged in a different order, viz. as 2, 3, 6, 5, 4, 7, 1, and with important various readings.</p>  
<p>Verse 2, y&ocirc;&acute; 3 sy&eacute;<I>s</I>e dvip&aacute;do y&aacute;<I>s</I> <I>k</I>&aacute;tushpada<I>h</I>, as third p&acirc;da; also in XIII, 3, 24.</p>  
<p>Verse 3, ek&oacute; r&acirc;&acute;<I>g</I>&acirc;; y&aacute;sya <I>kh</I>&acirc;y&acirc;&acute;m<I>r&iacute;</I>ta<I>m</I> y&aacute;sya m<I>ri</I>ty&uacute;<I>h</I>, as third p&acirc;da.</p>  
<p>Verse 4, y&aacute;sya v&iacute;<I>s</I>ve; samudr&eacute; y&aacute;sya ras&acirc;&acute;m &iacute;d &acirc;h&uacute;<I>h</I>; im&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I><I>k</I>a.</p>  
<p>Verse 5, y&aacute;sya dya&uacute;r urv&icirc;&acute; p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;&acute; <I>k</I>a mah&icirc;&acute; y&aacute;sy&acirc;d&aacute; urv&aacute;mt&aacute;riksham, y&aacute;sy&acirc;sa&uacute; s&ucirc;&acute;ro v&iacute;tato mahitv&acirc;&acute;.</p>  
<p>Verse 6, &aacute;vata<I>s</I> <I>k</I>askabh&acirc;n&eacute; bhiy&aacute;s&acirc;ne r&oacute;das&icirc; &aacute;hvayeth&acirc;m (sic), y&aacute;sy&acirc;sa&uacute; panth&acirc;&acute; r&aacute;<I>g</I>aso vim&acirc;na<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Verse 7, &acirc;&acute;po &aacute;gre v&iacute;<I>s</I>vam &acirc;v&aacute;n g&aacute;rbha<I>m</I> d&aacute;dh&acirc;n&acirc; am<I>r&iacute;</I>t&acirc; <I>ri</I>ta<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>, y&acirc;&acute;su dev&icirc;&acute;shv &aacute;dhi dev&aacute; &acirc;s&icirc;t.</p>

<p>We are justified, therefore, in looking upon the verses, composing this hymn, as existing before the</p>

<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A></p>  
<p>final arrangement of the four Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;s, and if we persist in calling a hymn, dating from that period, a modern hymn, we must make it quite clear that, according to the present state of our knowledge, such a hymn cannot well be more modern than 1000 <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span> Besides the variations in the arrangement of the verses of our hymn, the very considerable various readings which we find in the VS., TS., and AV. are highly instructive, as showing the frequent employment of our hymn for sacrificial purposes. In several cases these various readings are of great importance, as we shall see.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha arose in the beginning; born, he was the one lord of things existing. He established the earth and this sky: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha hat zuerst sich gebildet, er ward geboren als einziger herr alles gewordenen, dise erde and disen himel h&auml;lt er; Ka, dem gotte, m&ouml;chten wir mit havis aufwarten.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:1:1">1</A>. Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A> has been translated in different ways, and it would perhaps be best to keep it as a proper name, which it is in later times. It means literally the golden embryo, the golden germ or child, or born of a golden womb, and was no doubt an attempt at naming the sun. Soon, however, that name became mythological. The golden child was supposed to have been so called because it was Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the lord of creation, when dwelling as yet in the golden egg, and Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha became in the end a recognised name of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, see Say. on X, 121, 1. All this is fully explained by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, TS. IV, 1, 8, 3; IV, 2, 8, 2; by Mah&icirc;dhara, VS. XIII, 4.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: He who gives breath, who gives strength, whose command all, [even] the gods, reverence, whose shadow is immortality, whose shadow is death: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Geber des lebendigen hauches, geber der kraft, zu des unterweisung alle Otter sich einfinden, des glanz die unsterblichkeit, dessen der tod ist, Ka, dem gotte, m&ouml;chten wir mit havis aufwarten.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:2:1">1</A>. In order to account for the repetition of yasya, S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a and Mahidhara take vi<I>s</I>ve for men, and dev&acirc;<I>h</I> for gods.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:2:2">2</A>. It is difficult to say what is meant by <I>kh</I>&acirc;y&acirc;, shadow. I take it in the sense of what belongs to the god, as the shadow belongs to a man, what follows him, or is determined by him. In that sense S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a also takes it, TS. IV, 1, 8, 4, yasya pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pate<I>s</I> <I>kh</I>&acirc;y&acirc;vat sv&acirc;dh&icirc;nam am<I>ri</I>tam, mokshar&ucirc;pam, m<I>ri</I>tyu<I>h</I>, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>in&acirc;m mara<I>n</I>am api, yasya <I>kh</I>&acirc;yeva sv&acirc;dhina<I>h</I>; and, though not quite so clearly, in RV. X, 121, 2. Mah&icirc;dhara on the contrary takes <I>kh</I>&acirc;y&acirc; in the sense of refuge, and says, whose shadow, i.&nbsp;e. whose worship, preceded by knowledge, is am<I>ri</I>ta, immortality, a means of deliverance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>, while ignorance of him is death, or leads to sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: Who by his might became the sole king of the breathing and winking world, who is the lord of this two-footed and four-footed [creation]: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Der des atmenden, augenbewegenden lebendigen durch seine gr&ouml;sze der einzige k&ouml;nig geworden; der verf&uuml;gt &uuml;ber disz zwei- und vier-f&uuml;szige, Ka, dem gotte, m&ouml;chten wir mit havis aufwarten.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:3:1">1</A>. It is difficult to say whether nimishata<I>h</I> means twinkling or sleeping. It has both meanings as to wink has in English. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a (X, 121, 3; TS. IV, 1, 8, 4) and Mahidhara (VS. XXIII, 3&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>) explain it by winking. This may be right as expressing sensuous perception, in addition to mere breathing. In X, 190, 2, v&iacute;<I>s</I>vasya mishat&oacute; va<I>s</I>&icirc;&acute; means, lord of all that winks, i.&nbsp;e.</p>

<p>lives. The later idea, that the gods do not wink, has nothing to do with our passage.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: Whose greatness these snowy mountains, and the sea with the Ras&acirc; (river), declare,&#8212;of whom these regions, of whom they are the arms: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Dessen die schneebedeckten (berge, die Himav&acirc;n) verm&ouml;ge seiner gr&ouml;sze, als des eigentum man ocean und Ras&acirc; nennt, des dise himelsgegenden, des arme sie, Ka, dem gotte, m&ouml;chten wir mit havis aufwarten.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:4:1">1</A>. Muir's translation, which suggests itself very naturally to a European mind, is impossible, because mahitv&acirc;&acute; cannot be either mahitv&aacute;m (as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a also and Mah&icirc;dhara suggest), or mahitv&acirc;&acute;ni; and because &acirc;h&uacute;<I>h</I> does not mean declare. Otherwise nothing could be better than his rendering: 'Whose greatness these snowy mountains, and the sea with the Ras&acirc; (river), declare.'</p>  
<p>Mahitv&acirc;&acute;, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a also rightly perceives, TS. IV, 1, 8, 4, is a very common instrumental (see Lanman, Noun-inflection, pp. 335-6), and the same mahitv&acirc;&acute; must be supplied for samudr&aacute;<I>m</I>. We might make the whole sentence dependent on &acirc;hu<I>h</I> without much change of meaning. The Atharva-veda text supplies a lectio facilior, but not therefore melior.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:4:2">2</A>. The Ras&acirc; is a distant river, in some respects like the Greek Okeanos. Dr. Aufrecht takes it as a name of the milky way, Z.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;G. XIII, 498: see Muir, S.&nbsp;T. II, p. 373, n. 19.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: By whom the sky is fiery, and the earth fixed, by whom the firmament and the heaven were established, who in the atmosphere is the measurer of the aerial space: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Durch den gewaltig der himel and fest die erde, durch den gest&uuml;tzt Svar, and das gew&ouml;lbe, der die r&auml;ume im mittelgebiete ausgemeszen, Ka, dem gotte, m&ouml;chten wir mit havis aufwarten.</p>  
<p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:5:1">1</A>. In this verse I decidedly prefer the reading of the Atharva-veda, yena dyaur ugr&acirc; p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc; ka d<I>ri</I><I>lh</I>e. It seems not a lectio facilior, and we avoid the statement that the heaven has been made ugr&acirc;. Ugr&acirc;, as applied to dyaus, means awful and grand, as an inherent quality rather, and not simply strong. See Ludwig, Notes, p. 441.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:5:2">2</A>. R&aacute;<I>g</I>aso vim&acirc;&acute;na<I>h</I> has been fully discussed by Muir, S.&nbsp;T. IV, p. 71, but it is difficult to find a right translation for it, because the cosmography of the Veda is so different from our own (see I, 6, 9, note 1, and I, 19, 3, note 1). I think we may translate it here by the air, or even by space, particularly the bright air in the sky, the sky (antariksha or nabhas) being between heaven (dyu) and earth (p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;), while sva<I>h</I> and n&acirc;ka are still higher than the heaven (dyu), sva<I>h</I> being sometimes explained as the abode of the sun, the ether, or empyrean, n&acirc;ka, the firmament, as svarga (Mah&icirc;dhara); or sva<I>h</I> as svarga, and n&acirc;ka as &acirc;ditya (S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a). Vim&acirc;na is here simply the measurer, though vim&acirc;, from meaning to measure, is apt to take the meaning of to make, which is an excuse for S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's rendering, 'who makes the rain in the sky.'</p>  
<p>The Atharva-veda rendering is very free, and certainly no improvement.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>

<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:6:1">1</A>. It would be well to read r&oacute;das&icirc; for kr&aacute;ndas&icirc; (which B.&nbsp;R. explain by 'two armies'), and the various reading in AV. IV, 2, 3 decidedly points in that direction. But even if kr&aacute;ndas&icirc; stands, it must be taken in the same sense as r&oacute;das&icirc;. Uditau vyeti in TS.

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: When the great waters pervaded the universe containing an embryo, and generating fire, thence arose the one spirit (asu) of the gods: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Als die groszen waszer kamen, die allen keim in sich faszten, zeugend den Agni, da kam zu Stande der g&ouml;tter einziger lebensgeist; Ka, dem gotte, m&ouml;chten wir mit havis aufwarten.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:7:1">1</A>. The waters here referred to have to be understood as the waters in the beginning of the creation, where, as we read (RV. X, 129, 3), 'everything was like a sea without a light,' or, as the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (XI, 1, 6, 1) says, 'everything was water and sea.' These waters held the germ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>, and produced the golden light, the sun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>, whence arose the life of all the gods, viz. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. The Atharva-veda adds a verse which repeats the same idea more clearly: &acirc;&acute;po vats&aacute;<I>m</I> <I>g</I>an&aacute;yant&icirc;r g&aacute;rbham &aacute;gre s&aacute;mairayan, t&aacute;syot&aacute; <I>g</I>&acirc;&acute;yam&acirc;nasy&oacute;lba &acirc;s&icirc;d dhira<I>n</I>y&aacute;ya<I>h</I>, 'In the beginning the waters, producing a young, brought forth an embryo, and when it was being born, it had a golden covering.' The sunrise serves here as elsewhere as an image of the creation.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:7:2">2</A>. Grassmann proposes to omit eka, because it is absent in the Maitr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc; <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;. The metre shows the same.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: He who through his greatness beheld the waters which contained power, and generated sacrifice, who was the one god above the gods: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>

<p>d&aacute;ksham standing for g&aacute;rbham, ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>am for agn&iacute;m, which is actually the reading of TS. The Atharva-veda does not contain this verse, which is used as an any&acirc; vikalpit&acirc; y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; in TS.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:8:2">2</A>. It is curious that one of the most important sentences in the Rig-veda, yo deveshv adhi deva eka &acirc;s&icirc;t, should have been changed in the Atharva-veda IV, 2, 6 into y&acirc;su dev&icirc;shv adhi deva &acirc;s&icirc;t, 'over which divine waters there was the god.' See Ludwig, Notes, p. 441.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 9.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: May he not injure us, he who is the generator of the earth, who, ruling by fixed ordinances, produced the heavens, who produced the great and brilliant waters: to what god shall we offer our oblation?</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Nicht sch&auml;dige uns, der&nbsp;der erde erzeuger, oder der den himel bereitet mit warhafter satzung, der auch die wasser, die hellen, die m&auml;chtigen erzeugt hat, Ka, dem gotte, mochten wir mit havis aufwarten.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 10.</h5>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Muir</span>: Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, no other than thou is lord over all these created things: may we obtain that, through desire of which we have invoked thee: may we become masters of riches.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, kein anderer als du hat umfasst die wesen alle, der wunsch, um deswillen wir dir opfern, der werde uns zu teil, besitzer von reicht&uuml;mern m&ouml;gen wir sein.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_10:121:10:1">1</A>. This verse is certainly extremely weak after all that preceded, still, to judge from its frequent occurrence, we cannot well discard it. All we can say is that nowhere, except in the Rig-veda, does it form the final verse of our hymn, and thus spoil its whole character.</p>  
<p>That character consists chiefly in the burden of the nine verses, Kasmai dev&acirc;ya havish&acirc; vidhema, 'To what god shall we offer sacrifice?' This is clearly meant to express a desire of finding out the true, but unknown god, and to do so, even after all has been said that can be said of a supreme god. To finish such a hymn with a statement</p>  
<p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A></p>  
<p>that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the god who deserves our sacrifice, may be very natural theologically, but it is entirely uncalled for poetically. The very phrase Kasmai dev&acirc;ya havish&acirc; vidhema must have been a familiar phrase, for we find in a hymn-addressed to the wind, X, 168, 4, after all has been said that can be said of him, the concluding line: gh&oacute;sh&acirc;<I>h</I> it asya <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>vire n&aacute; r&ucirc;p&aacute;m t&aacute;smai v&acirc;&acute;t&acirc;ya hav&iacute;sh&acirc; vidhema, 'his sound indeed is heard, but he is not seen&#8212;to that V&acirc;ta let us offer sacrifice.'</p>  
<p>But more than this, on the strength of hymns like our own in which the interrogative pronoun ka, 'who,' occurs, the Br&acirc;hmans actually invented a god of the name of Ka. I pointed this out many years ago in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (1860, p. 433), where I said: In accordance with the same system, we find that the authors of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as had so completely broken with the past that, forgetful of the poetical character of the hymns, and the yearning of the poets after the unknown god, they exalted the interrogative pronoun into a deity,' and acknowledged a god 'Ka, or Who.' In the Taittir&icirc;ya-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (I, 7, 6, 6), in the Kaush&icirc;taki-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (XXIV, 4), in the T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (XV, 10), and in the Satapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>, whenever interrogative verses occur, the author states, that Ka is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, or 'the Lord of Creatures' (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;patir vai Ka<I>h</I>). Nor did they stop there. Some of the hymns in which the interrogative pronoun occurred were called Kadvat, i.&nbsp;e. having kad or quid. But soon a new adjective was formed, and not only the hymns, but the sacrifices also, offered to the god, were called K&acirc;ya, or who-ish&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>. This word, which is not to be identified with the Latin cujus, cuja, cujum, but is merely the artificial product of an effete mind, is found in the Taittir&icirc;ya-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (I, 8, 3, 1), and in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>asaneyi-sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (XXIV, 15). At the time of P&acirc;<I>n</I>ini</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A></p>  
<p>this word had acquired such legitimacy as to call for a separate rule explaining its formation (P&acirc;<I>n</I>. IV, 2, 25). The commentator there explains Ka by Brahman. After this we can hardly wonder that in the later Sanskrit literature of the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, Ka appears as a recognised god, as the supreme god, with a genealogy of his own, perhaps even with a wife; and that in the Laws of Manu, one of the recognised forms of marriage, generally known by the name of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-marriage, occurs under the monstrous title of 'K&acirc;ya.' Stranger still, grammarians who know that ka forms the dative kasmai only if it is an interrogative pronoun, consider kasmai in our hymn as irregular, because, as a proper name, Ka ought to form the dative K&acirc;ya.</p>
