<p>Having said so much in vindication of the text of the Rig-veda as published by me, and in defence of my principles of criticism which seem to me so self-evident as hardly to deserve the name of canones critici, I feel bound at the same time both to acknowledge some inaccuracies that have occurred in the index at the end of each volume, and to defend some entries in that index which have been challenged without sufficient cause.</p>  
<p><a name="page_lxviii"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxviii</font></A></p>  
<p>It has been supposed that in the index at the end of my fourth volume, the seventeenth verse of the 34th hymn in <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's quotations from the Sarv&acirc;nukrama<I>n</I>&icirc;.</FONT></span>the seventh Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala has been wrongly assigned to Ahi Budhnya, and that one half only of that verse should have been reserved for that deity. I do not deny that we should be justified in deriving that sense from the words of the Anukrama<I>n</I>ik&acirc;, but I cannot admit that my own interpretation is untenable. As S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a does not speak authoritatively on the subject, I followed the authority of Sha<I>d</I>guru<I>s</I>ishya. This commentator of the Anukrama<I>n</I>ik&acirc; says: atra <I>k</I>a ab<I>g</I>&acirc;m ukthair ahim g<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&icirc;sha ity ardhar<I>k</I>o<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>b<I>g</I>an&acirc;mno&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_30"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A> devasya stuti<I>h</I>; m&acirc; no<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>hir budhnya ity ardhar<I>k</I>o<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>hirbudhnyan&acirc;mno devasya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">b</FONT></A>. Another commentator says: ab<I>g</I>&acirc;m ukthair ardhar<I>k</I>o<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>hi<I>h</I>; uttaro m&acirc; no<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>hir ity ahir budhnya<I>h</I>. From this we learn that both commentators looked upon the Dvipad&acirc;s as ardhar<I>k</I>as or half-verses, and ascribed the whole of verse 16 to Ahir ab<I>g</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>, the whole of verse 17 to Ahir budhnya<I>h</I>. It will be seen from an accurate examination of S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's commentary on verse 17, that in the second interpretation of the second half of verse 17, he labours to show that in this portion, too, Ahir budhnya<I>h</I> may be considered as the deity.</p>  
<p>It is perfectly right to say that the words of the Anukrama<I>n</I>ik&acirc;, ab<I>g</I>&acirc;m ahe<I>h</I>, signify that the verse beginning with ab<I>g</I>&acirc;m, belongs to Ahi. But there was no misprint in my index. It will be seen that Sha<I>d</I>guru<I>s</I>ishya goes even beyond me, and calls that deity simply Ab<I>g</I>a, leaving out Ahi altogether, as understood. I was anxious to show the distinction between Ab<I>g</I>&acirc; Ahi<I>h</I> and Ahir Budhnya<I>h</I>, as the deities of the two successive verses, and I did not expect that any reader could possibly misinterpret my entry&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_32"><FONT SIZE="1">c</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>With regard to hymns 91 and 92 of the seventh Ma<I>n</I><I>d</I>ala, it is true, that in the index I did not mention that certain verses in which two deities are mentioned (91, 2;</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 4-7; 92, 2), must be considered as addressed not to V&acirc;yu alone, but to V&acirc;yu and Indra. It will be seen from S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's introduction to hymn 90, that he, too, wrongly limits the sentence of the Anukrama<I>n</I>ik&acirc;, aindrya<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a y&acirc; dvivadukt&acirc;<I>h</I>, to the fifth and following verses of hymn 90, and that he never alludes to this proviso again in his introductory remarks to hymn 91 and 92, though, of course, he explains the verses, in which a dual occurs, as addressed to two deities, viz. Indra and V&acirc;yu. The same omission, whether intentional or unintentional, occurs in Sha<I>d</I>guru<I>s</I>ishya's commentary. The other commentary, however, assigns the verses of the three hymns rightly. The subject has evidently been one that excited attention in very early days, for in the Aitareya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, V, 20, we actually find that the word v&acirc;m which occurs in hymn 90, 1, and which might be taken as a dual, though S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains it as a singular, is changed into te&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_33"><FONT SIZE="1">a</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>In hymn VII, 104, rakshoha<I>n</I>au might certainly be added as an epithet of Indr&acirc;-Somau, and Sha<I>d</I>guru<I>s</I>ishya clearly takes it in that sense. The Anukrama<I>n</I>ik&acirc; says: indr&acirc;som&acirc; pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;dhikaindr&acirc;soma<I>m</I> r&acirc;kshoghna<I>m</I> s&acirc;p&acirc;bhi<I>s</I>&acirc;papr&acirc;yam.</p>  
<p>In hymn VIII, 67, it has been supposed that the readings Samada and S&acirc;mada instead of Sammada and S&acirc;mmada were due to a misprint. This is not the case. That I was aware of the other spelling of this name, viz. Sammada and S&acirc;mmada, I had shown in my History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature (2nd ed.), p. 39, where I had translated the passage of the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tras in which Matsya S&acirc;mmada occurs, and had also called attention to the &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tras X, 7, and the <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a XIII, 3, 1, 1,</p>

</p>

<p><a name="page_lxx"><font size="1" color="green">p. lxx</font></A></p>  
<p>where the same passage is found. I there spelt the name S&acirc;mmada, because the majority of the MSS. were in favour of that spelling. In the edition of the &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tras, which has since been published by R&acirc;ma N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a Vidy&acirc;ra<I>n</I>ya, the name is spelt S&acirc;mada. My own opinion is that S&acirc;mmada is the right spelling, but that does not prove that S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a thought so; and unless I deviated from the principles which I had adopted for a critical restoration of S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's text, I could not but write S&acirc;mada in our passage. B 1 and B 4 omit s&acirc;mada, but both give samad&acirc;khyasya; Ca. gives likewise samad&acirc;khyasya, and A. semad&acirc;khyasya. This, I believe, was meant by the writer for sammad&acirc;khyasya, for in the passage from the Anukrama<I>n</I>&icirc; both A. and Ca. give s&acirc;mmado. I then consulted the commentary of Sha<I>d</I>guru<I>s</I>ishya, and there again the same MS. gave twice s&acirc;mmada, once s&acirc;mada, which is explained by samad&acirc;khyamah&acirc;m&icirc;nar&acirc;<I>g</I>aputra<I>h</I>. A better MS. of Sha<I>d</I>guru<I>s</I>ishya, MS. Wilson 379 gives the readings s&acirc;mmado, s&acirc;mmada, and sammad&acirc;khyasya. The other commentary gives distinctly s&acirc;manda. [I have adopted sammada in the new edition.]</p>  
<p>In IX, 68, Professor Aufrecht adopts what he considers the bold reading Vatsapr&icirc;; I prefer to be timid and allow S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a his own reading Vatsapri&#774;; see Sarv&acirc;nukrama<I>n</I>&icirc;, ed. Macdonell, pp. 34, 146.</p>
