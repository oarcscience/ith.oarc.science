<p>1. The chasing <A HREF="sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:1:1">1</A> Maruts with gleaming spears, the golden-breasted, have gained great strength, they move along on quick well-broken horses;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>2. You have yourselves, you know, acquired power; you shine bright and wide, you great ones. They have even measured the sky with their strength;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>3. The strong heroes, born together, and nourished together, have further grown to real beauty. They shine brilliantly like the rays of the sun;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>4. Your greatness, O Maruts, is to be honoured, it is to be yearned for like the sight of the sun. Place us also in immortality;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>5. O Maruts you raise <A HREF="sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:1">1</A> the rain from the sea, and rain it down, O yeomen <A HREF="sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:2">2</A>! Your milch-cows, O destroyers <A HREF="sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:5:3">3</A>, are never destroyed;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>6. When you have joined the deer as horses <A HREF="sbe3237.htm#an_5:55:6:1">1</A> to the shafts, and have clothed yourselves in golden garments, then, O Maruts, you scatter all enemies;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>7. Not mountains, not rivers have kept you back, wherever you see, O Maruts, there you go. You</p>  
<p><a name="page_334"><font size="1" color="green">p. 334</font></A></p>  
<p>go even round heaven and earth;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>8. Be it old, O Maruts, or be it new, be it spoken, O Vasus, or be it recited, you take cognisance of it all;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>9. Have mercy on us, O Maruts, do not strike us, extend to us your manifold protection. Do remember the praise, the friendship;&#8212;when they went in triumph, the chariots followed.</p>  
<p>10. Lead us, O Maruts, towards greater wealth, and out of tribulations, when you have been praised. O worshipful Maruts, accept our offering, and let us be lords of treasures!</p>

<p>The same poet, <I>S</I>y&acirc;v&acirc;<I>s</I>va &Acirc;treya. Metre, 1-9 <I>G</I>agat&icirc;; 10 Trish<I>t</I>ubh. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV. Verse 5 is found in TS. II, 4, 8, 2; MS. II, 4, 7. The refrain probably means that when the Maruts march in triumph, the chariots of their army, or the chariots of other gods, follow. The latter view is taken by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, TS. II, 4, 8, 2.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:55:1:1">1</A>. Pr&aacute;ya<I>g</I>yu, generally explained by rushing forward, but in that sense hardly to be derived from ya<I>g</I>, to sacrifice, may stand for an old Vedic form prayakshyu, changed into praya<I>g</I>yu by priests who had forgotten the root yaksh, and thought of nothing but sacrifices. This root yaksh has been identified by Grassmann with OHG. jag&ocirc;n (venari, persequi), originally to rush after, to hunt, to try to injure or kill (cf. m<I>ri</I>ga<I>n</I>y&aacute;va<I>h</I>, X, 40, 4). This would explain most derivations from yaksh, not excepting the later Yakshas, and . would yield an excellent sense for prayakshyu, as an epithet of the Maruts. Sec note to VII, 56, 16. Pischel, Ved. Stud. I, p. 98, is satisfied with deriving praya<I>g</I>yu and p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>apraya<I>g</I> from the root ya<I>g</I>, to sacrifice, and translates it by sacrificing, but in the sense of causing sacrifices to be offered.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:55:5:1">1</A>. The verb &icirc;rayatha is transitive; see Gaedicke, Accusativ, p. 54, and compare AV. IV, 27, 4. ap&aacute;<I>h</I> samudr&acirc;&acute;d d&iacute;vam &uacute;d vahanti.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:55:5:2">2</A>. I have translated pur&icirc;shi<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> by yeomen, in the sense of cultivators of the land. I have followed Roth, who shows that pur&icirc;sha means soil, and that pur&icirc;shin is used for an occupier of the soil, a landlord. See K.&nbsp;Z. XXVI, p. 65.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:55:5:3">3</A>. Dasra, powerful, a common epithet of the A<I>s</I>vins, seems here, when joined with dasyanti, to retain something</p>  
<p><a name="page_336"><font size="1" color="green">p. 336</font></A></p>  
<p>of its etymological meaning, which comes out clearly in d&acirc;s, to attack, unless it is derived from da<I>m</I>s.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:55:6:1">1</A>. I prefer to translate here 'the deer as horses,' not 'the speckled horses.' See, however, II, 34, 4, and Pischel, Ved. Stud. p. 226.</p>
