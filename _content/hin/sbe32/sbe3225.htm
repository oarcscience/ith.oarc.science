<p>1. Come hither, Maruts, on your chariots charged with lightning, resounding with beautiful songs <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:1:1">1</A>, stored with spears, and winged with horses! Fly <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:1:3">3</A> to us like birds, with your best food <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:1:2">2</A>, you mighty ones!</p>  
<p>2. They come gloriously on their red, or, it may be, on their tawny horses which hasten their chariots. He who holds the axe <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:2:1">1</A> is brilliant like gold;&#8212;with the tire <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:2:2">2</A> of the chariot they have struck the earth.</p>  
<p>3. On your bodies there are daggers for beauty; may they stir up our minds <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:3:1">1</A> as they stir up the forests. For yourselves, O well-born Maruts, the vigorous (among you) shake <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:3:2">2</A> the stone (for distilling Soma).</p>  
<p>4. Days went round you and came back <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:4:1">1</A>, O hawks, back to this prayer, and to this sacred rite; the Gotamas making prayer with songs, pushed up the lid of the well (the cloud) for to drink.</p>  
<p>5. No such hymn <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:5:1">1</A> was ever known as this which Gotama sounded for you, O Maruts, when he saw you on golden wheels, wild boars <A HREF="sbe3225.htm#an_1:88:5:2">2</A> rushing about with iron tusks.</p>  
<p>6. This comforting speech rushes sounding towards you, like the speech of a suppliant: it rushed freely from our hands as our speeches are wont to do.</p>  
<p><a name="page_170"><font size="1" color="green">p. 170</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>This hymn is ascribed to Gotama, the son of Rah&ucirc;ga<I>n</I>a. The metre varies. Verses 1 and 6 are put down as Prast&acirc;ra-pa&#7749;kti, i.&nbsp;e. as 12 + 12 + 8 + 8. By merely counting the syllables, and dissolving semivowels, it is just possible to get twenty-four syllables in the first line of verses 1 and 6. The old metricians must have scanned verse 1:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&acirc;&#772; vi&#772;d&#774;yu&#772;nma&#772;t-bhi&#772;<I>h</I> ma&#774;ru&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> s&ucirc;&#774;-a&#772;rkai&#772;<I>h</I><br> ra&#774;the&#772;bhi&#772;<I>h</I> y&acirc;&#772;ta &#865;&#772;<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i&#774;ma&#772;t-bhi&#774;<I>h</I> a&#772;<I>s</I>va&#774;-pa&#772;r<I>n</I>ai&#772;<I>h</I>.</div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Again verse 6:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">e&#772;sh&acirc;&#772; sy&#774;&acirc;&#772; va&#772;<I>h</I> ma&#774;ru&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> a&#774;nu&#774;-bha&#772;rtr&icirc;&#772;<br> pra&#774;ti&#772; sto&#772;bha&#774;ti&#774; v&acirc;&#772;gha&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; v&acirc;&#772;n&#774;&icirc;&#772;.</div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> But the general character of these lines shows that they were intended for hendecasyllabics, each ending in a bacchius, though even then they are not free from irregularities. The first verse would scan:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&acirc;&#772; vi&#772;dy&#774;u&#772;nma&#772;t-bhi&#772;<I>h</I> ma&#774;ru&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> su&#774;-a&#772;rkai&#772;<I>h</I><br> ra&#774;the&#772;bhi&#772;<I>h</I> y&acirc;&#772;ta &#865;&#772;<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i&#774;ma&#772;t-(bhi&#774;<I>h</I>) a&#772;sva&#774;-pa&#772;r<I>n</I>ai&#772;<I>h</I>.</div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> And verse 6:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">e&#772;sh&acirc;&#772; sy&#774;&acirc;&#772;, va&#772;<I>h</I> ma&#774;ru&#774;ta<I>h</I> &#865;&#772;anu&#774;-bha&#772;rtr&icirc;&#772;<br> pra&#774;ti&#772; sto&#772;bha&#774;ti&#774; v&acirc;&#772;gha&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; v&acirc;&#772;<I>n</I>&icirc;&#772;.</div></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Our only difficulty would be the termination bhi<I>h</I> of <I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>imat-bhi<I>h</I>. I cannot adopt Professor Kuhn's suggestion to drop the Visarga of bhi<I>h</I> and change i into y (Beitr&auml;ge, vol. iv, p. 198), for this would be a license without any parallel. It is different with sa<I>h</I>, originally sa, or with feminines in i<I>h</I>, where parallel forms in &icirc; are intelligible. The simplest correction would be to read ra&#774;the&#772;bhi&#772;<I>h</I> y&acirc;&#772;ta &#865;&#772;<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i&#774;-ma&#772;nta<I>h</I> &#865;&#772;a<I>s</I>va&#774;-pa&#772;r<I>n</I>ai<I>h</I>. One might urge in support of this reading that in all other passages where <I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>imat occurs, it refers to the Maruts themselves, and never to their chariots. Yet the difficulty remains, how could so simple a reading have been replaced by a more difficult one?</p>  
<p><a name="page_171"><font size="1" color="green">p. 171</font></A></p>  
<p>In the two G&acirc;yatr&icirc; p&acirc;das which follow I feel equally reluctant to alter. I therefore scan</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">&acirc;&#772; va&#772;rshi&#772;sh<I>th</I>a&#774;y&acirc;&#772; na&#774;<I>h</I> i&#774;sh&acirc;&#772; va&#774;ya&#772;<I>h</I> na&#774; pa&#772;pt&#773;&#774;a&#773;t&#773;&#774;a su&#774;-m&acirc;&#772;y&acirc;&#772;<I>h</I>,</div></p>  
<p>taking the dactyl of paptata as representing a spondee, and admitting the exception&agrave;l bacchius instead of the amphimacer at the end of the line.</p>  
<p>The last line of verse 6 should be scanned:</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">a&#774;sto&#772;bha&#774;ya&#772;t v<I>ri</I>&#774;th&acirc; &#865;&#772;&acirc;s&acirc;&#774;m&#772; a&#774;nu&#772; sva&#774;dh&acirc;&#772;m ga&#774;bha&#772;sty&#774;o&#772;<I>h</I>.</div></p>  
<p>There are two other verses in this hymn where the metre is difficult. In the last p&acirc;da of verse 5 we have seven syllables instead of eleven. Again, I say, it would be most easy to insert one of the many tetrasyllabic epithets of the Maruts. But this would have been equally easy for the collectors of the Veda. Now the authors of the Anukrama<I>n</I>&icirc;s distinctly state that this fifth verse is vir&acirc;<I>d</I>r&ucirc;p&acirc;, i.&nbsp;e. that one of its p&acirc;das consists of eight syllables. How they would have made eight syllables out of vi-dh&acirc;vata<I>h</I> var&acirc;h&ucirc;n does not appear, but at all events they knew that last p&acirc;da to be imperfect. The rhythm does not suffer by this omission, as long as we scan vi&#774;-dh&acirc;&#772;va&#774;ta&#772;<I>h</I> va&#774;r&acirc;&#772;h&ucirc;&#772;n.</p>  
<p>Lastly, there is the third p&acirc;da of the second verse, rukma<I>h</I> na <I>k</I>itra<I>h</I> svadhiti-v&acirc;n. It would not be possible to get eleven syllables out of this, unless we admitted vy&ucirc;ha not only in sv&#774;a&#774;dhi&#774;ti&#774;v&acirc;&#772;n or sv&#774;a&#774;dhi&#774;t&icirc;&#772;-v&acirc;&#772;n, but also in <I>k</I>i&#774;tra&#774;<I>h</I>&#772;. Kuhn (Beitr&auml;ge, vol. iv, p. 192) proposes to scan rukma&uuml; na <I>k</I>itara<I>h</I> svadhitiv&acirc;n. Nothing would be easier than to insert esh&acirc;m after <I>k</I>itra<I>h</I>, but the question occurs again, how could esh&acirc;m be lost, or why, if by some accident it had been lost, was not so obvious a correction made by <I>S</I>aunaka and K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana?</p>  
<p>No verse of this hymn occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., TB.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 1.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:1:1">1</A>. Alluding to the music of the Maruts, and not to the splendour of the lightning which is mentioned before. See Wolf, Beitr&auml;ge zur Deutschen Mythologie, vol. ii, p. 137. 'Das Ross and den Wagen des Gottes begleitet munterer H&ouml;rnerschall, entweder st&ouml;sst er selbst ins Horn,</p>  
<p><a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="green">p. 172</font></A></p>  
<p>oder sein Gefolge. Oft vernimmt man auch eine liebliche Musik, der keine auf Erden gleich kommt (M&uuml;llenhof, 582). Das wird das Pfeifen and Heulen des Sturmes sein, nur in idealisirter Art.' Ibid. p. 158.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:1:2">2</A>. V&aacute;rshish<I>th</I>a, which is generally explained as the superlative of v<I>ri</I>ddha, old (P&acirc;<I>n</I>. VI, 4, 157), has in most passages of the Rig-veda the more general meaning of strong or excellent: VI, 47, 9. &iacute;sham &acirc;&acute; vakshi ish&acirc;&acute;m v&aacute;rshish<I>th</I>&acirc;m; III, 13, 7 (v&aacute;su); III, 26, 8 (r&aacute;tna); III, 16, 3 (ra&iacute;); IV, 31, 15; VIII, 46, 24 (<I>s</I>r&aacute;va<I>h</I>); IV, 22, 9 (n<I>ri</I>m<I>n</I>&aacute;); V, 67, 1 (kshatr&aacute;); VI, 45, 31 (m&ucirc;rdh&aacute;n). In some passages, however, it may be taken in the sense of oldest (I, 37, 6; V, 7, 1), though by no means necessarily. V&aacute;rshish<I>th</I>a is derived in reality from v<I>r&iacute;</I>shan, in the sense of strong, excellent. See note to I, 85, 12, page <A HREF="sbe3222.htm#page_144">144</A>.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:1:3">3</A>. Paptata, the second person plural of the imperative of what is commonly, though without much reason, called the aorist of the causative of pat. It is curiously like the Greek &#0960;&#0943;&#0960;&#0964;&#0949;&#0964;&#0949;, but it has the meaning of flying rather than falling; see Curtius, Grundz&uuml;ge, p. 190. Two other forms formed on the same principle occur in the Rig-veda, papta<I>h</I> and paptan:</p>  
<p>II, 31, 1. pr&aacute; y&aacute;t v&aacute;ya<I>h</I> n&aacute; p&aacute;ptan.</p>  
<p>That they may fly to us like birds.</p>  
<p>VI, 63, 6. pr&aacute; v&acirc;m v&aacute;ya<I>h</I>&#8212;&aacute;nu paptan.</p>  
<p>May your birds fly after you.</p>  
<p>X, 95, 15. p&uacute;r&ucirc;rava<I>h</I> m&acirc;&acute; m<I>ri</I>th&acirc;<I>h</I> m&acirc;&acute; pr&aacute; papta<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>Pur&ucirc;ravas, do not die, do not go away!</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 2.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:2:1">1</A>. Though svadhiti-v&acirc;n does not occur again, it can only mean he who holds the axe, or, it may be, the sword or the thunderbolt, the latter particularly, if Indra is here intended. Svadhiti signifies axe:</p>  
<p>III, 2, 10. sv&aacute;-dhitim n&aacute; t&eacute;<I>g</I>ase.</p>  
<p>They adorned Agni like an axe to shine or to cut.</p>  
<p>The sv&aacute;dhiti is used by the butcher, I, 162, 9; 18; 20; and by the wood-cutter or carpenter, III, 8, 6; 11; X, 89, 7, &amp;c. Roth (s.&nbsp;v.) takes svadhiti as meaning also a tree,</p>  
<p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></A></p>  
<p>possibly the oak, and he translates svadhitiv&acirc;n in our passage by a chariot made of the wood of the Svadhiti tree. In RV. IX, 96, 6, sv&aacute;dhitir v&aacute;n&acirc;n&acirc;m may well mean 'the strong axe among woods,' the axe being naturally made of the strongest wood. In V, 32, 10, a dev&icirc;&acute; sv&aacute;dhiti<I>h</I> is mentioned, possibly the lightning, the companion of Indra and the Maruts.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:2:2">2</A>. The tire of the chariot of the Maruts is frequently mentioned. It was considered not only as an essential part of their chariot, but likewise as useful for crushing the enemy:</p>  
<p>V, 52, 9. ut&aacute; pavy&acirc;&acute; r&aacute;th&acirc;n&acirc;m &aacute;drim bhindanti &oacute;<I>g</I>as&acirc;.</p>  
<p>They cut the mountain (cloud) with the tire of their chariots.</p>  
<p>I, 166, 10. pav&iacute;shu kshur&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> &aacute;dhi.</p>  
<p>On their tires are sharp edges.</p>  
<p>In V, 31, 5, tires are mentioned without horses and chariot, which were turned by Indra against the Dasyus (I, 64, 11). I doubt, however, whether in India or elsewhere the tires or the wheels of chariots were ever used as weapons of attack, as detached from the chariot; (see M.&nbsp;M., On Pav&icirc;rava, in Beitr&auml;ge zur Vergleichenden Sprachforschung, vol. iii, p. 447.) If we translate the figurative language of the Vedic poets into matter-of-fact terms, the tires of the chariots of the Maruts may be rendered by thunderbolts; yet by the poets of the Veda, as by the ancient people of Germany, thunder was really supposed to be the noise of the chariot of a god, and it was but a continuation of the same belief that the sharp wheels of that chariot were supposed to cut and crush the clouds; (see M.&nbsp;M., loc. cit., p. 444.)</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:3:1">1</A>. That the v&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&icirc;s are small weapons, knives or daggers, we saw before, p. 71. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a here explains v&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&icirc; by a weapon commonly called &acirc;ra, or an awl. In X, 101, 10, v&acirc;&acute;<I>s</I>&icirc;s are mentioned, made of stone, a<I>s</I>man-m&aacute;y&icirc;.</p>  
<p>The difficulty begins with the second half. Medh&acirc;&acute;, as here written in the Pada text, could only be a plural of</p>  
<p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A></p>  
<p>a neuter medh&aacute;, but such a neuter does nowhere exist in the Veda. We only find the masculine m&eacute;dha, sacrifice, which is out of the question here, on account of its accent. Hence the passage III, 58, 2, &ucirc;rdhv&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> bhavanti pit&aacute;r&acirc;-iva m&eacute;dh&acirc;<I>h</I>, is of no assistance, unless we alter the accent. The feminine medh&acirc;&acute; means will, thought, prayer: I, 18, 6; II, 34, 7; IV, 33, 10; V, 27, 4; 42, 13; VII, 104, 6; VIII, 6, 10; 52, 9; IX, 9, 9; 26, 3; 32, 6; 65, 16; 107, 25; X, 91, 8. The construction does not allow us to take medh&acirc;&acute; as a Vedic instrumental instead of medh&aacute;y&acirc;, nor does such a form occur anywhere else in the Rig-veda. Nothing remains, I believe, but to have recourse to conjecture, and the addition of a single Visarga in the Pada would remove all difficulty. In the next line, if tuvi-dyumn&acirc;&acute;sa<I>h</I> be the subject, it would signify the priests. This, however, is again without any warrant from the Rig-veda, where tuvi-dyumn&aacute; is always used as an epithet of gods. I therefore take it as referring to the Maruts, as an adjective in the nominative, following the vocatives maruta<I>h</I> su-<I>g</I>&acirc;t&acirc;<I>h</I>. The conception that the Maruts stir up the forests is not of unfrequent occurrence in the Rig-veda cf. I, 171, 3. That &ucirc;rdhv&aacute; is used of the mind, in the sense of roused, may be seen in I, 119, 2; 134, I; 144, 1; VII, 64, 4. The idea in the poet's mind seems to have been that the thunderbolts of the Maruts rouse up men to prayer as they stir the tops of the forest trees. Ludwig takes medha, masc., in the sense of lance, comparing it with Icelandic meidhr, but the two words cannot well be the same. Possibly vana may be meant for lances: 'May they raise our minds, like lances;' see note to I, 171, 3.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:3:2">2</A>. On dhan in the sense of to agitate, see B. and R. s.&nbsp;v. The shaking of the stone may be the shaking of the stone for distilling the heavenly Soma or the rain; but adri may also be meant for the thunderbolt. I now take tuvidyumna for an adjective referring to the Maruts, because it is a divine rather than a human epithet. Still, the passage is doubtful.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 4.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:4:1">1</A>. The first question is, which is the subject, &aacute;h&acirc;ni</p>  
<p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A></p>  
<p>or g<I>r&iacute;</I>dhr&acirc;<I>h</I>? If g<I>r&iacute;</I>dhr&acirc;<I>h</I> were the subject, then we should have to translate it by the eager poets, and take &aacute;h&acirc;ni in the sense of vi<I>s</I>v&acirc; ah&acirc;ni. The sense then might be: 'Day by day did the eager poets sing around you this prayer.' There would be several objections, however, to this rendering. First, g<I>r&iacute;</I>dhr&acirc;<I>h</I>, though metaphorically applicable to poets, never occurs again as signifying poets or priests. One passage only could be quoted in support, IX, 97, 57, kav&aacute;ya<I>h</I> n&aacute; g<I>r&iacute;</I>dhr&acirc;<I>h</I> (not g<I>ri</I>dhr&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I>), like greedy poets. But even here, if indeed the translation is right, the adjective is explained by kav&iacute;, and does not stand by itself. Secondly, &aacute;h&acirc;ni by itself is never used adverbially in the sense of day after day. The only similar passage that might be quoted is III, 34, 10, and that is very doubtful. To take &aacute;h&acirc;ni as a totally different word, viz. as &aacute; + h&acirc;ni, without ceasing, without wearying, would be too bold in the present state of Vedic interpretation. If then we take &aacute;h&acirc;ni as the subject, g<I>r&iacute;</I>dhr&acirc;<I>h</I> would have to be taken as a vocative, and intended for the Maruts. Now, it is perfectly true, that by itself g<I>r&iacute;</I>dhra, hawk, does not occur again as a name of the Maruts, but <I>s</I>yen&aacute;, hawk, and particularly a strong hawk (IX, 96, 6), is not only a common simile applied to the Maruts, but is actually used as one of their names:</p>  
<p>VII, 56, 3. abh&iacute; sva-p&ucirc;&acute;bhi<I>h</I> mith&aacute;<I>h</I> vapanta v&acirc;&acute;ta-svanasa<I>h</I> <I>s</I>yen&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> asp<I>ri</I>dhran.</p>  
<p>They plucked each other with their beaks (?), the hawks, rushing like the wind, strove together.</p>  
<p>Agu<I>h</I> might be the aorist of gai, to sing, or of g&acirc;, to go:</p>  
<p>I, 174, 8. s&aacute;n&acirc; t&acirc;&acute; te indra n&aacute;vy&acirc;<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; agu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>New poets, O Indra, sang these thy old deeds.</p>  
<p>III, 56, 2. g&acirc;&acute;va<I>h</I> &acirc;&acute; agu<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The cows approached.</p>  
<p>If then the sense of the first line is, 'Days went and came back to you,' the next question is whether we are to extend the construction to the next words, im&acirc;&acute;m dh&iacute;yam v&acirc;rk&acirc;ry&acirc;&acute;m <I>k</I>a dev&icirc;&acute;m, or whether these words are to be joined to k<I>ri</I><I>n</I>v&aacute;nta<I>h</I>, like br&aacute;hma. The meaning of</p>  
<p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A></p>  
<p>v&acirc;rk&acirc;ry&acirc;&acute; is, of course, unknown. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's interpretation as 'what is to be made by means of water' is merely etymological, and does not help us much. It is true that the object of the hymn, which is addressed to the Maruts, is rain, and that literally v&acirc;rk&acirc;ry&acirc;&acute; might be explained as 'that the effect of which is rain.' But this is far too artificial a word for Vedic poets. Possibly there was some other word that had become unintelligible and which, by a slight change, was turned into v&acirc;rk&acirc;ry&acirc;&acute;, in order to give the meaning of rain-producing. It might have been <I>k</I>ark&acirc;rya, glorious, or the song of a poet called V&acirc;rkara, or, as Ludwig suggests, V<I>ri</I>k&acirc;ri. The most likely supposition is that v&acirc;rk&acirc;ry&acirc;&acute; was the name given to some famous hymn, some p&aelig;an or song of triumph belonging to the Gotamas, possibly to some verses of the very hymn before us. In this case the epithet dev&icirc;&acute; would be quite appropriate, for it is frequently used for a sacred or sacrificial song: IV, 43, 2: dev&icirc;&acute;m su-stut&iacute;m; III, i 8, 3. im&acirc;&acute;m dh&iacute;yam <I>s</I>ata-s&eacute;y&acirc;ya dev&icirc;&acute;m. See, however, the note to verse 6.</p>  
<p>The purport of the whole line would then be that many days have gone for the Maruts as well as for the famous hymn once addressed to them by Gotama, or, in other words, that the Gotamas have long been devoted to the Maruts, an idea frequently recurring in the hymns of the Veda, and, in our case, carried on in the next verse, where it is said that the present hymn is like one that Gotama composed when he saw the Maruts or spoke of them as wild boars with iron tusks. The pushing up the lid of the well for to drink, means that they obtained rain from the cloud, which is here, as before, represented as a covered well.</p>

<p>The great chariot with horses.</p>  
<p>It then became the name for a distance to be accomplished without unharnessing the horses, just as the Latin jugum, a yoke, then a juger of land, 'quod uno jugo boum uno die exarari posset,' Pliny XVIII, 3, 3, 9.</p>  
<p>In our passage, however, y&oacute;<I>g</I>ana means a hymn, lit. a composition, which is clearly its meaning in</p>  
<p>VIII, 90, 3. br&aacute;hma te indra girva<I>n</I>a<I>h</I> kriy&aacute;nte &aacute;natidbhut&acirc;, im&acirc;&acute; <I>g</I>ushasva hari-a<I>s</I>va y&oacute;<I>g</I>an&acirc; &iacute;ndra y&acirc;&acute; te &aacute;manmahi.</p>  
<p>Unequalled prayers are made for thee, praiseworthy Indra; accept these hymns which we have devised for thee, O Indra with bright horses!</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_1:88:5:2">2</A>. Var&acirc;&acute;hu has here the same meaning as var&acirc;h&aacute;, wild boar (VIII, 77, 10; X, 28, 4).

Except in this passage, var&acirc;ha has the accent on the last syllable. In IX, 97, 7, var&acirc;h&aacute; is applied to Soma.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 6.</h5>  
<p>This last verse is almost unintelligible to me. I give, however, the various attempts that have been made to explain it.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wilson</span>: This is that praise, Maruts, which, suited (to your merits), glorifies every one of you. The speech of the priest has now glorified you, without difficulty, with sacred verses, since (you have placed) food in our hands.</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Benfey</span>: Dies Lied&#8212;Maruts!&#8212;das hinter euch emporstrebt, es klingt zur&uuml;ck gleich eines Beters Stimme. M&uuml;hlos schuf solche Lieder er, entsprechend eurer Arme Kraft. (Note: Der zum Himmel schallende Lobgesang findet seinen Widerhall (wirklich, 'bebt zur&uuml;ck') in dem Sturmgeheul</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></A></p>  
<p>der Maruts, welches mit dem Geheul des Betenden verglichen wird.)</p>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ludwig</span>: Dises lied, o Marut, euch unterst&uuml;tzend (aufnemend) als eines priesters braust euch entgegen, nachbrausen hat es gemacht ohne m&uuml;he in (die) der n&auml;he die g&ouml;ttliche weise (ihrer) arme.</p>  
<p>My own translation is to a great extent conjectural. It seems to me from verse 3, that the poet offers both a hymn of praise and a libation of Soma. Possibly v&acirc;rk&acirc;ry&acirc; in verse 4 might be taken in the sense of Soma-juice, and be derived from valkala, which in later Sanskrit means the bark of trees. In that case verse 5 would again refer to the hymn of Gotama, and verse 6 to the libation which is to accompany it. Anu-bhartr&icirc;&acute; does not occur again, but it can only mean what supports or refreshes, and therefore would be applicable to a libation of Soma which supports the gods. The verb stobhati would well express the rushing sound of the Soma, as in I, 168, 8, it expresses the rushing noise of the waters against the fellies of the chariots. The next line adds little beyond stating that this libation of Soma rushes forth freely from the hands, the gabhastis being specially mentioned in other passages where the crushing of the Soma-plant is described:</p>  
<p>IX, 71, 3. &aacute;dri-bhi<I>h</I> sut&aacute;<I>h</I> pavate g&aacute;bhastyo<I>h</I>.</p>  
<p>The Soma squeezed by the stones runs from the hands.</p>  
<p>The translation would then be: O Maruts, this comforting draught (of Soma) rushes towards you, like the speech of a suppliant; it rushed freely from our hands, as our draughts (of Soma) are wont to do.</p>
