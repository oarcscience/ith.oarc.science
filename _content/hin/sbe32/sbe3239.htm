<p>1. O Rudras, joined by Indra, friends on golden chariots, come hither for our welfare! This prayer from us is acceptable to you like the springs of heaven to a thirsty soul longing for water.</p>  
<p>2. O you sons of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni, you are armed with daggers and spears, you are wise, carrying good bows and arrows and quivers, possessed of good horses and chariots. With your good weapons, O Maruts, you go to triumph!</p>  
<p>3. You shake <A HREF="sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:3:1">1</A> the sky and the mountains (clouds) for wealth to the liberal giver; the forests bend down out of your way from fear <A HREF="sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:3:2">2</A>. O sons of P<I>ri</I><I>s</I>ni, you rouse the earth when you, O terrible ones, have harnessed the spotted deer for triumph!</p>  
<p>4. The Maruts, blazing with the wind, clothed in rain, are as like one another as twins, and well adorned. They have tawny horses, and red horses, they are faultless, endowed with exceeding vigour; they are in greatness wide as the heaven.</p>  
<p>5. Rich in rain-drops, well adorned, bounteous, terrible to behold, of inexhaustible wealth, noble by birth, golden-breasted, these singers of the sky <A HREF="sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:5:1">1</A> have obtained their immortal name <A HREF="sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:5:2">2</A>.</p>  
<p>6. Spears are on your two shoulders, in your arms are placed strength, power, and might. Manly thoughts dwell in your heads, on your chariots are weapons, and every beauty has been laid on your bodies.</p>  
<p><a name="page_341"><font size="1" color="green">p. 341</font></A></p>  
<p>7. O Maruts, you have given us wealth of cows, horses, chariots, and heroes, golden wealth! O men of Rudra, bestow on us great praise, and may I enjoy your divine protection!</p>  
<p>8. Hark, O heroes, O Maruts! Be gracious to us! You who are of great bounty, immortal, righteous, truly listening to us, poets, young, dwelling on mighty mountains <A HREF="sbe3239.htm#an_5:57:8:1">1</A>, and grown mighty.</p>  
<p><a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="green">p. 342</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">NOTES.</h4>  
<p>The same poet and deity. Metre, 1-6 Gagat&icirc;; 7, 8 Trish<I>t</I>ubh. None of its verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS.; verse 6 in MS. IV, II, 4.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 3.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:57:3:1">1</A>. Dh&ucirc; is construed with two accusatives, see RV. III, 45, 4; otherwise v&acirc;su might be connected with d&acirc;<I>s</I>&uacute;she. The third p&acirc;da is 3 literally repeated soon after, V, 60, 2; see note 1 to I, 37, 7.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:57:3:2">2</A>. Y&acirc;&acute;mana<I>h</I> bhiy&acirc;&acute; may be from fear of your approach.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 5.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:57:5:1">1</A>. In div&aacute;<I>h</I> ark&acirc;&acute;<I>h</I> even Bergaigne allows that ark&aacute; may mean singer, not song.</p>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:57:5:2">2</A>. N&acirc;&acute;ma, name, is here as elsewhere what is meant by the name, therefore immortal being or immortality.</p>  <h5 align="center">Verse 8.</h5>  
<p>Note <A NAME="an_5:57:8:1">1</A>. B<I>r&iacute;</I>hadgiraya<I>h</I> cannot well mean with a powerful voice. The Maruts are called girish<I>th</I>a, VIII, 94, 12, dwelling on mountains, and like b<I>ri</I>haddiva, b<I>ri</I>hadgiri seems to have been intended for dwelling on high mountains.</p>
