### MA*ND*ALA V, HYMN 56.

#### ASH*T*AKA IV, ADHYÂYA 3, VARGA 19-20.

#### <span class="smallcaps">To the Maruts (the Storm-gods)</span>.

1\. O Agni, on to the strong host (of the Maruts), bedecked with golden
chains and ornaments [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:1:1). Today I call the folk
of the Maruts down from the light of heaven.

2\. As thou (Agni) thinkest in thine heart, to the same object my wishes
have gone. Strengthen thou these Maruts, terrible to behold, who have
come nearest to thy invocations.

3\. Like a bountiful lady [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:3:1), the earth comes
towards us, staggering, yet rejoicing; for your onslaught, O Maruts, is
vigorous, like a bear, and fearful, like a wild bull.

4\. They who by their strength disperse wildly
[1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:4:1) like bulls, impatient of the yoke, they by
their marches make the heavenly stone, the rocky mountain (cloud)
[2](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:4:2) to shake.

5\. Arise, for now I call with my hymns [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:5:1) the
troop of these Maruts, grown strong together, the manifold, the
incomparable, as if calling a drove of bulls.

6\. Harness the red mares to the chariot, harness the ruddy horses to
the chariots, harness the two bays, ready to drive in the yoke, most
vehement to drive in the yoke.

7\. And this red stallion too, loudly neighing, has been placed here,
beautiful to behold; may it not cause you delay on your marches, O
Maruts; spur him forth on your chariots.

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

8\. We call towards us the glorious chariot of the Maruts, whereon there
stands also Rodasî [1](sbe3238.htm#an_5:56:8:1), carrying delightful
gifts, among the Maruts.

9\. I call hither this your host, brilliant on chariots, terrible and
glorious, among which she, the wellborn and fortunate, the bounteous
lady, is also magnified among the Maruts.

#### NOTES.

The same poet and deity, though Agni is invoked in the first, possibly
in the second verse also. Metre, 1, 2, 4-6, 8, 9 B*ri*hatî; 3, 7
Satob*ri*hatî. None of the verses occurs in SV., VS., AV., TS., MS.

##### Verse 1.

Note <span id="an_5:56:1:1">1</span>. Here again some interpreters of
the Veda take a*ñg*i in the sense of paint, war-paint. It may be so, but
the more general meaning of colours or ornament seems, as yet, safer.

##### Verse 3.

Note <span id="an_5:56:3:1">1</span>. The earth is frequently
represented as trembling under the fury of the Maruts. Here she is first
called mî*lh*úshmatî, a curious compound which, in our verse, may
possibly have a more special meaning. As the earth is not only struck
down by the storm, but at the same time covered with water and
fertilised, she is represented as struck down and staggering, but
likewise as rejoicing, possibly, as drunk.

##### Verse 4.

Note <span id="an_5:56:4:1">1</span>. V*rí*thâ means pell-mell,
confusedly, wildly; see also Geldner, Ved. Stud. p. 115.

Note <span id="an_5:56:4:2">2</span>. Á*s*mâ svaryã*h* seems to mean the
thunderbolt like vá*g*ra*h* svaryã*h* in I, 32, 2; 67, 6. See also V,
30, 8. In that case we should have to translate, 'they let the heavenly
bolt fall down on the rocky mountain.' But *k*yâvayati is never used for
the hurling of the thunderbolt, nor is it construed with two
accusatives. It always means to shake what is firm, and we have
therefore to translate, they shake the heavenly stone (the sky), the
rocky mountain (the cloud).' Parvata and giri often occur together, as
in I, 37, 7; VIII, 64, 5.

##### Verse 5.

Note <span id="an_5:56:5:1">1</span>. Stómai*h* may possibly refer to
sámukshitânâm.

##### Verse 8.

Note <span id="an_5:56:8:1">1</span>. On Rodasî´, see before, I, 167, 3.
