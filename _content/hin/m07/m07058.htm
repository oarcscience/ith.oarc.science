<p>"Narada said, 'Dilipa, the son of Havila, too, O Srinjaya, we hear, fell a prey to death. Brahmanas, vested in knowledge of Truth, devoted to the performance of sacrifices, blessed with children and children's children and numbering myriads upon myriads, were present at his hundreds of sacrifices. King Dilipa, having performed various sacrifices, gave away this earth, filled with treasures, unto the Brahmanas. At the sacrifices of Dilipa, the roads were all made of gold.

In the abode of Dilipa, called also Khattanga, these five sounds were always to be heard, <i>viz</i>., the sound of <i>Vedic</i> recitations, the twang of bows, and <i>Drink</i>, <i>Enjoy</i>, and <i>Eat</i>! When he died, O Srinjaya, who was superior to thee in respect of the four cardinal virtues and who superior to thee, was much superior to thy son, thou shouldst not, saying, '<i>Oh, Swaitya, Oh, Swaitya</i>,' grieve for thy son who performed no sacrifice and made no sacrificial gifts.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
