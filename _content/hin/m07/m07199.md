Brahmana (Drona) endued with great strength, fell and repaired to the
region of Brahma. The fruits that arise from a study of the *Vedas*
arise from a study of this *Parva* also. The great achievements of brave

recitation of this *Parva* every day is freed from heinous sins and the
most atrocious acts of his life. Brahmanas may always obtain herefrom

of sacrifices. From this, Kshatriyas may obtain victory in fierce

and grandsons and all objects of desire!'"

*The end of Drona Parva*.
