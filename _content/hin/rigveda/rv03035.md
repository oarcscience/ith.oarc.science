### HYMN XXXV Indra.

1\. MOUNT the Bay Horses to thy chariot harnessed, and come to us like
Vāyu with his coursers.  
Thou, hastening to us, shalt drink the Soma. Hail, Indra. We have poured
it for thy rapture.  
2 For him, the God who is invoked by many, the two swift Bay Steeds to
the pole I harness,  
That they in fleet course may bring Indra hither, e’en to this sacrifice
arranged completely.  
3 Bring the strong Steeds who drink the warm libation, and, Bull of
Godlike nature, be thou gracious.  
Let thy Steeds eat; set free thy Tawny Horses, and roasted grain like
this consume thou daily.  
4 Those who are yoked by prayer I harness, fleet friendly Bays who take
their joy together.  
Mounting thy firm and easy car, O Indra, wise and all-knowing come thou
to the Soma.  
5 No other worshippers must stay beside them thy Bays, thy vigorous and
smooth-backed Coursers.  
Pass by them all and hasten onward hither: with Soma pressed we will
prepare to feast thee.  
6 Thine is this Soma: hasten to approach it. Drink thou thereof,
benevolent, and cease not.  
Sit on the sacred grass at this our worship, and take these drops into
thy belly, Indra.  
7 The grass is strewn for thee, pressed is the Soma; the grain is ready
for thy Bays to feed on.  
To thee who lovest them, the very mighty, strong, girt by Maruts, are
these gifts presented.  
8 This the sweet draught, with cows, the men, the mountains, the waters,
Indra, have for thee made ready.  
Come, drink thereof, Sublime One, friendly-minded, foreseeing, knowing
well the ways thou goest.  
9 The Maruts, they with whom thou sharedst Soma, Indra, who made thee
strong and were thine army,—  
With these accordant, eagerly desirous drink thou this Soma with the
tongue of Agni.  
10 Drink, Indra, of the juice by thine own nature, or by the tongue of
Agni, O thou Holy.  
Accept the sacrificial gift, O Śakra, from the Adhvaryu's hand or from
the Hotar's.  
11 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where
spoil is gathered,  
The Strong, who listens, who.gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
