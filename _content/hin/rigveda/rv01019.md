### HYMN XIX. Agni, Maruts.

1 To this fair sacrifice to drink the milky draught thou art invoked:  
O Agni, with the Maruts come.  
2 No mortal man, no God exceeds thy mental power, O Mighty one:  
O Agni, with the Maruts come:  
3 All Gods devoid of guile, who know the mighty region of mid-air:  
O Agni, with those Maruts come.  
4 The terrible, who sing their song, not to be overcome by might:  
O Agni, with those Maruts come.  
5 Brilliant, and awful in their form, mighty, devourers of their foes:  
O Agni, with those Maruts come.  
6 Who sit as Deities in heaven, above the sky-vault's luminous sphere:  
O Agni, with those Maruts come.  
7 Who scatter clouds about the sky, away over the billowy sea:  
O Agni, with those Maruts come.  
8 Who with their bright beams spread them forth over the ocean in their
might  
O Agni, with those Maruts come.  
9 For thee, to be thine early draught, I pour the Soma-mingled meath:  
O Agni, with the Maruts come.
