### HYMN LXX. Aśvins.

1\. RICH in all blessings, Aśvins come ye hither: this place on earth is
called your own possession,  
Like a strong horse with a fair back it standeth, whereon, as in a lap,
ye seat you firmly.  
2 This most delightful eulogy awaits you in the man's house
drink-offering hath been heated,  
Which bringeth you over the seas and rivers, yoking as’twere two
well-matched shining horses.  
3 Whatever dwellings ye possess, O Aśvins, in fields of men or in the
streams of heaven,  
Resting upon the summit of the mountain, or bringing food to him who
gives oblation,  
4 Delight yourselves, ye Gods, in plants and waters when Ṛṣis give them
and ye find they suit You.  
Enriching us with treasures in abundance ye have looked back to former
generations.  
5 Aśvins, though ye have heard them oft aforetime, regard the many
prayers which Ṛṣis offer.  
Come to the man even as his heart desireth: may we enjoy your most
delightful favour.  
6 Come to the sacrifice offered you, Nāsatyas, with men, oblations, and
prayer duly uttered.  
Come to Vasiṣṭha as his heart desireth, for unto you these holy hymns
are chanted.  
7 This is the thought, this is the song, O Aśvins: accept this hymn of
ours, ye Steers, with favour.  
May these our prayers addressed to you come nigh you. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
