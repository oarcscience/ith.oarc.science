### HYMN II. Agni.

1\. GLADDEN the yearning Gods, O thou Most Youthful: bring them, O Lord
of Seasons, knowing seasons,  
With all the Priests Celestial, O Agni. Best worshipper art thou of all
Invokers.  
2 Thine is the Herald's, thine the Cleanser's office, thinker art thou,
wealth-giver, true to Order.  
Let us with Svāhā offer up oblations, and Agni, worthy God, pay the Gods
worship.  
3 To the Gods’ pathway have we travelled, ready to execute what work we
may accomplish.  
Let Agni, for he knows, complete the worship. He is the Priest: let him
fix rites and seasons.  
4 When we most ignorant neglect the statutes of you, O Deities with whom
is knowledge,  
Wise Agni shall correct our faults and failings, skilled to assign each
God his fitting season.  
5 When, weak in mind, of feeble understanding, mortals bethink them not
of sacrificing,  
Then shall the prudent and discerning Agni worship the Gods, best
worshipper, in season.  
6 Because the Father hath produced thee, Leader of all our solemn rites,
their brilliant Banner:  
So win by worship pleasant homes abounding in heroes, and rich food to
nourish all men.  
7 Thou whom the Heaven and Earth, thou whom the Waters, and Tvaṣṭar,
maker of fair things, created,  
Well knowing, all along the Fathers' pathway, shine with resplendent
light, enkindled, Agni.
