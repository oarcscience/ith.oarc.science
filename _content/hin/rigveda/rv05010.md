### HYMN X. Agni.

1\. BRING us most mighty splendour thou, Agni, resistless on thy way.  
With overflowing store of wealth mark out for us a path to strength.  
2 Ours art thou, wondrous Agni, by wisdom and bounteousness of power.  
The might of Asuras rests on thee, like Mitra worshipful in act.  
3 Agni, increase our means of life, increase the house and home of
these,  
The men, the princes who have won great riches through our hymns of
praise.  
4 Bright Agni, they who deck their songs for thee have horses as their
meed.  
The men are mighty in their might, they whose high laud, as that of
heaven, awakes thee of its own accord.  
5 O Agni, those resplendent flames of thine go valorously forth,  
Like lightnings flashing round us, like a rattling car that seeks the
spoil.  
6 Now, Agni, come to succour us; let priests draw nigh to offer gifts;  
And let the patrons of our rites subdue all regions of the earth.  
7 Bring to us, Agni, Aṅgiras, lauded of old and lauded now,  
Invoker! wealth to quell the strong, that singers may extol thee. Be
near us in fight for our success.
