Heritage

### HYMN XLIII. Rudra.

1 WHAT shall we sing to Rudra, strong, most bounteous, excellently
wise,  
That shall be dearest to his heart?  
2 That Aditi may grant the grace of Rudra to our folk, our kine,  
Our cattle and our progeny;  
3 That Mitra and that Varuṇa, that Rudra may remember us,  
Yea, all the Gods with one accord.  
4 To Rudra Lord of sacrifice, of hymns and balmy medicines,  
We pray for joy and health and strength.  
5 He shines in splendour like the Sun, refulgent as bright gold is he,  
The good, the best among the Gods.  
6 May he grant health into our steeds, wellbeing to our rams and ewes,  
To men, to women, and to kine.  
7 O Soma, set thou upon us the glory of a hundred men,  
The great renown of mighty chiefs.  
8 Let not malignities, nor those who trouble Soma, hinder us.  
Indu, give us a share of strength.  
9 Soma! head, central point, love these; Soma! know these as serving
thee,  
Children of thee Immortal, at the highest place of holy law.
