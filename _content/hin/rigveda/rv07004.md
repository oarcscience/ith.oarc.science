### HYMN IV. Agni.

1\. BRING forth your gifts to his refulgent splendour, your hymn as
purest offering to Agni,  
To him who goes as messenger with knowledge between all songs of men and
Gods in heaven.  
2 Wise must this Agni be, though young and tender, since he was born,
Most Youthful, of his Mother;  
He who with bright teeth seizeth fast the forests, and eats his food,
though plenteous, in a moment.  
3 Before his presence must we all assemble, this God's whom men have
seized in his white splendour.  
This Agni who hath brooked that men should seize him hath shone for man
with glow insufferable.  
4 Far-seeing hath this Agni been established, deathless mid mortals,
wise among the foolish.  
Here, O victorious God, forbear to harm us: may weforever share thy
gracious favour.  
5 He who hath occupied his God-made dwelling, Agni, in wisdom hath
surpassed Immortals.  
A Babe unborn, the plants and trees support him, and the earth beareth
him the All-sustainer.  
6 Agni is Lord of Amṛta. in abundance, Lord of the gift of wealth and
hero valour,  
Victorious God, let us not sit about thee like men devoid of strength,
beauty, and worship.  
7 The foeman's treasure may be won with labour: may we be masters of our
own possessions.  
Agni, no son is he who springs from others: lengthen not out the
pathways of the foolish.  
8 Unwelcome for adoption is the stranger, one to be thought of as
another's offipring,  
Though grown familiar by continual presence. May our strong hero come,
freshly triumphant.  
9 Guard us from him who would assail us, Agni; preserve us O thou
Victor, from dishonour.  
Here let the place of darkening come upon thee: may wealth be ours,
desirable, in thousands.  
10 Shine this felicity on us, O Agni: may we attain to perfect
understanding.  
All happiness be theirs who sing and praise thee. Ye Gods, preserve us
evermore with blessings.
