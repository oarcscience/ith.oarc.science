### HYMN XXXIX Soma Pavamana.

1\. FLOW On, O thou of lofty thought, flow swift in thy beloved form,  
Saying, I go where dwell the Gods.  
2 Preparing what is unprepared, and bringing store of food to man,  
Make thou the rain descend from heaven.  
3 With might, bestowing power, thejuice enters the purifying sieve,  
Far-seeing, sending forth its light.  
4 This is it which in rapid course hath with the river's wave flowed
down  
From heaven upon the straining cloth.  
5 Inviting him frorh far away, and even from near at hand, the juice  
For Indra is poured forth as meath.  
6 In union they have sung the hymn: with stones they urge the Tawny
One.  
Sit in the place of sacrifice.
