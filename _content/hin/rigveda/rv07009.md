### HYMN IX. Agni.

1\. ROUSED from their bosom is the Dawns' beloved, the joyous Priest,
most sapient, Purifier.  
He gives a signal both to Gods and mortals, to Gods oblations, riches to
the pious.  
2 Most wise is he who, forcing doors of Paṇis, brought the bright Sun to
us who feedeth many.  
The cheerful Priest, men's Friend and home-companion, through still
night's darkness he is made apparent.  
3 Wise, ne.'er deceived, uncircumscribed, refulgent, our gracious guest,
a Friend with good attendants,  
Shines forth with wondrous light before the Mornings; the young plants
hath he entered, Child of Waters.  
4 Seeking our gatherings, he, your Jātavedas, hath shone adorable
through human ages,  
Who gleams refulgent with his lovely lustre: the kine have waked to meet
him when enkindled.  
5 Go on thy message to the Gods, and fail not, O Agni, with their band
who pray and worship.  
Bring all the Gods that they may give us riches, Sarasvatī, the Maruts,
Aśvins, Waters.  
6 Vasiṣṭha, when enkindling thee, O Agni, hath slain jarutha. Give us
wealth in plenty.  
Sing praise in choral song, O Jātavedas. Ye Gods, preserve us evermore
with blessings.
