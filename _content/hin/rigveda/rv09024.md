### HYMN XXIVṢoma Pavamana.

1\. HITHERWARD have the Soma streamed,  
the drops while they are purified:  
When bIent, in waters they are rinsed.  
2 The milk hath run to meet them like floods rushing down a precipice:  
They come to Indra, being cleansed.  
3 O Soma Pavamana, thou art flowing to be Indra's drink:  
The men have seized and lead thee forth.  
4 Victorious, to be hailed with joy, O Soma, flow, delighting men,  
To him who ruleth o’er mankind.  
5 Thou, Indu, when, effused by stones, thou runnest to the filter,
art,  
Ready for Indra's high decree.  
6 Flow on, best Vṛtra-slayer; flow meet to be hailed with joyful
lauds.  
Pure, purifying, wonderful.  
7 Pure, purifying is he called the Soma of the meath eflused,  
Slayer of sinners, dear to Gods.
