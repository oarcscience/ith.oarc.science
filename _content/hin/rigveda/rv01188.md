### HYMN CLXXXVIII. Āprīs.

1\. WINNER of thousands, kindled, thou shinest a God with Gods to-day.  
Bear out oblations, envoy, Sage.  
2 Child of Thyself the sacrifice is for the righteous blent with
meath,  
Presenting viands thousandfold.  
3 Invoked and worthy of our praise bring Gods whose due is sacrifice:  
Thou, Agni, givest countless gifts.  
4 To seat a thousand Heroes they eastward have strewn the grass with
might,  
Whereon, Ādityas, ye shine forth.  
5 The sovran all-imperial Doors, wide, good, many and manifold,  
Have poured their streams of holy oil.  
6 With gay adornment, fair to see, in glorious beauty shine they
forth:  
Let Night and Morning rest them here.  
7 Let these two Sages first of all, heralds divine and eloquent,  
Perform for us this sacrifice.  
8 You I address, Sarasvatī, and Bhāratī, and Iḷā, all:  
Urge ye us on to glorious fame.  
9 Tvaṣṭar the Lord hath made all forms and all the cattle of the field  
Cause them to multiply for us.  
10 Send to the Gods, Vanaspati, thyself, the sacrificial draught:  
Let Agni make the oblations sweet.  
11 Agni, preceder of the Gods, is honoured with the sacred song:  
He glows at offerings blest with Hail!
