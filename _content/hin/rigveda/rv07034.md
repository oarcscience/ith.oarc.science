### HYMN XXXIV Viśvedevas.

1\. MAY our divine and brilliant hymn go forth, like a swift chariot
wrought and fashioned well.  
2 The waters listen as they flow along: they know the origin of heaven
and earth.  
3 Yea, the broad waters swell their flood ior him: of him strong heroes
think amid their foes.  
4 Set ye for him the coursers to the pole: like Indra Thunderer is the
Golden-armed.  
5 Arouse you, like the days, to sacrifice speed gladly like a traveller
on the way.  
6 Go swift to battles, to the sacrifice: set up a flag, a hero for the
folk.  
7 Up from his strength hath risen as ’twere a light: it bears the load
as earth bears living things.  
8 Agni, no demon I invoke the Gods: by law completing it, I form a
hymn.  
9 Closely albout you lay your heavenly song, and send your voice to
where the Gods abide.  
10 Varuṇa, Mighty, with a thousand eyes, beholds the paths wherein these
rivers run.  
11 He, King of kings, the glory of the floods, o’er all that liveth hath
resistless sway.  
12 May he assist us among all the tribes, and make the envier's praise
devoid of light.  
13 May the foes' threatening arrow pass us by: may he put far from us
our bodies' sin.  
14 Agni, oblation-cater, through our prayers aid us: to him our dearest
laud is brought.  
15 Accordant with the Gods choose for our Friend the Waters’ Child: may
he be good to us.  
16 With lauds I sing the Dragon born of floods: he sits beneath the
streams in middle air.  
17 Ne’er may the Dragon of the Deep harm us: ne’er fail this faithful
servant's sacrifice.  
18 To these our heroes may they grant renown: may pious men march boldly
on to wealth.  
19 Leading great hosts, with fierce attacks of these, they burn their
foes as the Sun burns the earth.  
20 What time our wives draw near to us, may he, left-handed Tvaṣṭar,
give us hero sons.  
21 May Tvaṣṭar find our hymn acceptable, and may Aramati, seeking
wealth, be ours.  
22 May they who lavish gifts bestow those treasures: may Rodasī and
Varuṇānī listen.  
May he, with the Varūtrīs, be our refuge, may bountiful Tvaṣṭar give us
store of riches.  
23 So may rich Mountains and the liberal Waters, so may all Herbs that
grow on ground, and Heaven,  
And Earth accordant with the Forest-Sovrans, and both the World-halves
round about protect us.  
24 To this may both the wide Worlds lend approval, and Varuṇa in heaven,
whose Friend is Indra.  
May all the Maruts give consent, the Victors, that we may hold great
wealth in firm possession.  
25 May Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni, Waters, Herbs, Trees accept the
praise we offer.  
May we find refuge in the Marut's bosom. Protect us evermore, ye Gods,
with blessings.
