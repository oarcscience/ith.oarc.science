### HYMN LVII. Viśvedevas.

1\. MY thought with fine discernment hath discovered the Cow who wanders
free without a herdsman,  
Her who hath straightway poured me food in plenty: Indra and Agni
therefore are her praisers.  
2 Indra and Pūṣan, deft of hand and mighty, well-pleased have drained
the heaven's exhaustless udder.  
As in this praise the Gods have all delighted, may I win blessing here
from you, O Vasus.  
3 Fain to lend vigour to the Bull, the siste.. with reverence recognize
the germ within him.  
The Cows come lowing hither to the Youngling, to him endued with great
and wondrous beauties.  
4 Fixing with thought, at sacrifice, the press-stones, I bid the
well-formed Heaven and Earth come hither;  
For these thy flames, which give men boons in plenty, rise up on high,
the beautiful, the holy.  
5 Agni, thy meath-sweet tongue that tastes fair viands, which among Gods
is called the far-extended,—  
Therewith make all the Holy Odes be seated here for our help, and feed
them with sweet juices.  
6 Let thy stream give us drink, O God, O Agni, wonderful and exhaustless
like the rain-clouds.  
Thus care for us, O Vasu Jātavedas, show us thy loving-kindness,
reaching all men.
