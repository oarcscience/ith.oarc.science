Heritage

### HYMN XL. Indra.

1\. THEE, Indra, we invoke, the Bull, what time the Soma is expressed.  
So drink thou of the savoury juice.  
2 Indra, whom many laud, accept the strength-conferring Soma juice:  
Quaff, pour down drink that satisfies.  
3 Indra, with all the Gods promote our wealth-bestowing sacrifice,  
Thou highly-lauded Lord of men.  
4 Lord of the brave, to thee proceed these drops of Soma juice
expressed,  
The bright drops to thy dwelling-place.  
5 Within thy belly, Indra, take juice, Soma the most excellent: Thine
are the drops celestial.  
6 Drink our libation, Lord of hymns: with streams of meath thou art
bedewed  
Our glory, Indra, is thy gift.  
7 To Indra go the treasures of the worshipper, which never fail:  
He drinks the Soma and is strong  
8 From far away, from near at hand, O Vṛtra-slayer, come to us:  
Accept the songs we sing to thee.  
9 When from the space between the near and far thou art invoked by us,  
Thence, Indra. come thou hitherward.
