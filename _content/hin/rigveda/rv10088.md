### HYMN LXXXVIII. Agni.

1\. DEAR, ageless sacrificial drink is offered in light-discovering,
heaven-pervading Agni.  
The Gods spread forth through his Celestial Nature, that he might bear
the world up and sustain it.  
2 The world was swallowed and concealed in darkness: Agni was born, and
light became apparent.  
The Deities, the broad earth, and the heavens, and plants, and waters
gloried in his friendship.  
3 Inspired by Gods who claim our adoration, I now will laud Eternal
Lofty Agni,  
Him who hath spread abroad the earth with lustre, this heaven, and both
the worlds, and air's mid-region.  
4 Earliest Priest whom all the Gods accepted, and chose him, and
anointed him with butter,  
He swiftly made all things that fly, stand, travel, all that hath
motion, Agni Jātavedas.  
5 Because thou, Agni, Jātavedas, stoodest at the world's head with thy
refulgent splendour,  
We sent thee forth with hymns and songs and praises: thou filledst
heaven and earth, God meet for worship.  
6 Head of the world is Agni in the night-time; then, as the Sun, at morn
springs up and rises.  
Then to his task goes the prompt Priest foreknowing the wondrous power
of Gods who must be honoured.  
7 Lovely is he who, kindled in his greatness, hath shone forth, seated
in the heavens, refulgent.  
With resonant hymns all Gods who guard our bodies have offered up
oblation in this Agni.  
8 First the Gods brought the hymnal into being; then they engendered
Agni, then oblation.  
He was their sacrifice that guards our bodies: him the heavens know, the
earth, the waters know him.  
9 He, Agni, whom the Gods have generated, in whom they offered up all
worlds and creatures,  
He with his bright glow heated earth and heaven, urging himself right
onward in his grandeur.  
10 Then by the laud the Gods engendered Agni in heaven, who fills both
worlds through strength and vigour.  
They made him to appear in threefold essence: he ripens plants of every
form and nature.  
11 What time the Gods, whose due is worship, set him as Sūrya, Son of
Aditi, in heaven,  
When the Pair, ever wandering, sprang to being, all creatures that
existed looked upon them.  
12 For all the world of life the Gods made Agni Vaiśvānara to be the
days' bright Banner,—  
Him who hath spread abroad the radiant Mornings, and, coming with his
light, unveils the darkness.  
13 The wise and holy Deities engendered Agni Vaiśvānara whom age ne’er
touches.  
The Ancient Star that wanders on for ever, lofty and. strong, Lord of
the Living Being.  
14 We call upon the Sage with holy verses, Agni Vaiśvānara the
ever-beaming,  
Who hath surpassed both heaven and earth in greatness: he is a God
below, a God above us.  
15 I have heard mention of two several pathways, ways of the Fathers and
of Gods and mortals.  
On these two paths each moving creature travels, each thing between the
Father and the Mother.  
16 These two united paths bear him who journeys born from the head and
pondered with the spirit  
He stands directed to all things existing, hasting, unresting in his
fiery splendour.  
17 Which of us twain knows where they speak together, upper and lower of
the two rite-leaders?  
Our friends have helped to gather our assembly. They came to sacrifice;
who will announce it?  
18 How many are the Fires and Suns in number? What is the number of the
Dawns and Waters?  
Not jestingly I speak to you, O Fathers. Sages, I ask you this for
information.  
19 As great as is the fair-winged Morning's presence to him who dwells
beside us, Mātariśvan!  
Is what the Brahman does when he approaches to sacrifice and sits below
the Hotar.
