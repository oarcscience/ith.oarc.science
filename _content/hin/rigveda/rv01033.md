### HYMN XXXIII. Indra.

1 Come, fain for booty let us seek to Indra: yet more shall he increase
his care that guides us.  
Will not the Indestructible endow us with perfect knowledge of this
wealth, of cattle?  
2 I fly to him invisible Wealth-giver as flies the falcon to his
cherished eyrie,  
With fairest hymns of praise adoring Indra, whom those who laud him must
invoke in battle.  
3 Mid all his host, he bindeth on the quiver: he driveth cattle from
what foe he pleaseth:  
Gathering up great store of riches, Indra. be thou no trafficker with
us, most mighty.  
4 Thou slewest with thy bolt the wealthy Dasyu, alone, yet going with
thy helpers, Indra!  
Far from the floor of heaven in all directions, the ancient riteless
ones fled to destruction.  
5 Fighting with pious worshippers, the riteless turned and fled, Indra!
with averted faces.  
When thou, fierce Lord of the Bay Steeds, the Stayer, blewest from earth
and heaven and sky the godless.  
6 They met in fight the army of the blameless: then the Navagvas put
forth all their power.  
They, like emasculates with men contending, fled, conscious, by steep
paths from Indra, scattered.  
7 Whether they weep or laugh, thou hast o’erthrown them, O Indra, on the
sky's extremest limit.  
The Dasyu thou hast burned from heaven, and welcomed the prayer of him
who pours the juice and lauds thee.  
8 Adorned with their array of gold and jewels, they o’er the earth a
covering veil extended.  
Although they hastened, they o’ercame not Indra: their spies he
compassed with the Sun of morning.  
9 As thou enjoyest heaven and earth, O Indra, on every side surrounded
with thy greatness,  
So thou with priests hast blown away the Dasyu, and those who worship
not with those who worship.  
10 They who pervaded earth's extremest limit subdued not with their
charms the Wealth-bestower:  
Indra, the Bull, made his ally the thunder, and with its light milked
cows from out the darkness.  
11 The waters flowed according to their nature; he raid the navigable
streams waxed mighty.  
Then Indra, with his spirit concentrated, smote him for ever with his
strongest weapon.  
12 Indra broke through Ilībiśa's strong castles, and Śuṣṇa with his horn
he cut to pieces:  
Thou, Maghavan, for all his might and swiftness, slewest thy fighting
foeman with thy thunder  
13 Fierce on his enemies fell Indra's weapon: with. his sharp bull he
rent their forts in pieces.  
He with his thunderbolt dealt blows on Vṛtra; and conquered, executing
all his purpose.  
14 Indra, thou helpest Kutsa whom thou lovedst, and guardedst brave
Daśadyu when he battled,  
The dust of trampling horses rose to heaven, and Śvitrā's son stood up
again for conquest.  
15 Śvitrā's mild steer, O Maghavan thou helpest in combat for the land,
mid Tugra's houses.  
Long stood they there before the task was ended: thou wast the master of
the foemen's treasure.
