### HYMN LXXXVI. Varuṇa.

1\. WISE, verily, are creatures through his greatness who stayed ever,
spacious heaven and earth asunder;  
Who urged the high and mighty sky to motion, the Star of old, and spread
the earth before him.  
2 With mine own heart I commune on the question how Varuṇa and I may be
united.  
What gift of mine will he accept unangered? When may I calmly look and
find him gracious?  
3 Fain to know this is my sin I question others: I seek the wise, O
Varuṇa, and ask them.  
This one same answer even the sages gave me, "Surely this Varuṇa is
angry with thee."  
4 What, Varuṇa, hath been my chief transgression, that thou wouldst slay
the friend who sings thy praises?  
Tell me, Unconquerable Lord, and quickly sinless will I approach thee
with mine homage.  
5 Free us from sins committed by our fathers, from those wherein we have
ourselves offended.  
O King, loose, like a thief who feeds the cattle, as from the cord a
calf, set free Vasiṣṭha.  
6 Not our own will betrayed us, but seduction, thoughtlessness, Varuṇa
wine, dice, or anger.  
The old is near to lead astray the younger: even sleep removeth not all
evil-doing.  
7 Slavelike may I do service to the Bounteous, serve, free from sin, the
God inclined to anger.  
This gentle Lord gives wisdom to the simple: the wiser God leads on the
wise to riches.  
8 O Lord, O Varuṇa, may this laudation come close to thee and lie within
thy spirit.  
May it be well with us in rest and labour. Preserve us ever-more, ye
Gods, with blessings.
