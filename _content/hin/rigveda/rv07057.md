### HYMN LVII. Maruts.

1\. YEA, through the power of your sweet juice, ye Holy! the Marut host
is glad at sacrifices.  
They cause even spacious heaven and earth to tremble, they make the
spring flow when they come, the Mighty.  
2 The Maruts watch the man who sings their praises, promoters of the
thought of him who worships.  
Seat you on sacred grass in our assembly, this day, with friendly minds,
to share the banquet.  
3 No others gleam so brightly as these Maruts with their own forms,
their golden gauds, their weapons.  
With all adornments, decking earth and heaven, they heighten, for bright
show, their common splendour.  
4 Far from us be your blazing dart, O Maruts, when we, through human
frailty, sin against you.  
Let us not he exposed to that, ye Holy! May your most loving favour
still attend us.  
5 May even what we have done delight the Maruts, the blameless Ones, the
bright, the purifying.  
Further us, O ye Holy, with your kindness: advance us mightily that we
may prosper.  
6 And may the Maruts, praised by all their titles, Heroes, enjoy the
taste of our oblations.  
Give us of Amṛta for the sake of offspring: awake the excellent fair
stores of riches.  
7 Hither, ye Maruts, praised, with all your succours, with all felicity
come to our princes,  
Who, of themselves, a hundredfold increase us. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
