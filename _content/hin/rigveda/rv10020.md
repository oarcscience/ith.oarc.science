### HYMN XX. Agni.

1\. SEND unto us a good and happy mind.  
2 1 worship Agni, Youthfullest of Gods, resistless, Friend of laws;  
Under whose guard and heavenly light the Spotted seek the Mother's
breast:  
3 Whom with their mouth they magnify, bannered with flame and homed in
light.  
He glitters with his row of teeth.  
4 Kind, Furtherer of men, he comes, when he hath reached the ends of
heaven,  
Sage, giving splendour to the clouds.  
5 To taste man's offerings, he, the Strong, hath risen erect at
sacrifice:  
Fixing his dwelling he proceeds.  
6 Here are oblation, worship, rest: rapidly comes his furtherance.  
To sword-armed Agni come the Gods.  
7 With service for chief bliss I seek the Lord of Sacrifice, Agni,
whom  
They call the Living, Son of Cloud.  
8 Blest evermore be all the men who come from us, who magnify  
Agni with sacrificial gifts.  
9 The path he treads is black and white and red, and striped, and brown,
crimson, and glorious.  
His sire begat him bright with hues of gold.  
10 Thus with his thoughts, O Son of Strength, O Agni, hath Vimada,
accordant with the Immortals,  
Offered thee hymns, soliciting thy favour. Thou hast brought all food,
strength, a prosperous dwelling.
