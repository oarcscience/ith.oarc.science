### HYMN LXXIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THEY from the spouting drop have sounded at the rim: naves speed
together to the place of sacrifice.  
That Asura hath formed, to seize, three lofty heights. The ships of
truth have borne the pious man across.  
2 The strong Steers, gathering, have duly stirred themselves,and over
the stream's wave the friends sent forth the song.  
Engendering the hymn, with flowing streams of meath, Indra's dear body
have they caused to wax in strength.  
3 With sanctifying gear they sit around the song: their ancient Father
guards their holy work from harm.  
Varuṇa hath o’erspread the mighty sea of air. Sages had power to hold
him in sustaining floods.  
4 Sweet-tongued, exhaustless, they have sent their voices down
togetlier, in heaven's vault that pours a thousand streams.  
His wildly-restless warders never close an eye: in every place are found
the bonds that bind man last.  
5 O'er Sire and Mother they have roared in unison bright with the verse
of praise, burning up riteless men,  
Blowing away with supernatural might from earth and from the heavens the
swarthy skin which Indra hates.  
6 Those which, as guides of song and counsellors of speed, were
manifested from their ancient dwelling place,—  
From these the eyeless and the deaf have turned aside: the wicked travel
not the pathway of the Law.  
7 What time the filter with a thousand streams is stretched, the
thoughtful sages purify their song therein.  
Bright-coloured are their spies, vigorous, void of guile, excellent,
fair to see, beholders of mankind.  
8 Guardian of Law, most wise, he may not be deceived: three Purifiers
hath he set within his heart.  
With wisdom he beholds all creatures that exist: he drives into the pit
the hated riteliess ones.  
9 The thread of sacrifice spun in the cleansing sieve, on Varuṇa's
tongue-tip, by supernatural might,—  
This, by their striving, have the prudent ones attained: he who hath not
this power shall sink into the pit.
