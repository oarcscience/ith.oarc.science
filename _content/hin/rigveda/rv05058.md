### HYMN LVIII. Maruts.

1\. Now do I glorify their mighty cohort, the company of these the
youthful Maruts,  
Who ride impetuous on with rapid horses, and radiant in themselves, are
Lords of Amṛta.  
2 The mighty glittering band, arm-bound with bracelets, givers of bliss,
unmeasured in their greatness,  
With magical powers, bountiful, ever-roaring,—these, liberal Heroes,
venerate thou singer.  
3 This day may all your water-bringers, Maruts, they who impel the
falling rain, approach us.  
This fire, O Maruts, hath been duly kindled; let it find favour with
you, youthful Sages.  
4 Ye raise up for the folk an active ruler whom, Holy Ones! a Master's
hand hath fashioned.  
Ye send the fighter hand to hand, armmighty, and the brave hero, Maruts
with good horses.  
5 They spring forth more and more, strong in their glories, like days,
like spokes where none are last in order.  
Highest and mightiest are the Sons of Pṛśni. Firm to their own intention
cling the Maruts.  
6 When ye have hastened on with spotted coursers, O Maruts, on your cars
with strong-wrought fellies,  
The waters are disturbed, the woods are shattered. Let Dyaus the Red
Steer send his thunder downward.  
7 Even Earth hath spread herself wide at their coming, and they as
husbands have with power impregned her.  
They to the pole have yoked the winds for coursers: their sweat have
they made rain, these Sons of Rudra.  
8 Ho! Maruts, Heroes, skilled in Law, immortal, be gracious unto us, ye
rich in treasures,  
Ye hearers of the truth, ye sage and youthful, grown mighty, dwelling on
the lofty mountains.
