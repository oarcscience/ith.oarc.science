### HYMN XVI. Agni.

1\. WITH this my reverent hymn I call Agni for you, the Son of
Strength,  
Dear, wisest envoy, served with noble sacrifice, immortal messenger of
all.  
2 His two red horses, all-supporting, let him yoke: let him,
well-worshipped, urge them fast.  
Then hath the sacrifice good prayers and happy end, and heavenly gift of
wealth to men.  
3 The flame of him the Bountiful, the Much-invoked, hath mounted up,  
And his red-coloured smoke-clouds reach and touch the sky: the men are
kindling Agni well.  
4 Thee, thee Most Glorious One we make our messenger. Bring the Gods
hither to the feast.  
Give us, O Son of Strength, all food that fcedeth man: give that for
which we pray to thee.  
5 Thou, Agni, art the homestead's Lord, our Herald at the sacrifice.  
Lord of all boons, thou art the Cleanser and a Sage. Pay worship, and
enjoy the good.  
6 Give riches to the sacrificer, O Most Wise, for thou art he who
granteth wealth.  
Inspire with zeal each priest at this our solemn rite; all who are
skilled in singing praise.  
7 O Agni who art worshipped well, dear let our princes he to thee,  
Our wealthy patrons who are governors of men, who part, as gifts, their
stalls of kine.  
8 They in whose home, her hand bearing the sacred oil, Iḷā sits down
well-satisfied-  
Guard them, Victorious God, from slander and from harm. give us a refuge
famed afar.  
9 Do thou, a Priest with pleasant tongue, most wise, and very near to
us,  
Agni, bring riches hither to our liberal chiefs, and speed the oflering
of our gifts.  
10 They who bestow as bounty plenteous wealth of steeds, moved by desire
of great renown-  
Do thou with saving help preserve them from distress, Most Youthful!
with a hundred forts.  
11 The God who gives your wealth demands a full libation poured to
him.  
Pour ye it forth, then fill the vessel full again: then doth the God pay
heed to you.  
12 Him have the Gods appointed Priest of sacrifice, oblation-bearer,
passing wise.  
Agni gives wealth and valour to the worshipper, to folk who offer up
their gifts.
