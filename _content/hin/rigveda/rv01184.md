### HYMN CLXXXIV. Aśvins.

1\. LET us invoke you both this day and after the priest is here with
lauds when morn is breaking:  
Nāsatyas, wheresoe’er ye be, Heaven's Children, for him who is more
liberal than the godless.  
2 With us, ye Mighty, let yourselves be joyful, glad in our stream of
Soma slay the niggards.  
Graciously hear my hymns and invitations, marking, O Heroes, with your
cars my longing.  
3 Nāsatyas, Pūṣans, ye as Gods for glory arranged and set in order
Sūrya's bridal.  
Your giant steeds move on, sprung from the waters, like ancient times of
Varuṇa the Mighty.  
4 Your grace be with us, ye who love sweet juices: further the hymn sung
by the poet Māna,  
When men are joyful in your glorious actions, to win heroic strength, ye
Bounteous Givers.  
5 This praise was made, O liberal Lords, O Aśvins, for you with fair
adornment by the Mānas.  
Come to our house for us and for our children, rejoicing, O Nāsatyas, in
Agastya.  
6 We have passed o’er the limit of this darkness: our praise hath been
bestowed on you, O Aśvins.  
Come hitherward by paths which Gods have travelled. may we find
strengthening food in full abundance.
