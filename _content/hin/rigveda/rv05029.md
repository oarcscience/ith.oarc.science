### HYMN XXIX. Agni.

1\. MAN'S worship of the Gods hath three great lustres, and three
celestial lights have they established  
The Maruts gifted with pure strength adore thee, for thou, O Indra, art
their sapient Ṛṣi.  
2 What time the Maruts sang their song to Indra, joyous when he had
drunk of Soma juices,  
He grasped his thunderbolt to slay the Dragon, and loosed, that they
might flow, the youthful Waters.  
3 And, O ye Brahmans, Maruts, so may Indra drink draughts of this my
carefully pressed Soma;  
For this oblation found for man the cattle, and Indra, having quaffed
it, slew the Dragon.  
4 Then heaven and earth he sundered and supported: wrapped even in these
he struck the Beast with terror.  
So Indra forced the Engulfer to disgorgement, and slew the Dānava.
panting against him.  
5 Thus all the Gods, O Maghavan, delivered to thee of their free will
the draught of Soma;  
When thou for Etaśa didst cause to tarry the flying mares of Sūrya
racing forward.  
6 When Maghavan with the thunderbolt demolished his nine-and-ninety
castles all together,  
The Maruts, where they met, glorified Indra: ye with the Tṛṣṭup hymn
obstructed heaven.  
7 As friend to aid a friend, Agni dressed quickly three hundred
buffaloes, even as he willed it.  
And Indra, from man's gift, for Vṛtra's slaughter, drank ofr at once
three lakes of pressed-out Soma.  
8 When thou three hundred buffaloes' flesh hadst eaten, and drunk, as
Maghavan, three lakes of Soma,  
All the Gods raised as ’twere a shout of triumph to Indra praise because
he slew the Dragon.  
9 What time ye came with strong steeds swiftly speeding, O Uśanā and
Indra, to the dwelling,  
Thou camest thither -conquering together with Kutsa and the Gods: thou
slewest Śuṣṇa.  
10 One car-wheel of the Sun thou rolledst forward, and one thou settest
free to move for Kutsa.  
Thou slewest noseless Dasyus with thy weapon, and in their home
o’erthrewest hostile speakers.  
11 The lauds of Gauriviti made thee mighty to Vidathin's son, as prey,
thou gavest Pipru.  
Rjisivan drew thee into friendship dressing the sacred food, and thou
hast drunk his Soma.  
12 Navagvas and Dasgvas with libations of Soma juice sing hymns of
praise to Indra.  
Labouring at their task the men laid open the stall of Kine though
firmly closed and fastened.  
13 How shall I serve thee, Maghavan, though knowing full well what hero
deeds thou hast accomplished?  
And the fresh deeds which thou wilt do, Most Mighty! these, too, will we
tell forth in sacred synods.  
14 Resistless from of old through hero courage, thou hast done all these
many acts, O Indra.  
What thou wilt do in bravery, Thunder-wielder! none is there who may
hinder this thy prowess.  
15 Indra, accept the prayers which now are offered, accept the new
prayers, Mightiest! which we utter.  
Like fair and well-made robes, I, seeking riches, as a deft craftsman
makes a car, have wrought them.
