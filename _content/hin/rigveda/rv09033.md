### HYMN XXXIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. LIKE waves of waters, skilled in song the juices of the Soma speed  
Onward, as buffaloes to woods.  
2 With stream of sacrifice the brown bright drops have flowed with
strength in store  
Of kine into the wooden vats.  
3 To Indra, Vāyu, Varuṇa, to Viṣṇu, and the Maruts, flow  
The drops of Soma juice effused.  
4 Three several words are uttered: kine are \]owing, cows who give their
milk:  
The Tawny-hued goes bellowing on.  
5 The young and sacred mothers of the holy rite have uttered praise:  
They decorate the Child of Heaven.  
6 From every side, O Soma, for our profit, pour thou forth four seas  
Filled full of riches thousandfold.
