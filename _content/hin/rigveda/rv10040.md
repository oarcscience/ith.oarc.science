### HYMN XL. Aśvins.

1\. YOUR radiant Chariot-whither goes it on its way?-who decks it for
you, Heroes, for its happy course,  
Starting at daybreak, visiting each morning every house, borne
hitherward through prayer unto the sacrifice?  
2 Where are ye, Aśvins, in the evening, where at morn? Where is your
haltingplace, where rest ye for the night?  
Who brings you homeward, as the widow bedward draws her husband's
brother, as the bride attracts the groom?  
3 Early ye sing forth praise as with a herald's voice, and, meet for
worship, go each morning to the house.  
Whom do ye ever bring to ruin? Unto whose libations come ye, Heroes,
like two Sons of Kings?  
4 Even as hunters follow two wild elephants, we with oblations call you
down at morn and eve.  
To folk who pay you offierings at appointed times, Chiefs, Lords of
splendour, ye bring food to strengthen them.  
5 To you, O Aśvins, came the daughter of a King, Ghoṣā, and said, O
Heroes, this I beg of you:  
Be near me in the day, he near me in the night: help me to gain a
car-borne chieftain rich in steeds.  
6 O Aśvins, ye are wise: as Kutsa comes to men, bring your car nigh the
folk of him who sings your praise.  
The bee, O Aśvins, bears your honey in her mouth, as the maid carries it
purified in her hand.  
7 To Bhujyu and to Vaśa ye come near with help, O Aśvins, to Sinjara and
to Uśanā.  
Your worshipper secures your friendship for himself. Through your
protection I desire felicity.  
8 Krsa and Śayu ye protect, ye Aśvins Twain: ye Two assist the widow and
the worshipper;  
And ye throw open, Aśvins, unto those who win the cattle-stall that
thunders with its serenfold mouth.  
9 The Woman hath brought forth, the Infant hath appeared, the plants of
wondrous beauty straightway have sprung up.  
To him the rivers run as down a deep descent, and he this day becomes
their master and their lord.  
10 They mourn the living, cry aloud, at sacrifice: the men have set
their thoughts upon a distant cast.  
A lovely thing for fathers who have gathered here,—a joy to
husbands,—are the wives their arms shall clasp  
11 Of this we have no knowledge. Tall it forth to us, now the youth
rests within the chambers of the bride.  
Fain would we reach the dwelling of the vigorous Steer who loves the
kine, O Aśvins: this is our desire.  
12 Your favouring grace hath come, ye Lords of ample wealth: Aśvins, our
longings are stored up within your hearts.  
Ye, Lords of splendour, have become our twofold guard: may we as welcome
friends reach Aryaman's abode.  
13 Even so, rejoicing in the dwelling-place of man, give hero sons and
riches to the eloquent.  
Make a ford, Lords of splendour, where men well may drink: remove the
spiteful tree-stump standing in the path.  
14 O Aśvins, Wonder-Workers, Lords of lustre, where and with what folk
do ye delight yourselves to-day?  
Who hath detained them with him? Whither are they gone? Unto what sage's
or what worshipper's abode?
