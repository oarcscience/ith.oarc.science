### HYMN XXII. Aśvins.

1\. HITHERWARD have I called to-day, for succour, that most wondrous
car  
Which ye ascended, Aśvins, ye whose paths are red, swift to give Car,
for Sūrya's sake.  
2 Car ever young, much longed-for, easily invoked, soon guided, first in
deeds of might,  
Which waits and serves, O Sobhari, with benevolence, without a rival or
a foe.  
3 These Aśvins with our homage, these Two Omnipresent Deities  
Hitherward will we bring for kind help, these who seek the dwelling of
the worshipper.  
4 One of your chariot wheels is moving swiftly round, one speeds for you
its onward course.  
Like a milch-cow, O Lords of splendour, and with haste let your
benevolence come to us.  
5 That chariot of yours which hath a triple seat and reins of gold,  
The famous car that traverseth the heaven and earth, thereon Nāsatyas,
Aśvins, come.  
6 Ye with your plough, when favouring Manu with your help, ploughed the
first harvest in the sky.  
As such will we exalt you, Lords of splendour, now, O Aśvins, with our
prayer and praise.  
7 Come to us, Lords of ample wealth, by paths of everlasting Law,  
Whereby to high dominion ye with mighty strength raised Trksi,
Trasadasyu's son.  
8 This Soma pressed with stones is yours, ye Heroes, Lords of plenteous
wealth.  
Approach to drink the Soma, come, drink in the worshipper's abode.  
9 O Aśvins, mount the chariot, mount the golden seat, ye who are Lords
of plenteous wealth,  
And bring to us abundant food.  
10 The aids wherewith ye helped Paktha and Adhrigt;, and Babhru severed
from his friends,—  
With those, O Aśvins, come hither with speed and soon, and heal whatever
is diseased.  
11 When we continually invoke the Aśvins, the resistless, at this time
of day,  
We lovers of the song, with songs.  
12 Through these, ye Mighty Ones, come hither to my call which brings
all blessings, wears all forms,—  
Tlirough which, All-present Heroes, lavishest of food ye strengthened
Krvi, come through these.  
13 I speak to both of these as such, these Aśvins whom I reverence at
this time of day:  
With homage we entreat them both.  
14 Ye who are Lords of splendour, ye whose paths are red, at eve, at
mom, at sacrifice,  
Give us not utterly as prey to mortal foe, ye Rudras, Lords of ample
wealth.  
15 For bliss I call. the blissful car, at morn the inseparable Aśvins
with their car  
I call, like Sobhari our sire.  
16 Rapid as thought, and strong, and speeding to thejoy, bringing.your
swiftly-coming help,  
Be to us a protection even from far away Lords of great wealth, with
many aids.'  
17 Come, Wonder-Workers, to our home, our home, O Aśvins, rich in
cattle, steeds, and gold,  
Chief drinkers of the Soma's juice  
18 Choice-worthy strength, heroic, firm and excellent, uninjured by the
Rakṣas foe,  
At this your coming nigh, ye Lords of ample wealth and all good things,
may we obtain.
