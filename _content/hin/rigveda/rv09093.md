### HYMN XCIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. TEN sisters, pouring out the rain together, swift-moving thinkers of
the sage, adorn him.  
Hither hath run the gold-hued Child of Sūrya and reached the vat like a
fleet vigorous courser.  
2 Even as a youngling crying to his mothers, the bounteous Steer hath
flowed along to waters.  
As youth to damsel, so with milk he hastens on to the. chose
meeting-place, the beaker.  
3 Yea, swollen is the udder of the milch-cow: thither in streams goes
very sapient Indu.  
The kine make ready, as with new-washed treasures, the Head and Chief
with milk within the vessels.  
4 With all the Gods, O Indu Pavamana, while thou art roaring send us
wealth in horses.  
Hither upon her car come willing Plenty, inclined to us, to give us of
her treasures.  
5 Now unto us mete riches, while they cleansethee, all-glorious,
swelling wealth, with store of heroes.  
Long be his life who worships, thee, O Indu. May he, enriched with
prayer, come soon and early.
