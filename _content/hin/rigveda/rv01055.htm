<p>1 THOUGH e&#146;en this heaven's wide space and earth have spread them out, nor heaven nor earth may be in greatness Indra's match.<br> Awful and very mighty, causing woe to men, he whets his thunderbolt for sharpness, as a bull.<br> 2 Like as the watery ocean, so doth he receive the rivers spread on all sides in their ample width.<br> He bears him like a bull to drink of Soma juice, and will, as Warrior from of old, be praised for might.<br> 3 Thou swayest, Indra, all kinds of great manly power, so as to bend, as&#146;t were, even that famed mountain down.<br> Foremost among the Gods is he through hero might, set in the van, the Strong One, for each arduous deed.<br> 4 He only in the wood is praised by worshippers, when he shows forth to men his own fair Indra-power.<br> A friendly Bull is he, a Bull to be desired when Maghavan auspiciously sends forth his voice.<br> 5 Yet verily the Warrior in his vigorous strength stirreth up with his might great battles for mankind;<br> And men have faith in Indra, the resplendent One, what time he hurleth down his bolt, his dart of death.<br> 6 Though, fain for glory, and with strength increased on earth, he with great might destroys the dwellings made with art,<br> He makes the lights of heaven shine forth secure, he bids, exceeding wise, the floods flow for his worshipper.<br> 7 Drinker of Soma, let thy heart incline to give; bring thy Bays hitherward, O thou who hearest praise.<br> Those charioteers of thine, best skilled to draw the rein, the rapid sunbeams, Indra, lead thee not astray.<br> 8 Thou bearest in both hands treasure that never fails; the famed One in his body holds unvanquished might.<br> O Indra, in thy members many powers abide, like wells surrounded by the ministering priests.</p>
