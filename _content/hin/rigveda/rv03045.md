Heritage

### HYMN XLV. Indra.

1\. COME hither, Indra, with Bay Steeds, joyous, with tails like
peacocks' plumes.  
Let no men cheek thy course as fowlers stay the bird: pass o’er them as
o’er desert lands.  
2 He who slew Vṛtra, burst the cloud, brake the strongholds and drave
the floods,  
Indra who mounts his chariot at his Bay Steeds' cry, shatters e’en
things that stand most firm.  
3 Like pools of water deep and full, like kine thou cherishest thy
might;  
Like the milch-cows that go well-guarded to the mead, like water-brooks
that reach the lake.  
4 Bring thou us wealth with power to strike, our share, 'gainst him who
calls it his.  
Shake, Indra, as with hooks, the tree for ripened fruit, for wealth to
satisfy our wish.  
5 Indra, self-ruling Lord art thou, good Leader, of most glorious
fame.  
So, waxen in thy strength, O thou whom many praise, be thou most swift
to hear our call.
