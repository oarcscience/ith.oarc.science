### HYMN CX. Ṛbhus.

1\. THE holy work I wrought before is wrought again: my sweetest hymn is
sung to celebrate your praise.  
Here, O ye Ṛbhus, is this sea for all the Gods: sate you with Soma
offered with the hallowing word.  
2 When, seeking your enjoyment onward from afar, ye, certain of my
kinsmen, wandered on your way,  
Sons of Sudhanvan, after your long journeying, ye came unto the home of
liberal Savitar.  
3 Savitar therefore gave you immortality, because ye came proclaiming
him whom naught can hide;  
And this the drinking-chalice of the Asura, which till that time was
one, ye made to be fourfold.  
4 When they had served with zeal at sacrifice as priests, they, mortal
as they were, gained immortality.  
The Ṛbhus, children of Sudhanvan, bright as suns, were in a year's
course made associate with prayers.  
5 The Ṛbhus, with a rod measured, as ’twere a field, the single
sacrificial chalice. wide of mouth,  
Lauded of all who saw, praying for what is best, desiring glorious fame
among Immortal Gods.  
6 As oil in ladles, we through knowledge will present unto the Heroes of
the firmament our hymn,—  
The Ṛbhus who came near with this great Father's speed, and rose to
heaven's high sphere to eat the strengthening food.  
7 Ṛbhu to us is Indra freshest in his might, Ṛbhu with powers and wealth
is giver of rich gifts.  
Gods, through your favour may we on the happy day quell the attacks of
those who pour no offerings forth.  
8 Out of a skin, O Ṛbhus, once ye formed a cow, and brought the mother
close unto her calf again.  
Sons of Sudhanvan, Heroes, with surpassing skill ye made your aged
Parents youthful as before.  
9 Help us with strength where spoil is won, O Indra: joined with the
Ṛbhus give us varied bounty.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
