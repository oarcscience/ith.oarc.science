Heritage

### HYMN CLXXXVII. Agni.

1\. To Agni send I forth my song, to him the Bull of all the folk:  
So may he bear us past our foes.  
2 Who from the distance far away shines brilliantly across the wastes:  
So may he bear us past our foes.  
3 The Bull with brightly-gleaming flame who utterly consumes the
fiends  
So may he bear us past our foes.  
4 Who looks on all existing things and comprehends them with his view:  
So may he bear us past our foes.  
5 Resplendent Agni, who was born in farthest region of the air:  
So may he bear us past our foes.
