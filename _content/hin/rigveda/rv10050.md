### HYMN L. Indra Vaikuntha.

1\. I LAUD your Mighty One who joyeth in the juice, him who is shared by
all men, who created all;  
Indra, whose conquering strength is powerful in war, whose fame and
manly vigour Heaven and Earth revere.  
2 He with his friend is active, lauded, good to man, Indra who must be
glorified by one like me.  
Hero, Lord of the brave, all cars are thy delight, warring with Vṛtra,
or for waters, or for spoil.  
3 Who are the men whom thou wilt further, Indra, who strive to win thy
bliss allied with riches?  
Who urged thee forward to exert thy power divine, to valour, in the war
for waters on their fields?  
4 Thou, Indra, through the holy prayer art mighty, worthy of sacrifice
at all libations.  
In every fight thou castest heroes on the ground: thou art the noblest
song, O Lord of all the folk.  
5 Help now, as Highest, those who toil at sacrifice: well do the people
know thy great protecting might.  
Thou shalt be Everlasing, Giver of success yea, on all these libations
thou bestowest strength.  
6 All these libations thou makest effectual, of which thou art thyself
supporter, Son of Power.  
Therefore thy vessel is to be esteemed the best, sacrifice, holy text,
prayer, and exalted speech.  
7 They who with flowing Soma pray to thee, O Sage, to pour on them thy
gifts of opulence and wealth,  
May they come forward, through their spirit, on the path of bliss, in
the wild joy of Soma juice effused.
