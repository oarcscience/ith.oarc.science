### HYMN XII. Indra-Agni.

1\. MOVED, Indra-Agni, by our hymn, come to the juice, the precious
dew:  
Drink ye thereof, impelled by song.  
2 O Indra-Agni, with the man who lauds you comes the wakening rite:  
So drink ye both this juice assured.  
3 Through force of sacrifice I choose Indra-Agni who love the wise:  
With Soma let these sate them here.  
4 Indra and Agni I invoke, joint-victors, bounteous, unsubdued,  
Foe-slayers, best to win the spoil.  
5 Indra and Agni, singers skilled in melody hymn you, bringing lauds:  
I choose you for the sacred food.  
6 Indra and Agni, ye cast down the ninety forts which Dāsas held,  
Together, with one mighty deed.  
7 To Indra-Agni reverent thoughts go forward from the holy task  
Along the path of sacred Law.  
8 O Indra-Agni, powers are yours, and dwellings and delightful food  
Good is your readiness to act.  
9 Indra and Agni, in your deeds of might ye deck heaven's lucid
realms:  
Famed is that hero strength of yours.
