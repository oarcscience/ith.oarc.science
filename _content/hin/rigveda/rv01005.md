### HYMN V. Indra.

1 O COME ye hither, sit ye down: to Indra sing ye forth, your song,  
companions, bringing hymns of praise.  
2 To him the richest of the rich, the Lord of treasures excellent,  
Indra, with Soma juice outpoured.  
3 May he stand by us in our need and in abundance for our wealth:  
May he come nigh us with his strength.  
4 Whose pair of tawny horses yoked in battles foemen challenge not:  
To him, to Indra sing your song.  
5 Nigh to the Soma-drinker come, for his enjoyment, these pure drops,  
The Somas mingled with the curd.  
6 Thou, grown at once to perfect strength, wast born to drink the Soma
juice,  
Strong Indra, for preëminence.  
7 O Indra, lover of the song, may these quick Somas enter thee:  
May they bring bliss to thee the Sage.  
8 Our chants of praise have strengthened thee, O Śatakratu, and our
lauds  
So strengthen thee the songs we sing.  
9 Indra, whose succour never fails, accept these viands thousandfold,  
Wherein all manly powers abide.  
10 O Indra, thou who lovest song, let no man hurt our bodies, keep  
Slaughter far from us, for thou canst.
