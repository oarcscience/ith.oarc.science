### HYMN VII. Agni.

1\. O AGNI, shared by all men living bring us good luck for sacrifice
from earth and heaven.  
With us be thine intelligence, WonderWorker! Protect us, God, with thy
far-reaching blessings.  
2 These hymns brought forth for thee, O Agni, laud thee for bounteous
gifts, with cattle and with horses.  
Good Lord, when man from thee hath gained enjoyment, by hymns, O
noblyborn, hath he obtained it.  
3 Agni I deem my Kinsman and my Father, count him my Brother and my
Friend for ever.  
I honour as the face of lofty Agni in heaven the bright and holy light
of Sūrya.  
4 Effectual, Agni, are our prayers for profit. He whom, at home thou,
Priest for ever, guardest  
Is rich in food, drawn by red steeds, and holy: by day and night to him
shall all be pleasant.  
5 Men with their arms have generated Agni, helpful as some kind friend,
adorned with splendours,  
And stablished as Invoker mid the people the ancient Priest the
sacrifice's lover.  
6 Worship, thyself, O God, the Gods in heaven: what, void of knowledge,
shall the fool avail thee?  
As thou, O God, hast worshipped Gods by seasons, so, nobly-born! to
thine own self pay worship.  
7 Agni, be thou our Guardian and Protector bestow upon us life and vital
vigour.  
Accept, O Mighty One, the gifts we offer, and with unceasing care
protect our bodies.
