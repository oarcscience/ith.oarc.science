Heritage

### HYMN LIII. Heaven and Earth.

1\. AS priest with solemn rites and adorations I worship Heaven and
Earth, the High and Holy.  
To them, great Parents of the Gods, have sages of ancient time, singing,
assigned precedence.  
2 With newest hymns set in the seat of Order, those the Two Parents,
born before all others,  
Come, Heaven and Earth, with the Celestial People, hither to us, for
strong is your protection.  
3 Yea, Heaven and Earth, ye hold in your possession full many a treasure
for the liberal giver.  
Grant us that wealth which comes in free abundance. Preserve us
evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
