*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HYMN XLI. Aśvins.

1\. THAT general Car of yours, invoked by many a man, that comes to our
libations, three-wheeled, meet for lauds,  
That circumambient Car, worthy of sacrifice, we call with our pure hymns
at earliest flush of dawn.  
2 Ye, O Nāsatyas, mount that early-harnessed Car, that travels early,
laden with its freight of balm,  
Wherewith ye, Heroes, visit clans who sacrifice, even the poor man's
worship where the priest attends.  
3 If to the deft Adhvaryu with the meath in hand, or to the Kindler firm
in strength, the household friend,  
Or to the sage's poured libations ye approach, come thence, O Aśvins,
now to drink the offered meath.
