<p>1. To him the Lord of all, the Lord of wealth, of light; him who is Lord for ever, Lord of men and tilth,<br> Him who is Lord of horses, Lord of kine, of floods, to Indra, to the Holy bring sweet Soma juice.<br> 2 To him the potent One, who conquers and breaks down, the Victor never vanquished who disposes all,<br> The mighty-voiced, the rider, unassailable, to Indra everconquering speak your reverent prayer.<br> 3 Still Victor, loved by mortals, ruler over men, o&#146;erthrower, warrior, he hath waxen as he would;<br> Host-gatherer, triumphant, honoured mid the folk. Indra's heroic deeds will I tell forth to all.<br> 4 The strong who never yields, who slew the furious fiend, the deep, the vast, of wisdom unattainable;<br> Who speeds the good, the breaker-down, the firm, the vast,&#151;Indra whose rites bring joy hath made the light of Dawn.<br> 5 By sacrifice the yearning sages sending forth their songs found furtherance from him who speeds the flood.<br> In Indra seeking help with worship and with hymn, they drew him to themselves and won them kine and wealth.<br> 6 Indra, bestow on us the best of treasures, the spirit of ability and fortune;<br> Increase of riches, safety of our bodies, charm of sweet speech, and days of pleasant weather.</p>
