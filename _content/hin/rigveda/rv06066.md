### HYMN LXVI. Maruts.

1\. E'EN to the wise let that be still a wonder to which the general
name of Cow is given.  
The one hath swelled among mankind for milking: Pṛśni hath drained but
once her fair bright udder.  
2 They who like kindled flames of fire are glowing,. the Maruts, twice
and thrice have waxen mighty.  
Golden and dustless were their cars, invested with their great strength
and their heroic vigour.  
3 They who are Sons of the rain-pouring Rudra, whom the long-lasting One
had power to foster:  
The Mighty Ones whose germ great Mother Pṛśni is known to have received
for man's advantage.  
4 They shrink not from the birth; in this same manner still resting
there they purge away reproaches.  
When they have streamed forth, brilliant, at their pleasure, with their
own splendour they bedew their bodies.  
5 Even those who bear the brave bold name of Maruts, whom not the active
quickly wins for milking.  
Even the liberal wards not off those fierce ones, those who are light
and agile in their greatness.  
6 When, strong in strength and armed with potent weapons, they had
united wellformed earth and heaven,  
Rodasl stood among these furious Heroes like splendour shining with her
native brightness.  
7 No team of goats shall draw your car, O Maruts, no horse no charioteer
be he who drives it.  
Halting not, reinless, through the air it travels, speeding alone its
paths through earth and heaven.  
8 None may obstruct, none overtake, O Maruts, him whom ye succour in the
strife of battle  
For sons and progeny, for kine and waters: he bursts the cow-stall on
the day of trial.  
9 Bring a bright hymn to praise the band of Maruts, the Singers, rapid,
strong in native vigour,  
Who conquer mighty strength with strength more mighty: earth shakes in
terror at their wars, O Agni.  
10 Bright like the flashing flames of sacrifices, like tongues of fire
impetuous in their onset,  
Chanting their psalm, singing aloud, like heroes, splendid from birth,
invincible, the Maruts.  
11 That swelling band I call with invocation, the brood of Rudra, armed
with glittering lances.  
Pure hymns are meet for that celestial army: like floods and mountains
have the Strong Ones battled.
