Heritage

### HYMN LXXIII. Bṛhaspati.

1\. SERVED with oblations, first-born, mountain-render, Aṅgiras' son,
Bṛhaspati, the Holy,  
With twice-firm path, dwelling in light, our Father, roars loudly, as a
bull, to Earth and Heaven.  
2 Bṛhaspati, who made for such a people wide room and verge when Gods
were invocated,  
Slaying his enemies, breaks down their castles, quelling his foes and
conquering those who hate him.  
3 Bṛhaspati in war hath won rich treasures, hath won, this God, the
great stalls filled with cattle.  
Striving to win waters and light, resistless, Bṛhaspati with lightning
smites the foeman.
