### HYMN V. Agni.

1\. AGNI who shines against the Dawns is wakened. The holy Singer who
precedes the sages.  
With far-spread lustre, kindled by the pious, the Priest hath thrown
both gates of darkness open.  
2 Agni hath waxen mighty by laudations, to be adored with hymns of those
who praise him.  
Loving the varied shows of holy Order at the first flush of dawn he
shines as envoy.  
3 Amid men's homes hath Agni been established, fulfilling with the Law,
Friend, germ of waters.  
Loved and adored, the height he hath ascended, the Singer, object of our
invocations.  
4 Agni is Mitra when enkindled duly, Mitra as Priest, Varuṇa,
Jātavedas;  
Mitra as active minister, and House-Friend, Mitra of flowing rivers and
of mountains.  
5 The Earth's, the Bird's dear lofty place he guardeth, he guardeth in
his might the course of Sūrya,  
Guardeth the Seven-headed in the centre, guardeth sublime the Deities
enjoyment.  
6 The skilful God who knows all forms of knowledge made for himself a
fair form, meet for worship.  
This Agni guards with care that never ceases the Soma's skin, the Bird's
place rich in fatness.  
7 Agni hath entered longingly the longing shrine rich with fatness,
giving easy access.  
Resplendent, pure, sublime and purifying, again, again he renovates his
Mothers.  
8 Born suddenly, by plants he grew to greatness, when tender shoots with
holy oil increased him,  
Like waters lovely when they hasten downward may Agni in his Parents'
lap protect us.  
9 Extolled, the Strong shone forth with kindled fuel to the earth's
centre, to the height of heaven.  
May Agni, Friend, adorable Mātariśvan, as envoy bring the Gods unto our
worship.  
10 Best of all luminaries lofty Agni supported with his flame the height
of heaven,  
When, far from Bhṛgus, Mātariśvan kindled the oblation-bearer where he
lay in secret.  
11 As holy food, Agni to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting,
rich in marvels.  
To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious
will to us-word.
