### HYMN VIII.Agni.

1\. Now praise, as one who strives for strength, the harnessing of
Agni's car,  
The liberal, the most splendid One;  
2 Who, guiding worshippers aright, withers, untouched by age, the foe:  
When worshipped fair to look upon;  
3 Who for his glory is extolled at eve and morning in our homes,  
Whose statute is inviolate;  
4 Who shines refulgent like the Sun, with brilliance and with fiery
flame,  
Decked with imperishable sheen.  
5 Him Atri, Agni, have our songs Strengthened according to his sway:  
All glories hath he made his own.  
6 May we with Agni's, Indra's help, with Soma's, yea, of all the Gods,  
Uninjured dwell together still, and conquer those who fight with us.
