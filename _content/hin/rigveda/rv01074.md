### HYMN LXXIV. Agni.

1\. As forth to sacrifice we go, a hymn to a hymn let us say,  
Who hears us even when afar;  
2 Who, from of old, in carnage, when the people gathered, hath
preserved  
His household for the worshipper.  
3 And let men say, Agni is born, e’en he who slayeth Vṛtra, he  
Who winneth wealth in every fight.  
4 Him in whose house an envoy thou lovest to taste his offered gifts,  
And strengthenest his sacrifice,  
5 Him, Aṅgiras, thou Son of Strength, all men call happy in his God,  
His offerings, and his sacred grass.  
6 Hitherward shalt thou bring these Gods to our laudation and to
taste.  
These offered gifts, fair-shining One.  
7 When, Agni, on thine embassage thou goest not a sound is heard of
steed or straining of thy car.  
8 Aided by thee uninjured, strong, one after other, goes he forth:  
Agni, the offerer forward steps.  
9 And splendid strength, heroic, high, Agni, thou grantest from the
Gods,  
Thou God, to him who offers gifts.
