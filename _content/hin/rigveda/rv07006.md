### HYMN VI. Agni.

1\. PRAISE of the Asura, high imperial Ruler, the Manly One in whom the
folk shall triumph-  
I laud his deeds who is as strong as Indra, and lauding celebrate the
Fort-destroyer.  
2 Sage, Sing, Food, Light,—they bring him from the mountain, the blessed
Sovran of the earth and heaven.  
I decorate with songs the mighty actions which Agni, Fort-destroyer, did
aforetime.  
3 The foolish, faithless, rudely-speaking niggards, without belief or
sacrifice or worship,—  
Far far sway hath Agni chased those Dasytis, and, in the cast, hath
turned the godless westward.  
4 Him who brought eastward, manliest with his prowess, the Maids
rejoicing in the western darkness,  
That Agni I extol, the Lord of riches, unyielding tamer of assailing
foemen.  
5 Him who brake down the walls with deadly weapons, and gave the
Mornings to anoble Husband,  
Young Agni, who with conquering strength subduing the tribes of Nahus
made them bring their tribute.  
6 In whose protection all men rest by nature, desiring to enjoy his
gracious favour-  
Agni Vaiśvānara in his Parents, bosom hath found the choicest seat in
earth and heaven.  
7 Vaiśvānara the God, at the sun's setting, hath taken to himself
deep-hidden treasures:  
Agni hath taken them from earth and heaven, from the sea under and the
sea above us.
