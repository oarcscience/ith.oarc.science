Heritage

### HYMN X. Agni.

1\. This day with praises, Agni, we bring thee that which thou lovest.  
Right judgment, like a horse, with our devotions.  
2 For thou hast ever been the Car-driver, Agni, of noble  
Strength, lofty sacrifice, and rightful judgment.  
3 Through these our praises come thou to meet us, bright as the
sunlight,  
O Agni, well disposed, with all thine aspects.  
4 Now may we serve thee singing these lauds this day to thee, Agni.  
Loud as the voice of Heaven thy blasts are roaring.  
5 Just at this time of the day and the night thy look is the sweetest:  
It shineth near us even as gold for glory.  
6 Spotless thy body, brilliant as gold, like clarified butter:  
This gleams like gold on thee, O Self. dependent.  
7 All hate and mischief, yea, if committed, Agni, thou turnest,  
Holy One, from the man who rightly worships.  
8 Agni, with you Gods, prosperous be our friendships and kinships.  
Be this our bond here by this place, thine altar.
