### HYMN II. Agni.

1\. THE, Faithful One, Immortal among mortals, a God among the Gods,
appointed envoy,  
Priest, best at worship, must shine forth in glory . Agni shall be
raised high with man's oblations.  
2 Born for us here this day, O Son of Vigour, between both races of born
beings, Agni,  
Thou farest as an envoy, having harnessed, Sublime One! thy
strong-muscled radiant stallions.  
3 I laud the ruddy steeds who pour down blessing, dropping oil, flectest
through the thoualit of Order.  
Yoking red horses to and fro thou goest between you Deities and mortal
races.  
4 Aryaman, Mitra, Varuṇa, and Indra with Viṣṇu, of the Gods, Maruts and
Aśvins-  
These, Agni, with good car and steeds, bring hither, most bountiful, to
folk with fair oblations.  
5 Agni, be this our sacrifice eternal, with brave friends, rich in kine
and sheep and horses,  
Rich, Asura! in sacred food and children, in full assembly, wealth
broad-based and during.  
6 The man who, sweating, brings for thee the fuel, and makes his head to
ache, thy faithful servant,—  
Agni, to him be a self-strong Protector guard him from all who seek to
do him mischief.  
7 Who brings thee food, though thou hast food in plenty, welcomes his
cheerful guest and speeds him onward,  
Who kindles thee devoutly in his dwelling,to him be wealth secure and
freely giving.  
8 Whoso sings praise to thee at eve or morning, and, with oblation, doth
the thing thou lovest,—  
In his own home, even as a goId-girt courser, rescue him from distress,
the bounteous giver.  
9 Whoso brings gifts to thee Immortal, Agni, and doth thee service with
uplifted ladle,—  
Let him not, sorely toiling, lose his riches; let not the sinner's
wickedness enclose him.  
10 Whose well-wrought worship thou acceptest, Agni, thou God a mortal's
gift, thou liberal Giver,—  
Dear be his sacrifice to thee, Most Youthful! and may we strengthen him
when he adores thee.  
11 May he who knows distinguish sense and folly of men, like straight
and crooked backs of horses.  
Lead us, O God, to wealth and noble offspring: keep penury afar and
grant us plenty.  
12 This Sage the Sages, ne’er deceived, commanded, setting him down in
dwellings of the living.  
Hence mayst thou, friendly God, with rapid footsteps behold the Gods,
wonderful, fair to look on.  
13 Good guidance hast thou for the priest, O Agni, who, Youngest God!
with outpoured Soma serves thee.  
Ruler of men, thou joyous God, bring treasure splendid and plentiful to
aid the toiler.  
14 Now all that we, thy faithful servants, Agni, have done with feet,
with hands, and with our bodies,  
The wise, with toil, the holy rite have guided, as those who frame a car
with manual cunning.  
15 May we, seven sages first in rank, engender, from Dawn the Mother,
men to be ordainers.  
May we, Aṅgirases, be sons of Heaven, and, radiant, burst the
wealth-containing mountain.  
16 As in the days of old our ancient Fathers, speeding the work of holy
worship, Agni,  
Sought pure light and devotion, singing praises; they cleft the ground
and made red Dawns apparent.  
17 Gods, doing holy acts, devout, resplendent, smelting like ore their
human generations.  
Enkindling Agni and exalting Indra, they came encompassing the stall of
cattle.  
18 Strong One! he marked them-and the Gods before them-like herds of
cattle in a foodful pasture.  
There they moaned forth their strong desire for mortals, to aid the
True, the nearest One, the Living.  
19 We have worked for thee, we have laboured nobly-bright Dawns have
shed their light upon our worship-  
Adding a beauty to the perfect Agni, and the God's beauteous eye that
shines for ever.  
20 Agni, Disposer, we have sung these praises to thee the Wise: do thou
accept them gladly.  
Blaze up on high and ever make us richer. Give us great wealth, O thou
whose boons are many.
