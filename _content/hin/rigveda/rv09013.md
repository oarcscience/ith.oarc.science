### HYMN XIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. PASSED through, the fleece in thousand streams the Soma, purified,
flows on  
To Indra's, Viyu's special place.  
2 Sing forth, ye men who long for help, to Pavamana, to the Sage,  
Effused to entertain the Gods.  
3 The Soma-drops with thousand powers are purified for victory,  
Hymned to become the feast of Gods.  
4 Yea, as thou flowest bring great store of food that we may win the
spoil  
Indu, bring splendid manly might.  
5 May they in flowing give us wealth in thousands, and heroic power,—  
These Godlike Soma-drops effused.  
6 Like coursers by their drivers urged, they were poured forth, for
victory,  
Swift through the woollen straining-cloth.  
7 Noisily flow the Soma-drops, like milch-kine lowing to their calves:  
They have run forth from both the hands.  
8 As Gladdener whom Indra loves, O Pavamana, with a roar  
Drive all our enemies away.  
9 O Pavamamas, driving off the godless, looking on the light,  
Sit in the place of sacrifice.
