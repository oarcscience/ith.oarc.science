### HYMN XXXI. Indra.

1\. WITH what help will he come to us, wonderful, ever-waxing Friend;  
With what most mighty company?  
2 What genuine and most liberal draught will spirit thee with juice to
burst  
Open e’en strongly-guarded wealth?  
3 Do thou who art Protector of us thy friends who praise thee  
With hundred aids approach us.  
4 Like as a courser's circling wheel, so turn thee hitherward to us,  
Attracted by the hymns of men.  
5 Thou seekest as it were thine own stations with swift descent of
powers:  
I share thee even with the Sun.  
6 What time thy courage and his wheels together, Indra, run their
course  
With thee and with the Sun alike,  
7 So even, Lord of Power and Might, the people call thee Maghavan,  
Giver, who pauses not to think.  
8 And verily to him who toils and presses Soma juice for thee  
Thou quickly givest ample wealth.  
9 No, not a hundred hinderers can check thy gracious bounty's flow,  
Nor thy great deeds when thou wilt act.  
10 May thine assistance keep us safe, thy hundred and thy thousand
aids:  
May all thy favours strengthen us.  
11 Do thou elect us this place for friendship and prosperity,  
And great celestial opulence.  
12 Favour us, Indra, evermore with overflowing store of wealth:  
With all thy succours aid thou us.  
13 With new protections, Indra, like an archer, open thou for us  
The stables that are filled with kine.  
14 Our chariot, Indra, boldly moves endued with splendour, ne’er
repulsed,  
Winning for us both kine and steeds.  
15 O Sūrya, make our fame to be most excellent among the Gods,  
Most lofty as the heaven on high.
