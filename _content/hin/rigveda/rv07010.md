*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HYMN X. Agni.

1\. HE hath sent forth, bright, radiant, and refulgent, like the Dawn's
Lover, his far-spreading lustre.  
Pure in his splendour shines the golden Hero: our longing thoughts hath
he aroused and wakened.  
2 He, like the Sun, hath shone while Morn is breaking, and priests who
weave the sacrifice sing praises,  
Agni, the God, who knows their generations and visits Gods, most
bounteous, rapid envoy.  
3 Our songs and holy hymns go forth to Agni, seeking the God and asking
him for riches,  
Him fair to see, of goodly aspect, mighty, men's messenger who carries
their oblations.  
4 joined with the Vasus, Agni, bring thou Indra bring hither mighty
Rudra with the Rudras,  
Aditi good to all men with Ādityas, Bṛhaspati All-bounteous, with the
Singers.  
5 Men eagerly implore at sacrifices Agni, Most Youthful God, the joyous
Herald.  
For he is Lord and Ruler over riches, and for Gods’ worship an unwearied
envoy.
