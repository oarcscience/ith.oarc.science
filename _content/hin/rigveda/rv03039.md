### HYMN XXXIX. Indra.

1\. To Indra from the heart the hymn proceedeth, to him the Lord,
recited, built with praises;  
The wakening song sung forth in holy synod: that which is born for thee,
O Indra, notice.  
2 Born from the heaven e’en in the days aforetime, wakening, sting aloud
in holy synod,  
Auspicious, clad in white and shining raiment, this is the ancient hymn
of our forefathers.  
3 The Mother of the Twins hath borne Twin Children: my tongue's tip
raised itself and rested silent.  
Killing the darkness at the light's foundation, the Couple newly born
attain their beauty.  
4 Not one is found among them, none of mortals, to blame our sires who
fought to win the cattle.  
Their strengthener was Indra the Majestic he spread their stalls of kine
the Wonder-Worker.  
5 Where as a Friend with friendly men, Navagvas, with heroes, on his
knees he sought the cattle.  
There, verily with ten Daśagvas Indra found the Sun lying hidden in the
darkness.  
6 Indra found meath collected in the milch-cow, by foot and hoof, in the
cow's place of pasture.  
That which lay secret, hidden in the waters, he held in his right hand,
the rich rewarder.  
7 He took the light, discerning it from darkness: may we be far removed
from all misfortune.  
These songs, O Soma-drinker, cheered by Soma, Indra, accept from thy
most zealous poet.  
8 Let there be light through both the worlds for worship: may we be far
from most overwhelming evil.  
Great woe comes even from the hostile mortal, piled up; but good at
rescue are the Vasus.  
9 Call we on Maghavan, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where
spoil is gathered,  
The Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who slays the Vṛtras,
wins and gathers riches.
