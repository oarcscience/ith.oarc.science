### HYMN XII. Agni.

1\. To Agni, lofty Asura, meet for worship, Steer of eternal Law, my
prayer I offer;  
I bring my song directed to the Mighty like pure oil for his mouth at
sacrifices.  
2 Mark the Law, thou who knowest, yea, observe it: send forth the full
streams of eternal Order.  
I use no sorcery with might or falsehood the sacred Law of the Red Steer
I follow.  
3 How hast thou, follower of the Law eternal, become the knower of a new
song, Agni?  
The God, the Guardian of the seasons, knows me: the Lord of him who won
this wealth I know not.  
4 Who, Agni, in alliance with thy foeman, what splendid helpers won for
them their riches?  
Agni, who guard the dwelling-place of falsehood? Who are protectors of
the speech of liars?  
5 Agni, those friends of thine have turned them from thee: gracious of
old, they have become ungracious.  
They have deceived themselves by their own speeches, uttering wicked
words against the righteous.  
6 He who pays sacrifice to thee with homage, O Agni, keeps the Red
Steer's Law eternal;  
Wide is his dwelling. May the noble offspring of Nahuṣa who wandered
forth come hither.
