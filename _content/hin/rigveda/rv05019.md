### HYMN XIX. Agni.

1\. ONE state begets another state: husk is made visible from husk:  
Within his Mother's side he speaks.  
2 Discerning, have they offered gifts: they guard the strength that
never wastes.  
To a strong fort have they pressed in.  
3 Śvaitreya's people, all his men, have gloriously increased in might.  
A gold chain Bṛhaduktha wears, as, through this Soma, seeking spoil.  
4 I bring, as ’twere, the longed-for milk, the dear milk of the
Sister-Pair.  
Like to a caldron filled with food is he, unconquered, conquering all.  
5 Beam of light, come to us in sportive fashion, finding thyself close
to the wind that fans thee.  
These flames of his are wasting flames, like arrows keen-pointed,
sharpened, on his breast.
