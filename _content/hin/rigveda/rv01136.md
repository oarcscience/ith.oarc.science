### HYMN CXXXVI. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. BRING adoration ample and most excellent, hymn, offerings, to the
watchful Twain, the bountiful, your sweetest to the bounteous Ones.  
Sovrans adored with streams of oil and praised at every sacrifice.  
Their high imperial might may nowhere be assailed, ne’er may their
Godhead be assailed.  
2 For the broad Sun was seen a path more widely laid, the path of holy
law hath been maintained with rays, the eye with Bhaga's rays of
light.  
Firm-set in heaven is Mitra's home, and Aryaman's and Varuṇa's.  
Thence they give forth great vital strength which merits praise, high
power of life that men shall praise.  
3 With Aditi the luminous, the celestial, upholder of the people, come
ye day by day, ye who watch sleepless, day by day.  
Resplendent might have ye obtained, Ādityas, Lords of liberal gifts.  
Movers of men, mild both, are Mitra, Varuṇa, mover of men is Aryaman.  
4 This Soma be most sweet to Mitra, Varuṇa: he in the drinking-feasts,
shall have a share thereof, sharing, a God, among the Gods.  
May all the Gods of one accord accept it joyfully to-day.  
Therefore do ye, O Kings, accomplish what we ask, ye Righteous Ones,
whate’er we ask.  
5 Whoso, with worship serves Mitra and Varuṇa, him guard ye carefully,
uninjured, from distress, guard from distress the liberal man.  
Aryaman guards him well who acts uprightly following his law,  
Who beautifies their service with his lauds, who makes it beautiful with
songs of praise.  
6 Worship will I profess to lofty Dyaus, to Heaven and Earth, to Mitra
and to bounteous Varuṇa, the Bounteous, the Compassionate.  
Praise Indra, praise thou Agni, praise Bhaga and heavenly Aryaman.  
Long may we live and have attendant progeny, have progeny with Soma's
help.  
7 With the Gods’ help, with Indra still beside us, may we be held
self-splendid with the Maruts.  
May Agni, Mitra, Varuṇa give us shelter this may we gain, we and our
wealthy princes.
