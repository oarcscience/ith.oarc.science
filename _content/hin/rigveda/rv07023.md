### HYMN XXIII. Indra.

1\. PRAYERS have been offered up through love of glory: Vasiṣṭha, honour
Indra in the battle.  
He who with might extends through all existence hears words which I, his
faithful servant, utter.  
2 A cry was raised which reached the Gods, O Indra, a cry to them to
send us strength in combat.  
None among men knows his own life's duration: bear us in safety over
these our troubles.  
3 The Bays, the booty-seeking car I harness: my prayers have reached him
who accepts them gladly.  
Indra, when he had slain resistless foemen, forced with his might the
two world-halves asunder.  
4 Like barren cows, moreover, swelled the waters: the singen sought thy
holy rite, O Indra.  
Come unto us as with his team comes Vāyu: thou, through our solemn hymns
bestowest booty.  
5 So may these gladdening draughts rejoice thee, Indra, the Mighty, very
bounteous to the singer.  
Alone among the Gods thou pitiest mortals: O Hero, make thee glad at
this libation.  
6 Thus the Vasisthas glorify with praises Indra, the Powerful whose arm
wields thunder.  
Praised, may he guard our wealth in kine and heroes. Ye Gods, preserve
us evermore with blessings.
