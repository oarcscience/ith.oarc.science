### HYMN CV. Viśvedevas.

1\. WITHIN the waters runs the Moon, he with the beauteous wings in
heaven.  
Ye lightnings with your golden wheels, men find not your abiding-place.
Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
2 Surely men crave and gain their wish. Close to her husband clings the
wife.  
And, in embraces intertwined, both give and take the bliss of love. Mark
this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
3 O never may that light, ye Gods, fall from its station in the sky.  
Ne’er fail us one like Soma sweet, the spring of our felicity. Mark this
my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
4 I ask the last of sacrifice. As envoy he shall tell it forth.  
Where is the ancient law divine? Who is its new diffuser now? Mark this
my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
5 Ye Gods who yonder have your home in the three lucid realms of
heaven,  
What count ye truth and what untruth? Where is mine ancient call on you?
Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
6 What is your firm support of Law? What Varuṇa's observant eye?  
How may we pass the wicked on the path of mighty Aryaman? Mark this my
woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
7 I am the man who sang of old full many a laud when Soma flowed.  
Yet torturing cares consume me as the wolf assails the thirsty deer.
Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
8 Like rival wives on every side enclosing ribs oppress me sore.  
O Śatakratu, biting cares devour me, singer of thy praise, as rats
devour the weaver's threads. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
9 Where those seven rays are shining, thence my home and family
extend.  
This Tṛta Āptya knoweth well, and speaketh out for brotherhood. Mark
this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
10 May those five Bulls which stand on high full in the midst of mighty
heaven,  
Having together swiftly borne my praises to the Gods, return. Mark this
my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
11 High in the mid ascent of heaven those Birds of beauteous pinion
sit.  
Back from his path they drive the wolf as he would cross the restless
floods. Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
12 Firm is this new-wrought hymn of praise, and meet to be told forth, O
Gods.  
The flowing of the floods is Law, Truth is the Sun's extended light.
Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
13 Worthy of laud, O Agni, is that kinship which thou hast with Gods.  
Here seat thee like a man: most wise, bring thou the Gods for sacrifice.
Mark this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
14 Here seated, man-like as a priest shall wisest Agni to the Gods  
Speed onward our oblations, God among the Gods, intelligent. Mark this
my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
15 Varuṇa makes the holy prayer. To him who finds the path we pray.  
He in the heart reveals his thought. Let sacred worship rise anew. Mark
this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
16 That pathway of the Sun in heaven, made to be highly glorified,  
Is not to be transgressed, O Gods. O mortals, ye behold it not. Mark
this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
17 Tṛta, when buried in the well, calls on the Gods to succour him.  
That call of his Bṛhaspati heard and released him from distress. Mark
this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
18 A ruddy wolf beheld me once, as I was faring on my path.  
He, like a carpenter whose back is aching crouched and slunk away. Mark
this my woe, ye Earth and Heaven.  
19 Through this our song may we, allied with Indra, with all our heroes
conquer in the battle.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
