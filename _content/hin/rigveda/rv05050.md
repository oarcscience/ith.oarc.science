### HYMN L. Viśvedevas.

1\. LET every mortal man elect the friendship of the guiding God.  
Each one solicits him for wealth and seeks renown to prosper him.  
2 These, leading God, are thine, and these here ready to speak after
us.  
As such may we attain to wealth and wait with services on thee.  
3 So further honour as our guests the Hero Gods and then the Dames.  
May he remove and keep afar our foes and all who block our path.  
4 Where fire is set, and swiftly runs the victim dwelling in the
trough,  
He wins, with heroes in his home, friendly to man, like constant
streams.  
5 May these thy riches, Leader God! that rule the car, be blest to us,  
Yea, blest to us for wealth and weal. This will we ponder praising
strength, this ponder as we praise the God.
