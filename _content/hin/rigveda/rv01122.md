### HYMN CXXII Viśvedevas.

1\. SAY, bringing sacrifice to bounteous Rudra, This juice for drink to
you whose wrath is fleeting!  
With Dyaus the Asura's Heroes I have lauded the Maruts as with prayer to
Earth and Heaven.  
2 Strong to exalt the early invocation are Night and Dawn who show with
varied aspect.  
The Barren clothes her in wide-woven raiment, and fair Morn shines with
Sūrya's golden splendour.  
3 Cheer us the Roamer round, who strikes at morning, the Wind delight
us, pourer forth of waters!  
Sharpen our wits, O Parvata and Indra. May all the Gods vouchsafe to us
this favour.  
4 And Auśija shall call for me that famous Pair who enjoy and drink, who
come to brighten.  
Set ye the Offspring of the Floods before you; both Mothers of the
Living One who beameth.  
5 For you shall Auśija call him who thunders, as, to win Arjuna's
assent, cried Ghoṣā.  
I will invoke, that Pūṣan may be bounteous to you, the rich munificence
of Agni.  
6 Hear, Mitra-Varuṇa, these mine invocations, hear them from all men in
the hall of worship.  
Giver of famous gifts, kind hearer, Sindhu who gives fair fields, listen
with all his waters!  
7 Praised, Mitra, Varuṇa! is your gift, a hundred cows to the Pṛkṣayāmas
and the Pajra.  
Presented by car-famous Priyaratha, supplying nourishment, they came
directly.  
8 Praised is the gift of him the very wealthy: may we enjoy it, men with
hero children:  
His who hath many gifts to give the Pajras, a chief who makes me rich in
cars and horses.  
9 The folk, O Mitra-Varuṇa, who hate you, who sinfully hating pour you
no libations,  
Lay in their hearts, themselves, a wasting sickness, whereas the
righteous gaineth all by worship.  
10 That man, most puissant, wondrously urged onward, famed among heroes,
liberal in giving,  
Moveth a warrior, evermore undaunted in all encounters even with the
mighty.  
11 Come to the man's, the sacrificer's calling: hear, Kings of
Immortality, joy-givers!  
While ye who speed through clouds decree your bounty largely, for fame,
to him the chariot rider.  
12 Vigour will we bestow on that adorer whose tenfold draught we come to
taste, so spake they.  
May all in whom rest splendour and great riches obtain refreshment in
these sacrifices.  
13 We will rejoice to drink the tenfold present when the twicefive come
bearing sacred viands.  
What can he do whose steeds and reins are choicest? These, the
all-potent, urge brave men to conquest.  
14 The sea and all the Deities shall give us him with the golden ear and
neck bejewelled.  
Dawns, hasting to the praises of the pious, be pleased with us, both
offerers and singers.  
15 Four youthful sons of Maśarśāra vex me, three, of the king, the
conquering Ayavasa.  
Now like the Sun, O Varuṇa and Mitra, your car hath shone, long-shaped
and reined with splendour.
