### HYMN LXXXIV. Indra.

1\. SONG-LOVER! like a charioteer come songs to thee when Soma flows.  
O Indra, they have called to thee as mother-kine unto their calves.  
2 Bright juices bitherward have sped thee, Indra, Lover of the Song.  
Drink, Indra, of this flowing sap: in every house ’tis set for thee.  
3 Drink Soma to inspirit thee, juice, Indra, which the Falcon brought:  
For thou art King and Sovran Lord of all the families of men.  
4 O Indra, hear Tirasci's call, the call of him who serveth thee.  
Satisfy him with wealth of kine and valiant offspring: Great art thou.  
5 For he, O Indra, hath produced for thee the newest gladdening song,  
A hymn that springs from careful thought, ancient, and full of sacred
truth.  
6 That Indra will we laud whom songs and hymns of praise have
magnified.  
Striving to win, we celebrate his many deeds of hero might.  
7 Come now and let us glorify pure Indra with pure Sāma hymns.  
Let the pure milky draught delight him strengthened by pure songs of
praise.  
8 O Indra, come thou pure to us, with pure assistance, pure thyself.  
Pure, send thou riches down to us, and, meet for Soma, pure, be glad.  
9 O Indra, pure, vouchsafe us wealth, and, pure, enrich the
worshipper.  
Pure, thou dost strike the Vṛtras dead, and strivest, pure, to win the
spoil.
