### HYMN LXXXVII. Varuṇa.

1\. VARUNA cut a pathway out for Sūrya, and led the watery floods of
rivers onward.  
The Mares, as in a race, speed on in order. He made great channels for
the days to follow.  
2 The wind, thy breath, hath sounded through the region like a wild
beast that seeks his food in pastures.  
Within these two, exalted Earth and Heaven, O Varuṇa, are all the forms
thou lovest.  
3 Varuṇa's spies, sent forth upon their errand, survey the two
world-halves well formed and fashioned.  
Wise are they, holy, skilled in sacrifices, the furtherers of the
praise-songs of the prudent.  
4 To me who understand hath Varuṇa spoken, the names borne by the Cow
are three times seven.  
The sapient God, knowing the place's secret, shall speak as ’twere to
teach the race that cometh.  
5 On him three heavens rest and are supported, and the three earths are
there in sixfold order.  
The wise King Varuṇa hath made in heaven that Golden Swing to cover it
with glory.  
6 Like Varuṇa from heaven he sinks in Sindhu, like a white-shining
spark, a strong wild creature.  
Ruling in depths and meting out the region, great saving power hath he,
this world's Controller.  
7 Before this Varuṇa may we be sinless him who shows mercy even to the
sinner-  
While we are keeping Aditi's ordinances. Preserve us evermore, ye Gods,
with blessings.
