*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

### HYMN LXXX. Dawn.

1 THE priests, Vasisthas, are the first awakened to welcome Uṣas with
their songs and praises,  
Who makes surrounding regions part asunder,and shows apparent all
existing creatures.  
2 Giving fresh life when she hath hid the darkness, this Dawn hath
wakened there with new-born lustre.  
Youthful and unrestrained she cometh forward: she hath turned thoughts
to Sun and fire and worship.  
3 May blessed Mornings shine on us for ever, with wealth of kine, of
horses, and of heroes,  
Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
