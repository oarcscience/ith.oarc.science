<p>1. EVEN as an archer shoots afar his arrow, offer the laud to him with meet adornment.<br> Quell with your voice the wicked's voice, O sages. Singer, make Indra rest beside the Soma.<br> 2 Draw thy Friend to thee like a cow at milking: O Singer, wake up Indra as a lover.<br> Make thou the Hero haste to give us riches even as a vessel filled brimful with treasure.<br> 3 Why, Maghavan, do they call thee Bounteous; Giver? Quicken me: thou, I hear, art he who quickens.<br> &#346;akra, let my intelligence be active, and bring us luck that finds great wealth, O Indra.<br> 4 Standing, in battle for their rights, together, the people, Indra, in the fray invoke thee.<br> Him who brings gifts the Hero makes his comrade: with him who pours no juice he seeks not friendship.<br> 5 Whoso with plenteous food for him expresses strong Somas as much quickly-coming treasure,<br> For him he overthrows in early morning his swift well-weaponed foes, and slays the tyrant.<br> 6 He unto whom we offer praises, Indra, Maghavan, who hath joined to ours his wishes,&#151;<br> Before him even afar the foe must tremble: low before him must bow all human glories.<br> 7 With thy fierce bolt, O God invoked of many, drive to a distance from afar the foeman.<br> O Indra, give us wealth in corn and cattle, and make thy singer's prayer gain strength and riches.<br> 8 Indra, the swallower of strong libations rich in the boons they bring, the potent Somas,<br> He, Maghavan, will not restrict his bounty he brings much wealth unto the Soma-presser.<br> 9 Yea, by superior play he wins advantage, when he, a gambler, piles his gains in season.<br> Celestial-natured, he o&#146;erwhelms with riches the devotee who keeps not back his treasure.<br> 10 O Much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with store of grain and cattle.<br> May we allied, as first in rank, with princes obtain possessions by our own exertion.<br> 11 B&#7771;haspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and from below, from sinners!<br> May Indra from the front, and from the centre, as Friend to friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.</p>
