### HYMN IV. Agni.

1\. O AGNI, King and Lord of wealth and treasures, in thee is my delight
at sacrifices.  
Through thee may we obtain the strength we long for, and overcome the
fierce attacks of mortals.  
2 Agni, Eternal Father, offering-bearer, fair to behold, far-reaching,
far-refulgent,  
From well-kept household fire beam food to feed us, and measure out to
us abundant glory.  
3 The Sage of men, the Lord of human races, pure, purifying Agni, balmed
with butter,  
Him the Omniscient as your Priest ye stablish: he wins among the Gods
things worth the choosing.  
4 Agni, enjoy, of one accord with Iḷā, striving in rivalry with beams of
Sūrya,  
Enjoy, O Jātavedas, this our fuel, and bring the Gods to us to taste
oblations.  
5 As dear House-Friend, guest welcome in the dwelling, to this our
sacrifice come thou who knowest.  
And, Agni, having scattered all assailants, bring to us the possessions
of our foemen.  
6 Drive thou away the Dasyu with thy weapon. As, gaining vital power for
thine own body,  
O Son of Strength, the Gods thou satisfiest, so in fight save us, most
heroic Agni.  
7 May we, O Agni, with our lauds adore thee, and with our gifts,
fair-beaming Purifier!  
Send to us wealth containing all things precious: bestow upon us every
sort of riches.  
8 Son of Strength, Agni, dweller in three regions, accept our sacrifice
and our oblation.  
Among the Gods may we be counted pious: protect us with a
triply-guarding shelter.  
9 Over all woes and dangers, Jātavedas, bear us as in a boat across a
river.  
Praised with our homage even as Atri praised thee, O Agni, be the
guardian of our bodies.  
10 As I, remembering thee with grateful spirit, a mortal, call with
might on thee Immortal,  
Vouchsafe us high renown, O Jātavedas, and may I be immortal by my
children.  
11 The pious man, O Jātavedas Agni, to whom thou grantest ample room and
pleasure,  
Gaineth abundant wealth with sons and horses, with heroes and with kine
for his well-being.
