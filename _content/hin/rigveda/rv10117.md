### HYMN CXVII. Liberality.

1\. THE Gods have not ordained hunger to be our death: even to the
well-fed man comes death in varied shape.  
The riches of the liberal never waste away, while he who will not give
finds none to comfort him.  
2 The man with food in store who, when the needy comes in miserable case
begging for bread to eat,  
Hardens his heart against him-even when of old he did him service-finds
not one to comfort him.  
3 Bounteous is he who gives unto the beggar who comes to him in want of
food and feeble.  
Success attends him in the shout of battle. He makes a friend of him in
future troubles.  
4 No friend is he who to his friend and comrade who comes imploring
food, will offer nothing.  
Let him depart-no home is that to rest in-, and rather seek a stranger
to support him.  
5 Let the rich satisfy the poor implorer, and bend his eye upon a longer
pathway.  
Riches come now to one, now to another, and like the wheels of cars are
ever rolling.  
6 The foolish man wins food with fruitless labour: that food -I speak
the truth- shall be his ruin.  
He feeds no trusty friend, no man to love him. All guilt is he who eats
with no partaker.  
7 The ploughshare ploughing makes the food that feeds us, and with its
feet cuts through the path it follows.  
Better the speaking than the silent Brahman: the liberal friend
outyalues him who gives not.  
8 He with one foot hath far outrun the biped, and the two-footed catches
the three-footed.  
Four-footed creatures come when bipeds call them, and stand and look
where five are met together.  
9 The hands are both alike: their labour differs. The yield of sister
milch-kine is unequal.  
Twins even diffier in their strength and vigour: two, even kinsmen,
differ in their bounty.
