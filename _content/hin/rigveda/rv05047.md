### HYMN XLVII. Viśvedevas.

1\. URGING to toil and making proclamation, seeking Heaven's Daughter
comes the Mighty Mother:  
She comes, the youthful Hymn, unto the Fathers, inviting to her home and
loudly calling.  
2 Swift in their motion, hasting to their duty, reaching the central
point of life immortal,  
On every side about the earth and heaven go forth the spacious paths
without a limit.  
3 Steer, Sea, Red Bird with strong wings, he hath entered the
dwelling-place of the Primeval Father.  
A gay-hued Stone set in the midst of heaven, he hath gone forth and
guards mid-air's two limits.  
4 Four bear him up and give him rest and quiet, and ten invigorate the
Babe for travel.  
His kine most excellent, of threefold nature, pass swiftly round the
boundaries of heaven.  
5 Wondrous, O people, is the mystic knowledge that while the waters
stand the streams are flowing:  
That, separate from his Mother, Two support him, closely-united, twins,
here made apparent.  
6 For him they lenghten prayers and acts of worship: the Mothers weave
garments for him their offspring.  
Rejoicing, for the Steer's impregning contact, his Spouses move on paths
or heaven to meet him.  
7 Be this our praise, O Varuṇa and Mitra may this be health and force to
us, O Agni.  
May we obtain firm ground and room for resting: Glory to Heaven, the
lofty habitation!
