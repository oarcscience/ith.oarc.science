### HYMN CLXII. The Horse.

1\. SLIGHT us not Varuṇa, Aryaman, or Mitra, Ṛbhukṣan, Indra, Āyu, or
the Maruts,  
When we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the strong Steed,
God-descended.  
2 What time they bear before the Courser, covered with trappings and
with wealth, the grasped oblation,  
The dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the place dear to
Indra and to Pūṣan.  
3 Dear to all Gods, this goat, the share of Pūṣan, is first led forward
with the vigorous Courser,  
While Tvaṣṭar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable for
sacrifice, to glory.  
4 When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who goeth to the
Gods as meet oblation,  
The goat precedeth him, the share of Pūṣan, and to the Gods the
sacrifice announceth.  
5 Invoker, ministering priest, atoner, fire-kindler Soma-presser, sage,
reciter,  
With this well ordered sacrifice, well finished, do ye fill full the
channels of the rivers.  
6 The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those who carve the
knob to deck the Horse's stake;  
Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,—may the approving
help of these promote our work.  
7 Forth, for the regions of the Gods, the Charger with his smooth back
is come my prayer attends him.  
In him rejoice the singers and the sages. A good friend have we won for
the Gods’ banquet.  
8 May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the head-stall and
the girths and cords about him.  
And the grass put within his mouth to bait him,—among the Gods, too, let
all these be with thee.  
9 What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left sticking
to the post or hatchet,  
Or to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,—among the Gods, too, may
all this be with thee.  
10 Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of raw flesh
remaining,  
This let the immolators set in order and dress the sacrifice with
perfect cooking.  
11 What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou art set upon
the spit, distilleth,  
Let not that lie on earth or grass neglected, but to the longing Gods
let all be offered.  
12 They who observing that the Horse is ready call out and say, the
smell is good; remove it;  
And, craving meat, await the distribution,—may their approving help
promote labour.  
13 The trial-fork of the flesh-cooking caldron, the vessels out of which
the broth is sprinkled,  
The warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks, carving-boards,—all
these attend the Charger.  
14 The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes
wherewith the Charger's feet were fastened,  
The water that he drank, the food he tasted,—among the Gods, too, may
all these attend thee.  
15 Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor glowing
caldron smell and break to pieces.  
Offered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,—such Charger do the Gods
accept with favour.  
16 The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the upper covering
and the golden trappings,  
The halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,—all these, as
grateful to the Gods, they offer.  
17 If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his heel or with
his whip distressed thee,  
All these thy woes, as with the oblations' ladle at sacrifices, with my
prayer I banish.  
18 The four-and-thirty ribs of the. Swift Charger, kin to the Gods, the
slayer's hatchet pierces.  
Cut ye with skill, so that the parts be flawless, and piece by piece
declaring them dissect them.  
19 Of Tvaṣṭar's Charger there is one dissector,—this is the custom-two
there are who guide him.  
Such of his limbs as I divide in order, these, amid the balls, in fire I
offer.  
20 Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the hatchet
linger in thy body.  
Let not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints, mangle thy limbs
unduly.  
21 No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: by easy paths unto the
Gods thou goest.  
Both Bays, both spotted mares are now thy fellows, and to the ass's pole
is yoked the Charger.  
22 May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in good kine,
good horses, manly offspring.  
Freedom from sin may Aditi vouchsafe us: the Steed with our oblations
gain us lordship!
