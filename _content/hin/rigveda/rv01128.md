### HYMN CXXVIII. Agni.

1\. By Manu's law was born this Agni, Priest most skilled, born for the
holy work of those who yearn therefore, yea, born for his own holy
work.  
All ear to him who seeks his love and wealth to him who strives for
fame,  
Priest ne’er deceived, he sits in Iḷā's holy place, girt round in Iḷā's
holy place.  
2 We call that perfecter of worship by the path or sacrifice; with
reverence rich in offerings, with worship rich in offerings.  
Through presentation of our food he grows not old in this his from;  
The God whom Mātariśvan brought from far away, for Manu brought from far
away.  
3 In ordered course forthwith he traverses the earth, swift-swallowing,
bellowing Steer, bearing the genial seed, bearing the seed and
bellowing.  
Observant with a hundred eyes the God is conqueror in the wood:  
Agni, who hath his seat in broad plains here below, and in the high
lands far away.  
4 That Agni, wise High-Priest, in every house takes thought for
sacrifice and holy service, yea, takes thought, with mental power, for
sacrifice.  
Disposer, he with mental power shows all things unto him who strives;  
Whence he was born a guest enriched with holy oil, born as Ordainer and
as Priest.  
5 When through his power and in his strong prevailing flames the Maruts’
gladdening boons mingle with Agni's roar, boons gladdening for the
active One,  
Then he accelerates the gift, and by the greatness of his wealth,  
Shall rescue us from overwhelming misery, from curse and overwhelming
woe.  
6 Vast, universal, good he was made messenger; the speeder with his
right hand hath not loosed his hold, through love of fame not loosed his
hold.  
He bears oblations to the Gods for whosoever supplicates.  
Agni bestows a blessing on each pious man, and opens wide the doors for
him.  
7 That Agni hath been set most kind in camp of men, in sacrifice like a
Lord victorious, like a dear Lord in sacred rites.  
His are the oblations of mankind when offered up at Iḷā's place.  
He shall preserve us from Varuṇa's chastisement, yea, from the great
God's chastisement.  
8 Agni the Priest they supplicate to grant them wealth: him, dear, most
thoughtful, have they made their messenger, him, offering-bearer have
they made,  
Beloved of all, who knoweth all, the Priest, the Holy one, the Sage—  
Him, Friend, for help, the Gods when they are fain for wealth, him,
Friend, with hymns, when fain for wealth.
