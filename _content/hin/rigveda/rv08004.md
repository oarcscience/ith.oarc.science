### HYMN IV. Indra.

1\. THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men eastward and westward, north
and south,  
Thou chiefly art with Ānava and Turvaśa, brave Champion I urged by men
to Come.  
2 Or, Indra, when with Ruma, Ruśama, Śyāvaka, and Kṛpa thou rejoicest
thee,  
Still do the Kaṇvas, bringing praises, with their prayers, O Indra, draw
thee hither: come.  
3 Even as the wild-bull, when he thirsts, goes to the desert's watery
pool,  
Come hither quickly both at morning and at eve, and with the Kaṇvas
drink thy fill.  
4 May the drops gladden thee, rich Indra, and obtain bounty for him who
pours the juice.  
Soma pressed in the mortar didst thou take and drink, and hence hast won
surpassing might.  
5 With mightier strength he conquered strength, with energy he crushed
their wrath.  
O Indra, Strong in youth, all those who sought the fray bent and bowed
down to thee like trees.  
6 He who wins promise of thine aid goes girt as with a thousand mighty
men of war.  
He makes his son preeminent in hero might: he serves with reverential
prayer.  
7 With thee, the Mighty, for our Friend, we will not fear or feel
fatigue.  
May we see Turvaśa and Yadu: thy great deed, O Hero, must be
glorified.  
8 On his left hip the Hero hath reclined himself: the proffered feast
offends him not.  
The milk is blended with the honey of the bee: quickly come hither,
baste, and drink.  
9 Indra, thy friend is fair of form and rich in horses, cars, and
kine.  
He evermore hath food accompanied by wealth, and radiant joins the
company.  
10 Come like a thirsty antelope to the drinking-place: drink Soma to thy
heart's desire.  
Raining it down, O Maghavan, day after day, thou gainest thy surpassing
might.  
11 Priest, let the Soma juice flow forth, for Indra longs to drink
thereof.  
He even now hath yoked his vigorous Bay Steeds: the Vṛtra-slayer hath
come near.  
12 The man with whom thou fillcst thee with Soma deems himself a pious
worshipper.  
This thine appropriate food is here poured out for thee: come, hasten
forward. drink of it,  
13 Press out the Soma juice, ye priests, for Indra borne upon his car.  
The pressing-stones speak loud of Indra, while they shed the juice
which, offered, honours him.  
14 To the brown juice may his dear vigorous Bay Steeds bring Indra, to
our holy task.  
Hither let thy Car-steeds who seek the sacrifice bring thee to our
drink-offerings.  
15 Pūṣan, the Lord of ample wealth, for firm alliance we elect.  
May he with wisdom, Śakra! Looser! Much-invoked! aid us to riches and to
seed.  
16 Sharpen us like a razor in the barber's hands: send riches thou who
settest free.  
Easy to find with thee are treasures of the Dawn for mortal man whom
thou dost speed.  
17 Pūṣan, I long to win thy love, I long to praise thee, Radiant God.  
Excellent Lord, ’tis strange tome, no wish have I to sing the psalm that
Pajra sings.  
18 My kine, O Radiant God, seek pasture where they will, my during
wealth, Immortal One.  
Be our protector, Pūṣan! be, most liberal Lord, propitious to our
gathering strength.  
19 Rich was the gift Kurunga gave, a hundred steeds at morning rites.  
Among the gifts of Turvaśas we thought of him, the opulent, the splendid
King.  
20 What by his morning songs Kaṇva, the powerful, hath, with the
Priyamedhas, gained-  
71 The herds of sixty thousand pure and spotless kine, have I, the Ṛṣi,
driven away.  
21 The very trees were joyful at my coming: kine they obtained in
plenty, steeds in plenty.
