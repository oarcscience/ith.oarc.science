### HYMN XX. Indra.

1\. STRONG, Godly-natured, born for hero exploit, man's Friend, hedoth
whatever deed he willeth.  
Saving us e’en from great transgression, Indra, the Youthful, visiteth
man's home with favour.  
2 Waxing greatness Indra slayeth Vṛtra: the Hero with his aid hath
helped the singer.  
He gave Sudās wide room and space, and often hath granted wealth to him
who brought oblations.  
3 Soldier unchecked, war-rousing, battling Hero, unconquered from of
old, victorious ever,  
Indra the very strong hath scattered armies; yea, he hath slain each foe
who fought against him.  
4 Thou with thy greatness hast filled full, O Indra, even both the
worlds with might, O thou Most Mighty.  
Lord of Bays, Indra, brandishing his thunder, is gratified with Soma at
the banquet.  
5 A Bull begat the Bull for joy of battle, and a strong Mother brought
forth him the manly.  
He who is Chief of men, their armies' Leader, is strong Hero, bold, and
fain for booty.  
6 The people falter not, nor suffer sorrow, who win themselves this
God's terrific spirit.  
He who with sacrifices worships Indra is lord of wealth, law-born and
law's protector.  
7 Whene’er the elder fain would help the younger the greater cometh to
the lesser's present.  
Shall the Immortal sit aloof' inactive? O Wondrous Indra, bring us
wondrous riches.  
8 Thy dear folk, Indra, who present oblations, are, in chief place, thy
friends, O Thunder-wielder.  
May we be best content in this thy favour, sheltered by One who slays
not, but preserves us.  
9 To thee the mighty hymn hath clamoured loudly, and, Maghavan, the
eloquent hath besought thee.  
Desire of wealth hath come upon thy singer: help us then, gakra, to our
share of riches.  
10 Place us by food which thou hast given, O Indra, us and the wealthy
patrons who command us.  
Let thy great power bring good to him who lauds thee. Ye Gods, preserve
us evermore with blessings.
