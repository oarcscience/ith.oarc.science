Heritage

### HYMN CXI. Ṛbhus.

1\. WORKING with skill they wrought the lightly rolling car: they
wrought the Bays who bear Indra and bring great gifts.  
The Ṛbhus for their Parents made life young again; and fashioned for the
calf a mother by its side.  
2 For sacrifice make for us active vital power for skill and wisdom food
with noble progeny.  
Grant to our company this power most excellent, that with a family
all-heroic we may dwell.  
3 Do ye, O Ṛbhus, make prosperity for us, prosperity for car, ye Heroes,
and for steed.  
Grant us prosperity victorious evermore,  
conquering foes in battle, strangers or akin.  
4 Indra, the Ṛbhus' Lord, I invocate for aid, the Ṛbhus, Vājas, Maruts
to the Soma draught.  
Varuṇa, Mitra, both, yea, and the Aśvins Twain: let them speed us to
wealth, wisdom, and victory.  
5 May Ṛbhu send prosperity for battle, may Vāja conquering in the fight
protect us.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
