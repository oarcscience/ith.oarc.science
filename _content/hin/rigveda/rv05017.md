### HYMN XVII. Agni.

1\. GOD, may a mortal call the Strong hither, with solemn rites, to
aid,  
A man call Agni to protect when sacrifice is well prepared.  
2 Near him thou seemest mightier still in native glory, set to hold  
Apart yon flame-hued vault of heaven, lovely beyond the thought of
man.  
3 Yea, this is by the light of him whom powerful song hath bound to
act,  
Whose beams of splendour flash on high as though they sprang from
heavenly seed.  
4 Wealth loads the Wonder-Worker's car through his, the very wise One's
power.  
Then, meet to be invoked among all tribes, is Agni glorified.  
5 Now, too, the princes shall obtain excellent riches by our lips.  
Protect us for our welfare: lend thy succour, O thou Son of Strength. Be
near in fight to prosper us.
