### HYMN XXXIII. Various Deities.

1\. THE urgings of the people have impelled me, and by,the nearest way I
bring you Pūṣan.  
The Universal Gods have brought me safely. The cry was heard, Behold,
Dubsasu cometh!  
2 The ribs that compass me give pain and trouble me like rival wives.  
Indigence, nakedness, exhaustion press me sore: my mind is fluttering
like a bird's.  
3 As rats eat weavers' threads, cares are consuming me, thy singer,
gatakratu, me.  
Have mercy on us once, O Indra, Bounteous Lord: be thou a Father unto
us.  
4 I the priests' Ṛṣi chose as prince most liberal Kurusravana,  
The son of Trasadasyu's son,  
5 Whose three bays harnessed to the car bear me straight onward: I will
laud  
The giver of a thousand meeds,  
6 The sire of Upamasravas, even him whose words were passing sweet,  
As a fair field is to its lord.  
7 Mark, Upamasravas, his son, mark, grandson of Mitratithi:  
I am thy father's eulogist.  
8 If I controlled Immortal Gods, yea, even were I Lord of men,  
My liberal prince were living still.  
9 None lives, even had he hundred lives, beyond the statute of the
Gods  
So am I parted from my friend.
