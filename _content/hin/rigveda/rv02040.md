### HYMN XL. Soma and Pūṣan.

1 SOMA and Pūṣan, Parents of all riches, Parents of earth and Parents of
high heaven,  
You Twain, brought forth as the whole world's protectors, the Gods have
made centre of life eternal.  
2 At birth of these two Gods all Gods are joyful: they have caused
darkness, which we hate, to vanish.  
With these, with Soma and with Pūṣan, India generates ripe warm milk in
the raw milch-cows.  
3 Soma and Pūṣan, urge your chariot hither, the seven-wheeled car that
measures out the region,  
That stirs not all, that moves to every quarter, five-reined and
harnessed by the thought, ye Mighty.  
4 One in the heaven on high hath made his dwelling, on earth and in the
firmament the other.  
May they disclose to us great store of treasure, much-longed for, rich
in food, source of enjoyment.  
5 One of you Twain is Parent of all creatures, the other journeys onward
all-beholding.  
Soma and Pūṣan, aid my thought with favour: with you may we o’ercome in
all encounters.  
6 May Pūṣan stir our thought, the all-impelling, may Soma Lord of riches
grant us riches.  
May Aditi the perfect Goddess aid us. Loud may we speak, with heroes, in
assembly.
