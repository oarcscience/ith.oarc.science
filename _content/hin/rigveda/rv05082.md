### HYMN LXXXII. Savitar.

1\. WE crave of Savitar the God this treasure much to be enjoyed.  
The best, all-yielding, conquering gift of Bhaga we would gladly win.  
2 Savitar's own supremacy, most glorious and beloved of all,  
No one diminisheth in aught.  
3 For Savitar who is Bhaga shall send riches to his worshipper.  
That wondrous portion we implore.  
4 Send us this day, God Savitar, prosperity with progeny.  
Drive thou the evil dream away.  
5 Savitar, God, send far away all sorrows and calamities,  
And send us only what is good.  
6 Sinless in sight of Aditi through the God Savitar's influence,  
May we obtain all lovely things.  
7 We with our hymns this day elect the general God, Lord of the good,  
Savitar whose decrees are true.  
8 He who for ever vigilant precedes these Twain, the Day and Night,  
Is Savitar the thoughtful God.  
9 He who gives glory unto all these living creatures with the song,  
And brings them forth, is Savitar.
