### HYMN LI. Indra.

1\. HIGH hymns have sounded forth the praise of Maghavan, supporter of
mankind, of Indra meet for lauds;  
Him who hath waxen great, invoked with beauteous songs, Immortal One,
whose praise each day is sung aloud.  
2 To Indra from all sides go forth my songs of praise, the Lord of
Hundred Powers, strong, Hero, like the sea,  
Swift, winner of the booty, breaker-down of forts, faithful and
ever-glorious, finder of the light.  
3 Where battle's spoil is piled the singer winneth praise, for Indra
taketh care of matchless worshippers.  
He in Vivasvān's dwelling findeth his delight: praise thou the
ever-conquering slayer of the foe.  
4 Thee, valorous, most heroic of the heroes, shall the priests glorify
with songg and praises.  
Full of all wondrous power he goes to conquest: worship is his, sole
Lord from days aforetime.  
5 Abundant are the gifts he gives to mortals: for him the earth bears a
rich store of treasures.  
The heavens, the growing plants, the living waters, the forest trees
preserve their wealth for Indra.  
6 To thee, O Indra, Lord of Bays, for ever are offered prayers and
songs: accept them gladly.  
As Kinsman think thou of some fresh assistance; good Friend, give
strength and life to those who praise thee.  
7 Here, Indra, drink thou Soma with the Maruts, as thou didst drink the
juice beside Śāryāta.  
Under thy guidance, in thy keeping, Hero, the singers serve, skilled in
fair sacrifices.  
8 So eagerly desirous drink the Soma, our juice, O Indra, with thy
friends the Maruts,  
Since at thy birth all Deities adorned thee for the great fight, O thou
invoked of many.  
9 He was your comrade in your zeal, O Maruts: they, rich in noble gifts,
rejoiced in Indra.  
With them together let the Vṛtra-slayer drink in his home the
worshipper's libation.  
10 So, Lord of affluent gifts, this juice hath been pressed for thee
with strength  
Drink of it, thou who lovest song.  
11 Incline thy body to this juice which suits thy Godlike nature well:  
May it cheer thee who lovest it.  
12 Brave Indra, let it work through both thy flanks, and through thy
head by prayer,  
And through thine arms, to prosper us.
