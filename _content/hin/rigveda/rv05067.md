### HYMN LXVII. Mitra-Varuṇa.

1\. YE Gods, Ādityas, Varuṇa, Aryaman, Mitra, verily  
Have here obtained supremest sway, high, holy, set apart for you.  
2 When, Varuṇa and Mitra, ye sit in your golden dwelling-place,  
Ye Twain, supporters of mankind, foeslayers, give felicity.  
3 All these, possessors of all wealth, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,  
Follow their ways, as if with feet, and guard from injury mortal man.  
4 For they are true, they cleave to Law, held holy among every race,  
Good leaders, bounteous in their gifts, deliverers even from distress.  
5 Which of your persons, Varuṇa or Mitra, merits not our praise?  
Therefore our thought is turned to you, the Atris' thought is turned to
you.
