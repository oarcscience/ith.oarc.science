### HYMN LIII. Agni Saucika Gods.

1\. HE hath arrived, he whom we sought with longing, who skilled in
sacrifice well knows its courses.  
Let him discharge his sacrificial duties: let him sit down as Friend who
was before  
Us.  
2 Best Priest, he hath been won by being seated, for he hath looked on
the well-ordered viands.  
Come, let usworship Gods who must be worshipped, and pouring oil, laud
those who should be lauded.  
3 Now hath he made the feast of Gods effective: now have we found the
secret tongue of worship.  
Now hath he come, sweet, robed in vital vigour, and made our calling on
the Gods effective.  
4 This prelude of my speech I now will utter, whereby we Gods may quell
our Asura foemen.  
Eaters of strengthening food who merit worship, O ye Five Tribes, be
pleased with mine oblation.  
5 May the Five Tribes be pleased with mine oblation, and the Cow's Sons
and all who merit worship.  
From earthly trouble may the earth protect us, and air's mid realm from
woe that comes from heaven.  
6 Spinning the thread, follow the region's splendid light: guard thou
the path ways well which wisdom hath prepared.  
Weave ye the knotless labour of the bards who sing: be Manu thou, and
bring the Heavenly People forth.  
7 Lovers of Soma, bind the chariot traces fast: set ye the reins in
order and embellish them.  
Bring hitherward the car with seats where eight may sit, whereon the
Gods have brought the treasure that we love.  
8 Here flows Asmanvati: hold fast each other, keep yourselves up, and
pass, my friends, the river.  
There let us leave the Powers that brought no profit, and cross the
flood to Powers that are auspicious.  
9 Tvaṣṭar, most deft of workmen, knew each magic art, bringing most
blessed bowls that hold the drink of Gods.  
His axe, wrought of good metal, he is sharpening now, wherewith the
radiant Brahmaṇaspati will cut.  
10 Now, O ye Sapient Ones, make ye the axes sharp wherewith ye fashion
bowls to hold the Amṛta.  
Knowing the secret places make ye ready that whereby the Gods have
gotten immortality.  
11 Ye with a secret tongue and dark intention laid the maiden deep
within, the calf within the mouth.  
They evermore are near us with their gracious help: successful is the
song that strives for victory.
