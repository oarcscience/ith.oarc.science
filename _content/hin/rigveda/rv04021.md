### HYMN XXI. Indra.

1\. MAY Indra come to us for our protection; here be the Hero, praised,
our feast-companion.  
May he whose powers are many, waxen mighty, cherish, like Dyaus, his own
supreme dominion.  
2 Here magnify his great heroic exploits, most glorious One, enriching
men with bounties,  
Whose will is like a Sovran in assembly, who rules the people,
Conqueror, all-surpassing.  
3 Hither let Indra come from earth or heaven, hither with speech from
firmament or ocean;  
With Maruts, from the realm of light to aid us, or from a distance, from
the seat of Order.  
4 That Indra will we laud in our assemblies, him who is Lord of great
and lasting riches,  
Victor with Vāyu where the herds are gathered, who leads with boldness
on to higher fortune.  
5 May the Priest, Lord of many blessings, striving,—who fixing reverence
on reverence, giving  
Vent to his voice, inciteth men to worship—with lauds bring Indra hither
to our dwellings.  
6 When sitting pondering in deep devotion in Auśija's abode they ply the
press-stone,  
May he whose wrath is fierce, the mighty bearer, come as the
house-lord's priest within our chambers.  
7 Surely the power of Bhārvara the mighty for ever helpeth to support
the singer;  
That which in Auśija's abode lies hidden, to come forth for delight and
for devotion.  
8 When he unbars the spaces of the mountains, and quickens with his
floods the water-torrents,  
He finds in lair the buffalo and wild-ox when the wise lead him on to
vigorous exploit.  
9 Auspicious are thy hands, thine arms well-fashioned which proffer
bounty, Indra, to thy praiser.  
What sloth is this? Why dost thou not rejoice thee? Why dost thou not
delight thyself with giving?  
10 So Indra is the truthful Lord of treasure. Freedom he gave to man by
slaying Vṛtra.  
Much-lauded! help us with thy power to riches: may I be sharer of thy
Godlike favour.  
11 Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell high,
like rivers, for the singer.  
For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays! is fashioned. May we, care-borne,
through song be victors ever.
