*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### HYMN LXXVII. Aśvins.

1\. FIRST worship those who come at early morning: let the Twain drink
before the giftless niggard.  
The Aśvins claim the sacrifice at daybreak: the sages yielding the first
share extol them.  
2 Worship at dawn and instigate the Aśvins: nor is the worshipper at eve
rejected.  
Besides ourselves another craves and worships: each first in worship is
most highly favoured.  
3 Covered with gold, meath-tinted, dropping fatness, your chariot with
its freight of food comes hither,  
Swift as thought, Aśvins, rapid as the tempest, wherewith ye travel over
all obstructions.  
4 He who hath served most often the Nāsatyas, and gives the sweetest
food at distribution,  
Furthers with his own holy works his offspring, and ever passes those
whose flames ascend not.  
5 May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their
health-bestowing happy guidance.  
Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy,
Immortals!
