### HYMN CXXXVIII. Pūṣan.

1\. STRONG Pūṣan's majesty is lauded evermore, the glory of his lordly
might is never faint, his song of praise is never faint.  
Seeking felicity I laud him nigh to help, the source, of bliss,  
Who, Vigorous one, hath drawn to him the hearts of all, drawn them, the
Vigorous One, the God.  
2 Thee, then, O Pūṣan, like a swift one on his way, I urge with lauds
that thou mayst make the foemen flee, drive, camel-like, our foes
afar.  
As I, a man, call thee, a God, giver of bliss, to be my Friend,  
So make our loudly-chanted praises glorious, in battles make them
glorious.  
3 Thou, Pūṣan, in whose friendship they who sing forth praise enjoy
advantage, even in wisdom, through thy grace, in wisdom even they are
advanced.  
So, after this most recent course, we come to thee with prayers for
wealth.  
Not stirred to anger, O Wide-Ruler, come to us, come thou to us in every
fight.  
4 Not stirred to anger, come, Free-giver, nigh to us, to take this gift
of ours, thou who hast goats for steeds, Goat-borne! their gift who long
for fame.  
So, Wonder-Worker! may we turn thee hither with effectual lauds.  
I slight thee not, O Pūṣan, thou Resplendent One: thy friendship may not
be despised.
