### HYMN XXIX. Soma Pavamana.

1\. FORWARD with mighty force have flowed the currents of this Steer
effused,  
Of him who sets him by the Gods.  
2 The singers praise him with their song, and learned priests adorn the
Steed,  
Brought forth as light that merits laud.  
3 These things thou winnest lightly while purified, Soma, Lord of
wealth:  
Fill full the sea that claims our praise.  
4 Winning all precious things at once, flow on, O Soma, with thy
stream  
Drive to one place our enemies.  
5 Preserve us from the godless, from ill-omened voice of one and all,  
That so we may be freed from blame.  
6 O Indu, as thou flowest on bring us the wealth of earth and heaven,  
And splendid vigour, in thy stream.
