### HYMN XVI. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THE pressers from the Soma-press send forth thy juice for rapturous
joy  
The speckled sap runs like a flood.  
2 With strength we follow through the sieve him who brings might and
wins the kine,  
Enrobed in water with his juice.  
3 Pour on the sieve the Soma, ne’er subdued in waters, waterless,  
And make it pure for Indra's drink.  
4 Moved by the purifier's thought, the Soma flows into the sieve:  
By wisdom it hath gained its home.  
5 With humble homage, Indra, have the Soma-drops flowed forth to thee,  
Contending for the glorious prize.  
6 Purified in his fleecy garb, attaining every beauty, he  
Stands, hero-like, amid the kine.  
7 Swelling, as ’twere, to heights of heaven, the stream of the creative
juice  
Falls lightly on the cleansing sieve.  
8 Thus, Soma, purifying himwho knoweth song mid living men,  
Thou wanderest through the cloth of wool.
