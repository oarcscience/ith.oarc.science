### HYMN XLI. Viśvedevas

1\. WHO, Mitra-Varuṇa, is your pious servant to give you gifts from
earth or mighty heaven?  
Preserve us in the seat of holy Order, and give the offerer power that
winneth cattle.  
2 May Mitra, Varuṇa, Aryaman, and Āyu, Indra Ṛbhukṣan, and the Maruts,
love us,  
And they who of one mind with bounteous Rudra accept the hymn and laud
with adorations.  
3 You will I call to feed the car-horse, Aśvins, with the wind's flight
swiftest of those who travel:  
Or also to the Asura of heaven, Worshipful, bring a hymn as ’twere
libation.  
4 The heavenly Victor, he whose priest is Kaṇva, Tṛta with Dyaus
accordant, Vāta, Agni,  
All-feeding Pūṣan, Bhaga sought the oblation, as they whose steeds are
fleetest seek the contest.  
5 Bring ye your riches forward borne on horses: let thought be framed
for help and gain of treasure.  
Blest he the priest of Auśija through courses, the courses which are
yours the fleet, O Maruts.  
6 Bring hither him who yokes the car, your Vāyu, who praises with his
songs, the God and Singer;  
And, praying and devout, noble and prudent, may the Gods’ Spouses in
their thoughts retain us.  
7 I speed to you with powers that should be honoured, with songs
distinguishing Heaven's mighty Daughters,  
Morning and Night, the Two, as ’twere all-knowing: these bring the
sacrifice unto the mortal.  
8 You I extol, the nourishers of heroes bringing you gifts, Vastospati
and Tvaṣṭar-  
Rich Dhiṣaṇā accords through our obeisance - andTrees and Plants, for
the swift gain of riches.  
9 Ours be the Parvatas, even they, for offspring, free-moving, who are
Heroes like the Vasus.  
May holy Āptya, Friend of man, exalted, strengthen our word for ever and
be near us.  
10 Tṛta praised him, germ of the earthly hero, with pure songs him the
Offspring of the Waters.  
Agn; with might neighs loudly like a charger: he of the flaming hair
destroys the forests.  
11 How shall we speak to the great might of Rudra? How speak to Bhaga
who takes thought for riches?  
May Plants, the Waters, and the Sky preserve us, and Woods and Mountains
with their trees for tresses.  
12 May the swift Wanderer, Lord of refreshments listen to our songs, who
speeds throuih cloudy heaven:  
And may the Waters, bright like castles, hear us, as they flow onward
from the cloven mountain.  
13 We know your ways, ye Mighty Ones receiving choice meed, ye
Wonderful, we will proclaim it.  
Even strong birds descend not to the mortal who strives to reach them
with swift blow and weapons.  
14 Celestial and terrestrial generations, and Waters will I summon to
the feasting.  
May days with bright dawns cause my songs to prosper, and may the
conquered streams increase their waters.  
15 Duly to each one hath my laud been offered. Strong be Varūtrī with
her powers to succour.  
May the great Mother Rasā here befriend us, straight-handed, with the
princes, striving forward.  
16 How may we serve the Liberal Ones with worship, the Maruts swift of
course in invocation, the Maruts far-renowned in invocation?  
Let not the Dragon of the Deep annoy us, and gladly may he welcome our
addresses.  
17 Thus thinking, O ye Gods, the mortal wins you to give him increase of
his herds of cattle: the mortal wins him, O ye Gods, your favour.  
Here he wins wholesome food to feed this body: as for mine old age,
Nirrti consume it  
18 O Gods, may we obtain from you this favour, strengthening food
through the Cow's praise, ye Vasus.  
May she who gives good gifts, the gracious Goddes. s, come speeding nigh
to us for our well-being.  
19 May Iḷā, Mother of the herds of cattle, and Urvasi with all the
streams accept us;  
May Urvasi in lofty heaven accepting, as she partakes the oblation of
the living,  
20 Visit us while she shares Urjavya's food.
