Heritage

### HYMN XXI. Agni.

1\. SET this our sacrifice among the Immortals: be pleased with these
our presents, Jātavedas.  
O Priest, O Agni, sit thee down before us, and first enjoy the drops of
oil and fatness.  
2 For thee, O Purifier, flow the drops of fatness rich in oil.  
After thy wont vouchsafe to us the choicest boon that Gods may feast.  
3 Agni, Most Excellent! for thee the Sage are drops that drip with
oil.  
Thou art enkindled as the best of Seers. Help thou the sacrifice.  
4 To thee, O Agni, mighty and resistless, to thee stream forth the drops
of oil and fatness.  
With great light art thou come, O praised by poets! Accept our offering,
O thou Sage.  
5 Fatness exceeding rich, extracted from the midst,—this as our gift we
offer thee.  
Excellent God, the drops run down upon thy skin. Deal them to each among
the Gods.
