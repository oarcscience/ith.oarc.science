### HYMN XII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. To Indra have the Soma drops, exceeding rich in sweets, been
poured,  
Shed in the seat of sacrifice.  
2 As mother kine low to their calves, to Indra have the sages called,  
Called him to drink the Soma juice.  
3 In the stream's wave wise Soma dwells, distilling rapture, in his
seat,  
Resting upon a wiId-cow's hide.  
4 Far-sighted Soma, Sage and Seer, is worshipped in the central point  
Of heaven, the straining-cloth of wool.  
5 In close embraces Indu holds Soma when  
poured within the jars.  
And on the. purifying sieve.  
6 Indu sends forth a voice on high to regions of the sea of air,  
Shaking the vase that drops with meath.  
7 The Tree whose praises never fail yields heavenly milk among our
hymns,  
Urging men's generations on.  
8 The Wise One, with the Sage's stream, the Soma urged to speed, flows
on  
To the dear places of the sky.  
9 O Pavamana, bring us wealth bright with a thousand splendours. Yea.  
O Indu, give us ready help.
