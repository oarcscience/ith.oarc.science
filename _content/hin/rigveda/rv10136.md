### HYMN CXXXVI. Kesins.

1\. HE with the long loose locks supports Agni, and moisture, heaven,
and earth:  
He is all sky to look upon: he with long hair is called this light.  
2 The Munis, girdled with the wind, wear garments soiled of yellow
hue.  
They, following the wind's swift course go where the Gods have gone
before.  
3 Transported with our Munihood we have pressed on into the winds:  
You therefore, mortal men. behold our natural bodies and no more.  
4 The Muni, made associate in the holy work of every God,  
Looking upon all varied forms flies through the region of the air.  
5 The Steed of Vāta, Vāyu's friend, the Muni, by the Gods impelled,  
In both the oceans hath his home, in eastern and in western sea.  
6 Treading the path of sylvan beasts, Gandharvas, and Apsarases,  
He with long locks, who knows the wish, is a sweet most delightful
friend  
7 Vāyu hath churned for him: for him he poundeth things most hard to
bend,  
When he with long loose locks hath drunk, with Rudra, water from the
cup.
