### HYMN I. Agni.

1\. HIGH hath the Mighty risen before the dawning, and come to us with
light from out the darkness.  
Fair-shapen Agni with white-shining splendour hath filled at birth all
human habitations.  
2 Thou, being born, art Child of Earth and Heaven, parted among the
plants in beauty, Agni!  
The glooms of night thou, Brilliant Babe, subduest, and art come forth,
loud roaring, from thy Mothers.  
3 Here, being manifested, lofty Viṣṇu, full wise, protects his own
supremest station.  
When they have offered in his mouth their sweet milk, to him with one
accord they sing forth praises.  
4 Thence bearing food the Mothers come to meet thee, with food for thee
who givest food its increase.  
These in their altered form again thou meetest. Thou art Invoking Priest
in homes of mortals.  
5 Priest of the holy rite, with car that glitters, refulgent Banner of
each act of worship,  
Sharinging every God through might and glory, even Agni Guest of men I
summon hither.  
6 So Agni stands on earth's most central station, invested in
well-decorated garments.  
Born, red of hue, where men pour out libations, O King, as great High
Priest bring the Gods hither.  
7 Over the earth and over heaven, O Agni, thou, Son, hast ever spread
above thy Parents.  
Come, Youthfullest! to those who long to meet thee, and hither bring the
Gods, O Mighty Victor.
