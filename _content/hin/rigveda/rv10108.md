### HYMN CVIII. Saramā. Paṇis.

1\. WHAT wish of Saramā hath brought her hither? The path leads far away
to distant places.  
What charge hast thou for us? Where turns thy journey? How hast thou
made thy way o’er Rasā's waters.  
2 I come appointed messenger of Indra, seeking your ample stores of
wealth, O Paṇis.  
This hath preserved me from the fear of crossing: thus have I made my
way o’er Rasā's waters.  
3 What is that Indra like, what is his aspect whose envoy, Saramā, from
afar thou comest?  
Let him approach, and we will show him friendship: he shall be made the
herdsman of our cattle.  
4 I know him safe from harm: but he can punish who sent me hither from
afar as envoy.  
Him rivers flowing with deep waters bide not. Low will ye be, O Paṇis,
slain by Indra.  
5 These are the kine which, Saramā, thou seekest, flying, O Blest One,
to the ends of heaven.  
Who will loose these for thee without a battle? Yea, and sharp-pointed
are our warlike weapons.  
6 Even if your wicked bodies, O ye Paṇis, were arrow-proof, your words
are weak for wounding;  
And were the path to you as yet unmastered, Bṛhaspati in neither case
will spare you.  
7 Paved with the rock is this our treasure-chamber; filled full of
precious things, of kine, and horses.  
These Paṇis who are watchful keepers guard it. In vain hast thou
approached this lonely station.  
8 Ṛṣis will come inspirited with Soma, Aṅgirases unwearied, and
Navagvas.  
This stall of cattle will they part among them: then will the Paṇis wish
these words unspoken.  
9 Even thus, O Saramā, hast thou come hither, forced by celestial might
to make the journey.  
Turn thee not back, for thou shalt be our sister: O Blest One, we will
give thee of the cattle.  
10 Brotherhood, sisterhood, I know not either: the dread Aṅgirases and
Indra know them.  
They seemed to long for kine when I departed. Hence, into distance, be
ye gone, O Paṇis.  
11 Hence, far away, ye Paṇis! Let the cattle lowing come forth as holy
Law commandeth,  
Kine which Bṛhaspati, and Soma, Ṛṣis, sages, and pressing-stones have
found when hidden.
