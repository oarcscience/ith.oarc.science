### HYMN CLXIX. Indra.

1\. As, Indra, from great treason thou protectest, yea, from great
treachery these who approach us,  
So, marking well, Controller of the Maruts grant us their blessings, for
they are thy dearest.  
2 The various doings of all mortal people by thee are ordered, in thy
wisdom, Indra.  
The host of Maruts goeth forth exulting to win the light-bestowing spoil
of battle.  
3 That spear of thine sat firm for us, O Indra: the Maruts set their
whole dread power in motion.  
E’en Agni shines resplendent in the brush-wood: the viands hold him as
floods hold an island.  
4 Vouchsafe us now that opulence, O Indra, as guerdon won by mightiest
donation.  
May hymns that please thee cause the breast of Vāyu to swell as with the
mead's refreshing sweetness.  
5 With thee, O Indra, are most bounteous riches that further every one
who lives uprightly.  
Now may these Maruts show us loving-kindness, Gods who of old were ever
prompt to help us.  
6 Bring forth the Men who rain down boons, O Indra: exert thee in the
great terrestrial region;  
For their broad-chested speckled deer are standing like a King's armies
on the field of battle.  
7 Heard is the roar of the advancing Maruts, terrific, glittering, and
swiftly moving,  
Who with their rush o’erthrow as ’twere a sinner the mortal who would
fight with those who love him  
8 Give to the Mānas, Indra with Maruts, gifts universal, gifts of cattle
foremost.  
Thou, God, art praised with Gods who must be lauded. May we find
strengthening food in full abundance.
