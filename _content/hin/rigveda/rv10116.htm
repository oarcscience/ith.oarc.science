<p>1. DRINK Soma juice for mighty power and vigour, drink, Strongest One, that thou mayst smite down V&#7771;tra.<br> Drink thou, invoked, for strength, and riches: drink thou thy fill of meath and pour it down, O Indra.<br> 2 Drink of the foodful juice stirred into motion, drink what thou choosest of the flowing Soma.<br> Giver of weal, be joyful in thy spirit, and turn thee hitherward to bless and prosper.<br> 3 Let heavenly Soma gladden thee, O Indra, let that effused among mankind delight thee.<br> Rejoice in that whereby thou gavest freedom, and that whereby thou conquerest thy foemen.<br> 4 Let Indra come, impetuous, doubly mighty, to the poured juice, the Bull, with two Bay Coursers.<br> With juices pressed in milk, with meath presented, glut evermore thy bolt, O Foe-destroyer.<br> 5 Dash down, outffaming their sharp flaming weapons, the strong-holds of the men urged on by demons.<br> I give thee, Mighty One, great strength and conquest: go, meet thy foes and rend them in the battle.<br> 6 Extend afar the votary's fame and glory, as the firm archer's strength drives off the foeman.<br> Ranged on our side, grown strong in might that conquers, never defeated, still increase thy body.<br> 7 To thee have we presented this oblation: accept it, Sovran Ruler, free from anger.<br> Juice, Maghavan, for thee is pressed and ripened: eat, Indra, drink of that which stirs to meet thee.<br> 8 Eat, Indra, these oblations which approach thee: be pleased with food made ready and with Soma.<br> With entertainment we receive thee friendly: effectual be the sacrificer's wishes.<br> 9 I send sweet speech to Indra and to Agni: with hymns I speed it like a boat through waters.<br> Even thus, the Gods seem moving round about me, the fountains and bestowers of our riches.</p>
