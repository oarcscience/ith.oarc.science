### HYMN XV. Agni.

1\. RESPLENDENT with thy wide-extending lustre, dispel the terrors of
the fiends who hate us  
May lofty Agni be my guide and shelter, the easily-invoked, the good
Protector.  
2 Be thou To us, while now the morn is breaking, be thou a guardian when
the Sun hath mounted..  
Accept, as men accept a true-born infant, my laud, O Agni nobly born in
body.  
3 Bull, who beholdest men, through many mornings, among the dark ones
shine forth red, O Agni.  
Lead us, good Lord, and bear us over trouble: Help us who long, Most
Youthful God, to riches.  
4 Shine forth, a Bull invincible, O Agni, winning by conquest all the
forts and treasures,  
Thou Jātavedas who art skilled in guiding, the chief high saving
sacrifice's Leader.  
5 Lighting Gods hither, Agni, wisest Singer, bring thou to us many and
flawless shelters.  
Bring vigour, like a car that gathers booty: bring us, O Agni, beauteous
Earth and Heaven.  
6 Swell, O thou Bull and give those powers an impulse, e’en Earth and
Heaven who yield their milk in plenty,  
Shining, O God, with Gods in clear effulgence. Let not a mortal's evil
will obstruct us.  
7 Agni, as holy food to thine invoker, give wealth in cattle, lasting,
rich in marvels.  
To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious
will to us-ward.
