### HYMN LX. Agni.

1\. O AGNI, with thy mighty wealth guard us from all malignity,  
Yea, from all hate of mortal man.  
2 For over thee, O Friend from birth, the wrath of man hath no
control:  
Nay, Guardian of the earth art thou.  
3 As such, with all the Gods, O Son of Strength, auspicious in thy
flame.  
Give us wealth bringing all things good.  
4 Malignities stay not from wealth the mortal man whom, Agni, thou  
Protectest while he offers gifts.  
5 Sage Agni, be whom thou dost urge, in worship of the Gods, to
wealth,  
With thine assistance winneth kine.  
6 Riches with many heroes thou hast for the man who offers gifts:  
Lead thou us on to higher bliss.  
7 Save us, O Jātavedas, nor abandon us to him who sins,  
Unto the evil-hearted man.  
8 O Agni, let no godless man avert thy bounty as a God:  
Over all treasures thou art Lord.  
9 So, Son of Strength, thou aidest us to what is great and excellent.  
Those, Vasu! Friend! who sing thy praise.  
10 Let our songs come anear to him beauteous and bright with piercing
flame  
Our offerings, with our homage, to the  
Lord of wealth, to him whom many praise, for help:  
11 To Agni Jātavedas, to the Son of Strength, that he may give us
precious gifts,  
Immortal, from of old Priest among mortal men, the most delightful in
the house.  
12 Agni, made yours by sacrifice, Agni, while holy rites advance;  
Agni, the first in songs, first with the warrior steed; Agni to win the
land for us.  
13 May Agni who is Lord of wealth vouchsafe us food for friendship
sake.  
Agni we ever seek for seed and progeny, the Vasu who protects our
lives.  
14 Solicit with your chants, for help, Agni the God with piercing
flame,  
For riches famous Agni, Purumīlha and ye men! Agni to light our dwelling
well.  
15 Agni we laud that he may keep our foes afar, Agni to give us health
and strength.  
Let him as Guardian be invoked in all the tribes, the lighter-up of
glowing brands.
