### HYMN VI. Agni.

1\. HE who seeks furtherance and grace to help him goes to the Son of
Strength with newest worship,  
Calling the heavenly Priest to share the banquet, who rends the wood,
bright, with his blackened pathway.  
2 White-hued and thundering he dwells in splendour, Most Youthful, with
the loudvoiced and eternal-  
Agni, most variform, the Purifier, who follows crunching many ample
forests.  
3 Incited by the wind thy flames, O Agni, move onward, Pure One! pure,
in all directions.  
Thy most destructive heavenly Navagvas break the woods down and
devastate them boldly.  
4 Thy pure white horses from their bonds are loosened: O Radiant One,
they shear the ground beneath them,  
And far and wide shines out thy flame, and flickers rapidly moving over
earth's high ridges.  
5 Forth darts the Bull's tongue like the sharp stone weapon discharged
by him who fights to win the cattle.  
Agni's fierce flame is like a hero's onset: dread and resistless he
destroys the forests.  
6 Thou with the sunlight of the great Impeller hast boldly over-spread
the earth's expanses.  
So drive away with conquering might all perils. fighting out foemen burn
up those who harm us.  
7 Wondrous! of wondrous power! give to the singer wealth wondrous,
marked, most wonderful, life-giving.  
Wealth bright, O Bright One, vast, with many heroes, give with thy
bright flames to the man who lauds thee.
