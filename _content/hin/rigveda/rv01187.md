### HYMN CLXXXVII. Praise of Food.

1\. Now will I glorify Food that upholds great strength,  
By whose invigorating power Trita rent Vṛtra limb from limb.  
2 O pleasant Food, O Food of meath, thee have we chosen for our own,  
So be our kind protector thou.  
3 Come hitherward to us, O Food, auspicious with auspicious help,  
Health-bringing, not unkind, a dear and guileless friend.  
4 These juices which, O Food, are thine throughout the regions are
diffused.  
like winds they have their place in heaven.  
5 These gifts of thine, O Food, O Food most sweet to taste,  
These savours of thy juices work like creatures that have mighty
necks.  
6 In thee, O Food, is set the spirit of great Gods.  
Under thy flag brave deeds were done he slew the Dragon with thy help.  
7 If thou be gone unto the splendour of the clouds,  
Even from thence, O Food of meath, prepared for our enjoyment, come.  
8 Whatever morsel we consume from waters or from plants of earth, O
Soma, wax thou fat thereby.  
9 What Soma, we enjoy from thee in milky food or barley-brew, Vātāpi,
grow thou fat thereby.  
10 O Vegetable, Cake of meal, he wholesome, firm, and strengthening:
Vātāpi, grow thou fat thereby.  
11 O Food, from thee as such have we drawn forth with lauds, like cows,
our sacrificial gifts,  
From thee who banquetest with Gods, from thee who banquetest with us.
