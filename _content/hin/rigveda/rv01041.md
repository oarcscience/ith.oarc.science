### HYMN XLI. Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman.

1 NE’ER is he injured whom the Gods Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman,  
The excellently wise, protect.  
2 He prospers ever, free from scathe, whom they, as with full hands,
enrich,  
Whom they preserve from every foe.  
3 The Kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies,  
And lead him safely o’er distress.  
4 Thornless, Ādityas, is the path, easy for him who seeks the Law:  
With him is naught to anger you.  
5 What sacrifice, Ādityas, ye Heroes guide by the path direct,—  
May that come nigh unto your thought.  
6 That mortal, ever unsubdued, gains wealth and every precious thing,  
And children also of his own.  
7 How, my friends, shall we prepare Aryaman's and Mitra's laud,  
Glorious food of Varuṇa?  
8 I point not out to you a man who strikes the pious, or reviles:  
Only with hymns I call you nigh.  
9 Let him not love to speak ill words: but fear the One who holds all
four  
Within his hand, until they fall.
