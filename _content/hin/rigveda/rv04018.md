### HYMN XVIII. Indra and Others.

1\. THIS is the ancient and accepted pathway by which all Gods have come
into existence.  
Hereby could one be born though waxen mighty. Let him not, otherwise,
destroy his Mother.  
2 Not this way go I forth: hard is the passage. Forth from the side
obliquely will I issue.  
Much that is yet undone must I accomplish; one must I combat and the
other question.  
3 He bent his eye upon the dying Mother: My word I now withdraw. That
way I follow.  
In Tvaṣṭar's dwelling India drank the Soma, a hundredworth of juice
pressed from the mortar.  
4 What strange act shall he do, he whom his Mother bore for a thousand
months and many autumns?  
No peer hath he among those born already, nor among those who shall be
born hereafter.  
5 Deeming him a reproach, his mother hid him, Indra, endowed with all
heroic valour.  
Then up he sprang himself, assumed his vesture, and filled, as soon as
born, the earth and heaven.  
6 With lively motion onward flow these waters, the Holy Ones, shouting,
as ’twere, together.  
Ask them to. tell thee what the floods are saying, what girdling rock
the waters burst asunder.  
7 Are they addressing him with words of welcome? Will the floods take on
them the shame of Indra?  
With his great thunderbolt my Son hath slaughtered Vṛtra, and set these
rivers free to wander.  
8 I cast thee from me, mine,—thy youthful mother: thee, mine own
offspring, Kusava hath swallowed.  
To him, mine infant, were the waters gracious. Indra, my Son, rose up in
conquering vigour.  
9 Thou art mine own, O Maghavan, whom Vyaṁsa struck to the ground and
smote thy jaws in pieces.  
But, smitten through, the mastery thou wonnest, and with thy bolt the
Dāsa's head thou crushedst.  
10 The Heifer hath brought forth the Strong, the Mighty, the
unconquerable Bull, the furious Indra.  
The Mother left her unlicked Calf to wander, seeking himself, the path
that he would follow.  
11 Then to her mighty Child the Mother turned her, saying, My son, these
Deities forsake thee.  
Then Indra said, about to slaughter Vṛtra, O my friend Vṛtra, stride
full boldly forward.  
12 Who was he then who made thy Mother widow? Who sought to stay thee
lying still or moving?  
What God, when by the foot thy Sire thou tookest and slewest, was at
hand to give thee comfort?  
13 In deep distress I cooked a dog's intestines. Among the Gods I found
not one to comfort.  
My consort I beheld in degradation. The Falcon then brought me the
pleasant Soma.
