### HYMN IX. Waters.

1\. YE, Waters, are beneficent: so help ye us to energy  
That we may look on great delight.  
2 Give us a portion of the sap, the most auspicious that ye have,  
Like mothers in their longing love.  
3 To you we gladly come for him to whose abode ye send us on;  
And, Waters, give us procreant strength.  
4 The Waters. be to us for drink, Goddesses for our aid and bliss:  
Let them stream to us health and strength.  
5 1 beg the Floods to give us balm, these Queens who rule o’er precious
things,  
And have supreme control of men.  
6 Within the Waters-Soma thus hath told me-dwell all balms that heal,  
And Agni, he who blesseth all.  
7 O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm,  
So that I long may see the Sun.  
8 Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought,  
If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me.  
9 The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we
come:  
O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.
