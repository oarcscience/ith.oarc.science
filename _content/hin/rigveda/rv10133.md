### HYMN CXXXIII. Indra.

1\. SING strength to Indra that shall set his chariot in the foremost
place.  
Giver of room in closest fight, slayer of foes in shock of war, be thou
our great encourager. Let the weak bowstrings break upon the bows of
feeble enemies.  
2 Thou didst destroy the Dragon: thou sentest the rivers down to
earth.  
Foeless, O Indra, wast thou born. Thou tendest well each choicest thing.
Therefore we draw us close to thee. Let the weak bowstrings break upon
the bows of feeble enemies.  
3 Destroyed be all malignities and all our enemy's designs.  
Thy bolt thou castest, at the foe, O Indra, who would srnite us dead:
thy liberal bounty gives us wealth.  
4 The robber people round about, Indra, who watch and aim at us,—  
Trample them down beneath thy foot; a conquering scatterer art thou.  
5 Whoso assails us, Indra, be the man a stranger or akin,  
Bring down, thyself, his strength although it be as vast as are the
heavens.  
6 Close to thy friendship do we cling, O Indra, and depend, or, thee.  
Lead us beyond all pain and grief along the path of holy Law.  
7 Do thou bestow upon us her, O Indra, who yields according to the
singer's longing,  
That the great Cow may, with exhaustless udder, pouring a thousand
streams, give milk to feed us.
