### HYMN XCVI. Agni.

1\. HE in the ancient way by strength engendered, lo! straight hath
taken to himself all wisdom.  
The waters and the bowl have made him friendly. The Gods possessed the
wealth bestowing Agni.  
2 At Āyu's ancient call he by his wisdom gave all this progeny of men
their being,  
And, by refulgent light, heaven and the waters. The Gods possessed the
wealth. bestowing Agni.  
3 Praise him, ye Āryan folk, as chief performer of sacrifice adored and
ever toiling,  
Well-tended, Son of Strength, the Constant Giver. The Gods possessed the
wealth bestowing Agni.  
4 That Mātariśvan rich in wealth and treasure, light-winner, finds a
pathway for his offspring.  
Guard of our folk, Father of earth and heaven. The Gods possessed the
wealth bestowing Agni.  
5 Night and Dawn, changing each the other's colour, meeting together
suckle one same Infant:  
Golden between the heaven and earth he shineth. The Gods possessed the
wealth bestowing Agni.  
6 Root of wealth, gathering-place of treasures, banner of sacrifice, who
grants the suppliant's wishes:  
Preserving him as their own life immortal, the Gods possessed the
wealth-bestowing Agni.  
7 Now and of old the home of wealth, the mansion of what is born and
what was born aforetime,  
Guard of what is and what will be hereafter,—the Gods possessed the
wealth bestowing Agni.  
8 May the Wealth-Giver grant us conquering riches; may the Wealth-Giver
grant us wealth with heroes.  
May the Wealth-Giver grant us food with offspring, and length of days
may the Wealth-Giver send us.  
9 Fed with our fuel, purifying Agni, so blaze to us auspiciously for
glory.  
This prayer of ours may Varuṇa grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu,
Earth and Heaven.
