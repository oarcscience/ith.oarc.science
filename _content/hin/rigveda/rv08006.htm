<p>1. INDRA, great in his power and might, and like Parjanya rich in rain,<br> Is magnified by Vatsa's lauds.<br> 2 When the priests, strengthening the Son of Holy Law, present their gifts,<br> Singers with Order's hymn of praiser.<br> 3 Since Ka&#7751;vas with their lauds have made Indra complete the sacrifice.<br> Words are their own appropriate arms.<br> 4 Before his hot displeasure all the peoples, all the men, bow down,<br> As rivers bow them to the sea.<br> 5 This power of his shone brightly forth when Indra brought together, like<br> A skin, the worlds of heaven and earth.<br> 6 The fiercely-moving V&#7771;tra's head he severed with his thunderbolt,<br> His mighty hundred-knotted bolt.<br> 7 Here are-we sing them loudly forth-our thoughts among-the best of songs.<br> Even lightnings like the blaze of fire.<br> 8 When bidden thoughts, spontaneously advancing, glow, and with the stream<br> Of sacrifice the Ka&#7751;vas shine.<br> 9 Indra, may we obtain that wealth in horses and in herds of cows,<br> And prayer that may be noticed first.<br> 10 I from my Father have received deep knowledge of the Holy Law<br> I was born like unto the Sun.<br> 11 After the lore of ancient time I make, like Ka&#7751;va, beauteous songs,<br> And Indra's selfgains strength thereby.<br> 12 Whatever &#7770;&#7779;is have not praised thee, Indra, or have lauded thee,<br> By me exalted wax thou strong.<br> 13 When his wrath thundered, when he rent V&#7771;tra to pieces, limb by limb,<br> He sent the waters to the sea.<br> 14 Against the Dasyu gusna thou, Indra, didst hurl thy during bolt:<br> Thou, Dread one, hast a hero's fame.<br> 15 Neither the heavens nor firmaments nor regions of the earth contain<br> Indra, the Thunderer with his might.<br> 16 O Indra him who lay at length staying thy copious waters thou,<br> In his own footsteps, smotest down<br> 17 Thou hiddest deep in darkness itim, O Indra, who had set his grasp<br> On spacious heaven and earth conjoined.<br> 18 Indra, whatever Yatis and Bh&#7771;gus have offered praise to thee,<br> Listen, thou Mighty, to my call.<br> 19 Indra, these spotted cows yield thee their butter and the milky draught;<br> Aiders, thereby, of sacrifice;<br> 20 Which, teeming, have received thee as a life-germ, Indra, with their mouth,<br> Like S&#363;rya who sustaineth all.<br> 21 O Lord of Might, with hymns of praise the Ka&#7751;vas have increased thy power,<br> The drops poured forth have strengthened thee.<br> 22 Under thy guidance, Indra, mid thy praises, Lord of Thunder, shall<br> The sacrifice be soon performed.<br> 23 Indra, disclose much food for us, like a stronghold with store of kine:<br> Give progeny and heroic strength.<br> 24 And, Indra, grant us all that wealth of fleet steeds which shone bright of old<br> Among the tribes of Nahusas.<br> 25 Hither thou seemest to attract heaven's fold which shines before our eyes,<br> When, Indra, thou art kind to us.<br> 26 Yea, when thou puttest forth thy power, Indra, thou governest the folk.<br> Mighty, unlimited in strength.<br> 27 The tribes who bring oblations call to thee, to thee to give them help,<br> With drops to thee who spreadest far.<br> 28 There where the mountains downward slope, there by the meeting of the streams<br> The Sage was manifest with song.<br> 29 Thence, marking, from his lofty place downward he looks upon the sea,<br> And thence with rapid stir he moves.<br> 30 Then, verify, they see the light refulgent of primeval seed,<br> Kindled on yonder side of heaven.<br> 31 Indra, the Ka&#7751;vas all exalt thy wisdom and thy manly power,<br> And, Mightiest! thine heroic strength.<br> 32 Accept this eulogy of mine, Indra, and guard me carefully:<br> Strengthen my thought and prosper it.<br> 33 For thee, O Mighty, Thunder-armed, we singers through devotionhave<br> Fashioned the hymn that we may live.<br> 34 To Indra have the Ka&#7751;vas sung, like waters speeding down a slope:<br> The song is fain to go to him.<br> 35 As rivers swell the ocean, so our hymns of praise make Indra strong,<br> Eternal, of resistIess wrath.<br> 36 Come with thy lovely Bay Steeds, come to us from regions far away<br> O Indra, drink this Soma juice.<br> 37 Best slayer of V&#7771;tras, men whose sacred grass is ready trimmed<br> Invoke thee for the gain of spoil.<br> 38 The heavens and earth come after thee as the wheel follows Eta&#347;a:<br> To thee flow Soma-drops effused.<br> 39 Rejoice, O Indra, in the light, rejoice in Saryandyan, be Glad in the sacrificer's hymn.<br> 40 Grown strong in heaven, the Thunder-armed hath bellowed, V&#7771;tra-slayer, Bull,<br> Chief drinker of the Soma juice.<br> 41 Thou art a &#7770;&#7779;i born of old, sole Ruler over all by might:<br> Thou, Indra, guardest well our wealth.<br> 42 May thy Bay Steeds with beauteous backs, a hundred, bring thee to the feast,<br> Bring thee to these our Soma-draughts.<br> 43 The Ka&#7751;vas with their hymns of praise have magnified this ancient thought<br> That swells with streams of meath and oil.<br> 44 Mid mightiest Gods let mortal man choose Indra at the sacrifice,<br> Indra, whoe&#146;er would win, for help.<br> 45 Thy steeds, by Priyamedhas praised, shall bring thee, God whom all invoke,<br> Hither to drink the Somajuice.<br> 46 A hundred thousand have I gained from Parsu, from Tirindira,<br> And presents of the Yadavas.<br> 47 Ten thousand head of kine, and steeds three times a hundred they bestowed<br> On Pajra for the S&#257;ma-song.<br> 48 Kakuha hath reached up to heaven, bestowing buffaloes yoked in fours,<br> And matched in fame the Yadavas.</p>
