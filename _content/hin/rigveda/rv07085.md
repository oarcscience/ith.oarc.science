### HYMN LXXXV. Indra-Varuṇa.

1\. FOR you I deck a harmless hymn, presenting the Soma juice to Varuṇa
and Indra-  
A hymn that shines like heavenly Dawn with fatness. May they be near us
on the march and guard us.  
2 Here where the arrows fall amid the banners both hosts invoke the Gods
in emulation.  
O Indra-Varuṇa, smite back those-our foemen,yea, smite them withyour
shaft to every quarter.  
3 Self-lucid in their seats, e’en heavenly Waters endowed with Godhead
Varuṇa and Indra.  
One of these holds the folk distinct and sundered, the Other smites and
slays resistless foemen.  
4 Wise be the priest and skilled in Law Eternal, who with his sacred
gifts and oration.  
Brings you to aid us with your might, Ādityas: let him have viands to
promote his welfare.  
5 May this my song reach Varuṇa and Indra, and, strongly urging, win me
sons and offspring.  
To the Gods’ banquet may we go with riches. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods with blessings.
