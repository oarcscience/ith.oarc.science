### HYMN IV Agni.

1\. FOR you I call the glorious refulgent Agni, the guest of men, rich
in oblations  
Whom all must strive to win even as a lover, God among godly people,
Jātavedas.  
2 Bhṛgus who served him in the home of waters set him of old in houses
of the living.  
Over all worlds let Agni be the Sovran, the messenger of Gods with rapid
coursers.  
3 Among the tribes of men the Gods placed Agni as a dear Friend when
they would dwell among them.  
Against the longing nights may he shine brightly, and show the offerer
in the house his vigour.  
4 Sweet is his growth as of one's own possessions; his look when rushing
fain to burn is lovely.  
He darts his tongue forth, like a harnessed courser who shakes his
flowing tail, among the bushes.  
5 Since they who honour me have praised my greatness,—he gave, as
’twere, his hue to those who love him.  
Known is he by his bright delightful splendour, and waxing old renews
his youth for ever.  
6 Like one athirst, he lighteth up the forests; like water down the
chariot ways he roareth.  
On his black path he shines in burning beauty, marked as it were the
heaven that smiles through vapour.  
7 Around, consuming the broad earth, he wanders, free roaming like an ox
without a herdsman,—  
Agni refulgent, burning up the bushes, with blackened lines, as though
the earth he seasoned.  
8 I, in remembrance of thine ancient favour have sung my hymn in this
our third assembly.  
O Agni, give us wealth with store of heroes and mighty strength in food
and noble offspring.  
9 May the Gṛtsamadas, serving in secret, through thee, O Agni, overcome
their neighbours,  
Rich in good heroes and subduing foemen. That vital power give thou to
chiefs and singers.
