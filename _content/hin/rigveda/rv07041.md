Heritage

### HYMN XLI. Bhaga.

1\. AGNI at dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuṇa and Mitra, and
the Aśvins twain.  
Bhaga at dawn, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, Soma at dawn, Rudra we will
invoke at dawn.  
2 We will invoke strong, early-conquering Bhaga, the Son of Aditi, the
great supporter:  
Thinking of whom, the poor, yea, even the mighty, even the King himself
says, Give me Bhaga.  
3 Bhaga our guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this song, and
give us wealth, O Bhaga.  
Bhaga, augment our store of kine and horses, Bhaga, may we be rich in
men and heroes.  
4 So may felicity be ours at present, and when the day approaches, and
at noontide;  
And may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in the Deities'
loving-kindness.  
5 May Bhaga verily be bliss-bestower, and through him, Gods! may
happiness attend us.  
As such, O Bhaga, all with might invoke thee: as such be thou our
Champion here, O Bhaga.  
6 To this our worship may all Dawns incline them, and come to the pure
place like Dadhikrāvan.  
As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring us hitherward Bhaga who
discovers treasure.  
7 May blessed Mornings dawn on us for ever, with wealth of kine, of
horses, and of heroes,  
Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness. Preserve us evermore, ye
Gods, with blessings.
