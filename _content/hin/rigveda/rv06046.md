### HYMN XLVI. Indra.

1\. THAT we may win us wealth and power we poets, verily, call on
thee:  
In war men call on thee, Indra, the hero's Lord, in the steed's
race-course call on thee.  
2 As such, O Wonderful, whose hand holds thunder, praised as mighty,
Caster of the Stone!  
Pour on us boldly, Indra, kine and chariotsteeds, ever to be the
conqueror's strength.  
3 We call upon that Indra, who, most active, ever slays the foe:  
Lord of the brave, Most Manly, with a thousand powers, help thou and
prosper us in fight.  
4 Rcisama, thou forcest men as with a bull, with anger, in the furious
fray.  
Be thou our Helper in the mighty battle fought for sunlight, water, and
for life.  
5 O Indra, bring us name and fame, enriching, mightiest, excellent,  
Wherewith, O Wondrous God, fair-visored, thunder-armed, thou hast filled
full this earth and heaven.  
6 We call on thee, O King, Mighty amid the Gods, Ruler of men, to
succour us.  
All that is weak in us, Excellent God, make firm: make our foes easy to
subdue.  
7 All strength and valour that is found, Indra, in tribes of Nahusas,
and all the splendid fame that the Five Tribes enjoy  
Bring, yea, all manly powers at once.  
8 Or, Maghavan, what vigorous strength in Trksi lay, in Druhyus or in
Paru's folk,  
Fully bestow on us, that, in the conquering fray, we may subdue our foes
in fight.  
9 O Indra, grant a happy home, a triple refuge triply strong.  
Bestow a dwelling-place on the rich lords and me, and keep thy dart afar
from these.  
10 They who with minds intent on spoil subdue the foe, boldly attack and
smite him down,—  
From these, O Indra Maghavan who lovest song, be closest guardian of our
lives.  
11 And now, O Indra, strengthen us: come near and aid us in the fight,  
What time the feathered shafts are flying in the air, the arrows with
their sharpened points.  
12 Give us, where heroes strain their bodies in the fight, the shelter
that our fathers loved.  
To us and to our sons give refuge: keep afar all unobserved hostility.  
13 When, Indra, in the mighty fray thou urgest chargers to their
speed,  
On the uneven road and on a toilsome path, like falcons, eager for
renown,  
14 Speeding like rivers rushing down a steep descent, responsive to the
urging call,  
That come like birds attracted to the bait, held in by reins in both the
driver's hands.
