### HYMN XLIL Indra-Varuṇa.

1\. I AM the royal Ruler, mine is empire, as mine who sway all life are
all Immortals.  
Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most
lofty cover.  
2 I am King Varuṇa. To me were given these first existing high celestial
powers.  
Varuṇa's will the Gods obey and follow. I am the King of men's most
lofty cover.  
3 I Varuṇa am Indra: in their greatness, these the two wide deep
fairly-fashioned regions,  
These the two world-halves have I, even as Tvaṣṭar knowing all beings,
joined and held together.  
4 I made to flow the moisture-shedding waters, and set the heaven firm
in the scat of Order.  
By Law the Son of Aditi, Law Observer, hath spread abroad the world in
threefold measure.  
5 Heroes with noble horses, fain for battle, selected warriors, call on
me in combat.  
I Indra Maghavan, excite the conflict; I stir the dust, Lord of
surpassing vigour.  
6 All this I did. The Gods’ own conquering power never impedeth me whom
none opposeth.  
When lauds and Soma juice have made me joyful, both the unbounded
regions are affrighted.  
7 All beings know these deeds of thine thou tellest this unto Varuṇa,
thou great Disposer!  
Thou art renowned as having slain the Vṛtras. Thou madest flow the
floods that were obstructed.  
8 Our fathers then were these, the Seven his, what time the son of
Durgaha was captive.  
For her they gained by sacrifice Trasadasyu, a demi-god, like Indra,
conquering foemen.  
9 The spouse of Purukutsa gave oblations to you, O Indra-Varuṇa, with
homage.  
Then unto her ye gave King Trasadasyu, the demi-god, the slayer of the
foeman.  
10 May we, possessing much, delight in riches, Gods in oblations and the
kine in pasture;  
And that Milch-cow who shrinks not from the milking, O Indra-Varuṇa,
give to us daily.
