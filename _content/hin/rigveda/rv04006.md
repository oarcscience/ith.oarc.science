### HYMN VI. Agni.

1\. PRIEST of our rite, stand up erect, O Agni, in the Gods’ service
best of sacrificers,  
For over evei y thought thou art the Ruler: thou furtherest e’en the
wisdom of the pious.  
2 He was set down mid men as Priest unerring, Agni, wise, welcome in our
holy synods.  
Like Savitar he hath lifted up his splendour, and like a builder raised
his smoke to heaven.  
3 The glowing ladle, filled with oil, is lifted; choosing Gods’ service
to the right he circles.  
Eager he rises like the new-wrought pillar which, firmly set and fixed,
anoints the victims.  
4 When sacred grass is strewn and Agni kindled, the Adhvaryu rises to,
his task rejoicing.  
Agni the Priest, like one who tends the cattle, goes three times round,
as from of old he wills it.  
5 Agni himself, the Priest, with measured motion, goes round, with sweet
speech, cheerful, true to Order.  
His fulgent flames run forth like vigorous horses; all creatures are
affrighted when he blazes.  
6 Beautiful and auspicious is thine aspect, O lovely Agni, terrible when
spreading.  
Thy splendours are not covered by the darkness: detraction leaves no
stain upon thy body.  
7 Naught hindered his production, Bounteous Giver: his Mother and his
Sire were free to send him.  
Then as Friend benevolent, refulgent, Agni shone forth in human
habitations.  
8 He, Agni, whom the twice-five sisters, dwelling together, in the homes
of men engendered,  
Bright like a spear's tooth, wakened in the morning, with powerful mouth
and like an axe well-sharpened.  
9 These thy Bay Coursers, Agni, dropping fatness, ruddy vigorous,
speeding straightly forward,  
And red steeds, wonderful, of mighty muscle, are to this service of the
Gods invited:  
10 These brightly-shining games of thine, O Agni, that move for ever
restless, all-subduing,  
Like falcons hasting eagerly to the quarry, roar loudly like the army of
the Maruts.  
11 To thee, O flaming God, hath prayer been offered. Let the priest laud
thee: give to him who worships.  
Men have established Agni as Invoker, fain to adore the glory of the
living.
