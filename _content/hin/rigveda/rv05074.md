### HYMN LXXIV. Aśvins.

1\. WHERE in the heavens are ye to-day, Gods, Aśvins, rich in
constancy?  
Hear this, ye excellent as Steers: Atri inviteth you to come.  
2 Where are they now? Where are the Twain, the famed Nāsatyas, Gods in
heaven?  
Who is the man ye strive to reach? Who of your suppliants is with you?  
3 Whom do ye visit, whom approach? to whom direct your harnessed car?  
With whose devotions are ye pleased? We long for you to further us.  
4 Ye, Strengtheners, for Paura stir the filler swimming in the flood,  
Advancing to be captured like a lion to the ambuscade.  
5 Ye from cyavana worn with age removed his skin as ’twere a robe.  
So, when ye made him young again, he stirred the longing of a dame.  
6 Here is the man who lauds you both: to see your glory are we here.  
Now bear me, come with saving help, ye who are rich in store of
wealth.  
7 Who among many mortal men this day hath won you to himself?  
What bard, accepters of the bard? Who, rich in wealth! with sacrifice?  
8 O Aśvins, may your car approach, most excellent of cars for speed.  
Through many regions may our praise pass onward among mortal men.  
9 May our laudation of you Twain, lovers of meath! be sweet to you.  
Fly hitherward, ye wise of heart, like falcons with your winged
steeds.  
10 O Aśvins, when at any time ye listen to this call of mine,  
For you is dainty food prepared: they mix refreshing food for you.
