### HYMN CLXIII

1\. FROM both thy nostrils, from thine eyes, from both thine ears and
from thy chin,  
Forth from thy head and brain and tongue I drive thy malady away.  
2 From the neck-tendons and the neck, from the breast-bones and from the
spine,  
From shoulders, upper, lower arms, I drive thy malady away.  
3 From viscera and all within, forth from the rectum, from the heart,  
From kidneys, liver, and from spleen, I drive thy malady away.  
4 From thighs, from knee-caps, and from heels, and from the forepart of
the feet,  
From hips from stomach, and from groin I drive thy malady away.  
5 From what is voided from within, and from thy hair, and from they
nails,  
From all thyself from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.  
6 From every member, every hair, disease that comes in every joint,  
From all thyself, from top to toe, I drive thy malady away.
