### HYMN LXIII. Indra.

1\. THOU art the Mighty One; when born, O Indra, with power thou
terrifiedst earth and heaven;  
When, in their fear of thee, all firm-set mountains and monstrous
creatures shook like dust before thee.  
2 When thy two wandering Bays thou drawest hither, thy praiser laid
within thine arms the thunder,  
Wherewith, O Much-invoked, in will resistless, thou smitest foemen down
and many a castle.  
3 Faithful art thou, these thou defiest, Indra; thou art the Ṛbhus'
Lord, heroic, victor.  
Thou, by his side, for young and glorious Kutsa, with steed and car in
battle slewest Śuṣṇa,  
4 That, as a friend, thou furtheredst, O Indra, when, Thunderer, strong
in act, thou crushedst Vṛtra;  
When, Hero, thou, great-souled, with easy conquest didst rend the Dasyus
in their  
distant dwelling.  
5 This doest thou, and art not harmed, O Indra, e’en in the anger of the
strongest mortal.  
Lay thou the race-course open for our horses: as with a club, slay,
Thunder-armed! our foemen.  
6 Hence men invoke thee, Indra, in the tumult of battle, in the
light-bestowing conflict.  
This aid of thine, O Godlike One, was ever to be implored in deeds of
might in combat.  
7 Warring for Purukutsa thou, O Indra, Thunder-armed! breakest down the
seven castles;  
Easily, for Sudās, like grass didst rend them, and out of need, King,
broughtest gain to Pūru.  
8 O Indra, God who movest round about us, feed us with varied food
plenteous as water—  
Food wherewithal, O Hero, thou bestowest vigour itself to flow to us for
ever.  
9 Prayers have been made by Gotamas, O Indra, addressed to thee, with
laud for thy Bay Horses.  
Bring us in noble shape abundant riches. May he, enriched with prayer,
come soon and early.
