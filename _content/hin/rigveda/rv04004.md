### HYMN IV. Agni.

1\. PUT forth like a wide-spreading net thy vigour; go like a mighty
King with his attendants.  
Thou, following thy swift net, shootest arrows: transfix the fiends with
darts that burn most fiercely.  
2 Forth go in rapid flight thy whirling weapons: follow them closely,
glowing in thy fury.  
Spread with thy tongue the winged flames, O Agni; unfettered, cast thy
firebrands all around thee.  
3 Send thy spies forward, fleetest in thy motion; be, ne’er deceived,
the guardian of this people  
From him who, near or far, is bent on evil, and let no trouble sent from
thee o’ercome us.  
4 Rise up, O Agni, spread thee out before us: burn down our foes, thou
who hast sharpened arrows.  
Him, blazing Agni! who hath worked us mischief, consume thou utterly
like dried-up stubble.  
5 Rise, Agni, drive off those who fight against us: make manifest thine
own celestial vigour.  
Slacken the strong bows of the demon-driven: destroy our foemen whether
kin or stranger.  
6 Most Youthful God, he knoweth well thy favour who gave an impulse to
this high devotion.  
All fair days and magnificence of riches hast thou beamed forth upon the
good man's portals.  
7 Blest, Agni, be the man, the liberal giver, who with his lauds and
regular oblation  
Is fain to please thee for his life and dwelling. May all his days be
bright: be this his longing.  
8 I praise thy gracious favour: sing in answer. May this my song sing
like a loved one with thee.  
Lords of good steeds and cars may we adorn thee, and day by day
vouchsafe thou us dominion.  
9 Here of free choice let each one serve thee richly, resplendent day by
day at eve and morning.  
So may we honour thee, content and joyous, passing beyond the glories of
the people.  
10 Whoso with good steeds and fine gold, O Agni, comes nigh thee on a
car laden with treasure,  
His Friend art thou, yea, thou art his Protector whose joy it is to
entertain thee duly.  
11 Through words and kinship I destroy the mighty: this power I have
from Gotama my father.  
Mark thou this speech of ours, O thou Most Youthful, Friend of the
House, exceeding wise, Invoker.  
12 Knowing no slumber, speedy and propitious, alert and ever friendly,
most unwearied,  
May thy protecting powers, unerring Agni, taking their places here,
combined, preserve us.  
13 Thy guardian rays, O Agni, when they saw him, preserved blind
Māmateya from affliction.  
Lord of all riches, he preserved the pious: the fees who fain would harm
them did no mischief  
14 Aided by thee with thee may we be wealthy, may we gain strength with
thee to guide us onward.  
Fulfil the words of both, O Ever Truthful: straightway do this, thou God
whom power emboldens.  
15 O Agni, with this fuel will we serve thee; accept the laud we sing to
thee with favour  
Destroy the cursing Rākṣasas: preserve us, O rich in friends, from guile
and scorn and slander.
