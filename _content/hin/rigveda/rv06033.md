### HYMN XXXIII. Indra.

1\. GIVE us the rapture that is mightiest, Indra, prompt to bestow and
swift to aid, O Hero,  
That wins with brave steeds where brave steeds encounter, and quells the
Vṛtras and the foes in battle.  
2 For with loud voice the tribes invoke thee, Indra, to aid them in the
battlefield of heroes.  
Thou, with the singers, hast pierced through the Paṇis: the charger whom
thou aidest wins the booty.  
3 Both races, Indra, of opposing foemen, O Hero, both the Ārya and the
Dāsa,  
Hast thou struck down like woods with well-shot lightnings: thou rentest
them in fight, most manly Chieftain!  
4 Indra, befriend us with no scanty succour, prosper and aid us, Loved
of all that liveth,  
When, fighting for the sunlight, we invoke thee, O Hero, in the fray, in
war's division.  
5 Be ours, O Indra, now and for the future, be graciously inclined and
near to help us.  
Thus may we, singing, sheltered by the Mighty, win many cattle on the
day of trial.
