### HYMN I. Agni.

1\. THOU, Agni, who wilt have the strong, hast made me the Soma's
priest, to worship in assembly.  
Thou shinest to the Gods, I set the press-stones. I toil; be joyful in
thyself, O Agni.  
2 East have we turned the rite; may the hymn aid it. With wood and
worship shall they honour Agni.  
From heaven the synods of the wise have learnt it: e’en for the quick
and strong they seek advancement.  
3 The Prudent, he whose will is pure, brought welfare, allied by birth
to Heaven and Earth in kinship.  
The Gods discovered in the midst of waters beautiful Agni with the
Sisters' labour.  
4 Him, Blessed One, the Seven strong Floods augmented, him white at
birth and red when waxen mighty.  
As mother mares run to their new-born you ling, so at his birth the Gods
wondered at Agni.  
5 Spreading with radiant limbs throughout the region, purging his power
with wise purifications,  
Robing himself in light, the life of waters, he spreads abroad his high
and perfect glories.  
6 He sought heaven's Mighty Ones, the unconsuming, the unimpaired, not
clothed and yet not naked.  
Then they, ancient and young, who dwell together, Seven sounding Rivers,
as one germ received him.  
7 His piles, assuming every form, are scattered where flow sweet waters,
at the spring of fatness;  
There stood the milch-kine with full-laden udders, and both paired
Mighty Mothers of the Wondrous.  
8 Carefully cherished, Son of Strength, thou shoncst assuming lasting
and refulgent beauties.  
Full streams of fatness and sweet juice descended, there where the
Mighty One grew strong by wisdom.  
9 From birth he knew even his Father's bosom, he set his voices and his
streams in motion;  
Knew him who moved with blessed Friends in secret, with the young Dames
of heaven. He stayed not hidden.  
10 He nursed the Infant of the Sire and Maker: alone the Babe sucked
many a teeming bosom.  
Guard, for the Bright and Strong, the fellow-spouses friendly to men and
bound to him in kinship.  
11 The Mighty One increased in space unbounded; full many a glorious
flood gave strength to Agni.  
Friend of the house, within the lap of Order lay Agni, in the Sister
Rivers' service.  
12 As keen supporter where great waters gather, light-shedder whom the
brood rejoice to look on;  
He who begat, and will beget, the dawnlights, most manly, Child of
Floods, is youthful Agni.  
13 Him, varied in his form, the lovely Infant of floods and plants the
blessed wood hath gendered.  
Gods even, moved in spirit, came around him, and served him at his
birth, the Strong, the Wondrous.  
14 Like brilliant lightnings, mighty luminaries accompany the
light-diffusing Agni,  
Waxen, as ’twere in secret, in his dwelling, while in the boundless
stall they milk out Amṛta.  
15 I sacrificing serve thee with oblations and crave with longing thy
good-will and friendship.  
Grant, with the Gods, thy grace to him who lauds thee, protect us with
thy rays that guard the homestead.  
16 May we, O Agni, thou who leadest wisely, thy followers and masters of
all treasures,  
Strong in the glory of our noble offspring, subdue the godless when they
seek the battle.  
17 Ensign of Gods hast thou become, O Agni, joy-giver, knower of all
secret wisdom.  
Friend of the homestead, thou hast lightened mortals: carborne thou
goest to the Gods, fulfilling.  
18 Within the house hath sate the King immortal of mortals, filling full
their sacred synods.  
Bedewed with holy oil he shineth widely, Agni, the knower of all secret
wisdom.  
19 Come unto us with thine auspicious friendship, come speeding, Mighty,
with thy mighty succours.  
Grant us abundant wealth that saves from danger, that brings a good
repute, a glorious portion.  
20 To thee who art of old these songs, O Agni, have I declared, the
ancient and the later.  
These great libations to the Strong are offiered: in every birth is
Jātavedas stablished.  
21 Stablished in every birth is Jātavedas, kindled perpetual by the
Viśvāmitras.  
May we rest ever in the loving-kindness, in the auspicious grace of him
the Holy.  
22 This sacrifice of ours do thou, O Mighty, O truly Wise, bear to the
Gods rejoicing.  
Grant us abundant food, thou priestly Herald, vouchsafe to give us ample
wealth, O Agni.  
23 As holy food, Agni, to thine'invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting,
rich in marvels.  
To us he born a son, and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious
will to us-ward.
