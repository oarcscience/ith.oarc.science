### HYMN LXXII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THEY cleanse the Gold-hued: like a red Steed is he yoked, and Soma
in the jar is mingled with the milk.  
He sendeth out his voice, and many loving friends of him the highly
lauded hasten with their songs.  
2 The many sages utter words in unison, while into Indra's throat they
pour the Soma juice,  
When, with the ten that dwell together closely joined, the men whose
hands are skilful cleanse the lovely meath.  
3 He goes upon his way, unresting, to the cows, over the roaring sound
which Sarya's Daughter loves.  
The Falcon brought it to him for his own delight: now with the twofold
kindred sisters is his home.  
4 Washed by the men, stone-pressed, dear on the holy grass, faithful to
seasons, Lord of cattle from of old,  
Most liberal, completing sacrifice for men, O Indra, pure bright Soma,
Indu, flows for thee.  
5 O Indra, urged by arms of men and poured in streams, Soma flows on for
thee afterḥis Godlike kind.  
Plans thou fulfillest, gatherest thoughts for sacrifice: in the bowls
sits the Gold-hued like a roosting bird.  
6 Sages well-skilled in work, intelligent, drain out the stalk that
roars, the Sage, the Everlasting One.  
The milk, the hymns unite them with him in the place of sacrifice, his
seat who is produced anew.  
7 Earth's central point, sustainer of the mighty heavens, distilled into
the streams, into the waters' wave,  
As Indra's thunderbolt, Steer with farspreading wealth, Soma is flowing
on to make the heart rejoice.  
8 Over the earthly region flow thou on thy way, helping the praiser and
the pourer, thou Most Wise.  
Let us not lack rich treasure reaching to our home, and may we clothe
ourselves in manifold bright wealth.  
9 Hither, O Indu, unto us a hundred gifts of steeds, a thousand gifts of
cattle and of gold,  
Measure thou forth, yea, splendid ample strengthening food do thou, O
Pavamana, heed this laud of ours.
