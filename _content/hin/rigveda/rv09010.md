### HYMN X. Soma Pavamana.

1\. LIKE cars that thunder on their way, like coursers eager for
renown,  
Have Soma-drops flowed forth for wealth.  
2 Forth have they rushed from holding hands, like chariots that are
urged to speed,  
Like joyful songs of singing-men.  
3 The Somas deck themselves with milk, as Kings are graced with
eulogies,  
And, with seven priests, the sacrifice.  
4 Pressed for the gladdening draught, the drops flow forth abundantly
with song,  
The Soma juices in a stream.  
5 Winning Vivasvān's glory and producing Morning's light, the Suns  
Pass through the openings of the cloth.  
6 The singing-men of ancient time open the doors of sacred songs,—  
Men, for the mighty to accept.  
7 Combined in close society sit the seven priests, the brother-hood,  
Filling the station of the One.  
8 He gives us kinship with the Gods, and with the Sun unites our eye:  
The Sage's ofrspring hath appeared.  
9 The Sun with his dear eye beholds that quarter of the heavens which
priests  
Have placed within the sacred cell.
