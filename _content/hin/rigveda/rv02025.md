Heritage

### HYMN XXV. Brahmaṇaspati.

1\. HE lighting up the flame shall conquer enemies: strong shall he be
who offers prayer and brings his gift.  
He with his seed spreads forth beyond another's seed, whomever
Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.  
2 With heroes he shall overcome his hero foes, and spread his wealth by
kine wise by himself is be.  
His children and his children's children grow in strength, whomever
Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.  
3 He, mighty like a raving river's billowy flood, as a bull conquers
oxen, overcomes with strength.  
Like Agni's blazing rush he may not be restrained, whomever
Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.  
4 For him the floods of heaven flow never failing down: first with the
heroes he goes forth to war for kine.  
He slays in unabated vigour with great might, whomever Brahmaṇaspati
takes for his friend.  
5 All roaring rivers pour their waters down for him, and many a flawless
shelter hath been granted him.  
Blest with the happiness of Gods he prospers well, whomever
Brahmaṇaspati takes for his friend.
