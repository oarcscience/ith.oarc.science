### HYMN IV Agni.

1\. As at man's service of the Gods, Invoker, thou, Son of Strength,
dost sacrifice and worship,  
So bring for us to-day all Gods together, bring willingly the willing
Gods, O Agni.  
2 May Agni, radiant Herald of the morning, meet to be known, accept our
praise with favour.  
Dear to all life, mid mortal men Immortal, our guest, awake at dawn, is
Jātavedas.  
3 Whose might the very heavens regard with wonder: bright as the Sun he
clothes himself with lustre.  
He who sends forth,, Eternal Purifier, hath shattered e’en the ancient
works of Aśna.  
4 Thou art a Singer, Son! our feast-companion: Agni at birth prepared
his food and pathway.  
Therefore vouchsafe us strength, O Strength-bestower. Win like a King:
foes trouble not thy dwelling.  
5 Even he who cats his firm hard food with swiftness,and overtakes the
nights as Vāyu kingdoms.  
May we o’ercome those who resist thine orders, like a steed casting down
the flying foemen.  
6 Like Sūrya with his fulgent rays, O Agni, thou overspreadest both the
worlds with splendour.  
Decked with bright colour he dispels the darkness, like Auśija, with
clear flame swifily flying.  
7 We have elected thee as most delightful for thy beams' glow: hear our
great laud, O Agni.  
The best men praise thee as the peer of Indra in strength, mid Gods,
like Viyu in thy bounty.  
8 Now, Agni, on the tranquil paths of riches come to us for our weal:
save us from sorrow.  
Grant chiefs and bard this boon. May we live happy, with hero children,
through a hundred winters.
