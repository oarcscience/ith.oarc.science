### HYMN CLXVI. Maruts.

1\. Now let us publish, for the vigorous company the herald of the
Strong One, their primeval might.  
With fire upon your way, O Maruts loud of voice, with battle, Mighty
Ones, achieve your deeds of strength.  
2 Bringing the pleasant meath as ’twere their own dear son, they sport
in sportive wise gay at their gatherings.  
The Rudras come with succour to the worshipper; self-strong they fail
not him who offers sacrifice.  
3 To whomsoever, bringer of oblations, they immortal guardians, have
given plenteous wealth,  
For him, like loving friends, the Maruts bringing bliss bedew the
regions round with milk abundantly.  
4 Ye who with mighty powers have stirred the regions up, your coursers
have sped forth directed by themselves.  
All creatures of the earth, all dwellings are afraid, for brilliant is
your coming with your spears advanced.  
5 When they in dazzling rush have made the mountains roar, and shaken
heaven's high back in their heroic strength,  
Each sovran of the forest fears as ye drive near, aid the shrubs fly
before you swift as whirling wheels.  
6 Terrible Maruts, ye with ne’er-diminished host, with great benevolence
fulfil our heart's desire.  
Where’er your lightning bites armed with its gory teeth it crunches up
the cattle like a well-aimed dart.  
7 Givers of during gifts whose bounties never fail, free from ill-will,
at sacrifices glorified,  
They sing their song aloud that they may drink sweet juice: well do they
know the Hero's first heroic deeds.  
8 With castles hundredfold, O Maruts, guard ye well the man whom ye have
loved from ruin and from sin,—  
The man whom ye the fierce, the Mighty ones who roar, preserve from
calumny by cherishing his seed.  
9 O Maruts, in your cars are all things that are good: great powers are
set as ’twere in rivalry therein.  
Rings are upon your shoulders when ye journey forth: your axle turns
together both the chariot wheels.  
10 Held in your manly arms are many goodly things, gold chains are on
your chests, and glistering ornaments,  
Deer-skins are on their shoulders, on their fellies knives: they spread
their glory out as birds spread out their wings.  
11 Mighty in mightiness, pervading, passing strong, visible from afar as
’twere with stars of heaven,  
Lovely with pleasant tongues, sweet singers with their mouths, the
Maruts, joined with Indra, shout forth all around.  
12 This is your majesty, ye Maruts nobly born, far as the sway of Aditi
your bounty spreads.  
Even Indra by desertion never disannuls the boon bestowed by you upon
the pious man.  
13 This is your kinship, Maruts, that, Immortals, ye were oft in olden
time regardful of our call,  
Having vouchsafed to man a hearing through this prayer, by wondrous
deeds the Heroes have displayed their might.  
14 That, O ye Maruts, we may long time flourish through your abundant
riches, O swift movers,  
And that our men may spread in the encampment, let me complete the rite
with these oblations.  
15 May this your laud, may this your song, O Maruts, sung by the poet,
Māna's son, Māndārya,  
Bring offspring for ourselves with food to feed us. May we find
strengthening food in full abundance.
