### HYMN XX. Agni.

1\. AGNI, best winner of the spoil, cause us to praise before the Gods  
As our associate meet for lauds, wealth which thou verily deemest
wealth.  
2 Agni, the great who ward not off the anger of thy power and might  
Stir up the wrath and hatred due to one who holds an alien creed.  
3 Thee, Agni, would we choose as Priest, the perfecter of strength and
skill;  
We who bring sacred food invoke with song thee Chief at holy rites.  
4 Here as is needful for thine aid we toil, O Conqueror, day by day,  
For wealth, for Law. May we rejoice, Most Wise One! at the feast, with
kine, rejoice, with heroes, at the feast.
