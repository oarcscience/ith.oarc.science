### HYMN LXXXIII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. SPREAD is thy cleansing filter, Brahmaṇaspati: as Prince, thou
enterest its limbs from every side.  
The raw, whose mass hath not been heated gains not this: they only which
are dressed, which bear, attain to it.  
2 High in the seat of heaven is spread the Scorcher's sieve: its threads
are standing separate, glittering with light.  
The Swift Ones favour him who purifieth this: with consciousness they
stand upon the height of heaven.  
3 The foremost spotted Steer hath made the Mornings shine, and yearning
after strength sustains all things that be.  
By his high wisdom have the mighty Sages wrought: the Fathers who behold
mankind laid down the germ,  
4 Gandharva verily protects his dwellingplace; Wondrous, he guards the
generations of the Gods.  
Lord of the snare, he takes the foeman with the snare: those who are
most devout have gained a share of meath.  
5 Rich in oblations! robed in cloud, thou corapassest oblation,
sacrifice, the mighty seat of Gods.  
King, on thy chariot-sieve thou goest up to war, and with a thousand
weapons winnest lofty fame.
