### HYMN XIX. Agni.

1\. AGNI, quick, sage, infallible, all-knowing, I choose to be our
Priest at this oblation.  
In our Gods’ service he, best skilled, shall worship: may he obtain us
boons for strength and riches.  
2 Agni, to thee I lift the oil-fed ladle, bright, with an offering,
bearing our oblation.  
From the right hand, choosing the Gods’ attendance, he with rich
presents hath arranged the worship.  
3 Of keenest spirit is the man thou aidest give us good offspring, thou
who givest freely.  
In power of wealth most rich in men. O Agni, of thee, the Good, may we
sing forth fair praises.  
4 Men as they worship thee the God, O Agni, have set on thee full many a
brilliant, aspect.  
So bring Most Youthful One, the Gods’ assembly, the Heavenly Host which
thou to-day shalt honour.  
5 When Gods anoint thee Priest at their oblation, and seat thee for thy
task as Sacrificer,  
O Agni, be thou here our kind defender, and to ourselves vouchsafe the
gift of glory.
