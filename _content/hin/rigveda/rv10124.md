### HYMN CXXIV. Agni, Etc.

1\. COME to this sacrifice of ours, O Agni, threefold, with seven
threads and five divisions.  
Be our oblation-bearer and preceder: thou hast lain long enough in
during darkness.  
2 I come a God foreseeing from the godless to immortality by secret
pathways,  
While I, ungracious one, desert the gracious, leave mine own friends and
seek the kin of strangers.  
3 1, looking to the guest of other lineage, have founded many a rule of
Law and Order.  
I bid farewell to the Great God, the Father, and, for neglect, obtain my
share of worship.  
4 I tarried many a year within this altar: I leave the Father, for my
choice is Indra.  
Away pass Agni, Varuṇa and Soma. Rule ever changes: this I come to
favour.  
5 These Asuras have lost their powers of magic. But thou, O Varuṇa, if
thou dost love me,  
O King, discerning truth and right from falsehood, come and be Lord and
Ruler of my kingdom.  
6 Here is the light of heaven, here allis lovely; here there is
radiance, here is air's wide region.  
Let us two slaughter Vṛtra. Forth, O Soma! Thou art oblation: we
therewith will serve thee.  
7 The Sage hath fixed his form by wisdom in the heavens: Varuṇa with no
violence let the waters flow.  
Like women-folk, the floods that bring prosperity have eau lit his hue
and colour as they gleamed and shone.  
8 These wait upon his loftiest power and vigour: he dwells in these who
triumph in their Godhead;  
And they, like people who elect their ruler, have in abhorrence turned
away from Vṛtra.  
9 They call him Swan, the abhorrent floods' Companion, moving in
friendship with celestial Waters.  
The poets in their thought have looked on Indra swiftly approaching when
Anustup calls him.
