### HYMN LXXII. Agni.

1\. THOUGH holding many gifts for men, he humbleth the higher powers of
each wise ordainer.  
Agni is now the treasure-lord of treasures, for ever granting all
immortal bounties.  
2 The Gods infallible all searching found not him, the dear Babe who
still is round about us.  
Worn weary, following his track, devoted, they reached the lovely
highest home of Agni.  
3 Because with holy oil the pure Ones, Agni, served thee the very pure
three autumn seasons,  
Therefore they won them holy names for worship, and nobly born they
dignified their bodies.  
4 Making them known to spacious earth and heaven, the holy Ones revealed
the powers of Rudra.  
The mortal band, discerning in the distance, found Agni standing in the
loftiest station.  
5 Nigh they approached, one-minded, with their spouses, kneeling to him
adorable paid worship.  
Friend finding in his own friend's eye protection, they made their own
the bodies which they chastened.  
6 Soon as the holy beings had discovered the thrice-seven mystic things
contained within thee,  
With these, one-minded, they preserve the Amṛta: guard thou the life of
all their plants and cattle.  
7 Thou, Agni, knower of men's works, hast sent us good food in constant
course for our subsistence:  
Thou deeply skilled in paths of Gods becamest an envoy never wearied,
offering-bearer.  
8 Knowing the Law, the seven strong floods from heaven, full of good
thought, discerned the doors of riches.  
Saramā found the cattle's firm-built prison whereby the race of man is
still supported.  
9 They who approached all noble operations making a path that leads to
life immortal,  
To be the Bird's support, the spacious mother, Aditi, and her great Sons
stood in power.  
10 When Gods immortal made both eyes of heaven, they gave to him the
gift of beauteous glory.  
Now they flow forth like rivers set in motion: they knew the Red Steeds
coming down, O Agni.
