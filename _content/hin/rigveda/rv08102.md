*Rig Veda*, tr. by Ralph T.H. Griffith, \[1896\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

### HYMN X. Viśvedevas.

1\. HE whom the priests in sundry ways arranging the sacrifice, of one
accord, bring hither,  
Who was appointed as a learned Brahman, -what is the sacrificer's
knowledge of him?  
2 Kindled in many a spot, still One is Agni; Silrya is One though high
o’er all he shineth.  
Illumining this All, still One is usas. That which is One hath into All
developed.  
3 The chariot bright and radiant, treasure-laden, three-wheeled, with
easy seat, and lightly rolling,  
Which She of Wondrous Wealth was born to harness,—this car of yours I
call. Drink what remaineth.
