### HYMN CLXXX. Aśvins.

1\. LIGHTLY your coursers travel through the regions when round the sea
of air your car is flying.  
Your golden fellies scatter drops of moisture: drinking the sweetness ye
[attend](errata.htm#7) the Mornings.  
2 Ye as ye travel overtake the Courser who flies apart, the Friend of
man, most holy.  
The prayer is that the Sister may convey you, all praised,
meath-drinkers! to support and strengthen.  
3 Ye have deposited, matured within her, in the raw cow the first milk
of the milch-cow,  
Which the bright offerer, shining like a serpent mid trees, presents to
you whose form is perfect.  
4 Ye made the fierce heat to be full of sweetness for Atri at his wish,
like streaming water.  
Fire-offering thence is yours, O Aśvins, Heroes: your car-wheels speed
to us like springs of honey.  
5 Like Tugra's ancient son may I, ye Mighty, bring you to give your
gifts with milk-oblations.  
Your greatness compasseth Earth, Heaven, and Waters: decayed for you is
sorrow's net, ye Holy.  
6 When, Bounteous Ones, ye drive your yoked team downward, ye send, by
your own natures, understanding.  
Swift as the wind let the prince please and feast you: he, like a pious
man, gains strength for increase.  
7 For verily we truthful singers praise you the niggard trafficker is
here excluded.  
Now, even now do ye O blameless Aśvins, ye Mighty, guard the man whose
God is near him.  
8 You of a truth day after day, O Aśvins, that he might win the very
plenteous torrent,  
Agastya, famous among mortal heroes, roused with a thousand lauds like
sounds of music.  
9 When with the glory of your car ye travel, when we go speeding like
the priest of mortals,  
And give good horses to sacrificers, may we, Nāsatyas! gain our share of
riches.  
10 With songs of praise we call to-day, O Aśvins, that your new chariot,
for our own well-being,  
That circles heaven with never-injured fellies. May we find
strengthening food in full abundance.
