### HYMN XXX. Waters.

1\. As ’twere with swift exertion of the spirit, let the priest speed to
the celestial Waters,  
The glorious food of Varuṇa and Mitra. To him who spreadeth far this
laud I offer.  
2 Adhvaryus, he ye ready with oblations,, and come with longing to the
longing Waters,  
Down on which looks the. purple-tinted Eagle. Pour ye that flowing wave
this day, deft-handed.  
3 Go to the reservoir, O ye Adhvaryus worship the Waters’ Child with
your oblations.  
A consecrated wave he now will give you, so press for him the Soma rich
in sweetness.  
4 He who shines bright in floods, unfed with fuel, whom sages worship at
their sacrifices:  
Give waters rich in sweets, Child of the Waters, even those which gave
heroic might to Indra:  
5 Those in which Soma joys and is delighted, as a young man with fair
and pleasant damsels.  
Go thou unto those Waters, O Adhvaryu, and purify with herbs what thou
infusest.  
6 So maidens bow before the youthful gallant who comes with love to them
who yearn to meet him.  
In heart accordant and in wish one-minded are the Adhvaryus and the
heavenly Waters.  
7 He who made room for you when fast imprisoned, who freed you from the
mighty imprecation,—  
Even to that Indra send the meath-rich current, the wave that gratifies
the Gods, O Waters.  
8 Send forth to him the meath-rich wave, O Rivers, which is your
offspring and a well of sweetness,  
Oil-balmed, to be implored at sacrifices. Ye wealthy Waters, hear mine
invocation.  
9 Send forth the rapture-giving wave, O Rivers, which Indra drinks,
which sets the Twain in motion;  
The well that springeth from the clouds, desirous, that wandereth
triple-formed, distilling transport.  
10 These winding Streams which with their double current, like
cattle-raiders, seek the lower pastures,—  
Waters which dwell together, thrive together, Queens, Mothers of the
world, these, Ṛṣi, honour.  
11 Send forth our sacrifice with holy worship send forth the hymn and
prayer for gain of riches.  
For need of sacrifice disclose the udder. Give gracious hearing to our
call, O Waters.  
12 For, wealthy Waters, ye control all treasures: ye bring auspicious
intellect and Amṛta.  
Ye are the Queens of independent riches Sarasvatī give full life to the
singer!  
13 When I behold the Waters coming hither, carrying with them milk and
mcath and butter,  
Bearing the well-pressed Soma juice to Indra, they harmonize in spirit
with Adhvaryus.  
14 Rich, they are come with wealth for living beings, O friends,
Adhvaryus, seat them in their places.  
Seat them on holy grass, ye Soma-bringers in harmony with the Offspring
of the Waters.  
15 Now to this grass are come the longing Waters: the Pious Ones are
seated at our worship.  
Adbvaryus, press the Soma juice for Indra so will the service of the
Gods be easy.
