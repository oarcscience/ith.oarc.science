### HYMN LXXVI. Aśvins

1\. AGNI, the bright face of the Dawns, is shining; the singers' pious
voices have ascended.  
Borne on your chariot, Aśvins, turn you hither and come unto our full
and rich libation.  
2 Most frequent guests, they scorn not what is ready: even now the
lauded Aśvins are beside us.  
With promptest aid they come at morn and evening, the worshipper's most
blessed guards from trouble.  
3 Yea, come at milking-time, at early morning, at noon of day and when
the Sun is setting,  
By day, by night, with favour most auspicious. Not only now the draught
hath drawn the Aśvins.  
4 For this place, Aśvins, was of old your dwelling, these were your
houses, this your habitation.  
Come to us from high heaven and from the mountain. Come from the waters
bringing food and vigour.  
5 May we obtain the Aśvins' newest favour, and gain their
health-bestowing happy guidance.  
Bring riches hither unto us, and heroes, and all felicity and joy,
Immortals!
