Heritage

### HYMN XXII. Soma Pavamana.

1\. THESE rapid Soma-streams have stirred themselves to motion like
strong steeds,  
Like cars, like armies hurried forth.  
2 Swift as wide winds they lightly move, like rain-storms of Parjanya,
like  
The flickering flames of burning fire.  
3 These Soma juices, blent with curds, purified, skilled in sacred
hymns,  
Have gained by song their hearts'desire.  
4 Immortal, cleansed, these drops, since first they flowed, have never
wearied, fain  
To reach the regions and their paths.  
5 Advancing they have travelled o’er the ridges of the earth and
heaven,  
And this the highest realm of all.  
6 Over the heights have they attained the highest thread that is spun
out,  
And this which must be deemed most high.  
7 Thou, Soma, boldest wealth in kine which thou hast seized from niggard
churls:  
Thou calledst forth the outspun thread.
