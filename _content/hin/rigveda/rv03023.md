Heritage

### HYMN XXIII. Agni.

1\. RUBBED into life, well stablished in the dwelling, Leader of
sacrifice, the Sage, the youthful,  
Here in the wasting fuel Jātavedas, eternal, hath assumed immortal
being.  
2 Both Bharatas, Devaśravas, Devāvata, have strongly rubbed to life
effectual Agni.  
O Agni, look thou forth with ample riches: be, every day, bearer of food
to feed us.  
3 Him nobly born of old the fingers ten produced, him whom his Mothers
counted dear.  
Praise Devāvata's Agni, thou Devaśravas, him who shall be the people's
Lord.  
4 He set thee in the earth's most lovely station, in Iḷā's place, in
days of fair bright weather.  
On man, on Āpayā, Agni! on the rivers Dṛṣadvati, Sarasvatī, shine
richly.  
5 Agni, as holy food to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting,
rich in marvels.  
To us be born a son and spreading offspring Agni, be this thy gracious
will to us-ward
