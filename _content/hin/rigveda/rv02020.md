### HYMN XX. Indra.

1\. As one brings forth his car when fain for combat, so bring we power
to thee—regard us, Indra—  
Well skilled in song, thoughtful in spirit, seeking great bliss from one
like thee amid the Heroes.  
2 Indra, thou art our own with thy protection, a guardian near to men
who love thee truly,  
Active art thou, the liberal man's defender, his who draws near to thee
with right devotion.  
3 May Indra, called with solemn invocations. the young, the Friend, be
men's auspicious keeper,  
One who will further with his aid the singer, the toiler, praiser,
dresser of oblations.  
4 With laud and song let me extol that Indra in whom of old men
prospered and were mighty.  
May he, implored, fulfil the prayer for plenty of him who worships, of
the living mortal.  
5 He, Indra whom the Aṅgirases' praise delighted, strengthened their
prayer and made their goings prosper.  
Stealing away the mornings with the sunlight, he, lauded, crushed even
Aśna's ancient powers.  
6 He verily, the God, the glorious Indra, hath raised him up for man,
best Wonder-Worker.  
He, self-reliant, mighty and triumphant, brought low the dear head of
the wicked Dāsa.  
7 Indra the Vṛtra-slayer, Fort-destroyer, scattered the Dāsa hosts who
dwelt in darkness.  
For men hath he created earth and waters, and ever helped the prayer of
him who worships.  
8 To him in might the Gods have ever yielded, to Indra in the tumult of
the battle.  
When in his arms they laid the bolt, he slaughtered the Dasyus and cast
down their forts of iron.  
9 Now may that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to
him who lauds thee.  
Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Loud may we speak, with
heroes, in assembly.
