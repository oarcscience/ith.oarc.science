### HYMN CLXIX. COWS.

1\. MAY the wind blow upon our Cows with healing: may they eat herbage
full of vigorous juices.  
May they drink waters rich in life and fatness: to food that moves on
feet be gracious, Rudra.  
2 Like-coloured, various-hued, or single-coloured, whose names through
sacrifice are known to Agni,  
Whom the Aṅgirases produced by Fervour,—vouchsafe to these, Parjanya,
great protection.  
3 Those who have offered to the Gods their bodies, whose varied forms
are all well known to Soma,—  
Those grant us in our cattle-pen, O Indra, with their full streams of
milk and plenteous offspring.  
4 Prajāpati, bestowing these upon me, one-minded with all Gods and with
the Fathers,  
Hath to our cow-pen brought auspicious cattle: so may we own the
offspring they will bear us.
