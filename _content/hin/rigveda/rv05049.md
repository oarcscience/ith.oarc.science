Heritage

### HYMN XLIX. Viśvedevas.

1\. THIS day I bring God Savitar to meet you, and Bhaga who allots the
wealth of mortals.  
You, Aśvins, Heroes rich in treasures, daily seeking your friendship
fain would I turn hither.  
2 Knowing full well the Asura's time of coming, worship God Savitar with
hymns and praises.  
Let him who rightly knoweth speak with homage to him who dealeth out
man's noblest treasure.  
3 Not for reward doth Pūṣan send his blessings, Bhaga, or Aditi: his
garb is splendour.  
May Indra, Visniu, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni produce auspicious days, the
Wonder-Workers.  
4 Sending the shelter which we ask, the foeless Savitar and the Rivers
shall approach us.  
When I, the sacrifice's priest, invite them, may we he lords of wealth
and rich possessions.  
5 They who devote such worship to the Vasus, singing their hymns to
Varuṇa and Mitra,  
Vouchsafe them ample room, far off be danger. Through grace of Heaven
and Earth may we be happy.
