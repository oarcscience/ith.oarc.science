### HYMN XXVI. Agni.

1\. REVERING in our heart Agni Vaiśvānara, the finder of the light,
whose promises are true,  
The liberal, gladsome, car-borne God we Kuśikas invoke him with
oblation, seeking wealth with songs.  
2 That Agni, bright, Vaiśvānara, we invoke for help, and Mātariśvan
worthy of the song of praise;  
Bṛhaspati for man's observance of the Gods, the Singer prompt to hear,
the swiftly-moving guest.  
3 Age after age Vaiśvānara, neighing like a horse, is kindled with the
women by the Kuśikas.  
May Agni, he who wakes among Immortal Gods, grant us heroic strength and
wealth in noble steeds.  
4 Let them go forth, the strong, as flames of fire with might. Gathered
for victory they have yoked their spotted deer.  
Pourers of floods, the Maruts, Masters of all wealth, they who can ne’er
be conquered, make the mountains shake.  
5 The Maruts, Friends of men, are glorious as the fire: their mighty and
resplendent succour we implore.  
Those storming Sons of Rudra clothed in robes of rain, boon-givers of
good gifts, roar as the lions roar.  
6 We, band on band and troop following troop, entreat with fair lauds
Agni's splendour and the Maruts’ might,  
With spotted deer for steeds, with wealth that never fails, they, wise
Ones, come to sacrifice at our gatherings.  
7 Agni am I who know, by birth, all creatures. Mine eye is butter, in my
mouth is nectar.  
I am light threefold, measurer of the region exhaustless heat am I,
named burnt-oblation.  
8 Bearing in mind a thought with light accordant, he purified the Sun
with three refinings;  
By his own nature gained the highest treasure, and looked abroad over
the earth and heaven.  
9 The Spring that fails not with a hundred streamlets, Father inspired
of prayers that men should utter,  
The Sparkler, joyous in his Parents' bosorn, -him, the Truth-speaker,
sate ye, Earth and Heaven.
