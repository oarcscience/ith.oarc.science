### HYMN XII. Agni.

1\. KING of trimmed grass, Herald within the dwelling, may Agni worship
the Impeller's World-halves.  
He, Son of Strength, the Holy, from a distance hath spread himself
abroad with light like Sūrya.  
2 In thee, most wise, shall Dyaus, for full perfection, King! Holy One!
pronounce the call to worship.  
Found in three places, like the Speeder's footstep, come to present
men's riches as oblations!  
3 Whose blaze most splendid, sovran in the forest, shines waxing on his
way like the - Impeller.  
He knows himself, like as a guileless smelter, not to be stayed among
the plants, Immortal.  
4 Our friends extol him like a steed for vigour even Agni in the
dwelling, jatave\~as.  
Trce-fed, he fights with power as doth a champion, like Dawn's Sire to
be praised with sacrifices.  
5 Men wonder at his shining glows when, paring the woods with case, o’er
the broad earth he goeth,  
And, like a rushing flood, loosed quickly, burneth, swift as a guilty
thief, o’er desert places.  
6 So mighty thou protectest us from slander, O Champion, Agni! with all
fires enkindled.  
Bring opulence and drive away affliction. May brave sons gladden us
through a hundred winters.
