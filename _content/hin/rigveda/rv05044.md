### HYMN XLIV. Viśvedevas.

1\. As in the first old times, as all were wont, as now, he draweth
forth the power turned hitherward with song,  
The Princedom throned on holy grass, who findeth light, swift,
conquering in the' plants wherein he waxeth strong.  
2 Shining to him who leaves heaven's regions undisturbed, which to his
sheen who is beneath show fair in light,  
Good guardian art thou, not to be deceived, Most Wise! Far from deceits
thy name dwelleth in holy Law.  
3 Truth waits upon oblation present and to come: naught checks him in
his way, this vic tory- bringing Priest:  
The Mighty Child who glides along the sacred grass, the undecaying Youth
set in the midst of plants.  
4 These come, well-yoked, to you for furtherance in the rite: down come
the twinborn strengtheners of Law for him,  
With reins easily guided and commanding all. In the deep fall the hide
stealeth away their names.  
5 Thou, moving beauteously in visibly pregnant ones, snatching with
trees the branching plant that grasps the juice,  
Shinest, true Singer! mid the upholders of the voice. Increase thy
Consorts thou, lively at sacrifice.  
6 Like as he is beheld such is he said to be.  
They with effectual splendour in the floods have made  
Earth yield us room enough and amply wide extent, great might
invincible, with store of hero sons.  
7 Sūrya the Sage, as if unwedded, with a Spouse, in battle-loving spirit
moveth o’er the foes.  
May he, self-excellent, grant us a sheltering home, a house that wards
the fierce heat off on every side.  
8 Thy name, sung forth by Ṛṣis in these hymns of ours, goes to the
loftier One with this swift mover's light.  
By skill he wins the boon whereon his heart is set: he who bestirs
himself shall bring the thing to pass.  
9 The chief and best of these abideth in the sea, nor doth libation fail
wherein it is prolonged.  
The heart of him who praiseth trembleth not in fear there where the hymn
is found connected with the pure.  
10 For it is he: with though to of Ksatra, Manasa, of Yajata, and
Sadhri, and Evavada,  
With Avatsara's sweet songs will we strive to win the mightiest strength
which even he who knows should gain.  
11 The Hawk is their full source, girth-stretching rapturous drink of
Visvavara, of Mayin, and Yajata.  
They ever seek a fresh draught so that they may come, know when thy time
to halt and drink thy fill is near.  
12 Sadaprna the holy, Tarya, Srutavit, and Bahuvrkta, joined with you,
have slain the foes.  
He gains his wish in both the worlds and brightly shines-when he adores
the host with well-advancing steeds.  
13 The worshipper's defender is Sutambhara, producer and uplifter of all
holy thoughts.  
The milch-cow brought, sweet-flavoured milk was dealt around. Who speaks
the bidding text knows this, not he who sleeps.  
11 The sacred hymns love him who wakes and watches: to him who watches
come the Sāma verses.  
This Soma saith unto the man who watches, I rest and have my dwelling in
thy friendship.  
15 Agni is watchful, and the gcas love him; Agni is watchful, Sāma
verses seek him.  
Agni is watchful, to him saith this Soma, I rest and have my dwelling in
thy friendship.
