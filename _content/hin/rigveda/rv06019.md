### HYMN XIX. Indra.

1\. GREAT, hero-like controlling men is Indra, unwasting in his powers,
doubled in vastness.  
He, turned to us, hath grown to hero vigour: broad, wide, he hath been
decked by those who serve him.  
2 The bowl made Indra swift to gather booty, the High, the Lofty,
Youthful, Undecaying,  
Him who hath waxed by strength which none may conquer, and even at once
grown to complete perfection.  
3 Stretch out those hands of thine, extend to us-ward thy wide capacious
arms, and grant us glory.  
Like as the household herdsman guards the cattle, so move thou round
about us in the combat.  
4 Now, fain for strength, let us invite your Indra hither, who lieth
hidden with his Heroes,—  
Free from all blame, without reproach, uninjured, e’en as were those who
sang, of old, his praises.  
5 With steadfast laws, wealth-giver, strong through Soma, he hath much
fair and precious food to feed us.  
In him unite all paths that lead to riches, like rivers that commingle
with the ocean.  
6 Bring unto us the mightiest might, O Hero, strong and most potent
force, thou great Subduer!  
All splendid vigorous powers of men vouchsafe us, Lord of Bay Steeds,
that they may make us joyful.  
7 Bring us, grown mighty in its strength, O Indra, thy friendly
rapturous joy that wins the battle,  
Wherewith by thee assisted and triumphant, we may laud thee in gaining
seed and offspring.  
8 Indra, bestow on us the power heroic skilled and exceeding strong,
that wins the booty,  
Wherewith, by thine assistance, we may conquer our foes in battle, be
they kin or stranger.  
9 Let thine heroic strength come from behind us, before us, from above
us or below us.  
From every side may it approach us, Indra. Give us the glory of the
realm of splendour.  
10 With most heroic aid from thee, like heroes Indra, may we win wealth
by deeds glory.  
Thou, King, art Lord of earthly, heavenly treasure: vouchsafe us riches
vast, sublime, and lasting.  
11 The Bull, whose strength hath waxed, whom Maruts follow, free-giving
Indra, the Celestial Ruler,  
Mighty, all-conquering, the victory-giver, him let us call to grant us
new protection.  
12 Give up the people who are high and haughty to these men and to me, O
Thunder-wielder!  
Therefore upon the earth do we invoke thee, where heroes win, for sons
and kine and waters.  
13 Through these thy friendships, God invoked of many! may we be victors
over every foeman.  
Slaying both kinds of foe, may we, O Hero, be happy, helped by thee,
with ample riches.
