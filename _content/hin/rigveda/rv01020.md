Heritage

### HYMN XX. Ṛbhus.

1 FOR the Celestial Race this song of praise which gives wealth
lavishly  
Was made by singers with their lips.  
2 They who for Indra, with their mind, formed horses harnessed by a
word,  
Attained by works to sacrifice.  
3 They for the two Nāsatyas wrought a light car moving every way:  
They formed a nectar-yielding cow.  
4 The Ṛbhus with effectual prayers, honest, with constant labour, made  
Their Sire and Mother young again.  
5 Together came your gladdening drops with Indra by the Maruts girt,  
With the Ādityas, with the Kings.  
6 The sacrificial ladle, wrought newly by the God Tvaṣṭar's hand—  
Four ladles have ye made thereof.  
7 Vouchsafe us wealth, to him who pours thrice seven libations, yea, to
each  
Give wealth, pleased with our eulogies.  
8 As ministering Priests they held, by pious acts they won themselves,  
A share in sacrifice with Gods.
