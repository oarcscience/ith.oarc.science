### HYMN XXXIII. Indra.

1\. FORTH from the bosom of the mountains, eager as two swift mares with
loosened rein contending,  
Like two bright mother cows who lick their youngling, Vipāś and Sutudri
speed down their waters.  
2 Impelled by Indra whom ye pray to urge you, ye move as ’twere on
chariots to the ocean.  
Flowing together, swelling with your billows, O lucid Streams, each of
you seeks the other.  
3 I have attained the most maternal River, we have approached Vipāś, the
broad, the blessed.  
Licking as ’twere their calf the pair of Mothers flow onward to their
common home together.  
4 We two who rise and swell with billowy waters move forward to the home
which Gods have made us.  
Our flood may not be stayed when urged to motion. What would the singer,
calling to the Rivers?  
5 Linger a little at my friendly bidding rest, Holy Ones, a moment in
your journey.  
With hymn sublime soliciting your favour Kuśika's son hath called unto
the River.  
6 Indra who wields the thunder dug our channels: he smote down Vṛtra,
him who stayed our currents.  
Savitar, God, the lovely-handed, led us, and at his sending forth we
flow expanded.  
7 That hero deed of Indra must be lauded for ever that he rent Ahi in
pieces.  
He smote away the obstructors with his thunder, and eager for their
course forth flowed the waters.  
8 Never forget this word of thine, O singer, which future generations
shall reecho.  
In hymns, O bard, show us thy loving kindness. Humble us not mid men. To
thee be honour!  
9 List quickly, Sisters, to the bard who cometh to you from far away
with car and wagon.  
Bow lowly down; be easy to be traversed stay, Rivers, with your floods
below our axles.  
10 Yea, we will listen to thy words, O singer. With wain and car from
far away thou comest.  
Low, like a nursing mother, will I bend me, and yield me as a maiden to
her lover.  
11 Soon as the Bharatas have fared across thee, the warrior band, urged
on and sped by Indra,  
Then let your streams flow on in rapid motion. I crave your favour who
deserve our worship.  
12 The warrior host, the Bharatas, fared over the singer won the favour
of the Rivers.  
Swell with your billows, hasting, pouring riches. Fill full your
channels, and roll swiftly onward.  
13 So let your wave bear up the pins, and ye, O Waters, spare the
thongs;  
And never may the pair of Bulls, harmless and sinless, waste away.
