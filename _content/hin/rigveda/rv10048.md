### HYMN XLVIII. Indra Vaikuntha.

1\. I WAS the first possessor of all precious gear: the wealth of every
man I win and gather up.  
On me as on a Father living creatures call; I deal enjoyment to tho. man
who offers gifts.  
2 I, Indra, am Atharvan's stay and firm support: I brought forth kine to
Trita from the Dragon's grasp.  
I stripped the Dasyus of their manly might, and gave the cattle-stalls
to Matarigvan and Dadhyac.  
3 For me hath Tvaṣṭar forged the iron thunderbolt: in me the Gods have
centred intellectual power.  
My sheen is like the Sun's insufferably bright: men honour me as Lord
for past and future deeds.  
4 I won myself these herdi of cattle, steeds and kine, and gold in ample
store, with my destructive bolt.  
I give full many a thousand to the worshipper, what time the Somas and
the lauds have made me glad.  
5 Indra am I none ever wins my wealth from me never at any time am I a
thrall to death.  
Pressing the Soma, ask riches from me alone: ye, Pūrus, in my friendship
shall not suffer harm.  
6 These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring
his bolt of thunder to the fray,  
The challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words
the God speaks to his worshippers.  
This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall
three prevail against me?  
Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the
Indraless, revile me?  
8 Against the Gungus I made Atithigva strong, and kept him mid the folk
like Vṛtra-conquering strength,  
When I won glory in the great foe-slaying fight, in battle where Karanja
fell, and Parṇaya.  
9 With food for mine enjoyment Sapya Nami came: he joined me as a friend
of old in search of kine.  
As I bestowed on him an arrow for the fight I made him worthy of the
song apd hymn of praise.  
10 One of the two hath Soma, seen within it; the Herdsman with the bone
shows forth the other.  
He, fain to fight the Bull whose horns were sharpened, stood fettered in
the demon's ample region.  
11 I, as a God, ne’er violate the statutes of Gods, of Vasus, Rudriyas,
Ādityas.  
These Gods have formed me for auspicious vigour, unconquered and
invincible for ever.
