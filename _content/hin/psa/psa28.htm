Truly, Nund and Jusodha must at some time have performed a great penance, for which reason (or in consequence of which) Bhugwan has been born in their house." And the cowherds' children having come and embraced Krishn&ugrave;, asked him, "Brother! how did you support the weight of such a huge hill on your soft lotus-like hand?"</p>

<p>And the cowherdesses came to Jusodha, and having mentioned to her all the sports which Krishn&ugrave; had last been engaged in, said, "May this child, your son, live a very long time, the guardian of Bruj. He has destroyed demons, giants and evil spirits. Where are the limits to his liberation of the inhabitants of Bruj. Every thing has happened, exactly as Rae Gurug, the sage, said.'</p>
