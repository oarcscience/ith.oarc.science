<p>SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! when Unroodr&ugrave; had been four months bound, Narud Jee went to the city of Dwarka, and there beheld all the Judoos very sad, disconsolate and emaciated with grief. Shree Krishn&ugrave; and Bulram were sitting amongst them, very thoughtful and anxious, and saying, "Who has carried off the child hence?" They were talking in this strain, and there was such weeping and lamentation in the female apartments, that no one could hear another speaking. On the arrival of Narud Jee, all persons present, both male and female, rose up to meet him, and came and stood in his presence greatly agitated and emaciated with grief, sad and shedding tears and lamenting. They afterwards joined their hands, and bowed their heads with great submissiveness, and, expressing the deepest emotion, began to enquire from Narud Jee, "Say, truly, O sage! in order that we may preserve our sinking lives, where shall we receive intelligence of Unroodr&ugrave;? Say, O holy man! so that we may rely on your words." Shree Narud Jee replied, "Suffer not any anxiety of mind, and banish. all sorrow, Unroodr&ugrave; Jee is alive and well at Shronitpore. He has gone there, and enjoyed amorous pleasure with the daughter of Banasoor; for which reason, he has laid hold of and bound him with a running noose; he will not, on any account,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_314"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 314</FONT></A></p>  
<p>release Unroodr&ugrave; without fighting. I have mentioned this secret to you; form your future plans accordingly."</p>  
<p>O great king! Narud Jee departed, when he had given them this intelligence; afterwards all the descendants of Judoo went to the Raja Oogursen, and said, "O great king! we have received exact intelligence that Unroodr&ugrave; Jee is at Shronitpore, at the house of Banasoor; he has enjoyed the Raja's daughter, and the Raja has, in consequence thereof, kept him bound with a running noose. What are your orders now to us?" On hearing this account, Raja Oogursen said, "Take all my army with you, and use your utmost endeavours to release and bring Unroodr&ugrave; here."</p>  
<p>When Oogursen had thus spoken, all the Judoos, O great king! took the Raja's army with them, and accompanied Bulram, and Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund, and Purdiyomun Jee, mounting on the sovereign of the feathered race, arrived before them all at Shronitpore.</p>  
<p>Having narrated thus much, Shree Shookdeo Jee said, O great king! when Bulram Jee, taking all the army of Oogursen and sounding the large kettle-drum, went from the city of Dwarka to Shronitpore, it is impossible to describe the splendid appearance of his cavalcade. In front of all were must" elephants in rows, with huge tusks; on which the large; kettle-drum was sounded, and flags and banners were waving. Behind these, was another row of elephants with howdahs, on which the bravest, most heroical and the mightiest of the Judoos were seated, wearing coats of mail and helmets, and completely armed; immediately following, were successive lines of chariots, after them troops of horsemen were moving along on horses of all colours with collars, harness, tasselled ornaments and iron armour, making them pace as in the manege, and move in an artificial manner, and dance about and jump and plunge. In the midst of them, panegyrists were singing songs of praise, and bards were singing war songs. Behind them came the foot soldiers, thick as a host of locusts,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A></p>  
<p>armed with shields, swords, knives, daggers, spears, javelins, bows, arrows, clubs, quoits and every description of warlike weapon. The sound of the drums and other musical instruments in the midst of this procession, contributed greatly to the fine effect and beauty of the scene. The dust flew up, and spread to the sky, the sun was hid and became like night; the ruddy goose and its mate were 'separated; wives enjoyed themselves with their lords, the lotus bloomed, and the white esculent lotus withered, <A HREF="errata.htm#17">nocturnal</A> animals prowled about, supposing that it was night.</p>  
<p>Having recited thus much of' the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O great king! when Bulram Jee, advancing with great pomp and noise, with a force of twelve complete armies, and destroying all the forts, strongholds and castles of the Raja, and laying waste his country, arrived at Shronitpore, and Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund and Purdiyomun Jee arrived also, some one in great alarm, and distracted with fear, said to Banasoor, with joined hands and bowing his head, "O great king! Krishn&ugrave; and Bulram have advanced with their whole army, a and they have razed all the strongholds, forts and castles in our country and have encompassed the city on every side. What now are your orders?" Banasoor was greatly enraged at these words; and, having summoned all his great demons, said to them, "Take all; your armies outside the city, and go and oppose Krishn&ugrave; and Bulram, I will also come by and bye."</p>  
<p>On receiving this order, O great king! the demons immediately took with them twelve complete armies, and being fully equipped with arms of all kinds, stood ready to encounter Shree Krishn&ugrave; and Bulram Jee; and in rear of them, Banasoor worshipping calling to mind, and meditating upon Shree Muhadeo Jee, was also ready for battle.</p>  
<p>Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O great king! whilst Shiv&ugrave; Jee was meditating, his seat shook, and his meditation was interrupted; on reflecting upon this, he thought to himself, "A worshipper of</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_316"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 316</FONT></A></p>  
<p>mine is in a difficulty; I must go now and remove his anxiety." When having formed this resolution, he had assumed half the body of Parbuttee, fastened his matted hair, rubbed his body over with ashes, eaten a large quantity of hemp, swallow-wort and thorn-apple, wearing a brahminical thread, composed of white snakes, clad in an elephant's hide, with a necklace of heads and garland of snakes, holding a trident, bow, hand-drum and skull; riding upon the bull Nandya accompanied by ghosts, goblins, spectres, witches, female divinities, imps, sprites and evil spirits, and taking an army with him, Bholanath came forth; his splendid appearance baffles all description; in his ear was an ornament, consisting of the elephant pearl, on his forehead was the moon; he placed the Ganges on his head, and his eyes were very red, of a very frightful aspect and appearing in the form of the destroying deity; he proceeded in this manner, with music and singing, and making his army dance; to describe his appearance is impossible to be understood, it must be seen. At length, after some little delay, he came with his army to the place where Banasoor was standing with his armies of demons. On seeing Muhadeo, Banasoor was delighted, and said, "O sea of compassion! who without you would look after me? Your flaming heat will burn them up, how will the Judoos now survive?" He proceeded to say, "O great king! make this a fair fight, so that each man may have an antagonist opposed to him."</p>  
<p>O great king! when Banasoor had thus spoken, on one side, the army of the demons was standing in battle array, and on the other, the descendants of Judoo were in a state of preparation; drums began to sound on both sides; brave, bold, resolute and mighty heroes began to arrange their weapons; and the irresolute eunuchs and cowards to fly for their lives from the field of battle. At that time Shiv&ugrave; Jee appeared before Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund in the form of the destroying deity. Banasoor was opposed to Bulram Jee; Uskundh encountered Purdiyomun; and in this manner each man closed</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_317"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 317</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with an antagonist. Muhadeo held the bow Pinak in his hand, while the lord of the Judoos had the bow, Sarung. Shiv&ugrave; discharged the arrows of Bruhm&ugrave;: Shree Krishn&ugrave; Jee cut them off with a weapon of Bruhm&ugrave;'s also. Roodr&ugrave; then sent forth a mighty wind, which Huri avoided with fire. Muhadeo upon this kindled a fire, which Moorari extinguished by pouring down rain, and raised an immense flame, which extended to the army of Sudashiv&ugrave;; and burning their beards, mustachios and hair, made all the demons appear of a very terrible aspect. When the army of the demons began to be burnt, and raised a loud cry for deliverance, Bholanath cooled the burnt and half-burnt bodies of the demons, ghosts and goblins, by pouring down rain; and being greatly enraged was on the point of letting fly the arrows of Narayun: but upon reflection, he abstained from doing so, and kept them back. After this, Shree Krishn&ugrave; Jee discharged the arrows of Sloth; and having stupified them all, began to cut down the army of demons, just as a husbandman would cut grain. On beholding this exploit, when Muhadeo thought to himself, and said, "That it would be absolutely necessary to engage in and prolong the battle, so as to involve universal destruction," Uskundh, mounted a peacock, and ascending into mid-air, began to discharge arrows upon the army of Shree Krishn&ugrave; Jee. Then Purdiyomun exclaimed to Huri, "Some one is fighting from above, mounted on a peacock, give the order to fight with energy, and I will kill him now, and he shall fall upon the ground." On hearing this, Krishn&ugrave; gave the order, when Purdiyomun discharged an arrow, which hit the peacock, and Uskundh fell down. Banasoor was highly indignant at the fall of Uskundh, and bending five bows and placing two arrows on each bow, began to shower forth his arrows like rain, and Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund cut them off mid-way.</p>  
<p>O great king! at that time, drums and tambourines resounded on all sides; bards sang chimes in music, streams of blood gushed forth, as though squirted from wounds; in every</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_318"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 318</FONT></A></p>  
<p>direction was seen blood, as red as <i>holee</i> powder; in the midst ghosts, goblins and spectres in various frightful forms, wandered about, playing all sorts of antic tricks; rivers of blood flowed like streams of red colour, it could not be called a battle, but seemed to be more like a <i>holee</i> on both sides. When the battle had been raging for some time, Shree Krishn&ugrave; Jee discharged an arrow, so as to kill Banasoor's charioteer, and the horses started; on the death of his charioteer, Banasoor fled from the field, and Shree Krishn&ugrave; pursued him.</p>  
<p>Having narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O great king! on hearing the news of Banasoor's flight, his mother, whose name was Kutra, of a hideous appearance, with dishevelled hair, came naked before Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund, and began to call out; on seeing her, Krishn&ugrave; shut his eyes and turned his back upon her, when she spoke; in the mean while Banasoor fled, and again rallied his army.</p>  
<p>O great king! Kutra did not withdraw from the presence of Shree Krishn&ugrave; Jee, until Banasoor had returned with a complete army, fully arrayed. Banasoor, on his arrival, engaged in a mighty battle, but could not stand before Krishn&ugrave;; and running away again went to Muhadeo. Beholding Banasoor in a state of fear, Shiv&ugrave; Jee was greatly enraged, and having summoned a fever of a poisonous and inflammatory nature, caused it to spread in the army of Shree Krishn&ugrave; Jee. The fever, which was very violent and burning, whose heat equalled that of the sun, with three heads, nine feet, six hands, three eyes, and of a frightful appearance, came and penetrated the army of Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund. The descendants of Judoo began to be burnt by its heat, and to shake and tremble; at length, after having suffered very great pain, and being alarmed, the descendants of Judoo came to Shree Krishn&ugrave; Jee and said, "O great king! the fever of Shiv&ugrave; has come, and raged violently amongst our whole army, and destroyed many; be pleased now to save us from its fury, otherwise not a single member of the family of Judoo will escape alive."</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_319"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 319</FONT></A></p>  
<p>O great king! having heard this request, and seeing that they were all distressed, Hun sent forth the ague, which rushed upon Muhadeo's fever. On seeing the ague, Muhadeo's fever fled through fear; and continuing his flight, came to Sudashiv&ugrave; Jee. The inflammatory fever then said to Muhadeo, "Afford me an asylum, or the fever of Krishn&ugrave; will destroy me." Muhadeo Jee replied, "There is no one in the three worlds, except Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund, who can drive away the fever he has sent, it is therefore most advisable for you to go to Shree Moorari, the friend of his worshippers." Having heard of Shiv&ugrave;'s speech, and reflected upon it, the inflammatory fever went into the presence of Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund, the root of joy; and joining his hands, beseeching in a most submissive manner and making many entreaties, said, "O sea of compassion, the brother of the poor, the purifier of sinners and kind to the needy! be pleased to pardon my fault and save, me from your fever. O Krishn&ugrave;! you are the lord of Bruhm&ugrave; and all other divinities. Your power, O lord of the world! is incomprehensible; it was you who created and arranged the world. All the delusive power in the universe belongs to you. O Krishn&ugrave;! I have found out your compassionate nature, and having obtained knowledge, look upon you as the creator of the world." The benignant Huri replied, "You have come to seek protection from me, and have therefore escaped, otherwise you would not have escaped with life. I forgive your present fault; but do not again direct your attacks against my worshippers and servants, this is my order to you." The fever said, "O sea of compassion! whoever shall hear this history, ague, tertian ague and tertian fever shall never attack him." After this, Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund said, "Go now to Muhadeo; do not stay here, or else my fever will harass you." On receiving this order, the inflammatory fever took leave, and having made an obeisance, went off to Muhadeo, and the pain of the fever was entirely subdued.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee, said,--O great king! whoever shall hear this conversation need never be afraid of fever. After this Banasoor was very angry; and, taking bows and arrows in all his hands, came opposite to Krishn&ugrave; and bawled out, "I have fought a severe battle with you; but my inclinations are not yet satisfied." When having thus spoken, he began to discharge arrows with all his hands, Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund Jee let loose the quoit, Soodursun, and cut off all his hands, except four, with the same celerity as any one would cut the boughs of a tree. On his hands being cut off, Banasoor fell down stupified, and a river of blood flowed from his wounds in which his arms appeared like alligators. The heads of the elephants, which had been cut off, seemed like drowning crocodiles. Chariots were carried along the stream, like baskets for irrigating fields and like boats. In different places on the field of battle, dogs, jackals, vultures and other birds and beasts were tearing and rending, and fighting and contending for the dead bodies; and crows were flying off with eyes, which they had picked out from heads.</p>  
<p>Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! on seeing this state of the battle field, Banasoor was very sad, and began to feel regret, and afterwards, being deprived of all strength, went to Muhadeo Jee. Then Roodr&ugrave;, after thinking on the matter, said to him, "You must now endeavour to please and captivate Huri." With these words, Shree Muhadeo Jee, taking Banasoor with him, and reading the Vedas to him on the road, came to the place where Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund was standing on the field of battle. Throwing Banasoor down at the feet of Krishn&ugrave;, Shiv&ugrave; Jee said, with joined hands, "O merciful to those who come for sanctuary! this Banasoor has now come to you for protection; be pleased to look upon him with compassion, and do not retain in your mind a recollection of his crime. You repeatedly descend upon the earth, to remove the burthens of the world, and to destroy the wicked, and to</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A></p>  
<p>save the universe. You are, O lord! invisible, impenetrable, without end; for the sake of your worshippers, you come, and are manifest in the world, otherwise, you constantly remain in the form of the embodied spirit. The form of the spirit is this; heaven is his head; the sky, his navel; the earth, his feet; the sea, his belly; Indr&ugrave;, his arms; hills, his nails; clouds, the hair of his head; trees, the hair of his body; the moon and sun, his eyes; Bruhm&ugrave;, his mind; Roodr&ugrave;, his pride; the air, his breath; the closing and opening of his eye-lids, night and day; thunder, his voice. Such is the form in which you constantly dwell: and no one can comprehend it. And this world is a sea of trouble, the water of which is filled with anxiety and delusion. O lord! without the aid of the boat of your name, no one can cross this vast and very difficult sea; and many flounder and are drowned, in attempting it. Whosoever has obtained mortal form, and shall not offer adoration and prayers to you, and shall not keep you in constant remembrance, he shall lose his religion and shall aggravate his sins. He, who has come into the world, and has not called upon your name, has abandoned the water of life and drank poison. In whosesoever's breast you dwell, he has obtained pardon on account of his faith by celebrating with songs your good qualities." Again, Shree Muhadeo Jee said, "O sea of compassion and brother of the poor! your greatness is boundless. Who has power to describe it, and who can understand your actions? Take compassion upon me now, and forgive this Banasoor's transgression; and grant him faith in you; he also possesses a title to be considered your worshipper, because he is a portion of the lineage of Purhlad, your adorer." Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund replied, "Shiv&ugrave; Jee! there is no difference between you and me; and whoever supposes there is a difference, he will fall into the great hell, and shall never obtain me, (that is, gain my favour;) whoever has meditated upon you, will, at his latter end, obtain my favour, this Banasoor called</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A></p>  
<p>upon your name without deceit; and, for this reason, I have made him four-armed; I have protected all on whom you have conferred boons, and will protect those also, to whom you may in future grant blessings."</p>  
<p>O great king! when Krishn&ugrave; had uttered these words, Sudashiv&ugrave; Jee made an obeisance; and, taking leave, went to the mountain Kuelas, accompanied by his army; and Shree Krishn&ugrave; remained standing where he was; Banasoor then joining his hands and bowing his head, said, submissively, "O lord of the poor! as you have compassionately pardoned me, be pleased now to make pure your servant's house by coming to it, and take away Unroodr&ugrave; Jee and Ookha with you." On hearing this, Shree Beharee, the benefactor of his worshippers, taking Purdiyomun Jee with him, went to Banasoor's abode.</p>  
<p>O great king! Banasoor being then highly delighted, conducted Krishn&ugrave;, with a warm welcome, to his house, spreading silken cloths on the road, afterwards he washed his feet and took the water with which his feet had been washed, and sipping it in his hand put it on his head. He then began to say, "The water in which his feet have been washed, so difficult to be obtained by all, I have this day obtained by the favour of Huri, and obliterated the sins of each birth, he who has drank of the water of the Ganges will, undoubtedly, obtain heaven; he who has seen the Bhageruttee has gained the whole world."</p>  
<p>O great king! having thus spoken and brought Unroodr&ugrave; Jee and Ookha, he said in the presence of Krishn&ugrave;, joining his hands, "Be pleased to forgive my fault; what was predestined has happened, I give this Ookha as a servant to you." When he had thus spoken, Banasoor gave his daughter in marriage, according to the injunctions of the Vedas, and bestowed upon her a boundless dowry.</p>  
<p>Having narrated thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said,--O great king! on the marriage taking place, Shree</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_323"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 323</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Krishn&ugrave; Chund, having restored Banasoor's confidence, seated him upon the royal throne; and, accompanied by his grandson and grand-daughter, took leave, and sounding the large kettledrum, went thence, with all the descendants of Judoo, to the city of Dwarka. On hearing of their arrival all the inhabitants of Dwarka went outside of the city, and escorted Krishn&ugrave; in musical procession; at that time the inhabitants of the city sang songs of rejoicing, and indulged in festivities in the markets, roads, cross-roads, sheds and houses; and in the royal palace Shree Rookmunee and all the women sang songs of congratulation, and observed all the ceremonies usual on festive occasions; the gods, seated in their chariots, and raining down flowers from the sky, raised cries of victory; and joy was universally diffused throughout the city, both inside each house and outside. Bulram, the abode of happiness, and Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund, the root of joy, having then allowed all the descendants of Judoo to take leave, went to live at their ease and happily at the royal palace, taking Unroodr&ugrave; and Ookha with them; the wives of Krishn&ugrave; were delighted at beholding Ookha; when she was brought into the palace, her mother-in-law gave her a blessing, and clasped her into her bosom; and being highly pleased at seeing her, adorned her with ornaments.</p>
