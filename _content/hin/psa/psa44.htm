<p>SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O lord of the earth! having seen the gardener's great attachment, Spree Krishn&ugrave; Chund was rejoiced, and granted him a blessing for his faith; and as he proceeded onwards, he saw standing before him in a lane a hump-backed woman, who had cups and broad plates, filled with saffron and sandal in her hand. Huri enquired, "Who art thou, and where art thou taking these things?" She replied, "O kind to the poor! I am the servant of Kuns; my name is 'Hump-back,' and I constantly rub and anoint Kuns' body with sandal; and in my own mind, sing of your many excellent qualities. Through the glorious favour of which I have obtained a sight of you to-day; and gained the greatest happiness in my present birth, and have seen the object my eyes most wished to see. The wish of this slave now is, with your permission, to rub you with sandal." Seeing her great faith, Huri said, "Rub me with it, if it will give you any pleasure." On hearing these words the humpbacked woman, with very great affection and endearment, anointed Krishn&ugrave;; who, perceiving her sincere attachment, took compassion on her, and placing his foot on hers, and putting his two fingers under her chin, caused her to jump up, and made her straight. On being touched by Huri's hand,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A></p>  
<p>she became very beautiful, and said in a most supplicating manner to Krishn&ugrave;, "O lord of favour! as through your beneficence you have made this slave's body straight, be pleased to extend your compassion by coming to my house, and purifying it; and having taken repose confer happiness on your servant." Huri taking hold of her hand, and smiling, replied, "Thou hast removed all my fatigue by rubbing me with cool sandal: thy beauty is great; and the good qualities of thy mind, and thy virtues are excellent. My friendship for thee shall be without end. After having destroyed Kuns, I will come to see thee." Saying these words, Krishn&ugrave; went on; and the hump-backed woman, who had been made straight, went home; and having filled a square place with coloured meal, perfumes and sweetmeats, and entertaining a firm hope of again meeting Krishn&ugrave;, began to indulge in rejoicings.</p>  
<p>The women of Muthoora came there, and on seeing her, were astonished, and said--"Great, very great is your good fortune, O hump-back! to whom Bruhm&ugrave; has shown affection! What difficult act of penance have you performed, that the lord of cowherdesses has visited you and taken you in his arms? We, who are without bodily defects, have not seen Huri, he has had an interview with you, and shown you the greatest affection." The women continued talking thus, whilst Krishn&ugrave; went about, looking at Muthoora.</p>  
<p>Whilst they were engaged in seeing the city, Krishn&ugrave; arrived with his companions at the gate, where the bow was. On seeing them approach, besmeared with colours of different kinds, and in a state of intoxication, the sentinels called out angrily, "Where are you coming, you stupid villagers? go away some distance off, this is the royal gate." Huri, pretending not to hear what the sentinels said, went straight to the spot where the bow of Muhadeo, which was very large and weighty, and as long as three palm trees, was placed. On arrival there, he immediately took it up, and, bending it with</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_150"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 150</FONT></A></p>  
<p>ease to its full extent, broke it in pieces, in the same way that an elephant breaks sugar-cane in pieces.</p>  
<p>All the sentinels of Kuns, who were guarding the bow, rushed forward and attacked him, but Krishn&ugrave; overthrew and killed them also. On beholding these exploits, the inhabitants of the city began to reflect, and say fearlessly to each other, "Behold! the Raja, sitting in his own house, has himself invited his own death; he will not escape alive from the hands of these two brothers." And having heard the crash, caused by the breaking of the bow, Kuns enquired, with great terror from his people, "What had occasioned so great a noise?" In the mean while, many of his attendants, who were looking on at a distance, came with their heads uncovered, and called out, "By the oath of the great Raja! Bulram and Krishn&ugrave;, by coming into the city, have caused great disturbance: they have broken in pieces the bow of Shiv&ugrave;, and killed all the guards."</p>  
<p>On hearing these words, Kuns assembled a great many powerful men, and said to them, "Accompany these men, and having by artifice or force, destroyed Krishn&ugrave; and Buldeo, bring their bodies here immediately." When Kuns had thus spoken, they took their arms and weapons, and went forth to meet the two brothers. They had no sooner called out to them, than the brothers killed them all. When Huri saw, that not a single attendant of Kuns was left, he said to Bulram Jee, "Brother! it is some time since we came here; we ought to return to our encampment, because our father Nund will be expecting us, and will be anxious on our account."</p>  
<p>Having thus said, Krishn&ugrave; returned with Bulram and the cowherds to the encampment. On arriving, he said to the chief Nund, "Father! we have been to the city, and seen fine games, and have shown our honorary dresses to the cowherds."</p>  
<p>Then Nund, looking at him, said, "Your old practices will not leave you. This is the habitation of the Raja Kuns, and not our own village in the forest of Bruj. Keep my instructions, son, in minci, and do not commit any violence here."</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When Nund Rae had thus instructed him, Nund Lal replied, with great coaxing and endearment of manner, "Father! we are hungry; please give us whatever our mother may have sent for us to eat." Nund, at these words, produced the different articles of food they had brought with them; and Krishn&ugrave; and Buldeo, and the cowherds partook of them.</p>  
<p>Having proceeded thus far in the narrative, Shree Shookdeo, the sage, said,--O great king! Krishn&ugrave; and all his party on their return ate their supper in the highest glee, and went to sleep; whilst Kuns, having heard what Krishn&ugrave; had done, suffered the greatest anxiety of mind; and could not obtain any ease or relaxation of his griefs, whether reclining or standing erect. His mind mourned, and did not communicate its griefs to any one. It is said, as the weevil eats into wood, and no one knows the pain the wood suffers: thus, when there is anxiety in the mind, the understanding, strength and body are diminished. At length, being in a state of great fear, he went into, his house, and reclined upon a bed; but he was so alarmed, that he could not sleep.</p>  
<p>He remained awake during three watches of the night, when he shut his eye-lids, and had a moment's sleep. Then in a dream he saw, in imagination, the shadow of a body, wandering about without a head. He sometimes bathed naked upon the sand; and then, having eaten poison, rushed about, mounted on an ass. He took up his abode in a burial ground with ghosts, wearing garlands of blood-red flowers. Then he saw trees all round him, on which young children were sitting.</p>  
<p>O great king! when Kuns had this dream, he was in a state of such excessive agitation, that he awoke; and being occupied with anxious thoughts, rose up, and came forth; and having summoned all his ministers, said, "Go immediately, and have the place of amusement sprinkled over with water, and thoroughly arranged and prepared, and invite Nund and Oopnund, and all the inhabitants of Bruj, and Basoodeo and all the members of the family of Judoo; and invite also all</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Rajas, who may have come here. Whilst this is being done, I will come also."</p>  
<p>Having received Kuns' orders, the counsellors came to the place of amusement, and having had it thoroughly swept, and sprinkled with water, they spread silken cloths; and having suspended garlands, and strings of flowers, and flags, and banners, and having caused musical instruments of all kinds to be played, they issued invitations to all.</p>  
<p>They, who were invited, came and took their seats on their chairs of state. In the meantime, the Raja Kuns came, filled with very great pride, and took his seat on a platform erected for him. The gods, at that time, seated in their chariots, began to look down from the sky.</p>
