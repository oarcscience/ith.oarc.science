<p>SHREE SHOOKDEO JEE said,--O great king! Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund Jee having seated Suhdeo on the royal throne; and, having given him advice, said to him, "Raja! go now and bring those Rajas, whom your father kept shut up in a hill cave." On hearing these words from the mouth of Krishn&ugrave;, Joorasindhoo's son, Suhdeo, consenting to bring them, went to the cave; and, having removed a stone from the mouth of it, brought forth twenty thousand eight hundred Rajas, and took them to the presence of Huri. On coming there with handcuffs and leg-irons, iron collars on their necks, their nails and hair grown long, bodies emaciated, depressed in spirits, and dirty in appearance, all the Rajas stood in rows before Krishn&ugrave;, joining their hands, they submissively said, "O sea of compassion and brother of the poor! you have thought of us in good time, otherwise we should have died; by seeing you our lives have been restored, and our former griefs have been obliterated."</p>  
<p>On hearing these words, O great king! when Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund, the sea of favour, looked upon them; Suhdeo immediately took them away; and, having had their handcuffs, leg-irons and the rings with which their fetters were fastened, cut off, causing them to be shaved and bathed, and washed, entertaining them with all sorts of delicacies, giving them clothes</p>

<p>and ornaments, and furnishing them with arms, brought them again into Huri's presence; at that time Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund Jee appeared to them in a form with four arms, and holding a shell, quoit, club and lotus. On beholding the form Krishn&ugrave; had assumed, the Rajas joining their hands said, "Lord! you liberate mortals from the difficult bonds of the world; what difficulty was there to you to release us from the imprisonment of Joorasindhoo? As you have compassionately released us from this severe confinement, release us also from this well in the form of a dwelling, free us from desire, anger, avarice and inordinate affection, in order that we may sit down in retirement and meditate on you, and cross over the sea of the world."</p>  
<p>Shree Shookdeo Jee said, Raja! when all the Rajas had spoken these words, so full of knowledge and devotion, Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund Jee was delighted and said, "They who worship me with sincerity of mind, shall certainly obtain deliverance and salvation; bondage and release are trials of the mind, to him whose mind is firm; the house and forest are alike; have no other anxiety in your minds, than living happily at your homes; carry on a well regulated government, protect the subject; attend upon the cow and brahmin; do not speak falsely; avoid lust, anger, avarice and pride; worship Huri with sentiments of religion, and you will certainly obtain eternal happiness; whoever, coming into the world, has indulged in pride, has not lived long; behold! how many pride has brought to destruction. His strength destroyed Pursooram, celebrated as being very powerful, and having a thousand arms. Raja Bynoo became Rawun, and was ruined by his pride. Bhomasoor and Banasoor, and Kuns were all exterminated through pride. Let no one be intoxicated with prosperity, or indulge in pride; he who shuns pride may live without fear."</p>  
<p>Having thus spoken, Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund said to all the Rajas, "Go now to your homes, have meetings with you</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_371"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 371</FONT></A></p>  
<p>relations, arrange the affairs of your kingdoms and settle yourselves upon your thrones, and come quickly, about the time of my own arrival, to Hustinapoor, to the Raja Joodisthur's, to assist at the royal sacrifice."</p>  
<p>O great king! when Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund Jee had thus spoken, Suhdeo instantly procured all things necessary for the departure of the Rajas. They received them; and, taking leave of Krishn&ugrave;, went each to his own country, and Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund Jee also travelled thence joyfully, accompanied by Suhdeo and Bheem, and Urjoon, and came to Hustinapoor. Krishn&ugrave; having gone, after his arrival, to the Raja Joodisthur, explained to him all the circumstances, attending the death of Joorasindhoo, and the release of the Rajas.</p>  
<p>Having recited thus much of the history, Shree Shookdeo Jee said to the Raja Pureechit,--O great king! about the time of the arrival of Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund, the root of joy, at Hustinapoor, the Rajas arrived also with their armies, and with presents; and, having had an interview with Raja Joodisthur, and offered their presents, they encamped on all sides of Hustinapoor by order of Shree Krishn&ugrave; Chund Jee, and prepared to assist in the sacrifice.</p>
