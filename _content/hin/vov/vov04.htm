<p>Every thing is called the act of deity. But there is a deity superior to this god. That god slew Vishnu and he destroyed the <A HREF="errata.htm#36">appearance</A> of Siva (<i>abhava</i>) Surely this is the great God indeed if thou consider it well.</p>  
<p align="center">201</p>  
<p>They call a pot, olla; they name a hill, collis; salt they call sal; are they not however one? The languages alone are diverse, the essence is one.</p>  
<p align="center">202</p>  
<p>Vishnu, Siva, and Brahma all see the leaf but view it who will, none can perceive the branch. Were the branch behold, <A HREF="errata.htm#37">would</A> any abstain from lauding it?</p>  
<p align="center">203</p>  
<p>He, he, and he exist in him; neither he, he, nor he is He. He that unites them with him--go to--he is the Divinity.</p>  
<p align="center">204</p>  
<p>If thou know the beauty of the five letters, in these five cloth beatitude consist. He (the divinity) is the one who dwells in that five.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_58"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 58</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">205</p>  
<p>Slay Brahma, and mingle him with Vishnu. Slay Vishnu and resolve him into Siva. Slay Siva and become thyself the Siva yogee (or chief spirit).</p>  
<p align="center">206</p>  
<p>To them who understand the meaning of the excellent <i>sankhya yoga</i> I will in this world declare the truth through the most noble <i>raja-yoga</i>. Listen to the greatness of Siva (pure sanskrit).</p>  
<p align="center">207</p>  
<p>Why all this grief. If with singleness of heart thou extinguish thy desires by immersing thy soul in (Hari, Hara and Aaja, Vishnu, Siva and Brahma) the three gods and maintain a subdued spirit, happiness shall be formed within thee.</p>  
<p align="center">208</p>  
<p>The body of this visible world is a vessel of God, the life therein is air. The sun, moon and fire are his eyes (number, body assemblage of eyes). There is no God but this.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">209</p>  
<p>He who slays his great (five) foes, and vanquishes cupid, and has learnt the five lettered name (<i>Namassivaya</i>), he attains the porch of him, the five faced who is entitled <i>Bhava</i> (emphatically existence i.e., Siva).</p>  
<p align="center">210</p>  
<p>Of what use is that Saiva faith that knows not the path through this universe compounded of inanimate and animate bodies and lingams, They shall not know the becoming (or the act of transformation into) Hara the eight bodied.</p>  
<p align="center">211</p>  
<p>He who divideth the lord Iswara into seven parts and has dedicated by the ceremony of pouring his whole body to God by any unfailing practice of such conduct shall become the chief of yogees.</p>  
<p align="center">212</p>  
<p>He who hath attained the bliss that dwells in the five lettered name, shall shine both here and hereafter in bliss. To know this life and next, this is deity.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">213</p>  
<p>Mighty let us to cut pieces the six and seven foes of our souls and in the defection of wisdom unless we worship the dwellings of the three gods how shall we attain happiness? The <A HREF="errata.htm#38">forehead</A> mark, food and scars on the body and daubings with ashes are in vain applied. Can the sons of earth hereby attain bliss through the love of these? O Vemana, the noblest of princes?</p>  
<p align="center">214</p>  
<p>If thou be thyself converted into those three Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, who created, saved and destroy the three worlds and praise them, this man shall be transformed into the deity.</p>  
<p align="center">215</p>  
<p>He who hath reduced Brahma, Vishnu and Siva in one shall become a <i>parama yogee</i> and the divinity. How can we comprehend one who thus is equal to the divinity.</p>  
<p align="center">216</p>  
<p>Those who will not cease from the radical bond of the root (the mind) unless they destroy the eight creeds, how should they be called sages, rather are they mad.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">217</p>  
<p>The lingam is the great Siva; the life of the body if that creature be purified he shall attain God. Were there two paths how could the deity be attained?</p>  
<p align="center">218</p>  
<p>Seize the robbers (passions) and put them to death; spare but one (the mind) whoever he be that knows this secret, this shall be to him the fruit that he seeks.</p>  
<p align="center">219</p>  
<p>Let us seize the four robbers (four lusts and smite them on the head, <i>cama</i>, <i>crodha</i>, <i>lobha</i> and <i>moha</i>) but spare one (the mind) to the men of the mind that they may attain the fruits of wisdom.</p>  
<p align="center">220</p>  
<p>The man who hath learnt to view the order of the secret charms of the six and three temples, he shall attain the path to perfection. True is this doctrine.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">221</p>  
<p>If thou gain the favour of Siva and thereby destroy the first principle (<i>agnyana</i>) of thy tree (body) and cast it (ignorance) as its root (<i>maya</i>) and thus worship Siva, thou shalt be as a mountain and how should death befall thee?</p>  
<p align="center">222</p>  
<p>Have you seen the three worlds, beheld and attained to the three objects that possess the three qualities and the beatitude that dwells there-in?</p>  
<p align="center">223</p>  
<p>He who looks upon rain, wind and sunshine as equal and abstains from thinking of honour or the like and continue in subjection--this is a stout hearted saint (yogee).</p>  
<p align="center">224</p>  
<p>(The <i>Parabramham</i>) Under this tree there is not even the least shade; If the waters of delusion are unable to overflow this tree, it is as tree, how should that tree die?</p>  
<p align="center">225</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>(The power of delusion) Often in the midst of her reality shakes her head in scorn, she often laughs, she is no woman, what means woman? and What is the name of the being?</p>  
<p align="center">226</p>  
<p>(mystic) When the five birds (passions) were found in their hole (the body) and cried, one of them sought the origin. The parrot that sought him became him.</p>  
<p align="center">227</p>  
<p>If the unknown being by meditation appear in thy mind thereafter to say he is dead merely signifies his ultimate tie; when, thou die give up all earthy connections and worship (Sarv&#275;sa) the Lord of all (total obscurity).</p>  
<p align="center">228</p>  
<p>The words of Vemana, if soundly understood, are surely the essence of all the Vedas. If thou do not invite and comprehend thy greatness in the five-lettered name shalt thou enjoy prosperity?</p>  
<p align="center">229</p>  
<p>Wisdom is the prime teacher to this whole world. The one <i>Pranava-mantra</i> is the original teacher (teacher of teachers) and thirdly, truly, the <i>Gayatri mantra</i> is the teacher of our actions.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">230</p>  
<p>If thou understand the mystic syllable '<i>Om</i>' (Pranava mantra) if it be in thy mind, the multitude of the acts of the mind shall not in the least affect thee. Then shall the devotee shine, a lamp of Divine knowledge.</p>  
<p align="center">231</p>  
<p>Understand the power of the 'Om', Pranava mantra--it is the lingam. It resides in the three persons. Can others (those who are without) know and worship it?</p>  
<p align="center">232</p>  
<p>He who hath united into one the composition of letters of the mystic syllable 'Om', and the visible mundane egg, he shall enjoy that letter 'Om'; and shall in certainty inherit bliss.</p>  
<p align="center">233</p>  
<p>Why thou hast truly entered into the import of the mystic form of letters in 'Om' why persist in reading ten millions of other subjects? Fitly and visibly, shall the two letters Siva, constitute purity of soul in thee.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">234</p>  
<p>They who have rightly ordered their inner man, and considering justly the state of their heart, thrust it away, these are men of understanding. <A HREF="errata.htm#39">These</A> shall dwell in delight in heaven--(terribly difficult).</p>  
<p align="center">235</p>  
<p>They talk and talk of Divinity. What is in this Divinity? Were they to apply themselves and understand and see he is close to them. They cannot perceive the (<i>mudricas</i>) shadows that flit before the eyes closed in meditation.</p>  
<p align="center">236</p>  
<p>The soul dwells in the little world of the corporal frame; and the sun inhabits the greater world of the universe and the divinity dwells in the sound, the globules of the splendour.</p>  
<p align="center">237</p>  
<p>The fair (<i>nadam</i>) sound is produced from the (jyotee) visionary lights. The fair (bindu) globules are born from the nadam; and from the <i>bindu</i> are earth and heaven born.</p>  
<p align="center">238</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_66"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 66</FONT></A></p>  
<p>All those who comprehending in their mind the scheme (or knack) of gazing at the sky (the khechari mudra) and who dispute not vainly these have subdued delusion. Can it other-wise be subdued?</p>  
<p align="center">239</p>  
<p>The hooded serpent by knowing well to fix its gaze like as the crow under the cover gazes, thus does the yogee by inner wisdom gaze; this is the path of perfection.</p>  
<p align="center">240</p>  
<p>How subtle is the interior vision? Pure is the sight of sight. Equal to the deity is the eye of our eye<A HREF="errata.htm#40">.</A></p>  
<p align="center">241</p>  
<p>If thou carefully fix thy sight on the top of thy nose, then does a man correctly view the pre-eminent. He who hath known the pre-eminent cutteth off all secular ties.</p>  
<p align="center">242</p>  
<p>Unless he sees (i.e., comprehend) the divine name (the mystic syllable named <i>Pranava</i>), a man cannot become faithful Unless he behold the lights (<i>jyotees</i>) that appear to the closed eyes, he is not in the way. Unless he behold the everlasting he is not in the state of beatitude.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_67"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 67</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">248</p>  
<p>By the <i>mudricas</i> in the mind being rightly ordered, as thou gazest on the <i>linga</i> of soul (the deity), it shall be manifested to thee and shall it be bestowed on thee devoid of teacher? That thou <A HREF="errata.htm#41">should&#8217;st</A> understand it?</p>  
<p align="center">244</p>  
<p>(Mystic) By gazing at the blight mudras, happiness or sorrow is produced. Looking at the blessing of the mudras and enjoying it, thou shalt shine as a beatified saint.</p>  
<p align="center">245</p>  
<p>Unless thou dissolve the splendours of three affections, how should one attain permanent bliss in a fit manner? Unless thou annihilate thy mind can beatitude be put into thy hand,</p>  
<p align="center">246</p>  
<p>Fixed in meditation, with eyes and ears closed, heard a ringing as of a bell in my mind; beholding I beheld a pure splendour and attaining the divinity. I beheld it within me. This is no hypocrisy. Look then to me.</p>  
<p align="center">247</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_68"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 68</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Behold the (<i>bayalu-&#257;c&#257;sa</i>) sky and consider that splendour, view the departure of that light, uninjured. He that can view uninjured shall stand unshaken.</p>  
<p align="center">248</p>  
<p>Lose not understanding behold the enlightening <i>calas</i>--confuse not the <i>calas</i> steadily behold the inner heaven (<i>bayalu-antar&#257;c&#257;sa</i>); confuse not that heaven and steadily thou shalt behold the divinity.</p>  
<p align="center">249</p>  
<p>In meditation if after gazing steadily thou persist not to the end, when thy sight fails again push on thy glance again. Him that fails unable to push it on, they look on as very light person.</p>  
<p align="center">250</p>  
<p><i>Munees</i> esteem the splendours that appear to the devotee fixed in meditation wonderful and excellent. If they understand, this is the chief spirit.</p>  
<p align="center">251</p>  
<p>He is no exalted sage who <A HREF="errata.htm#42">cannot</A> view the globules or his ringing sound, nor unite the splendours. Whatever pains he takes how shall he attain beatitude?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_69"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 69</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">252</p>  
<p>Let us know the time of attaining the truth and thus become the eternal. Let us thoroughly attain the mystic form (bindu) that exists with (lit. in) the sound (nadam). Then shall we attain bliss, and participate with no others in that enjoyment.</p>  
<p align="center">253</p>  
<p>He that can convert the <i>nadam</i> into the <i>bindu</i> and into the <i>nadam</i> again, also convert the <i>nadu</i>, the <i>bindu</i>, and the <i>kala</i> into one (place) and perceive the sound, this man shall become the <i>yogee</i> full of bliss.</p>  
<p align="center">254</p>  
<p>The devotee who knoweth the internal sound produced in meditation, shall with joy know the soul <A HREF="errata.htm#43">within</A> him and attain felicity. That sound is the giver of beatitude, proclaim this for the consolation of all men.</p>  
<p align="center">255</p>  
<p>The yogee who knows the sound (<i>nadam</i>) shall in his mind know the path described in the <i>vedanta</i> proclaim abroad that this sound is the means of beatitude.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">256</p>  
<p>Lose the idea of "mine and thine" and be illustrious in the belief of exalted abstraction (nadam). By the absence of the belief and <A HREF="errata.htm#44">disbelief</A>, thou shalt attain prudence.</p>  
<p align="center">257</p>  
<p>He who through instruction hath attained the (<i>nadam</i>, <i>the bindu</i> and <i>the kala</i>) ringing sound, the globules and the splendours, that he perceives who in meditation seals his eyes and ears, he who establishes these in his soul and well fixes his wandering mind, this is the mighty sage whose soul shall obtain its passage through the sagittal suture of the skull.</p>  
<p align="center">258</p>  
<p>The saint who knoweth the (nadam) ringing sound shall know the indivisible God and the mystic syllable. That is the seed of the five charactered name (<i>Namassivaya</i>). Proclaim to men that the <i>nadam</i> in the mind is the beatitude.</p>  
<p align="center">259</p>  
<p>Convert the <i>nadam</i> and <i>bindu</i> into one <i>nadam</i> and convert the nadam, the bindu and the kala into a single nadam, to meditate while beholding the nadam, this is perfection.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">260</p>  
<p>Consider what is the twenty sixth essence. It is a wondrous vital spirit. If thou unite it intimately with the chief spirit in the (<i>gurupada</i>) cerebral suture. Him who doth this they shall surely call saint.</p>  
<p align="center">261</p>  
<p>Establishing the six gods in the six limbs and fixing the chamber of the head firm on the one pillar of the spine, the reckoning is to allow but one ruler (man) to each house.</p>  
<p align="center">262</p>  
<p>There are six sustainers of the earth. There are the six rulers, princes of the earth. The noble and great warriors are these know that the body is their chariot and mark the result.</p>  
<p align="center">263</p>  
<p>The divinity (<i>atma linga</i>) dwells in what is termed the <i>ajna chacra</i> (the space between the eyes). It is only by gazing intently on this part that shines so nobly, that beatitude shall be attained by men.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A></p>  
<p>28 4</p>  
<p>Cut down in thy soul the five chacras, nobly surmount those chacras and behold the plain beyond them.</p>  
<p align="center">265</p>  
<p>The tree of beatitude has no (beginning) root but four fair boughs (forms of existence, animal, vegetable, insects, minerals). It is open to view and produces fruit. If thou eat them, they have no taste but cause appetite.</p>  
<p align="center">266</p>  
<p>In that house in the threshold of which three ways meet with air, in the place where those three meet cloth Siva dwell (mystic of the body--worthless).</p>  
<p align="center">267</p>  
<p>He who has the skill firmly to dwell in the six and three chacrams knowing their beauty he hath found the path to perfection.</p>  
<p align="center">268</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>If thou meditate in thy mind, in the sagittal suture shall there stand, He who is ruler of all to all who worship him does he give both sustenance and salvation.</p>  
<p align="center">269</p>  
<p>Mind, words and works--if thou give up these three, and walk not up and down the royal path (a mystic part of the body), then shall any loss befall the yogee?</p>  
<p align="center">270</p>  
<p>He who restraineth the six (lotuses) mortal parts of his body, and carefully fixeth his anus or backbone, and the parts above it and who also fixeth his mind is of course a twice born Brahmin.</p>  
<p align="center">271</p>  
<p>Go and say, I have cast a great shame upon Vemana himself who named Vishnu and disgraced Siva and even Brahma. Let the one God alone be honoured.</p>  
<p align="center">272</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Among them who are not wetted with rain and them who are not those who relying not on Vemana, follow not him (conduct themselves) wherever thou seek are not to be found. Never shall we see his equal.</p>  
<p align="center">273</p>  
<p>Are there not eighty four lacs (84,00,000) of tribes of animals in all? As for the manner of their production in the earth, is he indeed that hath described it in your hearing, still to be called the mad Vemana.</p>  
<p align="center">274</p>  
<p>He has thrown away his caste as water and slain his teachers (as Bheeshma in Bh&#257;rata) and nobly lied lies as big as elephants. Yet his name is just king--a great <i>Vepa</i> seed, bitter and worthless,</p>  
<p align="center">275</p>  
<p>Locomotive animals all, till death, eat all excellent tasted things without leaving them, But immovable animals (hills and trees) are ever dropping their pride sorrowing remain.</p>  
<p align="center">276</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></p>  
<p>You will say "We are versed in the knowledge of God" Ask yourselves--what is the meaning of Divinity? Tell, if you know whether he be whiteness, blackness or redness?</p>  
<p align="center">277</p>  
<p>He knoweth not what sort of man he is, He knoweth not his former birth. For so debased a life why should be so careful? He knoweth not that this world is but an (<i>maya</i>) illusion of Ishwara!</p>  
<p align="center">278</p>  
<p>He who wanders the various lands under the titles of the stranger, the recluse, of the noble Ganga of a hill or in the character of a man of exceeding beauty is yet one sole spirit of life.</p>  
<p align="center">279</p>  
<p>Surely a teacher is requisite in the Siva creed and a teacher is evidently requisite in the Vishnu faith. What can the wretch of a debased nature learn without a teacher?</p>  
<p align="center">280</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_76"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 76</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Surya lover of the lotus, was born in the race of Vishnu, husband of Lakshmi, the noble mother and as he duly goes his course, going about the lands and the earth; Vishnu nourisher of the elephant, travels as he does (for Surya is in reality but a form of Vishnu).</p>  
<p align="center">281</p>  
<p>Let us know the source of the three Gods. First know one of the three, Then fitly with thy tongue offer praise.</p>  
<p align="center">282</p>  
<p>The water in which the race of saints came plunging in defiled it. In which even Brahma being immersed cannot lift his head out of it. All men, whatever are plunged in this pond upto the middle.</p>  
<p align="center">283</p>  
<p>By means of ambrosia all become stable. But if we seek ambrosia none can find it; ambrosia turns into venom--what a marvel this is!</p>  
<p align="center">284</p>  
<p>Know well that this world is partly black, partly red, partly white (the three <i>gunas</i>--tamas, rajas, satwa). What is the reason that it should be all alike?</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_77"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 77</FONT></A></p>  
<p align="center">285</p>  
<p>The ultimate has no lameness in his foot; He has no name in the dispute of his world. Understand that this is the bliss of others.</p>  
<p align="center">286</p>  
<p>He was wonderfully born in the Brahmin class and being sunk in sin flowed thence into the other castes. Though born in the lotus, the sole of his foot is not wetted with the holy stream.</p>  
<p align="center">287</p>  
<p>The king of hills (Himavat) is his father-in-law, the daughter of he hill (Parvathi) is his wife; a hill Kailas is his home; and gold hill, <i>meru</i>, his bow. Thus O Siva, thou art Lord of Hills. How art thou still given to such go between practices. (This is a sneer at sexual love originating in the creator).</p>  
<p align="center">288</p>  
<p>The house is worldly connections, the bow is his weapon. The Five--lettered God is mother of redemption but all uniting with woman is but a lie.</p>  
<p align="center">289</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_78"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 78</FONT></A></p>  
<p>If you <A HREF="errata.htm#45">twitch</A> off a head of Brahma, they call it murdering Brahma. Brahma is a Vysya (a man of the third class), is he a Brahmin? If Brahma had even died would Siva become a Brahmin slayer. (This is an allusion to the base of the lingam representing Brahma).</p>  
<p align="center">290</p>  
<p>Siva assumed the shape of the sharabha and slew Narasimha; which (<A HREF="errata.htm#46">masculine</A>, <i>y&#275;di</i>) God is greater than Siva? Where is there one more worthy to be looked to?</p>  
<p align="center">291</p>  
<p>Seeing that Vishnu abhorred not himself to be born in ten incarnations, to grow in them as to delight in them; if then thou do away the lustre of the noble married state shall thou hereby become one of the excellent.</p>  
<p align="center">292</p>  
<p>Agajata (Paravati) causes him (Siva) who gave her half his body (see the mythology) to be slain (i.e., her worship as shacti, supersedes his)? If he cannot revenge this cruel is he man and not a woman?</p>  
<p align="center">293</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Veda is on every subject (words of the choultry). The signification of the Veda is a refuge (a branch of hold). Its rules are worthy to be known. Proclaim it consolingly in the world that the sound produced by closing the ears is subject to the state of meditation.</p>  
<p align="center">294</p>  
<p>He who has seen the similarity of every generation and by wisdom knows the nature of the bathing, eating and lying in each, that man who thus knows how to walk is the <i>grihasta</i> (i.e., a perfectly virtuous man of the world).</p>  
<p align="center">295</p>  
<p>If defilement attaches to food, it attaches also to the soul that thereby subsists. Food that is digested within us (let our soul) this is defilement. Food is the purification of the soul and the soul the purifier of the food. Thus united as the earth and sky are.</p>  
<p align="center">296</p>  
<p>Daily does defilement flow down through the nine <A HREF="errata.htm#47">orifices</A>, If this defilement of humanity be done away, man dies; foulness that never dies is produced in the loins.</p>  
<p align="center">297</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_80"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 80</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Heedless of foulness and impurity, they eat three times a day, and worship him who sports within the soul (Brahma). He who thus attains the future life is the complete <i>yogee</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">298</p>  
<p>That pious man who delights in bestowing house, garden, and field on Brahmins, long shall he rule the earth, and be filled with enjoyments.</p>
