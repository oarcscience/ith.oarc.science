He then pours water into it (the hole), for whatever is injured or torn in this earth that is healed by water: by means of the water he thus joins together and heals what is injured and torn in her.</p>

XI, 38] 'Let flow the divine waters, the honey-sweet, for health, for progeny!'--honey means sap (essence): thus, 'the sapful, for health, for progeny;'--'from their seed let plants spring forth, full-berried!' for full-berried plants indeed spring forth from the seat of the waters.</p>

XI, 39] 'May V&acirc;yu M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van heal,'--V&acirc;yu M&acirc;tari<I>s</I>van, doubtless, is he (the wind) that blows yonder;--'the broken heart of thee stretched out with upward look!' for this (hole) is the broken heart of this earth stretched out with upward look;--'thou who goest along by the breath of the gods,'--for he (the wind) indeed goes along by means of the breath of all the gods;--'to thee, Ka, be vasha<I>t</I> (success), O god!'--Ka ('Who?') doubtless is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, for him he makes this earth to be the Vasha<I>t</I>, for there is so far no other oblation than that.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:4:3:5">6:4:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. He then heals her by means of the quarters, for whatever is injured and torn in this earth, that is healed by the quarters: by means of the quarters he thus draws and joins together what is injured and torn in her. He joins together this and this quarter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, whence these two quarters are joined</p>

<p>together; then this one and this one, whence these two also are joined together: first thus, then thus; then thus, then thus. This is moving (from left) to right, for so (it goes) to the gods: with this and this one a means of healing is prepared; with this and this one he heals.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:4:3:6">6:4:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. He then takes up together the black antelope skin and the lotus-leaf; for the lotus-leaf is the womb, and with the womb he takes up that infused seed: whence the infused seed is taken up by the womb. [He does so, with, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XI, 40] 'Wellborn with splendour, the refuge and shelter, hath he settled down in the light;' for well-born he is, and he settles down in the refuge, and shelter, and light.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:4:3:7">6:4:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. He then ties it (the lump) up: he thereby keeps the seed within the womb; whence the seed kept within the womb does not escape. With a string (he ties it), for with the string they yoke the draught beast;--with a triple one of reed grass: the significance of this has been told&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

He lays it round (the skin), with, 'Invest thyself, O lustrous Agni, in the many-coloured garment!' In the sacrifice the cord is Varu<I>n</I>ic; having thereby made it non-Varu<I>n</I>ic, he makes him put on (the skin) as one would make a garment be put on.</p>

He then takes it and rises;--that Agni being yonder sun, he thus causes yonder sun to rise;--with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XI, 41)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, 'Rise, thou of good rites,'--the sacrifice doubtless is a rite: thus, 'rise thou, well</p>

<p>worthy of sacrifice;'--'Guard us with godly wisdom!'--that is, 'whatever divine wisdom is thine, therewith guard us!'--'Most brilliant to see with great light,'--that is, 'in order to be seen most brilliant with great light;'--'hither, O Agni, come thou with praises!'--the praises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are the steeds: thus, 'hither, O Agni, come with the steeds.'</p>

He then lifts it upwards from there towards the east; for this Agni is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun upwards from here in the east, and hence yonder sun is placed upwards from here in the east. [He does so, with, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XI, 42; <I>Ri</I>k S. I, 36, 13] 'Upright for our protection, stand thou like the god Savit<I>ri</I>!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'upright, as a bestower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of strength,'--for standing upright he (the sun) indeed bestows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> strength, food;--'when we utter our call with the shining offerers'--the shining offerers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_450"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, doubtless, are his (the sun's) rays: it is these he means. He lifts it up beyond the reach of his arms, for beyond the reach of his arms is that (sun) from here. He then lowers it; and having lowered it, he holds it above the navel: the meaning of this (will be explained) hereafter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>
