### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:1">5:3:5:1</span></span>1. He
consecrates him at the midday Soma-feast. Now Pra*g*âpati is that
sacrifice which is here performed, and whence these creatures have been

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

produced,--and so they are even now produced after this one: he thus
places him in the very middle of that Pra*g*âpati, and consecrates him
in the middle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:2">5:3:5:2</span></span>2. Before
the Mâhendra (cup) has been drawn,--for that Mâhendra cup is Indra's
special (nishkevalya) cup, and so is that Nishkevalya Stotra (hymn) and
Nishkevalya *S*astra (recitation); and the Sacrificer is Indra: he thus
consecrates him--in his own resting-place. Hence before the Mâhendra
(cup) has been drawn,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:3">5:3:5:3</span></span>3. He
spreads a tiger-skin in front of the Maitrâvaru*n*a's hearth <span
id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161), with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 5), 'Thou art Soma's
beauty.' For because when Soma flowed through Indra he (Indra) thereupon
became a tiger, therefore he is Soma's beauty: this is why he says,
'Thou art Soma's splendour;'--'may my beauty become like unto thine!' He
thus bestows the tiger's beauty on him: therefore he says, 'May my
beauty become like unto thine!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:4">5:3:5:4</span></span>4. He
then offers the Pârtha oblations. Now P*ri*thin Vainya was consecrated
first of men. He desired that he might appropriate to himself all food.
They offered up for him those (oblations), and he appropriated to
himself all the food here on earth. They would even call forest beasts
to him, saying, 'Come hither thou (beast) so and so, the king wants to
cook thee!' Thus he appropriated all food here on earth; and verily he
appropriates to himself all food for whom that knows this those
(oblations) are offered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:5">5:3:5:5</span></span>5. There
are twelve of them,--for there are

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

twelve months in the year: therefore there are twelve of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:6">5:3:5:6</span></span>6. Six he
offers before, and six after, the consecration: he thereby places him in
the very middle of that Pra*g*âpati, and consecrates him in the middle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:7">5:3:5:7</span></span>7. Now of
those which he offers before the consecration, B*ri*haspati is the last
(recipient), and of those which he offers after the consecration, Indra
is the first;--but B*ri*haspati is priestly dignity (brahma), and Indra
is might, vigour: with these two kinds of vigour he thus encloses him on
both sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:8">5:3:5:8</span></span>8. Those
which he offers before the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, 'To
Agni hail!'--Agni is brightness (te*g*as): with brightness he thus
sprinkles (endows) him;--'To Soma hail!'--Soma is princely power
(kshatra): with princely power he thus sprinkles him;--'To Savit*ri*
hail!'--Savit*ri* is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit*ri* he
thus consecrates him;--'To Sarasvatî hail!'--Sarasvatî is Speech: he
thus sprinkles him with Speech;--'To Pûshan hail!'--Pûshan is cattle:
with cattle he thus sprinkles him;--'To B*ri*haspati
hail!'--B*ri*haspati is priestly dignity: with priestly dignity he thus
sprinkles him. These he offers before the consecration: these are called
the Agni-named ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:9">5:3:5:9</span></span>9. Those
which he offers after the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, 'To
Indra hail!'--Indra is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To
the roar hail!'--roar means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles
him;--'To the noise hail! 'noise means vigour: with vigour he thus
sprinkles him;--'To A*ms*a hail!'--A*ms*a is vigour: with vigour he thus
sprinkles him;--'To Bhaga hail!'--Bhaga is vigour: with vigour he thus
sprinkles

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

him;--'To Aryaman hail!'--he thus makes him the friend (aryaman) of
everything here. These he offers after the consecration: these are
called the Âditya-named <span id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_162) ones.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:10">5:3:5:10</span></span>10. In
front of the Maitrâvaru*n*a's hearth are the (four) consecration vessels
in which that consecration water is contained <span
id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_163).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:11">5:3:5:11</span></span>11.
There is a palâ*s*a (butea frondosa) one: with (the water of) that
(vessel) a Brâhman sprinkles;--the Palâ*s*a tree is priestly dignity
(brahman): it is with priestly dignity that he sprinkles (endows) him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:12">5:3:5:12</span></span>12.
There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: therewith one of his own
(kinsmen, or brothers) sprinkles. The udumbara tree means sustenance,
(that is) food, and the 'own' means sustenance, for as far as a man's
own goes, so far he does not hunger: thereby his 'own' is sustenance,
and therefore one of his own (kinsmen) sprinkles with an udumbara
(vessel).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:13">5:3:5:13</span></span>13.
There is one made of the foot (stem) of the nyagrodha (ficus indica):
therewith a friendly (mitrya) Râ*g*anya sprinkles: for by its feet <span
id="fr_164"></span>[3](#fn_164) the

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

nyagrodha tree is supported, and by the friend (mitra) the Râ*g*anya
(nobleman or king) is supported: therefore a friendly Râ*g*anya
sprinkles with (the water of a vessel) made of the foot of a nyagrodha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:14">5:3:5:14</span></span>14.
There is an a*s*vattha (ficus religiosa) one: therewith a Vai*s*ya
sprinkles. Because Indra on that (former) occasion called upon the
Maruts staying on the A*s*vattha tree <span
id="fr_165"></span>[1](#fn_165), therefore a Vai*s*ya sprinkles with an
a*s*vattha (vessel). These are the consecration vessels.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:15">5:3:5:15</span></span>15. He
then prepares two strainers (pavitra), with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 6), 'Purifiers
ye are, Vish*n*u's own;'--the significance is the same (as before <span
id="fr_166"></span>[2](#fn_166)). He weaves gold (threads) into them.
With them he purifies those consecration waters. As to why he weaves
gold (threads) in,--gold is immortal life: that immortal life he lays
into these (waters), and hence he weaves gold (threads) in.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:16">5:3:5:16</span></span>16. He
purifies with, 'By the impulse of Savit*ri* I purify you with a flawless
purifier, with the rays of the sun.' The significance is the same (as
before <span id="fr_167"></span>[3](#fn_167)). 'Not downfallen thou art,
the friend of Speech, born of heat,'--unimpaired by the Rakshas he means
to say when he says, 'not downfallen;'--'the friend of Speech'--as long
as there is water in the vital airs, so long (man) speaks with speech:
therefore he says, 'the friend of Speech.'

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:17">5:3:5:17</span></span>17.
'Born of heat' he says, for from fire springs smoke, from smoke the
cloud, from the cloud rain,--it is from fire that these are produced:
hence he says, 'born of heat.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:18">5:3:5:18</span></span>18.
'Soma's portion thou art;' for when they consecrate him with those
(waters), then there is an oblation: therefore he says 'Soma's portion
thou art;'--'Hail, spiriters of kings!'--it is with 'Hail' that he thus
purifies them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:19">5:3:5:19</span></span>19. He
distributes them over those (consecration) vessels, with (Vâ*g*. S. X,
7), 'Playmates are these glorious waters;'--'not overbearing' he means
to say, when he says 'playmates;' and by 'these glorious waters' he
means to say 'the powerful ones;'--'unimpaired, active, enveloping,' he
thereby means to say 'ye are unimpaired by the Rakshas;'--'In the
habitations Varu*n*a hath made a home;'--the habitations are the people
(clans): 'in the people Varu*n*a has made a support' he thereby
says;--'he, the child of the waters, in the best of mothers;'--for he
who performs the Râ*g*asûya is indeed the child of the waters: therefore
he says, 'the child of the waters, in the best of mothers.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:20">5:3:5:20</span></span>20. He
then makes him (the king) put on garments. There is that one called
târpya <span id="fr_168"></span>[1](#fn_168); therein are

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

wrought <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169) all forms of sacrifice:
that he makes him put on, with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 8), 'Thou art the inner
caul of knighthood (kshatra)!' He thus causes him to be born from out of
what is the inner caul (amnion) of knighthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:21">5:3:5:21</span></span>21. He
then makes him put on one of undyed wool, with, 'Thou art the outer caul
of knighthood!' He thus causes him to be born from what is the outer
caul (chorion) of knighthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:22">5:3:5:22</span></span>22. He
then throws over the mantle, with, 'Thou art the womb of knighthood!' He
thus causes him to be born from what is the womb of knighthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:23">5:3:5:23</span></span>23. He
then draws the head-band together, and conceals it (tucks it under) in
front <span id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_170), with, 'Thou art the navel
of knighthood!' He thus places him in what is the navel of knighthood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:24">5:3:5:24</span></span>24. Now
some wind it quite round about (the navel) saying, 'that (band) is his
navel, and this navel goes all round.' But let him not do this, but let
him merely tuck it under in front, for this navel is in front. And as to
why he makes him put on the garments;--he thereby causes him to be
born <span id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_171),

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

thinking, 'I will anoint him when born:' that is why he makes him put on
the garments.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:25">5:3:5:25</span></span>25. Now
some put off those garments <span id="fr_172"></span>[1](#fn_172), and
make him put on again the garment of initiation. But let him not do
this; for, the limbs <span id="fr_173"></span>[2](#fn_173) being his
natural vestments, they deprive him of his limbs, of his native bodily
form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varu*n*a. Let him put on one
of those same garments: he (the priest) thereby causes him to be
furnished with his limbs, his native bodily form. The garment of
initiation belongs to Varu*n*a: he thus saves him from the Varu*n*ic
garment of initiation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:26">5:3:5:26</span></span>26. And
when he enters the bath <span id="fr_174"></span>[3](#fn_174) they throw
it into (the water). This is a congruous <span
id="fr_175"></span>[4](#fn_175) performance. After putting on one of
those same garments he comes out (of the bath). Let him give away those
(garments) either when the omentum of the barren cow has been
offered <span id="fr_176"></span>[5](#fn_176), or at the completing
oblation <span id="fr_177"></span>[6](#fn_177).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:27">5:3:5:27</span></span>27. He
(the Adhvaryu) then strings the bow, with, 'Thou art Indra's
V*ri*tra-killer;' for the bow

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

is indeed a V*ri*tra-killer, and the Sacrificer is Indra,--he is Indra
in a twofold way, both as a Kshatriya, and as Sacrificer: therefore he
says, 'Thou art Indra's V*ri*tra-killer.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:28">5:3:5:28</span></span>28. He
then strokes the two arms <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_178), with,
'Mitra's thou art,--Varu*n*a's thou art;' for the bow is within the two
arms, and by his two arms the Râ*g*anya pertains to Mitra and Varu*n*a:
therefore he says, 'Mitra's thou art, Varu*n*a's thou art.' He hands it
to him, with, 'May he slay V*ri*tra by thee!' whereby he means to say,
'May he slay by thee his spiteful enemy!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:29">5:3:5:29</span></span>29. He
then hands him three arrows. That first-one by which he pierces on
shooting <span id="fr_179"></span>[2](#fn_179), that is one, that one is
this earth, that one is called 'd*ri*bâ.' And the one by which (the
enemy) being pierced lies either living or dead, that is the second,
that is this air, that is called 'ru*g*â.' And the one with which he
misses (his aim) <span id="fr_180"></span>[3](#fn_180), that is the
third, that is yonder sky, that is called 'kshumâ.' For these are the
three (kinds of) arrows: therefore he hands him three arrows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:30">5:3:5:30</span></span>30.
These he hands to him with, 'Protect ye him in front <span
id="fr_181"></span>[4](#fn_181)!--Protect ye him from behind!--Protect
ye him from the side!--Protect ye

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

him from (all) quarters!' Thus he makes all the quarters safe from
arrows for him. And as to why he hands the bow to him;--this, the bow,
truly is the nobleman's strength: it is because he thinks, 'I will
consecrate him when endowed with strength!' that he hands the weapon to
him <span id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:31">5:3:5:31</span></span>31.
Thereupon he makes him pronounce the âvid formulas <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183) (Vâ*g*. S. X, 9), 'In sight, ye mortals!
This is mysterious for mysterious is Pra*g*âpati: he thus announces him
to Pra*g*âpati, and this one approves of his consecration; and approved
by him he is consecrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:32">5:3:5:32</span></span>32.
'Present is Agni, the house-lord;'---Agni is the priesthood (brahman);
he thus announces him to the priesthood; and it approves of his
consecration, and approved by it he is consecrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:33">5:3:5:33</span></span>33
'Present is Indra, the far-famed;'--Indra is the nobility: he thus
announces him to the nobility; and, it approves of his consecration, and
approved by it he is consecrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:34">5:3:5:34</span></span>34.
'Present are Mitra and Varu*n*a, the upholders of the law;'--Mitra and
Varu*n*a are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus announces him
to the out-breathing and in-breathing, and they approve of his
consecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:35">5:3:5:35</span></span>35.
'Present is Pûshan, the all-possessing;'

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pûshan is (the
lord of) cattle: he thus announces him to the cattle, and they approve
of his consecration; and approved by them he is consecrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:36">5:3:5:36</span></span>36.
'Present are Heaven and Earth, the all-propitious;'--he thus announces
him to those two, the heaven and the earth, and they approve of his
consecration; and approved by them he is consecrated.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:5:37">5:3:5:37</span></span>37.
'Present is Aditi, of wide shelter;'--Aditi is this earth: he thus
announces him to this earth, and she approves of his consecration, and
approved by her he is consecrated. Thus to whatever deities he announces
him, they approve of his consecration, and approved by them he is
consecrated.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_161"></span>[81:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_161) Viz. before the
'waters' deposited there, according to [V, 3, 4,
28](sbe4116.htm#5:3:4:28).

<span id="fn_162"></span>[83:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_162) Viz. because three
of the recipients of these libations--A*ms*a, Bhaga and Aryaman--belong
to the deities called Âdityas, or sons of Aditi.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[83:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_163) The water in the
Udumbara vessel is now distributed into these four (smaller) vessels.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[83:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_164) That is, by its
pendant branches. It is well known that the ficus indica, or
banyan-tree, as it is ordinarily called, has the habit of bending its
branches down to the ground, which then strike root and develop new
secondary trunks, so that a single tree may in course of time form a
large grove. Hence the name here used for the tree (nyag-rodha, the
downward-growing one). 'A family tends to multiply families around it,
till it becomes the centre of a tribe, just as the banyan tends to
surround itself with a forest of its own offspring.' Maclennan,
Primitive Marriage, p. 269.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[84:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_165) See above, [p.
34](sbe4108.htm#page_34), note [1](sbe4108.htm#fn_80). The Maruts are
constantly identified with the Vi*s*, or people (peasants, &c.)
generally, whilst Indra is taken as the divine representative of the
ruling class (the king and nobleman).

<span id="fn_166"></span>[84:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_166) See I, 1, 3, 1 (part
i, p. 19).

<span id="fn_167"></span>[84:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_167) See I, 1, 3, 6 (part
i, p. 21).

<span id="fn_168"></span>[85:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_168) This is variously
explained, by Kâtyâyana and Sâya*n*a, as a linen one, or simply one
soaked in ghee, or a tripâ*n*a one--i.e. one made of tripar*n*a plants,
or a thrice saturated one (with ghee)--or one woven out of materials
derived from the t*ri*pâ plant. It is quite evident that they did not
exactly know what to make of it. Indeed, it would almost seem as if the
author of the Brâhma*n*a himself was already doubtful as to the meaning
of the term. Goldstücker (s.v. abhishe*k*anîya) perhaps rightly takes it
to mean a silk under-garment.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[86:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_169) According to the
commentators, figures of sacrificial spoons, cups, &c., are sewn in by
means of a needle.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[86:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_170) The commentators do
not seem to be quite in accord in regard to this particular item of the
ceremonial. The most natural explanation, however, seems to be this: the
head-band (turban, ush*n*îsha) is wound (? once) round the head and tied
behind; the ends being then drawn over the shoulders so as to hang down
from the neck in the manner of a brahmanical cord (or like the ribbon of
an order); and being finally tucked in under the mantle somewhere near
the navel.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[86:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_171) Viz. inasmuch as the
garments are intended to symbolically represent the vestures of the
embryo and stages of birth.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[87:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_172) This change of
garments takes place optionally when the Mâhendra libation is about to
be offered. Katy. XV, 5, 16; 7, 23-26.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[87:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_173) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, the skin, &c.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[87:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_174) That is, at the end
of the Râ*g*asûya. In case of the change of garments before the Mâhendra
libation, the king keeps on the initiation garment in entering and
coming out of the bath. This paragraph is of course put in here by
anticipation, merely in order to state all that relates to the garments.

<span id="fn_175"></span>[87:4](sbe4117.htm#fr_175) Viz. inasmuch as it
is in accordance with what is done at an ordinary Soma-sacrifice, at the
end of which the Sacrificer and his wife enter the bath and come forth
with fresh garments. See part ii, p. 385. In the present case the king
is to enter the bath clothed in one of those three garments, and in
coming out he is to put on another of them.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[87:5](sbe4117.htm#fr_176) See part ii, pp.
391-2.

<span id="fn_177"></span>[87:6](sbe4117.htm#fr_177) For the
Udavasânîyâ-ish*t*i, see ib. p. 389.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[88:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_178) Viz. the arms of the
king, as it would seem, according to Sâya*n*a; but the arms (or ends) of
the bow, according to Karka and Mahîdhara.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[88:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_179) Literally, on fixing
(the arrow on the string); or perhaps, on hitting (the enemy).

<span id="fn_180"></span>[88:3](sbe4117.htm#fr_180) Sâya*n*a takes
apa-râdhnoti in the sense of 'he hurts (or hits)' the enemy. In the
Kâ*n*va text (Grantha MS.) the three arrows are called ru*g*â, d*ri*vâ,
and kshupâ resp.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[88:4](sbe4117.htm#fr_181) Or perhaps,--whilst
(he is) moving forward,--whilst moving backward,--whilst moving
sideways.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[89:1](sbe4117.htm#fr_182) For a sham fight
with arrows forming part of the ceremony in the Black Ya*g*us ritual,
see [p. 100](sbe4120.htm#page_100). note [1](sbe4120.htm#fn_199).

<span id="fn_183"></span>[89:2](sbe4117.htm#fr_183) That is, as would
seem, the formulas of information (or perhaps of announcement,
introduction); the first of these formulas beginning with âvis (in
sight), the others with the participle âvitta, i.e. 'obtained, present;'
Sâya*n*a and Mahîdhara, however, taking it in the sense of
'informed,'--a meaning which, indeed, the word may perhaps have been
intended to convey in these formulas.

[Next: V, 4, 1. Fourth Adhyâya. First Brâhma*n*a](sbe4118)
