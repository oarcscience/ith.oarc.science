### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:1">6:1:3:1</span></span>1.
Verily, Pra*g*âpati alone was here in the beginning. He desired, 'May I
exist, may I reproduce myself!' He toiled, he practised austerity (or,
became heated). From him, worn out and heated, the waters were created:
from that heated Person the waters are born.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:2">6:1:3:2</span></span>2. The
waters said, 'What is to become of us?'--'Ye shall be heated,' he said.
They were heated; they created foam: hence foam is produced in heated
water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:3">6:1:3:3</span></span>3. The
foam (m.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be heated!' he
said. It was heated, and produced clay; for indeed the foam is heated,
when it floats on the water, covering it; and when one beats upon it, it
indeed becomes clay.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:4">6:1:3:4</span></span>4. The
clay (f.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be heated!' he
said. It was heated,

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

and produced sand; for this clay becomes indeed heated when they plough
it; and if only they plough very fine then it becomes, as it were,
sandy. So much, then, as to that 'What is to become of me? what is to
become of me <span id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_320)?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:5">6:1:3:5</span></span>5. From
the sated he created the pebble: whence sand finally indeed becomes a
pebble;--from the pebble the stone: whence the pebble finally indeed
becomes a stone;--from the stone metal ore: whence from stone they smelt
ore;--from ore gold: whence ore much smelted comes, as it were, to have
the appearance of gold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:6">6:1:3:6</span></span>6. Now
that which was created was flowing; and inasmuch as it was flowing
(aksharat), a syllable (akshara) resulted therefrom; and inasmuch as it
flowed eight times, that octosyllabic Gâyatrî was produced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:7">6:1:3:7</span></span>7. 'This
has indeed become (bhû) a foundation (resting-place),' so he thought:
whence it became the earth (bhûmi). He spread it out (prath): it became
the broad (earth, p*ri*thivî). On this earth, as on a foundation, the
beings, and the lord of beings, consecrated themselves for a year: the
lord of beings was the master of the house <span
id="fr_321"></span>[2](#fn_321), and Ushas (the Dawn) was the mistress.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:8">6:1:3:8</span></span>8. Now,
those beings are the seasons; and that lord of beings is the year; and
that Ushas, the mistress, is the Dawn. And these same creatures, as well
as the lord of beings, the year, laid seed

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

into Ushas <span id="fr_322"></span>[1](#fn_322). There a boy (kumâra)
was born in a year: he cried.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:9">6:1:3:9</span></span>9.
Pra*g*âpati said to him, 'My boy, why criest thou, when thou art born
out of labour and trouble?' He said, 'Nay, but I am not freed from
(guarded against) evil; I have no name given me: give me a name!' Hence
one should give a name to the boy that is born, for thereby one frees
him from evil;--even a second, even a third (name), for thereby one
frees him from evil time after time.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:10">6:1:3:10</span></span>10. He
said to him, 'Thou art Rudra <span id="fr_323"></span>[2](#fn_323).' And
because he gave him that name, Agni became suchlike (or, that form), for
Rudra is Agni: because he cried (rud) therefore he is Rudra. He said,
'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:11">6:1:3:11</span></span>11. He
said to him, 'Thou art Sarva.' And because he gave the him that name,
the waters became suchlike, for Sarva is the waters, inasmuch as from
the water everything (sarva) here is produced. He said, 'Surely, I am
mightier than that: give me yet a name!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:12">6:1:3:12</span></span>12. He
said to him, 'Thou art Pa*s*upati.' And because he gave him that name,
the plants became suchlike, for Pa*s*upati is the plants: hence when
cattle (pa*s*u) get plants, then they play the master <span
id="fr_324"></span>[3](#fn_324) (patîy). He said, 'Surely, I am mightier
than that: give me yet a name!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:13">6:1:3:13</span></span>13. He
said to him, 'Thou art Ugra.' And

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

because he gave him that name, Vâyu (the wind) became suchlike, for Ugra
is Vâyu: hence when it blows strongly, they say 'Ugra is blowing.' He
said, 'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:14">6:1:3:14</span></span>14. He
said to him, 'Thou art A*s*ani.' And because he gave him that name, the
lightning became suchlike, for A*s*ani is the lightning: hence they say
of him whom the lightning strikes, 'A*s*ani has smitten him.' He said,
'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:15">6:1:3:15</span></span>15. He
said to him, 'Thou art Bhava.' And because he gave him that name,
Par*g*anya (the rain-god) became suchlike; for Bhava is Par*g*anya,
since everything here comes (bhavati) from the rain-cloud. He said,
'Surely, I am mightier than that: give me yet a name!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:16">6:1:3:16</span></span>16. He
said to him, 'Thou art Mahân Deva*h* (the Great God).' And because he
gave him that name, the moon became suchlike, for the moon is
Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the Great God. He said, 'Surely, I am
mightier than that: give me yet a name!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:17">6:1:3:17</span></span>17. He
said to him, 'Thou art Î*s*âna (the Ruler).' And because he gave him
that name, the Sun became suchlike, for Î*s*âna is the Sun, since the
Sun rules over this All. He said, 'So great indeed I am: give me no
other name after that!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:18">6:1:3:18</span></span>18.
These then are the eight forms of Agni. Kumâra (the boy) is the ninth:
that is Agni's threefold state <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_325).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:19">6:1:3:19</span></span>19. And
because there are eight forms of Agni--

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the Gâyatrî consisting of eight syllables--therefore they say, 'Agni is
Gâyatra.' That boy entered into the forms one after another; for one
never sees him as a mere boy (kumâra), but one sees those forms of
his <span id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_326), for he assumed those forms
one after another.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:1:3:20">6:1:3:20</span></span>20. One
ought to build him (Agni, the fire-altar) up in (the space of) a year,
and recite for a year. 'For two (years),' however, say some; 'for in one
year they laid the seed, and in one year that boy was born, therefore
let him build for two (years), and recite for two (years).' Let him,
however, build for a year only, and recite for a year; for the same seed
which is laid is brought forth; it then lies changing and growing: hence
let him build for a year only, and recite for a year. To him (Agni) when
built up (*k*ita) he gives a name: whereby he keeps away evil from him.
He calls him by a bright (*k*itra) name <span
id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_327), saying, 'Thou art bright;' for Agni is
all bright things.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_320"></span>[158:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_320) He means to say
that he will leave this to be supplied in the enumeration of the
subsequent creations.

<span id="fn_321"></span>[158:2](sbe4130.htm#fr_321) At sacrificial
sessions the Sacrificer is called G*ri*hapati. On this, see IV, 6, 8,
3-5.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[159:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_322) On the legend
regarding Pra*g*âpati and his daughter Ushas, see I, 7, 4, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[159:2](sbe4130.htm#fr_323) On this and several
of the other names, see part i, p. 201.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[159:3](sbe4130.htm#fr_324) As, when a horse
gets much corn, it becomes spirited, 'masterful.' The St. Petersburg
dictionary suggests the meaning, 'they become strong.' It might also
mean, 'they lord it (over the plants).'

<span id="fn_325"></span>[160:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_325) That is, his state
of being triv*ri*t, or three times three.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[161:1](sbe4130.htm#fr_326) Tata*s* *k*a
tatprabh*ri*ti tam Agnim kumârarûpa*m* na kva*k*ana pa*s*yanti ki*m*tv
etâny eta*g*gvalanâdîni rûpâ*n*y apurushavidhâni pa*s*yanti, Sây.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[161:2](sbe4130.htm#fr_327) Or, he calls him by
the name of *K*itra (bright), that being the name by which he is
actually to address the fire on the altar at the end of the performance.
Kâty. XVIII, 6, 23.
