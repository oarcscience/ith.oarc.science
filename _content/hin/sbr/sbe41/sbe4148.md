### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:1">6:6:4:1</span></span>1. Having
then stridden the Vish*n*u strides, and reverentially stood by (the
fire) with the Vâtsapra <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_496) (hymn),
after the sun has set, he in the first place throws out the ashes (from
the fire-pan). For at that (former) time he regales him (Agni) with that
food, those kindling-sticks; and the foul part of that eaten food sinks
to the bottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech
into him <span id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_497), thus freed from
foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a kindling-stick,--and
thereby regales him with food for the night,--with, 'Night for night
bearing unremittingly <span id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_498)'--the
meaning of this has been told: he prays for that same security and
wellbeing for the night; and whatsoever he puts on 'thereafter by night,
that he puts on as a libation offered to him <span
id="fr_501"></span>[4](#fn_499).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:2">6:6:4:2</span></span>2. And in
the morning, when the sun has risen, he in the first place throws out
the ashes. For at that (former) time he regales him with that food, that
kindling-stick; and the foul part of that eaten food which he puts on
during the night sinks to the

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

bottom as ashes. He now clears him thereof, and infuses speech into him
thus freed from foulness. Having infused speech, he puts on a
kindling-stick,--and thereby regales him with food for the day--with,
'Day by day bearing unremittingly;'--the meaning of this has been told:
he prays for that same security and well-being for the day; and
whatsoever he puts on thereafter by day, that he puts on as a libation
offered to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:3">6:6:4:3</span></span>3.
Verily, day and night passing on come up to a year, and the year is
everything here: he prays for that security and well-being for a
succession of days.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:4">6:6:4:4</span></span>4. And
when they give him (the Sacrificer) the fast-milk, he puts on a
kindling-stick, after dipping it into the fast-milk. Some, however, say,
'Let him not dip it into the fast-milk: he would be offering a libation,
and it would be improper were one who is initiated to offer a libation.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:5">6:6:4:5</span></span>5. Let
him nevertheless dip it in, for that (Âhavanîya fire) is his (the
Sacrificer's) divine body, and this (real body of his) is his human one.
Now were he not to dip it in, he would not be satisfying that divine
body of his; but when he clips it in, he does so satisfy that divine
body. And in that it is a kindling-stick, it is not a libation; and in
that it is dipped into the fast-milk, it is food, for the fast-milk is
food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:6">6:6:4:6</span></span>6. And
having put on the kindling-stick, he drinks the fast-milk; for that
(fire) is his divine body, and this (body of his) is the human one; and
the gods (come) first, and then men: hence he drinks the fast-milk after
putting the kindling-stick on (the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:7">6:6:4:7</span></span>7. \[He
puts it on, with Vâ*g*. S. XI, 83\] 'O

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lord of food; give
us of thy food!'--that is, 'O Lord of viands, give us of thy
viands!'--'of the pain-allaying, strengthening'--that is, 'of the
hunger-allaying, strengthening (food),'--'Onward, onward lead thou the
giver!'--the giver, doubtless, is the Sacrificer: thus, 'Onward lead
thou the Sacrificer!'--'Give us sustenance for the two-footed and the
four-footed!'--he thereby asks a blessing. Now as to the expiation in
case of (the fire-pan being) broken which, he said, would be explained
'in a subsequent chapter <span id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_500).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:8">6:6:4:8</span></span>8. If the
fire-pan were to break, let him pour that (fire in the pan) into any
such unbroken, new pot with a wide mouth as there may be; for the pan
which is broken indeed suffers injury, but uninjured is this deity
(Agni): 'Uninjured I will bear him in the uninjured!' so he thinks. Into
that (pot) he first throws a potsherd of the (broken) pan, and thus he
(Agni) is not deprived of that womb of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:9">6:6:4:9</span></span>9. He
then takes the (remaining <span id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_501)) clay,
and having pounded both the (broken) pan and that remainder, and mixed
it, he makes a (new) pan in the very same way, without using any
formula, quite silently. Having baked it, he pours (the fire) over. The
expiation in this case is one of performance only. Having again thrown
that potsherd into the (new) pan, and pounded both the (temporary) pan
and the remaining clay, and mixed it, he lays it aside for expiation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:10">6:6:4:10</span></span>10. And
if the fire in the pan (Ukhya Agni) were to go out, it is doubtless to
the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken.
Having then taken it out of the Gârhapatya eastwards (to the place of
the Âhavanîya), and put fuel on it, let him

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

put the fire-pan on it in the same way (as before), without using any
formula, quite silently. When the fire rises up to it,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:11">6:6:4:11</span></span>11. He
performs two expiations. For it is for (the obtainment of) all his
wishes that he makes up that (fire); and whatever part of his wishes is
here cut off when the fire goes out, that he thereby joins together and
heals. He performs both expiations, that of the (Soma) sacrifice and
that of the fire-altar,--first that of the sacrifice, then that of the
fire-altar: the significance of this has been explained <span
id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_502).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:12">6:6:4:12</span></span>12.
Having cut out with a kindling-stick some of the butter, he offers
sitting a libation, with (Vâg;. S. XII, 4,), 'To Vi*s*vakarman, hail!'
Then stepping near he puts the kindling-stick on the fire, with (Vâ*g*.
S. XII, 44), 'Again the Âdityas, the Rudras, the Vasus may kindle thee,
again the Brahmans with sacrifices, O bringer of good things!'--that is,
'May those deities again kindle thee!'--'With ghee make thou grow thy
body, let the wishes of the Sacrificer be true!'--that is, 'With ghee
indeed make thou grow thy body, and for whatever wishes the Sacrificer
makes up a fire, may they all come true!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:13">6:6:4:13</span></span>13. And
if the Gârhapatya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the
churning-sticks that it goes, for from the churning-sticks it has been
taken. Having churned it out with the churning-sticks, and put fuel on
it, he performs two expiations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:14">6:6:4:14</span></span>14. And
if the Âhavanîya fire were to go out whilst the pressing (of Soma)
proceeds, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya that it goes, for from the
Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having taken it straightway

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

eastward from the Gârhapatya, and put fuel on it, he performs two
expiations: whatever (kind of Soma) sacrifice may be (performed) at the
time, the expiation of that sacrifice he should perform; and of like
kind is the expiation of the fire-altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:6:4:15">6:6:4:15</span></span>15. And
if the Âgnîdhrîya fire were to go out, it is doubtless to the Gârhapatya
that it goes, for from the Gârhapatya it has been taken. Having taken it
from the Gârhapatya eastward along the north of the Sadas, and put fuel
on it, he performs two expiations. And if the Gârhapatya were to go out,
the meaning (procedure) of that has been explained.
