'We know, O Agni, thy threefold three,'--Agni, V&acirc;yu (wind), &Acirc;ditya (sun), these are his three in three forms;--'We know thy manifold scattered sites,'--inasmuch as he (Agni) is here distributed <A HREF="errata.htm#13">many ways</A>;--'we know thy highest name which is in secret,'--'the youngest,' that indeed is his highest name in secret;--'we know that source whence thou art come;'--the source, doubtless, is the (heavenly) waters, for from the waters he first came.</p>

These (three verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) have one and the same explanation regarding him (Agni): they are Trish<I>t</I>ubh verses relating to Agni. Inasmuch as they relate to Agni, they are Agni; and inasmuch as they are Trish<I>t</I>ubhs, and eleven (syllables), they are Indra;--but Agni consists of Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him. And Indra and Agni are all the gods, and Agni includes (or belongs to) all the deities: as great as Agni is, as</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_286"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 286</FONT></A></p>  
<p>great as is his measure, with so much he thus stands worshipping by him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:7">6:7:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. And, again, why the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides and the V&acirc;tsapra rite are (performed);--by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created this world, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the fire (Agni); by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the air, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the wind (V&acirc;yu); by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the sky, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the sun (&Acirc;ditya); by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the regions, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the moon; by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created that which has been, and by the V&acirc;tsapra that which shall be; by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created possession (wealth), and by the V&acirc;tsapra hope; by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the day, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the night; by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the former (bright) fortnights, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the latter (dark) fortnights; by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the half-months, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the months; by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the seasons, and by the V&acirc;tsapra the year: thus the reason why the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides and V&acirc;tsapra are (performed) is that he thereby even now creates everything.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:8">6:7:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. And, again, why the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides and the V&acirc;tsapra rite are (performed). By the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati drove up to heaven. He saw that unyoking-place, the V&acirc;tsapra, and unyoked thereat to prevent chafing; for when the yoked (beast) is not unloosed, it is chafed. In like manner the Sacrificer drives up to heaven by the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides; and unyokes by means of the V&acirc;tsapra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:9">6:7:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. Having stridden the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides, he then</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_287"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 287</FONT></A></p>  
<p>forthwith stands by the fire worshipping it with the V&acirc;tsapra, just as one who has journeyed would forthwith unyoke. Men (proceed) after the manner of the gods: hence even now, when a troop of men have journeyed they forthwith unyoke.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:10">6:7:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. Now, the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides indeed are the day and the night, and the V&acirc;tsapra is the day and the night: he thus journeys for a day and a night, and takes rest for a day and a night: and hence even now when a troop of men have journeyed for a day and a night they take rest for a day and a night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:11">6:7:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. Only for one half of the year he strides the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides, and for one half he worships the fire with the V&acirc;tsapra; for the world of heaven is in the midst of the year: thus were he to stride for less than half (a year), he would not reach that world of heaven; and were he to do so for more than half (a year), he would pass beyond that world of heaven and lose it; but when he strides for one half, and worships the fire for one half, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:12">6:7:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. He proceeds with these two alternately&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, even as one would accomplish a long way by (repeatedly) unyoking. Both before and after (the D&icirc;ksh&acirc;), he combines both, the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides and the V&acirc;tsapra; for the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides are the day, and the V&acirc;tsapra the night; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, both when he was about to generate and when he had generated this universe, enclosed it on both sides by day and night: in like</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_288"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 288</FONT></A></p>  
<p>manner the Sacrificer now, both when he is about to generate and when he has generated this universe, encloses it on both sides by day and night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:13">6:7:4:13</A></FONT></span>13. As to this they say, 'If the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides are the day, and the V&acirc;tsapra the night, and both of them are (performed) during the day, not during the night, how then are they both performed for (or by) him also during the night?' Well, on that (first) occasion, when he is being initiated, he, at the outset, combines both (performances) in the afternoon; for the afternoon is the same thing as the night. Then throwing them thus together, he at the end combines them both in the forenoon; for the forenoon is the same thing as the day; and in this way they are both performed during the day, and both during the night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:14">6:7:4:14</A></FONT></span>14. Now early on the day on which he may intend to combine them, when the sun has risen, he first throws out the ashes (from the pan); having thrown out the ashes, he releases his speech; having released his speech, he puts on a kindling-stick; having put on a kindling-stick, he takes the ashes down to (and throws them into) the water. In the same way as he takes them down he returns after taking some of the ashes; and having thrown it into the pan he stands reverentially by the fire. He then performs two expiations.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:4:15">6:7:4:15</A></FONT></span>15. And if the day should be one for the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides, let him, after striding the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides, worship the fire with the V&acirc;tsapra; and if it be one for the V&acirc;tsapra, let him, after worshipping with the V&acirc;tsapra, and striding the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides, finally perform the V&acirc;tsapra. Let him not conclude by performing the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides, for that would be as if</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_289"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 289</FONT></A></p>  
<p>after going for a drive he were not to unyoke; but when he concludes by performing the V&acirc;tsapra--the V&acirc;tsapra being a halting-place--(it is) as if he made a halt and unloosed (the team): let him therefore conclude by performing the V&acirc;tsapra.</p>

X, 45), ascribed to the poet Vatsapr&icirc; Bh&acirc;landana. The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, however, comments only on the first three verses, and perhaps these alone were used for the purpose at the time when the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a was composed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_537"></A><A HREF="sbe4152.htm#fr_539">283:2</A> This is a somewhat doubtful meaning of 'd&acirc;ksh&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a-hasta.' The synonyms (if correct), hira<I>n</I>yap&acirc;<I>n</I>i and hira<I>n</I>yahasta, always refer to Savit<I>ri</I>, the sun.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_540"></A><A HREF="sbe4152.htm#fr_542">284:1</A> The construction of the text here favoured by the author is very doubtful. It has probably to be construed,--'the third time (he, Agni, was born) in the waters, he, the manly-minded (or, friendly to men). Kindling him, the imperishable (Agni), the heedful (? or pious) one praises him,'--or perhaps, 'While kindling him, the considerate one praises him unceasingly.' A point which favours the author's construction is that, in verse 3, 'n<I>ri</I>ma<I>n</I>aas' certainly refers not to Agni, but to him who generated him.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_541"></A><A HREF="sbe4152.htm#fr_543">285:1</A> The remaining verses (XII, 21-29) are as follows:--</p>  
<p>1. Agni roared like the thundering sky, &amp;c. (see VI, 7, 3, 2).</p>  
<p>2. The upraiser of glories, the upholder of riches, the inspirer of thoughts, the guardian of Soma; the excellent son of power, shines forth as king in the waters, kindled before the dawns.</p>  
<p>3. A beacon unto all that is, the child of the world filled the two spheres even when born; even the hard rock he broke going thither when the five peoples worshipped Agni.</p>  
<p>4. An eager cleanser, a wise messenger, the immortal Agni has been set up among the mortals; flickering (?) he sends forth the red smoke, striving with his bright flame to reach the sky.</p>  
<p>5. Looking like a golden disk, &amp;c. (see <a href="sbe4150.htm#6:7:2">VI, 7, 2</A>).</p>  
<p>6. Whoso maketh for thee this day a ghee-baked cake, O divine Agni of auspicious flame, lead him onwards to bliss, unto god-allotted glory, O youngest!</p>  
<p>7. Make him share in the songs of triumph, make him share in every hymn that is sung! Dear be he unto S&ucirc;rya, dear unto Agni; let him prevail with the living one and with them that are to be born!</p>  
<p>8. They that worship thee day by day, O Agni, win all desirable boons; ardently wishing for wealth, they have opened with thee the stable filled with cows!</p>  
<p>9. Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara has been celebrated by the <I>Ri</I>shis, the guardian of Soma, most gracious unto men: let us invoke heaven and earth who are free from hatred! grant us wealth, ye gods, with abundance of men!</P>
