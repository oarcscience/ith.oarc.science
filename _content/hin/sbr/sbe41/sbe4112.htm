He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Vish<I>n</I>u, a pap for Indra and Vish<I>n</I>u, and either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish<I>n</I>u. He performs that Trisha<I>m</I>yukta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> offering.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:4">5:2:5:4</A></FONT></span>4. And as to why there is either a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish<I>n</I>u;--whatever men Agni, the giver, gives him, among them he thereby finally establishes him (the king); and whatever work he wishes to do with his men, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby approaches the men, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, and possessed of men!' A dwarfish bull is the sacrificial fee for this (offering), for the dwarf belongs to Vish<I>n</I>u&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:5">5:2:5:5</A></FONT></span>5. He then performs another Trisha<I>m</I>yukta offering. He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and P&ucirc;shan, a pap for Indra and P&ucirc;shan, and a pap for P&ucirc;shan: this Trisha<I>m</I>yukta he offers. Thereby the gods obtained cattle; and in like manner does this (king) thereby obtain cattle.</p>

And as to why there is a pap for Indra and P&ucirc;shan;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and the cattle are P&ucirc;shan's: whatever cattle Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he now puts himself in contact, those he makes his own.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_56"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 56</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to do: thus he comes by cattle, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, possessed of cattle!' A dark-grey&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> bull is the fee for this (offering), for such a dark-grey one is of P&ucirc;shan's nature: there are two forms of the dark-grey, the white hair and the black; and 'two and two' means a productive pair, and P&ucirc;shan represents productiveness, for P&ucirc;shan is cattle, and cattle means productiveness: thus a productive pair is obtained,--hence a dark-grey bull is the sacrificial fee.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:9">5:2:5:9</A></FONT></span>9. He then performs another Trisha<I>m</I>yukta offering. He prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma, a pap for Indra and Soma, and a pap for Soma: this Trisha<I>m</I>yukta (triply connected) he offers:--Thereby the gods attained glory; and in like manner does this (king) thereby attain glory.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:10">5:2:5:10</A></FONT></span>10. Now as to why there is that cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma;--Agni is the giver, and Soma is glory: thus Agni, the giver, gives him glory.</p>

And as to why there is a pap for Indra and Soma;--Indra is the Sacrificer, and Soma is glory: whatever glory Agni, the giver, gives him, therewith he now puts himself in contact, that he makes his own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:12">5:2:5:12</A></FONT></span>12. And why there is a pap for Soma;--whatever glory, Agni, the giver, gives him, therein he now finally establishes him; and whatever work he, the glorious, wishes to do, that he is able to do. Thus he thereby attains glory,--thinking, 'May I be consecrated, endowed with glory!' for the inglorious one has no concern with success. A brown bull is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_57"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 57</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the fee for this (offering); for such a brown one is of Soma's nature.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:13">5:2:5:13</A></FONT></span>13. And on the following day he prepares a cake-on twelve potsherds for (Agni) Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara, and a barley pap for Varu<I>n</I>a. These two offerings he performs either on days following one another, or so as to use the same barhis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:14">5:2:5:14</A></FONT></span>14. And as to why there is that (cake) for Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara;--Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara ('belonging to all men') truly is the year, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati indeed thereby created abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!' And in like manner does that (king) thereby create abundance and creatures, thinking, 'May I be consecrated, having created abundance and creatures!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:15">5:2:5:15</A></FONT></span>15. And why it is one on twelve potsherds;--twelve months there are in the year, and Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara is the year: this is why it is one on twelve potsherds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:16">5:2:5:16</A></FONT></span>16. And as to why there is a barley pap for Varu<I>n</I>a; he thereby frees the creatures from every snare of Varu<I>n</I>a, from all that comes from Varu<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;</p>

<p>and those creatures of his are produced sound and faultless: 'May I be consecrated for sound and faultless creatures (or subjects)!' he thinks.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:2:5:17">5:2:5:17</A></FONT></span>17. A bull is the fee for the Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara (oblation); for Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara is the year, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year; and the bull is the Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (lord of creatures or generation) among cows: therefore a bull is the fee for the Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara. A black cloth for the V&acirc;ru<I>n</I>a (oblation), for what is black belongs to Varu<I>n</I>a. If he cannot obtain a black one, any kind of cloth will do: it is by its knots that the cloth belongs to Vanilla, for the knot is sacred to Varu<I>n</I>a.</p>
