By means (or, in the form) of Agni he entered into union with the Earth: thence an egg arose. He touched it: 'May it grow! May it grow and multiply!' he said.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:2">6:1:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. And the embryo which was inside was created as V&acirc;yu (the wind).

By means of V&acirc;yu he entered into union with the Air: thence an egg arose. He touched it, saying, 'Bear thou glory!' From it yonder sun was created, for he indeed is glorious. And the tear which (a<I>s</I>ru) formed itself became that variegated pebble (a<I>s</I>man); for 'a<I>s</I>ru' indeed is what</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_149"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 149</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they mystically call 'a<I>s</I>man,' for the gods love the mystic. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became those sunbeams. And that which was the shell became the sky.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:4">6:1:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. He desired, 'May it multiply, may it reproduce itself!' By means of the Sun he entered into union with the Sky: thence an egg arose. He touched it, saying, 'Bear thou seed!' From it the moon was created, for he (the moon) is seed. And the tear which formed itself became those stars. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became those intermediate quarters; and that which was the shell became those (chief) quarters (points of the compass).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:5">6:1:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Having created these worlds, he desired, 'May I create such creatures as shall be mine in these worlds!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:6">6:1:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. By his Mind (manas) he entered into union with Speech (v&acirc;<I>k</I>): he became pregnant with eight drops.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:9">6:1:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. By his Mind he entered into union with Speech: he became pregnant. He created the All-gods: he placed them in the quarters.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:10">6:1:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. And so they say, 'After Agni having been created, the Vasus were created: he placed them on this (earth);--after V&acirc;yu, the Rudras: (he placed) them in the air;--after the sun, the &Acirc;dityas: (he placed) them in the sky;--after the moon, the All-gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_300"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: he placed them in the quarters.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:11">6:1:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. And so they say, 'Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, having created these worlds, was firmly established on the earth. For him these plants were ripened&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_301"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> into food: that he ate. He became pregnant. From the upper vital airs he created the gods, and from the lower vital airs the mortal creatures.' In whatever way he created thereafter, so he created; but indeed it was Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati who created everything here, whatsoever exists.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:12">6:1:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. Having created creatures he, having run the whole race, became relaxed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_302"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; and therefore even now he who runs the whole race becomes indeed</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A></p>  
<p>relaxed. From him being thus relaxed, the vital air went out from within. When it had gone out of him the gods left him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:13">6:1:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. He said to Agni, 'Restore me!'--'What will then accrue to me?' said he.--'They shall call me after thee; for whichever of the sons succeeds (in life), after him they call the father, grandfather, son, and grandson: they shall call me after thee,--restore me, then!'--'So be it!' so (saying) Agni restored him: therefore, while being Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, they call him Agni; and verily, whosoever knows this, after him they call his father, grandfather, son, and grandson.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:14">6:1:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. He said, 'Whereon shall we set thee up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_303"></A><A HREF="#fn_303"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?'--'On the hita (set, or suitable, good)!' he said: the vital air is indeed something good, for the vital air is good for all beings. And inasmuch as he set him up on the hita, therefore one says, 'I shall set up, I am setting up, I have set up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_304"></A><A HREF="#fn_304"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:15">6:1:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. As to this they say, 'What is hita, and what is upahita?' The vital air, forsooth, is the 'hita,' and speech is the 'upahita,' for it is on the vital air that this speech is based (upa-hit&acirc;). The vital air, again, is the 'hita,' and the limbs are the 'upahita,' for on the vital air these limbs are indeed based.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:16">6:1:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. This, then, was his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) '<I>k</I>itya' (Agni to be set up on an altar-pile); for he had to be built up (<I>k</I>i) by him, and therefore was his '<I>k</I>itya.' And</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></p>  
<p>so indeed he now is the Sacrificer's '<I>k</I>itya;' for he is to be built up by him, and therefore is his '<I>k</I>itya.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:17">6:1:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. Now it was those five bodily parts (tanu) of his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) that became relaxed,--hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow,--they are these five layers (of the fire-altar); and when he builds up the five layers, thereby he builds him up by those bodily parts; and inasmuch as he builds up (<I>k</I>i), therefore they are layers (<I>k</I>iti).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:18">6:1:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. And that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati who became relaxed is the year; and those five bodily parts of his which became relaxed are the seasons; for there are five seasons, and five are those layers: when he builds up the five layers, he thereby builds him up with the seasons; and inasmuch as he builds up (lays down), therefore they are layers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:19">6:1:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. And that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the year, who became relaxed, is that very V&acirc;yu (wind) who blows yonder. And those five bodily parts of his, the seasons, which became relaxed, are the regions (or quarters)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_305"></A><A HREF="#fn_305"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for five in number are the regions, and five those layers: when he builds up the five layers, he builds him up with the regions; and inasmuch as he builds up, therefore they are layers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:20">6:1:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. And the Fire that is laid down on the built (altar), that is yonder Sun;--that same Agni is indeed (raised) on the altar, and that just because Agni had restored him (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:21">6:1:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. But they say,--Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, when relaxed, said to the gods, 'Restore me!' The gods said to Agni, 'In thee we will heal this our father Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.'--</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'Then I will enter into him, when whole,' he said.--'So be it!' they said. Hence, while being Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, they yet call him Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:22">6:1:2:22</A></FONT></span>22. In the fire the gods healed him by means of oblations; and whatever oblation they offered that became a baked brick and passed into him. And because they were produced from what was offered (ish<I>t</I>a), therefore they are bricks (ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;). And hence they bake the bricks by means of the fire, for it is oblations they thus make.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:23">6:1:2:23</A></FONT></span>23. He spake, 'Even as much as ye offer, even so much is my happiness:' and inasmuch as for him there was happiness (ka) in what was offered (ish<I>t</I>a), therefore also they are bricks (ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:24">6:1:2:24</A></FONT></span>24. Here now &Acirc;kt&acirc;kshya used to say, 'Only he who knows abundant bricks possessed of (special) prayers, should build up the fire (altar): abundantly indeed he then heals Father Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:25">6:1:2:25</A></FONT></span>25. But T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya used to say, 'Surely the bricks possessed of prayers are the nobility, and the space-fillers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_306"></A><A HREF="#fn_306"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are the peasants; and the noble is the feeder, and the peasantry the food; and where there is abundant food for the feeder, that realm is indeed prosperous and thrives: let him therefore pile up abundant space-fillers!' Such then was the speech of those two, but the settled practice is different therefrom.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:26">6:1:2:26</A></FONT></span>26. Now that father (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) is (also) the son:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_154"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 154</FONT></A></p>  
<p>inasmuch as he created Agni, thereby he is Agni's father; and inasmuch as Agni restored him, thereby Agni is his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) father; and inasmuch as he created the gods, thereby he is the father of the gods; and inasmuch as the gods restored him, thereby the gods are his fathers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:27">6:1:2:27</A></FONT></span>27. Twofold verily is this,--father and son, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati and Agni, Agni and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati and the gods, the gods and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati--(for) whosoever knows this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:28">6:1:2:28</A></FONT></span>28. He builds up with&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_307"></A><A HREF="#fn_307"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, 'By that deity'--that deity, doubtless, is V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech),--'A&#7749;giras-like,'--A&#7749;giras, doubtless, is the breath;--'lie thou steady!'--that is, 'lie thou firm;' or 'lie thou firmly established.' It is both with speech and with breath that he builds; for Agni is speech, and Indra is the breath; and the fire (agni) relates to Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up. And again, Indra and Agni are all the gods, (for) Agni belongs to all deities: thus as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus builds him up.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:29">6:1:2:29</A></FONT></span>29. Here now they say, 'Wherefore is Agni (the fire-altar) built of this (earth)?' But, surely, when that deity (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) became relaxed (fell asunder), he flowed along this (earth) in the shape of his life-sap; and when the gods restored him (put him together), they gathered him up from this earth: this earth then is that one brick&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_308"></A><A HREF="#fn_308"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for Agni is this earth, since</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_155"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 155</FONT></A></p>  
<p>it is thereof&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_309"></A><A HREF="#fn_309"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that the whole Agni is built up. Now this earth is four-cornered, for the quarters are her corners: hence the bricks are four-cornered; for all the bricks are after the manner of this earth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:30">6:1:2:30</A></FONT></span>30. As to this they say, 'But if he (Agni) thus consists of one brick, how then (comes he to be) a five-bricked&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_310"></A><A HREF="#fn_310"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> one?' Now surely the first brick of clay is this earth,--whatever made of clay he places on that (altar) that is that one brick. And when he puts thereon the heads of the animal victims&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_311"></A><A HREF="#fn_311"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that is the animal-brick. And when he puts on the gold plate and man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_312"></A><A HREF="#fn_312"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, when he scatters gold shavings thereon, that is the golden brick. And when he puts on two spoonfuls (of ghee)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_313"></A><A HREF="#fn_313"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> when he puts on the mortar and pestle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_314"></A><A HREF="#fn_314"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and fire-sticks, that is the wood-brick. And when he puts on a lotus-leaf (petal), a tortoise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_315"></A><A HREF="#fn_315"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A>, sour curds, honey, ghee, and whatever other food he puts on, that is the fifth brick, the food. Thus, then, it is a five-bricked (Agni).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:31">6:1:2:31</A></FONT></span>31. As to this they say, 'On which side is the head of the brick?'--'Where he touches it and says a prayer,' so say some, 'on one end of the naturally perforated (brick)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_316"></A><A HREF="#fn_316"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> alone indeed should he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>

<p><A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A></p>  
<p>say a prayer while touching it, but thus all those (bricks) of his are turned towards the naturally perforated one.' Let him not do so, for those bricks doubtless are his (Agni's) limbs, his joints; and it would be just as if he were to put a head on each limb, on each joint. But indeed, the fire which is deposited on the pile, that is the head of all those (bricks).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:32">6:1:2:32</A></FONT></span>32. Here they say, 'How many animal victims are laid upon the fire (altar)?'--Let him say 'Five,' for he does lay thereon those five victims.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:33">6:1:2:33</A></FONT></span>33. Or, 'One,' he may say; 'a ewe;' for a ewe (avi) is this earth, since she favours (av) all these creatures. And the fire (altar) also is this earth, for the whole fire (altar) is built up thereof: hence he may say, 'One.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:34">6:1:2:34</A></FONT></span>34. Or, 'Two,' he may say, 'two sheep;' for sheep, indeed, are both this (earth) and that (sky), since these two favour all these creatures;--what clay (there is in the brick) that is this earth; and what water there is that is that sky; and the bricks consist of clay and water: therefore he may say, 'Two.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:35">6:1:2:35</A></FONT></span>35. Or he may say, 'A cow (or bullock, go);--'the cow forsooth means these worlds, for whatever walks (gam) that walks in these worlds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_317"></A><A HREF="#fn_317"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_157"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 157</FONT></A></p>  
<p>fire also is these worlds: therefore he may say, 'A cow.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:1:2:36">6:1:2:36</A></FONT></span>36. As to this they say, 'For what object is this fire (altar) built? Having become a bird, he (Agni) shall bear me to the sky!' so say some; but let him not think so; for by assuming that form, the vital airs became Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_318"></A><A HREF="#fn_318"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; by assuming that form, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_319"></A><A HREF="#fn_319"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; by assuming that form, the gods became immortal and what thereby the vital airs, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and the gods became, that indeed he (the Sacrificer) thereby becomes.</p>
