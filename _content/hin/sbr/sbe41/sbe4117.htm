<p><A NAME="page_81"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 81</FONT></A></p>  
<p>produced,--and so they are even now produced after this one: he thus places him in the very middle of that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and consecrates him in the middle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:2">5:3:5:2</A></FONT></span>2. Before the M&acirc;hendra (cup) has been drawn,--for that M&acirc;hendra cup is Indra's special (nishkevalya) cup, and so is that Nishkevalya Stotra (hymn) and Nishkevalya <I>S</I>astra (recitation); and the Sacrificer is Indra: he thus consecrates him--in his own resting-place. Hence before the M&acirc;hendra (cup) has been drawn,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:3">5:3:5:3</A></FONT></span>3. He spreads a tiger-skin in front of the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's hearth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. X, 5), 'Thou art Soma's beauty.' For because when Soma flowed through Indra he (Indra) thereupon became a tiger, therefore he is Soma's beauty: this is why he says, 'Thou art Soma's splendour;'--'may my beauty become like unto thine!' He thus bestows the tiger's beauty on him: therefore he says, 'May my beauty become like unto thine!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:4">5:3:5:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then offers the P&acirc;rtha oblations. Now P<I>ri</I>thin Vainya was consecrated first of men. He desired that he might appropriate to himself all food. They offered up for him those (oblations), and he appropriated to himself all the food here on earth. They would even call forest beasts to him, saying, 'Come hither thou (beast) so and so, the king wants to cook thee!' Thus he appropriated all food here on earth; and verily he appropriates to himself all food for whom that knows this those (oblations) are offered.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:5">5:3:5:5</A></FONT></span>5. There are twelve of them,--for there are</p>

<p><A NAME="page_82"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 82</FONT></A></p>  
<p>twelve months in the year: therefore there are twelve of them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:6">5:3:5:6</A></FONT></span>6. Six he offers before, and six after, the consecration: he thereby places him in the very middle of that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and consecrates him in the middle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:7">5:3:5:7</A></FONT></span>7. Now of those which he offers before the consecration, B<I>ri</I>haspati is the last (recipient), and of those which he offers after the consecration, Indra is the first;--but B<I>ri</I>haspati is priestly dignity (brahma), and Indra is might, vigour: with these two kinds of vigour he thus encloses him on both sides.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:8">5:3:5:8</A></FONT></span>8. Those which he offers before the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, 'To Agni hail!'--Agni is brightness (te<I>g</I>as): with brightness he thus sprinkles (endows) him;--'To Soma hail!'--Soma is princely power (kshatra): with princely power he thus sprinkles him;--'To Savit<I>ri</I> hail!'--Savit<I>ri</I> is the impeller of the gods: impelled by Savit<I>ri</I> he thus consecrates him;--'To Sarasvat&icirc; hail!'--Sarasvat&icirc; is Speech: he thus sprinkles him with Speech;--'To P&ucirc;shan hail!'--P&ucirc;shan is cattle: with cattle he thus sprinkles him;--'To B<I>ri</I>haspati hail!'--B<I>ri</I>haspati is priestly dignity: with priestly dignity he thus sprinkles him. These he offers before the consecration: these are called the Agni-named ones.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:9">5:3:5:9</A></FONT></span>9. Those which he offers after the consecration, he offers (resp.) with, 'To Indra hail!'--Indra is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To the roar hail!'--roar means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To the noise hail! 'noise means vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To A<I>m</I><I>s</I>a hail!'--A<I>m</I><I>s</I>a is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles him;--'To Bhaga hail!'--Bhaga is vigour: with vigour he thus sprinkles</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_83"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 83</FONT></A></p>  
<p>him;--'To Aryaman hail!'--he thus makes him the friend (aryaman) of everything here. These he offers after the consecration: these are called the &Acirc;ditya-named&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> ones.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:10">5:3:5:10</A></FONT></span>10. In front of the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's hearth are the (four) consecration vessels in which that consecration water is contained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:11">5:3:5:11</A></FONT></span>11. There is a pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a (butea frondosa) one: with (the water of) that (vessel) a Br&acirc;hman sprinkles;--the Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a tree is priestly dignity (brahman): it is with priestly dignity that he sprinkles (endows) him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:12">5:3:5:12</A></FONT></span>12. There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: therewith one of his own (kinsmen, or brothers) sprinkles. The udumbara tree means sustenance, (that is) food, and the 'own' means sustenance, for as far as a man's own goes, so far he does not hunger: thereby his 'own' is sustenance, and therefore one of his own (kinsmen) sprinkles with an udumbara (vessel).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:13">5:3:5:13</A></FONT></span>13. There is one made of the foot (stem) of the nyagrodha (ficus indica): therewith a friendly (mitrya) R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya sprinkles: for by its feet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A></p>  
<p>nyagrodha tree is supported, and by the friend (mitra) the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya (nobleman or king) is supported: therefore a friendly R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya sprinkles with (the water of a vessel) made of the foot of a nyagrodha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:14">5:3:5:14</A></FONT></span>14. There is an a<I>s</I>vattha (ficus religiosa) one: therewith a Vai<I>s</I>ya sprinkles. Because Indra on that (former) occasion called upon the Maruts staying on the A<I>s</I>vattha tree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, therefore a Vai<I>s</I>ya sprinkles with an a<I>s</I>vattha (vessel). These are the consecration vessels.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:15">5:3:5:15</A></FONT></span>15. He then prepares two strainers (pavitra), with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. X, 6), 'Purifiers ye are, Vish<I>n</I>u's own;'--the significance is the same (as before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>). He weaves gold (threads) into them. With them he purifies those consecration waters. As to why he weaves gold (threads) in,--gold is immortal life: that immortal life he lays into these (waters), and hence he weaves gold (threads) in.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:16">5:3:5:16</A></FONT></span>16. He purifies with, 'By the impulse of Savit<I>ri</I> I purify you with a flawless purifier, with the rays of the sun.' The significance is the same (as before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>). 'Not downfallen thou art, the friend of Speech, born of heat,'--unimpaired by the Rakshas he means to say when he says, 'not downfallen;'--'the friend of Speech'--as long as there is water in the vital airs, so long (man) speaks with speech: therefore he says, 'the friend of Speech.'</p>

<p><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:17">5:3:5:17</A></FONT></span>17. 'Born of heat' he says, for from fire springs smoke, from smoke the cloud, from the cloud rain,--it is from fire that these are produced: hence he says, 'born of heat.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:18">5:3:5:18</A></FONT></span>18. 'Soma's portion thou art;' for when they consecrate him with those (waters), then there is an oblation: therefore he says 'Soma's portion thou art;'--'Hail, spiriters of kings!'--it is with 'Hail' that he thus purifies them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:19">5:3:5:19</A></FONT></span>19. He distributes them over those (consecration) vessels, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. X, 7), 'Playmates are these glorious waters;'--'not overbearing' he means to say, when he says 'playmates;' and by 'these glorious waters' he means to say 'the powerful ones;'--'unimpaired, active, enveloping,' he thereby means to say 'ye are unimpaired by the Rakshas;'--'In the habitations Varu<I>n</I>a hath made a home;'--the habitations are the people (clans): 'in the people Varu<I>n</I>a has made a support' he thereby says;--'he, the child of the waters, in the best of mothers;'--for he who performs the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya is indeed the child of the waters: therefore he says, 'the child of the waters, in the best of mothers.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:20">5:3:5:20</A></FONT></span>20. He then makes him (the king) put on garments. There is that one called t&acirc;rpya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; therein are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_86"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 86</FONT></A></p>  
<p>wrought&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> all forms of sacrifice: that he makes him put on, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. X, 8), 'Thou art the inner caul of knighthood (kshatra)!' He thus causes him to be born from out of what is the inner caul (amnion) of knighthood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:21">5:3:5:21</A></FONT></span>21. He then makes him put on one of undyed wool, with, 'Thou art the outer caul of knighthood!' He thus causes him to be born from what is the outer caul (chorion) of knighthood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:22">5:3:5:22</A></FONT></span>22. He then throws over the mantle, with, 'Thou art the womb of knighthood!' He thus causes him to be born from what is the womb of knighthood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:23">5:3:5:23</A></FONT></span>23. He then draws the head-band together, and conceals it (tucks it under) in front&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, with, 'Thou art the navel of knighthood!' He thus places him in what is the navel of knighthood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:24">5:3:5:24</A></FONT></span>24. Now some wind it quite round about (the navel) saying, 'that (band) is his navel, and this navel goes all round.' But let him not do this, but let him merely tuck it under in front, for this navel is in front. And as to why he makes him put on the garments;--he thereby causes him to be born&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thinking, 'I will anoint him when born:' that is why he makes him put on the garments.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:25">5:3:5:25</A></FONT></span>25. Now some put off those garments&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and make him put on again the garment of initiation. But let him not do this; for, the limbs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> being his natural vestments, they deprive him of his limbs, of his native bodily form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varu<I>n</I>a. Let him put on one of those same garments: he (the priest) thereby causes him to be furnished with his limbs, his native bodily form. The garment of initiation belongs to Varu<I>n</I>a: he thus saves him from the Varu<I>n</I>ic garment of initiation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:26">5:3:5:26</A></FONT></span>26. And when he enters the bath&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> they throw it into (the water). This is a congruous&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> performance. After putting on one of those same garments he comes out (of the bath). Let him give away those (garments) either when the omentum of the barren cow has been offered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>, or at the completing oblation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:27">5:3:5:27</A></FONT></span>27. He (the Adhvaryu) then strings the bow, with, 'Thou art Indra's V<I>ri</I>tra-killer;' for the bow</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is indeed a V<I>ri</I>tra-killer, and the Sacrificer is Indra,--he is Indra in a twofold way, both as a Kshatriya, and as Sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's V<I>ri</I>tra-killer.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:28">5:3:5:28</A></FONT></span>28. He then strokes the two arms&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with, 'Mitra's thou art,--Varu<I>n</I>a's thou art;' for the bow is within the two arms, and by his two arms the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya pertains to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a: therefore he says, 'Mitra's thou art, Varu<I>n</I>a's thou art.' He hands it to him, with, 'May he slay V<I>ri</I>tra by thee!' whereby he means to say, 'May he slay by thee his spiteful enemy!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:29">5:3:5:29</A></FONT></span>29. He then hands him three arrows. That first-one by which he pierces on shooting&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, that is one, that one is this earth, that one is called 'd<I>ri</I>b&acirc;.' And the one by which (the enemy) being pierced lies either living or dead, that is the second, that is this air, that is called 'ru<I>g</I>&acirc;.' And the one with which he misses (his aim)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that is the third, that is yonder sky, that is called 'kshum&acirc;.' For these are the three (kinds of) arrows: therefore he hands him three arrows.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:30">5:3:5:30</A></FONT></span>30. These he hands to him with, 'Protect ye him in front&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>!--Protect ye him from behind!--Protect ye him from the side!--Protect ye</p>

<p><A NAME="page_89"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 89</FONT></A></p>  
<p>him from (all) quarters!' Thus he makes all the quarters safe from arrows for him. And as to why he hands the bow to him;--this, the bow, truly is the nobleman's strength: it is because he thinks, 'I will consecrate him when endowed with strength!' that he hands the weapon to him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:5:31">5:3:5:31</A></FONT></span>31. Thereupon he makes him pronounce the &acirc;vid formulas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. X, 9), 'In sight, ye mortals!

'Present are Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, the upholders of the law;'--Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a are the out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus announces him to the out-breathing and in-breathing, and they approve of his consecration, and approved by them he is consecrated.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_166"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_166">84:2</A> See I, 1, 3, 1 (part i, p. 19).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_167"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_167">84:3</A> See I, 1, 3, 6 (part i, p. 21).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_168"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_168">85:1</A> This is variously explained, by K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana and S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, as a linen one, or simply one soaked in ghee, or a trip&acirc;<I>n</I>a one--i.e. one made of tripar<I>n</I>a plants, or a thrice saturated one (with ghee)--or one woven out of materials derived from the t<I>ri</I>p&acirc; plant. It is quite evident that they did not exactly know what to make of it. Indeed, it would almost seem as if the author of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a himself was already doubtful as to the meaning of the term. Goldst&uuml;cker (s.v. abhishe<I>k</I>an&icirc;ya) perhaps rightly takes it to mean a silk under-garment.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_169"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_169">86:1</A> According to the commentators, figures of sacrificial spoons, cups, &amp;c., are sewn in by means of a needle.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_170"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_170">86:2</A> The commentators do not seem to be quite in accord in regard to this particular item of the ceremonial. The most natural explanation, however, seems to be this: the head-band (turban, ush<I>n</I>&icirc;sha) is wound (? once) round the head and tied behind; the ends being then drawn over the shoulders so as to hang down from the neck in the manner of a brahmanical cord (or like the ribbon of an order); and being finally tucked in under the mantle somewhere near the navel.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_171"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_171">86:3</A> Viz. inasmuch as the garments are intended to symbolically represent the vestures of the embryo and stages of birth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_172"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_172">87:1</A> This change of garments takes place optionally when the M&acirc;hendra libation is about to be offered. Katy. XV, 5, 16; 7, 23-26.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_173"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_173">87:2</A> That is, according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, the skin, &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_174"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_174">87:3</A> That is, at the end of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya. In case of the change of garments before the M&acirc;hendra libation, the king keeps on the initiation garment in entering and coming out of the bath. This paragraph is of course put in here by anticipation, merely in order to state all that relates to the garments.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_175"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_175">87:4</A> Viz. inasmuch as it is in accordance with what is done at an ordinary Soma-sacrifice, at the end of which the Sacrificer and his wife enter the bath and come forth with fresh garments. See part ii, p. 385. In the present case the king is to enter the bath clothed in one of those three garments, and in coming out he is to put on another of them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_176"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_176">87:5</A> See part ii, pp. 391-2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_177"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_177">87:6</A> For the Udavas&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc;-ish<I>t</I>i, see ib. p. 389.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_178"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_178">88:1</A> Viz. the arms of the king, as it would seem, according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a; but the arms (or ends) of the bow, according to Karka and Mah&icirc;dhara.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_179"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_179">88:2</A> Literally, on fixing (the arrow on the string); or perhaps, on hitting (the enemy).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_180"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_180">88:3</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes apa-r&acirc;dhnoti in the sense of 'he hurts (or hits)' the enemy. In the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text (Grantha MS.) the three arrows are called ru<I>g</I>&acirc;, d<I>ri</I>v&acirc;, and kshup&acirc; resp.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_181"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_181">88:4</A> Or perhaps,--whilst (he is) moving forward,--whilst moving backward,--whilst moving sideways.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_182"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_182">89:1</A> For a sham fight with arrows forming part of the ceremony in the Black Ya<I>g</I>us ritual, see <A HREF="sbe4120.htm#page_100">p. 100</A>. note <A HREF="sbe4120.htm#fn_199">1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_183"></A><A HREF="sbe4117.htm#fr_183">89:2</A> That is, as would seem, the formulas of information (or perhaps of announcement, introduction); the first of these formulas beginning with &acirc;vis (in sight), the others with the participle &acirc;vitta, i.e. 'obtained, present;' S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a and Mah&icirc;dhara, however, taking it in the sense of 'informed,'--a meaning which, indeed, the word may perhaps have been intended to convey in these formulas.</P>
