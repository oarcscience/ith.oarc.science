Being about to build the G&acirc;rhapatya (fire-place), he sweeps (its site) with a Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a (butea frondosa) branch. For when he builds the G&acirc;rhapatya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> he settles on that place; and whatsoever builders of fire-altars (there have been), they are indeed settled on this earth; and when he sweeps (that place) he thereby sweeps away those settled (there before hire), thinking, 'Lest I should settle on those already settled (here).'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:2">7:1:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. [He sweeps, with V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XII, 45] 'Off with you! away with you! crawl away from here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_557"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!'--that is, 'Go off, go away, and crawl away from here!' he says this to those that crawl on their belly;--'Ye that are here of old and of late!' that is, 'both ye who were here of yore, and ye of the present day.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:3">7:1:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. 'Yama hath given the settlement on earth (to this Sacrificer);'--for Yama indeed rules over the settling on this earth, and it is he who grants to this (Sacrificer) a settlement on this earth.</p>

'The Fathers have prepared this place for him!' for Yama is the Kshatra (nobility, or ruling power), and the Fathers (deceased ancestors) are the clansmen; and to whomsoever the chief (kshatriya), with the approval of the clan, grants a settlement, that (settlement) is properly given: and in like manner does Yama, the ruling power, with the consent of the Fathers, the clan, now grant to this (Sacrificer) a settlement on this earth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:5">7:1:1:5</A></FONT></span>5.

He then scatters saline soil (over the hearth-site); for the G&acirc;rhapatya is this world, and salt means cattle: he thus bestows cattle on this world,--hence those cattle here in this world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:7">7:1:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. And again why he scatters saline soil. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created creatures; he created them with different kinds of amnions: they did not agree together. He desired, 'May they agree together!' He made them to be of the same (kind of) amnion: hence even to this day, being of equal amnions, they agree together. And he who offers, offers thinking, 'May I be (born) with the same (kind of) amnion as the gods!' and when he scatters saline salt (in the hearth-site) he thereby becomes of equal amnion with the gods.</p>

XII, 46] 'Concord thou art!' for thereby they agreed together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--'fulfilment of desire;' for salt is cattle, and fulfilment of desire means cattle;--'In me may there be the fulfilment of thy desire!' that is, 'May there be on me cattle for thee!'--He covers with it the whole (circular) G&acirc;rhapatya; for the G&acirc;rhapatya altar is the womb, and the saline soil is the amnion: he thus covers the whole womb with the amnion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:9">7:1:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. He then scatters sand to keep (the saline soil, or amnion) from being scorched&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_561"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;--for sand is nothing else than the ashes of Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara, and him, Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara, he is indeed about to build up; and Agni does not scorch his own self.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:10">7:1:1:10</A></FONT></span>10.

Agni's soil thou art!' for Agni's ashes are useless, and the sand is not useless: he thus makes it (the G&acirc;rhapatya hearth) to be useful. He covers with it the whole G&acirc;rhapatya; for the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> G&acirc;rhapatya altar is the womb, and the sand is seed: he thus fills the whole womb with seed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:12">7:1:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. He then encloses it with enclosing-stones; for the enclosing-stones are the womb: he thus encloses the seed here cast in the womb; and hence the seed which is cast is enclosed in the womb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:13">7:1:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. And, again, why he encloses it with enclosing-stones;--the G&acirc;rhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the enclosing-stones are the waters: he thus surrounds this world with water,--it is with the ocean that he thus surrounds it on all sides, and hence the ocean flows round this world on all sides. (He puts up the stones) by turning to the right (or south)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_561"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, whence the ocean flows round this world (from the east) southwards;--by means of a dug out (hole, or moat)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, whence the ocean flows round this world in a moat.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:14">7:1:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. [V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XII, 46] 'Ranging ye are!' for he does range them;--'ranging around ye are!' for he does range them all round;--'upwards ranging get ye fixed!' thus he says, placing them upright: hence the ocean surges upwards; but were he to place them sideways, the ocean surely would all at once overflow all this (earth). He does not settle them, for unsettled are the waters; nor does he pronounce the S&ucirc;dadohas (verse) on them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_563"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

For the enclosing-stones are the bones, and the S&ucirc;dadohas is the breath; and there is no breath in the bones. With one and the same formula he lays down many bricks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for of one and the same form are the waters; and as to there being many enclosing-stones, it is because there are many waters.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:16">7:1:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. The enclosing-stones, then, are the womb; the saline earth is the amnion, and the sand is the seed. The enclosing-stones are outside, and the saline earth is inside; for the womb is outside, and the amnion inside. The saline earth is outside, and the sand inside; for the amnion is outside, and the seed inside. He who is born is born from these: it is from them that he thus causes him (Agni) to be born.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:17">7:1:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. Thereon he now builds it (the hearth): he</p>

He puts on (the circular site) four (bricks) running eastwards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; two behind running crosswise (from south to north), and two (such) in front. Now the four which he puts on running eastwards are the body; and as to there being four of these, it is because this body (of ours) consists, of four parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The two at the back then are the thighs; and the two in front the arms; and where the body is that (includes) the head.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:19">7:1:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. Now he here fashions him (Agni) with wings and tail; for whatlike the seed is fashioned in the womb suchlike (offspring) is born: thus inasmuch as he now fashions him with wings and tail, he is born hereafter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with wings and tail.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:20">7:1:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. While being indeed furnished with wings and tail, people do not see him as one having wings and tail&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>: hence one does not see the child in the womb in its proper shape; but hereafter they (will) see him as one having wings and tail, and hence one sees the child after it is born in its proper shape.</p>

Sitting south (of the hearth-site) with his face to the north he puts on first one (brick) of the upper (north) part&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (of the trunk); and in this manner that Agni of his comes to be built up towards (or for the Sacrificer) himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:22">7:1:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. [He puts it on, with V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XII, 47; <I>Ri</I>k S. III, 22, 1, &amp;c.] 'This is the Agni wherein Indra taketh the Soma-juice,' for the G&acirc;rhapatya hearth is this (terrestrial) world, and the Soma-juice is the waters: Indra thus took up the waters in this world;--'into his belly, craving it,'--for the belly is the centre;--'thousandfold strength, like a swift racer,'--the thousandfold strength, doubtless, is the waters,--'thou, having gained, art exalted, O knower of beings!' that is, 'thou, being built, art built&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, O knower of beings!'</p>

XII, 48] 'O Agni, what splendour is thine in the heaven,'--his splendour in the heaven doubtless is the sun;--'on earth,' that on earth is this fire;--'and that which is in the plants, in the waters, O holy one!' he thereby means the fire that is both in the plants, and in the waters;--'wherewith thou hast overspread the wide air,'--that is, the wind;--'brilliant is that light, surging, man-viewing;' that is, 'great is that light, surging, man-viewing.'</p>

<p>thou goest up to the flood of the heaven;' the flood of that heaven doubtless is the waters (of the atmosphere): to them he goes by his smoke;--'hither callest thou the divine inspirers,'--the divine inspirers doubtless are the vital airs, for these inspire all thoughts;--'the waters approach (thee), they that are beyond the luminous sphere of the sun, and they that are below here;'--the luminous sphere doubtless is that world yonder where that (sun) is burning: he thereby means both the waters which are beyond, and those which are below that (sun).</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:1:1:26">7:1:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. He puts them down separately: what different desires there are, those he thereby lays into the self. He 'settles' them once: he thereby makes the self one. He pronounces the S&ucirc;dadohas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> verse on them; for the S&ucirc;dadohas is the vital air: by means of the vital air he thus makes him (Agni) continuous, joins him together.</p>

<p>with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XII, 51), 'Potent nourishment, O Agni, the possession of kine,'--nourishment means cattle: he thus invokes for him the blessing of cattle;--'Grant thou perpetually unto him that calleth!'--he that calls doubtless is the Sacrificer; 'May there be to us a son, the perpetuator of the race,'--a son means offspring;--'let that, O Agni, be thy good-will unto us!' he therewith invokes a blessing.</p>

These two are his (Agni's) thighs,--separately he puts them on, separately he 'settles' them, separately he pronounces the S&ucirc;dadohas verse upon them, for separate are these two thighs. There are two of them, for there are two thighs. Behind he puts them on, for behind are those thighs. At their upper ends they are joined (to the central ones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), for so are these thighs joined (to the body) at their upper ends.</p>

Thereupon, going round again by the same way, he sits down on the south side, with his face to the north, and puts on first the northern one of the two (bricks) in front, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

There are two of them, for there are two arms. He puts them on in the forepart, for these arms are here in front. At their upper ends they are joined (to the central ones), for so are these two arms joined (to the body) at the upper ends. Those two (arms) he puts on thus (from north to south), and those two (thighs) thus (from south to north): that is (from east to) southward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for thus it is with the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>so great he thus builds him. Eight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes thirteen,--thirteen months are a year, and there are thirteen layers of earth in the fire-altar: as great as Agni is, as great .as is his measure, so great does this become.</p>
