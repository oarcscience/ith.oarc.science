<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:3:2:3">6:3:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. Then the ass, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

XI, 15), 'Forth-speeding, come treading down the curses!'--curse means evil: thus, 'running come, treading down the evil!'--'come, delighting, into Rudra's chieftainship!'--beasts belong to Rudra: thus, 'come thou, delighting, into the chieftainship of him who is thy deity!' he thus searches for him by means of the horse.</p>

Then the ass with, Traverse the wide air, thou possessed of prosperous pastures and affording safety!'--as the text, so its meaning;--'with P&ucirc;shan as thy mate;'--P&ucirc;shan, doubtless, is this earth; thus, 'together with her as thy mate:' he thus searches for him by means of the ass.</p>

XI, 16), 'From the Earth's seat, A&#7749;giras-like, bring thou Agni Pur&icirc;shya!'--that is, 'from the Earth's lap bring thou Agni, favourable to cattle, as Agni (did)!' he thus searches for him (Agni) by means of the he-goat.</p>
