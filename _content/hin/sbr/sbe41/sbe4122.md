#### THE DA*S*APEYA.

### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:1">5:4:5:1</span></span>1. Now
when Varu*n*a was consecrated, his lustre departed from him,--lustre
means vigour: that Vish*n*u, the Sacrifice, it was he that departed from
him,--probably that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is
anointed on that occasion, drove out his lustre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:2">5:4:5:2</span></span>2. He
stole after it with those deities <span
id="fr_220"></span>[1](#fn_220),--with Savit*ri*, the impeller
(prasavit*ri*); with Sarasvatî, speech; with Tvash*tri*, the forms of
being; with Pûshan, cattle; with Indra, on the part of him <span
id="fr_221"></span>[2](#fn_221) (the Sacrificer); with B*ri*haspati,
holiness; with Varu*n*a, might; with Agni, fiery spirit; with Soma, the
King;

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --but only through
Vish*n*u <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_222), the tenth deity, he
found it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:3">5:4:5:3</span></span>3. And
because he there stole after (anu-sam-s*ri*p) with those deities, hence
the name Sa*m*s*ri*pa*h*. And because he becomes consecrated on the
tenth day, therefore (this ceremony is called) Da*s*apeya <span
id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_223). And because each time ten (men) steal
along <span id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_224) after each cup, therefore
also it is called Da*s*apeya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:4">5:4:5:4</span></span>4. Here
now they say,--'Let him steal forth after enumerating ten Soma-drinking
grandfathers <span id="fr_225"></span>[4](#fn_225): it is thus that he
obtains for himself the Soma-draught of this (Da*s*apeya), for it is a
"drinking of ten."' But that is an overburdening <span
id="fr_226"></span>[5](#fn_226), for people (will

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

be able to) obtain only two or three Soma-drinking grandfathers: hence
let him steal forth after enumerating those same deities <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_227).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:5">5:4:5:5</span></span>5. For,
surely, it was by those same deities that Varu*n*a obtained the
Soma-draught of that (Consecration-ceremony); and in like manner does
this one now obtain the Soma-draught of that (ceremony): let him
therefore steal forth after enumerating those same deities. Now as soon
as the completing oblation <span id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_228) of that
Consecration-ceremony comes to an end,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:6">5:4:5:6</span></span>6. He
prepares those (sa*m*s*ri*p) oblations,--a cake on twelve, or eight,
potsherds for Savit*ri*; for Savit*ri* is the impeller of the gods:
impelled by Savit*ri*, Varu*n*a on that occasion stole along; and in
like manner does this one now steal along impelled by Savit*ri*. At this
(oblation) he presents one lotus-flower <span
id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_229).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:7">5:4:5:7</span></span>7. He
then prepares a (rice) pap for Sarasvatî,--for Sarasvatî is speech, and
it was with speech that Varu*n*a on that occasion stole along; and in
like manner does this one now steal along with speech. At this
(oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:8">5:4:5:8</span></span>8. He
then prepares a cake on ten potsherds for Tvash*tri*,--for Tvash*tri*
(the fashioner, creator) rules over living forms, and with Tvash*tri*,
the living forms, Varu*n*a on that occasion stole along; and in

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

like manner does this one now steal along with Tvash*tri*, the living
forms. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:9">5:4:5:9</span></span>9. He
then prepares a pap for Pûshan;--for Pûshan is cattle, and with cattle
Varu*n*a on that occasion stole along; and in like manner does this one
now steal along with cattle. At this (oblation) he presents one
lotus-flower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:10">5:4:5:10</span></span>10. He
then prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra;--for Indriya means
energy, vigour, and with vigour Varu*n*a on that occasion stole along;
and in like manner does this one now steal along with energy, with
vigour. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:11">5:4:5:11</span></span>11. He
then prepares a pap for B*ri*haspati;--for B*ri*haspati means holiness,
and with holiness Varu*n*a on that occasion stole along; and in likes
manner does this one now steal along with holiness. At this (oblation)
he presents one lotus-flower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:12">5:4:5:12</span></span>12. He
then prepares a barley pap for Varu*n*a;--with what vehemence Varu*n*a
seized the creatures, with that vehemence Varu*n*a on that occasion
stole along; and in like manner does this one now steal along with
vehemence. At this (oblation) he presents one lotus-flower.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:13">5:4:5:13</span></span>13. The
deities of the Upasad are the (eighth, ninth, and) tenth <span
id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_230). At these (oblations) he presents

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

five lotus-flowers. That wreath of twelve lotus-flowers he puts on
himself; that is the initiation: by that initiation he initiates
himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:14">5:4:5:14</span></span>14. And
as to why there are twelve (flowers),--there being twelve months in the
year, and the year being All, it is by the All that he thus initiates
him: what flowers there are of the lotus, they are a form (an image) of
the sky, they are a form of the stars; and what seed-stalks there are,
they are a form of the air; and what suckers there are, they are a form
of this (earth): thus he initiates him (to rule) over these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:15">5:4:5:15</span></span>15. And
having bought the King (Soma) <span id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231), and

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

tied him up in two parts, they drive him around. Having then placed
one-half on the throne-seat, he proceeds therewith. Having then placed
on the throne-seat that portion which was deposited in the Brahman's
house, he proceeds with the guest-meal. Whilst he is proceeding with the
guest-meal, he performs the Upasads. Whilst he is performing the
Upasads,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:16">5:4:5:16</span></span>16. He
prepares those (three) oblations,--a cake on eight potsherds for Agni; a
pap for Soma; and a cake on three potsherds, or a pap, for Vish*n*u.
Thus he performs the sacrifice in this way, if it pleases him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:17">5:4:5:17</span></span>17. But
let him not do it in this way; for he who departs from the path of the
sacrifice stumbles, and he who departs from the path of the Upasads
certainly departs from the path of the sacrifice: let him therefore not
depart from the path of the Upasads.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:18">5:4:5:18</span></span>18. Now
when he offers to Agni, he steals along with Agni, with fiery spirit;
and when he offers to Soma, he steals along with Soma, the King; and
when he offers to Vish*n*u,--Vish*n*u being the sacrifice,--he visibly
obtains the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his
own (or, takes it in).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:19">5:4:5:19</span></span>19.
This same (Da*s*apeya) is an Agnish*t*oma sacrifice (performed) with the
seventeenfold (stoma) <span id="fr_232"></span>[1](#fn_232) for
Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold, and Pra*g*âpati is the

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

sacrifice <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_233): thus he visibly obtains
the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:20">5:4:5:20</span></span>20.
Twelve heifers with first calf are the sacrificial fee for this
(sacrifice); for twelve months there are in the year, and the year is
Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains
the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:21">5:4:5:21</span></span>21.
These (heifers) have twelve embryo calves,--that makes twenty-four; for
twenty-four half-moons there are in the year, and the year is
Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains
the sacrifice, and having visibly obtained it, he makes it his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:22">5:4:5:22</span></span>22. He
gives them to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the
south: therefore he gives them to the Brahman. To the Udgât*ri*
(chanter) he gives the gold wreath, to the Hot*ri* the gold plate, to
the two Adhvaryus two golden mirrors, to the Prastot*ri*
([presenter](errata.htm#10)) a horse, to the Maitrâvaru*n*a a sterile
cow, to the Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin a bull, to the Nesh*tri* and Pot*ri*
two garments, to the A*kh*âvâka (a cart) laden with barley, and yoked
(with an ox) on one side, to the Agnîdh an ox <span
id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_234).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:4:5:23">5:4:5:23</span></span>23. Now
there are here either twelve or thirteen <span
id="fr_235"></span>[3](#fn_235) presents,--for either twelve or thirteen
are there months in the year, and the year is Pra*g*âpati, and
Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: thus he visibly obtains the sacrifice, and
having visibly obtained it he makes it his own.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_220"></span>[113:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_220) In the Black
Ya*g*us ritual the order of deities to whom the 'sa*m*s*ri*pâ*m*
havî*m*shi' are offered is as follows,--Agni, Sarasvatî, Savit*ri*,
Pûshan, B*ri*haspati, Indra, Varu*n*a, Soma, Tvash*tri*, Vish*n*u. Cf.
Taitt. S. I, 8, 17; Taitt. Br. I, 8, 1.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[113:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_221) Or, with Indra, for
(the lost vigour) itself. Hardly, 'for us.' The Kâ*n*va text has
'indre*n*âsmai,' and so Sâya*n*a (MS. I. O. 657): asmai apas*ri*tâya
vîryâya tadadhînakara*n*ârtham indre*n*a; yad vâ vibhaktivyatyaya*h*,
anena vîrye*n*a vîryavatâ indre*n*a.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[114:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_222) It seems rather
strange that Varu*n*a and Vish*n*u should be included amongst the
deities, with whose help Varu*n*a sought to recover his vigour, or
Vish*n*u the sacrifice; but--’Twere to consider too curiously, to
consider so.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[114:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_223) That is, da*s*a
(ten) and peya (drink, beverage).

<span id="fn_224"></span>[114:3](sbe4122.htm#fr_224) For an explanation
of the noiseless mode of moving with bent bodies, called sarpa*n*am,
'creeping,' see part ii, pp. 299, 450. It is in this way they are to
move when they betake themselves to the respective fire-places for
performing the sa*m*s*ri*p oblations; as they also do when betaking
themselves to the Sadas to drink the cups of Soma at the Soma-feast on
the next day. When libations of Soma-juice are made from the ten cups
(*k*amasa, see part ii, p. 287), each cup is to be followed by ten
Brâhmans who then take part in consuming the liquor in the Sadas--there
being thus altogether one hundred Brâhmans taking part in these
potations. The contents of the Sacrificer's cup, on the other hand, may
be drunk by ten Ra*g*anyas (i.e. himself and nine others). See Kâty. XV,
8, 18-20; Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 179.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[114:4](sbe4122.htm#fr_225) Sâya*n*a takes this
literally as meaning that he is to call out the name of the Sacrificer's
grandfather, then the grandfather of that one and so on. The commentary
on Kâty. XV, 8, 16, on the other hand, apparently takes it to mean ten
forefathers of the Sacrificer who have performed Soma-sacrifices, from
the grandfather upwards.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[114:5](sbe4122.htm#fr_226) That is, an
excessive demand, or, a weighing down, or crushing of the Sacrificer,
making it impossible for him to perform the ceremony at all.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[115:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_227) That is to say,
after pronouncing the mantra, Vâ*g*. S. X, 30. agreeing partly with
[paragraph 2](sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:2) above, viz. beginning, 'By Savit*ri*,
the impeller; by Sarasvatî, speech,' . . . and ending, 'by Vish*n*u, the
tenth deity, impelled I steal forth.'

<span id="fn_228"></span>[115:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_228) For the Udavasânîyâ
ish*t*i, see part ii, p. 389.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[115:3](sbe4122.htm#fr_229) The lotus-flowers
presented on this occasion are gold ones, according to Sâya*n*a, or
optionally ordinary white or gold ones, according to Kâty. XV, 8, 5-6.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[116:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_230) For the Upasad, or
preliminary oblations of ghee to Agni, Soma, and Vish*n*u, to be
performed twice daily for (usually) three days preceding an ordinary
Soma-sacrifice, see part ii, p. 104. At the Da*s*apeya, the ten
Sa*m*s*ri*p-oblations take as it were the place of the ordinary Upasads,
the latter being performed on the last three preliminary days along
with, and to the same deities as, the last three Sa*m*s*ri*p-oblations;
or, according to some authorities, <span id="page_117">p. 117</span>
being substituted for them. There seems also some difference of opinion
as to the exact time when the other preliminary ceremonies--the
procession and entrance of king Soma, the guest-meal, &c.--are to take
place, see [paragraph 15](sbe4122.htm#5:4:5:15).--According to Kâty. XV,
8,14, these ceremonies are to take place on the seventh day (which the
commentator, however, takes to mean the seventh day of the light
fortnight of *K*aitra; the first seven Sa*m*s*ri*p-oblations being,
according to him, performed on the day before). The Kâ*n*vas, however,
perform these offerings on separate days.--The Taittirîya authorities
seem also to be at variance with each other as to the exact relation of
the Upasads and the last three Sa*m*s*ri*p-oblations, the deities of the
two being, according to their scheme, only partly identical. According
to Âpastamba (and Taitt. Br.) the first seven Sa*m*s*ri*ps are performed
on so many days and, moreover, one Dîkshâ on the seventh day. Then on
the last three days the Sa*m*s*ri*ps and Upasads are combined in this
way, that the eighth day's Sa*m*s*ri*p is performed previous to, the
ninth between, the tenth after the two daily Upasad-performances.--Each
of the ten oblations also requires a special set of fires for its
performance, the first being laid down immediately north of the one used
for the Abhishe*k*anîya ceremony, the second immediately north of the
first, &c.; the last Sa*m*s*ri*p-oblation being performed in the
fire-shed (*s*âlâ) of the Da*s*apeya proper. Kâty. XV, 8, 2-3; cf.
Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 176.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[117:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_231) Namely, at the
beginning of the Abhishe*k*anîya, or Consecration-ceremony, when
Soma-plants are purchased sufficient to last <span id="page_118">p.
118</span> for both that ceremony and the succeeding Da*s*apeya; the
portion destined for the latter ceremony being meanwhile deposited in
the Brahman's house.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[118:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_232) All the chants
(stotra) of the Da*s*apeya are to be executed in the seventeenfold mode
of chanting, or Saptada*s*a-stoma; for an example of which see part ii,
p. 315, note 1.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[119:1](sbe4122.htm#fr_233) See [p.
8](sbe4104.htm#page_8), note \*[1](sbe4104.htm#fn_39)\*.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[119:2](sbe4122.htm#fr_234) The text has 'gam
agnîdhe,' i.e. either 'a bull,' or 'a cow.' So also Katy. XV. 8, 27.
Sâya*n*a, however, refers to another authority,--ana*d*vâham agnîdha iti
sûtritam, . . . vahnir vâ ana*d*van iti hi taittirîyakam.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[119:3](sbe4122.htm#fr_235) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, counting the unborn calves.
