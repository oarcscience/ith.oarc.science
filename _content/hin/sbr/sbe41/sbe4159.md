### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:1">7:2:3:1</span></span>1. He
then places a bunch of darbha (ku*s*a) grass (poa cynosuroides) on (the
middle of the altar-site); for the gods then placed plants thereon, and
in like manner does the Sacrificer now place plants thereon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:2">7:2:3:2</span></span>2. And,
again, why he places a bunch of grass thereon;--when he (Agni) is built
up, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but these
darbha plants (contain) both kinds of food, for they are both water and
plants. Now the waters which, loathing V*ri*tra, rose up on the dry land
forming bushes, became those grasses <span
id="fr_635"></span>[1](#fn_633),--inasmuch as they rose forming bushes
(d*ri*bh), they are (called) darbha-grasses. These darbha-grasses, then,
are the water (which remained) pure, and meet for sacrifice, when
V*ri*tra flowed towards it; and inasmuch as they are darbha-grasses,
they are plants: by both kinds of food he thus gratifies him (Agni).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:3">7:2:3:3</span></span>3. \[He
places it\] at the meeting of the furrows, for the meeting of furrows is
speech (the mouth) <span id="fr_636"></span>[2](#fn_634), and the
furrows (channels) are the vital airs; and this is their place of
meeting; and in the mouth food is put for the vital airs. In the middle
(he places the bunch), whereby he puts it into the very

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

middle of him; silently (he does so), for what is silent is undefined,
and the undefined is everything: with everything he thus puts food into
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:4">7:2:3:4</span></span>4. He
then offers thereon,--when he (Agni) is built, he is born, and he is
born here for all (kinds of) food; but that ghee is the life-sap
(essence) of this universe, for it is the life-sap of both the waters
and plants: he thus gratifies him by the life-sap of this universe. And
as far as the life-sap extends, so far extends the body: he thus
gratifies him by this universe. With (ghee) taken in five (ladlings, he
offers),--the fire-altar consists of five layers, five seasons are a
year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:5">7:2:3:5</span></span>5. And,
again, why he offers thereon;--when in the beginning the *Ri*shis, the
vital airs <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_635), put together this
Agni, they gained for themselves that fore-share <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_636) in him: hence they are the fore-sharers.
Thus when he offers on (the grass-bush) he thereby gratifies those
Rishis, the vital airs, who gained for themselves the fore-share in him
(Agni). With fivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this
has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:6">7:2:3:6</span></span>6. And,
again, why he offers thereon;--whatever forms, whatever modes of
chanting, whatever p*ri*sh*th*a (stotras), whatever metres he is now
going to bestow on Agni, for them he prepares this fore-share, and it is
them he thereby gratifies. With

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

fivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this has been
explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:7">7:2:3:7</span></span>7. And,
again, why he offers thereon;--at that time the gods were afraid,
thinking, 'Long indeed is this performance: we hope the Rakshas, the
fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!' They saw this
preliminary conclusion <span id="fr_639"></span>[1](#fn_637) of this
performance, and brought that whole (Agni) to completion even at that
(point), and built him up then; and in like manner this (Sacrificer)
brings that whole (Agni) to completion even at this (point), and builds
him now.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:8">7:2:3:8</span></span>8.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 74\] 'The year,' this is a layer (of
bricks);--'together with the dark half-months,' this is a layer of
earth;--'the Dawn,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the
ruddy (cows),' this is a layer of earth;--'the two A*s*vins,' this is a
layer (of bricks); 'together with their wonderful deeds,' this is a
layer of earth;--'the Sun,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with
the dappled horse,' this is a layer of earth;--'(Agni) Vai*s*vânara,'
this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with I*d*â,' this is a layer of
earth;--'with ghee,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'Svâ-,' this is a
layer of earth;--'hâ!' this is a layer (of bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:3:9">7:2:3:9</span></span>9. There
are thirteen utterings,--thirteen months are a year; thirteen in number
are the layers of bricks and earth of the fire-altar: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. With
butter he sacrifices,--butter is the

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

same as Agni: it is Agni he thus builds up. With fivefold-taken (butter
he offers),--the altar consists of five layers,--five seasons are a
year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, so great he thus builds him up. He offers raising (the spoon)
upwards: he thus builds Agni upwards by means of the layers (of the
altar).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_633"></span>[332:1](sbe4159.htm#fr_635) The author here
alludes to the legend given at I, 1, 3, 4-5,--V*ri*tra lay enveloping
all that space which extends between heaven and earth, and because he
lay enveloping (v*ri*) all that, he is called V*ri*tra. Him Indra slew.
Being slain, he flowed stinking in all directions towards the water; for
in every direction lies the ocean. Now some of the water loathed him, it
rose higher and higher and flowed over: hence (sprang) these ku*s*a
grasses,--they are indeed the water which was not putrified; but with
the other water some (matter) has indeed become mixed when the putrid
V*ri*tra flowed into it.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[332:2](sbe4159.htm#fr_636) See [p.
200](sbe4134.htm#page_200), note [3](sbe4134.htm#fn_413).

<span id="fn_635"></span>[333:1](sbe4159.htm#fr_637) See [VI, 1, 1,
1](sbe4128.htm#6:1:1:1).

<span id="fn_636"></span>[333:2](sbe4159.htm#fr_638) Literally, a share
in front, in the first place, i.e. a preferential share, or fore-taste.
Being accented separately, 'purastât' here, however, forms no compound
with 'bhâga;' though it does in 'purastâdbhâga,' fore-sharer. Cf. Taitt.
S. V, 6, 4, 2.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[334:1](sbe4159.htm#fr_639) Literally, a
conclusion previously, or at the beginning of the performance.
