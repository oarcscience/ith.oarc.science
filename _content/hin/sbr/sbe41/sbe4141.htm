That water (used for working the clay) has been boiled by means of resin of the pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a tree (butea frondosa), just for the sake of firmness. And as to why (it is done) by pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a resin;--the pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a tree doubtless is Soma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and Soma is the moon, and that (moon) indeed is one of Agni's</p>

<p>forms: it is for the obtainment of that form of Agni (that pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a resin is used).</p>

X, 9, 1-3), 'Refreshing ye are, O waters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' To whatever deity a <I>Ri</I>k-verse, and to whatever deity a Ya<I>g</I>us formula applies, that <I>Ri</I>k-verse is that very deity, and that Ya<I>g</I>us formula is that very deity: hence this triplet (XI, 50-52) is these waters, and they are those very waters which appeared as one form&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: that form he now makes it.</p>

He then produces foam and puts it thereto: the second form which was created (in the shape of) foam&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that form he thus makes it. And the clay he now mixes is that very clay which was created as the third form. It was from these forms that he (Agni) was created at the beginning, and from them he now produces him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:1:4">6:5:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then mixes it with the goat's hair, just for the sake of firmness. And as to why with goat's hair,--the gods then collected him (Agni) from out of the cattle, and in like manner does this one now collect him from out of the cattle. And as to why with goat's hair, it is because in the he-goat (is contained) the form of all cattle; and as to its being hair, form is hair&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

Then there are these three kinds of powder (dust)--(sand of) gravel, stone, and iron-rust--therewith he mixes (the clay), just for firmness. And as to why (it is mixed) therewith, it is because thereof this (earth) consisted when it was created in the beginning: thus whatlike this (earth) was created in the beginning, such he now makes it (the earth, or fire-pan).</p>

XI, 54] 'The Rudras, having mixed the earth, kindled the great light;'--for this Agni is yonder sun: thus it is that great light which the Rudras, having mixed the earth, did kindle;--'yea, never-failing and brilliant, their light shineth among the gods;'--for that never-failing and brilliant light of theirs does indeed shine among the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:5:1:8">6:5:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. With two (verses) he mixes (the clay),--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and the Sacrificer is Agni as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus mixes (fashions) him.</p>

XI, 55), 'Mixed by the Vasus, the Rudras,'--for this (clay) has indeed been mixed both by the Vasus and the Rudras: by the Vasus, because by Mitra and by the Rudras, because by the Rudras;--'by the wise, the clay suitable for the work;'--for wise those (gods) are, and suitable for the (sacred) work is this clay;--'making it soft with her hands, may Sin&icirc;val&icirc; fashion it!'--Sin&icirc;val&icirc; doubtless is speech: thus, 'May she, having made it soft with her hands, fashion it!'</p>

XI, 56] 'Sin&icirc;val&icirc;, the fair-knotted, fair-braided, fair-locked,'--for Sin&icirc;val&icirc; is a woman, and that is indeed the perfect form of woman, to wit, the fair-knotted, fair-braided, fair-locked: he thus makes her perfect;--'may she place the fire-pan into thy hands, O great Aditi!'--the great Aditi doubtless is this earth: it is to this earth that he says this.</p>

XI, 57] 'Let Aditi fashion the fire-pan, by her skill, her arms, her wisdom!'--for by her skill, by her arms, and by her wisdom she does indeed fashion it;--'may she bear Agni in her womb, even as a mother (bears) her son in her lap!'--that is, 'as a mother would bear her son in her lap, so may she (Aditi) bear Agni in her womb!'</p>

With three (formulas) he kneads (the clay),--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus kneads him. With two (verses) he mixes,--that makes five;--of five layers consists the fire-altar (Agni); five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. With three (formulas) he pours water thereto,--that makes eight;--of eight syllables the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre consists, and Agni is G&acirc;yatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. And, moreover, as one of eight syllables&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> this (earth) was created in the beginning: thus as great as this (earth) was created in the beginning, so great he thus makes this (fire-pan representing the earth).</p>
