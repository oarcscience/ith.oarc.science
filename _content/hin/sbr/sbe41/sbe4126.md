#### THE SAUTRÂMA*N*Î.

### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:1">5:5:4:1</span></span>1. There
is a reddish-white (he-goat as the victim) for the A*s*vins <span
id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_254), for the A*s*vins are reddish-white.
There is an ewe with teats in the dewlap <span
id="fr_255"></span>[2](#fn_255) for Sarasvatî; and a bull he seizes for
Indra Sutrâman (the good protector) <span
id="fr_256"></span>[3](#fn_256). Difficult to obtain are beasts with
such perfections; if he cannot obtain any

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

with such perfections, they may slaughter only goats, for they are
easier to cook. And if they seize only goats, that for the A*s*vins is a
red one. Then as to why he performs this sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:2">5:5:4:2</span></span>2. Now
Tvash*tri* had a three-headed, six-eyed son <span
id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_257). He had three mouths; and because he was
thus shapen, he was called Vi*s*varûpa ('All-shape').

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:3">5:5:4:3</span></span>3. One of
his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other
food. Indra hated him, and cut off those heads of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:4">5:5:4:4</span></span>4. And
from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock sprang forth; whence
the latter is of brownish colour, for king Soma is brown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:5">5:5:4:5</span></span>5. And
from the one which was spirit-drinking, a sparrow sprang; whence the
latter talks like one who is joyful, for when one has drunk spirits, one
talks as one who enjoys himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:6">5:5:4:6</span></span>6. And
from the one which was for other (kinds of) food, a partridge sprang;
whence the latter is exceedingly variegated: ghee drops indeed have, as
it were, dropped on his wings in one place, and honey-drops, as it were,
in another; for suchlike was the-food he consumed with that (mouth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:7">5:5:4:7</span></span>7.
Tvash*tri* was furious: 'Has he really slain my son?' He brought Soma
juice withheld from Indra <span id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_258); and as
that Soma-juice was, when produced, even so it remained withheld from
Indra.

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:8">5:5:4:8</span></span>8. Indra
thought within himself: 'There now, they are excluding me from Soma!'
and even uninvited he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, as
the stronger (would consume the food) of the weaker. But it hurt him: it
flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; only
from his mouth it did not flow. Hence there was an atonement; but had it
flown also from his mouth, then indeed there would have been no
atonement.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:9">5:5:4:9</span></span>9. For
there are four castes, the Brâhma*n*a, the Râ*g*anya, the Vai*s*ya, and
the *S*ûdra; but there is not one of them that vomits Soma; but were
there any one of them, then indeed there would be atonement.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:10">5:5:4:10</span></span>10.
From what flowed from the nose a lion sprang; and from what flowed from
the ears a wolf sprang; and from what flowed from the lower opening wild
beasts sprang, with the tiger as their foremost; and what flowed from
the upper opening that was the foaming spirit (parisrut). And thrice he
spit out: thence were produced the (fruits called) 'kuvala, karkandhu,
or badara <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_259).' He (Indra) became
emptied out of everything, for Soma is everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:11">5:5:4:11</span></span>11.
Being thus purged by Soma, he walked about as one tottering. The
A*s*vins cured him by this (offering), and caused him to be supplied
with everything, for Soma is everything. By offering he indeed became
better.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:12">5:5:4:12</span></span>12. The
gods spake, 'Aha! these two have saved him <span
id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_260), the well-saved (sutrâta):' hence the
name Sautrâma*n*î.

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:13">5:5:4:13</span></span>13. Let
him also cure by this (ceremony) one purged by Soma;--he whom Soma
purges is indeed emptied out of everything, for Soma is everything. He
now causes him to be supplied with everything, for Soma is everything;
and by offering he indeed becomes better: let him therefore cure thereby
also one purged by Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:14">5:5:4:14</span></span>14. And
as to why the performer of the Râ*g*asûya performs this offering. He who
performs the Râ*g*asûya assuredly gains for himself all sacrificial
rites, all offerings, even the spoonful-oblations; and instituted by the
gods indeed is this offering, the Sautrâma*n*î: 'May offering be made by
me with this one also! may I be consecrated by this one also!' thus (he
thinks, and) therefore the performer of the Râ*g*asûya performs this
offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:15">5:5:4:15</span></span>15. And
as to why there is (a victim) for the A*s*vins,--it was the A*s*vins who
cured him; and in like manner does he (the priest) now cure him through
those same A*s*vins: that is why there is (a victim) for the A*s*vins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:16">5:5:4:16</span></span>16. And
why there is one for Sarasvatî,--Sarasvatî assuredly is speech, and it
was by speech that the A*s*vins cured him; and in like manner does he
now cure him by speech: that is why there is one for Sarasvatî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:17">5:5:4:17</span></span>17. And
why there is one for Indra,--Indra assuredly is the deity of the
sacrifice, and it is by this (offering) that he now heals him: this is
why there is one for Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:18">5:5:4:18</span></span>18. On
(the meat-portions of) those victims he throws hairs of a lion, hairs of
a wolf, and hairs of a tiger, for that was what sprang therefrom, when
Soma flowed right through him. He now supplies

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

him therewith, and makes him whole: therefore he throws those (hairs)
thereon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:19">5:5:4:19</span></span>19. But
let him not do it so; for he who throws them on the (portions of) the
victims, urges the animals on from behind with a clawed (prickly)
fire-brand. Let him therefore rather throw them into the fermented
liquor (parisrut <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261)),--thus he does
not urge on the animals from behind with a clawed fire-brand; and thus
alone he supplies him therewith, and makes him whole: let him therefore
throw it rather into the spirituous liquor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:20">5:5:4:20</span></span>20. Now
on the day before, he mixes the spirituous liquor (while muttering,
Vâ*g*. S. X, 30, 'Get done for the A*s*vins! get done for Sarasvatî! get
done for Indra, the good protector!' When that liquor is (done) he
proceeds with that (offering).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:21">5:5:4:21</span></span>21.
They take up two fires; on the northern altar <span
id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262) (they lay down) the northern (fire), and
on a raised (mound) the southern one, thinking, 'Lest we should offer
together the Soma-libations, and the Surâ (liquor) -libations:'
therefore they take up two fires, and on the northern altar (they lay
down) the northern (fire), and on a raised (mound) the southern one. And
when he proceeds with the omenta, then he proceeds with that spirituous
liquor.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:22">5:5:4:22</span></span>22. He
purifies it with stalks of Darbha-grass, thinking, 'Let it be
pure,'--with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 31), 'The inviting <span
id="fr_263"></span>[3](#fn_263) Soma, purified by the purifying

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (strainer), has
overflown backwards, Indra's mated friend.' He then pours in flour of
'kuvala, karkandhu, and badara' berries, for when he (Indra) spit out
thrice, that was what was produced therefrom: therewith he now supplies
him and makes him whole,--therefore he pours in that (flour).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:23">5:5:4:23</span></span>23. He
then draws either one or three cups <span
id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_264),--but only one should be drawn, for
there is one puroru*k*-formula, one invitatory prayer, and one offering
prayer; therefore only one (cup) should be drawn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:24">5:5:4:24</span></span>24. He
draws it with (Vâ*g*. S. X, 32), 'Yea, even as the owners of barley cut
their barley, spreading it asunder in due order, so hither, hither,
bring thou the nourishments of them that offer up the devotional
invocation of the Barhis <span id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_265)!--Thou
art taken with a support--thee for the A*s*vins, thee for Sarasvatî,
thee for Indra, the good protector!' And if he draw three (cups), let
him draw them with that same (verse); but let him in that case draw them
with separate 'supports <span id="fr_266"></span>[3](#fn_266).' He then
says, 'Recite the

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

invitatory prayer to the A*s*vins, to Sarasvatî, and to Indra Sutrâman!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:25">5:5:4:25</span></span>25. He
recites (Vâ*g*. S. X, 33; *Ri*k S. X, 131, 4), 'Ye, O A*s*vins, lords of
splendour, having quaffed the cheering (Soma) together with Namu*k*i,
the Âsura, helped Indra in his deeds!' Having called for the
[*S*rausha*t*](errata.htm#11), he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer
to the A*s*vins, to Sarasvatî, and to Indra Sutrâman!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:26">5:5:4:26</span></span>26. He
prays (Vâ*g*. S. X, 34; *Ri*k S. X, 131, 5), 'As the parents (stand by)
their son, so the two A*s*vins have stood by thee, O Indra, with wise
plans and wonderful deeds; when thou quaffedst the cheering (Soma),
Sarasvatî cured thee, O Lord, by her services.' Twice the Hot*ri* utters
the Vasha*t*, twice the Adhvaryu offers and fetches drink. And if he
draw three (cups of liquor), then after the offering of that one the
other two are offered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:27">5:5:4:27</span></span>27. Now
there is a pitcher perforated either with a hundred, or with nine,
holes. If it is one with a hundred holes,--man lives up to a hundred
(years), and has a hundred energies, and a hundred powers: therefore it
is perforated with a hundred holes. And if with nine holes,--there are
in man those nine vital airs: therefore it is perforated with nine
holes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:28">5:5:4:28</span></span>28.
This (pitcher), hung up by a sling, they hold just over the
Âhavanîya <span id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_267). He pours into it what
spirituous liquor has been left over, and whilst it is

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

trickling through, he stands by worshipping with the three verses <span
id="fr_268"></span>[1](#fn_268) of the Pitara*h* Somavanta*h* (the
Fathers accompanied by Soma), with three verses of the Pitaro
Barishada*h* (the Fathers seated on the barhis), and with three verses
of the Pitaro Agnishvâttâ*h* (the Fathers consumed by the fire). And as
to why he thus stands by worshipping,--when Soma flowed through Indra,
what part of it then went to the Fathers--there being three kinds of
Fathers--therewith he now supplies him and makes him whole: therefore he
thus stands by worshipping.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:29">5:5:4:29</span></span>29. He
then prepares those oblations <span id="fr_269"></span>[2](#fn_269),--a
cake on twelve or eight potsherds for Savit*ri*, a barley pap for
Varu*n*a, and a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:30">5:5:4:30</span></span>30. And
why there is one for Savit*ri*,--Savit*ri* is the impeller of the gods,
and impelled by Savit*ri* he now heals <span
id="fr_270"></span>[3](#fn_270): therefore there is one for Savit*ri*.

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:31">5:5:4:31</span></span>31. And
why there is one for Varu*n*a,--Varu*n*a is the injurer, and he thus
heals him even by him who is the injurer: therefore there is one for
Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:32">5:5:4:32</span></span>32. And
why there is one for Indra,--Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and he
thus heals him by him who is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore there
is one for Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:33">5:5:4:33</span></span>33. And
if by that (Sautrâma*n*î-offering) he would heal one purged by
Soma <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_271), then--(after) the
after-offering (of the animal sacrifice) has been performed, and the two
spoons separated--he proceeds with those (three) oblations <span
id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_272). For it is towards the back part that
Soma flows through, and at the back part (of the sacrifice) he thus
closes him up by that sacrificial essence. Let him in that case prepare
a cake on two potsherds for the A*s*vins; and when he proceeds with the
offering of the omenta, then he also proceeds with that two-kapâla cake
for the A*s*vins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:34">5:5:4:34</span></span>34. Let
him, however, not do it in this way; for verily whosoever departs from
the path of the sacrifice stumbles, and he who does this indeed departs
from the path of the sacrifice. Hence at the very time when they proceed
with the omenta of those victims, let them then proceed also with those
(three) oblations, and let him not then prepare a two-kapâla cake for
the A*s*vins.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:5:4:35">5:5:4:35</span></span>35. A
castrated bull is the sacrificial fee for this

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (sacrifice);--the
castrated bull is neither female nor male; for being a male it is not a
female, and being a female (unmanned) it is not a male: therefore a
castrated bull is the fee. Or a draught-mare;--the draught-mare is
neither male nor female; for in that it pulls the cart it is not a
female; and being a female, it is not a male: therefore a draught-mare
(may be) the fee.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_254"></span>[129:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_254) The last three
Soma-sacrifices of the Inauguration-ceremony are not even alluded to by
the author, their performance involving no features different from those
of the normal Soma-sacrifice. The Vyush*t*i-dvirâtra, or 'two nights’
ceremony of the dawn,' consists of an Agnish*t*oma and an Atirâtra
Soma-sacrifice, to be performed a month after the Ke*s*avapanîya (or,
according to Taitt. Br. I, 8, 10, a fortnight after, viz. on the
new-moon, and the first day of the light fortnight respectively).
Finally, the Kshatra-dh*ri*ti, or 'wielding of the ruling-power,' an
Agnish*t*oma, is performed a month later, or on the full-moon of
*S*râva*n*a (about 1 August). Some authorities, however, allow the
Soma-sacrifices of the Inauguration-ceremony to conclude with the
Ke*s*avapanîya Atirâtra (Kâty. *S*r. XV, 9, 26), perhaps for the very
reason that no mention is made in the Brâhma*n*a of the remaining three
Soma-days. The final Soma-sacrifice is followed, in the succeeding
fortnight of the waxing moon, by the performance of the Sautrâma*n*î,
some peculiar features of which the author now proceeds to consider.
This ceremony (one of the objects of which is the expiation of any
excess committed in the consumption of Soma-juice) is considered in the
sacrificial system as the last of the seven forms of Havirya*gñ*a; being
a combination of the ish*t*i with the animal sacrifice. As this ceremony
is also performed after the Agni*k*ayana, or construction of the
fire-altar, it is more fully dealt with by the author later on (Kâ*nd*a
XII, 7 seq.).

<span id="fn_255"></span>[129:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_255) Prof. R. Wallace's
'India in 1887' (plate 39) contains a photographic representation of an
Indian goat with pendicles like teats.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[129:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_256) In the case of the
'somâtipavita,' not the 'somavâmin,' the Taittirîyas slaughter a fourth
victim to B*ri*haspati.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[130:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_257) This portion of the
legend is but a repetition from I, 6, 3, 1 seq. A few alterations are,
however, made here in the translation.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[130:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_258) Or, 'Soma from
which Indra was excluded' (apendra), as formerly translated; a closer
rendering of the succeeding clause making this change desirable;--even
as Indra was excluded from the Soma-juice when produced, so he remained
excluded from it (when it was offered up).

<span id="fn_259"></span>[131:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_259) The berries of
three different species of the Zizyphus jujuba, or jujube-tree.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[131:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_260) The MS. of
Sâya*n*a's commentary reads 'atrâsâtâm.'

<span id="fn_261"></span>[133:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_261) On the preparation
of the parisrut or surâ, see XII, 7; Weber, Ind. Studien, X, p 349.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[133:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_262) The two new
fireplaces, to the east of the Âhavanîya, are to be constructed on the
model of those of the Varu*n*apraghâsâ*h*, see part i, p. 392.

<span id="fn_263"></span>[133:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_263) This doubtful
interpretation of 'vâyu' is adopted from the St. <span id="page_134">p.
134</span> Petersburg dictionary, where, however, it is only applied to
two passages of the Rig-veda. Sâya*n*a here explains it by 'pâtrâ*n*i
ga*kkh*an vâyuva*k* *kh*îgragâmî vâ bhûtvâ pratyaṅ adhovartî
pâtrâbhimukha*h* san.' In the Taitt. S. this verse is. preceded by
another (*Ri*k S. IX, 1, 6), 'May Sûrya's daughter purify thy foaming
(parisrut) Soma with the never-failing horse-tail (strainer).'

<span id="fn_264"></span>[134:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_264) According to the
ritual of the Taittirîyas, three cups of Surâ are drawn.

<span id="fn_265"></span>[134:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_265) *Ri*k S. X, 131, 2,
and Taitt. S. I, 8, 21 read--'hither, hither bring the nourishments of
them that have not gone to the devotional up-pulling (cutting) of the
barhis-grass' (but differently Sâya*n*a,--'that have not gone to the
neglect of the devotion of the barhis').

<span id="fn_266"></span>[134:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_266) That is to say, he
is to repeat the formula, 'Thou art taken <span id="page_135">p.
135</span> with a support,' each time followed by a special dedication,
'thee for the A*s*vins!' &c.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[135:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_267) That is, over the
southern one of the two new fires, the one laid down on a raised mound.

<span id="fn_268"></span>[136:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_268) These triplets to
the Fathers are given Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 49-51; 55-57; 58-60.--The Taitt.
ritual here has a curious variation. After the remainder of the (pure)
liquor has been offered to the Fathers, a Brâhman is to be bought over
to drink the dregs; and if such an one cannot be found (willing to do
it), they are to be poured away on an ant-hill. This is to be done for
the sake of atonement.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[136:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_269) That is, according
to Kâtyâyana (XV, 10, 19) and Sâya*n*a, the pa*s*u-puro*d*â*s*a, or
cakes of the animal offering. The performance of these is irregular,
inasmuch as their deities are not the same as those of the animal
sacrifice (the A*s*vins, Sarasvatî, and Indra Sutrâman). Taitt. Br. I,
8, 6, 1, however, explains that in this case the animal sacrifices are
without 'animal cakes,' the libations of liquor, which indeed are
offered to the same deities, being in lieu of them.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[136:3](sbe4126.htm#fr_270) The object of the
Sautrâma*n*î offering is to heal or 'make whole' the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_271"></span>[137:1](sbe4126.htm#fr_271) That is to say, if
it is performed, independently of the Râ*g*asûya, as a special offering
with a view to expiating any excess committed at a Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[137:2](sbe4126.htm#fr_272) A glance at the
list of contents prefixed to part ii will show how this shifting of the
Pa*s*u-puro*d*â*s*a would alter the regular order of procedure.
