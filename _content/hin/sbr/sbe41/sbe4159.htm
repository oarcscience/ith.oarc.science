He then places a bunch of darbha (ku<I>s</I>a) grass (poa cynosuroides) on (the middle of the altar-site); for the gods then placed plants thereon, and in like manner does the Sacrificer now place plants thereon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:2:3:2">7:2:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. And, again, why he places a bunch of grass thereon;--when he (Agni) is built up, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but these darbha plants (contain) both kinds of food, for they are both water and plants. Now the waters which, loathing V<I>ri</I>tra, rose up on the dry land forming bushes, became those grasses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_633"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--inasmuch as they rose forming bushes (d<I>ri</I>bh), they are (called) darbha-grasses. These darbha-grasses, then, are the water (which remained) pure, and meet for sacrifice, when V<I>ri</I>tra flowed towards it; and inasmuch as they are darbha-grasses, they are plants: by both kinds of food he thus gratifies him (Agni).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:2:3:3">7:2:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. [He places it] at the meeting of the furrows, for the meeting of furrows is speech (the mouth)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_634"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the furrows (channels) are the vital airs; and this is their place of meeting; and in the mouth food is put for the vital airs. In the middle (he places the bunch), whereby he puts it into the very</p>

<p>middle of him; silently (he does so), for what is silent is undefined, and the undefined is everything: with everything he thus puts food into him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:2:3:4">7:2:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. He then offers thereon,--when he (Agni) is built, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but that ghee is the life-sap (essence) of this universe, for it is the life-sap of both the waters and plants: he thus gratifies him by the life-sap of this universe. And as far as the life-sap extends, so far extends the body: he thus gratifies him by this universe. With (ghee) taken in five (ladlings, he offers),--the fire-altar consists of five layers, five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus gratifies him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:2:3:5">7:2:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. And, again, why he offers thereon;--when in the beginning the <I>Ri</I>shis, the vital airs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, put together this Agni, they gained for themselves that fore-share&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> in him: hence they are the fore-sharers. Thus when he offers on (the grass-bush) he thereby gratifies those Rishis, the vital airs, who gained for themselves the fore-share in him (Agni). With fivefold-taken ghee (he offers): the significance of this has been explained.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:2:3:6">7:2:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. And, again, why he offers thereon;--whatever forms, whatever modes of chanting, whatever p<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a (stotras), whatever metres he is now going to bestow on Agni, for them he prepares this fore-share, and it is them he thereby gratifies.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="7:2:3:7">7:2:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. And, again, why he offers thereon;--at that time the gods were afraid, thinking, 'Long indeed is this performance: we hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!' They saw this preliminary conclusion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of this performance, and brought that whole (Agni) to completion even at that (point), and built him up then; and in like manner this (Sacrificer) brings that whole (Agni) to completion even at this (point), and builds him now.</p>

XII, 74] 'The year,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the dark half-months,' this is a layer of earth;--'the Dawn,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the ruddy (cows),' this is a layer of earth;--'the two A<I>s</I>vins,' this is a layer (of bricks); 'together with their wonderful deeds,' this is a layer of earth;--'the Sun,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with the dappled horse,' this is a layer of earth;--'(Agni) Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'together with I<I>d</I>&acirc;,' this is a layer of earth;--'with ghee,' this is a layer (of bricks);--'Sv&acirc;-,' this is a layer of earth;--'h&acirc;!' this is a layer (of bricks).</p>

There are thirteen utterings,--thirteen months are a year; thirteen in number are the layers of bricks and earth of the fire-altar: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. With butter he sacrifices,--butter is the</p>

<p>same as Agni: it is Agni he thus builds up. With fivefold-taken (butter he offers),--the altar consists of five layers,--five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus builds him up. He offers raising (the spoon) upwards: he thus builds Agni upwards by means of the layers (of the altar).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_633"></A><A HREF="sbe4159.htm#fr_635">332:1</A> The author here alludes to the legend given at I, 1, 3, 4-5,--V<I>ri</I>tra lay enveloping all that space which extends between heaven and earth, and because he lay enveloping (v<I>ri</I>) all that, he is called V<I>ri</I>tra. Him Indra slew. Being slain, he flowed stinking in all directions towards the water; for in every direction lies the ocean. Now some of the water loathed him, it rose higher and higher and flowed over: hence (sprang) these ku<I>s</I>a grasses,--they are indeed the water which was not putrified; but with the other water some (matter) has indeed become mixed when the putrid V<I>ri</I>tra flowed into it.</P>
