Standing he puts on that (gold plate)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--for that gold plate is yonder sun, and yonder sun stands, as it were; and moreover, while standing one is stronger.

Now some, after addressing him by that fashioning (formula), build a different altar (than of an eagle's shape), either one constructed in the form of a trough&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or like a chariot-wheel, or like a kite, or like the front part of a thill, or like a thill on both sides, or one consisting of a heap of loose soil&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Let him not do so, (but) in such wise as one might carve a young one with wings and tail: let him therefore build it (the fire-altar) in the form of an eagle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:7:2:9">6:7:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. With that fashioning (formula) he holds him high up from thence towards east&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; for he, Agni, is yonder sun: he thus places yonder sun high up from here in the east; and hence yonder sun is placed high up from here in the east. He holds him up so as to be beyond the reach of the arms, for he (the sun) is beyond the reach of the arms from here. He then lowers him, and, having lowered him, he holds him above the navel: the significance of this has been explained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

For the gods, in the form of Vish<I>n</I>u (the sun), then strode through these worlds; and inasmuch as, in the form of Vish<I>n</I>u, they thus strode, they are called the Vish<I>n</I>u-strides: in like manner does the Sacrificer,</p>

Now he who is Vish<I>n</I>u is this sacrifice; and he who is this sacrifice is that same Agni in the ukh&acirc; (fire-pan): into that same (Agni) the gods changed themselves, and strode through these worlds; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having changed himself into that same (Agni), strides through these worlds.</p>
