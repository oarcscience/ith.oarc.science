There is either a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, or a rice-pap for Soma: this he places on the southern part. There is a pap for the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I> (All-gods): this he places on the western part. There is a dish of curds for Mitra-Varu<I>n</I>a: this he places on the north part.

This is the five-holed pap&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--what five sacrificial dishes (havis) there are, for them there are five holes: hence the name 'five-holed pap.'</p>

But were the performer of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya not to perform this offering, then verily he would become intoxicated (with pride)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and would fall down headlong: that is why the performer of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya performs this offering.</p>

And what cake on eleven potsherds there is for Indra, the fee for that is a bull, for the bull is Indra. And if there be a pap for Soma, then the fee for that is a brown ox, for the brown one is sacred to Soma. He gives it to the Brahman, for the Brahman guards the sacrifice from the south: therefore he gives it to the Brahman.</p>

He gives it to the Hot<I>ri</I>, for the Hot<I>ri</I> means abundance: therefore he gives it to the Hot<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:5:1:11">5:5:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. And what dish of curds there is for Mitra-Varu<I>n</I>a, the fee for that is a sterile cow, for that one is sacred to Mitra-Varu<I>n</I>a. If he cannot procure a sterile cow, any unimpregnated one will do; for every sterile cow is indeed unimpregnated. He gives it to the two Adhvaryus; for the Adhvaryus are the out-breathing and the in-breathing, and the out-breathing and in-breathing are Mitra-Varu<I>n</I>a: therefore he gives it to the two Adhvaryus.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_236"></A><A HREF="sbe4123.htm#fr_236">120:1</A> According to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a (MS. I. O. 657) the term 'Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>abila' is derived from the circumstance that the vessel (p&acirc;tr&icirc;) on which the five sacrificial dishes are placed when taken about to be 'deposited' on the vedi, contains five holes or openings for the dishes to be taken out. The Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>abila oblations are to be performed during the light fortnight succeeding the performance of the Da<I>s</I>apeya,--that is to say, during the fortnight commencing with the new moon of Vai<I>s</I>&acirc;kha, or in the latter part of April. The Taittir&icirc;ya ceremonial calls these oblations the 'Di<I>s</I>&acirc;m avesh<I>t</I>aya<I>h</I>,' i.e. 'Sacrifices performed for the appeasement of the regions.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_237"></A><A HREF="sbe4123.htm#fr_237">120:2</A> Or, would become giddy (in flying through space), cf. Taitt. Br. I, 8, 3, 1.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_240"></A><A HREF="sbe4123.htm#fr_240">122:2</A> That is, the region of light, of the sun. See <a href="sbe4113.htm#5:3:1:2">V, 3, 1, 2</A> with note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_241"></A><A HREF="sbe4123.htm#fr_241">123:1</A> The meaning of this compound is unknown. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains it as meaning 'one who does not move from one spot, one who always remains in one and the same place.' Hence the St. Petersburg dictionary conjectures: 'One whose herd (or cattle-pen, vra<I>g</I>a, vr&acirc;<I>g</I>a) is stationary.' Similarly, Prof. Weber, in B&ouml;htlingk's Dictionary. See, however, the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va reading above, <A HREF="sbe4111.htm#page_50">p. 50</A>, note <A HREF="sbe4111.htm#fn_115">1</A>, according to which the word would seem to mean one afflicted with a certain malady (? cholera or dysentery). The 'Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>abila' offering may be performed as a special ish<I>t</I>i, independently of the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya.</P>
