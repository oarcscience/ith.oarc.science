#### PREPARATION OF THE SITE OF THE GREAT (ÂHAVANÎYA) ALTAR.

### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:1">7:2:2:1</span></span>1. He
then prepares the Prâya*n*îya <span id="fr_617"></span>[2](#fn_615)
(opening sacrifice). With the Havishk*ri*t of that (oblation) he
releases (the Sacrificer's) speech <span
id="fr_618"></span>[3](#fn_616). Having released his speech, he throws
away the grass-bush (stambaya*g*us <span
id="fr_619"></span>[4](#fn_617)). Having thrown away the grass-bush, and
drawn the first line of enclosure <span id="fr_620"></span>[5](#fn_618),
and the lines (across the mahâ-vedi), he says, 'Throw thrice!' and the
Âgnîdhra throws thrice (the wooden sword) <span
id="fr_621"></span>[6](#fn_619).[](errata.htm#15)

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:2">7:2:2:2</span></span>2. Having
returned (to the offering, or hall-door

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

fire) he proceeds with the opening sacrifice. Having performed the
opening sacrifice, he yokes a plough. For the gods at that time, being
about to heal him (Agni-Pra*g*âpati), first supplied him with food, and
in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now that he is about to heal him,
first supply him with food. It (the food) is the plough (sîra), for
'sîra' is the same as 'sera <span id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_620):' he
thus puts food into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:3">7:2:2:3</span></span>3. It is
made of udumbara (ficus glomerata) wood,--the Udumbara tree being
sustenance, life-sap: he thus supplies him with sustenance, with
life-sap. The cordage of the plough consists of mu*ñg*a grass, triply
twisted: the significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:4">7:2:2:4</span></span>4.
Standing behind the right (southern) hip of Agni (the site of the
fire-altar) he (the Pratiprasthât*ri*) addresses it (the plough) while
being yoked (by the Adhvaryu) in front of the left (northern) shoulder,
with (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 67, 68; *Ri*k S. X, 101, 4, 3), 'The skilful
yoke <span id="fr_623"></span>[2](#fn_621) the ploughs, and stretch
across the yokes,'--the skilful are those who know, and they do yoke the
plough and stretch the yokes across;--'the wise, with mind devoted to
the gods,'--devotion means sacrifice: thus, 'the wise, performing
sacrifice to the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:5">7:2:2:5</span></span>5. 'Yoke
ye the ploughs, and stretch across the yokes!'--they indeed yoke the
plough, and stretch the yokes across;--'into the ready womb here cast ye
the seed!' it is for the seed that that womb, the furrow, is made; and
if one casts

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (seed) into
unploughed (ground), it is just as if one were to shed seed elsewhere
than into the womb. 'And plentiful yield <span
id="fr_624"></span>[1](#fn_622) be there through our song!'--the song is
speech, and yield means food;--'and let the ripe crop go anigh the
sickle!' for when food gets ripe, people approach it with the sickle.
With two (verses) he yokes, a Gâyatrî and a Trish*t*ubh one: the
significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:6">7:2:2:6</span></span>6. He
yokes the right (ox) first, then the left one: thus it is (done) with
the gods, differently in human (practice). It is a team of six oxen, or
one of twelve oxen, or one of twenty-four oxen: it is the year (he
obtains) as the consummation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:7">7:2:2:7</span></span>7. He
then ploughs through it,--ploughing means food; and the gods at that
time when they were about to heal him (Agni-Pra*g*âpati) first put food
into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now when he is about
to heal him, first put food into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:8">7:2:2:8</span></span>8. Only
the body (of the altar-site) he ploughs through, not the wings and tail:
he thus puts food into the body. And, indeed, the food which is put into
the body benefits the body as well as the wings and tail; but that which
(is put) into the wings and tail does not benefit either the body or the
wings and tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:9">7:2:2:9</span></span>9. On the
right (south) side of the fire-altar, he ploughs first a furrow
eastwards <span id="fr_625"></span>[2](#fn_623) inside the
enclosing-stones, with (Vâr. S. XII, 69; *Ri*k S. IV, 57, 8), 'Right
luckily may the plough-shares plough up the ground, luckily the tillers
ply with their

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

oxen!'--'luckily--luckily,' he says, 'for what is successful that is
lucky:' he thus makes it (the furrow) successful.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:10">7:2:2:10</span></span>10.
Then on the hindpart (he ploughs a furrow) northwards <span
id="fr_626"></span>[1](#fn_624), with (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 70), 'With sweet
ghee let the furrow be saturated,'--as the text so its
meaning;--'approved of by the All-gods, by the Maruts!' for both the
All-gods and the Maruts have power over the rain;--'sapful, and teeming
with milk,'--milk means life-sap: thus, 'teeming with life-sap and
food;'--'with milk, O furrow, turn thou unto us!' that is, 'with
life-sap, O furrow, turn thou unto us!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:11">7:2:2:11</span></span>11.
Then on the left (north) side (he ploughs a furrow) eastwards <span
id="fr_627"></span>[2](#fn_625), with (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 71), 'The
share-shod <span id="fr_628"></span>[3](#fn_626) plough,'--that is, 'the
plough abounding in wealth,'--'propitious, offering prospect for the
Soma-cup <span id="fr_629"></span>[4](#fn_627)'--for Soma is food;--'it
throweth up the cow, the sheep, the lusty wife, the swift-wheeled

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

waggon,' for all this the furrow throws up (yields).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:12">7:2:2:12</span></span>12.
Then on the forepart he ploughs a furrow) southwards <span
id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_628), with (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 72), 'Milk out, O
cow of plenty, their desire to Mitra, and to Varu*n*a, to Indra, to the
A*s*vins, to Pûshan, to creatures and plants!' husbandry is (beneficial)
to all deities: thus, 'Milk out for these deities all their
desires!'--He first ploughs thus (south-west to southeast), then thus
(south-west to north-west), then thus (north-west to north-east), then
thus (north-east to south-east): that is (sunwise), for thus it is with
the gods <span id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_629).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:13">7:2:2:13</span></span>13.
Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him
(Pra*g*âpati-Agni) what food there is in the four quarters; and that
with prayer,--true is the prayer, and true (manifest) are those
quarters.

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:14">7:2:2:14</span></span>14. He
then ploughs (again) through the body: he thereby puts into him what
food there is in the year. Silently (he does so), for what is silent is
undetermined, and the undetermined is everything: by means of everything
he thus puts food into him. He first ploughs thus (through the middle
from south to north), then thus (south-west to north-east), then thus
(east to west), then thus (north-west to south-east),--that is
sunwise <span id="fr_632"></span>[1](#fn_630), for thus it is with the
gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:15">7:2:2:15</span></span>15.
Three furrows he ploughs each time,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus puts food into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:16">7:2:2:16</span></span>16.
Twelve furrows he ploughs silently,--the year (consists of) twelve
months, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his
measure, by so much he thus puts food into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:17">7:2:2:17</span></span>17.
Both kinds (of furrows) amount to sixteen,--of sixteen parts Pra*g*âpati
consists, and Pra*g*âpati is Agni: he thus puts into him food
proportionate to his body. And, indeed, the food which is proportionate
to the body, satisfies, and does no harm; but that which is too much,
does harm, and that which is too little, does not satisfy.

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:18">7:2:2:18</span></span>18.
And, again, why he ploughs through him,--the gods being about to put him
(Pra*g*âpati) together, thereby in the first place put the vital airs
into him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), being about to put
him together, thereby in the first place put the vital airs into him.
They (the furrows) are lines, for these vital airs (move) in lines
(channels).

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:19">7:2:2:19</span></span>19.
Four furrows he ploughs with prayer: he thereby puts into him those four
well-defined vital airs which are in the head; and this (he does) with
prayer,--true is the prayer, and true (manifest, real) are these vital
airs in the head.

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:20">7:2:2:20</span></span>20. And
as to why he ploughs through the body: he thereby puts into him those
vital airs which are inside the body. Silently (he does so), for who
knows how many vital airs there are inside the body?

<span class="margnote"><span id="7:2:2:21">7:2:2:21</span></span>21.
Having gained the object for which he yokes those (oxen), he now unyokes
them, with (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 73), 'Be ye unyoked, ye inviolable (oxen)!'
for inviolable <span id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_631) they indeed are
with the gods;--'Ye god ward-striding!' for with them he performs the
divine work;--'We have come to the end of this gloom;'--gloom doubtless
means famine: thus, 'we have come to the end of this famine;'--'we have
attained the light!' for he who attains the gods, the sacrifice, indeed
attains the light. He then lets them loose towards north-east--the
significance of this has been explained <span
id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_632). He gives them to the Adhvaryu, for it
is he that does the work with them: let him assign them (to him) at the
time of (the presentation of) the Dakshi*n*âs.

seq.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[325:3](sbe4158.htm#fr_618) Viz. by calling out
three times 'Havishk*ri*t, come hither,' whereby the Adhvaryu summons
one of the priests, or maidservants, to assist in preparing the material
for offering. See part i, p. 27 seq.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[325:6](sbe4158.htm#fr_621) See part i, p. 55.
It must, however, be borne in mind that the passage here referred to
relates to the construction of the Vedi of an ordinary ish*t*i, whilst
in the present instance we have to do with a Mahâvedi, as prescribed for
Soma-sacrifices (cf. part ii, p. 111 seq., where, however, only a few
distinctive points are adverted to). The plan of the Mahâvedi, given at
the end of part ii, shows at the eastern end a square mound, the
so-called uttara-vedi, or higher, upper altar, on which the Âhavanîya,
or offering, fire is maintained. On a similar earth mound, but raised in
the centre of the square site (see [VII, 3, 1,
27](sbe4161.htm#7:3:1:27)), the Agni*k*ayana requires the erection of
the large brick fire-altar, the preparation of the site of which is
explained from the next paragraph.

<span id="fn_620"></span>[326:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_622) That is 'sa + irâ,'
with draught or food.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[326:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_623) Or rather, put (the
oxen) to the ploughs. Professor Ludwig takes 'sîrâ' in the sense of
'straps, traces,'--the skilful fasten the traces.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[327:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_624) Or, concession
(Erhörung).

<span id="fn_623"></span>[327:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_625) That is, from the
right thigh to the right shoulder (south-west to south-east).

<span id="fn_624"></span>[328:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_626) That is, from the
right thigh to the left thigh (south-west to north-west). Whilst the
first furrow was ploughed from the southwest to the south-east corner,
the present and two following furrows are ploughed 'sunwise' from
south-west to north-west, north-west to north-east, and north-east to
south-east respectively. We are not told in what manner the plough is to
be got back from the southeast to the south-west corner after the
ploughing of the first furrow, whether it is to be carried there, or to
be pulled back outside the enclosed square.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[328:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_627) That is, from the
left thigh to the left shoulder (north-west to north-east).

<span id="fn_626"></span>[328:3](sbe4158.htm#fr_628) Or, the metal-shod.
The author's reason for interpreting 'pavîravat' by 'rayimat' is not
clear.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[328:4](sbe4158.htm#fr_629) According to the
St. Petersburg dictionary, 'somapitsaru' is probably a corrupt form,
like the various readings 'somasatsaru' (Ath. S. III, 17, 3) and
'sumatitsaru' (Taitt. S. IV, 2, 5, 6 = 'moving up and down,' Sâya*n*a).
Cf. Vâsish*th*a Dharma*s*âstra (Bühler's translation, Sacred Books of
the East, vol. xiv, p. 13), where 'somapitsaru' <span id="page_329">p.
329</span> is explained in the text as meaning 'provided with a handle
(tsaru) for the Soma-drinker' (somapi). Also Indische Studien, XVII, p.
259, where Professor Weber proposes to divide the word 'somasatsaru'
into 'soma(n),' with thongs, and 'sa-tsaru,' with handle. If
'somapi-tsaru' really represent the constituent elements, 'tsaru,'
handle, may indeed be intended as having special reference to the handle
of the Soma-cup (*k*amasa); though 'somapi' could only be taken in the
sense of 'Soma-drinker,' and not in that of 'Soma-cup,' optionally
suggested by Mahîdhara.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[329:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_630) That is, from the
left to the right shoulder (north-east to southeast).

<span id="fn_629"></span>[329:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_631) Or, perhaps, thus
it goes to the gods; this tends godward. Whilst the last three furrows
are indeed ploughed 'sunwise' (east to south, &c.), the first furrow was
ploughed in the opposite direction (south-west to south-east). The
reason for this is that the whole performance is to take place in an
easterly direction, so as to tend towards the gods. Were he to start at
the south-east corner, and then plough right round, he would be moving
away from the gods, who are supposed to reside in the east.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[330:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_632) Here, again, the
sunwise motion of the plough only applies to the three last furrows (or
sets of furrows), which always move from left to right,--south-west to
north-east, east to west, northwest to south-east. The first set of
furrows--drawn from south to north, or along the 'cross-spine' (as
distinguished from the real, or easterly spine running from west to
east)--are apparently drawn in this way, in order to avoid the southerly
direction, as that would imply speedy death to the Sacrificer,--his
going to the Fathers, or deceased ancestors, who are supposed to reside
in the south. In drawing the furrows in the way they do, the priests not
only avoid that region, but at the very outset move away from it, and
thereby assure long life to the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[331:1](sbe4158.htm#fr_633) See part ii, p.
216, note 2, where 'aghnyâ' was used of cows.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[331:2](sbe4158.htm#fr_634) See [VI, 4, 4,
22](sbe4140.htm#6:4:4:22). The plough is put aside on the utkara (heap
of rubbish).
