Paramesh<I>th</I>in saw the fifth layer: Paramesh<I>th</I>in assuredly is its ancestry. And, verily, whosoever so knows that (spiritual) ancestry of the structures (layers of the fire-altar), his structures are indeed possessed of an ancestry, possessed of relations (or, of mystic significance, bandhu).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_381"></A><A HREF="sbe4133.htm#fr_381">186:5</A> The author here connects the causal verb '<I>k</I>etay' (to reflect) with '<I>k</I>i,' to pile, to build; or rather with '<I>k</I>itim ish,' to desire building (an altar).</P>

This first svayam-&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc; brick is laid down with the formula, 'May Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati settle thee!' See <a href="sbe4164.htm#7:4:2:6">VII, 4, 2, 6</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_384"></A><A HREF="sbe4133.htm#fr_384">187:3</A> A stalk of D&ucirc;rv&acirc; (D&ucirc;b) grass--Panicum (or Cynodon) dactylon, or Agrostis linearis--is laid upon the first naturally-perforated brick (which again lies on the man of gold) in such a way that the root lies upon it and the tops hanging down to the ground. 'Its flowers in the perfect state are among the loveliest objects in the vegetable world, and appear through a lens like minute rubies and emeralds in constant motion from the least breath of air. It is the sweetest and most nutritious pasture for cattle, and its usefulness, added to its beauty, induced the Hindus in the earliest ages to believe it was the mansion of a benevolent nymph.' Sir W. Jones, Works, vol. v, p. 78. Professor R. Wallace, in his 'India in 1887,' gives an excellent illustration of this famous grass. He remarks (p. 282) that it has a wonderful power of remaining green, being the grass of all Indian grasses which retains its succulence throughout the extreme heat of summer.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_386"></A><A HREF="sbe4133.htm#fr_386">188:1</A> This second naturally-perforated brick, representing the air, forms the centre of the third layer of the altar. See VIII, 3, 1, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_387"></A><A HREF="sbe4133.htm#fr_387">188:2</A> That is, the bricks marking the regions, or quarters (di<I>s</I>y&acirc;); five of these are laid down immediately after the self-perforated one, in the four directions from it, two of them being laid on the south.

They would seem to lie about a foot away from the central brick; but as no other special brick lies between them, they may on that account be considered as not separated from it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_389"></A><A HREF="sbe4133.htm#fr_389">188:4</A> The third svayam-&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc;, though considered as forming part of the fifth layer, is really laid on the top of it or rather on the 'puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti'--an additional pile of eight bricks laid over the central, g&acirc;rhapatya-like, portion of the fifth layer (cf. <a href="sbe4145.htm#6:6:1:14">VI, 6, 1, 14</A>, with note <font size="-1" color="green">*</font><A HREF="sbe4145.htm#fn_486">3</A><font size="-1" color="green">*</font>). It is laid down with the formula 'May the Most High settle thee!'--and on it the fire is subsequently placed. See VIII, 7, 3, 13 seq.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_391"></A><A HREF="sbe4133.htm#fr_391">189:2</A> The laying down of the last svayam-&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc; (together with the likewise perforated 'vikar<I>n</I>&icirc;') is immediately preceded by the filling up of the fifth layer with the 'space-filling' bricks, only one of which has the common formula pronounced over it.

The author now remarks on the two other layers, representing as it were the space between the three worlds.</P>
