The <I>K</I>arakas slaughter (a he-goat) for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, saying, 'Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, having built up the fire-altar (agni), became Agni.

It is a dark grey one; for the grey has two kinds of hair, the white and the black; and two make a productive pair: that is its Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-characteristic. It is a hornless one, for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is hornless.</p>

For this (animal sacrifice) there are twenty-one kindling-verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_347"></A><A HREF="#fn_347"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun,--that is the twenty-onefold Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:4">6:2:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. And, again, why there are twenty-one;--man (purusha) doubtless is twenty-onefold, ten fingers of the hand, ten toes, and the body (make) the twenty-onefold man Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.</p>

He recites both g&acirc;yatr&icirc; and trish<I>t</I>ubh verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The libation of ghee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_348"></A><A HREF="#fn_348"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he makes with the verse containing (the name) Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_349"></A><A HREF="#fn_349"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; for Hira<I>n</I>yagarbha.</p>

<p>is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni. There are twelve &Acirc;pr&icirc;-verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The animal cake belongs to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, for the relation of the victim is also that of the animal cake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_350"></A><A HREF="#fn_350"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. It is one on twelve potsherds: twelve months are a year, and the year is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. The offering and invitatory formulas contain the word 'Ka,' for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Ka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_351"></A><A HREF="#fn_351"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:6">6:2:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. He then slaughters for V&acirc;yu Niyutvat (the wind, driving a team of horses) that white, bearded (he-goat). When Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati had produced living beings, he looked about him, and from exceeding delight his seed fell: it became that white, hornless, bearded he-goat (a<I>g</I>a, 'unborn'); for seed is life-sap, and as far as there is life-sap, so far extends the self. And when he slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar). It is a white one, because seed is white. It is hornless, because seed is hornless. It belongs to V&acirc;yu, because V&acirc;yu (the wind) is the out-breathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams (niyut&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_352"></A><A HREF="#fn_352"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) are the in-breathing: the out-breathing and in-breathing he thus lays into him.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:7">6:2:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. And, again, why he slaughters that white, hornless (he-goat);--when the gods restored the relaxed Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, they, by means of this victim, put into him that out-breathing which had gone out of him; and in like mariner this one now puts it into him. It belongs to V&acirc;yu, because V&acirc;yu is the out-breathing; and to Niyutvat, because the teams are the in-breathing: he thus puts the out-breathing and in-breathing into him. It is white, because V&acirc;yu (the wind) is white; and it is hornless, because V&acirc;yu is hornless.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:8">6:2:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. For this (animal sacrifice) there are seventeen kindling-verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_353"></A><A HREF="#fn_353"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for the year is seventeenfold--there are twelve months and five seasons--Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:9">6:2:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. And, again, why there are seventeen,--man is seventeenfold,--there are ten vital airs, four limbs, the body the fifteenth, the neck-joints the sixteenth, and the head the seventeenth,--Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the Person (or man, purusha), and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus kindles him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:10">6:2:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. He recites both g&acirc;yatr&icirc; and trish<I>t</I>ubh verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. There are twelve &Acirc;pr&icirc;-verses: their significance has been told; and (what applies to) the order of the verses has been told. The animal cake belongs to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: 'Therein then that wish was obtained,'</p>

<p><A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> M&acirc;hitthi once said,--'which the <I>K</I>arak&acirc;s say is in the victim to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:11">6:2:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. And as to why the victim belongs to V&acirc;yu, and the animal cake to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati;--one half of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati doubtless is V&acirc;yu, and one half is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: thus, were they both to belong to V&acirc;yu, or both to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, then only one half of him (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) would be made up, and one half would not (be made up). But in that the victim belongs to V&acirc;yu, and the animal cake to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, thereby he puts together (restores) him, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, wholly and entirely.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:12">6:2:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. And, again, why the victim belongs to V&acirc;yu, and the animal cake to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati;--when the gods restored the relaxed Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, they, by means of this victim, put into him that out-breathing which had gone out of him; and by means of this cake they restored that body (trunk) of his. And as to why it belongs to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, it is because the body (self) is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; and (why it is) one on twelve potsherds,--twelve months are a year, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year. One of the offering prayers and one of the invitatory prayers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> contain (the word) 'ka,' for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Ka.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:13">6:2:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. Now when in the first place he offers the omentum, he thereby puts into him (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) that vital air which is here in front. And when they proceed with that (cake) in the middle, it is because this trunk is in the middle. And when they proceed thereafter with the (meat) oblation, he thereby puts into him that vital air which is behind. The (remaining) offering and invitatory prayers should contain the word 'bright,' with the view of the obtainment of bright forms; and the word 'niyut' (team), for the obtainment of that form which has a team&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_355"></A><A HREF="#fn_355"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:14">6:2:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. As to this they say, 'It is rather the two (prayers) of the Omentum that should contain (the word) "bright," for so far as the two (prayers) of the omentum containing (the word) "bright" extend, extends what is bright in the animal (sacrifice); and the two (prayers) of the (meat) oblation should contain (the word) "team," for the obtainment of that form of him (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) which has a team.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:15">6:2:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. And, again, why he slaughters this animal;--in this animal doubtless the form of all (the five kinds of) animals is (contained): inasmuch as it is hornless and bearded, that is the form of man, for man is hornless and bearded; inasmuch as it is hornless and furnished with a mane, that is the form of the horse, for the horse is hornless and furnished with a mane; inasmuch as it is eight-hoofed, that is the bull's form, for the bull is eight-hoofed; inasmuch as its hoofs are like those of the sheep, that is the form of the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_178"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 178</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sheep; and inasmuch as it is a he-goat, that is that of the goat. Thus when he slaughters this one, thereby indeed all those (five) animals are slaughtered for him. Whichever of these may suit him--either those five animals, or that (he-goat) for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, or that one for (V&acirc;yu) Niyutvat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_356"></A><A HREF="#fn_356"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:16">6:2:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. Let him slaughter it at full moon. 'Let him slaughter at new moon,' so say some, 'for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is yonder moon: during that night (of new moon) he dwells here (on earth)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_357"></A><A HREF="#fn_357"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and it would be just as if he slaughtered him while staying near.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:17">6:2:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. But, indeed, this (takes place) at full moon, for the victim is yonder moon, and him the gods slaughter at full moon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_358"></A><A HREF="#fn_358"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: 'I will slaughter him at the time when the gods slaughter him,' thus he thinks, and therefore (he does so) at full moon. And, again, why at full moon;--the full moon no</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A></p>  
<p>doubt was the first to shine forth, hence also (the sacrifice takes place) at full moon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:18">6:2:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. And furthermore, at the Ph&acirc;lguna (full moon), for that full moon of Ph&acirc;lguna, that is, the second (Ph&acirc;lguna)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_359"></A><A HREF="#fn_359"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is the first night of the year; and that first (Ph&acirc;lguna) is the last (night of the year): he thus begins the year at the very mouth (beginning).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:19">6:2:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. Now, as soon as he has performed the full-moon offering, let him slaughter the victim. For Indra, having driven away V<I>ri</I>tra, evil, by means of the full-moon offering, thus freed from evil entered upon this sacrificial performance; and in like manner the Sacrificer, having driven away V<I>ri</I>tra, evil, by means of the full-moon offering, thus freed from evil now enters on this (sacred) performance.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:20">6:2:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. This is (performed) in a low voice, for by means of these victims Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati sought to obtain this (sacred) work&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_360"></A><A HREF="#fn_360"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but that (work) was then, as it were, uncertain, indistinct: hence in a low voice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:21">6:2:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. And, again, why in a low voice;--this performance assuredly belongs to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, for it is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati he enters upon by this performance; and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is undefined.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:22">6:2:2:22</A></FONT></span>22. And, again, why in a low voice;--there is seed here in the sacrifice, and seed is cast silently--the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_180"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 180</FONT></A></p>  
<p>omentum, the animal cake, and the chief oblation, for of that much consists the animal sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:23">6:2:2:23</A></FONT></span>23. On the eighth day (after full moon) he collects (the materials for) the fire-pan; for sacred to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is that day, the eighth (after full moon), and sacred to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is this (sacred) piece of work, the fire-pan: on a day sacred to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati he thus performs the work sacred to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:24">6:2:2:24</A></FONT></span>24. And as to why (it is performed) on the eighth day;--that eighth day no doubt is a joint of the year, and that fire-pan is a joint of Agni (the fire-altar): he thus makes joint upon joint.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:25">6:2:2:25</A></FONT></span>25. And, again, why on the eighth day;--eightfold doubtless is the pan&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_361"></A><A HREF="#fn_361"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--the bottom part, the two side-parts, the horizontal belt (or rim), that makes four; and four upright (bands), that makes eight: he thus makes the eightfold on the eightfold (or eighth).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:26">6:2:2:26</A></FONT></span>26. He performs the initiation on the day of new moon; for from out of the new moon the sacrifice is spread: 'Whence the sacrifice is spread, thence will I generate the sacrifice,' so he thinks.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:27">6:2:2:27</A></FONT></span>27. And, again, why he (does so) at new moon;--when he performs the initiation, he verily pours out his 'own self, as seed, into the fire-pan, the womb; and when he becomes initiated, he makes for it (his self) that world (or place) beforehand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_362"></A><A HREF="#fn_362"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and he is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A></p>  
<p>born into the world made by him: hence they say, Man is born into the world made (by him)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_363"></A><A HREF="#fn_363"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:28">6:2:2:28</A></FONT></span>28. Now, were he to be initiated during less than a year, he would build up bricks without space (for them)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_364"></A><A HREF="#fn_364"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: the bricks would exceed the spaces. And if, after making more spaces&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_365"></A><A HREF="#fn_365"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he were not to fill up bricks in accordance therewith, the spaces would exceed the bricks. And when, after initiating himself at new moon, he buys (Soma) at new moon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, he piles up as many bricks as he (during the interval) makes space for; and when his (Agni's second) wing is covered (with loose soil), the whole Agni is built up.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:29">6:2:2:29</A></FONT></span>29. As to this they say, 'If at the time of the buying (of Soma) the days and nights (of the initiation-period) amount to just as many as there are bricks of that fire-altar, why then are not those</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_182"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 182</FONT></A></p>  
<p>spaces of his filled up (which are prepared) during the days there are after the buying (of Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_367"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>? Well, when he buys (Soma) at new moon, after becoming initiated at new moon (a year previously), then he piles up just as many bricks as (during that interval) he makes space for; and what days there then are after the buying (of Soma), during that interval the Adhvaryu builds up the fire-altar. But when should he build up, if there were not that interval? As many as there are days and nights in the year, so many are the bricks of that fire-altar. Thereto (comes) a thirteenth month, for there is that thirteenth month;--thus during the days there are after the buying (of Soma), those spaces of it (the altar) are filled up afterwards with those bricks of the thirteenth month: thus the spaces and the bricks become equal.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:30">6:2:2:30</A></FONT></span>30. Thus, then, what first full moon there is (in the year) on that he slaughters the victim; and what first eighth-day there is, on that he prepares the fire-pan; and what first new moon there is, on that he becomes initiated: thus whatever first days there are in the year, of those he thereby takes possession for him (Agni, the altar), those he thereby gains. Now then as to the total amount (of the fire-altar)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:31">6:2:2:31</A></FONT></span>31. Here now they say, 'How does that sacrificial performance of his (the animal sacrifice) gain the year, Agni? how does it correspond&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_369"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with the year, with Agni?' Well, for those five victims there are twenty-five kindling-verses, twelve &Acirc;pr&icirc;-verses,--that makes thirty-six;--eleven after-offerings, eleven by-offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_370"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--that makes fifty-eight.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:32">6:2:2:32</A></FONT></span>32. Now what forty-eight there are (in these fifty-eight), they are the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; (metre) consisting of forty-eight syllables;--the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; doubtless is this earth, for it is thereon that everything is that moves (<I>g</I>agat); and Agni also is this earth, for it is thereof that the whole Agni is built up: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_371"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:33">6:2:2:33</A></FONT></span>33. And, again, why there are forty-eight;--of forty-eight syllables consists the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;; the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; (comprises) all the metres; all the metres are Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_372"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>); and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is Agni as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="6:2:2:34">6:2:2:34</A></FONT></span>34. And what (remaining) ten there are (in those fifty-eight), they are the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>, consisting of ten syllables; and the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> is Agni,--there are ten regions, and the regions are Agni; ten vital airs, and the vital airs are Agni: as great as Agni is,</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>

Let him nevertheless complete (the sacrifice): Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, having offered that animal, saw that he had not reached the end of him, Agni,--let him therefore complete (the sacrifice). And, again, why he completes it;--that animal sacrifice is his vital air, and if anything were to cut him off from that, it would cut him off from the vital air; and if anything were to cut him off from the vital air, he would thus die: let him therefore complete (the sacrifice).

The later ritualists themselves seem to have been doubtful on this point; but K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana (XVI, 1, 35-37) leans to the opinion, that the second libation must be intended; both libations thus being made to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati on this occasion.

<P><A NAME="fn_352"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_352">173:3</A> Probably 'niyuta<I>h</I>' here with allusion to 'niyuta,' shut in.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_353"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_353">174:1</A> That is, only two additional trish<I>t</I>ubh verses are to be inserted between the 11 (or 15) g&acirc;yatr&icirc; ones.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_354"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_354">175:1</A> The three chief oblations of the Animal Sacrifice, requiring each an invitatory prayer (anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;) and an offering prayer (y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;), are the omentum-oblation (vap&acirc;), the animal cake (pa<I>s</I>upuro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>a), and the meat oblations (pa<I>s</I>u-havis). This is the order on the present occasion, whilst usually the cake-oblation succeeds the offering of meat portions. Now the first of the three invitatory prayers (that of the omentum), viz. V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXVII, 26 (<I>Ri</I>k S. X, 121, 8), and the last of the three offering prayers (that of the meat portions), viz. V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXVII, 25 (<I>Ri</I>k S. X, 121, 7), end with the refrain, 'what god (or, the god Ka) should we serve with offering.' Thus, then, the first and the last of the six formulas would be <A NAME="page_176"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 176</FONT></A> addressed to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; and to him is also exceptionally offered the animal cake, which is here assigned the central position, and which, in the normal sacrificial order, would belong to the recipient of the animal sacrifice itself, or in the present case, to V&acirc;yu Niyutvat. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on the other hand, makes the above two verses, containing the word Ka, the invitatory and offering prayers of the cake-offering, as the MS. makes him say,--kadvatyau y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;nuv&acirc;kye puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>asya, '&acirc;po ha yad b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;r' (<I>Ri</I>k S. X, 121, 7), 'ya<I>s</I><I>k</I>id &acirc;po' (X, 121, 8) ity ete. This, indeed, would also seem to be the opinion of K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, whose rules (XVI, I, 39-43) are,--39. To Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati belongs the animal cake at both (animal sacrifices); 40. The offering and invitatory formulas of the Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya (animal sacrifice) contain the word 'Ka;' 41. Those of the V&acirc;yavya contain the word 'bright;' 42. Optionally so, those of the omentum (but not at the meat portion, commentary); 43. The remainder is equal in all (three views).--Now it would indeed be the most natural, that the formulas of the cake-offering, here exceptionally assigned to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, should be made to correspond to that deity; but the order in which the formulas are given in the V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXVII, 23-28 (cf. &Acirc;<I>s</I>val. III, 8, I, as well as <a href="sbe4132.htm#6:2:2:13">paragraph 13</A> above, seems to favour the first view; though the next paragraph shows that there were differences of opinion on this point. Cf. next note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_355"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_355">176:1</A> The form of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati which has a team of horses is V&acirc;yu, the god of wind; while his bright forms are represented by Agni, the fire (VI, I, 3, 20, 'Agni is all bright things').--V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXVII, 29-34 gives six verses for use as invitatory and offering formulas <A NAME="page_177"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 177</FONT></A> at the ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;pa<I>s</I>u to V&acirc;yu. Five of these contain the word 'niyut,' team, but only the first two contain the word '<I>s</I>ukra' (bright): these two are presumably to be used on the present occasion; though I am at a loss to see what other two verses containing the word 'bright' are to be used; unless indeed '<I>s</I>uklavatya<I>h</I>' in the text means verses containing some word for 'bright,' in which case the ordinary verses used at an animal offering to V&acirc;yu Niyutvat, viz. V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXVII, 23 and 24 (<I>Ri</I>k S. VII, 91, 3; 90, 3) which contain the word '<I>s</I>veta' (white, light), might be used. The MS. of S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a's commentary is unfortunately very corrupt in this place; it alludes to the latter two verses, but whether to recommend them, or set them aside, for the present occasion, is not clear. He does, however, specially except the formulas of the animal cake from being included in the above specification. In the view put forth in <a href="sbe4132.htm#6:2:2:14">paragraph 14</A>, the above-mentioned two verses would apparently have to be used for the omentum-oblation, the two verses containing 'Ka' for the cake-oblation, and (any) two verses containing the word 'team' (either the ordinary ones, <I>Ri</I>k S. VII, 92, 5; VI, 49, 4; or some of the special ones) for the meat-oblation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_356"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_356">178:1</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a here supplies 'let him perform that,'--esh&acirc;m karma<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>m</I> madhye yat karm&acirc;sya sampadyeta tat kury&acirc;d iti <I>s</I>esha<I>h</I>; but he then adds, that the pronoun 'it' (tam) at the beginning of the next paragraph is caused by proximity of the Niyutvat&icirc;ya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_357"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_357">178:2</A> See I, 6, 4, 5. 'Now this king Soma, the food of the gods, is no other than the moon. When he (the moon, masc.) is not seen that night either in the east or in the west, then he visits this world, and here he enters into the waters (f.) and plants (f.).' Thus Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is here identified with Soma, the moon, and food.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_358"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_358">178:3</A> Cp. I, 6, 4, 12-13. 'The full-moon oblation, assuredly, belongs to the V<I>ri</I>tra-slayer, for by means of it Indra slew V<I>ri</I>tra; and this new-moon oblation also represents the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra, since they prepared that invigorating draught for him who had slain V<I>ri</I>tra. An offering in honour of the V<I>ri</I>tra-slayer, then, is the full-moon sacrifice. V<I>ri</I>tra, assuredly, is no other than the moon; and when during that night (of new moon) he is not seen either in the east or in the west, then he (Indra) finishes in destroying him by means of that (new-moon sacrifice), and leaves nothing remaining of him.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_359"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_359">179:1</A> In the older division of the year the first or spring season (vasanta) begins with the month of Ph&acirc;lguna, that is the month when the moon is in conjunction with the nakshatra of the Uttare Phalgun&icirc;, whence that full moon, in the Kaush. Br. 5, 1, is called the mouth, and that of the first Phalgun&icirc; the tail, of the year. See A. Weber, Nachrichten von den Naxatra, II, p. 329. In the above, somewhat bold figure, we are, S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a reminds us, to understand the fifteenth or last day (of the dark fortnight) of the first Phalgun&icirc;, and the pratipad, or first day of the second Phalgun&icirc;.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_362"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_362">180:2</A> There is kept up in these paragraphs a play on the word 'loka,' meaning both 'space' and 'world (or place of living),'--and applying both to the space occupied by a brick, in building up the altar; and to the place which the Sacrificer, by this performance, gains for himself in another world. The initiation period is here represented <A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A> as the time during which the Sacrificer prepares both the requisite space for the altar (as it were, adding day by day so many brick-spaces, thus becoming available for the altar-pile at the time of construction), and an adequate place for himself in the celestial regions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_363"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_363">181:1</A> That is, man receives, in a future existence, the reward or punishment for his deeds during this life.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_364"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_364">181:2</A> The author argues in support of the orthodox initiation-period of just one year, as just the amount of time required for preparing the exact amount of space (or brick-spaces) requisite for an altar of proper size. If the initiation were to last less than a year, he would not have had sufficient time to prepare the necessary amount of space, or rather, number of spaces required for the bricks; and, by implication, he would not acquire for himself an adequate place hereafter.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_365"></A><A HREF="sbe4132.htm#fr_365">181:3</A> That is to say, if he were to make the initiation-period last longer than a year, thus providing for more space than his supply of bricks would suffice to fill up.</P>

During this period the Upasads have to be performed twice daily, and in the interval between the two performances the building of the altar takes place, a certain number of bricks being added each day.</P>
