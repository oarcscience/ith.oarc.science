<p>that Agni, the house-lord, leads him to hold the position of a master of the house. And as to its being of quick-grown rice: 'May they quickly lead me!' so he thinks.</p>

For Soma Vanaspati (the wood-lord or tree) he then prepares a pap of <I>s</I>y&acirc;m&acirc;ka millet: thereby Soma, the wood-lord, quickens him for the plants. And as to its being prepared of <I>s</I>y&acirc;m&acirc;ka,--they, the <I>s</I>y&acirc;m&acirc;kas among plants doubtless are most manifestly Soma's own: therefore it is prepared of <I>s</I>y&acirc;m&acirc;ka grain.</p>

<p>him for cattle. And as to its being prepared of gavedhuk&acirc; seed;--that God is (the recipient of) refuse (remains of offering), and gavedhuk&acirc; seeds are refuse: therefore it is (prepared) of gavedhuk&acirc; seed.</p>

And as to its being prepared of N&acirc;mba seed,--to Varu<I>n</I>a, no doubt, belong those plants which grow in ploughed ground; but those, the N&acirc;mba plants, belong to Mitra: therefore it is (prepared) of N&acirc;mba seed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:3:9">5:3:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. For Varu<I>n</I>a Dharmapati (the lord of the law) he then prepares a Varu<I>n</I>a pap of barley: thereby Varu<I>n</I>a, the lord of the law, makes him lord of the law; and that truly is the supreme state, when one is lord of the law; for whosoever attains to the supreme state, to him they come in (matters of) law: therefore to Varu<I>n</I>a Dharmapati.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> --he thereby says, 'Quicken him, O gods, so as to be without an enemy; for great chiefdom, for great lordship!' in this there is nothing obscure;--'for man-rule!' 'for the ruling of men,' he thereby says;--'for Indra's energy!' 'for vigour' he means to say when he says, 'for Indra's energy;'--'him, the son of such and such (a man), the son of such and such (a woman),'--whatever be his parentage, with reference to that he says this;--'of such and such a people,' that is to say, of the people whose king he is;--'this man, O ye (people)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, is your king, Soma is the king of us Brahmans!' He thereby causes everything here to be food for him (the king); the Br&acirc;hman alone he excepts: therefore the Br&acirc;hman is not to be fed upon, for he has Soma for his king.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:3:13">5:3:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. Now those gods have the power of quickening, whence their name 'devas&ucirc;' (Divine Quickeners). It is those gods who now quicken him thus, and quickened (consecrated) by them he will be consecrated on the morrow.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:3:14">5:3:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. They are double-named, for a coupling means strength: 'May the strong quicken (him),' thus he thinks, and therefore they are double-named.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:3:15">5:3:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. He now says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.' And as to why that ceremony is performed here between two offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--verily Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is that sacrifice which is here performed, and from which all these creatures were produced,--</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_73"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 73</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and so they are even now produced after this one. Thus he places him (the Sacrificer) in the very middle of that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and quickens him in the middle: this is why that ceremony is performed between two offerings. Having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>. he says, 'Urge for Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t!' and offers as the Vasha<I>t</I> is pronounced.</p>

The D&icirc;ksh&acirc; is performed immediately after the expiration of the dark fortnight following the full-moon of Phalgun&icirc;, that is to say, on the first day of <I>K</I>aitra (about the middle of March).--According to Katy.
