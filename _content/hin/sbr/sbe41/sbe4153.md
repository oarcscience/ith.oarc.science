### EIGHTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:1">6:8:1:1</span></span>1. 'Let
him drive Agni about while keeping him up,' so they say. The gods and
the Asuras, both of them sprung from [Pra*g*âpati](errata.htm#14), were
contending. The gods drove about on wheels (cars), and the Asuras stayed
at home. The gods, while driving about on wheels, saw <span
id="fr_545"></span>[1](#fn_543) this rite (sacrificial performance), for
it was indeed in driving about on wheels that they saw this rite: hence
it is to the cart that the formulas relate at the (performance with)
sacrificial cakes <span id="fr_546"></span>[2](#fn_544), and to the cart
in the building of the fire-altar <span id="fr_547"></span>[3](#fn_545).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:2">6:8:1:2</span></span>2. Now he
who drives Agni about goes to the gods by the sacred performance, for
divine is the rite performed by him; but he who does not drive him about
goes to the Asuras by the sacred performance, for demoniac is the rite
performed by him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:3">6:8:1:3</span></span>3. Here
now some say, 'It is by himself that he (Agni) is driven about; for by
the Vish*n*u-strides he drives forward, and by the Vâtsapra he unyokes.'
Let him not think this to be so; for divine (to the gods) is that
progress of his, to wit, the Vish*n*u-strides; and divine the unyoking,
to wit, the Vâtsapra. But human would be that progress of his, which he
makes in this manner, and human the unyoking he makes.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:4">6:8:1:4</span></span>4. This
Agni is Pra*g*âpati; and Pra*g*âpati is both the gods and men. Now when
the Vish*n*u-strides and the Vâtsapra are (performed), he thereby makes
up that form of his which is divine; and when he drives him about he
thereby makes up that form of his which is human. Verily, then, he who,
knowing this, drives him about, makes up that whole and entire
Pra*g*âpati: let him therefore by all means drive him (Agni) about.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:5">6:8:1:5</span></span>5. Now on
any day on which he may intend to drive, he gets the chariot placed
north of the fire (with the pole) to the east; and puts a kindling-stick
on it (the fire); for at that time the gods first regaled him (Agni)
with food, with that kindling-stick, when he was about to start: and in
like manner does this one now first regale him with food, with that
kindling-stick, when he is about to start.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:6">6:8:1:6</span></span>6.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XII, 30; *Ri*k S. VIII, 44, 1\] 'With fuel serve ye
Agni!'--that is, 'with fuel worship ye Agni!'--'with draughts of ghee
awake ye the guest, offer ye libations unto him!'--that is, 'with
(draughts of) ghee do ye awake the guest, and offer libations unto
him!'--with a (verse) containing (the verb) 'awake' he awakens him for
the starting.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:7">6:8:1:7</span></span>7. He
then lifts him (the fire) up, with (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 31), 'Upwards may the
All-gods bear thee, O Agni, by their thoughts!'--at the beginning all
the gods did indeed bear him upwards by their thoughts, for that (or,
he) was then their thought: in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now
bear him upwards by his thoughts, for this now is his thought;--'be thou
gracious unto us, of fair look, and rich splendour!'--as the text, so
its meaning. From the south he places him (Agni) northwards

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

on (the chariot)--the significance of this has been explained. Having
put the Gârhapatya into a pot, he places it on (the chariot) behind (the
Âhavanîya, or Ukhya Agni). If he choose, he himself may mount up beside
him (Agni), or he may walk by the side (of the chariot).

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:8">6:8:1:8</span></span>8. He
then yokes two oxen, first the right one, then the left one: so (it is
done) with the gods, otherwise in human (practice). And in whatever
direction he may intend to drive, let him first drive east, for the east
is Agni's region: he (Agni) thus proceeds towards his own region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:9">6:8:1:9</span></span>9.
\[Whilst driving thither, he mutters, Vâ*g*. S. XII, 32\] 'Go forth, O
Agni, brilliant thou with propitious flames!'--that is, 'Brilliant, O
Agni, go thou forth with propitious, shining flames!'--'Beaming with
great beams injure not my people with thy body!'--that is, 'With great
shining flames do not injure my people by thyself!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:10">6:8:1:10</span></span>10.
Whenever the axle creaks, let him mutter that prayer (Vâ*g*. S. XII,
33); for demoniacal is that voice which is in the axle: he thereby
appeases that (voice) and makes it as of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:11">6:8:1:11</span></span>11.
And, again, why he mutters that prayer;--with whomsoever, mounted (on a
chariot), the axle creaks, this is his own voice: hence when the axle
creaks while Agni is mounted, this is the voice of Agni himself. It was
Agni indeed whom the gods thereby praised and magnified; and in like
manner does this (Sacrificer) thereby praise and magnify him: 'Agni
roared like the thundering sky,'--the meaning of this has been
explained <span id="fr_548"></span>[1](#fn_546).

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:12">6:8:1:12</span></span>12. If
he unyokes before (reaching) his dwelling, let the fire remain on the
chariot itself; but when he unyokes for (staying at) his dwelling, he
stops the chariot (with the pole) to the east; and north of it he raises
and sprinkles (a place) where he takes it (the fire) down. He takes it
down from south to north: the meaning of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:13">6:8:1:13</span></span>13. He
then puts a kindling-stick thereon; for on that occasion the gods
regaled him (Agni) with food, with that kindling-stick, after he had
travelled: in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now regale him, after
he has travelled, with food, with that kindling-stick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:14">6:8:1:14</span></span>14.
\[He puts it on, with Vâ*g*. S. XII, 34; *Ri*k S. VII, 8, 4\] 'Far, far
famed is this Agni of the Bharata (tribe),'--the Bharata <span
id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_547), doubtless, is Pra*g*âpati, for he
sustains (bhar) this entire (universe);--'that his great light shineth
brightly, as the sun,'--that is, 'that, like the sun, his great light
shines brightly;'--'he who overthrew Pûru in battles,'--Pûru, by name,
was an Âsura-Rakshas: him Agni overthrew (abhi-sthâ) in
battles;--'blazed up hath the divine guest, gracious unto us;'--that is,
'being kindled, the divine guest is gracious to us.' With a (verse)
containing (the verb) 'sthâ' (he performs), for he thereby makes him
stop (sthâ) for (staying at) his home.

<span class="margnote"><span id="6:8:1:15">6:8:1:15</span></span>15.
Now, then, the (symbolic) correspondence,--with the first (formula) he
puts on a kindling-stick, with one he lifts him up, with one he starts,
with one he addresses the axle, with the fifth he puts on a

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

kindling-stick, that makes five,--of five layers consists the
fire-altar, five seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as
Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_543"></span>[289:1](sbe4153.htm#fr_545) Sâya*n*a says,
'vîrasiddhe*h*,' 'by the heroes’ success.'

<span id="fn_544"></span>[289:2](sbe4153.htm#fr_546) See I, 1, 2, 5.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[289:3](sbe4153.htm#fr_547) Sâya*n*a refers to
Vâ*g*. S. XII, 31, 'upwards may the All-gods bear thee . . .'
([paragraph 9](sbe4153.htm#6:8:1:9)) below, as a passage in point.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[291:1](sbe4153.htm#fr_548) See above, [VI, 7,
3, 2](sbe4151.htm#6:7:3:2).

<span id="fn_547"></span>[292:1](sbe4153.htm#fr_549) Mahîdhara, in
accordance with Nigh. III, 18 (priest), explains 'bharata' as the one
who brings (blear) offerings; and, with Sâya*n*a, identifies the Bharata
with the Sacrificer.
