Having taken up both (the G&acirc;rhapatya and &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya) fires on the two kindling-sticks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he goes to the house of the Commander of the army, and prepares a cake on eight potsherds for Agni An&icirc;kavat; for Agni is the head (an&icirc;ka) of the gods, and the commander is the head of the army: hence for Agni An&icirc;kavat. And he, the commander, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: it is for</p>

<p>him that he is thereby consecrated (or quickened), and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel-offering) consists in gold; for Agni's is that sacrifice, and gold is Agni's seed: therefore the sacrificial fee consists in gold.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:2">5:3:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Purohita (the king's court chaplain), and prepares a pap for B<I>ri</I>haspati; for B<I>ri</I>haspati is the Purohita of the gods, and that (court chaplain) is the Purohita ('praepositus') of that (king): hence it is for B<I>ri</I>haspati. And he, the Purohita, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this is a white-backed bullock; for to B<I>ri</I>haspati belongs that upper region, and there above lies that path of Aryaman (the sun)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: therefore the fee for the B&acirc;rhaspatya (oblation) is a white-backed (bullock).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:3">5:3:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. And on the following day he prepares a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra at the dwelling of him who is being consecrated (the king); for Indra is the Kshatra (ruling power), and he who is consecrated is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Kshatra: hence it is for Indra. The sacrificial fee for this is a bull, for the bull is Indra's own (animal).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:4">5:3:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. And on the following day, he goes to the dwelling of the Queen, and prepares a pap for Aditi; for Aditi is this Earth, and she is the wife of the gods; and that (queen) is the wife of that (king): hence it is for Aditi. And she, the Queen, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for her that he is thereby consecrated, and he makes her his own faithful (wife). The sacrificial fee, on her part, is a milch cow; for this (earth) is, as it were, a milch cow: she yields to men all their desires; and the milch cow is a mother, and this (earth) is, as it were, a mother: she bears (or sustains) men. Hence the fee is a milch cow.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:5">5:3:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. And on the following day, he goes to the house of the S&ucirc;ta (court-minstrel and chronicler), and prepares a barley pap for Varu<I>n</I>a; for the S&ucirc;ta is a spiriter (sava), and Varu<I>n</I>a is the spiriter of the gods: therefore it is for Varu<I>n</I>a. And he, the S&ucirc;ta, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated; and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this one is a horse, for the horse is Varu<I>n</I>a's own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:6">5:3:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. And on the following day, he goes to the house of the Headman (Gr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), and prepares a cake</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on seven potsherds for the Maruts; for the Maruts are the peasants, and the headman is a peasant: therefore it is for the Maruts. And he, the headman, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a spotted bullock, for in such a spotted bullock there is abundance of colours; and the Maruts are the clans (or peasants), and the clan means abundance; therefore the sacrificial fee is a spotted bullock.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:7">5:3:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. And on the following day he goes to the house of the Chamberlain (kshatt<I>ri</I>), and prepares a cake on either twelve, or eight, potsherds for Savit<I>ri</I>; for Savit<I>ri</I> is the impeller (prasavit<I>ri</I>) of the gods, and the chamberlain is an impeller: hence it is for Savit<I>ri</I>. And he, the chamberlain, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he thereby is consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful (follower). The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a reddish-white draught-bullock; for Savit<I>ri</I> is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed moves along; and the draught-bullock also moves along, when yoked. And as to why it is a reddish-white one;--reddish-white indeed is he (the sun) both in rising and in setting: therefore the sacrificial fee is a reddish-white draught-bullock.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:8">5:3:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. And on the following day he goes to the house</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the Charioteer (sa<I>m</I>grah&icirc;t<I>ri</I>), and prepares a cake on two potsherds for the A<I>s</I>vins; for the two A<I>s</I>vins are of the same womb; and so are the chariot fighter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and the driver (s&acirc;rathi) of the same womb (standing-place), since they stand on one and the same chariot: hence it is for the A<I>s</I>vins. And he, the charioteer, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a pair of twin bullocks, for such twin bullocks are of the same womb. If he cannot obtain twins, two bullocks produced by successive births (of the same cow) may also form the sacrificial fee, for such also are of the same womb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:9">5:3:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. And on the following day he goes to the house</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the Carver (bh&acirc;gadugha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), and prepares a pap for P&ucirc;shan, for P&ucirc;shan is carver to the gods; and that (officer) is carver to that (king): therefore it is for P&ucirc;shan. And he, the carver, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a dark-grey bullock: the significance of such a one being the same as at the Trisha<I>m</I>yukta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:10">5:3:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. And on the following day, having brought together gavedhuk&acirc; (seeds) from the houses of the Keeper of the dice (aksh&acirc;v&acirc;pa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) and the Huntsman (govikartana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>), he prepares a gavedhuk&acirc; pap for Rudra at the house of him who is consecrated. These two, while being two jewels (of the king), he makes one for the purpose of completeness. And as to why he performs this offering,--Rudra is hankering after that (cow) which is killed here in this hall;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></p>  
<p>now Rudra is Agni (fire), and the gaming-board being fire, and the dice being its coals, it is him (Rudra) he thereby pleases. And verily whosoever, that knows this thus, performs the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, in his house that approved (cow) is killed. And he, the keeper of dice, and the huntsman, are (each of them) assuredly one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for these two that he is thereby consecrated, and these two he makes his own faithful followers. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) is a bicoloured bullock--either one with white fore-feet, or a white-tailed one,--a claw-shaped knife, and a dice-board&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with a horsehair band&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for that is what belongs to those two&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_137"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:11">5:3:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. And on the following day he goes to the house of the Courier, and having taken ghee in four ladlings, he offers the ghee to the way, with, 'May the way graciously accept of the ghee, hail!' For the courier is to be dispatched, and when dispatched goes on his way: therefore he offers the ghee to the way. And he, the courier, assuredly is one of his (the king's) jewels: it is for him that he is thereby consecrated, and him he makes his own faithful follower. The sacrificial fee for this (jewel) consists in a skin-covered bow, leathern quivers, and a red turban, for that is what belongs to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:12">5:3:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. These are the eleven jewels (ratna) he completes; for of eleven syllables consists the Trish<I>t</I>ubh, and the Trish<I>t</I>ubh is vigour: it is for the sake</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of vigour that he completes the (eleven) jewels. Then as to why he performs the oblations of the Ratnins: it is their king he becomes; it is for them that he thereby is consecrated, and it is them he makes his own faithful followers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="5:3:1:13">5:3:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. And on the following day he goes to the house of a discarded (wife), and prepares a pap for Nir<I>ri</I>ti;--a discarded wife is one who has no son. He cooks the pap for Nir<I>ri</I>ti of black rice, after splitting the grains with his nails. He offers it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IX, 3), 'This, O Nir<I>ri</I>ti, is thy share: accept it graciously, hail!' For a wife that is without a son, is possessed with Nir<I>ri</I>ti (destruction, calamity); and whatever of Nir<I>ri</I>ti's nature there is in her, that he thereby propitiates, and thus Nir<I>ri</I>ti does not take possession of him while he is consecrated. The fee for this (oblation) consists of a black, decrepit, diseased cow; for such a one also is possessed with Nir<I>ri</I>ti. He says to her (the wife), 'Let her not dwell this day in my dominion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_138"></A><A HREF="#fn_138"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>! thus he removes evil from himself.</p>

S. I, 8, 9; Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3) the order of the Ratnina<I>h</I>, at whose houses these oblations are performed on successive days, is as follows--1. Brahman priest (a pap to B<I>ri</I>haspati); 2.

Akshav&acirc;pa (dy&ucirc;takara, superintendent of gambling, S&acirc;y.--gav&icirc;dhuka pap to Rudra).--Finally the king offers in his own house two cake-oblations (of eleven kap&acirc;las) to Indra Sutra-man (the good protector) and Indra A<I>m</I>homu<I>k</I> (the deliverer from trouble).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_128"></A><A HREF="sbe4113.htm#fr_128">59:1</A> Whence the back of that upper region is white, or bright.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_129"></A><A HREF="sbe4113.htm#fr_129">60:1</A> The exact function of this officer is not clearly defined. Though the term is also used of an ordinary village headman (Patel, Adhik&acirc;rin, Adigar), this could hardly apply here. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on one passage, indeed explains the term by 'Gr&acirc;ma<I>m</I> nayati,' but elsewhere he explains it by 'Gr&acirc;m&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>m</I> net&acirc;;' and some such meaning it may perhaps have here,--the head of communal administration, either for a district (like one of Manu's lords of a hundred, or a <A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A> thousand villages), or for the whole country. If, however, the headman of a single village be intended (as the coupling of the office with the Maruts might lead one to suppose), he would probably be a hereditary territorial proprietor residing near the place where the inauguration ceremony takes place. Cf. <a href="sbe4121.htm#5:4:4:18">V, 4, 4, 18</A>; and Zimmer. Altindisches Leben, p. 171.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_130"></A><A HREF="sbe4113.htm#fr_130">62:1</A> Savyash<I>th</I>ri (otherwise savyesh<I>th</I><I>ri</I>, savyesh<I>th</I>a;--savyastha, K&acirc;<I>n</I>va rec.) is explained by the commentaries as a synonym of s&acirc;rathi, charioteer (with which it is compounded in savyesh<I>th</I>as&acirc;rath&icirc;, Taitt. Br. I, 7, 9, 1, where S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a makes them the two charioteers standing on the left and right side of the warrior), but it seems more probable that the former terms refer to the warrior (&#0960;&#0945;&#0961;&#0945;&#0946;&#0940;&#0964;&#0951;&#0962;) himself (as savyash<I>th</I>&acirc;, Atharva-veda VIII, 8, 23, undoubtedly does), who stands on the left side of the driver (s&acirc;rathi, &#7969;&#0957;&#8055;&#0959;&#0967;&#0959;&#0962;); the Change of meaning being perhaps due to caste scruples about so close an association between the Kshatriya warrior and his <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra servant, as is implied in this and other passages. (Cf. V, 3, 2, 2 with note.)--On Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains sa<I>m</I>grah&icirc;t<I>ri</I> as the treasurer (dhanasa<I>m</I>grahakart&acirc; ko<I>s</I>&acirc;dhyaksha<I>h</I>), but on I, 8, 16 optionally as treasurer or charioteer; while the S&ucirc;ta is I, 8, 9 identified by him with the charioteer (s&acirc;rathi). It is more probable, however, that at the time of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a the S&ucirc;ta occupied much the same position as that assigned to him in the epics, viz. that of court-bard and chronicler. The connection of the sa<I>m</I>grah&icirc;t<I>ri</I> with the A<I>s</I>vins can also scarcely be said to favour the interpretation of the term proposed by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a (who, moreover, is himself compelled, on Taitt. S. I, 8, 15; Taitt. Br. I, 7, 10, 6, to take it in the sense of charioteer).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_131"></A><A HREF="sbe4113.htm#fr_131">63:1</A> The meaning 'tax-gatherer, collector of tithes (or rather, of the sixth part of produce)' assigned to the term by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, both here, and on Taitt. S. I, 8, 9, might seem the more natural one, considering the etymology of the term. See, however, the explanation given of it in our Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a I, 1, 2, 17:--'P&ucirc;shan is bh&acirc;gadugha (distributor of portions) to the gods, who places with his hands the food before them.'
