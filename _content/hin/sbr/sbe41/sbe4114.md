### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:1">5:3:2:1</span></span>1. After
the 'jewels' he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra. It is cooked in milk
from a white (cow) which has a white calf. And as to why, after the
'jewels,' he offers (a pap) to Soma and Rudra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:2">5:3:2:2</span></span>2. Now,
once upon a time, Svarbhânu, the Âsura, struck the sun with darkness,
and stricken with darkness he did not shine <span
id="fr_139"></span>[2](#fn_139). Soma and Rudra

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

removed that darkness of his; and freed from evil he burns yonder. And
in like manner does that (king) thereby enter darkness,--or darkness
enters him,--when he puts those unworthy of sacrifice <span
id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140) in contact with the sacrifice; and he
does indeed now put those unworthy of sacrifice--either *S*ûdras or
whomever else--in contact with the sacrifice. It is Soma and Rudra who
remove that darkness of his; and freed from evil he becomes consecrated.
And as to why it is cooked in milk from a white (cow) which has a white
calf,--darkness is black: that darkness he removes. The sacrificial fee
for this (oblation) is a white (cow) which has a white calf.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:3">5:3:2:3</span></span>3. Even
he who, while being qualified for fame, is not yet famous, may perform
that offering. Now he who is learned (in the Veda), while being
qualified for fame, is not famous; and he who is not famous, is covered
with darkness: that darkness of his Soma and Rudra thereby remove; and
freed from evil he becomes a very light by his prosperity and renown.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:4">5:3:2:4</span></span>4.
Thereupon he prepares a pap for Mitra and B*ri*haspati <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141). For verily he who departs from the

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

path of the sacrifice stumbles; and he does indeed depart from the path
of the sacrifice, when he puts those unworthy of sacrifice in contact
with the sacrifice, and he does indeed now put those unworthy of
sacrifice--either *S*ûdras or whomever else--in contact with the
sacrifice. And the path of the sacrifice is Mitra and B*ri*haspati; for
Mitra is the Brahman, and the Brahman is the sacrifice; and B*ri*haspati
is the Brahman, and the Brahman is the sacrifice. Thus he, returns again
to the path of the sacrifice; and as soon as he has returned to the path
of the sacrifice he is consecrated: therefore he prepares a pap for
Mitra and B*ri*haspati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:5">5:3:2:5</span></span>5. The
course of this (is as follows). Any a*s*vattha branch broken off by
itself, either on the eastern or on the northern side (of the tree),
from that he makes a vessel (to hold the pap) for Mitra; for that which
is hewn by the axe belongs to Varu*n*a; but that which is broken off by
itself belongs to Mitra: therefore he makes the vessel for Mitra from a
branch broken off by itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:6">5:3:2:6</span></span>6.
Thereupon having curdled the (milk into) curds, and poured it into a
leathern bag; and having put (the horses) to the cart, and fastened (the
bag on the cart), he tells it to 'fly away.' This is that (kind of)
fresh butter which is self-produced <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142); for that which is churned belongs to
Varu*n*a, and that which is self-produced belongs to Mitra: therefore it
is self-produced butter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:7">5:3:2:7</span></span>7. They
divide the rice-grains into two parts: the smaller and broken ones
belong to B*ri*haspati,

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

and the larger and unbroken ones to Mitra. For Mitra injures no one, nor
does any one injure Mitra; neither a ku*s*a stalk nor a thorn pricks
him, nor has he any scar; for Mitra is every one's friend (mitram).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:3:2:8">5:3:2:8</span></span>8. He
then puts the pap for B*ri*haspati on (the fire), covers it with the
vessel for Mitra's (pap), pours the butter (into the latter), and throws
in the (larger) rice-grains. It is cooked merely by the hot steam <span
id="fr_143"></span>[1](sbe4115.htm#fn_143); for what is cooked by fire
belongs to Varu*n*a, and what is cooked by hot steam belongs to Mitra:
therefore it is cooked by hot steam. Making cuttings from both these
sacrificial dishes, he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Mitra
and B*ri*haspati!' Having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says,
'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Mitra and B*ri*haspati!' and offers as
the Vasha*t* is uttered.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_139"></span>[65:2](sbe4114.htm#fr_139) According to
Rig-veda V, 40, 5-9 (cf. *S*at. Br. IV, 3, 4, 23 <span id="page_66">p.
66</span> with note) it was Atri who restored the light of the sun.
Professor Ludwig (Bohemian Academy of Sciences, Sitzungsber., May, 1885)
has tried to prove that solar eclipses (partly available for
chronological purposes) are referred to in this and some other passages
of the hymns. Compare also Professor Whitney's remarks thereon,
Proceedings of Am. Or. Soc., Oct. 1885, p. xvii.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[66:1](sbe4114.htm#fr_140) That is, some of
those officials of his to whom the ratna-havis were offered; Sâya*n*a
specifying 'the Commander of the army and others' as *S*ûdras; and the
'Huntsman and others' as of whatsoever (low) caste.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[66:2](sbe4114.htm#fr_141) According to the
Taittirîya ritualists this double oblation forms part of the dîkshâ, or
initiation ceremony (V, 3, 3, 1). See Taitt. S., vol. ii, p. 108.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[67:1](sbe4114.htm#fr_142) That is, produced in
the leathern bottle without further direct human agency, and by the mere
motion of the cart.
