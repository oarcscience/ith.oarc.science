# SATAPATHA-BRÂHMA*N*A.

## FIFTH KÂ*ND*A.

#### A. THE VÂ*G*APEYA.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:1">5:1:1:1</span></span>1. Once
upon a time the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from
Pra*g*âpati, strove together. And the Asuras, even through arrogance,
thinking, 'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on
offering into their own mouths. They came to naught, even through
arrogance: wherefore let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the
cause <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28) of ruin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:2">5:1:1:2</span></span>2. But
the gods went on making offerings unto one another. Pra*g*âpati gave
himself up to them: thus the sacrifice <span
id="fr_29"></span>[2](#fn_29) became theirs; and indeed the sacrifice is
the food of the gods <span id="fr_30"></span>[3](#fn_30).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:3">5:1:1:3</span></span>3. They
then spake, 'To which of us shall this <span
id="fr_31"></span>[4](#fn_31) belong?' They did not agree together,
saying,

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'To me! to me!'
Not being agreed, they said, 'Let us run a race for it: whichever of us
shall win, to him it shall belong!'--'So be it!' so they ran a race for
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:4">5:1:1:4</span></span>4. Then
B*ri*haspati hasted up to Savit*ri* for his impulsion <span
id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32),--Savit*ri* being the impeller
(prasavit*ri*) among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me, (so that)
impelled by thee, I may win this!' Then Savit*ri*, as the impeller,
impelled it for him, and impelled by Savit*ri*, he won: he became
everything here, he won everything here; for he won Pra*g*âpati, and
Pra*g*âpati (the lord of creatures and procreation) indeed is everything
here. By offering therewith he (B*ri*haspati) ascended to that upper
region. Therefore who so knoweth, and who so knoweth not,--they say,
'That upper region belongeth to B*ri*haspati.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:5">5:1:1:5</span></span>5. Thus
they who of old used to offer the Vâ*g*apeya, ascended to that upper
region. From there Aupâvi *G*âna*s*ruteya descended again: thenceforward
(all men) descend again.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:6">5:1:1:6</span></span>6. Indra
offered that (Vâ*g*apeya),--he became everything here, he won everything
here; for he won Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati  is everything here: by
offering therewith he ascended to that upper region.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:7">5:1:1:7</span></span>7. Thus
they who of old used to offer the Vâ*g*apeya, ascended to that upper
region. From there Aupâvi *G*âna*s*ruteya descended' again:
thenceforward (all men) descend again.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:8">5:1:1:8</span></span>8. And
whosoever offers the Vâ*g*apeya, he becomes everything here, he wins
everything here; for he wins Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati indeed is
everything here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:9">5:1:1:9</span></span>9. Here
now they say, 'One must not offer the Vâ*g*apeya; for he who offers the
Vâ*g*apeya wins everything here,--for he wins Pra*g*âpati, and
Pra*g*âpati is everything here,--he leaves nothing remaining here: his
people (or offspring) is like to become worse (off).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:10">5:1:1:10</span></span>10. Let
him none the less sacrifice: whatever (priests) thus know that sacrifice
properly, in respect of the Ri*k*, the Ya*g*us, and the Sâman, and such
as are proficient, let them assist him in offering it; for verily this
is the perfection of that sacrifice, when wise (priests) assist him in
offering it: let him therefore sacrifice by all means.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:11">5:1:1:11</span></span>11. Now
truly this (the Vâ*g*apeya) is the Brâhma*n*a's own sacrifice, inasmuch
as B*ri*haspati (the lord of prayer and devotion) performed it; for
B*ri*haspati is the Brahman (priesthood, or priestly dignity), and the
Brâhma*n*a is the Brahman. And it is also that of the Râ*g*anya,
inasmuch as Indri performed it; for Indra is the Kshatra (nobility, or
ruling power), and the Râ*g*anya is the Kshatra.

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:12">5:1:1:12</span></span>12. To
the king (râ*g*an) doubtless belongs the Râ*g*asûya; for by offering the
Râ*g*asûya he becomes king; and unsuited for kingship is the Brâhma*n*a.
And, moreover, the Râ*g*asûya is the lower, and the Vâ*g*apeya the
higher (sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:13">5:1:1:13</span></span>13. For
by offering the Râ*g*asûya <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33) he
becomes king, and by the Vâ*g*apeya (he becomes) emperor (samrâ*g*); and
the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor the higher: a king
might indeed wish to become emperor, for the office of king is the
lower, and that of emperor the higher; but the emperor would not wish to
become king, for the office of king is the lower, and that of emperor
the higher.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:14">5:1:1:14</span></span>14.
Thus that (king) who, by performing the Vâ*g*apeya, becomes emperor,
possesses himself of everything here. Previously to each performance (of
an ish*t*i <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34)) he offers that oblation
to Savit*ri* (the sun), with the text, 'O divine Savit*ri*, impel
(prosper) the sacrifice, impel Pra*g*âpati for his portion!'

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:15">5:1:1:15</span></span>15. And
even as then B*ri*haspati hasted up to Savit*ri* for his impulsion
Savit*ri* being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel this for me,
(so that) impelled by thee I may win it!' and Savit*ri*, as the
impeller, impelled it for him; and impelled by Savit*ri* he won it; even
so does this (sacrificing king) now haste up to Savit*ri* for his
impulsion--Savit*ri* being the impeller among the gods--saying, 'Impel
this for me: may I win it, impelled by thee!' and Savit*ri*, as the
impeller, impels it for him, and he wins it impelled by Savit*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="5:1:1:16">5:1:1:16</span></span>16.
Wherefore he says (Vâ*g*. S. IX, 1), 'God Savit*ri*, speed the
sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his portion! May the
heavenly. thought-cleansing Gandharva cleanse our thought! May the Lord
of Speech render our meat palatable, hail!' For the Lord of Speech is
Pra*g*âpati, and meat means food: 'May Pra*g*âpati this day make
palatable this our food!' thus he thereby says. This same oblation he
offers till the day before the Soma-feast, for thus that performance of
his has been commenced; and he (Savit*ri*, the Sun) becomes serene
during that sacrifice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_28"></span>[1:1](sbe4103.htm#fr_28) Lit. 'the mouth,' i.e.
the opening or beginning, of ruin. The St. Petersburg Dict. compares
Prov. xvi. 18: 'Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit
before a fall.'

<span id="fn_29"></span>[1:2](sbe4103.htm#fr_29) Pra*g*âpati (the lord
of creatures or generation) is both the sacrifice and the year (time);
see III, 2, 2, 4.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[1:3](sbe4103.htm#fr_30) See II, 4, 2, 1. To
them (the gods) he (Pra*g*âpati) said, 'The sacrifice (shall be) your
food, immortality your sustenance (ûr*g*), and the sun your light!'

<span id="fn_31"></span>[1:4](sbe4103.htm#fr_31) For the neuter
idam--hardly here 'this universe,' or 'vâ*g*apeyam,' <span
id="page_2">p. 2</span> but rather 'this thing, it'--the Kâ*n*va text
reads ayam 'he,' i.e. Pra*g*âpati, or the sacrifice (ya*gñ*a, masc.);
cf. note on [V, 1, 4, 15](sbe4106.htm#5:1:4:15).

<span id="fn_32"></span>[2:1](sbe4103.htm#fr_32) For want of a simpler
and more homely set of terms for the derivatives of the verb sû 'to
animate' here used, those used in the preceding volumes are here
generally adhered to, though, as there, somewhat reluctantly. The simple
'to bless, blessing, &c.' might sometimes fit quite well, though no
doubt they imply an idea altogether foreign to the etymological meaning
of this verb, and could not possibly be used, as is the case here, of
the animating influence of the sun. Sometimes 'to speed' has been
chosen, where the etymological connection with Savit*ri* is not insisted
upon; while in other passages 'to consecrate, consecration, &c.' might
probably come nearer to the meaning of the original. Cp. Delbrück,
Altindische Syntax, p. 256.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[4:1](sbe4103.htm#fr_33) Kâty. *S*r. XV, I, 1-2,
lays down the rule that the Râ*g*asûya is to be performed by a king who
has not yet performed the Vâ*g*apeya. Â*s*val. *S*r. IX, 9, 19, on the
other hand, rules: 'After performing it (the Vâ*g*apeya) let a king
perform the Râ*g*asûya, a Brâhma*n*a the B*ri*haspati-sava' (cf. V, 2,
1, 19). See also Kâty. XIV, 1, 2 seq. Cf. Lâ*t*y. *S*r. VIII, 11, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[4:2](sbe4103.htm#fr_34) During the bright
fortnights (of the waxing moon) preceding and following the Vâ*g*apeya
ceremony proper, the sacrificer has to perform a number of so-called
pariya*gñ*a ('surrounding or enclosing sacrifices') consisting of
one-day Soma-sacrifices of different kinds, each of which is preceded by
a special dîkshâ, or initiation ceremony (cf. III, 1, 2, 1 seq.; Lâ*t*y.
*S*r. VIII, 11, 2). It is to the ish*t*is (dîksha*n*îyesh*t*i,
prâya*n*îyesh*t*i) of these pariya*gñ*as that the above injunction
regarding the performance of the Sâvitrî âhuti refers.
