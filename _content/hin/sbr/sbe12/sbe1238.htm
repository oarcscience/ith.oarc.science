<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:1">1:9:2:1</A></FONT></span>1. Being about to perform the patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, they betake themselves back to the G&acirc;rhapatya fire. The Adhvaryu takes the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; and sruva, the Hot<I>ri</I> the veda, and the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra the butter-(melting) pot.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:2">1:9:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. Here now the Adhvaryu, according to some, passes the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya on the east side. Let him not, however, do this; for were he to walk on that side, he would be outside the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:3">1:9:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. According to others, the Adhvaryu walks (so as to pass) behind the (sacrificer's) wife&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Let him not, however, do this either; for verily the Adhvaryu is the fore-part, and the wife is the hind-part of the sacrifice: hence, if he were to pass so, it would be as if one were to put his head behind; and he (the Adhvaryu) would be outside the sacrifice.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:4">1:9:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. According to others, the Adhvaryu passes between the wife (and the G&acirc;rhapatya fire). Let him not, however, do this either; for were he to pass that way, he would cut off the wife from the sacrifice. Along the east side of the G&acirc;rhapatya and the inner side of the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya (he passes); for thus he is not outside the sacrifice; and as before, in walking forward (to the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya), he passed along the inner side, so he now also takes that path.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:5">1:9:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. They now perform the patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as. From the sacrifice offspring is assuredly produced; and (that offspring) produced from the sacrifice is produced from union; and (the offspring) produced from union is produced after (in consequence of) the completion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the sacrifice: hence one thereby (i.e. by the patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as) causes that (offspring) to be produced by means of a productive union after the completion of the sacrifice. And so now also offspring is produced by means of a productive union after the completion of the sacrifice. This is why they now perform the patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:6">1:9:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. He makes offering to four deities. Four doubtless means a couple; for a couple means a pair (dvandva, lit. two and two), and two and two indeed they are: thus a productive union is thereby effected; and accordingly he makes offering to four deities.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:7">1:9:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. He makes (the offerings) of butter for sacrificial food. Butter indeed means seed: hence he thereby scatters seed, and therefore makes them of butter for sacrificial food.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:8">1:9:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. In a low voice they engage in this (performance)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Secretly, doubtless, union takes place; and secretly also (takes place) what (is spoken) in a low voice: this is why they perform in a low voice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:9">1:9:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. He first makes offering to Soma. Soma indeed means seed; hence he thereby scatters seed: this is why he makes offering to Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:10">1:9:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. He then makes offering to Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>. Now, it is Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I> who transforms seed which is scattered. Accordingly it is he who transforms the seed now scattered&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: this is why he makes offering to Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:11">1:9:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. He then makes offering to the wives of the gods. In the wives, in the womb, the seed assuredly is planted, and thence it is produced; hence he thereby plants the seed in the wives, in the womb; and thence it is produced: for this reason he makes offering to the wives of the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:12">1:9:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. When he offers to the wives of the gods, he shuts (the fire) out from view on the eastern side; for, up to the time when they offer to the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us, the deities continue waiting, thinking, 'This</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he must offer up to us!' He thereby conceals (this offering) from them; and accordingly Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya says, 'Whenever human women here eat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (they do so) apart from men.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:13">1:9:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. He then makes offering to Agni, the householder. Agni, indeed, is this world: hence it is for this world that he thereby produces offspring and that this offspring is produced: this is why he makes offering to Agni, the householder.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:14">1:9:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. This (ceremony) concludes with the i<I>d</I>&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for here are neither enclosing-sticks nor the prastara-bunch. For on that occasion when he wishes the sacrificer good-speed (svag&acirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by (offering) the prastara, good-speed is at the same time wished to his consort also, since the wife comes (immediately) after the husband. But were he to use a substitute for the prastara-bunch, he would produce lassitude (in the wife): for this reason this (ceremony) should conclude with the i<I>d</I>&acirc;. Nevertheless a substitute for the prastara is (optionally) made.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:15">1:9:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. If he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he thereby wishes the wife good-speed just as</p>

If he choose to use a substitute for the prastara, he plucks out one stalk from the veda, and anoints its top in the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, its middle part in the aruva, and its lower end in the butter-pan.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:17">1:9:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra then says, 'Throw (it) after&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' [The Adhvaryu] having thrown it silently after (the prastara into the fire), touches himself, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 16 f), 'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni, guard mine eye!' and in this way he avoids throwing himself after (the prastara into the fire).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:18">1:9:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. He (the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra) then says (to the Adhvaryu), 'Discourse together!' (The Adhvaryu says), 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agn&icirc;dh?' 'He has gone!' 'Bid (the gods) hear!' 'May (one or they) hear!' 'Good-speed to the divine Hot<I>ri</I>s! Success to the human!' [Then the Adhvaryu to the Hot<I>ri</I>], 'Pronounce the "All-hail and blessing!"'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:19">1:9:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. Thereupon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_611"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he (the Adhvaryu) seizes at the same time the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; and sruva. On the former occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> indeed, by anointing (the prastara), he</p>  
<p>
</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_261"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 261</FONT></A></p>  
<p>made (the sacrificer) an oblation, thus thinking, 'May he go to the world of the gods as an oblation!' For this reason he now seizes the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; and sruva at the same time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:20">1:9:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. He seizes them for Agni, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 20 a), 'O Agni, unimpaired in vigour, far-reacher!' because Agni is immortal, he says, unimpaired in vigour:' and because Agni is farthest-reaching, he says, 'far-reacher&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'--'Guard me from the thunderbolt! guard me from bonds! guard me from defective sacrifice! guard me from noxious food!' he thereby says, 'Protect me from all kinds of injury!'--'Make our nourishment free from poison!'--nourishment means food: 'make our food wholesome, faultless!' this is what he thereby says.--'In the lap, pleasant to sit in;' he thereby says, 'in thyself.'--'Sv&acirc;h&acirc;! V&acirc;<I>t</I>!' since one offers what has been consecrated by vasha<I>t</I>,' this (residue of butter) thereby becomes such for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:21">1:9:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. The mistress then unties the veda-bunch. The altar (vedi) assuredly is female and the veda is male. For union the veda was made: and accordingly when he touches, (the altar) with it during the sacrifice, a union productive of offspring is thereby effected.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:22">1:9:2:22</A></FONT></span>22. And (the reason) why it is the mistress who unties the veda (is this): the mistress is female and the veda is male; consequently a union productive of offspring is thereby effected: this is why the mistress unties the veda.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:23">1:9:2:23</A></FONT></span>23. She unties it. Should she wish to do so</p>

<p><A NAME="page_262"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 262</FONT></A></p>  
<p>with a Ya<I>g</I>us-text, let her do so with this one (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 21 a), 'The Veda art thou: whereby thou, O divine Veda, hast become Veda for the gods, thereby mayest thou become Veda for me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_610"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:24">1:9:2:24</A></FONT></span>24. (The Hot<I>ri</I>) strews it (from the G&acirc;rhapatya) as far as (the east end of) the altar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_615"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for the altar is female and the veda is male; and from behind the male approaches the female: from behind (i.e. west) he accordingly causes it (the altar) to be approached by that male, the veda. For this reason he strews (the grass of the veda) as far as (the east end of) the altar.</p>  <h4 align="center">CONCLUDING CEREMONIES.</h4>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:25">1:9:2:25</A></FONT></span>25. He (the Adhvaryu) now makes the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us-oblation, thinking, 'In the east my sacrifice shall be completed!' Were he to perform the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us-oblation first and then the patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as, that sacrifice of his would be completed in the west (behind the sacrificer)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_616"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: hence he makes</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_263"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 263</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us-oblation at this particular time, thinking, 'In the east my sacrifice shall be completed!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:26">1:9:2:26</A></FONT></span>26. Now as to why it is called samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_617"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: whatever deities he invites through this (new or full-moon) sacrifice, and for whichever deities this sacrifice is performed, all those are thereby 'sacrificed to together' (sam-ish<I>t</I>a); and because he now makes a (butter) oblation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> to all those deities, who have been 'sacrificed to together,' therefore this (oblation) is called samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:27">1:9:2:27</A></FONT></span>27. And again as to why he performs the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us: whatever deities he invites through this sacrifice, and for whichever deities this sacrifice is performed, they continue waiting until the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us is performed, thinking, 'This he must offer to us!' These same (deities) he thereby dismisses in due form; and whatever be the practice in their case in accordance with that he has, in thus performing it, produced the sacrifice, and having thus produced it he now establishes it safely where there is a safe basis for it: this is why he performs the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:28">1:9:2:28</A></FONT></span>28. He makes the offering, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 21 b), 'Ye path-finding gods,'--for the gods</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_264"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 264</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are indeed the finders of the path&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--'Having found the path--,' thereby he says, 'having found the sacrifice;'--'Walk in the path!' thereby he dismisses them in due form;--'O divine Lord of mind, this sacrifice--Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!--give to the wind!' for the sacrifice, indeed, is that blowing one (the wind). Having accordingly prepared this (special) sacrifice, he thereby establishes it safely in that (chief, full or new-moon) sacrifice, and thus unites sacrifice with sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'Sv&acirc;h&acirc;! give (it) to the wind!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:29">1:9:2:29</A></FONT></span>29. He then offers up the barhis, The barhis, truly, is this world, and the barhis (consists of) plants: hence he thereby bestows plants on this world, and these plants are safely established in this world: for this reason he offers up the barhis.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:30">1:9:2:30</A></FONT></span>30. This offering he makes as an additional one, since the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us is the end of the sacrifice, and consequently what comes after the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us is additional; and because, in performing the samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us, he offers to those (deities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), and thence additional unlimited plants are here produced.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:31">1:9:2:31</A></FONT></span>31. He offers it, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 22), 'May the barhis combine with the sacrificial food, with the butter! May Indra combine with the &Acirc;dityas, the Vasus, the Maruts, and the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>!

<p>north side of the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire) to the south, he pours the pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;-water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> out (on the altar). Now, when he spreads the sacrifice, he yokes it. But were he not to pour out (the pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;-water), the sacrifice, being unyoked, would, in moving backward, injure the sacrificer. In this way, however, the sacrifice does not injure the sacrificer; and for this reason he pours out the pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;-water, after walking round to the south.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:33">1:9:2:33</A></FONT></span>33. He pours it out, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 23 a), 'Who&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_623"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> unyokes thee? He unyokes thee! For whom does he unyoke thee? For him he unyokes thee! For plenty!' He thereby announces to the sacrificer the highest prosperity. He pours it out with the same (vessel) with which he brings it forward; for wherewith they yoke the team, therewith they also unyoke it; with the yoke-tie they yoke it, and with the yoke-tie they unyoke it. By means of a potsherd he now throws the refuse from the cleaning of the rice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_624"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> right under the black antelope skin; with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 23 b), 'The Rakshas' share art thou!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:34">1:9:2:34</A></FONT></span>34. Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, were contending about this sacrifice, (that is, their) father Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the year. 'Ours it (he) shall be! ours it shall be,' they said.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:2:35">1:9:2:35</A></FONT></span>35. Thereupon the gods obtained possession of the whole of the sacrifice, and dispossessed those</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (Asuras) of it by (giving them) what was the worst part of the sacrifice, to wit, with the blood of the victim (they dispossessed them) of the animal sacrifice, and with the refuse of the rice of the havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a. 'May they be duly dispossessed of the sacrifice,' they thought for he indeed is duly dispossessed, who is dispossessed even while obtaining a (worthless) share. He, on the other hand, who is dispossessed without any share whatever, hopes for a while, and when it occurs to him, he says, 'What share hast thou given me?' Hence what share the gods set apart for those (Asuras), that same share he now makes over to them in pouring (the refuse of the rice) right under the black antelope skin. He thereby casts it into blind darkness, where there is no (sacrificial) fire. And in the same way he casts the blood of the victim into blind darkness, where there is no fire; thinking, 'Thou art the Rakshas' share!' For this reason they use not the gore of the victim (for sacrificial purposes), since it is the Rakshas' share.</p>

The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra sits down in the same way north of the fire, with his face to the south, and the Hot<I>ri</I> in the middle; cf. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 151.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_601"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_605">258:1</A> The Adhvaryu calls on the Hot<I>ri</I>: 'For Soma (Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, &amp;c. respectively)' (in a low voice)--'recite!' (aloud). The Hot<I>ri</I> then recites the invitatory prayer (anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, for which see &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. I, 10, 5) in a low voice, except the concluding 'om!' which he pronounces aloud. The Adhvaryu now calls on the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra, who responds with 'Astu <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>.' Thereupon the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot<I>ri</I>; 'For Soma,' &amp;c. (in a low voice),--'pronounce the offering prayer!' (aloud); and the Hot<I>ri</I> recites the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, in a low voice, except the concluding 'Vausha<I>t</I>,' which is pronounced aloud, and simultaneously with which the Adhvaryu pours the oblation (consisting of four ladlings of butter from the butter-pot into the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, by means of the sruva) into the fire.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_604"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_608">259:2</A> The i<I>d</I>&acirc;-ceremony (I, 8, 1, 18) is repeated after the patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as, together with the <I>S</I>a<I>m</I>yuv&acirc;ka and the offering of remains, but with special reference to the mistress of the house. Since the prastara-bunch and the enclosing-sticks have already been consumed by the fire, the S&ucirc;ktav&acirc;ka is omitted on the present occasion; the Adhvaryu merely throwing a stalk of the reed-grass of the veda into the fire, as a substitute for the stalk of the prastara (representing the sacrificer).</P>

Dr. Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 160, (after a scholiast) calls this modification Pragraha-homa (offered to Agni adabdh&acirc;yu a<I>s</I>&icirc;tama). According to K&acirc;ty. III, 7, 18; 19, this ceremony is followed by the performance, in the Dakshi<I>n</I>a fire, of two (<I>g</I>uhoti) oblations of butter, to Agni sa<I>m</I>ve<I>s</I>apati and Sarasvat&icirc; respectively (see the formulas V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 20, b, c); and the pish<I>t</I>alepa-&acirc;huti to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>, being an offering of the remnants of dough, left from the preparation of the sacrificial cakes. These offerings would then be succeeded by the ceremonies treated in par. 22 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_609"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_613">261:1</A> Harisv&acirc;min derives a<I>s</I>&icirc;tama and a<I>s</I>ish<I>th</I>a from a<I>s</I>, 'to eat' (instead of from a<I>s</I>, 'to reach, penetrate'), hence 'the greatest eater.' Mah&icirc;dhara gives both derivations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_610"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_614">262:1</A> According to Katy. III, 8, 2, the lady thereupon unties the grass-cord with which she was girt (see I, 3, 1, 12), with the text, 'I free myself from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose wherewith the gracious Savit<I>ri</I> bound me; place me unscathed, together with my husband, in the lap of eternal law, in the world of righteousness!' &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. I, 11, 3, however, assigns this ceremony to the Hot<I>ri</I>; and no doubt rightly, since it is not mentioned by our author, and the V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. does not give the formula. Thereby also the original form of the text (Rig-veda X, 85, 24), 'I free thee,' &amp;c., is preserved. Mah&icirc;dhara on V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. here takes 'veda' either in the sense of 'the Veda (<I>Ri</I>k, &amp;c.),' or as 'the knower.' Perhaps it should rather be taken as 'the obtainer.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_611"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_615">262:2</A> Thus &acirc; vede<I>h</I> is explained by Harisv&acirc;min (according to comm. on Katy. III, 8, 3). Others take it in the sense of 'up to where the barhis begins.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_612"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_616">262:3</A> The patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as were performed in the G&acirc;rhapatya fire, and therefore west of the altar; and on their completion, the priests betake themselves back to the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_613"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_617">263:1</A> The real original meaning of the term would rather seem to have been 'the formula marking the completion of the sacrifice,' it having afterwards come to be applied to the oblation (to the wind-god) itself. Cf. par. 30 and Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, 232,</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_614"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_618">263:2</A> Or rather, 'because to all those deities to whom an ish<I>t</I>i (or ya<I>g</I>ati-offering, made by the Adhvaryu standing south of the altar; and followed or accompanied by the vasha<I>t</I>-call) has been offered in common, he now makes an &acirc;huti (or <I>g</I>uhoti-offering, made by him whilst standing north of the altar, with the sv&acirc;h&acirc;-call).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_615"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_619">264:1</A> Mah&icirc;dhara refers g&acirc;tu-vida<I>h</I> and vittv&acirc; to vid, 'to know.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_616"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_620">264:2</A> According to Harisv&acirc;min, he does so, since that offering is made for the sake of dismissing (satisfying) the deities.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_617"></A><A HREF="sbe1238.htm#fr_621">264:3</A> Mah&icirc;dhara interprets, 'May Indra--together with the &Acirc;dityas, the Vasus, the Maruts, and the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>--anoint the barhis thoroughly with the havis-like ghee,' &amp;c.</P>
