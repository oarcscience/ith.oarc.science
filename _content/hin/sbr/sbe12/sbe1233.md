### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:1">1:7:4:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati conceived a passion for his own

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

daughter,--either the Sky or the Dawn <span
id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_480). 'May I pair with her!' thus (thinking)
he united with her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:2">1:7:4:2</span></span>2. This,
assuredly, was a sin in the eyes of the gods. 'He who acts thus towards
his own daughter, our sister, \[commits a sin\],' they thought.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:3">1:7:4:3</span></span>3. The
gods then said to this god who rules over the beasts (Rudra) <span
id="fr_484"></span>[2](#fn_481), 'This one, surely, commits a sin who
acts thus towards his own daughter, our sister. Pierce him!' Rudra,
taking aim, pierced him. Half of his seed fell to the ground. And thus
it came to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:4">1:7:4:4</span></span>4.
Accordingly it has been said by the *Ri*shi <span
id="fr_485"></span>[3](#fn_482) with reference to that (incident), 'When
the father embraced his daughter, uniting with her, he dropped his seed
on the earth.' This (became) the chant (uktha) called âgnimâruta <span
id="fr_486"></span>[4](#fn_483); in (connection with)

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

this it is set forth how the gods caused that seed to spring <span
id="fr_487"></span>[1](#fn_484). When the anger of the gods subsided,
they cured Pra*g*âpati and cut out that dart of this. (Rudra); for
Pra*g*âpati, doubtless, is this sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:5">1:7:4:5</span></span>5. They
said (to one another), 'Think of some means by which that (part of the
sacrifice torn out with the dart) may not be lost, and how it may be but
a small portion of the offering itself!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:6">1:7:4:6</span></span>6. They
said, 'Take it round to Bhaga (Savit*ri*, the Patron), who sits on the
south side (of the sacrificial ground): Bhaga will eat it by way of
fore-portion <span id="fr_488"></span>[2](#fn_485), so that it may be as
though it were offered.' They accordingly took it round to Bhaga, who
sat on the south side. Bhaga (Savit*ri*) looked at it: it burnt out his
eyes <span id="fr_489"></span>[3](#fn_486). And thus it came to pass.
Hence they say, 'Bhaga is blind.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:7">1:7:4:7</span></span>7. They
said, 'It has not yet become appeased here: take it round to Pûshan!'
They accordingly

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

took it round to Pûshan. Pûshan tasted it: it knocked out his teeth. And
thus it came to pass. Hence they say, 'Pûshan is toothless;' and
therefore, when they prepare a mess of boiled rice (*k*aru) <span
id="fr_490"></span>[1](#fn_487) for Pûshan, they prepare it from ground
rice, as is done for one toothless.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:8">1:7:4:8</span></span>8. They
said, 'It has not yet become appeased here: take it round to
B*ri*haspati <span id="fr_491"></span>[2](#fn_488)!' They accordingly
took it round to B*ri*haspati. B*ri*haspati hasted to Savit*ri* for his
impulsion (influence, prasava <span id="fr_492"></span>[3](#fn_489)),
for assuredly Savit*ri* is the impeller (prasavit*ri*) of the gods.
'Impel (influence) this for me!' he said. Savit*ri*, as the impeller,
accordingly impelled it for him, and being thus impelled by Savit*ri*,
it did not injure him: and thus it was henceforth appeased. This, then,
is essentially the same as the fore-portion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:9">1:7:4:9</span></span>9. Now
when he cuts off the fore-portion, he cuts out what is injured in the
sacrifice,--what belongs to Rudra. Thereupon he touches water: water is
(a means) of lustration, hence he lustrates by means of water <span
id="fr_493"></span>[4](#fn_490). He now cuts off piece by piece the
i*d*â <span id="fr_494"></span>[5](#fn_491), (which represents) cattle.

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:10">1:7:4:10</span></span>10. Let
him cut off (for the fore-portion) ever so small a piece <span
id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_492): thus the dart comes out; let him
therefore cut off ever so small a piece. He should (according to some)
put clarified butter on one side only, either below or above: thus that
which is hard becomes soft and flows forth; and for this reason he
should put butter on one side only, either below or above.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:11">1:7:4:11</span></span>11.
Having (nevertheless <span id="fr_496"></span>[2](#fn_493)) made an
underlayer of butter <span id="fr_497"></span>[3](#fn_494) and a double
cutting from the oblation (havis), he pours butter on the upper side of
it; for it is only in this way that this becomes part of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:12">1:7:4:12</span></span>12. Let
him not carry it (to the Brahman) along the front (east) side of the
Âhavanîya fire); (though) some, it is true, do carry it along the front
side. For on the front side stand the cattle facing the sacrificer:
hence he would impose the power of Rudra on the cattle, if he were to
carry it along the front side, and his (the sacrificer's) household and
cattle would be overwhelmed. Let him therefore cross over in this way
(behind the paridhis); for thus he does not impose Rudra's power on the
cattle and he removes that (dart) sideways <span
id="fr_498"></span>[4](#fn_495).

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:13">1:7:4:13</span></span>13. He
(the Brahman) receives <span id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_496) it, with
the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 11 b, c), 'At the impulse (prasava) of the
divine Savit*ri* I receive thee with the arms of the A*s*vins, with the
hands of Pûshan!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:14">1:7:4:14</span></span>14. And
in like manner as B*ri*haspati then hasted to Savit*ri* for his
impulsion,--for, assuredly, Savit*ri* is the impeller of the gods,--and
said, 'Impel this for me!' and Savit*ri*, the impeller, impelled it for
him; and, impelled by Savit*ri*, it did not injure him; so now also this
one (the Brahman) hastes to Savit*ri* for his impulsion,--for,
assuredly, Savit*ri* is the impeller of the gods,--and says 'impel this
for me!' and Savit*ri*, the impeller, impels it for him; and, impelled
by Savit*ri*, it does not injure him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:15">1:7:4:15</span></span>15. He
eats <span id="fr_500"></span>[2](#fn_497) the fore-portion, with the
text (Vâ;. S. II, 11 d), 'With Agni's mouth I eat thee!' for Agni,
assuredly, it does not injure in any way; and so neither does it injure
him (the Brahman).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:16">1:7:4:16</span></span>16. He
must not chew it with his teeth: 'lest this power of Rudra should injure
my teeth!' so (he thinks), and therefore he must not chew it with his
teeth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:17">1:7:4:17</span></span>17. He
then rinses his mouth with water;--water is (a means of) purification:
hence he purifies himself with water, (that is, a means of)
purification. After he has rinsed the vessel <span
id="fr_501"></span>[3](#fn_498),--

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:18">1:7:4:18</span></span>18.
They bring him the Brahman's portion <span
id="fr_502"></span>[1](#fn_499). The Brahman, in truth, sits south of
the sacrifice, as its guardian. He sits facing that portion. As regards
the fore-portion, that they have already brought to him and he has eaten
it. In the Brahman's portion which they now bring to him, he obtains his
own share; and henceforth he watches what remains incomplete of the
sacrifice: for this reason they bring him the Brahman's portion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:19">1:7:4:19</span></span>19. He
(the Brahman) must maintain silence (from the time he takes his seat on
being elected) <span id="fr_503"></span>[2](#fn_500) up to that speech
(of the Adhvaryu), 'Brahman, shall I step forward?' Those (priests) who,
in the midst of the sacrifice, perform the i*d*â, which represents the
domestic offerings (pâkaya*gñ*a) <span id="fr_504"></span>[3](#fn_501),
tear the sacrifice to pieces, injure it. Now the Brahman, assuredly, is
the best physician: hence the Brahman thereby restores the sacrifice;
but, if he were to sit there talking, he would not restore it: he must
therefore maintain silence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:20">1:7:4:20</span></span>20. If
he should utter any human sound before that time, let him there and then
mutter some *Rik* or Ya*g*us-text addressed to Vish*n*u; for Vish*n*u is

<span id="page_215">p. 215</span>

the sacrifice, so that he thereby again obtains a hold on the sacrifice:
and this is the expiation of that (breach of silence).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:21">1:7:4:21</span></span>21.
When he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Brahman, shall I step forward?' the
Brahman mutters thus (Vâ*g*. S. II, 12), 'This thy sacrifice, O divine
Savit*ri*, they have announced . . .,'--thereby he has recourse to
Savit*ri* for his impulsion (prasava), for he is the impeller
(prasavit*ri*) of the gods;--'to B*ri*haspati, the Brahman,'--for
B*ri*haspati, assuredly, is the Brahman of the gods: hence he announces
that (sacrifice) to him who is the Brahman of the gods; and accordingly
he says, 'to B*ri*haspati, the Brahman.'--'Therefore prosper the
sacrifice, prosper the lord of sacrifice, prosper me!' In this there is
nothing that requires explanation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:7:4:22">1:7:4:22</span></span>22.
\[He continues, Vâ*g*. S. II, 13\]: 'May his mind delight in the gushing
(of the) butter <span id="fr_505"></span>[1](#fn_502)!' By the mind,
assuredly, all this (universe) is obtained (or pervaded, âptam): hence
he thereby obtains this All by the mind.--'May B*ri*haspati spread
(carry through) this sacrifice! May he restore the sacrifice
uninjured!'--he thereby restores what was torn asunder.--'May all the
gods rejoice here!'--'all the gods,' doubtless, means the All: hence he
thereby restores (the sacrifice) by means of the All. He may add, 'Step
forward!' if he choose; or, if he choose, he may omit it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_480"></span>[209:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_483) For other versions
of this legend about Pra*g*âpati (Brahman)'s illicit passion for his
daughter, which, as Dr. Muir suggests, probably refers to some
atmospheric phenomenon, see Ait. Br. III, 33, and Tâ*nd*ya Br. VIII, 2,
10; cf. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 45; I, p. 107. See also
*S*at. Br. II, 1, 2, 9, with note.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[209:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_484) The construction
here is irregular. Perhaps this is part of the speech of the gods, being
a kind of indirect address to Rudra in order to avoid naming the
terrible god. Dr. Muir translates: The gods said, "This god, who rules
over the beasts, commits a transgression in that he acts thus to his own
daughter, our sister: pierce him through."' In the Kâ*n*va MS. some
words seem to have been omitted at this particular place. According to
the Ait. Br., the gods created a god Bhûtavat, composed of the most
fearful forms of theirs. After piercing the incarnation of Pra*g*âpati's
sin, he asked, and obtained, the boon that he should henceforth be the
ruler of cattle.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[209:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_485) Viz., Rig-veda X,
61, 7, where verses 5-7 contain the first allusion to this legend.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[209:4](sbe1233.htm#fr_486) The âgnimâruta is
one of the *s*âstras recited at the evening libation of the
Soma-sacrifice; and made up chiefly of a hymn addressed to Agni
Vai*s*vânara and one to the Maruts; and \[following the stotriya and
anurûpa pragâtha\] a hymn to *G*âtavedas; \[and one to the Âpas,
followed by various detailed <span id="page_210">p. 210</span> verses or
couplets\]; viz., Rig-veda III, 3, 'vai*s*vânarâya p*ri*thupâ*g*ase,'
&c., and I, 87, 'pratvakshasa*h* pratavaso,' &c.; \[Rig-veda I, 168,
1-2, stotriya; VII, 16, II-32, anurûpa\]; and Rig-veda I, 143,
'pratavyasîm navyasîm,' &c. (and X, 9, 'âpo hi sh*th*â mayobhuvas,' &c.)
respectively, at the Agnish*t*oma (and first day of the dvâda*s*âha).
See Â*s*v. *S*r. V, 20, 5; Ait. Br. III, 35; IV, 30.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[210:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_487) According to Ait.
Br. III, 35, where this legend is also given in connection with the
âgnimâruta *s*âstra, Agni Vai*s*vânara, aided by the Maruts, stirred
(and heated) the seed; and out of it sprang successively Âditya (the
sun), Bh*ri*gu, and the Âdityas; whilst the coals (aṅgâra) remaining
behind became the Aṅgiras, and B*ri*haspati, and the coal dust, the
burnt earth and ashes were changed into various kinds of animals.
According to Harisvâmin it would seem that our passage has to he
understood to the effect that the composition of the âgnimâruta *s*âstra
shows the order of beings which the gods caused to spring forth from the
seed. See also IV, 5, I, 8.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[210:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_488) See note on I, 7,
4, 18.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[210:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_489) 'Nirdadâha.' The
Kaushît. Br. VI, 10 (Ind. Stud. II, 306) and Yâska Nir. 1 2, 14 have
nir*g*aghâna, 'it knocked out his eyes.' The Kaushît. Br. also makes
them first take the prâ*s*itra to Savit*ri*, and when it cut his hands,
they gave him two golden ones.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[211:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_490) *K*aru, in the
ordinary sense of the word, is a potful of rice (barley, &c.) grains
boiled, or rather steamed (antarûshmapakva), so as to remain whole, as
in Indian curry. Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 216.

<span id="fn_488"></span>[211:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_491) According to
Kaushît. Br. VI, 10, they took it from Pûshan to Indra, as the mightiest
and-strongest of the gods; and he appeased it with prayer (brahman);
whence the Brahman (in taking the prâ*s*itra) says, 'Indra is Brahman.'
Weber, Ind. Stud. II, p. 307.

<span id="fn_489"></span>[211:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_492) The consistent use
of derivations from one and the same root (pra-su) in this and similar
passages is, of course, quite as artificial in Sanskrit as must be any
imitation of it in English.

<span id="fn_490"></span>[211:4](sbe1233.htm#fr_493) He thereby averts
the evil effects of the act which is connected with Rudra, 'the terrible
god;' see [p. 2](sbe1203.htm#page_2), note [2](sbe1203.htm#fn_84).
Besides, the i*d*â with which he now proceeds representing the cattle,
he thereby guards the cattle from the rudriya, cf. above I, 7, 3, 21.

<span id="fn_491"></span>[211:5](sbe1233.htm#fr_494) See I, 8, 1, 12,
13.

<span id="fn_492"></span>[212:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_495) According to Kâty.
III, 4, 7, the prâ*s*itra, or (Brahman's) fore-portion, is to be of the
size of a barley-corn or a pippala (Ficus Religiosa) berry.

<span id="fn_493"></span>[212:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_496) There is no
indication in the text of two different practices being here referred
to. The Kâ*n*va recension, however, puts in here, 'but let him not do
so,' which is evidently understood in our text also.

<span id="fn_494"></span>[212:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_497) Viz. in the
prâ*s*itrahara*n*a, or pan which is to receive the Brahman's portion.
The hollow part of the vessel is to be either of the shape of a
(hand-)mirror, i.e. with a round bowl, or of that of a *k*amasa or jug,
i.e. with a square bowl ([p. 7](sbe1203.htm#page_7), note
[1](sbe1203.htm#fn_90)). Kâty. I, 3, 40, 42. On the underlayer' of
butter, see I, 7, 2, 8.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[212:4](sbe1233.htm#fr_498) 'Tiryag evaina*m*
nirmimîte.' I am in doubt as to whether <span id="page_213">p.
213</span> enam (which is omitted in the Kâ*n*va text) really refers to
Rudra's dart. Cf. par. 9.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[213:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_499) According to Kâty.
II, 2, 15, he first looks at it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. p. 58): 'With
Mitra's eye I look on thee!'

<span id="fn_497"></span>[213:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_500) According to Kâty.
II, 2, 17, he previously puts it down on the shoulder of the altar, with
the text (Vâ*g*. S. p. 58), 'I put you down, on the navel of the earth,
in the lap of Aditi!' According to 19, however, this is optional (except
when the Brahman does not eat the prâ*s*itra immediately).

<span id="fn_498"></span>[213:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_501) According to Kâty.
II, 2, 20, the Brahman, having rinsed the <span id="page_214">p.
214</span> vessel \[or, according to the comment, the two
prâ*s*itrahara*n*a, one of which is used as lid to the other\], touches
his navel, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. p. 58), 'May the deities there are
in the waters purify this! Enter the stomach of Indra, being offered
with "Hail!" Mix not with my food! Settle down above my navel! In
Indra's stomach I make thee settle!'

<span id="fn_499"></span>[214:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_502) The Brahman's
regular portion (brahmabhâga) of the sacrificial food is cut, like the
prâ*s*itra or fore-portion (which apparently he receives as the
representative of B*ri*haspati), from Agni's cake.

<span id="fn_500"></span>[214:2](sbe1233.htm#fr_503) See I, 1, 4, 9.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[214:3](sbe1233.htm#fr_504) According to the
scholiast, it represents the pâkaya*gñ*a or domestic (cooked) offerings,
because at the latter, as in the i*d*â, the remains of the offerings are
eaten.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[215:1](sbe1233.htm#fr_505) ? 'Mano *g*ûtir
\[*g*yotir, Kâ*n*va rec.\] *g*ushatâm â*g*yasya.' I am inclined to read
*g*ûter \[cf. Ath.-veda XIX, 58, 1: gh*ri*tasya *g*ûti*h* samânâ\].
Mahîdhara interprets: 'May the rushing (eager) mind devote itself to the
butter!' Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollmondsopfer, p. 135, apparently
proposes to combine mano*g*ûtir 'des Geistes Schnelligkeit.' Perhaps
*g*ushatâm has to be taken in a transitive sense: 'May the gushing of
the butter delight the mind.'
