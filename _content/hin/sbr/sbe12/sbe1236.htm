Thus he does at the full-moon sacrifice, because the full-moon offering belongs to Agni and Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:3">1:8:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. At the new-moon sacrifice, on the other hand, he uses the texts (ib. c, d), 'May I be victorious after the victory of Indra and Agni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>! with the impetus of the food I urge myself on;' and, 'May Indra and Agni drive him away who hates us, and whom we hate! with the impetus of the food I drive him away:'--Thus, if the sacrificer himself does it.</p>

<p>offering belongs to Indra and Agni. And in this manner he separates (the spoons) according to the respective deities, This is why he thus separates them:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:5">1:8:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. Behind the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; stands the sacrificer, and behind the upabh<I>ri</I>t stands he who means evil to him: hereby, then, he brings the sacrificer forward to the front (or east), and the one who means evil him he drives back (or towards the west). Behind the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; stands the eater (enjoyer), and behind the upabh<I>ri</I>t the one to be eaten (enjoyed): thus he now brings the eater (enjoyer) to the front, and the one to be eaten (enjoyed) he drives back.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:6">1:8:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. Thus the separation (of the eater and the eaten) is effected in one and the same act; and hence from one and the same man spring both the enjoyer (the husband), and the one to be enjoyed (the wife): for now kinsfolk (g&acirc;ty&acirc;<I>h</I>) live sporting and rejoicing together, saying, 'In the fourth (or) third man (I.e. generation) we unite&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' And this is so in accordance with that (separation of the spoons).</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:7">1:8:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. Thereupon (the Adhvaryu) anoints the enclosing-sticks (paridhi) with (the butter attaching to) the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;. With that (spoon) with which he has made offering to the gods, with which he has concluded the sacrifice, he thus gratifies the enclosing-sticks: this is why he anoints them with the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:8">1:8:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. He anoints them (successively)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_561"></A><A HREF="#fn_557"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with the texts (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 16 a-c), 'For the Vasus thee!' 'For the Rudras thee!' 'For the &Acirc;dityas thee!' For these--to wit, the Vasus, Rudras, and &Acirc;dityas--are three (classes of) gods: 'for them (I anoint) thee,' he thereby says.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:9">1:8:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. Thereupon, taking hold of the (middle) enclosing-stick, he calls (on the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra) to bid (them) listen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: thus (i.e. by touching the paridhi) it is for the enclosing-sticks that he calls for the <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>. The <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>-call assuredly is the sacrifice: hence he thereby expressly gladdens the enclosing-sticks by means of the sacrifice: for this reason he calls for the <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>, while taking hold of the enclosing-stick.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:10">1:8:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Having called for the <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I> (and been responded to by the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra), he thus addresses (the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'The divine Hot<I>ri</I>s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are summoned--,' the divine Hot<I>ri</I>s, namely, are (represented by) these</p>

<p>enclosing-sticks, since these are Agnis (fires)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_560"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. When he says, 'the divine Hot<I>ri</I>s are summoned (ishita),' he means to say, 'the divine Hot<I>ri</I>s are wished for (ish<I>t</I>a).' [He continues], '--for the proclamation of success&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_561"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,'--for on this the gods themselves are indeed intent, to wit, that they should speak what is favourable (conducive to success, s&acirc;dhu), that they should do what is favourable: hence he says 'for the proclamation of success.'--'The human one is called upon for the song of praise (s&ucirc;ktav&acirc;ka)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!' by these words he urges on this human Hot<I>ri</I> to singing praises.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:11">1:8:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. He now takes the prastara-bunch&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_563"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The prastara assuredly is the sacrificer: hence whithersoever his sacrifice went, thither he thereby wishes him good-speed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>! Now it is to the world of the gods that his sacrifice went; and to the world of the gods accordingly he thereby takes the sacrificer.</p>

II, 16 d), 'Be ye in harmony with each other, O heaven and earth!' for when heaven and earth are in harmony with each other, then indeed it rains&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: for this reason he says, 'be ye in harmony with each other, O heaven and earth!'--'May Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a favour thee with rain!' whereby he says, 'may he who rules over the rain favour thee with rain!' Now he that rules over the rain is undoubtedly that blowing one (V&acirc;yu, the wind); and he, it is true, blows as one only; but, on entering into man, he becomes a forward and a backward moving one; and they are these two, the out-breathing and the in-breathing. And Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a assuredly are the out-breathing and in-breathing; and hence he says by that (prayer), 'may he who rules over the rain favour thee with rain!' Let him then take it up, with this text, for then the rain will at all times be propitious. He anoints it (the prastara): thereby he makes him (the sacrificer) an oblation, thinking, 'May he, as an oblation, go to the world of the gods!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:13">1:8:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. He anoints the top (of the prastara with the butter) in the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;, the middle part (with that) in the upabh<I>ri</I>t, and the lower end (with that) in the dhruv&acirc;; for the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; is, as it were, the top, the upabh<I>ri</I>t the middle, and the dhruv&acirc; the root.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:14">1:8:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. He anoints (each time), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 16 e), 'May (the gods) eat, licking the anointed bird&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' He thereby causes it (the prastara and hence symbolically the sacrificer) to be a bird and fly up from this world of men to the world of the gods. He then draws it twice (towards the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya) alow (near the ground). The reason why he must draw it alow (is this): the prastara is the sacrificer; and in this way he does not remove him from this firm footing of his; and he, moreover, secures rain for this locality.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:15">1:8:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. He draws it along, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 16 f), 'Go to the spotted (mares) of the Maruts!' He means to say, 'Go to the world of the gods,' when he says, 'Go to the spotted (mares) of the Maruts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!'--'Having become a spotted cow, go to the sky and thence bring us rain hither!' The spotted cow, doubtless, is this (earth): whatever rooted and rootless food is here on this (earth), by that this (earth) is a spotted cow. 'Having become</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A></p>  
<p>this (earth), go thou to the sky!' this is what he thereby says. 'Thence bring us rain hither!' From rain certainly spring vigour, sap, well-being: for this reason he says, 'thence bring us rain hither!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:16">1:8:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. He then takes a single stalk from it. The prastara-bunch is the sacrificer; and therefore, if he were to throw the whole prastara (at once) into the fire, the sacrificer would speedily go to yonder world. In this way, however, the sacrificer will live long; and what the full measure of human life here on earth is, for that he takes this (single stalk) therefrom.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:17">1:8:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. Having held (the prastara) for a moment, he throws it into the fire: whither his (the sacrificer's) one (part of) self (or, body)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> went, thither he thereby causes it to go&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. But were he not to throw it into the fire, he would cut off the sacrificer from (yonder) world. In this way, however, he does not cut off the sacrificer from (yonder) world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:18">1:8:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. He throws it (with its top) to the east, for the east is the region of the gods; or to the north, for the north is the region of man. With the fingers only they should smooth it down, not with pieces of wood; since it is with sticks that they pierce any other corpse. Fearing, lest they should treat it in the same way as any other corpse, they should smooth it down with the fingers only, not with pieces of wood. When the Hot<I>ri</I> recites the song of praise,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:19">1:8:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra says (to the Adhvaryu), 'Throw</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (the single stalk) after (the prastara)!'--'whither his (the sacrificer's) other self went, thither make it now go,' this is what he thereby says. [The Adhvaryu] having thrown it silently after, touches himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 16 f): 'Guardian of the eye art thou, O Agni; guard mine eye!' In this way also he does not throw himself into the fire after (the prastara or sacrificer).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:20">1:8:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. He (the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra) then says&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (to the Adhvaryu), 'Discourse together!'--he thereby says, 'Make him (the sacrificer) discourse with the gods.' [The Adhvaryu asks], 'Has he gone (to the gods), Agn&icirc;dh?' whereby he says, 'Has he really gone?'--'He has gone!' replies the other.--'Bid (the gods) hear!' by these words he (the Adhvaryu) means to say, 'Make him (the sacrificer) be heard, make him be noticed by the gods!'--'May (one or they) hear (srausha<I>t</I>)!' thereby he (the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra) means to say, 'They know him, they have recognised him.' Thus the Adhvaryu and the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra lead the sacrificer to the world of the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:21">1:8:3:21</A></FONT></span>21. He (the Adhvaryu) then says, 'Good-speed to the divine Hot<I>ri</I>s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!' The divine Hot<I>ri</I>s assuredly are these enclosing-sticks, since these are Agnis (fires): it is to them that he thereby bids good-speed, and therefore he says, 'good-speed to the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A></p>  
<p>divine Hot<I>ri</I>s!'--'Success (svasti) to the human!' thereby he desires that this human Hot<I>ri</I> may not fail.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:22">1:8:3:22</A></FONT></span>22. He now throws the enclosing-sticks into the fire. The middle enclosing-stick he throws first, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 17 a), 'The stick which thou laidst around thee, O divine Agni, when thou wert concealed by the Pa<I>n</I>is, I bring thee for thy pleasure; may it not prove faithless to thee!'--With (ib. b), 'Approach ye the place beloved of Agni!' he throws the two others after it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:23">1:8:3:23</A></FONT></span>23. He then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> seizes the <I>g</I>uha and the upabh<I>ri</I>t at the same time. For on the former occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, when he anoints (the prastara sacrificer), he makes him an oblation, thinking, 'May he, as an oblation, go to the world of the gods!' for this reason he seizes the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; and the upabh<I>ri</I>t at the same time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:24">1:8:3:24</A></FONT></span>24. He seizes them for the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I> (the All-gods). For, assuredly, when any sacrificial food is taken without being announced to any one deity, then all the gods think that they have a share in it. Now when he takes that sacrificial food, the (residue of) butter, he does not announce it to any one deity; and hence he takes up (the two spoons) for the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>, and thus makes that (residue of butter) the vai<I>s</I>vadeva&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> at the havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:25">1:8:3:25</A></FONT></span>25. He seizes them, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 18),</p>

For whomsoever they take the sacrificial food from a cart, for him they unyoke (the spoons, by placing them) on the yoke of that cart, thinking, 'Where we yoke, there we also unyoke&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>;' for from the same place where they yoke, they also unyoke. For him, on the other hand, for whom they take it from a jar, (they unyoke the spoons, by placing them) on the wooden sword, thinking, 'Where we yoke, there we also unyoke;' for from the same place where they yoke, they also unyoke.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:3:27">1:8:3:27</A></FONT></span>27. Yoke-fellows, indeed, are these two spoons for the sacrifice: he yokes them when he starts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (or,</p>

<p>first uses them). Now, were he only to release (unyoke) either of them after putting it down, it would fall down just as a draught animal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (would, if made to lie down before being unyoked). At the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t these two undergo an unyoking: he then lays them down, and so unyokes them. He then yokes them again, at the after-offerings. Having performed the after-offerings, he effects another unyoking: he lays them down, and so unyokes them. Thereupon he yokes them again when he seizes them both at the same time; and when he has travelled over the way for which he has yoked them, he unyokes them. After the sacrifice offspring (is produced). Hence this man yokes (unites), and then unyokes, and again yokes them; and when he has travelled over the way for which he yoked them, he finally unyokes them. He lays (the spoons) down, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 19 a), 'Fond of butter are ye; protect the two yoke-fellows! gracious are ye: lead me to grace!' whereby he says, 'good are ye: lead me to goodness!'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_554"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_558">237:1</A> In Taitt. Br. III, 3, 9 a different symbolical explanation is given of the separation of the spoons: it is said there that by shifting the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc; eastwards, he drives away the enemies that have been born; and by shifting the upabh<I>ri</I>t towards the west, he drives away those that will be born hereafter; and the sacrificer then stands firmly established in this world.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_556"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_560">238:1</A> This passage is of considerable importance, as showing that the prohibition of intermarriage between near blood-relations,--so rigidly enforced in later times, and already formulated in passages such as &Acirc;past. Dharm. II, 5, 15, 16, 'One must not give one's daughter to a man belonging to the same gotra. Nor to one related (within six degrees) on the mother's (or father's) side.' Gobh. III, 4, 3-5, 'One must take for one's wife one who is not of the same gotra, or one who is not sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a to one's mother,'--was not as yet firmly established in our author's time. Harisv&acirc;min remarks on our text, that the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas allow intermarriage in such cases from the third generation--(the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text of the <I>S</I>at. Br. reads, 'In the third man we unite, in the fourth man we unite')--and the Saur&acirc;sh<I>t</I>ras from the fourth generation; and that the D&acirc;kshi<I>n</I>&acirc;tyas allow marriage with daughters of the mother's brother, <A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A> and with sons of the father's sister.

<P><A NAME="fn_566"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_570">242:1</A> Vyantu vayo &#8217;kta<I>m</I> rih&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>. Mah&icirc;dhara interprets it, 'May the birds (i.e. the metres) go (? to heaven,--taking and) licking the anointed (prastara).' The K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas read, 'vyantu vayo ripto rih&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>.' The Black Ya<I>g</I>us (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, 1) has 'akta<I>m</I> rih&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc; viyantu vaya<I>h</I>, pra<I>g</I>&acirc;<I>m</I> yoni<I>m</I> m&acirc; nirm<I>ri</I>ksham, &acirc;py&acirc;yant&acirc;m &acirc;pa oshadhaya<I>h</I>,' which S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a explains by 'May the birds having licked the anointed (top) go their several ways,' &amp;c.; and the Taitt. Br. III, 3, 9, 3 remarks to viyantu vaya<I>h</I>, 'Having made him birds, he makes him go to the heavenly world.' According to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, the three above formulas are by &Acirc;pastamba referred to the three acts of anointing, whereas the others, he says, divide the first formula into two, and use the second one (pra<I>g</I>&acirc;m, &amp;c.) while the lower part of the prastara is anointed. See, however, Hillebrandt, Neu- and Vollm. p. 142, note 3.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_567"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_571">242:2</A> The Black Ya<I>g</I>us (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13) has, 'The spotted (mares) of the Maruts are ye (O plants)!'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_569"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_573">243:2</A> That is to say, he makes sure that the sacrificer has really obtained the object for which the sacrifice was undertaken,--the right to go to the heavenly world after his death.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_570"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_574">244:1</A> He touches himself near the heart, or, according to Vaidyan&acirc;tha, he touches his eyes. After this he has, as usual, to touch the lustral water. See <A HREF="sbe1203.htm#page_2">p. 2</A>, note <A HREF="sbe1203.htm#fn_84">2</A>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_572"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_576">244:3</A> 'Svag&acirc;&acute; da&iacute;vy&acirc; h&ocirc;t<I>ri</I>bhya<I>h</I>.' The form daivy&acirc; seems to have become fixed before hot<I>ri</I>, in consequence of its frequent use, especially in the &Acirc;pr&icirc; hymns, as nom. acc. dual da&iacute;vy&acirc; h&oacute;t&acirc;r&acirc;; and in the invocation of the I<I>d</I>&acirc;, as nom. plur. da&iacute;vy&acirc; h&oacute;t&acirc;ra<I>h</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_575"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_579">245:3</A> The author again connects the havis-offering with the more solemn Soma-sacrifice; the third, or evening, libation of Soma being supposed to belong to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>; cf. V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIX, 26; Ait. Br. VI, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_576"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_580">246:1</A> Paridhey&acirc;<I>h</I>, literally 'ye who are to be laid around;' according to Mah&icirc;dhara = paridhibhav&acirc;<I>h</I>. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text has paridhaya<I>h</I>, 'enclosing-sticks.' The Black Ya<I>g</I>us (Taitt. S. I, 1, 13, 2) has 'barhishada<I>h</I> (sitting on the Barhis)' instead.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_577"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_581">246:2</A> The original meaning of this sacrificial call, as of the apparently allied vasha<I>t</I>, vausha<I>t</I>, appears to be, 'May he (Agni) carry it (the oblation to the deity)!' Cf. <A HREF="sbe1214.htm#page_88">p. 88</A>, note <A HREF="sbe1214.htm#fn_254">2</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_578"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_582">246:3</A> See I, 1, 2, 8.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_579"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_583">246:4</A> This seems to refer to the time when he gets the spoons ready for their sacred use. He then wipes them with sacrificial grass; that is, he, as it were, rubs down the horses before starting on his journey to the world of the gods. See <A HREF="sbe1212.htm#page_68">p. 68</A>, note <A HREF="sbe1212.htm#fn_208">1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_580"></A><A HREF="sbe1236.htm#fr_584">247:1</A> I adopt the interpretation of Harisv&acirc;min, who translates av&acirc;r<I>kh</I>et by adha<I>h</I> patet. The St. Petersb. Dict. apparently proposes, 'he would unharness them, as he would unharness a horse (or team).' According to Harisv&acirc;min, the author here controverts the view of the Karakas (<I>k</I>araka<I>s</I>ruti), who apparently taught that the (symbolical) unharnessing of the spoons should succeed their being laid down on the yoke; while our author maintains that the unharnessing should precede the laying down.</P>
