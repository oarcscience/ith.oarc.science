### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:1">2:4:1:1</span></span>1. Now
after the performance of the Agnihotra he (optionally <span
id="fr_792"></span>[2](#fn_788)) .approaches the fires with (Vâ*g*. S.
III, 37), 'Earth! ether! sky!' In saying 'Earth! ether! sky!' he renders
his speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that (speech) thus
rendered propitious he invokes a blessing:--'May I be well supplied with
offspring!' whereby he prays for offspring; '--well supplied with men!'
whereby he prays for men (heroes); '--well supplied with viands!'
whereby he prays for prosperity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:2">2:4:1:2</span></span>2. That
long (form of) fire-worship is a prayer for blessing, and so is this
(short) one a prayer for blessing: hence even with this much he obtains
all, and he may therefore worship the fires with it. 'Therewith, indeed,
we perform,' so spake Âsuri.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:3">2:4:1:3</span></span>3. Now,
when he is about to set out on a journey <span
id="fr_793"></span>[3](#fn_789), he approaches first the Gârhapatya, and
thereupon the Âhavanîya.

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:4">2:4:1:4</span></span>4. The
Gârhapatya he approaches with the text (Vâ*g*. S. III, 37 b seq.),
'Thou, that art friendly to man, protect my offspring!' He (Agni
Gârhapatya), truly, is the guardian of offspring; and therefore he now
makes over to him his offspring for protection.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:5">2:4:1:5</span></span>5. He
then approaches the Âhavanîya, with 'Thou, that art worthy of praise,
protect my cattle!' He (Agni), truly, is the guardian of cattle, and
therefore he now makes over to him his cattle for protection <span
id="fr_794"></span>[1](#fn_790).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:6">2:4:1:6</span></span>6.
Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he
considers to be the boundary <span id="fr_795"></span>[2](#fn_791), he
breaks silence. And when he returns from his journey he maintains
silence from the moment he sees what he considers to be the boundary.
And even though there be a king inside (one's house), one must not go to
him (or any other person before one has rendered homage to the fires).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:7">2:4:1:7</span></span>7. He
first approaches the Âhavanîya fire, and thereupon the Gârhapatya. The
Gârhapatya doubtless is a house (g*ri*hâ*h*), and a house is a safe
resting-place: so that he thereby (finally <span
id="fr_796"></span>[3](#fn_792)) establishes himself in a house, that
is, in a safe resting-place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:8">2:4:1:8</span></span>8. He
approaches the Âhavanîya fire, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. III, 38 seq.),
'We have approached (thee), the all-knowing, the most liberal dispenser
of

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

goods: O Agni, sovereign lord, bestow on us lustre and strength!' Having
then sat down he sweeps the blades of grass <span
id="fr_797"></span>[1](#fn_793) (into the fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:9">2:4:1:9</span></span>9.
Thereupon he approaches the Gârhapatya, with the text, 'He, Agni
Gârhapatya, is the lord of the house, the most liberal dispenser of
goods to our offspring: O Agni, lord of the house, bestow on us lustre
and strength!' Having then sat down, he sweeps off the blades of grass.
In this way (householders) mostly approach the fires with muttered
prayer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:10">2:4:1:10</span></span>10.
However, one may also approach the fires silently,--and that for this
reason:--If in the place (where one lives), a Brâhman or noble--in
short, a better man--resides, one dares not say to him, 'I am going on a
journey, take care of this (property) of mine <span
id="fr_798"></span>[2](#fn_794)!' Now in this (sacrificial ground) one's
betters indeed reside, viz. the divine Agnis: who, then, would dare to
say to them, 'I am going on a journey, take ye care of this (property)
of mine!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:11">2:4:1:11</span></span>11. The
gods assuredly see through the mind of man: that (Agni) Gârhapatya
therefore knows that he (the householder) now approaches in order to
give

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

himself up to him. Silently he approaches the Âhavanîya fire: that
(Agni) Âhavanîya knows that he now approaches in order to give himself
up to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:12">2:4:1:12</span></span>12.
Thereupon he walks or drives off; and having got as far as what he
considers the boundary line, he releases his speech. And when he returns
from the journey, he maintains silence from the moment he sees what he
considers to be the boundary. And even though there be a king inside
(one's house), one must not go to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:13">2:4:1:13</span></span>13. He
first approaches the Âhavanîya, and thereupon the Gârhapatya. Silently
he approaches the Âhavanîya; and silently he sits down and sweeps away
the grass-blades. Silently he approaches the Gârhapatya; and silently he
sits down and sweeps away the grass-blades.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:4:1:14">2:4:1:14</span></span>14.
Then as to the observances in regard to (the entering of) his house. Now
when a householder comes home from a journey, his house trembles greatly
for fear of him, thinking, 'What will he say here? what will he do
here?' It is therefore for fear of him that speaks or does anything on
this occasion that the house trembles and is liable to crush his family;
but him who neither speaks nor does anything, his house receives with
confidence, thinking, 'He has not spoken here, he has not done anything
here!' And should he be ever so angry at anything on this occasion, let
him rather do on the next day whatever he might wish to say or do. This
then is the observance in regard to the house <span
id="fr_799"></span>[1](#fn_795).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_787"></span>[357:1](sbe1251.htm#fr_791) See I, 9, 3, 21

<span id="fn_788"></span>[357:2](sbe1252.htm#fr_792) For this shorter
form of worshipping the fires, see [p. 349](sbe1251.htm#page_349), note
[2](sbe1251.htm#fn_781).

<span id="fn_789"></span>[357:3](sbe1252.htm#fr_793) That is, a journey
which will compel him to pass the night beyond the village boundary.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[358:1](sbe1252.htm#fr_794) The Vâ*g*. S. gives
also the formulas with which the Dakshi*n*âgni should be approached,
after the other two fires, by the householder, both in starting on, and
returning from, his journey. See Kâty. IV, 12, 13; 18. The Kâ*n*va text
does not allude to the Dakshi*n*a fire any more than ours.

<span id="fn_791"></span>[358:2](sbe1252.htm#fr_795) According to the
Paddhati on Katy. IV, 12, he has to maintain silence as long as he can
see the roof of one of his fire-houses; but according to the
*S*âṅkhâyana *s*âkhâ he has to do so only as long as he can see one of
the fires.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[358:3](sbe1252.htm#fr_796) The Kâ*n*va text
reads 'antata*h*.'

<span id="fn_793"></span>[359:1](sbe1252.htm#fr_797) According to Kâty.
IV, 12, 18-19 he \[after performing ablutions, and lustrating the
Âhavanîya and Dakshi*n*a fire-places, and taking out these fires from
the Gârhapatya\] approaches the Âhavanîya, while holding pieces of
fire-wood in his hand, and mutters the formula given above. He then sits
down and silently puts on the fire a piece of wood and the grass that
has fallen around the fire. According to the Kâ*n*va text he mutters the
second half of the formula ('O Agni,' &c.) while sweeping the grass
(into the fire).

<span id="fn_794"></span>[359:2](sbe1252.htm#fr_798) In Taitt. Br. I, 1,
10, 6, a householder who is about to start on a journey is apparently
recommended to entrust his house to a Brâhman, who may be staying in it.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[360:1](sbe1252.htm#fr_799) The Kâ*n*va text
here adds the formulas Vâ*g*. S. III, 41-43, lines 1 and 2, wherewith he
approaches (upatish*th*ate) the house. See Katy. IV, 12, 22. According
to Katy. ib. 23, he then enters <span id="page_361">p. 361</span> the
house with the formula Vâ*g*. S. III, 43, line 3, 'For safety, for peace
I resort to thee: be there kindliness, happiness, all-hail, and
blessing!' Thereupon, according to the Schol., he is to proceed in
accordance with the rules laid down in the G*ri*hya-sûtras; cf. Pârask.
G. I, 18; Â*s*v. G. I, 15, 9.
