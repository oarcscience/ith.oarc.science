Now the one (viz. the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra) puts the potsherds on (the G&acirc;rhapatya fire); the other (viz. the Adhvaryu) the two mill-stones (on the black antelope skin): these two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why they are done simultaneously (is this):</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:2">1:2:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. The head of this sacrifice is (represented by) the rice-cake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: for those potsherds (kap&acirc;la), no doubt, are to this (rice-cake) what the skull bones (kap&acirc;la) are to the head, and the ground rice is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>nothing else than the brain. Now this (combination of skull and brain) certainly forms one limb: 'Let us put that (which is) one together! Let us make it one!' thus they think; and therefore the two acts are done simultaneously.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:3">1:2:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. He who puts the potsherds on (the fire), takes the shovelling-stick (upavesha), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 17 a): 'Bold (dh<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i) art thou!' For since with it he, as it were, attacks the fire boldly, therefore it is called dh<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And since with it he touches (the coals) at the sacrifice, since with it he attends to (upa-vish) this (G&acirc;rhapatya fire), therefore it is called upavesha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:4">1:2:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. With it he shifts the coals to the fore-part&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (of the khara or hearth-mound), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 17 b): 'O fire! cast off the fire that eateth raw flesh! drive away the corpse-eating one!' For the raw flesh-eating (fire) is the one with which men cook what they eat; and the corpse-eating one is that on which they burn (the dead) man: these two he thereby expels from it (the G&acirc;rhapatya).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:5">1:2:1:5</A></FONT></span>5.

<p><A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:6">1:2:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. On it he places the central potsherd&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. For</p>

<p><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were in fear of a disturbance from the Asuras and Rakshas. They were afraid lest those evil spirits, the Rakshas, might rise from below them. Now Agni (fire) is the repeller of the Rakshas, and for this reason he thus places (the potsherd) on it. The reason why it is just this (coal) and no other (on which the potsherd is put) is, that this one, having been consecrated by the (above) sacrificial formula, is sacrificially pure: that is why he places the central potsherd on it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:7">1:2:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. He puts it on, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 17 d): 'Thou art firm; make thou the earth firm!' For under the form of the earth he renders this same (sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds: 'Thee, devoted to the Brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the (sacrificer's) kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!' Manifold, indeed, are the prayers for blessing in the sacrificial texts (ya<I>g</I>us): by this one he prays for the priestly and military orders, those two towers of strength (vi rye, energies)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 'Thee, devoted to the (sacrificer's) kinsmen,' he says, because kinsmen mean wealth, and wealth he thereby prays for. When he says, 'I put thee on for the destruction of the enemy,' whether or not he wishes to exorcise, let him say, 'for the destruction of so</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and so!' The moment it (the potsherd) has been put down (and while it is still being touched) with the (fore-)finger of his left hand,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:8">1:2:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. He seizes a (second) coal, lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should in the meantime rush in here. For the Br&acirc;hman is the repeller of the Rakshas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: hence, the moment it (the potsherd) has been put down (and while it is still being touched) with the finger of his left hand,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:9">1:2:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. He pushes the coal on it, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 18 a): 'Accept, O Agni, this holy work (brahman)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' He says this, lest the evil spirits, the Rakshas, should rush in here before; for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas: this is the reason why he pushes it on (the potsherd).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:10">1:2:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. He then puts on that (potsherd) which is (to stand) behind (or west of the first or central one), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 18 b): 'A support art thou! make firm the a&euml;rial region!' Under the form of the atmosphere he makes this (sacrifice) firm; by this he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds: 'Thee, devoted to the brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the (sacrificer's) kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:11">1:2:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. He then puts on that one which is (to stand) before (i.e. east of the first potsherd), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 18 c): 'A stay art thou! do thou make firm the sky!' Under the form of the sky he makes this same (sacrifice) firm; by it he chases away the spiteful enemy. He adds: 'Thee, devoted to the brahman, devoted to the kshatra, devoted to the kinsmen, I put on for the destruction of the enemy!'</p>

He now puts on the one that is (to stand) on the right (i.e. south of the first), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 18 d): 'For all the regions I put thee on!' What fourth (world) there is or is not beyond these (three) worlds, by that indeed he thereby chases away the spiteful enemy. Uncertain, no doubt, is what fourth (world) there is or is not beyond these (three) worlds, and uncertain also are all those regions; for this reason he says, 'For all the regions I put thee on!' The remaining potsherds he puts on&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> either silently, or with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:13">1:2:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. He then covers them over with (hot) coals, whilst muttering the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 18 f): 'May ye be heated with the heat of the Bh<I>ri</I>gus and</p>

He covers them with the view that 'they shall be well heated.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:14">1:2:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. Now he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_152"></A><A HREF="#fn_152"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who puts the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin), (in the first place) takes up the black antelope skin, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 19): 'Bliss-bestowing art thou!' He shakes it, with the text (ib.): 'Shaken off is the Rakshas, shaken off are the enemies!' the import and application of which is the same (as above, I, 1, 4, 4). He spreads it (on the ground) with the neck-part turned towards west, whilst muttering the text (ib.): 'The skin of Aditi (the inviolate or boundless earth) art thou! May Aditi acknowledge (receive) thee!' the import (of this formula) being the same (as before, I, 1, 4, 5).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:15">1:2:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. He then puts the lower mill-stone on it, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 19): 'A rock-bowl art thou! May the skin of Aditi acknowledge thee!' for it is a bowl (dhisha<I>n</I>&acirc;) and a rock too; and by saying, 'May the skin of Aditi acknowledge thee,' he establishes an understanding between it and the black antelope skin, so that 'they will not hurt each other.' This one (the lower mill-stone) represents the earth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:16">1:2:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. He now puts upon (the west side of) it the wedge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_153"></A><A HREF="#fn_153"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> with its point turned towards north, whilst</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_39"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 39</FONT></A></p>  
<p>muttering the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 19): 'The stay of the sky art thou!' that is to say, it represents the atmosphere; for by means of the atmospheric region those two, the sky and the earth, are firmly kept asunder; and for this reason he says, 'The stay of the sky art thou!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:17">1:2:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. He then puts the upper mill-stone on (the lower one), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 19): 'A rock-born bowl art thou! May the rock acknowledge thee!' For this one being smaller is, as it were, the daughter (of the lower mill-stone)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for this reason he calls it 'rock-born.' 'May the rock acknowledge thee!' he says, because one of the same kin acknowledges (receives the other): thereby he establishes an understanding between those two millstones, thinking 'they will not hurt one another!' This one, as it were, represents the sky; (or) the two mill-stones are, as it were, the two jaws, and the wedge is the tongue: that is why he beats (the mill-stones) with the wedge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_155"></A><A HREF="#fn_155"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for it is with the tongue that one speaks.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:18">1:2:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. He now pours the rice on (the lower stone), with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 20): 'Grain (dh&acirc;nyam) art thou! do thou gratify (dhi)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the gods!' for it is</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_40"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 40</FONT></A></p>  
<p>grain; and it is with the intention 'that it may gratify the gods' that the rice-oblation is taken.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:19">1:2:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. He then grinds it, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 20): 'For out-breathing (I grind) thee! for in-breathing thee! for through-breathing (pervading vital air)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_157"></A><A HREF="#fn_157"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> thee! May I impart a long duration to the life (of the sacrificer)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_158"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' He pours it (the ground rice on the skin), with the text (ib.): 'May the divine Savit<I>ri</I>, the golden-handed, receive thee with a flawless hand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!' 'For his (the sacrificer's) eye (I look at) thee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:20">1:2:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. The reason why he thus grinds it, is that the sacrificial food of the gods is living, is am<I>ri</I>ta (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. Now with the mortar and pestle, and with the two millstones they kill this rice-offering (havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:21">1:2:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. When he now says: 'For out-breathing thee! for in-breathing thee!' he thereby again imparts out-breathing and in-breathing (to it), and by saying 'for through-breathing thee!' he imparts through-breathing (to it). By 'may I impart a long duration to the life!' he bestows life on it. By 'may the divine Savit<I>ri</I>, the golden-handed, receive thee with a flawless</p>

<p>

<p><A NAME="page_41"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 41</FONT></A></p>  
<p>hand!' he says: 'May they be well received!' By 'for the eye thee!' he bestows eye-sight on it. Now these (attributes) are those of a living being; and thus that sacrificial food for the gods is indeed living, is am<I>ri</I>ta (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. This is the reason why he thus grinds (the rice). (Whilst) they are grinding the (ground) grains&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, (and whilst) they are heating the potsherds,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:2:1:22">1:2:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. Some one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> pours clarified butter (into the &acirc;<I>g</I>yasth&acirc;l&icirc;, or butter-pot). Now whatever oblation, in being taken, is announced to a (particular) deity, that belongs to the respective deity, that he takes with a special prayer; but in taking this oblation, to wit, the butter, he does not announce it to any particular deity, and therefore takes it with an undefined formula, viz. with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. I, 20): 'Juice of the great ones art thou!' For 'the great ones' some (take to be) a name for the cows; and their juice indeed it is: for this reason he says, 'The juice of the great ones art thou!' And thus, moreover, is some of that (butter) taken with a sacrificial formula: and for this reason also he says, 'The juice of the great ones art thou!'</p>

II, 4, 37, full explanations are given regarding the manner of arranging the potsherds (kap&acirc;las) on which the sacrificial cakes are spread, and which vary in number and shape. The Adhvaryu is first to describe a circle, the diameter of which is six a&#7749;gulas (an a&#7749;gula or thumb's breadth=about &frac34; inch). This circle he then divides into three parts by drawing across, from west to east, two parallel lines at a distance of two a&#7749;gulas from one another, so as to make the two outer (or southern and northern) segments of equal size. The middle division he then covers with three equal square potsherds (measuring two a&#7749;gulas on each side), by laying down first the central one, then the one behind or west of it, and lastly the front or eastern one. He then lays down another (the fourth) south of the first or central one; after which he divides the still remaining potsherds equally between the southern and the northern segments, or, in case of that number being uneven, assigns the odd potsherd to the southern division. Thus, in the present case, where in the first place a cake on eight potsherds is to be offered to Agni; after laying down the three intermediate ones and the fourth, or central one of the southern division, he divides the remaining four equally between the southern and northern segments, beginning, in laying them down, in the south-east corner, and moving around from right to left, so as to end in the north-east. Similarly in the case of the cake on eleven potsherds for Agn&icirc;shomau, after laying down the first four potsherds, he assigns four of the remaining seven to the southern, and three to the northern division. Thus with cakes requiring an uneven number of potsherds, the number of those of the southern division exceeds that of the northern one by two; and in the case of an even number, by one only. This is the rule applying to cakes requiring at least six potsherds. When one potsherd only is required, it is to be of the size of a hand; when two, they are to form a circle divided into two equal parts by a line drawn from south to north; when three, the circle is divided into three sections from south to north; when four or five, it is divided into two halves from west to east; and in the one case three potsherds are placed in the southern and one (of half-moon shape) in the northern half; in the other case three in the northern and two in the southern division. The potsherds, <A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A> though mostly irregular in shape, must always exactly fit one another, so as not to leave any space between. This is effected by rubbing the edges. The cake itself is to be of the shape of a tortoise; the convex shield, or carapace, of the latter consisting of plates arranged in a somewhat similar way as the potsherds of most cakes, viz. in a central (dorsal) and two lateral sets.</P>

Mr. Ralph Griffith (Translation of the R&aacute;m&aacute;yan, I, p. 90) has compared this Hindu rite of pradakshi<I>n</I>a or dakshi<I>n</I>&icirc;kara<I>n</I>a with the Gaelic deasil, as described in the following passage of Sir W. Scott's The Two Drovers: "But it is little I would care for the food that nourishes me, or the fire that warms me, or for God's blessed sun itself, if aught but weel should happen to the grandson of my father. So let me walk the deasil round you, that you may go safe out into the far foreign land, and come safe home." Robin Oig stopped, half embarrassed, half laughing, and signing to those near that he only complied with the old woman to soothe her humour. In the meantime she traced around him, with wavering steps, the propitiation, which some have thought has been derived from the Druidical mythology. It consists, as is well known, in the person, who makes the deasil, walking three times round the person who is the object of the ceremony, taking care to move according to the course of the sun.' Cf. note at <A HREF="sbe1208.htm#page_45">p. 45</A>. Note also the etymological connection between dakshi<I>n</I>a and deiseil (Old Ir. dessel, from dess, Gael. deas, south or right side). For the corresponding rite (dextratio) at the Roman marriage ceremonies see Rossbach, R&ouml;mische Ehe, pp. 315, 316; Weber, Ind. Stud. V, p. 221.</P>

It is probable that the Bh<I>ri</I>gu-A&#7749;giras in the above formula of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>as. Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; are intended as equivalent to the latter term. Cf.

Mah&icirc;dhara interprets it thus: 'I put thee, (O rice! on the black antelope skin) for (increasing) the life (of the sacrificer) with a view to a long continuance (of the sacrificial work);' or 'I place thee along the long expanse (i.e. the skin) for thy (the rice's) long life!'</P>
