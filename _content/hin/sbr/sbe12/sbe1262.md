### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:1">2:6:3:1</span></span>1.
Verily, imperishable is the righteousness of him that offers the
Seasonal sacrifices; for such a one gains the year, and hence there is
no cessation for him. He gains it (the year) in three divisions, he
conquers it in three divisions. The year means the whole, and the whole
is imperishable (without end): hence his righteousness is indeed
imperishable. Moreover, he thereby becomes a Season, and as such goes to
the gods; but there is no perishableness in the gods, and hence there is
imperishable righteousness for him. This, then, is why he offers the
Seasonal sacrifices.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:2">2:6:3:2</span></span>2. Then
as to why he should perform the *S*unâsîrya offering. The prosperity
(*s*rî) that accrued to the gods on performing the Sâkamedha offerings,
and gaining the victory (over V*ri*tra), is *s*una; and the essence
(rasa) that belonged to the year gained by them is sîra <span
id="fr_999"></span>[2](#fn_995). Now that same prosperity which

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

accrued to the gods on performing the Sâkamedha offerings, and that same
essence which belonged to the year gained by them,--both these he takes
possession of and makes his own: that is why he performs the
*S*unâsîrya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:3">2:6:3:3</span></span>3. The
mode of its performance (is as follows): They prepare no uttaravedi;
they do not use clotted butter; nor do they churn the fire <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[1](#fn_996). There are five fore-offerings, three
after-offerings, and one Samish*t*aya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:4">2:6:3:4</span></span>4. Then,
in the first place, there are those five (regular) oblations <span
id="fr_1001"></span>[2](#fn_997). By means of these oblations, indeed,
Pra*g*âpati produced creatures; with them he delivered the creatures
both ways from Varu*n*a's noose; with them the gods slew V*ri*tra and
gained that victory which was gained by them. And so does he, by means
of them, obtain and make his own, both that prosperity which accrued to
the gods from performing the Sâkamedha offerings, and that essence of
the year which was gained by them. This is why those five oblations are
(offered).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:5">2:6:3:5</span></span>5. Then
follows a *S*unâsîrya <span id="fr_1002"></span>[3](#fn_998) cake on
twelve

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

potsherds. The import of this *S*unâsîrya oblation is what we have
stated before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:6">2:6:3:6</span></span>6. After
that there is an (oblation of) milk <span
id="fr_1003"></span>[1](#fn_999) to Vâyu. Now it is to milk that living
beings readily take, when they are born: 'May the creatures readily take
to me--now that I have gained the victory (by means of the Sâkamedha
offerings)--for my prosperity, glory, and support!' so he thinks, and
hence that (oblation of) milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:7">2:6:3:7</span></span>7. Then
as to why it is (offered) to Vâyu. Now Vâyu, indeed, is yonder blowing
(wind); it is he that makes swell whatever rain falls here. But it is by
the rain that plants grow; and on the plants being eaten and the water
drunk, milk is produced out of that water. Hence it is he (Vâyu) that
produces it; and for this reason it is (offered) to Vâyu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:8">2:6:3:8</span></span>8. Then
follows a cake on one potsherd for Sûrya. Now Sûrya, indeed, is yonder
scorching (sun); it is he that governs all this (world), now by means of
a good, now by a bad (king) <span id="fr_1004"></span>[2](#fn_1000); he
assigns its place to everything here, now under a good, now under a bad
(king): 'Now that I have obtained the victory, may he, in his pleasure,
govern me through a good (king), may he assign to me a place under a
good (king)!' thus he thinks; and for this reason there is a cake on one
potsherd for Sûrya.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:9">2:6:3:9</span></span>9. The
priests' fee for this (oblation to Sûrya)

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

is a white horse <span id="fr_1005"></span>[1](#fn_1001); whereby it is
made of the characteristic form of yonder scorching (sun). If he be
unable to procure a white horse, it may be a white bull; whereby it is
likewise made of the characteristic form of yonder scorching (sun).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:10">2:6:3:10</span></span>10. He
may offer the *S*unâsîrya at the same time when he performs the
Sâkamedha offerings. By offering (Seasonal sacrifices) three times in
the year, he indeed obtains the (whole) year: he may therefore offer
(the *S*unâsîrya) at any time <span id="fr_1006"></span>[2](#fn_1002).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:11">2:6:3:11</span></span>11.
Here now some wish to take possession of the nights; and should he wish
to take possession of the nights, let him offer the *S*unâsîrya (on the
day) when, previously to the full-moon of Phâlguna, (the new moon)
becomes visible in yonder sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:12">2:6:3:12</span></span>12. Let
him then get consecrated (for the Soma-sacrifice), lest the Phâlguna
full-moon again pass by without his offering (Soma). For were the
Phâlguna full-moon again to pass by without his having

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

offered (Soma), he would certainly have to begin anew (to perform the
Seasonal offerings): hence the Phâlguna full-moon should not again pass
by without his offering Soma. Such (is the rule) for him who
discontinues (the Seasonal offerings).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:13">2:6:3:13</span></span>13. And
in the case of one who recommences (the Seasonal offerings),--let him
perform the *S*unâsîrya on the day preceding the Phâlguna full-moon, and
on the following day the Vai*s*vadeva, and after that the Full-moon
offering. This, then, (is the rule) for him who recommences (the
Seasonal offerings).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:14">2:6:3:14</span></span>14.
Then as to (the Sacrificer) shaving his head all round <span
id="fr_1007"></span>[1](#fn_1003). Now yonder sun, indeed, faces every
quarter; it drinks up whatever (moisture) it dries up here: hence this
(Sacrificer) thereby faces every quarter and becomes a consumer of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:15">2:6:3:15</span></span>15.
This fire also faces every quarter, since it burns all they put into it
from whatsoever quarter: hence this (Sacrificer) thereby faces every
quarter and becomes a consumer of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:16">2:6:3:16</span></span>16.
This man, on the other hand, faces but one quarter; but by shaving his
head all round he comes to face every quarter; and whosoever, knowing
this, has his head shaved all round, becomes just such a consumer of
food as those two: let him therefore have his head shaved all round.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:3:17">2:6:3:17</span></span>17. And
on this point Âsuri said, 'What in the world has it to do with his face,
even if he were to shave off all the hair of his head! It is by offering

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

thrice in the year that he comes to face all the quarters and becomes a
consumer of food: let him therefore not trouble himself about shaving
his head.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_994"></span>[444:1](sbe1261.htm#fr_998) See II, 5, 2, 48.

<span id="fn_995"></span>[444:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_999) The author
identifies sîra (plough) with sâra, 'essence, sap;' and takes *s*una,
ploughshare (?), as identical with *s*unam, 'successfully,
prosperously.' See next page, note [3](#fn_998).

<span id="fn_996"></span>[445:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1000) But see XI, 5, 2,
8, 'At all four of these (*K*âturmâsya offerings) they churn the fire.'
On account of this contradiction, the commentators, on Kâty. V, 11, 3,
consider the churning of the fire as optional. But, if the fires were
produced by 'churning,' nine fore-offerings and after-offerings would
have to be performed, as at the other Seasonal sacrifices, which is
expressly forbidden in the above passage. According to Kâty. himself,
the *S*unâsîrya is to be treated like an ordinary ish*t*i, except that
the barhis is to be tied together in the way prescribed for the Seasonal
offerings; see II, 5, 1, 18.

<span id="fn_997"></span>[445:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_1001) See II, 5, 1,
8-11.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[445:3](sbe1262.htm#fr_1002) That is, according
to Kâty. V, II, 5, to *S*una and Sîra,--probably the ploughshare and
plough, considered as two tutelary deities of agricultural pursuits
(Rig-veda IV, 57, 5-8); but by Yâska identified with Vâyu and
Âditya;--or, according to Taitt. S. I, 8, 7, I, <span id="page_446">p.
446</span> Taitt. Br. I, 7, 1, 1, to Indra *S*unâsîra (i.e. Indra,
accompanied by *S*una and Sîra, Sây.).

<span id="fn_999"></span>[446:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1003) According to Kâty.
V, II, 6-to, the milk, in this case, is to be offered quite fresh (and
warm) from the cow, without having been put on the fire. Rice-gruel may,
however, be offered instead.

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[446:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_1004) Or, 'now by good,
now by bad (means).'

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[447:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1005) According to
Taitt. S. I, 8, 7, Taitt. Br. I, 7, 1, 2, the Dakshi*n*â consists of a
plough yoked with twelve oxen.

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[447:2](sbe1262.htm#fr_1006) That is to say,
he may perform the *S*unâsîrya, either immediately after the
Sâkamedhâ*h*, or at any time within four months after that sacrifice
(comm. on Kâty. V, 11, 3). Our author, however, evidently favours the
views set forth in the succeeding paragraphs. According to these, the
householder who wishes to discontinue the Seasonal offerings after the
first round, and to become a Soma-sacrificer, is to perform the
*S*unâsîrya on the first day of the waxing moon of Phâlguna, and then to
undergo the dîkshâ, or rite of consecration for the Soma-sacrifice (see
III, 1, 2, 1 seq.), either immediately or before the approaching
full-moon, when he is to perform the Agnish*t*oma (or an animal offering
to Agni and Soma or an Âgneyî ish*t*i, Kâty. V, 11, 15). If, on the
other hand, he intends to continue the *K*âturmâsyas for another year
(or more), he is to perform the *S*unâsîrya on the upavasatha, or day
preceding the full-moon.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[448:1](sbe1262.htm#fr_1007) 'Parivartayate'
('nivartayate,' Kâ*n*va), lit. 'he causes himself to be turned round,'
is the technical expression for having one's head shaved all round (the
*s*ikhâ, or lock of hair on the crown of the head).
