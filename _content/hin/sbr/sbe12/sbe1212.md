### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:1">1:3:1:1</span></span>1. He
(the Âgnîdhra) now brushes the spoons <span
id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_207) (with the grass-ends). The reason why he
brushes

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the spoons is that the course <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208)
pursued among the gods is in accordance with that pursued among men.
Now, when the serving up of food is at hand among men,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:2">1:3:1:2</span></span>2. They
rinse the vessels, and having rinsed them, they serve up the food with
them: in the same way is treated the sacrifice to the gods, that is to
say, the cooked oblations and the prepared altar; and those vessels of
theirs, the sacrificial spoons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:3">1:3:1:3</span></span>3. Now,
when he brushes (the spoons), he in reality rinses them, thinking, 'with
these rinsed ones I will proceed.' He thereby rinses them with two
substances for the gods, and with one for men; viz. with water and the
brahman (spirit of worship) for the gods,--for the water is (represented
by) the sacrificial grass <span id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_209), and the
brahman (by) the sacrificial formula;--and with one for men, that is
with water alone: and thus this takes place separately <span
id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_210).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:4">1:3:1:4</span></span>4. He, in
the first place, takes the dipping-spoon

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (sruva, masc.) and
makes it hot (on the Gârhapatya fire), with either of the texts (Vâ*g*.
S. I, 29), 'Scorched is the Rakshas, scorched are the enemies!' or,
'Burnt out is the Rakshas, burnt out are the enemies!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:5">1:3:1:5</span></span>5. For
when the gods were performing sacrifice they were afraid of a
disturbance on the part of the Asuras and Rakshas. Hence by this means
he, from the very opening of the sacrifice, expels from here the evil
spirits, the Rakshas <span id="fr_211"></span>[1](#fn_211).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:6">1:3:1:6</span></span>6. He
brushes it thus inside with the (grass-)tops (cut off from the grass in
tying the veda), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 29), 'Not sharp <span
id="fr_212"></span>[2](#fn_212) art thou, (but yet) a destroyer of the
enemies!' he says this in order that it may unceasingly destroy the
enemies of the sacrificer. Further, 'Thee, the food-abounding (masc.), I
cleanse for the kindling of food <span
id="fr_213"></span>[3](#fn_213)!'--'thee that art suitable for the
sacrifice, I cleanse for the sacrifice,' he thereby says. In the same
way he brushes all the spoons, saying, 'Thee, the food-abounding (fem.)
. . .,' in the case of the offering-spoon (sru*k*, fem.). The
prâ*s*itrahara*n*a <span id="fr_214"></span>[4](#fn_214) (he brushes)
silently.

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:7">1:3:1:7</span></span>7. Inside
he brushes with the (grass-)tops thus (viz. from the handle to the top,
or in a forward, eastward direction from himself); outside with the
lower (grass-)ends thus (viz. in the opposite or backward direction,
towards himself) <span id="fr_215"></span>[1](#fn_215): for thus (viz.
in the former way) goes the out-breathing, and thus (in the opposite
way) the in-breathing. Thereby he obtains out-breathing and in-breathing
(for the sacrificer): hence these hairs (on the upper side of the elbow)
point that way, and these (on the lower side) point that way <span
id="fr_216"></span>[2](#fn_216).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:8">1:3:1:8</span></span>8. Each
time he has brushed and heated (a spoon), he hands it (to the Adhvaryu).
Just as, after having rinsed (the eating vessels) while touching them,
one would finally rinse them without touching them, so here: for this
reason he hands over each (spoon) after heating it <span
id="fr_217"></span>[3](#fn_217).

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:9">1:3:1:9</span></span>9. The
dipping-spoon (sruva, masc.) he brushes first, and then the other spoons
(sru*k*, fem.). The offering-spoon (sru*k*), namely, is female, and the
dipping-spoon is male, so that, although in this way several women meet
together, the one that is, as it were, the only male youth among them,
goes there first, and the others after him. This is the reason why he
brushes the dipping-spoon first, and afterwards the other
(offering-)spoons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:10">1:3:1:10</span></span>10. Let
him brush, them so as not to spatter anything towards the fire, as he
would thereby bespatter him, to whom he will be bringing food, with the
slops of the vessels: therefore let him brush them so as not to spatter
anything towards the fire, that is to say, after stepping outside (the
Âhavanîya fire-house) towards the east.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:11">1:3:1:11</span></span>11.
Here now some throw the grass-ends used for cleaning the spoons into the
(Âhavanîya) fire. 'To the veda (grass-bunch) they assuredly belonged,
and the spoons have been cleaned with them: hence it is something that
belongs to the sacrifice, and (we throw it into the fire) in order that
it should not become excluded from the sacrifice,' thus (they argue).
Let him, however, not do so, since he would thereby make him to whom he
will offer food, drink the slops of the vessels <span
id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_218). Let him therefore throw them away (on
the heap of rubbish).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:12">1:3:1:12</span></span>12. He
(the Âgnîdhra) then girds the wife (of the

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

sacrificer) <span id="fr_219"></span>[1](#fn_219). She, the wife, truly
is the hinder part of the sacrifice. 'May the sacrifice go on increasing
before me!' thus (she thinks while) he girds her, thinking, 'may she sit
thus girt by my sacrifice!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:13">1:3:1:13</span></span>13. He
girds her with a cord (yoktra): for with a cord (yoktra) they yoke the
draught-animal (yogya). Impure indeed is that part of woman which is
below the navel; and therewith she will be facing the sacrificial
butter: that part of her he thereby conceals with the cord, and only
with the pure upper part of her body she then faces the sacrificial
butter. This is the reason why he girds the wife <span
id="fr_220"></span>[2](#fn_220).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:14">1:3:1:14</span></span>14. He
girds her over the garment. Now the garment represents the plants, and
(the cord represents) Varu*n*a's noose <span
id="fr_221"></span>[3](#fn_221) (ra*gg*u): hence he thereby places the
plants between (her and the noose), and

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

thus that noose of Varu*n*a does not injure her. This is the reason why
he girds her over the garment.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:15">1:3:1:15</span></span>15. He
girds her, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 30), 'A zone art thou for Aditi!'
Aditi, indeed, is this earth. She is the wife of the gods, and that one
is his (the sacrificer's) wife. It is for the latter, accordingly, that
he makes it a zone instead of a noose (or string). A zone means a
girdle, and he thereby makes it this for her.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:16">1:3:1:16</span></span>16. Let
him not make a knot <span id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_222), for the knot
is Varu*n*a's (attribute); and Varu*n*a would lay hold on the
(sacrificer's) wife, if he were to make a knot. For this reason he does
not make a knot.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:17">1:3:1:17</span></span>17. He
twists it through upwards <span id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_223), with
the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 30), 'The pervader <span
id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_224), of Vish*n*u art thou!' Let her not sit
to the west of the sacrifice, with her face towards the east. For Aditi
is this earth <span id="fr_225"></span>[4](#fn_225), she is the wife of
the gods, and she indeed sits on the west of the sacrifice of the gods,
with her face turned

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

towards the east: and this lady would, therefore, raise herself to her
(Aditi), and would speedily go to yonder world. And thus (viz. by
sitting in the prescribed way) she lives for a long time, thus she
propitiates her (Aditi), and thus the latter harms her not. For this
reason let her sit somewhat to the south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:18">1:3:1:18</span></span>18. She
looks down upon the sacrificial butter <span
id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226); for assuredly that wife is a woman, and
the butter (represents) seed: hence a productive union is thereby
brought about. For this reason she looks towards the butter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:19">1:3:1:19</span></span>19. She
looks, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 30), 'With an unimpaired eye I look
on thee;' whereby she says, with an uninjured eye I look on
thee.'--'Agni's tongue art thou!' for when they offer up that (butter)
in the fire, then Agni's tongues, as it were, issue forth: therefore she
says, 'Agni's tongue art thou!'--'A good caller <span
id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_227) of the gods,' whereby she says, 'well
for the gods;'--'be thou for every dainty (or, sacrificial site,
dhâman), for every prayer of mine!' whereby she says, 'for every
sacrifice of mine be thou (a good caller)!

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:20">1:3:1:20</span></span>20.
Having then taken up the butter (from the

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

ground), he (the Âgnîdhra) carries it eastwards. In the case of one
whose Âhavanîya fire is used for the cooking, he (now in the first
place) puts it on the Âhavanîya, thinking, 'My oblation shall be
entirely cooked on the Âhavanîya <span id="fr_228"></span>[1](#fn_228)!'
The reason why he first puts it thereon (viz. on the Gârhapatya) is,
because he will have to make the wife look at it: for it would not be
proper, if he were to take it (from the Âhavanîya) to the west in the
midst of the performance, for the purpose of making the wife look at it;
and if he were not to let the wife look at it at all, he would thereby
exclude her from the sacrifice. And in this way, then, he does not
exclude the (sacrificer's) wife from the sacrifice: therefore he does
not take it eastwards till after melting it close by the wife (on the
Gârhapatya), and making her look at it. In the case of one who (through
death or from other causes) has not his wife with him, he puts it from
the very beginning on the Âhavanîya. He then takes it again from thence
and puts it down within the altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:21">1:3:1:21</span></span>21.
Here now they say,--'He must not place it within the altar; for from
that (butter) they make the oblation to the wives of the gods <span
id="fr_229"></span>[2](#fn_229): he therefore excludes the wives of the
gods from the company (of

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

their husbands) <span id="fr_230"></span>[1](#fn_230), and thereby his
(the sacrificer's) wife becomes dissatisfied with her own husband.'
Yâ*gñ*avalkya, however, said in reference to this point, 'Let it be so
as it has been prescribed for the wife! who would care whether his wife
may consort with other men <span id="fr_231"></span>[2](#fn_231)?' 'As
the altar is (part of the) sacrifice, and the butter is (part of the)
sacrifice, I will build up the sacrifice from out of the sacrifice!'
thus thinking, let him place it within the altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:22">1:3:1:22</span></span>22. The
two strainers are lying in the sprinkling water. He takes them from
thence and purifies (ut-pû) the butter with them. Now one of them is
related to the wind (that blows) upwards (utpavana) <span
id="fr_232"></span>[3](#fn_232), so that he thereby makes it (the
butter) sacrificially pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:23">1:3:1:23</span></span>23. He
clarifies it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. 'By the impulse of Savit*ri* I
purify thee with a flawless purifier (strainer), with the rays of the
sun!' The meaning (of this formula) is the same (as before).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:24">1:3:1:24</span></span>24. He
then purifies the sprinkling water with the strainers covered with
butter, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 31),

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'By the impulse of
Savit*ri* I purify you (O waters) with a flawless purifier, with the
rays of the sun!' The meaning is the same (as before).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:25">1:3:1:25</span></span>25. The
reason why he purifies the sprinkling water with the strainers covered
with butter is, that he thereby puts milk into the water, and that the
milk thereby (becomes) beneficial <span id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_233)
in the water, for, when it rains, plants are thereby produced; and on
eating the plants and drinking the water, vital fluid (serum) results
therefrom: and thus (he does this) in order to supply the vital fluid
(of the sacrificer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:26">1:3:1:26</span></span>26. He
then looks down on the butter. Here now some make the sacrificer look
down. Yâ*gñ*avalkya, however, said in reference to this point,--'Why do
not (the sacrificers) themselves become (act as) Adhvaryu priests? and
why do not they (the sacrificers) themselves recite when far higher
blessings are prayed for <span id="fr_234"></span>[2](#fn_234)? How can
these (people) possibly have faith in this <span
id="fr_235"></span>[3](#fn_235)? Whatever blessing the officiating
priests invoke during the sacrifice that is for the benefit of the
sacrificer alone.' The Adhvaryu should accordingly look down on it.

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:27">1:3:1:27</span></span>27. He
looks down on it. The eye assuredly is the truth, for the eye is indeed
the truth. If, therefore, two persons were to come disputing with each
other and saying, 'I have seen it!' 'I have heard it!' we should believe
him who said, 'I have seen it!' and not the other: hence he thereby
causes it (the butter) to increase by means of the truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:1:28">1:3:1:28</span></span>28. He
looks down on it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. I, 31), 'Lustrous art thou!
resplendent art thou! immortal (or, ambrosia) art thou!' That prayer is
indeed true, for that (butter) is lustrous, it is resplendent, it is
immortal: hence he thereby causes it to increase by that (prayer) which
is true.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_207"></span>[67:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_207) Besides the
Agnihotra-hava*n*î, or milk ladle used at the morning and evening
oblations (see [p. 11](sbe1203.htm#page_11), note
[2](sbe1204.htm#fn_97); and II, 3, I, 17), three different sru*k* or
offering-spoons are used, viz. the *g*uhû, upabh*ri*t, and dhruvâ. They
are made each of a different kind of wood, of an arm's length (or,
according to others, a cubit long), with a bowl of the shape and size of
the hand, and a hole cut through the bark and front side of the bowl and
fitted with a spout some eight or nine inches long, and shaped like a
goose's bill. The sruva or dipping-spoon, on the other hand, chiefly
used for ladling the clarified <span id="page_68">p. 68</span> butter
(or milk) from the butter vessel into the offering-spoons, is of khadira
wood (Acacia Catechu), a cubit long, with a round bowl measuring a
thumb's joint across, and without a spout. In our text the term sru*k*
is used both in the general sense of 'spoon' and in the narrower one of
'offering-spoon,' as distinguished from the sruva or 'dipping-spoon.'

<span id="fn_208"></span>[68:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_208) The brushing of the
spoons is here compared with the rinsing of vessels preparatory to their
being used for serving up the food. At the same time, we shall see
further on (I, 8, 3, 26-27) that the two principal offering-spoons, the
*g*uhû and upabh*ri*t, are looked upon as yoke-fellows, they being the
two horses that are supposed to convey the sacrifice (and consequently
the sacrificer himself) to the world of the gods; hence this process of
cleaning also corresponds to the rubbing down of the horses preparatory
to the setting out of the sacrificer on his progress to the world of the
gods.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[68:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_209) See I, 1, 3, 5.

<span id="fn_210"></span>[68:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_210) It is doubtful to me
whether this last passage merely refers to the several spoons, or
whether it refers to the symbolical meaning <span id="page_69">p.
69</span> of the wiping with sacrificial grass and the accompanying
formula. In the latter case it might mean: 'and thus that (act) becomes
different (i.e. has a different significance).'

<span id="fn_211"></span>[69:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_211) Cf. I, 1, 2, 3, and
note.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[69:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_212) A-ni*s*ita, 'not
sharpened,' from *s*â (*s*o), 'to sharpen' (thus also Mahîdh.). If,
however, anuparata, 'unceasing,' in the text is intended by the author
to explain ani*s*ita, he would seem to identify the root *s*â with sâ.
(so), 'to bring to an end, to finish.' The spoon is sharpened by the
wiping, cf. Taitt. Br. III, 3, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_213"></span>[69:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_213) Vâ*g*edhyâyai, 'for
the lighting (brightening) of the sacrifice (by means of the butter
which is poured into the fire), the sacrifice being the food of the
gods,' Mahîdh. The St. Petersburg Dictionary suggests vâ*g*etyâyai,
'thee, the courser, I wipe for the race!' Cf. [p. 68](#page_68), note
[1](#fn_208).

<span id="fn_214"></span>[69:4](sbe1212.htm#fr_214) The
prâ*s*itrahara*n*a is a pan of khadira wood, either <span
id="page_70">p. 70</span> square or round (? oval, of the shape of a
cow's ear, Sây.; of the shape of a mirror, Katy.), used for holding the
Brahman's portion (prâ*s*itra) of the sacrificial cake. According to
Katy. II, 6, 49, the *sri*tâvadânam (cake-cutter) and (purodâ*s*a-)pâtrî
(cake-dish) also have to be cleaned on this occasion.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[70:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_215) While brushing the
spoons he stands east of the Âhavanîya fire-house, looking toward east.
The way of brushing, prescribed by the Black Ya*g*us (Taitt. Br. III, 3,
I, 3-4; comm. on Taitt. S. I, 1, 10), seems to be more complicated.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[70:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_216) Viz. the former
('aratner uparibhâgasya lomâni'), according to Sâya*n*a, point in a
forward direction (away from the body), and the latter
('p*ri*sh*th*abhâgasya lomâni') in a backward direction. The Taitt. Br.
III, 3, 1, 4 has 'on the elbow (aratnau) the hairs above (point)
forward, those below backward,' which Sâya*n*a (Taitt. S. I, 1, 1, 10)
explains by 'the short hairs above the wrist (? ma*n*ibandhâd ûrdhvam)
are forward-pointed (prâṅmukha), but those below are backward-pointed
(pratya*ñk*).'

<span id="fn_217"></span>[70:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_217) That is to say, the
heating of the spoons corresponds to the usual final rinsing of
household vessels with water without touching them. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[71:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_218) The Black Ya*g*us
(Taitt. Br. III, 3, 2, 1) prescribes that the grass-ends, after the
brushing, should be thrown into the fire, and not on the heap of
rubbish, as some do; or at all events they should not be thrown on the
utkara, without their having been previously washed with water, as they
would otherwise bring ill-luck to the cattle.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[72:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_219) The mistress of the
house is seated south-west of the Gârhapatya fire \[with bent (or
raised) knees and her face turned towards north-east\]. The Âgnîdhra
then girds her round the waist, outside the garment, with a triple cord
of reed-grass (mu*ñg*a). Katy. II, 7, 1; and Sâya*n*a on our passage.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[72:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_220) According to Taitt.
Br. III, 3, 3, 2-3 the symbolical meaning of this act is, that it
represents the vratopanayana, or initiation of the wife into the sacred
rite. The girding of the wife would thus possess a significance similar
to that of the ordinary upanayana, or investiture of the youth with the
sacred cord.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[72:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_221) The noose (pâ*s*a)
is one of the chief attributes of God Varu*n*a, the symbol of his
supreme power and his abhorrence of sin. Thus we read in Atharva-veda
IV, 16, 4 seq.: 'And if one were to flee far beyond the sky, one would
not escape from king Varu*n*a. From heaven his spies issue forth to this
(world), and with their thousand eyes survey the earth. King Varu*n*a
sees all that happens between heaven and earth and beyond them: the very
twinklings of the eyes of men are numbered by him. . . . May all those
baleful nooses of thine, O Varu*n*a, that are thrown sevenfold and
three-fold, <span id="page_73">p. 73</span> ensnare him who speaks
untruth, and pass by him who speaks the truth!'

<span id="fn_222"></span>[73:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_222) Taitt. Br. III, 3,
3, 4, on the contrary, prescribes a knot (granthi*m* grathnâti), as the
symbol which is to secure all blessings for her.

<span id="fn_223"></span>[73:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_223) He winds the cord
round her waist from left to right (pradakshi*n*am), and having fixed
the southern end by twice twisting round the northern one, he draws the
southern end through the encircling cord upwards (so as to hang down,
uparish*t*âl lambayet, Sâya*n*a. Katy. II, 7, 1, &c., Scholl.).

<span id="fn_224"></span>[73:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_224) Veshya = vyâpaka,
Mahîdh.; 'perhaps a headband,' St. Petersb. Dict. It is apparently an
etymological play on the name of Vish*n*u (? the all-pervading sun). The
formula, according to Mahîdhara, is addressed to the southern end of the
cord which is drawn through the girdle (? the pervading ray of
Vish*n*u).

<span id="fn_225"></span>[73:4](sbe1212.htm#fr_225) Aditi is the earth
and therefore the altar, which represents the earth: hence Aditi, in the
shape of the altar, looks towards the east.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[74:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_226) He takes the pot
containing the clarified butter from the fire, with the text (Vâ*g*. S.
I, 30): 'For juice thee!' \[see I, 2, 2, 6,\] puts it down on the ground
before the sacrificer's wife and bids her look down on it. Katy. II, 7,
4.

<span id="fn_227"></span>[74:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_227) Suhû*h*. The Kâ*n*va
recension and Taitt. S. I, 1, 10, 3 have subhû*h*, 'well-being, good,'
which reading seems also to be presupposed by our author's explanation
'well (or good) for the gods.' The Black Ya*g*us assigns this entire
mantra to the Adhvaryu, when he has taken the butter from the Âhavanîya,
and puts it down north of the altar. In other respects also it differs
considerably from the order followed by our author.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[75:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_228) According to the
ritual of the Black Ya*g*us, the butter, after the sacrificer's wife has
looked at it, is again heated on the Gârhapatya fire, in order to remove
the impurity which has thereby been imparted to it.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[75:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_229) The
patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as are four oblations of butter to Soma, Tvash*tri*, the
wives of the gods, and Agni G*ri*hapati respectively, made at the end of
these sacrifices. See I, 9, 2, 1. It would seem that, according to the
ritual of the Black Ya*g*us, the butter is not put on the altar, but on
a line drawn with the wooden sword north of the altar. See [p.
74](#page_74), note [2](#fn_227).

<span id="fn_230"></span>[76:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_230) Avasabhâ*h*
karoti--avagata*g*anasamûhâ*h* karoti, Sây.; the gods are supposed to be
assembled around the altar (cf. I, 3, 3, 8): hence by placing the
butter, from which the oblations to the wives of the gods are to be
made, within the altar, the Adhvaryu would separate the wives from their
husbands.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[76:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_231) I am not quite
certain as to whether this last scornful remark is really to be assigned
to Yâ*gñ*avalkya. The Kâ*n*va text has,--Yâ*gñ*avalkya, however, said,
'Let him place it within the altar!' thus he said. 'Let it be so as it
has been prescribed for the wife,' thus (thinking) let him place it,
whether or not she consort with other men.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[76:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_232) Probably the same as
ud-âna (breathing upwards or inspiration), which one of the strainers is
said to represent in I, 1, 3, 2. See also I, 1, 3, 6; Taitt. Br. III, 3,
4, 4. The St. Petersburg Dictionary proposes the meaning 'an implement
for cleaning' for utpavana in this passage.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[77:1](sbe1212.htm#fr_233) A play on the word
hitam, which means both 'put, placed,' and 'beneficial, salutary.'

<span id="fn_234"></span>[77:2](sbe1212.htm#fr_234) The Kâ*n*va text has
as follows,--Here now some make the sacrificer eye it, arguing,
'whatever blessing (resides therein) that he should himself pray for.'
Yâ*gñ*avalkya, however, said in reference to this point, 'Why then does
not he himself become Adhvaryu? and why does he not recite (the solemn
prayers of the Hot*ri* priest), and that when they pray for higher
blessing? Whatever blessing the priests invoke at the sacrifice, that
they invoke for the sacrificer alone;' thus he said. The Adhvaryu,
therefore, should look down on it.

<span id="fn_235"></span>[77:3](sbe1212.htm#fr_235) Teshâ*m* *s*âkhinâm
atraivâveksha*n*a*m* ya*g*amânenaiva kartavyam iti kasmât kâra*n*ât
*s*raddhâ *g*âtâ, evam ta*m* *s*raddhâm prahasya, Sây. The Kâ*n*va text
omits this derisive remark.
