### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:1">2:3:2:1</span></span>1.
Verily, in him that exists <span id="fr_770"></span>[3](#fn_766), these
deities reside, to wit, Indra, king Yama, Na*d*a the Naishadha <span
id="fr_771"></span>[4](#fn_767) (king), Ana*s*nat Sâṅgamana, and Asat
Pâ*m*sava.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:2">2:3:2:2</span></span>2. Now
Indra, in truth, is the same as the Âhavanîya; and king Yama is the same
as the Gârhapatya; and Na*d*a Naishadha is the same as the
Anvâhâryapa*k*ana (Dakshi*n*a fire); and because day by day they take
that (fire) to the south, therefore indeed they say that day by day
Na*d*a Naishadha carries king Yama <span id="fr_772"></span>[5](#fn_768)
(further) south.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:3">2:3:2:3</span></span>3. And
again what fire there is in the hall (sabhâ), that is the same as
Ana*s*nat Sâṅgamana: Ana*s*vat (not eating) it is for the reason that
people

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

approach it before they eat. And that (place) where they throw the ashes
they remove (from the fireplaces) is the same as Asat Pâ*m*sava. And
whosoever knows this, thus gains all those worlds, traverses all those
worlds, thinking, 'In me those gods reside.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:4">2:3:2:4</span></span>4. Now as
to rendering homage to (upasthâna, lit. standing near) these (fires).
When in the evening and morning (after the Agnihotra) he stands by the
Âhavanîya, and sits down by it, that is the homage rendered to that
(fire). And when, on stepping back to the Gârhapatya, he either sits or
lies down, that is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when, in
walking (out of the sacrificial ground), he remembers the
Anvâhâryapa*k*ana, and thus, in his mind, tarries near it, that is the
homage rendered to that (fire).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:5">2:3:2:5</span></span>5. And
again, before taking food in the morning, having sat down for a moment
in the hall, he may also, if he like, walk round (the Sabhya or
hall-fire),--and this is the homage rendered to that (fire). And when he
steps near where lie the ashes removed (from the fire-places) that is
the homage rendered to that (fire). And thus homage has been rendered to
those deities of his.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:6">2:3:2:6</span></span>6. Now
the Gârhapatya (householder's fire) has the sacrificer for its deity;
and the Anvâhâryapa*k*ana (southern fire) has his foe for its deity:
hence they should not take over that (southern fire) every day (from the
Gârhapatya); and he indeed has no enemies, for whomsoever, knowing this,
they do not take it over every day. Indeed, it is the
Anvâhâryapa*k*ana <span id="fr_773"></span>[1](#fn_769).

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:7">2:3:2:7</span></span>7. Let
them only take it over on the fast-day (of the new and full-moon
sacrifice), when they are about to sacrifice on this (the Âhavanîya
fire): thus that (southern) one is taken over in order to prevent
failure on his (the sacrificer's) part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:8">2:3:2:8</span></span>8. Or
they may also take it over to a new dwelling; and let them then cook on
it food (other than meat) for the priests to eat. And should he not be
able to procure anything to cook, let him order the milk of a cow to be
put thereon and let the priests be asked to drink it. And his enemies
will indeed fare ill, for whomsoever, knowing this, they do so: let him,
therefore, endeavour by all means to do so.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:9">2:3:2:9</span></span>9. Now
when it is first kindled, and there is as yet nothing but smoke, then
indeed that(fire) is Rudra. And if anyone (Kshatriya) desires to consume
food (belonging to others),--even as Rudra seeks after these creatures,
now with distrust, now with violence, now in striking them down,--let
him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then (when
the fire has just been lighted), obtains that food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:10">2:3:2:10</span></span>10. And
when it burns rather brightly, then indeed that (fire) is Varu*n*a. And
if any one desires to consume food,--even as Varu*n*a seeks after these
creatures, now, as it were, seizing on them, now with violence, now in
striking them down,--let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing
this, offers then, obtains that food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:11">2:3:2:11</span></span>11. And
when it is in full blaze, and the smoke whirls upwards with the utmost
speed, then indeed that (fire) is Indra. And if any one wishes to be
like Indra in splendour and glory, let him offer then: and, assuredly,
he who, knowing this, offers then, obtains that food (object).

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:12">2:3:2:12</span></span>12. And
when the flame of the waning (fire) gets lower and lower, and (burns) as
it were sideways, then, indeed, that (fire) is Mitra. And if any one
desires to consume food here through the kindness (maitra, of
others),--as one of whom they say, 'Truly, this Brahman is everybody's
friend, he harms not any one,'--let him offer (the Agnihotra) then: and,
assuredly, he who, knowing this, offers then (when the fire gets low),
obtains that food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:13">2:3:2:13</span></span>13. And
when the coals are glowing intensely, then, indeed, that (fire) is the
Brahman. And if anybody wishes to become endowed with holy lustre
(brahmavar*k*asin), let him offer then: and, assuredly, he who, knowing
this, offers then, obtains that food (object).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:14">2:3:2:14</span></span>14. Let
him endeavour to adhere to some one of these (gods or fires) for a year,
whether he (the householder) himself offer (the Agnihotra) or some one
else offer for him. If, on the other hand, he offers now in this way,
now in another, it is just as if, in digging for water or some other
food, one were to leave off in the midst of it. But if he offers
uniformly, it is just as if, in digging for water or some other food,
one lays it open forthwith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:15">2:3:2:15</span></span>15.
Indeed, these offerings are, as it were, the spades for (the digging up
of) food; and, assuredly, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra,
procures food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:16">2:3:2:16</span></span>16. Now
the first libation (pûrvâhuti) represents the gods, and the second
(uttarâhuti) represents the men, and what remains in the ladle
represents cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:17">2:3:2:17</span></span>17.
Only a little he offers for the first libation, somewhat more for the
second, and still more he leaves in the ladle.

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:3:2:18">2:3:2:18</span></span>18. The
reason why he offers only a little for the first libation, is that the
gods are fewer than men; and why he offers somewhat more for the second
libation, is that men are more numerous than the gods; and why he leaves
still more in the ladle, is that cattle are more numerous than men. And,
verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, his cattle will
be more numerous than those (human beings) that have to be supported by
him: for he, indeed, is in a prosperous condition whose cattle are more
numerous than those (human beings) dependent on his support.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_766"></span>[338:3](sbe1249.htm#fr_770) The commentator
takes it, 'in whatever (sacrificer) exists.' The (Oxf. MS. of the)
Kâ*n*va text has nothing corresponding to the second and third
Brâhma*n*as.

<span id="fn_767"></span>[338:4](sbe1249.htm#fr_771) The printed text
has Naishidha. See Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 225 seq.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[338:5](sbe1249.htm#fr_772) Here Yama is
apparently taken as (the god of) death and destruction, caused, as
Professor Weber suggests, by the warlike expeditions of Na*d*a, king of
Nishadha, in the south.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[339:1](sbe1249.htm#fr_773) That is, the fire
on which the Anvâhârya mess of rice, the priests' Dakshi*n*a at the new
and full-moon sacrifice, is cooked. See I, 2, 3, 5; [p.
49](sbe1209.htm#page_49), note [1](sbe1209.htm#fn_173).
