He (the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of the Hot<I>ri</I>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_331"></A><A HREF="#fn_329"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The reason why he utters his call, is that the (Adhvaryu's) call is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_132"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 132</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the sacrifice: 'having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the Hot<I>ri</I>,' thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for the Pravara.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:2">1:5:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. He utters his call after taking the fuel-band; for if the Adhvaryu were to utter his call without taking hold of the sacrifice, he would either be unsteady or meet with some other ailment.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:3">1:5:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. Here now some utter the call after taking sacrificial grass (barhis) from the covered altar, or they utter the call after cutting off and taking a chip of fire-wood, arguing, 'this, surely, is something belonging to the sacrifice; after taking hold of this, the sacrifice, we will utter the call.' Let him, however, not do this; for that also wherewith the firewood was tied together and wherewith they sweep the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_332"></A><A HREF="#fn_330"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is, doubtless, something belonging to the sacrifice; and thus indeed he utters his call after taking hold of the sacrifice: for this reason let him utter the call after taking the fuel-band.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:4">1:5:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. Having uttered the call, he in the first place chooses him who is the Hot<I>ri</I> of the gods, that is, Agni. Thereby he propitiates both Agni and the gods: for by first choosing Agni, he propitiates Agni;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_133"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 133</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and by first choosing him who is the Hot<I>ri</I> of the gods, he propitiates the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:5">1:5:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. He says, 'Agni, the god, the divine Hot<I>ri</I>--,' for Agni is indeed the Hot<I>ri</I> of the gods, therefore he says 'Agni, the god, the divine Hot<I>ri</I>:' thereby he propitiates both Agni and the gods; for by his first mentioning Agni he propitiates Agni; and by his first mentioning him who is the Hot<I>ri</I> of the gods, he propitiates the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:6">1:5:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. 'May he worship, knowing the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_333"></A><A HREF="#fn_331"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he the thoughtful one,'--for he, Agni, indeed, knows the gods well: hence, he thereby says 'may he who knows them well worship (them) in due form!</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:7">1:5:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. 'Like as Manu (did), like as Bharata;'--Manu, indeed, worshipped with sacrifice in olden times, and doing as he did these descendants of his now sacrifice: therefore he says 'like as Manu.' Or, say they, (it means) 'at the sacrifice of Manu,' and therefore he says 'as (he did) with Manu.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:8">1:5:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. 'Like as (with) Bharata,'--for, say they, he bears (bhar) the oblation to the gods, hence Bharata (the bearer) is Agni; or, say they, he, having become the breath, supports (bhar) these creatures, and therefore he says 'like as Bharata.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:9">1:5:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. He then chooses (Agni as) the ancestral (Hot<I>ri</I>). He thus introduces him both to the (ancestral) <I>ri</I>shis and to the gods (as if he were saying), 'he is of mighty strength who obtained the sacrifice!' for this reason he chooses (him as) the ancestral one.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:10">1:5:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. He chooses from the remote end (of the sacrificer's ancestral line)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_334"></A><A HREF="#fn_332"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> downwards; for it is from the</p>  
<p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_134"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 134</FONT></A></p>  
<p>remote end downwards that a race is propagated. Thereby he also propitiates the lord of seniority; for here among men the father comes first, then the son, and then the grandson: this is the reason why he chooses from the remote end downwards.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:11">1:5:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. Having named the ancestral, he says, 'Like as, Brahman;'--for Agni is the Brahman (the Veda, or the sacerdotium), and therefore he says 'like as Brahman;'--'may he bring (the gods) hither!' what deities he bids him bring hither, those he refers to in saying 'may he bring (them) hither.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:12">1:5:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. 'The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as (priests) are the guardians of this sacrifice;' for guardians of the sacrifice, indeed, are those Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who are versed in the sacred writ, because they spread it, they originate it: these he thereby propitiates; and for this reason he says, 'the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as are the guardians of the sacrifice.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:13">1:5:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. 'N.N. is the man,' thereby he chooses this man for his Hot<I>ri</I>; heretofore he was not a Hot<I>ri</I>, but now he is a Hot<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:14">1:5:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. The chosen Hot<I>ri</I> mutters,--has recourse to the deities: in order that he may give the vasha<I>t</I>-call to the gods in its proper order, that he may convey the oblation to the gods in its proper order, that he may not stumble, he has thus recourse to the deities.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:15">1:5:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. He mutters on this occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_335"></A><A HREF="#fn_333"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, 'Thee, O divine Savit<I>ri</I>, they now choose,'--thereby he has recourse to Savit<I>ri</I> for his impulsion (prasava), for Savit<I>ri</I> is the impeller (prasavit<I>ri</I>) of the gods;--'(thee who art) Agni, for the Hot<I>ri</I>ship,' thereby he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_135"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 135</FONT></A></p>  
<p>propitiates both Agni and the gods; for by first naming Agni, he propitiates Agni; and by first naming him who is the Hot<I>ri</I> of the gods, he propitiates the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:16">1:5:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. 'Together with father Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara,'--for the father Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara ('common to all men'), doubtless, is the year, is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (lord of creatures); hence he thereby propitiates the year and thus Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.--'O Agni! O P&ucirc;shan! O B<I>ri</I>haspati! speak forth and offer up sacrifice (pra-ya<I>g</I>)!'--he (the Hot<I>ri</I>), namely, will have to recite the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;s and the y&acirc;gy&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_336"></A><A HREF="#fn_334"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; he therefore now propitiates those gods: do ye recite, 'do ye offer!' thus (he thereby says).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:17">1:5:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. 'May we partake of the bounty of the Vasus, of the wide sway of the Rudras! may we be beloved of the &Acirc;dityas for the sake of (aditi) security from injury, free from obstruction!'--these, to wit, the Vasus, Rudras, and &Acirc;dityas, namely, are three (classes of) gods: 'may we enjoy their protection' he thereby says.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:18">1:5:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. 'May I this day utter speech that is agreeable to the gods;'--by this he means to say 'may I this day recite what is agreeable to the gods,' for auspicious it is when one recites what is agreeable to the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:19">1:5:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. 'Agreeable to the Brahmans,'--by this he means to say 'may I this day recite what is agreeable to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as (priests);' for auspicious it is when one recites what is agreeable to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:20">1:5:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. 'Agreeable to Nar&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_337"></A><A HREF="#fn_335"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,'--man (nara), namely, is a creature: hence he says this for all the creatures; thereby it is auspicious, and whether or not he knows (forms of speech that are agreeable), they are uttered (and received with applause), 'well he has recited! well he has recited!'--'What at the Hot<I>ri</I> choice may escape the crooked eye this day, that may Agni bring back here, he, the knower of beings (<I>g</I>&acirc;tavedas), the nimble one (vi<I>k</I>arsha<I>n</I>i)!'--by this he means to say, 'even as those (three) Agnis, whom they first chose for the Hot<I>ri</I>ship, passed away&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_338"></A><A HREF="#fn_336"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (but thou, the fourth Agni, wast then obtained,) so do thou make good for me whatever mistake may have been committed at my election!' and it is accordingly made good for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:21">1:5:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. He now touches the Adhvaryu and the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra: for the Adhvaryu is the mind, and the Hot<I>ri</I> is, speech: thus he thereby brings mind and speech together.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:22">1:5:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. At the same time he mutters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_339"></A><A HREF="#fn_337"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, 'From anguish may the six spaces protect me, fire, earth, water, wind, day, and night&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_340"></A><A HREF="#fn_338"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>!'--'may these deities protect</p>

<p>me from disease!' thus he thereby says; for he whom these deities protect from disease, will not stumble (or fail).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:23">1:5:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. He steps beside the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat, takes one stalk of (reed) grass from the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat and casts it outside (the sacrificial ground), with the formula, 'Ejected is the wealth-clutcher (par&acirc;vasu, lit. "off-wealth")!' Formerly, namely, the Hot<I>ri</I> of the Asuras was one Par&acirc;vasu by name: him he thereby ejects from the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:24">1:5:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. He then sits down on the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat, with the formula, 'I here sit down on the seat of the wealth-bestower (arv&acirc;vasu, lit. "hither-wealth")!' for one Arv&acirc;vasu by name was the Hot<I>ri</I> of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_341"></A><A HREF="#fn_339"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and on his seat he accordingly sits down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:25">1:5:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. At the same time he mutters, 'O All-maker, thou art the protector of lives! do not ye two (fires) scorch me away (from this)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_342"></A><A HREF="#fn_340"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, injure me not! this</p>

<p>is your sphere;' with this he moves slightly northwards: by this (mantra, he indicates that) he sits midway between the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya and the G&acirc;rhapatya, and thus he propitiates these two; and in accordance with what he says, 'do not scorch me away from this! injure me not!' they do not injure him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:5:1:26">1:5:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. He then mutters whilst looking at the (&Acirc;havan&icirc;ya) fire, 'All ye gods, instruct me, how and what I am to mind while seated here as the chosen Hot<I>ri</I>! declare my share (of the sacrificial duties), how and by what road I am to convey the oblation to you!'--for as one says to those for whom food has been cooked, 'order me how I am to bring if you, how I am to serve it up for you!' in like manner he is desirous of directions regarding the gods, and for this reason he mutters thus, 'instruct me how I may utter the Vasha<I>t</I>-call for you in its proper order, how I may bring you the oblation in its proper order!'</p>

The Adhvaryu having thereupon walked round the Hot<I>ri</I> from left to right, steps behind the utkara (heap of rubbish) with his face to the east and the fuel-band in his hand, and calls on (&acirc;<I>s</I>r&acirc;vayati) the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra, with &Otilde; <I>s</I>r&acirc;vaya (or &Otilde;<I>m</I> <I>s</I>r&acirc;vaya, i.e. &acirc; <I>s</I>r&acirc;vaya; or simply <font size="-1" color="green">'</font><I>s</I>r&acirc;vaya;' cf.

They are generally supposed to include the space above, the space below, and the four quarters. In Rig-veda VI, 47, 3-5 it is stated that they have been measured out <A NAME="page_137"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 137</FONT></A> by Indra, and that outside of them there is no being (bhuvanam); and they are then enumerated thus: the expanse of the earth, the height (varshman,? highest point or sphere) of the sky (div), the sap (p&icirc;y&ucirc;sha) in the three elevations [? i.e. flowing, animating moisture, as rain, rivers, sap, &amp;c.], the atmosphere, the ocean (? ar<I>n</I>as,? of light, air), and the sky (div). The enumeration of six objects in Atharva-veda II, 12, 1 seems to refer to the same conception: heaven and earth (dy&acirc;v&acirc;p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;), the wide atmospheric region, the genius (fem.) of the field (kshetrasya patn&icirc;), the far-strider (Sun, Light), the wide atmospheric region (uru-antariksham as before; cf. the double enumeration of div in the <I>Ri</I>k passage); and what has the Wind for its guardian (v&acirc;tagopa). Cf. Weber, Ind: Stud. XIII, p. 164. S&acirc;<I>n</I>kb. G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra I, 6, 4 gives heaven and earth, day and night, water and plants (St. Petersburg Dictionary s.v.).</P>
