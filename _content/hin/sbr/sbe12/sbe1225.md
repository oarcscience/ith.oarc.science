### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:1">1:5:4:1</span></span>1. He
(accordingly) pronounces the offering-prayer to the Samidhs
(kindling-sticks). The Samidhs (kindlers), doubtless, are the breaths
(vital airs), and he thereby kindles the breaths; for this man (the
sacrificer) is kindled (animated) by his breaths: hence if he (the
sacrificer) be burning (with fever, &c.), he (the Adhvaryu) will say,
'Stroke (thyself)!' If he be hot, then one may feel confident, for then
he is kindled; and if he be cold, then one need hope no longer. Thus he
thereby puts the breaths into him: this is the reason why he pronounces
the prayer to the Samidhs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:2">1:5:4:2</span></span>2. He
then pronounces the offering-prayer to Tanûnapât. Tanûnapât, doubtless,
is seed; hence he thereby casts seed: this is why he pronounces the
prayer to Tanûnapât.

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:3">1:5:4:3</span></span>3. He
then pronounces the offering-prayer to the I*d*s. The I*d*s, doubtless,
are offspring; when the seed thus cast springs into life, then it moves
about in quest of food, as it were, praising (î*d*). Hence he thereby
makes him (the sacrificer) propagate offspring: this is the reason why
he, pronounces the prayer to the I*d*s.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:4">1:5:4:4</span></span>4. He
then pronounces the offering-prayer to the Barhis. The barhis,
doubtless, means abundance, hence he thereby produces an abundance: this
is why he pronounces the prayer to the barhis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:5">1:5:4:5</span></span>5. He
then pronounces the offering-prayer with 'Svâhâ! Svâhâ!' The Svâhâ-call,
indeed, is what the winter is among the seasons; for the winter subjects
these creatures to its will: hence in winter the plants wither, and the
leaves fall off the trees; the birds retire more and more, and fly lower
and lower; and the wicked man has his hair, as it were, falling
off <span id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_365); for the winter subjects these
creatures to its will. And, verily, he who knows this, makes that
locality wherein he lives, his own, for his own happiness and supply of
food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:6">1:5:4:6</span></span>6. The
gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were once
contending for superiority. With staves and bows neither party were able
to overcome the other. Neither of them having gained the victory, they
(the Asuras) said, 'Well then, let us try to overcome one another by
speech, by sacred writ (brahman)! He who cannot follow up our uttered
speech by (making up) a pair, shall be defeated and lose everything, and
the other party

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

shall win everything!' The gods replied, 'So be it!' The gods said to
Indra, 'Speak thou!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:7">1:5:4:7</span></span>7. Indra
said, 'One (eka, m., unus) for me!' The others then said, 'One (ekâ, f.,
una) for us!' and thus found that (desired) pair, for eka (unus) and ekâ
(una) make a pair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:8">1:5:4:8</span></span>8. Indra
said, 'Two (dvau, m., duo) for me!' The others then said, 'Two (dve, f.,
duae) for us!' and thus found that pair, for dvau (duo) and dve (duae)
make a pair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:9">1:5:4:9</span></span>9. Indra
said, 'Three (traya*h*, m.) for me!' The others then said, 'Three
(tisra*h*, f.) for us!' and thus found that pair, for traya*h*. and
tisra*h* make a pair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:10">1:5:4:10</span></span>10.
Indra said, 'Four (*k*atvâra*h*, m.) for me!' The others then said,
'Four (*k*atasra*h*, f.) for us!' and thus found that pair, for
*k*atvâra*h* and *k*atasra*h* make a pair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:11">1:5:4:11</span></span>11.
Indra said, 'Five (pa*ñk*a, m. f., quinque) for me!' Then the others
found no pair, for after that (numeral four) there is no pair, for then
both (masculine and feminine) are pa*ñk*a. Thereupon the Asuras were
defeated and lost everything, and the gods won everything from the
Asuras, and stripped their rivals, the Asuras, of everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:12">1:5:4:12</span></span>12. For
this reason let him (the sacrificer) say <span
id="fr_369"></span>[1](#fn_366), when the first fore-offering has been
performed, 'One (eka) for me!' and 'One (ekâ) for him whom

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

we hate!' And if he should not hate any one, let him say, 'who hates us
and whom we hate!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:13">1:5:4:13</span></span>13.
With the second fore-offering, 'Two (dvau) for me!' and 'Two (dve) for
him who hates us and whom we hate!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:14">1:5:4:14</span></span>14.
With the third fore-offering, 'Three (traya*h*) for me!' and 'Three
(tisra*h*) for him who hates us and whom we hate!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:15">1:5:4:15</span></span>15.
With the fourth fore-offering, 'Four (katvâra*h*) for me!' and 'Four
(*k*atasra*h*) for him who hates us and whom we hate!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:4:16">1:5:4:16</span></span>16.
With the fifth fore-offering, 'Five (pa*ñk*a) for me!' and 'Nothing for
him who hates us and whom we hate!' For, there being 'five' to five,' he
(the enemy) is defeated, and whoever knows this, appropriates to himself
everything that belongs to that (enemy of his), strips his enemies of
everything.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_365"></span>[153:1](sbe1225.htm#fr_368) The Kâ*n*va
recension has, 'the beasts retire more and more, and the birds fly lower
and lower; and the vile-caste man (pâpavar*n*a*h* purusha*h*) has his
hair, as it were, falling off.'

<span id="fn_366"></span>[154:1](sbe1225.htm#fr_369) Viz. as
anumantra*n*a, or after-call, supplementary prayer, pronounced
immediately after the oblation has been poured into the fire. According
to Kâty. III, 3, 5, a second anumantra*n*a has to be added each time,
consisting of a single word, viz. 'brilliant,' 'respectable,' 'famous,'
'holy,' 'an eater of food' \[suppl. 'may I become'\] respectively.
Differently the Black Ya*g*us; cf. Hillebrandt, p. 96, note 6.
