### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:1">1:3:4:1</span></span>1. They
should be green (fresh); for that is (what constitutes) their living
element, by that they are vigorous, by that possessed of strength: for
this reason they should be green.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:2">1:3:4:2</span></span>2. The
middle stick he lays down first (on the west side of the fire), with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 3), 'May the Gandharva Vi*s*vâvasu <span
id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_257) lay thee around

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

for the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou
(art) Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:3">1:3:4:3</span></span>3. He
then lays down the southern one, with the text (ib.), 'Thou art Indra's
arm for the security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer;
thou Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:4">1:3:4:4</span></span>4. He
then lays down the northern one, with the text (ib.), 'May
Mitra-Varu*n*a lay thee around in the north with firm law for the
security of the All! Thou art a fence to the sacrificer, thou Agni,
invoked and worthy of invocation!' They are indeed Agnis, and for that
reason he says, 'Agni, invoked and worthy of invocation!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:5">1:3:4:5</span></span>5.
Thereupon he puts on (the fire) a samidh (kindling-stick). He first
touches with it the middle enclosing-stick: thereby he first kindles
those (three Agnis). After that he puts it on the fire: thereby he
kindles the visible fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:6">1:3:4:6</span></span>6. He
puts it on <span id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_258), with the gâyatrî
stanza (Vâ*g*. S. II, 4), 'Thee, O Sage, who callest (the gods) to the
feast, we will kindle so as to shine brilliantly; thee, O Agni, mighty
at the sacrifice!' He thereby kindles the gâyatrî <span
id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_259); the gâyatrî, when kindled, kindles the
other metres; and the metres, when kindled, carry the sacrifice to the
gods.

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:7">1:3:4:7</span></span>7. By the
second kindling-stick (samidh), which he now puts on, he kindles the
spring; the spring, when kindled, kindles the other seasons; and the
seasons, when kindled, cause living beings to be produced and the plants
to ripen. He puts it on, with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. II, 5), 'A kindler
(samidh) art thou!' for the spring is indeed a kindler.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:8">1:3:4:8</span></span>8. When
he has put it on, he murmurs (ib.), 'May the sun guard thee from the
east against any imprecation!' for the enclosing-sticks serve for
protection on all (the other three) sides; and thereby he makes the sun
the protector on the east side, fearing 'lest the evil spirits, the
Rakshas, should rush in from the east:' for the sun is the repeller of
the evil spirits, the Rakshas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:9">1:3:4:9</span></span>9. By
that third kindling-stick, then, which he puts on at the
after-offerings <span id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_260), he kindles the
officiating priest (brâhma*n*a); and he, the priest, when kindled,
carries the sacrifice to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:10">1:3:4:10</span></span>10. He
now returns to the altar covered (with sacrificial grass). Having taken
two stalks of grass, he lays them down across (the barhis or grass
covering, with the tops to the north), with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. II,
5), 'Savit*ri*'s arms <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_261) are ye!' The
prastara bunch is indeed the top-knot (of the sacrifice); and he now
lays down these two crosswise as its eye-brows: thereby these two
(represent) the transverse eye-brows. The prastara, further,

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (represents) the
kshatra (or military class); and the other barhis the vi*s* (or, the
common Âryan people);--(and the two stalks he puts down between them)
for the sake of separating (vidh*ri*ti) the kshatra and the vi*s*: for
this reason he lays them down crosswise; and for this reason these two
(stalks) are called vidh*ri*ti.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:11">1:3:4:11</span></span>11. On
them he spreads the prastara, with the formula (Vâ*g*. S. II, 5), 'I
spread thee, soft as wool, pleasant to sit upon for the gods!' When he
says 'thee, soft as wool,' he means to say 'agreeable to the gods;' and
by 'pleasant to sit upon for the gods' he means to say 'forming a good
seat for the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:12">1:3:4:12</span></span>12. He
presses it down (with his left hand), with the text (ib.), 'May the
Vasus, the Rudras, the Âdityas sit on thee!' These three, that is, the
Vasus, the Rudras, and the Âdityas, namely, are (classes of) gods; and
these, he means to say, are to sit down on it. While it is still being
held down with his left hand,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:13">1:3:4:13</span></span>13. He
seizes the *g*uhû with his right, fearing 'lest the evil spirits, the
Rakshas, should enter there in the meantime;' for the officiating priest
(brâhma*n*a) is the repeller of the Rakshas: therefore, while it (the
prastara) is still being held down with his left hand,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:14">1:3:4:14</span></span>14. He
seizes the *g*uhû, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 6), 'Fond of butter art
thou, *G*uhû by name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and *G*uhû by
name;--'Sit down here with the favourite resort <span
id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_262) (or dainty) on the favourite seat!' The
upabh*ri*t (he takes), with the formula (ib.), 'Fond of butter art thou,
Upabh*ri*t

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

by name!' for fond of butter indeed it is, and Upabh*ri*t by name;--'Sit
down here with the favourite resort on the favourite seat!' The dhruvâ
(he takes) with 'Fond of butter art thou, Dhruvâ by name!' for fond of
butter indeed it is, and Dhruvâ by name;--'Sit down here with the
favourite resort on the favourite seat!' What other sacrificial food
there is, (he puts down on the prastara), with the formula, 'With the
favourite resort sit down on the favourite seat!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:15">1:3:4:15</span></span>15. He
lays the *g*uhû down on (the prastara), and the other spoons down below,
(viz. on the barhis, north of the *g*uhû, and so as not to touch it or
one another); for the *g*uhû assuredly is the kshatra, and the other
spoons (sru*k*) are the vi*s*: he thereby makes the kshatra superior to
the vi*s*. Hence the people here serve, from a lower position, the
Kshatriya seated above them: for this reason he places the *g*uhû upon
(the prastara) and the other spoons down below it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:3:4:16">1:3:4:16</span></span>16. He
touches the offerings, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 6), 'Safely they
have sat down,' for safely indeed they sat down;--'in the lap (yoni) of
divine truth!' for the sacrifice is indeed the lap of divine truth, and
in the sacrifice they sat down;--'Protect these, O Vish*n*u! protect the
sacrifice! protect the lord of sacrifice!' thereby he refers to the
sacrificer;--'Protect me, the leader of the sacrifice!' thereby he does
not exclude himself either from the sacrifice. Vish*n*u, assuredly, is
the sacrifice: hence it is to the sacrifice that he makes all that over
for protection. This is the reason why he says, 'Protect these, O
Vish*n*u!'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_256"></span>[90:1](sbe1214.htm#fr_257) The Brahman, or
supreme spirit (? or, sacred writ), is more than once identified with
the Palâ*s*a tree in the *S*atapatha Br., as in V, 2, 4, 18; VI, 6, 3,
7; XII, 7, 2, 15; and with the leaf of that tree (palâ*s*asya palâ*s*am)
in II, 6, 2, 8. \[? Cf. Rig-veda X, 31, 7, 'Which was the wood, which
was the tree, out of which they fashioned heaven and earth?' and Taitt.
Br. II, 8, 9, 6, 'Brahma was the wood, Brahma was that tree out of which
they fashioned heaven and earth;' also Ath.-veda X, 7, 38, 'The gods
form part of the divine essence (Skambha-Brahma) as branches of a
tree.'\]

<span id="fn_257"></span>[90:2](sbe1215.htm#fr_258) The genius
Vi*s*vâvasu is already mentioned in Rig-veda X, 85, 21 seq., and X, 139,
4, where Grassmann identifies him with the rainbow (cf. Roth, Nirukta
notes, p. 245). See also *S*at. Br. III, 2, 4, 2; XIV, 9, 4, 18.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[91:1](sbe1215.htm#fr_259) According to
Sâya*n*a, the two sticks or pieces of wood are put on the fire in a
manner similar to that in which the two âghâras or sprinklings of
clarified butter are made (see I, 4, 4-5); viz. the first in the
direction north-west to south-east, and the second from south-west to
north-east.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[91:2](sbe1215.htm#fr_260) The gâyatrî is the
first of the three principal metres, cf. [p. 80](sbe1213.htm#page_80),
note [3](sbe1213.htm#fn_241). It consists of three octo-syllabic pâdas,
of which Rig-veda I, 164, 25 says,--'The gâyatra, they say, has three
flames (or firebrands, samidh): therefore it excelled in grandeur and
power.'

<span id="fn_260"></span>[92:1](sbe1215.htm#fr_261) See I, 8, 2, 3.

<span id="fn_261"></span>[92:2](sbe1215.htm#fr_262) Bâhû, 'the two
arms,' is apparently taken here by our author both in its natural sense
and as the arms of the bow or arch, formed by the eye-brows. The barhis,
or grass covering of the altar, was, as we saw (I, 3, 3, 7), identified
with the beard and other hair of the body.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[93:1](sbe1215.htm#fr_263) Viz. the butter,
which is the dear resort, or home, of the gods; see I, 3, 2, 17.
Possibly, however, dhâman may here mean 'dainty.'
