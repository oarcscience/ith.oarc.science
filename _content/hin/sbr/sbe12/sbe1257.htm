<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:1">2:5:2:1</A></FONT></span>1. Now it was by means of the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati produced living beings. The beings produced by him ate (ghas) Varu<I>n</I>a's barley corn; for originally the barley belonged to Varu<I>n</I>a. And from their eating Varu<I>n</I>a's barley corn the name Varu<I>n</I>apragh&acirc;s&acirc;<I>h</I> (is derived).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:2">2:5:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. Varu<I>n</I>a seized them; and on being seized by Varu<I>n</I>a, they became rent all over&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and they lay and sat them down breathing in and breathing out. The out-breathing and in-breathing forsook them not, but all the other deities&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> forsook them; and owing to these two, the creatures did not perish.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:3">2:5:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati healed them by means of that oblation: both the creatures that were born and those that were unborn he delivered from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose; and his creatures were born without disease and blemish.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:4">2:5:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. Now when this (sacrificer) performs these offerings in the fourth month (after the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva), he does so either because thus Varu<I>n</I>a does not seize his offspring, or because the gods performed (the same offering); and both the children that have been born to him and those that are yet unborn he thereby delivers from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose, and his children are born without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings in the fourth month.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:5">2:5:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. At this (sacrifice) there are two altars and two fires&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The reason why there are two altars and two</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_393"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 393</FONT></A></p>  
<p>fires, is that thereby one frees the creatures from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose both ways,--on the one side (he frees) the upright, and on the other those looking to the ground: this is why there are two altars and two fires.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:6">2:5:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. On the northern (uttara) altar he raises the uttara-vedi (upper or north altar), not on the southern one. Varu<I>n</I>a, doubtless, is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: he thus makes the nobility superior (uttara) to the people; and hence people here serve the Kshatriya, placed above them. This is why he raises the uttara-vedi on the northern, not on the southern altar.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:7">2:5:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. In the first place there are those five oblations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. For by means of those five oblations Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati produced the creatures, with them he freed the creatures both ways from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose,--on the one side (he freed) the upright, and on the other those that tend to the ground: this is why there are those five oblations.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:8">2:5:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then follows a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni. Indra and Agni indeed are the out-breathing and in-breathing: thus this is like</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_394"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 394</FONT></A></p>  
<p>doing a good turn to one who has done him a good turn; for it is owing to these two that his creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_881"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> did not perish. Hence he now restores his creatures by means of the out-breathing and in-breathing, bestows out-breathing and in-breathing on them: this is why there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:9">2:5:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. On both (fires) there is an oblation of curds. It is on milk that the creatures subsist and by means of milk that they were preserved: hence it is with that by which they were preserved and whereon they subsist, that he delivers them both ways from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose,--on the one side (he delivers) the upright and on the other those looking to the ground. This is why there is an oblation of curds on both (fires).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:10">2:5:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. The northern one is offered to Varu<I>n</I>a, since it was Varu<I>n</I>a who seized his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) creatures: hence he thereby directly delivers them from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose. The southern one is offered to the Maruts. It is for the sake of diversity that it is offered to the Maruts; for a repetition he would undoubtedly commit, were he to offer both to Varu<I>n</I>a. Moreover, it was from the south that the Maruts intended to slay his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) creatures, and with that share he propitiated them: for this reason the southern (oblation of curds) belongs to the Maruts.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:11">2:5:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. Upon both (dishes of curds) he scatters kar&icirc;ra-fruits&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_886"></A><A HREF="#fn_882"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for with kar&icirc;ra-fruits Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_395"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 395</FONT></A></p>  
<p>bestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) thereby bestow happiness on the creatures.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:12">2:5:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. Upon both of them he also scatters <I>s</I>am&icirc;-leaves; for with <I>s</I>am&icirc;-leaves Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati bestowed bliss (<I>s</I>am) on the creatures, and so does he now thereby bestow bliss on the creatures.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:13">2:5:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Ka (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati); for by that cake on one potsherd to Ka Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati indeed bestowed happiness (ka) on the creatures, and so does he (the sacrificer) now bestow happiness on the creatures by that one-cup cake: this is why there is a cake on one potsherd for Ka.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:14">2:5:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. And on the first day, after husking and slightly roasting barley on the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;gni, they prepare therewith as many dishes of karambha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_887"></A><A HREF="#fn_883"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as there are members of the (sacrificer's) family, exceeded by one.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:15">2:5:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. At the same time they also prepare a ram and a ewe; and if he be able to procure wool other than from e<I>d</I>aka sheep, let him wash it and stick it on both the ram and the ewe; but should he not be able to procure wool other than from e<I>d</I>aka sheep, tufts of ku<I>s</I>a grass may also be (used).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:16">2:5:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. The reason why there are a ram and a ewe is chat the ram manifestly is Varu<I>n</I>a's victim, so that he thereby manifestly delivers the creatures from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose. They are made of barley, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten barley that Varu<I>n</I>a seized them. A pair they form, so that he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_396"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 396</FONT></A></p>  
<p>delivers the creatures from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose through conjugal union.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:17">2:5:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. The ewe he places on the southern, and the ram on the northern dish of curds; for in this way alone a proper union is effected, since the woman lies on the left (or north) side of the man.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:18">2:5:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. The Adhvaryu places all the (other) sacrificial dishes upon the northern altar; and the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> places on the southern altar that dish of curds (belonging to the Maruts).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:19">2:5:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. Having thus placed the sacrificial dishes, he churns the fire; and having churned it and placed it on (the hearth)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_884"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he offers thereon, The Adhvaryu in the first place says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_885"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, 'Recite to the fire that is being kindled!' Both (the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) then put firewood on (the fire) and both reserve one kindling-stick each; and they both pour out the first libation (&acirc;gh&acirc;ra). Thereupon the Adhvaryu says, 'Agn&icirc;dh, trim the fire!' Although the summons is given, the trimming does not take place (immediately)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_886"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:20">2:5:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. Thereupon the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> returns (to where the sacrificer's wife is seated). When he is about to lead the wife away, he asks her, 'With</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_397"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 397</FONT></A></p>  
<p>whom holdest thou intercourse?' Now when a woman who belongs to one (man) carries on intercourse with another, she undoubtedly commits (a sin) against Varu<I>n</I>a. He therefore thus asks her, lest she should sacrifice with a secret pang in her mind; for when confessed the sin becomes less, since it becomes truth; this is why he thus asks her. And whatever (connection) she confesses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_887"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> not, that indeed will turn out injurious to her relatives.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:21">2:5:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. He then makes her say the text (III, 44), 'We invoke the Maruts, the voracious consumers of enemies, delighting in their porridge.' This (verse) is (of like import) as the invitatory prayer she therewith invites them to these dishes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:22">2:5:2:22</A></FONT></span>22. Of these (dishes) there is one for each descendant; as many (children) as there are in the (sacrificer's) family, so many (dishes) there are, exceeded by one. There being one for each descendant, he thereby delivers from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose one by one the children born to him; and there being an additional one, he thereby delivers from Varu<I>n</I>a's</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_398"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 398</FONT></A></p>  
<p>noose those children of his that are as yet unborn: this is why there are (the same number of dishes) exceeded by one.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:23">2:5:2:23</A></FONT></span>23. (In the form of) dishes they are, because it is from dishes that food is eaten; and of barley they are prepared, because it was when they (the creatures) had eaten the barley corn that Varu<I>n</I>a seized them. From the winnowing basket she offers, because food is prepared by means of the winnowing basket. The wife offers (together with her husband): thus he delivers his offspring from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose through conjugal union.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:24">2:5:2:24</A></FONT></span>24. She offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the oblations, since the people do not eat offerings, and the Maruts are the people. Now when Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's creatures, being seized by Varu<I>n</I>a, became rent all over, and sat and lay them down, breathing in and breathing out, then the Maruts destroyed their sin; and so do the Maruts now destroy the sin of his (the sacrificer's) offspring. This is why she offers previously to the sacrifice, previously to the oblations.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:25">2:5:2:25</A></FONT></span>25. He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_893"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> offers in the southern fire, with the text (III, 45), 'Whatever (sin we have committed) in the village and forest,'--for both in the village and in the forest sin is committed;--'whatever in society and in our own self,'--by 'whatever (we have committed) in society,' he means to say 'against man;' and by 'whatever in our own self' (indriya), he means to say 'against the gods;'--'whatever sin</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_399"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 399</FONT></A></p>  
<p>we have here committed, that we expiate by offering, Sv&acirc;h&acirc;!'--whereby he says 'whatsoever sin we have committed, from all that we rid ourselves.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:26">2:5:2:26</A></FONT></span>26. Thereupon he mutters the (verse) addressed to Indra and referring to the Maruts.--Now when the Maruts destroyed the sin of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's creatures, he thought within himself, 'I hope they will not destroy my creatures.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:27">2:5:2:27</A></FONT></span>27. He muttered that (verse) addressed to Indra and referring to the Maruts. Indra indeed is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people; and the nobility are the controllers of the people: 'They shall be controlled,' he thought; and therefore (that verse, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. III, 46) is addressed to Indra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:28">2:5:2:28</A></FONT></span>28. 'Let there not, O Indra, be (fight) for us here in battles with the gods, since there is a share for thee in the sacrifice, O fiery one!--for thee, the mighty showerer of gifts, whose Maruts the song of the offerer stream-like celebrates.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:29">2:5:2:29</A></FONT></span>29. He then makes her say the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. III, 47), 'The men skilled in the work have done the work,'--those skilled in the work have indeed done the work;--'with pleasing song;'--for with song they have done it. 'Having done the work for the gods;'--for the gods indeed they have done the work; 'go home, ye companions!'--they are now together with her while she is led thither from an other place: hence she says, 'ye companions' (sa<I>k</I>&acirc;bh&ucirc;, 'being together'). 'Go home,' she says, because that wife doubtless is the hind part of the sacrifice, and he has just now made her take her seat to the east of the sacrifice. 'Home' doubtless means the house, and the house is a resting-place: hence he thereby makes her rest in that resting-place, the house.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_400"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 400</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:30">2:5:2:30</A></FONT></span>30. Having led her back (to her seat) the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> returns (to his place by the side of the southern altar). They now trim the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. When the fire has been trimmed, both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) make the second libation (of butter). Thereupon the Adhvaryu, having called (on the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra) for the '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,' chooses the Hot<I>ri</I>. The chosen Hot<I>ri</I> then seats himself on the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat beside the northern altar; and having seated himself, he urges (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) to proceed. Being thus urged to proceed, they both take up the spoons and step across (to the south side of the fires). After stepping across and calling for the '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer on the kindling-sticks!' and 'Pronounce the offering-prayer!' at each (subsequent fore-offering). Pouring (the butter in the spoons) together (into the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;) at the fourth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, they both proceed with the nine fore-offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:31">2:5:2:31</A></FONT></span>31. Thereupon the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>),</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_401"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 401</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni!' referring to Agni's butter-portion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Both (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) having taken four 'cuttings' of butter, they step across (to the north side of their respective fires). Having stepped across and called for the '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Pronounce the offering-formula to Agni!' After the 'Vasha<I>t</I>' has been uttered, they both pour out the oblation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:32">2:5:2:32</A></FONT></span>32. The Adhvaryu then says, 'Pronounce (the invitatory prayer) to Soma!' referring to Soma's butter-portion. Both having taken four cuttings of butter, they step across. Having stepped across and called for the '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,' the Adhvaryu says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to Soma!' After the 'Vasha<I>t</I>' has been uttered, they both pour out the oblation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:33">2:5:2:33</A></FONT></span>33. Thus whatever has to be done by speech, that the Adhvaryu does, and not the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>. Now as to why the Adhvaryu alone calls for the '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>.' Here indeed when the 'Vasha<I>t</I>' is pronounced,</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:34">2:5:2:34</A></FONT></span>34. The Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> is merely the imitator of what is done (by the Adhvaryu). For Varu<I>n</I>a is the nobility, and the Maruts are the people: hence he thereby makes the people the imitators, the followers of the nobility. But were the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> also to call for the '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,' he would doubtless make the people equal in power to the nobility: for this reason the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> does not call for the '<I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:35">2:5:2:35</A></FONT></span>35. The Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> sits down, after taking the two offering-spoons in his hand. The Adhvaryu then</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_402"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 402</FONT></A></p>  
<p>proceeds with those oblations,--viz. Agni's cake on eight potsherds, Soma's pap, Savit<I>ri</I>'s cake on twelve or eight potsherds, Sarasvat&icirc;'s pap, P&ucirc;shan's pap, and Indra and Agni's cake on twelve potsherds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:2:36">2:5:2:36</A></FONT></span>36. Thereupon, being about to proceed with those two oblations of curds, (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) exchange (the ram and ewe): the ram which was on the Maruts' (dish of curds) he (the Adhvaryu) places on that of Varu<I>n</I>a; and the ewe which was on Varu<I>n</I>a's (dish of curds) he (the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) places on that of the Maruts. Now the reason why they make this exchange, is this,--Varu<I>n</I>a is the nobility, and the male represents energy: hence they thereby bestow energy on the nobility. The female, on the other hand, is without energy; and the Maruts are the people: hence they thereby cause the people to be without energy. This is why they make this exchange.</p>

The northern one, belonging to the Adhvaryu, is to measure between four and five cubits along the west side, and between three and four cubits along the east side; the two sides being between six and eight cubits distant from each other. The southern altar, reserved for the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>; is to be of the usual size of the altar at the havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;. The ceremonies, detailed in I, 2, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as 4 and 5, have to be performed also on the present occasion. In the middle of the east side of the northern altar a stake is fixed in the ground. On the north side of the northern altar, and contiguous with it, a pit (<I>k</I>&acirc;tv&acirc;la), 1&#8531; cubits (the length of the wedge) square, is dug, so as to be separated on the west from the utkara (heap of rubbish) by a narrow passage. With the mould dug up from the pit, the so-called uttara-vedi (upper or north altar) is raised on the northern altar, either of the same dimensions as the pit (1&#8531; cubits square) or one third of the area of the northern altar, and so that the stake marks the middle of its east side. In the centre of this mound he makes a hollow (or 'navel'), a span square; and the whole mound is then bestrewed with fine gravel. The texts used while tracing the sides of the pit, thrice throwing the wooden sword within the marked-off space, and raising the uttara-vedi, are given V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. V, 9-10. During the night the uttara-vedi remains covered with udumbara or plaksha branches or with sacrificial grass. Next morning the two fires for the newly-constructed fireplaces are taken from the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, either by dividing the latter into two equal parts, or by means of two bundles of firewood (threefold bound, see <A HREF="sbe1256.htm#page_389">p. 389</A>, note <A HREF="sbe1256.htm#fn_870">1</A>), lighted at it, and carried eastwards in a pan covered with sand or mould. While the fires, together with the lustral water and a spoonful of ghee, taken from the pot by five ladlings with the sruva, are taken eastward, the Hot<I>ri</I> thrice recites the verse 'Pra devyam deva,' &amp;c.; and the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> draws, with the wooden sword, a line from the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya to the south-west corner (or 'right hip') of the northern altar, or to the uttara-vedi. The Adhvaryu, standing between the two altars, then besprinkles the uttara-vedi with water, while muttering the <A NAME="page_393"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 393</FONT></A> texts V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. V, II; whereupon he pours out on it crosswise the spoonful of clarified butter, with the texts V, 12; and lays, with the mantras V, 13, three enclosing-sticks (paridhi) of p&icirc;tad&acirc;ru wood round the 'navel' (see I, 3, 4, 2 seq.), and puts bdellium, fragrant reed-grass, and the front-hair of a ram on the 'navel' as a foundation (sambh&acirc;ra, see II, 1, 1, 1 seq.) for the fire, which is then laid down thereon. On a hearth-mound (khara), a cubit square, formed on the southern altar, the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> also lays down his fire, after performing the usual fivefold lustration (see <A HREF="sbe1203.htm#page_2">p. 2</A>). Thereupon the pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;-water is brought forward in the way set forth at I, 1, 1, 12 seq. K&acirc;ty. V, 3, 9-4, 21.

V, 5, 30-33, and the scholiasts supply the <A HREF="errata.htm#10">following</A> particulars: The sacrificer and his wife, accompanied by the priests, are to repair to some quiet part of flowing water. The Adhvaryu then takes the sacrificer by the arm and makes him enter the water. Thereupon he himself enters, strews sacrificial grass on the water, puts a stick on it, and thereon offers a spoonful of butter to Agni. Then follow six oblations, viz. four fore-offerings, performed in the usual way (the one to the Barhis being omitted); <A NAME="page_407"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 407</FONT></A> an oblation of butter to Varu<I>n</I>a, and another of the scrapings of curds to Agni and Varu<I>n</I>a. Other authorities offer ten oblations instead of six, viz. four fore-offerings, two 'butter-portions' to Agni and Soma, the two oblations to Varu<I>n</I>a and Agni-Varu<I>n</I>a, and two after-offerings. The Adhvaryu then immerses the butter-pot, with the text V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. III, 48. Thereupon the sacrificer and his wife bathe without diving, but wash each other's back. They then come out of the water and put on fresh clothes.</P>
