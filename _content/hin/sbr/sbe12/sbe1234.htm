<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:1">1:8:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. In the morning they brought to Manu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_506"></A><A HREF="#fn_503"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> water for washing, just as now also they (are wont to) bring (water) for washing the hands. When he was washing himself, a fish came into his hands.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:2">1:8:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. It spake to him the word, 'Rear me, I will save thee!' 'Wherefrom wilt thou save me?' 'A flood will carry away all these creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_507"></A><A HREF="#fn_504"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: from that I will save thee!' 'How am I to rear thee?'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:3">1:8:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. It said, 'As long as we are small, there is great destruction for us: fish devours fish. Thou wilt first keep me in a jar. When I outgrow that, thou wilt dig a pit and keep me in it. When I outgrow that, thou wilt take me down to the sea, for then I shall be beyond destruction.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:4">1:8:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. It soon became a <I>gh</I>asha (a large fish); for that grows largest (of all fish)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_508"></A><A HREF="#fn_505"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Thereupon it said, 'In such and such a year that flood will come. Thou</p>

<p>shalt then attend to me (i.e. to my advice) by preparing a ship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_509"></A><A HREF="#fn_506"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and when the flood has risen thou shalt enter into the ship, and I will save thee from it.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:5">1:8:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. After he had reared it in this way, he took it down to the sea. And in the same year which the fish had indicated to him, he attended to (the advice of the fish) by preparing a ship; and when the flood had risen, he entered into the ship. The fish then swam up to him, and to its horn he tied the rope of the ship, and by that means he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_510"></A><A HREF="#fn_507"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> passed swiftly up to yonder northern mountain.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:6">1:8:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. It then said, 'I have saved thee. Fasten the ship to a tree; but let not the water cut thee off&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_511"></A><A HREF="#fn_508"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, whilst thou art on the mountain. As the water</p>

<p>subsides, thou mayest gradually descend!' Accordingly he gradually descended, and hence that (slope) of the northern mountain is called 'Alarm's descent&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_512"></A><A HREF="#fn_509"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' The flood then swept away all these creatures, and Manu alone remained here.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:7">1:8:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. Being desirous of offspring, he engaged in worshipping and austerities. During this time he also performed a p&acirc;ka-sacrifice: he offered up in the waters clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds. Thence a woman was produced in a year: becoming quite solid&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_513"></A><A HREF="#fn_510"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> she rose; clarified butter gathered in her footprint. Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a met her.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:8">1:8:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. They said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Manu's daughter,' she replied. 'Say (thou art) ours,' they said. 'No,' she said, 'I am (the daughter) of him who begat me.' They desired to have a share in her. She either agreed or did not agree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_514"></A><A HREF="#fn_511"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, but passed by them. She came to Manu.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:9">1:8:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. Manu said to her, 'Who art thou?' 'Thy daughter,' she replied. 'How, illustrious one, (art thou) my daughter?' he asked. She replied,</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'Those offerings (of) clarified butter, sour milk, whey, and curds, which thou madest in the waters, with them thou hast begotten me. I am the blessing (benediction): make use of me at the sacrifice! If thou wilt make use of me at the sacrifice, thou wilt become rich in offspring and cattle. Whatever blessing thou shalt invoke through me, all that shall be granted to thee!' He accordingly made use of her (as the benediction) in the middle of the sacrifice; for what is intermediate between the fore-offerings and the after-offerings, is the middle of the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:10">1:8:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. With her he went on worshipping and performing austerities, wishing for offspring. Through her he generated this race, which is this race of Manu; and whatever blessing he invoked through her, all that was granted to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:11">1:8:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now this (daughter of Manu) is essentially the same as the I<I>d</I>&acirc;; and whosoever, knowing this, performs with (the) I<I>d</I>&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_515"></A><A HREF="#fn_512"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he propagates this race which Manu generated; and whatever blessing he invokes through it (or her), all that is granted to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:12">1:8:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. It (the i<I>d</I>&acirc;) consists of a fivefold cutting; for the i<I>d</I>&acirc;, doubtless, means cattle, and cattle consist of five parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_516"></A><A HREF="#fn_513"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: for this reason it (the i<I>d</I>&acirc;) consists of a fivefold cutting.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:13">1:8:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. When he (the Adhvaryu) has cut off the i<I>d</I>&acirc; piece by piece&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_517"></A><A HREF="#fn_514"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and broken off the fore-part of the</p>

<p>cake (for the sacrificer's portion), he puts it (the latter) down (on the barhis) before the dhruv&acirc;-spoon. Having then handed over the former (the i<I>d</I>&acirc;) to the Hot<I>ri</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_518"></A><A HREF="#fn_515"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he passes by him towards the south.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:14">1:8:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. He anoints the Hot<I>ri</I> here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_519"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (with clarified butter taken from the i<I>d</I>&acirc;); and with it the Hot<I>ri</I> anoints his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered by the lord of the mind, I eat for sap, for out-breathing!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:15">1:8:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. He then anoints the Hot<I>ri</I> here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_520"></A><A HREF="#fn_516"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and with it the Hot<I>ri</I> anoints his lips, with the text, 'Of thee, offered by the lord of speech, I eat for strength, for in-breathing!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:16">1:8:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), 'This (part) of my sacrifice--that is, this i<I>d</I>&acirc; representing the domestic offering--is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not</p>

<p><A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A></p>  
<p>injure my sacrifice at this place.' Accordingly by that (butter, taken from the i<I>d</I>&acirc;, and smeared on his lips) he promoted it (the i<I>d</I>&acirc; to a safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And in like manner this one also thereby promotes (the i<I>d</I>&acirc; to a safe place, thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And though he does not (at present) eat (the i<I>d</I>&acirc;) visibly, lest he should eat it before it is invoked, he nevertheless promotes it (to a safe place), when he smears the (butter) on his lips.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:17">1:8:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. He now cuts off piece by piece (the av&acirc;ntare<I>d</I>&acirc;) in (or, into) the Hot<I>ri</I>'s hand. That which is cut up piece by piece he thus makes visibly enter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_521"></A><A HREF="#fn_517"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the Hot<I>ri</I>; and through that which has entered (or is cooked in) his own self, the Hot<I>ri</I> invokes a blessing on the sacrificer: for this reason he cuts it off piece by piece in the Hot<I>ri</I>'s hand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_522"></A><A HREF="#fn_518"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:18">1:8:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. He now calls&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_523"></A><A HREF="#fn_519"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (the i<I>d</I>&acirc;) in a low voice. At that time, namely, Manu became apprehensive (thinking), 'This (part) of my sacrifice--that is, this i<I>d</I>&acirc;</p>

<p>representing the domestic offerings--is certainly the weakest: the Rakshas must not injure my sacrifice at this place.' He accordingly called it to him in a low voice (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!' And in like manner this one (the Hot<I>ri</I>) thereby calls it (thinking), 'Before the Rakshas (come)! before the Rakshas (come)!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:19">1:8:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. He calls thus (in a low voice)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_524"></A><A HREF="#fn_520"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, 'Hither is called the Rathantara (chant), together with the earth: may the Rathantara, together with the earth, call me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_525"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>! Hither is called the V&acirc;madevya (chant), together with the atmosphere: may the V&acirc;madevya, together with the atmosphere, call me! Hither is called the B<I>ri</I>hat (chant), together with the sky: may the B<I>ri</I>hat, together with the sky, call me!' In thus calling her (the I<I>d</I>&acirc;) to him, he calls to him both these (three) worlds and those chants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_526"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:20">1:8:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. 'Hither are called the cows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_527"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, together with the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A></p>  
<p>bull!'--the i<I>d</I>&acirc;, assuredly, means cattle: hence it is her he thereby calls in an indirect (mystic) way; (and in saying), 'together with the bull,' he calls her together with her mate.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:21">1:8:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. 'Hither is called (I<I>d</I>&acirc;) by that (sacrifice) which is performed by the seven Hot<I>ri</I>s!'--he thereby calls her by the Soma-sacrifice performed by the seven Hot<I>ri</I>s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_528"></A><A HREF="#fn_524"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:22">1:8:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. 'Hither is called I<I>d</I>&acirc;, the conquering!'--he thereby calls her directly. 'Conquering' he says, because she overcomes evil, and for that reason he calls her 'the conquering.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:23">1:8:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. 'Hither is called the friend, the food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!'--the friend, the food, doubtless, means breath: hence he thereby calls hither the breath. 'Hither is called the Hek&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!'--he thereby calls hither the (body of i<I>d</I>&acirc;), he thereby calls hither the entire (i<I>d</I>&acirc;).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:24">1:8:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. He now intones (in a loud voice): 'I<I>d</I>&acirc; is called hither! Hither (thither) is called I<I>d</I>&acirc;! May I<I>d</I>&acirc; also call us to her!' In saying, 'I<I>d</I>&acirc; is called</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_224"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 224</FONT></A></p>  
<p>hither,' he, in a direct way, calls her, who is thereby called hither, as being what she really was: a cow, assuredly, she was, and a cow is four-footed; and therefore he calls her four times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:25">1:8:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. But in calling her four times, he calls her in different ways, in order to avoid repetition (of sacrificial performance); for, if he were to call, 'I<I>d</I>&acirc; is called hither! I<I>d</I>&acirc; is called hither!' or 'Hither is called Ida! hither is called I<I>d</I>&acirc;!' he would indeed commit the (fault of) repetition. By saying, 'I<I>d</I>&acirc; is called hither!' he calls her hitherwards; and by 'Hither (or thither, lit. called to somebody) is called I<I>d</I>&acirc;!' he calls her thitherwards. By saying, 'May I<I>d</I>&acirc; also call us to her,' he does not omit himself, and, besides, it (the formula) is changed. By (the second), 'I<I>d</I>&acirc; is called hither!' he again calls her hitherwards; so that he thereby (and by the second, 'Hither is called I<I>d</I>&acirc;,' again) calls her hitherwards and thitherwards.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:26">1:8:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. 'Manu's daughter, the butter-pathed (gh<I>ri</I>tapad&icirc;);'--Manu, indeed, begat her of old: for this reason he says, 'Manu's daughter.' 'The butter-pathed' he says, because butter gathered in her footprint: therefore he calls her 'butter-pathed.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:27">1:8:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. And further, 'She who belongs to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a;'--this 'Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a nature' (is hers), because she met Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_532"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.--'She, the god-fashioned one, is called hither as the Brahman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for she, the god-fashioned one, is indeed called hither as their Brahman.--'Hither are called the divine Adhvaryus, called hither the human!'--he thereby calls both the divine Adhvaryus and those that are human: the divine Adhvaryus indeed are the calves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_530"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (vats&acirc;<I>h</I>), and what others there are, are the human ones.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:28">1:8:1:28</A></FONT></span>28. '--They who are to prosper this sacrifice, they who are to prosper the lord of sacrifice.' Those Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, who have studied and teach the Veda, assuredly prosper the sacrifice, since they spread (perform) and produce it: these he thereby propitiates. And the calves also assuredly make the lord of sacrifice prosper; for the lord of sacrifice who possesses abundance of them, does indeed prosper; for this reason he says, 'They who are to prosper the lord of sacrifice.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:29">1:8:1:29</A></FONT></span>29. 'Hither are called the primeval, law-abiding, divine (fem.) heaven and earth, whose sons are gods.' He thereby calls to him those two, heaven and earth, within which all this (universe) is embraced.--'Hither is called this sacrificer:' thereby he calls the sacrificer to him. Why he does not mention his name on this occasion, is that this is a mysterious benediction on the i<I>d</I>&acirc;. Were he, on the contrary, to mention the name, he would do what is human, and the human certainly is inauspicious at the sacrifice: hence he does not mention</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the name, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_531"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:30">1:8:1:30</A></FONT></span>30. 'Hither (he is) called for future worship of the gods;' he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on this (sacrificer); for as he sacrificed heretofore, so, while living, he will sacrifice hereafter.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:31">1:8:1:31</A></FONT></span>31. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of offspring for him; for whosoever has offspring,--while he, on his part, goes to yonder world, his offspring sacrifice in this world: hence future worship of the gods means offspring.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:32">1:8:1:32</A></FONT></span>32. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of cattle for him; for whosoever has cattle, will sacrifice hereafter, as he has sacrificed heretofore.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:33">1:8:1:33</A></FONT></span>33. 'Hither (he is) called for more abundant havis-offering;' he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of life on him; for as he has sacrificed heretofore, so while living will he hereafter again and again make offerings.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:34">1:8:1:34</A></FONT></span>34. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of offspring for this (sacrificer); for whosoever possesses offspring,--though he, of his own self, be one only, yet that offering is made tenfold by his offspring: hence offspring means more abundant offering.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:35">1:8:1:35</A></FONT></span>35. Moreover, he thereby in a mysterious manner invokes the blessing of cattle for him; for whosoever possesses cattle, will make offering again and again, as he has sacrificed heretofore.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:36">1:8:1:36</A></FONT></span>36. This then is the benediction (implied in these formulas), 'May I live, may I have offspring, may</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> I obtain prosperity!' Now in praying for the blessing of cattle, he prays for prosperity; for cattle means prosperity: hence through these two benedictions everything is obtained; and therefore these two benedictions are here pronounced.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:8:1:37">1:8:1:37</A></FONT></span>37.

II, 10 remarks: When the Hot<I>ri</I> pronounces the call to heaven and earth, then he (the Adhvaryu), having put one piece of each of the two cakes in (the two bowls of) the Sha<I>d</I>avatta (vessel), gives it to the Agn&icirc;dh; and the latter eats it with the formulas 'Hither is called (the mother Earth),' &amp;c. The 'six cuttings' of the Sha<I>d</I>avatta consist of a piece of the Agni cake with an 'underlayer' and a dripping of butter for each of the two bowls of the Sha<I>d</I>avatta dish.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_537"></A><A HREF="sbe1234.htm#fr_541">229:2</A> That is, the formula 'Hither is called the sacrificer,' see par. 29.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_538"></A><A HREF="sbe1234.htm#fr_542">229:3</A> The priests eat first their quarter of the cake and then, with the sacrificer, their share of the i<I>d</I>&acirc;. The Hot<I>ri</I> eats also the av&acirc;ntare<I>d</I>&acirc;, with the text (&Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>. I, 7, 8), 'O I<I>d</I>&acirc;, accept graciously our share!' &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_539"></A><A HREF="sbe1234.htm#fr_543">230:1</A> See I, 3, 2, 5 seq. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text omits this paragraph.</P>
