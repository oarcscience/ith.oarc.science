### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:1">1:4:3:1</span></span>1. The
fire that has been kindled by means of the kindling verses, assuredly,
blazes more brightly than any other fire; for, indeed, it is
unassailable, unapproachable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:2">1:4:3:2</span></span>2. And in
like manner as the fire blazes when kindled by means of the kindling
verses, so also blazes the priest (brâhma*n*a) that knows and recites
the kindling verses; for, indeed, he is unassailable, unapproachable.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:3">1:4:3:3</span></span>3. He
recites, 'Pra va*h* <span id="fr_315"></span>[1](#fn_313);' for the
(word) prâ*n*a contains the syllable pra ('forwards;' or, is directed
forwards):. hence it is the prâ*n*a (out-breathing) which he kindles by
this (the first sâmidhenî). \[He further recites the second verse\],
'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' the backward breathing (apâna) <span
id="fr_316"></span>[2](#fn_314), doubtless, is of this nature: the
backward breathing he accordingly kindles with this (verse). Further (in
the third verse), 'Shine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!' the
high-flaming one <span id="fr_317"></span>[3](#fn_315), indeed, is the
upward breathing (udâna): the upward

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

breathing he accordingly kindles with this (the third verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:4">1:4:3:4</span></span>4.
Further, 'Sa na*h* p*ri*thu *s*ravâyyam <span
id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_316),' the 'far-hearing one,' indeed, is the
ear, for it is with the ear that one hears here far or widely: the ear
he accordingly kindles with this (the fourth verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:5">1:4:3:5</span></span>5.
Further, 'Praiseworthy he, adorable;' the praiseworthy <span
id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_317) one, doubtless, is the voice; for it is
the voice which praises everything here; by the voice everything is
praised here: he accordingly kindles the voice with this (the fifth
verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:6">1:4:3:6</span></span>6.
Further, 'Yea, as a horse that bears (to) the gods;' that which conveys
to the gods is indeed the mind, for it is the mind which chiefly conveys
the wise man (to the gods): the mind he accordingly kindles with this
(the sixth verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:7">1:4:3:7</span></span>7.
Further, 'O Agni, thee, that brightly shines!' the eye, assuredly,
shines: the eye he accordingly kindles by this (the seventh verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:8">1:4:3:8</span></span>8.
Further, 'Agni we choose for messenger,'--what central breath there is
(in the body), that he kindles with this (the eighth verse): that one
indeed is the internal motive force of the breathings; from it (two)
others tend upwards, and from it (two) others tend downwards, for it is
indeed the internal motive force. And whosoever knows that internal
motive force of the breathings, him they regard as the internal motive
force.

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:9">1:4:3:9</span></span>9.
Further, 'The flaming-locked, him we adore!' the flaming-locked,
doubtless, is the *s*i*s*na, for it is that organ which chiefly burns
(torments) him who is endowed with it: the *s*i*s*na he accordingly
kindles by this (the ninth verse).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:10">1:4:3:10</span></span>10.
Further, 'O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit! what downward breathing
there is that he kindles with this (the tenth verse); 'make offerings,
do reverence!' with this (the eleventh verse) he kindles the entire body
from the nails to the hair.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:11">1:4:3:11</span></span>11. And
if any one were to curse this one (the Hot*ri*) at the (recitation of
the) first kindling verse, then he (the Hot*ri*) should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own out-breathing into the fire: by that
out-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering!' for this is what
would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:12">1:4:3:12</span></span>12. If
any one were to curse him at the second (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own in-breathing into the fire: by that
in-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering!' for this is what
would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:13">1:4:3:13</span></span>13. If
any one were to curse him at the third (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own up-breathing into the fire: by that
up-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering!' for this is what
would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:14">1:4:3:14</span></span>14. If
any one were to curse him at the fourth (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own ear into the fire: by that ear of thine
shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become deaf!' for this is what
would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:15">1:4:3:15</span></span>15. If
any one were to curse him at the fifth (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own voice into the fire: by that voice of

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become dumb!' for this is
what would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:16">1:4:3:16</span></span>16. If
any one were to curse him at the sixth (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own mind into the fire: by that mind of
thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt move about as one
possessed with the (demon) "mind-stealer," as one deranged in mind!' for
this is what would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:17">1:4:3:17</span></span>17. If
any one were to curse him at the seventh (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own eye into the fire: by that eye of thine
shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become blind!' for this is what
would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:18">1:4:3:18</span></span>18. If
any one were to curse him at the eighth (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own central breath into the fire: by that
central breath of thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt expire
and die!' for this is what would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:19">1:4:3:19</span></span>19. If
any one were to curse him at the ninth (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own organ into the fire: by that organ of
thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt become emasculate!' for
this is what would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:20">1:4:3:20</span></span>20. If
any one were to curse him at the tenth (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast put thine own down-breathing into the fire: by that
down-breathing of thine shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt die
from constipation!' for this is what would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:21">1:4:3:21</span></span>21. If
any one were to curse him at the eleventh (verse), he should say to him,
'Thereby thou hast

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

put thine entire body into the fire: with that entire body of thine
shalt thou undergo suffering, thou shalt swiftly pass to yonder world!'
for this is what would take place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:3:22">1:4:3:22</span></span>22. For
in like manner as one undergoes suffering on approaching the fire that
has been kindled by means of the kindling verses, so also does one
undergo suffering for cursing a priest (brâhma*n*a) who knows and
recites the kindling verses.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_313"></span>[120:1](sbe1219.htm#fr_315) The first two words
of the first sâmidhenî, cf. [p. 101](sbe1217.htm#page_101) note. A
mystic meaning is obtained for them by our author combining them and
identifying the form obtained with the adjective pravant, meaning both
'containing the syllable pra' and 'directed forwards,' both of which
meanings apply to the breathing-forth or expiration (prâ*n*a, cf. I, 1,
3, 2).

<span id="fn_314"></span>[120:2](sbe1219.htm#fr_316) Bahir nirgatasya
vâyor âtmâbhimukhî v*ri*ttir by apâna*h*, udânavâyur dehasyotkshepa*n*âd
adhikate*g*oyukta*h*. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[120:3](sbe1219.htm#fr_317) The author
apparently takes b*ri*ha*kkh*o*k*â(*h*) as a compound.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[121:1](sbe1219.htm#fr_318) 'That (region) wide
and glorious' (do thou obtain for us); but the author takes p*ri*thu
*s*ravâyyam as 'that widely hearing one' or 'the wide hearing.'
Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. S. II, 5, 8, interprets it by 'that (holy work)
which is extended and worthy of being heard by the gods.'

<span id="fn_317"></span>[121:2](sbe1219.htm#fr_319) He apparently takes
îdenya in an active sense.
