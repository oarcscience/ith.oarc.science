### SIXTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:1">2:6:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew V*ri*tra, and
gained that supreme authority which they now wield. And by means of the
sacrifice to the fathers they then recalled to life those of them that
had been slain in this battle; and they, indeed, were the fathers: hence
the name Pit*ri*ya*gñ*a <span id="fr_942"></span>[1](#fn_938) (sacrifice
to the Manes).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:2">2:6:1:2</span></span>2. Now
the spring, the summer, and the rainy season,--they are those who
vanquished (V*ri*tra); and the autumn, the winter, and the dewy
season,--they are those whom they (the gods) recalled to life <span
id="fr_943"></span>[2](#fn_939).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:3">2:6:1:3</span></span>3. Now
when he performs that sacrifice, he does so, hoping that thus they (the
Asuras) will not slay any of his, or because the gods did so (perform
it). Moreover he thereby offers to those (fathers) the share which the
gods assigned to them; and thus he gratifies those whom the gods
recalled to life, and leads his own fathers up to a better world; and
whatever injury or loss he suffers through his own unrighteous conduct
(or wrong sacrificial performance) <span id="fr_944"></span>[3](#fn_940)
that is thereby made good to him: that is why he performs this sacrifice
(to the fathers).

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:4">2:6:1:4</span></span>4. He
offers a cake on six potsherds to the Pitara*h* Somavanta*h*, or to Soma
Pit*ri*mat <span id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_941). Six doubtless are the
seasons, and the fathers are the seasons: hence it is one of six
potsherds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:5">2:6:1:5</span></span>5.
Thereupon they parch barley-grain on the Anvâhâryapa*k*ana (or
Dakshi*n*âgni) for the Pitaro Barhishada*h* <span
id="fr_946"></span>[2](#fn_942). They then grind one half of it; and
(the other) half remains thus unground,--this is the parched grain for
the Barhis-seated fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:6">2:6:1:6</span></span>6. Then a
porridge is (prepared) for the Pitaro ’gnishvâttâ*h* <span
id="fr_947"></span>[3](#fn_943) (by the ground half of the parched
grain) being mixed with the milk of a cow suckling an adopted calf, by
stirring it once with a single splinter. It is indeed once for all that
the fathers have departed, and hence is stirred but once. These are the
oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:7">2:6:1:7</span></span>7. Now
those (fathers) who have sacrificed with Soma are the Pitara*h*
Somavanta*h*; and those who gain the world (of the gods) by means of
cooked (sacrificial food) offered by them are the Pitaro Barhishada*h*;
and they who (have offered) neither the one nor the other, and whom Agni
consumes by burning, they are the Pitaro ’gnishvâttâ*h*. These, then,
are the fathers <span id="fr_948"></span>[4](#fn_944).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:8">2:6:1:8</span></span>8. He
takes out \[the rice for\] that cake of six potsherds, while seated
behind the Gârhapatya, and looking southwards, with the sacrificial cord
over his right shoulder. From thence he rises and

<span id="page_422">p. 422</span>

threshes (the rice), while standing north of the Dakshi*n*a-fire, with
his face towards the south. He cleans it but once <span
id="fr_949"></span>[1](#fn_945); since it is once for all that the
fathers have departed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:9">2:6:1:9</span></span>9. He
places the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to be
inclined) towards the south <span id="fr_950"></span>[2](#fn_946); and
puts the six potsherds on the south part of the Gârhapatya hearth. The
reason why they keep the southern direction is because that is the
region of the fathers: this is why they keep the southern direction.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:10">2:6:1:10</span></span>10.
Thereupon he raises a square altar south of the Dakshi*n*âgni <span
id="fr_951"></span>[3](#fn_947). He makes the corners point towards the
intermediate quarters. There are doubtless four intermediate quarters,
and the fathers are the intermediate quarters: this is why he makes the
corners point towards the intermediate quarters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:11">2:6:1:11</span></span>11. In
the centre of this (altar) he lays down the fire. From the east, indeed,
the gods came westwards to the men: hence one offers to them while
standing

<span id="page_423">p. 423</span>

with his face towards the east. On all sides are the fathers, for the
fathers are the intermediate regions, and the intermediate regions are
indeed on all sides: this is why he lays down the fire in the centre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:12">2:6:1:12</span></span>12.
From thence he throws the grass-bush (stambaya*g*us) eastwards <span
id="fr_952"></span>[1](#fn_948). Having thrown away the grass-bush, he
first encloses (the altar) thus (viz. on the west side), then thus (viz.
on the north side), then thus (on the east side). Having enclosed it
with the first line of enclosure, he (the Adhvaryu) draws (three) lines
(across the altar) <span id="fr_953"></span>[2](#fn_949) and \[the
Âgnîdhra\] removes (from them the dust) which has to be removed. In the
same way he encloses it with the second line of enclosure; and having
enclosed it with the second line of enclosure, and smoothed it down, he
says, 'Place the sprinkling water on (the altar)!' They accordingly
place the sprinkling water on (the altar); and the firewood and barhis
they lay down beside it <span id="fr_954"></span>[3](#fn_950). He (the
Âgnîdhra) wipes the spoons. He then walks up (to the altar) with the
butter (and

<span id="page_424">p. 424</span>

puts it down thereon <span id="fr_955"></span>[1](#fn_951), north of the
sprinkling water). He (the Adhvaryu) takes butter, while
'sacrificially-invested <span id="fr_956"></span>[2](#fn_952).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:13">2:6:1:13</span></span>13.
Here now they say, 'Let him take butter in the upabh*ri*t (by) twice
(ladling with the dipping spoon); since there are two
after-offerings <span id="fr_957"></span>[3](#fn_953) at this
(sacrifice).' Let him, nevertheless, ladle eight times into the
upabh*ri*t: let him do so, lest he should depart from the manner of the
sacrifice. After ladling out butter, and shifting his cord back to the
right shoulder,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:14">2:6:1:14</span></span>14. The
Adhvaryu takes the lustral water, and sprinkles first the firewood, and
then the altar <span id="fr_958"></span>[4](#fn_954). Thereupon they
hand the sacrificial grass <span id="fr_959"></span>[5](#fn_955) to him,
and he puts it down (on the altar) with the knot to the east. Having
thereupon sprinkled it and

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

poured out (the lustral water on the lower ends of the grass-stalks),
and untied the knot, he (at once) seizes the knot, not the
prastara <span id="fr_960"></span>[1](#fn_956);--it is once for all that
the fathers have departed: hence he does not take the prastara.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:15">2:6:1:15</span></span>15.
After undoing the band, he moves thrice <span
id="fr_961"></span>[2](#fn_957) round from right to left, spreading the
sacrificial grass all over (the altar); while spreading it all over from
right to left in three layers, he reserves as much as may serve for the
prastara-bunch. He then moves again thrice round (the altar) from left
to right. The reason why he again moves thrice round from left to right,
is that, while the first time he went away from here after those three
ancestors of his, he now cones back again from them to this, his own
world: that is why he again moves thrice round from left to right.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:16">2:6:1:16</span></span>16. He
lays the enclosing-sticks along (the fire, with their tops) towards the
south <span id="fr_962"></span>[3](#fn_958); and the prastara also he
spreads (with the grass-tops) towards the south; nor does he lay down
the two vidh*ri*tis between (the barhis and the prastara). Once for all
the fathers have departed from hence: therefore he lays no vidh*ri*tis
between.

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:17">2:6:1:17</span></span>17.
Thereon he lays the *g*uhû, and east of it (on the barhis) the
upabh*ri*t. Having then put down the dhruvâ, the cake, the parched
grain, and the porridge (each east of the preceding one), he touches the
oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:18">2:6:1:18</span></span>18. All
of them having now become 'sacrificially-invested,' the Sacrificer and
Brahman (being) thus (invested) walk round (from the east, along the
south) to the west side; and the Âgnîdhra (from the west) to the east
side (of the fire) <span id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_959).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:19">2:6:1:19</span></span>19.
They perform this (sacrifice) in a low voice. Secret, indeed, are the
fathers, and secret also is (what is spoken) in a low voice: hence they
perform (the offering) in a low voice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:20">2:6:1:20</span></span>20.
They perform it in an enclosed place. Secret, indeed, are the fathers,
and secret also is that which is enclosed: hence they perform in an
enclosed place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:21">2:6:1:21</span></span>21.
While putting firewood (on the fire), he then says (to the Hot*ri*),
'Recite to the fire, as it is being kindled!' Only (this) one
kindling-verse the Hot*ri* recites <span
id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_960), (and that) thrice;--the fathers have
departed once for all: hence the Hot*ri* recites thrice only one
kindling-verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:22">2:6:1:22</span></span>22. He
recites, 'Loving we deposit thee (O Agni), loving we enkindle thee: O
loving one, bring

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

hither the loving fathers to eat their oblation!' Thereupon he says,
'Bring Agni hither <span id="fr_965"></span>[1](#fn_961)! bring Soma
hither! bring hither the fathers, accompanied by Soma! bring hither the
fathers, seated on the barhis! bring hither the fathers, consumed by
Agni! bring hither the butter-drinking gods! bring hither Agni for the
Hot*ri*ship! bring hither (thine) own greatness <span
id="fr_966"></span>[2](#fn_962)!' Having thus called on (Agni) to bring
hither (the fathers and gods), he sits down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:23">2:6:1:23</span></span>23.
Having then called <span id="fr_967"></span>[3](#fn_963) for the
(Âgnîdhra's) '*S*rausha*t*,' he does not elect the Hot*ri*; for this
being a sacrifice to the Manes, he does not elect the Hot*ri* <span
id="fr_968"></span>[4](#fn_964), lest he should consign the Hot*ri* to
the Manes. He says, 'Hot*ri*, seat thyself!' and takes his seat. The
Hot*ri*, having sat down on the Hot*ri*'s seat, urges (the Adhvaryu) to
proceed; and thus urged, the Adhvaryu takes the two spoons and steps
across to the west (of the fire); and having stepped across and called
for the '*S*rausha*t*,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the
kindling-sticks!' He performs four fore-offerings <span
id="fr_969"></span>[5](#fn_965),

<span id="page_428">p. 428</span>

omitting the one to the Barhis; for the barhis means offspring, and he
therefore performs the four fore-offerings without the one to the
barhis, lest he should consign his offspring to the fathers. Thereupon
they proceed with the two butter-portions; and having offered the two
butter-portions,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:24">2:6:1:24</span></span>24.
They all shift their sacrificial cord over to the right shoulder, being
now about to proceed with those (chief) oblations. The Sacrificer and
Brahman, (being) thus (invested), step across (from the west) to the
east side, and the Âgnîdhra (from the east) to the west side (of the
fire). And furthermore, the (Adhvaryu's) call for the '*S*rausha*t*' is
'*Õm* svadhâ!' and the (Âgnîdhra's) response is 'Astu svadhâ <span
id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_966)!' and the Vashat-call is 'Svadhâ
nama*h*!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:25">2:6:1:25</span></span>25. As
to this, Âsuri said, 'Let them call for the Srausha*t* (by "Õ
*S*râvaya"), and let them respond with the "(Astu) *S*rausha*t*," and
let them pronounce the "Vashat," lest we should depart from the manner
of the sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:26">2:6:1:26</span></span>26.
\[The Adhvaryu\] then says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the
fathers, accompanied by Soma!' or '--to Soma, accompanied by the
fathers'!--Two invitatory prayers he (the Hot*ri*) pronounces (at the
offerings), because it is with one that one moves the gods, and with two
the fathers, since the fathers have departed once (for all) <span
id="fr_971"></span>[2](#fn_967): hence he pronounces two invitatory
prayers.

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:27">2:6:1:27</span></span>27.
\[The Adhvaryu\] makes an 'under-layer' of butter (in the *g*uhû or
offering-spoon). He then cuts a piece from the cake, and together
therewith some of the parched grain and the porridge <span
id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_968). This he puts down at the same time (in
the *g*uhû); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon; and re-anoints
(replenishes with butter, the parts of the sacrificial dishes from which
he has made) the cuttings. He does not walk over (to the south side of
the fire); but having risen and stepped up (to the fire) on the same
side (where he was seated), and called (on the Âgnîdhra) for the
'*S*rausha*t*,' he says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer
to the fathers, accompanied by Soma!' and pours the oblation (into the
fire) as soon as the Vasha*t* <span id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_969) has
been uttered.

<span id="page_430">p. 430</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:28">2:6:1:28</span></span>28.
Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the fathers,
seated on the barhis!' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes a
'cutting' from (the north part of) the parched grain, and together
therewith some of the porridge and the cake; puts down all this at the
same time (in the *g*uhû); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon, and
re-anoints (the places of) the cuttings. He does not walk across; but
having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side and called for the
'*S*rausha*t*,' he says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers,
seated on the barhis!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat
has been uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:29">2:6:1:29</span></span>29.
Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to the fathers,
consumed by the fire!' He then makes an under-layer of butter, takes a
cutting from (the south part of) the porridge, and therewith some of the
cake and the parched grains; puts down all this at the same time (in the
*g*uhû); makes two sprinklings of butter thereon, and re-anoints (the
places of) the cuttings. He does not walk across; but having stepped up
(to the fire) on the same side, and called for the '*S*rausha*t*,' he
says, 'Pronounce the offering-prayer to the fathers, consumed by the
fire!' and pours out the oblation as soon as the Vashat has been
uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:30">2:6:1:30</span></span>30.
Thereupon he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer to Agni
Kavyavâhana!' that being for (Agni as) the Svish*t*ak*ri*t ('maker of
good offering'). For to the gods indeed he is havyavâhana ('bearer of
oblations'), and to the fathers he is kavyavâhana ('the bearer of what
is meet for the wise'): hence he says, 'Pronounce the invitatory prayer
to Agni Kavyavâhana!'

<span id="page_431">p. 431</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:31">2:6:1:31</span></span>31. He
makes an under-layer of butter (in the offering-spoon); then cuts a
piece from (the front part of) the cake, and therewith some of the
parched grain and the porridge; puts down all this at the same time; and
makes two sprinklings of butter thereon. The (places from which he has
made the) cuttings he does not replenish with butter, nor does he walk
across; but having stepped up (to the fire) on the same side (where he
was seated), and called for the '*S*rausha*t*,' he says, 'Pronounce the
offering-prayer to Agni Kavyavâhana!' and pours out the oblation, as
soon as the Vasha*t* has been uttered.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:32">2:6:1:32</span></span>32. Now
the reason why he does not walk across (to the ordinary place of
offering), but pours out the oblation after stepping up (to the fire) on
the sane side, is that the fathers have departed once for all; and the
reason also, why he cuts but once from each of the sacrificial dishes,
is that the fathers have departed once for all. And the reason why in
making the cuttings, he keeps them together, is that the fathers are the
seasons;--he thus keeps the seasons together, joins them to one another:
that is why in making the cuttings, he keeps them together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:33">2:6:1:33</span></span>33.
Here now some hand over that entire (remaining) porridge to the Hot*ri*;
and the Hot*ri*, having invoked it <span
id="fr_974"></span>[1](#fn_970), smells it and hands it to the

<span id="page_432">p. 432</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brahman. The
Brahman smells it and hands it to the Âgnîdhra; and the Âgnîdhra also
smells it. And so indeed they do this. But, as from any other oblation
they cut off the Ida and the fore-portion, so let them cut from this
also; and having invoked it (the I*d*â) they smell it, but do not eat
it. 'But,' said Âsuri, 'we think that some should be eaten, of whatever
is offered up in the fire.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:34">2:6:1:34</span></span>34. Now
he who is about to present (the obsequial cakes to the fathers),--either
the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer,--takes the vessel of water and walks
thrice round (the altar) from right to left sprinkling all about (the
altar). He then, with the text, 'N.N., wash thyself <span
id="fr_975"></span>[1](#fn_971)!' pours out water (in the north-west
corner of the altar) for the Sacrificer's father <span
id="fr_976"></span>[2](#fn_972) to wash himself; and (in the southwest
corner), with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the grandfather; and (in the
south-east corner), with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the
great-grandfather.

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As one would pour
out water for (a guest) who is to take food with him, so in this case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:35">2:6:1:35</span></span>35.
Thereupon he takes one 'cutting' from the cake and puts it in his left
hand; from the parched grain also he takes one cutting and puts it in
his left hand; and from the porridge also he takes one cutting and puts
it in his left hand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:36">2:6:1:36</span></span>36. And
in the corner (of the altar) opposite this intermediate quarter (viz.
the north-west), he then presents (an obsequial cake <span
id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_973)) to the Sacrificer's father, with the
formula, 'N.N., this for thee!' And in the corner opposite this
intermediate quarter (the south-west), he presents one to the
Sacrificer's grandfather, with 'N.N., this for thee!' And in the corner
opposite this intermediate quarter (the southeast), he presents one to
the Sacrificer's great-grandfather, with 'N.N., this for thee!' And in
the corner opposite this intermediate quarter (the northeast), he
cleanses (his hands), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 31), 'Here, O
Fathers, regale yourselves! Like bulls come hither, each to his own
share!' whereby he means to say, 'Eat ye each his share!' And the reason
why he thus presents (food) to the Fathers is that in this way he does
not exclude his own fathers from this sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:37">2:6:1:37</span></span>37.
Thereupon they all, being sacrificially invested, walk out (of the shed)
on the north side, (pass along the east side of, and) stand by the
(north) side of, the Âhavanîya fire. For he who has established his
fires, and performs the New and Full-moon sacrifices, approaches the
gods; but they have just been

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

performing the sacrifice to the Manes, and therefore they now propitiate
the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:38">2:6:1:38</span></span>38.
They stand by the Âhavanîya fire (worshipping) with two (verses)
addressed to Indra \[viz. Rig-veda I, 82, 2-3; Vâ*g*. S. III, 51-52\],
since the Âhavanîya is Indra. 'The friends have eaten, and regaled
themselves, and have shaken off (the enemies) <span
id="fr_978"></span>[1](#fn_974); the self-shining bards have extolled
(thee) with their newest hymn: yoke, then, thy pair of bay steeds, O
Indra!--To thee, the splendid, we will sing praises, O bountiful one!
Thus praised, do thou now issue forth, with well-filled car, agreeably
to our desire! yoke, then, thy pair of bay steeds, O Indra!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:39">2:6:1:39</span></span>39.
Thereupon they return to the Gârhapatya and stand by it worshipping with
the verses (Rig-veda X, 57,3-5; Vâ*g*. S. III, 53-55), 'We invoke the
Mind with man-lauding strain <span id="fr_979"></span>[2](#fn_975), and
with the hymns of the fathers.--May the Mind come back to us for (us to
obtain) wisdom, vigour, and life, and that we may long see the sun!--May
the divine race restore to us the Mind, O Fathers, that we may abide
with the living kind!' They have indeed been performing the sacrifice to
the Manes; but now they return to the (land of the) living: hence he
says, 'That we may abide with the living kind!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:40">2:6:1:40</span></span>40.
Thereupon he who has presented (the obsequial cakes) again shifts his
sacrificial cord to the right shoulder and betakes. himself (to the fire
in the shed), and mutters (Vâ*g*. S. II, 31), 'The

<span id="page_435">p. 435</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fathers have
regaled themselves: like bulls they came each to his share:' whereby he
means to say, 'they have eaten each his own share.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:41">2:6:1:41</span></span>41. He
now takes the vessel of water and again, while sprinkling, walks thrice
round (the altar) from left to right (sunwise). With 'N.N., wash
thyself!' he pours out water (in the respective corner) for the
Sacrificer's father to wash himself; with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the
grandfather; with 'N.N., wash thyself!' for the great-grandfather. As
one would pour out water for (a guest) who has taken food with him, so
in this case. And as to his again walking thrice round from left to
right, while sprinkling,--they think, 'This holy work of ours shall be
accomplished sunwise <span id="fr_980"></span>[1](#fn_976),' and hence
he walks thrice round from left to right, while sprinkling.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:42">2:6:1:42</span></span>42. He
then pulls down the tuck (of the nether garment) <span
id="fr_981"></span>[2](#fn_977) and makes obeisance (to the Fathers).
The tuck, doubtless, is sacred to the Fathers: hence he makes obeisance
to them after pulling down the tuck; and obeisance means worship: hence
he thereby recognises them as entitled to worship. Six times he makes
obeisance to them, since there are six seasons, and the Fathers are the
seasons: hence he thereby establishes his sacrifice in the
seasons,--that is why he makes obeisance six times <span
id="fr_982"></span>[3](#fn_978). 'Give houses

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

unto us; O Fathers!' he (further) says, because the Fathers are the
guardians of houses;--and this is the prayer for blessing at this sacred
performance.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:43">2:6:1:43</span></span>43.
Being now about to proceed with the after-offerings, they all invest
themselves sacrificially (by shifting the cord over to the left
shoulder); and thus (invested) the Sacrificer and Brahman walk round to
the west, and the Âgnîdhra to the east, side; and the Hot*ri* sits down
on the Hot*ri*'s seat.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:44">2:6:1:44</span></span>44. He
(the Adhvaryu) then says, 'Brahman, I shall step forward.' Thereupon he
puts the stick (reserved at the time of kindling) on (the fire), and
says, 'Agnîdh, trim the fire!' He then takes the two spoons and crosses
over to the west side. After crossing over and calling for the
'*S*rausha*t*,' he says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Pronounce the offering-prayer
to the gods!' He performs two after-offerings, omitting the one to the
Barhis; for the Barhis means offspring: hence he performs two
after-offerings, omitting the one to the Barhis, lest he should consign
his offspring to the Fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:45">2:6:1:45</span></span>45. He
then separates the two spoons <span id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_979),
after laying them down (in their respective places on the altar); and
having separated them, and anointed the enclosing-sticks, he takes one
enclosing-stick, calls for the '*S*rausha*t*,' and says, 'The divine
Hot*ri*s are summoned for the proclamation of success, the human is
called upon for the song of praise!' The Hot*ri* intones the 'song of
praise (sûktavâka).' The Adhvaryu, on the other hand, does not seize the
prastara-bunch, but watches while the Hot*ri* recites the song of
praise.

<span id="page_437">p. 437</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:46">2:6:1:46</span></span>46.
Thereupon the Âgnîdhra says, 'Throw it after <span
id="fr_984"></span>[1](#fn_980)!' He (the Adhvaryu) throws nothing
after, but silently touches himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:47">2:6:1:47</span></span>47. He
(the Âgnîdhra) then says, 'Discourse together!' \[The Adhvaryu asks\],
'Has he gone (to the gods), Agnîdh?'--'He has gone!'--'Bid (the gods)
hear!'--'May one (or, they) hear!'--'Goodspeed to the divine Hot*ri*s!
Success to the human!--Pronounce the All-hail and blessing!' Thus
saying, he merely touches the enclosing-sticks, but does not (now) throw
them (into the fire). The Barhis and enclosing-sticks he throws in
afterwards <span id="fr_985"></span>[2](#fn_981).

<span class="margnote"><span id="2:6:1:48">2:6:1:48</span></span>48. And
here some throw also the remaining sacrificial food into the fire; but
let him not do so; for that (remaining havis) is the residue of an
offering; and lest he should offer the residue of an offering, let them
(the priests) rather throw it into the water or eat it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_938"></span>[420:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_942) This is generally
called the Mahâpit*ri*ya*gñ*a, as distinguished from the ordinary
monthly Pit*ri*ya*gñ*a of the new-moon sacrifice; for which see II, 4,
2, I seq.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[420:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_943) See II, 1, 3, 1
seq.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[420:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_944) Instead of
'á*k*ara*n*ena,' the Kâ*n*va MS. has '*k*ara*n*éna (!).' Cf. Sâya*n*a's
interpretation 'anu*k*ara*n*ena anugamanena *k*a.'

<span id="fn_941"></span>[421:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_945) That is, either to
'the fathers, accompanied by Soma (or possessed of Soma),' or to 'Soma,
accompanied by the fathers.' The Black Ya*g*us assigns the oblation to
Soma Pit*ri*mat.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[421:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_946) That is, 'the
fathers seated on the barhis.'

<span id="fn_943"></span>[421:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_947) That is, 'the
fathers consumed by the fire.'

<span id="fn_944"></span>[421:4](sbe1260.htm#fr_948) 'These, then, are
the three kinds of fathers,' Kâ*n*va recension.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[422:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_949) Not thrice, as at
an ordinary ish*t*i; see I, 1, 4, 23.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[422:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_950) Not towards the
east, as at the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa; cf. [p. 38](sbe1207.htm#page_38),
note [3](sbe1207.htm#fn_153). At offerings to the Manes the south, as a
rule, takes the place of the east, the west that of the south, &c.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[422:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_951) At the conclusion
of the Âptya ceremony (cf. I, 2, 2, 18-3, 5) he erects south of the
(ordinary) Dakshi*n*a-fire a (quadrangular) shed (see further on,
paragraph 20) with a door on the north side. Inside it he prepares a
quadrangular altar (of the same size as at the Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa; cf.
I, 2, 5, 14) with the corners towards the intermediate quarters, in the
centre of which he makes the (new) Dakshi*n*âgni hearth. \[According to
Taitt. Br. I, 6, 8, 5-6 no digging takes place in preparing the altar
(which is to be square) at the Pit*ri*ya*gñ*a.\] When the
Dakshi*n*a-fire is transferred to the new fire-place, the
Pra*n*îtâ-water (see [p. 9](sbe1203.htm#page_9), note) is carried after
it, followed by the Brahman and Sacrificer, and placed east (not north)
of the hearth. The laying down of the fire is preceded by the usual
fivefold lustration of the hearth (see [p. 2](sbe1203.htm#page_2)).

<span id="fn_948"></span>[423:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_952) Instead of
northwards, as is done at the normal ish*t*i; see I, 2, 4, 12 seq.

<span id="fn_949"></span>[423:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_953) After tracing the
first line of enclosure, the Adhvaryu draws three lines across the
altar, either from west to east or from south to north; and says to the
Âgnîdhra, 'Take thrice!' The latter then takes the dust from the lines
and throws it on the utkara (the heap of rubbish, formed north of the
altar in preparing the latter), and thereupon again obliterates them.
According to Kâty. II, 6, 29, the same ceremony may be performed at the
Dar*s*apûr*n*amâsa; but there no mention is made of it by our author
(see I, 2, 5, 12).

<span id="fn_950"></span>[423:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_954) Viz. the Âgnîdhra
lays them down between the altar and the pra*n*îtâ*h* (see [p.
422](#page_422), note [3](#fn_947)); the firewood behind (west of) the
sacrificial grass (barhis), and both with the tops towards the south.
The wooden sword also has been previously put down by the Adhvaryu close
behind the pra*n*îtâ*h*.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[424:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_955) The lady of the
house not being present at the sacrifice to the Manes, neither the
ceremony of girding (I, 3, 1, 12 seq.), nor that of her looking at the
butter--while it is taken from the Gârhapatya fire, along the east side
of the Âhavanîya to the altar--takes place on this occasion. According
to the commentators on Katy. V, 8, 25 (Paddh. p. 519), however, the
Adhvaryu has to look down on the butter, with the same text (Vâ*g*. S.
I, 30) which was used by the sacrificer's wife. For some details to be
supplied here, see I, 3, 1, 22-28.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[424:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_956) He has hitherto
worn his sacrificial cord on the right shoulder and under the left arm
('eastward-invested'), and now shifts it so as to be on the left
shoulder and under the right arm ('sacrificially-invested'). As to the
taking or ladling of butter into the offering-spoons, see I, 3, 2, 1
seq.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[424:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_957) See I, 3, 2, 9.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[424:4](sbe1260.htm#fr_958) See I, 3, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[424:5](sbe1260.htm#fr_959) The barhis, on this
occasion, must have been cut close to the root (upamûlam, II, 4, 2, 17;
ûpamûle ditam, Kâ*n*va rec.). According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 8, 6-7, on
the other hand, it has apparently to be torn up with the roots (yat
parushi dina*m* tad devânâm, yad antarâ tan manushyâ*n*âm, yat samûla*m*
tat pit*rîn*âm).

<span id="fn_956"></span>[425:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_960) As he did on the
former occasion, I, 3, 3, 5.

<span id="fn_957"></span>[425:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_961) According to Taitt.
Br. I, 6, 8, 7, because the fathers abide in the third world from here
(t*ri*tîye vâ ito loke pitara*h*).

<span id="fn_958"></span>[425:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_962) Viz. he is to lay
down the enclosing-sticks along the north, west, and east sides, the
last two with their tops towards the south. The third text (cf. I, 3, 4,
4) has, of course, to be changed to 'May Mitra-Varu*n*a lay thee around
in the east,' &c.; as has also the one he mutters after putting the two
sticks on the fire, to 'May the sun guard thee from the south against
any imprecation!' (I, 3, 4, 8.) According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 8, 8-9, on
the other hand, he is to lay down only two enclosing-sticks (viz. the
middle or western, and the northern one, cf. Sâya*n*a on Taitt. S. II,
p. 72).

<span id="fn_959"></span>[426:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_963) Here he remains
standing, while the Sacrificer and Brahman sit down facing the east.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[426:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_964) Instead of the
ordinary eleven verses, the first and last of which are recited thrice;
see I, 3, 5, 6. According to Taitt. Br. I, 6, 9, I, the Adhvaryu summons
the Hot*ri* with 'Recite to the fire, as it is being kindled for the
gods (and) fathers!' The bunch of firewood, with the exception of one
stick, which is reserved for the after-offerings, is divided into three
parts, one of which is thrown on the fire at the same time when the
syllable 'om' is pronounced by the Hot*ri* at the end of the
kindling-verse.

<span id="fn_961"></span>[427:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_965) The Kâ*n*va MS.
reads, 'Bring Agni hither, O Agni!' Before this, Â*s*val. II, 19, 7
inserts, 'Bring hither the gods (and) fathers for the sacrificer!' See
I, 4, 2, 16.

<span id="fn_962"></span>[427:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_966) According to the
Kâ*n*va text he adds here the same formula as at ordinary ish*t*is (I,
4, 2, 17), 'Bring (them) hither, O *G*âtavedas, and offer up a good
offering!' For the formulas 'Bring hither Agni for the Hot*ri*ship!
bring hither thine own greatness!' Â*s*val. II, 19, 8 apparently
substitutes 'Bring hither Agni Kavyavâhana!' cf. further on, par. 30.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[427:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_967) 'The Adhvaryu,
having offered the two libations of butter, and called for the
*S*rausha*t*,' Kâ*n*va recension.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[427:4](sbe1260.htm#fr_968) On the pravara, or
election of the (divine and human) Hot*ri*; see I, 4, 2, 1 seq., 5, I, 1
seq. The call 'Hot*ri*, seat thyself!' here takes the place of the
formulas given I, 5, 1, 5 seq.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[427:5](sbe1260.htm#fr_969) See I, 5, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[428:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_970) At the sacrifice to
the Manes, the Âgnîdhra, when uttering his response, stands south of the
Adhvaryu. See [p. 132](sbe1222.htm#page_132), note. The first syllable
of 'svadhâ' is protracted. According to the comm. on Kâty. V, 9, 12, the
offering formulas also begin with 'Yẽ svadhâmahe,' instead of 'Yẽ
ya*g*âmahe' (see I, 5, 2, 16 and note).

<span id="fn_967"></span>[428:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_971) I do not quite see
the pertinency of the reason here alleged, unless it be that the author
means to say that once (by the first <span id="page_429">p. 429</span>
act) the fathers have departed, and by a second act they return hither.
According to Â*s*val. II, 19, 22, the two invitatory prayers to the
Pitara*h* Somavanta*h* are Rig-v. X, 15, 1; IX, 96, 11; to Soma
Pit*ri*mat, Rig-v. I, 91, 1; 20; to the Pitaro Barhishada*h*, Rig-v. X,
15, 4; 3; to the Pitaro ’gnishvâttâ*h*, Rig-v. X, 15, 11; 13; \[to Yama
X, 14, 4; 5.\]--The offering-prayers being respectively, Rig-v. X, 15,
5; VIII, 48, 13; X, 15, 2; X, 15, 14; \[X, 14, 1.\]

Somewhat different the Black Ya*g*us; viz. Soma Pit*ri*mat, anuvâkyâs
Rig-v. I, 91, I; IX, 96, II; yâ*g*yâ VIII, 48, 13; Pitaro Barhishada*h*,
anuvâkyâs X, 15, 4; 3; yâ*g*yâ X, 15, 5; Pitaro ’gnishvâttâ*h*,
anuvâkyâs X, 15, II; 14 (ye ’gnishvâttâ*h*, &c.!); yâ*g*yâ 'vânyâyai
dugdhe,' &c. \[Then either upahoma with the formulas X, 15, 1; 2; IV, 2,
16; or\] an oblation to Agni Kavyavâhana (anuvâkyâs, 1. 'yad agne
kavyavâhana,' 2. X, 15, 12; yâ*g*yâ X, 14, 3) \[and another to Yama
Aṅgirasvat Pit*ri*mat (anuv. X, 14, 4; 5; yâ*g*yâ X, 14, 6).\] Taitt. S.
I, 8, 5; II, 6, 12; Taitt. Br. I, 6, 9.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[429:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_972) From the centre of
each sacrificial dish he makes one 'cutting' with the *sri*tâvadâna,
shaped like a cow's ear. Kâty. V, 9, 2, and Schol.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[429:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_973) Or rather the
'Svadhâ nama*h*,' cf. par. 24. The Adhvaryu makes the oblation with his
left hand, while looking towards the south. Paddh. on Katy. V, 9.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[431:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_974) According to the
comm. on Kâty. V, 9, 13, 'mantha*h*' is, in that case, substituted for
i*d*â' in the invocation, see I, 8, 1, 19 seq. The Kâ*n*va MS. has as
follows: Thereupon, by way of i*d*â, they place that same porridge into
the hand of the Hot*ri*. The Hot*ri*, having invoked it, smells it. They
hand it to the Âgnîdhra. The Âgnîdhra smells it. They hand it to the
Brahman. The Brahman smells it. As to this Âsuri said, 'As from any
other oblation they cut off the "i*d*â" and the fore-portion, so let
them cut off and smell, <span id="page_432">p. 432</span> but not eat:
some indeed must be eaten of that of which offering is made in the
fire.'

<span id="fn_971"></span>[432:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_975) See II, 4, 2, 16
seq. According to the comm. on Kâty. V, q, 27, some sprinkle three times
round the altar for each of the three ancestors. But according to the
Paddhati, he sprinkles once round the altar, beginning from the
north-west corner; then he sits down and pours out water in that corner
for the father. Thereupon, after walking round in the opposite direction
(from left to right) to the south-west corner, he again sprinkles all
round, and in the same way pours out water in that corner for the
grandfather; and after retracing his steps as far as the south-east
corner, he performs the same circumambulation, and pours out water in
that corner for the great-grandfather; whereupon he again retraces his
steps up to the west of the altar.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[432:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_976) In the case of a
sacrificer whose father is still alive, these ceremonies are performed
in honour of the father's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[433:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_977) He mixes the three
pieces (about as much as a thumb's joint each) cut from the sacrificial
dishes, and forms them into three pi*nd*as or round cakes.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[434:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_978) '--the friends have
shaken off (their intoxication),' Ludwig; '--they showered down upon us
delightful gifts,' Grassmann; 'they shook their dear (bodies),'
Sâya*n*a; '--have trembled through their precious (bodies),' Wilson.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[434:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_979) The Rig-veda has
'somena' instead of 'stomena.'

<span id="fn_976"></span>[435:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_980) The Kâ*n*va text
has, 'The reason why he moves thrice round, sprinkling from left to
right, is that, after going after those three ancestors of his, he
thereby leaves them, and returns to this, his own, world.' See II, 6, I,
15.

<span id="fn_977"></span>[435:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_981) On the nîvi, or
unwoven end of the waist-cloth (Hindi dhotî, Mahr. dhotar), which had to
be passed under and tucked up behind, at the beginning of the present
ceremony, see [p. 368](sbe1253.htm#page_368), note
[2](sbe1253.htm#fn_819). Cf. Âpast. Dharmas. I, 2, 6, 19.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[435:3](sbe1260.htm#fr_982) For the six
formulas used for this purpose, see [p. 368](sbe1253.htm#page_368), note
[2](sbe1253.htm#fn_819).

<span id="fn_979"></span>[436:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_983) See I, 8, 3, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[437:1](sbe1260.htm#fr_984) See I, 8, 3, 19
seq.

<span id="fn_981"></span>[437:2](sbe1260.htm#fr_985) Viz. after the
strewing of the Veda,--see I, 9, 2, 24, the formulas being pronounced by
the Hot*ri* on this occasion,--at the time when the Samish*t*aya*g*us,
which is here omitted, would have to be performed in an ordinary
ish*t*i.
