<p><A NAME="page_200"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 200</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the cattle was left behind here: hence they call him V&acirc;stavya, for he was then left behind on the (sacrificial) site&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (v&acirc;stu).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:2">1:7:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. The gods went on worshipping and toiling with the same (sacrifice) by which they had ascended to heaven. Now the god who rules over the cattle, and who was left behind here,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:3">1:7:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. He saw (what occurred, and said), 'I have been left behind: they are excluding me from the sacrifice!' He went up after them, and with his raised (weapon)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_457"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> rose up on the north--the time (when this happened) was that of the (performance of the) Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:4">1:7:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. The gods said, 'Do not hurl!' He said, 'Do not ye exclude me from the sacrifice! Set apart an oblation for me!' They replied, 'So be it!' He withdrew (his weapon), and did not hurl it; nor did he injure any one.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:5">1:7:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. The gods said (to one another), 'Whatever portions of sacrificial food have been taken out by us, they have all been offered up. Try to discover</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_201"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 201</FONT></A></p>  
<p>some means by which we may set apart an oblation for him!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:6">1:7:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. They said to the Adhvaryu priest, 'Sprinkle the sacrificial dishes (with butter) in proper succession; and replenish them for the sake of one (additional) portion, and again render them fit for use; and then cut off one portion for each!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:7">1:7:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. The Adhvaryu accordingly sprinkled the sacrificial dishes in proper succession, and replenished them for the sake of one (additional) portion, and again rendered them fit for use, and cut off one portion for each. This then is the reason why he (Rudra) is called V&acirc;stavya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_458"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for a remainder (v&acirc;stu) is that part of the sacrifice which (is left) after the oblations have been made: hence, if sacrificial food is offered to any deity, the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t (Agni, 'the maker of good offering') is afterwards invariably offered a share of it; because the gods invariably gave him a share after themselves.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:8">1:7:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. That (offering) then is certainly made to 'Agni,' for, indeed, Agni is that god;--his are these names: <I>S</I>arva, as the eastern people call him; Bhava, as the B&acirc;h&icirc;kas (call him); Pa<I>s</I>&ucirc;n&acirc;m pati ('lord of beasts,' Pa<I>s</I>upati), Rudra, Agni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_462"></A><A HREF="#fn_459"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The name Agni, doubtless, is the most auspicious</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (<I>s</I>&acirc;nta), and the other names of his are inauspicious: hence it is offered to (him under the name of) 'Agni,' and to (him as) the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:9">1:7:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. They (the gods) said, 'What we have offered unto thee who art in yonder place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_460"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, do thou render that well-offered (svish<I>t</I>a) for us!' He made it well-offered for them; and this is the reason why (it is offered) to (Agni as) the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:10">1:7:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Having recited the invitatory formula&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_464"></A><A HREF="#fn_461"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he (the Hot<I>ri</I>) enumerates (those deities) which (have received oblations at the fore-offerings, butter-portions, &amp;c.), as well as Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t:--'May Agni offer Agni's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Agni's butter-portion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_465"></A><A HREF="#fn_462"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 'May he offer Soma's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Soma's butter-portion.--'May he offer Agni's favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to that indispensable cake for Agni which is (offered) on both occasions (at the new- and full-moon sacrifices).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:11">1:7:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. And so with the several deities. 'May he offer the favourite dainties of butter-drinking gods!' thereby he refers to the fore-offerings (pray&acirc;<I>g</I>a) and after-offerings (anuy&acirc;<I>g</I>a), for, assuredly, the butter-drinking gods (represent) the fore-offerings and after-offerings.--'May he offer Agni the Hot<I>ri</I>'s</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p>favourite dainties!' thereby he refers to Agni as Hot<I>ri</I>; for after the gods had set apart this oblation for him, they still further propitiated him by this (formula), and invited him to his favourite dainty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_466"></A><A HREF="#fn_463"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: this is the reason why he thus enumerates.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:12">1:7:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. Here now some make (the name of) the deity precede the 'may he offer (ay&acirc;<I>t</I>)!' thus--'Of Agni may he offer (the favourite dainties)!' 'Of Soma may he offer!' But let him not do this; for those who make the deity precede the 'may he offer!' violate the proper order at the sacrifice, since it is by pronouncing the 'may he offer,' that he pronounces what comes first here: let him therefore place the 'may he offer' first.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:13">1:7:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. [The Hot<I>ri</I> continues to recite]: 'May he sacrifice to his own greatness!' When, on that occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_467"></A><A HREF="#fn_464"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he asks him (Agni) to bring hither the deities, he also makes him bring hither his own greatness; but before this no worship of any kind has been offered to 'his (Agni's) own greatness:' and he therefore now gratifies him, and thus that (fire) has been established so as to prevent failure on his (the sacrificer's) part. This is the reason why he says 'may he sacrifice to his own greatness.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:14">1:7:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. 'By sacrifice may he obtain for himself food worthy of sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_468"></A><A HREF="#fn_465"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!' the food, doubtless, is these creatures: he thereby makes them eager to sacrifice, and these creatures go on sacrificing, worshipping and performing austerities.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_204"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 204</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:15">1:7:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. 'May he, the knower of beings, (perform)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_469"></A><A HREF="#fn_466"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the sacred cult; may he graciously accept the sacrificial food!' Thereby he prays for success to this sacrifice; for when the gods graciously accept the sacrificial food, then he (the sacrificer) gains great things&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_470"></A><A HREF="#fn_467"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: for this reason he says 'may he graciously accept the sacrificial food!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:16">1:7:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. The reason why on this occasion the invitatory and offering-formulas are made closely to correspond to each other (avak<I>li</I>ptatama), is that the svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t (is equivalent to) the evening libation, and the evening libation, doubtless, belongs to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I> (the 'All-gods )&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_471"></A><A HREF="#fn_468"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 'Gladden thou the longing gods, O youngest!' this much in the invitatory formula refers to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_469"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. 'O Agni, Hot<I>ri</I> of the cult! when this day (thou comest) to the men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_473"></A><A HREF="#fn_470"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>;' this much in the offering-formula refers to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>. And because such is the form of these two (formulas), therefore they are of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_205"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 205</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the form of the evening libation; and this is why the invitatory and offering-formulas on this occasion are made closely to correspond to each other.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:17">1:7:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. They are both trish<I>t</I>ubh verses; for the svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t is, as it were, the residue (or site, v&acirc;stu) of the sacrifice, and the residue (or, a vacant site) is without energy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_474"></A><A HREF="#fn_471"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now the trish<I>t</I>ubh means manly power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_475"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, energy: hence he thereby imparts manly power, energy to that residue, the svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t. This is why they are both trish<I>t</I>ubh verses.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:18">1:7:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. Or they are both anush<I>t</I>ubh verses. The anush<I>t</I>ubh is residue (or site, v&acirc;stu), and the svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t also is residue: hence he thereby puts a residue to a residue&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_476"></A><A HREF="#fn_473"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. And, verily, one who knows this, and whose (invitatory and offering-formulas) are two anush<I>t</I>ubh verses, his homestead (v&acirc;stu) is prosperous, and he himself prospers in regard to progeny and cattle.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:19">1:7:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. Now here Bh&acirc;llabeya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_477"></A><A HREF="#fn_474"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> made the invitatory formula (consist of) an anush<I>t</I>ubh verse, and the offering-formula of a trish<I>t</I>ubh verse, thinking, 'I thus obtain (the benefits of) both.' He fell from the cart, and in falling, broke his arm. He reflected: 'This has befallen because of something or other I have done.' He then bethought himself of this: '(It has befallen) because of some violation, on my part, of the proper course of the sacrifice.' Hence one must not violate the proper course (of sacrificial performance); but let both (formulas) be verses of the same metre, either both anush<I>t</I>ubh verses, or both trish<I>t</I>ubh verses.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:20">1:7:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. He cuts (the portions for Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t) from the north part (of the sacrificial dishes)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_478"></A><A HREF="#fn_475"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and offers them up on the north part (of the fire): for this is the region of that god, and therefore he cuts from the north part and offers on the north part. From that side, indeed, he arose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_479"></A><A HREF="#fn_476"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and there they (the gods) appeased him: for this reason he cuts from the north part, and offers on the north part.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:21">1:7:3:21</A></FONT></span>21. He offers on this side (in front), as it were, of the other oblations. Following the other oblations cattle are produced, and the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t represents Rudra's power: he would impose Rudra's power on</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the cattle if he were to bring it (the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t) into contact with the other oblations; and his (the sacrificer's) household and cattle would be destroyed. For this reason he offers on this side, as it were, of the other oblations.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:22">1:7:3:22</A></FONT></span>22. That (fire)---to wit, the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya--is, indeed, that sacrifice by which the gods then ascended to heaven; and that (other fire) which was left behind here, is the G&acirc;rhapatya: hence they take out the former from the G&acirc;rhapatya, (so as to be) before (east) of it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:23">1:7:3:23</A></FONT></span>23. He may lay it (the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya) down at the distance of eight steps (from the G&acirc;rhapatya); for of eight syllables, doubtless, consists the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; hence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of the g&acirc;yatr&icirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:24">1:7:3:24</A></FONT></span>24. Or he may lay it down at the distance of eleven steps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_480"></A><A HREF="#fn_477"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for of eleven syllables, indeed, consists the trish<I>t</I>ubh: hence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of the trish<I>t</I>ubh.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:25">1:7:3:25</A></FONT></span>25. Or he may lay it down at the distance of twelve steps; for of twelve syllables, indeed, consists the <I>g</I>aga: hence he thereby ascends to heaven by means of the <I>g</I>agat&icirc;. Here, however, there is no (fixed) measure: let him, therefore, lay it down where in his own mind he may think proper&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_481"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. If he takes it ever so little east (of the G&acirc;rhapatya), he ascends to heaven by it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:26">1:7:3:26</A></FONT></span>26. Here now they say, 'Let them cook the sacrificial</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A></p>  
<p>dishes on the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya; for thence, assuredly, the gods ascended to heaven, and therewith they went on worshipping and toiling: therein we will cook the sacrificial dishes; therein we will perform the sacrifice! For, as it were, a displacement&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_482"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of the sacrificial dishes would take place, if they were to cook them on the G&acirc;rhapatya. The &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya is the sacrifice: we will perform the sacrifice in the sacrifice!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:27">1:7:3:27</A></FONT></span>27. However, they also do cook on the G&acirc;rhapatya, arguing, 'The former is indeed &acirc;havan&icirc;ya (i.e. "suitable for a burnt-offering"); but that one, surely, is not (intended) for this,--viz. that they should cook uncooked (food) on it; but it is (intended) for this,--viz. that they should offer up cooked (food) on it.' He may therefore do it on whichever (fire) he pleases.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:7:3:28">1:7:3:28</A></FONT></span>28. That sacrifice spake, 'I dread nakedness.' 'What is unnakedness for thee?' 'Let them strew (sacrificial grass) all round me!' For this reason they strew (sacrificial grass) all round the fire. 'I dread thirst.' 'How art thou to be satiated?' 'May I satiate myself after the priest has been satisfied!' Let him therefore, on the completion of the sacrifice, order that the priest be satisfied; for then he satisfies the sacrifice.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_457"></A><A HREF="sbe1232.htm#fr_460">200:2</A> The text has ayatay&acirc; merely, which, to become intelligible, clearly requires some noun, which may have been lost here. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a is silent on this point. In Dr. Muir's version of the legend, Original Sanskrit Texts, IV, p. 202, the word is left untranslated. I am inclined to supply some such noun as heti, 'weapon;' cf. XII, 7, 3, 20, where this very word is used in connection with Rudra: in later times it is also specially applied to Agni's weapon or flame (<I>g</I>ihv&acirc;, 'tongue'). It is not impossible, however, that we have to supply tanv&acirc; ('with his raised body, or self'). To m&acirc; vi sr&acirc;ksh&icirc;<I>h</I> (for which the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va recension reads m&acirc; &#8217;sth&acirc;<I>h</I>), 'do not hurl,' and to sa<I>m</I>vivarha ('he drew back'), S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a supplies ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>am, 'sacrifice:' hence he apparently takes it thus,--'do not scatter (the sacrifice),'--'he kept (the sacrifice) together and did not injure it in any way.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_459"></A><A HREF="sbe1232.htm#fr_462">201:2</A> Passages such as this and VI, 1, 3, 7 seq. are of considerable interest, as showing, on the one hand, the tendency towards identifying and blending originally distinct and apparently local Vedic gods, especially Rudra, with the person of Agni, the representative of the divine power on earth in the later Vedic triad; and, on the other hand, the origin of the conception of Siva, in the pantheistic system of the post-Vedic period.

Here the author, as usual (cf. p. 5 note), attempts to enhance the solemnity of the ceremony by identifying it with the t<I>ri</I>t&icirc;ya-savana, or evening libation at the Soma-sacrifice, both offerings constituting the final ceremonies in the main performance of the respective sacrifices. We shall, however, see (cf. I, 8, 3, 25) that as at the evening libation the remains of the Soma are offered up, so also are the remains of havis offered to the vi<I>s</I>ve dev&acirc;<I>h</I> at the conclusion of the present sacrifice. At IV, 4, 5, 17 it is more especially the offering of rice-cake to Agni and Varu<I>n</I>a, at the evening libation, which is identified with the svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.</P>

Rig-veda X, 130, 5) appears specially related to Indra; and the hymns addressed to him are almost entirely in this metre. Taitt. S. VII, 1, 1, 4 it is said to have been created by Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati from his own chest and arms, immediately after Indra, and together with the B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man, the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya, and the ram; and that these are therefore v&icirc;ry&acirc;vant, having been created out of v&icirc;rya (i.e. the seats of 'manly power').</P>

I do not find it stated anywhere, what anush<I>t</I>ubh verses may optionally be taken for the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; and y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; of the svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.</P>
