<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:1">2:3:3:1</A></FONT></span>1. Now when Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, in creating living beings, created Agni, the latter, as soon as born, sought to burn everything here: and so everybody tried to get out of his way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_774"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The creatures then existing sought to crush him. Being unable to endure this, he went to man.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:2">2:3:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. He said, 'I cannot endure this: come, let me enter into thee! Having reproduced me, maintain me; and as thou wilt reproduce and maintain me in this world, even so will I reproduce and maintain thee in yonder world!' He (man) replied, 'So be it.' And having reproduced him, he maintained him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:3">2:3:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. Now when he establishes the two fires, he reproduces that (Agni); and having reproduced him, he maintains him; and as he reproduces and maintains him in this world, even so does he (Agni) reproduce and maintain him in yonder world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:4">2:3:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. One must not, therefore, remove it (the sacrificial fire from the hearth) prematurely, for too</p>

<p><A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A></p>  
<p>soon it languishes for him; and as it languishes for him too soon in this world, even so does it languish for him too soon in yonder world: one must not, therefore, remove it prematurely.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:5">2:3:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. And when he dies, and they place him on the (funeral) fire, then he is reproduced from out of the fire; and he (Agni) who heretofore was his son&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_775"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, now becomes his father.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:6">2:3:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. Hence it has been said by the <I>Ri</I>shis (Rig-veda I, 89, 9), 'A hundred autumns (may there he) before us, O gods, during which ye complete the life-time of our bodies, during which sons become fathers! do not cut us off, midway, from reaching the full term of life!' for he (Agni) who is the son, now in his turn becomes the father: this, then, is why one must establish the fires.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:7">2:3:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. Now yonder burning (sun) doubtless is no other than Death; and because he is Death, therefore the creatures that are on this side of him die. But those that are on the other side of him are the gods, and they are therefore immortal. It is by the rays (or reins, thongs, ra<I>s</I>mi) of that (sun) that all these creatures are attached to the vital airs (breaths or life), and therefore the rays extend down to the vital airs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:8">2:3:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. And the breath of whomsoever he (the sun) wishes he takes and rises, and that one dies. And whosoever goes to yonder world not having escaped that Death, him he causes to die again and again in yonder world, even as, in this world, one regards not him that is fettered, but puts him to death whenever one wishes.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:9">2:3:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. Now when, in the evening after sunset, he offers two libations, then he firmly plants himself on that Death with those fore-feet of his; and when, in the morning before sunrise, he offers two libations, then he plants himself on that Death with those hind-feet of his. And when he (the sun) rises, then, in rising, he takes him up and thus he (the sacrificer) escapes that Death. This, then, is the release from death in the Agnihotra: and, verily, he who knows that release from death in the Agnihotra, is freed from death again and again.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:10">2:3:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. What the arrow-head is to the arrow, that the Agnihotra is to sacrifices. For whither the head of the arrow flies, thither the whole arrow flies: and so are all his works of sacrifice freed by this (Agnihotra) from that Death.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:11">2:3:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now day and night, revolving, destroy (the fruit of) man's righteousness in yonder world. But day and night are on this side (of the sun) from him (after he has gone up to heaven); and so day and night do not destroy (the fruit of) his righteousness.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:12">2:3:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. And as, while standing inside a chariot, one would look down from above on the revolving chariot-wheels, even so does he look down from on high upon day and night: and, verily, day and night destroy not the reward of him who thus knows that release from day and night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:13">2:3:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. [The sacrificer] having gone round the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, (after entering) from the east&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_776"></A><A HREF="#fn_772"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, passes</p>

<p>between (it and) the G&acirc;rhapatya (to his seat). For the gods do not know (this) man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_777"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; but when he now passes by them between (the fires), they know him, and think, 'This is he that now offers to us.' Moreover, Agni (the fire) is the repeller of evil; and these two, the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya and G&acirc;rhapatya, repel the evil from him who passes between them; and the evil being repelled from him, he becomes a very light in splendour and glory.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:14">2:3:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. On the north side is the door of the Agnihotra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_778"></A><A HREF="#fn_774"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: thus (he approaches it) as he would enter (a house) by a door. If, on the other hand, he were to sit down after approaching from the south, it would be as if he walked outside.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:15">2:3:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. The Agnihotra, truly, is the ship (that sails) heavenwards. The &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya and G&acirc;rhapatya are the two sides&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_779"></A><A HREF="#fn_775"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of that same heavenward-bound ship; and that milk-offerer is its steersman.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:16">2:3:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now when he walks up towards the east, then he steers that (ship) eastwards towards the</p>

<p>heavenly world, and he gains the heavenly world by it. When ascended from the north it makes him reach the heavenly world; but if one were to sit down in it after entering from the south, it would be as if he tried to enter it after it has put off and he were left behind and remained outside.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:17">2:3:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. And again, the stick which he puts on the fire (corresponds to) a brick, and the formula wherewith he offers is the Ya<I>g</I>us-text wherewith he puts on that brick&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_780"></A><A HREF="#fn_776"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and when the brick is put on, then a libation is made: hence those same libations of the Agnihotra are offered on his pile of bricks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_781"></A><A HREF="#fn_777"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:18">2:3:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. The fire, assuredly, is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati,--and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year. Year after year, therefore, is his Agnihotra consummated with the piled-up fire-altar; and year after year does he obtain the piled-up fire altar, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:3:3:19">2:3:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. Seven hundred and twenty eighties of <I>Ri</I>k-verses (he should recite at the Agnihotra in the course of a year). When he offers the Agnihotra in the morning and evening, then there are two libations: hence those libations of his, in the course of a year, amount to--</p>
