### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE FORE-OFFERINGS (PRAYÂ*G*AS).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:1">1:5:2:1</span></span>1. \[The
Hot*ri* continues\], 'May Agni, the priest (hot*ri*), know (undertake)
Agni's priestly duty (hautram),'--thereby he says 'may Agni, as Hot*ri*,
know this!' 'Agni's priestly duty' he says, because it is his duty that
he must know;--'that means of salvation <span
id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_341),'--the means of salvation, assuredly, is
the sacrifice: 'may he know the sacrifice' is what he thereby
says.--'Favourable to thee, O Sacrificer, is

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

the deity!' by this he says 'favourable is the deity to thee, O
Sacrificer, whose Hot*ri* is Agni <span
id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_342)!'--'Take up <span
id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_343) the spoon, O Adhvaryu, full of butter!'
thereby he urges on the Adhvaryu. The reason why he mentions one (spoon)
only (is this).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:2">1:5:2:2</span></span>2. The
Sacrificer, doubtless, stands behind the *g*uhû, and he, who means evil
to him, stands behind the upabh*ri*t; and if he were to speak of two
(spoons), he would cause the spiteful enemy to countervail the
Sacrificer. Behind the *g*uhû stands the eater, and behind the
upabh*ri*t the one to be eaten; and if he were to speak of two (spoons),
he would make the one to be eaten countervail the eater. For these
reasons he speaks of one (spoon) only.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:3">1:5:2:3</span></span>3. \[He
continues\],'--(the spoon which is) devoted to the gods, possessed of
all boons,' he praises, he magnifies it when he says 'devoted to the
gods, possessed of all boons.'--'Let us praise the gods, the
praiseworthy! let us adore the adorable! let us worship the worshipful!'
that is, 'let us praise those gods who are praiseworthy! let us adore
those who are adorable! let us worship those who are worthy of worship!'
the praiseworthy, to wit, are the men, the adorable the fathers, and the
worshipful the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:4">1:5:2:4</span></span>4. For,
indeed, the creatures that are not allowed to take part in the sacrifice
are forlorn; and therefore

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

he makes those creatures here on earth that are not forlorn, take part
in the sacrifice: behind the men are the beasts, and behind the gods are
the birds, the plants, and the trees; and thus all that here exists is
made to take part in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:5">1:5:2:5</span></span>5. These
same (preceding formulas) are nine utterances; for nine, in number, are
those breaths (or vital airs) in man <span
id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_344), and these he thereby puts into him (the
sacrificer): for this reason there are nine utterances.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:6">1:5:2:6</span></span>6. The
sacrifice fled away from the gods. The gods called out after it, 'Listen
(a-*s*ru) to us <span id="fr_347"></span>[2](#fn_345)! come back to us!'
It replied, 'So be it!' and returned to the gods; and with what had thus
returned to them, the gods worshipped; and by worshipping with it they
became the gods they now are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:7">1:5:2:7</span></span>7. Now
when he (the Adhvaryu) calls (on the Âgnîdhra), he thereby calls after
the sacrifice, 'Listen to us! come back to us!' and when he (the
Âgnîdhra) responds, then the sacrifice comes back, saying 'so be it!'
and with it, thus passing over to them, as with seed <span
id="fr_348"></span>[3](#fn_346), the priests carry on the tradition,
imperceptibly to the sacrificer; for even as people hand on from one to
the other a full vessel <span id="fr_349"></span>[4](#fn_347), in

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

the same way they (the priests) hand down that (sacrifice) from one to
the other. They hand it down by means of speech, for the sacrifice is
speech (prayer), and speech is seed: therefore they keep up the
tradition by means of it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:8">1:5:2:8</span></span>8. After
he has said (to the Hot*ri*), 'Recite!' the Adhvaryu must utter nothing
improper (worldly); neither must the Hot*ri* utter anything improper.
The Adhvaryu <span id="fr_350"></span>[1](#fn_348) utters his call:
thereby the sacrifice passes on to the Âgnîdhra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:9">1:5:2:9</span></span>9. The
Âgnîdhra must utter nothing improper until his response. The Âgnîdhra
responds: thereby the sacrifice passes back to the Adhvaryu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:10">1:5:2:10</span></span>10. The
Adhvaryu must utter nothing improper until he pronounces (the word)
'ya*g*a (recite the offering-prayer):' in saying 'ya*g*a' the Adhvaryu
hands the sacrifice on to the Hot*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:11">1:5:2:11</span></span>11. The
Hot*ri* must utter nothing improper until his vasha*t*-call. By the
vasha*t*-call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as seed into
the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, from thence
it is brought forth. So now at the havis-sacrifice. And at the
Soma-cult,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:12">1:5:2:12</span></span>12.
When he has drawn (the Soma), the Adhvaryu must not utter anything
improper until his summons

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (for the chanting
of the stotra <span id="fr_351"></span>[1](#fn_349)): with the call
'draw near!' the Adhvaryu hands the sacrifice on to the Udgât*ri*s
(chanters).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:13">1:5:2:13</span></span>13. The
Udgât*ri*s must not utter anything improper until the last
(stotra-verse): 'this is the last one,' thus thinking, the Udgât*ri*s
hand on the sacrifice to the Hot*ri*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:14">1:5:2:14</span></span>14. The
Hot*ri* must utter nothing improper until the vasha*t*-call. With the
vasha*t*-call he pours it (the sacrifice) into the fire, as seed into
the womb; for the fire is indeed the womb of the sacrifice, since from
thence it is brought forth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:15">1:5:2:15</span></span>15. If
he whom the sacrifice approaches were to utter anything improper, he
would waste the sacrifice, even as he might waste (water by spilling
from) a full vessel. And where the officiating priests thus practice
sacrifice with a perfect mutual understanding between them, there
everything works regularly and no hitch occurs: therefore it is in this
way that the sacrifice must be nursed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:16">1:5:2:16</span></span>16. Now
there are here five utterances, viz. (1) 'Bid (him, Agni, or them)
hear!' (2) 'Yea, may he (or, one) hear!' (3) 'Pronounce the prayer to
the kindling-sticks!' (4) 'We who pronounce the prayer . . .' (5) 'May
he bear (the sacrifice to the gods) <span
id="fr_352"></span>[2](#fn_350)!' fivefold is the sacrifice, fivefold
the animal victim, five are the seasons of the year: this is the one
measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:17">1:5:2:17</span></span>17.
These (five formulas) consist of seventeen syllables;--seventeenfold,
indeed, is Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: this is the
one measure of the sacrifice, this its consummation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:18">1:5:2:18</span></span>18.
With 'O *s*râvaya <span id="fr_353"></span>[1](#fn_351)!' the gods sent
forth the east wind; with 'Astu *s*rausha*t* <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_351)!' they caused the clouds to flow
together; with 'Ya*g*a (pronounce the yâ*g*yâ)!' (they sent forth) the
lightning; with' Ye ya*g*âmahe (we who pray),' the thunder; with the
vasha*t*-call they caused it to rain <span
id="fr_355"></span>[2](#fn_352).

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:19">1:5:2:19</span></span>19.
Should he (the sacrificer) be desirous of rain, or should he perform a
special offering <span id="fr_356"></span>[3](#fn_353), or even at the
new- and full-moon sacrifice itself, he may say, 'Verily, I am desirous
of rain!'--and he may also say to the Adhvaryu, 'Ponder thou in thy mind
the east wind and the lightning!'--to the Âgnîdhra, 'Ponder thou the
clouds in thy mind!'--to the Hot*ri*, 'Ponder thou in thy mind the
thunder and rain!'--to the Brahman, 'Ponder thou all, these in thy
mind!'--for where the officiating priests thus practice sacrifice with a
perfect mutual understanding between them, there it will indeed rain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:5:2:20">1:5:2:20</span></span>20.
With 'O *s*râvaya!' the gods called the shining one (virâ*g*, viz. cow),
with 'Astu *s*rausha*t*!' they untied the calf and let it go to her;
with 'Ya*g*a!' they raised (its head to the udder of the cow) <span
id="fr_357"></span>[4](#fn_354); with

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'Ye ya*g*âmahe!'
they sat down by her (for milking); with the vasha*t*-call they milked
her. The shining one, doubtless, is this (earth), and of her this is the
milking: and for him who knows this to be the milking of the shining
one, this shining (earth-cow) thus milks out all his desires.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_341"></span>[138:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_343) Prâvitram,
literally 'that which promotes, protects' ('unser Hort'). Sâya*n*a on
Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5 explains it by' prak*ri*sh*t*am avitram
phaladânarûpam asmadraksha*n*am yasmin homânush*th*âne tad idam
prâvitram.' For this and the succeeding formulas, see Â*s*v. I, 4,
10-11.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[139:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_344) Â*s*v. I, 4, 10,
and Sâṅkh. I, 6 give as belonging to the text of the mantra: yo agni*m*
hotâram av*ri*thâ*h*, 'thou who hast chosen Agni for thy Hot*ri*;' the
same reading is mentioned in Taitt. S. II, 5, 9, 5.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[139:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_345) Thus Sâya*n*a
(âsyasva = haste dhâraya); 'schöpfe ein (ladle in),' St. Petersburg
Dictionary; 'pour into the fire,' Hillebrandt, p. 93.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[140:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_346) See p. 20, note 1.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[140:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_347) The legend is
intended to explain the origin and symbolical meaning of the call
(â*s*râva*n*a) of the Adhvaryu (viz. O *s*râvaya! make listen!') and the
response (pratyâ*s*rava*n*a) of the Âgnîdhra (viz. astu *s*rausha*t*!).

<span id="fn_346"></span>[140:3](sbe1223.htm#fr_348) The sacrifice is
the seed (vî*g*a) that produces heaven as its fruit. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[140:4](sbe1223.htm#fr_349) I.e. 'even as they
pass on from hand to hand a pail (gha*t*a) filled with water when a tub
is to be filled inside the house.' Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_348"></span>[141:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_350) As soon as the
Hot*ri* has pronounced the formula 'O Adhvaryu, take up the spoon full
of butter!' (par. 2 above), the Adhvaryu takes the two offering-spoons
(*g*uhû and upabh*ri*t) and steps back (from the west side along the
north side of the altar and the west side of the fire) to the south side
of the altar and the fire (the ya*g*ati-sthâna), and (with his face to
north-east) utters his call, and (having been responded to by the
Âgnîdhra) calls on the Hot*ri*: 'samidho ya*g*a (pronounce the
offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks)!' Kâty. III, 2, 16.

<span id="fn_349"></span>[142:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_351) See IV, 2, 5, 7-8.

<span id="fn_350"></span>[142:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_352) (1) O *s*râvaya
(for â srâvaya), the Adhvaryu's call; (2) astu *s*rausha*t*, the
Âgnîdhra's response; (3) (samidho) ya*g*a, the Adhvaryu's summons to the
Hot*ri*; (4) ye ya*g*âmahe, the beginning of the Hot*ri*'s yâ*g*yâ, or
offering-prayer (see [p. 135](sbe1222.htm#page_135) note); (5)
vausha*t*, concluding formula of the yâ*g*yâ.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[143:1](sbe1223.htm#fr_354) For â*s*râvaya (cf.
[p. 131](sbe1221.htm#page_131), note [2](sbe1222.htm#fn_329)), i.e. 'bid
(him, Agni, or them) hear!' but the author here makes *s*râvaya the
causative of *s*ru (sru), 'to flow;' hence â *s*râvaya, 'make flow;' and
astu *s*rausha*t* \[properly 'Yea, may he (or one) hear!'\] he makes
'Yea, may it flow!'

<span id="fn_352"></span>[143:2](sbe1223.htm#fr_355) A fanciful
etymology of vasha*t* from root v*ri*sh, 'to rain;' for the true
derivation of the word, see [p. 88](sbe1214.htm#page_88), note
[2](sbe1214.htm#fn_254).

<span id="fn_353"></span>[143:3](sbe1223.htm#fr_356) I.e. an offering
made with a view to the obtainment of some special wish (kâmyesh*t*i).

<span id="fn_354"></span>[143:4](sbe1223.htm#fr_357) Thus (or 'they led
it up to the udder of the cow') Sâya*n*a <span id="page_144">p.
144</span> explains udanayan. In his commentary on Taitt. S. I, 6, 11 he
interprets the analogous udanaishît by 'he raises (or brings) the
milk-pail;' where the St. Petersburg Dictionary apparently takes it in
the sense of 'he led the calf away from the cow.'
