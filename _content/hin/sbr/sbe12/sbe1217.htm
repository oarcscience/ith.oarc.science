<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1">1:4:1</A></FONT></span></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">FOURTH ADHY&Acirc;YA. FIRST BR&Acirc;HMA<I>N</I>A.</h3>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:1">1:4:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. He recites after uttering (the syllable) 'Hi&#7749;!' Sacrifice, they say, is not (performed) without the S&acirc;man; and neither is the S&acirc;man chanted without 'Hi&#7749;' having been uttered. By his uttering 'Hi&#7749;!' the peculiar nature (r&ucirc;pam) of the word 'Hi&#7749;' is produced (in the sacrifice); and by the sacred syllable (om) it assumes the nature of the S&acirc;man. By uttering 'Om! Om&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' this his entire sacrifice becomes endowed with the S&acirc;man.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_101"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 101</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:2">1:4:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. And (another reason) why he utters 'Hi&#7749;!' is this. The word 'Hi&#7749;' means breath, for the word Hi&#7749;' does indeed mean breath: he cannot therefore pronounce the word 'Hi&#7749;,' when he closes his nostrils. The <I>ri</I><I>k</I> (verse) he recites with his voice. Now, voice and breath are a pair, so that a productive union of the s&acirc;midhen&icirc;s is thereby effected at the outset: for this reason he recites, after uttering 'Hi&#7749;!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:3">1:4:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. He utters the word 'Hi&#7749;' in a low voice. Were he, on the contrary, to pronounce 'Hi&#7749;' aloud, he would make 'voice' of both the one and the other: for this reason he utters the word 'Hi&#7749;' in a low voice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:4">1:4:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. He recites with '&acirc; (hither)!' and 'pra (forth or thither)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_277"></A><A HREF="#fn_276"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' He thereby joins a g&acirc;yatr&icirc; verse directed hitherward to one directed away from here: the one which tends from hence carries the sacrifice to the gods, and the one which tends hitherward pleases the men. For this reason he recites with '&acirc;' and 'pra.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:5">1:4:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. And (another reason) why he recites with '&acirc;' and 'pra,' is this. 'Pra (forth)' clearly means out-breathing, and '&acirc; (hither)' means in-breathing: hence he thereby obtains out-breathing and in-breathing (for the sacrificer). For this reason he recites with '&acirc;' and 'pra.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_102"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 102</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:6">1:4:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. Yet (other reasons) why he recites with 'hither (&acirc;)' and 'thither (pra),' are these. 'Thither' the seed is cast, and 'hither' birth takes place. 'Thither' the cattle disperse (for grazing), 'hither' they return. Indeed, everything here (moves) 'hither' and 'thither:' for this reason he recites with '&acirc;' and 'pra.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:7">1:4:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. He recites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_278"></A><A HREF="#fn_277"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!'--</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>hereby, then, the 'thither' is (realised). And (in the second verse), 'Come hither, Agni, to expand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_279"></A><A HREF="#fn_278"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!'--by this, on the other hand, the 'hither' is (realised).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:8">1:4:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. Now, in reference to this point, some people say, 'Both these (texts) surely result in a "thither&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_280"></A><A HREF="#fn_279"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>."' This, however, is beyond the ordinary understanding: the text, 'forth go your viands, heavenward!' is clearly (directed) away from (the sacrificer); and the text, 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!' is (directed) towards (him).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:9">1:4:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. He recites (the first kindling verse), 'Forth go your viands, heavenward!' this, then, tends in a forward direction. 'Viands' (v&acirc;<I>g</I>a)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_281"></A><A HREF="#fn_280"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> he says, because viands mean food: hence food is obtained (for the sacrificer) by this recitation. 'Heavenward' he says, because those that tend heavenward are the half-moons:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>it is, therefore, the half-moons which he obtains by this recitation. 'In havis rich' he further says, because those that are rich in havis (milk, butter) are the cattle; it is cattle, therefore, that he thereby obtains through the recitation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:10">1:4:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. 'With buttered (spoon)--' he adds. Now M&acirc;thava, the (king of) Videgha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_282"></A><A HREF="#fn_281"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, carried Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara in his mouth. The <I>Ri</I>shi Gotama R&acirc;h&ucirc;ga<I>n</I>a was his family priest. When addressed (by the latter), he made no answer to him, fearing lest Agni might fall from his mouth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:11">1:4:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. He (the priest) began to invoke the latter with</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></p>  
<p>verses of the Rig-veda, 'We kindle thee at the sacrifice, O wise Agni, thee the radiant, the mighty caller to the sacrificial feast (Rig-veda V, 26, 3)!--O Videgha!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:12">1:4:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. He (the king) did not answer. (The priest went on), 'Upwards, O Agni, dart thy brilliant, shining rays, thy flames, thy beams (Rig-veda VIII, 44, 16)!--O Videgha-a-a!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:13">1:4:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. Still he did not answer. (The priest continued), 'Thee, O butter-sprinkled one, we invoke! (Rig-veda V, 26, 2);' so much he uttered, when at the very mentioning of butter, Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara flashed forth from the (king's) mouth: he was unable to hold him back; he issued from his mouth, and fell down on this earth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:14">1:4:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. M&acirc;thava, the Videgha, was at that time on the (river) Sarasvat&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He (Agni) thence went burning along this earth towards the east; and Gotama R&acirc;h&ucirc;ga<I>n</I>a and the Videgha M&acirc;thava followed after him as he was burning along. He burnt over (dried up) all these rivers. Now that (river), which is called 'Sad&acirc;n&icirc;r&acirc;,' flows from the northern (Him&acirc;laya) mountain: that one he did not burn over. That one the Br&acirc;hmans did not cross in former times, thinking, 'it has not been burnt over by Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:15">1:4:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. Now-a-days, however, there are many Br&acirc;hmans to the east of it. At that time it (the land east of the Sad&acirc;n&icirc;r&acirc;) was very uncultivated, very marshy, because it had not been tasted by Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:16">1:4:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now-a-days, however, it is very cultivated, for the Br&acirc;hmans have caused (Agni) to taste it through</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sacrifices. Even in late summer that (river), as it were, rages along&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_284"></A><A HREF="#fn_283"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: so cold is it, not having been burnt over by Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:17">1:4:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. M&acirc;thava, the Videgha, then said (to Agni), 'Where am I to abide?' 'To the east of this (river) be thy abode!' said he. Even now this (river) forms the boundary of the Kosalas and Videhas; for these are the M&acirc;thavas (or descendants of M&acirc;thava).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:18">1:4:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. Gotama R&acirc;h&ucirc;ga<I>n</I>a then said (to M&acirc;thava), 'Why didst thou not answer when addressed by us?' He replied, 'Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara was in my mouth; I did not reply, lest he should escape from my mouth.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:19">1:4:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. 'How then did this happen?'--'At the moment when thou didst utter the words, "(Thee), O butter-sprinkled one, we invoke!" just then, at the mention of butter, Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara flashed forth from my mouth; I was unable to hold him back, he issued from my mouth.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:20">1:4:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. That (word) in the s&acirc;midhen&icirc;s, therefore, which contains butter (gh<I>ri</I>ta) is especially suitable for kindling (sam-indh); and by it he accordingly kindles him (Agni, the fire) and bestows vigour on this (sacrificer).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:21">1:4:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. Now that (word) is gh<I>ri</I>t&acirc;<I>k</I>y&acirc;, 'with the buttered (spoon).'--'He nears&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the gods, wishful of bliss.' Wishful of bliss, truly, is the sacrificer, since he wishes to approach the gods, to go to&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the gods: therefore he says, 'he nears the gods, wishful of bliss.' This (verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined (vague); and undefined, doubtless, is the 'All;' he thus commences (this holy work) with the All.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:22">1:4:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. [He recites the second s&acirc;midhen&icirc;]: 'Come hither, Agni, to expand!'--'To expand' he says, because at the beginning these worlds were well-nigh contiguous to one another: at that time one could touch the sky thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:23">1:4:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. The gods desired, 'How could these worlds of ours become farther apart from one another? How could there be more space for us?' They breathed through them (the worlds) with these three syllables (forming the word) <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>v&icirc;taye&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' and these worlds became far apart from one another; and there was then ampler space for the gods: ample space, therefore, he will have for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse) containing (the word) 'v&icirc;taye.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:24">1:4:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. He proceeds, 'Invoked for the giver of oblations!' 'The giver of oblations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,' of course, is the</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sacrificer: hence 'invoked for the sacrificer' is what he thereby means to say.--'As Hot<I>ri</I> on the barhis sit!' Agni, indeed, is the Hot<I>ri</I>, and the barhis (the covering of sacrificial grass on the altar) is this world: hence he thereby establishes Agni (the fire) in this world, as this fire is established (or, beneficial, hita) in this world. This (verse), then, is recited with reference to this world (the earth): through it this world is conquered by him for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:25">1:4:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. [He recites the third s&acirc;midhen&icirc;]: 'With samidhs thee, O A&#7749;giras!'--with samidhs (kindling-sticks), indeed, the A&#7749;giras kindled him. 'O A&#7749;giras!' he says, for Agni is indeed A&#7749;giras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--'With butter we exhilarate!' This (viz. gh<I>ri</I>tena, 'with butter') is a word which is especially suitable for the kindling of Agni: by it he kindles him, and bestows vigour on this (sacrificer).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:26">1:4:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. 'Shine forth, O youngest, brilliantly!' he adds; for brilliantly he shines, when kindled; and 'O youngest!' he says, because he is really the youngest Agni&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: therefore he says, 'O youngest!' This (verse) is recited with reference to yonder world, to wit, the a&euml;rial world; hence this (verse), which is addressed to Agni, is undefined, for undefined is yonder world: that world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this verse.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:27">1:4:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. [He recites the fourth s&acirc;midhen&icirc;]: 'Agni, do thou obtain for us that (region) wide and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></p>  
<p>glorious!' For wide, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods (dwell), and glorious is that (region) wherein the gods (dwell). When he says, 'Do thou obtain for us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' he means to say, 'make us go to it!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:28">1:4:1:28</A></FONT></span>28. 'That great and mighty one, O God!' For great, indeed, is yonder (region) wherein the gods (dwell), and mighty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is that wherein the gods (dwell). This (verse), then, is recited with reference to yonder world: that heavenly world he thereby gains, for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:29">1:4:1:29</A></FONT></span>29. He recites (the fifth s&acirc;midhen&icirc;): 'Praiseworthy he, adorable,' for worthy of praise he is, and worthy of adoration;--'visible through the veil of gloom,' for when kindled he is seen right through the gloom;--'Agni, the mighty one (bull), is lit,' for he is indeed lit up, the mighty one.</p>  
<p>[He recites the sixth s&acirc;midhen&icirc;]: 'The mighty Agni is lit up,' for he is indeed lit up.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:30">1:4:1:30</A></FONT></span>30. 'Yea&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_294"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, as a horse that bears the gods,' for having become a horse he does indeed carry the sacrifice to the gods: the (word) 'na' which occurs in this verse has the meaning of 'om' (verily); hence he says, 'Yea, as a horse that bears to the gods.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:31">1:4:1:31</A></FONT></span>31. 'With offerings him they glorify,' for with offerings men indeed glorify him; therefore he says, 'with offerings him they glorify.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:32">1:4:1:32</A></FONT></span>32. [He recites the seventh s&acirc;midhen&icirc;): 'O mighty one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_295"></A><A HREF="#fn_294"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>! we mighty men do kindle thee, the mighty one!' for they indeed kindle him;--'O Agni, thee that brightly shines!' for he indeed shone brightly when he was kindled.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:33">1:4:1:33</A></FONT></span>33. He recites this tristich which contains the word (v<I>ri</I>shan), 'mighty.' All these kindling verses, it is true, are addressed to Agni; Indra, however, is the deity of sacrifice, Indra is the mighty (hero); hence these his (the sacrificer's) kindling verses thereby become possessed of Indra: this is the reason why he recites the tristich containing the word 'mighty.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:34">1:4:1:34</A></FONT></span>34. He recites [the eighth s&acirc;midhen&icirc;]: 'Agni we choose as messenger!' Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, were contending for superiority. When they were thus contending, the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; stood between them. That g&acirc;yatr&icirc; was the same as this earth, and this earth indeed lay between them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_296"></A><A HREF="#fn_295"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now both of them knew that whichever she would side with, they would be victorious and the others would be defeated. Both parties then invited her secretly to come to them. Agni acted as messenger for the gods; and an Asura-Rakshas, named</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Saharakshas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_297"></A><A HREF="#fn_296"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the Asuras. She then followed Agni: he therefore recites, 'Agni we choose for messenger,' because he was the messenger of the gods.--'As Hot<I>ri</I> the all-knowing, him!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:35">1:4:1:35</A></FONT></span>35. Here now some people recite, 'He who is the Hot<I>ri</I> of the all-knowing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_298"></A><A HREF="#fn_297"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;' lest (in saying 'for Hot<I>ri</I>, the all-knowing, him') one should say to oneself 'enough (i.e. have done)!' This, however, he should not do; for by (doing) so they do at the sacrifice what is human; and what is human, is inauspicious at a sacrifice. Therefore, lest he should do what is inauspicious at the sacrifice, he should recite, just as it is recited by the <I>Ri</I>k, 'for Hot<I>ri</I>, the all-knowing, him!' [He continues], 'Performing well this sacrifice!' for he, Agni, is indeed a good performer of the sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'performing well this sacrifice.' She (g&acirc;yatr&icirc;, or the earth) sided with the gods, and the gods thereupon were victorious and the Asuras were defeated: and verily he for whom, knowing this, they recite this (verse), is himself victorious and his adversaries are defeated.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:36">1:4:1:36</A></FONT></span>36. He therefore recites this, the eighth s&acirc;midhen&icirc;). This, indeed, is peculiarly a g&acirc;yatr&icirc; verse, since it is of eight syllables that the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; (metre) consists: for this reason he recites the eighth (s&acirc;midhen&icirc;).</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:37">1:4:1:37</A></FONT></span>37. Here now some people place the two (dh&acirc;yy&acirc;s) additional kindling verses before (the eighth s&acirc;midhen&icirc;), arguing, 'The two dh&acirc;yy&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_299"></A><A HREF="#fn_298"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> mean food: this edible food we place in front (or, in the mouth, mukhata<I>h</I>).' But let him not do this: for with him who inserts the additional verses before (the eighth), the latter (the eighth) is clearly out of its place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_300"></A><A HREF="#fn_299"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, since in that case it (and the succeeding verse) become the tenth and eleventh verses. With him, on the other hand, for whom they recite this as the eighth (kindling verse), it is indeed in its proper place: let him therefore insert the two additional verses after (the ninth).</p>

[He recites the ninth kindling verse]: 'He who is kindled at the cult'--the cult (adhvara), doubtless, is the sacrifice: 'he who is kindled at the sacrifice' he thereby says;--'Agni, the bright, the laudable,' for he is both bright and laudable;--'the flaming-locked, him we adore!' for when he is kindled, his locks, as it were, flame. Previously to (the beginning of the tenth verse), 'O Agni, worshipped, thou art lit!' let him (the Adhvaryu) put on</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:4:1:39">1:4:1:39</A></FONT></span>39. [He continues]: 'Adore, good worshipper, the gods!' worship (adhvara) doubtless means sacrifice: 'adore the gods, good sacrificer,' he thereby says;--'Oblation-bearer, sure, art thou!' for he, Agni, is indeed the bearer of oblations: for this reason he says 'oblation-bearer, sure, art thou.'</p>  
<p>[He recites the last s&acirc;midhen&icirc;]: 'Make offerings! do reverence! Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds, for your oblation-bearer choose!' by this (verse) he urges them on: 'make offerings and worship! do this for (the accomplishment) of whatever desire you kindled him!' this is what he thereby means to say. 'Him, Agni, while the cult proceeds,' he says, because cult means sacrifice: hence he thereby says, 'him, Agni, whilst the sacrifice proceeds;'--'for your oblation-bearer choose!' for he, Agni, is indeed the oblation-bearer, and for this reason he says 'for your oblation-bearer choose (him)!'</p>  
<p>40. This tristich, containing (the word) 'cult (adhvara),' he thus recites. For once when the gods were engaged in sacrificing, their rivals, the Asuras, wished to injure (dhurv, dhvar) them; but, though desirous of injuring them, they were</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A></p>  
<p>unable to injure them and were foiled: for this reason the sacrifice is called adhvara ('not damaged, uninterrupted'); and for whomsoever, that knows this, they recite this tristich containing (the word) adhvara ('cult, sacrifice'), his rival, though desirous of injuring him, is foiled; and he, (the sacrificer), moreover, gains as much as one gains by offering a Soma-sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_302"></A><A HREF="#fn_301"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>

The first and eleventh verses are recited three times; and when at the end of each verse the Hot<I>ri</I> pronounces the syllable o<I>m</I>, the Adhvaryu throws a stick (samidh) into the fire,--up to the eighth verse, at the end of which the tenth stick is thrown in. At the end of the ninth verse five of the remaining six sticks are thrown into the fire. The throwing of the first stick is accompanied by the sacrificer pronouncing the dedicatory formula (ty&acirc;ga), 'For Agni this, not for me!'</p>

II, 5, 7, 3-4 also v&acirc;<I>g</I>a is in the first place rendered by 'food,' while afterwards it is identified with the months (i.e. the coursers? gamana<I>s</I>&icirc;la, S&acirc;y.); as abhidyava<I>h</I> (in the sense of 'shining in both directions,' i.e. in the form of the waxing and waning moon, S&acirc;y.) is referred to the half-moons.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_281"></A><A HREF="sbe1217.htm#fr_282">104:1</A> To this important legend attention was first drawn by Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 170 seq. (cf. also Ind. Streifen, I, p. 13; J. Muir, Sanskrit Texts, II, p. 402). It was pointed out by Weber that this legend distinguishes three successive stages of the eastward migration of the Br&acirc;hmanical Hindus. In the first place the settlements of the &Acirc;ryans had already been extended from the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ab (where they were settled in the times of the hymns of the Rig-veda) as far as the Sarasvat&icirc;. They thence pushed forward, led by the Videgha M&acirc;thava and his priest, according to our legend, as far east as the river Sad&acirc;n&icirc;r&acirc; (that is, 'she that is always filled with water'), which, according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, is another name for the Karatoy&acirc; (the modern Kurattee, on which Bograh lies), which formed the eastern boundary of the Videhas; or more probably the Ga<I>n</I><I>d</I>ak&icirc; (the modern Gunduck, a noble river which falls into the Ganges opposite Patna, and) which formed the boundary between the Kosalas and the Videhas (cf. par. 17). It would appear from our legend, that for some time the Aryans did not venture to cross this river; but at the time of the author the country to the east of it had long been occupied by them. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes the hero of the legend to be Videgha, the M&acirc;dhava or son of Madhu; but Videgha, an older form of Videha, is more probably intended here (as Weber takes it) for the name of that people and country (corresponding to the modern Tirhut). The Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara (or Agni who is common to all men) of our legend Professor Weber considers a personification of Br&acirc;hmanical worship and civilisation and the destructive effects of their extension.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_283"></A><A HREF="sbe1217.htm#fr_284">106:1</A> That is to say, it is not affected by the heat of the summer, as the other rivers, but rushes along as rapidly and as well-filled as ever.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_284"></A><A HREF="sbe1217.htm#fr_285">106:2</A> <I>G</I>ig&acirc;ti is taken by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a in the sense of 'he sings, praises.' Our author, on the other hand, seems to interpret it by 'he conquers (<I>g</I>i);' see, however, next note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_285"></A><A HREF="sbe1217.htm#fr_286">106:3</A> The text has, 'Sa hi dev&acirc;n <I>g</I>ig&icirc;shati sa hi dev&acirc;n <I>g</I>ig&acirc;<I>m</I>sati.' The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va recension has the same reading, except that it omits 'hi' <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A> in both cases. Instead of <I>g</I>ig&acirc;<I>m</I>sati, however, some MSS., as well as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, read <I>g</I>igh&acirc;<I>m</I>sati ('he wishes to conquer, or beat, the gods'), probably an old corruption, easily accounted for by the circumstance that <I>g</I>igishati is the regular desiderative of <I>g</I>i, 'to conquer,' though it also occurs in some passages as the desiderative of g&acirc;, 'to go.' S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, however, though he reads <I>g</I>igh&acirc;<I>m</I>sati, here allows to the root han (with Naigh. 2, 14) the meaning of 'to go.' Cf.

<P><A NAME="fn_298"></A><A HREF="sbe1217.htm#fr_299">112:1</A> Whenever thirteen kindling verses are recited instead of eleven (or counting the repetitions of the first and last verses, seventeen instead of fifteen), the two verses Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6 are inserted according to our author after the ninth, and according to others before the eighth, s&acirc;midhen&icirc;.

This reasoning is far from satisfactory, since the two dh&acirc;yy&acirc;s (Rig-veda III, 27, 5 and 6) are also g&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses.</P>
