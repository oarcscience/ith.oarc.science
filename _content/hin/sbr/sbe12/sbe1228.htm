<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:2">1:6:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. One of his mouths was Soma-drinking, one spirit-drinking, and one for other kinds of food. Indra hated him and cut off those heads of his.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:3">1:6:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. Now from the one which was Soma-drinking, a hazel-cock (francoline partridge) sprang forth; whence the latter is of brownish colour, for king Soma is brown.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:4">1:6:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. From the one which was spirit-drinking, further, a sparrow sprang; whence the latter talks as if stammering, for he who has drunk spirits, talks as if he stammered.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:5">1:6:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. Then from the one which served for other kinds of food, a partridge sprang; whence the latter</p>

<p>is much variegated in colour: on its wings, namely, butter-drops, as it were, have dropped in one place and honey- (or mead-) drops in another, for suchlike, as it were, was the food which he consumed with that (mouth).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:6">1:6:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I> was furious: 'Has he indeed slain my son?' he exclaimed. He brought Soma-juice from which Indra was excluded; and just as the Soma-juice on being produced had Indra excluded from it (apendra), so it remained (when it was offered up).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:7">1:6:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. Indra thought with himself, 'They are now excluding me from Soma!' and though uninvited, he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, even as the stronger (consumes) that of a weaker. That (Soma) however, injured him; it flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; from his mouth alone it did not flow, but from all the other (openings of the) vital airs it flowed; hence (was instituted) at that time the ish<I>t</I>i, called Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;: on the occasion of that (ceremony) it is explained how the gods healed him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_386"></A><A HREF="#fn_383"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:8">1:6:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I> was furious, and exclaimed, 'Has he indeed consumed my Soma uninvited?' However, he himself desecrated the sacrifice, for what pure (Soma) there was left in the tub he let flow (into the fire), saying, 'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_387"></A><A HREF="#fn_384"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' The moment it reached the fire, it</p>

<p><A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A></p>  
<p>developed (into human shape), or, as some say, it so developed whilst on its way (to the fire). It became possessed of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_388"></A><A HREF="#fn_385"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Agni and Soma, of all sciences, all glory, all nourishment, all prosperity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:9">1:6:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. And since it so developed whilst rolling onwards (v<I>ri</I>t), it became V<I>ri</I>tra; and since he sprang forth footless, therefore he was a serpent. Danu and Dan&acirc;y&ucirc; received him like mother and father&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_389"></A><A HREF="#fn_386"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, whence they call him D&acirc;nava.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:10">1:6:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. And because he (Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>) said, 'Grow thou, having Indra for thy foe!' therefore Indra slew him (V<I>ri</I>tra). Had he said, 'Grow thou, the foe (slayer) of Indra!' he (V<I>ri</I>tra) would certainly have forthwith slain Indra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:11">1:6:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. And because he (Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>) said, 'Grow thou!' therefore he (V<I>ri</I>tra) grew an arrow's range sideways and an arrow's range forward: he forced back both the western ocean and the eastern one; and in proportion as he extended did he devour the food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:12">1:6:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. In the fore-noon the gods offered him food, at mid-day the men, and in the after-noon the Fathers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:13">1:6:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. Now while Indra was thus moving on (in pursuit of V<I>ri</I>tra), he addressed Agni and Soma, 'Ye belong to me and I belong to you! That one is nothing to you: why then do ye support that Dasyu against me? Come over to me!'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:14">1:6:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. They replied, 'What is to be our reward in that case?' He offered them that Agni-Soma cake on eleven potsherds: this is the reason why there is a cake on eleven potsherds for Agni and Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:15">1:6:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. They went over to him, and after them went forth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_390"></A><A HREF="#fn_387"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> all the gods, all the sciences, all glory, all nourishment, all prosperity: thus by offering that (cake to Agni and Soma) Indra became what Indra now is. Such then is the significance of the full-moon offering; and he who, knowing this, performs the full-moon offering in this wise, attains to the same state of prosperity, becomes thus endowed with glory, becomes such a consumer of food (as V<I>ri</I>tra).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:16">1:6:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now V<I>ri</I>tra, on being struck, lay contracted like a leather bottle drained of its contents, like a skin bag with the barley-meal shaken out. Indra rushed at him, meaning to slay him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:17">1:6:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. He said, 'Do not hurl (thy thunderbolt) at me! thou art now what I (was before) Only cut me in twain; but do not let me be annihilated!' He (Indra) said, 'Thou shalt be my food!' He replied, 'So be it!' He accordingly cut him in twain; and from that (part) of his which was of the Soma nature&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_391"></A><A HREF="#fn_388"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he made the moon, and that which was demoniacal (asurya) he made enter these creatures as their belly; hence people say&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_392"></A><A HREF="#fn_389"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: 'V<I>ri</I>tra was then a consumer of food, and V<I>ri</I>tra is so now.' For even now, whenever that one (the moon) waxes fuller, it fills itself out of this world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_393"></A><A HREF="#fn_390"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and whenever</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></p>  
<p>these creatures crave for food, they pay tribute to this V<I>ri</I>tra, the belly. Whosoever knows that V<I>ri</I>tra as a consumer of food, becomes himself a consumer of food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:18">1:6:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. Those deities then said, 'Ye, Agni and Soma, whom we have followed hither, take the best part (of the sacrificial food): do let us share along with you in what ye have!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:19">1:6:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. They both said, 'What (share) shall then be ours?' They replied, 'For whatever deity they shall take out sacrificial food, they shall in the first place offer to you some clarified butter!' Whenever, therefore, they take out sacrificial food for any deity, they in the first place offer two butter-portions to Agni and Soma. This does not take place at the Soma-sacrifice, nor at the animal offering; for they said, 'for whatever deity they take out . . . &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_394"></A><A HREF="#fn_391"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:20">1:6:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. Agni then said, 'In me they shall sacrifice for all of you, and thus I give you a share in me!' For this reason they sacrifice in Agni (the fire) to all the gods; and for this reason they say that Agni is all the deities.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:21">1:6:3:21</A></FONT></span>21. Soma then said, 'Me they shall offer up to all of you, and thus I give you a share in me!' For this reason they offer up Soma to all the gods; and hence they say that Soma is all the deities.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:22">1:6:3:22</A></FONT></span>22. And further, since all the gods were abiding in Indra, for that reason they say that Indra is all the deities, that the gods have Indra for their chief (<I>s</I>resh<I>th</I>a). Thus the gods came in a three-fold</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_169"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 169</FONT></A></p>  
<p>way to consist of one deity; and he who knows this becomes individually the chief of his own (people).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:23">1:6:3:23</A></FONT></span>23. Twofold, verily, is this, there is no third: to wit, the moist and the dry; and what is dry, that relates to Agni; and what is moist, that relates to Soma. But (it may be objected) if this is twofold only, why then this manifold performance:--the two butter-portions for Agni and Soma, the low-voiced offering to Agni and Soma, and the rice-cake for Agni and Soma,--when by means of any one of these he obtains all, why then this manifold performance? [The answer to this objection is that] so manifold is the power, the generative force of Agni and Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:24">1:6:3:24</A></FONT></span>24. The sun, indeed, relates to Agni, and the moon to Soma; the day relates to Agni, and the night to Soma; the waxing half-moon relates to Agni, and the waning one to Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:25">1:6:3:25</A></FONT></span>25. 'By means of the two butter-portions he obtains the sun and the moon; by means of the low-voiced offering he obtains the day and the night; and by means of the rice-cake he obtains the two half-moons,' thus say some.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:26">1:6:3:26</A></FONT></span>26. &Acirc;suri, on the other hand, said: 'By means of the two butter-portions he gains any two (of those objects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_392"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>); by means of the low-voiced offering he obtains any (other) two; and by means of the rice-cake he obtains any (other) two: "all has been obtained, all has been conquered by me! with that All I will slay V<I>ri</I>tra; with the All I will slay the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_170"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 170</FONT></A></p>  
<p>spiteful enemy!" thus he thinks, and for that reason there is this manifold performance.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:27">1:6:3:27</A></FONT></span>27. On this point it has also been remarked: 'Why this sameness (of performance)? By what is introduced between the butter(-offering) to Agni and Soma and the rice-cake to Agni and Soma, a repetition of performance (is committed)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' Sameness (of performance), nevertheless, is avoided in this way: the one (viz. the low-voiced offering) consists of butter, and the other of a rice-cake, hence the one is different from the other. Moreover, after reciting a <I>Ri</I>k-verse as anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, he pronounces the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; with the word 'pleased' (in the case of the butter-portions to Agni and Soma); and after reciting a <I>Ri</I>k-verse as anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, he pronounces the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; in the form of a <I>Ri</I>k-verse (in the case of the low-voiced offering to Agni and Soma), hence the one is (again) different from the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Sameness of performance is also avoided in this way: in a low voice (he utters the formulas when) he offers of the butter, and with a loud voice of the cake; and what is (uttered) in a low voice, that is the manner of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: hence he recites for that (low-voiced</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_171"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 171</FONT></A></p>  
<p>offering) an anush<I>t</I>ubh-verse as the invitatory formula (anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;), for the anush<I>t</I>ubh represents speech, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati also is speech.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:28">1:6:3:28</A></FONT></span>28. By means of that low-voiced offering the gods stealing near slew, with that thunderbolt, the vasha<I>t</I>-call, whichever they wished of the Asuras; and so does this one, after stealing near by means of that low-voiced offering, slay with that thunderbolt, the vasha<I>t</I>-call, the wicked, spiteful enemy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. This is why he performs the low-voiced offering.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:29">1:6:3:29</A></FONT></span>29. Having recited (at the butter-portions) a <I>Ri</I>k-verse as the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, he recites the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; with the word 'pleased:' in consequence of this, creatures are brought forth here with teeth on one side (in one jaw); for the <I>Ri</I>k means bone and the tooth also is bone, so that he thereby produces bone on one side.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:30">1:6:3:30</A></FONT></span>30. Having recited (at the low-voiced offering) a <I>Ri</I>k-verse as the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, he recites as the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; a (second) <I>Ri</I>k-verse: in consequence of this, creatures with teeth on both sides are brought forth here; for the <I>Ri</I>k means bone and the tooth also is bone, so that he thereby produces bone on both sides. These creatures, indeed, are of two kinds, viz. such as have teeth on one side only, and such as have teeth on both sides&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and verily he who sacrifices, knowing</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_172"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 172</FONT></A></p>  
<p>thus the generative power of Agni and Soma, becomes rich in offspring and cattle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:31">1:6:3:31</A></FONT></span>31. When he (the sacrificer) is about to enter upon the fast of the full-moon ceremony, he may not be entirely sated. He therefore now compresses (that part of) his belly which relates to the Asuras; and next morning, by means of the oblations, that which relates to the gods. Now the practice regarding the full-moon ceremony is as follows:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:32">1:6:3:32</A></FONT></span>32. One may (enter on the) fast at the very time (of full moon), thinking, 'Now I will slay V<I>ri</I>tra, now I will slay the spiteful enemy!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:33">1:6:3:33</A></FONT></span>33. One may also fast only on the following day. Now he who (enters on the) fast at the very time (of full moon), gets, as it were, into collision&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (with some one); and when two come into collision with one another, it is indeed doubtful which of the two will get the better of the other. He, on the other hand, who prefers to fast on the second day (only), is as one who crushes from behind a retreating (enemy) before he is able to resist the attack: striking in one direction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, in fact, is he who thus keeps the fast on the second day only.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:34">1:6:3:34</A></FONT></span>34. Let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full moon). He who keeps the fast on the following day only is as one who finally crushes one struck down by some one else; he only does what has been done before by some one else, he only</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_173"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 173</FONT></A></p>  
<p>follows another's lead; let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full moon).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:35">1:6:3:35</A></FONT></span>35. After Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati had created the living beings, his joints (parvan) were relaxed. Now Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, doubtless, is the year, and his joints are the two junctions of day and night (i.e. the, twilights), the full moon and new moon, and the beginnings of the seasons.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:36">1:6:3:36</A></FONT></span>36. He was unable to rise with his relaxed joints; and the gods healed him by means of these havis-offerings: by means of the Agnihotra they healed that joint (which consists of) the two junctions of day and night, joined that together; by means of the full-moon and the new-moon sacrifice they healed that joint (which consists of) the full and new moon, joined that together; and by means of the (three) <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;syas (seasonal offerings) they healed that joint (which consists of) the beginnings of the seasons, joined that together.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:37">1:6:3:37</A></FONT></span>37. With his joints thus repaired he betook himself to this food,--to the food which is here (offered) to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; and he who, knowing this, enters upon the fast at the very time (of full moon), heals Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's joint at the proper time, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati favours him. Thus he who, knowing this, enters upon the fast at the very time (of full moon) becomes a consumer of food: let him therefore enter on the fast at the very time (of full moon).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:38">1:6:3:38</A></FONT></span>38. These two butter-portions (to Agni and Soma), truly, are the eyes of the sacrifice; he, therefore, offers them in front (of, or before, the havis), for these eyes are in the front (of the head). Hence he thereby places the eyes in the front; and for this reason these eyes are in the front (of the head).</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_174"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 174</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:39">1:6:3:39</A></FONT></span>39. Some people offer Agni's butter-portion in the north-eastern part (of the fire), and Soma's butter-portion in the south-eastern part, thinking, 'Thereby we place the eyes in the front (of the head).' This, however, is rather unintelligible; for the several dishes of sacrificial food (havis) represent the body of the sacrifice; when therefore he offers in front of (or before) the havis, he thereby places the eyes in the front. Let him rather make the offerings (in that part of the fire) where he thinks the fiercest blaze is; for only by being offered in blazing (fire) are oblations successful&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:40">1:6:3:40</A></FONT></span>40. Having recited (at the butter-portions) a <I>Ri</I>k-verse as anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; (invitatory formula), he recites by way of y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; (offering-prayer) the (formula containing the word) 'pleased;' thereby these boneless eyes are set in what is bone. If, on the other hand, after reciting a <I>Ri</I>k-verse as anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_175"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 175</FONT></A></p>  
<p>were to use a <I>Ri</I>k-verse as the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, he would make it bone instead of eye.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:3:41">1:6:3:41</A></FONT></span>41. Those two (qualities), truly, are related to the natures of Agni and Soma: that which is white is related to Agni, and that which is black is related to Soma. If, however (it were asserted), on the contrary, that what is black is related to Agni, and what is white is related to Soma,--[the answer would be:--] what sees is of the nature of Agni, for dry, as it were, are the eyes of one who looks, and that which is dry relates to Agni;--and what sleeps is of the nature of Soma, for moist, as it were, are the eyes of one who is asleep, and moist also is Soma. And, verily, he who thus knows those two butter-portions to be eyes, remains endowed with eye-sight till old age in this world, and starts in yonder world possessed of eye-sight.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_384"></A><A HREF="sbe1228.htm#fr_387">165:2</A> According to Taitt. S. II, 4, 12, 1, also the fault committed by Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I> consisted in his faulty accentuation of the compound indra<I>s</I>atru in the formula. What he intended to say was that Agni, on drinking the Soma, should grow strong so as to be 'the foe (slayer) of Indra,' and the compound should therefore have been accented on the second member, viz. indra<I>s</I>&aacute;tru (the foe of <A NAME="page_166"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 166</FONT></A> Indra); but by accenting it on the first member, indra<I>s</I>atru, he made it 'having Indra for his foe (slayer).' According to the version of the Taitt. S., Agni, the fire, on the Soma being poured into it, rose up (spirted) as if to execute Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>'s wish; but immediately relapsed into its former state of inertness on hearing the mis-pronounced word.</P>

The objection here raised is, that the low-voiced offering, which is intermediate between the two above-mentioned oblations to Agni-Soma, is made to the same two deities.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_394"></A><A HREF="sbe1228.htm#fr_397">170:2</A> When the two butter-portions to Agni and Soma are offered, the Hot<I>ri</I> recites the verses Rig-veda VI, 16, 34 (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. 33, 9), and Rig-veda, I, 95, 5 (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. 19, 42) respectively, as anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;s, or invitatory prayers, each of which is followed by the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; (offering-formula): 'We who pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni (or Soma respectively),--may Agni (Soma) pleased (<I>g</I>ush&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>) accept of the butter-oblation! V&acirc;usha<I>t</I>!' At the low-voiced offering (up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>uy&acirc;<I>g</I>a) to Agni-Soma, on the other hand, he first utters (in a low voice) as anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; the verse Rig-veda I, 93, 2, and thereupon as y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; Rig-veda I, 93, 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_395"></A><A HREF="sbe1228.htm#fr_398">171:1</A> The two prayers of the low-voiced offering are muttered in a low voice; but the 'V&acirc;usha<I>t</I>!' at the end of the offering-prayer (as the 'Om!' at the end of the invitatory prayer) is uttered aloud. Hence the above symbolical explanation.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_396"></A><A HREF="sbe1228.htm#fr_399">171:2</A> The same distinction is made in Rig-veda X, 90, 10, where it is stated that from the Purusha sprang the horse and what other animals with two rows of teeth (viz. the ass and mule, according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a) on the one hand, and cows, goats, and sheep on the other. In Taitt. II, 2, 6, 3, also the horse is mentioned along with man as belonging to the former class of living beings. Cf. also Taitt. V, 1, 2, 6; Ath.-veda V, 19, 2; 31, 3; Weber, Ind. Stud. X, 58.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_397"></A><A HREF="sbe1228.htm#fr_400">172:1</A> Sam-kramate, literally 'comes together with, meets (somebody).' This symbolical explanation was probably suggested by the circumstance that the full moon marks the junction (sandhi) of the two pakshas or half months; whereas the new moon (am&acirc;v&acirc;sy&acirc;, 'dwelling together') marks the point of least distance between sun and moon.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_398"></A><A HREF="sbe1228.htm#fr_401">172:2</A> Anyatogh&acirc;tin, ? thus St. Petersburg Dictionary.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_399"></A><A HREF="sbe1228.htm#fr_402">174:1</A> Katy. III, 3, 20-22 admits either mode of offering the butter-portions. These oblations are effected in the following way:--The Adhvaryu, having called on the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, takes with the dipping-spoon (sruva) butter from the dhruv&acirc; and puts it into the <I>g</I>uh&ucirc;; he then draws some with the sruva from the butter-pot and replenishes the dhruv&acirc; with it [according to the K&acirc;<I>n</I>vas, with the text 'May the dhruv&acirc; fatten with the havis-butter, sacrifice after sacrifice, for those who go to the gods,--the udder of S&ucirc;ry&acirc; in the lap of Aditi: may the earth flow abundantly at this sacrifice!']. The same process is then repeated three (additional) times (with a <I>G</I>amadagni four times): hence the offering is said to consist of four (or five) cuttings. The Hot<I>ri</I> then recites the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; (see note on I, 6, 3, 27), which is followed by the Adhvaryu's call 'om <I>s</I>r&acirc;vaya' and the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra's response 'astu <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>.' Thereupon the Hot<I>ri</I>, having been called upon by the Adhvaryu to give the offering-prayer to Agni (or Soma), recites the respective y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, at the concluding vausha<I>t</I> of which the oblation is poured into the fire, (whilst the sacrificer utters the usual dedicatory formula, 'This for Agni (Soma), not for me!')</P>
