### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:1">1:4:5:1</span></span>1. When
he (the Adhvaryu) is about to make the second libation with the
offering-spoon (sru*k*), he (twice) lays his joined hands (a*ñg*ali) on
the ground before the two offering-spoons (*g*uhû and upabh*ri*t), with
the formulas (Vâ*g*. S. II, 7 b), 'Adoration to the gods!' 'Svadhâ to
the fathers!' Thereby he propitiates the gods and the fathers, now that

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

he is about to perform the duties of the sacrificial priest. With the
formula, 'May ye two be easy to manage for me!' he takes the two
offering-spoons: he thereby means to say, 'May ye two be easy to handle
for me; may I be able to handle you!'--He further says (Vâ*g*. S. II.
8), 'May I this day offer up the butter to the gods unspilt!' whereby he
means to say, 'May I to-day perform an undisturbed sacrifice to the
gods!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:2">1:4:5:2</span></span>2. And
again, 'May I not sin against thee with my foot, O Vish*n*u!' Vish*n*u,
indeed, is the sacrifice: it is the latter therefore that he propitiates
by saying, 'may I not sin against thee!' Further, 'May I step into thy
wealth-abounding shade, O Agni!' whereby he says, 'may I step into thy
auspicious shade, O Agni <span id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_322)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:3">1:4:5:3</span></span>3.
Further, 'Thou art the abode of Vish*n*u!' Vish*n*u, indeed, is the
sacrifice, and near to this he now stands: this is why he says, 'thou
art the abode of Vish*n*u!'--'Here Indra performed his heroic deed <span
id="fr_325"></span>[2](#fn_323);' for it was while standing in this
place that Indra drove off towards the south the evil spirits, the
Rakshas: for this reason he says, 'here Indra performed his heroic
deed.'--'Erect stood the cult;' cult,

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

namely, means sacrifice, hence he thereby says 'erect stood the
sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:4">1:4:5:4</span></span>4.
Further (Vâ*g*. S. II, 9): 'O Agni, take thou upon thyself the office of
Hot*ri*, take thou upon thyself the part of messenger!' for Agni is both
Hot*ri* and messenger to the gods: hence he thereby says, 'know
thou <span id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_324) both (offices) which thou art
(holding) for the gods!'--'May earth and heaven guard thee! Guard thou
earth and heaven!' there is nothing obscure in this.--'Indra, by this
butter-oblation, may be the maker of good offering (svish*t*ak*ri*t) for
the gods! Svâhâ!' Indra, indeed, is the deity of sacrifice; therefore he
says 'Indra, by this butter-oblation . . . 'It is for speech that he
makes this sprinkling, and Indra is speech' so say some; and for this
reason also he says Indra, by this butter-oblation. . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:5">1:4:5:5</span></span>5. Having
then returned (to his former position behind the altar), without letting
the two offering-spoons touch each other, he mixes (some of the butter
left in the *g*uhû) with (that in) the dhruvâ. Now the second libation
(which he has just offered) is the head of the sacrifice, and the dhruvâ
is its body <span id="fr_327"></span>[2](#fn_325): hence he thereby
replaces the head on the body. And the second libation, moreover, is the
head of the sacrifice, and the head (*s*iras) represents excellence
(*s*rî), for the head does indeed represent excellence: hence, of one
who is the most excellent (*s*resh*th*a) of a community, people say that
he is 'the head of that community.'

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:6">1:4:5:6</span></span>6. The
sacrificer, assuredly, stands behind the dhruvâ, and he who means evil
to him stands behind the upabh*ri*t <span
id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_326). Hence if he were to mix (the butter
remaining in the *g*uhû) with (that in) the upabh*ri*t, he would bestow
excellence on him who means evil to the sacrificer; but in this, way he
bestows that excellence on the sacrificer himself: for this reason he
mixes (the butter in the gull with (that in) the dhruvâ.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:7">1:4:5:7</span></span>7. He
mixes it, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. II, 9 h), 'Light with light!' for
light (lustre), indeed, is the butter in the one (spoon) and light also
is that in the other. Thereby these two lights unite with each other,
and for this reason he mixes (the butter) in this manner.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:8">1:4:5:8</span></span>8. Now a
dispute once took place between Mind and Speech as to <span
id="fr_329"></span>[2](#fn_327) which was the better of the two. Both
Mind and Speech said, 'I am excellent!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:9">1:4:5:9</span></span>9. Mind
said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for thou dost not speak anything
that is not understood by me; and since thou art only an imitator of
what is done by me and a follower in my wake, I am surely better than
thou!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:10">1:4:5:10</span></span>10.
Speech said, 'Surely I am better than thou, for what thou knowest I make
known, I communicate.'

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:11">1:4:5:11</span></span>11.
They went to appeal to Pra*g*âpati for his decision. He, Pra*g*âpati,
decided in favour of Mind, saying (to Speech), 'Mind is indeed better
than thou, for thou art an imitator of its deeds and a follower in its
wake; and inferior, surely, is he who imitates his better's deeds and
follows in his wake.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:12">1:4:5:12</span></span>12.
Then Speech (vâ*k*, fem.) being thus gainsaid, was dismayed and
miscarried. She, Speech, then said to Pra*g*âpati, 'May I never be thy
oblation-bearer, I whom thou hast gainsaid!' Hence whatever at the
sacrifice is performed for Pra*g*âpati, that is performed in a low
voice; for speech would not act as oblation-bearer for Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="1:4:5:13">1:4:5:13</span></span>13.
That germ (retas) the gods then brought away in a skin or in some
(vessel). They asked: 'Is it here (atra)?' and therefore it developed
into Atri. For the same reason one becomes guilty by (intercourse) with
a woman who has just miscarried (âtreyî); for it is from that woman,
from the goddess Speech, that these (germs) originate <span
id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_328).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_321"></span>[127:1](sbe1220.htm#fr_323) The sweeping of the
fire is performed with the straw-band with which the fire-wood was tied
together (Katy. III, 1, 13), and which is here compared with the lash of
a whip.

<span id="fn_322"></span>[128:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_324) While he pronounces
this formula (and while the Hot*ri* recites the formula of invitation to
the gods, cf. note on I, 4, 2, 26) the Adhvaryu steps to the south side
of the altar (and Âhavanîya fire) and in so doing must take care always
to keep the left foot before the right (Kâty. III. 1, 16, 18) and not to
touch the top of the prastara, ib. 17, schol. In returning (par. 5) to
his former position he has to keep the right foot before the left.

<span id="fn_323"></span>[128:2](sbe1221.htm#fr_325) With this and the
succeeding formulas, the Adhvaryu makes the second libation (cf. note on
I, 4, 4, 1). Before the butter is poured into the fire the sacrificer
pronounces the dedicatory formula, 'Om! for Indra this, not for me!'

<span id="fn_324"></span>[129:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_326) Ve*h*, in the
formula, our author refers to vid, 'to know,' instead of to vî, 'to
strive after, undertake.'

<span id="fn_325"></span>[129:2](sbe1221.htm#fr_327) Cf. I, 3, 2, 2, and
Taitt. S. II, 5, 11, 7-8. The second libation (âghâra) has just been
made with the *g*uhû.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[130:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_328) The same idea has
been expressed above, I, 3, 2, 11.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[130:2](sbe1221.htm#fr_329) Cf. Taitt. S. II,
5, 11, 4: 'Mind and Speech (or Voice) were contending against one
another.' 'I will carry the oblation to the gods!' said Speech. 'I (will
carry it) to the gods!' said the Mind. They went to Pra*g*âpati to
question him. Pra*g*âpati said (to Speech), 'Thou art the handmaid
(dûtî) of the mind, for what one thinks in one's mind that one speaks
with one's speech.' \[Speech replied\], 'Then indeed they shall not
offer to thee with speech!' For this reason they offer to Pra*g*âpati
with the mind; for Pra*g*âpati, as it were, is the mind, &c.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[131:1](sbe1221.htm#fr_330) 'Tasmâd apy âtreyyâ
yoshitainasvy etasyai hi yoshâyai vâ*k*o devatâyâ ete sambhûtâ*h*,'
\[ete laukikâ*h* sarve garbhâ*h* sambhûtâ*h*, Sây.\]--The Kâ*n*va text
has, 'Tasmâd api striyâtreyyainasvîty âhur etasyâ hi sa yoshâyâ devatâyâ
vâ*k*a*h* sambhûta iti' \['--for it is from that woman, from the goddess
Speech, that he (Atri) originated'\].
