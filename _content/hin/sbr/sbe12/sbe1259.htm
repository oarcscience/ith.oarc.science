<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:1">2:5:4:1</A></FONT></span>1. Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew V<I>ri</I>tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_929"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; by means of it they gained that supreme authority which they now wield; and so does he (the Sacrificer) thereby now slay his wicked, spiteful enemy, and gain the victory: this is why he performs this sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:2">2:5:4:2</A></FONT></span>2. The mode of its performance (is as follows): They raise an uttara-vedi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_930"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; they use clotted butter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_931"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; and they churn the fire. There are nine</p>

<p>fore-offerings and nine after-offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_936"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and three Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us. In the first place there are those five oblations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:3">2:5:4:3</A></FONT></span>3. Now as to why there is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni. With Agni, (shaped into) a sharp point (te<I>g</I>as)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_938"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, indeed, they (the gods) slew him (V<I>ri</I>tra); and Agni, that sharp point, swerved not: hence there is (a cake) for Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:4">2:5:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Soma. With the aid of Soma, the king, indeed they slew him, they who have Soma for their king: hence there is a pap for Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:5">2:5:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. Then as to why there is a cake on twelve, or eight&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_939"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, potsherds for Savit<I>ri</I>. Savit<I>ri</I>, indeed, is the impeller (prasavit<I>ri</I>) of the gods; and impelled by Savit<I>ri</I> they slew him: hence there is (a cake) for Savit<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:6">2:5:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for Sarasvat&icirc;. Sarasvat&icirc; in truth is Speech; and Speech indeed it was that cheered them up, saying, 'Strike! slay&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_940"></A><A HREF="#fn_936"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>!' Hence there is a pap for Sarasvat&icirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:7">2:5:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. Then as to why there is a rice-pap for P&ucirc;shan. P&ucirc;shan doubtless is this earth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>, and this</p>

<p>earth, indeed, gave him (V<I>ri</I>tra) up to slaughter; and they slew him, thus given up by her: hence there is a rice-pap for P&ucirc;shan.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:8">2:5:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then follows a cake on twelve, potsherds for Indra and Agni; for by means of that they slew him, since Agni means fiery glow (te<I>g</I>as), and Indra means manly power, and by means of these two powers they did indeed slay him. Moreover, Agni is the priesthood, and Indra is the nobility; having allied these two, having closely united the priesthood with the nobility, they (the gods) slew him by means of these two powers: hence there is a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:9">2:5:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. Then follows a rice-part for Mahendra. For before the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra he was indeed Indra; but after slaying V<I>ri</I>tra he became Mahendra (the great Indra), even as (a king becomes) a mah&acirc;r&acirc;<I>g</I>a, after obtaining the victory: hence there is a rice-pap for Mahendra. And thereby indeed he renders him great (strong), for the slaying of V<I>ri</I>tra: for this reason also there is a rice-pap for Mahendra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:10">2:5:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. Then follows a cake on one potsherd for Vi<I>s</I>vakarman. To the gods, indeed, on performing the S&acirc;kamedha-sacrifice and obtaining the victory (over V<I>ri</I>tra), that sacred work (karman) was made complete (vi<I>s</I>va), and all was conquered; and so is that sacred work made complete, and all is conquered, by him who has performed the S&acirc;kamedha-sacrifice and obtained the victory: hence there is a cake on one potsherd for Vi<I>s</I>vakarman.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="2:5:4:11">2:5:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. And, verily, by performing this sacrifice the gods became what race, what prosperity of the gods there now is; and that same race he propagates,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_420"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 420</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that same prosperity he attains, whosoever, knowing this, performs this sacrifice. Let him therefore perform this sacrifice.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_937"></A><A HREF="sbe1259.htm#fr_941">418:6</A> This identification of P&ucirc;shan with the earth is very strange, the more so as, at II, 5, 1, 11, special stress is laid on the male nature of P&ucirc;shan. Perhaps it is in his character of bountiful bestower of food and cattle, or as the tutelary god of travellers, that he is so identified.</P>
