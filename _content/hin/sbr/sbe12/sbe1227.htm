<p>concealed themselves: and because they effaced (ayopayan, viz. the sacrifice) with it, therefore it is called y&ucirc;pa (sacrificial post). Now this was heard by the <I>Ri</I>shis:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:2:2">1:6:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. 'Verily, by means of the sacrifice the gods gained this conquest.

They then sipped the sap of the sacrifice, as bees would suck out honey; and having drained the sacrifice and effaced the traces of it with the (sacrificial) post, they concealed themselves.' They (the <I>Ri</I>shis) thereupon set about searching for it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:2:3">1:6:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. They went on praising and toiling; for by (religious) toil, the gods indeed gained what they wished to gain, and (so did) the <I>Ri</I>shis. Now whether it be that the gods caused it (the sacrifice) to attract (or, peep forth to) them, or whether they took to it of their own accord, they said, 'Come, let us go to the place whence the gods obtained possession of the world of heaven!' They went about saying (to one another), 'What attracts? What attracts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_378"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?' and came upon the sacrificial cake which had become a tortoise and was creeping about. Then they all thought, 'This surely must be the sacrifice!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:2:4">1:6:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. They said, 'Stand still for the A<I>s</I>vins! stand still for Sarasvat&icirc;! stand still for Indra!' still it</p>

<p><A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A></p>  
<p>crept on;--'Stand still for Agni!' at this it stopped. Having then enveloped it in fire (Agni), knowing, as they did, that it had stopped for Agni, they Offered it up entirely, for it was an oblation to the gods. Then the sacrifice pleased them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_379"></A><A HREF="#fn_376"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; they produced it, they spread it. And this same sacrifice is taught by the former to the later; the father (teaches it) to his son when he is a student (brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:2:5">1:6:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Now that (cake), which caused the sacrifice to attract (or, appear to) them, first (puras) bestowed (d&acirc;<I>s</I>) it upon them: hence it is (called) purod&acirc;<I>s</I>a, for purod&acirc;<I>s</I>a, doubtless, is the same as purod&acirc;<I>s</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_380"></A><A HREF="#fn_377"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This same cake on eight potsherds for Agni is indispensable on both occasions (at the new- and full-moon ceremonies).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:2:6">1:6:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. That (cake for Agni) does not constitute the (special) sacrificial food (havis) either at the full-moon, or at the new-moon, sacrifice; since the one for Agni and Soma constitutes the havis at the full-moon, and the S&acirc;nn&acirc;yya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_378"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> at the new-moon sacrifice. That one (for Agni) constitutes rather the regular (or, corresponding) sacrifice on both occasions, and because of its fearing lest it should become detached from the sacrifice, it is offered up at the beginning of both the full-moon and the new-moon sacrifice: this is the reason why it is offered at this particular time.</p>

And if any one (householder) were to resort to him (the Adhvaryu) and say, 'Perform an ish<I>t</I>i for me!' let him perform it. Whatever desire the <I>Ri</I>shis entertained when they performed that sacrifice, that desire of theirs was accomplished; and accordingly whatever desire he (the sacrificer) entertains in having this sacrifice performed, that desire of his is accomplished. For whatever deity sacrificial food is taken, to that deity they offer it up in the fire (Agni);--and if he is about to offer it up in the fire, why should he announce it to another deity? To Agni alone therefore (it is announced).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:6:2:8">1:6:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. Agni (the fire), assuredly, represents all the deities, since it is in the fire that they make offering to all deities: to Agni alone therefore (he should announce it), since he thereby has recourse to all the deities.</p>
