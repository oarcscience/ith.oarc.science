<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_248"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 248</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the human one is called upon for the song of praise (s&ucirc;kta-v&acirc;ka);' and when the Hot<I>ri</I> thereupon recites, he recites good words only&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: he thereby invokes a blessing on the sacrificer. It is indeed after the sacrifice that he thus invokes a blessing. A twofold reason there is for his invoking the blessing after the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:2">1:9:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. He who sacrifices, assuredly, is the producer of the sacrifice, since it is by his order that, the priests spread it, that they produce it. He (the Hot<I>ri</I>) now invokes a blessing; and that blessing invoked by him, the sacrifice, on its part, realises for this (sacrificer), knowing as it does that he has produced it. For this reason he invokes a blessing after the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:3">1:9:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. He who sacrifices, assuredly, pleases the gods. Having pleased the gods by that sacrifice,--that is, partly by <I>Ri</I>k-verses, partly by Ya<I>g</I>us-formulas, and partly by oblations,--he obtains a share among them.</p>  
<p>When he has obtained a share among them, then (the Hot<I>ri</I>) invokes a blessing (on him); and that (blessing, invoked by him, the gods realise for this sacrificer), knowing as they do that he has pleased them. For this reason also he invokes a blessing after the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:4">1:9:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. He intones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--'Successful this has turned out, O heaven and earth--,' for successful indeed it has turned out, when one has completed the sacrifice.--'We have completed the song of praise, and the</p>

<p>utterance of worship&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' for indeed these two, the singing of praises and the utterance of worship, form the sacrifice: and accordingly he thereby says, 'We have accomplished the sacrifice, we have obtained possession of the sacrifice.'--'Thou, O Agni, art the voice of praise at the listening&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_585"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of heaven and earth,' he thereby says to Agni, 'Thou art the voice of praise, while heaven and earth listen.'--'May heaven and earth be propitious to thee, O sacrificer, at this sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'May heaven and earth abound in food for thee, O sacrificer, at this sacrifice.'</p>

'They, propitious to the cattle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, profuse in gifts,' he thereby says, 'May they both be propitious to the cattle, and profuse in gifts.'--'They, the fearless and inscrutable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>;' he thereby says, 'Mayest thou not be afraid of anybody; may no one obtain before thee this thy wealth!'</p>

'They, of wide abode, the afforders of safety;' he thereby says, 'May they both be possessed of wide abodes and exempt from danger.'--'They, the rain-skied, the water-pouring,' he thereby says, 'May they both be possessed of rain.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:7">1:9:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. 'They, the genial and beneficent;' he thereby says, 'May they both be genial and beneficent.'--'They, the rich in sap and substance;' he thereby says, 'May they both abound in moisture and afford the means of subsistence.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:8">1:9:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. 'They, of easy access and good abode;' he thereby says, 'May yonder (sky), which thou approachest from below, afford thee easy access; may this (earth) on which thou abidest (or movest) afford thee good abode.'--'With their knowledge--,' thereby he says, 'Both of these approving--'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:9">1:9:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. 'Agni has graciously accepted this oblation, he has grown in strength, he has acquired greater power,' he thereby refers to Agni's butter-portion.--'Soma has graciously accepted this oblation, he has grown in strength, he has acquired greater power,' he thereby refers to Soma's butter-portion.--'Agni has graciously accepted this oblation, he has grown in strength, he has acquired greater power,' he thereby refers to the indispensable cake which is (offered) on both occasions (the new- and full-moon sacrifice).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:10">1:9:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. And in the same way according to the respective deities. 'The butter-drinking gods have graciously accepted the butter, they have grown in strength, they have acquired greater power;' thereby he refers to the fore-offerings and after-offerings; for the butter-drinking gods truly are the fore-offerings and after-offerings.--'Agni, by virtue of his Hot<I>ri</I>-ship, has graciously accepted this oblation, he has</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A></p>  
<p>grown in strength, the has acquired greater power;' thereby he refers to Agni, in virtue of his Hot<I>ri</I>ship. With 'has graciously accepted' the thus enumerates those deities to whom offering has been made: in saying 'Such a one has graciously accepted the oblation, such a one has graciously accepted the oblation,' he accordingly prays for the accomplishment of the sacrifice; for whatever oblation the gods graciously accept, by that he gains great things: hence he says, '(he) has graciously accepted it.' And '(he) has grown in strength' he says, because what the gods delight in, they make mountain high: for this reason he says '(he) has increased.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:11">1:9:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. '(He) has acquired (lit. made for himself) greater power' he says; for assuredly the power of the gods is the sacrifice: it is the latter therefore which they make still greater; and for this reason he says '(he) has acquired greater power.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:12">1:9:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. 'May he prosper in this sacrifice which goes to the gods!' he thereby says, 'May he be successful in this sacrifice which goes to the gods.'--'Thus prays this sacrificer, N.N.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;' here he gives the name, and thereby makes him directly successful in his prayer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:13">1:9:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. 'He prays for long life,' what there (viz. at the invocation of the i<I>d</I>&acirc;)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> was (called implicitly) 'future worship of the gods,' that is here (called) expressly 'long life.'</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:14">1:9:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. 'He prays for abundant offspring,'--what then was 'more abundant offering,' that is here expressly 'abundant offspring.' He who proceeds in this way will ensure dominion. He may, however, say, 'He prays for future worship of the gods,' for thereby (he ensures) long life, offspring, cattle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:15">1:9:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. 'He prays for more abundant offering,' thereby (he prays for) that same object. 'He prays for dominion over his co-evals (or countrymen);'--his co-evals, doubtless, are his vital airs, for he is born along with his vital airs: hence he thereby prays for vital airs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:16">1:9:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. 'He prays for a heavenly abode;'--he who sacrifices assuredly sacrifices with the desire that there may be for him also (a place) in the world of the gods: he thereby confers on him a share in the world of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. 'May he obtain, may he accomplish what he prays for through this offering!' he thereby says, 'May all, that he prays for through this offering, be fulfilled to him!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:17">1:9:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. These five prayers for blessings he offers now, and three (he offered) at the i<I>d</I>&acirc;, these are eight. Of eight syllables, truly, consists the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; metre, and the g&acirc;yatr&icirc; means vigour: hence he thereby imparts vigour to the prayers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:18">1:9:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. Let him not offer more than these; for if he offered more, he would do what is in excess; and what is in excess at the sacrifice, that remains over</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for the benefit of his spiteful enemy: hence he should not offer more (prayers) than these.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:19">1:9:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. Even less,--seven (he may offer)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--'May the gods vouchsafe him that!' he thereby says, 'May the gods grant him that.'--'May the god Agni solicit that from the gods, we men from Agni--,' he thereby says, 'May the god Agni solicit that from the gods, and we will then solicit it for this (sacrificer) from Agni--'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:20">1:9:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. '--What was searched for and found&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;' they indeed searched for the sacrifice, and found it: therefore he says, 'what was searched for and found.'--And 'may both heaven and earth guard this one (enam) from anxiety!' he thereby says, 'may both heaven and earth protect him from suffering.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:21">1:9:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. Here now some say, 'And may both heaven and earth guard me (m&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) . . .,' arguing that in this way the Hot<I>ri</I> does not exclude himself from the benediction. Let him not, however, say this; for, surely, the benediction at the sacrifice is for the sacrificer: what then have the officiating priests to do with it? Whatever blessing the officiating priests invoke at the sacrifice, that is for the sacrificer only. On the other hand, whoever says, 'and may both heaven and earth guard me . . .,' does not establish</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that blessing anywhere: let him therefore say, 'and may both heaven and earth guard this one. . . .'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:22">1:9:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. 'Hither lies the course of any boon;' he thereby makes over to this (sacrificer) whatever is excellent in the sacrifice: for this reason he says, 'hither lies the course of any boon.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:23">1:9:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. 'And this adoration (shall be offered) to the gods!' having attained the completion of the sacrifice, he thereby renders adoration to the gods: for this reason he says, 'and this adoration to the gods!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:24">1:9:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. Thereupon he pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing' (<I>s</I>am-yos)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now it was <I>S</I>amyu B&acirc;rhaspatya who perceived, in its true nature, the consummation of the sacrifice. He went to share in the world of the gods. Thereupon that (knowledge) was entirely lost to men.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:25">1:9:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. It then became known to the <I>Ri</I>shis, that <I>S</I>amyu B&acirc;rhaspatya had perceived, in its true nature, the consummation of the sacrifice, and had gone to share in the world of the gods. By pronouncing the <I>s</I>amyo<I>h</I>, they attained to that same consummation of the sacrifice which <I>S</I>amyu B&acirc;rhaspatya had perceived; and to that same consummation of the sacrifice, which Samyu B&acirc;rhaspatya had perceived, this (Hot<I>ri</I>)</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:26">1:9:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. He intones, 'We long for that All-hail and blessing (<I>s</I>am-yo<I>h</I>);' whereby he says, 'We long for that consummation of the sacrifice which <I>S</I>amyu B&acirc;rhaspatya perceived.<font size="-1" color="green">'</font></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:27">1:9:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. 'Success to the sacrifice, success to the lord of sacrifice!' he who wishes for the consummation of the sacrifice, thereby wishes success to the sacrifice and success to the lord of sacrifice.--'Bliss (svasti) to us, bliss to men!' he thereby says, 'May we enjoy bliss among the gods, bliss among men!'--'May the means of salvation ascend on high!' he thereby says, 'May this sacrifice secure for us the world of the gods!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="1:9:1:28">1:9:1:28</A></FONT></span>28. 'All-hail, for us, to the two-footed, all-hail to the four-footed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' for so far as the two-footed and the four-footed (extend), so far does this universe (extend). Having now attained the consummation of the sacrifice, he bids All-hail to this (sacrificer), and for this reason he says, 'All-hail, for us, to the two-footed, all-hail to the four-footed!'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_595"></A><A HREF="sbe1237.htm#fr_599">254:1</A> See <A HREF="sbe1236.htm#page_247">p. 247</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_581">2</A>. The original meaning of the terms <I>s</I>am yos, as they occur in the Rig-veda, is happily rendered by Professor Max M&uuml;ller (Translation of the Rig-veda, I, p. 182) by 'health and wealth.' In the sacrificial ceremonial a deeper significance bas come to be attached to this benedictory formula, for which it is difficult to find an exact equivalent. The entire <I>s</I>amyuv&acirc;ka, as here given, forms part of a khila to the last book of the <I>Ri</I>k-Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc;; cf. Max M&uuml;ller's edition, vol. vi. p. 32; A. Weber, Ind. Stud. IV, p. 431. The Black Ya<I>g</I>us version of the legend regarding <I>S</I>amyu B&acirc;rhaspatya (Taitt. S. II, 6, 10) is quite different from ours; they were both invented to explain <I>s</I>am yos.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_596"></A><A HREF="sbe1237.htm#fr_600">255:1</A> This formula occurs almost identically in Rig-veda VI, 74, 1; VII, 54, 1; (IX, 69, 7.) Cf. Max M&uuml;ller, Translation of the Rig-veda, I, p. 180, where attention is drawn to a somewhat similar phrase in the Umbric prayers of the Eugubian tables.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_597"></A><A HREF="sbe1237.htm#fr_601">255:2</A> In K&acirc;ty. III, 6, 21 the touching of the altar is prescribed, with the text V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. II, 19 b; the commentators differ as to whether the sacrificer or the Adhvaryu is to do this. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; omits that formula, and hence assigns this touching to the Hot<I>ri</I>. Harisv&acirc;min remarks that the Hot<I>ri</I> touches the earth with the little finger of his right hand, as stated in the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va recension. The latter reads 'with the little finger.' No mention is made in the &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>. of this touching of the earth on the part of the Hot<I>ri</I>.</P>
