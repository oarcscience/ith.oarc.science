This (graha) should not be drawn for every one, since this is his (Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a's) self. It should only be drawn for one who is well known, or one who is his (the Adhvaryu's) friend, or one who, being learned in sacred lore, would acquire it by his study.</p>

It should be drawn at a (sacrifice with) a thousand (cows as the priests&#8217; fee); for a thousand is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It should be drawn at (a sacrifice) where the entire property is given away, for the entire property is everything, and this (graha) is everything. It should be drawn at a Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it with all the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>as, for the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it ('all-conquering') is everything, and this (cup) is everything. It should be drawn at a V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya and R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, for that is everything. It should be drawn at a sattra (sacrificial session), for the sattra means everything&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_993"></A><A HREF="#fn_987"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and this (cup) means everything.
