### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:5:1">4:6:5:1</span></span>1. Now
the graha <span id="fr_1008"></span>[2](#fn_1002), forsooth, is he that
burns yonder, since by him all these creatures are held (swayed). Hence
they say, 'We take (grab) the grahas,' 'They walk, seized by the
grahas.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:5:2">4:6:5:2</span></span>2. The
graha, forsooth, is Vâ*k* (speech); for by speech everything is swayed
(grab) here <span id="fr_1009"></span>[3](#fn_1003),--what wonder,
then <span id="fr_1010"></span>[4](#fn_1004), that Vâ*k* is the graha?

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:5:3">4:6:5:3</span></span>3. The
graha, forsooth, is the name, for everything is held (fixed) by a name
here,--what wonder, then, that the name is the graha? We know the names
of many, and are they not thereby held by us <span
id="fr_1011"></span>[5](#fn_1005)?

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:5:4">4:6:5:4</span></span>4. The
graha, forsooth, is food; for by food everything is kept (grah) here:
hence as many as eat our food, all those are kept by us. Such is the
natural order of things.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:5:5">4:6:5:5</span></span>5. And as
to this graha of Soma, that is food; for whatever deity one draws this
graha, that deity, being seized by this graha, fulfils that wish of his
for which he draws it. He approaches either the rising or the setting
sun, thinking, 'Thou art the seizer, seize thou N.N. by such and such a
disease! may N.N. not obtain such and such!' (naming) him whom he hates;
or with, 'May such and such a wish not be fulfilled to him!' and,
assuredly, that wish is not fulfilled to him for whom he thus approaches
(the sun).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1002"></span>[432:2](sbe2674.htm#fr_1008) That is, the
seizer, holder, swayer. According to the St. Petersb. Dict. the word
'graha' probably has not already in this passage the later meaning of
'planet' as the one holding or influencing man; but that of some
demoniac being. The whole Brâhma*n*a is a play on the word 'graha' in
its active and passive meanings of seizer, holder, influence; and
draught, libation. The corresponding Brâhma*n*a of the Kâ*n*va text (V,
7, 1) differs widely from our text. Its general drift is as follows: The
graha is the breath,--the graha of that breath is food,--the graha of
that food is the water,--the graha of that water is fire,--the graha of
the fire (Agni) is the breath,--thus the deities are seized by him, and
he wins a place in the world of the deities.

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[432:3](sbe2674.htm#fr_1009) Perhaps with the
double-entendre, 'everything (libation &c.) is drawn with speech here.'

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[432:4](sbe2674.htm#fr_1010) ? Kimu tad yad
vâg graha*h*. The usual meaning of kim u, 'how much more,' 'still more
so,' seems hardly to suit this passage.

<span id="fn_1005"></span>[432:5](sbe2674.htm#fr_1011) ? Or, 'are not
those of us (that have a name) held (known) thereby?' In either case,
however, the interrogative force of 'atha,' without any other particle,
is rather unusual.
