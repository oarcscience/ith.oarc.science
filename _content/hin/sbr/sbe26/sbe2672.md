### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:3:1">4:6:3:1</span></span>1. Now as
to the manner of animal offerings. One may perform with the (ordinary)
set of eleven victims. He seizes one for Agni as the first victim, and
one for Varu*n*a (as the last); then again one for Agni.: in this way
let him perform with the set of eleven victims <span
id="fr_998"></span>[2](#fn_992).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:3:2">4:6:3:2</span></span>2. Or one
may day after day seize a victim for Indra and Agni; for all the gods
are Agni, since in Agni offering is made to all the deities; and Indra
is the deity of the sacrifice: thus he neither offends any of the
deities, nor does he offend him who is the deity of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:6:3:3">4:6:3:3</span></span>3. Then
as to the manner (of animal offering) in accordance with the Stoma <span
id="fr_999"></span>[3](#fn_993). At the Agnish*t*oma

<span id="page_429">p. 429</span>

let him seize a (victim) for Agni; for it is befitting that at the
Agnish*t*oma ('Agni's praise') he should seize a victim for Agni. If it
be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him seize as the second (victim) one for
Indra and Agni, for the hymns (uktha) <span
id="fr_1000"></span>[1](#fn_994) belong to Indra and Agni. If it be a
Sho*d*a*s*in sacrifice, let him seize as the third (victim) one for
Indra; for the Sho*d*a*s*in (graha) is Indra. If it be an Atirâtra, let
him seize as the fourth (victim) one for Sarasvatî; for Sarasvatî is
Vâ*k* (speech), and Vâ*k* is a female, and so is râtri (fem., 'night')
female. Thus he duly distinguishes between the sacrificial performances.
Such are the three manners (of animal offering): he may perform in
whichever manner he pleases. Two victims must needs be seized,--for
Sûrya he seizes the second en the Vishuvant day, and for Pra*g*âpati at
the Mahâvrata.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_992"></span>[428:2](sbe2672.htm#fr_998) See [III, 9, 1,
5](sbe2636.htm#3:9:1:5) seq. He is to sacrifice one victim each day, and
if after the eleventh day, the performance is to go on (as at the
Dvâda*s*âha), he is to begin anew with the first victim of the
ekâda*s*inî. According to the Kâ*n*va text and Kâty. XII, 6, 17 he is on
such an odd day to immolate all the remaining victims of the set of
eleven. Thus on the last (twelfth) day of the Dvâda*s*âha--the Udayanîya
Atirâtra--he would have to sacrifice the entire set of eleven victims.

<span id="fn_993"></span>[428:3](sbe2672.htm#fr_999) I.e. the particular
form of the *G*yotish*t*oma, which is being performed.

<span id="fn_994"></span>[429:1](sbe2672.htm#fr_1000) That is, the hymns
of the Rig-veda, the single collections of which begin with the hymns to
Agni, followed by those to Indra. The 'ukthâni' here can scarcely refer
to the three additional *s*astras of the Ukthya sacrifice, as they are
composed of hymns to Indra-Varu*n*a, Indra-B*ri*haspati, and
Indra-Vish*n*u respectively. Â*s*v. *S*r. VI, 1; Ait. Br. III, 50. Cp.
[IV, 2, 5, 14](sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:14).
