# FOURTH KÂ*ND*A.

### FIRST ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:1">4:1:1:1</span></span>1. The
Upâ*ms*u (graha), forsooth, is the out-breathing of the Sacrifice <span
id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_600), the Upâ*ms*u-savana (press-stone) the
through-breathing, and the Antaryâma (graha) the in-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:2">4:1:1:2</span></span>2. Now as
to why it is called Upâ*ms*u. There is a graha called A*ms*u <span
id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_601), that is Pra*g*âpati: his out-breathing
is this (graha); and because it is his out-breathing, therefore it is
called Upâ*ms*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:3">4:1:1:3</span></span>3. This
(graha) he draws without a strainer <span
id="fr_604"></span>[3](#fn_602): whereby he puts the out-breathing into
him as one tending away from him, and thus this forward-tending
out-breathing of his streams forth from him. He purifies it with sprigs
of Soma, thinking 'it shall be pure.' He purifies it with six (sprigs),
for there are six seasons: it is by means of the seasons that he thus
purifies it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:4">4:1:1:4</span></span>4. As to
this they say, 'When he purifies the Upâ*ms*u by means of sprigs, and
all (other) Soma-draughts

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

are purified by means of a strainer, whereby, then, do its sprigs become
pure?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:5">4:1:1:5</span></span>5. He
throws them down again (on the unpressed plants) with (Vâ*g*. S. VII,
2), 'What inviolable, quickening name is thine, to that Soma of thine, O
Soma, be Hail!' Thus his sprigs become purified by means of the Svâhâ
('Hail!'). But this graha means everything, for it is the type of all
the pressings <span id="fr_605"></span>[1](#fn_603).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:6">4:1:1:6</span></span>6. Now,
once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an
attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Let us completely establish
the sacrifice: if the Asura-Rakshas should then attack us, our sacrifice
will at least be completely established.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:7">4:1:1:7</span></span>7. Even
at the morning Soma-feast they then completely established the entire
sacrifice <span id="fr_606"></span>[2](#fn_604),--at this same
(upâ*ms*u) graha by means of the Ya*g*us; at the first chant (stotra) by
means of the Sâman; and at the first recitation (*s*astra) by means of
the *Ri*k: with that sacrifice thus completely established they
subsequently worshipped. And in like manner does this sacrifice now
become completely established,--by means of the Ya*g*us at this same
graha; by means of the Sâman at the first chant; and by means of the
*Ri*k at the first recitation; and with this sacrifice thus completely
established he subsequently worships.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:8">4:1:1:8</span></span>8. He
presses (the Soma) eight times; for of eight

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

syllables consists the Gâyatrî, and the morning Soma-feast belongs to
the Gâyatrî; thus this (first turn of pressing) is made to be the
morning Soma-feast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:9">4:1:1:9</span></span>9. He
draws (the juice of the first turn of pressing into the cup) with
(Vâ*g*. S. VII, 1), 'Grow thou pure for Vâ*k*aspati!' for Vâ*k*aspati
(lord of speech) is the out-breathing, and this (Upâ*ms*u) graha is the
out-breathing: hence he says, 'Grow thou pure for
Vâ*k*aspati!'--'purified by the hands with the sprigs of the bull;' for
he purifies it with sprigs of Soma: hence he says, 'with the sprigs of
the bull;' and 'purified by the hands (gabhasti-pûta <span
id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_605)),' he says; for--'gabhasti' being the
same as 'pâni' (hand)--he indeed purifies it with his hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:10">4:1:1:10</span></span>10. He
then presses eleven times; for of eleven syllables consists the
Trish*t*ubh, and the midday Soma-feast belongs to the Trish*t*ubh: thus
this (second turn of pressing) is made to be the midday Soma-feast.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:11">4:1:1:11</span></span>11. He
draws (the juice into the cup) with, 'Grow thou pure, a god, for the
gods--;' for he (Soma) is indeed a god, and for the gods he becomes
pure;--'whose portion thou art;' for he indeed is their portion.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:12">4:1:1:12</span></span>12. He
then presses twelve times; for of twelve syllables consists the
*G*agatî, and the evening Soma-feast belongs to the *G*agatî: thus this
(third turn of pressing) is made to be the evening Soma-feast.

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:13">4:1:1:13</span></span>13. He
draws (the juice) with, 'Make thou our draughts sweet!' whereby he
imbues him (Soma) with sap, and renders him palatable for the gods:
hence, when slain, he does not become putrid <span
id="fr_608"></span>[1](#fn_606). And when he offers (that graha) he
thereby completely establishes him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:14">4:1:1:14</span></span>14.
'For one desirous of spiritual lustre (brahmavar*k*asa) he should press
eight times at each (turn),' so they say;--for of eight syllables
consists the Gâyatrî, and the Gâyatrî is the Brahman: he indeed becomes
endowed with spiritual lustre.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:15">4:1:1:15</span></span>15.
Thus the pressing amounts to twenty-four times (of beating). Now there
are twenty-four half-moons in the year; and Pra*g*âpati (the lord of
creatures) is the year, and the sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati: thus as great
as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, so great he thereby
establishes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:16">4:1:1:16</span></span>16.
'For one desirous of cattle he should press five times at each (turn),'
so they say;--the cattle (animal victims) consist of five parts: he
indeed gains cattle; and there are five seasons in the year; and
Pra*g*âpati is the year, and the sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati thus as great
as the sacrifice is, as great as is its measure, so great he thereby
establishes it. This, however, is mere speculation: it is the other
(manner) which is practised.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:17">4:1:1:17</span></span>17.
Having drawn the graha, he wipes (the vessel) all round, lest any
(Soma-juice) should trickle down. He does not deposit it; for this is
his out-breathing, whence this out-breathing passes unceasingly. Should
he, however, desire to exorcise, he may

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

deposit it <span id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_607) with, 'I put thee down,
the out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus, forsooth, inasmuch as he (the
Adhvaryu) does not quit his hold of it, it is not again in that (enemy);
and thus both the Adhvaryu and the Sacrificer live long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:18">4:1:1:18</span></span>18. Or
he may merely cover (the vessel by his hand) with, 'I shut thee off, the
out-breathing of N.N.!' Thus, forsooth, inasmuch as he does not deposit
it, it is not again in that enemy; and thus he does not disorder the
vital airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:19">4:1:1:19</span></span>19.
While he is still inside (the Havirdhâna) he utters 'Hail!' For the gods
were afraid lest the Asura-Rakshas should destroy what part of this
graha was previous to the offering. They offered it (symbolically) by
means of the Svâhâ, while they were still inside (the cart-shed), and
what was thus offered they afterwards offered up in the fire. And in
like manner does he now offer it up by means of the Svâhâ, while he is
still inside, and what has thus been offered he afterwards offers up in
the fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:20">4:1:1:20</span></span>20. He
then walks out (of the Havirdhâna) with, 'I walk along the wide
air <span id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_608).' For along the air

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

the Rakshas roams rootless and unfettered on both sides, even as man
here roams along the air, rootless and unfettered on both sides <span
id="fr_611"></span>[1](#fn_609); and, that formula being the Brahman
(prayer), a slayer of the Rakshas, he, by means of that Brahman, renders
the air free from danger and injury.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:21">4:1:1:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon he (the Sacrificer) asks a boon. For the gods, forsooth,
greatly desire to obtain the offering of that graha, and they grant to
him that boon, in order that he may forthwith offer that graha to them:
this is why he asks a boon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:22">4:1:1:22</span></span>22. He
(the Adhvaryu) offers with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 3), 'Self-made thou art,'
for, this graha being his (Ya*gñ*a's) out-breathing, it is indeed made
by itself, born of itself <span id="fr_612"></span>[2](#fn_610): hence
he says, 'Self-made thou art;'--'for all powers, divine and
earthly,'--for it is born of itself for all creatures <span
id="fr_613"></span>[3](#fn_611);--'May the mind obtain thee!'--the mind
being Pra*g*âpati, he thereby means to say, 'may Pra*g*âpati obtain
thee!' 'Hail! thee, O well-born, for Sûrya!' thus he utters the
second <span id="fr_614"></span>[4](#fn_612)

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (or inferior)
'Hail!' with regard to a subsequent <span
id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_613) (or higher; the highest) deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:23">4:1:1:23</span></span>23. Now
it is in him that burns yonder (the sun) that he has just offered that
(libation); and the latter is the All: hence he makes that (sun) the
highest of the All. But were he to utter the second (or higher) 'Hail!'
with regard to a preceding (or lower) deity <span
id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_614), then it would be even higher than
yonder sun: therefore he utters the second 'Hail!' with regard to a
subsequent deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:24">4:1:1:24</span></span>24.
And, having offered, he wipes the (vessel of the) graha upwards; whereby
he puts that out-breathing into him as one tending away from him.
Thereupon he rubs (the wiped-off Soma) upon the middle enclosing stick
from west to east with the palm of his hand turned upwards <span
id="fr_617"></span>[3](#fn_615)--whereby he puts that out-breathing into
him as one tending away from him--with, 'Thee to the gods sipping motes
of light!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:25">4:1:1:25</span></span>25. For
in that orb which burns yonder he has just offered this (libation), and
those rays thereof are the gods sipping motes of light: it is these he
thereby gratifies; and thus gratified those gods convey him to the
heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:26">4:1:1:26</span></span>26. For
this same graha there is neither an invitatory prayer nor an offering
prayer <span id="fr_618"></span>[4](#fn_616): he offers it

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

with a (Ya*g*us) formula, and thereby it becomes for him supplied with
both an invitatory and an offering prayer. And if he desire to exorcise,
let him offer some spray (of Soma) which may adhere either to his arm,
or to his breast, or to his garment, with, 'O divine plant, let that be
true wherefore I pray thee: let N.N. be struck down by destruction
falling from above, crash!' Even as one of (enemies) that are being
slain might escape, so does this (sprig) fly away from those that are
being pressed: thus nothing (hostile)--either running thither or running
away <span id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_617)--remains to him for whom he
performs this. He deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee for the
out-breathing!' for this (graha) indeed is his out-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:27">4:1:1:27</span></span>27. Now
some deposit it on the south part (of the khara <span
id="fr_620"></span>[2](#fn_618)), for, they say, it is in that direction
that

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

yonder (sun) moves. Let him, however, not do this, but let him deposit
it on the north (uttara) part (of the khara), because there is not any
higher (uttara) graha than this. He deposits it with, 'Thee for the
out-breathing!' for this (graha) is indeed his out-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:1:28">4:1:1:28</span></span>28. He
then takes the Upâ*ms*u-savana (pressing-stone). He neither touches it
with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth, for that would be like
rinsing it in water. If there be any spray adhering to it, let him
remove it with his hand, and then lay down (the stone) beside (the
Upâ*ms*u cup), with the face towards the north, with, 'Thee for the
through-breathing!' for this (stone) is indeed his (Ya*gñ*a's)
through-breathing.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_600"></span>[248:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_602) That is, the
sacrificial man, or the sacrifice personified in Soma and the
sacrificer.

<span id="fn_601"></span>[248:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_603) Lit. 'the
Soma-plant,' hence the (Soma)-sacrifice itself, or Pra*g*âpati. See [IV,
6, 1, 1](sbe2670.htm#4:6:1:1) seq.

<span id="fn_602"></span>[248:3](sbe2640.htm#fr_604) Bahishpavitrât,
lit. from (a vessel, or Soma) having the strainer outside (away from)
it. While no proper strainer is used for the Upâ*ms*u-graha, the
Soma-juice being poured through Soma-plants (see [p.
244](sbe2639.htm#page_244), note [2](sbe2639.htm#fn_596)); at the great
pressing it is passed through a fringed straining-cloth (da*s*âpavitra)
spread over the Dro*n*akala*s*a (the largest of the three Soma-troughs,
the others being the Âdhavanîya and Pûtabh*ri*t). See [IV, 1, 2,
3](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2:3).

<span id="fn_603"></span>[249:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_605) Viz. inasmuch as
the Upâ*ms*u-graha is obtained by three turns of pressing, and each of
the three Savanas (pressings, Soma-feasts) consists of three rounds of
pressing of three turns each. See [p. 256](#page_256), note
[1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).

<span id="fn_604"></span>[249:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_606) Cf. Taitt. S. VI,
4, 5, where this theory (divested of its legendary form) is ascribed to
Aru*n*a Aupave*s*i.

<span id="fn_605"></span>[250:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_607) Sâya*n*a, on Taitt.
S. I, 4, 2, interprets it, 'Having been purified by the ray of the sun
(while growing in the forest), do thou now become pure for the gods
through the sprigs of the bull!' Cf., however, Taitt. S. VI, 4, 5,
'gabhastinâ hy enam pavayati,' where 'gabhasti' would seem to be taken
in the sense of hand' (? the forked one). See [p.
244](sbe2639.htm#page_244), note [2](sbe2639.htm#fn_596).

<span id="fn_606"></span>[251:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_608) The Kâ*n*va text
adds, 'while whosoever else is slain becomes putrid.'

<span id="fn_607"></span>[252:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_609) That is, he may set
it down on the khara for a moment without quitting his hold of it. While
the subsequent cups of Soma are deposited in their respective places
after they have been drawn, the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma are offered
immediately.

<span id="fn_608"></span>[252:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_610) With the
Taittirîyas the order of proceeding is somewhat different: The Adhvaryu
pours the Soma through the Soma-plants into the Upâ*ms*u cup after each
turn of pressing, with, 'Become pure for Vâ*k*aspati, O courser!'--'The
bull purified by the hand with the plants of the bull!'--'Thou, a god,
art a purifier of the gods whose share thou art: thee, to them!'
respectively. He then takes the cup from the Pratiprasthât*ri* with,
'Thou art self-made' eyes it with, 'Make our drinks sweet;' and wipes it
clean upwards with, 'Thee for all powers, divine and earthly!' He then
rises with, 'May the mind obtain thee!' steps to the Âhavanîya with, 'I
move <span id="page_253">p. 253</span> along the wide air,' and offers,
while the sacrificer holds on to him from behind, with, 'Hail! thee, O
well-born, to Sûrya!'

<span id="fn_609"></span>[253:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_611) See [III, 1, 3,
13](sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:13).

<span id="fn_610"></span>[253:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_612) 'For this libation
is the out-breathing, and the out-breathing is he that blows yonder (the
wind); and he indeed is made by himself, begotten (*g*âta) of himself,
since there is no other maker nor begetter of him.' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[253:3](sbe2640.htm#fr_613) Perhaps we ought to
translate the passage, 'from all the powers, divine and earthly,' for it
is born by itself from all the creatures. But cf. Taitt. S. VI, 4, 5:
'Thereby he puts out-breathing both into gods and men.'

<span id="fn_612"></span>[253:4](sbe2640.htm#fr_614) While, in its force
of 'subsequent,' avara here refers back to the first Svâhâ, pronounced
by the Adhvaryu ([par. 19](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1:19)); it also has here the
meaning of 'lower,' and, developed out of this, that of 'preceding' (in
which meaning it occurs in the *Ri*kprâti*s*âkhya). Hence it is quite
impossible adequately to render this play on the words avara,
'subsequent, lower, preceding,' and para, 'higher, subsequent.'

<span id="fn_613"></span>[254:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_615) That is, coming
after Svâhâ in the formula.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[254:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_616) The Kâ*n*va text
reads: etasmin vâ etan ma*nd*ale ’haushîd ya esha tapati; sarvam u vâ
esha graha*h*; sarvasmâd evaitad asmâd enam uttara*m* karoti ya esho
’smât sarvasmâd uttaro yad dhâvarâ*m* devatâ*m* kuryât para*m*
svâhâkâram anyad dhaitasmâd uttara*m* kuryât.

<span id="fn_615"></span>[254:3](sbe2640.htm#fr_617) That is to say, he
is to pass his hand, palm upwards, under the middle enclosing stick.

<span id="fn_616"></span>[254:4](sbe2640.htm#fr_618) Such (*Ri*k verses)
as are ordinarily recited by the Hot*ri*: When <span id="page_255">p.
255</span> the Upâ*ms*u cup is drawn, the Hot*ri* says, 'Restrain the
out-breathing (prâ*n*a)! Hail! thee, O well-calling one, to Sûrya!'
whereupon he breathes into (or towards) the cup with, 'O out-breathing,
restrain my out-breathing!' After that he remains silent till the
Antaryâma is drawn, when he addresses that graha with, 'Restrain the
in-breathing (apâna)! Hail! thee, O well-calling one, to Sûrya!'
whereupon he draws in his breath over the cup, and says, 'O
in-breathing, restrain my in-breathing!' He then touches the
pressing-stone with, 'Thee to the through-breathing!' and therewith
frees his speech from restraint. Ait. Br. II, 21. On the terms
out-breathing (prâ*n*a) and in-breathing (apâna, or up-breathing, udâna)
see part i, p. 19, note 2; J. S. Speijer, Jâtakarma, p. 64; Sâya*n*a on
Taitt. S. I, 4, 3 (vol. i, p.603); Taitt. S. VI, 4: 6. Different Haug,
Ait. Br. Transl. p. 118.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[255:1](sbe2640.htm#fr_619) 'Na dhâvan
nâpadhâvat pari*s*ishyate;' perhaps we ought to read 'nâpadhâvan;'
unless indeed 'tasya' refers to Soma, as Sâya*n*a seems to take it. The
Kâ*n*va text has: tathâ ha teshâ*m* nâpadhâva*ñ*s *k*ana mu*k*yate
yebhyas tathâ karoti.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[255:2](sbe2640.htm#fr_620) According to the
Sûtras of the Black Ya*g*us (cf. Sâya*n*a on Taitt. S. I, 4, 2, p. 598),
the Upâ*ms*u cup is 'deposited' on the south-east and the Antaryâma cup
on the north-east corner of the <span id="page_256">p. 256</span> khara
or mound; the Upâ*ms*u-savana stone being placed between them. Before
depositing the vessel, the Adhvaryu pours some of the residue of
Soma-juice from the Upâ*ms*u cup into the Âgraya*n*asthâlî, and having
put a large twig of Soma into it for the evening pressing (? the Adâbhya
graha, cf. Sây. on Taitt. S. I, 603), he deposits it on the mound.
