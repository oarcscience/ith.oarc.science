When he performs a twelve days&#8217; sacrifice with transposed metres (Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha vy&ucirc;<I>dh</I>a<I>kh</I>andas), then he (the Adhvaryu) transposes the grahas (cups of Soma); and both the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> and the Hot<I>ri</I> transpose the metres. Now there is first that normal Tryaha (triduum), with settled metres&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: there he draws the cup beginning with the Aindrav&acirc;yava.</p>

There he draws the cups beginning with the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a,--for that fourth day is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's own; and the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a is the self, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the self: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a.</p>

They sit near holding that (cup)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_978"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and (the Adhvaryu) draws (the other) cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that cup (in the order of performance comes), he utters 'Hi<I>m</I>' and deposits it. Then follows that normal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_979"></A><A HREF="#fn_973"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> fifth day; on that he draws the cups beginning with the Aindrav&acirc;yava.</p>

There he draws the cups beginning with the <I>S</I>ukra; for that sixth day is Indra's own, and the <I>S</I>ukra (bright, clear) is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed is Indra: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the <I>S</I>ukra.</p>

There he draws the cups beginning with the <I>S</I>ukra cup; for that seventh day belongs to the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; ('great' metre); for the <I>S</I>ukra is he that burns yonder, and he indeed is great: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the <I>S</I>ukra.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:9:8">4:5:9:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then, on the ninth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a; for that ninth day belongs to the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; (metre), and the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a is the self, and the self (soul) is this whole world (<I>g</I>agat): therefore he draws the cups beginning with the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_421"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 421</FONT></A></p>

What, then, is the Adhvaryu to do in that case, when both the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> and Hot<I>ri</I> transpose (change) the metres&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_981"></A><A HREF="#fn_975"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>? In that, at the morning pressing, he draws first the Aindrav&acirc;yava cup; and at the midday pressing the <I>S</I>ukra cup; and at the evening pressing the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a cup,--thereby forsooth the Adhvaryu transposes (the cups).</p>

Hence, having drawn the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u and Antary&acirc;ma cups (<a href="sbe2640.htm#4:1:1">IV, 1, 1</A> and <a href="sbe2641.htm#4:1:2">2</A>), which must always be drawn first, he draws the Aindrav&acirc;yava cup (<a href="sbe2642.htm#4:1:3">IV, 1, 3</A>) and so on. The same order is preserved on the fifth, eighth, and last three days. On the fourth and ninth days, on the other hand, he follows up the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u and Antary&acirc;ma by the grahas of the third pressing, beginning with the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a (<a href="sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:21">IV, 3, 5, 21</A> seq.); these being then succeeded by those of the morning and midday pressings; and on the sixth and seventh days the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u and Antary&acirc;ma cups are succeeded by the grahas of the midday pressing, beginning with the <I>S</I>ukra cup (<a href="sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:2">IV, 3, 3, 2</A>). This change of the proper order of performance, of course, involves a different arrangement of the stotras and <I>s</I>astras (or 'the metres,' as they are called in the texts). This dislocation of the three pressings is afterwards to be rectified by the various cups being 'deposited' on the khara in their normal order. In the <a href="sbe2668.htm#4:5:9:12">last two paragraphs</A> of the present Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a the author, however, <A NAME="page_419"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 419</FONT></A> discountenances this practice of changing the natural order of drawing the cups.</P>
