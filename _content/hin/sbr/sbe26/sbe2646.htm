The &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a graha, forsooth, is his self (body, trunk), and as such it is his all; for this self is one's all. Therefore he draws it by means of this (earth), for of her is the bowl&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and with a bowl he draws this (libation); and this (earth) is all, as this</p>

<p><A NAME="page_289"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 289</FONT></A></p>  
<p>graha is all: hence he takes it by means of this (earth).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:2">4:2:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. He draws it full; for the 'full' means all, and this graha is all: therefore he draws it full.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:3">4:2:2:3</A></FONT></span>3: He draws it for the All-gods; for the All-gods are all, and this graha is all: therefore he draws it for the All-gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:4">4:2:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. He draws it at all (three) Soma feasts; for the (three) feasts mean all, and this graha is all: therefore he draws it at all the feasts.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:5">4:2:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. And if the king (Soma) become exhausted, they extend him from out of that (bowl), make him issue therefrom; for the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a is the body, and from the body all these limbs issue. Therefrom they draw at the end the H&acirc;riyo<I>g</I>ana cup&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_699"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: whereby the sacrifice is established at the end in this resting-place, the body (or its own self).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:6">4:2:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Then as to why it is called &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a. His speech which he restrains, on taking up that press-stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_700"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, spoke out again first at this (libation); and because it spoke out first (agre) at this (libation), therefore this is called the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_699"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:7">4:2:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. It was from fear of the evil spirits that (the gods) restrained their speech. Previously to this he draws six grahas, and this is the seventh: for there are six seasons in the year, and the year is all.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:8">4:2:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. And all being conquered and free from danger and injury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, the gods now first uttered speech; and</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_290"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 290</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in like manner does he first utter speech now that everything is conquered and free from danger and injury.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:9">4:2:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. He now draws it from that (stream of Soma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 19; Rig-veda I, 139, 11), <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>Ye Gods, who are eleven in heaven, who are eleven on earth, and who are eleven dwelling in glory in the (aerial) waters: do ye graciously accept this sacrifice!--Thou art taken with a support: thou art &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a, a good firstling (sv-&acirc;graya<I>n</I>a)!' Hereby he makes that speech of renewed vigour; whence he speaks therewith in a different way, while yet the same, in order to avoid sameness; for were he to take it with, 'Thou art &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a, thou art &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a,' he would commit (the fault of) sameness: therefore he says, 'Thou art &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a, a good &acirc;graya<I>n</I>a.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:10">4:2:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. 'Guard the sacrifice! guard the lord of the sacrifice!' whereby he utters freed speech, meaning to say, 'Protect the sacrifice! protect the sacrificer!' for the lord of the sacrifice is the sacrificer. 'May Vish<I>n</I>u-guard thee with his might! guard thou Vish<I>n</I>u!' whereby he utters freed speech--Vish<I>n</I>u being the sacrifice--'May the sacrifice</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_291"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 291</FONT></A></p>  
<p>protect thee with its power! protect thou the sacrifice!'--'Guard thou the Soma feasts all around!' whereby he means this very graha, because that belongs to all (three) Soma feasts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:11">4:2:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. Having then wrapped up (the bowl in) a fringed filtering-cloth, he utters 'Hi&#7749;!' Now that same speech (V&acirc;<I>k</I>, fem.), being unsupported, lay exhausted. By means of the 'Hi&#7749;' the gods infused breath into that exhausted speech, for the 'Hi&#7749;' is breath, the 'Hi&#7749;' is indeed breath: hence one cannot utter the sound 'hi&#7749;' after closing his nostrils. By means of that breath she rose again, for when one who is exhausted takes breath, he rises again. And in like manner does he now infuse breath into the exhausted speech by means of the 'Hi&#7749;,' and through. that breath she rises again. Thrice he utters the 'Hi&#7749;,' for threefold is the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:12">4:2:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. He then says (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 21), 'Soma becometh pure!' For that (speech) which, for fear of the Asura-Rakshas, they (the gods) did not utter, he now utters and reveals when all is conquered and free from danger and injury: therefore he says, 'Soma becometh pure.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:13">4:2:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. 'For this priesthood, for this nobility'--whereby he means to say, 'for the priesthood as well as for the nobility for the Soma-pressing sacrificer he becometh pure;' whereby he means to say, 'for the sacrificer.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:14">4:2:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. Here now they say, 'Having said this much, let him deposit (the cup); for as much as the priesthood, and the nobility, and the people are, so much</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_292"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 292</FONT></A></p>  
<p>means this All, since Indra and Agni are this All&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: hence, having said this much, let him deposit (the cup).'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:15">4:2:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. Let him, nevertheless, say this more, 'For sap and pith he becometh pure,'--by saying 'for sap' he means to say 'for rain;' and 'for pith' he says with a view to that pith or juice which springs from rain;--'for the waters and plants he becometh pure,' this he says for the waters and plants;--'for heaven and earth he becometh pure,' this he says for those two, heaven and earth, whereon this All rests;--'for well-being he becometh pure,' whereby he means to say 'for good.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:2:16">4:2:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. Here now some say, 'for spiritual lustre he becometh pure;' but let him not say so, for in saying 'for this priesthood,' he says it with a view to spiritual lustre. With, 'Thee for the All-gods! this is thy womb: thee for the All-gods!' he deposits (the cup); for it is for the All-gods that he draws it. He deposits it in the middle (of the mound); for this is his trunk, and that trunk is, as it were, in the middle. On the right (south) side of it is the Ukthya bowl, and on the left side the &Acirc;ditya bowl.</p>
