One may perform with the (ordinary) set of eleven victims. He seizes one for Agni as the first victim, and one for Varu<I>n</I>a (as the last); then again one for Agni.: in this way let him perform with the set of eleven victims&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_998"></A><A HREF="#fn_992"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

Or one may day after day seize a victim for Indra and Agni; for all the gods are Agni, since in Agni offering is made to all the deities; and Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: thus he neither offends any of the deities, nor does he offend him who is the deity of the sacrifice.</p>

<p>let him seize a (victim) for Agni; for it is befitting that at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma ('Agni's praise') he should seize a victim for Agni. If it be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him seize as the second (victim) one for Indra and Agni, for the hymns (uktha)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1000"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> belong to Indra and Agni. If it be a Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in sacrifice, let him seize as the third (victim) one for Indra; for the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in (graha) is Indra. If it be an Atir&acirc;tra, let him seize as the fourth (victim) one for Sarasvat&icirc;; for Sarasvat&icirc; is V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech), and V&acirc;<I>k</I> is a female, and so is r&acirc;tri (fem., 'night') female. Thus he duly distinguishes between the sacrificial performances. Such are the three manners (of animal offering): he may perform in whichever manner he pleases. Two victims must needs be seized,--for S&ucirc;rya he seizes the second en the Vishuvant day, and for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati at the Mah&acirc;vrata.</p>

He is to sacrifice one victim each day, and if after the eleventh day, the performance is to go on (as at the Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha), he is to begin anew with the first victim of the ek&acirc;da<I>s</I>in&icirc;. According to the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text and K&acirc;ty. XII, 6, 17 he is on such an odd day to immolate all the remaining victims of the set of eleven. Thus on the last (twelfth) day of the Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha--the Udayan&icirc;ya Atir&acirc;tra--he would have to sacrifice the entire set of eleven victims.</P>
