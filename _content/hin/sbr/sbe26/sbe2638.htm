<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:2">3:9:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. He (the Adhvaryu) takes down the king (Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now this (earth) is a safe resting-place, and the birth-place of living beings; it is to this safe resting-place that he now takes him down; he spreads him thereon, produces him therefrom.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:3">3:9:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. He takes him down between the shafts; for the cart is (a means of) the sacrifice, and thus alone he does not put him outside the sacrifice. He puts him on the pressing stones lying there with their heads (mukha, mouths)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> towards each other; for Soma is the nobility, and the stones are the clans (people); he thereby raises the nobility over the clan. And as to why they are lying with their heads together,--he thereby makes the clan of one head (or mouth) with, and uncontentious towards, the nobles; therefore they are lying with their heads towards each other.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:4">3:9:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. He takes (Soma) down, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 25), 'Thee for the heart, thee for the mind!' This he says for the (accomplishment of the) sacrificer's wish, since it is with the heart and mind that the sacrificer entertains the wish for which he sacrifices; therefore he says, 'Thee for the heart, thee for the mind!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:5">3:9:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. 'Thee for the sky, thee for the sun!' This, on the other hand, he says with a view to the world of the gods. When he says, 'Thee for the sky, thee</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_228"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 228</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for the sun,' he means to say, 'Thee for the gods!' 'Upwards convey thou to the sky, to the gods, this cult, these invocations!' Cult, doubtless, means sacrifice: he thereby means to say, 'Upwards carry thou this sacrifice to the sky, to the gods!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:6">3:9:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. [V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 26], 'O Soma, king, descend unto all thy people!' whereby he brings him down for the lordship, for the sovereignty of these people (creatures).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:7">3:9:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. Having quitted his hold (of Soma) he sits down by him, with, 'May all thy people descend to thee.' Now, in saying, 'Descend unto all thy people,' he does what is unseemly, for Soma being the nobility, he thereby, as it were, confounds good and bad&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_570"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--and, indeed, in consequence thereof, people now confound good and bad. But in this (formula) he does what is right and according to order,--in saying, 'May all thy people descend to thee,' he makes all his subjects go down (on their knees) before him; and hence when a noble approaches, all these subjects, the people, go down before him, crouch down by him on the ground&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Sitting near (Soma), the Hot<I>ri</I> is about to recite the morning-prayer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:8">3:9:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then, while putting a kindling-stick (on the fire), he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Recite to the gods</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_229"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 229</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the early-coming!' Now the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres; and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite) to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:9">3:9:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. And so some say, 'Recite to the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_572"></A><A HREF="#fn_570"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' But let him not say so; for the early-coming gods are the metres, as the after-offerings are the metres, and the after-offerings are performed with, 'Prompt--to the gods! Recite (the offering-prayer) to the gods!' therefore let him say, 'Recite to the gods, the early-coming!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:10">3:9:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. And when he puts on a kindling-stick, it is the metres he thereby kindles. And when the Hot<I>ri</I> recites the morning-prayer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_573"></A><A HREF="#fn_571"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he thereby</p>

<p><A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A></p>  
<p>again strengthens the metres, makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; for the metres had their vigour impaired by the gods, since it was through the metres that the gods reached the heavenly worlds; they neither sing praises (chants) nor recite (<I>s</I>astras) here. Hereby he now again strengthens the metres and makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; and by means of them, thus unimpaired in vigour, they</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_231"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 231</FONT></A></p>  
<p>perform the sacrifice; this is why the Hot<I>ri</I> recites the morning-prayer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:11">3:9:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Here now they say, 'What is the (Adhvaryu's) response to the morning-prayer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_574"></A><A HREF="#fn_572"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>?' The Adhvaryu should wait through (the prayer) waking, and when he blinks, this is his response. But let him not do this; if he fall asleep (again) he may as well sleep. When the Hot<I>ri</I> brings his morning-prayer to a close&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--there is an offering-spoon called Pra<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>&icirc;,--having therein taken ghee in four ladlings, he (the Adhvaryu) offers it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:12">3:9:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. For when the head of Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (the sacrifice) was struck off, his sap, running, entered the waters; that (sap) he fetched yesterday with the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water; and he now goes for what sap of the sacrifice remains therein.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:13">3:9:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. And when he offers that offering, he pours out (the ghee) towards that same sap of the sacrifice (in the water) and draws it to him. And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that offering, and thus satisfied and pleased, they fit that sap of the sacrifice together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:14">3:9:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. He offers with, 'May Agni, with his flame, hear my prayer;' whereby he means to say, 'May he hear this prayer of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;'--'May the waters and the Soma-bowls hear, the divine!' whereby he means to say, 'May the waters hear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe it to me.'--'Hear me, ye stones,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_232"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 232</FONT></A></p>  
<p>as knowing the sacrifice!' whereby he means to say, 'May the (pressing) stones hear this (prayer) of mine, may they vouchsafe it to me;' and 'as knowing the sacrifice,' he says, because the stones are indeed knowing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. 'May the divine Savit<I>ri</I> hear my prayer, Hail!' whereby he means to say, 'May the divine Savit<I>ri</I> hear this (prayer) of mine, may he vouchsafe it to me;' for Savit<I>ri</I> is the impeller of the gods; impelled by him he goes for that sap of the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:15">3:9:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. Having then a second time taken ghee by four ladlings, he says, while going forth towards the north, 'Summon the waters!' whereby he means to say, 'Desire the waters, O Hotar!' The reason why the Hot<I>ri</I> then recites&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is this: by that</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_233"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 233</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (oblation) he (the Adhvaryu) pours out (the ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice (in the water), and draws it to him; and he (the Hot<I>ri</I>) then stands by those (Ekadhana pitchers) lest the evil spirits should injure them on the way.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:16">3:9:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. He (the Adhvaryu) then gives directions, 'Come hither, cup-bearer of the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a! Nesh<I>t</I>ar, lead up the wives! Ye bearers of the Ekadhana (cups), come hither! Agn&icirc;dh, step ever against the pit with the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water and the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup!' this is a composite direction.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:17">3:9:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. They walk northwards out (of the sacrificial ground)--by the back of the pit and the front side of the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra; whereupon they proceed in the direction in which the water is. They go thither together with the wives. The reason why they go thither with the wives is this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:18">3:9:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. When the head of the sacrifice was struck off, its sap, running, entered the waters; those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:19">3:9:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. The gods then said, 'Those Gandharvas, surely, are a great danger to us here, how can we carry off the sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury?'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:20">3:9:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. They said, 'Well, the Gandharvas are fond of women; let us go together with the wives! The Gandharvas, surely, will hanker after the wives, and we shall carry off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:21">3:9:3:21</A></FONT></span>21. They went with the wives; the Gandharvas did indeed hanker after the wives, and they (the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A></p>  
<p>gods) carried off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:22">3:9:3:22</A></FONT></span>22. And so does that (Adhvaryu) now go (to the water) with the wives; the Gandharvas hanker after the wives, and he carries off that sap of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and injury.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:23">3:9:3:23</A></FONT></span>23. He offers (the ghee) upon the water; for that sap of the sacrifice, indeed, draws near to that oblation, when offered; it rises (to the surface) to meet it; and having thus brought it to light, he seizes it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:24">3:9:3:24</A></FONT></span>24. And again why he offers this oblation: he thereby pours out (ghee) towards that sap of the sacrifice, and draws it to him, and craves it of the waters. And, indeed, he pleases those deities to whom he offers that oblation, and thus satisfied and pleased they fit that sap of the sacrifice together for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:25">3:9:3:25</A></FONT></span>25. He offers with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 27), 'Ye divine waters,--the son of waters;' the waters are indeed divine, hence he says, 'Ye divine waters,--the son of waters;' 'That wave of yours, suitable for offering;' whereby he means to say, 'That wave of yours which is suitable for the sacrifice;' 'Mighty, most grateful;' by 'mighty' he means to say 'powerful,' and by 'most grateful' he means to say 'most sweet;' 'Give ye that unto those gods among the gods,' in saying this he has craved it of them; 'The drinkers of the pure (Soma);' the pure, doubtless, is the truth; in saying, 'the drinkers (pa) of the pure,' he means to say, 'the defenders (pa) of the truth;' 'Whose portion ye are, Hail!' for this indeed is their portion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:26">3:9:3:26</A></FONT></span>26. Thereupon he makes that oblation (ghee) float away by means of the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's cup, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 28), 'Thou art furrowing!' Even</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A></p>  
<p>as a coal is consumed by Fire, so is that oblation consumed by that deity. Now that water, which is in the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's cup, he will have to pour on the king (Soma); and ghee being a thunderbolt, and Soma seed, he makes (the ghee) float away lest he should injure that seed, Soma, by that thunderbolt, the ghee.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:27">3:9:3:27</A></FONT></span>27. He then takes (water) with, 'I draw thee up for the imperishableness of the ocean;' for the ocean is water; he thus confers imperishableness upon the waters; wherefore, in spite of so much food (and drink) being consumed, the waters are not diminished. Thereupon they draw (water in) the Ekadhana pitchers, and thereupon the vessels for washing the feet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:28">3:9:3:28</A></FONT></span>28. The reason why he takes (water) with the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's cup is this. When the sacrifice escaped from the gods, the gods endeavoured to call it up by means of (sacrificial) calls (praisha)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; by means of the puroru<I>k</I> ('shining before') formulas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> they pleased it (pra-ro<I>k</I>aya), and by the nivids they made (their wishes) known (ni-vid) to it. Therefore he takes (water) with the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's cup.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:29">3:9:3:29</A></FONT></span>29. They come back. The Agn&icirc;dh takes up his position opposite to the pit with the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water and the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup. Close over the pit he</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (the Adhvaryu) makes the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water and the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's cup touch one another, with, 'Water hath united with water, plants with plants!' the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day, both kinds he thereby mixes together.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:30">3:9:3:30</A></FONT></span>30. Now some indeed pour (some of) the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water into the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's cup, and from the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's cup (back) to the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water, arguing, 'Thereby we mix together both the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day.' But let him not do this; for when he pours (the water) together into the &Acirc;dhavan&icirc;ya trough&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then both kinds of sap are mixed together. Thereupon he pours the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water into the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup for the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And as to why he makes them touch one another close over the pit, it was from thence, forsooth, that the gods rose to heaven; he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:31">3:9:3:31</A></FONT></span>31. They return (to the Havirdh&acirc;na). The Hot<I>ri</I> asks him, 'Adhvaryu, hast thou gained the waters?' whereby he means to say, 'Hast thou obtained the waters?' He replies to him, 'Yea, they have yielded themselves!' whereby he means to say, 'I have obtained them and they have yielded to me.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:32">3:9:3:32</A></FONT></span>32. And if it be an Agnish<I>t</I>oma, and there be left a residue (of ghee poured together) in the pra<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>&icirc;</p>

<p><A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A></p>  
<p>spoon sufficient for an oblation, let him offer that. But if it be not sufficient for an oblation, he takes another portion of ghee in four ladlings and offers it, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 29; Rig-veda I, 27, 7), 'Whatever mortal thou favourest in battles, whomsoever thou speedest in the race, he winneth unfailing strength, Hail!' He offers with (a prayer) to Agni, because the Agnish<I>t</I>oma ('Agni's praise') means Agni; thus he establishes the Agnish<I>t</I>oma in Agni. [He offers] with (a verse) containing the word 'mortal,' because the Agnish<I>t</I>oma is of the same measure as man. Let hire then offer in this manner, if it be an Agnish<I>t</I>oma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:33">3:9:3:33</A></FONT></span>33. And if it be an Ukthya, let him touch the middle enclosing-stick,--there are three enclosing-sticks and three recitations (uktha)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_584"></A><A HREF="#fn_582"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and by means of them the sacrifice is there established. And if it be either an Atir&acirc;tra or a Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_585"></A><A HREF="#fn_583"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, let him neither make an oblation nor touch the middle enclosing-stick; having merely muttered (the above verse), let him silently betake himself (to the Havirdh&acirc;na) and enter it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_584"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. In this way he duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice from one another.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:3:34">3:9:3:34</A></FONT></span>34.

And, moreover, that which remains over for the sacrificer's prosperity is the common property (sa-dhana) of these (others); and because it is the common property of these, therefore they are called Ekadhana (having one as their common property).</p>

S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, to our passage, explains it by 'mixing the bad with the good (or better).' The literal translation is 'a bad-bettering.'

<P><A NAME="fn_570"></A><A HREF="sbe2638.htm#fr_572">229:1</A> Here now, some say only, 'Recite to the early-coming!' not 'to the . . . gods!' but let him not say this. K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_571"></A><A HREF="sbe2638.htm#fr_573">229:2</A> The Pr&acirc;tar-anuv&acirc;ka, or morning-prayer (matin chant), has to be recited by the Hot<I>ri</I> in the latter part of the night before any sound (of birds, &amp;c.) is to be heard. It may begin immediately after midnight, and conclude as soon as daylight appears. When called upon by the Adhvaryu to recite the morning-prayer, the Hot<I>ri</I> first makes an oblation of ghee on the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra fire, with the mantra, 'Protect me from the spell of the mouth, from every imprecation, Hail!' and then two oblations on the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya with appropriate mantras. Thereupon he betakes himself to the Havirdh&acirc;na (cart-shed), in entering which, by the east door, he touches successively the front-wreath (rar&acirc;<I>t</I>&acirc;, cf. <a href="sbe2621.htm#3:5:3:9">III, 5, 3, 9</A>) and the doorposts, with formulas. He then squats down between the yoke-pieces of the two Soma-carts, and begins his recitation with Rig-veda X, 30, 12, 'Ye, O wealthy waters, verily possess good things; ye confer desirable energy and immortality; ye command riches with abundant offspring: may Sarasvat&icirc; (the river S., and Speech) bestow on the bard that vital vigour!' The 'early-coming' deities to whom the recitation is successively addressed, are Agni, Ushas (the dawn), and the two A<I>s</I>vins (the precursors of the sun); the prayer thus consisting of three sections, termed kratu (Agnikratu <A NAME="page_230"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 230</FONT></A>, &amp;c.). The hymns and detached verses making up these sections are arranged according to the seven metres (thus forming seven sub-sections of each), viz. g&acirc;yatr&icirc;, anush<I>t</I>ubh, trish<I>t</I>ubh, b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;, ush<I>n</I>ih, <I>g</I>agat&icirc;, and pa&#7749;kti. The prayer may consist of as many verses as can be recited between midnight and daybreak; but there should be at least one hymn in each of the seven metres to each of the three deities; nor should the recitation consist of less than a hundred verses. From the beginning of the recitation up to the end of the last hymn but one, Rig-veda I, 112, there is to be a gradual modulation of the voice so as to pass upwards through the seven tones (yama) of the deep scale (mandrasvara). Moreover, that hymn is to be repeated (if necessary) till daylight appears. As soon as this is the case, he passes on without any break from the last (25th) verse to the last hymn (v. 75, 1-9), which he intones in the lowest tone of the middle scale, after shifting his place further east towards the gate. The recitation of the first eight verses of this hymn again gradually ascends through the whole of the middle scale; when--after once more shifting his place so as to be seated between the two door-posts--he intones the last verse--'The Dawn hath appeared with her shining kine, Agni hath been kindled at his appointed time: your car hath been yoked, ye mighty, mead-loving(?) A<I>s</I>vins, showerers of wealth, hear my call!' in reciting which he makes his voice pass through the several tones of the high scale. The Subrahma<I>n</I>y&acirc;, likewise, has to chant the Subrahma<I>n</I>y&acirc; litany (see <a href="sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:17">III, 3, 4, 17</A> seq.)--as he had to do on the previous evening--inserting in it the names of the sacrificer's father and son. The Agn&icirc;dh, in the meantime, prepares the five havis-oblations (savan&icirc;y&acirc;<I>h</I> puro<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>) to be offered at the morning-pressing (cf. <a href="sbe2648.htm#4:2:4:18">IV, 2, 4, 18</A>), and the Unnet<I>ri</I> puts the numerous Soma-vessels in their respective places on the khara, and about the Soma-carts.</P>

The first verse is recited thrice, and the tenth verse is recited after the eleventh, while the priests are returning with the water. As soon as they are in sight, the Hot<I>ri</I> recites verse 13, followed by Rig-veda V, 43, 1; and (when the Ekadhan&acirc; and Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; waters meet together, <a href="sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:29">paragraph 29</A>) Rig-veda II, 35, 3; and, in case some of the water is actually poured over into the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup, I, 83, 2.
