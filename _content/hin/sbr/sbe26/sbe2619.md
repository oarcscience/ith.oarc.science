#### PREPARATION OF THE SOMA ALTAR WITH THE HIGH ALTAR <span id="fr_291"></span>[2](#fn_290).

### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:1">3:5:1:1</span></span>1. From
that post which is the largest on the east side (of the hall) <span
id="fr_292"></span>[3](#fn_291) he now strides three steps forwards (to
the east), and there drives in a peg,--this is the intermediate
(peg) <span id="fr_293"></span>[4](#fn_292).

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:2">3:5:1:2</span></span>2. From
that middle peg he strides fifteen steps to the right, and there drives
in a peg,--this is the right hip.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:3">3:5:1:3</span></span>3. From
that middle peg he strides fifteen steps northwards, and there drives in
a peg,--this is the left hip.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:4">3:5:1:4</span></span>4. From
that middle peg he strides thirty-six steps eastwards, and there drives
in a peg,--this is the fore-part <span id="fr_294"></span>[1](#fn_293).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:5">3:5:1:5</span></span>5. From
that middle peg (in front) he strides twelve steps to the right, and
there drives in a peg, this is the right shoulder.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:6">3:5:1:6</span></span>6. From
that middle peg he strides twelve steps to the north, and there drives
in a peg,--this is the left shoulder. This is the measure of the altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:7">3:5:1:7</span></span>7. Now
the reason why it is thirty steps broad behind is this: the Virâ*g*
metre consists of thirty syllables, and by means of the Virâ*g* the gods
obtained a firm footing in this world; and even so does he now, by means
of the Virâ*g*, obtain a firm footing in this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:8">3:5:1:8</span></span>8. But
there may also be thirty-three (steps); for of thirty-three syllables
also consists the Virâ*g*; and by means of the Virâ*g*, he obtains a
firm footing in this world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:9">3:5:1:9</span></span>9. Then
as to why the 'easterly line <span id="fr_295"></span>[2](#fn_294)' is
thirty-six steps long;--the B*ri*hatî consists of thirty-six syllables,
and by means of the B*ri*hatî the gods obtained

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

the heavenly world: and so does he now, by means of the B*ri*hatî,
obtain the heavenly world and that offering-fire (Âhavanîya) of his is
in the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:10">3:5:1:10</span></span>10. And
as to (the altar) being twenty-four steps broad in front;--the Gâyatrî
consists of twenty-four syllables, and the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of
the sacrifice: this is why it is twenty-four steps broad in front. This
is the measure of the altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:11">3:5:1:11</span></span>11. And
why it is broader behind,--'Wider behind, broad-hipped,' thus they
praise a woman. And by its being wider behind, he makes that womb at the
hind-part (of the altar) wider, and from that wider womb these creatures
are born.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:12">3:5:1:12</span></span>12.
That high altar (Uttaravedi <span id="fr_296"></span>[1](#fn_295)) is
the nose of the sacrifice; because they throw it up so as to be higher
than the altar, therefore it is called 'high altar.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:13">3:5:1:13</span></span>13.
Now, in the beginning there were two kinds of beings here, the Âdityas
and the Aṅgiras. The Aṅgiras then were the first to prepare a sacrifice,
and having prepared the sacrifice they said to Agni, 'Announce thou to
the Âdityas this our to-morrow's Soma-feast, saying, "Minister ye at
this sacrifice of ours!"'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:14">3:5:1:14</span></span>14. The
Âdityas spake (to one another), 'Contrive ye how the Aṅgiras shall
minister unto us, and not we unto the Aṅgiras!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:15">3:5:1:15</span></span>15.
They said, 'Verily by nothing but sacrifice is there a way out of
this <span id="fr_297"></span>[2](#fn_296): let us undertake another

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soma-feast!' They
brought together the (materials for) sacrifice, and having made ready
the sacrifice, they said, 'Agni, thou hast announced to us a Soma-feast
for to-morrow; but we announce to thee and the Aṅgiras a Soma-feast even
for to-day: it is for us that thou art (to officiate as) Hot*ri* <span
id="fr_298"></span>[1](#fn_297)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:16">3:5:1:16</span></span>16.
They sent back some other (messenger) to the Aṅgiras; but the Aṅgiras
going after Agni, were exceeding angry with him, saying, 'Going as our
messenger, why didst thou not mind us <span
id="fr_299"></span>[2](#fn_298)?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:17">3:5:1:17</span></span>17. He
spake, 'The blameless chose me: as the chosen of the blameless, I could
not go away.' And let not therefore the chosen (priest) of a blameless
man turn away from him. The Aṅgiras then officiated for the Âdityas in
the sacrifice with Soma bought (krî) on the same day (sadyas); whence
this Sadya*h*krî <span id="fr_300"></span>[3](#fn_299).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:18">3:5:1:18</span></span>18.
They brought Vâ*k* (speech) to them for their sacrificial fee. They
accepted her not, saying, 'We shall be losers if we accept her.' And so
the performance of that sacrifice was not discharged (completed), as it
was one requiring a sacrificial fee.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:19">3:5:1:19</span></span>19.
Thereupon they brought Sûrya (the sun) to them, and they accepted him.
Wherefore the Aṅgiras say, 'Verily, we are fit for the sacrificial
office, we are worthy to receive Dakshi*n*âs; yea, even he that burns
yonder has been received by us <span id="fr_301"></span>[4](#fn_300)!'

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hence a white
horse is the sacrificial fee for the Sadya*h*krî.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:20">3:5:1:20</span></span>20. On
the front of this (horse) there is a golden ornament, whereby it is made
an image of him that burns yonder.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:21">3:5:1:21</span></span>21. Now
Vâ*k* was angry with them: 'In what respect, forsooth, is that one
better than I,--wherefore is it, that they should have accepted him and
not me <span id="fr_302"></span>[1](#fn_301)?' So saying she went away
from them. Having become a lioness she went on seizing upon
(everything <span id="fr_303"></span>[2](#fn_302)) between those two
contending parties, the gods and the Asuras. The gods called her to
them, and so did the Asuras. Agni was the messenger of the gods, and one
Saharakshas for the Asura-Rakshas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:22">3:5:1:22</span></span>22.
Being willing to go over to the gods, she said, 'What would be mine, if
I were to come over to you?'--'The offering shall reach thee even before
(it reaches) Agni.' She then said to the gods, 'Whatsoever blessing ye
will invoke through me, all that shall be accomplished unto you!' So she
went over to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:23">3:5:1:23</span></span>23.
And, accordingly, when he pours ghee on the high altar <span
id="fr_304"></span>[3](#fn_303), while the fire is held (over it)--since
the gods said to her on that occasion, 'The offering shall reach thee
even before Agni'--then that offering does reach her even before (it
reaches) Agni; for this (high altar) is in reality Vâ*k*. And when he
raises

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

the high altar, it is for the completeness of the sacrifice, for the
sacrifice is Vâ*k* (speech) and that (high altar) is Vâ*k*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:24">3:5:1:24</span></span>24. He
measures it with the yoke and pin;--namely with the yoke (that place)
whither they take (the earth); and with a yoke-pin that, from whence
they take (the earth <span id="fr_305"></span>[1](#fn_304)), for the
team is harnessed with the yoke and the pin: it is because she (Vâ*k*),
as a lioness, at that time roamed about unappeased that he thus yokes
her here at the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:25">3:5:1:25</span></span>25. One
must not therefore accept a Dakshi*n*â (sacrificial fee) that has been
refused (by another priest <span id="fr_306"></span>[2](#fn_305)), for,
having turned into a lioness, it destroys him;--nor must he (the
sacrificer) take it home again, for, having turned into a lioness, it
destroys him;--nor must he give it to any one else, as he would thereby
make over the sacrifice to some one other than himself. Hence if he have
any wretched kinsman, let him give it to him; for in that he gives it
away, it will not turn into a lioness and destroy him; and in that he
gives it to a kinsman, he does not make over (the sacrifice) to one
other than himself: and this is the settling of a refused Dakshi*n*â.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:26">3:5:1:26</span></span>26. He
now takes the yoke-pin and the wooden sword; and from where the northern
peg of the front side is, he strides three steps backwards and there
marks off the pit (*k*âtvâla). The measure for the pit is the same (as
for the high altar) <span id="fr_307"></span>[3](#fn_306); there

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

is no (other) measure in regard to it: wherever he himself may think fit
in his mind (to fix it), in front of the heap of rubbish (utkara), there
let him mark off the pit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:27">3:5:1:27</span></span>27.
From the (north) edge of the altar he lays down the pin from south to
north, and draws the (western) outline, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 9),
'Thou art for me the resort of the afflicted!' Thereby he means this
(earth), for it is thereon that he walks afflicted.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:28">3:5:1:28</span></span>28.
Thereupon he lays down the pin in front from south to north, and draws
the outline with, 'Thou art my wealth-resort.' Thereby he means this
(earth), for it is thereon that he walks having acquired (wealth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:29">3:5:1:29</span></span>29. He
then lays down the pin along the (north) edge of the altar from west to
east, and draws the outline with, 'Preserve me from being in want <span
id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_307)!' Thereby he means this (earth):
'Wherever there is want, from that preserve me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:30">3:5:1:30</span></span>30. He
then lays down the pin on the north side from west to east, and draws
the outline with, 'Preserve me from being afflicted <span
id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_307)!' Thereby he

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

means this (earth): 'wherever there is affliction, from that preserve
me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:31">3:5:1:31</span></span>31. He
then flings (the wooden sword) <span id="fr_310"></span>[1](#fn_308); at
the place where he flings <span id="fr_311"></span>[2](#fn_309), the
Agnîdh sits. He flings while mentioning the names of the Agnis <span
id="fr_312"></span>[3](#fn_310). For those (three) Agnis whom the gods
at first chose for the office of Hot*ri* passed away: they crept into
these very earths,--namely, into this one and the two beyond it. It is
really with this one <span id="fr_313"></span>[4](#fn_311) that he now
flings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:32">3:5:1:32</span></span>32. He
flings with the texts, 'May the Agni called Nabhas <span
id="fr_314"></span>[5](#fn_312) know (thee)! Go thou, O Agni, Aṅgiras,
with the name of Âyu (life)!' What life they passed away from <span
id="fr_315"></span>[6](#fn_313) that he bestows, that he re-animates.
Having with, 'Thou who art in this earth,' taken (the loose soil dug up
by the wooden sword), he puts it down (on the altar <span
id="fr_316"></span>[7](#fn_314)), with, 'Whatever inviolate, holy name
of thine,

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

therewith I lay thee down!' whereby he means to say, 'whatever holy
name, unviolated by the Rakshas, is thine, thereby I lay thee down <span
id="fr_317"></span>[1](#fn_315).'--With 'Thee, moreover, for the delight
of the gods,' he takes (earth) a fourth time <span
id="fr_318"></span>[2](#fn_316); whereby he means to say, 'I take thee
well-pleasing to the gods.' He takes that (high altar) from a
quadrangular pit, for there are four quarters: thus he takes it from all
the four quarters.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:33">3:5:1:33</span></span>33.
Thereupon he shifts (the earth) asunder, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V,
10), 'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies; be thou meet for the
gods!' Inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a lioness and roamed
about unappeased, therefore he says to her, 'Thou art a lioness;' and by
'overcoming the enemies' he means to say, 'Through thee may we worst our
enemies.' 'Be thou meet for the gods' he says, because the high altar is
a woman: her he thus renders meet for the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:34">3:5:1:34</span></span>34. He
makes it on each side either of the size of the yoke, or ten feet of the
sacrificer's <span id="fr_319"></span>[3](#fn_317); for the

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Virâ*g* consists
of ten syllables, and the Virâ*g* is speech, and the sacrifice is
speech. In the middle <span id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_318) he makes, as
it were, a navel, thinking, 'Seated in one and the same place, I shall
sprinkle (ghee) all round <span id="fr_321"></span>[2](#fn_319).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:35">3:5:1:35</span></span>35. He
sprinkles it with water: inasmuch as, on that occasion, she became a
lioness and roamed about unappeased--water being (a means of)
appeasement--he appeases her with water. And, the high altar being a
woman, he thereby fits her for the gods: this is why he sprinkles it
with water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:5:1:36">3:5:1:36</span></span>36. He
sprinkles it with, 'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the enemies: get thee
pure for the gods!' He then bestrews it with gravel. Now gravel
certainly is an ornament, because gravel is rather shining. And that
gravel being the ashes of Agni Vai*s*vânara, he is now about to place
Agni thereon, and so Agni does not injure it: this is why he bestrews it
with gravel. He bestrews it with, 'Thou art a lioness, overcoming the
enemies: array thee for the gods!' He then covers it <span
id="fr_322"></span>[3](#fn_320), and thus covered it remains during that
night.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_290"></span>[111:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_291) The preparation of
the special altars--viz. the large Soma altar (mahâ-vedi, or
saumikî-vedi) and the 'high altar' (uttara-vedi) on the former--takes
place on the last but one Upasad day, after the morning performance of
the Upasads.

<span id="fn_291"></span>[111:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_292) This post stands in
the middle of the east door of the hall or Prâ*k*îna-va*ms*a, just in
front of the Âhavanîya-fire. See [p. 3](sbe2603.htm#page_3), note
[2](sbe2603.htm#fn_27).

<span id="fn_292"></span>[111:4](sbe2619.htm#fr_293) Anta*h*pâta, lit.
'falling within or between,' because it stands <span id="page_112">p.
112</span> between the (new) altar and the Prâ*k*îna-va*ms*a fires and
altar. See III, 5, 2, 2.

<span id="fn_293"></span>[112:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_294) That is, the middle
of the front side of the altar, or, as it were, its head, where the
'high altar' is to be raised.

<span id="fn_294"></span>[112:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_295) The 'prâ*k*î' is
the line drawn from the middle of the west side to that of the front
side of the altar, forming as it were the spine (p*ri*sh*th*yâ) of the
altar.

<span id="fn_295"></span>[113:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_296) On the uttara-vedi
(lit. 'higher, upper altar'), now about to be raised on the fore-part of
the great altar (mahâ-vedi or saumikî vedi) described in the preceding
paragraphs, see also part i, p. 392 note.

<span id="fn_296"></span>[113:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_297) The Kâ*n*va MS.
reads, nâpakrama*n*am astv iti, which, if correct, <span
id="page_114">p. 114</span> would mean, 'Let there be no going away!'
i.e. 'Let us not go (to the Aṅgiras)!' or perhaps, 'Do not thou (Agni)
go away!'

<span id="fn_297"></span>[114:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_298) Teshâ*m* nas tva*m*
hotâsîti, perhaps 'thou wilt sacrifice for us.'

<span id="fn_298"></span>[114:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_299) 'Sent by us, why
didst thou not return?' Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_299"></span>[114:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_300) An ekâha (one
day's) performance of the Soma-sacrifice at which the consecrations,
buying and pressing of Soma, are compressed into one day.

<span id="fn_300"></span>[114:4](sbe2619.htm#fr_301) Api vâ asmâbhir
esha pratig*ri*hîta*h*, 'Ist doch jener von uns empfangen worden.'

<span id="fn_301"></span>[115:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_302) The Kâ*n*va text
reads, Na mad esha kena *k*ana *s*reyan iti na bandhunâ na kena *k*ana
katham eta*m* prag*ri*h*n*îyur na mâm iti; 'That one is not my superior
by anything, not by kinship, not by anything, why should they accept him
and not me?'

<span id="fn_302"></span>[115:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_303) Âdadânâ *k*a*k*âra
= *g*ighatsayâ samîpastha*m* sarva*m* svîkurvatî, Sây.

<span id="fn_303"></span>[115:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_304) See
[III](sbe2620.htm#3:5:2:9), 5, 2, 9-[11](sbe2620.htm#3:5:2:11).

<span id="fn_304"></span>[116:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_305) That is to say, the
pit (*k*âtvâla) whence the earth for the high altar is taken is measured
with the yoke-pin, and the high altar with the yoke. Sâya*n*a seems to
take it differently: Yatra yasmin de*s*e yugena haranti yato yasmât
tatra *s*amyayâpi haranti.

<span id="fn_305"></span>[116:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_306) Or perhaps, one
must not take back a Dakshi*n*â, refused by a priest.

<span id="fn_306"></span>[116:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_307) The earth taken
from the pit being used for constructing the <span id="page_117">p.
117</span> high altar, both are of the same size or cubic content. The
pit is to measure thirty-two aṅgulas (about two feet) on each side. As
to the exact distance of the pit from the north-east peg, this is to be
left to the discretion of the Adhvaryu, provided it be in front of the
utkara, or heap of rubbish formed in making the large altar (on which
the high altar is raised), and a passage be left between the utkara and
the pit. The latter is contiguous to the north edge of the large altar.
As described in the succeeding paragraphs, the west side is marked off
first (by drawing the wooden sword along the inner side of the
yoke-pin), then successively the front, the south, and the north sides.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[117:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_309) For 'nâthitât' and
'vyathitât,' the Kâ*n*va text, as the Taitt. S. VI, 2, 7, 2, has the
readings 'nâthitam' and 'vyathitam.'

<span id="fn_308"></span>[118:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_310) Compare the
Stambaya*g*ur-hara*n*am (which has also to be performed on the present
occasion, in preparing the large altar), I, 2, 4, 8 seq.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[118:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_311) That is, at the
place where the uttaravedi is to be raised, whence the Adhvaryu throws
the sphya to where the pit is to be dug. While he throws (or thrusts in)
the wooden sword, the sacrificer has to take hold of him from behind.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[118:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_312) See I, 2, 3, 1.

<span id="fn_311"></span>[118:4](sbe2619.htm#fr_313) I.e. with the Agni
who entered into this earth.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[118:5](sbe2619.htm#fr_314) Apparently 'vapour,
welkin.' The Kâ*n*va rec. reads, 'Mayest thou know Agni's name Nabhas'
(Vider Agner, &c.). The Taitt. S., on the other hand, reads 'vider Agnir
nabho nâma,' which Sâya*n*a explains by 'the Agni of the vedi (!) is
Nabhas by name.'

<span id="fn_313"></span>[118:6](sbe2619.htm#fr_315) Yat prâdhanva*m*s
tad âyur dadhâti. Perhaps we ought to read with the Kâ*n*va text, Vat
prâdhanvat tad asminn âyur dadhâti tad ena*m* samîrayati, 'the life
which passed away (?), that he bestows on him, therewith he re-animates
him.'

<span id="fn_314"></span>[118:7](sbe2619.htm#fr_316) He throws it on the
fore-part of the altar, close to the peg marking the middle of the front
side, where the 'high altar' is to be raised on it.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[119:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_317) He repeats the same
ceremony a second and a third time with the same texts, except that,
instead of 'Thou who art in this earth,' he says, 'Thou who art in the
second (third) earth.'

<span id="fn_316"></span>[119:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_318) He takes with the
spade as much as is required to make the high altar of the proper size.

<span id="fn_317"></span>[119:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_319) This statement
seems to have greatly puzzled the later ritualists, as Kâty. V, 3, 32-35
and the comments thereon show. In rule 32 it is laid down, in accordance
with [paragraph 26](sbe2619.htm#3:5:1:26) above, that the Adhvaryu is to
make the high altar of the size of the yoke-pin and the pit, i.e. about
two feet square. The next rule then leaves an option between four other
measurements, viz. he may make it either one third of the area of the
large altar, or of unlimited size, or of the size of the yoke (86
aṅgulas = c. 5-5½ feet) or of ten of the sacrificer's feet. This latter
measurement is explained rather ingeniously by Harisvâmin, as meaning
that the high altar is to form <span id="page_120">p. 120</span> an
oblong of three feet by one foot, when, in counting the number of sides
of the three squares thus obtained, we obtain ten sides of one foot
each. However, the repetition of 'da*s*a' in our text--which can only
mean 'ten feet on each side'--does not favour this explanation, The last
two alternatives, according to rules 34-35, only apply to the
Soma-sacrifice, because otherwise the altar (as in the case of the
'northern altar' at the *K*âturmâsya, cf. part i, p. 392) would not be
large enough to contain a 'high altar' of that size.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[120:1](sbe2619.htm#fr_320) The Kâ*n*va text
wants it to be made at the back (*g*aghanena).

<span id="fn_319"></span>[120:2](sbe2619.htm#fr_321) When he makes the
libation of ghee on the high altar (III, 5, 2, 9-14 he pours it on the
four corners of the 'navel' and thereby, as it were, on the whole 'high
altar.'

<span id="fn_320"></span>[120:3](sbe2619.htm#fr_322) Viz. with branches
of udumbara or plaksha (see III, 8, 3, 10), or with darbha grass.
