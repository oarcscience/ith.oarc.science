It having been quieted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he says (to the slaughterer), 'Pull out the omentum!' The omentum having been pulled out&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, let him tell (the slaughterer) to search groping for an embryo. If they do not find one, why need they care? and if they find one, atonement is made therefore.</p>

They then perform with the omentum, just as its mode of performance is&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Having performed with the omentum, both the Adhvaryu and Sacrificer return (to the sacrificial ground). The Adhvaryu says, 'Pull out that embryo!' otherwise he would not pull it out from the womb, since it is only pulled out from the womb of a sick or dead (female); but when the embryo is full grown, then indeed it comes out through birth: let him bid him pull it out even after tearing asunder the thighs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:4">4:5:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. When it is pulled out, he addresses it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 28), 'May the embryo of ten months move together with the caul!'--by saying, 'May it move,' he puts breath into it; and 'of ten months' he says, because when an embryo is full grown, then it is one of ten months: thus, even though it is not ten months old, he makes it one of ten months by means of the Brahman (prayer), the Ya<I>g</I>us.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:5">4:5:2:5</A></FONT></span>5.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:6">4:5:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Here now they say, 'What is he to do with</p>

<p>that embryo?'--They might cut off a portion from every limb, even as (is done) the portioning of other portions. But let him not do so; for that (embryo) surely has its limbs undeveloped. Having cut it below the neck, they should let that fat juice drip into the pot; for that same juice drips from all its limbs, and thus it is a portion cut out from all its limbs. He then cuts the sacrificial portions of the cow in the same way in which they are (usually) portioned off.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:7">4:5:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. They cook them on the cooking-fire of the animal offering: at the same time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_921"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they cook that fat juice. Having wrapped the embryo in the cloth, he lays it down by the side of the cooking-fire. When it (the victim) is cooked, he puts together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_922"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the (flesh) portions and bastes only them, but not that juice. They remove the victim (from the fire); and at the same time they remove that juice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:8">4:5:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. They take it along the back of the pit, between the sacrificial stake and the fire. It having been put down south (of the fire), the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> cuts off the sacrificial portions. He then makes an under-layer (of ghee) in both offering-spoons, and addresses (the Hot<I>ri</I>) for the recitation to the Manot&acirc; deity on the havis. Thereupon they make cuttings from the portions of the cow, in the same way in which cuttings are made from them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_923"></A><A HREF="#fn_919"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:9">4:5:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. Now there is an offering-spoon called pra<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>&icirc;</p>

<p>therein the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> makes an underlayer of ghee for the fat juice, takes two portions (from the juice), bastes them once (with ghee), and replenishes (the juice whence) both portions (have been taken). He (the Adhvaryu) then addresses (the Hot<I>ri</I>) for. the recitation (of the invitatory prayer). Having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the offering prayer)!' As the Vasha<I>t</I> is uttered, the Adhvaryu offers (the flesh portions). After the Adhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> offers (the fat juice)--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:10">4:5:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. With (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 29), 'Thou whose fruit is fit for sacrifice,'--for embryos are unfit for sacrifice: this one he thus makes fit for sacrifice by means of the Brahman, the Ya<I>g</I>us;--'thou who hast a golden womb,'--for on that former occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_924"></A><A HREF="#fn_920"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, they rend the womb when they tear out (the embryo); and gold means immortal life; he thus makes that womb of her (the cow) immortal;--'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with his mother, Hail!' Thus, if it be a male (embryo); but if it be a female one, with, 'Her whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with her mother, Hail!' And, if it be an indistinguishable embryo, let him offer in making it male, since embryos (garbha, masc.) are male, 'Him whose limbs are unbroken, I have brought together with his mother, Hail!' For on that former occasion, when they tear out (the embryo) they separate it from its mother: now, having rendered it successful by means of the Brahman, the Ya<I>g</I>us, he brings it again together with its mother in the midst of the sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:11">4:5:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. Thereupon the Adhvaryu makes the oblation to the Lord of the forest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_925"></A><A HREF="#fn_921"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Having made the oblation to the Lord of the forest, the Adhvaryu, while pouring together the sacrificial portions that are for the upabh<I>ri</I><I>t</I>, says (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t!' The Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> comes and takes all that fat juice, and pours twice (ghee) thereon. Having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, the Adhvaryu says, 'Prompt!' and offers as the Vasha<I>t</I> is uttered. After the Adhvaryu's oblation the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> offers,</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:12">4:5:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. With (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 30), 'The bountiful multiform juice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_926"></A><A HREF="#fn_922"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,'--by 'bountiful' he means to say (the bestower) 'of numerous gifts;' and 'the multiform' he says, because embryos are, as it were, multiform,--'The strong juice hath invested itself with greatness:'--for it (the embryo) is indeed invested&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_927"></A><A HREF="#fn_923"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> in the mother.--'May the worlds spread along her, the one-footed, two-footed, three-footed, four-footed, eight-footed,<font size="-1" color="green">'</font>--'Hail!' He thereby magnifies her (the cow): far more, forsooth, does he gain by offering an eight-footed one, than by one not eight-footed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:13">4:5:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. Here now they say, 'What is he to do with that embryo&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_928"></A><A HREF="#fn_924"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>?' They may expose it on a tree; for</p>

<p>embryos have the air for their support, and the tree is, as it were, the same as the air: thus he establishes it on its own support. But, say they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall expose him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_929"></A><A HREF="#fn_925"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> dead on a tree,' then verily it would be so.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:14">4:5:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. They may throw it into the water, for water is the support of everything here: he thus establishes it in the water. But, say they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'He shall die in water!' then verily it would be so.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:15">4:5:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. They may bury it ins a mole-hill; for this (earth) is the support of everything here: he thus establishes it on this same (earth). But, say they, if, in that case, any one were to curse him, saying, 'They shall quickly prepare a burying-place for him, being dead!' then verily it would be so.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:16">4:5:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. He may offer it to the Maruts on the cooking-fire of the animal sacrifice; for the Maruts, the clans (common people) of the gods, are not oblation-eaters (ahuta-ad)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_930"></A><A HREF="#fn_926"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the uncooked embryo, as it were, is no oblation (ahuta); and the animal cooking-fire is taken from the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya: thus indeed it (the embryo) is</p>

<p><A NAME="page_397"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 397</FONT></A></p>  
<p>not excluded from the sacrifice, and yet is not (offered) directly in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya (offering-fire). And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes it with the Maruts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_931"></A><A HREF="#fn_927"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:17">4:5:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. As soon as he has performed the Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us offerings, when the coals are only just extinguished, he takes that embryo with the cloth, and standing with his face to the east, he offers it with a verse to the Maruts (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 31; Rig-veda I. 86, 1),--'Verily, O Maruts, in whosesoever house ye drink, the heroes of the sky, he is the best protected man.' He utters no Sv&acirc;h&acirc; (hail), for the Maruts, the clans of the gods are no oblation-eaters, and no oblation, as it were, is what is offered without Sv&acirc;h&acirc;. And the Maruts are of the gods: he thus establishes it with the Maruts.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:5:2:18">4:5:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. He then covers it over with the coals with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 32; Rig-veda I, 22, 13), 'The great Heaven and Earth may mix this our sacrifice, and fill us with nourishments!'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_911"></A><A HREF="sbe2661.htm#fr_914">391:1</A> The order of this and the succeeding Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as differs considerably in the two recensions. In the K&acirc;<I>n</I>va recension the present Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (the text of which also differs very much) is preceded by three others (V, 6, 1-3), corresponding to M. IV, 5, 3; IV, 5, 4 and IV, 5, 6, respectively.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_912"></A><A HREF="sbe2661.htm#fr_916">391:2</A> The text has simply, he (viz. the Samit<I>ri</I> or butcher) having quieted it, he (the Adhvaryu) says, (<I>S</I>.) having pulled it out, let him (A.) bid. . . .</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_913"></A><A HREF="sbe2661.htm#fr_917">391:3</A> The meaning of this would seem to be, that they should not content themselves with the supposition of its being a barren cow, but that they should ascertain whether she is not--as the term is--'ash<I>t</I>&acirc;pad&icirc;,' or eight-footed, i.e. a cow with calf (cf. <a href="sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:12">par. 12</A>), and should in that case make atonement. The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text reads, Now when they thus proceed with that (animal offering), they, thinking it to be one (cow) only, pronounce the &acirc;pr&icirc; verses (&acirc;pr&icirc;<I>n</I>anti). They turn out to be two (te dve bhavata<I>h</I>); and surely it is not right that one should cast away that on which the &acirc;pr&icirc; verses have been pronounced. Now that juice has flowed together from all the limbs: thus offering is also made with those sacrificial portions of that (embryo). And the sacrifice is as much as the havis and Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t: he thus connects that whole (embryo) with that sacrifice, <A NAME="page_391"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 391</FONT></A> and thus that which is superfluous (atirikta) becomes not superfluous.</P>
