### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:1">3:3:1:1</span></span>1. He
follows her, stepping into seven foot-prints of hers <span
id="fr_158"></span>[2](#fn_157); he thereby takes possession of her:
that

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were
produced from Vâ*k* (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the
*S*akvarî, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now
draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven
of her foot-prints.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:2">3:3:1:2</span></span>2. It is
as Vâ*k* <span id="fr_159"></span>[1](#fn_158) that he steps into them;
(with the text, Vâ*g*. S. IV, 21), 'Thou art a Vasvî, thou art Aditi,
thou art an Âdityâ, thou art a Rudrâ, thou art *K*andrâ; for she is
indeed a Vasvî and Aditi, an Âdityâ, a Rudrâ, *K*andrâ. 'May
B*ri*haspati make thee rest in happiness!'--B*ri*haspati being the
Brahman, he thereby means to say, 'May B*ri*haspati lead thee hither by
means of the good (work) <span id="fr_160"></span>[2](#fn_159)!' 'Rudra,
together with the Vasus, is well-pleased with thee:' this he says to
secure her (the cow's) safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:3">3:3:1:3</span></span>3. They
now sit down <span id="fr_161"></span>[3](#fn_160) round the seventh
footprint; and having laid down the piece of gold in the foot-print, he
offers. For offering is made on nothing but fire, and the gold has
sprung from Agni's seed: and thus that offering of his is indeed made
over

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

the fire. And the clarified butter being a thunderbolt, he now delivers
her (the cow) by means of that thunderbolt, the butter; and by
delivering her he makes her his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:4">3:3:1:4</span></span>4. He
(the Adhvaryu) offers (with the text, Vâ*g*. S. IV, 22), 'On Aditi's
head I pour thee;' for Aditi being this earth, it is on the head of the
latter that he offers;--'on the worshipping-ground of the earth'--for on
the worshipping-ground of the earth he indeed offers;--'Thou art I*d*â's
footprint, filled with butter, Hail!' for I*d*â being the cow <span
id="fr_162"></span>[1](#fn_161), he indeed offers on the cow's
foot-print; and 'filled with butter, Hail!' he says, because it indeed
becomes filled with butter when offered upon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:5">3:3:1:5</span></span>5.
Thereupon he takes the wooden sword and draws lines round (the
foot-print): the wooden sword being a thunderbolt, it is with the
thunderbolt that he draws round it. Thrice he draws round it, so that he
encompasses it on all sides with a threefold thunderbolt, for no one to
trespass upon it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:6">3:3:1:6</span></span>6. He
draws the lines (with the texts), 'Rejoice in us!' whereby he means to
say, 'Rejoice in the sacrificer!' Having then, by tracing, cut out the
foot-print all round <span id="fr_163"></span>[2](#fn_162), he throws it
into the pan, with, 'In us is thy kinship,' whereby he means to say, 'In
the sacrificer is thy kinship.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:7">3:3:1:7</span></span>7. He
then pours some water on (the place whence the earth has been removed).
Wherever in digging they hurt her (the earth) and knock off anything

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

from her,--water being (a means of) soothing,--that he now soothes by
means of water, that he heals by means of water: that is why he pours
water thereon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:8">3:3:1:8</span></span>8. He
then hands (the dust of) the foot-print to the sacrificer, with, 'In
thee is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'in
thee is cattle.' The sacrificer receives it with, 'With me <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_163) is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he
thereby means to say, 'with me is cattle.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:9">3:3:1:9</span></span>9. The
Adhvaryu then touches himself (near the heart), with, 'May we not be
deprived of prosperity!' Thus the Adhvaryu does not exclude himself from
(the possession of) cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:10">3:3:1:10</span></span>10.
Thereupon they hand (the dust of) the footprint over to the
(sacrificer's) wife. The house being the wife's resting-place, he
thereby establishes her in that safe resting-place, the house: for this
reason he hands over the (earth of the) foot-print to the wife.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:11">3:3:1:11</span></span>11. The
Nesh*tri* makes her say, 'Thine, thine <span
id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_164) is wealth;' whereupon he causes her to
be looked at by the Soma-cow. Now, Soma is a male, and the wife is a
female, and that Soma-cow becomes here (exchanged for) Soma: a
productive union is thus effected;--this is why he causes her to be
looked at by the Soma-cow.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:12">3:3:1:12</span></span>12. He
causes her to be looked at (while she pronounces the text, Vâ*g*. S. IV,
23), 'I have seen eye to eye with the divine intelligence, with the
far-seeing Dakshi*n*â: take

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

not my life from me, neither will I take thine; may I obtain a
hero <span id="fr_166"></span>[1](#fn_165) in thy sight!' She thereby
asks a blessing: a hero meaning a son, she thereby means to say, 'May I
obtain a son in thy sight!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:13">3:3:1:13</span></span>13. One
that is brown, with red-brown eyes, is (fit to be) a Soma-cow. For when
Indra and Vish*n*u divided a thousand (cows) into three parts, there was
one left <span id="fr_167"></span>[2](#fn_166), and her they caused to
propagate herself in three kinds; and hence, even now, if any one were
to divide a thousand by three, one would remain over.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:14">3:3:1:14</span></span>14. The
brown one, with red-brown eyes, is the Soma-cow; and that ruddy one is
the V*ri*tra-killer's (India's) own, whom the king here chooses for
himself <span id="fr_168"></span>[3](#fn_167) after winning the battle;
and the ruddy one with reddish-white eyes <span
id="fr_169"></span>[4](#fn_168) is the Fathers' own whom they slay here
for the Fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:15">3:3:1:15</span></span>15.
Let, then, the brown one, with red-brown eyes, be the Soma-cow. And if
he be unable to obtain a brown one with red-brown eyes, let it be a
dark-red <span id="fr_170"></span>[5](#fn_169) one. And if he be unable
to obtain a dark-red one, let it be a ruddy one, one of the

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> V*ri*tra-killer's
own. But let him nowise turn his fancy upon a ruddy one with
reddish-white eyes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:1:16">3:3:1:16</span></span>16. Let
it be one that is not impregnated. For that Soma-cow is in reality
Vâ*k*, and this Vâ*k* (speech) is of unimpaired vigour; and of
unimpaired vigour is one not (yet) impregnated: let it therefore be one
not impregnated. Let it be one that is neither tailless, nor hornless,
nor one-eyed, nor ear-less <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_170), nor
specially marked, nor seven-hoofed <span
id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_171);--for such a one is uniform, and uniform
is this speech.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_157"></span>[58:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_158) Viz. into seven
foot-prints of her right fore-foot. According to <span id="page_59">p.
59</span> Taitt. S. VI, 1, 8, 1 he steps into six foot-prints and offers
on the seventh. According to Kâty. VII, 6, 17 they pass (or overstep,
atikram) six foot-prints and sit down round the seventh.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[59:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_159) Literally, 'by a
form (rûpe*n*a) of Vâ*k* (speech),' viz. the text which is pronounced.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[59:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_160) This can scarcely be
the correct reading. The Kâ*n*va text has the more acceptable reading,
'B*ri*haspati being the Brahman, and felicity the sacrifice, he thereby
says, "May the Brahman make thee rest (or delight, ramayatu) in the good
(work), the sacrifice!"'

<span id="fn_160"></span>[59:3](sbe2611.htm#fr_161) According to the
comm. on Kâty. VII, 6, 17 the Brahman and the Sacrificer are to sit on
the south, the Adhvaryu on the west, and the Nesh*tri* on the north side
of the foot-print.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[60:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_162) See the legend, part
i, p. 216 seq.; especially I, 8, 1, 7; 20; and p. 226, note 3.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[60:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_163) According to the
comm. on Kâty. VII, 6, 20, it would rather seem that he scratches with
the sphya all over the foot-print and then takes out the loose dust
(pâ*m*sûn) and throws it into the pan.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[61:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_164) The Kâ*n*va text
(Sa*m*hitâ and Br.) has asme instead of me.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[61:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_165) See St. Petersb.
Dict. s. v. totas. The Kâ*n*va text explains it similarly: 'tvayi tvayi
pa*s*ava*h*.' The Taitt. S. VI, 1, 8, 5 has 'Tote râya*h*'--"Thine (?)
is wealth" thus for the wife, for she, the wife, is one half of
himself.'

<span id="fn_165"></span>[62:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_166) The Kâ*n*va text
reads 'may I obtain heroes.'

<span id="fn_166"></span>[62:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_167) This arithmetical
feat of Indra and Vish*n*u is apparently already referred to in Rig-veda
VI, 69, 8, though nothing is said there as to the difficulty regarding
the odd cow. The threefold division seems to refer to Vish*n*u's three
steps, by which (as the sun) he measures the sky; or to the division of
the universe into the three worlds (?). See also Ait. Br. VI, 15.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[62:3](sbe2611.htm#fr_168) Or, drives forth
(from the enemy's stables). The red cows are compared with the red
clouds, which appear after the thunderstorm (i.e. after king Indra's
battle with V*ri*tra).

<span id="fn_168"></span>[62:4](sbe2611.htm#fr_169) Sâya*n*a takes
'*s*yetâkshî' as 'black-eyed (k*ri*sh*n*alo*k*anâ).'

<span id="fn_169"></span>[62:5](sbe2611.htm#fr_170) 'Aru*n*â;' the
Kâ*n*va text adds, 'for that one nearest to it (the brown one, or
Soma-cow proper) in appearance.'

<span id="fn_170"></span>[63:1](sbe2611.htm#fr_171) 'Akar*n*â;' the
Kâ*n*va text has 'anupârsh*t*akar*n*â (one whose ears are not
perforated?),' and instead of 'alakshitâ (not specially marked),' it
reads 'a*s*ro*n*â (a*s*lo*n*â), not lame.'

<span id="fn_171"></span>[63:2](sbe2611.htm#fr_172) That is, with one
hoof undivided (seven-toed).
