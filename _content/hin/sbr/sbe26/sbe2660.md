### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:1">4:5:1:1</span></span>1. He
proceeds with the rice-pap to Aditi, as the concluding oblation. The
reason why there is a rice-pap for Aditi is this. Because, on that
former occasion <span id="fr_900"></span>[2](#fn_897), the gods said to
her, 'Thine forsooth shall be the opening, and thine the concluding
oblation,' therefore he prepares that share for her at both ends (of the
Soma-sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:2">4:5:1:2</span></span>2. And
because, on that occasion, he offers when about to go forth (upa-pra-i)
to buy the king (Soma), therefore that (opening oblation) is called
Prâya*n*îya. And because he now offers after coming out (ud-â-i) from
the expiatory bath, therefore this (concluding oblation) is called
Udaya*n*îya <span id="fr_901"></span>[3](#fn_898). For this indeed is
one and the same oblation: to Aditi belongs the opening, to Aditi the
concluding (oblation); for Aditi is this (earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:3">4:5:1:3</span></span>3. To
Pathyâ Svasti he offers first (at the opening sacrifice): then the gods,
through speech, saw their way in what was unknown to them, for by speech
the confused becomes known. But now that it is known, he performs in the
proper order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:4">4:5:1:4</span></span>4. To
Agni he offers first, then to Soma, then to Savit*ri*, then to Pathyâ
Svasti, then to Aditi, Now Pathyâ Svasti (the wishing of a 'happy
journey')

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

is speech, and Aditi is this (earth): on her the gods thereby
established speech, and thus established thereon speech speaks here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:5">4:5:1:5</span></span>5.
Thereupon he slaughters a barren anûbandhyâ <span
id="fr_902"></span>[1](#fn_899) cow for Mitra and Varu*n*a. And this
indeed is performed as a different sacrifice, and that an animal
offering; for the Samish*t*aya*g*us form the end of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:6">4:5:1:6</span></span>6. The
reason why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varu*n*a is this.
Whatever part of his (sacrifice) <span id="fr_903"></span>[2](#fn_900)
who has offered is well-offered that part of his Mitra takes, and
whatever is ill-offered that Varu*n*a takes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:7">4:5:1:7</span></span>7. Then
they say, 'What has become of the sacrificer?'--whatever well-offered
part of his (sacrifice) Mitra here takes, that he now again surrenders
to him, being pleased with this (cow); and whatever ill-offered part of
his Varu*n*a takes, that indeed he makes well-offered for him, being
pleased with this (cow), and surrenders it again to him. This forsooth
is his own sacrifice <span id="fr_904"></span>[3](#fn_901), his own
merit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:8">4:5:1:8</span></span>8. And
again, why there is a barren cow for Mitra and Varu*n*a. Now, when the
gods caused the cast seed to spring,--there is that *s*astra called
Âgnimâruta <span id="fr_905"></span>[4](#fn_902): in connection
therewith it is explained how

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

the gods caused that seed to spring. From it the coals (aṅgâra) sprung,
and from the coals the Aṅgiras; and after that the other animals <span
id="fr_906"></span>[1](#fn_903).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:9">4:5:1:9</span></span>9. Then
the dust of the ashes which remained: therefrom the ass was
produced,--hence when it is dusty anywhere, people say, 'A very place
for asses, forsooth <span id="fr_907"></span>[2](#fn_904)!' And when no
sap whatever remained,--thence was produced that barren cow belonging to
Mitra and Varu*n*a; wherefore that (cow) does not bring forth, for from
sap seed is produced, and from seed cattle. And because she was produced
at the end, therefore she comes after the end of the sacrifice. Hence
also a barren cow for Mitra and Varu*n*a is the most proper here: if he
cannot obtain a barren cow, it may also be a bullock <span
id="fr_908"></span>[3](#fn_905).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:10">4:5:1:10</span></span>10.
Then the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* applied themselves <span
id="fr_909"></span>[4](#fn_906) a second time: thence the Vai*s*vadevî
(cow) was produced; then the Bârhaspatyâ: that is the end, for
B*ri*haspati is the end.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:11">4:5:1:11</span></span>11. And
whosoever gives a thousand or more

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (cows to the
priests), he will slaughter all these;--indeed, everything is obtained,
everything conquered by him who gives a thousand or more. Those (three)
cows are everything, (when offered) thus in the proper order: first one
to Mitra and Varu*n*a, then one to the All-gods, then one to
B*ri*haspati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:12">4:5:1:12</span></span>12. And
those who perform a long sacrificial session, for a year or more, they
will slaughter all these <span id="fr_910"></span>[1](#fn_907);--indeed
everything is obtained, everything conquered by those who perform a long
sacrificial session, for a year or more: those (cows) are everything,
(when offered) thus in the proper order.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:13">4:5:1:13</span></span>13.
Thereupon he performs the Udavasânîyâ ish*t*i (completing oblation). He
prepares a cake on five potsherds for Agni. Its invitatory and offering
prayers are five-footed paṅktis <span id="fr_911"></span>[2](#fn_908).
For at this time the sacrifice of him who has sacrificed is, as it were,
exhausted in strength: it, as it were, passes away from him. Now all
sacrifices are Agni, since all sacrifices are performed in him, the
domestic sacrifices as well as others. He thus takes hold again of the
sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice of his is

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

not exhausted in strength, and does not pass away from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:14">4:5:1:14</span></span>14. The
reason why the cake is one on five potsherds, and the invitatory and
offering prayers are paṅktis (verses of five feet), is that the
sacrifice is fivefold. He thus takes hold again of the sacrifice, and
thus that sacrifice of his is not exhausted in strength, and does not
pass away from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:15">4:5:1:15</span></span>15. The
priests’ fee for it is gold; for this is a sacrifice to Agni, and gold
is Agni's seed: therefore the priests’ fee is gold. Or an ox, for such a
one is of Agni's nature as regards its shoulder, since its shoulder
(bearing the yoke) is as if burnt by fire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:1:16">4:5:1:16</span></span>16.
Or <span id="fr_912"></span>[1](#fn_909), he takes ghee in five
ladlings, and offers it with the verse to Vish*n*u (Vâ*g*. S. V, 38),
'Stride thou widely, O Vish*n*u, make wide room for our abode! drink the
ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed the lord of the sacrifice ever
onwards, Hail!' For Vish*n*u is the sacrifice: he thus takes hold again
of the sacrifice, and thus his sacrifice is not exhausted in strength,
and does not pass away from him. And let him on this occasion give as
much as he can afford, for no offering, they say, should be without a
Dakshi*n*â. When this Udavasânîyâ-ish*t*i is completed, he offers the
(ordinary) evening (milk) offering <span
id="fr_913"></span>[2](#fn_910),--but the morning offering at its proper
time.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_897"></span>[386:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_900) See [III, 2, 3,
6](sbe2609.htm#3:2:3:6).

<span id="fn_898"></span>[386:3](sbe2660.htm#fr_901) See [p.
48](sbe2609.htm#page_48), note [1](sbe2609.htm#fn_125).

<span id="fn_899"></span>[387:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_902) The meaning of this
technical term would seem to be 'to be bound (or immolated) after' the
sacrifice.

<span id="fn_900"></span>[387:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_903) Or, of him, the
sacrificer.

<span id="fn_901"></span>[387:3](sbe2660.htm#fr_904) That is, the
sacrifice of his own self.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[387:4](sbe2660.htm#fr_905) The same passage
occurs at I, 7, 4, 4, where I erroneously supplied 'samabhavat.' It is a
broken, incoherent construction. The explanation, referred to in these
two passages, may be Ait. Br. III, 34, though in that case one might
have expected a somewhat closer adherence to the order of production
there proposed; <span id="page_388">p. 388</span> see part i, p. 210,
note 1. Regarding the Âgnimâruta *s*astra, see above, [p.
369](sbe2656.htm#page_369) note .

<span id="fn_903"></span>[388:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_906) ? Or, the others,
the animals (tad any anye pa*s*ava*h*). Cp. the French idiom, 'Les
femmes et nous autres hommes.' The Kâ*n*va text reads, tad anu
pa*s*ava*h*.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[388:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_907) The Kâ*n*va reads,
And when they (the coals) became dust of ashes, the ass was produced
therefrom: hence they call 'asses’ place' where the dust of the ashes
(lies).

<span id="fn_905"></span>[388:3](sbe2660.htm#fr_908) Kâty. X, 9,15
allows, in lieu of the animal offering, an oblation of clotted curds
(payasyâ or âmikshâ). See also II, 4, 2, 1 4.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[388:4](sbe2660.htm#fr_909) ? They applied
their minds, or, they took hold (amarîm*ris*anta): 'Tad u vi*s*ve devâ
marim*ris*â*m* *k*akrire tato dvitîyâ vai*s*vadevî samabhavat.' Kâ*n*va
text. Perhaps the verb has here the same meaning as 'dhû' in the passage
of the Ait. Br. referred to, tad (reto) maruto ’dhunvan.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[389:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_910) The immolation of
the three anubandhyâ cows is prescribed at the end of the Gavâmayana
(see note on [IV, 5, 4, 14](sbe2663.htm#4:5:4:14)), and at other Sattras
(sacrificial session) lasting at least a year, and endowed with fees of
at least a thousand cows, except the Sârasvata Sattra. Kâty. XIII, 4, 4,
5.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[389:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_911) The Udavasânîyâ
ish*t*i is performed, with certain modifications, on the model of the
Paunarâdheyikî ish*t*i, or offering for the re-establishment of the
sacred fire; for which see II, 2, 3, 4 seq., and especially the notes on
part i, p. 317 seq. It is to be performed somewhere north of the
sacrificial ground on a fire produced by the churning of the ara*n*is or
(pairs of) churning-sticks, with which the priests have previously
'lifted' their several fires. See [p. 90](sbe2615.htm#page_90), notes
[4](sbe2615.htm#fn_240) and [5](sbe2615.htm#fn_241); and part i, p. 396,
note 1.

<span id="fn_909"></span>[390:1](sbe2660.htm#fr_912) According to Kâty.
X, 9, 20 (as interpreted by the commentator) this (Vaish*n*avî) âhuti
may optionally take the place of the Udavasânîyâ ish*t*i. 'Atho' has
evidently the force of 'or' here, as in IV, 6, 4, 5. The Kâ*n*va text
has atho apy âhutim eva *g*uhuyât; with the same meaning, cf. I, 1, 3,
3; also 'uto,' note to [IV, 5, 2, 13](sbe2661.htm#4:5:2:13).

<span id="fn_910"></span>[390:2](sbe2660.htm#fr_913) For the Agnihotra,
or morning and evening libation of milk, see II, 2, 4; 3, 4. The
performance being completed, the temporary <span id="page_391">p.
391</span> erections, as the Sadas, cart-shed, Âgnîdhra fire-house, &c.,
are set on fire, and the sacrificer and priests go home.
