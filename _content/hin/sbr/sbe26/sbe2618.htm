<p>they perform the Upasads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> after performing the Pravargya, and thereby they put the neck in its place.</p>

The anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;s (invitatory prayers) in the forenoon are the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;s (offering prayers) in the afternoon; and the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;s are the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.

Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, were contending against each other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_276"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. The Asuras then built themselves castles in these worlds,--an iron one in this world, a silver one in the air, and a golden one in the sky.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:4">3:4:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. The gods then prevailed. They besieged them by these sieges (upasad); and because they besieged (upa-sad) them, therefore the name Upasads.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> They clove the castles and conquered these worlds. Hence they say, 'A castle is conquered by siege;' for it is indeed by beleaguering that one of these human castles is taken.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:5">3:4:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. By means of these sieges, then, the gods clove the castles and conquered these worlds. And so does this one (the sacrificer) now,--no one, it is true, builds for himself castles against him in this world; he cleaves these same worlds, he conquers these worlds: therefore he offers with the Upasads.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:6">3:4:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. They have clarified butter for their offering material. For ghee is a thunderbolt, and by that thunderbolt, the ghee, the gods clove the strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he cleave these worlds by that thunderbolt, the ghee, and conquer these worlds; therefore they (the Upasads) have ghee for their offering material.</p>

'Seat thee, O Hot<I>ri</I>!' he says. The Hot<I>ri</I> sits down on the Hot<I>ri</I>'s seat.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:11">3:4:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. While passing over (to the south side of the fire and altar) he says&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_283"></A><A HREF="#fn_282"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> (to the Hot<I>ri</I>), 'Recite the invitatory prayer to Agni!' and having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says, 'Pronounce the offering prayer to Agni!' and pours out the oblation when the Vasha<I>t</I> is uttered.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:12">3:4:4:12</A></FONT></span>12.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:14">3:4:4:14</A></FONT></span>14. The reason why in offering he remains standing in one and the same place, and does not move about as he is wont to do here in performing, is that he thinks 'I will conquer for conquest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_285"></A><A HREF="#fn_284"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' And the reason why he offers to those deities is that he thereby constructs the thunderbolt: Agni (he makes) the point (an&icirc;ka), Soma the barb (<I>s</I>alya), and Vish<I>n</I>u the connecting piece (kulmala)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_285"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:15">3:4:4:15</A></FONT></span>15. For the thunderbolt is the year the day is Agni, the night Soma, and what is between the two, that is Vish<I>n</I>u. Thus he makes the revolving year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:16">3:4:4:16</A></FONT></span>16. The thunderbolt is the year: by that year, as a thunderbolt, the gods clove the strongholds and conquered these worlds. And so does he now by that year, as a thunderbolt, cleave these worlds, and conquer these worlds. This is why he offers to those gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:17">3:4:4:17</A></FONT></span>17. Let him undertake three Upasads; for, there being three seasons in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year. He performs twice each.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:18">3:4:4:18</A></FONT></span>18. These amount to six; for, there being six seasons in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:19">3:4:4:19</A></FONT></span>19. And should he undertake twelve Upasads,--there being twelve months in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year. He performs twice each.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:20">3:4:4:20</A></FONT></span>20. These amount to twenty-four;--there being twenty-four half-moons in the year, it is thereby made of the form of the year: he thus makes up the year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:21">3:4:4:21</A></FONT></span>21. As to his performing in the evening and in the morning,--it is because only thus completeness is obtained. When he performs in the forenoon, then he gains the victory;--and when he performs in the afternoon, he does so that it may be a good (complete) victory;--and when he offers the Homa, (it is as if) people fight here for a stronghold, and having conquered it, they enter it as their own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:22">3:4:4:22</A></FONT></span>22. When he performs (the upasads), he fights; and when (the performance) is completed, he conquers; and when he offers the Homa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_287"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he enters that (stronghold) now his own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:23">3:4:4:23</A></FONT></span>23. He offers it (with the verse) with which he</p>

<p>will have to perform twice in one day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_288"></A><A HREF="#fn_287"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. V, 8), 'What most excellent iron-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed iron.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:24">3:4:4:24</A></FONT></span>24. Again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to perform twice in one day, 'What most excellent silver-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed silver.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:25">3:4:4:25</A></FONT></span>25. And again he offers (with the verse) with which he will have to perform twice in one day, 'What most excellent gold-clad body is thine, O Agni, established in the deep, it hath chased away the cruel word, it hath chased away the fearful word; Hail!' for such-like it was, it was indeed golden. If he undertakes twelve Upasads, let him perform each of them for four days.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:26">3:4:4:26</A></FONT></span>26. Now then of the fast-homages. Some Upasads get wider and wider, others narrower and narrower: those at which he milks out one (teat)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_289"></A><A HREF="#fn_288"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on the first day, then two, and then three, are those that get wider and wider; and those at which he</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  
<p>milks out three on the first day, then two, and then one, are those that get narrower and narrower. Those getting narrower and narrower are (as good as) those getting wider and wider; and those getting wider and wider are (as good as) those getting narrower and narrower.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:4:4:27">3:4:4:27</A></FONT></span>27. Verily, the world is conquered by austere devotion. Now, his devotion becomes ever and ever wider, he conquers an ever and ever more glorious world and becomes better even in this world, whosoever, knowing this, undertakes the Upasads that get narrower and narrower&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_289"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: let him, therefore, undertake the Upasads that get narrower and narrower. And should he undertake twelve Upasads, let him have three (teats) milked out for four days, two for four days, and one for four days.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_272"></A><A HREF="sbe2618.htm#fr_273">104:3</A> The Pravargya, an offering of heated milk, which precedes each performance of the Upasads,--except at the first performance of the Soma-sacrifice, when it is prohibited by many authorities,--seems originally to have been an independent ceremony, and as such it is treated by most ritualistic books apart from the exposition of the Soma-cult. The <I>S</I>atapatha-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a deals with it in XIV, 1-3 (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXIX). Its mystic significance appears to have been that of supplying the sacrificer with a new celestial body. There seems to have been a tendency towards exalting its <A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A> importance--if not, indeed, towards making it take the place of the Soma-cult. The hot milk (gharma) is even styled 'Samr&acirc;<I>g</I>' or supreme king--as against the title 'r&acirc;<I>g</I>an' or king, assigned to Soma; and a throne is provided for it, just as for the latter. The rules for its performance, according to the &Acirc;pastamba <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tra, have been published, with a translation, by Professor Garbe (Zeitsch. der D. M. G. XXXIV, p. 319 seq.). See also Haug's Transl. of the Ait. Br. pp. 41-43; Weber, Ind. Stud. IX. pp. 218-220.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_273"></A><A HREF="sbe2618.htm#fr_274">105:1</A> The Upasada<I>h</I>, consisting of three offerings of ghee to Agni, Soma, and Vish<I>n</I>u, followed by a Homa, have to be performed twice daily, for at least three days (the normal number at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma). The first day's performance is called (from the corresponding Homa) the 'aya<I>h</I><I>s</I>ay&acirc;' (lying in iron, made of iron), the second day's 'ra<I>g</I>a<I>h</I><I>s</I>ay&acirc;' (silvern),and the third day's 'hari<I>s</I>ay&acirc;' (golden). If there are six, or twelve Upasad days, each of the three varieties of performance has assigned to it an equal number of successive days; and if there are more than twelve the three varieties are to be performed alternately.</P>
