South of the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya he spreads two black antelope skins on the ground, with the neck parts towards the east: thereon he consecrates him. If there are two (skins), they are an image of these two worlds (heaven and earth), and thus he consecrates him on these two worlds.</p>

They are joined (fitted) together along their edge&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_77"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for these two worlds are also, as it were, joined together at their edge. At the hind part they are fastened together through holes: thus, after uniting (mithun&icirc;k<I>ri</I>tya) these two worlds, he consecrates him thereon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:3">3:2:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. But if there be only one (skin), then it is an image of these (three) worlds; then he consecrates him on these (three) worlds. Those (hairs) which are white are an image of the sky; those which are black are (an image) of this (earth);--or, if he likes, conversely: those which are black are an image of the sky, and those which are white are (an image) of this (earth). Those which are of a brownish yellow colour&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, are an image of the atmosphere. Thus he consecrates him on these (three) worlds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:4">3:2:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. And let him, in that case, turn in the hind end (of the skin)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: thus, after uniting these worlds with each other, he consecrates him thereon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:5">3:2:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. He then squats down behind the two skins, with his face towards the east and with bent (right) knee; and while touching them thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> at a place</p>

<p>where the white and black (hair) join, he mutters (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 9), 'Ye are the images of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> and S&acirc;man;'--an image doubtless is what is conformable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_81"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: 'Ye are conformable to, the <I>ri</I><I>k</I>s and s&acirc;mans' he thereby means to say.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:6">3:2:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. 'I touch you.' Now, he who is consecrated becomes an embryo, and enters into the metres: hence he has his hands closed, since embryos have their hands closed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:7">3:2:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. And when he says, 'I touch you,' he means to say, 'I enter into you.' 'Do ye guard me up to the goal of this sacrifice!' whereby he says, 'Do ye protect me until the completion of this sacrifice!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:8">3:2:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. He then kneels down with his right knee (on the skin), with the text, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge!' for the skin (<I>k</I>arma) of the black deer it is indeed among men, but among the gods it is a refuge (<I>s</I>arma): therefore he says, 'Thou art a refuge: afford me refuge.' 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!' Now he who raises himself upon the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_82"></A><A HREF="#fn_81"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> doubtless raises himself to one that is his better; for the black deer skin is a (means of) sacrifice. Hereby, now, he propitiates that sacrifice, and thus that sacrifice does not injure him: for this reason he says, 'Homage be to thee: injure me not!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:9">3:2:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. He must indeed sit down first on the hind part (of the skin). Were he, on the other hand, to sit down at once in the middle (of the skin), and were</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>any one there to curse him, saying, 'He shall either become demented or fall down headlong!' then that would indeed come to pass. Let him therefore first sit down on the hind part (of the skin).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:10">3:2:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. He then girds himself with the zone. For once upon a time when the A&#7749;giras were consecrated, they were seized with weakness, for they had prepared no other food but fast-milk. They then perceived this (source of) strength (viz. the zone), and this (source of) strength they put in (or round) the middle of their body as a (means of attaining) completion: and thereby they attained completion. And so does he now put that (source of) strength in the middle of his body and thereby attain completion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:11">3:2:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. It is made of hemp. Hempen it is in order to be soft. Now when Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, that which was nearest to him, the amnion, became hempen threads: hence they smell putrid. And that which was the outer membrane (and placenta) became the garment of the consecrated. Now the amnion lies under the outer membrane, and hence that (zone) is worn under the garment. And in like manner as Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, having become an embryo, sprung forth from that sacrifice, so does he become an embryo and spring forth from that sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:12">3:2:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. It (the cord) is a triple one, because food is threefold, food being cattle. (Moreover) the father and mother (are two), and that which is born is a third: hence it is a triple (cord).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:13">3:2:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. It is intertwined with a shoot of reed (mu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>a) grass, for the sake of chasing away the evil spirits, the reed being a thunderbolt. It is plaited after</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the manner of a braid of hair. For were it to be twisted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_83"></A><A HREF="#fn_82"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> sunwise (from left to right) as any other cords, it would be human; and were it twisted contrary to the course of the sun, it would be sacred to the Fathers: hence it is plaited after the manner of a braid of hair.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:14">3:2:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. He girds himself with it, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 10), 'Thou art the strength of the A&#7749;giras,'--for the A&#7749;giras perceived this (source of) strength; 'soft as wool, bestow thou strength on me!' there is nothing obscure in this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:15">3:2:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. He then tucks up the end of his (nether) garment, with the text, 'Thou art Soma's tuck.' For heretofore it was the tuck of him, the unconsecrated; but now that he is consecrated, it is that of Soma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_84"></A><A HREF="#fn_83"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: therefore he says, 'Thou art Soma's tuck.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:16">3:2:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. He then wraps up (his head)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_85"></A><A HREF="#fn_84"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and embryos are enveloped both by the amnion and the outer membrane: therefore he covers (his head).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:17">3:2:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. He covers himself, with the text, 'Thou art Vish<I>n</I>u's refuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.' He who is consecrated indeed becomes both Vish<I>n</I>u and a sacrificer; for when he is consecrated, he is Vish<I>n</I>u; and when he sacrifices, he is the sacrificer: therefore he says, 'Thou art Vish<I>n</I>u's refuge, the refuge of the sacrificer.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:18">3:2:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. Thereupon he ties a black deer's horn to the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>end (of his garment&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>). Now the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, entered upon their father Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's inheritance: the gods came in for the Mind and the Asuras for Speech. Thereby the gods came in for the sacrifice and Asuras for speech; the gods for yonder (heaven) and the Asuras for this (earth).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:19">3:2:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. The gods said to Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (m., the sacrifice), 'That V&acirc;<I>k</I> (f., speech) is a woman: beckon her, and she will certainly call thee to her.' Or it may be, he himself thought, 'That V&acirc;<I>k</I> is a woman: I will beckon her and she will certainly call me to her.' He accordingly beckoned her. She, however, at first disdained him from the distance: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, at first disdains him from the distance. He said, 'She has disdained me from the distance.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:20">3:2:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. They said, 'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.' He beckoned her; but she only replied to him, as it were, by shaking her head: and hence a woman, when beckoned by a man, only replies to him, as it were, by shaking her head. He said, 'She has only replied to me by shaking her head.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:21">3:2:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. They said, 'Do but beckon her, reverend sir, and she will certainly call thee to her.' He beckoned her, and she called him to her; and hence a woman at last calls the man to her. He said, 'She has indeed called me.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:22">3:2:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. The gods reflected, 'That V&acirc;<I>k</I> being a woman, we must take care lest she should allure him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--Say to her, "Come hither to me where I stand!" and report to us her having come.' She then went up to where he was standing. Hence a woman goes to a man who stays in a well-trimmed (house). He reported to them her having come, saying, 'She has indeed come.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:23">3:2:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. The gods then cut her off from the Asuras; and having gained possession of her and enveloped her completely in fire, they offered her up as a holocaust, it being an offering of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_88"></A><A HREF="#fn_87"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. And in that they offered her with an anush<I>t</I>ubh verse, thereby they made her their own; and the Asuras, being deprived of speech, were undone, crying, 'He &#8217;lava<I>h</I>! he &#8217;lava<I>h</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_89"></A><A HREF="#fn_88"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!<font size="-1" color="green">'</font></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:24">3:2:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. Such was the unintelligible speech which they then uttered,--and he (who speaks thus) is a Mle<I>k</I><I>kh</I>a (barbarian). Hence let no Brahman speak barbarous language, since such is the speech of the Asuras. Thus alone he deprives his spiteful enemies of speech; and whosoever knows this, his enemies, being deprived of speech, are undone.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:25">3:2:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. That Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (sacrifice) lusted after V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_90"></A><A HREF="#fn_89"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), thinking, 'May I pair with her!' He united with her.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:26">3:2:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. Indra then thought within himself, 'Surely a great monster will spring from this union of Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a and V&acirc;<I>k</I>: [I must take care] lest it should get the better of me.' Indra himself then became an embryo and entered into that union.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:27">3:2:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. Now when he was born after a year's time, he thought within himself, 'Verily of great vigour is this womb which has contained me: [I must take care] that no great monster shall be born from it after me, lest it should get the better of me!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:28">3:2:1:28</A></FONT></span>28. Having seized and pressed it tightly, he tore it off and put it on the head of Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_90"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>);for the black (antelope) is the sacrifice: the black deer skin is the same as that sacrifice, and the black deer's horn is the same as that womb. And because it was by pressing it tightly together that Indra tore out (the womb), therefore it (the horn) is bound tightly (to the end of the garment); and as Indra,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>having become an embryo, sprang from that union, so is he (the sacrificer), after becoming an embryo, born from that union (of the skin and the horn).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:29">3:2:1:29</A></FONT></span>29. He ties it (to the end of the garment) with the open part upwards, for it is in this way that the womb bears the embryo. He then touches with it his forehead close over the right eyebrow, with the text, 'Thou art Indra's womb,'--for it is indeed Indra's womb, since in entering it he enters thereby&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and in being born he is born therefrom: therefore he says, 'Thou art Indra's womb.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:30">3:2:1:30</A></FONT></span>30. Thereupon he draws (with the horn) the ('easterly') line, with the text, 'Make the crops full-eared!' Thereby he produces the sacrifice; for when there is a good year, then there is abundant (material) for sacrifice; but when there is a bad year, then there is not even enough for himself: hence he thereby produces the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:31">3:2:1:31</A></FONT></span>31. And let not the consecrated henceforth scratch himself either with a chip of wood or with his nail. For he who is consecrated becomes an embryo; and were any one to scratch an embryo either with a chip of wood or his nail, thereby expelling it, it would die&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Thereafter the consecrated would be liable to be affected with the itch; and--offspring (retas) coming after the consecrated--that offspring would then also be liable to be born with the itch. Now his</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>own womb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> does not injure its offspring, and that black deer's horn being indeed his own womb, that (horn) does not injure him; and therefore the consecrated should scratch himself with the black deer's horn and with nothing but the black deer's horn.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:32">3:2:1:32</A></FONT></span>32. He (the Adhvaryu) then hands to him a staff, for driving away the evil spirits,--the staff being a thunderbolt.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:33">3:2:1:33</A></FONT></span>33. It is of Udumbara wood (Ficus Glomerata), for him to obtain food and strength,--the Udumbara means food and strength: therefore it is of Udumbara wood.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:34">3:2:1:34</A></FONT></span>34. It reaches up to his mouth,--for so far extends his strength: as great as his strength is, so great it (the staff) is when it reaches up to his mouth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:35">3:2:1:35</A></FONT></span>35. He makes it stand upright, with the text, 'Stand up, O tree, erect; guard me from injury on to the goal of this sacrifice!' whereby he means to say, 'Standing erect, protect me till the completion of this sacrifice!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:36">3:2:1:36</A></FONT></span>36. It is only now that some bend the fingers inward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and restrain their speech, because, they argue, only from now will he not have to mutter anything. But let him not do so; for in like manner as if one were to try to overtake some one who runs away, but could not overtake him, so does he not overtake the sacrifice. Let him therefore turn in his fingers and restrain his speech on that (former) occasion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:37">3:2:1:37</A></FONT></span>37. And when the consecrated (after restraining his speech) utters either a <I>ri</I><I>k</I>, or a s&acirc;man, or a ya<I>g</I>us&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he thereby takes a firmer and firmer hold of the sacrifice: let him therefore turn in his fingers and restrain his speech on that (former) occasion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:38">3:2:1:38</A></FONT></span>38. And when he restrains his speech--speech being sacrifice--he thereby appropriates the sacrifice to himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. But when, from speech restrained, he utters any sound (foreign to the sacrifice), then that sacrifice, being set free, flies away. In that case, then, let him mutter either a <I>ri</I><I>k</I> or a ya<I>g</I>us addressed to Vish<I>n</I>u, for Vish<I>n</I>u is the sacrifice: thereby he again gets hold of the sacrifice; and this is the atonement for that (transgression).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:39">3:2:1:39</A></FONT></span>39. Thereupon some one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> calls out, 'Consecrated is this Br&acirc;hman, consecrated is this Br&acirc;hman:' him, being thus announced, he thereby announces to the gods: 'Of great vigour is this one who has obtained the sacrifice; he has become one of yours: protect him!' this is what he means to say. Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:1:40">3:2:1:40</A></FONT></span>40. And as to his saying, 'Br&acirc;hman,' uncertain, as it were, is his origin heretofore&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; for the Rakshas, they say, pursue women here oil earth, and so the Rakshas implant their seed therein. But he, forsooth, is truly born, who is born of the Brahman (neut.), of the sacrifice: wherefore let him address even a R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya, or a Vai<I>s</I>ya, as Br&acirc;hman, since he who is born of the sacrifice is born of the Brahman (and hence a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a). Wherefore they say, 'Let no one slay a sacrificer of Soma; for by (slaying) a Soma-sacrificer he becomes guilty of a heinous sin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>!</p>
