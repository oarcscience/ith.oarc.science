### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:1">3:7:4:1</span></span>1. Having
made a noose, he throws it over (the victim) with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 8),
'With the noose of sacred order I bind thee, O oblation to the gods!'
for that rope, forsooth, is Varu*n*a's: therefore he thus binds it with
the noose of sacred order, and thus that rope of Varu*n*a does not
injure it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:2">3:7:4:2</span></span>2. 'Be
bold, O man <span id="fr_458"></span>[1](#fn_456)!' for at first man
dared not <span id="fr_459"></span>[2](#fn_457) to approach it (the
victim); but now that he thus binds it with the noose of sacred order,
as an oblation to the gods, man dares to approach it: therefore he says,
'Be bold, O man!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:3">3:7:4:3</span></span>3. He
then binds it (to the stake) with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 9), 'At the impulse of
the divine Savit*ri*, I bind thee with the arms of the A*s*vins, with
the hands of Pûshan, thee agreeable to Agni and Soma!' Even as on that
occasion <span id="fr_460"></span>[3](#fn_458), when taking out an
oblation for a deity, he assigns it, so does he now assign it to the two
deities. He then sprinkles it,--one and the same, forsooth, is the

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

significance of sprinkling: he thereby makes it sacrificially pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:4">3:7:4:4</span></span>4. He
sprinkles with, 'For the waters--thee, for the plants!' whereby it (the
victim) exists, thereby he thus makes it sacrificially pure. For when it
rains, then plants are produced here on earth; and by eating plants and
drinking water that sap originates, and from sap seed, and from seed
beasts: hence whereby it exists, wherefrom it springs, thereby he thus
makes it sacrificially pure.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:5">3:7:4:5</span></span>5. 'May
thy mother grant thee permission, and thy father--;' for it is from its
mother and father that it is born: hence wherefrom it is born, thereby
he thus makes it sacrificially pure; '--thine own brother, thy fellow in
the herd;' whereby he means to say, 'whatever kin there is of thine,
with their approval I slay thee.' 'I sprinkle thee, agreeable to Agni
and Soma;' he thus makes it pure for those two deities for whom he slays
it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:6">3:7:4:6</span></span>6. With
(Vâ*g*. S. VI, 10), 'Thou art a drinker of water,' he then holds (the
lustral water) under (its mouth), whereby he renders it internally pure.
He then sprinkles it underneath (the body), with, 'May the divine waters
make it palatable, a true palatable offering to the gods!' he thus makes
it sacrificially pure all over.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:7">3:7:4:7</span></span>7.
Thereupon he says (to the Hot*ri*), 'Recite to the fire being kindled!'
when he has made the second libation of ghee <span
id="fr_461"></span>[1](#fn_459), and returned (to his former place)
without letting the two spoons touch one another <span
id="fr_462"></span>[2](#fn_460), he anoints the victim with the (ghee in
the)

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

*g*uhû, For the second libation is the head of the sacrifice, and the
sacrifice here indeed is that victim: hence he thereby puts the head on
the sacrifice and therefore anoints the victim with the *g*uhû.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:8">3:7:4:8</span></span>8. With
'May thy breath unite with the wind!' he anoints it on the forehead;
with 'Thy limbs with those worthy of sacrifice' on the shoulders; with
'The lord of sacrifice with (the object of) his prayer!' the loins;
whereby he means to say, 'For whatsoever object the animal is slain, do
thou obtain that!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:9">3:7:4:9</span></span>9. For,
indeed, the breath of the victim when slain here passes into the wind:
'Obtain thou that thy breath may pass into the wind!' is what he thereby
means to say. 'Thy limbs with those worthy of offering' he says, because
it is with its limbs that they sacrifice: 'Obtain thou that they may
sacrifice with thy limbs' is what he thereby means to say. 'The lord of
sacrifice with his prayer,' hereby they invoke a blessing on the
sacrificer: 'Obtain thou that through thee they may invoke a blessing on
the sacrificer' is what he thereby means to say. He then deposits the
two spoons and calls for the *S*rausha*t* with a view to the Pravara
(election of the Hot*ri*) <span id="fr_463"></span>[1](#fn_461). The
significance of this is the same (as before).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:10">3:7:4:10</span></span>10.
Thereupon he calls a second time for the Srausha*t*, for on this
occasion there are two Hot*ri*s it is with regard to the
Maitrâvaru*n*a <span id="fr_464"></span>[2](#fn_462) that he now calls
for the *S*rausha*t*. But it is the sacrificer whom

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

he chooses, saying, 'Verily, Agni is the leader of the divine hosts,'
for Agni is the head of the deities; wherefore he says, 'Verily, Agni is
the leader of the divine hosts;'--'this sacrificer of the human;' for
that community wherein he sacrifices is behind (inferior to) him;
wherefore he says, 'This sacrificer (is the head) of the human.' 'May
the household of these two shine brightly, not (like a cart yoked) with
one bullock, for a hundred winters,--two yoke-fellows!' whereby he means
to say, 'May their household matters be free from calamities for a
hundred years <span id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_463).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:7:4:11">3:7:4:11</span></span>11.
'Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies;' whereby he means to say, 'Unite
ye your blessings only, but not also your bodies;' for were they also to
unite their bodies, Agni (the fire) would burn the sacrificer. Now when
this one sacrifices in the fire, he gives gifts to Agni; and whatever
blessing the priests here invoke upon the sacrificer, all that Agni
accomplishes. Thus they unite only their blessings, but not also their
bodies: wherefore he says, 'Uniting blessings, not uniting bodies.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_456"></span>[181:1](sbe2630.htm#fr_458) Thus the author
appears to take the formula 'dharshâ mấnusha*h*.' It would rather seem
to mean, 'Be bold: \[I am (or he, the slaughterer, is)\] a man.'
Mahîdhara interprets, 'May he (the *S*amit*ri*) be bold enough!' Either
the Kâ*n*va reading 'dharshân mânusha*h*' or that of the Taittirîyas
'dharshâ mânushân' would seem preferable.

<span id="fn_457"></span>[181:2](sbe2630.htm#fr_459) The Kâ*n*va text
has 'dh*ri*sh*n*oti' for 'adh*ri*sh*n*ot,' which renders it more simple:
'At first the man (the slaughterer) dares not approach it, but when he
thus binds it, &c.'

<span id="fn_458"></span>[181:3](sbe2630.htm#fr_460) Viz. at the
Havirya*gñ*a; see I, 1, 2, 17.

performance, see I, 3, 5, 1 seq.; I, 4, 4, 1 seq.

(also note to part i, p. 115).

<span id="fn_462"></span>[183:2](sbe2630.htm#fr_464) The Maitrâvaru*n*a
or Pra*s*âst*ri* is the Hot*ri*'s chief assistant. He receives, as the
badge of his office, the stall which the sacrificer <span
id="page_184">p. 184</span> held while he was consecrated, and has, at
the instance of the Adhvaryu, to call on the Hot*ri* for the
offering-prayers,--his summons (praisha) beginning with Hotâ yakshat,
'let the Hot*ri* worship or, pronounce the offering-prayer) . . .,'--and
occasionally himself to pronounce the invitatory prayer.

<span id="fn_463"></span>[184:1](sbe2630.htm#fr_465) See I, 9, 3, 79.
