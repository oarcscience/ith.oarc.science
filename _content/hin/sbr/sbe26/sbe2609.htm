Now while the gods were spreading (performing) the sacrifice on this (earth) they excluded her (the earth) from the sacrifice. She thought, 'How is it that, in spreading the sacrifice on me, they should exclude me from the sacrifice?' and confounded their sacrifice: they knew not that sacrifice.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:2">3:2:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. They said, 'How comes it that our sacrifice was confounded, when we spread it on this (earth)? how is it that we know it not?'</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:4">3:2:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. They said, 'When we were spreading the sacrifice on thee, how was it that it became confounded, that we know it not?'</p>

She said, 'While spreading the sacrifice on me, ye have excluded me from the sacrifice: that was why I have confounded your sacrifice.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:6">3:2:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. 'So be it!' said the gods: 'Thine, forsooth, shall be the opening (pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), and thine the concluding (udayan&icirc;ya) oblation!' This is why both the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya and the Udayan&icirc;ya (pap) belong</p>

<p><A NAME="page_49"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 49</FONT></A></p>  
<p>to Aditi; for Aditi truly is this (earth). Thereupon they saw and spread the sacrifice.</p>

Hence, when he prepares the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya rice-pap for Aditi, he does so for the purpose of his seeing the sacrifice: 'After seeing the sacrifice I shall buy (the Soma) and spread that (sacrifice);' thus thinking he prepares the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya pap for Aditi. The sacrificial food had been prepared, but offering had not yet been made to the deity (Aditi),--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:8">3:2:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. When Pathy&acirc; Svasti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> appeared to them. They offered to her, for Pathy&acirc; Svasti (the wishing of 'a happy journey') is speech, and the sacrifice also is speech. Thereby they perceived the sacrifice and spread it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:9">3:2:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. Thereupon Agni appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they perceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Agni's nature. Now of Agni's nature is what is dry in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived and spread.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:10">3:2:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Then Soma appeared to them: they offered to him; whereby they perceived that part of the sacrifice which was of Soma's nature. Now of Soma's nature is what is moist in the sacrifice: that they thereby perceived and spread.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:11">3:2:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Then Savit<I>ri</I> appeared to them: they offered to him. Now Savit<I>ri</I> represents cattle, and the sacrifice also means cattle: hence they thereby perceived and spread the sacrifice. Thereupon they offered to the deity (Aditi), for whom the sacrificial food had been prepared.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:12">3:2:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. It is to these same five deities, then, that he offers. For that sacrifice, when thrown into disorder,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_50"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 50</FONT></A></p>  
<p>was in five parts; and by means of those five deities they recognised it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:13">3:2:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. The seasons became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities they recognised them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:14">3:2:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. The regions became confounded, the five: by means of those same five deities they recognised them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:15">3:2:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. Through Pathy&acirc; Svasti they recognised the northern (upper) region: wherefore speech sounds higher here&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_128"></A><A HREF="#fn_127"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> among the Kuru-Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>&acirc;las; for she (Pathy&acirc; Svasti) is in reality speech, and through her they recognised the northern region, and to her belongs the northern region.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:16">3:2:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. Through Agni they recognised the eastern region: wherefore they take out Agni from behind towards the east&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_129"></A><A HREF="#fn_128"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and render homage to him; for through him they recognised the eastern region, and to him belongs the eastern region.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:17">3:2:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. Through Soma they recognised the southern region: hence, after the Soma has been bought, they drive it round on the south side; and hence they say that Soma is sacred to the Fathers; for through him they recognised the southern region, and to him belongs the southern region.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:18">3:2:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. Through Savit<I>ri</I> they recognised the western region, for Savit<I>ri</I> is yonder burning (sun): wherefore he goes towards the west, for through him they recognised the western region, and to him belongs the western region.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:19">3:2:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. Through Aditi they recognised the upper region, for Aditi is this (earth): wherefore the plants and trees grow upwards on her; for through her they recognised the upper region, and to her belongs the upper region.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:20">3:2:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. The hospitable reception&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_130"></A><A HREF="#fn_129"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (of King Soma) verily is the head of the sacrifice, and the opening and closing oblations are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of the head, and hence those two oblations, the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya and Udayan&icirc;ya, are made on both sides of (before and after) the reception.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:21">3:2:3:21</A></FONT></span>21. Now, they say that whatever is done at the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya should be done at the Udayan&icirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the barhis (grass-covering of the altar), which is used at the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya, is also used at the Udayan&icirc;ya: he lays it aside, after removing it (from the altar). The pot (in which the rice-pap was cooked) he puts aside with the parched remains of dough, and (so he does) the pot-ladle after wiping it. And the priests who officiate during the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya, officiate also at the Udayan&icirc;ya. And because of this identical performance at the sacrifice the two arms are alike and of the same shape.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:22">3:2:3:22</A></FONT></span>22. But let him not do it in this way. Let him rather&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (at the proper time) throw both the barhis and the pot-ladle after (the prastara, into the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>), and let him put the pot aside after rinsing it. The priests who officiate during the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya, officiate also at the Udayan&icirc;ya; but should they (in the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_52"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 52</FONT></A></p>  
<p>mean time) have departed this life, others may officiate instead. It is because he offers to the same deities, and the same oblations, that the two arms are alike and of the same shape.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:2:3:23">3:2:3:23</A></FONT></span>23. To five deities he offers at the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya, and to five at the Udayan&icirc;ya: hence there are five fingers here and five there. This (Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya offering) ends with the <I>S</I>amyu. They perform no Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. For the arms are on the fore-part of the body, and the fore-part of the sacrifice he perfects by this (opening ceremony). This is why it ends with the <I>S</I>amyu, and why no Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as are performed.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_125"></A><A HREF="sbe2609.htm#fr_126">48:1</A> At <a href="sbe2660.htm#4:5:1:2">IV, 5, 1, 2</A>, the name pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya is derived from pra-i, to go forth, because by means of this offering they, as it were, go forth to buy the Soma. Similarly, udayan&icirc;ya is explained as the offering he performs after coming out (ud-i) from the bath. In Ait. Br. I, 7, on the other hand, the name pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya is explained as that by means of which sacrificers go forward (pra-i) to the heavenly world. In the Soma sacrifice, the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; and Udayan&icirc;y&acirc; may be said to correspond to the Fore-offerings and After-offerings (pray&acirc;<I>g</I>a and anuy&acirc;<I>g</I>a) of the New and Full-moon Sacrifice; though, of course, the Fore- and After-offerings form part of the pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; and udayan&icirc;y&acirc;, as ish<I>t</I>is. But they are peculiar in this respect, that offering is made at both to the very same deities, and that the invitatory prayers (anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;) of the pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;yesh<I>t</I>i form the offering-prayers (y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;) of the udayan&icirc;yesh<I>t</I>i, and vice vers&acirc;. For these formulas, see &Acirc;<I>s</I>val. <I>S</I>rautas. IV, 3; Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 16. The offering formula of the oblation to Aditi at the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; (and invitatory formula at the Udayan&icirc;y&acirc;), strange to say, is not a <I>Ri</I>k-verse, but one from the Atharvan (VII, 6, 2).</P>
