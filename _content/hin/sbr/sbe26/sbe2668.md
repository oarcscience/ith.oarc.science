### NINTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:1">4:5:9:1</span></span>1. When
he performs a twelve days’ sacrifice with transposed metres (Dvâda*s*âha
vyû*dh*a*kh*andas), then he (the Adhvaryu) transposes the grahas (cups
of Soma); and both the Udgât*ri* and the Hot*ri* transpose the metres.
Now there is first that normal Tryaha (triduum), with settled
metres <span id="fr_976"></span>[1](#fn_970): there he draws the cup
beginning with the Aindravâyava.

<span id="page_419">p. 419</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:2">4:5:9:2</span></span>2. Then,
on the fourth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the
metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Âgraya*n*a,--for that
fourth day is Pra*g*âpati's own; and the Âgraya*n*a is the self, and
Pra*g*âpati is the self: therefore he draws the cups beginning with the
Âgraya*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:3">4:5:9:3</span></span>3. Having
drawn that (Âgraya*n*a) cup, he does not deposit it--the grahas being
the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs <span
id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_971); for he would indeed disorder the vital
airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup) <span
id="fr_978"></span>[2](#fn_972); and (the Adhvaryu) draws (the other)
cups; and while he draws the cups, then whenever the time of that cup
(in the order of performance comes), he utters 'Hi*m*' and deposits it.
Then follows that normal <span id="fr_979"></span>[3](#fn_973) fifth
day; on that he draws the cups beginning with the Aindravâyava.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:4">4:5:9:4</span></span>4.
Thereupon, on the sixth day, he transposes the grahas, and they
transpose the metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the
*S*ukra; for that sixth day is Indra's own, and the *S*ukra (bright,
clear) is he that burns yonder, and he (the sun) indeed is Indra:
therefore he draws the cups beginning with the *S*ukra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:5">4:5:9:5</span></span>5. Having
drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital
airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed
disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near

<span id="page_420">p. 420</span>

holding that (cup); and he draws (the other) cups; and while he draws
the cups, then whenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:6">4:5:9:6</span></span>6. Then,
on the seventh day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the
metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the *S*ukra cup; for that
seventh day belongs to the B*ri*hatî ('great' metre); for the *S*ukra is
he that burns yonder, and he indeed is great: therefore he draws the
cups beginning with the *S*ukra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:7">4:5:9:7</span></span>7. Having
drawn that (cup), he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital
airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed
disorder the vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding
that (cup); and he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups,
then whenever the time of that (cup comes), he deposits it. Then follows
that normal eighth day: there he draws the cups beginning with the
Aindravâyava.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:8">4:5:9:8</span></span>8. Then,
on the ninth day, he transposes the grahas, and they transpose the
metres. There he draws the cups beginning with the Âgraya*n*a; for that
ninth day belongs to the *G*agatî (metre), and the Âgraya*n*a is the
self, and the self (soul) is this whole world (*g*agat): therefore he
draws the cups beginning with the Âgraya*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:9">4:5:9:9</span></span>9. Having
drawn it, he does not deposit it--the grahas being the vital airs--lest
he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed disorder the
vital airs, were he to deposit it. They sit near holding that (cup); and
he draws the (other) cups; and while he draws the cups, when the time of
that (cup comes), he utters 'Hi*m*' and deposits it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:10">4:5:9:10</span></span>10. Now
they say, He should not transpose the

<span id="page_421">p. 421</span>

cups--the cups being the vital airs--lest he should disorder the vital
airs; for he would indeed disorder the vital airs, were he to transpose
them: therefore he should not transpose (the cups).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:11">4:5:9:11</span></span>11. But
let him, nevertheless, transpose them; for the cups are the limbs, and
in sleeping one likes to turn <span id="fr_980"></span>[1](#fn_974) his
limbs from one side to the other: therefore let him nevertheless
transpose them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:12">4:5:9:12</span></span>12.
Nevertheless, he should not transpose them--the cups being the vital
airs--lest he should disorder the vital airs; for he would indeed
disorder the vital airs, were he to transpose (the cups): therefore let
him not transpose them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:5:9:13">4:5:9:13</span></span>13.
What, then, is the Adhvaryu to do in that case, when both the Udgât*ri*
and Hot*ri* transpose (change) the metres <span
id="fr_981"></span>[2](#fn_975)? In that, at the morning pressing, he
draws first the Aindravâyava cup; and at the midday pressing the *S*ukra
cup; and at the evening pressing the Âgraya*n*a cup,--thereby forsooth
the Adhvaryu transposes (the cups).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_970"></span>[418:1](sbe2668.htm#fr_976) That is, three
days, on which the order of the Agnish*t*oma is observed. Hence, having
drawn the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma cups ([IV, 1, 1](sbe2640.htm#4:1:1) and
[2](sbe2641.htm#4:1:2)), which must always be drawn first, he draws the
Aindravâyava cup ([IV, 1, 3](sbe2642.htm#4:1:3)) and so on. The same
order is preserved on the fifth, eighth, and last three days. On the
fourth and ninth days, on the other hand, he follows up the Upâ*ms*u and
Antaryâma by the grahas of the third pressing, beginning with the
Âgraya*n*a ([IV, 3, 5, 21](sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:21) seq.); these being then
succeeded by those of the morning and midday pressings; and on the sixth
and seventh days the Upâ*ms*u and Antaryâma cups are succeeded by the
grahas of the midday pressing, beginning with the *S*ukra cup ([IV, 3,
3, 2](sbe2652.htm#4:3:3:2)). This change of the proper order of
performance, of course, involves a different arrangement of the stotras
and *s*astras (or 'the metres,' as they are called in the texts). This
dislocation of the three pressings is afterwards to be rectified by the
various cups being 'deposited' on the khara in their normal order. In
the [last two paragraphs](sbe2668.htm#4:5:9:12) of the present
Brâhma*n*a the author, however, <span id="page_419">p. 419</span>
discountenances this practice of changing the natural order of drawing
the cups.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[419:1](sbe2668.htm#fr_977) For this
construction see [p. 15](sbe2605.htm#page_15), note
[3](sbe2605.htm#fn_55).

<span id="fn_972"></span>[419:2](sbe2668.htm#fr_978) 'Having given it to
some one else (to hold), he draws the other cups.' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[419:3](sbe2668.htm#fr_979) Or, that 'known'
fifth day, i.e. performed in the manner known, or explained before (viz.
at the Agnish*t*oma).

<span id="fn_974"></span>[421:1](sbe2668.htm#fr_980) In the text our
subordinate clause is, as usual, the principal clause: 'one sleeps in
turning his limbs from one side to the other.'

<span id="fn_975"></span>[421:2](sbe2668.htm#fr_981) The chanters and
the Hot*ri* in any case use different metres, as the principal ones, at
different pressings.
