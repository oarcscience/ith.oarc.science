### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:1">4:2:1:1</span></span>1. The
*S*ukra and Manthin (grahas), forsooth, are his eyes. Now the *S*ukra,
indeed, is he that burns yonder (the sun); and because it burns
there <span id="fr_674"></span>[3](#fn_672), therefore it is (called)
*S*ukra ('bright'). And the Manthin, indeed, is the moon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:2">4:2:1:2</span></span>2. He
mixes it with (barley) meal: thus he makes it to be gruel (mantha),
whence it is (called) Manthin. Now those two (sun and moon); forsooth,
are the eyes of these creatures; for were those two not to rise, these
(creatures) could not distinguish even their own hands.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:3">4:2:1:3</span></span>3. One of
them is the eater, and the other the

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

food <span id="fr_675"></span>[1](#fn_673); to wit, the *S*ukra is the
eater, and the Manthin the food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:4">4:2:1:4</span></span>4. To one
of them corresponds the eater, and to the other the food; to wit, the
eater corresponds to the *S*ukra, and the food to the Manthin. Now these
two (cups) are drawn for one (person) and offered to another. There are
two Asura-Rakshas, *S*a*nd*a and Marka: for them they are drawn; and to
deities they are offered. The reason for this is as follows.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:5">4:2:1:5</span></span>5. Now
when the gods drove away the Asura-Rakshas, they could not drive away
these two; but whatever (sacrificial) work the gods performed, that
these two disturbed, and then quickly fled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:6">4:2:1:6</span></span>6. The
gods then said, 'Contrive ye how we shall drive away these two!' They
said, 'Let us draw two cups (of Soma juice) for them: they will come
down to us, and we shall seize them and drive them away.' They
accordingly drew two cups (of Soma) for them, and they both came down,
and, having seized them, they (the gods) drove them away <span
id="fr_676"></span>[2](#fn_674). This is why (the two cups) are drawn
for *S*a*nd*a and Marka, but are offered to deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:7">4:2:1:7</span></span>7. Also
Yâ*gñ*avalkya said, 'Should we not rather draw them for the deities,
since that is, as it were, the sign of conquest <span
id="fr_677"></span>[3](#fn_675)?' In this, however, he merely
speculated, but he did not practise it.

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:8">4:2:1:8</span></span>8. Now
some make this the puroru*k* formula of the *S*ukra, 'He, the longing,
light-enveloped, urged the daughters of the dappled (cloud) along the
measurer of the welkin,'--saying, 'We thus make it like him that burns
yonder, in that he says "the light-enveloped."'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:9">4:2:1:9</span></span>9. But
let him make this one the puroru*k* formula of the *S*ukra (Vâ*g*. S.
VII, 12; Rig-veda V, 44, I), 'In the olden way, in the former way, in
every way, in this way (drawest thou) supremacy from him, the
barhis-seated, and the bliss-attaining,'--for the eater corresponds to
this (*S*ukra cup), and the eater is supreme hence he says, 'Supremacy
from him, the barhis-seated, bliss-attaining,'--and onward strength
drawest thou from him, the roaring <span
id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_676), the swift, that winneth those <span
id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_677) through which thou waxest strong.--Thou
art taken with a support: thee for *S*a*nd*a!'--With 'This is thy womb:
protect manhood!' he deposits (the cup); for to this one corresponds the
eater, and the man (hero) is the eater: hence he says, 'This is thy
womb: protect manhood!' He deposits it on the south part (of the mount),
for it is in that direction that yonder (sun) moves.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:10">4:2:1:10</span></span>10.
Thereupon he draws the Manthin with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 16;

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rig-veda X, 123,
1), 'He, the longing <span id="fr_680"></span>[1](#fn_678),
light-enveloped <span id="fr_681"></span>[2](#fn_679), urged the
daughters of the dappled <span id="fr_682"></span>[3](#fn_680) on the
measurer of the welkin <span id="fr_683"></span>[4](#fn_681): him the
bards kiss like a child with songs at the union of the waters and the
sun.--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Marka!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:11">4:2:1:11</span></span>11. He
mixes it with (barley) meal: the reason why he mixes it with meal is
this. Varu*n*a once struck king Soma right in the eye, and it swelled
(a*s*vayat): therefrom a horse (a*s*va) sprung; and because it sprung
from a swelling, therefore it is called a*s*va. A tear of his fell down:
therefrom the barley sprung; whence they say that the barley belongs to
Varu*n*a. Thus whatever part of his eye was injured on that occasion in
(that part he now restores him and makes him whole by means of this
(barley): therefore he mixes (the libation) with meal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:12">4:2:1:12</span></span>12. He
mixes it with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 17; Rig-veda X, 61, 3), 'At whichever
offerings ye two, rushing swiftly as thought, accept with favour the
songs--he, the manly, who by the reeds of this (one) hath seasoned <span
id="fr_684"></span>[5](#fn_682) in the hand the

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (object of his)
desire;'--with 'This is thy womb: protect the creatures!' he deposits it
(on the north part of the mound); for to this (graha) corresponds the
food, and these creatures, the people, are food: hence he says, 'This is
thy womb: protect the creatures!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:13">4:2:1:13</span></span>13.
There are two sprinkled and two unsprinkled chips of the sacrificial
stake <span id="fr_685"></span>[1](#fn_683): the Adhvaryu takes a
sprinkled and an unsprinkled one; and in like manner the
Pratiprasthât*ri* takes a sprinkled and an unsprinkled one. And the
Adhvaryu takes the *S*ukra, the Pratiprasthât*ri* the Manthin.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:14">4:2:1:14</span></span>14. The
Adhvaryu cleanses (his cup) with the unsprinkled chip, with, Swept away
is *S*a*nd*a!' In like manner the Pratiprasthât*ri* with, 'Swept away is
Marka!' Thus even while drawing (the cups), they drive away the two
Asura-Rakshas. With 'May the *S*ukra-sipping gods lead thee forward!'
the Adhvaryu walks out (of the cart-shed); with 'May the Manthin-sipping
gods lead thee forward!' the Pratiprasthât*ri*: thus they lead forward
those two (libations) to the deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:15">4:2:1:15</span></span>15.
Behind the Âhavanîya fire they put their (right) elbows together, and
deposit (the cups) on the high altar: the Adhvaryu on the right hip, and
the Pratiprasthât*ri* on the left--without quitting their hold of
them--with 'Unassailable art

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

thou!' whereby they make the high altar unassailable by evil spirits;
for they are about, in walking round it, to pass by the fire: hereby,
then, they propitiate it, and so the fire does not injure them, while
they walk round it on different sides <span
id="fr_686"></span>[1](#fn_684).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:16">4:2:1:16</span></span>16. The
Adhvaryu walks round it (on the north side) with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 13),
'Abounding in heroes, producing heroes'--for to this (libation)
corresponds the eater, and the hero is the eater: hence he says,
'Abounding in heroes, producing heroes!'--'encompass thou <span
id="fr_687"></span>[2](#fn_685) the sacrificer with growth of wealth!'
By saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he
invokes a blessing upon the sacrificer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:17">4:2:1:17</span></span>17. And
the Pratiprasthât*ri* walks round (on the south side) with (Vâ*g*. S.
VII, 18), 'Abounding in creatures, producing creatures'--for to this
(libation) corresponds the food, and the creatures, the people, are the
food: hence he says, 'Abounding in creatures, producing
creatures,'--'encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' By
saying 'Encompass thou the sacrificer with growth of wealth!' he invokes
a blessing on the sacrificer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:18">4:2:1:18</span></span>18.
They step out (from the altar) after closing the two (cups with their
hands): thereby they make them invisible; whence no one sees yonder sun
and moon when they go forward (eastwards). Having gone round to the
front (of the stake), they uncover (the cups), and offer them while
standing in front: thereby they make them visible; whence every one

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

sees yonder sun and moon when they go backwards. Hence also no one sees
the seed which is cast forwards, but every one sees what is produced
backwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:19">4:2:1:19</span></span>19.
They put their elbows together behind the sacrificial stake, unless the
fire should blaze up <span id="fr_688"></span>[1](#fn_686); but. if the
fire blaze up, they may join their elbows in front of the stake,--the
Adhvaryu with, 'The *S*ukra (bright), uniting with the sky, with the
earth, with the brightly shining;' the Pratiprasthât*ri* with, 'The
Manthin, uniting with the sky, with the earth, with the
manthin-shining.' Thus they make these two (cups) the resting-places of
the eyes, and join the two eyes together: whence these two eyes are
joined together with bones all round <span
id="fr_689"></span>[2](#fn_687).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:20">4:2:1:20</span></span>20. The
Adhvaryu throws the unsprinkled stake-chip outside (the altar) with,
'Cast out is *S*a*nd*a!' and in like manner the Pratiprasthât*ri* with,
'Cast out is Marka!' Thus they drive away the two Asura-Rakshas before
the offerings.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:21">4:2:1:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon the Adhvaryu throws the sprinkled stake-chip on the Âhavanîya
with, 'Thou art the abode of the *S*ukra!' and in like manner the
Pratiprasthât*ri* with, 'Thou art the abode of the Manthin!' These two
(chips), forsooth, are the kindlers of the eyes,--he kindles the eyes
therewith; whence these eyes are kindled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:22">4:2:1:22</span></span>22.
Thereon he mutters (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 14), 'May

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

we be the preservers of thine unbroken manhood and prosperity, O divine
Soma!' This is the benediction of that performance: he thereby invokes a
blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:23">4:2:1:23</span></span>23. He
then calls (on the Agnîdh) for the *S*rausha*t*, and says, 'Urge thou
for Indra the Soma-draughts brought forward, the pure, sweet-flowing, of
the morrow's morning feast!' As the Vasha*t* is uttered, the Adhvaryu
offers; then the Pratiprasthât*ri*; then the cup-bearers
(*k*amasâdhvaryu).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:24">4:2:1:24</span></span>24.
Those two offer while standing in front (of the fire); for these two
(libations) are the eyes: thus they put those eyes in the front; and
hence these eyes are in the front.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:25">4:2:1:25</span></span>25.
They offer while standing on both sides of the stake; for what the nose
is, that is the sacrificial stake: hence these two eyes are on both
sides of the nose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:26">4:2:1:26</span></span>26.
Being consecrated by Vasha*t*, these two (libations) are offered with a
prayer. Now it is because the entire Savana is offered after these two
(libations) that they attain to this (distinction) <span
id="fr_690"></span>[1](#fn_688); and the reason why the entire Savana is
offered after them, is that they are most distinctly Pra*g*âpati's own:
for they are the eyes, and the eye is the truth, and Pra*g*âpati is the
truth;--this is why the entire Savana is offered after them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:27">4:2:1:27</span></span>27. He
offers with,' This is the first consecration, assuring all boons: he is
the first, Varu*n*a,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mitra, Agni;--he
is the first, B*ri*haspati, the wise: to that Indra offer ye the liquor,
Hail <span id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_689)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:28">4:2:1:28</span></span>28. Now
when he offers with, 'This is the first--he is the first,' it is just as
with cast seed; for the eyes doubtless are formed first <span
id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_690) hence he offers with, 'This is the
first--he is the first'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:29">4:2:1:29</span></span>29. He
then gives directions:--'Let the Hot*ri*'s cup advance! let the
Brahman's, the Chanters’, the Sacrificer's (cups) advance! Ye
cup-bearers of the fire-priests <span id="fr_693"></span>[3](#fn_691),
approach and fill up (the cups) with pure Soma!'--this is a composite
direction. Having gone round (to behind the high altar) the
Pratiprasthât*ri* pours his residue (of Soma) into the Adhvaryu's
(*S*ukra) vessel; whereby he makes the food pay tribute to the eater.
The Adhvaryu pours it into the Hot*ri*'s cup for drinking; because the
draught belongs to the utterer of the Vasha*t*; for the Vasha*t* is the
breath, and that breath has, as it were, departed from him while
uttering the Vasha*t*. Now the draught is breath: thus he puts that
breath back into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:30">4:2:1:30</span></span>30. And
the reason why they do not take those

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

two (cups) behind <span id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_692), but do so take
the other cups, is that those two are the eyes. The residue (of Soma),
then, he pours into the Hot*ri*'s cup.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:31">4:2:1:31</span></span>31.
They now fill up the cups of the fire-priests. For those residues <span
id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_693) are remains of oblations, insufficient
for offering: he now fills them up again, and thus they become
sufficient for offering: therefore they fill up the cups of the
fire-priests.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:32">4:2:1:32</span></span>32.
Thereupon they make the fire-priests offer together <span
id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_694). Now the fire-priests combined convey

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

the sacrifice to the gods,--it is them he thereby satisfies together,
thinking, 'Satisfied and pleased they shall convey the sacrifice to the
gods;' therefore they make the fire-priests offer together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:2:1:33">4:2:1:33</span></span>33.
When (the libation of) the first, or last <span
id="fr_697"></span>[1](sbe2646.htm#fn_695) fire-priest has been offered,
he addresses them (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 15), 'Let the priests’ offices be
satisfied, they that have obtained a good sacrifice of sweet drink; they
that are well-pleased, when they have obtained good offering with
Svâhâ!' for this is the satisfaction of the priests’ (offices).
Thereupon he approaches (to the Hot*ri*'s hearth) and sits down with his
face to the west, with 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed!' for on this
occasion the Agnîdh sacrifices last of those that sacrifice: hence he
says, 'The Agnîdh hath sacrificed.'

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_672"></span>[278:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_674) This is how
Sâya*n*a takes the passage: *s*ukragrahas tapati *s*o*k*ati dîpyata iti
tasya *s*ukranâmadheyam. It is doubtless the correct interpretation,
though the pronouns 'esha' and 'etad' might lead one to refer them to
the sun.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[279:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_675) The one that is to
be eaten (âdya*h*).

<span id="fn_674"></span>[279:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_676) Muir, O. S. T. ii,
p. 386, translates apa-han by 'to smite,' which would seem to suit this
passage much better than the ordinary meaning 'to beat off, repulse,
eject;' but see paragraph [20](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:20). The corresponding
version of the legend in Taitt. S. VI, 4, 10 has 'apa-nud (to drive
away).'

<span id="fn_675"></span>[279:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_677) Thus this passage
is interpreted by Sâya*n*a, who refers to Pâ*n*. III, 3, 161
(sampra*s*ne liṅ) and VIII, 2, 97 (vi*k*âryamâ*n*ânâm <span
id="page_280">p. 280</span> pluta*h*). Possibly, however, 'no svid' many
have to be separated from what follows: 'by no means! for deities we
should draw them,' &c. The Kâ*n*va text reads, 'no svit khalu devatâbhya
eva g*ri*h*n*iyâmeti vidita*m* hîdam iti, tad u tan mîmâ*m*sâm eva
*k*akre nety u ta*k* *k*akâra.'

<span id="fn_676"></span>[280:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_678) The Rig-veda reads
'girâ (through song)' instead of 'dhunim.'

<span id="fn_677"></span>[280:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_679) Viz. waters, juice,
sap. Professor Ludwig supplies 'plants.' This verse is extremely
obscure.

<span id="fn_678"></span>[281:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_680) Vena, according to
Roth and Grassmann, refers to the Gandharva, as the representative of
the rainbow. This view is, however, rejected by Ludwig. The entire hymn
is extremely and purposely obscure.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[281:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_681) *G*yotir-*g*arâyu,
lit. 'having light for his chorion, or placenta.'

<span id="fn_680"></span>[281:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_682) P*ris*nigarbhâ*h*,
lit. 'those who have the dappled (cloud) for their womb (or, are
contained therein);' apparently the rain-drops.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[281:4](sbe2645.htm#fr_683) Ludwig identifies
the measurer of the welkin with the moon (Soma). Grassmann takes it in
the sense of 'in measuring through the air.'

<span id="fn_682"></span>[281:5](sbe2645.htm#fr_684) The verse is
manifestly corrupt. Professor Ludwig omits the accent in 'a*s*rî*n*îta,'
thus taking it out of the relative clause; but <span id="page_282">p.
282</span> even thus, no satisfactory sense, it seems to me, can be
extracted from this line. When the Soma is mixed with milk or some other
substance (as meal) two stalks of (ku*s*a) reed-grass are laid on the
cup, the accessory substance being then poured through them. Kâty. IX,
6, 9-10.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[282:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_685) In paragraphs
[13](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:13)-[31](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:31) the libations from
the *S*ukra and Manthin cups are anticipated. For their proper place in
the actual performance, see note to [IV, 3, 1, 1](sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:1).

<span id="fn_684"></span>[283:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_686) The Petersburg
Dictionary takes 'vi-pari-i' in the sense of to turn round.' Cf. Kâty.
IX, 10, 8; 'vividha*m* dakshi*n*a uttarata*s* *k*a paribhogam ishyantau
(!),' Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[283:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_687) Or, 'walk round to
the sacrificer.'

<span id="fn_686"></span>[284:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_688) The sacrificial
stake stands immediately in front of the high altar and fire. 'Yadi tato
’gnir nodbâdheta,' Kâ*n*va text.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[284:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_689) That is, the cups
represent the sockets of the eyes, and the libations the eyes
themselves. Perhaps, however, we ought to translate, 'whence these eyes
are joined together (so as to be) on both sides of the bone,' the
sacrificial stake representing the bone or bridge of the nose. See
[paragraph 25](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:25).

<span id="fn_688"></span>[285:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_690) 'And because these
two (libations), having been consecrated by Vasha*t*, are offered with a
mantra, therefore they attain this (distinction) that the entire Savana
is offered after them; and the reason why the entire Savana is offered
after them, is that these two are its eyes,' &c.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[286:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_691) Or, according to
Mahîdhara, 'To that Indra offer ye the liquor with Svâhâ!' The
Pratiprasthât*ri* makes his libation after the Adhvaryu. The Kâ*n*va
texts read, 'When the Vasha*t* has been uttered, the Adhvaryu offers,
then the Pratiprasthât*ri*; then the others offer;' and, according to
Kâty. IX, II, 2, the *K*amasâdhvaryus make libations from the cups of
the nine *K*amasins (see note [2](#fn_693), next page) with, 'This to
Indra' at the Vasha*t*, and This to Agni' at the Anu-vasha*t*. These
libations are evidently referred to in paragraph
[31](sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:31).

<span id="fn_690"></span>[286:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_692) ? *S*a*s*vad dha
vai retasa*h* siktasya sambhavata*s* *k*akshushî eva prathame
sambhavatas tasmâd v eva*m* *g*apati; Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[286:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_693) 'Sadasyâna*m*
hotrâ*n*am.' The subordinate priests to whom the dhish*n*yas (except
that of the Hot*ri*) belong, both those in the Sadas and the Âgnîdhra.
See page [148](sbe2623.htm#page_148), note [4](sbe2624.htm#fn_392).

<span id="fn_692"></span>[287:1](sbe2645.htm#fr_694) That is, to the
Sadas, for the priests to drink from.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[287:2](sbe2645.htm#fr_695) Viz. the residues
in the *k*amasas of the Hotrakas. The filling (by the Unnet*ri*) of the
cups of the *K*amasins--Hot*ri*, Brahman, Udgât*ri*, (and Sacrificer);
Pra*s*âst*ri*, Brâhma*n*â*kh*a*m*sin, Pot*ri*, Nesh*tri*, and Âgnîdhra;
that of the A*kh*âvâka remains empty for the present--takes place before
the libations from the *S*ukra and Manthin grahas. Their cups are filled
by the Unnet*ri* with Soma-juice from the Pûtabh*ri*t, with an
'underlayer' and final 'sprinkling' or 'basting' of 'pure' Soma from the
Dro*n*akala*s*a. Previous to the filling, the Adhvaryu calls on the
Maitrâvaru*n*a to 'recite to (those cups) being drawn,' the latter then
reciting the hymn, Rig-veda I, 36, while the cups are filled. When the
*S*rausha*t* is about to be pronounced by the Agnîdh for the *S*ukra and
Manthin libations, the cup-bearers lift (udyam) the cups, and, after the
Pratiprasthât*ri* has made his libation, they also pour some Soma-juice
into the fire. The cup-bearers of the first four *K*amasins do so twice
(and then take their cups back to the Sadas), the others only once.
Thereupon the cup-bearers of these last five--the so-called Hotrakas, or
subordinate Hot*ri*s--are summoned again, and their cups having been
filled up with 'pure' Soma, the Adhvaryu makes, after the *S*rausha*t*,
two more libations from each at the Vasha*t* and Anuvasha*t*
respectively. For the offering-formulas and Anuvasha*t*kâras, see Â*s*v.
V, 5, 18-19. Holding the Agnîdh's cup in his hand, he then goes to the
Sadas and sits down facing the Hot*ri*, whereupon they drink together
the Soma in the dvidevatya cups.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[287:3](sbe2645.htm#fr_696) The phrase
'hotrâ*h* (fem.) sa*m*yâ*g*ayanti' is apparently analogous to the
'patnî*h* sa*m*yâ*g*ayanti' \[they perform the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as, or,
make the wives (of the gods) participate in the sacrifice\] of the <span
id="page_288">p. 288</span> Havirya*gñ*a. See part i, p. 256. Indeed
Mahîdhara identifies the hotrâs with the metres of the
offering-formulas, thus treating them as a kind of deities.
