Thereupon they sit down round the two press-boards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_588"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He (the Adhvaryu) then ties a piece of gold to that (nameless finger). For twofold, verily, is this; there is no third, namely, the truth and the untruth; the gods, forsooth, are the truth, and men are the untruth. And the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: 'With the truth I will touch the stalks, with the truth I will take hold of Soma,' thus he thinks, and therefore he ties a piece of gold to that (ring-finger).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:2">3:9:4:2</A></FONT></span>2. He then takes a press-stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_589"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now those</p>

<p><A NAME="page_239"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 239</FONT></A></p>  
<p>press-stones are of rock, and Soma is a god--for Soma was in the sky, Soma was V<I>ri</I>tra; those mountains, those rocks are his body--he thus perfects him by means of his body, makes him whole; therefore they are of rock. Moreover, in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone, Soma's own body); thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; therefore the press-stones are of rock.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:3">3:9:4:3</A></FONT></span>3. He takes it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 30), 'At the impulse of the divine Savit<I>ri</I> I take thee with the arms of the A<I>s</I>vins, with the hands of P&ucirc;shan; thou art a giver!' For Savit<I>ri</I> is the impeller of the gods; thus he takes it, impelled by Savit<I>ri</I>. 'With the arms of the A<I>s</I>vins,' he says,--the A<I>s</I>vins are the Adhvaryus (of the gods): with their arms he thus takes it, not with his own. 'With the hands of P&ucirc;shan,' he says,--P&ucirc;shan is the distributor of portions: with his hands he thus takes it, not with his own. Moreover, that (stone) is a thunderbolt, and no man can hold it: by means of those deities he takes it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:4">3:9:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. 'I take thee: thou art a giver,' he says; for when they press him by means of that (stone), then there is an oblation; and when he offers an oblation, then he gives sacrificial gifts,--thus, then, that (stone) gives twofold, oblations and sacrificial gifts; wherefore he says, 'Thou art a giver.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:5">3:9:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. 'Perform thou this deep cult!' Cult means sacrifice; he thereby means to say, 'Perform thou this great sacrifice!'--'well-gotten for Indra;' by 'well-gotten' he means to say, 'well-produced;' and Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, wherefore he says, 'for Indra;'--'by the most excellent bolt,'</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_240"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 240</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for he, Soma, is indeed the most excellent bolt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_590"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, therefore he says, 'by the most excellent bolt;'--'the (cult) rich in food and sweetness and drink,' whereby he means to say, 'the (cult) rich in sap.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:6">3:9:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. Thereupon he restrains-speech. For once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They said, 'Let us sacrifice in a low voice, let us restrain speech!' They sacrificed (with formulas muttered) in a low voice and restrained speech.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:7">3:9:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. He then fetches the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc;s (waters), and makes him (the sacrificer) mutter over them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, 'Ye are the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc;s, heard by the gods; satisfy me, satisfy my mind, satisfy my speech, satisfy my breath, satisfy mine eye, satisfy mine ear, satisfy my soul, satisfy mine offspring, satisfy my flocks, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' For water is sap, and over it he invokes this blessing, 'Satisfy ye my whole self, satisfy my offspring, satisfy my followers, let not my followers thirst!' Now that Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>usavana (stone), forsooth, is in reality &Acirc;ditya Vivasvant (the sun), it is the pervading vital air (vy&acirc;na) of this (sacrifice).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:8">3:9:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. Thereon he metes out (the Soma). For in pressing him they slay him, they slay him by means of that (stone); thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> he rises from hence, thus he</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_241"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 241</FONT></A></p>  
<p>lives. And because he metes him out, therefore there is a measure,--both the measure among men&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and what other measure there is.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:9">3:9:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. He metes out with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 32), 'Thee for Indra, with the Vasus, with the Rudras!' For Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'Thee for Indra;' and by saying 'with the Vasus, with the Rudras,' he assigns a share, along with (or after) Indra, to the Vasus and the Rudras.--'Thee for Indra, with the &Acirc;dityas!' whereby he assigns a share to the &Acirc;dityas along with Indra.--'Thee for Indra, the slayer of foes!' a foe is an enemy: 'Thee for Indra, the slayer of enemies,' he means to say. This is his (Indra's) special share: as there is a special share for a chief, so is this his special share apart from the (other) gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:10">3:9:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. 'Thee for the Soma-bearing falcon!' this he metes out for G&acirc;yatr&icirc;.--'Thee for Agni, the bestower of growth of wealth!' Now Agni is G&acirc;yatr&icirc;: he metes this out for G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. And since G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, as a falcon, fetched Soma from heaven, therefore she is (called) the Soma-bearing falcon: for that prowess of hers he metes out (for her) a second portion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:11">3:9:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now as to why he metes out five times&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--the sacrifice is of the same measure as the year, and there are five seasons in the year: he takes possession of it in five (divisions); hence he metes out five times.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_242"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 242</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:12">3:9:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. He touches it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 33), 'What light of thine there is in the heavens, O Soma, what on earth, and what in the wide air, therewith make wide room for this sacrificer, for his prosperity: speak thou for the giver!' Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods, he thought within himself, 'I must not become sacrificial food for the gods with my whole self!' Accordingly he deposited those three bodies of his in these worlds.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:13">3:9:4:13</A></FONT></span>13. The gods then were victorious. They obtained those bodies by means of this same (formula), and he became entirely the sacrificial food of the gods. And in like manner does this (priest) now thereby obtain those bodies of his, and he (Soma) becomes entirely the food of the gods: this is why he thus touches it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:14">3:9:4:14</A></FONT></span>14. He then pours Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; water on it. Now the waters, forsooth, slew V<I>ri</I>tra and by virtue of that prowess of theirs they now flow. Wherefore nothing whatsoever can check them when they flow; for they followed their own free will, thinking, 'To whom, forsooth, should we submit (or stop), we by whom V<I>ri</I>tra was slain!' Now all this (universe), whatsoever there is, had submitted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to Indra, even he that blows yonder.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:15">3:9:4:15</A></FONT></span>15. Indra spake, 'Verily, all this (universe), whatsoever there is, has submitted unto me: submit ye also to me!'--They said, 'What shall be our (reward) then?'--'The first draught of king Soma shall be yours!'--'So be it!' thus they submitted to</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A></p>  
<p>him; and they having submitted, he drew (ni-grabh) them to his breast; and because he thus drew them to his breast, therefore they are called Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc;s. And in like manner does this sacrificer now draw them to his breast: and this is their first draught of king Soma, in that he pours Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; water thereon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:16">3:9:4:16</A></FONT></span>16. He pours it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 34), 'Ye are grateful, the subduers of V<I>ri</I>tra;'--the waters indeed are propitious: therefore he says, 'Ye are grateful;' and 'the subduers of V<I>ri</I>tra' he says because they did slay V<I>ri</I>tra;--'the beneficent wives of the immortal (Soma);' for the waters are immortal;--'Ye goddesses, lead this sacrifice to the gods!' there is nothing obscure in this; 'Invited, drink ye of Soma!' Thus invited they drink the first draught of king Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:17">3:9:4:17</A></FONT></span>17. Being about to beat (the Soma with the pressing-stone), let him think in his mind of him he hates: 'Herewith I strike N.N., not thee!' Now whosoever kills a human Br&acirc;hman here, he, forsooth, is deemed guilty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--how much more so he who strikes him (Soma), for Soma is a god. But they do kill him when they press him;--they kill him with that (stone): thus he rises from thence, thus he lives; and thus no guilt is incurred.. But if he hate no one, he may even think of a straw, and thus no guilt is incurred.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:18">3:9:4:18</A></FONT></span>18. He beats with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 35), 'Fear not, tremble not!' whereby he means to say, 'Be not afraid, do not tremble, it is N.N. I strike, not thee!'--'Take thou strength!' whereby he means to say, 'Take sap!'--'Both ye bowls, that are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_244"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 244</FONT></A></p>  
<p>firm, remain firm, take strength!'--'Surely, it is those two (pressing-)boards that are thereby meant,' so say some;--what, then, if one were to break those two boards&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>? But, forsooth, it is these two, heaven and earth, that tremble for fear of that raised thunderbolt (the stone): hereby now he propitiates it for those two, heaven and earth; and thus propitiated it does not injure them. By 'Take strength!' he means to say, 'Take sap!'--'The evil is slain, not Soma!' he thereby slays every evil of his.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:19">3:9:4:19</A></FONT></span>19. Thrice he presses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, thrice he gathers together,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A></p>  
<p>four times he performs the Nigr&acirc;bha,--this makes ten, for of ten syllables consists the vir&acirc;<I>g</I>, and Soma is of vir&acirc;<I>g</I> nature: therefore he completes (the ceremony) in ten times.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:20">3:9:4:20</A></FONT></span>20. Then as to why he performs the Nigr&acirc;bha. Now when he (Soma) first became sacrificial food for the gods, he set his heart on those (four) regions, thinking, 'Could I but consort with those regions as my mate, my loved resort!' By performing the Nigr&acirc;bha, the gods then made him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort; and in like manner does this (sacrificer) now, by performing the Nigr&acirc;bha, make him (Soma) consort with those regions as his mate, his loved resort.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:21">3:9:4:21</A></FONT></span>21. He performs with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 36), 'From east, from west, from north, from south--from every side may the regions resort to thee!' whereby he makes him consort with the regions as his mate, his loved resort. 'O mother, satisfy (him)! may the noble meet together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!' A mother</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (amb&acirc;) is a woman, and the regions (di<I>s</I>, fem.) are women: therefore he says, 'O mother, satisfy (him)!--May the noble meet together!' The noble doubtless means people (creatures, offspring): he thus means to say, 'May the people live in harmony with each other!' Even the people that are far away (from each other) live in harmony with each other: therefore he says, 'May the noble meet together.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:22">3:9:4:22</A></FONT></span>22. Now as to why he is called Soma. When he first became sacrificial food for the gods, he thought within him, 'I must not become, sacrificial food for the gods with my whole self!' That form of his which was most pleasing he accordingly put aside. Thereupon the gods were victorious; they said, 'Draw that unto thee, for therewith shalt thou become our food!' He drew it to him even from afar, saying, verily, that is mine own (sv&acirc; me): hence he was called Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:23">3:9:4:23</A></FONT></span>23. Then as to why he is called Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (sacrifice). Now, when they press him, they slay him; and when they spread him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_598"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, they cause him to be born. He is born in being spread along, he is born moving (yan g&acirc;yate): hence yan-<I>g</I>a, for 'ya<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>a' they say, is the same as 'ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:24">3:9:4:24</A></FONT></span>24. Also this speech did he then utter (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VI, 37;</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Rig-veda I, 84, 19), 'Verily thou, a god, shalt extol the mortal, O most mighty! than thee there is no other giver of joy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_601"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, O lord! unto thee do I speak this word, O Indra!' For it was indeed as a mortal that he uttered this, 'Thou alone wilt produce (me) from here, no other but thee!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:4:25">3:9:4:25</A></FONT></span>25. And from the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; water they draw the several grahas (cups or libations of Soma). For it was the waters that slew V<I>ri</I>tra, and in virtue of this prowess they flow; and it is from flowing water that he takes the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water, and from the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; water; and from the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; water the several grahas are drawn. In virtue of that prowess, then, the grahas are drawn from the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup. Now the Hot<I>ri</I> means the <I>Ri</I>k (fem.), a woman; and from woman creatures are born here on earth: hence he makes him (Soma) to be born from that woman, the <I>Ri</I>k, the Hot<I>ri</I>; wherefore (he takes the grahas) from the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup.</p>

Before each turn Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; water is poured upon the Soma plants by the sacrificer from the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup. After each turn of pressing the Adhvaryu throws the completely-pressed stalks into the cup, and when they have become thoroughly soaked, he presses them out and takes them out again; this being the 'gathering together' referred to above. At the same time he mutters the Nigr&acirc;bha formula (<a href="sbe2639.htm#3:9:4:21">paragraph 21</A>); after which the pressed-out juice, absorbed by the water, is poured into the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u vessel in the following manner. Before the pressing the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> had taken six Soma-stalks, and put two each between the fingers of his left hand. After each turn of pressing he takes the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u vessel with his right hand and holds one pair of the Soma-stalks over it (or, according to others, all six at the same time), through which (as through <A NAME="page_245"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 245</FONT></A> a strainer) the Adhvaryu then pours the Soma-juice from the pressing-skin into the vessel. After the third turn the pressing-stone itself is put into the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup, either with or without the muttering of the Nigr&acirc;bha formula. According to the commentary on K&acirc;ty. IX, 4, 27, the Soma-juice is transferred from the skin to the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u cup, by the straining-cloth being made to imbibe the juice and then being pressed out so as to trickle down through the plants between the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>'s fingers. The description given by Haug, Ait. Br., Transl. p. 489, is somewhat different.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_597"></A><A HREF="sbe2639.htm#fr_599">245:1</A> The interpretation of this formula is very doubtful. The author evidently takes 'ar&icirc;<I>h</I>' as nom. plur. of 'ari' (= &acirc;rya); but it does not appear how he takes 'nishpara,' while Mah&icirc;dhara explains it by 'p&ucirc;raya (give him, Soma, his fill).' The St. Petersburg Dict. suggests that 'nishpara' may mean 'come out!' and that 'ar&icirc;<I>h</I>' seems to be a nom. sing. here. I take the last part of the formula to mean, 'May he (Soma) win (or, perhaps, join) the longing (waters)!' <A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A> some of the Nigr&acirc;bhy&acirc; water being poured on the Soma at each turn of pressing; and small stalks of Soma being, besides, thrown into the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup containing that water. As to the first part of the formula, it may perhaps mean, 'Well, pour out (or, pour forth, intrans.).' Professor Ludwig, Rig-veda IV, p. xvi, thinks that 'nishpara' is a correction of the Taitt, reading 'nishvara,' which S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a interprets, 'O mother (Soma), come out (from the stalks, in the form of juice),' and according to the S&ucirc;tra quoted by him, the sacrificer is at the same time to think of the wife he loves.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_598"></A><A HREF="sbe2639.htm#fr_600">246:1</A> That is, when they perform the Soma-sacrifice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_599"></A><A HREF="sbe2639.htm#fr_601">247:1</A> This is the traditional meaning (sukhayit<I>ri</I>) assigned to mar<I>d</I>ayit<I>ri</I> (the merciful, comforter); but it is not quite clear how the author of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a interprets it.</P>
