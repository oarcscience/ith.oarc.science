### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:1">4:4:3:1</span></span>1. The
metres, forsooth, are the (draught) cattle of the gods. Even as
harnessed cattle here on earth

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

draw for men, so do the harnessed metres draw the sacrifice for the
gods. And whenever the metres gratified the gods, then the gods
gratified the metres. Now it has been previous to this, that the
harnessed metres have drawn the sacrifice to the gods, that they have
gratified them <span id="fr_861"></span>[1](#fn_858):

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:2">4:4:3:2</span></span>2. He now
draws the Hâriyo*g*ana <span id="fr_862"></span>[2](#fn_859) graha--the
Hâriyo*g*ana being the metres--it is the metres he thereby gratifies:
this is why he draws the Hâriyo*g*ana graha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:3">4:4:3:3</span></span>3. He
draws it as an additional (libation); since

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

he draws it when he (the Hot*ri*) pronounces the 'All-hail and
blessing <span id="fr_863"></span>[1](#fn_860).' For there are here the
gods, and the metres in addition to them; and there are men, and beasts
in addition to them: therefore he draws it as an additional one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:4">4:4:3:4</span></span>4. He
draws it in the Dro*n*akala*s*a. Now Soma was V*ri*tra. When the gods
slew him, his head rolled off <span id="fr_864"></span>[2](#fn_861): it
became the Dro*n*akala*s*a. Thereinto flowed together so much of the
juice as it could hold <span id="fr_865"></span>[3](#fn_862); that was
in excess; and so is this graha in excess: he thus puts the excess. to
the excess,--therefore he draws it in the Dro*n*akala*s*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:5">4:4:3:5</span></span>5. He
draws it without a puroru*k*-formula, for he draws it for the metres;
and in that he draws it for the metres, even thereby that (graha) of his
becomes supplied with a puroru*k*: therefore he draws it without a
puroru*k*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:6">4:4:3:6</span></span>6. He now
draws it from that (Âgraya*n*a graha) with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, it), 'Thou
art taken with a support: of bay colour art thou, meet for the team of
bay steeds,--thee to the pair of bay steeds!' Now, the two bay horses
are the *Rik* and Sâman: it is for the *Rik* and Sâman that he draws it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:7">4:4:3:7</span></span>7. He
then pours parched grain into it with, 'Ye are the bays’ grains, united
with the Soma for

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Indra!' Whatever
metres there are, both measured and unmeasured, they all thereby drink
(of the Soma <span id="fr_866"></span>[1](#fn_863)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:8">4:4:3:8</span></span>8. For
this (libation) the Unnet*ri* <span id="fr_867"></span>[2](#fn_864)
calls for the *S*rausha*t*;--for the Unnet*ri* is in excess
(additional), since he does not call for the *S*rausha*t* for any other
(libation); and this libation also is in excess: thus he puts the excess
to the excess,--therefore the Unnet*ri* calls for the *S*rausha*t*.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:9">4:4:3:9</span></span>9.
Placing (the Dro*n*akala*s*a) on his head, he calls for the
*S*rausha*t*,--for this (vessel) is his (Soma's) head. He first says (to
the Maitrâvaru*n*a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) for the
Soma-draughts with grains!' Having called for the *S*rausha*t*, he says,
'Prompt (the Hot*ri* to pronounce the offering prayer on) the
Soma-draughts with grain brought forward <span
id="fr_868"></span>[3](#fn_865)!' and offers as the Vasha*t* and
Anuvasha*t* are uttered. They then divide the grain between them for the
sake of the Soma-draught.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:10">4:4:3:10</span></span>10. Now
some take the Dro*n*akala*s*a over to the Hot*ri*, on the ground that
'the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vasha*t*.' But let him not do
it thus; for the other draughts are (taken by the respective priests)
according to the *k*amasa cups, but this one is in excess: therefore
there is a draught in it for all of them,--for this reason they divide
the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:11">4:4:3:11</span></span>11.
They must not bite them with their teeth,--for these (grains) mean
cattle,--thinking 'lest we should do aught to crush our cattle!' They
only drink it in with their breath <span
id="fr_869"></span>[1](#fn_866), with (Vâ,;. S. VIII, 12), 'What
horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine <span
id="fr_870"></span>[2](#fn_867);' for they are cattle: therefore he
says, 'what horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine;'--'Of that
draught, offered with Ya*g*us, praised by chants <span
id="fr_871"></span>[3](#fn_868),'--for Ya*g*us-prayers have indeed been
offered, and chants have been chanted;--'sung by hymns,'--for songs
(*s*astras) have been sung;--'Of the invited <span
id="fr_872"></span>[4](#fn_869) do I drink, invited,'--for invited, he
now drinks of the invited.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:12">4:4:3:12</span></span>12.
They must not throw them into the fire, lest they offer remains (of
offerings) in the fire. They rather throw them on the high altar: thus
they are not excluded from the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:13">4:4:3:13</span></span>13.
Thereupon they touch the vessels filled (with water <span
id="fr_873"></span>[5](#fn_870)) which some call Apsushomâ*h*
(Soma-draughts in water). For even as a yoked (animal) draws, so

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

do they who perform the priestly duties. But the yoked (animal) galls or
scratches itself; and water is a means of soothing, a medicine: thus
wherever in this (sacrifice) they gall or scratch themselves--water
being a means of soothing--they soothe by that means of soothing, water;
they heal it by water. This is why they touch the vessels filled (with
water).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:14">4:4:3:14</span></span>14.
They touch them with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 14), 'With lustre, with sap, with
bodies <span id="fr_874"></span>[1](#fn_871) have we united,--with the
happy spirit: may Tvash*tri*, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches,
and may he smooth what was injured in our body!' thus they heal what was
torn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:3:15">4:4:3:15</span></span>15.
They then touch their faces. There is a twofold reason why they touch
their faces;--water, forsooth, is the elixir of immortality: it is with
the elixir of immortality that they thus touch themselves. And,
moreover, they thus deposit that holy work into their own self:
therefore they touch their faces.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_858"></span>[370:1](sbe2657.htm#fr_861) See I, 8, 2, 8; the
translation has been amended in accordance with Professor Whitney's
suggestions, American Journal of Philology, III, p. 406.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[370:2](sbe2657.htm#fr_862) That is, referring
to the 'hari-yo*g*ana,' or (Indra's) team of bay steeds.

<span id="fn_860"></span>[371:1](sbe2657.htm#fr_863) For the *S*am-yos,
see part i, p. 254, note. The pronunciation of that formula takes place
after the offering proper is completed.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[371:2](sbe2657.htm#fr_864) ? Or burst
(udvavarta), as the St. Petersburg Dictionary takes it. The Kâ*n*va text
reads.--V*ri*tro vai soma âsît ta*m* yatra devâ*h* pâtreshu
vyag*ri*h*n*ata tasya mûrdhno (!) vyavartta sa dro*n*akala*s*o ’bhavat.

<span id="fn_862"></span>[371:3](sbe2657.htm#fr_865) Yâvân vâ yâvân vâ
rasa*h*, (? some indeterminate quantity of the juice:) Cf. [IV, 4, 5,
13](sbe2659.htm#4:4:5:13).

<span id="fn_863"></span>[372:1](sbe2657.htm#fr_866) The text might also
be taken in the sense of 'Whatever metre there is, both measured and
unmeasured, all that he thereby consumes.' The libation is, however,
taken out for the metres or cattle, represented by the grain.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[372:2](sbe2657.htm#fr_867) Instead of the
Âgnîdhra, see I, 5, 2, 16, with note.

<span id="fn_865"></span>[372:3](sbe2657.htm#fr_868) Regarding
'prasthitam,' see [p. 198](sbe2632.htm#page_198), note
[3](sbe2632.htm#fn_495).

<span id="fn_866"></span>[373:1](sbe2657.htm#fr_869) They are only to
smell the grains steeped in the Soma-juice.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[373:2](sbe2657.htm#fr_870) The Kâ*n*va
recension adds, 'O divine Soma!'

<span id="fn_868"></span>[373:3](sbe2657.htm#fr_871) Lit., having
Ya*g*us offered, and chants chanted for it.

<span id="fn_869"></span>[373:4](sbe2657.htm#fr_872) ? I.e. 'that to
which I am invited.'

<span id="fn_870"></span>[373:5](sbe2657.htm#fr_873) That is, the ten
*K*amasins touch their respective *k*amasa cups, filled with water and
placed in the proper order from south to north, behind the pit
(kâtvâla), after putting fresh ku*s*a stalks on them. Those priests who
have no cups of their own touch the cups of those with whom they are
most nearly connected, viz. the four Adhvaryus that of the Nesh*tri* the
Udgât*ri*'s assistants that of their principal, the Grâvastut that of
the Hot*ri*. Thereupon they touch their faces and betake themselves to
the Âgnîdhra fire-house, to partake of sour milk. Then follow, on the
Gârhapatya (at the front hall door), the Patnîsa*m*yâ*g*as of the cakes
of the animal offering, followed by the Samish*t*aya*g*us, See also
Lâ*t*y. *S*r. II, 11, 16 seq.

<span id="fn_871"></span>[374:1](sbe2657.htm#fr_874) See I, 9, 3, 6. Cf.
Atharva-veda VI, 53, 3. The Tâ*nd*ya Br. I, 3, 9 reads 'sa*m*
tapobhi*h*' (with fervour).
