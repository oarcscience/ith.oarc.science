#### THE ANIMAL SACRIFICE <span id="fr_430"></span>[1](#fn_428) TO AGNI AND SOMA.

### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### A. THE SETTING UP OF THE SACRIFICIAL STAKE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:1">3:6:4:1</span></span>1. Being
about to cut the sacrificial stake, he offers <span
id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_429) with a verse addressed to Vish*n*u. For
the stake belongs to Vish*n*u; therefore he offers with a verse
addressed to Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:2">3:6:4:2</span></span>2. And
again, why he offers with a verse addressed to Vish*n*u--Vish*n*u being
the sacrifice, he thus approaches the stake by means of the sacrifice:
therefore he offers with a verse addressed to Vish*n*u.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:3">3:6:4:3</span></span>3. If he
offers with the offering-spoon, he offers after taking ghee by four
ladlings; and if he offers with the dipping-spoon, he offers after
'cutting out' (some ghee from the pot) with the dipping-spoon,--with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 41), 'Stride thou widely,

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> O Vish*n*u, make
wide room for our abode! drink the ghee, thou born of ghee, and speed
the lord of the sacrifice ever onwards! Hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:4">3:6:4:4</span></span>4. He
takes the ghee which is left (in the melting-pot). Whatever
chopping-knife the carpenter uses, that the carpenter now takes. They
then proceed (to the wood). Whatever (tree) they select for the stake,

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:5">3:6:4:5</span></span>5. That
he touches while muttering (Vâ*g*. S. V, 42),--or he salutes it while
standing behind it with his face towards the east,--'I have passed over
the others, I have not gone nigh the others--' he does indeed pass over
others and does not go near to others: wherefore he says, 'I have passed
over the others, I have not gone nigh the others.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:6">3:6:4:6</span></span>6. 'Thee
have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the farther side
of the nearer;' he does indeed fell it on the nearer side of the
farther, of those that are farther away from it; and 'on the farther
side of the nearer,' he says, because he does fell it on the farther
side of the nearer, of those that are on this side of it. This is why he
says, 'Thee have I found on the nearer side of the farther, and on the
farther side of the nearer.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:7">3:6:4:7</span></span>7. 'Thee
do we favour, O divine lord of the forest <span
id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_430), for the worship of the gods.' As for
the good work, he would favour (select) one from amidst many (men) and
he (the chosen) would be well-disposed to that work, even so does he
now, for the good work, favour that (tree) from amidst many, and it
becomes well-disposed to the felling.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:8">3:6:4:8</span></span>8. 'Thee
may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!' for that is truly
successful which the gods favour for the good work: therefore he says,
'Thee may the gods favour for the worship of the gods!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:9">3:6:4:9</span></span>9. He
then touches it with the dipping-spoon, with, 'For Vish*n*u, thee!' for
the stake belongs to Vish*n*u, since Vish*n*u is the sacrifice, and he
fells this (tree) for the sacrifice: therefore he says, 'For Vish*n*u,
thee!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:10">3:6:4:10</span></span>10. He
then places a blade of darbha-grass between <span
id="fr_433"></span>[1](#fn_431), with, 'O plant, shield it!' for the axe
is a thunderbolt; but thus that thunderbolt, the axe, does not hurt it
(the tree). He then strikes with the axe, with, 'O axe, hurt it not!'
for the axe is a thunderbolt, but thus that thunderbolt, the axe, does
not hurt it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:11">3:6:4:11</span></span>11. The
first chip <span id="fr_434"></span>[2](#fn_432) which he cuts off, he
takes (and lays aside). Let him cut (the tree) so as to cause no
obstruction to the axle <span id="fr_435"></span>[3](#fn_433). For,
indeed, it is on a cart that they convey it, and in this way he does not
obstruct the cart.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:12">3:6:4:12</span></span>12. Let
him cut it so as to fall towards the east, for the east is the quarter
of the gods; or towards the north, for the north is the quarter of men;
or towards the west. But let him take care to keep it from (falling
towards) the southern quarter, for that is the quarter of the Fathers:
therefore he must take care to keep it from the southern quarter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:13">3:6:4:13</span></span>13. The
falling (tree) he addresses with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V; 43), 'Graze not
the sky! hurt not the air! unite with the earth!' for verily that (tree)
which they cut for the stake is a thunderbolt, and these worlds tremble
for fear of that falling thunderbolt; but he thereby propitiates it for
these worlds, and thus propitiated it injures not these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:14">3:6:4:14</span></span>14. Now
when he says, 'Graze not the sky,' he means to say, 'Injure not the
sky!' In the words 'hurt not the air' there is nothing obscure. By
'Unite with the earth,' he means to say, 'Be thou in harmony with the
earth!' 'For this sharp-edged axe hath led thee forward unto great
bliss,' for this sharp axe indeed leads it forward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:15">3:6:4:15</span></span>15.
Upon the stump he then offers ghee, 'lest the evil spirits should rise
therefrom after (the tree):' ghee being a thunderbolt, he thus repels
the evil spirits by means of the thunderbolt, and thus the evil spirits
do not rise therefrom after it. And ghee being seed, he thus endows the
trees with that seed; and from that seed (in) the stump trees are
afterwards produced <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_434).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:16">3:6:4:16</span></span>16. He
sacrifices with, 'Grow thou out of this, O lord of the forest, with a
hundred shoots!

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> May we grow out
with a thousand shoots!' There is nothing obscure in this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:17">3:6:4:17</span></span>17.
Thereupon he cuts it (the stake of the proper length): of whatever
length he cuts it the first time, so long let it remain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:18">3:6:4:18</span></span>18. He
may cut it five cubits long; for fivefold is the sacrifice and fivefold
is the animal (victim), and five seasons there are in the year:
therefore he may cut it five cubits long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:19">3:6:4:19</span></span>19. He
may cut it six cubits long; for six seasons there are in the year; and
the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a thunderbolt:
therefore he may cut it six cubits long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:20">3:6:4:20</span></span>20. He
may cut it eight cubits long, (for eight syllables has the Gâyatrî, and
the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as the sacrificial stake
is the fore-part of the sacrifice: therefore he may cut it eight cubits
long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:21">3:6:4:21</span></span>21. He
may cut it nine cubits long, for threefold is the sacrifice, and 'nine'
is threefold: therefore he may cut it nine cubits long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:22">3:6:4:22</span></span>22. He
may cut it eleven cubits long, for eleven syllables has the Trish*t*ubh,
and the Trish*t*ubh is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a
thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it eleven cubits long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:23">3:6:4:23</span></span>23. He
may cut it twelve cubits long, for twelve months there are in the year,
and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a
thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it twelve cubits long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:24">3:6:4:24</span></span>24. He
may cut it thirteen cubits long, for thirteen months there are in a
year, and the year is a thunderbolt, as the sacrificial stake is a
thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it thirteen cubits long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:25">3:6:4:25</span></span>25. He
may cut it fifteen cubits long, for the

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

fifteen-versed chant is a thunderbolt <span
id="fr_437"></span>[1](#fn_435), as the sacrificial stake is a
thunderbolt: therefore he may cut it fifteen cubits long.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:26">3:6:4:26</span></span>26. The
sacrificial stake of the Vâ*g*apeya sacrifice is seventeen cubits long.
Indeed, it may be unmeasured <span id="fr_438"></span>[2](#fn_436), for
with that same unmeasured thunderbolt did the gods conquer the
unmeasured; and in like manner does he now conquer the unmeasured with
that unmeasured thunderbolt: therefore it may even be unmeasured.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:6:4:27">3:6:4:27</span></span>27. It
is (made to be) eight-cornered, for eight syllables has the Gâyatrî, and
the Gâyatrî is the fore-part of the sacrifice, as this (stake) is the
forepart of the sacrifice: therefore it is eight-cornered.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[162:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_430) On the Animal
Sacrifice, cp. Dr. J. Schwab's dissertation, 'Das altindische
Thieropfer,' 1882.

<span id="fn_429"></span>[162:2](sbe2626.htm#fr_431) This oblation is
called yûpâhuti, or 'stake-offering.'

<span id="fn_430"></span>[163:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_432) 'Vanaspati' is a
common synonym of v*ri*ksha, tree.

<span id="fn_431"></span>[164:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_433) Viz. he places or
holds it against where he is about to strike the tree, so as first to
cut the grass.

<span id="fn_432"></span>[164:2](sbe2626.htm#fr_434) For the destination
of this chip of the bark, see [III, 7, 1, 8](sbe2627.htm#3:7:1:8).

<span id="fn_433"></span>[164:3](sbe2626.htm#fr_435) That is to say, he
is not to cut the tree too high from the ground, so that the axle of the
cart might readily pass over the remaining stump without touching it.
The Kâ*n*va text reads, 'tam anakshastambhe v*risk*ed uta hy enam anasâ
vakshyanto bhavanty uto svarga*m* hâsya loka*m* yate (sic)
’kshastambha*h* syât tasmâd anakshastambhe v*risk*et.' Nothing is said
anywhere about the yûpa being conveyed on a cart to the sacrificial
ground, if, indeed, that statement refer to the yûpa at all. Sâya*n*a's
comment is very corrupt here, but he seems to interpret the passage to
the effect that some people might convey the stake on the cart (pakshe
anasâ yûpa*m* nayeyu*h*) and that in that case the cart would be
obstructed.

<span id="fn_434"></span>[165:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_436) Or, 'hence trees
grow up again from the stump (? after felling, "â vra*sk*anât") out of
seed.'

<span id="fn_435"></span>[167:1](sbe2626.htm#fr_437) On the connection
of the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma with Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt,
see part i, introduction, p. xviii.

<span id="fn_436"></span>[167:2](sbe2626.htm#fr_438) The Kâ*n*va text
leaves an option first between stakes six, eight, eleven, fifteen (and
for the Vâ*g*apeya seventeen) cubits long; and finally lays down the
rule that no regard is to be had to any fixed measure.
