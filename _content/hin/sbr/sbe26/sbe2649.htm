Having drawn the cups of Soma, and gone out (of the cart-shed to the high altar)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_736"></A><A HREF="#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he offers the oblation of drops&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_737"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. The reason why he offers the oblation of drops is this. Whatever drops of that (Soma) are spilt here, to them he now wishes a safe journey to the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, for the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya is the resting-place of offerings: this is why he offers the oblation of drops.</p>

<p>away, whatever stalk of thine,'--whatever particle (of Soma) is spilt, that is a drop, that indeed he means; and by 'whatever stalk of thine' he mentions the stalk;--'stone-pressed, from the lap of the press-bowls;' for pressed by the stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> it leaps away from the two press-bowls;--'be it from the Adhvaryu or from the strainer,'--for it leaps away either from the Adhvaryu's hands or from the strainer,--'that I offer unto thee in my mind consecrated by Vasha<I>t</I>, Hail!' whereby it becomes for him as an offering consecrated by Vasha<I>t</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:5:3">4:2:5:3</A></FONT></span>3. Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:5:6">4:2:5:6</A></FONT></span>6. He then throws down the other stalk in front of the chanters, silently, for those chanters represent the hymn of praise (stotra), Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the sacrifice),--he (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) draws to himself everything here, and takes possession of everything here: it is to him that that stalk is offered, and thus he does not draw the Adhvaryu to himself, and take possession of him.

<p>in the seasons. And in like manner do the priests thereby embrace the sacrificer and ascend from hence to the heavenly world: this is why they chant the Bahishpavam&acirc;na h ere.</p>

If there be a blameworthy one, even that one (priest) would make it sink: he makes it sink, even as one who ascends a ship that is full would make it sink. And, indeed, every sacrifice is a ship bound heavenwards: hence one should seek to keep a blameworthy (priest) away from every sacrifice.</p>

The Agn&icirc;dh spreads the fires, that is to say, kindles them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_752"></A><A HREF="#fn_749"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; he strews that barhis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_753"></A><A HREF="#fn_750"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, thinking, 'When the barhis is strewn, I will offer to the gods on the kindled (fire).'--'Prepare the cakes,' he says, because he is about to proceed with the cakes; and, 'Go on with the victim,' because he is about to get ready the victim&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_754"></A><A HREF="#fn_751"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

Having drawn the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina graha he goes out and girds the sacrificial stake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_756"></A><A HREF="#fn_753"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>; and having girt the stake he gets ready the victim: he thereby puts flavour (juice) into him (Soma--the sacrificer).</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:5:16">4:2:5:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now when he slays the victim, he thereby puts flavour into it; and when he proceeds with (the offering of) the Soma feast cakes, he puts sap into it: thus it becomes Soma for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:5:17">4:2:5:17</A></FONT></span>17. They all belong to Indra; for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: that is why they all belong to Indra.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:5:19">4:2:5:19</A></FONT></span>19.

<P><A NAME="fn_743"></A><A HREF="sbe2649.htm#fr_746">307:5</A> The first stotra at each pressing is called pavam&acirc;na (purifying, i.e. during the chanting of which the Soma becomes clarified), viz. the Bahishpavam&acirc;na at the morning, the M&acirc;dhyandina pavam&acirc;na at the midday, and the &Acirc;rbhava (or t<I>ri</I>t&icirc;ya) pavam&acirc;na at the evening pressing.

Those required for the Sha<I>d</I>aha and Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha (see IV, 5, 4, 1 seq.) are: triv<I>ri</I>t (9), pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a (15), saptada<I>s</I>a 07), ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (21), tri<I>n</I>ava (27), trayastri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (33), <I>k</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (24), <I>k</I>atu<I>s</I><I>k</I>atv&acirc;ri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (44), and ashta<I>k</I>atv&acirc;ri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (48). The first four of these are those most frequently used, and the only ones used at the Agnish<I>t</I>oma. All these stomas, with one exception (24), have two or more different varieties or arrangements, called vish<I>t</I>uti, differing from one another either in the order in which the several verses are to be chanted, or in regard to the number of repetitions which the corresponding verses have to undergo. Besides, stomas are generally performed in three turns or rounds, pary&acirc;ya, consisting of a triplet of verses (some of which may have to be repeated more than once), and preceded by the sound 'hu<I>m</I>' (Hi&#7749;k&acirc;ra). Thus the first &Acirc;<I>g</I>yastotra, S&acirc;mav. II, 10-12, (consisting of three verses, a, b, c,) is to be performed in the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a-stoma; that is, the three verses have to be so treated, by repetitions, as to produce fifteen verses in three turns. Now, as there are three different varieties of performing the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a-stoma, the stotra might be chanted in one or other of the following three arrangements:--</p>  <table border="0">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top">

<p>The three pary&acirc;yas of a stoma (or vish<I>t</I>uti) show each three subdivisions (viz. a&nbsp;a&nbsp;a--b--c. being those of the first pary&acirc;ya above), called vish<I>t</I>&acirc;va. When the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s are about to commence a chant, the Prastot<I>ri</I> spreads in their midst a cloth, doubled up so that the unwoven fringe lies over the selvage, either towards the east or north. Thereon he marks the subdivisions of the rounds, by means of sticks (ku<I>s</I>&acirc;), a span long, of some kind of wood suitable for sacrifice, split lengthways along the pith (the bark being left outside) and somewhat pointed at one end, then smeared over with some fragrant substance, and wrapped up singly in pieces of the same kind of cloth as that spread on the ground. The marking of the vish<I>t</I>&acirc;vas, or subdivisions, takes place at the end of the prast&acirc;va or prelude (see next page, note <A HREF="#fn_747">1</A>) in this way, that each vish<I>t</I>&acirc;va is marked by as many sticks as the corresponding verse has to be repeated; those of the first vish<I>t</I>&acirc;va being laid down with the point to the north, then behind or west of them those of the second turn with the point to the west, and behind them those of the third turn with the point to the north. Thereupon those of the other two rounds are laid down in the same way, each turn north of the preceding one. Hence the arrangement of sticks for the first of the above varieties of the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a-stoma would be three straight, one across, one straight; one straight, three across, one straight; one straight, one across, three straight.</p>  
<p>With the exception of the Bahishpavam&acirc;na, the chanting is performed in the Sadas by the side of the Udumbara post (see <a href="sbe2623.htm#3:6:1:2">III, 6, 1, 2</A> seq.), the latter being likewise enclosed in a cloth of the above description, wrapt round it from left to right, with the unwoven fringe towards the top.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_747"></A><A HREF="sbe2649.htm#fr_750">310:1</A> The Bahishpavam&acirc;na-(stotra), or 'outside-pavam&acirc;na,'--so called because (on the first day of a Soma-sacrifice) it is performed outside the altar (commentary on Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>av. Br. VI, 8, 10-11; or outside the Sadas, S&acirc;y. on S&acirc;mav. S. p. 47),--is chanted in the Triv<I>ri</I>t, or threefold, stoma; consisting, as it does, of three g&acirc;yatr&icirc; triplets (S&acirc;mav. II, 1-9 for the Agnish<I>t</I>oma), and none of its verses being chanted more than once. This stoma has three different varieties, viz. the udyat&icirc;, or ascending mode, the first turn of which consists of the first verses of the three triplets, the second turn of the second verses, and the third turn of the last verses, hence a<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;a<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;a<sup>3</sup>--b<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;b<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;b<sup>3</sup>--c<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;c<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;c<sup>3</sup>; the parivartin&icirc;, or reverting mode, following the natural order, a<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;b<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;c<sup>1</sup>--a<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;b<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;c<sup>2</sup>--a<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;b<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;c<sup>3</sup>; and the kul&acirc;yin&icirc;, or web-like mode, performed in the order a<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;b<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;c<sup>1</sup>-b<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;c<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;a<sup>2</sup>--c<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;a<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;b<sup>3</sup>. Cf. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 237, where, however, these forms are described quite differently. The term used for the natural order of verses in the parivartin&icirc; vish<I>t</I>uti is 'par&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc;,' i.e. thitherwards, straight off. From the statement in <a href="sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:7">paragraph 7</A> above, that 'they chant straight off (par&acirc;k),' one might therefore infer that that particular mode of chanting ought to be used for the Bahishpavam&acirc;na-stotra; but the term 'par&acirc;k' may also be taken as referring to each of the several verses being chanted 'straight off,' without any repetition. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 120 note, remarks: 'Each of these verses is for the purpose of chanting divided into four parts: <i>Prast&acirc;va</i>, i, e. prelude, the first being preceded by <i>hum&#0771</i>, to be sung by the Prastotar; <i>Udg&icirc;tha</i>, the principal part of the S&acirc;man, preceded by <i>Om</i>, to be chanted by the Udg&acirc;tar; the <i>Pratih&acirc;ra</i>, i.e. response [? rather check, stop; cf. <a href="sbe2653.htm#4:3:4:22">IV, 3, 4, 22</A>], introduced by <i>hum&#0771</i>, to be chanted by the Pratihartar; and the <i>Nidhana</i>, i.e. finale, to be sung by all three.

The Brahman and Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a having given their assent (&Acirc;<I>s</I>v. V, 2, 12-14). the Prastot<I>ri</I> hands the prastara to the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>. The latter touches his right thigh with it (or bends his right knee thereon) and 'harnesses' (introduces) the chant by the formula, 'with Agni's fire, with Indra's might, with S&ucirc;rya's brilliance, may B<I>ri</I>haspati harness thee,' &amp;c. (T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya Br. I, 3, 5); whereupon he mutters, 'I will make food,' &amp;c. (ib. 6); and after looking towards the pit and a vessel of water and the sun. he commences the chant. The three chanters are seated west of the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (who look towards them), viz. the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> facing the north, the Prastot<I>ri</I> the west, and the Pratihart<I>ri</I> the south (or south-east). To the west of them are seated three, four, or six subordinate singers, or choristers (upag&acirc;t<I>ri</I>), who accompany the chanting in a deep voice with the sound 'Ho.' When the chant is completed, the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> says, 'I have made food,' and makes the sacrificer mutter the formula, 'Thou art a falcon,' &amp;c. (Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>. Br. I, 3, 8); whereupon he takes a stalk of grass from the prastara, cuts off the top and bottom, so as to make it of the length of four thumbs&#8217; breadths, and throws it into the pit with, 'If it has been chanted,' &amp;c. (ib. II, 1, 8). They then pour out the vessel of water into the pit, with, 'I send you to the sea,' &amp;c., and make 3, 5, 7 or 9 steps northwards outside the altar, <A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A> whereupon they betake themselves to the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhr&icirc;ya.

While cutting the portion he calls on the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a to 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) of the cakes of the morning feast for Indra!' The anuv&acirc;ky&acirc; (Rig-veda III, 52, 1) having been recited by the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a, the Adhvaryu steps to the fire, calls on the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I> formula (see I, 5, 2, 16, with note), and thereupon on the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a to Urge the cakes of the morning feast brought forward for Indra!' That priest then urges, 'Let the Hot<I>ri</I> pronounce the offering prayer to Indra! May Indra with his bays eat the grain! [O Hotar, pronounce the offering prayer!]' Whereupon the Hot<I>ri</I> recites, We who worship (part i, p. 142, note),--May Indra with his bays eat the grains, with P&ucirc;shan the porridge; with Sarasvat&icirc;, with Bh&acirc;rat&icirc;, the sour curds, with Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a the clotted curds!

For the oblation to Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t the invitatory prayer is Rig-Veda III, 28, 1, and the offering formula 'Havir agne v&icirc;hi,' 'graciously accept the offering, O Agni!' The offerings completed, the dishes of sacrificial food. are placed on the Hot<I>ri</I>'s hearth.</P>
