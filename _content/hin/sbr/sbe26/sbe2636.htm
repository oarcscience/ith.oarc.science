<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:1">3:9:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. Now Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (the lord of creatures), having created living beings, felt himself as it were exhausted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_548"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. The creatures turned away from him; the creatures&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_549"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> did not abide with him for his joy and food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:2">3:9:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. He thought within him, 'I have exhausted</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_218"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 218</FONT></A></p>  
<p>myself, and the object for which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_548"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I have created has not been accomplished: my creatures have turned away from me, the creatures have not abode with me for my joy and food.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:3">3:9:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati thought within him, 'How can I again strengthen myself: the creatures might then return to me; the creatures might abide with me for my joy and food!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:4">3:9:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. He went on praising and toiling, desirous of creatures (or progeny). He beheld that set of eleven (victims). By offering therewith Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati again strengthened himself; the creatures returned to him, his creatures abode for his joy and food. By offering he truly became better.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:5">3:9:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. Therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims), for thus he truly strengthens himself by offspring and cattle the creatures turn unto him, the creatures abide with him for his joy and food;--he truly becomes better by offering: therefore, then, let him offer with the set of eleven (victims).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:6">3:9:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. In the first place he seizes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_549"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> a victim for Agni. For Agni is the head, the progenitor of the gods, he is the lord of creatures: and thereby the sacrificer truly becomes Agni's own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:7">3:9:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. Then one for Sarasvat&icirc;. For Sarasvat&icirc; is speech: by speech Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; speech turned unto him, speech he made subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by speech, and speech turns unto him, and he makes speech subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:8">3:9:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then one for Soma. For Soma is food: by</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A></p>  
<p>food Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; food turned unto him, and he made food subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by food; food turns unto him, and he makes food subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:9">3:9:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. And as to why it comes after that for Sarasvat&icirc;,--Sarasvat&icirc; is speech, and Soma is food: he who is incomplete by (having only) speech, now becomes indeed an eater of food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:10">3:9:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. Then one for P&ucirc;shan. For P&ucirc;shan means cattle; by means of cattle Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; cattle turned unto him, he made cattle subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of cattle; the cattle turn unto him, and he makes the cattle subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:11">3:9:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. Then one for B<I>ri</I>haspati. For B<I>ri</I>haspati means the priesthood (brahman); by means of the priesthood Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; the priesthood turned unto him, he made the priesthood subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of the Brahman; the priesthood turns unto him, he makes the priesthood subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:12">3:9:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. And as to why it comes after that for P&ucirc;shan,--P&ucirc;shan means cattle, and B<I>ri</I>haspati the priesthood; hence the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (priest) has the most power over beasts, because they are placed in front (are protected) by him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, because they are placed at the head (or in his mouth); therefore</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_220"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 220</FONT></A></p>  
<p>having given all that, he walks clad in sheepskin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:13">3:9:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. Then one for the Vi<I>s</I>ve dev&acirc;<I>h</I>. For the All-gods mean everything (or the All); with everything Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; everything turned unto him, and he made everything subject to him. And so does this one now become strong by everything; everything turns to him, and he makes everything subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:14">3:9:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. And as to why it comes after that for B<I>ri</I>haspati,--B<I>ri</I>haspati means the priesthood, and the All-gods this All; he then makes the priesthood the head of this All; wherefore the Brahman is the head of this All.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:15">3:9:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. Then one for Indra. For Indra means power (indriya) and vigour; by power and vigour Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; power and vigour turned unto him, and he made power and vigour subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by means of power and vigour; power and vigour turn to him, and he makes power and vigour subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:16">3:9:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. And as to why it comes after that for the All-gods,--Indra is the nobility, and the All-gods are the clans (people); he thus places the food before him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:17">3:9:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. Then one for the Maruts. For the Maruts mean the clans, and a clan means abundance; with abundance Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; abundance turned unto him, and he made abundance subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by abundance; abundance</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A></p>  
<p>turns unto him, and he makes abundance subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:18">3:9:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. And as to why it comes after that for Indra,--Indra is the nobility, and the All-gods are the clans, and the Maruts are the clans; he thus guards the nobility by the clan, and hence the nobility here is on both sides guarded by the clan.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:19">3:9:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. Then one for Indra and Agni. For Agni means penetrating brilliance, and Indra means power and vigour; with these two energies Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati then again strengthened himself; both energies turned unto him, and he made both energies subject to himself. And so does this one now become strong by both these energies; both energies turn unto him, and he makes both energies subject to himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:20">3:9:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. Then one for Savit<I>ri</I>. For Savit<I>ri</I> is the impeller (prasavit<I>ri</I>) of the gods; and so all those wishes become accomplished for him, impelled as they are by Savit<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:21">3:9:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. Then finally he seizes one for Varu<I>n</I>a; thereby he delivers him (the sacrificer) from every noose of Varu<I>n</I>a, from every (guilt) against Varu<I>n</I>a&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:22">3:9:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. Hence if there be eleven sacrificial stakes, let him bind Agni's (victim) to the one opposite the fire; and let them lead up the others one by one in the proper order.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:23">3:9:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. But if there be eleven victims&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, let them only immolate at the stake that for Agni, and after that the others in the proper order.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:24">3:9:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. When they lead them northwards, they lead the one for Agni first, and then the others in the proper order.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:25">3:9:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. When they throw them down, they throw down first the one for Agni, as the southernmost; then the others after leading them round northwards in the proper order.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:26">3:9:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. When they perform (offerings) with the omenta, they perform first with the omentum of Agni's (victim); then with those of the others in the proper order.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:9:1:27">3:9:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. When they perform with those (chief oblations), they perform first with that to Agni; then with the others in the proper order.</p>
