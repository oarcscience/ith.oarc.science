That Dhruva (graha)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, forsooth, (also) is his vital energy; by it his body is held together, and the joints are knit together.

Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes (the Ukthya cup) the first of the second pressing (Soma feast), and the last of the first: that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last.

<p>the last cup has not yet been drawn therefrom for the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka priest, he pours (the remaining) one-third of the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; (into the &Acirc;dhavan&icirc;ya). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes it the first of the second pressing, and the last of the first pressing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus. And because his body is thereby held together, therefore this (graha) is his vital energy.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:6">4:2:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. This (Ukthya graha) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion. At the morning feast he (the Adhvaryu) divides it for three songs of praise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_710"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and at the midday feast for three,--this makes six times, for there are six seasons, and the seasons mature all wishes here on earth: for this reason, then, this (libation) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:7">4:2:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. He draws it without (reciting) a puroru<I>k</I>; for the puroru<I>k</I> is a song of praise, since the puroru<I>k</I> is a <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, and the song of praise is <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>; and the libation is S&acirc;man; and what other (formula) he mutters, that is Ya<I>g</I>us. Formerly these same (puroru<I>k</I> verses) were apart&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_711"></A><A HREF="#fn_709"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>s, apart from the Ya<I>g</I>us, and apart from the S&acirc;mans.</p>

The gods said, 'Come, let us place them among the Ya<I>g</I>us: thus this science will be still more manifold.' Accordingly they placed them among the Ya<I>g</I>us, and thenceforward this science was still more manifold.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:9">4:2:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. And the reason why he draws this (graha) without a puroru<I>k</I>, is that the puroru<I>k</I> is praise, (being) a <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, and the song of praise is <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>; and in that he divides it for recitations, thereby indeed it becomes possessed of a puroru<I>k</I>: hence he draws it without a puroru<I>k</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:10">4:2:3:10</A></FONT></span>10.

VII, 22), 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Indra, possessed of the great (chant), possessed of vigour,'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice; wherefore he says 'thee for Indra;' and by 'possessed of the great (chant), possessed of vigour,' he means to say 'for him, the strong;'--'I take (thee) the song-pleasing,' for he indeed takes it for songs of praise;--'what great vigour is thine, O Indra'--whereby he means to say, 'what strength is thine, O Indra'--'for that (I take) thee! for Vish<I>n</I>u--thee!' for he takes it for the life of the sacrifice: hence he says, 'for that--thee! for Vish<I>n</I>u--thee!' With, 'This is thy womb: thee for the songs of praise!' he deposits it; for he indeed takes it for songs of praise.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:11">4:2:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. He distributes it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_711"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with, 'Thee, the</p>

He who would perform it in this manner would assume the command&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_715"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but let him rather distribute it to the respective deities.</p>

Now the <I>K</I>arak&acirc;dhvaryus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_716"></A><A HREF="#fn_714"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> divide (the Ukthya libation into three portions), with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises, agreeable to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a!' he (the <I>K</I>arak&acirc;dhvaryu) deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sth&acirc;l&icirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:16">4:2:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing. I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra!--This is thy womb: thee to Indra!' thus he deposits it; and with 'Thou art a re-offering' he touches the sth&acirc;l&icirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:17">4:2:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. 'Thou art taken with a support: thee, the god-pleasing, I take for the gods; (thee) the praise-pleasing, for praises,--agreeable to Indra and Agni!--This is thy womb: thee for Indra and Agni!' thus he deposits it. He does not at this (third portion) touch the sth&acirc;l&icirc; with 'Thou art a re-offering.' '. . . . Thee for Indra!' he says each time at the midday feast, for the midday feast is sacred to Indra.</p>  
<p>Twice he touches the sth&acirc;l&icirc; with 'Thou art a re-offering;' and silently he puts it down the third time.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:2:3:18">4:2:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. But, in order to avoid sameness (of performance), let him not take it out with the 'support;' nor let him deposit it in the 'womb;' for this (Ukthya</p>

<p>libation) has at first been taken with the 'support,' and it has at first been deposited in the womb;--and were he now also to take it with the 'support,' and deposit it in the 'womb,' he would assuredly commit (the fault of) sameness. And as to his touching the sth&acirc;l&icirc; with 'Thou art a re-offering,' he will indeed again take a libation therefrom. Let him not heed this, but let him put down (the vessel) silently.</p>

The same phrase occurs I, 9, I, 24, where I translated 'will ensure dominion,'--probably wrongly, though I am by no means sure of the correct meaning. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a there seems to take it in the sense of 'he bids (the gods grant his request), thus having chiefly his own interest in view'--'pra<I>s</I>&acirc;syante &#8217;to dev&acirc;<I>h</I> pr&acirc;rthyam&acirc;n&acirc; iti pra<I>s</I>&acirc;sanam parusha<I>m</I> sy&acirc;t s&acirc;ksh&acirc;t sv&acirc;rthaparatva<I>m</I> kury&acirc;d ity artha<I>h</I>.'
