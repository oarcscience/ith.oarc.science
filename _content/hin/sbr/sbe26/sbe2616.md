#### THE TÂNÛNAPTRA, OR COVENANT OF TANÛNAPÂT <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_247).

### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:1">3:4:2:1</span></span>1. When
the gods had performed the guest-offering, discord befell them. They
separated into four different parties, unwilling to yield to each
other's excellence,--Agni, with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras,
Varu*n*a with the Âdityas, and Indra with the Maruts. B*ri*haspati with
the All-gods, say some <span id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_248), but,
indeed, those who separated into four parties were 'all the gods.' When
they were separated, the Asura-Rakshas came after them and entered
between them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:2">3:4:2:2</span></span>2. They
became aware of it,--'Forsooth, we are in an evil plight, the
Asura-Rakshas have come in between us: we shall fall a prey to our
enemies. Let us come to an agreement and yield to the excellence of one
of us!' They yielded to the excellence of Indra; wherefore it is said,
'Indra is all the deities, the gods have Indra for their chief.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:3">3:4:2:3</span></span>3. For
this reason let not kinsmen fall out, for any (enemy) of theirs, be he
ever so far away, steps in between them; they do what pleases their
enemies and fall a prey to their enemies: therefore let them not fall
out. For he who, knowing this, quarrels not, does what displeases his
enemies and

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

falls not a prey to his enemies: let him therefore not quarrel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:4">3:4:2:4</span></span>4. They
said, 'Well then, let us contrive so that this (concord) of ours shall
be for ever imperishable!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:5">3:4:2:5</span></span>5. The
gods laid down together <span id="fr_250"></span>[1](#fn_249) their
favourite forms and desirable powers <span
id="fr_251"></span>[2](#fn_250), one after another, and said, 'Thereby
he shall be away from us, he shall be scattered to the winds, whosoever
shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!'--'Whose (is it) as
witness <span id="fr_252"></span>[3](#fn_251)?'--'Tanûnapât, the
mighty!'--Now the mighty Tanûnapât indeed is yonder blowing (wind), he
is the witness of living beings, entering thus as the in-breathing and
out-breathing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:6">3:4:2:6</span></span>6.
Wherefore they say, 'The gods know the mind of man.' In his mind he
proposes; it passes on to the breath, and the breath to the wind, and
the wind tells the gods what the mind of man is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:7">3:4:2:7</span></span>7. Hence
it was in regard to this what was said by the *Ri*shi, 'In his mind he
proposeth, and it goeth on to the wind <span
id="fr_253"></span>[4](#fn_252); and the wind telleth the gods what thy
mind is, O man.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:8">3:4:2:8</span></span>8. The
gods laid down together their favourite forms and desirable powers, and
said, 'Thereby he shall be away from us, he shall be scattered to the
winds, whosoever shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!' And even now
the gods do not transgress that (covenant), for how would they fare,
were they

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

to transgress it?--they would speak untruth, and verily there is one law
which the gods do keep, namely, the truth. It is through this that their
conquest, their glory is unassailable: and so, forsooth, is his
conquest, his glory unassailable whosoever, knowing this, speaks the
truth. Now, the Tânûnaptra is really that same (covenant of the gods).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:9">3:4:2:9</span></span>9. The
gods laid down together their favourite forms and desirable powers. Now
it is by taking portions of butter that they (the priests) lay down
together the desirable forms and favourite powers. Let him, then, not
covenant with any one and every one, lest his favourite forms and
desirable powers should be mixed up (with those of others). But let him
not deceive one with whom he makes a covenant; for thus it is said, 'Let
there be no deceiving of him with whom one has made the covenant of
Tanûnapât.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:10">3:4:2:10</span></span>10. In
the first place he takes (butter) therefrom <span
id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_253), with the text (Vâ*g*. S. V, 5), 'For
him that rushes onward, for him that rushes about, I take thee.' He that
blows yonder (the wind) does indeed rush onward and rush about; and it
is for him that he takes (the butter): therefore he says, 'for him that
rushes onward, for him that rushes about, I take thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:11">3:4:2:11</span></span>11.
'For Tanûnapât, the mighty.' The mighty Tanûnapât truly is yonder
blowing (wind), and it is for him that he takes (the butter): therefore
he says, 'For Tanûnapât, the mighty.'

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:12">3:4:2:12</span></span>12.
'For the powerful, the most strong!' He is indeed powerful and most
strong; and for him he takes it: therefore he says, 'For the powerful,
the most strong.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:13">3:4:2:13</span></span>13.
They then touch it at the same time. Now the gods were fully agreed on
this point, 'Verily, so and thus shall he of us fare who shall
transgress this (covenant) of ours!' And so are these (priests and
sacrificer) now agreed on this,--'Verily, so and thus shall he of us
fare who shall transgress this (covenant) of ours!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:14">3:4:2:14</span></span>14.
They touch it simultaneously, with the text, 'Thou art the strength of
the gods, unassailed and unassailable; for the gods were indeed
unassailed and unassailable while being together, and speaking with one
accord and holding together.' 'The strength of the gods' doubtless means
the favourite forms and desirable powers of the gods, 'uncursed,
curse-averting, uncursable,' for the gods have overcome every
curse;--'May I straightway go to the truth!' whereby he means to say,
'May I speak the truth, may I not transgress this
(covenant);'--'Establish me in welfare!' for in welfare the gods indeed
established themselves by speaking the truth, by performing the truth:
therefore he says, 'Establish me in welfare!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:15">3:4:2:15</span></span>15. Now
those favourite forms and desirable powers which the gods put together,
they then deposited in Indra <span
id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_254);--Indra verily is he that burns yonder
(the sun); but he indeed did not burn in the beginning, but as now
everything else is dark, so was he then; and it is by that very energy
(derived

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

from those divine objects) that he burns. Hence, if many persons perform
the consecration <span id="fr_256"></span>[1](#fn_255), let it (the
Tânûnaptra butter), after pouring the fast-milk to it, be handed only to
the master of the house, since he, among them, is the representative of
Indra. And if he perform the consecration by means of an (offering) with
a dakshi*n*â, let them hand it (the butter) to the sacrificer, after
pouring the fast-milk to it, for thus it is said,--'The Sacrificer is
Indra.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:4:2:16">3:4:2:16</span></span>16. Now
what favourite forms and desirable powers the gods then laid together,
all that was wrought together and became the Sâman: wherefore they say,
'The Sâman is the truth, the Sâman is born of the gods.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_247"></span>[93:1](sbe2616.htm#fr_248) The Tânûnaptra is a
solemn covenant made by the sacrificer and his priests, in the name of
Tanûnapât, and while touching sacrificial butter; thereby pledging
themselves not to injure each other.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[93:2](sbe2616.htm#fr_249) Thus Ait. Br. I, 24,
where moreover the Rudras are assigned to Indra, (the Vasus to Agni, and
the Âdityas to Varu*n*a.)

<span id="fn_249"></span>[94:1](sbe2616.htm#fr_250) Literally, 'cut off
together, part by part.'

<span id="fn_250"></span>[94:2](sbe2616.htm#fr_251) Or, attributes,
resources, 'dhâmâni.'

<span id="fn_251"></span>[94:3](sbe2616.htm#fr_252) Kasya upadrash*t*ur;
the Kâ*n*va text has, Tasya na*h* ka upadrash*t*â, 'who (shall be) the
witness of this (covenant) of ours?'

<span id="fn_252"></span>[94:4](sbe2616.htm#fr_253) Cp. Atharva-veda
XII, 4, 32, 'In his mind he proposes and it goes forth to the gods.'

<span id="fn_253"></span>[95:1](sbe2616.htm#fr_254) Viz. the butter in
the dhruvâ spoon, pouring it into the 'vratapradâna,' or vessel in which
the fast-milk is handed to the sacrificer.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[96:1](sbe2616.htm#fr_255) According to Ait.
Br. I, 24 the gods deposited their forms in the house of king Varu*n*a.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[97:1](sbe2616.htm#fr_256) That is, in a Sattra
or sacrificial session, where all the officiating priests are
consecrated and 'sacrificers;' the Ya*g*amâna proper being styled
G*ri*hapati (master of the house). See [IV, 6, 8,
1](sbe2677.htm#4:6:8:1) seq.
