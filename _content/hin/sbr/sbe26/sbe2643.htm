Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, forsooth, are his intelligence and will; and as such belonging to his self: whenever he desires anything in his mind, as 'Would that this were mine!

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:2">4:1:4:2</A></FONT></span>2. Now in the beginning these two, the priesthood and the nobility, were separate: then Mitra, the priesthood, could stand without Varu<I>n</I>a, the nobility.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:3">4:1:4:3</A></FONT></span>3. Not Varu<I>n</I>a, the nobility, without Mitra, the priesthood: whatever deed Varu<I>n</I>a did unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein, forsooth, he succeeded not.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:4">4:1:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. Varu<I>n</I>a, the nobility, then called upon Mitra, the priesthood, saying, 'Turn thou unto me that we may unite: I will place thee foremost, sped by thee, I will do deeds!'--'So be it!' So the two united; and therefrom resulted that graha to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:5">4:1:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. Such, then, is the office of Purohita (placed foremost, domestic priest). Wherefore let not a Br&acirc;hman desire to become the Purohita of any one Kshatriya (he may meet with), as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness unite; nor should a Kshatriya make any Br&acirc;hman (he may meet with) his Purohita, as thereby righteousness and unrighteousness unite.--Whatever deed, sped by Mitra, the priesthood, Varu<I>n</I>a thenceforward did, in that he succeeded.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:6">4:1:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. Hence it is quite proper that a Br&acirc;hman should be without a king, but were he to obtain a king, it would be conducive to the success (of both). It is, however, quite improper that a king should be without a Br&acirc;hman, for whatever deed he does, unsped by Mitra, the priesthood, therein he succeeds not. Wherefore a Kshatriya who intends to do a deed ought by all means to resort to a Br&acirc;hman, for</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_271"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 271</FONT></A></p>  
<p>he verily succeeds only in the deed sped by the Br&acirc;hman.</p>

Now he draws (the Maitr&acirc;-varu<I>n</I>a graha) from that (stream of Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_651"></A><A HREF="#fn_649"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 9; Rig-veda II, 41, 4), 'This Soma, O Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, hath been pressed for you; ye holy, now hear my cry!--Thou art taken with a support&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_652"></A><A HREF="#fn_650"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!--Thee for Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:8">4:1:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. He mixes it with milk. The reason why he mixes it with milk is this. Soma, forsooth, was V<I>ri</I>tra. Now when the gods slew him, they said to Mitra, 'Thou also slayest!' But he liked it not and said, 'Surely, I am every one's friend (mitra): being no friend, I shall become an enemy (or, other than Mitra, Amitra).'--'Then we shall exclude thee from the sacrifice!'--Then said he, 'I, too, slay!' Thereupon the cattle went from him, saying, 'Being a friend, he has become an enemy!' Thus he was deprived of the cattle. By mixing (the Soma) with milk, the gods then supplied him with cattle; and in like manner does this (priest) now supply him (the sacrificer or Mitra) with cattle by mixing (the Soma) with milk.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:9">4:1:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. As to this they say, 'Surely he liked it not to slay!' Thus, what milk there is in this (mixture) that belongs to Mitra, but the Soma belongs to Varu<I>n</I>a: therefore one mixes it with milk.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:4:10">4:1:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. He mixes it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 10; Rig-veda IV, 42, 10), 'May we delight in the wealth we have gained, the gods in the offering, the kine in pasture! that unfailing milch cow,</p>

Now as to why he says, 'Thee for truth and life,'--the truth is Mitra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_654"></A><A HREF="#fn_652"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, since Mitra is the Brahman, and the truth is the Brahman (sacerdotium or sacred writ);--and life is Varu<I>n</I>a, since Varu<I>n</I>a is the year, and life is the year: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for truth and life!'</p>
