### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:1">3:8:4:1</span></span>1. Now
there are three elevens at the animal offering,--eleven fore-offerings,
eleven after-offerings, and eleven by-offerings: ten fingers, ten toes,
ten vital airs, and the out-breathing, in-breathing and
through-breathing--this much constitutes man, who is the highest of
animals, after whom <span id="fr_532"></span>[3](#fn_530) are all
animals.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:2">3:8:4:2</span></span>2. Now
they say,' What, then, is done at the sacrifice whereby the vital air is
kindly to all the limbs?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:3">3:8:4:3</span></span>3. When
he divides the hind-part into three portions,--the hind-part being (an
opening of the) vital air, and that (animal) extending from thence
forward, that vital air pervades it all through.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:4">3:8:4:4</span></span>4. And in
that he cuts the hind-part into three portions,--one third for the
by-offerings, one third into the *g*uhû, and one third into the
upabh*ri*t,--thereby the vital air is kindly to all the limbs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:5">3:8:4:5</span></span>5. He
alone, however, may slay an animal who can supply it with the
sacrificial essence <span id="fr_533"></span>[1](#fn_531). And if it be
lean, let him stuff into the hind-part whatever may be left of the fat
of the belly: the hind-part being (an opening of) the vital air, and
that (animal) extending from thence forward, that vital air pervades it
all through. The animal, forsooth, is breath; for only so long (does)
the animal (live), as it breathes with the breath; but when the breath
departs from it, it lies there useless, even (as) a block of wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:6">3:8:4:6</span></span>6. The
hind-part is (part of) the animal, and fat means sacrificial
essence <span id="fr_534"></span>[2](#fn_532): thus he supplies it with
the sacrificial essence. But if it be tender (juicy), then it has itself
obtained the sacrificial essence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:7">3:8:4:7</span></span>7.
Thereupon he takes clotted ghee; for twofold indeed is this (clotted
ghee),--to wit, both ghee

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

and sour milk <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_533),--and a productive
union means a couple: thus a productive union is thereby effected.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:8">3:8:4:8</span></span>8.
Therewith they perform at the after-offerings. The after-offerings mean
cattle, and clotted ghee means milk: hence he thereby puts milk into the
cattle, and thus milk is here contained (or beneficial, Nita) in the
cattle; for clotted ghee means breath, because clotted ghee is food, and
breath is food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:9">3:8:4:9</span></span>9.
Therewith he (the Adhvaryu) performs in front (on the Âhavanîya) at the
after-offerings,---whereby he puts into (the victim) that vital air
which is here in front;--and therewith he (the Pratiprasthât*ri*)
performs behind (the altar) at the by-offerings <span
id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_534),--whereby he puts into it that vital air
which is here behind: thus two vital airs are here contained (or
beneficial) on both sides, the one above and the one below.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:10">3:8:4:10</span></span>10.
Here now, one (Hot*ri*) pronounces the Vasha*t* for two,--for the
Adhvaryu (who performs the after-offerings)

<span id="page_213">p. 213</span>

and for him (the Pratiprasthât*ri*) who performs the by-offerings. And
because he offers them by (in addition to) the offering (Adhvaryu),
therefore they are called by-offerings. And in performing the
by-offerings, he produces (offspring) <span
id="fr_537"></span>[1](#fn_535), since he performs the by-offerings
behind (the altar), and from behind offspring is produced from woman.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:11">3:8:4:11</span></span>11. He
offers the by-offerings with (Vâ*g*. S. VI, 21), 'Go thou to the sea,
Hail!' The sea is water, and seed is water: he thereby casts seed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:12">3:8:4:12</span></span>12. 'Go
thou to the air, Hail!' It is into (along) the air that offspring is
born: into the air he produces (offspring).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:13">3:8:4:13</span></span>13. 'Go
thou to the divine Savit*ri*, Hail!' Savit*ri* is the impeller of the
gods: impelled by Savit*ri* he thus produces creatures.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:14">3:8:4:14</span></span>14. 'Go
thou to Mitra and Varu*n*a, Hail!' Mitra and Varu*n*a are the
out-breathing and in-breathing: he thus bestows out-breathing and
in-breathing on the creatures.

15\. 'Go thou to the day and the night, Hail! It is through (along) day
and night that offspring is born: through day and night he causes
creatures to be born.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:16">3:8:4:16</span></span>16. 'Go
thou to the metres, Hail!' There are seven metres; and there are seven
domestic and seven wild animals: both kinds he thus causes to be
produced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:17">3:8:4:17</span></span>17. 'Go
thou to heaven and earth, Hail!' For, Pra*g*âpati, having created the
living beings,

<span id="page_214">p. 214</span>

enclosed them between heaven and earth, and so these beings are enclosed
between heaven and earth. And in like manner does this (offerer), having
created living beings, enclose them between heaven and earth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:8:4:18">3:8:4:18</span></span>18. He
then makes additional by-offerings (atiupaya*g*). Were he not to make
additional by-offerings, there would only be as many living beings as
were created in the beginning; they would not be propagated; but by
making additional by-offerings he indeed propagates them; whence
creatures are again born here repeatedly <span
id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_536).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_530"></span>[210:3](sbe2634.htm#fr_532) That is, inferior
to whom, or, after the manner of whom.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[211:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_533) Sâya*n*a takes
'medham' as apposition to 'enam,' and explains it by 'medhârha,
prav*ri*ddha,' and 'upanayet' by 'prâpnuyât' (it is, doubtless,
'zuführen'). The Kâ*n*va text, however, reads,--Tad âhu*h* sa vai
pa*s*u*m* labheteti ya ena*m* medha upanayed iti.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[211:2](sbe2634.htm#fr_534) Gudo vai pa*s*u*h*,
medo vai medhas; this is one of many exceptions to the rule laid down by
Professor Delbrück regarding the order of subject and predicate, Synt.
Forsch., III, p. 26. Copulative sentences with a tertium comparationis
likewise do not generally conform to that rule.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[212:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_535) See [p.
156](sbe2625.htm#page_156), note [3](sbe2625.htm#fn_414).

<span id="fn_534"></span>[212:2](sbe2634.htm#fr_536) When the priests
and sacrificer have eaten their portions of the I*d*â, the Agnîdh
fetches hot coals from the *S*âmitra (or, at the animal offering
connected with the Soma-sacrifice), optionally from the Âgnîdhra, and
puts them on the Hot*ri*'s hearth ([p. 148](sbe2623.htm#page_148), note
[4](sbe2624.htm#fn_392)),--or at the ordinary animal offering (nirû*dh*a
pa*s*u), on the north hip (north-west corner) of the altar after
removing the sacrificial grass. On these coals the Pratiprasthât*ri*
performs the by-offerings (upaya*g*), while the Adhvaryu performs the
after-offerings (anuyâ*g*a) on the Âhavanîya. For the by-offerings the
Pratiprasthât*ri* cuts the respective part and the hind-quarter ([III,
8, 3, 18](sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:18)) into eleven parts, and at each Vasha*t*
throws one piece thereof with his hand into the fire. The recipients of
the first eight and the last after-offerings, on the other hand, are the
same as those of the nine after-offerings at the Seasonal sacrifices
(part i, p. 404). The Hot*ri*'s formulas for the additional two
offerings, inserted before the last, are: 9. The divine lord of the
forest \[10. The divine barhis of water-plants\] may graciously accept
(the offering) for abundant obtainment of abundant gift! Vausha*t*!'
(cf. part i, p. 235; Â*s*v. *S*r. III, 6, 13.)

<span id="fn_535"></span>[213:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_537) Praivaina*m* ta*g*
*g*anayati, 'he causes it (the victim) to be born (again).' Kâ*n*va rec.
The above passage has apparently to be understood in a general sense,
'he causes birth to take place among living creatures.'

<span id="fn_536"></span>[214:1](sbe2634.htm#fr_538) Or, 'by making
additional by-offerings he reproduces them: whence creatures are born
here returning again and again' (metempsychosis).
