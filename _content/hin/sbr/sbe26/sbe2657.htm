<p>draw for men, so do the harnessed metres draw the sacrifice for the gods. And whenever the metres gratified the gods, then the gods gratified the metres. Now it has been previous to this, that the harnessed metres have drawn the sacrifice to the gods, that they have gratified them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_861"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:</p>

He now draws the H&acirc;riyo<I>g</I>ana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_862"></A><A HREF="#fn_859"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> graha--the H&acirc;riyo<I>g</I>ana being the metres--it is the metres he thereby gratifies: this is why he draws the H&acirc;riyo<I>g</I>ana graha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:3">4:4:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. He draws it as an additional (libation); since</p>

<p>he draws it when he (the Hot<I>ri</I>) pronounces the 'All-hail and blessing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_863"></A><A HREF="#fn_860"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.' For there are here the gods, and the metres in addition to them; and there are men, and beasts in addition to them: therefore he draws it as an additional one.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:4">4:4:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. He draws it in the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a. Now Soma was V<I>ri</I>tra. When the gods slew him, his head rolled off&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_864"></A><A HREF="#fn_861"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: it became the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a. Thereinto flowed together so much of the juice as it could hold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_865"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; that was in excess; and so is this graha in excess: he thus puts the excess. to the excess,--therefore he draws it in the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:5">4:4:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. He draws it without a puroru<I>k</I>-formula, for he draws it for the metres; and in that he draws it for the metres, even thereby that (graha) of his becomes supplied with a puroru<I>k</I>: therefore he draws it without a puroru<I>k</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:6">4:4:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. He now draws it from that (&Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a graha) with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, it), 'Thou art taken with a support: of bay colour art thou, meet for the team of bay steeds,--thee to the pair of bay steeds!' Now, the two bay horses are the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> and S&acirc;man: it is for the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> and S&acirc;man that he draws it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:7">4:4:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. He then pours parched grain into it with, 'Ye are the bays&#8217; grains, united with the Soma for</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:9">4:4:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. Placing (the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a) on his head, he calls for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,--for this (vessel) is his (Soma's) head. He first says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) for the Soma-draughts with grains!' Having called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, he says, 'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I> to pronounce the offering prayer on) the Soma-draughts with grain brought forward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_868"></A><A HREF="#fn_865"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!' and offers as the Vasha<I>t</I> and Anuvasha<I>t</I> are uttered. They then divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:10">4:4:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Now some take the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a over to the Hot<I>ri</I>, on the ground that 'the draught belongs to the utterer of the Vasha<I>t</I>.' But let him not do it thus; for the other draughts are (taken by the respective priests) according to the <I>k</I>amasa cups, but this one is in excess: therefore there is a draught in it for all of them,--for this reason they divide the grain between them for the sake of the Soma-draught.</p>

They must not bite them with their teeth,--for these (grains) mean cattle,--thinking 'lest we should do aught to crush our cattle!' They only drink it in with their breath&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_869"></A><A HREF="#fn_866"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with (V&acirc;,;. S. VIII, 12), 'What horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_870"></A><A HREF="#fn_867"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;' for they are cattle: therefore he says, 'what horse-winning, what cow-winning draught is thine;'--'Of that draught, offered with Ya<I>g</I>us, praised by chants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_868"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,'--for Ya<I>g</I>us-prayers have indeed been offered, and chants have been chanted;--'sung by hymns,'--for songs (<I>s</I>astras) have been sung;--'Of the invited&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_869"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> do I drink, invited,'--for invited, he now drinks of the invited.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:12">4:4:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. They must not throw them into the fire, lest they offer remains (of offerings) in the fire. They rather throw them on the high altar: thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:13">4:4:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. Thereupon they touch the vessels filled (with water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>) which some call Apsushom&acirc;<I>h</I> (Soma-draughts in water). For even as a yoked (animal) draws, so</p>

<p><A NAME="page_374"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 374</FONT></A></p>  
<p>do they who perform the priestly duties. But the yoked (animal) galls or scratches itself; and water is a means of soothing, a medicine: thus wherever in this (sacrifice) they gall or scratch themselves--water being a means of soothing--they soothe by that means of soothing, water; they heal it by water. This is why they touch the vessels filled (with water).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:14">4:4:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. They touch them with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 14), 'With lustre, with sap, with bodies&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> have we united,--with the happy spirit: may Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, the dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured in our body!' thus they heal what was torn.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:4:3:15">4:4:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. They then touch their faces. There is a twofold reason why they touch their faces;--water, forsooth, is the elixir of immortality: it is with the elixir of immortality that they thus touch themselves. And, moreover, they thus deposit that holy work into their own self: therefore they touch their faces.</p>
