<p>than its (the sacrifice's) congeners&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_395"></A><A HREF="#fn_393"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. They have the same marks, and those which have the same marks are congeners; and these, then, are those (corresponding limbs) of its trunk.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:2">3:6:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. Now Soma was in heaven, and the gods were here on earth. The gods desired, 'Would that Soma might come to us; we might sacrifice with him, when come.' They produced those two illusions, Supar<I>n</I>&icirc; and Kadr&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_396"></A><A HREF="#fn_394"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; Supar<I>n</I>&icirc;, forsooth, was V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_397"></A><A HREF="#fn_395"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, and Kadr&ucirc; was this (earth). They caused discord between them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:3">3:6:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. They then disputed and said, 'Which of us shall spy furthest, shall win the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_396"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.'--'So be it!' Kadr&ucirc; then said, 'Espy thou!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:4">3:6:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. Supar<I>n</I>&icirc; said, 'On yonder shore of this ocean there stands a white horse at a post, that I see; doest thou also see it?'--'I verily do!' Then said Kadr&ucirc; 'Its tail was just now hanging down; there, now the wind tosses it, that I see.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:5">3:6:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Now when Supar<I>n</I>&icirc; said, 'On yonder shore of this ocean,' the ocean, forsooth, is the altar, she thereby meant the altar; 'there stands a white horse at a post,' the white horse, forsooth, is Agni, and the post means the sacrificial stake. And when Kadr&ucirc; said, 'Its tail was just now hanging down;</p>

<p>there, now the wind tosses it, that I see;' this is nothing else than the rope.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:6">3:6:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Supar<I>n</I>&icirc; then said, 'Come, let us now fly thither to know which of us is the winner.' Kadr&ucirc; said, 'Fly thou thither; thou wilt tell us, which of us is the winner.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:7">3:6:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. Supar<I>n</I>&icirc; then flew thither; and it was even as Kadr&ucirc; had said. When she had returned, she (Kadr&ucirc;) said to her, 'Hast thou won, or I?'--'Thou!' she replied. Such is the story called Supar<I>n</I>&icirc;-K&acirc;drava&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:8">3:6:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then said Kadr&ucirc;, 'Verily I have won thine own self; yonder is Soma in the heaven: fetch him hither for the gods, and thereby redeem thyself from the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!'--'So be it!' She brought forth the metres; and that G&acirc;yatr&icirc; fetched Soma from heaven.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:9">3:6:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. He was enclosed between two golden cups&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; sharp-edged they closed together at every twinkling of the eye; and these two, forsooth, were Consecration and Penance. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens watched over him; they are these hearths, these fire-priests.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:10">3:6:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. She tore off one of the two cups, and gave it to the gods,--this was Consecration: therewith the gods consecrated themselves,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_151"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 151</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:11">3:6:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. She then tore off the second cup, and gave it to the gods,--this was Penance: therewith the gods underwent penance, to wit the Upasads, for the Upasads are penance.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:12">3:6:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. She took possession (&acirc;-<I>k</I>akh&acirc;da)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_402"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of Soma by means of (a stick of) khadira wood (Acacia Catechu), whence (the name) Khadira; and because she thereby took possession of him, therefore the sacrificial stake and the wooden sword (sphya) are of khadira wood.</p>  
<p>She then carried him off while he was under the charge of the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka, wherefore this A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka priest was excluded (from drinking Soma).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:13">3:6:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures, whence the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka priest belongs to Indra and Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:14">3:6:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. Therefore the consecrated keep charge of the king (Soma), 'lest (the Gandharvas) should carry him off.' Let him therefore guard him diligently, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is excluded (from the Soma).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:15">3:6:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. Wherefore the students guard their teacher, his house, and cattle, lest he should be taken from them. Let him therefore guard him (Soma) diligently in that place, for verily in whosesoever charge they carry him off, he is excluded therefrom. By means of him Supar<I>n</I>&icirc; redeemed herself from the gods; wherefore they say, 'He who has sacrificed shares in the world of bliss.'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_152"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 152</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:16">3:6:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. Verily, even in being born, man, by his own self, is born as a debt (owing) to death. And in that he sacrifices, thereby he redeems himself from death, even as Supar<I>n</I>&icirc; then redeemed herself from the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:17">3:6:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. The gods worshipped with him. Those Gandharva Soma-wardens came after him; and having come up they said, 'Do ye let us share in the sacrifice, exclude us not from the sacrifice; let there be for us also a share in the sacrifice!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:18">3:6:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. They said, 'What will there be for us, then?'--'Even as in yonder world we have been his keepers, so also will we be his keepers here on earth!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:19">3:6:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. The gods spake, 'So be it!' By saying, '(Here are) your Soma-wages . . .' he assigns to them the price of the Soma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_403"></A><A HREF="#fn_401"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. They then said unto them, 'At the third pressing an offering of ghee shall fall to your share, but not one of Soma, for the Soma-draught has been taken from you, wherefore ye are not worthy of a Soma-offering!' And accordingly, when he pours ghee on the hearths by means of fagots&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_402"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, at the evening libation, that same offering of ghee falls to their share, but not one of Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:20">3:6:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. 'And what they will offer in the fire that will satiate you;' hence that which they offer in the fire satiates them. 'And when they will move about, holding the Soma over each&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_405"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that will satiate you;' hence when they move about, holding the Soma over each (hearth), that satiates them.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_153"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 153</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Wherefore let not the Adhvaryu pass between&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_406"></A><A HREF="#fn_404"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the hearths, for the Adhvaryu carries the Soma, and they sit waiting for him (Soma) with open mouths, and he would enter into their open mouths; and either Agni would burn him, or else that god who rules over beasts (Rudra) would seek after him; hence whenever the Adhvaryu should have business in the hall, let him pass north of the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra shed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:21">3:6:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. Now it is for the protection of Soma that those (hearths) are thrown up, to wit the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya in front (on the high altar), the M&acirc;r<I>g</I>&acirc;l&icirc;ya in the south, and the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhr&icirc;ya in the north; and those that are in the Sadas (protect him) from behind.</p>

And, in truth, they themselves insisted thereon, saying, 'They shall in part raise us, and in part they shall assign us; thus we shall know again that heavenly world from which we have come, thus we shall not go astray.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:23">3:6:2:23</A></FONT></span>23. And whichever of them are raised they are</p>

<p>thereby visibly in this world; but whichever of them are assigned they are thereby visibly in yonder world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:24">3:6:2:24</A></FONT></span>24. They have two names; for, in truth, they themselves insisted thereon, saying, 'We have not prospered with these names, since Soma has been taken away from us; well, then, let us take each a second name!' They took each a second name, and therewith prospered, inasmuch as they from whom the Soma-draught had been taken had a share in the sacrifice assigned to them; hence they have two names. Wherefore let a Brahman, if he prosper not, take a second name, for verily he prospers, whosoever, knowing this, takes a second name.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:6:2:25">3:6:2:25</A></FONT></span>25.

<P><A NAME="fn_392"></A><A HREF="sbe2624.htm#fr_394">148:4</A> There are altogether eight dhish<I>n</I>yas, two of which, viz. the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra and the M&acirc;r<I>g</I>&acirc;l&icirc;ya, are raised north and south of the back part of the cart-shed (havirdh&acirc;na) respectively; while the other six are raised inside the Sadas along the east side of it, viz. five of them north of the 'spine,' belonging (from south to north) to the Hot<I>ri</I>, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>kh</I>a<I>m</I>si, Pot<I>ri</I>, Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, and A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka respectively; and one south of the spine, exactly south-east of the Udumbara post, for the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a (or Pra<I>s</I>&acirc;st<I>ri</I>) priest. These six priests, together with the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra, are called the 'seven Hot<I>ri</I>s.' The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra and M&acirc;r<I>g</I>&acirc;l&icirc;ya have square sheds with four posts erected over them, open on the east side and on the side facing the cart-shed. The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra hearth is thrown up first, and the M&acirc;r<I>g</I>&acirc;l&icirc;ya last of all; and the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's immediately after that of the Hot<I>ri</I>.
