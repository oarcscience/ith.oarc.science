### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:1">4:1:3:1</span></span>1. The
Aindra-vâyava (graha), forsooth, is his speech; and as such belonging to
his self <span id="fr_637"></span>[1](#fn_635). Now Indra, when he had
hurled the thunderbolt at V*ri*tra, thinking himself to be the weaker,
and fearing lest he had not laid him low, hid himself. The gods also hid
themselves away in the same place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:2">4:1:3:2</span></span>2. The
gods then said, 'Verily, we know not if V*ri*tra be slain or alive:
come, let one of us find out, if V*ri*tra be slain or alive!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:3">4:1:3:3</span></span>3. They
said unto Vâyu--Vâyu, forsooth, is he that blows yonder--'Find thou out,
O Vâyu, if V*ri*tra be slain or alive; for thou art the swiftest among
us: if he lives, thou indeed wilt quickly return hither.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:4">4:1:3:4</span></span>4. He
spake, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'The first Vasha*t* of king
Soma!'--'So be it!' so Vâyu went, and lo <span
id="fr_638"></span>[2](#fn_636) V*ri*tra slain. He spake, 'V*ri*tra is
slain: do ye with the slain what ye list!'

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:5">4:1:3:5</span></span>5. The
gods rushed thither,--as (those) eager to take possession of their
property, so (it fared with) him (V*ri*tra--Soma) <span
id="fr_639"></span>[1](#fn_637): what (part of him) one of them seized,
that became an ekadevatya (graha, belonging to one deity), and what two
of them, that became a dvidevatya <span id="fr_640"></span>[2](#fn_638),
and what many (seized), that became a bahudevatya;--and because they
caught him up each separately (vi-grah) by means of vessels, therefore
(the libations) are called graha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:6">4:1:3:6</span></span>6. He
stank in their nostrils,--sour and putrid he blew towards them: he was
neither fit for offering, nor was he fit for drinking.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:7">4:1:3:7</span></span>7. The
gods said to Vâyu, 'Vâyu, blow thou through him, make him palatable for
us!' He said, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'After thee they shall
name those cups.'--'So be it!' he said, 'but blow ye along with me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:8">4:1:3:8</span></span>8. The
gods dispelled some of that smell, and laid it into the cattle,--this is
that foul smell in (dead) cattle: hence one must not close (his nose) at
that foul smell, since it is the smell of king Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:9">4:1:3:9</span></span>9. Nor
must one spit thereat <span id="fr_641"></span>[3](#fn_639); even though
he should think himself ever so much affected, let him

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

go round it windward <span id="fr_642"></span>[1](#fn_640); for Soma
means eminence, and disease meanness: even as at the approach of his
superior the meaner man would get down (from his seat), so does disease
go down before him (Soma).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:10">4:1:3:10</span></span>10.
Then Vâyu blew a second time through him and thereby made him palatable;
whereupon he was fit for offering and fit for drinking. Hence those
(vessels), though belonging to various deities, are called 'vâyavya
(Vâyu's vessels) <span id="fr_643"></span>[2](#fn_641).' His (Vâyu's) is
that first Vasha*t* of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named
after him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:11">4:1:3:11</span></span>11.
Indra then thought within himself:--'Vâyu, forsooth, has the largest
share of this our sacrifice, since his is the first Vasha*t* of king
Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him: nay, but I, too,
will desire a share therein!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:12">4:1:3:12</span></span>12. He
said, 'Vâyu, let me share in this cup!'--'What will then be?'--'Speech
shall speak intelligibly <span id="fr_644"></span>[3](#fn_642)!'--'If
speech will speak intelligibly, then will I let thee share!' Thus that
cup henceforward belonged to Indra and Vâyu, but theretofore it belonged
to Vâyu alone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:13">4:1:3:13</span></span>13.
Indra said, 'One half of this cup is mine!'--'Only one fourth is thine!'
said Vâyu.--'One half is mine!' said Indra.--'Only one fourth is thine!'
said Vâyu.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:14">4:1:3:14</span></span>14.
They went to Pra*g*âpati for his decision. Pra*g*âpati divided the cup
(of Soma) into two parts and said, 'This (half) is Vâyu's!' Then he
divided the (other) half into two parts and said, 'This is

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vâyu's!--This is
thine!' then he assigned to Indra a fourth part for his share--one
fourth is the same as a quarter: henceforward that cup belonged, one
fourth of it, to Indra.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:15">4:1:3:15</span></span>15. Now
with this libation there are two puroru*k* <span
id="fr_645"></span>[1](#fn_643)--formulas,--the first belonging to Vâyu
alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two invitatory prayers
(anuvâkyâ),--the, first to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu;
and two praisha (directions),--the first belonging to Vâyu alone, and
the second to Indra and Vâyu; and two offering prayers (yâ*g*yâ),--the
first to Vâyu alone, and the second to Indra and Vâyu: thus he assigns
to him (Indra) each time a fourth part for his share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:16">4:1:3:16</span></span>16. He
said, 'If they have assigned to me a fourth part each time for my share,
then speech shall speak intelligibly only one fourth part!' Hence only
that fourth part of speech is intelligible which men speak; but that
fourth part of speech which beasts speak is unintelligible; and that
fourth part of speech which birds speak is unintelligible; and that
fourth part of speech which the small vermin here speaks is
unintelligible.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:17">4:1:3:17</span></span>17.
Wherefore it has been thus spoken by the *Ri*shi (Rig-veda I, 164,
45):--'Four are the measured grades of speech; the Brâhmans that are
wise know them: three, deposited in secret, move not; the fourth grade
of speech men speak.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:18">4:1:3:18</span></span>18. He
now draws (the graha) from that (stream of Soma) <span
id="fr_646"></span>[2](#fn_644), with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 7; Rig-veda VII,
92, I), 'Come nigh to us, O Vâyu, sipping of

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

the pure (Soma)! Thine are a thousand steeds, O bestower of all boons!
Unto thee hath been offered the gladdening juice whereof thou, O God,
takest the first draught!--Thee for Vâyu!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:1:3:19">4:1:3:19</span></span>19.
And, having withdrawn (the cup), he again fills it <span
id="fr_647"></span>[1](sbe2643.htm#fn_645), with (Vâ*g*. S. VII, 8; Rig
veda I, 2, 4), 'O Indra and Vâyu, here is Soma-juice: come ye hither for
the refreshing draught, the drops long for you!--Thou art taken with a
support <span id="fr_648"></span>[2](sbe2643.htm#fn_646)!--Thee for
Vâyu, for Indra and Vâyu!'--with 'This is thy womb <span
id="fr_649"></span>[3](sbe2643.htm#fn_647): thee for the closely
united!' he deposits (the cup). As to why he says, 'Thee for the closely
united,'--he who is Vâyu, is Indra; and he who is Indra, is Vâyu:
therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for the closely united!'

<span id="fn_635"></span>[265:1](sbe2642.htm#fr_637) That is, to
Ya*gñ*a's body (madhyadeha, Sây.) as distinguished from his limbs. The
Petersb. Dict. takes adhyâtmam in the sense of 'in regard to the self
(or person).' See [IV, 1, 4, 1](sbe2643.htm#4:1:4:1), with note; [IV, 2,
2, 1](sbe2646.htm#4:2:2:1) seq.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[265:2](sbe2642.htm#fr_638) At I, 6, 2, 3; II,
2, 3, 9, I erroneously supplied a verb of <span id="page_266">p.
266</span> motion with the particle ed, following the original
interpretation in the Petersb. Dict. and Weber's Ind. Stud. IX, 249. I
now adopt the later explanation put forth in the 'Nachträge.' Professor
Whitney, Amer. Journ. of Phil., III, p. 399, apparently draws from the
same source.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[266:1](sbe2642.htm#fr_639) 'As (those) wishing
to take possession of their property, so did they seize upon him each
for himself (eva*m* ta*m* vyag*ri*h*n*ata);' Kâ*n*va text. The
construction of our text is quite irregular.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[266:2](sbe2642.htm#fr_640) The dvidevatya
grahas (libations belonging to two gods) at the morning Soma feast are
the Aindra-vâyava (Indra and Vâyu), the Maitrâ-varu*n*a (Mitra and
Varu*n*a), and the A*s*vina.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[266:3](sbe2642.htm#fr_641) That is, because of
it, or away from it. Perhaps, however, it.. belongs to the next clause,
'therefore, even . . . .'

<span id="fn_640"></span>[267:1](sbe2642.htm#fr_642) That is, in order
to inhale as much of the strong smell of the Soma as possible (?).

<span id="fn_641"></span>[267:2](sbe2642.htm#fr_643) See [p.
158](sbe2625.htm#page_158), note [1](sbe2625.htm#fn_418).

<span id="fn_642"></span>[267:3](sbe2642.htm#fr_644) Or, articulately,
distinctly (niruktam).

<span id="fn_643"></span>[268:1](sbe2642.htm#fr_645) Puroru*k* (lit.
'fore-shining') is the designation of the formulas preceding the
Upayâma, 'Thou art taken with a support, &c.'

<span id="fn_644"></span>[268:2](sbe2642.htm#fr_646) See [p.
256](sbe2640.htm#page_256), note [1](sbe2641.htm#fn_619).
