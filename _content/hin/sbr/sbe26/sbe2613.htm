He bargains for the king (Soma); and because he bargains for the king, therefore any and everything is vendible here. He says, 'Soma-seller, is thy king Soma for sale?'--'He is for sale,' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee!'--'Buy him!' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee for one-sixteenth (of the cow).'--'King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!' says the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more than that; but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,' says the Adhvaryu.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:2">3:3:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. 'From the cow (comes) fresh milk, from her boiled milk, from her cream, from her sour curds, from her sour cream, from her curdled milk, from her butter, from her ghee, from her clotted curds, from her whey:</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:3">3:3:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>I will buy him of thee for one hoof&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!'--'King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!' says the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more than that, but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,' replies the Adhvaryu; and, having (each time) enumerated the same ten virtues, he says, 'I will buy him of thee for one foot,'--'for half (the cow),'--'for the cow!'--'King Soma has been bought!' says the Soma-seller, 'name the kinds!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:4">3:3:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. He (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Gold is thine, a cloth is thine, a goat is thine, a milch cow is thine, a pair of kine is thine, three other (cows) are thine!' And because they first bargain and afterwards come to terms, therefore about any and everything that is for sale here, people first bargain and afterwards</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_70"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 70</FONT></A></p>  
<p>come to terms. And the reason why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma, is that Soma is already glorified, since Soma is a god. And the Adhvaryu thereby glorifies the cow, thinking, 'Seeing her virtues he shall buy her!' This is why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:5">3:3:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. And as to his bargaining five times:--the sacrifice being of equal measure with the year, and there being five seasons in the year, he thus obtains it (the sacrifice, Soma) in five (divisions), and therefore he bargains five times.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:6">3:3:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. He then makes (the sacrificer) say on the gold&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 26), 'Thee, the pure, I buy with the pure,' for he indeed buys the pure with the pure, when (he buys) Soma with gold;--'the brilliant with the brilliant,' for he indeed buys the brilliant with the brilliant, when (he buys) Soma with gold;--'the immortal with the immortal,' for he indeed buys the immortal with the immortal, when (he buys) Soma with gold.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:7">3:3:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. He then tempts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the Soma-seller (with the gold): 'In compensation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> for thy cow,' whereby he means to say, 'With the sacrificer (be) thy cow!'</p>

<p><A NAME="page_71"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 71</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> He then draws it (the gold) back towards the sacrificer, and throws it down, with, 'Ours be thy gold!' whereby he (the sacrificer) takes unto himself the vital energy, and the Soma-seller gets only the body. Thereupon the Soma-seller takes it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:8">3:3:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. He then makes him (the sacrificer) say on the she-goat, which stands facing the west, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--that she-goat was indeed produced as the bodily form of fervour, of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati; hence he says, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--'Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's kind,' because she brings forth three times in the year, therefore she is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's kind. 'Thou art bought with the most excellent animal,' because she brings forth three times in the year, she is the most excellent of animals. 'May I increase with a thousandfold increase!' Thereby he implores a blessing: a thousand meaning abundance, he thereby means to say, 'May I obtain abundance!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:9">3:3:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. With that (text) he gives the she-goat, with that he takes the king&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for a<I>g</I>&acirc; (goat) doubtless</p>

<p>means the same as &acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc; (driving thither&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), since it is through her (the she-goat) that he finally drives him (Soma) thither. It is thus in a mystic sense that they call her 'a<I>g</I>&acirc;.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:10">3:3:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. He takes the king, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 27), 'Come to us, a friend, bestowing good friends!' whereby he means to say, 'Come to us, as a kind and propitious one!' Having pushed back the garment on the sacrificer's right thigh, he lays him (Soma) down thereon, with the text, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh,'--for he, the sacrificer, is at present Indra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Indra's right thigh;'--'willing on the willing,' whereby he means to say, 'beloved on the beloved one;'--'tender on the tender!' whereby he means to say, 'propitious on the propitious one.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:11">3:3:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Thereupon he (the sacrificer) assigns (to the Gandharvas) the objects constituting the purchase price for the Soma, with the text, 'O Sv&acirc;na, Bhr&acirc;<I>g</I>a, A&#7749;gh&acirc;ri, Bambh&acirc;ri, Hasta, Suhasta, K<I>ri</I><I>s</I>&acirc;nu! these are your wages for Soma: keep them! may they not fail you!' Now those (Gandharvas) are instead of the hearth-mounds--these being the names of the hearth-mounds--it is these very (names) that he thereby has assigned to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>

He now uncovers (his head&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>); for he who is consecrated becomes an embryo, and embryos are enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane: him (the sacrificer or sacrifice) he has now brought forth, and therefore he uncovers himself. Now it is he (Soma&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>) that becomes an embryo, and therefore he is enveloped, since embryos are, as it were, enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:13">3:3:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. He then makes (the sacrificer) say the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 28), 'Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways.' Now he (Soma) approaches him while he is seated, and when he has come, he rises: thereby he does wrong and breaks the vow. This, then, is his expiation of that (transgression), and thus no wrong is thereby done, and he breaks not the vow: therefore he says, 'Keep me, O Agni, from evil ways! let me share in the right ways!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:14">3:3:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. Having then taken the king, he rises, with the text, 'With new life, with good life, am I risen after the immortals;' for he who rises after the bought Soma, rises indeed after the immortal: therefore he says,' With new life, with good life, am I risen after the immortals.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:15">3:3:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. Thereupon he takes the king and goes towards the car, with the text (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 29), 'We have</p>

<p><A NAME="page_74"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 74</FONT></A></p>  
<p>entered upon the path that leadeth to wellbeing, free from danger; whereon he escheweth all haters, and meeteth with good&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_197"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:16">3:3:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. Now, once on a time, the gods, while performing sacrifice, were afraid of an attack from the Asura-Rakshas. They perceived that prayer for a safe journey; and having warded off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, they attained wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. And so does he now ward off the evil spirits by means of that prayer, and attain wellbeing in the safe and foeless shelter of that prayer. For this reason he says, 'We have entered upon the path that leadeth to well-being, free from danger; whereon he escheweth all haters and meeteth with good.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:17">3:3:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. They carry him thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and (afterwards) drive him about on the cart; whereby they exalt him: for this reason they carry the seed on their head (to the field), and bring in (the corn) on the cart.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:3:18">3:3:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. Now the reason why he buys (the Soma) near water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_198"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is that--water meaning sap--he thereby buys Soma sapful; and as to there being gold, he thereby buys him lustrous; and as to there being a cloth, he thereby buys him with his skin; and as to there being a she-goat, he thereby buys him fervid; and as to there being a milch cow, he thereby buys him with the milk to be mixed with him; and as to there being a pair (of kine), he thereby buys him with a mate.--He should buy him with ten (objects), and</p>

<p><A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A></p>  
<p>not with other than ten, for the vir&acirc;<I>g</I> consists of ten syllables, and Soma is of vir&acirc;<I>g</I> nature: therefore he should buy him with ten (objects) and not with other than ten.</p>

K&acirc;ty. VII, 8, 27. According to &Acirc;pastamba (ib.), he buys off the Soma-cow with another cow, and then dismisses her to the cow-pen; and if the Soma-seller objects, he is to be beaten with a speckled cane. The M&acirc;nava-s&ucirc;tra merely says, that they are to give the Soma-seller something for compensation. The whole transaction was evidently a feigned purchase, symbolising the acquisition of the Soma by the gods from the Gandharvas. The real bargain was probably concluded before the sacrificial performance. See also Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 59, note 2.</P>
