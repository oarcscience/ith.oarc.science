<p><A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were produced from V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the <I>S</I>akvar&icirc;, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:2">3:3:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. It is as V&acirc;<I>k</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_158"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that he steps into them; (with the text, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 21), 'Thou art a Vasv&icirc;, thou art Aditi, thou art an &Acirc;dity&acirc;, thou art a Rudr&acirc;, thou art <I>K</I>andr&acirc;; for she is indeed a Vasv&icirc; and Aditi, an &Acirc;dity&acirc;, a Rudr&acirc;, <I>K</I>andr&acirc;. 'May B<I>ri</I>haspati make thee rest in happiness!'--B<I>ri</I>haspati being the Brahman, he thereby means to say, 'May B<I>ri</I>haspati lead thee hither by means of the good (work)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!' 'Rudra, together with the Vasus, is well-pleased with thee:' this he says to secure her (the cow's) safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:3">3:3:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. They now sit down&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> round the seventh footprint; and having laid down the piece of gold in the foot-print, he offers. For offering is made on nothing but fire, and the gold has sprung from Agni's seed: and thus that offering of his is indeed made over</p>

<p>the fire. And the clarified butter being a thunderbolt, he now delivers her (the cow) by means of that thunderbolt, the butter; and by delivering her he makes her his own.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:4">3:3:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. He (the Adhvaryu) offers (with the text, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 22), 'On Aditi's head I pour thee;' for Aditi being this earth, it is on the head of the latter that he offers;--'on the worshipping-ground of the earth'--for on the worshipping-ground of the earth he indeed offers;--'Thou art I<I>d</I>&acirc;'s footprint, filled with butter, Hail!' for I<I>d</I>&acirc; being the cow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he indeed offers on the cow's foot-print; and 'filled with butter, Hail!' he says, because it indeed becomes filled with butter when offered upon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:5">3:3:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. Thereupon he takes the wooden sword and draws lines round (the foot-print): the wooden sword being a thunderbolt, it is with the thunderbolt that he draws round it. Thrice he draws round it, so that he encompasses it on all sides with a threefold thunderbolt, for no one to trespass upon it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:6">3:3:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. He draws the lines (with the texts), 'Rejoice in us!' whereby he means to say, 'Rejoice in the sacrificer!' Having then, by tracing, cut out the foot-print all round&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_163"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he throws it into the pan, with, 'In us is thy kinship,' whereby he means to say, 'In the sacrificer is thy kinship.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:7">3:3:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. He then pours some water on (the place whence the earth has been removed). Wherever in digging they hurt her (the earth) and knock off anything</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_61"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 61</FONT></A></p>  
<p>from her,--water being (a means of) soothing,--that he now soothes by means of water, that he heals by means of water: that is why he pours water thereon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:8">3:3:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. He then hands (the dust of) the foot-print to the sacrificer, with, 'In thee is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'in thee is cattle.' The sacrificer receives it with, 'With me&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_163"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is wealth,'--wealth meaning cattle, he thereby means to say, 'with me is cattle.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:9">3:3:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. The Adhvaryu then touches himself (near the heart), with, 'May we not be deprived of prosperity!' Thus the Adhvaryu does not exclude himself from (the possession of) cattle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:10">3:3:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. Thereupon they hand (the dust of) the footprint over to the (sacrificer's) wife. The house being the wife's resting-place, he thereby establishes her in that safe resting-place, the house: for this reason he hands over the (earth of the) foot-print to the wife.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:11">3:3:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. The Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I> makes her say, 'Thine, thine&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is wealth;' whereupon he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow. Now, Soma is a male, and the wife is a female, and that Soma-cow becomes here (exchanged for) Soma: a productive union is thus effected;--this is why he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:12">3:3:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. He causes her to be looked at (while she pronounces the text, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. IV, 23), 'I have seen eye to eye with the divine intelligence, with the far-seeing Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;: take</p>

<p>not my life from me, neither will I take thine; may I obtain a hero&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in thy sight!' She thereby asks a blessing: a hero meaning a son, she thereby means to say, 'May I obtain a son in thy sight!'</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:14">3:3:1:14</A></FONT></span>14.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3:3:1:15">3:3:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. Let, then, the brown one, with red-brown eyes, be the Soma-cow. And if he be unable to obtain a brown one with red-brown eyes, let it be a dark-red&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> one.

For that Soma-cow is in reality V&acirc;<I>k</I>, and this V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech) is of unimpaired vigour; and of unimpaired vigour is one not (yet) impregnated: let it therefore be one not impregnated.
