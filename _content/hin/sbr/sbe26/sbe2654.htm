<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:1">4:3:5:1</A></FONT></span>1. Now there are three kinds of gods,--the Vasus, the Rudras, and the &Acirc;dityas. Between them the press-feasts are divided: the morning pressing belongs to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, and the third pressing to the &Acirc;dityas. But the morning pressing belonged to the Vasus exclusively, and the midday pressing to the Rudras exclusively, and the third pressing to the &Acirc;dityas conjointly (with others).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:2">4:3:5:2</A></FONT></span>2. The &Acirc;dityas then said, 'As that morning pressing belongs exclusively to the Vasus, and that midday pressing exclusively to the Rudras, so offer ye now to us a libation before the common (pressing).' The gods said, 'So be it!' After the completion of the midday pressing, they offered that (libation) previous to the third pressing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_820"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And in like manner is that libation offered to this day after the completion of the midday pressing and previous to the third pressing.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:3">4:3:5:3</A></FONT></span>3. The &Acirc;dityas said, 'Neither in the one pressing have we a share nor in the other: we fear lest the Rakshas might injure us!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:4">4:3:5:4</A></FONT></span>4. They said to the (cups) belonging to two deities (dvidevatya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_821"></A><A HREF="#fn_818"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), 'We are afraid of the Rakshas: pray, let us enter into you!'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:5">4:3:5:5</A></FONT></span>5. The Dvidevatyas said, 'What will be our reward then?'--'By us ye shall be supplied with the Anuvasha<I>t</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="#fn_819"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!', said the &Acirc;dityas.--'So be it!'--They entered into the dvidevatya cups.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:6">4:3:5:6</A></FONT></span>6. Hence, when at the morning pressing he (the Adhvaryu) proceeds with the dvidevatya cups, the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> draws Soma juice from the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a into the &Acirc;ditya vessel, with this much (of the formula, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, I), 'Thou art taken with a support!' The Adhvaryu calls for the (Agn&icirc;dh's) <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>, and after the Adhvaryu's libation the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> pours (his juice into the fire), and with this much 'Thee to the &Acirc;dityas!' he pours the remains (into the &Acirc;ditya-sth&acirc;l&icirc;). In the same way at all (three dvidevatya libations).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:7">4:3:5:7</A></FONT></span>7. Thus, the reason why the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> draws the Soma-juice, is that they entered into the dvidevatya cups. And the &Acirc;dityas then said, 'By us ye shall be supplied with the Anuvasha<I>t</I>!' For, that second libation which he (the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) makes, he makes to (Agni) Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, and by means of the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t these (dvidevatyas) are supplied with the Anuvasha<I>t</I>; and thus those (libations) of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A></p>  
<p>his are supplied with the Anuvasha<I>t</I>, having the (oblation to Agni) Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t performed for them. He offers on the north part (of the fire), for that is the region of that god&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="#fn_820"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: hence he offers on the north part.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:8">4:3:5:8</A></FONT></span>8. And again, why the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> draws the Soma. They entered into the Dvidevatyas; and from those which they entered he thereby draws them out. He then covers it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_824"></A><A HREF="#fn_821"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>--for they were afraid of the Rakshas--with 'O Vish<I>n</I>u, Far-strider, here is thy Soma, protect it lest they should injure it!' For Vish<I>n</I>u is the sacrifice: to the sacrifice he thus makes it over for protection. Now, after the completion of the midday Soma feast and before the evening feast he says, 'Come hither, Sacrificer!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:9">4:3:5:9</A></FONT></span>9. They enter (the Havirdh&acirc;na) together,--the Adhvaryu, Sacrificer, &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra, Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>, Unnet<I>ri</I>, and whatever other attendant (of the Adhvaryu) there is&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_825"></A><A HREF="#fn_822"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. They close both doors,--for they (the &Acirc;dityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He (the Adhvaryu) takes up the &Acirc;ditya-sth&acirc;l&icirc; and &Acirc;ditya-p&acirc;tra, and holds them close over the P&ucirc;tabh<I>ri</I>t, 'lest (any Soma juice) should be spilt.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:10">4:3:5:10</A></FONT></span>10. He then draws (the juice from the sth&acirc;l&icirc; into the p&acirc;tra) with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 2; Rig-veda VIII, 51, 7), 'At no time art thou barren, and never failest thou the worshipper, O Indra; but</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>

<p><A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A></p>  
<p>more and ever more is thy divine gift increased, O mighty lord!--Thee to the &Acirc;dityas!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:11">4:3:5:11</A></FONT></span>11. Let him not draw it with a 'support'--for it was originally drawn with a support--to avoid a repetition (of sacrificial performance); but were he now also to draw it with a support, he would certainly commit a repetition.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:12">4:3:5:12</A></FONT></span>12. Having withdrawn (the cup for a moment from the flowing juice), he again pours it in with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 3; Rig-veda VIII, 52, 7), 'At no time art thou heedless, but watchest over both generations; the Soma feast&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_826"></A><A HREF="#fn_823"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is thy strength, O fourth &Acirc;ditya: the ambrosia is ready for thee in the heavens!--Thee to the &Acirc;dityas!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:13">4:3:5:13</A></FONT></span>13. Thereupon he takes sour milk; for the evening pressing belongs to the &Acirc;dityas, and cattle are after (the manner of) the &Acirc;dityas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_827"></A><A HREF="#fn_824"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: he thereby puts milk into the cattle, and thus that milk in cattle is beneficial&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_828"></A><A HREF="#fn_825"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. 'He should put it right in the centre (of the &Acirc;ditya cup),' they say, 'for that milk is right in the centre of cattle.' But let him rather put it in the back part (of the cup), for that milk is in the hind part of cattle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:14">4:3:5:14</A></FONT></span>14. And the reason why he takes sour milk is that those remains (of Soma) poured together are the leavings of offerings, and insufficient for an oblation: he now increases those (remains), and thus they</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A></p>  
<p>become sufficient for an oblation. This is why he takes sour milk.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:15">4:3:5:15</A></FONT></span>15. He takes it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 4; Rig-veda I, 107, I), 'The sacrifice draweth nigh to the glory of the gods: be ye merciful, O &Acirc;dityas! Let your favour incline unto us, that it may set us free from all trouble!--Thee to the &Acirc;dityas!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:16">4:3:5:16</A></FONT></span>16. He mixes it by means of the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>usavana stone&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_829"></A><A HREF="#fn_826"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. For, indeed, that &Acirc;ditya Vivasvat (the sun) is really the same as the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>usavana, and this is the &Acirc;ditya libation: thus he makes him delight in his own share.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:17">4:3:5:17</A></FONT></span>17. He touches it neither with the fringe nor with (the woven part of) the straining-cloth; for those two pressings, the morning pressing and midday pressing, forsooth are rich in pure Soma, rich in juice, but this, the third pressing, is emptied of its pure Soma. Now, in that he does not touch it either with the fringe or the straining-cloth, thereby that third pressing of his also becomes rich in pure Soma and juice: therefore he touches it neither with the fringe nor with the straining-cloth.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:18">4:3:5:18</A></FONT></span>18. He mixes it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VIII, 5), 'O &Acirc;ditya Vivasvat, this is thy draught of Soma: feast thou upon it!' Thereupon he hands the Up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>usavana to the Unnet<I>ri</I>. Then he says to the Unnet<I>ri</I>, 'Drop in the pressing-stones!' He drops them either into the &Acirc;dhavan&icirc;ya or into a cup&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_830"></A><A HREF="#fn_827"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:19">4:3:5:19</A></FONT></span>19. After drawing the king (Soma)--the third press-feast belonging to the &Acirc;dityas, and the pressing-stones being after (the manner of&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_831"></A><A HREF="#fn_828"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) the &Acirc;dityas, he thus makes them delight in their own share--they open the doors.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:20">4:3:5:20</A></FONT></span>20. He now walks out, covering (the cup with his hand or the sth&acirc;l&icirc;); for they (the &Acirc;dityas) were afraid of the Rakshas. He then says (to the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a), 'Recite (the invitatory prayer) to the &Acirc;dityas!' If he likes, he may now enumerate (their qualities); but let him rather enumerate them, after he has called for the <I>S</I>rausha<I>t</I>,--'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the offering prayer) to the &Acirc;dityas, the beloved, rite-loving, law-loving lords of the great abode, the rulers of the wide air.' He offers, as the Vasha<I>t</I> is pronounced. He (the Hot<I>ri</I>) pronounces no Anuvasha<I>t</I>, lest he should consign the cattle to the fire. The remains (of juice in the sth&acirc;l&icirc; and graha) he (the Adhvaryu) hands to the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:21">4:3:5:21</A></FONT></span>21. Thereupon he again enters (the Havirdh&acirc;na) and draws the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a graha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_832"></A><A HREF="#fn_829"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. They spread (over the P&ucirc;tabh<I>ri</I>t) a straining-cloth with the fringe towards the north. The Adhvaryu pours out (the</p>

<p><A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A></p>  
<p>juice) of the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a; the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> holds out (and pours in) the two residues (of the &Acirc;ditya graha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_833"></A><A HREF="#fn_830"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>); the Unnet<I>ri</I> adds thereto (some juice from the &Acirc;dhavan&icirc;ya) by means of a <I>k</I>amasa cup or a dipping-vessel (uda<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ana).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:22">4:3:5:22</A></FONT></span>22. Thus he draws the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a graha from four streams; for the evening pressing belongs to the .&Acirc;dityas, and cows are after the manner of the &Acirc;dityas; whence this milk of cows is of a fourfold nature: therefore he draws the &Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a from four streams&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_834"></A><A HREF="#fn_831"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:23">4:3:5:23</A></FONT></span>23. And as to why the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> holds out the two residues: this is (the remains of) the &Acirc;ditya libation, and for the &Acirc;ditya libation he pronounces no Anuvasha<I>t</I>; and from that (&Acirc;graya<I>n</I>a graha) he intends to draw the S&acirc;vitra graha,--so that the Anuvasha<I>t</I> is performed for it by means of the S&acirc;vitra graha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:5:24">4:3:5:24</A></FONT></span>24. And again why the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> holds out the two residues. Previous to that mixed (press-feast), previous to the evening feast, they have offered that (unmixed or special) libation to those (&Acirc;dityas); but this libation is taken for the evening feast: thereby the &Acirc;dityas take part in the evening feast, and thus they are not excluded from the sacrifice. This is why the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> holds out the two residues&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_835"></A><A HREF="#fn_832"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

Thereupon they leave the Havirdh&acirc;na shed in the same way as at the morning feast <A NAME="page_357"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 357</FONT></A> (see <a href="sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:1">IV, 2, 5, 1</A>, with notes), and perform the Viprud-homas, followed by the Sarpa<I>n</I>a and chanting of the &Acirc;rbhava, or T<I>ri</I>t&icirc;ya Pavam&acirc;na stotra (for an account of which, see <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#page_315">p. 315</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#fn_759">2</A>). Then follow the oblations from the victim (which has been cooking since the morning, see <a href="sbe2649.htm#4:2:5:13">IV, 2, 5, 13</A>), &amp;c., up to the eating of the pa<I>s</I>vi<I>d</I>&acirc; (see <a href="sbe2633.htm#3:8:3:4">III, 8, 3, 4</A> seq.); and offering of the four Savan&icirc;ya-puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>as, likewise up to the eating of the i<I>d</I>&acirc;. Previous to the eating, small pieces of rice-cake are thrown into the <I>k</I>amasa cups, as an oblation to the sacrificer's deceased ancestors, with naming of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather (as at the Pi<I>n</I><I>d</I>apit<I>ri</I>ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, II, 4, 2, 19 seq.); whereupon the pieces are eaten along with the i<I>d</I>&acirc;.</P>
