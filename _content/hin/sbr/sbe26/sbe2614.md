#### PROCESSION AND ENTRANCE OF KING SOMA.

### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:1">3:3:4:1</span></span>1. In the
enclosed space (of the cart) <span id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_199) he
(the Adhvaryu) lays down the black deer-skin, with the text (Vâ*g*. S.
IV, 30), 'Thou art Aditi's skin;' its significance is the same (as
before) <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_200). Thereon he places him
(Soma), with, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!' for Aditi being this (earth),
and she being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that
safe resting-place: therefore he says, 'Seat thee on Aditi's seat!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:2">3:3:4:2</span></span>2. He
then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching (the Soma), 'The bull
hath propped the sky, the welkin <span id="fr_202"></span>[3](#fn_201).'
For, when the gods were spreading the sacrifice, they were afraid of an
attack on the part of the Asura-Rakshas. Now by what he says, 'The bull
hath propped the sky, the welkin,'

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

thereby they rendered it (the sacrifice or Soma) superior to the deadly
shaft <span id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_202).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:3">3:3:4:3</span></span>3. 'He
hath measured the breadth of the earth;'--thus he gains through him
(Soma) these worlds, for there is no slayer, no deadly shaft for him by
whom these worlds have been gained: therefore he says, 'He hath measured
the breadth of the earth.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:4">3:3:4:4</span></span>4. 'As
all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing
(bhuvana);'--thus he gains through him this All, for there is no slayer,
no deadly shaft for him by whom this All has been gained: therefore he
says, 'As all-ruler hath he taken his seat over all things existing.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:5">3:3:4:5</span></span>5.
'Verily, all these are Varu*n*a's ordinances;'--thereby he makes here
everything whatsoever obedient to him, and every one that is refractory:
therefore he says, 'Verily, all these are Varu*n*a's ordinances.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:6">3:3:4:6</span></span>6.
Thereupon he wraps (the Soma) up in the Soma-wrapper, lest the evil
spirits should touch him. For this one doubtless is an embryo, and
hidden (tiras), as it were, are embryos, and hidden also is that (which
is) wrapped up;--hidden, as it were, are the gods to men, and hidden is
that which is wrapped up: therefore he wraps him up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:7">3:3:4:7</span></span>7. He
wraps him up, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 31; Rig-veda V, 85, 2), 'Over
the woods he hath stretched the welkin,' for over the woods, over the
tops of the trees, that welkin (or air) is indeed stretched;--'strength
(hath he laid) into the coursers, milk into the kine,'--strength means

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

manliness and the coursers are the men: he thereby bestows manliness
upon men; and 'milk into the kine' he says, because this milk is indeed
contained in the kine;--'Into the hearts Varu*n*a (hath laid) wisdom,
into the homesteads <span id="fr_204"></span>[1](#fn_203) fire;' for
into the hearts that wisdom, the swiftness of thought, has indeed
entered; and 'into the homesteads fire' he says, because that fire is in
the homesteads, with the people;--'Into the heaven hath he placed the
Sun, and Soma upon the rock;' for that sun is indeed placed in the
heaven; and 'Soma on the rock' he says, because Soma is in the
mountains. This is why he says, 'In the heaven hath he placed the Sun,
and Soma upon the rock.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:8">3:3:4:8</span></span>8. If
there are two deer-skins <span id="fr_205"></span>[2](#fn_204), he then
puts up the other by way of a flag <span
id="fr_206"></span>[3](#fn_205);--and if there is only one, he cuts off
the neck of the deer-skin and puts it up by way of a flag;--with the
text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 32), 'Mount thou the eye of Sûrya, the eye-ball of
Agni, where thou fliest along with the dappled (horses), shining through
the wise (Sûrya).' He thereby places Sûrya (the sun) in front, thinking,
'May Sûrya, in front, ward off the evil spirits!' They now drive (Soma)
about on a safe (cart), unmolested by evil spirits.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:9">3:3:4:9</span></span>9. At the
fore-part of the shafts two boards have been put up: between them the
Subrâhma*n*yâ <span id="fr_207"></span>[4](#fn_206)

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

stands and drives. He (Soma), indeed, is too high for (the driver)
mounting beside him, for who is worthy of mounting beside him? Therefore
he drives while standing between (the boards).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:10">3:3:4:10</span></span>10. He
drives with a palâ*s*a branch. Now when Gâyatrî flew towards Soma <span
id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_207), a footless archer aiming at her while
she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (or leaves,
par*n*a), either of Gâyatrî or of king Soma; and on falling down it
became a par*n*a (palâ*s*a) tree; whence its name par*n*a. 'May that
which was there of the Soma nature, be here also now!' so he thinks, and
for this reason he drives with a palâ*s*a branch.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:11">3:3:4:11</span></span>11. He
urges on the two oxen. If they be both black, or if either of them be
black, then let him know that it will rain, that Par*g*anya will have
abundance of rain that year: such indeed is science.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:12">3:3:4:12</span></span>12. He
(the Adhvaryu) first yokes them, with the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 33), 'Ye
oxen, come hither, patient of the yoke!' for they are indeed oxen, and
they are patient of the yoke;--'Let yourselves be yoked, tearless!' for
they are now being yoked; and tearless means unscathed;--'not
man-slaying,' this means 'not doing wrong;'--'speeding the Brahman,' for
they are indeed speeders of the Brahman (worship, or the priests);--'Go
ye happily to the sacrificer's dwelling!' this he says in order that the
evil spirits may not injure them on the way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:13">3:3:4:13</span></span>13.
Having then gone round to the back (of the

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

cart) and taken hold of the drag <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_208),
he says (to the Hot*ri*) <span id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_209), 'Recite
to the bought Soma!' or,'--to Soma, now driven about!' whichever way he
pleases.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:14">3:3:4:14</span></span>14. He
then makes (the sacrificer <span id="fr_211"></span>[3](#fn_210)) say
the text (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 34), 'Thou art gracious unto me, go forth, O
Lord of the world--,' for he (Soma) is indeed gracious to him, wherefore
he heeds no other but him. Even his (Soma's own) kings <span
id="fr_212"></span>[4](#fn_211) come (to

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

him) to attend the assembly, and he is the first to salute the kings,
for he is gracious. This is why he says, 'Thou art gracious.' 'Go forth,
O Lord of the world,' he says, because he (Soma) is the lord of beings.
'To all dwellings,' 'all dwellings' doubtless means the limbs; with
reference to his limbs he says this, 'May no prowling enemies meet thee!
may no waylayers meet thee! May no malicious wolves meet thee!' this he
says lest the evil spirits should meet him on his way.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:15">3:3:4:15</span></span>15.
'Having become a falcon, fly away!' he thereby makes him fly forward
after becoming a falcon; for the evil spirits fly not after what is
fearful: now he, the falcon, forsooth is the most fearful, the strongest
of birds, and as such a one he makes him (Soma) fly forwards when he
says, 'Having become a falcon, fly away!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:16">3:3:4:16</span></span>16. Now
they (can) only hit his body <span id="fr_213"></span>[1](#fn_212). 'Go
to the sacrificer's dwelling,--that is the place prepared for us.' In
this there is nothing obscure.

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:17">3:3:4:17</span></span>17.
Thereupon he recites the Subrahma*n*yâ litany. Even as one would say to
those for whom he intends to prepare a meal, 'On such and such a day I
will prepare a meal for you;' so does he thereby announce the sacrifice
to the gods. 'Subrahma*n*yôm! Subrahma*n*yôm! Subrahma*n*yôm!' thus he
calls, for the Brahman indeed moves the gods onward. Thrice he says it,
because the sacrifice is threefold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:18">3:3:4:18</span></span>18.
'Come, O Indra!' Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: therefore he says,
'Come, O Indra!' 'Come, O lord of the bay steeds! Ram of
Medhâtithi <span id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_213)! Wife of
V*ri*sha*n*a*s*va <span id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_214)! Bestriding
buffalo! Lover of Ahalyâ <span id="fr_216"></span>[3](#fn_215)!' Thereby
he wishes him joy in those affairs of his.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:19">3:3:4:19</span></span>19. 'O
Kau*s*ika <span id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_216), Brahman, thou who
callest thee Gautama <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_217).' Just so has
this (formula) been devised in these days by Âru*n*i, to wit, 'thou who
callest thee Gautama:' he may say it, if he choose, and if he does not
choose, he need not attend to it <span id="fr_219"></span>[3](#fn_218).
'In so and so many days, to the Soma-feast,' (stating) in how many days
from hence the pressing is to be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:20">3:3:4:20</span></span>20. 'Ye
gods and priests, come hither <span id="fr_220"></span>[4](#fn_219)!'
This he says to the gods and Brâhmans, because it is of these two, the
gods and Brâhmans, that he has need.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:21">3:3:4:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon the Pratiprasthât*ri* steps up to the front of the hall with
the victim for Agni and Soma. Now Agni and Soma have seized him, who
consecrates himself, between their jaws, for that consecration-offering
above <span id="fr_221"></span>[5](#fn_220) belongs to Agni and
Vish*n*u, and Vish*n*u, forsooth, is no other than

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soma, and the
offering is he himself who is consecrated: thus they have seized him
between their jaws; and by this victim he now redeems himself <span
id="fr_222"></span>[1](#fn_221).

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:22">3:3:4:22</span></span>22.
Now, some take a firebrand from the Âhavanîya, saying, 'Here is Agni,
and here is Soma: with these two thus being together we will redeem
ourselves.' But let him not do this; for wheresoever these two are,
there they are indeed together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:23">3:3:4:23</span></span>23. It
(the victim) is two-coloured, because it belongs to two deities: 'For
the sake of concord between the two deities let it be a black-spotted
(buck)!' they say; 'for that is most like those two (gods).' If he be
unable to obtain a black-spotted buck, it may be a red-spotted one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:24">3:3:4:24</span></span>24.
Thereon he makes (the sacrificer) say (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 35; Rig-veda X; 37,
1); 'Homage be to the eye of Mitra and Varu*n*a! perform ye diligently
this holy service to the god! sing ye unto the far-seeing, god-born
light, to Sûrya, the son of the sky!' Thereby he renders homage to it
(the victim) and makes it a token of the covenant.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:25">3:3:4:25</span></span>25. The
Adhvaryu then removes the Soma-wrapper. With (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 36) 'Thou
art Varu*n*a's stay,' he props (the cart) with the prop. With 'Ye two
are the rest of Varu*n*a's stay,' he pulls out the two wedges. The
reason why he says, 'Ye two are the rest of Varu*n*a's stay <span
id="fr_223"></span>[2](#fn_222),' is that he, the bought Soma, now
indeed is of Varu*n*a <span id="fr_224"></span>[3](#fn_223).

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:26">3:3:4:26</span></span>26.
Thereupon four men take up the king's throne; two men, it is true, take
it up for the human king, but four take up this for him who rules over
everything here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:27">3:3:4:27</span></span>27. It
is of udumbara wood--udumbara meaning sap and food--for (the
sacrificer's) obtainment of sap and food: therefore it is of udumbara
wood.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:28">3:3:4:28</span></span>28. It
reaches up to his navel, for it is there that the food settles, and Soma
is food: therefore it reaches up to his navel. Moreover, there is the
seat of the seed, and Soma is seed: therefore it reaches up to his
navel.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:29">3:3:4:29</span></span>29. He
(the Adhvaryu) touches it with, 'Thou art the rightful seat
(*ri*tasadanî) of Varu*n*a!' He then spreads on it the black deerskin
with, 'Thou art the rightful seat (*ri*tasadanam) of Varu*n*a!' and
places him (Soma) thereon with, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of
Varu*n*a!' The reason why he says, 'Seat thee on the rightful seat of
Varu*n*a,' is that he (Soma) is now of Varu*n*a's nature.

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:30">3:3:4:30</span></span>30.
Thereupon he makes him (king Soma) enter the hall; and in making him
enter, he causes (the sacrificer) to say (Vâ*g*. S. IV, 37; Rig-veda I,
91, 19), 'Whatsoever powers of thine they worship with offering, may
they all encompass the sacrifice <span id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_224)!
Go forth to our dwellings, O Soma, prospering our homes, ever helpful,
bestowing abundance of men, not slaying our

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

men!' dwellings meaning houses, he thereby means to say, 'Go forth to
our houses, kind, propitious, not doing evil.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="3:3:4:31">3:3:4:31</span></span>31.
Some now pour out a vessel of water beside him, saying that this would
be as. one would bring water for a king that has come to him. But let
him not do this, for they (who do this) do at the sacrifice what is
human, and inauspicious for the sacrifice forsooth is that which is
human: let him therefore not pour out water, lest he should do at the
sacrifice what is inauspicious.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_199"></span>[75:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_200) The cart stands
south of the place where the purchase of Soma took place, with the
shafts towards the east, fitted with all the appliances, and yoked with
a pair of oxen. The antelope skin is spread with the hairy side upwards,
and the neck part towards the east.

<span id="fn_200"></span>[75:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_201) See I, 1, 4, 1 seq.
The Kâ*n*va text has: 'the significance of this ya*g*us is the same.'

<span id="fn_201"></span>[75:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_202) In Rig-veda VIII,
42, 1, this verse relates to Varu*n*a. In adapting it to the present
sacrificial requirements, 'v*ri*shabho (*ri*shabho, K.) antariksham' has
been substituted for the original 'asuro vi*s*vavedâ*h*;' Soma being
meant by 'the bull.'

<span id="fn_202"></span>[76:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_203) Or, superior to
(beyond the reach of) the slayer (or the blow), '*g*yâyâ*m*sa*m*
vadhât.'

<span id="fn_203"></span>[77:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_204) 'Into the waters
(apsu),' Rig-veda.

<span id="fn_204"></span>[77:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_205) See [III, 2, 1,
1](sbe2607.htm#3:2:1:1) seq.

<span id="fn_205"></span>[77:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_206) He is to fasten it
to a staff fixed to the pole of the cart near the yoke. Kâty. VII, 9, 9.

<span id="fn_206"></span>[77:4](sbe2614.htm#fr_207) The Subrâhma*n*yâ is
one of the assistants of the Udgât*ri* (chanter of Sâma-hymns). He
stands on the ground between the two shafts in front of the yoke; the
two planks, according to Sâya*n*a, reaching up to his chin.

<span id="fn_207"></span>[78:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_208) See I, 7, 1, I; part
i, p. 183. According to Ait. Br. III, 26, K*ri*sânu the Soma-keeper's
arrow cut off one of the talons of Gâyatrî's left foot, which was turned
into a porcupine.

<span id="fn_208"></span>[79:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_209) Apâlamba, a piece of
wood fastened to the back part of the cart to prevent its running
backwards when going up-hill; or, according to others, a rope used for
retarding the progress of the cart in going down-hill. Kâty. VII, 9, 15
comm. The cart stands with the oxen towards the east; it is then wheeled
round towards the right to the west and driven to the hall, in front of
which it is turned towards the north; the Soma being then taken down.
See Ait. Br. I, 14.

<span id="fn_209"></span>[79:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_210) The duties of the
Hot*ri*, while the Soma-cart is driven to the hall, are set forth Â*s*v.
*S*rautas. IV, 4: He stands three feet behind the cart between the two
wheel tracks, and throws thrice dust towards the south with the
fore-part of his foot without moving the heel, with the formula, 'Thou
art wise, thou art intelligent, thou upholding all things: drive away
the danger arising from men!' Thereupon, after uttering the sound 'Him,'
he recites eight verses, or, the first and last being recited thrice
each, in all twelve verses. Cf. Ait. Br. I, 13. He first remains
standing in the same place and recites thrice the first verse. Then in
following the cart he recites the five following verses. The cart having
now stopped, he walks round it on its right (south) side, and while
looking on the Soma follows it while it is placed on the throne. He then
touches it and completes his recitation by the last two verses. The
first of these two verses is the same which the sacrificer is to mutter
(with the Adhvaryu) while Soma is carried into the hall, and which is
given in [paragraph 30](sbe2614.htm#3:3:4:30).

<span id="fn_210"></span>[79:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_211) While the Soma is
driven to the hall, the sacrificer has to hold on to it from behind.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[79:4](sbe2614.htm#fr_212) 'Asya râ*g*âna*h*
sabhâgâ*h*;'--Soma seems to be compared here with an emperor or overlord
of kings (adhirâ*g*o râ*gñ*âm, V, 4,2,2), who is holding a royal court
(ra*g*asabhâ), or a Darbar, to which the under-kings are flocking.
Sâya*n*a seems to interpret the passage differently: apy asya
râ*g*âna*h* iti sabhâgâ ity anena râ*gñ*âm anatikrama*n*îyam <span
id="page_80">p. 80</span> uktam bhavati; api sambhâvanâyâm madhuparkam
âha 'râ*gñ*e *k*â*k*ârya*s*va*s*urapit*ri*vyamâtulâna*m* *k*eti' (Â*s*v.
G*ri*hyas. I, 24) sambhâvanîyânâm madhye râ*gñ*âm prathamato nirdi*s*ena
(!) *s*resh*th*yâvagamâd itarapû*g*yopalakshakatvenâpy asya râ*g*âna iti
nirde*s*a iti mantavyam, râ*gñ*a âgatân svayam prahva eva san pûrvas
tebhya*h* prâg evâbhivadati vâgvyavahâra*m* karoti. The Kâ*n*va text
reads: For he is his gracious lord, therefore he heeds not even a king;
and yet (?) he is the first to salute the kings: thus he is indeed
gracious to him: 'esha vâ etasya bhadro bhavati, tasmâd esha na
râ*g*âna*m* *k*anâdriyate ’tho pûrvo râ*gñ*o ’bhivadati tathâsyaisha eva
bhadro bhavati(!).'

<span id="fn_212"></span>[80:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_213) Or, they can only
shoot after his body, '*s*arîram evânvavahanti.' The Kâ*n*va text has
athâsyeda*m* *s*arîram evânasâ ’nvâvahanti,' i.e. 'Now they only bring
his body with the cart.' The MS. of Sâya*n*a also has 'anvâvahanti,' but
it explains it by '*s*yenîbhâvâd upâdeyasya sârâ*ms*asya bâdhâbhâvâd
dhantâ *s*arîram evânugatya hanti nâtmânam.'

<span id="fn_213"></span>[81:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_214) This myth, according
to which Indra was supposed to have assumed the form of a ram and to
have carried off Medhâtithi, the Kâ*n*va (or, according to others, to
have robbed him of his Soma), appears to be alluded to in Rig-veda VIII,
2, 40. On the possible connection of the myth with the Greek one of
Ganymede, see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 40. Sâya*n*a does not explain the
Subrahma*n*yâ formula, but remarks, that he has already done so in the
Sâma-brâhma*n*a (viz. in the Sha*d*vi*ms*a).

<span id="fn_214"></span>[81:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_215) According to
Rig-veda I, 51, 13, Indra became the wife (menâ) of V*ri*sha*n*a*s*va
(Mena); the reason for this transformation being, according to the
Sha*d*vi*ms*a Br., that he was in love with Menâ or Menakâ, the daughter
of that king (or sage). Ind. Stud. I, p. 38. The later explanation of
the simple statement of the *Ri*k seems of doubtful authenticity, unless
the choice of the word menâ for 'wife' was intended by the bard as an
allusion to the name of the king's daughter. It is more likely that the
myth alluded to in the *Ri*k had been forgotten at the time of the
Brâhma*n*as, and a new version of it was invented, based on the 'menâ'
of the original. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 383, takes Menâ here as a
name.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[81:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_216) This is another of
Indra's love-myths about which very little is known. Ahalyâ (Maitreyî)
is said to have been the wife of the *Ri*shi Gautama (or of Kau*s*ika,
according to Sha*d*v. Br.) and to have been loved by Indra.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[82:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_217) According to
Sâya*n*a on Rig-veda I, 10, 11 (where Indra is called Kau*s*ika,
'favourable to the Ku*s*ikas') Ku*s*ika desired to have a son equal to
Indra, whence the latter was born as Ku*s*ika's son Gâthin (Gâdhin).
Differently Sây. on Taitt. Âr. I, 12, 4.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[82:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_218) The Sha*d*v. Br.
(Ind. Stud. I, p. 38) explains this as follows:--The Gods and Asuras
were at war with each other. Gotama was performing austerities between
them. Indra went up to him and said, 'Go out as our spy.' 'I cannot,' he
replied. 'Then I will go in your form.' 'As thou thinkest fit!' And
because he (Indra) went about in the form of Gotama, passing himself off
as Gotama, therefore he says, 'thou who callest thee Gotama.'

<span id="fn_218"></span>[82:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_219) The Kâ*n*va text
also states that this last portion of the formula was devised by
Âru*n*i, but nothing is said as to its use being optional.

<span id="fn_219"></span>[82:4](sbe2614.htm#fr_220) For variations of
this concluding part of the Subrahma*n*yâ in different schools, see
Lâ*t*y. *S*r. I, 3, 3 seq.; also notes to [III, 9, 3,
10](sbe2638.htm#3:9:3:10); IV, 9, 6, 25 (?); Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p.
383.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[82:5](sbe2614.htm#fr_221) See [III, 1, 3,
1](sbe2605.htm#3:1:3:1) seq.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[83:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_222) 'By this victim he
redeems himself, the victim, and with that redeemed self, now his own,
he sacrifices.' Kâ*n*va rec.

<span id="fn_222"></span>[83:2](sbe2614.htm#fr_223) Skambha visar*g*anî
('support or pin of the prop') is taken by Sâya*n*a in the sense of
'offshoot of the prop' or 'that which is let go (s*ri*sh*t*a) by the
prop.'

<span id="fn_223"></span>[83:3](sbe2614.htm#fr_224) I.e. belongs to
Varu*n*a or is of Varu*n*a's nature (varu*n*yo <span id="page_84">p.
84</span> bhavati). Sâya*n*a (if the MS. is correct) takes it in the
sense of 'is Varu*n*a himself,' etasmin krîtâvasare somo varu*n*o
bhavati.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[84:1](sbe2614.htm#fr_225) Or, 'may the
sacrifice encompass them all,' if, with Grassmann and Ludwig, we read
'ya*gñ*a*h*' instead of 'ya*gñ*am.' This verse is likewise recited (? at
the same time) by the Hot*ri*, see [p. 79](#page_79), note [2](#fn_209).
