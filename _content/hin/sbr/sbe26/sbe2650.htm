<p>invited together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_767"></A><A HREF="#fn_764"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' he (the Adhvaryu) rises. He takes a piece of the cake, and at the place where the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka, being seated, is now (about to) recite, he puts the piece of cake in his hand and says, 'O A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka, say what thou hast to say!' Now, the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka was excluded (from the Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_768"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

Indra and Agni preserved him for the production of creatures, whence the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka priest belongs to Indra and Agni. But it is by means of that sacrificial food, the piece of cake which he now puts in his hand, and by means of that (saying) of the seers which he now recites, it is thereby they (Indra and Agni) preserve him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:3">4:3:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. When the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka has (again) taken his seat</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (behind his hearth), he (his Adhvaryu) proceeds with the libations of the seasons (<I>Ri</I>tugraha). The reason why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons when the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka is seated, is that the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka represents a sexual union, since the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka belongs to Indra and Agni, and Indra and Agni are two, and a productive union means a pair: from that same productive union he produces the seasons, the year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:4">4:3:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. And again why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons, when the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka is seated. The seasons, the year, are everything; he thus produces everything: this is why he proceeds with the libations of the seasons when the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka is seated.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:5">4:3:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. Let him draw twelve of them,--twelve months there are. in the year: therefore he should draw twelve (cups of Soma). But he may also draw thirteen, for, they say, there is a thirteenth month&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Let him nevertheless draw twelve only, for such is completeness.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:6">4:3:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. He draws them from the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a (Soma trough), for the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and from out of that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati he produces the seasons, the year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:7">4:3:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. He draws them by means of double-mouthed cups&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_770"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;--for where is the end of those two (cups) that are double-mouthed? Hence this year revolves without end. When he has drawn this (libation), he does not deposit it: whence this year is ceaseless.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:8">4:3:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. He recites no invitatory prayer; since one</p>

<p>invites with an invitatory prayer, and the present season has already come, either by day or by night. Nor does he utter a second Vasha<I>t</I>, lest he should turn away the seasons. Simultaneously they (the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) draw the two first and the two last libations: thus they embrace everything here by means of the year, and everything here is embraced within the year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:9">4:3:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. Out (of the Havirdh&acirc;na shed) walks the one, in steps the other, whence these months pass following one another. But were both to walk out together, or were both to enter together, these months would assuredly pass separated one from the other: therefore while out walks the one, in steps the other.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:10">4:3:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. Six times they perform&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_771"></A><A HREF="#fn_768"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with, 'With the</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A></p>  
<p>season'--thereby the gods created the day; and four times with, 'With the seasons'--thereby they created the night. And, assuredly, were only this much (used), there would be nothing but night: it would never pass away.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:11">4:3:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. Over and above they perform twice with the formula 'With the season;' thereby the gods subsequently gave the day (again), whence it is now day there, then it will be night, and to-morrow day.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:12">4:3:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. By 'With the season' the gods forsooth created the men, and by 'With the seasons' the beasts; and because they created the beasts in the middle of those (men), therefore these beasts (cattle), being shut in on both sides, have come into the power of men.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:13">4:3:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. And having performed six times with, 'With the season,' they both turn round their vessels to the other side; and having performed four times with, 'With the seasons,' they turn round their vessels to the other side: from the one side (or mouth) indeed the gods created the day, and from the other side the night; from the one side the gods created men, and from the other beasts.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:14">4:3:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. Now he draws the cups (for the seasons)</p>

<p>therefrom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_772"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 30), 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Madhu!' the Adhvaryu takes (the first); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for M&acirc;dhava!' the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (the second). These two are the spring (months&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_773"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>): because in spring plants sprout and trees are brought to ripeness, therefore these two are Madhu (sweet) and M&acirc;dhava.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:15">4:3:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for <I>S</I>ukra!' the Adhvaryu draws (the third); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for <I>S</I>u<I>k</I>i!' the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (the fourth). These two are the summer (months): because during them it burns fiercest, therefore these two are <I>S</I>ukra (clear) and <I>S</I>u<I>k</I>i (bright).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:16">4:3:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Nabhas!' the Adhvaryu draws (the fifth); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Nabhasya!' the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (the sixth). These two are (the months) of the rainy season: it rains from yonder sky, and hence these two are Nabhas (mist, cloud) and Nabhasya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:17">4:3:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Ish (sap)!' the Adhvaryu draws (the seventh); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for &Ucirc;r<I>g</I> (food)!' the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (the eighth). These two are the autumn (months): because in autumn food (&ucirc;r<I>g</I>) and juice, (namely) plants, ripen, therefore these two are Isha and &Ucirc;r<I>g</I>a.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:18">4:3:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Sahas!' the Adhvaryu draws (the ninth); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Sahasya!' the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (the tenth). These two are the winter (months): because the winter by force (sahas) brings these creatures into his power, therefore these two are Saha and Sahasya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:19">4:3:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Tapas!' the Adhvaryu draws (the eleventh); with 'Thou art taken with a support: thee for Tapasya!' the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (the twelfth). These two are (the months) of the dewy season: because during them it freezes most severely, therefore these two are Tapas and Tapasya.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:20">4:3:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. With 'Thou art taken with a support: thee to A<I>m</I>hasaspati (lord of trouble)!' he (the Adhvaryu) draws the thirteenth libation, if he draw a thirteenth. The Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> then pours his residue into the Adhvaryu's vessel, or the Adhvaryu pours his residue into the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>'s vessel. He (the Adhvaryu) takes it (to the Sadas) for the purpose of drinking it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_774"></A><A HREF="#fn_771"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:21">4:3:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. Thereupon the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> draws the Aindr&acirc;gna graha with the vessel not used for the drinking. The reason why he draws the Aindr&acirc;gna libation with the vessel not used for drinking is that</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_323"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 323</FONT></A></p>  
<p>no second Vasha<I>t</I> is pronounced on the Ritugrahas, and for them he is about to take the Aindr&acirc;gna graha: thus they become consecrated for him by a second Vasha<I>t</I> through the Aindr&acirc;gna.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:22">4:3:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. And again, why he draws the Aindr&acirc;gna graha. By drawing the libations to the seasons he has generated this All, and having generated this All, he now establishes it on the out-breathing and in-breathing: hence this All is established on the out-breathing and in-breathing, for Indra and Agni are the out-breathing and in-breathing, and these two, heaven and earth, are the out-breathing and in-breathing, and within these two this All is established.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:23">4:3:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. And again, why he draws the Aindr&acirc;gna cup. By drawing the libations to the seasons he has generated this All, and having generated this All, he lays the out-breathing and in-breathing into this All: hence these two, the out-breathing anti in-breathing, are laid into (or beneficial, hita, in) this All.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:24">4:3:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. He now draws it from that (dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a trough) with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 3, 1; Rig-veda III, 12, 1), 'O Indra and Agni, through our songs come ye hither to the Soma, to the agreeable fume: drink thereof, urged by our hymn!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to Indra and Agni!'--with 'This is thy womb: thee to Indra and Agni!' he deposits it (on the mound), for it is for Indra and Agni that he draws it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:25">4:3:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. Thereupon he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva cup&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_775"></A><A HREF="#fn_772"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> For by drawing the Ritugrahas he has generated this All; but were there nothing but that, there would indeed be only as many, creatures as were created in the beginning: no (more) would be generated.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:26">4:3:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. Now, in that he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva graha, thereby he sends forth this All, these creatures in due order: whence these creatures are generated again repeatedly. He draws it with the <I>S</I>u<I>k</I>ra cup, for the <I>S</I>u<I>k</I>ra (bright) is yonder burning (sun), and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A></p>  
<p>what rays of his there are, they are the All-gods: therefore he draws it with the <I>S</I>ukra cup.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:3:1:27">4:3:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. He draws it from that (Soma in the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a) with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 33; Rig-veda I, 3, 7), 'Ye protectors and supporters of men, O All-gods, come hither, ye givers, to the giver's liquor!--Thou art taken with a support: thee to the All-gods!' with 'This is thy womb: thee to the All-gods!' he deposits it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_776"></A><A HREF="#fn_773"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for it is for the All-gods that he draws it.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_763"></A><A HREF="sbe2650.htm#fr_766">316:1</A> The Puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>a offerings, described in the preceding paragraphs, are followed by libations from the dvidevatya cups, viz. the Aindrav&acirc;yava, Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a, and A<I>s</I>vina. Each time the Adhvaryu is about to make a libation, the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> draws Soma-juice into the &Acirc;ditya cup (p&acirc;tra) and makes libations therefrom immediately after the Adhvaryu on the north side of the fire. And each time he pours the remains from the &Acirc;ditya cup into the &Acirc;ditya sth&acirc;l&icirc; with, 'Thee to the &Acirc;dityas!' finally covering the latter with the former (see <a href="sbe2654.htm#4:3:5:6">IV, 3, 5, 6</A>). Then follows the filling of the cups of the <I>K</I>amasins (see <A HREF="sbe2645.htm#page_287">p. 287</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2645.htm#fn_693">2</A>), and the libations from the <I>S</I>ukra and Manthin grahas (already anticipated in <a href="sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:13">IV, 2, 1, 13 </A>-<a href="sbe2645.htm#4:2:1:31">31</A>) and from the cups of the <I>K</I>amasins. Thereupon the Adhvaryu goes to the Sadas and sits down opposite the Hot<I>ri</I>; and in alternate draughts and with mutual 'invitations' they empty the <A NAME="page_317"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 317</FONT></A> dvidevatya cups. The remains are poured into the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup, and portions of the puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>as having then been put into those cups, they are deposited in the left track of the southern cart. The Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> then drink the remains of the <I>S</I>ukra and Manthin cups; the other priests also drinking from their cups, without, however, quite emptying them, after which the cup-bearers deposit them in the Havirdh&acirc;na, behind the axle of the southern cart. Henceforward, till the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva cup is drawn (<a href="sbe2650.htm#4:3:1:25">IV, 3, 1, 25</A>), those cups are called n&acirc;r&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa. The Adhvaryu then takes a piece of the sacrificial cake and rises, calling out, 'We are invited together;' after which follows the rehabilitation of the A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka, referred to above. Being called upon by the Adhvaryu, he recites the verse Rig-veda V, 25, 1 (beginning with 'a<I>kh</I>&acirc;,' whence perhaps his name), 'Hither will I sing Agni the god for your protection,' &amp;c., and then says, 'Ye Br&acirc;hmans, invite us Br&acirc;hmans also!' whereupon the Adhvaryu says, 'This Br&acirc;hman desires an invitation: invite him, Hot<I>ri</I>!' Being then invited, he pronounces an anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, and his cup-bearer fills his cup, which henceforth ranks last but one, thus preceding that of the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra. He now drinks from his cup, and the latter is then deposited along with the other <I>K</I>amasas; whereupon the priests, who have taken part in the offering of the puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>as, and the sacrificer eat the I<I>d</I>&acirc; in the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra fire-house.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_768"></A><A HREF="sbe2650.htm#fr_771">319:1</A> The twelve <I>Ri</I>tugrahas are drawn alternately by the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>--the first two and the last two simultaneously, the others singly, so that the one enters the cart-shed while the other leaves. Both in entering and leaving the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> passes by the Adhvaryu on the north side, and for a moment encircles him by passing his arms round him and holding his own vessel south of him. With the exception of the last two libations, the libations are offered up entire (holocausts). When either of them is about to offer one of the first six libations, he calls on the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a to 'Prompt (the Hot<I>ri</I>, &amp;c.) by the season!'--and at the four succeeding ones (after turning round the vessels so as to put the other mouth in front) to 'Prompt by the seasons!' For the last two libations they again reverse the vessels to the previous position and call on him to 'Prompt by the season!' The Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a's formula runs thus: 'Let the Hot<I>ri</I> pronounce the offering prayer to Indra!--From the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup, from heaven to earth, may he drink Soma together with the season (or, seasons)! O Hot<I>ri</I>, pronounce the offering prayer!' Whereupon the Hot<I>ri</I> (Pot<I>ri</I>, &amp;c.) recites--'We who worship,--From the Hot<I>ri</I>'s cup, from heaven to earth, may he drink Soma together with the season (or, seasons)! Vausha<I>t</I>!' These formulas are slightly varied according to the deity to whom the libation is offered, and the priest who pronounces the offering prayer and Vausha<I>t</I>. The <A NAME="page_320"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 320</FONT></A> deities and offering priests of the twelve libations are: 1. Indra--the Hot<I>ri</I>; 2. the Maruts--the Pot<I>ri</I>; 3.

Agni G<I>ri</I>hapati--the Hot<I>ri</I>. For this last libation, the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a in the first place calls on the sacrificer with, 'O lord of the house, pronounce the offering prayer!' and the sacrificer then again on the Hot<I>ri</I> with, 'O Hot<I>ri</I>; pronounce the offering prayer upon this!' whereupon the Hot<I>ri</I> pronounces the (sacrificer's) offering prayer.

<P><A NAME="fn_771"></A><A HREF="sbe2650.htm#fr_774">322:1</A> The K&acirc;<I>n</I>va text has 'bhakshyam' instead of 'bhaksham.' Each of the priests who have pronounced the offering prayer and Vausha<I>t</I> partakes of this Soma in his respective order,--the Hot<I>ri</I> thus taking four draughts; and the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> (who, after drawing the Aindr&acirc;gna cup, join them in the Sadas) drinking alternately from the same vessel with those Hot<I>ri</I> priests, who pronounced the Vasha<I>t</I> at their libations. As at the drawing of the libations, the vessel is turned round after the sixth and tenth offering priests have drank. The vessel having been emptied, the Adhvaryu takes it outside the Sadas, and then sits down in front of the Hot<I>ri</I>'s hearth, with his face to the east, till the recitation of the <I>S</I>astra (<a href="sbe2651.htm#4:3:2:2">IV, 3, 2, 2</A>).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_772"></A><A HREF="sbe2650.htm#fr_775">323:1</A> According to K&acirc;ty. IX, 13, 33 seq. the order of performance is as follows. In the first place the first &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya-<I>s</I>astra is recited. Thereupon the Adhvaryu fetches the Aindr&acirc;gna cup from the Havirdh&acirc;na (where it was deposited by the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>), makes a libation from it--after calling on the Hot<I>ri</I>, as at all libations accompanied <A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A> by a <I>s</I>astra, 'Singer of praises, recite Soma's offering prayer;' the n&acirc;r&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa cups being shaken by the cup-bearers at the same time--and then drinks the remaining Soma with the Hot<I>ri</I>. Thereupon he draws the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva cup from the Dro<I>n</I>akala<I>s</I>a, pours the remaining juice from the latter into the P&ucirc;tabh<I>ri</I>t, and spreads the straining-cloth over the empty vessels for the midday pressing. He also prepares the Savan&icirc;ya purod&acirc;<I>s</I>as (see <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#page_315">p. 315</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2607.htm#fn_99">4</A>), for the midday feast, omitting however the dish of clotted curds (payasy&acirc;). Then follows the chanting of the first &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya stotra by the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s, and the recitation of the Pra&uuml;ga-<I>s</I>astra by the Hot<I>ri</I>, after which takes place the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva libation (and emptying of the cup) in the same way as with the Aindr&acirc;gna--the <I>k</I>amasas being also drained of their contents by the respective priests. Then follows the distribution--already referred to <a href="sbe2647.htm#4:2:3:11">IV, 2, 3, 11</A> seq.--of the Soma in the Ukthya bowl into three parts for the three Hotrakas, now about to recite their <I>s</I>astras (preceded by their respective stotras). The Adhvaryu takes one portion of the Soma, calls on the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s to chant the stotra, and afterwards on the Pra<I>s</I>&acirc;st<I>ri</I> (Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a) to recite his <I>s</I>astra; after which he makes a libation from the portion of Soma, and pours the remainder into the Pra<I>s</I>&acirc;st<I>ri</I>'s cup, to be drunk by that priest. In the same way the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> then proceeds with the portions of the two other Hotrakas, viz. the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>kh</I>a<I>m</I>sin and A<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;ka. Each time also the ten <I>k</I>amasas are filled, and after libations therefrom, are emptied by the <I>K</I>amasins. See also <A HREF="sbe2645.htm#page_287">p. 287</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2645.htm#fn_693">2</A>. At the end of the performance the priests pass silently out (ni<I>h</I>sarp, see <A HREF="sbe2648.htm#page_299">p. 299</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2648.htm#fn_718">1</A>) of the Sadas by the back-door and out of the Vedi; the midday performance afterwards beginning with the pratisarpa<I>n</I>a, or 'creeping back' to the Sadas, with homage to the dhish<I>n</I>ya hearths, &amp;c.</P>
