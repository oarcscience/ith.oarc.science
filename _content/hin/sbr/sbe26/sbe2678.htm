<p>and--the G&acirc;rhapatya being a house (g<I>ri</I>ha), and a house being a resting-place--they thereby secured them in the house, and thus that food, gained by them, did not go away from them.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:9">4:6:9:9</A></FONT></span>9. And the second he offers with, 'Letting the sucking calf to the mother,'--he means to say by this, 'letting the fire go to the earth;'--'a sucking calf drinking from the mother,'--he thereby means the fire sucking the (moisture of the) earth;--'may he maintain increase of wealth among us,--Hail!' increase of wealth is cattle: they thus secure cattle for themselves.</p>

They go out eastward, and enter the (shed of the) Havirdh&acirc;na carts from behind towards the front; for from the front towards the back (they enter) when about to perform the sacrifice, but thus (it is done) at the rising from the session.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:12">4:6:9:12</A></FONT></span>12. That is, on the hinder shaft of the northern cart. 'We have gone to the light, we have become immortal,'--for they who sit through a sacrificial session become indeed the light, they</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_450"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 450</FONT></A></p>  
<p>become immortal;--'to the sky have we ascended from the earth,'--for they who sit through a sacrificial session indeed ascend from the earth to the sky;--'we have attained to the gods,'--for they indeed attain to the gods;--'to heaven, to the light!' thrice they repeat the finale; for they indeed become (partakers of) heaven and bliss. Thus, whatever the nature of his S&acirc;man is, that they come to be who sit through a sacrificial session.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:13">4:6:9:13</A></FONT></span>13. They creep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1046"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> along right under the axle of the southern cart: even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so do they free themselves from all evil. They creep along with an ati<I>kh</I>andas verse; for that, the ati<I>kh</I>andas (redundant metre), is all the metres;--thus evil does not overtake them: therefore they creep along with an ati<I>kh</I>andas verse.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:14">4:6:9:14</A></FONT></span>14. They creep along with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

Now, once on a time, the pith of V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech) wished to desert the gods who had won it; it tried to creep away along this earth, for V&acirc;<I>k</I> is</p>

<p>this earth: her pith are these plants and trees. By means of this S&acirc;man&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1047"></A><A HREF="#fn_1041"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they overtook it, and, thus overtaken, it returned to them. Hence upwards on this earth grow the plants, and upwards the trees. And in like manner does the pith of V&acirc;<I>k</I> wish to desert these (sacrificers) who have won it, and tries to creep away along this earth,--for V&acirc;<I>k</I> is this earth: her pith are these plants and trees.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:17">4:6:9:17</A></FONT></span>17. They chant verses of the queen of serpents; for the queen of serpents is this earth: through her they thus obtain everything. The prelude is performed by (the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) himself&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1048"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the chant is not joined in (by the choristers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1049"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>), lest some one else overhear it. For he would cause (the performance) to be in excess were another to chant; he would cause an excess, were another to join in it; he would cause an excess, were another to overhear it: therefore the prelude is performed by (the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) himself, and the chant is not joined in.</p>

Then the Adhvaryu's response&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1052"></A><A HREF="#fn_1046"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is, 'These sacrificers have prospered: happiness hath accrued unto them!' whereby he bespeaks success to human speech.</p>

For everything, indeed, is obtained, everything gained by them that sit through a sacrificial session,--they have performed with Ya<I>g</I>us prayers: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much; they have recited <I>Ri</I>k verses: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much; they have chanted S&acirc;mans: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much. But this has not been obtained, this has not been acquired by them, namely, the (theological) discussion, the sacred discourse: this is what they thereby obtain, what they acquire.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:21">4:6:9:21</A></FONT></span>21. Having 'crept' up to the Udumbara post, they restrain their speech. Now, they who perform the sacrifice with speech, milk and suck out the</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_454"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 454</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sacrifice; for sacrifice is speech. And previously to this, each of them sits speechless, strengthening his speech&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1054"></A><A HREF="#fn_1048"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and with their speech thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. But at this (disputation) the entire speech, thus obtained, becomes exhausted: that speech they all strengthen (by remaining) speechless, and with it thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the Atir&acirc;tra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1055"></A><A HREF="#fn_1049"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:22">4:6:9:22</A></FONT></span>22. They sit touching the Udumbara post&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1056"></A><A HREF="#fn_1050"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for strength is food, and the Udumbara tree is strength: with strength he thus invigorates speech.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:6:9:23">4:6:9:23</A></FONT></span>23. When the sun has set, they go out (of the Sadas) eastward, and sit down behind the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, in front of the Havirdh&acirc;na shed. Round them, sitting speechless, the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> carries the Vasat&icirc;var&icirc; water&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1057"></A><A HREF="#fn_1051"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>. For whatever object they perform the session, therewith let them release their speech. For in olden times the <I>Ri</I>shis were wont to hold sacrificial sessions for certain objects,--'such is our wish: may that be fulfilled!' And if they be desirous of different objects, desirous of subjects, desirous of offspring, desirous of cattle,--</p>

Thus they render their speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that auspicious (speech) they pray for blessings,--'May we be abundantly supplied with offspring!'--thereby they pray for offspring;--'May we be abundantly supplied with men!'--thereby they pray for men;--'May we be abundantly supplied with food!' thereby they pray for prosperity.</p>

Regarding these oblations, and the order of the subsequent ceremonies, there is indeed considerable difference of opinion among the ritualistic authorities. According to &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. VIII, 13, 1-2 all of them offer, but only the first oblation is to be performed on the G&acirc;rhapatya, and the second on the &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhr&icirc;ya. L&acirc;<I>t</I>y.

[The first of the above formulas is, according to that authority, to be used by them, when they touch the Udumbara post, see <a href="sbe2678.htm#4:6:9:22">IV, 6, 9, 22</A>.] The oblations completed, they are to proceed to the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, where the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s are to chant thrice the S&acirc;man II, 1126 (?); after which they enter the Sadas to perform the M&acirc;nasa-stotra.</P>

In connection with this Stotra, an imaginary libation to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-V&acirc;yu is performed, everything connected with which, from the up&acirc;kara<I>n</I>a (or introduction, on the part of the Adhvaryu, see <A HREF="sbe2662.htm#page_401">p. 401</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2662.htm#fn_931">1</A>) up to the bhaksha, or drinking of the cup by the priests, is done 'mentally' (that is, as would seem, by gestures merely). According to. &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. II, 13, 6, however, the Hot<I>ri</I> recites the same hymn in a low voice (up&acirc;<I>m</I><I>s</I>u), but not inaudibly, as a <I>S</I>astra. But see <A HREF="#page_452">p. 452</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_1044">1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1042"></A><A HREF="sbe2678.htm#fr_1048">451:2</A> Not by the Prastot<I>ri</I>, as is otherwise the case; see <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#page_310">p. 310</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#fn_747">1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1043"></A><A HREF="sbe2678.htm#fr_1049">451:3</A> See <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#page_311">p. 311</A>, note <A HREF="sbe2649.htm#fn_748">1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1044"></A><A HREF="sbe2678.htm#fr_1050">452:1</A> According to this (and T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya Br. IV, 9, 13) it would seem that the Hot<I>ri</I> is not to recite the hymn of the M&acirc;nasa-stotra, as prescribed by the Ait. Br. and &Acirc;<I>s</I>v.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1045"></A><A HREF="sbe2678.htm#fr_1051">452:2</A> The <I>k</I>aturhot<I>ri</I> formulas--so-called from four priests, Agn&icirc;dh, Adhvaryu, Hot<I>ri</I>; and Upavakt<I>ri</I>; being mentioned in them--are as follows: 'Their offering-spoon was (the power of) thinking; the ghee was thought; the altar was speech; the barhis was object of meditation; the fire was intelligence; the Agn&icirc;dh was understanding; the oblation was breath; the Adhvaryu was the S&acirc;man; the Hot<I>ri</I> was V&acirc;<I>k</I>aspati; the Upavakt<I>ri</I> was the mind;'--at the end of each of these ten formulas the Adhvaryu, according to &Acirc;<I>s</I>v., responds, 'Yea (om), Hotar! So (it is), O Hotar!'--(the Hot<I>ri</I> proceeds), 'They forsooth took that (m&acirc;nasa) graha; O V&acirc;<I>k</I>aspati! O disposer (or decree), O name! Let us praise thy name! Praise thou (and) by our name go to heaven! What success the gods have obtained with Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati as their g<I>ri</I>hapati, that success shall we obtain!'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1046"></A><A HREF="sbe2678.htm#fr_1052">452:3</A> ? That is, at the conclusion of the <I>k</I>aturhot<I>ri</I>-mantras. &Acirc;<I>s</I>v., on the other hand, makes the Hot<I>ri</I> conclude the Brahmodya with the benediction, 'O Adhvaryu, we have succeeded!' to which the latter is to respond, 'We have succeeded, O Hotar!'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1047"></A><A HREF="sbe2678.htm#fr_1053">452:4</A> That is, a discussion, or disputation, regarding the nature of the Brahman. According to T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya Br. IV, 9, 14, as interpreted by the commentary, the performance consists rather in (or is followed by?) vituperative remarks on Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, whom they have now safely got into their power (allusion being made, for instance, to his criminal relations to his daughter; to his having created thieves, gad-flies and mosquitos, &amp;c.); but this, it seems to me, is probably a wrong interpretation of the 'parivadanti' in the text, which may mean that 'they discourse' upon Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. So also K&acirc;ty. XII, 4, 21, <A NAME="page_453"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 453</FONT></A> Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pater agu<I>n</I>&acirc;khy&acirc;nam, 'agu<I>n</I>a' may have to be taken in the sense of 'nirgu<I>n</I>a' or 'nirgu<I>n</I>atvam' (unqualifiedness, unconditionedness), rather than in that of 'vice;' and it is worthy of note that the Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-tanu formulas, preceding the Brahmodya proper, consist chiefly in the enumeration of negative qualities. 'The twelve bodies of Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>apati are qualified as follows:--the eater of food and the mistress of food; the happy and glorious; the abodeless and dauntless; the unattained and unattainable; the invincible and irresistible; the unpreceded and unmatched.' Then follows the Brahmodya:--'Agni is the house-lord (g<I>ri</I>hapati),' so say some: 'he is the house-lord of this world;'--'V&acirc;yu is the house-lord,' so say some: 'he is the house-lord of the airy region;'--yonder (sun), forsooth, is the house-lord: he who burns yonder, he is the lord, and the seasons are the house. Verily, to whatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the g<I>ri</I>hapati, who knows that divine g<I>ri</I>hapati, that g<I>ri</I>hapati prospers, and they, the sacrificers, prosper: to whatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the g<I>ri</I>hapati, who knows the divine averter of evil, that g<I>ri</I>hapati averts evil, and they, the sacrificers, avert evil! See Ait. Br. V, 25. According to &Acirc;<I>s</I>v., the Hot<I>ri</I> alone would seem to repeat the Brahmodya. The expression v&acirc;kov&acirc;kya (dialogue) apparently refers to the controversial form of this discourse. See also A. Ludwig, Rig-veda, III p. 390 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1048"></A><A HREF="sbe2678.htm#fr_1054">454:1</A> The construction of the text is quite irregular, and I am by no means certain whether 't&acirc;m esh&acirc;m pur&acirc;' should not be separated from what follows, and have the verbs 'viduhanti' and 'nirdhayanti' supplied after them,--That (speech) of theirs (they milk and suck out) before this. Each now sits speech-bound, strengthening his speech, &amp;c.</P>
