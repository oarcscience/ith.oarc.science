Now Indra, when he had hurled the thunderbolt at V<I>ri</I>tra, thinking himself to be the weaker, and fearing lest he had not laid him low, hid himself. The gods also hid themselves away in the same place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:2">4:1:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. The gods then said, 'Verily, we know not if V<I>ri</I>tra be slain or alive: come, let one of us find out, if V<I>ri</I>tra be slain or alive!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:3">4:1:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. They said unto V&acirc;yu--V&acirc;yu, forsooth, is he that blows yonder--'Find thou out, O V&acirc;yu, if V<I>ri</I>tra be slain or alive; for thou art the swiftest among us: if he lives, thou indeed wilt quickly return hither.'</p>

He spake, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'The first Vasha<I>t</I> of king Soma!'--'So be it!' so V&acirc;yu went, and lo&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> V<I>ri</I>tra slain. He spake, 'V<I>ri</I>tra is slain: do ye with the slain what ye list!'</p>

The gods rushed thither,--as (those) eager to take possession of their property, so (it fared with) him (V<I>ri</I>tra--Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: what (part of him) one of them seized, that became an ekadevatya (graha, belonging to one deity), and what two of them, that became a dvidevatya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_638"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and what many (seized), that became a bahudevatya;--and because they caught him up each separately (vi-grah) by means of vessels, therefore (the libations) are called graha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:6">4:1:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. He stank in their nostrils,--sour and putrid he blew towards them: he was neither fit for offering, nor was he fit for drinking.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:7">4:1:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. The gods said to V&acirc;yu, 'V&acirc;yu, blow thou through him, make him palatable for us!' He said, 'What shall be my reward then?'--'After thee they shall name those cups.'--'So be it!' he said, 'but blow ye along with me!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:8">4:1:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. The gods dispelled some of that smell, and laid it into the cattle,--this is that foul smell in (dead) cattle: hence one must not close (his nose) at that foul smell, since it is the smell of king Soma.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:9">4:1:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. Nor must one spit thereat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; even though he should think himself ever so much affected, let him</p>

<p>go round it windward&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for Soma means eminence, and disease meanness: even as at the approach of his superior the meaner man would get down (from his seat), so does disease go down before him (Soma).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:10">4:1:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Then V&acirc;yu blew a second time through him and thereby made him palatable; whereupon he was fit for offering and fit for drinking. Hence those (vessels), though belonging to various deities, are called 'v&acirc;yavya (V&acirc;yu's vessels)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' His (V&acirc;yu's) is that first Vasha<I>t</I> of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:11">4:1:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Indra then thought within himself:--'V&acirc;yu, forsooth, has the largest share of this our sacrifice, since his is the first Vasha<I>t</I> of king Soma, and, moreover, those vessels are named after him: nay, but I, too, will desire a share therein!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:12">4:1:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. He said, 'V&acirc;yu, let me share in this cup!'--'What will then be?'--'Speech shall speak intelligibly&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_644"></A><A HREF="#fn_642"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>!'--'If speech will speak intelligibly, then will I let thee share!' Thus that cup henceforward belonged to Indra and V&acirc;yu, but theretofore it belonged to V&acirc;yu alone.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:13">4:1:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. Indra said, 'One half of this cup is mine!'--'Only one fourth is thine!' said V&acirc;yu.--'One half is mine!' said Indra.--'Only one fourth is thine!' said V&acirc;yu.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:14">4:1:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. They went to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati for his decision. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati divided the cup (of Soma) into two parts and said, 'This (half) is V&acirc;yu's!' Then he divided the (other) half into two parts and said, 'This is</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> V&acirc;yu's!--This is thine!' then he assigned to Indra a fourth part for his share--one fourth is the same as a quarter: henceforward that cup belonged, one fourth of it, to Indra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:15">4:1:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. Now with this libation there are two puroru<I>k</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_645"></A><A HREF="#fn_643"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>--formulas,--the first belonging to V&acirc;yu alone, and the second to Indra and V&acirc;yu; and two invitatory prayers (anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;),--the, first to V&acirc;yu alone, and the second to Indra and V&acirc;yu; and two praisha (directions),--the first belonging to V&acirc;yu alone, and the second to Indra and V&acirc;yu; and two offering prayers (y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;),--the first to V&acirc;yu alone, and the second to Indra and V&acirc;yu: thus he assigns to him (Indra) each time a fourth part for his share.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:16">4:1:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. He said, 'If they have assigned to me a fourth part each time for my share, then speech shall speak intelligibly only one fourth part!' Hence only that fourth part of speech is intelligible which men speak; but that fourth part of speech which beasts speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which birds speak is unintelligible; and that fourth part of speech which the small vermin here speaks is unintelligible.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:17">4:1:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. Wherefore it has been thus spoken by the <I>Ri</I>shi (Rig-veda I, 164, 45):--'Four are the measured grades of speech; the Br&acirc;hmans that are wise know them: three, deposited in secret, move not; the fourth grade of speech men speak.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:18">4:1:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. He now draws (the graha) from that (stream of Soma)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_646"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 7; Rig-veda VII, 92, I), 'Come nigh to us, O V&acirc;yu, sipping of</p>

<p>the pure (Soma)! Thine are a thousand steeds, O bestower of all boons! Unto thee hath been offered the gladdening juice whereof thou, O God, takest the first draught!--Thee for V&acirc;yu!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="4:1:3:19">4:1:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. And, having withdrawn (the cup), he again fills it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="sbe2643.htm#fn_645"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. VII, 8; Rig veda I, 2, 4), 'O Indra and V&acirc;yu, here is Soma-juice: come ye hither for the refreshing draught, the drops long for you!--Thou art taken with a support&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="sbe2643.htm#fn_646"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>!--Thee for V&acirc;yu, for Indra and V&acirc;yu!'--with 'This is thy womb&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="sbe2643.htm#fn_647"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: thee for the closely united!' he deposits (the cup). As to why he says, 'Thee for the closely united,'--he who is V&acirc;yu, is Indra; and he who is Indra, is V&acirc;yu: therefore he says, 'This is thy womb: thee for the closely united!'</p>
