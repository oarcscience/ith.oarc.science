### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

##### E. CONCLUDING CEREMONIES.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:1">4:4:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
it is nine Samish*t*aya*g*us <span id="fr_875"></span>[2](#fn_872) he
offers on this occasion. The reason why he offers nine Samish*t*aya*g*us
is that those stotra-verses at the Bahishpavamâna <span
id="fr_876"></span>[3](#fn_873) chant amount to nine. Thus there is at
both ends an inferior (incomplete) virâ*g* <span
id="fr_877"></span>[4](#fn_874), for the

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

sake of production: it was from that same inferior (lower) source of
production on both sides that Pra*g*âpati produced the creatures,--from
the one (he created) the upright, and from the other those tending to
the ground. And in like manner does he (the Adhvaryu) now create
creatures from that lower source of production on both sides,--from the
one the upright, and from the other those tending to the ground.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:2">4:4:4:2</span></span>2. The
call 'Hi*m*' is the tenth of stotra-verses, and the 'Svâhâ' (the tenth)
of these (Samish*t*aya*g*us): and thus does this incomplete virâ*g* come
to consist of tens and tens.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:3">4:4:4:3</span></span>3. And as
to why they are called Samish*t*aya*g*us. Whatever deities he invites at
this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice is performed,
they all are thereby 'sacrificed-to together' (sam-ish*t*a); and
because, after all those (deities) have been 'sacrificed-to together,'
he now offers those (libations), therefore they are called
Samish*t*aya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:4">4:4:4:4</span></span>4. And as
to why he offers the Samish*t*aya*g*us. Now, the self of him who has
sacrificed has, as it were, become emptied, since he gives away of
whatever is his: it is him he fills again by three out of these
(oblations).

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:5">4:4:4:5</span></span>5. And as
to the three following which he offers,--whatever deities he invites at
this sacrifice, and for whatever deities this sacrifice is performed,
they continue waiting till the Samish*t*aya*g*us are performed,
thinking, 'These, forsooth, he must offer unto us!' It is these same
deities he thereby dismisses in due form whithersoever their course
lies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:6">4:4:4:6</span></span>6. And as
to the three last which he offers,--in performing the sacrifice he has
produced it, and,

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

having produced it, he firmly establishes it where there is a safe
resting-place for it: this is why he performs the Samish*t*aya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:7">4:4:4:7</span></span>7. He
offers (the first) with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 15; Rig-veda V, 42, 4), 'With
thought lead us, O Indra, to meet with kine,'--'with thought him who was
emptied he thereby fills with thought; with kine;' him who was emptied
he thereby fills with kine;--'with patrons, O mighty Lord, with
well-being; with prayer which is divinely inspired <span
id="fr_878"></span>[1](#fn_875),'--'with prayer:' him who was emptied he
thereby fills with prayer;--'with the favour of the adorable gods!
Hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:8">4:4:4:8</span></span>8. \[The
second with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 16\], 'With lustre, with sap, with
bodies,'--'with lustre him who was emptied he thereby fills with lustre;
with sap,'--sap is vigour--him who was emptied he thus fills with
sap;--'We have united, with the happy spirit: may Tvash*tri*, the
dispenser of boons, grant us riches, and may he smooth what was injured
in our body!' Thus they heal what was torn.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:9">4:4:4:9</span></span>9. \[The
third with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, I7; Atharva-veda VII, 17, 4\], 'May the
gracious Dhât*ri*, Savit*ri*, Pra*g*âpati, the guardian of treasures,
and the divine Agni accept this (offering); and Tvash*tri* and Vish*n*u:
grant ye willingly to the sacrificer wealth together with children!
Hail!' Him who was emptied he fills again, when he says, 'grant ye
wealth to the sacrificer, Hail!'

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:10">4:4:4:10</span></span>10.
\[The fourth with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 18 <span
id="fr_879"></span>[1](#fn_876)\], 'Accessible homes have we prepared
for you, O gods, who graciously came to this Soma feast;'--whereby he
means to say, 'seats easy of access we have prepared for you, O gods,
who have graciously come to this Soma feast;'--'Carrying and driving the
offerings,' thereby he dismisses the several deities; 'Those forsooth
who are without cars may go away carrying; and those who have cars may
go away driving,' this is what he means to say; therefore he says,
'Carrying and driving the offerings;'--'bestow goods on him, ye good!
Hail!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:11">4:4:4:11</span></span>11.
\[The fifth with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 19; Atharva-veda VII, 97, 3\], 'The
willing gods whom thou, O God, broughtest hither, speed them each to his
own abode, O Agni!' For to Agni he said, 'Bring hither such and such
gods! bring hither such and such gods!' and to him he now says,
'Whatever gods thou hast brought hither, make them go whithersoever
their course lies!'--'Ye have all eaten and drunk,'--for they have eaten
the cakes of the animal offering, and they have drunk the king Soma:
therefore he says, 'ye have all eaten and drunk;'--'Draw ye nigh to the
air, to the heat, to the light! H ail!' Hereby, then, he dismisses the
deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:12">4:4:4:12</span></span>12.
\[The sixth with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 20\], 'Thee, O Agni, have we chosen
here for our Hot*ri* at the opening of this sacrifice: severally hast
thou offered to them, and severally hast thou toiled; well-knowing the
sacrifice, draw thou nigh <span id="fr_880"></span>[2](#fn_877), thou
the wise! Hail!' by this (verse) he releases Agni, dismisses Agni.

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:13">4:4:4:13</span></span>13.
\[The seventh with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 21\], 'Ye path-finding gods,'--for
the gods are, indeed, the finders of the path;--'having found the
path,'--'having found the sacrifice,' he thereby means to say;--'go ye
in the path!' therewith he dismisses them in due form;--'O divine Lord
of mind, this sacrifice--Svâhâ!--give thou to the wind!' for the
sacrifice, indeed, is yonder blowing (wind): having thus completed this
sacrifice, he establishes it in that sacrifice, and thus unites
sacrifice with sacrifice,--hence he says, 'Svâhâ! give (it) to the
wind!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="4:4:4:14">4:4:4:14</span></span>14.
\[The eighth with Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 22\], 'O sacrifice, go to the
sacrifice, go to the lord of the sacrifice, go to thine own womb,
Hail!'--the sacrifice, thus established, he thereby establishes in its
own womb. \[The ninth he offers with\], 'This is thy sacrifice, O lord
of the sacrifice, bestowing numerous heroes, together with the song of
praise: do thou accept it, Hail!' the sacrifice, thus established,
bestowing numerous heroes, together with the song of praise he thereby
finally establishes in the sacrificer.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[374:2](sbe2658.htm#fr_875) See I, 9, 2, 25
seq.

<span id="fn_873"></span>[374:3](sbe2658.htm#fr_876) See [p.
310](sbe2649.htm#page_310), note [1](sbe2649.htm#fn_747).

<span id="fn_874"></span>[374:4](sbe2658.htm#fr_877) The virâ*g*
consists of pâdas of ten syllables. For the same speculation, see II, 5,
I, 20.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[376:1](sbe2658.htm#fr_878) ? The author of the
Brâhma*n*a would rather seem to take it in the sense of 'with the
priestly authority (sacerdotium) instituted by the gods.'

<span id="fn_876"></span>[377:1](sbe2658.htm#fr_879) Cf. Atharva-veda
VII, 97, 4.

<span id="fn_877"></span>[377:2](sbe2658.htm#fr_880) That is, according
to Mahîdhara, 'knowing that the sacrifice <span id="page_378">p.
378</span> is accomplished, go thou to thine own house!' Cf.
Atharva-veda VII, 97, 1 ('draw near to Soma!').
