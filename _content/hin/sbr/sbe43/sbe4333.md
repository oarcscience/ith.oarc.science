### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### LEADING FORWARD OF AGNI TO THE FIRE-ALTAR.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:2:1">9:2:2:1</span></span>1. Having
returned to the (Gârhapatya <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_318)) in
order to take forward the fire, he offers oblations, and puts on pieces
of firewood. For now that Agni was about to go forward (to the
fire-altar), the gods regaled him with food, both with oblations and
pieces of firewood; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that
he (Agni) is about to go forward, regale him with food, both with
oblations and pieces of firewood. He takes (ghee) in five ladlings: the
meaning of this has been explained.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:2:2">9:2:2:2</span></span>2. He
then takes (ghee) in sixteen ladlings <span
id="fr_324"></span>[1](#fn_319),--Pra*g*âpati consists of sixteen parts,
and Pra*g*âpati is Agni: he thus regales him with food proportionate to
his body; and the food which is proportionate to the body satisfies and
does no injury; but that which is excessive does injury, and that which
is too little does not satisfy. He takes (the oblations) in the same
offering-ladle, for one and the same (Agni) is he whom he regales
therewith. With two (verses) addressed to Vi*s*vakarman he offers; for
this Agni is Vi*s*vakarman (the all-worker): it is him he thereby
gratifies. Three oblations he offers,--threefold is Agni: as great as
Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus regales
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:2:3">9:2:2:3</span></span>3. He
then puts on the pieces of firewood: this is as if, after regaling some
one, one were to attend upon him. They are of udumbara (ficus glomerata)
wood; for the Udumbara is food and sap: with food and sap he thus
regales him. They are fresh (green), for that part of trees which is
fresh is uninjured and living: he thus regales him with what is
uninjured and living in trees. They are soaked in ghee; for ghee is
sacred to Agni: with his own portion, with his own sap he thus regales
him. They remain the whole night in it, for there they become imbued
with sap. Three pieces of wood he puts on,--threefold is Agni: as great
as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus
regales him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:2:4">9:2:2:4</span></span>4. And;
again, as to why he offers those oblations;--now that he (Agni) was
about to go forward,

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

the gods restored (recruited) him beforehand with food, with these
oblations; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he (Agni)
is about to go forward, restore him beforehand with food, with these
oblations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:2:5">9:2:2:5</span></span>5. He
takes (ghee) in five ladlings, for fivefold divided is that vital air in
the head,--the mind, speech, the breath, the eye, and the ear,--he thus
lays that fivefold divided vital air into this head. \[He offers it,
with, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 16\], 'Agni, with sharp flame, (may destroy every
demon! Agni gaineth wealth for us)' thus with a (verse) containing (the
word) 'sharp': he therewith sharpens his head so as to become sharp.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:2:6">9:2:2:6</span></span>6. He
then takes (ghee) in sixteen ladlings: eight vital airs, and eight
limbs <span id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_320),--this (the symbolical)
amount. He takes it in the same spoon, for, indeed, the vital airs and
the limbs are in the same body. Separately <span
id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_321) he offers: he thereby makes a
distinction between the vital airs and the limbs. With two (verses)
addressed to Vi*s*vakarman he offers: Vi*s*vakarman is this Agni, it is
him he thus puts together. Three oblations he offers,--threefold is
Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food
he thus restores him. With seventeen verses (he offers) <span
id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_322),--Pra*g*âpati is seventeenfold, and
Pra*g*âpati is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure,
with so much he thus restores him.

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> With (ghee) taken
in twenty-one ladlings (he offers the two oblations),--there are twelve
months, five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun as the
twenty-first: this is the (symbolical) amount (or, correspondence).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:2:2:7">9:2:2:7</span></span>7. And,
again, as to why he puts the pieces of firewood on; the gods having set
him up wholly and completely, now regaled him with this food, these
pieces of firewood; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that
he has set him up wholly and completely, regale him with this food,
these pieces of firewood. They are of udumbara wood, and fresh, and
remain for a whole night (being) soaked in ghee: the significance of
this has been explained. \[He puts them on, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVII,
50-52\], 'Upwards lead thou him, O Agni! . . . Forward lead thou him, O
Indra! . . . In whose house we make offering . . .,' as the text, so the
meaning. Three pieces of firewood he puts on,--threefold is Agni: as
great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much food he thus
regales him. Three oblations he offers,--that makes six: the
significance of this has been explained.
