### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:1">8:4:2:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down the Sp*ri*ta*h* <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_137)
(freeing

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

bricks). For when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pra*g*âpati
became pregnant with all beings: whilst they were in his womb, evil,
death, seized them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:2">8:4:2:2</span></span>2. He
spake to the gods, 'With you I will free all these beings from evil,
from death <span id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_138)!'--'What will accrue
unto us therefrom?'--'Choose ye!' said he.--'Let there be a share for
us!' said some to him. 'Let lordship be unto us!' said others. Having
bestowed a share on some, and lordship on others, he freed all beings
from evil, from death; and inasmuch as he freed (sp*ri*) them, therefore
(those bricks are called) 'Sp*ri*ta*h*.' And in like manner does this
Sacrificer, by bestowing a share on some, and lordship on others, now
free all beings from evil, from death; and hence (the word) 'sp*ri*tam
(freed)' recurs with all of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:3">8:4:2:3</span></span>3. \[He
lays them down <span id="fr_140"></span>[2](#fn_139), with, Vâ*g*. S.
XIV, 24-26\], Agni's share thou art, Dîkshâ's lordship!'--Dîkshâ,
doubtless, is Speech: having bestowed a share on Agni, he bestows
lordship on Speech;--'the Brahman is freed; the Triv*ri*t-stoma!'--by
means of the thrice-threefold hymn-form he freed

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

the Brahman (priesthood) for living beings from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:4">8:4:2:4</span></span>4.
'Indra's share thou art, Vish*n*u's lordship!'--Having bestowed a share
on Indra, he bestowed lordship on Vish*n*u;--'the Kshatra is freed; the
Pa*ñk*ada*s*a-stoma!'--by means of the fifteenfold hymn-form he freed
the Kshatra (nobility) for living beings from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:5">8:4:2:5</span></span>5. 'The
man-viewers’ share thou art, the creator's lordship!'--the man-viewers,
doubtless, are the gods: having bestowed a share on the gods, he
bestowed lordship on the creator;--'the birthplace is freed, the
Saptada*s*a-stoma!'--the birthplace, doubtless, is the peasantry: by
means of the seventeenfold hymn-form he frees the peasantry for living
beings from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:6">8:4:2:6</span></span>6.
'Mitra's share thou art, Varu*n*a s lordship!'--Mitra, doubtless, is the
out-breathing, and Varu*n*a the down-breathing: having bestowed a share
on the out-breathing, he bestowed lordship on the
down-breathing;--'heaven's rain, the wind is freed; the
Ekavi*ms*a-stoma!'--by means of the twenty-one-fold hymn-form he frees
both rain and wind for living beings from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:7">8:4:2:7</span></span>7. 'The
Vasus’ share thou art, the Rudras' lordship!'--having bestowed a share
on the Vasus, he bestowed lordship on the Rudras;--'the four-footed is
freed, the *K*aturvi*ms*a-stoma!'--by means of the twenty-five-fold
hymn-form he freed the four-footed for living beings from evil, from
death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:8">8:4:2:8</span></span>8. 'The
Âdityas’ share thou art, the Maruts’ lordship!'--having bestowed a share
on the Âdityas, he bestowed lordship on the Maruts;--'the

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

embryos are freed, the Pa*ñk*avi*ms*a-stoma!'--by means of the
twenty-five-fold hymn-form he freed the embryos for living beings from
evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:9">8:4:2:9</span></span>9.
'Aditi's share thou art, Pûshan's lordship!'--Aditi, doubtless, is this
(earth): having bestowed a share on her, he bestowed lordship on
Pûshan,--'vigour is freed; the Tri*n*ava-stoma!' by means of the
thrice-ninefold hymn-form he freed vigour for living beings from evil,
from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:10">8:4:2:10</span></span>10.
'God Savit*ri*'s share thou art, B*ri*haspati's lordship!'--having
bestowed a share on the god Savit*ri*, he bestows lordship on
B*ri*haspati;--'the facing quarters are freed, the *K*atush*t*oma!'--by
means of the chant of praise consisting of four stomas he freed all the
(four) quarters for living beings from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:11">8:4:2:11</span></span>11.
'The Yavas’ share thou art, the Ayavas’ lordship!'--the Yavas,
doubtless, are the first (light) fortnights, and the Ayavas the latter
(dark) fortnights, for these gain (yu) and obtain (â-yu) everything
here <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_140): having bestowed a share on
the first fortnights, he bestowed lordship on the latter
fortnights;--'the creatures are freed, the
*K*atus*k*atvâri*ms*a-stoma!'--by means of the forty-four-fold hymn-form
he freed all creatures from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:12">8:4:2:12</span></span>12.
'The Ribhus’ share thou art, the All-gods’ lordship!'--having bestowed a
share on the Ribhus, he bestowed lordship on the Vi*s*ve-Devâ*h*;--

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'the living being
is freed, the Trayastri*ms*a-stoma!'--by means of the thirty-three-fold
hymn-form he freed all living beings from evil, from death; and in like
manner does the Sacrificer, by means of the thirty-three-fold hymn-form,
now free all living beings from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:13">8:4:2:13</span></span>13.
These, then, are ten bricks he lays down,--the Virâ*g* consists of ten
syllables, and Agni is Virâ*g* (wide-shining); there are ten regions,
and Agni is the regions; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital
airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he
thus frees all these creatures from evil, from death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:14">8:4:2:14</span></span>14. He
then lays down two *Ri*tavyâs <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141)
(seasonal bricks);--the seasonal ones being the same as the seasons, it
is the seasons he thus lays down;--with (Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 27), 'Saha and
Sahasya, the two winter-seasons!' These are the names of those two, it
is with their names he thus lays them down. There are two such bricks,
for a season consists of two months. Only once he settles them: he thus
makes (the two months) one season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:15">8:4:2:15</span></span>15. And
as to why he places these two (bricks) in this (layer),--this Agni
(fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds: what part
thereof is above the air, and below the sky, that is this fourth layer,
and that is the winter-season thereof; and when he places these two in
this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Pra*g*âpati-Agni, the year and
fire-altar) what part of his body these two (constitute). This is why he
places these two in this (layer).

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:2:16">8:4:2:16</span></span>16.
And, again, as to why he places these two in this (layer),--this Agni is
Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the year: what (part) of him there is
above the waist, and below the head, that is this fourth layer, and that
is the winter-season of him (or, of it, the year). And when he places
these two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him what part of his
body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in this
(layer).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_137"></span>[66:2](sbe4316.htm#fr_138) The ten Sp*ri*ta*h*
are placed in close connection with the preceding set;--viz. at the
front and back ends of the spine, two <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>
bricks, exactly corresponding in size to those already lying there, are
placed south and north of these respectively. Similarly two bricks, a
foot square, are placed on the 'cross-spine' immediately north of the
two stoma-bricks lying there. The remaining six bricks are then placed
behind the row of fourteen 'stomas' in the front part of the altar,
three on each side of the spine.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[67:1](sbe4316.htm#fr_139) Or, from that evil,
death.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[67:2](sbe4316.htm#fr_140) In the case of the
first four Sp*ri*ta*h*, as in that of the corresponding Stomas (see p.
6r, note r), while the bricks themselves are laid down in the order E.
W. N. S., the order in which the formulas are given in paragraphs 3-6,
is that of E. N. S.W.--Cp. Kâty. *S*rautas. XVII, 10, 11-14. For a
symbolical explanation of this change of order, see [VIII, 4, 4,
1](sbe4318.htm#8:4:4:1) seq.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[69:1](sbe4316.htm#fr_141) This is clearly a
fanciful etymology. If 'yava' and 'ayava,' in the sense of the bright
and dark fortnights, are really genuine terms, it is more likely that
they are derived from yu, 'to keep off,'--the bright half of the moon
being looked upon as capable of averting evil spirits, and the dark half
as the reverse of this.

<span id="fn_141"></span>[70:1](sbe4316.htm#fr_142) These are placed
over the *Ri*tavyâs of the preceding layers, viz. in the fifth place to
the east of the centre, south and north of the spine.
