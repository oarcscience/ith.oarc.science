Now, indeed, there is this twofold thing, to wit, the eater and that which is eaten&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_820"></A><A HREF="#fn_807"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and when this pair meets it is called the eater, and not the eaten.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:2">10:6:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. Now that eater is the same as this Agni (the fire and fire-altar); and whatever they assign to him is his assignments; and these assignments (&acirc;hiti) are mystically called oblations (&acirc;huti), for the gods love the mystic.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:3">10:6:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. And the eater, doubtless, is the sun, and his assignments (offerings) are the moon, for the moon is assigned to the sun&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_821"></A><A HREF="#fn_808"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Thus much as to the deity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:4">10:6:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. Now as to the body. The eater, doubtless, is the breath, and its assignments are food, for the food is consigned to (the channel of) the breath. Thus much as to Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:5">10:6:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Now as to the Arka (flame). The Arka, doubtless, is Agni; and his joy are the oblations, for the oblations are a joy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="#fn_809"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to Agni.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:7">10:6:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. Now as to the body. The Arka, doubtless, is the breath, and his joy is food, for food is a joy to (the channel of) the breath. Thus much as to the Arka.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:8">10:6:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. Now as to the Uktha (song of praise). The 'uk,' doubtless, is Agni, and his 'tham' is oblations, for by oblations Agni rises (ut-th&acirc;, i. e. blazes up).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:9">10:6:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. And the 'uk,' doubtless, is the sun, and his 'tham' is the moon, for by the moon the sun rises. Thus much as to the deity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:10">10:6:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. Now as to the body. The 'uk,' doubtless, is the breath, and the 'tham' is food, for by food the breath rises (increases). Thus much as to the Uktha. That Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like one is the same as the Purusha; and, verily, the enemy withers away of whosoever, knowing this, thus serves that Agni-like, Arka-like, Uktha-like Purusha.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:6:2:11">10:6:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. The fire, indeed, is kindled by the breath, the wind by the fire, the sun by the wind, the moon by the sun, the stars by the moon, and the lightning by the stars&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_823"></A><A HREF="#fn_810"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--so great, indeed, is the kindling both in this and in yonder world; and, verily, whosoever knows this is enkindled to that full extent both in this and in yonder world.</p>
