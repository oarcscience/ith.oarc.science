He said,--Verily, that Agni is the breath; for when man sleeps, speech passes into the breath, and so do the eye, the mind, and the ear; and when he awakes, they again issue from the breath.

Now, when that fire goes out, it is wafted up in the wind (air), whence people say of it, 'It has expired&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_647"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' for it is wafted up in the wind. And when the sun sets it enters the wind, and so does the moon; and the quarters are established in the wind, and from out of the wind they issue again. And when he who knows this passes away from this world, he passes into the fire by his speech, into the sun by his eye, into the moon by his mind, into the quarters by his ear, and into the wind by his breath; and being composed thereof, he becomes whichever of these deities he chooses, and is at rest.</p>
