### FIFTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:1:1">10:5:1:1</span></span>1. The
mystic import of this Fire-altar, doubtless, is Speech; for it is with
speech that it is built: with the *Rik*, the Ya*g*us and the Sâman as
the divine (speech); and when he (the Adhvaryu) speaks with human
speech, 'Do ye this! do ye that!' then also it (the altar) is built
therewith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:1:2">10:5:1:2</span></span>2. Now,
this speech is threefold--the *Ri*k-verses, the Ya*g*us-formulas, and
the Sâman-tunes;--thereby the Fire-altar is threefold, inasmuch as it is
built with that triad. Even thus, then, it is threefold; but in this
respect also it is threefold, inasmuch as three kinds of bricks are put
into it--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and
those with neuter names; and these limbs of men also are of three
kinds--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those
with neuter names.

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:1:3">10:5:1:3</span></span>3. This
body (of the altar), indeed, is threefold; and with this threefold body
he obtains the threefold divine Am*ri*ta (nectar, immortality). Now all
these (bricks) are called 'ish*t*akâ (f.),' not 'ish*t*aka*h* (m.),' nor
'ish*t*akam (n.):' thus (they are called) after the form of speech
(vâ*k*, f.), for everything here is speech--whether feminine (female),
masculine (male), or neuter--for by speech everything here is obtained.
Therefore he 'settles' all (the bricks) <span
id="fr_725"></span>[1](#fn_713) with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady
(dhruvâ, f.)!' not with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruva*h*, m.)!'
or with, 'Aṅgiras-like lie thou steady (dhruvam, n.)!' for it is that
Speech he is constructing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:1:4">10:5:1:4</span></span>4. Now,
this speech is yonder sun, and this (Agni, the Fire-altar) is Death:
hence whatsoever is on this side of the sun all that is field by Death;
and he who builds it (the Fire-altar) on this side thereof, builds it as
one held by Death, and he surrenders his own self unto Death; but he who
builds it thereabove, conquers recurring Death, for by his knowledge
that (altar) of his is built thereabove.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:1:5">10:5:1:5</span></span>5. This
speech, indeed, is threefold--the *Ri*k-verses, the Ya*g*us-formulas,
and the Sâman-tunes the *Ri*k-verses are the orb, the Sâman-tunes the
light, and the Ya*g*us-formulas the man (in the sun); and that immortal
element, the shining light, is this lotus-leaf <span
id="fr_726"></span>[2](#fn_714): thus, when he builds up the Fire-altar

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

after laying down the lotus-leaf, it is on that immortal element that he
builds for himself a body consisting of the *Ri*k, the Ya*g*us, and the
Sâman; and he becomes immortal.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_713"></span>[365:1](sbe4366.htm#fr_725) See VI, 1, 2, 28;
VII, 1, 1, 30.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[365:2](sbe4366.htm#fr_726) Viz. the lotus-leaf
deposited in the centre of the altar-site, before the first layer is
laid down, see VII, 4, 1, 7 seqq., where, however, it is represented as
symbolising the womb whence Agni (the fire-altar) is to be born.
