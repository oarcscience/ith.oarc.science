### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:1">8:4:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
then, as to the order of proceeding. That (brick) which contains the
Triv*ri*t (thrice-threefold stoma) he places in front, that containing
the twenty-one-fold (stoma) at the back, that containing the fifteenfold
(stoma) on the right (south) side, that containing the seventeenfold
(stoma) on the left (north) side.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:2">8:4:4:2</span></span>2. Now
when the one containing the Triv*ri*t had been laid down, Death lay in
wait for Pra*g*âpati in the one (on the south side) containing the
fifteenfold (stoma), thinking, 'After that he will lay down this one: I
will here seize upon him!' He (Pra*g*âpati) was aware of him, and having
seen him, he walked round and laid down (at the back) the (brick)
containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma). Death came thither, and he
(Pra*g*âpati) laid down the one (on the south side) containing the
fifteenfold (stoma). Death came to the fifteenfold one, and he
(Pra*g*âpati) laid down the one (on the north side) containing the
seventeenfold (stoma). It was here <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_146)
that he put down and confounded Death; and in like manner does the
Sacrificer now put down and confound all evils

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:3">8:4:4:3</span></span>3. Then
as to the subsequent (bricks). Alongside of the one (in front)
containing the Triv*ri*t he lays down one containing the Triv*ri*t;
alongside of that (at the back) containing the Ekavi*ms*a (he lays down)
one containing the Ekavi*ms*a; alongside of that (on the south, or
right, side) containing the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a (he lays down) one containing
the Saptada*s*a; alongside of that (on the north, or left, side)
containing the Saptada*s*a (he lays down) one containing the
Pa*ñk*ada*s*a. And because he thus changes in laying them down <span
id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_147), therefore they (the bricks) are of
diverse stomas; and because these stomas are then otherwise with regard
to the former ones <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_148), therefore also
they (the bricks) are of diverse stomas. And in this way the gods laid
them down, and otherwise the Asuras; whereupon the gods succeeded, and
the Asuras came to naught: he who knows this, succeeds of himself, and
his hateful enemy comes to naught.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:4">8:4:4:4</span></span>4. Now,
this Agni (fire-altar) is an animal, and he is made up (restored) here
whole and entire. His head is the two (bricks) containing the Triv*ri*t;
and as to why these two are such as contain the Triv*ri*t,--the head is
threefold (triv*ri*t). There are two of them, because the head consists
of two bones (kapâla). He lays them down in front, for this head is in
the front (of the animal).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:5">8:4:4:5</span></span>5. The
two (behind) containing the Ekavi*ms*a are the foundation (the feet).
And as to why these are such as contain the Ekavi*ms*a,--the Ekavi*ms*a
is

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

a foundation. There are two of them,--because the foundation is a pair
(of feet). He places them behind, because this foundation (the
hind-feet) is behind.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:6">8:4:4:6</span></span>6. The
two containing the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_149)
are the arms (or fore-feet). And as to why these are such as contain the
Pa*ñk*ada*s*a,--the arms are fifteenfold. There are two of them, because
these arms are two. He places them on the sides, because these two arms
are at the sides.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:7">8:4:4:7</span></span>7. The
two containing the Saptada*s*a are food. And as to why they are such as
contain the Saptada*s*a,--food is seventeenfold. There are two of them,
because 'anna' (food) has two syllables. He lays them down close to
those containing the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a he thus puts the food close to the
arms. Those containing the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a are on the outside, and those
containing the Saptada*s*a on the inside: he thus encloses the food on
both sides by the arms.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:8">8:4:4:8</span></span>8. And
those he places in the middle are the body (trunk). He places them on
the range of the Reta*h*si*k* (bricks), for--the Reta*h*si*k* being the
ribs, and the ribs being the middle (of the body)--this body is in the
middle (of the limbs) <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_150). He places
them in every direction, for this body (extends) in every direction. And
as to what other (space) there is besides this, that is left over;--and
what is left over for the gods, that is these metres;--and as to these

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

metres, they are cattle;--and as to cattle, they are (objects of) good
fortune;--and as to these (objects of) good fortune, they are yonder
sun: he is that one to the south of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:9">8:4:4:9</span></span>9. Now
some lay down these (rows of bricks <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_151)) immediately after the two containing
the Triv*ri*t, saying, 'They are the tongue and the jaws: those fourteen
are the jaws, and those six are the tongue.' Let him not do so: they
cause a redundancy,--it would be just as if one were to put two other
jaws to the already existing jaws, as if one were to put another tongue
to the already existing tongue. That (brick) wherein the head is indeed
(includes) the jaws and the tongue.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:10">8:4:4:10</span></span>10. Now
some lay down (these bricks) in the intermediate (south-eastern) space
of it (the altar) <span id="fr_153"></span>[2](#fn_152), saying, 'This
is the sun: we thus place yonder sun in that direction.' Let him not do
so: surely there are those other rites <span
id="fr_154"></span>[3](#fn_153) by which he places him in that
(direction).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:11">8:4:4:11</span></span>11.
Some, again, lay them down on the right

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (south <span
id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_154)) side, saying, 'We thus place these
signs of good fortune (pu*n*yâ lakshmî) on the right side:' whence he
who has a mark <span id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_155) (lakshman) on his
right side is said to have good luck (pu*n*ya-lakshmîka), and on the
left side in the case of a woman <span id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_156);
for the woman has her position on the left side (of the man): therefore
it is done thus. But let him place them in front; for where the head is
there are also the jaws and the tongue: and thus he places the signs of
good fortune at the head (or, in the mouth, mukhata*h*), whence they say
that he who has a (peculiar) mark in his mouth <span
id="fr_158"></span>[4](#fn_157) has good luck.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:4:12">8:4:4:12</span></span>12.
This, indeed, is Brahman's layer: inasmuch as they (the gods) laid down
the Brahman <span id="fr_159"></span>[5](#fn_158), therefore it is
Brahman's layer. It is Pra*g*âpati's layer: inasmuch as they laid down
Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_160"></span>[6](#fn_159), it is Pra*g*âpati's
layer. It is the *Ri*shis’ layer: inasmuch as they laid down the
*Ri*shis <span id="fr_161"></span>[7](#fn_160), it is the *Ri*shis’
layer. It is Vâyu's layer: inasmuch as they laid down Vâyu <span
id="fr_162"></span>[8](#fn_161), it is Vâyu's layer. It is the Stomas’
layer: inasmuch as they laid down the hymn-forms <span
id="fr_163"></span>[9](#fn_162), it is the Stomas’

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

layer. It is the layer of the vital airs: inasmuch as they laid down the
vital airs <span id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_163), it is the layer of the
vital airs. Hence, whatsoever one may know, that comes to be included in
the ancestry, in the kinship <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_164) of
this layer.--He then lays down two Lokamp*rin*âs (space-filling bricks)
in that corner <span id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_165): the significance
of these (will be explained) farther on <span
id="fr_167"></span>[4](#fn_166). He throws loose soil thereon: the
significance of this (will be explained) farther on <span
id="fr_168"></span>[5](#fn_167).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_146"></span>[77:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_147) That is, in the
laying down of these bricks. For the order followed in laying down the
bricks, see also [p. 67](sbe4316.htm#page_67), note
[2](sbe4316.htm#fn_139).

<span id="fn_147"></span>[78:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_148) The Sanskrit text,
as usual, makes our gerundial clause the principal clause: 'because he
lays them down in changing them.'

<span id="fn_148"></span>[78:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_149) On the south side a
Sp*ri*t representing the Saptada*s*a is placed immediately north of a
stoma (brick) representing the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a; and vice versa on the
north (left) side.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[79:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_150) Viz. the southern
one of the two on the south (right) side, and the northern one of the
two on the north (left) side.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[79:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_151) Atha yâ madhya
npadadhâti sa âtmâ, tâ reta*h*si*k*or velayopadadhâti--p*ri*sh*t*ayo vai
reta*h*si*k*au, madhyam u p*ri*shtayo--madhyato hy ayam âtmâ.--Here the
two clauses with 'vai' are inserted to substantiate the reason
introduced by 'hi.'

<span id="fn_151"></span>[80:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_152) Viz. the row of
fourteen bricks lying behind the two front bricks, and the row of six
bricks again placed behind these. It will he remembered that only the
northern one of the two front bricks was laid down at first, and that
then three others were placed in the different directions, after which
the row of fourteen was laid down behind the front one; and similarly
the laying down of the second front brick was separated from that of the
second row by the laying down of three other bricks in the different
quarters.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[80:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_153) In that case, the
two shank-sized bricks are laid down in the south-east corner, and the
rows of smaller bricks are placed to the north of them. See Kâty.
*S*rautas. XIV, I0, 4.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[80:3](sbe4318.htm#fr_154) See, for instance,
VI, 7, 3, 9 where the Ukhya Agni, representing the sun, is held up by
the Agni*k*it (sacrificer) in the south-easterly direction. The
south-east corner is sacred to Agni.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[81:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_155) In that case, they
are laid down north of the two bricks lying on the southern end of the
cross-spine, first the row of fourteen, and then, north of these, the
row of six.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[81:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_156) Yasya
dakshi*n*apâr*s*ve laksha*n*a*m* kâyasya vâ var*n*e vâ ki*m*tarâtmaka*m*
(?) bhavati; comm.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[81:3](sbe4318.htm#fr_157) This clause is
rather abrupt, and is, moreover, hardly logical. It is not clear whether
it is the two southern bricks that are compared with the woman, or the
bricks to be placed alongside of them on the north (left) side.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[81:4](sbe4318.htm#fr_158) Viz. such as an
excess of sharp teeth (incisors)--yasya mukhalaksha*n*a*m*
dakshi*n*ada*m*sh*t*râtirekâdi bhavati; comm.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[81:5](sbe4318.htm#fr_159) See [VIII, 4, 1,
3](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:3).

<span id="fn_159"></span>[81:6](sbe4318.htm#fr_160) See [VIII, 4, 1,
4](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:4).

<span id="fn_160"></span>[81:7](sbe4318.htm#fr_161) See [VIII, 4, 1,
5](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:5).

<span id="fn_161"></span>[81:8](sbe4318.htm#fr_162) See [VIII, 4, 1,
8](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:8).

<span id="fn_162"></span>[81:9](sbe4318.htm#fr_163) See [VIII, 4, 1,
4](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:4) seq.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[82:1](sbe4318.htm#fr_164) See [VIII, 4, 1,
5](sbe4315.htm#8:4:1:5).

<span id="fn_164"></span>[82:2](sbe4318.htm#fr_165) Or, in the
(symbolic) meaning. The literal reading of the clause is,--'Thereby this
layer of his becomes possessed of an ancestry and kinship (or mystic
sense).'

<span id="fn_165"></span>[82:3](sbe4318.htm#fr_166) Viz. in the
north-east corner, or on the left shoulder, whence, in two turns, the
available spaces of the altar are filled up. In laying down the
Lokamp*rin*âs of the first three layers he started from the south-east,
the south-west, and the north-west corners respectively. Cf. [p.
22](sbe4306.htm#page_22), note [1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73); [p.
41](sbe4310.htm#page_41), note [1](sbe4310.htm#fn_94); [p.
58](sbe4314.htm#page_58), note [1](sbe4314.htm#fn_127).

<span id="fn_166"></span>[82:4](sbe4318.htm#fr_167) See [VIII, 7, 2,
4](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:4) seq.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[82:5](sbe4318.htm#fr_168) See [VIII, 7, 3,
1](sbe4328.htm#8:7:3:1) seq.
