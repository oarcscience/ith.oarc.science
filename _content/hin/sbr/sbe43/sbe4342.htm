He yokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for those enclosing-sticks are fires&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_441"></A><A HREF="#fn_434"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: it is with fires he thus yokes the fire-altar.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:3">9:4:4:3</A></FONT></span>3. Having touched the middle enclosing-stick&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_442"></A><A HREF="#fn_435"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he mutters this formula (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XVIII, 51), 'The Fire I yoke with might, with ghee!'--might means strength: thus, 'The fire I yoke (furnish) with strength, with ghee;'--'the heavenly bird, great in vigour,'--for that (fire-altar) is indeed a heavenly bird, and great in vigour, in smoke&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_443"></A><A HREF="#fn_436"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>;--'Thereby we will go to the region of the bay, rising unto the light, beyond the highest firmament!'--The firmament, doubtless, is the heavenly world: thus, 'Thereby we will go to the region, of the bay (horse, the sun) mounting up to the heavenly world, beyond the highest firmament.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:4">9:4:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. Then on the southern (right) one, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XVIII, 52), 'By these never-decaying, feathered wings of thine wherewith thou repellest the demons, O Agni, may we fly to the world of the righteous whither the erst-born seers went of old!' he thereby alludes to those <I>Ri</I>shis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_444"></A><A HREF="#fn_437"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

XVIII, 53), 'The potent drop, the faithful eagle, the golden-winged bird, the active (bhura<I>n</I>yu),'--golden means immortal: thus, 'the immortal-winged bird, the bearer (bhart<I>ri</I>);'--'the mighty is seated in the firm seat: homage be to thee, injure me not!'--he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his own self.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:6">9:4:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. Now that middle formula is the body, and the two on both sides thereof are the wings (of the bird-shaped altar): hence these two allude to 'wings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_445"></A><A HREF="#fn_438"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' for these two are the wings.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:7">9:4:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. With three (formulas) he yokes it,--threefold is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus yokes him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:8">9:4:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. And when he has pressed the king (Soma) he offers in the fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_446"></A><A HREF="#fn_439"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. This, indeed, is that very rite of consecration (or pressing)--and by that he is now consecrated (or pressed)--which this (Sacrificer) is permitted to perform by those deities with whose permission he is consecrated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_447"></A><A HREF="#fn_440"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; for he alone becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, and not he whom (they do) not (allow to assume it). Now when he offers in the fire he thereby consecrates (anoints) Agni, and that divine body of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality. And he himself drinks (thereof): he thereby consecrates</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></p>  
<p>himself, and this self (body) of his, being consecrated by Soma, becomes consecrated by the nectar of immortality.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:9">9:4:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. Having offered in the fire (or, on the fire-altar), he drinks (Soma), for that (fire-altar) is his (the Sacrificer's) divine body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_441"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and this (Sacrificer's real body) is his human one; and the gods indeed were first, and afterwards men: therefore, having offered (Soma) in the fire, he drinks (thereof).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:10">9:4:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. Having now obtained the wish for (the accomplishment of) which he yokes it (the altar), he unyokes it when about to bespeak the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>iya stotra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,--for the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>iya is the heavenly world, and it is for the attainment of that (world) that he yokes it: thus (he unyokes it) after obtaining the wish for which he yoked it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:11">9:4:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. It is prior to the Stotra that he unyokes it:--were he to unyoke after the Stotra, he would pass beyond that world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and lose it; but when he unyokes prior to the Stotra, he unyokes forthwith after reaching the world of heaven.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:12">9:4:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. He unyokes it on the enclosing-sticks, for it</p>

<p><A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A></p>  
<p>is on the enclosing-sticks that he yokes it, and at whatever place (of the body) people yoke a horse there they also unyoke it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:13">9:4:4:13</A></FONT></span>13. Having touched it (the fire) at the two joints&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, he mutters these two formulas,--thus two formulas equal in power three enclosing-sticks,--with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XVIII, 54), 'The sky's head thou art, the earth's navel, [the essence of the waters and plants, the life of all, the ample refuge (?): homage be to the path!]' on the right, and with (55), 'On the head of the All dost thou keep standing, [in the (aerial) ocean is thy heart, in the waters thy life: bestow water, send the water-store (cloud),--from the sky, from the cloud, from the air, from the earth, favour us with rain!]' on the left (joint),--thus with two (verses) containing (the word) 'head,' for this, is indeed its head; and containing (the words) 'in the waters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>': that Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>iya doubtless is Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara's chant of praise, and water is (a means of) appeasing,--therefore (he touches them) with two (verses) containing (the words)--'the waters.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:14">9:4:4:14</A></FONT></span>14. With two (verses) he unyokes it,--two-footed is the Sacrificer, and Agni is the Sacrificer: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus unyokes him. With three (verses) he yokes,--that (makes) five,--the fire-altar consists of five layers, the year (of) five seasons, and Agni is</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_254"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 254</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great is this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:15">9:4:4:15</A></FONT></span>15. Now, some yoke it (the fire-altar) at a Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Atir&acirc;tra, and unyoke it at an Udayan&icirc;ya, saying, 'The unyoking, surely, is a certain form of completion, and why should we perform a form of completion prior to the completion (of the sacrifice)?' But let him not do this, for day by day this sacrifice is performed, and day by day it comes to completion; day by day he yokes that (altar) for the attainment of the heavenly world, and day by day he thereby attains the heavenly world: let him therefore yoke it day by day, and unyoke it day by day.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:16">9:4:4:16</A></FONT></span>16. And, indeed, it would be just as if, at the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya Atir&acirc;tra, after reciting the kindling-verses, he were to say, 'Hereafter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, at the Udayan&icirc;ya, I shall recite (them again)!' Let him therefore yoke (the altar) day by day, and unyoke it day by day.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9:4:4:17">9:4:4:17</A></FONT></span>17. And on this point, <I>S</I>&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ilya, indeed, having enjoined on the Ka&#7749;kat&icirc;yas the day-by-day performance,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_255"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 255</FONT></A></p>  
<p>went on his way, saying, 'Day by day they shall yoke for you, and day by day they shall unyoke!' Let him therefore yoke day by day, and unyoke day by day.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_442"></A><A HREF="sbe4342.htm#fr_449">252:2</A> The Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>iya (or Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya) stotra is the last and characteristic chant of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma mode of Soma-sacrifice, whence it is more properly called Agnish<I>t</I>oma-s&acirc;man; the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>iya, properly speaking, being the verses, S&acirc;ma-v. II, 53, 54, chanted to a particular tune, and generally (though not always) used for the closing chant of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_443"></A><A HREF="sbe4342.htm#fr_450">252:3</A> That is, because the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>iya marks, as it were, the end of the (Agnish<I>t</I>oma) Soma-sacrifice, and anything performed thereafter is, so to speak, outside the sacrifice, or beyond it. Katy. <I>S</I>r. XVIII, 6, 17 calls it &Acirc;gnim&acirc;ruta stotra, i.e. the chant belonging to the &Acirc;gnim&acirc;ruta-<I>s</I>astra (which has to be recited by the Hot<I>ri</I> after that chant); cf. part ii, p. 369 note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_444"></A><A HREF="sbe4342.htm#fr_451">253:1</A> That is, at the two points where the right (southern) and left (northern) enclosing-sticks (forming the two sides of the triangle, the apex of which lies east of the centre of the fire) meet the western enclosing-stick (as the base of the triangle).</P>

In the present case a special Soma-sacrifice of the Atir&acirc;tra type would seem to take its place, just as the Pavitra, an Agnish<I>t</I>oma Soma-sacrifice, at the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya, took the place of the ordinary Anv&acirc;rambha<I>n</I>&icirc;y&acirc; ish<I>t</I>i (or opening offering); see part iii, p. 42. In the same way there would apparently be a special Udayan&icirc;ya Soma-sacrifice; whilst our author would have the ceremonies of yoking and unyoking of the fire-altar performed on the very day (or days) of the Soma-sacrifice, that is to say, he would have the ordinary Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;yesh<I>t</I>i and Udayan&icirc;yesh<I>t</I>i performed as parts of the principal Soma-day (or days, if there are to be more than one).</P>
