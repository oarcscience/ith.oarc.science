### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:1">8:5:2:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down those *Kh*andasyâs <span id="fr_174"></span>[2](#fn_173)
(relating to the metres). For Pra*g*âpati, having freed himself from
evil, death, asked for food; hence, to this day, a sick man, when he
gets better, asks for food; and people have hope for him, thinking, 'He
asks for food, he will live.' The gods gave him that food, these
(bricks) relating to the metres; for the metres are cattle, and cattle
are food. They (the metres) pleased him, and inasmuch as they pleased
(*kh*and) him they are (called) metres (*kh*andas).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:2">8:5:2:2</span></span>2. He
lays them down by tens,--the Virâ*g* consists of ten syllables, and all
food is 'virâ*g*'

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (shining, or
ruling): he thus bestows all food on him. On all (four) sides he places
them: from all sides he thus bestows food on him.

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:7">8:5:2:7</span></span>7. Now of
those which he lays down in front, the first is the out (and
in)-breathing, the second the through-breathing, the third the
up-breathing, the fourth the up-breathing, the fifth the
through-breathing, the sixth the out-breathing, the seventh the
out-breathing, the eighth the through-breathing, the ninth the
up-breathing, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself:
this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on this
Virâ*g* (brick), made up of breath, lays down (bricks) extending both
backward and forward, for the breathings move both backward and forward.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:8">8:5:2:8</span></span>8. And of
those on the right (south) side, the first is Agni (fire), the second
Vâyu (the wind), the third Âditya (the sun), the fourth Âditya, the
fifth Vâyu, the sixth Agni, the seventh Agni, the eighth Vâyu, the ninth
Âditya, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this
same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on this Virâ*g*,
made up of deities, puts on (bricks) extending both hitherwards and
thitherwards, for those gods move both hitherwards and thitherwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:9">8:5:2:9</span></span>9. And of
those behind, the first is this (terrestrial) world, the second the air,
the third the sky, the fourth the sky, the fifth the air, the sixth this
world, the seventh this world, the eighth the air, the ninth the sky,
and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer himself: this same
Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on that Virâ*g* made up
of the worlds, lays down (bricks) extending both hitherwards and
thitherwards;--whence these worlds extend both hitherwards and
thitherwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:10">8:5:2:10</span></span>10. And
of those on the left (north) side, the first is the summer, the second
the rainy season, the

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

third the winter, the fourth the winter, the fifth the rainy season, the
sixth the summer, the seventh the summer, the eighth the rainy season,
the ninth the winter, and the tenth, in this case, is the Sacrificer
himself: this same Sacrificer, being raised and firmly established on
that Virâ*g*, made up of the seasons, lays down (bricks) extending both
hitherwards and thitherwards;--whence those seasons move both
hitherwards and thitherwards <span id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_176).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:11">8:5:2:11</span></span>11.
And, again, those which he lays down in front are the vital airs. There
are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the
front part, for these vital airs are in the front part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:12">8:5:2:12</span></span>12. And
those on the right (south) side are the deities,--Agni, the Earth, Vâyu,
the Air, Âditya, the Sky, *K*andra (the moon), the Stars, Food, and
Water.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:13">8:5:2:13</span></span>13. And
those behind are the regions (quarters),--four regions, four
intermediate regions, the upper region, and this (earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:14">8:5:2:14</span></span>14. And
those on the left (north) side are the months,--two spring-months, two
summer-months, two months of the rainy season, two autumn-months, and
two winter-months.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:15">8:5:2:15</span></span>15.
And, again, the first ten are this (terrestrial) world, the second the
air, the third the sky. By the first set of ten they (the gods) ascended
this (earth), by the second the air, by the third the sky; and in like
manner does the Sacrificer now, by the first set of ten, ascend this
(earth), by the second the air, and by the third the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:16">8:5:2:16</span></span>16.
This, then, is, as it were, an ascent away from

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

here; but this (earth) is the foundation: the gods came back to this
(earth), the foundation; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now come
back to this (earth), the foundation. And that last set of ten is this
world: hence, even as (takes place) that start from the first set of
ten, so from the last; for this is the same,--those two sets of ten (the
first and last) are this (terrestrial) world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:2:17">8:5:2:17</span></span>17. Now
these are forty bricks and forty formulas,--that makes eighty, and
eighty (a*s*îti) means food <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_177): thus
whatever he now says that he makes to be food, a*s*îti, and gives it
him, and thereby gratifies him (Agni).
