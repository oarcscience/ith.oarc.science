### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:1">8:1:4:1</span></span>1. Now
some lay down (these bricks) so as to be in contact with the (gold) man,
for he is the vital air, and him these (bricks) sustain; and because
they sustain (bh*ri*) the vital air (prâ*n*a), therefore they are called
'Prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h*.' Let him not do so: the vital air is indeed the
same as that gold man, but this body of his extends to as far here as
this fire (altar) has been marked out. Hence to whatever

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

limb of his these (breath-holders) were not to reach, that limb of his
the vital air would not reach; and, to be sure, to whatever limb the
vital air does not reach, that either dries up or withers away: let him
therefore lay down these (bricks) so as to be in contact with the
enclosing stones; and by those which he lays down in the middle this
body of his is filled up, and they at least are not separated from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:2">8:1:4:2</span></span>2. Here
now they say, 'Whereas in (the formulas) "This one, in front, the
existent--this one, on the right, the all-worker--this one, behind, the
all-embracer--this, on the left, heaven--this one, above, the
mind"--they (these bricks) are defined as exactly opposite the quarters,
why, then, does he lay down these (bricks) in sidelong places <span
id="fr_68"></span>[1](#fn_67)?' Well, the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h* are the
vital airs; and if he were to place them exactly opposite the quarters,
then this breath would only pass forward and backward; but inasmuch as
he now lays down these (bricks) thus defined in sidelong places,
therefore this breath, whilst being a backward and forward one, passes
sideways along all the limbs and the whole body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:3">8:1:4:3</span></span>3. Now
that Agni (the altar) is an animal, and (as such) he is even now made up
whole and entire,--those (bricks) which he lays down in front are his
fore-feet, and those behind are his thighs; and those

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

which he places in the middle are that body of his. He places these in
the region of the two reta*h*si*k* (bricks), for the reta*h*si*k* are
the ribs, and the ribs are the middle, and that body is in the middle
(of the limbs). He places them all round, for that body extends all
round.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:4">8:1:4:4</span></span>4. Here
now they say, 'Whereas in the first (four) sets he lays down a single
stoma and a single p*ri*sh*th*a each time, why, then, does he lay down
here (in the centre) two stomas and two p*ri*sh*th*as?' Well, this
(central set) is his (Agni's) body: he thus makes the body (trunk) the
best, the largest, the most vigorous of limbs <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_68); whence that body is the best, the
largest, and most vigorous of limbs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:5">8:1:4:5</span></span>5. Here
now they say, 'How does that Agni of his become made up whole and entire
in brick after brick?'--Well, the formula is the marrow, the brick the
bone, the settling the flesh, the sûdadohas the skins, the formula of
the purîsha (fillings of earth) the hair, and the purîsha the food: and
thus indeed that Agni of his becomes made up whole and entire in brick
after brick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:6">8:1:4:6</span></span>6. That
Agni is possessed of all vital power: verily, whosoever knows that Agni
to be possessed of all vital power (âyus), attains his full measure of
life (âyus).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:7">8:1:4:7</span></span>7. Now,
then, as to the contraction and expansion (of the body). Now some cause
the built (altar) in this way <span id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_69) to be
possessed of (the power of) contraction and expansion: that Agni indeed
is an animal;

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

and when an animal contracts and expands its limbs, it develops strength
by them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:8">8:1:4:8</span></span>8.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXVII, 45\] 'Thou art Sa*m*vatsara,--thou art
Parivatsara,--thou art Idâvatsara,--thou art Idvatsara,--thou art
Vatsara,--May thy dawns prosper <span
id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_70)!--may thy days and nights prosper!--may
thy half-months prosper!--may thy months prosper!--may thy seasons
prosper!--may thy year prosper!--For going and coming contract and
expand thyself!--Of Eagle-build thou art: by that deity, Aṅgiras-like,
lie thou steady <span id="fr_72"></span>[2](#fn_71)!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:9">8:1:4:9</span></span>9.
*S*â*t*yâyani also once said, 'Some one heard (the sound) <span
id="fr_73"></span>[3](#fn_72) of the cracking wings of the (altar)-when
touched with this (formula): let him therefore by all means touch it
therewith!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:1:4:10">8:1:4:10</span></span>10. And
Svar*g*it Nâgna*g*ita or Nagna*g*it, the Gândhâra, once said,
'Contraction and expansion surely are the breath, for in whatever part
of the body there is breath that it both contracts and expands; let him
breathe upon it from outside when completely built: he thereby lays
breath, the (power of) contraction and expansion, into it, and so it
contracts and expands.' But indeed what he there said as to that
contraction and expansion, it was only one of the princely order who
said it; and assuredly were they to breathe upon it from outside a
hundred

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

times, or a thousand times, they could not lay breath into it. Whatever
breath there is in the (main) body that alone is the breath: hence when
he lays down the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ta*h* (breath-holders), he thereby lays
breath, the (power of) contraction and expansion, into it; and so it
contracts and expands. He then lays down two Lokamp*rin*â (bricks) in
that corner <span id="fr_74"></span>[1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73): the meaning
of them (will be explained) further on <span
id="fr_75"></span>[2](sbe4307.htm#fn_74). He throws loose earth (on the
layer): the meaning of this (will be explained) further on <span
id="fr_76"></span>[3](sbe4307.htm#fn_75).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_67"></span>[19:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_68) That is to say, why
does he not place them at the ends of the spines, but at the corners of
the (square) body, i.e. in places intermediate between the lines running
in the direction of the points of the compass? When speaking of the
regions, or quarters, it should be borne in mind that they also include
a fifth direction, viz. the perpendicular or vertical line (both upward
and downward) at any given point of the plane.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[20:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_69) Or,--better, larger,
and more vigorous than the limbs.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[20:2](sbe4306.htm#fr_70) Viz. by touching, or
stroking along, the layer of the altar, and muttering the subsequent
formulas.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[21:1](sbe4306.htm#fr_71) Or, perhaps, 'may the
dawns chime in (fit in) with thee!'

<span id="fn_71"></span>[21:2](sbe4306.htm#fr_72) For this last part of
the formula ('by that deity,' &c.), the so-called settling-formula, see
part iii, p. 307, note 1.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[21:3](sbe4306.htm#fr_73) Harisvâmin (Ind. Off.
MS. 657) seems to supply '*s*abdam;' the sound of the cracking being
taken as a sign of the powerful effect of the formula. Unfortunately,
however, the MS. of the commentary is hopelessly incorrect.
