There are three, for the head is threefold. He places them on the forepart (of the altar), for the head (of the animal or bird) is in front.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:8">8:6:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. <I>G</I>agat&icirc;s are the hips; at whatever distance from the naturally-perforated (central) brick he places the Trish<I>t</I>ubhs in front, at the same distance from it he places the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;s behind; for that naturally-perforated brick is this vital air in the middle (of the body), and as far from that vital air as the chest is in front, so far are the hips behind.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:9">8:6:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. Anush<I>t</I>ubhs are the thighs: he places them close to the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;s, and thereby places the thighs close to the hips.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:10">8:6:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;s are the ribs, Kakubhs the breast-bone.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:11">8:6:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. Ush<I>n</I>ihs are the neck: he places them close to the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;s, and thereby places the neck close to the head.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Pa&#7749;ktis, it is because the wings are of Pa&#7749;kti (fivefold) nature. He places them sideways, for these wings are sideways. Whatever metre is larger that he places on the right side: he thus makes the right half of the animal the stronger, and hence the right side of an animal is the stronger.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:13">8:6:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. An Ati<I>kh</I>andas is the belly; for the metres are cattle, and cattle are food, and food is (what fills) the belly, because it is the belly that eats the food: hence when the belly gets the food, it becomes eaten and used up. And inasmuch as this (brick) eats (atti) the metres (<I>kh</I>andas), the cattle, it is called Atti<I>kh</I>andas, for Atti<I>kh</I>andas is really what is mystically called Ati<I>kh</I>andas; for the gods love the mystic.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:14">8:6:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. A (brick) covered with loose soil is the womb. These two he lays close to each other, for the belly and the womb are close to each other. They are connected with loose soil, for loose soil means flesh, and both the belly and the womb are connected with flesh. The former is an Ati<I>kh</I>andas, the latter a soil-bedded one (pur&icirc;shavat&icirc;), for the belly is higher, and the womb lower.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:15">8:6:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. He places them so as to extend eastwards, for in an easterly direction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> this Agni (fire-altar) is built; and, moreover, in one moving forward, both the belly and the womb are moving forward. Outside the Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s (he places them), for the Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s are the heart, and the heart is highest, then (comes) the belly, then the womb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:16">8:6:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. He places them south of the naturally-perforated (brick). Now, in the first layer, he places</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A></p>  
<p>both the belly and the womb north of the naturally-perforated one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for that naturally-perforated one, indeed, is what this vital air in the middle (of the body) is: he thus places the belly and the womb on both sides of that (central) vital air, and hence the belly and the womb are on both sides of that central vital air.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:17">8:6:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. The Dvipad&acirc;s are the feet (the stand);--and as to its being Dvipad&acirc;s (verses of two feet), it is because the feet are a pair. There are three (such verses), for a stand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (tripod) is threefold. He lays them down at the back, for the feet are at the back (of the body).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:18">8:6:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. That body of his (Agni) is well-made;--and, indeed, for whomsoever they thus make that body of his so as to be well-made, he becomes possessed of that body of his as a well-made one; but for whomsoever they make it otherwise than that, for him they make that body of his so as to be ill-made, and he becomes possessed of an ill-made body.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:2:19">8:6:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. It is with reference to this that these two s&acirc;ma-nidhanas (finales of s&acirc;man-hymns) are uttered,--'The light (is) in the highest heaven of the gods,' and, 'The gods (are) in the highest heaven of the</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A></p>  
<p>light;'--for when on that occasion the gods were entering (heaven), Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati was the last to enter: that is why he says, 'The light (is) in the highest heaven of the gods.' And as to why he says, 'The gods (are) in the highest heaven of light,'--the light, doubtless, is this Agni (the fire-altar), and it is on his highest layer that all the gods have thus entered: this is why he says, 'The gods are in the highest heaven of light.'</p>

Each of the ten sets consists of a central brick of full size (a foot square) placed on one of the two spines, and flanked on the two sides not in contact with the spines by two half-size bricks, viz.:--1. g&acirc;yatr&icirc; at the east end of the 'spine'; 2. trish<I>t</I>ubh on the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> range (joining the <A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A> G&acirc;rhapatya on the front, or east, side); 3. <I>g</I>agat&icirc;, on the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> range (joining the G&acirc;rhapatya on the west side); 4. anush<I>t</I>ubh, immediately behind (west) of the preceding set; 5. b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;, immediately in front (east) of the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc; range (on which the ring of Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s lies); 6. ush<I>n</I>ih, immediately behind (west of) the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;s; 7. kakubh, immediately in front of the b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; bricks; 8. pa&#7749;kti, at the right (south) end of the 'cross-spine'; 9. padapa&#7749;kti, at the left (north) end of the 'cross-spine'; 10. the single ati<I>kh</I>andas, immediately in front (east) of the fifth Asapatn&acirc; (see <A HREF="sbe4319.htm#page_84">p. 84</A>, note <A HREF="sbe4319.htm#fn_169">1</A>); 11.

<P><A NAME="fn_202"></A><A HREF="sbe4324.htm#fr_203">110:3</A> That is, the so-called Great Litany (mahad uktham) recited, by the Hot<I>ri</I>, in response to the Mah&acirc;vrata-s&acirc;man, or Chant of the Great Rite, at the midday service of the last but one day--the so-called Mah&acirc;vrata day--of the sacrificial session called 'Gav&acirc;m ayanam,' or 'cows&#8217; walk.' The Great Litany consists of numerous <A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A> hymns, and some detached verses and prose formulas; the whole matter recited being stated to amount to as many syllables as would make up a thousand B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verses (of thirty-six syllables each)--or 36,000 syllables in all. From an analysis I have made of the Mahad uktham (or B<I>ri</I>had uktham, as it is also called) as contained in MS. Ind. Off. 1729 D, I find it very difficult to check the accuracy of this statement; my own calculation yielding somewhere about 37,200 syllables. By leaving out of account the prose formulas, as well as certain repetitions, this gross amount might, however, be reduced to something approximating the stated number of syllables; and, indeed, the calculation was probably not meant to be a strictly accurate one. Cf. II, 3, 3, 19, 20 (where read Litany, instead of Chant), part ii, p. 430. See also <a href="sbe4330.htm#9:1:1:44">IX, I, 1, 44</A>; <a href="sbe4337.htm#9:3:3:19">3, 3, 19</A>; <a href="sbe4344.htm#9:5:2:12">5, 2, 12</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_203"></A><A HREF="sbe4324.htm#fr_204">111:1</A> The three Kakubh verses (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XV, 38-40) consist each of three p&acirc;das, of eight, twelve, and eight syllables respectively, making together twenty-eight syllables. In muttering these verses, whilst laying down the Kakubh bricks, he is to omit four syllables from the middle p&acirc;da of each verse (so as to make it equal to the other two p&acirc;das), and mutter the words thus omitted at the beginning of the verse (XV, 47) used in laying down the Ati<I>kh</I>andas brick. The syllables omitted make up complete words in each case, viz. 'bhadr&acirc; r&acirc;ti<I>h</I>' at the beginning of the middle p&acirc;da of the first verse, 'v<I>ri</I>trat&ucirc;rye' at the end of the middle p&acirc;da of the second verse, and 'ava sthir&acirc;' at the beginning of the second p&acirc;da of the third verse. The remaining portions of the Kakubh verses consist each of twenty-four syllables, or a G&acirc;yatr&icirc; verse. The references here made to the different parts of the Mahad uktham are not quite clear, and seem to point to a somewhat different arrangement of that <I>s</I>astra from that known from the Aitarey&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka and the <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana-s&ucirc;tra. The head, indeed, consists of G&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses, viz. <I>Ri</I>g-veda I, 7., either the whole, or, according to some, only certain verses of it; the first three, or nine, verses also forming the opening triplet, or triplets, of the Mah&acirc;vrata-s&acirc;man, the chanting of which precedes the recitation of the Great Litany.--For the trunk (&acirc;tman) consisting of trish<I>t</I>ubh verses, see <A HREF="#page_113">p. 113</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_206">1</A>. The Pa&#7749;kti verses, on the other hand, said to form the wings, would seem to be <I>Ri</I>g-veda VIII, 40 (consisting of mah&acirc;pa&#7749;ktis), <A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A> which in the Aitareya arrangement forms the thighs, whilst S&acirc;&#7749;kh&acirc;yana makes it part of the tail; and the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;s here referred to as constituting the spine would seem to be X, 50, which immediately follows the hymn just referred to, and is not otherwise identified with any special part of the body. The MSS. of Harisv&acirc;min's commentary are unfortunately hopelessly corrupt in this place.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_204"></A><A HREF="sbe4324.htm#fr_205">112:1</A> The Great Litany begins with seven sets of hymns and verses, meant symbolically to represent certain parts of Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's bird-shaped body which the ceremony is intended to reconstruct, viz. the trunk, neck, head, the roots (sinews) of the wings, the right and left wings, and the tail, between each two of which the so-called S&ucirc;dadohas verse (<I>Ri</I>g-veda VIII, 69, 3), meant to represent the vital air pervading the body, is inserted, as it also is between (and before) the succeeding parts. In the first place there follow three eighties of triplets (or, 3 sets of 240 verses each) in the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; and Ush<I>n</I>ih metres respectively. Then comes the Va<I>s</I>a hymn representing the belly, and finally a course of recitations (beginning with hymn VIII, 40) forming the thighs. For the part which the number eighty plays in the Agni<I>k</I>ayana ceremony, see Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 167. The term for 'eighty,' viz. 'a<I>s</I>&icirc;ti,' gives rise to a constant etymological play. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on Aitarey&acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka I, 4, 3, 1, takes it in the sense of 'food' (cf. above, <a href="sbe4320.htm#8:5:2:17">VIII, 5, 2, 17</A>); whilst the &Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka itself takes it in that of 'obtainment':--yad ev&acirc;smin loke ya<I>s</I>o, yan maho, yan mithuna<I>m</I>, yad ann&acirc;dya<I>m</I>, y&acirc; &#8217;pa<I>k</I>itis tad a<I>s</I>navai, tad &acirc;pnav&acirc;ni, tad avaru<I>n</I>adhai, tan me &#8217;sad iti.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_205"></A><A HREF="sbe4324.htm#fr_206">112:2</A> This is the hymn <I>Ri</I>g-veda VIII, 46, ascribed to Va<I>s</I>a A<I>s</I>vya, and remarkable for the variety of metres in which the different verses are composed. In the Aitareya recension of the Mahad uktham (which is followed in the MS. of this <I>s</I>astra referred to in the preceding notes) only the first twenty verses are recited, but verse 15 being divided into two verses, a dvipad&acirc; and an ekapad&acirc;, they are thus made to consist of twenty-one verses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_206"></A><A HREF="sbe4324.htm#fr_207">113:1</A> The Nada-verse, <I>Ri</I>g-veda VIII, 69, 2 (in the ush<I>n</I>ih metre) deriving its name from its first word 'nadam,' plays a peculiar part in the recitation of the Great Litany. The opening set of recitations, representing the trunk, consists of twenty-two trish<I>t</I>ubh verses; these are recited in such a way that after each p&acirc;da (or quarter of a verse) one of the four p&acirc;das of the Nada-verse is inserted. The chief object of this insertion seems to be a metrical one, viz. that of making each two p&acirc;das (trish<I>t</I>ubh = eleven, and ush<I>n</I>ih = seven syllables) to form half a b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verse (eighteen syllables), the whole Litany being computed by b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verses. Moreover, of v. 3 of the first Trish<I>t</I>ubh hymn of this set (<I>Ri</I>g-veda X, 120) only the first two p&acirc;das are recited at this stage (whilst the remaining two are recited in different places later on), and this half-verse is followed by a b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; and a satob<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; p&acirc;da (VII, 32, 23 c, and VI, 46, 2 c), after which the recitation proceeds with verse 4 of the first hymn. This seems to account for one of the two half-verses here referred to, whilst the other would seem to be VII, 20, 1 a, b, recited later on in the <I>s</I>astra. Cf. Prof. F. Max M&uuml;ller's translation of Aitarey&acirc;r., Sacred Books of the East, vol. i, p. 181 seqq.--The Aindr&acirc;gna hymn is VIII, 40, 1-9; 11; 12, being the first hymn of the portion representing the thighs. It consists of ten mah&acirc;pa&#7749;kti verses (6 &times; 8 syllables)--each of which is split up into two G&acirc;yatr&icirc; verses (3 &times; 8 syllables)--and one trish<I>t</I>ubh verse.--The chief anush<I>t</I>ubh verses are those of <I>Ri</I>g-veda I, 11, 1-8, which are recited in a peculiar way (towards the end of the <I>s</I>astra), the last p&acirc;da of each verse interchanging with the first p&acirc;da of the next verse.</P>

For the threefold nature of the head, as consisting of skin, bone, and brain, see XII, 2, 4, 9.</P>
