### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:1">8:5:4:1</span></span>1. He
lays them down on the range of the Ashâ*dh*â; for the Ashâ*dh*â is
speech, and this (set of bricks <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_178))
is the essence (of food): he thus lays into speech the essence of food;
whence it is through (the channel of) speech that one distinguishes the
essence of food for all the limbs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:2">8:5:4:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why (on the range) of the Ashâ*dh*â;--the Ashâ*dh*â,
doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabhâgâs are yonder sun: he thus
establishes yonder sun upon this earth as a firm foundation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:3">8:5:4:3</span></span>3. And,
again, why (on that) of the Ashâ*dh*â;--the Ashâ*dh*â, doubtless, is
this (earth), and the Stomabhâgâs are the heart: he thus lays into this
(earth) the heart, the mind: whence on this (earth) one thinks with the
heart, with the mind. He lays them down on every side: he thus places
the heart, the mind everywhere; whence everywhere on this (earth) one
thinks with the heart, with the mind. And, moreover, these (bricks) are
lucky signs: he places them on all sides; whence they say of him who has
a (lucky) sign (lakshman) on every (or any) side that he has good luck
(pu*n*yalakshmîka).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:4">8:5:4:4</span></span>4. He
then covers them with loose soil; for loose soil (purîsha) means food,
and this (set of bricks) is the essence (of food): he thus makes it
invisible, for invisible, as it were, is the essence of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:5">8:5:4:5</span></span>5. And,
again, as to why (he covers it) with loose

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

soil;--loose soil, doubtless, means food, and this (set of bricks) is
the essence: he thus joins and unites the food and its essence.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:6">8:5:4:6</span></span>6. And,
again, as to why with loose soil;--the Stomabhâgâs are the heart, and
the loose soil is the pericardium: he thus encloses the heart in the
pericardium.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:7">8:5:4:7</span></span>7. And,
again, as to why with loose soil;--this fire-altar is the year, and by
means of the soil-coverings of the layers he divides it: those first
four layers are four seasons. And having laid down the Stomabhâgâs, he
throws loose soil thereon: that is the fifth layer, that is the fifth
season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:8">8:5:4:8</span></span>8. Here
now they say, 'Since the other layers conclude with Lokamp*rin*âs
(space-filling bricks), and no space-filler is laid down in this
(layer): what, then, is the space-filler therein?' The space-filler,
surely, is yonder sun, and this layer is he; and this is of itself <span
id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_179) a space-filling layer. And what there is
above this (layer) up to the covering of soil that is the sixth layer,
that is the sixth season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:9">8:5:4:9</span></span>9. He
then throws down the loose soil. Thereon he lays down the Vikar*n*î and
the naturally-perforated (brick); he bestrews them with chips of gold,
and places the fire thereon: that is the seventh layer, that is the
seventh season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:10">8:5:4:10</span></span>10.
But, indeed, there are only six of them; for as to the Vikar*n*î and the
Svayam-ât*rinn*â, they belong to the sixth layer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:11">8:5:4:11</span></span>11.
And, indeed, there are only five of them,--on the other (layers) he
throws down the loose soil with a prayer, and here (he does so)
silently: in that

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

respect this is not a layer. And the other layers end with
space-fillers, but here he lays down no space-filler: in that respect
also this is not a layer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:5:4:12">8:5:4:12</span></span>12.
And, indeed, there are only three of them,--the first layer is this very
(terrestrial) world; and the uppermost (layer) is the sky; and those
three (intermediate layers) are the air, for there is, as it were, only
one air here: thus (there are) three, or five, or six, or seven of them.
