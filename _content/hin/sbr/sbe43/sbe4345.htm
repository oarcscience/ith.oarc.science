And that Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati who became relaxed is this very Fire-altar which here is built; and those joints of his, the days and nights, which became relaxed are no other than the bricks;--thus, when he lays down these (in the layers of the altar), he thereby restores to him those joints of his, the days and nights, which had become relaxed: and thus</p>

<p>it is even in this (building of the altar) that this Ya<I>g</I>us is built up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_529"></A><A HREF="#fn_521"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and secured (for Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati).</p>

And that vital fluid (essence) of his which flowed upwards (became) the Great Litany: it is in quest of that vital fluid that (the priests) go by means of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> and S&acirc;man. And when the Ya<I>g</I>us marches in front in this (quest)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_530"></A><A HREF="#fn_522"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, it is in order to fetch something that that (Veda) goes--even as (one might say), 'That one thing there is mine, I will fetch it,' so does that Ya<I>g</I>us go in front (or forward). That (vital fluid) they obtain in the course of a year&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_531"></A><A HREF="#fn_523"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

The Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> puts the vital fluid into it by means of the (s&acirc;man of the) Great Rite (mah&acirc;vrata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_533"></A><A HREF="#fn_525"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>); but, indeed, the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (s&acirc;man of the) Great Rite is (equivalent to) all these (other) s&acirc;mans (hymn-tunes): it is thus by means of all the hymn-tunes that he puts the vital fluid therein. The Hot<I>ri</I> puts the vital fluid therein by means of the Great Litany; but, indeed, the Great Litany is the same as all these ri<I>k</I> (hymn-verses)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_534"></A><A HREF="#fn_526"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: it is thus by means of all the hymn-verses that he puts the vital fluid into it (the Soma-cup).</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:1:1:6">10:1:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. When those (Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s) chant (the stotra), and when he (the Hot<I>ri</I>) recites (the <I>s</I>astra) afterwards, then he (the Adhvaryu) offers that (vital fluid, in the form of Soma) unto him (Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) at the Vasha<I>t</I>-call; and thus this vital fluid enters him. For, indeed, they do not see it to be the Great Rite that lies there being praised, nor the Great Litany, but it is Agni alone they see; for Agni is the self (body), and thus those two, the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I> and the S&acirc;man, enter him in the form of the vital fluid; and thus they both enter (join) the Ya<I>g</I>us.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:1:1:7">10:1:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. Now, that Agni (fire-altar) consists of pairs--the first layer and the second, and the third and fourth; and of the fifth layer the fire which is placed on the built (altar) is the mate. And, indeed, this body consists of pairs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:1:1:8">10:1:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. The thumbs (and great toes, 'a&#7749;gush<I>th</I>a,' m.) are males, and the fingers and toes ('a&#7749;guli,' f.) females; the ears ('kar<I>n</I>a' m.) are males, and the eyebrows ('bhr&ucirc;,' f.) females; the lips ('osh<I>th</I>a,' m.) are males, and the nostrils ('n&acirc;sik&acirc;,' f.) females; the teeth ('danta,' m.) are males, and the tongue ('<I>g</I>ihv&acirc;,' f.) is a female: indeed the whole (body) consists of pairs, and with this body, consisting of pairs, that (vital fluid) enters this Agni (the fire-altar), consisting of pairs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_535"></A><A HREF="#fn_527"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:1:1:9">10:1:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. This, then, is the entering therein;--even thus, indeed, he (Agni) consists of pairs&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_536"></A><A HREF="#fn_528"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; but in this</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_285"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 285</FONT></A></p>  
<p>way also he consists of pairs:--the fire-altar here built up is no other than this speech, for with speech it is built up; and the fire which is placed on the built (altar) is the breath; and the breath ('pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a,' m.) is the male, the mate, of speech ('v&acirc;<I>k</I>,' f.). And, indeed, this body is speech; and the breath which is in the body is its mate: with this mated body that (vital fluid) thus enters into the mated Agni.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:1:1:10">10:1:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. This also is the entering therein;--there is indeed no fear of him (Agni) being without offspring to whosoever thus knows these two, the body and Agni, to be a pair; but, indeed, this body is food, as is said by the <I>Ri</I>shi (<I>Ri</I>g-veda X, 107, 7), 'The Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc; winneth food which is our own self (breath).'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:1:1:11">10:1:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now, this food, when eaten, becomes of two kinds,--that part of it which is immortal (remains) above the navel: by the upward vital airs it moves upwards and enters the air; but that part of it which is mortal tends to move away: it passes beyond the navel, and, having become twofold, enters this (earth), as urine and faeces. Now that which enters this (earth) enters the fire-altar&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_537"></A><A HREF="sbe4346.htm#fn_529"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> built here; and that which enters the air enters that fire which is placed on the built (altar). This also is the entering therein.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_524"></A><A HREF="sbe4345.htm#fr_532">282:4</A> The particular cup of Soma here referred to is the Mah&acirc;vrat&icirc;ya-graha, the special cup of the Great Rite; cf. <a href="sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:12">X, 4, 1, 12</A> seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_525"></A><A HREF="sbe4345.htm#fr_533">282:5</A> The central feature of the Mah&acirc;vrata consists in the chanting, at the mid-day service--as the Hot<I>ri</I>'s P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-stotra--of the so-called Mah&acirc;vrata-s&acirc;man. It consists of five different parts which,--like those of which the Mahad uktham, recited after it, is <A NAME="page_283"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 283</FONT></A> composed,--are considered as representing different parts of Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's body, viz.: I. G&acirc;yatra-s&acirc;man, representing the head; it is chanted in the triv<I>ri</I>t-stoma (nine-versed hymn-form) and consists of the triplets, S&acirc;ma-v. II, 146-8 (= <I>Ri</I>g-veda I, 7, 1-3: indram id g&acirc;thino b<I>ri</I>hat), II, 263-5 (indro dadh&icirc;ko asthabhir), and II, 800-2 (ud ghed abhi <I>s</I>rut&acirc;magham); though, according to others, the S&acirc;ma-triplets corresponding to <I>Ri</I>g-veda I, 7, I-9 may be chanted instead. 2. Rathantara-s&acirc;man (S&acirc;ma-v. II, 30-I), representing the right wing, chanted in the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a-stoma, or fifteen-versed form. 3. B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man (II, 159-60), the left wing, in the Saptada<I>s</I>a-stoma, or seventeen-versed form. 4. Bhadra-s&acirc;man (on II, 460-2; Of. Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 402), the tail, in the Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, or twenty-one-versed form. 5. R&acirc;<I>g</I>ana- s&acirc;man (on II, 833-5; cf. Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 449), the body (&acirc;tman), in the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>avi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a-stoma, or twenty-five-versed form; instead of this the V&acirc;madevya-s&acirc;man (on II, 32-4) may be chanted in the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>anidhana form (Calc. ed., vol. v, p. 45I).--The chanting of this Stotra is preceded by the singing of thirteen s&acirc;mans, called parim&acirc;da<I>h</I> (see <a href="sbe4346.htm#10:1:2:8">X, 1, 2, 8</A>), followed by certain ceremonies--buckling armour on a nobleman, driving in a sunwise direction round the sacrificial ground, shooting arrows at two ox-hides, beating of drums, &amp;c.--apparently symbolising the driving off of evil spirits from the sacrifice, or a combat for the possession of (the light of) the sun. The chanting itself is, according to some authorities, performed by the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s, whilst, according to others, all the priests (except the Hot<I>ri</I>, for whom the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a acts), as well as the G<I>ri</I>hapati, or Sacrificer, take part in turn in the singing of the s&acirc;mans; the Prastot<I>ri</I> and Pratihart<I>ri</I>; assistants of the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>; joining in with the successive performers in the Nidhanas, or finales.</P>
