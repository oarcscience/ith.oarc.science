For this second layer is that one which the A<I>s</I>vins at that time laid down for them (the gods); and by laying it down they became everything here whatsoever there is here.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:2">8:2:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. The gods spake, 'The A<I>s</I>vins have become everything here: think ye upon this as to how we also may share in it!' They said, 'Meditate ye (<I>k</I>it)!' whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, Seek ye a layer (<I>k</I>iti)! seek ye in what way we also may share in it!' whilst meditating, they saw these Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc; (All-gods&#8217;) bricks.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:3">8:2:2:3</A></FONT></span>3. They said, 'The A<I>s</I>vins have become everything here: with the help of the A<I>s</I>vins let us lay down (bricks) along with the A<I>s</I>vins&#8217; layer!' With the help of the A<I>s</I>vins they accordingly laid down (bricks) along with the A<I>s</I>vins&#8217; layer, whence they call this the A<I>s</I>vins&#8217; layer. Hence the end of these (bricks) is the same as that of the former ones; for they laid them down with the help of the A<I>s</I>vins along with the A<I>s</I>vins&#8217; layer.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:4">8:2:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. And, again, as to why he lays down the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> All-gods&#8217; (bricks). These indeed are those same All-gods who saw this second layer, and who came nigh with that life-sap: it is them he thereby bestows, that is, all these creatures. He lays them down in the range of the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I>; for the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> are these two (heaven and earth): within these two (worlds) he thus places creatures; whence there are creatures within these two (worlds). He places (bricks) on every side: he thus places creatures everywhere, whence there are creatures everywhere. He places them alongside of the regional ones&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_86"></A><A HREF="#fn_85"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: he thus places creatures in the regions (quarters); whence there are creatures in all the (four) quarters.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:5">8:2:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. And, again, as to why he lays down the All-gods&#8217; (bricks). When Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati had become relaxed, all creatures went forth from the midst of him, from that birth-place of theirs. When that (central part) of his body had been restored, they entered him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:6">8:2:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Now the Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati who become relaxed is this very Agni (fire-altar) that is now being built up; and the creatures who went forth from the midst of him are these same All-gods&#8217; bricks; and when he lays these down, he causes those creatures, which went forth from the midst of him, to enter him. In the range of the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> (he places the Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc; bricks), for the Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> are the ribs, and the ribs</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are the middle: he thus causes the creatures to enter him in the very middle. He places them on all sides: on all sides he thus causes the creatures to enter him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:7">8:2:2:7</A></FONT></span>7. And, again, as to why he lays down the Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc; (bricks). At that time, when that (part) of his body had been restored, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati desired, 'May I create creatures, may I be reproduced!' Having entered into union with the seasons, the waters, the vital airs, the year, and the A<I>s</I>vins, he produced these creatures; and in like manner does this Sacrificer, by entering into union with those deities, now produce these creatures. Hence with all (of these bricks, the word) sa<I>g</I>ush ('in union with') recurs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:8">8:2:2:8</A></FONT></span>8. [He lays down the Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc; bricks, with V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIV, 7], 'In union with the seasons,'--he thereby produced the seasons, and having entered into union with the seasons he produced (creatures);--'in union with the ranges,'--the ranges, doubtless, are the waters, for by water everything is ranged (distributed or produced) here: having entered into union with the waters he produced (creatures);--'in union with the gods,'--he thereby produced the gods,--those who are called 'gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_87"></A><A HREF="#fn_86"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;'--'in union with the life-sustaining gods,'--the life-sustaining gods, doubtless, are the vital airs, for by the vital airs everything living here is sustained; or, the life-sustaining gods are the metres, for by the metres (sacred writ) everything living is sustained here; having entered into union with the vital airs he produced creatures;--</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> 'for Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara,'--Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara ('belonging to all men'), doubtless, is the year: having entered into union with the year he produced creatures;--'May the A<I>s</I>vins, the Adhvaryus, settle thee here!'--having entered into union with the A<I>s</I>vins he produced creatures.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:2:2:9">8:2:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. 'In union with the Vasus,' he says on the right side: he thereby produced the Vasus;--'in union with the Rudras,' he says at the back: he thereby produced the Rudras;--'in union with the &Acirc;dityas,' he says on the left side: he thereby produced the &Acirc;dityas;--'in union with the All-gods,' he says upwards: he thereby produced the All-gods. These (bricks) have the same beginning and end, but are different in the middle: as to their having the same beginning and end, it is because having become united with the deities in front and behind, he produced creatures; and as to their being different in the middle, it is that each time he produced different creatures from within him.</p>

They were, moreover, placed in the second space (or at the distance of half a foot) from the two spines, see <A HREF="sbe4307.htm#page_23">p. 23</A>, note <A HREF="sbe4307.htm#fn_76">1</A>. The five Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc;s are then placed alongside of the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vin&icirc;s, so as to fill up the 'first spaces,' that is to say, to lie on the spines themselves; each of the two half-foot bricks laid down in the south being, as it were, halved by the spine.</P>
