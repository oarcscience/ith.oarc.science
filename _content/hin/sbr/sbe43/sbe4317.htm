These, then, are seventeen bricks he lays down,--the year, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, is seventeenfold, he is the progenitor: it is thus by this seventeenfold year, by Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the progenitor, that he caused these creatures to be generated. And what he generated, he created; and inasmuch as he created (s<I>ri</I><I>g</I>), therefore they are called creations (s<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i). Having created them, he made them enter his own self: and in like manner does the Sacrificer now cause these creatures to be generated by that seventeenfold year, by Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the progenitor; and having created them, he makes them enter his own self&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.

Whilst the bricks of the south side are further specified as consisting of a brick, a foot square, lying on the cross-spine, being flanked on both sides by half-foot bricks, and these again by square bricks; no particulars are given regarding the other sides. Most likely, however, as indicated in the accompanying sketch, four square bricks, two on each side of the cross-spine, are to form the left (north) side, whilst the front and hind sides are to consist of two <A NAME="page_72"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 72</FONT></A> square bricks lying north and south of the spine, and flanked by half-foot bricks.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_144"></A><A HREF="sbe4317.htm#fr_145">72:2</A> Professor Delbr&uuml;ck, in his Altindische Syntax, pp. 136, 257, 265, takes 'stoshy&acirc;mahe' in this passage in a passive sense--'by whom shall we be praised?' I think, however, that this is a mistake, and Harisv&acirc;min's commentary certainly takes it in the same sense as I have done; and, indeed, the paragraphs which follow seem to me to make it quite clear that no other interpretation is possible. Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is about to perform the 's<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>is,' i. e. the creation of living beings by means of sacrifice (his own self). He requires the assistance of the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as (vital airs) in order to produce creatures endowed with breath, and he also appeals to (the three most prominent of) them in their capacity as <I>Ri</I>shis (VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.) to officiate as his (Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>) priests. They ask, 'Wherewith shall we sing praises?' and he answers, 'With me and with your own selves.' The wherewith,' according to Harisv&acirc;min, refers both to the 'stotriy&acirc;' verses to be used, and to the deities of the s<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i-stotras. That the former, at all events, is indeed the case, a glance at the subsequent paragraphs shows, where the stotriy&acirc;s are identified with the vital airs, and, when their number (ten) becomes exhausted, with parts of the year (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati), and of his (the Sacrificer's, or Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) body. As regards the deities whom Harisv&acirc;min considers to be likewise implied, this also is by no means improbable, though I must confess that it did not occur to me, before I looked at the commentary. In the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>'s text-books, the chanting of stotras is usually interpreted as symbolising the production of 'food' (cf., for instance, T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. I, 3, 6, 'anna<I>m</I> karishy&acirc;my anna<I>m</I> pravishy&acirc;my anna<I>m</I> <I>g</I>anayishy&acirc;mi'), whilst here it seems identified with the production of life, or breath itself (cf. ib. 5, 'b<I>ri</I>haspatis tv&acirc; yunaktu devebhya<I>h</I> pr&acirc;<I>n</I>&acirc;ya &amp;c.'); and, accordingly, in Sat. Br. X, 3, 1, 1, 7, the principal vital air, the breath proper, is called 'pra<I>g</I>anana-pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a.'</P>
