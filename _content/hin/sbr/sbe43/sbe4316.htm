'Let lordship be unto us!' said others. Having bestowed a share on some, and lordship on others, he freed all beings from evil, from death; and inasmuch as he freed (sp<I>ri</I>) them, therefore (those bricks are called) 'Sp<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I>.' And in like manner does this Sacrificer, by bestowing a share on some, and lordship on others, now free all beings from evil, from death; and hence (the word) 'sp<I>ri</I>tam (freed)' recurs with all of them.</p>

These, then, are ten bricks he lays down,--the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> consists of ten syllables, and Agni is Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> (wide-shining); there are ten regions, and Agni is the regions; there are ten vital airs, and Agni is the vital airs: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus frees all these creatures from evil, from death.</p>

S. XIV, 27), 'Saha and Sahasya, the two winter-seasons!' These are the names of those two, it is with their names he thus lays them down. There are two such bricks, for a season consists of two months. Only once he settles them: he thus makes (the two months) one season.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:2:15">8:4:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. And as to why he places these two (bricks) in this (layer),--this Agni (fire-altar) is the year, and the year is these worlds: what part thereof is above the air, and below the sky, that is this fourth layer, and that is the winter-season thereof; and when he places these two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati-Agni, the year and fire-altar) what part of his body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in this (layer).</p>

And, again, as to why he places these two in this (layer),--this Agni is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year: what (part) of him there is above the waist, and below the head, that is this fourth layer, and that is the winter-season of him (or, of it, the year). And when he places these two in this (layer), he thereby restores to him what part of his body these two (constitute). This is why he places these two in this (layer).</p>

Similarly two bricks, a foot square, are placed on the 'cross-spine' immediately north of the two stoma-bricks lying there.

If 'yava' and 'ayava,' in the sense of the bright and dark fortnights, are really genuine terms, it is more likely that they are derived from yu, 'to keep off,'--the bright half of the moon being looked upon as capable of averting evil spirits, and the dark half as the reverse of this.</P>
