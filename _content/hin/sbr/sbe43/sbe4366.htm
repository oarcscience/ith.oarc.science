<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:5:1:1">10:5:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. The mystic import of this Fire-altar, doubtless, is Speech; for it is with speech that it is built: with the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, the Ya<I>g</I>us and the S&acirc;man as the divine (speech); and when he (the Adhvaryu) speaks with human speech, 'Do ye this! do ye that!' then also it (the altar) is built therewith.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:5:1:2">10:5:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. Now, this speech is threefold--the <I>Ri</I>k-verses, the Ya<I>g</I>us-formulas, and the S&acirc;man-tunes;--thereby the Fire-altar is threefold, inasmuch as it is built with that triad. Even thus, then, it is threefold; but in this respect also it is threefold, inasmuch as three kinds of bricks are put into it--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names; and these limbs of men also are of three kinds--those with masculine names, those with feminine names, and those with neuter names.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:5:1:3">10:5:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. This body (of the altar), indeed, is threefold; and with this threefold body he obtains the threefold divine Am<I>ri</I>ta (nectar, immortality). Now all these (bricks) are called 'ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc; (f.),' not 'ish<I>t</I>aka<I>h</I> (m.),' nor 'ish<I>t</I>akam (n.):' thus (they are called) after the form of speech (v&acirc;<I>k</I>, f.), for everything here is speech--whether feminine (female), masculine (male), or neuter--for by speech everything here is obtained. Therefore he 'settles' all (the bricks)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_725"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with, 'A&#7749;giras-like lie thou steady (dhruv&acirc;, f.)!' not with, 'A&#7749;giras-like lie thou steady (dhruva<I>h</I>, m.)!' or with, 'A&#7749;giras-like lie thou steady (dhruvam, n.)!' for it is that Speech he is constructing.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:5:1:4">10:5:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. Now, this speech is yonder sun, and this (Agni, the Fire-altar) is Death: hence whatsoever is on this side of the sun all that is field by Death; and he who builds it (the Fire-altar) on this side thereof, builds it as one held by Death, and he surrenders his own self unto Death; but he who builds it thereabove, conquers recurring Death, for by his knowledge that (altar) of his is built thereabove.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:5:1:5">10:5:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. This speech, indeed, is threefold--the <I>Ri</I>k-verses, the Ya<I>g</I>us-formulas, and the S&acirc;man-tunes the <I>Ri</I>k-verses are the orb, the S&acirc;man-tunes the light, and the Ya<I>g</I>us-formulas the man (in the sun); and that immortal element, the shining light, is this lotus-leaf&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_726"></A><A HREF="#fn_714"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: thus, when he builds up the Fire-altar</p>

<p><A NAME="page_366"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 366</FONT></A></p>  
<p>after laying down the lotus-leaf, it is on that immortal element that he builds for himself a body consisting of the <I>Ri</I>k, the Ya<I>g</I>us, and the S&acirc;man; and he becomes immortal.</p>
