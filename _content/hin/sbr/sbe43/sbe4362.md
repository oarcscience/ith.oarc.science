### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:1">10:4:2:1</span></span>1.
Verily, Pra*g*âpati, the year, is Agni, and King Soma, the moon. He
himself, indeed, proclaimed (taught) his own self to Ya*gñ*ava*k*as
Râ*g*astambâyana, saying, 'As many lights as there are of mine, so many
are my bricks.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:2">10:4:2:2</span></span>2. Now
in this Pra*g*âpati, the year, there are seven hundred and twenty days
and nights, his lights, (being) those bricks; three hundred and sixty

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

enclosing-stones <span id="fr_690"></span>[1](#fn_679), and three
hundred and sixty bricks with (special) formulas. This Pra*g*âpati, the
year, has created all existing things, both what breathes and the
breathless, both gods and men. Having created all existing things, he
felt like one emptied out, and was afraid of death.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:3">10:4:2:3</span></span>3. He
bethought himself, 'How can I get these beings back into my body? how
can I put them back into my body? how can I be again the body of all
these beings?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:4">10:4:2:4</span></span>4. He
divided his body into two; there were three hundred and sixty bricks in
the one, and as many in the other: he did trot succeed <span
id="fr_691"></span>[2](#fn_680).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:5">10:4:2:5</span></span>5. He
made himself three bodies,--in each of them there were three eighties of
bricks I he did not succeed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:6">10:4:2:6</span></span>6. He
made himself four bodies of a hundred and eighty bricks each: he did not
succeed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:7">10:4:2:7</span></span>7. He
made himself five bodies,--in each of them there were a hundred and
forty-four bricks: he did not succeed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:8">10:4:2:8</span></span>8. He
made himself six bodies of a hundred and twenty bricks each: he did not
succeed. He did not develop himself sevenfold <span
id="fr_692"></span>[3](#fn_681).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:9">10:4:2:9</span></span>9. He
made himself eight bodies of ninety bricks each: he did not succeed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:10">10:4:2:10</span></span>10.
He made himself nine bodies of eighty bricks each: he did not succeed.

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:11">10:4:2:11</span></span>11.
He made himself ten bodies of seventy-two bricks each: he did not
succeed. He did not develop elevenfold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:12">10:4:2:12</span></span>12.
He made himself twelve bodies of sixty bricks each: he did not succeed.
He did not develop either thirteenfold or fourteenfold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:13">10:4:2:13</span></span>13.
He made himself fifteen bodies of forty-eight bricks each: he did not
succeed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:14">10:4:2:14</span></span>14.
He made himself sixteen bodies of forty-five bricks each: he did not
succeed. He did not develop seventeenfold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:15">10:4:2:15</span></span>15.
He made himself eighteen bodies of forty bricks each: he did not
succeed. He did not develop nineteenfold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:16">10:4:2:16</span></span>16.
He made himself twenty bodies of thirty-six bricks each: he did not
succeed. He did not develop either twenty-one-fold, or twenty-two-fold,
or twenty-three-fold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:17">10:4:2:17</span></span>17.
He made himself twenty-four bodies of thirty bricks each. There he
stopped, at the fifteenth; and because he stopped at the fifteenth
arrangement <span id="fr_693"></span>[1](#fn_682) there are fifteen
forms of the waxing, and fifteen of the waning (moon).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:18">10:4:2:18</span></span>18.
And because he made himself twenty-four bodies, therefore the year
consists of twenty-four half-months. With these twenty-four bodies of
thirty bricks each he had not developed (sufficiently). He saw the
fifteen parts of the day, the muhûrtas <span
id="fr_694"></span>[2](#fn_683),

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

as forms for his body, as space-fillers (Lokamp*rin*âs <span
id="fr_695"></span>[1](#fn_684)), as well as fifteen of the night; and
inasmuch as they straightway (muhu) save (trai), they are (called)
'muhûrtâ*h*'; and inasmuch as, whilst being small, they fill (pûr) these
worlds (or spaces, 'loka') they are (called) 'lokamp*rin*â*h*.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:19">10:4:2:19</span></span>19.
That one (the sun) bakes everything here, by means of the days and
nights, the half-moons, the months, the seasons, and the year; and this
(Agni, the fire) bakes what is baked by that one: 'A baker of the baked
(he is),' said Bhâradvâ*g*a of Agni; 'for he bakes what has been baked
by that (sun).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:20">10:4:2:20</span></span>20.
In the year these (muhûrtas) amounted to ten thousand and eight hundred:
he stopped at the ten thousand and eight hundred.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:21">10:4:2:21</span></span>21.
He then looked round over all existing things, and beheld all existing
things in the threefold lore (the Veda), for therein is the body of all
metres, of all stomas, of all vital airs, and of all the gods: this,
indeed, exists, for it is immortal, and what is immortal exists; and
this (contains also) that which is mortal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:22">10:4:2:22</span></span>22.
Pra*g*âpati bethought himself, 'Truly, all existing things are in the
threefold lore: well, then, I will construct for myself a body so as to
contain the whole threefold lore.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:23">10:4:2:23</span></span>23.
He arranged the *Ri*k-verses into twelve thousand of B*ri*hatîs <span
id="fr_696"></span>[2](#fn_685), for of that extent are the

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

verses created by Pra*g*âpati. At-the thirtieth arrangement they came to
an end in the Paṅktis; and because it was at the thirtieth arrangement
that they came to an end, there are thirty nights in the month; and
because it was in the Paṅktis, therefore Pra*g*âpati is 'pâṅkta'
(fivefold) <span id="fr_697"></span>[1](#fn_686). There are one
hundred-and-eight hundred <span id="fr_698"></span>[2](#fn_687) Paṅktis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:24">10:4:2:24</span></span>24.
He then arranged the two other Vedas into twelve thousand
B*ri*hatîs,--eight (thousand) of the Ya*g*us (formulas), and four of the
Sâman (hymns)--for of that extent is what was created by Pra*g*âpati in
these two Vedas. At the thirtieth arrangement these two came to an end
in the Paṅktis; and because it was at the thirtieth arrangement that
they came to an end, there are thirty nights in the month; and because
it was in the Paṅktis, therefore Pra*g*âpati is 'pâṅkta.' There were one
hundred-and-eight hundred <span id="fr_699"></span>[2](#fn_687) Paṅktis.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:25">10:4:2:25</span></span>25.
All the three Vedas amounted to ten thousand eight hundred eighties (of
syllables) <span id="fr_700"></span>[3](#fn_688); muhûrta by muhûrta he
gained a fourscore (of syllables), and muhûrta by muhûrta a fourscore
was completed <span id="fr_701"></span>[4](#fn_689).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:26">10:4:2:26</span></span>26.
Into these three worlds, (in the form of) the

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

fire-pan <span id="fr_702"></span>[1](#fn_690), he (Pra*g*âpati) poured,
as seed into the womb, his own self made up of the metres, stomas, vital
airs, and deities. In the course of a half-moon the first body was made
up, in a further (half-moon) the next (body), in a further one the
next,--in a year he is made up whole and complete.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:27">10:4:2:27</span></span>27.
Whenever he laid down an enclosing-stone <span
id="fr_703"></span>[2](#fn_691), he laid down a night, and along with
that fifteen muhûrtas, and along with the muhûrtas fifteen eighties (of
syllables of the sacred texts) <span id="fr_704"></span>[3](#fn_692).
And whenever he laid down a brick with a formula (ya*g*ushmatî), he laid
down a day <span id="fr_705"></span>[4](#fn_693), and along with that
fifteen muhûrtas, and along with the muhûrtas fifteen eighties (of
syllables). In this manner he put this threefold lore into his own self,
and made it his own; and in this very (performance) he became the body
of all existing things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital
airs, and deities; and having become composed of all that, he ascended
upwards; and he who thus ascended is that moon yonder.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:28">10:4:2:28</span></span>28.
He who shines yonder (the sun) is his foundation,

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (for) over him he
was built up <span id="fr_706"></span>[1](#fn_694), on him he was built
up: from out of his own self he thus fashioned him, from out of his own
self he generated him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:29">10:4:2:29</span></span>29.
Now when he (the Sacrificer), being about to build an altar, undergoes
the initiation-rite,--even as Pra*g*âpati poured his own self, as seed,
into the fire-pan as the womb,--so does he pour into the fire-pan, as
seed into the womb, his own self composed of the metres, stomas, vital
airs, and deities. In the course of a half-moon, his first body is made
up, in a further (half-moon) the next (body), in a further one the
next,--in a year he is made up whole and complete.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:30">10:4:2:30</span></span>30.
And whenever he lays down an enclosing-stone, he lays down a night, and
along with that fifteen muhûrtas, and along with the muhûrtas fifteen
eighties (of syllables). And whenever he lays down a Ya*g*ushmatî
(brick), he lays down a day, and along with that fifteen muhûrtas, and
along with the muhûrtas fifteen eighties (of syllables of the sacred
texts). In this manner he puts this threefold lore into his own self,
and makes it his own; and in this very (performance) he becomes the body
of all existing things, (a body) composed of the metres, stomas, vital
airs, and deities; and having become composed of all that, he ascends
upwards.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:2:31">10:4:2:31</span></span>31.
And he who shines yonder is his foundation, for over him he is built up,
on him he is built up: from out of his own self he thus fashions him,
from out of his own self he generates him. And when

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

he who knows this departs from this world, then he passes into that body
composed of the metres, stomas, vital airs, and deities; and verily
having become composed of all that, he who, knowing this performs this
sacrificial work, or he who even knows it, ascends upwards.

'success';--(svaya*m* teshâm âtmâ bhavitum) asamartho<sup>ऽ</sup>bhavat.

Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[351:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_693) Literally, shifting
(about of the bricks of the altar), development.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[351:2](sbe4362.htm#fr_694) The day and night
consists of thirty muhûrtas, a muhûrta being thus equal to about
forty-eight minutes or four-fifths of an hour.

<span id="fn_684"></span>[352:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_695) The Lokamp*rin*â
bricks contained in the whole fire-altar amount to as many as there are
muhûrtas in the year, viz. 10,800; see [X, 4, 3,
20](sbe4363.htm#10:4:3:20).

<span id="fn_685"></span>[352:2](sbe4362.htm#fr_696) The B*ri*hatî
verse, consisting of 36 syllables, this calculation makes the hymns of
the *Ri*g-veda to consist of 36 × 12,000= 432,000 syllables.

<span id="fn_686"></span>[353:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_697) The Paṅkti consists
of five pâdas (feet) of eight syllables each.

<span id="fn_687"></span>[353:2](sbe4362.htm#fr_699) That is to say,
10,800 Paṅktis, which, as the Paṅkti verse has 40 syllables, again
amount to 432,000 syllables.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[353:3](sbe4362.htm#fr_700) The three Vedas,
according to the calculations in paragraphs 23 and 24, contain 2 ×
432,000 = 864,000 syllables, which is equal to 80 × 10,800. On the
predilection to calculate by four-scores, see [p.
112](sbe4324.htm#page_112), note [1](sbe4324.htm#fn_204).

<span id="fn_689"></span>[353:4](sbe4362.htm#fr_701) That is, within the
year, for the year has 360 × 30 = 10,800 muhûrtas, which is just the
amount of eighties of which the three Vedas were said to consist. I do
not see how any division of the 'muhûrta' itself into eighty parts (as
supposed by Professor Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 92, note 1) can be
implied here.

<span id="fn_690"></span>[354:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_702) On the construction
of the Ukhâ, as representing the universe, see VI, 5, 2 seq.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[354:2](sbe4362.htm#fr_703) The number of
'pari*s*rits' by which the great altar is enclosed is only 261; but to
these are usually added those of the other brick-built hearths, viz. the
Gârhapatya (21) and the eight Dhish*n*yas (78),--the whole amounting to
360 enclosing-stones, or one for each day (or night) in the year.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[354:3](sbe4362.htm#fr_704) According to
[paragraph 25](sbe4362.htm#10:4:2:25), a fourscore of syllables was
completed in each muhûrta; and day and night consist of fifteen muhûrtas
each.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[354:4](sbe4362.htm#fr_705) See [IX, 4, 3,
6](sbe4341.htm#9:4:3:6), where the number of Ya*g*ushmatî bricks is said
to be equal to that of the pari*s*rits, or enclosing-stones--with,
however, 35 (36) added for the intercalary month, hence altogether 395
(396); cf. [X, 4, 3,
14](sbe4363.htm#10:4:3:14)-[19](sbe4363.htm#10:4:3:19).

<span id="fn_694"></span>[355:1](sbe4362.htm#fr_706) Viz. inasmuch as
the round gold plate, representing the sun, was laid down in the centre
of the altar-site, before the first layer was built. Sâya*n*a.
