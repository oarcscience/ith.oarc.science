<p>airs, it is the vital airs he thereby bestows upon (Agni). He lays them down in the first layer;--that which is the first layer is the forepart (ground-part) of Agni: it is thus in front that he puts (into Agni) the vital airs, whence there are (in creatures) these (orifices of the) vital airs in front.</p>

He lays them down by ten and ten, for there are ten vital airs; and even though 'ten-ten' may mean many, times, here they mean only ten. Five times he puts on ten (bricks) each time; for it is those five (kinds of sacrificial) animals he bestows, and there are ten vital airs in each .animal: upon all of them he thus bestows the vital airs. He lays down (the bricks) so as not to be separated from the animals: he thus bestows vital airs not separated from the animals. He lays them down on every side: on every side he thus bestows on them (orifices of) the vital airs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:1:1:3">8:1:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. And again why he lays down the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I>. From Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, when relaxed (by producing creatures), the vital airs departed. To them, having become deities, he spake, 'Come ye to me, return ye unto me that wherewith ye have gone out of me!'--'Well then, create thou that food which we will await here looking on!'--'Well then, let us both create!'--'So be it!'--So both the final airs and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati created that food, these Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>t (bricks).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_34"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_34">1:1</A> The construction of the first of the five layers of the altar which, as far as the special bricks are concerned, is now nearing its completion, may be briefly recapitulated here. The altar (agni) is constructed in the form of a bird, the body (&acirc;tman) of which consists of a square, usually measuring four man's lengths, or forty feet (Indian=c. 30 ft. Engl.) on each side. The ground of the 'body' having been ploughed, watered, and sown with seeds of all kinds of herbs, a square mound, the so-called uttaravedi, measuring a yuga (yoke= 7 ft. Ind.) on each side, is thrown up in the middle of the 'body,' and the whole of the latter then made level with it. In the centre of the 'body' thus raised, where the two 'spines'--connecting the middle of each of the four sides of the square with that of the, opposite side--meet, the priest puts down a lotus-leaf, and thereon the gold plate (a symbol of the sun) which the Sacrificer wore round his neck during the time of initiation. On this plate he then lays a small gold figure of a man (representing Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, as well as the Sacrificer himself), so as to lie on his back with the head towards the east; and beside him he places two offering-spoons, one on each side, filled with ghee and sour curds <A NAME="page_2"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 2</FONT></A> respectively. Upon the man he then places a brick with naturally-formed holes in it (or a porous stone), a so-called Svayam-&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc; (self-perforated one), of which there are three in the altar, viz. in the centre of the first, third, and fifth layers, supposed to represent the earth, air, and sky respectively, and by their holes to allow the Sacrificer (in effigy) to breathe, and ultimately to pass through on his way to the eternal abodes. On this stone he lays down a plant of d&ucirc;rv&acirc; grass--with the root lying on the brick, and the twigs hanging down--meant to represent vegetation on earth, and food for the Sacrificer. Thereupon he puts down in front (east) of the central stone, on the 'spine,' a Dviya<I>g</I>us brick; in front of that, on both sides of the spine, two Reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I>; then in front of them, one Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis; then again two <I>Ri</I>tavy&acirc;<I>h</I>; and finally the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;, representing the Sacrificer's consecrated consort. These bricks, each of which is a pada (foot, Ind.) square, occupy nearly one-third of the line from the centre to the middle of the front side of the 'body' of the altar. South and north of the Ash&acirc;<I>dh</I>&acirc;, leaving the space of two bricks, he places a live tortoise, facing the gold man, and a wooden mortar and pestle respectively. On the mortar he places the ukh&acirc;, or fire-pan, filled with sand and milk; and thereon the heads of the five victims, after chips of gold have been thrust into their mouths, nostrils, eyes, and ears. At each of the four ends of the two spines' he then puts down five Apasy&acirc;<I>h</I> bricks, the middle one lying on the spine itself, with two on each side of it. The last set of five bricks, those hid down at the north (or left) end of the 'cross-spine,' are also called <I>Kh</I>andasy&acirc;<I>h</I> by the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. He now proceeds to lay down the Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I>, meant to represent the orifices of the vital airs, in five sets of ten bricks each. The first four sets are placed on the four diagonals connecting the centre with the four corners of the body of the altar, beginning from the corner (? or, according to some, optionally from the centre), in the order S.E., N.W., S.W., N.E.; the fifth set being then laid down round the central stone at the distance (or, on the range) of the reta<I>h</I>si<I>k</I> bricks. See the diagram at <A HREF="sbe4305.htm#img_01700">p. 17</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_35"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_35">3:1</A> Whilst standing in front (east) of the altar, he puts down the first set of ten bricks on the line from the south-west corner (or right shoulder) of the altar towards the centre. The formulas with which each set of ten bricks are deposited are spread over three paragraphs, the first of which gives that of the first brick, the second those for two to eight, the third for the last two.</P>

It should also be borne in mind that the altar (agni) is built in form of an eagle flying towards the east, or front.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_37"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_37">4:1</A> See VII, 5, 1, 7, 'The breath is taken in from the front backwards.'--In the text 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>o h&acirc;gnir bh&ucirc;tv&acirc; purast&acirc;t tasthau,' I take 'pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a<I>h</I>' to be the predicate.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_38"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_38">4:2</A> At VII, 4, 1, 16, the vital air is called Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's (Agni's) pleasing form (or part).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_39"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_39">4:3</A> For a similar connection of the East with the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, the Rathantara, the Triv<I>ri</I>t, the Spring, and the Brahman (priesthood) see V, 4, I, 3, (part iii, p. 91).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_40"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_40">4:4</A> The G&acirc;yatra-s&acirc;man is the simplest, and by far the most common of all hymn-tunes. It is especially used in connection with the triv<I>ri</I>t-stoma, or nine-versed hymn, and is invariably employed for the Bahishpavam&acirc;na-stotra. It is also the tune of the first triplet both of the M&acirc;dhyandina and &Acirc;rbhava-pavam&acirc;na; as well as for all the four &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya-stotras.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_41"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_41">4:5</A> See part ii, pp. 238 seqq., where this soma-cup is repeatedly connected with the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;. Though its pressing is performed by three turns of eight, eleven, and twelve beatings respectively, representing the three chief metres, it is expressly stated (IV, 1, 1, 14) <A NAME="page_5"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 5</FONT></A> that he who is desirous of obtaining holiness, should press eight times at each turn.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_42"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_42">5:1</A> For this and the other P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>a-s&acirc;mans see part iii, introd. pp. xvi, xx seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_43"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_43">5:2</A> In Taitt. S. IV, 3, 2, 1, this formula is connected with the preceding one,--'from the Rathantara (was produced) the <I>Ri</I>shi Vasish<I>th</I>a.' Similarly in the corresponding passages of the subsequent sets of bricks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_44"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_44">5:3</A> The s&acirc;dana, or settling, consists in the formula, 'By that deity, A&#7749;giras-like, lie thou steady!' being pronounced over the bricks. See VI, 1, 2, 28.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_45"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_45">5:4</A> For the s&ucirc;dadohas verse, the pronunciation of which, together with the 'settling,' constitutes the two necessary (nitya) ceremonies, see part iii, p. 307.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_46"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_46">6:1</A> Whilst standing on the right (south) side of the altar he lays down the third set of ten Pr&acirc;<I>n</I>abh<I>ri</I>ta<I>h</I>, viz. those on the diagonal from the south-west corner (or right thigh) towards the centre. Whilst, in the actual performance, these bricks are only laid down after those referred to in paragraphs 1-3 of the next Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the author, in his explanation of the formulas, follows the course of the sun from left to right.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_47"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_47">6:2</A> For a similar combination of the south with the Trish<I>t</I>ubh metre, the B<I>ri</I>hat-s&acirc;man, the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a-stoma, the summer season, and the Kshatra, see V, 4, 1, 4 (part iii, p. 91).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_48"></A><A HREF="sbe4303.htm#fr_48">6:3</A> Sv&acirc;ra-s&acirc;man is called a chanted verse which has no special concluding nidhana, or finale, but in which the svarita (circumflex), or first rising then falling pitch (e<I>g</I>., f-g-f) of the final vowel, takes the place of the finale; whence 'sv&acirc;ra' is often explained by 'svaranidhana,' i.e. having the svara (svarita) for its nidhana. See <A NAME="page_7"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 7</FONT></A> Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>. Br. IX, 3, 11, where a sv&acirc;ra-s&acirc;man is prescribed in case the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>s have previously committed an excess in their chanting. The last tristich of the M&acirc;dhyandina-pavam&acirc;nastotra of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma, the Au<I>s</I>ana-s&acirc;man (to S&acirc;ma-v., vol. ii, pp. 27-29), is chanted in this way, probably in order to make good the excess committed in the preceding triplet, the Yaudh&acirc;<I>g</I>aya (ii, pp. 25, 26), in which each verse is chanted with three nidhanas, one at the end, and two inserted inside the s&acirc;man. L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. <I>S</I>rautas. VI, 9, 6, the sv&acirc;ra-s&acirc;mans thus treated are called 'pad&acirc;nusv&acirc;r&acirc;<I>n</I>i;' whilst those with which the musical syllables 'h&acirc;-i' are used with a similar effect, are called 'h&acirc;ik&acirc;rasv&acirc;r&acirc;<I>n</I>i.' As an instance of the former, the Au<I>s</I>ana (S&acirc;ma-v., vol. iii, p. 8r) is adduced, and of the latter the V&acirc;madevya (iii, p. 89). It is not only the final syllable of a s&acirc;man, however, that may be modulated in this way, but also that of a musical section of the s&acirc;man; cf. Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>. Br. X, 12, 2, where the Udg&icirc;tha is to be so treated to make up for the preceding Prast&acirc;va, chanted without a Stobha. Sacrificial calls such as the 'Sv&acirc;h&acirc;' and 'Vasha<I>t</I>' are also modulated in this way,' ib. VII, 3, 26; XI, 5, 26.</P>
