### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:1">8:3:2:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down a Vi*s*va*g*yotis (all-light brick). Now the middle
Vi*s*va*g*yotis is Vâyu <span id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_113), for Vâyu
(the wind) is all the light in the air-world: it is Vâyu he thus places
therein. He places it so as not to be separated from the regional
(bricks): he thus places Vâyu in the regions, and hence there is wind in
all the regions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:2">8:3:2:2</span></span>2. And,
again, as to why he lays down the Vi*s*va*g*yotis,--the Vi*s*va*g*yotis,
doubtless, is offspring (or creatures), for offspring indeed is all the
light: he thus lays generative power (into that world). He places it so
as not to be separated from the regional ones <span
id="fr_115"></span>[2](#fn_114): he thus places creatures in the
regions, and hence there are creatures in all the regions.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:3">8:3:2:3</span></span>3. \[He
lays it down, with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 14\], 'May Vi*s*vakarman settle
thee!' for Vi*s*vakarman saw this third layer <span
id="fr_116"></span>[3](#fn_115);--'on the back of the air, thee the
brilliant one!' for on the back of the air that brilliant Vâyu indeed
is.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:4">8:3:2:4</span></span>4. 'For
all up-breathing, down-breathing, through-breathing,'--for the
Vi*s*va*g*yotis is breath,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

and breath indeed is (necessary) for this entire universe;--'give all
the light!'--that is, 'give the whole light;'--'Vâyu is thine
over-lord,'--it is Vâyu he thus makes the over-lord of that (layer and
the air-world). Having settled it, he pronounces the Sûdadohas over it:
the significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:5">8:3:2:5</span></span>5. He
then lays down two Ritavyâ (seasonal <span
id="fr_117"></span>[1](#fn_116) bricks);--the two seasonal ones being
the same as the seasons, it is the seasons he thus places
therein.\[Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 15\], 'Nabha and Nabhasya, the two rainy
seasons,' these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by their
names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a season
consists of two months. He settles them once only: he thereby makes (the
two months) one season. He places them on avakâ-plants and covers them

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

with avakâ-plants <span id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_117); for
avakâ-plants mean water he thus bestows water on that season, whence it
rains most abundantly in that season.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:6">8:3:2:6</span></span>6. Then
the two upper ones, with (Vâ*g*. S. XIV, I6), 'Isha and Ûr*g*a, the two
autumnal seasons,'--these are the names of those two (bricks): it is by
their names he thus lays them down. There are two (such) bricks, for a
season consists of two months. He settles them only once: he thereby
makes (the two months) one season. He places them on avakâ-plants, for
the avakâ-plants mean water: he thus bestows water before that season,
whence it rains before that season. He does not cover them afterwards,
whence it does not likewise rain after (that season).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:7">8:3:2:7</span></span>7. And as
to why he places these (four bricks) in this (layer),--this fire-altar
is the year, and the year is the same as these worlds, and the
middlemost layer is the air (-world) thereof; and the rainy season and
autumn are the air (-world) thereof: hence when he places them in this
(layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni) what (part) of his body these
(formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:8">8:3:2:8</span></span>8. And,
again, as to why he places them in this (layer),--this Agni (the
fire-altar) is Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the year. Now the
middlemost layer is the middle of this (altar), and the rainy season and
the autumn are the middle of that (year): hence when he places them in
this (layer), he thereby restores to him (Agni-Pra*g*âpati) what part of
his

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

body these (formed),--this is why he places them in this (layer).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:9">8:3:2:9</span></span>9. There
are here four seasonal (bricks) he lays down in the middlemost layer;
and two in each of the other layers,--animals (cattle) are four-footed,
and the middlemost layer is the air: he thus places animals in the air,
and hence there are animals that have their abode in the air.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:10">8:3:2:10</span></span>10.
And, again, why there are four,--animals are four-footed, and animals
are food; and the middle-most layer is the middle (of Agni's body): he
thus puts food in the middle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:11">8:3:2:11</span></span>11.
And, again, why there are four,--'antariksha' (air) consists of four
syllables, and the other layers (*k*iti) consist of two syllables; hence
as much as the air consists of, so much he makes it in laying it down.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:12">8:3:2:12</span></span>12.
And, again, why there are four,--this Agni (altar), doubtless, is an
animal: he thus makes the animal biggest towards the middle; whence an
animal is biggest towards the middle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:13">8:3:2:13</span></span>13.
There are here four *Ri*tavyâs, the Vi*s*va*g*yotis being the fifth, and
five Di*s*yâs,--this makes ten: the Virâ*g* consists of ten syllables,
and the Virâ*g* is food, and the middlemost layer is the middle;--he
thus puts food in the middle (of the body). He lays them down so as not
to be separated from the naturally-perforated one <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_118), for the naturally-perforated one is the
vital air: he thus places the food so as not to be separated from the
vital air. Subsequently (to the central brick) he lays them down:
subsequently

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

to (or upon) the vital air he thus places food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:3:2:14">8:3:2:14</span></span>14. He
then lays down the Prâ*n*abh*ri*t <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_119)
(bricks);--the Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts (breath-holders), doubtless, are the
vital airs: it is the vital airs he thus lays into (Agni's body). There
are ten of them, for there are ten vital airs. He places them in the
forepart (of the altar),--for there are these vital airs in front,--with
(Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 17), 'Protect my vital strength! protect mine
up-breathing! protect my down-breathing! protect my through-breathing!
protect mine eye! protect mine ear! increase my speech! animate my mind!
protect my soul (or body)! give me light!'--He lays them down so as not
to be separated from the seasonal ones, for the vital air is wind: he
thus establishes the wind in the seasons.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_113"></span>[47:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_114) The three
Vi*s*va*g*yotis bricks, placed in (the fourth easterly place from the
centre of) the first, third and fifth layer respectively, are supposed
to represent the regents of the three worlds--earth, air and sky--which
these three layers represent, viz. Agni, Vâyu and Âditya (Sûrya). See
VI, 3, 3, 16.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[47:2](sbe4312.htm#fr_115) Though, properly
speaking, the Vi*s*va*g*yotis lies close to only one of the Di*s*yâs,
viz. the eastern one, it may at any rate be said to lie close to the
range of the Di*s*yâs. Here, too, the sense 'immediately after, not
separated from them in respect of time,' would suit even better.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[47:3](sbe4312.htm#fr_116) See [VIII, 3, 1,
4](sbe4311.htm#8:3:1:4) with note.

<span id="fn_116"></span>[48:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_117)

<span id="img_04800"></span> ![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE THIRD
LAYER.](img/04800.jpg)  
THE CENTRAL PART OF THE THIRD LAYER.

These two *Ri*tavyâs are placed beside (east of) the Vi*s*va*g*yotis,
one north of the other, just over those of the first and second layers,
that is to say, in the fifth space from the centre. In the present case,
however, these bricks are only of half the usual thickness; two others,
of similar size; being placed upon them.

<span id="fn_117"></span>[49:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_118) As in the case of
the live tortoise, in the first layer; see VII, 5, 1, 11 with
note--'Blyxa octandra, a grassy plant growing in marshy land
("lotus-flower," Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 250).'

<span id="fn_118"></span>[50:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_119) That is to say, the
three sets of bricks are not separated by any others from the
Svayamât*rinn*â.

<span id="fn_119"></span>[51:1](sbe4312.htm#fr_120) The ten
Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts are placed--five on each side of the spine--either along
the edge of the altar, or so as to leave the space of one foot between
them and the edge, to afford room for another set of bricks, the
Vâlakhilyâs.
