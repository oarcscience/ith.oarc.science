### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:1">10:2:2:1</span></span>1. Now
the one person which they made out of those seven persons <span
id="fr_585"></span>[1](#fn_575) became this Pra*g*âpati. He produced
living beings (or offspring), and having produced living beings he went
upwards,--he went to that world where that (sun) now shines. And,
indeed, there was then no other (victim) meet for sacrifice but that one
(Pra*g*âpati), and the gods set about offering him up in sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:2">10:2:2:2</span></span>2.
Wherefore it is with reference to this that the *Ri*shi has said (Vâ*g*.
S. XXXI, 16, *Ri*g-veda X, 90, 16), 'The gods offered up sacrifice by
sacrifice,'--for by sacrifice they did offer up him (Pra*g*âpati), the
sacrifice;--'these were the first ordinances:'--for these laws were
instituted first;--'these powers clung unto the firmament,'--the
firmament is the world of heaven, and the powers are the gods: thus,
'Those gods who offered up that sacrifice shall cling to the world of
heaven;'--

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:3">10:2:2:3</span></span>3.
'Where first the perfect gods were,'--the perfect <span
id="fr_586"></span>[2](#fn_576) gods, doubtless, are the vital airs, for
it is they that perfected him in the beginning <span
id="fr_587"></span>[3](#fn_577) when they

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

were desirous of becoming that (body of Pra*g*âpati <span
id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_578)); and even now, indeed, they do perfect
(him).--\[*Ri*g-veda X, 149, 3\]--'Thereafter this other became meet for
sacrifice by the abundance of the immortal world,'--for thereafter,
indeed, other things here--whatsoever is immortal--became fit for
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:4">10:2:2:4</span></span>4.
'Savit*ri*'s well-winged eagle verily was first born, and he was
according to his ordinance,'--the well-winged eagle, doubtless, is
Pra*g*âpati, and Savit*ri* is that (sun): thus, 'In accordance with his
(the sun's) law he indeed (comported himself).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:5">10:2:2:5</span></span>5. He
indeed consists of seven persons, for that Person <span
id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_579) consisted of seven persons;--to wit, the
body of four, and the wings and tail of three, for of four the body of
that Person consisted, and of three his wings and tail.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:6">10:2:2:6</span></span>6. He
measures it (the altar) by the man with upstretched arms <span
id="fr_590"></span>[3](#fn_580); for the sacrifice is a man, and by him
everything here is measured; and that is his highest measure when he
stands with up-stretched arms: he thus secures for him what is his
highest measure, and therewith he then measures it. And what (space)
there is over and above that when he is raised on the forepart of his
foot, that he secures by the enclosing-stones; and hence he

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

should dig a line for the enclosing-stones outside (the altar-ground).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:7">10:2:2:7</span></span>7. Two
cubits he gives to the two wings: he thereby lays strength into the
wings. And the wings are (the bird's) arms, and by means of the arms
food is eaten: it is thus for the sake of food that he gives them that
space; and when he gives two cubits to the two wings, it is because food
is taken from the distance of a cubit.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:2:8">10:2:2:8</span></span>8. To
the tail he gives a span: he thus lays strength into the support, for
the tail is the support. The span means the hand <span
id="fr_591"></span>[1](#fn_581), and by means of the hand food is eaten:
it is thus for the sake of food that he gives it that space; and when he
gives a span to the tail, he thereby settles him (Agni) in (the midst
of) food; and when he gives less (space) to this (part of the body), it
is because he thereby settles him in (the midst of) food <span
id="fr_592"></span>[2](#fn_582). But, indeed, so much does this (the
bird's wing) measure, and so much this (the bird's tail), and hence when
he thus measures them, it is for the sake of securing for him that
(natural measure).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_575"></span>[304:1](sbe4351.htm#fr_585) Literally, those
seven persons which they made into one person. See VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[304:2](sbe4351.htm#fr_586) It is difficult to
see what meaning the author assigns to 'sâdhya' applied to minor classes
of deities.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[304:3](sbe4351.htm#fr_587) See VI, 1, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[305:1](sbe4351.htm#fr_588) Tad eva bubhûshanta
iti, prâ*n*â*h* svayam api [prâ*g*âpatyâtmanâ](errata.htm#5) (?
prâ*g*âpatyâtmâno) bhavitum i*kkh*anta*h*. Sây.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[305:2](sbe4351.htm#fr_589) See VI, 1, 1, 3-6.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[305:3](sbe4351.htm#fr_590) That is to say,
wherever he speaks of man's lengths, the height to which a man reaches
with his upstretched arms is understood; the particular man who supplies
this (relative) standard of measure being the Sacrificer.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[306:1](sbe4351.htm#fr_591) The span of thumb
and little finger is taken to be equal to the distance from the wrist to
the tip of the middle finger.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[306:2](sbe4351.htm#fr_592) That is to say, he
makes him so as to occupy but small space, and to be surrounded by
abundant food.
