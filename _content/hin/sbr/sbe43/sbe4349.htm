Verily, he who (regularly) performs the Agnihotra eats food in the evening and in the morning (when he comes to be) in yonder world, for so much sustenance is there in that sacrifice. And he who performs the New and Full-moon sacrifice (eats food) every half-month; and he who performs the Seasonal sacrifice (does so) every four months; and be who performs the animal sacrifice (twice a year, eats food) every six months; and the Soma-sacrificer once a year; and the builder of the fire-altar at his pleasure eats food every hundred years, or abstains therefrom&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for a hundred years is as much as immortality&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, unending and everlasting: and, verily, for him who knows this, there shall thus be immortality, unending and everlasting; and whatever he as much as touches, as it were, with a reed, shall be for him immortal, unending and everlasting.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_545"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_554">296:1</A> Though no animal sacrifice takes place at the Agny&acirc;dh&acirc;na, the latter, as the fundamental ceremony pre-supposed by all subsequent sacrificial performances, is here compared with the immolation of five victims (VI, 2, 1, 15 seq.) which, taking place as it does on the Upasavatha, or day of preparation, i.e. the day before the Soma-sacrifice on the newly built fire-altar, is, as it were, a preliminary ceremony.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_546"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_555">297:1</A> This refers to the two samidhs (kindling-sticks) put on the Ukhya Agni,--one in the evening, and one in the morning,--after the ashes had been cleared out of the fire-pan (ukh&acirc;); see VI, 6, 4, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_547"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_556">297:2</A> Both in the evening and in the morning two libations of milk are offered (the p&ucirc;rv&acirc;huti and the uttar&acirc;huti), but only the first is offered with a formula, the evening formula being, 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, hail!' whilst the morning formula is, 'S&ucirc;rya is the light, the light is S&ucirc;rya, hail!' See II, 3, 1, 30. For alternative formulas--'With the divine Savit<I>ri</I>, with the Night (or Dawn, respectively) wedded to Indra, may Agni (or Indra, respectively) graciously accept, hail!' see II, 3, 1, 37. 38.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_548"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_557">297:3</A> See VI, 8, 1, 1 seq. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes it to refer to the Agnipra<I>n</I>ayana, or leading forward of the fire to the fire-altar; but that would not fit in well with the ceremony next referred to, viz. the removal of the fishes of the Ukhy&acirc;gni, or fire in the pan; for which see VI, 8, 2, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_549"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_558">297:4</A> VII, 1, 1, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_550"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_559">297:5</A> Viz. on the newly ploughed altar-site, see VII, 2, 4, 13 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_551"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_560">297:6</A> That is, offerings for the fulfilment of some special wishes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_552"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_561">298:1</A> That is, animal sacrifices performed independently of other ceremonies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_553"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_562">298:2</A> See VI, 7, 2, 12 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_554"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_563">298:3</A> See VI, 7, 4, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_555"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_564">298:4</A> That is, the ceremonies connected with the V&acirc;<I>g</I>aprasav&icirc;ya oblations, V, 2, 2, 4 seq.; and the devas&ucirc;-hav&icirc;<I>m</I>shi, or oblations to the Divine Quickeners (by whom the king is supposed to be first consecrated), V, 3, 3, 1 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_556"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_565">298:5</A> See <a href="sbe4338.htm#9:3:4:9">IX, 3, 4, 7. 9</A>. It is strange that the Agnisava should be mentioned here, as it is said to be confined to the Agni<I>k</I>ayana. It would seem that some independent ceremony, such as the B<I>ri</I>haspatisava (consecration of B<I>ri</I>haspati, cf. V, 2, 1, 19; and part iii, introd. p. xxiv seq.), may he referred to.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_557"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_566">298:6</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a identifies these with the offerings of sacrificial sessions (sattra), during which the Sacrificer is indeed called the G<I>ri</I>hapati, or master of the house; see IV, 6, 3, 5 seq.; and part ii, p. 97, note 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_558"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_567">299:1</A> That is to say, the food eaten the first time will sustain him for a hundred years, after which time he may, or may not, take food, being sure of everlasting life and a godlike nature.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_559"></A><A HREF="sbe4349.htm#fr_568">299:2</A> Or, perhaps, for so long lasts the Amrita (the food of the immortals);--agni<I>m</I> <I>k</I>itav&acirc;n purushas tu <I>s</I>atasa<I>m</I>khy&acirc;keshu sa<I>m</I>vatsareshu teshu k&acirc;mam aparimitam a<I>s</I>n&acirc;ti yato y&acirc;vanta<I>h</I> <I>s</I>ata<I>m</I> sa<I>m</I>vatsar&acirc;s t&acirc;vad am<I>ri</I>tam devatvapr&acirc;pakam anantam aparimitam annum bhavati.
