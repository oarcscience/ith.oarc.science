### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:1">9:4:2:1</span></span>1. He
then offers (three) oblations of air;--this fire-altar is these (three)
worlds, and the oblations of air are wind: he thus places the wind into
these worlds, and hence there is wind here in these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:2">9:4:2:2</span></span>2. He
takes (the air) from outside the Vedi; for that wind which is in these
worlds is already contained in this (fire-altar), and he now puts into
it that wind which is beyond these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:3">9:4:2:3</span></span>3. From
outside the Vedi (he takes it),--for the Vedi is this (earth), and the
wind which is on this (earth) is already contained in this (fire-altar):
he now puts into it the wind which is beyond this (earth).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:4">9:4:2:4</span></span>4 By his
two hollow hands (he takes it), for only in this way is the catching of
that (wind brought about). With the Svâhâ-call (he offers), for he
offers just under the shafts (of the chariot),--this chariot is yonder
sun: he thus places the wind on this side of the sun, and hence that one
blows on this side thereof.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:5">9:4:2:5</span></span>5. \[He
offers, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 45\], 'Thou art the cloudy ocean,'--the
cloudy ocean, doubtless, is yonder world (of the sky),--'the giver of
moisture,'--for that (wind) indeed gives moisture: he thus bestows on
this (fire-altar) the wind which is in yonder world;--'blow thou kindly
and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and gently
upon me!'

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:6">9:4:2:6</span></span>6. 'Thou
art the stormy (region), the troop of the Maruts,'--the stormy (region),
the troop of the Maruts, doubtless, is the air-world: he thus bestows on
this (fire-altar) the wind which is in the air-world;--'blow thou kindly
and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably and gently
upon me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:7">9:4:2:7</span></span>7. 'Thou
art the one affording protection and worship,'--the one that affords
protection and worship, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world: he thus
bestows upon this (fire-altar) the wind which is in this world;--'blow
thou kindly and propitiously upon me, hail!'--that is, 'blow favourably
and gently upon me!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:8">9:4:2:8</span></span>8. With
three (formulas) he offers,--three are these worlds, and threefold is
Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he
thus puts air into these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:9">9:4:2:9</span></span>9. And as
to why he offers the oblations of air: he thereby yokes that chariot of
his; for it was thereby that the gods yoked that chariot for (the
obtainment of) all their wishes, thinking, 'By it, when yoked, we shall
obtain them;' and by that yoked (chariot) they indeed obtained their
wishes; and in like manner does the Sacrificer thereby yoke that chariot
of his for (the obtainment of) all his wishes, thinking, 'By it, when
yoked, I shall obtain them;' and by that yoked (chariot) he indeed
obtains all his wishes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:10">9:4:2:10</span></span>10. He
yokes it with the oblations of air <span
id="fr_403"></span>[1](#fn_397),--the oblations of air are the vital
airs it is thus with the

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

vital airs he yokes it <span id="fr_404"></span>[1](#fn_398). With three
(oblations) he yokes it,--there are three vital airs, the out-breathing,
up-breathing, and through-breathing: it is with these he thus yokes it.
Just below the shaft (he offers), for just below the shaft the horse is
yoked;--with his hands, for by the hands the horse is yoked;--in moving
round <span id="fr_405"></span>[2](#fn_399), for in moving round the
horse is yoked.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:11">9:4:2:11</span></span>11. The
right yoke-horse he puts to first, then the left yoke-horse, then the
right side-horse: for thus it is (done) among the gods, otherwise in
human (practice). Let him not yoke that (chariot <span
id="fr_406"></span>[3](#fn_400)) again, lest he should yoke again the
yoked one; but let him give away the vehicle, thinking, 'I shall reap
the benefit of the yoking of it <span id="fr_407"></span>[4](#fn_401).'
They carry it as far as the Adhvaryu's dwelling, holding it right
upwards, for above is that (Agni). He presents it to the Adhvaryu, for
it is he that performs therewith. Let him, however, (not) assign it to
him (till) the time of the offering-gifts.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:12">9:4:2:12</span></span>12. He
then offers the 'Lightsome <span id="fr_408"></span>[5](#fn_402)'
oblations.

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For now the whole
Agni was completed; he now wished for brilliance (ru*k*), and the gods,
by means of these lightsome (oblations), endowed him with brilliance;
and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now endow him therewith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:13">9:4:2:13</span></span>13.
And, again, as to why he offers the lightsome oblations. When
Pra*g*âpati was dismembered, his brilliance departed from him. When the
gods restored him, they, by means of these lightsome oblations, endowed
him with brilliance; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) endow him
therewith.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:14">9:4:2:14</span></span>14.
\[He offers, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 46-48\], 'O Agni, what lights of
thine in the sun <span id="fr_409"></span>[1](#fn_403) . . . ' 'O ye
gods, what lights of yours are in the sun. . . <span
id="fr_410"></span>[1](#fn_403)'--'Bestow thou light upon our priests,
(work thou light in our kings, light in our people and *S*ûdras, bestow
light upon me by thy light)!' He thus says 'light' each time,--light is
immortality: it is immortality he thus bestows upon him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:15">9:4:2:15</span></span>15. He
then offers one relating to Varu*n*a. That whole Agni has now been
completed, and he now is the deity Varu*n*a: it is to him that he offers
this oblation, and by the oblation he makes him (Agni) a deity, for that
one alone is a deity to whom offering is made, but not that one to whom
(offering is) not (made). With a verse addressed to Varu*n*a (he
offers): he thus gratifies him by his own self, by his own deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:16">9:4:2:16</span></span>16.
And, again, as to why he offers one relating

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

to Varu*n*a. When Pra*g*âpati was dismembered, his strength departed
from him. When the gods restored him they, by this (oblation), bestowed
strength upon him; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) bestow it
upon him. With a verse addressed to Varu*n*a (he offers),--Varu*n*a is
the ruling power, and ruling power means strength: it is thus by
strength that he bestows strength upon him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:17">9:4:2:17</span></span>17.
\[He offers, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 49\], 'For this I appeal to thee,
worshipping thee with prayer,'--that is, 'For that I beseech thee,
worshipping thee with prayer;'--'for this the Sacrificer imploreth thee
with offerings,'--that is, 'for this, this Sacrificer implores thee with
offerings;--'without wrath listen thou here, O Varu*n*a!'--that is,
'without anger listen thou here to us, O Varu*n*a!'--'take not our life
from us, O far-ruler!'--he thereby gives utterance to a surrender of his
own self.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:18">9:4:2:18</span></span>18. He
then offers the Arkâ*s*vamedha-santati <span
id="fr_411"></span>[1](#fn_404) oblations. The light (arka), doubtless,
is this fire (Agni), and the A*s*vamedha (horse-sacrifice) is yonder
sun,--when created, these two were separate: by means of these oblations
the gods drew them together and connected them; and in like manner does
this (Sacrificer), by means of these oblations, now draw them together
and connect them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:19">9:4:2:19</span></span>19.
\[He offers, with, Vâ*g*. S. XVIII, 50\], 'Heaven-like heat, hail!'--the
heat, doubtless, is yonder sun; he thus establishes yonder sun in Agni.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:20">9:4:2:20</span></span>20.
'Heaven-like flame, hail!'--the flame is

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

this Agni: he thus establishes this Agni in yonder sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:21">9:4:2:21</span></span>21.
'The Heaven-like shining one, hail!' the shining one, doubtless, is
yonder sun: he places him again up there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:22">9:4:2:22</span></span>22.
'Heaven -like light, hail!'--the light is this Agni: he places him again
here (on the fire-altar).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:23">9:4:2:23</span></span>23.
'The heaven-like Sûrya, hail!'--Sûrya, doubtless, is yonder sun: he thus
places yonder sun highest of all this (universe), whence he is the
highest of all this (universe).

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:24">9:4:2:24</span></span>24.
These are five oblations he offers, the fire-altar consists of five
layers, a year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni
is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus draws together and
connects those two.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:25">9:4:2:25</span></span>25. And
as to why he says, 'Heaven-like heat, hail! heaven-like flame,
hail!'--these indeed are names of this fire: he thereby gratifies these,
and by the offering he makes them a deity; for only that one is a deity
to whom an oblation is offered, but not that to whom it is not offered.
Moreover, by naming them, he thus places them on this fire-altar.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:26">9:4:2:26</span></span>26.
These are five oblations he offers,--the fire-altar consists of five
layers, and the year of five seasons, and Agni is the year: as great as
Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much food he thus gratifies
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:27">9:4:2:27</span></span>27. Now
as to the insertion <span id="fr_412"></span>[1](#fn_405) of (any other)
oblations. If he should know any oblation supplied with a brâhma*n*a
(dogmatic explanation) let him offer it at

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

this time; for it is for (the obtainment of his) wishes that he yokes
this chariot, and whatsoever oblation he offers on this occasion he
offers as one that is (to be) fulfilled.

<span class="margnote"><span id="9:4:2:28">9:4:2:28</span></span>28. As
to this they say, 'Let him not offer (any additional oblations), lest he
should do what is excessive.' Let him, nevertheless, offer them; for it
is for (special) wishes that these oblations are offered, and in wishes
there is nothing excessive.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_397"></span>[236:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_403) That is, these
oblations are, as it were, to represent the team of the chariot.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[237:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_404) Or, he supplies him
(Agni).

<span id="fn_399"></span>[237:2](sbe4340.htm#fr_405) According to Kâty.
*S*r. XVIII, 6, 1, 2, the Adhvaryu first takes a double handful of air
from beyond the east side of the Vedi, and offers it below the right
(south) shaft; then from beyond the north side to be offered up below
the left shaft, and lastly from beyond the south side to be offered
below the shaft where the right side-horse would be yoked. In each case
the girth (or yoke-tie) is to be carried round in the same way as if a
real horse were yoked.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[237:3](sbe4340.htm#fr_406) Sâya*n*a takes it
to mean 'that horse'; and according to Kâty. *S*r. XVIII, 6, 3-5, the
carriage is to be carried to the Adhvaryu's house, and, at the time when
the dakshi*n*âs are presented to the priests, it is to be given to that
priest along with three horses. The Brâhma*n*a, however, does not seem
to mention the horses.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[237:4](sbe4340.htm#fr_407) Literally, of the
yoked one.

<span id="fn_402"></span>[237:5](sbe4340.htm#fr_408). These oblations
are here called 'ruṅmatî,' because the three <span id="page_238">p.
238</span> verses used with them contain the word 'ru*k*,' being prayers
for the bestowal of light.

<span id="fn_403"></span>[238:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_410) These two verses
had already been used in laying down the Dviya*g*us bricks; see VII, 4,
2, 21.

<span id="fn_404"></span>[239:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_411) That is, the
joining together of the fire and the horse-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_405"></span>[240:1](sbe4340.htm#fr_412) Or, location,
proper place; cf. [p. 138](sbe4327.htm#page_138), note
[1](sbe4327.htm#fn_245).
