For a month they silently apply the earth-layer for the Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s, for so long desire (lasts) in the winter season: thus he builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the winter season.</p>

So long, indeed, desire (lasts) in the twelve months and the six seasons: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in the twelve months and the six seasons.</p>

When they perform the Upasad on these days, these (days) are the days and nights of that (thirteenth, or intercalary) month: and when (they perform) the Pravargya, he thereby establishes yonder sun also in that (seventh) season,--so long, indeed, desire (lasts) in the thirteen months and the seven seasons: he thus builds for himself a body so as to obtain all of whatever desire there is in thirteen months and seven seasons.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10:2:5:16">10:2:5:16</A></FONT></span>16. For a year Soma should be pressed,--the year is everything, and the one hundred and one-fold (altar) is everything: by means of everything he thus gains everything.

<P><A NAME="fn_605"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_615">316:1</A> The Upasads (or sieges) are performed twice a day on at least three days (the regular number for ordinary one day's Soma-sacrifices) intervening between the end of the D&icirc;ksh&acirc; (initiation) and the day of the Soma-sacrifice; see part ii, p. 105, note 1. On the first day the first layer is built between the two performances (whilst the final preparation of the altar-site, as well as the building of the G&acirc;rhapatya altar and the installation of the Ukhya Agni thereon, takes place before the morning performance of the Upasads), and on the second day the remaining layers are built.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_606"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_616">316:2</A> For the construction in the <i>oratio directa</i>, see part iii, p. 34, note 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_607"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_617">316:3</A> Or, they went into their shelter (pra-pad).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_608"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_618">317:1</A> Or, austere devotion, see III, 4, 4, 27, where fasting during the Upasad days is recommended as calculated to promote religious fervour. There is also, however, the primary' meaning 'heat' implied, whence the 'heating' of the cauldron (gharma--&#0952;&#0949;&#0961;&#0956;&#0972;&#0962;) at the Pravargya (representing the sun) is connected with the Upasads.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_609"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_619">317:2</A> That is, the fire-altar used at the sacrificial period (ayana) called T&acirc;pa<I>s</I><I>k</I>ita, which generally requires a full year (360 days) for the performance of the Upasads (as do also the D&icirc;ksh&acirc;- before them, and the performance of the Soma-sacrifice after them); cf. XII, 3, 3, 10 seq.; K&acirc;ty. XIV, 5, 1.--&Acirc;<I>s</I>val. XII, 5, 9; K&acirc;ty. XXIV, 5, 7, however, mention a T&acirc;pa<I>s</I><I>k</I>ita which only requires four months for each of the three periods, or a year altogether, whilst the maximum duration is by &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. fixed at thirty-six years (twelve for each period); and by K&acirc;ty. at three years for the Upasads and a year for each of the two other ceremonies.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_610"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_620">317:3</A> See part ii, p. 304.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_611"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_621">317:4</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a does not specify what sacrificial performance is intended as requiring twenty-four Upasad-days, but merely says that they are required 'kratuvi<I>s</I>eshe,' at some special kind of sacrifice. At all events, the Sacrificer would be at liberty to adopt that number of Upasad-days instead of the minimum of days prescribed, if he hoped to derive special benefit therefrom.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_612"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_622">318:1</A> For an ordinary Ek&acirc;ha, or one day's Soma-sacrifice, the Upasads may be performed for twelve days instead of the usual three days (K&acirc;ty. VIII, 2, 40). It is also the regular number of days for Ah&icirc;nas (ib. XIII, i, x; &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. IV, 8, 15) and for most sattras.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_613"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_623">318:2</A> That is, when the Upasads last for a whole year, as at the T&acirc;pa<I>s</I><I>k</I>ita.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_614"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_624">318:3</A> That is, by building for his Soma-sacrifice an altar the body of which requires a whole year in being laid down, as it does in the T&acirc;pa<I>s</I><I>k</I>ita.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_615"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_625">318:4</A> Translated literally, the sentence would run thus: 'Thus as <A NAME="page_319"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 319</FONT></A> much desire as there is in the spring season--he builds for himself a body so as to obtain all that (desire).' Only the building of an altar (body) for a whole year ensures the full fruition of sensual pleasures supplied during the year.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_616"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_626">319:1</A> That is, these three kinds of bricks--the five Asapatn&acirc;s, and forty Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>s being laid down on the first day, and of the twenty-nine Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;s one each day,--the three kinds of bricks thus take one month in being laid down, after which the 's&acirc;danam' and 'S&ucirc;dadohas' (cf. part iii, p. 301, note 3) are performed upon them.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_617"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_627">320:1</A> Viz. after the twenty-eight days of the twelfth month two days remain to make up the year, so that the (first) Suty&acirc; day (pressing day) takes place after the expiry of a full year.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_618"></A><A HREF="sbe4354.htm#fr_628">320:2</A> The Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it, as usually performed, is an Agnish<I>t</I>oma sacrifice, the twelve Stotras of which are chanted in three different stomas or hymn-forms, viz. the first four in the triv<I>ri</I>t (nine-versed), the next four in the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a (fifteen-versed), and the last four in the saptada<I>s</I>a (seventeen-versed) stoma. For the stotriya-texts see <A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A> T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XVI, 5, 1 seq. It is closely united with the Abhi<I>g</I>it Soma-day--the stotras of which are performed in four stomas, viz. three in each of those used for the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it, and the last three in the ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, or twenty-one-versed, stoma--with which it may, indeed, be combined in one and the same performance; and both form part of the sacrificial session called Gav&acirc;m ayanam (part ii, p. 427). The Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it (as well as the Abhi<I>g</I>it) may, however, also be performed as an Atir&acirc;tra instead of Agnish<I>t</I>oma, and in that case the sequence of Stomas is entirely different, their order being as follows: the first four stotras are performed in the first four stomas (triv<I>ri</I>t, pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, saptada<I>s</I>a, ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a); the next four stotras in the four stomas beginning with the second stoma (up to tri<I>n</I>ava), and the next four stotras in the four stomas beginning with the third stoma (up to trayast<I>ri</I><I>m</I><I>s</I>a). Of the three Ukthastotras, the first is performed in the tri<I>n</I>ava, and the two others in the ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a; the Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in in its own (ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a) form; the night-chants in the pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a; and the twilight-chant in the triv<I>ri</I>t-stoma. See T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XX, 9.</P>
