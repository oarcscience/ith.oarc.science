<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:1">8:4:1:1</A></FONT></span>1. He lays down the fourth layer. For the gods having laid down the third layer, now ascended; but, the third layer being the air; it was the air which, having completed it, they ascended.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:2">8:4:1:2</A></FONT></span>2. They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_59"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 59</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!' Whilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what is above the air and below the heavens; that world was to their minds, as it were, unstable and unsettled.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:3">8:4:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. They said to the Brahman, 'We will lay thee down (or, set thee up) here!'--'What will therefrom accrue to me?'--'Thou shalt be the highest of us!'--'So be it!' They accordingly laid the Brahman down here, whence people say that the Brahman is the highest of gods. Now, by this fourth layer these two, heaven and earth, are upheld, and the fourth layer is the Brahman, whence people say that heaven and earth are upheld by the Brahman. He lays down the Stomas (hymn-forms)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_130"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: the stomas being the vital airs, and the Brahman also being the vital airs, it is the Brahman he thereby lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:4">8:4:1:4</A></FONT></span>4. And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. The gods, at that time, said to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, 'We will lay thee down here! So be it!' He did not say, 'What will therefrom accrue unto me?' but whenever Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati wished to obtain anything from the gods, they said, 'What will therefrom accrue to us?' And hence even now if a father wishes to obtain anything from his sons, they say, 'What will therefrom</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_60"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 60</FONT></A></p>  
<p>accrue unto us?' and when the sons (wish to obtain anything) from the father, he says, 'So be it!' for in this way Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati and the gods used of old to converse together. He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati also being the vital airs, it is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati he thus lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:5">8:4:1:5</A></FONT></span>5. And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. Those vital airs, the <I>Ri</I>shis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, that saw this fourth layer&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and who stepped nigh with that essential element (of the altar), are these (vital airs): it is them he now lays down. He lays down the Stomas:--the stomas being the vital airs, and the <I>Ri</I>shis also being the vital airs, it is the <I>Ri</I>shis he thus lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:6">8:4:1:6</A></FONT></span>6. And, again, as to why he lays down the Stomas. When Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati had become relaxed (disjointed), the gods took him and went away. V&acirc;yu, taking that (part) of him which was above the waist and below the head, kept going away from him, having become the deities and the forms of the year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:7">8:4:1:7</A></FONT></span>7. He spake to him, 'Come to me and restore to me that wherewith thou hast gone from me!'--'What will therefrom accrue unto me?'--'That part of my self shall be sacred unto thee!'--'So be it!' thus V&acirc;yu restored that unto him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:8">8:4:1:8</A></FONT></span>8. Those eighteen (bricks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) which there are at</p>

<p>first, are that very (part) of his (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's) body; and when he places them in this (layer), he thereby restores to him that (part) of his body which these (form): therefore he places them in this (layer). He lays down the Stomas: the stomas being the vital airs, and V&acirc;yu (the wind) also being the vital airs, it is V&acirc;yu he thus lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:9">8:4:1:9</A></FONT></span>9. In front he lays down one, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIV, 23), 'The swift one, the Triv<I>ri</I>t!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is triv<I>ri</I>t (threefold, or thrice-three-versed). And as to why he calls it 'the swift one,' it is because this, indeed, is the swiftest of stomas. But the swift threefold one, doubtless, is V&acirc;yu: he exists in these three worlds. And as to why he calls him 'the swift one,' it is because he is the swiftest of all beings: being (or, in the form of) V&acirc;yu it remained in front,--it is that form he now lays down,</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:10">8:4:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. [The back one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, with], 'The bright one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></p>  
<p>hymn-form which is fifteenfold (fifteen-versed). And when he calls it 'the bright one,' it is that the bright one is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt is fifteenfold. But the bright, fifteenfold one, doubtless, also is the Moon: he waxes during fifteen days, and wanes during fifteen days. And as to his calling him 'the bright one,' the Moon indeed shines: being the Moon it remained on the right side,--it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:11">8:4:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. [The left (north) one, with], 'The (aerial) space, the Saptada<I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is seventeenfold. And as to his calling it 'the space,'--the (aerial) space is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and the seventeenfold one is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. But indeed the seventeenfold space also is the year: in it there are twelve months and five seasons. And as to his calling it space, the year indeed is space: being space, it remained on the left side,--it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:12">8:4:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. [The right (south) one, with], 'The upholder, the Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-one-fold. And as to his calling it 'the upholder,'--the upholder means a foothold, and the Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a is a foothold. But indeed the twenty-one-fold upholder also is yonder sun: to him belong the twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun himself is the upholder, the twenty-one-fold. And as to his calling him 'the upholder,'--when he sets everything here holds its peace: being the sun, it remained at the back,--it is that form he now lays down; and the forms of the year he lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:13">8:4:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. 'Speed, the Ash<I>t</I>&acirc;da<I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is eighteenfold. Now,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>speed, the eighteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, five seasons, and the year itself is speed, the eighteenfold. And as to his calling it 'speed,' the year indeed speeds all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:14">8:4:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. 'Heat, the Navada<I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is nineteenfold. But heat, the nineteenfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, six seasons, and the year itself is heat, the nineteenfold. And as to his calling it 'heat,' the year indeed burns all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:15">8:4:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. 'Victorious assault, the Savi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twentyfold. But victorious assault, the twentyfold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, and the year itself is victorious assault, the twentyfold. And as to why he calls it 'victorious assault,' the year indeed assails all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:16">8:4:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. 'Vigour, the Dv&acirc;vi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-two-fold. But vigour, the twenty-two-fold one, doubtless is the year: in it there are twelve months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is vigour, the twenty-two-fold. And as to why he calls it 'vigour,' the year is indeed the most vigorous of all existing things: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:17">8:4:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. 'The array, the Trayovi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-three-fold. But array, the twenty-three-fold one, doubtless, means the year: in it there are thirteen months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the array, the twenty-three-fold.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_64"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 64</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> And as to his calling it 'array,' the year is indeed arrayed over all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:18">8:4:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. 'The womb, the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-four-fold. But the womb, the twenty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months. And as to his calling it 'the womb,' the year is indeed the womb of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:19">8:4:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. 'The embryos, the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>avi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is twenty-five-fold. But the embryos, the twenty-five-fold one, doubtless; is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, and the year itself is the embryos, the twenty-five-fold. And as to his calling it 'the embryos,'--the year, as an embryo, in the shape of the thirteenth month, enters the seasons: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:20">8:4:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. 'Strength, the Tri<I>n</I>ava!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thrice ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,'--strength (o<I>g</I>as) means the thunderbolt (va<I>g</I>ra), and the Tri<I>n</I>ava is a thunderbolt. But strength also means the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, the two, day and night, and the year itself is strength, the thrice-ninefold. And as to his calling it 'strength,' the year indeed is the strength of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:21">8:4:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. 'Design, the Ekatri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-one-fold. But design, the thirty-one-fold, doubtless, means the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, and the year itself is design, the thirty-one-fold. And</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_65"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 65</FONT></A></p>  
<p>as to his calling it 'design,' the year indeed designs (makes, forms) all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:22">8:4:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. 'The foundation, the Trayastri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-three-fold. And as to why he calls it 'the foundation,' the thirty-three-fold is indeed a foundation. But indeed the foundation, the thirty-three-fold, also is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, six seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the foundation, the thirty-three-fold. And as to his calling it 'the foundation,' the year is indeed the foundation of all beings: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:23">8:4:1:23</A></FONT></span>23. 'The range of the ruddy one, the <I>K</I>atustri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-four-fold. But the range of the ruddy one (the sun), the thirty-four-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-months, seven seasons, the two, day and night, and the year itself is the range of the ruddy one, the thirty-four-fold. And as to his calling it 'the range of the ruddy one,' the range of the ruddy one, doubtless, means supreme sway, and the thirty-four-fold one means supreme sway: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:24">8:4:1:24</A></FONT></span>24. 'The firmament, the Sha<I>t</I>tri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is thirty-six-fold. But the firmament, the thirty-six-fold one, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-four half-moons, and twelve months. And as to why he calls it 'the firmament' (n&acirc;kam), it is because there is no pain (na akam) for whosoever goes there. And the firmament indeed is the year, the heavenly world is the year: it is that form he now lays down.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:25">8:4:1:25</A></FONT></span>25. 'The revolving sphere, the Ash<I>t</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>atv&acirc;ri<I>m</I><I>s</I>a!' he therewith lays down that hymn-form which is forty-eight-fold. But the revolving sphere, the forty-eight-fold, doubtless, is the year: in it there are twenty-six half-months, thirteen months, seven seasons, and the two, day and night. And as to his calling it 'the revolving sphere,' from the year all creatures indeed are evolved: it is that form he now lays down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:26">8:4:1:26</A></FONT></span>26. 'The stay, the <I>K</I>atush<I>t</I>oma!' he therewith lays down the chant of praise consisting of four stomas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_137"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. And as to his calling it 'the stay,'--stay means support, and the <I>K</I>atush<I>t</I>oma is a support. But the stay, the <I>K</I>atush<I>t</I>oma, doubtless, is V&acirc;yu (the wind), for he sings from all those four quarters. And as to his calling him 'the stay,'--stay means support; and the wind indeed is the support of all beings: it is that form he now lays down. The wind he places first and last: by the wind he thus encloses all these beings on both sides.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:27">8:4:1:27</A></FONT></span>27. These, then, are eighteen bricks he lays down; this makes two Triv<I>ri</I>ts,--the Triv<I>ri</I>t being breath, and breath being wind, this layer is V&acirc;yu.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:4:1:28">8:4:1:28</A></FONT></span>28. And as to why there are eighteen,--the year is eighteenfold: twelve months and six seasons. And Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati indeed is the year, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is eighteenfold: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he makes it when he lays it down.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_130"></A><A HREF="sbe4315.htm#fr_131">59:1</A> This refers to the first eighteen bricks of the fourth layer; but as the names of the bricks (ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;, f.) are invariably of the feminine gender, it is doubtful whether stoma (m.), in this case, is meant as the designation of these bricks, or merely as their symbolical analogon. In the former case, one would rather, from the analogy of other bricks, expect some such term as 'stomy&acirc;.' To the first four of them Mah&icirc;dhara, on V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.
