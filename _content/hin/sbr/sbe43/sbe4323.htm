He lays down the N&acirc;kasads (firmament-seated bricks): the firmament-seated ones, assuredly, are the gods. In this (layer) that whole fire-altar becomes completed, and therein these (bricks are) the firmament (n&acirc;ka), the world of heaven: it is therein that the gods seated themselves; and inasmuch as the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven, the gods are the firmament-seated. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:1:3">8:6:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. Whilst meditating, they saw these bricks, the N&acirc;kasads, and placed them on (the altar): by means of them they seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and inasmuch as through them they seated themselves (sad) on that firmament (n&acirc;ka), in the world of heaven, these are the N&acirc;ka-sad (bricks); and in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down these (bricks), now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>

Thus much, indeed, is the whole sacrifice, and the sacrifice is the self of the gods: it was after making the sacrifice their own self that the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, after making the sacrifice his own self, seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:1:11">8:6:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. He then lays down the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc; ('five-knobbed') bricks; for the N&acirc;kasads are (parts of) the sacrifice, and so indeed are the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s the sacrifice: the N&acirc;kasads are these four sacrificial priests together with the Sacrificer as the fifth; and the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s are the Hotr&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Now the Hotr&acirc;s are additional (to the officiating staff, or to the Hot<I>ri</I>) and whatever is additional is an excrescence (<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>a); and hence, as they are five additional (bricks), they are (called) Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_190"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:1:12">8:6:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. And, again, as to why he lays down the N&acirc;kasad-Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s;--it is for the sake of completeness; for the N&acirc;kasads are the self, and the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s the mate, and this, the mate, doubtless, is one half of the self; for when one is with his mate&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_191"></A><A HREF="#fn_190"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then he is whole and complete.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:1:13">8:6:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. And, again, as to why he lays down the N&acirc;kasad-Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s;--the N&acirc;kasads are the self, and the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s are offspring (or subjects)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_191"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now progeny is something additional to the self, and whatever is additional is an excrescence; and hence, as they are five additional ones, they are (called) Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:1:14">8:6:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. And, again, as to why he lays down the N&acirc;kasad-Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s;--the N&acirc;kasads are the regions, and the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s, too, are the regions: what five regions there are on this side of yonder sun, they are the N&acirc;kasads, and those which are on the other side are the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s. Now those regions which are on the other side of yonder sun are additional, and what is additional is an excrescence (<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>a): and hence, as they are five additional ones, they are called Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:1:15">8:6:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. And, again, as to why he lays down the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s. Now, at that time the gods were afraid lest the fiends, the Rakshas, should destroy</p>

<p>these worlds of theirs from above. They put those protectors over these worlds, to wit, those shafts and missiles; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now put those protectors over these worlds, to wit, those shafts and missiles.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:1:16">8:6:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. He places one in front, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XV, 15), 'This one in front, the yellow-haired one,'--Agni, no doubt, is in front; and as 'to his saying of him as (being) 'in front,' it is because they take him out (of the G&acirc;rhapatya hearth) towards the front&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_193"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and attend upon him towards the front; and as to why he calls him yellow-haired, it is because Agni is, as it were, yellow;--'the sun-rayed one,' for Agni's rays are like those of the sun;--'and Rathag<I>ri</I>tsa and Rathau<I>g</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_194"></A><A HREF="#fn_193"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, his commander and his chieftain,' the two spring-months are these two;--'and the nymphs Pu<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ikasthal&acirc; and Kratusthal&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_195"></A><A HREF="#fn_194"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said M&acirc;hitthi; but army and battle these two are;--'mordacious beasts the shaft, manslaughter the missile,'--inasmuch as they fight in army and battle, those mordacious beasts are the shaft; 'manslaughter the missile,'--inasmuch as they slay one another, manslaughter is the missile;--'to them be homage!' it is to them he pays homage;--'be they gracious unto us!' they are indeed gracious to him;--'he whom we hate, and he who hates us,</p>

<p>him we put into their jaws!' whomsoever he hates, and whoever hates him, him he puts into their jaws. 'N. N.

XV, 16), 'This one on the right, the all-worker,' the all-worker is this V&acirc;yu (the wind) who blows here, for he makes everything here; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'on the right,' therefore it is in the south that he blows most;--'and Rathasvana (chariot-noise) and Rathe<I>k</I>itra (glorious on the chariot), his commander and chieftain;' these are the two summer-months;--'and the two nymphs, Menak&acirc; and Saha<I>g</I>any&acirc;,'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said M&acirc;hitthi; but these two are heaven and earth;--'Goblins the shaft, demons the missile;' for goblins indeed are here the shaft (weapon), and demons the missile;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>

XV, 17), 'This one behind, the all-embracer,'--the all-embracer, doubtless, is yonder sun; for as soon as he rises all this embracing space comes into existence; and because he speaks of him as (being) 'behind,' therefore one sees him only when he goes towards the back (west);--'and Rathaprota (fixed on the chariot) and Asamaratha (of matchless chariot), his commander and chieftain;' these are the two rainy months;--'and the nymphs Pramlo<I>k</I>ant&icirc; (the setting one) and</p>

XV, 17), 'This one on the left, of ever flowing blessings;' on the left is the sacrifice; and as to why he speaks of it as 'on the left,' it is because the sacrifice is performed from the left (north) side; and as to why he speaks of it as 'of ever-flowing blessings (sa<I>m</I>yadvasu),' they do indeed flow together (sa<I>m</I>yanti) to the sacrifice, thinking, 'this is a blessing;'--'and T&acirc;rkshya and Arish<I>t</I>anemi, his commander and chieftain,' these are the two autumn-months; 'and the nymphs Vi<I>s</I>v&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc; (the all-inclined) and Gh<I>ri</I>t&acirc;<I>k</I>&icirc; (the ghee-inclined),'--'quarter and intermediate quarter,' said M&acirc;hitthi, but they are the vedi (altar) and the offering-spoon, for the altar is all-inclined&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_195"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the offering-spoon is ghee-inclined;--'water the shaft, wind the missile,'--water indeed is here the shaft, and wind the missile, for from this side it blows hot, and from that side cold;--'to them be homage . . .!' the import of this has been explained.</p>

These, then, are the shafts and missiles which the gods then put as protectors over these worlds, and as to offspring (or subjects&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_198"></A><A HREF="#fn_197"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), they are the commander and chieftain; and as to the mates, they are those nymphs,--having thus become complete with offspring and with mates, the gods seated themselves on that firmament, in the world of heaven; and in like manner does the Sacrificer, having become complete with offspring and a mate, now seat himself on that firmament, in the world of heaven.</p>

There are, however, only five of them, for he lays them down by two and two. And, verily, they are prayers for prosperity to Agni (the fire-altar).

Between (each) two he throws loose soil, for these two bricks being fires, he does so fearing lest these two fires should blaze up together. And, moreover, loose soil means food: it is thus by means of food that he brings about concord between them.</p>

Having laid down (a brick) in front, he lays down those on the right, behind, on the left, and in the middle. Then the upper ones: having first laid down one in front, he lays down those on the right, on the left, in the middle, and behind. And, indeed, the world of heaven is entered from below, for the gods, having at that time, closed up these worlds on all sides, entered the world of heaven from below; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now, having closed up these worlds on all sides, enter the world of heaven from below.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_180"></A><A HREF="sbe4323.htm#fr_181">97:1</A> The central portion of the fifth layer is here characterised as symbolically representing the firmament, the blue canopy of heaven, and the region of bliss beyond it. The outer rim of this central structure is formed by a continuous ring of twenty-nine Stomabh&acirc;g&acirc; (st) bricks representing, it would seem, the horizon on which the vault of heaven rests. There is some doubt as to the exact manner in which this ring of bricks is to be arranged. According to K&acirc;ty. <I>S</I>rautas. XVII, 11, 10, fifteen bricks are to he placed south (and fourteen north) of the an&ucirc;ka, or spine (running through the <A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A> centre from west to east). As regards the southern semicircle, the fifteen bricks are to be distributed in such a way that eight fall within the south-easterly, and seven into the south-westerly, quadrant. Some such arrangement as that adopted in the diagram below would seem to be what is intended. It will be seen that this arrangement includes two half-size bricks in the south-easterly</p>

<p>quadrant, the one lying immediately south of the 'spine,' and the other immediately east of the 'cross-spine.' It is an awkward fact, however, that one of. the commentators on the S&ucirc;tra referred to, states that there are to be two half-foot bricks, (one) on each side of the spine--that is, as would seem, the 'cross-spine.' I cannot but think, however, that this must be a mistake, as otherwise it would seem to make the construction of a continuous ring impossible. Inside this ring, on the adjoining range (viz. the <I>Ri</I>tavy&acirc; <A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A> range, being the fifth range from the centre, see the diagram of the first layer, <A HREF="sbe4305.htm#page_17">p. 17</A>), five N&acirc;kasads (n) are placed on the spines, with the exception of the eastern one, which is to be placed in the second space north of the spine, that is to say, a foot from it (so as to leave space between it and the spine for the left Ritavy&acirc;; cf. <a href="sbe4326.htm#8:7:1:11">VIII, 7, 1, 11</A>, with note). In the south two half-sized bricks are laid down instead of one full-sized one. All these five bricks are of half the usual thickness so as to allow five others, the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>a<I>k</I>&ucirc;<I>d</I>&acirc;s (p), being placed upon them. Of the <I>kh</I>andasy&acirc;s, or bricks representing the metres, only three sets (of three bricks each, viz. a full-sized one flanked on either side by a half-sized one) fall within the circle formed by the stomabh&acirc;g&acirc;-ring, viz. the trish<I>t</I>ubhs (t), <I>g</I>agat&icirc;s (<I>g</I>), and anush<I>t</I>ubhs (a). The remaining space in the centre is now filled up by the G&acirc;rhapatya hearth, consisting of eight bricks. Thereon is placed a second layer of eight bricks exactly corresponding to the first, and called Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti. This pile (marked by hatching in the sketch) thus rises above the fifth layer by the full depth of a brick. He then lays down the two <I>Ri</I>tavy&acirc;s (<I>ri</I>t) just within the ring on the east side; and the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>yotis (v), representing the sun, immediately west of them. Having now filled up the available spaces of the layer with Lokamp<I>ri</I><I>n</I>&acirc;s, and scattered loose soil on it, he finally lays down two perforated bricks (marked in the sketch by cross-hatching), the Vikar<I>n</I>&icirc; and the Svayam&acirc;t<I>ri</I><I>n</I><I>n</I>&acirc;, so that the latter lies exactly in the centre, and the former immediately north of it, over the 'cross-spine.'</P>
