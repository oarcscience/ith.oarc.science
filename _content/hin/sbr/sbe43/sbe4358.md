### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:1">10:3:3:1</span></span>1.
Dhîra *S*âtapar*n*eya once on a time repaired to Mahâ*s*âla <span
id="fr_644"></span>[2](#fn_634) *G*âbâla. He said to him, 'Knowing
what <span id="fr_645"></span>[3](#fn_635), hast thou come to
me?'--'Agni (the fire) I know.'--'What Agni knowest
thou?'--'Speech.'--'What becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He
becomes eloquent <span id="fr_646"></span>[4](#fn_636),' he said,
'speech does not fail him.'

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:2">10:3:3:2</span></span>2.
'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what (else) hast thou come to
me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Eye.'--'What
becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes seeing,' he said; his
eye does not fail him.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:3">10:3:3:3</span></span>3.
'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to
me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Mind.'--'What
becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes thoughtful,' he said;
'his mind does not fail him.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:4">10:3:3:4</span></span>4.
'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to
me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Ear.'--'What
becomes of him who knows that Agni?'--'He becomes hearing,' he said;
'his ear does not fail him.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:5">10:3:3:5</span></span>5.
'Thou knowest Agni,' he said; 'knowing what hast thou come to
me?'--'Agni I know.'--'What Agni knowest thou?'--'The Agni who is
everything here, him I know.'--On (hearing) this said, he stepped down
to him and said, 'Teach me that Agni, sir!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:6">10:3:3:6</span></span>6. He
said,--Verily, that Agni is the breath; for when man sleeps, speech
passes into the breath, and so do the eye, the mind, and the ear; and
when he awakes, they again issue from the breath. Thus much as to the
body.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:7">10:3:3:7</span></span>7. Now
as to the deity. That speech verily is Agni himself; and that eye is
yonder sun; and that

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

mind is that moon; and that ear is the quarters; and that breath is the
wind that blows here.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:3:3:8">10:3:3:8</span></span>8. Now,
when that fire goes out, it is wafted up in the wind (air), whence
people say of it, 'It has expired <span
id="fr_647"></span>[1](#fn_637),' for it is wafted up in the wind. And
when the sun sets it enters the wind, and so does the moon; and the
quarters are established in the wind, and from out of the wind they
issue again. And when he who knows this passes away from this world, he
passes into the fire by his speech, into the sun by his eye, into the
moon by his mind, into the quarters by his ear, and into the wind by his
breath; and being composed thereof, he becomes whichever of these
deities he chooses, and is at rest.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_634"></span>[331:2](sbe4358.htm#fr_644) Literally, one who
keeps a large house, a lord. Sâya*n*a, however, treats it as a proper
name.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[331:3](sbe4358.htm#fr_645) That is, 'with what
knowledge.'

<span id="fn_636"></span>[331:4](sbe4358.htm#fr_646) Or, perhaps,
possessed of a good voice. To be 'vâgmin' is <span id="page_332">p.
332</span> enumerated among the necessary qualifications of the
officiating priest by Lâ*t*y. I, 1, 6, where the commentator, however,
explains the term either as 'ready of speech (vaktu*m* samartha*h*),' or
as 'using correct, or elegant, speech (sa*m*sk*ri*tavâ*k*).'

<span id="fn_637"></span>[333:1](sbe4358.htm#fr_647) Literally, 'it has
blown out, or up.'
