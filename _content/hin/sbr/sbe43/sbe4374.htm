The day, indeed, was produced as the Mahiman&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_830"></A><A HREF="#fn_817"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (cup) before the horse, and its birthplace is in the eastern sea. The night was produced as the Mahiman (cup) behind (or after) it, and its birth-place was in the western sea: these two Mahiman (cups), indeed, came to be on both sides of the horse. As Haya (steed) it carried the gods, as Va<I>g</I>in (racer) the Gandharvas, as Aryan (courser) the Asuras, as A<I>s</I>va (horse) men. The sea, indeed, is its kindred, the sea its birth-place.</p>
