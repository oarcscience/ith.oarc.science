### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:1">10:5:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
that shining orb is the Great Litany, the *Ri*k-verses: this is the
world of the *Rik*. And that glowing light is (the hymn of) the Great
Rite, the Sâman-tunes: this is the world of the Sâman. And the man in
yonder orb is the Fire-altar, the Ya*g*us-formulas: this is the world of
the Ya*g*us.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:2">10:5:2:2</span></span>2. It
is this threefold lore that shines, and even they who do not know this
say, 'This threefold lore does indeed shine;' for it is Speech that,
seeing it, speaks thus.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:3">10:5:2:3</span></span>3. And
that man in yonder (sun's) orb is no other than Death; and that glowing
light is that immortal element: therefore Death does not die, for he is
within the immortal; and therefore he is not seen, for he is within the
immortal <span id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_715).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:4">10:5:2:4</span></span>4.
There is this verse:--'Within Death is immortality,'--for below death is
immortality;--'founded on Death is immortality,'--for established on
that man (in the sun) the immortal shines <span
id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_716);--'Death putteth on the radiant,'--the

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

radiant one (vivasvant), doubtless, is yonder sun, for he irradiates
(vi-vas) day and night; and it is him that (Death) puts on, for on every
side he is surrounded by him;--'Death's self is in the radiant,'--for
the self (body) of that man indeed is in that orb: such, then, is that
verse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:5">10:5:2:5</span></span>5. Now,
that orb is the foundation (foothold) of both that light and that man;
whence one must not recite the Great Litany for another <span
id="fr_729"></span>[1](#fn_717), lest he should cut away that foothold
from beneath his own self; for he who recites the Mahad Uktham for
another, indeed cuts away that foothold from beneath his own self:
wherefore the (professional) singer of praises (*s*astra) is greatly
despised, for he is cut off from his foothold. Thus in regard to the
deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:6">10:5:2:6</span></span>6. Now
as to the sacrifice. That shining orb is the same as this gold plate
(under the altar) <span id="fr_730"></span>[2](#fn_718), and that
glowing light is the same as this lotus-leaf (under the altar); for
there are those (divine)

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

waters <span id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_719), and the lotus-leaf is
water <span id="fr_732"></span>[2](#fn_720); and that man in yonder orb
is no other than this gold man (in the altar): thus, by laying down
these (in the fire-altar), it is that (divine) triad he constructs. And
after the consummation of the sacrifice it rises upwards and enters that
shining (sun): one need not therefore mind destroying Agni, for he is
then in yonder (world) <span id="fr_733"></span>[3](#fn_721). Thus,
then, in regard to the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:7">10:5:2:7</span></span>7. Now
as to the self (body). That shining orb and that gold plate are the same
as the white here in the eye; and that glowing light and that lotus-leaf
are the same as the black here in the eye; and that man in yonder orb
and that gold man are the same as this man in the right eye.

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:8">10:5:2:8</span></span>8. The
Lokamp*rin*â (space-filling brick) is the same as that (gold man in the
sun) <span id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_722): it is that (brick) which
this entire Agni finally results in <span
id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_723). Moreover, this man (or person) in the
left eye is the mate of that one (in the right eye and in the sun); and
a mate is one half of one's own self <span
id="fr_736"></span>[3](#fn_724), for when one is with a mate he is whole
and complete: thus it (the second man) is for the sake of completeness.
And as to there being two of these (persons in the eyes), a pair means a
productive couple: hence two Lokamp*rin*âs are laid down each time <span
id="fr_737"></span>[4](#fn_725), and hence they set up the layer by two
(kinds of bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:9">10:5:2:9</span></span>9. Now,
that person in the right eye is the same as Indra, and (that other
person is) the same as Indrâ*n*î: it is for the sake of these two that
the gods made that partition (between the eyes), the nose; whence he
(the husband) should not eat food in the presence of his wife <span
id="fr_738"></span>[5](#fn_726); for from him (who

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

does not do so) a vigorous son is born, and she in whose presence (the
husband) does not eat food bears a vigorous (son):--

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:10">10:5:2:10</span></span>10.
Such, indeed, is the divine ordinance;--amongst men princes keep most
aloof <span id="fr_739"></span>[1](#fn_727), and for that reason a
vigorous (son) is born to them; and of birds the Am*ri*tavâkâ (does so,
and she) produces the Kshipra*s*yena <span
id="fr_740"></span>[2](#fn_728).

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:11">10:5:2:11</span></span>11.
Those two (persons in the eyes) descend to the cavity of the heart <span
id="fr_741"></span>[3](#fn_729), and enter into union with each other;
and when they reach the end of their union, then the man sleeps,--even
as here on reaching the end of a human union he becomes, as it were,
insensible <span id="fr_742"></span>[4](#fn_730), so does he then
become, as it were,

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

insensible; for this is a divine union <span
id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_731), and that is the highest bliss.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:12">10:5:2:12</span></span>12.
Therefore let him, who knows this, sleep, for it makes for heaven <span
id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_732): he thereby, indeed, makes those two
deities enjoy their dear wish, union. And one should not therefore
forcibly <span id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_733) awaken him who sleeps,
lest he should hurt those two deities whilst enjoying their union; and
hence the mouth of him who has been asleep is, as it were, clammy, for
those two deities are then shedding seed, and from that seed everything
here originates, whatsoever exists.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:13">10:5:2:13</span></span>13.
Now, that man in yonder orb (of the sun), and that man in the right eye
truly are no other than Death;--his feet have stuck fast in the heart,
and having pulled them out he comes forth; and when he comes forth then
that man dies: whence they say of him who has passed away, 'he has been
cut off <span id="fr_746"></span>[4](#fn_734).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:14">10:5:2:14</span></span>14.
And, indeed, he is the breath (prâ*n*a), for it is he (the man in the
eye) that leads forward (pra*n*ayati) all these creatures. These vital
airs (prâ*n*a) are his own (sva); and when he sleeps (svapiti) then

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

these vital airs take possession of him <span
id="fr_747"></span>[1](#fn_735) as his own (svâ api-yanti): hence (the
term) 'svâpyaya (being taken possession of by one's own people),'
'svâpyaya' doubtless being what they mystically call 'svapna (sleep),'
for the gods love the mystic.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:15">10:5:2:15</span></span>15.
And when he is asleep, he does not, by means of them, know of anything
whatever, nor does he form any resolution with his mind, or distinguish
the taste of food with (the channel of) his speech, or distinguish any
smell with (the channel of) his breath; neither does he see with his
eye, nor hear with his ear, for those (vital airs) have taken possession
of him. Whilst being one only, he (the man in the eye) is numerously
distributed among living beings: whence the Lokamp*rin*â (representing
the man in the sun), whilst being one only (in kind), extends over the
whole altar; and because he (the man in the eye) is one only, therefore
(the Lokamp*rin*â) is one.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:16">10:5:2:16</span></span>16.
As to this they say, 'One death, or many?' Let him say, 'Both one and
many;' for inasmuch as he is that (man in the sun) in yonder world he is
one, and inasmuch as he is numerously distributed here on earth among
living beings, there are also many of them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:17">10:5:2:17</span></span>17.
As to this they say, 'Is Death near or far away?' Let him say, 'Both
near and far away;' for inasmuch as he is here on earth in the body he
is near, and inasmuch as he is that one in yonder world he also is far
away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:18">10:5:2:18</span></span>18.
Regarding this there is the verse,--'Concealed

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

in food he, the immortal, shineth at the flowing together of vital
saps;'--yonder shining orb is food, and the man in that orb is the
eater: being concealed in that food, he shines. Thus much as to the
deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:19">10:5:2:19</span></span>19.
Now as to the body. This body indeed is food, and that man in the right
eye is the eater: being concealed in that food he shines.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:20">10:5:2:20</span></span>20.
That same (divine person), the Adhvaryus (Ya*g*ur-veda priests) serve
under the name of 'Agni' (fire-altar) and 'Ya*g*us,' because he holds
together (yu*g*) all this (universe) <span
id="fr_748"></span>[1](#fn_736); the *Kh*andogas (Sâma-veda priests,
chanters) under that of 'Sâman,' because in him all this (universe) is
one and the same (samâna) <span id="fr_749"></span>[2](#fn_737); the
Bahv*rik*as (*Ri*g-veda priests, Hotars) under that of 'Uktham,' because
he originates (utthâp) everything here; those skilled in sorcery, under
that of 'sorcery (yâtu),' because everything here is held in check
(yata) by him; the serpents under that of 'poison;' the snake-charmers
under that of 'snake;' the gods under that of 'ûr*g* (strengthening
food);' men under that of 'wealth;' demons under that of 'mâyâ (magic
power);' the deceased Fathers under that of 'svadhâ (invigorating
draught);' those knowing the divine host under that of 'divine host;'
the Gandharvas under that of 'form (rûpa <span
id="fr_750"></span>[3](#fn_738));' the Apsaras under that of 'fragrance
(gandha),'--thus, in whatsoever form they serve him that indeed he
becomes, and, having become that,

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

he is helpful to them; whence he who knows should serve him in all these
(forms), for he becomes all that, and, having become all that, he is
helpful to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:21">10:5:2:21</span></span>21.
Now this Agni (fire-altar) consists of three bricks,--the *Rik* being
one, the Ya*g*us another, and the Sâman another: whatever (brick) he
lays down here with a *ri*k (verse) that has the gold plate for its
foundation <span id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_739); whatever (brick he
lays down) with a ya*g*us (formula) that has the (gold) man for its
foundation; and whatever (brick he lays down) with a sâman (hymn-tune)
that has the lotus-leaf for its foundation. Thus he consists of three
bricks.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:22">10:5:2:22</span></span>22.
And, indeed, these two, to wit, that gold plate and that lotus-leaf join
that (gold) man, for both the *Rik* and the Sâman join the Ya*g*us; and
so he also consists of a single brick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:5:2:23">10:5:2:23</span></span>23.
Now, that man in yonder orb (of the sun), and this man in the right eye,
are no other than Death <span id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_740); and he
becomes the body (self) of him who knows this: whenever he who knows
departs this world he passes into that body, and becomes immortal, for
Death is his own self.

ma*nd*alasya *g*agatprakâ*s*akatvam asti. Sây. But for this
interpretation, one might have rendered the first pâda by, 'Close unto
death is immortality,' for after death comes immortality.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[367:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_729) Cf. Aitareyâr. V,
3, 3, 1, 'No one but a dîkshita (initiated) should recite the Mahâvrata
(*s*astra); and he should not recite it at a (Mahâvrata) unless it be
combined with (the building of) a fire-altar; neither should he do so
for another person, nor at a (sacrificial session lasting) less than a
year,' so say some; but he may recite it for his father or for his
teacher, for in that case it is recited on his own behalf.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[367:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_730) In these symbolical
identifications, one might also take the relative clause to be the
predicate, not the subject, of the sentence; the former usually
preceding the latter.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[368:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_731) Though the sun
itself does not consist of water, he at any rate floats along a sea of
water; cf. VII, 5, 1, 8, 'For that indeed is the deepest of waters where
yonder sun shines;' and there are waters above and below the sun, VII,
1, 1, 24; and the sun is encircled by 360 navigable streams, and as many
flow towards it, [X, 5, 4, 14](sbe4369.htm#10:5:4:14).--Sâya*n*a, on the
other hand, takes it to mean, 'for that (light) is water,' inasmuch as
the sun's rays produce the rain,--ar*k*isho hy âpa*h* sûryakira*n*ânâm
eva v*ri*sh*t*ikart*ri*katvât kâryakâranayor abhedena ar*k*ir vâ âpa ity
uktam. Possibly this may be the right interpretation.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[368:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_732) See VII, 4, 1, 8,
where the lotus-plant is said to represent the (cosmic) waters, whilst
the earth is a lotus-leaf floating on the waters.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[368:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_733) According to
Sâya*n*a, he is so in the shape of both the sun and the Sacrificer's
body or self,--yato<sup>ऽ</sup>sminn agni*m* *k*itavân paratrâdityo
bhavati, ato<sup>ऽ</sup>gni*m* parihantu*m* nâdriyeta, *k*i*t*am agnim
ish*t*akâvi*s*eshe*n*a nâ*s*ayitam âdara*m* na *k*uryât, kuta*h*,

sprash*t*um ity artha*h*, *k*ityâgnispar*s*ane dosha*s*rava*n*ât.
Sâya*n*a, thus, is doubtful as to how 'Agnim parihantum' is to be taken,
whether it means 'to injure the altar (? or extinguish the fire) by some
brick,' or to 'knock against (touch) the altar.' The St. Petersb. Dict.
takes it in the sense of 'to extinguish the fire,' <span
id="page_369">p. 369</span> but it might also, perhaps, mean, 'to
destroy the fire-altar' by taking it to pieces.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[369:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_734) On the
identification of the sun with the Lokamp*rin*â on the ground that the
former fills these worlds (lokân pûrayati), see [VIII, 7, 2,
1](sbe4327.htm#8:7:2:1).

<span id="fn_723"></span>[369:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_735) Or, finally comes
to; viz. inasmuch as it is by the placing of the Lokamp*rin*â bricks
that the altar is completed (Sây.); and inasmuch as Agni passes into the
sun.

<span id="fn_724"></span>[369:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_736) Purusho mithuna*m*
yoshid ity etasmin mithuna*m* hy âtmano<sup>ऽ</sup>rdham ardhabhâga*h*,
ardho vâ esha âtmano yat patnîti taittirîya*s*rute*h*. Sây.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[369:4](sbe4367.htm#fr_737) When the layers are
filled up with 'space-fillers,' two Lokamp*rin*âs are first laid down in
one of the four corners, and from them the available spaces are then
filled up, in two turns, in the sunwise direction; cf. [p.
22](sbe4306.htm#page_22), note [1](sbe4307.htm#fn_73).

<span id="fn_726"></span>[369:5](sbe4367.htm#fr_738) Cf. I, 9, 2, 12,
'whenever women here eat, they do so apart from men;' where the use of
the '*g*ighatsanti' (swallow their <span id="page_370">p. 370</span>
food)--as against a*s*nîyât in our passage--is not meant
disrespectfully, but as the regular desiderative of 'ad' (Pâ*n*. II, 4,
37), for which no doubt 'a*s*i*s*ishanti' (Sat. Br. III, 1, 2, 1) might
have been used.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[370:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_739) Or, 'act most in
secrecy.' Sâya*n*a explains it: manushyâ*n*â*m* madhye
râ*g*anyabandhavo<sup>ऽ</sup>nutamâ*m* gopâyanti atyartha*m*
rahasyatvena kurvanti tasmât teshu viryavân putro *g*âyate. The St.
Petersb. Dict., on the other hand, takes it in the sense of 'they
protect most of all;' though it is difficult to see how the,
'protection' afforded by princes or rulers could have any bearing on men
taking their food apart from their wives. If the above interpretation is
right we may compare 'anu-gup' in the sense of 'to conceal.' See,
however, the next note, where Sâya*n*a takes 'gopâyati' in the sense of
'observes (that law),' which might also have suited here. Princes,
having their seraglio, would naturally have less occasion for coming
into contact with their wives at mealtime than men of lower stations of
life. On the superlative of the preposition, see [p.
287](sbe4346.htm#page_287), note [1](sbe4346.htm#fn_531).

<span id="fn_728"></span>[370:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_740) ? The swift
eagle,--vayasâm pakshi*n*âm madhye am*ri*tavâkâ nâma pakshi*g*âtir etad
vrata*m* gopâyati, ata*h* sâ kshipra*m* *s*îghragâmina*m* *s*yena*m*
nâma pakshi*n*a*m* *g*anayati. Sây.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[370:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_741)
H*ri*dayasyâkâ*s*a*m* daharam prâpya. Sây.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[370:4](sbe4367.htm#fr_742) That is,
'unconscious,' with something of 'indifferent, apathetic,'
implied:--Loke mânushasya maithunasyânta*m* gatvâ<sup>ऽ</sup> sa*m*vidâ
<span id="page_371">p. 371</span> a*g*ânâneva nrâ strî bhavati (marg.
corr. a*g*ânânâv eva strîpurushau bhavata*h*) eva*m* tadâ tayor

Sây.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[371:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_743) Viz. because it is
the union of Indra and Indrâ*n*î.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[371:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_744) Or, perhaps, it is
the usual practice (lokyam), as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[371:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_745) Dhureva pî*d*ayaiva
na bodhayet, na prabuddha*m* kuryât, dhûrvater hi*m*sârthat kvipi
*t*âblope rûpam. Sây.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[371:4](sbe4367.htm#fr_746) ? His (life) has
been cut off; or, his (life-string) has been severed. Sâya*n*a (unless
there is an omission in the MS.) does not explain '*k*â*kh*edy asya,'
but seems to take 'pretam' (passed away) as the word on which the stress
lies:--tasmâd imam pretam ity âhu*h*, prapûrvâd ete*h* ktapratyaye
rûpam; katham, akshipurushanirgame purushasya mara*n*am.

<span id="fn_735"></span>[372:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_747) Or, they keep
within him, they nestle in him,--apiyanti prâpnuvanti, âliyanta ity
artha*h*. Sây.

<span id="fn_736"></span>[373:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_748) Esha purusha ida*m*
sarva*m* *g*agad yunakti sarvatra svaya*m* sa*m*gata iti. Sây.

<span id="fn_737"></span>[373:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_749) Etasmin paramâtmani
kâra*n*e sarva*m* kârya*g*âta*m* samânam iti. Sây.

<span id="fn_738"></span>[373:3](sbe4367.htm#fr_750) The characteristic
attributes of the Gandharvas and Apsaras are evidently exchanged in the
text as it stands; cf. [IX, 4, 1, 4](sbe4339.htm#9:4:1:4).

<span id="fn_739"></span>[374:1](sbe4367.htm#fr_751) Viz. inasmuch as
the (round) gold plate (representing the sun) is deposited in the centre
of the altar-site, before the first layer is constructed. In the same
way the other two objects.

<span id="fn_740"></span>[374:2](sbe4367.htm#fr_752) Sâya*n*a seems to
construe this somewhat differently: sa esho gnir
ya*g*urâtmako<sup>ऽ</sup>dhidaiva*m* ma*nd*alamadhyavartî adhyâtma*m*
dakshi*n*âkshivartî purusho m*ri*tyurûpa*h*.
