### FOURTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:1">10:4:1:1</span></span>1. When
the gods restored the relaxed Pra*g*âpati, they poured him, as seed,
into the fire-pan (ukhâ) as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb. In the
course of a year they prepared for him this food, to wit, the fire-altar
built here, and enclosed it in a body; and, being enclosed in a body, it
became the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a body, becomes
the body itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:2">10:4:1:2</span></span>2. In
like manner does the Sacrificer now pour his own self (or body), as
seed, into the fire-pan as the womb, for the fire-pan is a womb. In the
course of a year he prepares for it (his self) this food, to wit, the
fire-altar here built, and encloses it in a body, and, being enclosed in
a body, it becomes the body itself; whence food, when enclosed in a
body, becomes the body itself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:3">10:4:1:3</span></span>3. He
places him (the Ukhya Agni, on the fire-altar) with 'Vausha*t* <span
id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_660)!' for 'vauk' is he (Agni),

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

and 'sha*t* (six)' is this six-layered food: having prepared it, he
offers it to him as proportionate to this body, for food which is
proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when
there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it
does not satisfy it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:4">10:4:1:4</span></span>4. Now
that Arka <span id="fr_671"></span>[1](#fn_661) (flame) is this very
fire which they bring here; and the Kya <span
id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_661) is this his food, to wit, the fire-altar
built here: that (combined) makes the Arkya <span
id="fr_673"></span>[2](#fn_662) in respect of the Ya*g*us. And the Great
one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this vrata <span
id="fr_674"></span>[3](#fn_663) (rite) is his food: that makes the
Mahâvrata (sâman) in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and
'tha' his food,--that (combined) makes the Uktha (*s*astra,
recitation) <span id="fr_675"></span>[4](#fn_664) in respect of the
*Ri*k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:5">10:4:1:5</span></span>5. Now
Indra and Agni were created as the Brahman (priesthood) and the Kshatra
(nobility): the Brahman was Agni and the Kshatra Indra. When created,
the two were separate. They spake, 'Whilst being thus, we shall be
unable to produce creatures (people): let us both become one form!' The
two became one form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:6">10:4:1:6</span></span>6. Now
those two, Indra and Agni, are the same as these two, to wit, the gold
plate and the (gold) man <span id="fr_676"></span>[5](#fn_665): Indra is
the gold plate, and Agni the man.

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They are made of
gold: gold means light, and Indra and Agni are the light; gold means
immortal life, and Indra and Agni mean immortal life.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:7">10:4:1:7</span></span>7. It
is these two, Indra and Agni, that they build up. Whatever is of brick
that is Agni: whence they bake that (part) by fire, and all that is
baked by fire is Agni. And what filling of earth there is (in the altar)
that. is Indra: whence they do not bake that (part) by fire, lest it
should be Agni, and not Indra. Thus it is these two, Indra and Agni,
that are built up.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:8">10:4:1:8</span></span>8. And
the two become that one form, to wit, the fire which is placed on the
built (altar), and hence those two, by means of that form, produce
creatures. Now Agni, indeed, is this single brick <span
id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_666), and into this the whole Agni passes:
this, indeed, is the perfection of bricks,--it is that one syllable
(akshara) 'vauk,' it is this into which the whole Agni passes, and which
is the perfection of syllables.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:9">10:4:1:9</span></span>9. It
is this that the *Ri*shi saw when he said, 'I praise what hath been and
what will be, the Great Brahman, the one Akshara,--the manifold Brahman,
the one Akshara; for, indeed, all the gods, all beings pass into that
Akshara (imperishable

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

element <span id="fr_678"></span>[1](#fn_667)): it is both the Brahman
and the Kshatra; and the Brahman is Agni, and the Kshatra Indra; and the
Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* (all the gods) are Indra and Agni.' But the Vi*s*ve
Devâ*h* (the All-gods) are also the peasantry: hence it is Priesthood,
Nobility, and Peasantry.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:10">10:4:1:10</span></span>10.
And, indeed, *S*yâpar*n*a Sâyakâyana, knowing this, once said, 'If this
my sacrificial performance were complete, my own race would become the
kings (nobles), Brâhma*n*as, and peasants of the Salvas; but even by
that much of my work which has been completed <span
id="fr_679"></span>[2](#fn_668) my race will surpass the Salvas in both
ways;'--for this (Agni, the fire-altar), indeed, is (social) eminence
and fame, and an eater of food <span id="fr_680"></span>[3](#fn_669).

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:11">10:4:1:11</span></span>11.
And regarding this, Sâ*nd*ilya, having instructed Vâmakakshâya*n*a <span
id="fr_681"></span>[1](#fn_670), said, 'Thou wilt become eminent,
famous, and an eater of food (rich);' and, indeed, he who knows this
becomes eminent, famous, and an eater of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:12">10:4:1:12</span></span>12.
And this Agni is no other than Pra*g*âpati.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The gods, having
restored this Agni-Pra*g*âpati, in the course of a year prepared this
food for him, to wit, this Mahâvratîya cup of Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:13">10:4:1:13</span></span>13.
The Adhvaryu draws it by means of a cup, and inasmuch as he draws (grah)
it, it is (called) a draught (graha, cup of Soma). The Udgât*ri*
(chanter), by the Mahâvrata (sâman), puts flavour (vital sap) into it;
and the Mahâvrata (sâman) being (composed of) all those (five) sâmans,
he thus puts flavour into it by means of all sâmans (hymn-tunes). The
Hot*ri* puts flavour into it by means of the Great Recitation; and the
Great Recitation being (composed of) all those *Ri*k-verses: he thus
puts flavour into it by all the *Ri*k-verses.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:14">10:4:1:14</span></span>14.
And when they chant the hymn, and he (the Hot*ri*) afterwards recites
(the *s*astra) <span id="fr_682"></span>[1](#fn_671), he (the Adhvaryu)
offers that (cup of Soma) to him (Agni-Pra*g*âpati) as the Vasha*t*-call
is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and 'sha*t*' this sixfold
food <span id="fr_683"></span>[2](#fn_672): having prepared it, he
offers it to him as proportionate to his body; for food which is
proportionate to the body satisfies, and does not injure it; but when
there is too much, it does injure it, and when there is too little, it
does not satisfy it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:15">10:4:1:15</span></span>15.
Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

built here; and the Kya is this his food, to wit, the Mahâvratîya-graha:
that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the Ya*g*us. And the Great
one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that
makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni),
and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the
*Ri*k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted threefold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:16">10:4:1:16</span></span>16.
And this Agni is Pra*g*âpati, the year <span
id="fr_684"></span>[1](#fn_673): the Sâvitra (oblations) are one half
thereof, and the Vai*s*va-karma*n*a (oblations) <span
id="fr_685"></span>[2](#fn_674) the (other) half; the Sâvitra are eight
digits (kalâ <span id="fr_686"></span>[3](#fn_675)) thereof, and the
Vai*s*vakarma*n*a (the other) eight; and that which is performed between
them is the seventeenfold Pra*g*âpati. Now what a digit is to men that a
syllable (akshara) is to the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:17">10:4:1:17</span></span>17.
And 'loma (hair)' is two syllables, 'tvak <span
id="fr_687"></span>[4](#fn_676) (skin)' two, 'as*ri*k (blood)' two,
'medas (fat)' two, 'mâ*m*sam (flesh)' two, 'snâva (sinew)' two, 'asthi
(bone)' two, 'ma*gg*â (marrow) <span id="fr_688"></span>[5](#fn_677)'
two,--that makes sixteen digits; and the vital air which circulates
therein, is the seventeenfold Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:18">10:4:1:18</span></span>18.
These sixteen digits convey the food to that vital air; and when they
take to conveying no food to it, then it consumes them and departs (from
the body): hence he who is hungry here, feels very

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

restless, consumed as he is by his vital airs; and hence he who suffers
from fever becomes very thin, for he is consumed by his vital airs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:19">10:4:1:19</span></span>19.
Now for that seventeenfold Pra*g*âpati they prepared this seventeenfold
food, the Soma-sacrifice: those sixteen digits of his are these sixteen
officiating priests,--one should not, therefore, take a seventeenth
priest <span id="fr_689"></span>[1](#fn_678) lest one should do what is
excessive;--and what vital sap there is here--the oblations that are
offered--that is the seventeenfold food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:20">10:4:1:20</span></span>20.
And when they chant the hymn, and when he (the Hot*ri*) afterwards
recites (the *s*astra), he (the Adhvaryu) offers to him that food as the
Vasha*t*-call is uttered. Now 'vauk' is this (Agni), and 'sha*t*' this
sixfold food: having prepared it, he offers it to him as proportionate
to his body; for food which is proportionate to the body satisfies, and
does not injure it; but when there is too much it does injure it, and
when there is too little, it does not satisfy it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:21">10:4:1:21</span></span>21.
Now that Arka (flame) is this very fire-altar built here; and the Kya is
this his food, to wit, the Soma-sacrifice: that (combined) makes the
Arkya in respect of the Ya*g*us. And the Great one (mahân) is this
(Agni), and this rite (vrata) is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in
respect of the Sâman. And 'uk' is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that
makes the (Mahad) Uktha in respect of the *Ri*k. Thus, whilst being only
one, this is accounted threefold. With this food he went upwards; and he
who

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

went upwards is yonder sun, and that food wherewith he went up is that
moon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:22">10:4:1:22</span></span>22.
He who shines yonder is indeed that Arka (flame), and that moon is his
food, the Kya: that (combined) makes the Arkya in respect of the
Ya*g*us. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata)
is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk'
is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in
respect of the *Ri*k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted
threefold. Thus much as to the deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:4:1:23">10:4:1:23</span></span>23.
Now as to the body. The Arka (flame), doubtless, is the breath (vital
air), and the Kya is its food: that makes the Arkya in respect of the
Ya*g*us. And the Great one (mahân) is this (Agni), and this rite (vrata)
is his food: that makes the Mahâvrata in respect of the Sâman. And 'uk'
is this (Agni), and 'tha' his food: that makes the (Mahad) Uktha in
respect of the *Ri*k. Thus, whilst being only one, this is accounted
threefold. And, indeed, that (Agni) is that (sun) as to the deity, and
this (breath) as to the body.

<span id="fn_660"></span>[341:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_670) See [IX, 2, 3,
35](sbe4334.htm#9:2:3:35), where it was stated that the fire should be
laid down with the Vasha*t*-call ('vausha*t*!') uttered after the two
verses, Vâ*g*. S. XVII, 72. 73. Here, as at I, 7, 2, 21, the sacrificial
call, 'vausha*t*'--for 'vasha*t*,' apparently an irregular subjunctive
aorist of 'vah': 'may he bear (the oblation to the gods)!'--is
fancifully explained as composed of 'vauk' (i.e. vâk, speech), and
'sha*t*,' six.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[342:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_672) See [X, 3, 4,
2](sbe4359.htm#10:3:4:2) seq.

<span id="fn_662"></span>[342:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_673) That is, what
relates to the Arka (the Fire, or Agni*k*ayana).

<span id="fn_663"></span>[342:3](sbe4361.htm#fr_674) That is, here, the
Mahad uktham, or Great Recitation of the Mahâvrata day.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[342:4](sbe4361.htm#fr_675) Perhaps with the
implied sense of 'fast-food,' 'fast-milk,' the milk taken by the
Sacrificer during the initiation as his only food.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[342:5](sbe4361.htm#fr_676) For the gold plate
worn by the Sacrificer whilst carrying about <span id="page_343">p.
343</span> the Ukhya Agni, and ultimately deposited on the lotus-leaf in
the centre of the altar-site before the first layer is laid down, see
VI, 7, I, 1 seq.; VII, 4, 1, 10 seq. For the gold man placed on the gold
plate, VII, 4, 1, 15 seq. Whilst the gold man was indeed identified with
Agni-Pra*g*âpati, as well as with the Sacrificer, the gold plate was
taken throughout as representing the sun.

<span id="fn_666"></span>[343:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_677) According to
Sâya*n*a, this one brick is the syllable ('akshara,' which also means
'the imperishable, indestructible') 'vauk' contained in the 'Vausha*t*,'
uttered when the sacred fire is placed on the newly-built altar.

<span id="fn_667"></span>[344:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_678) Aksharam
avina*s*vara*m* sarvagata*m* vâ brahma sa*kk*idânandaikarasam. Sâya*n*a.

<span id="fn_668"></span>[344:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_679) Or, perhaps--but
since so much of my work has been completed, my race will thereby
surpass the Salvas. Cf. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 266.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[344:3](sbe4361.htm#fr_680) Sâya*n*a takes this
as intended to explain the 'in both' ways' of the quotation, viz. in
regard to '*s*rî' (social distinction) on the one hand, and to 'ya*s*as'
(fame) and food (material prosperity) on the other. There is, however,
nothing in the text to favour any such grouping of the distinctive
objects of aspiration associated with the three classes
(var*n*atrayâtmakatvam upa*g*ivya karma*n*a*h*,
*s*rîya*s*o<sup>ऽ</sup>nnâdalaksha*n*a*m* phalam. Sâya*n*a), or with men
generally (cf. Aitareyâr. I, 4, 2, 10). Perhaps it means both in an
intellectual and material point of view. The Syâpar*n*as seem to have
been a rather self-assertive family of priests. The Aitareya Brâhma*n*a
tells the following story about them (VII, 27):--Vi*s*vantara
Saushadmana, setting aside the *S*yâpar*n*as, got up a sacrifice without
them. The Syâpar*n*as, becoming aware of this, came to the sacrifice and
sat them down inside the sacrificial ground. On seeing them,
Vi*s*vantara said, 'There sit those doers of evil deeds, those speakers
of foul language, the Syâpar*n*as: turn them out let them not sit inside
my sacrificial ground!'--'So be it!' they said, and <span
id="page_345">p. 345</span> turned them out. In being turned out, they
cried aloud, 'At a sacrifice of *G*aname*g*aya, son of Parikshit,
performed without the Ka*s*yapas, the Asitam*ri*gas from amongst the
Ka*s*yapas won the Soma-drink from the Bhûtavîras (who were
officiating). In them they had heroic men on their side: what hero is
there amongst us who will win that Soma-drink?'--'Here is that hero of
yours,' said Râma Mârgaveya. Râma Mârgaveya was a *S*yâpar*n*îya,
learned in sacred lore. When they rose to leave, he said, 'O king, will
they turn out of the sacrificial ground even one so learned as
me?'--'Whoever thou art, what knowest thou, vile Brâhman?'--'When the
gods turned Indra away because he had outraged Tvash*tri*'s son
Vi*s*varûpa, and laid low V*ri*tra, and thrown devotees before the
jackals, and slain the Arurmaghas, and retorted on B*ri*haspati (the
teacher of the gods)--then Indra was deprived of the Soma-cup; and along
with him the Kshatriyas were deprived of the Soma-cup. By stealing the
Soma from Tvash*tri*, Indra obtained a share in the Soma-cup, but to
this day the Kshatriyas are deprived of the Soma-cup: how can they turn
out from the sacrificial ground one who knows how the Kshatriya race can
be put in possession of the Soma-cup from which they are
deprived?'--'Knowest thou (how to procure) that drink, O Brâhman?'--'I
know it indeed.'--'Tell us then, O Brahman?'--'To thee, O king, I will
tell it,' he said. Ultimately the *S*yâpar*n*as are reinstated in their
sacrificial duties. Cf. R. Roth, Zur Litteratur and Geschichte des Weda,
p. 118. At VI, 2, I, 39, Syâpar*n*a Sâyakâyana was stated to have been
the last who was in the habit of immolating five victims instead of two,
as became afterwards the custom.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[345:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_681) In the succession
of teachers of the doctrine of the fire-altar, given at the end of the
present Kâ*nd*a, Vâmakakshâya*n*a is said to have received his
instruction from Vâtsya, and the latter from *S*â*nd*ilya, who, in his
turn, received it from Ku*s*ri. Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. I, p. 259.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[346:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_682) Viz. the Mahad
uktham (see [p. 110](sbe4324.htm#page_110), note
[3](sbe4324.htm#fn_202)), preceded by the chanting of the
Mahâvrata-sâman (see [p. 362](sbe4364.htm#page_362), note
[5](sbe4364.htm#fn_706)) (p. 382 originally--JBH).

<span id="fn_672"></span>[346:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_683) That is, according
as it is flavoured by the six different 'rasas' (flavours or
tastes)--sweet (madhura), sour (amla), salt (lava*n*a), pungent
(ka*t*uka), bitter (tikta), and astringent (kashâya). Thus according to
Sâya*n*a; but see also [paragraph 3](sbe4361.htm#10:4:1:3), where the
sixfold nature of the food is identified with the six-layered altar.
Perhaps both explanations are intended to apply.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[347:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_684) Or, perhaps, this
Pra*g*âpati-Agni is the year.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[347:2](sbe4361.htm#fr_685) For these two sets
of formulas and oblations, see [IX, 5, 1, 43](sbe4343.htm#9:5:1:43) and
note.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[347:3](sbe4361.htm#fr_686) A 'kalâ' is the
sixteenth part of the moon's diameter, and then a sixteenth part
generally.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[347:4](sbe4361.htm#fr_687) Pronounce 'tu-ak.'

<span id="fn_677"></span>[347:5](sbe4361.htm#fr_688) For five of these
parts of the body, see [X, 1, 3, 4](sbe4347.htm#10:1:3:4).

<span id="fn_678"></span>[348:1](sbe4361.htm#fr_689) This prohibition is
probably directed against the Kaushîtakins, who recognise a seventeenth
officiating priest, the Sadasya, who seems to have taken no other part
in the sacrificial performance except sitting in the Sadas as the
permanent custodian thereof.
