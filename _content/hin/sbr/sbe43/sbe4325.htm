<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:1">8:6:3:1</A></FONT></span>1. He lays down the G&acirc;rhapatya. For the gods, having obtained this much, thought they had succeeded. They spake, 'Whereby have we succeeded in this?'--'By means of the G&acirc;rhapatya,' they said; 'for, after building the G&acirc;rhapatya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and mounting thereon, we saw the first layer, from the first (we saw) the second, from the second the third, from the third the fourth, from the fourth the fifth, and from the fifth this one.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:2">8:6:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how there may be success here for us!' They spake, 'Meditate ye (<I>k</I>it)!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer (<I>k</I>iti)! seek ye whereby there may be success here for us!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:3">8:6:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. Whilst meditating, they said this: 'Let us bring this one here and put it on (the fire-altar)!' Having brought this (G&acirc;rhapatya) here, they put it</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A></p>  
<p>on. They disputed about it:--in the front part (of the fifth layer) the Vasus, on the right side the Rudras, on the hind part the &Acirc;dityas, on the left side the Maruts, and above it the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;s said. 'Here let us lay it down! here. let us lay it down!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:4">8:6:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. They spake, 'Let us lay it down in the middle: when laid down in our midst, it will belong to all of us.' They laid it down in the middle (of the fifth layer), and thus they laid that success into the self (or the body of the altar);--in the middle (they laid it): they thus laid that success into the very middle of (Agni's and their own) self. And in like manner does the Sacrificer, when he lays down the G&acirc;rhapatya, lay that success into (his own) self; and (by laying it down) in the middle, he lays that success into the very middle of the self.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:5">8:6:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. And, again, as to why he lays down the G&acirc;rhapatya. The G&acirc;rhapatya, doubtless, is food, and this built Agni is an eater: it is to the eater he thus offers that food;--in the centre (he lays down the G&acirc;rhapatya): in the very middle (of the body) he thus lays food into him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:6">8:6:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. And, again, as to why he lays down the G&acirc;rhapatya. The world of the gods, doubtless, is the Vedi (altar-ground); but that (original G&acirc;rhapatya) is built up outside the Vedi: thus, when he brings it here and lays it down (on the fire-altar), he then establishes it (or him, Agni) on the Vedi, in the world of the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:7">8:6:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. And, again, as to why he lays down the G&acirc;rhapatya. The lotus-leaf&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, doubtless, is a womb, but</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A></p>  
<p>that (G&acirc;rhapatya) is built up outside the womb, and outside of the womb indeed takes place that performance regarding the fire-altar which takes place prior to the (laying down of the) lotus-leaf: thus, when they bring it (the G&acirc;rhapatya) here and lay it down, he then establishes it in the womb. on the lotus-leaf; and thus indeed it is not outside. Eight bricks he lays down: the significance of this has been explained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. He builds it up with the same formulas and in the same order, for this one is the same as that (former G&acirc;rhapatya Agni) he thus brings it (or him) here and lays it down.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:8">8:6:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. He then lays down the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>. Now at that time the gods, having built the G&acirc;rhapatya, did not find success therein; for the G&acirc;rhapatya pile is a womb, and success in a womb consists in seed, in generative power; and in this womb they saw no seed, no generative power.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:9">8:6:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. They spake, 'Think ye upon this, how we may lay seed and generative power into this womb!' They spake, 'Meditate ye!' whereby, indeed, they meant to say, 'Seek ye a layer! seek ye that we may lay seed and generative power into this womb!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:10">8:6:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Whilst meditating, they saw this Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti, and put it on (the G&acirc;rhapatya), and thereby laid seed and generative power into this womb;--in the centre (they placed it): they thus laid seed and</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A></p>  
<p>generative power into the very middle of this womb. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now, when he lays down the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti, lay seed and generative power into this womb;--in the centre (he lays it down): he thus lays seed and generative power into the very middle of this womb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:11">8:6:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. Now some lay it down on the hind part (of the bird-like altar), because it is from the hind part that seed is introduced,--(to wit) on the juncture of the tail (and the body), for it is from (the part near) the tail that seed is introduced. Let him not do this, for they who do this lay seed and generative power outside the womb; but let him rather place it in the centre: he thus lays seed and generative power right into the womb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:12">8:6:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. He lays down eight bricks,--the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; (metre) consists of eight syllables, and Agni (the fire-altar) is of G&acirc;yatr&icirc; nature: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus introduces him in the form of seed. Five times he 'settles' it,--of five layers consists the fire-altar, five seasons make a year, and Agni is the year: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, by so much he thus introduces him in the form of seed. Eight bricks he 'settles' five times, that makes thirteen,--thirteen months make a year, and there are thirteen 'layer-fillings' of the altar: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great he thus becomes.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:13">8:6:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. And as to why he lays down the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti. Now, in laying down the G&acirc;rhapatya (hearth) upon the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, he surely does what is improper; but when he lays down the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti he thereby brings this Agni (or altar) that has been built, and builds it up again thereon; and because he again</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_121"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 121</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (punas) builds up (<I>k</I>i) that (Agni) already built, therefore (this is called) Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:14">8:6:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. Now some lay down the G&acirc;rhapatya on the hind part, and the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti on the front part (of the built altar), for these two are the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya and the G&acirc;rhapatya, and these two fires are (placed) in this way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_216"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Let him not do this, for the G&acirc;rhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, and the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya is the sky; and above this (earth) surely is yonder (sky); let him therefore place it (the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti) on the top of that (G&acirc;rhapatya).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:15">8:6:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. And as to why he lays down both the G&acirc;rhapatya and the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti. These two, doubtless, are the Vedi and the Uttaravedi (high-altar) of Agni. Now those two former (altars of this kind) which he throws up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_218"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> belong to the Soma-sacrifice, but these belong to the fire-altar; and when, after laying down these two; he deposits Agni (the fire) thereon, then he establishes him both on the Vedi and the Uttaravedi.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:16">8:6:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. And, again, as to why he lays down the Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti. This, doubtless, is a repeated sacrifice (punarya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a), and higher (than the ordinary sacrifice) is this worship of the gods: he thus sets up a repeated sacrifice, and the higher worship of the gods; and the repeated sacrifice inclines (accrues) to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8:6:3:17">8:6:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. And, again, as to why he lays down the</p>

He now builds him up again; and inasmuch as he again (punas) builds up (<I>k</I>i) that (Agni) already built, therefore also it is (called) Puna<I>s</I><I>k</I>iti.</p>
