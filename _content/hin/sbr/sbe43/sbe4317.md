### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:1">8:4:3:1</span></span>1. He
then lays down the Srish*t*is <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_142)
(creations). For Pra*g*âpati, having freed all beings from evil,

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

from death, he now desired, 'May I produce creatures, may I procreate!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:2">8:4:3:2</span></span>2. He
spake unto the vital airs <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_143),
'Together with you, I will here bring forth creatures!'--'Wherewith
shall we sing praises <span id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_144)?'--'With me
and with

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

yourselves!'--'So be it!' So they sang praises both with the vital airs
and with Pra*g*âpati; and whatsoever the gods do, that they do with
praise, that--praise being sacrifice--they do with sacrifice. Hence (the
words) 'they sang praises' recur with all (these bricks).

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:3">8:4:3:3</span></span>3. \[They
lay them down, with, Vâ*g*. S. XIV, 2831\], 'With one they sang
praises,'--the one, doubtless, is speech: it is with speech they then
sang praises;--'creatures were conceived,'--creatures indeed were now
conceived;--'Pra*g*âpati was the lord!'--Pra*g*âpati indeed was now the
lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:4">8:4:3:4</span></span>4. 'With
three they sang praises,'--there are three vital airs: the
out-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is with
them they then sang praises;--'the Brahman was created,'--the priesthood
indeed was now created;--'Brahma*n*aspati was the lord!' Brahma*n*aspati
indeed was now the lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:5">8:4:3:5</span></span>5. 'With
five they sang praises,'--what (four) vital airs there are here, with
mind as a fifth: it is with them they then sang praises;--'the living
beings were created,'--the living beings indeed were now created;--'the
lord of beings was the lord!'--the lord of beings indeed was now the
lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:6">8:4:3:6</span></span>6. 'With
seven they sang praises,'--what seven vital airs there are here in the
head: it is with them they then sang praises;--'the seven *Ri*shis were
created,'--the seven *Ri*shis indeed were now created;--'the creator was
the lord!'--the creator indeed was now the lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:7">8:4:3:7</span></span>7. 'With

ruler!'--Aditi indeed was now the ruler.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:8">8:4:3:8</span></span>8. 'With
eleven they sang praises,'--there are ten vital airs, and the trunk is
the eleventh: it is therewith they then sang praises;--'the seasons were
created,'--the seasons indeed were now created;--'the seasonal periods
were the lords!'--the seasonal periods indeed were now the lords.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:9">8:4:3:9</span></span>9. 'With

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:10">8:4:3:10</span></span>10.

and upper arms, and what is above the navel is the fifteenth: it is
therewith they then sang praises the Kshatra was created,'--the nobility
indeed was now created;--'Indra was the lord!'--Indra indeed was now the
lord.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:11">8:4:3:11</span></span>11.

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:13">8:4:3:13</span></span>13.

and the trunk is the twenty-first: it is therewith that they then sang
praises;--'the one-hoofed animals were created,'--the one-hoofed animals
indeed were now created;--'Varu*n*a was the lord!'--Varu*n*a indeed was

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:17">8:4:3:17</span></span>17.
'With twenty-nine they sang praises;'--

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

there are ten fingers, ten toes, and nine vital airs: it is with these
they then sang praises;--'the trees were created,'--the trees indeed

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:18">8:4:3:18</span></span>18.

were now created;--' the Yavas and Ayavas were the lords,'--the bright

<span class="margnote"><span id="8:4:3:20">8:4:3:20</span></span>20.
These, then, are seventeen bricks he lays down,--the year, Pra*g*âpati,
is seventeenfold, he is the progenitor: it is thus by this seventeenfold
year, by Pra*g*âpati, the progenitor, that he caused these creatures to
be generated. And what he generated, he created; and inasmuch as he
created (s*rig*), therefore they are called creations (s*ri*sh*t*i).
Having created them, he made them enter his own self: and in like manner
does the Sacrificer now cause these creatures to be generated by that
seventeenfold year, by Pra*g*âpati, the progenitor; and having created
them, he makes them enter his own self <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_145). On the

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

range of the Reta*h*si*k* (he lays down these bricks): the Reta*h*si*k*
being the ribs, and the ribs the middle (of the body), it is in the very
middle that he causes these creatures to enter him. He lays them on all
sides: from all sides he thus makes these creatures to enter him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_142"></span>[71:1](sbe4317.htm#fr_143) The seventeen
S*ri*sh*t*is are to be placed round the centre, along the reta*h*si*k*
range, in such a way that nine bricks lie south

<span id="img_07100"></span> ![THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FOURTH
LAYER.](img/07100.jpg)  
THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FOURTH LAYER.

(Seventeen s*ri*sh*t*i and two *ri*tavyâ.)

and eight bricks north, of the spine; and that five bricks form the
southern side, and four bricks each of the three other sides. Whilst the
bricks of the south side are further specified as consisting of a brick,
a foot square, lying on the cross-spine, being flanked on both sides by
half-foot bricks, and these again by square bricks; no particulars are
given regarding the other sides. Most likely, however, as indicated in
the accompanying sketch, four square bricks, two on each side of the
cross-spine, are to form the left (north) side, whilst the front and
hind sides are to consist of two <span id="page_72">p. 72</span> square
bricks lying north and south of the spine, and flanked by half-foot
bricks.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[72:1](sbe4317.htm#fr_144) That is, to the
deities representing the vital airs, viz. the regions, &c. Mahîdh.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[72:2](sbe4317.htm#fr_145) Professor Delbrück,
in his Altindische Syntax, pp. 136, 257, 265, takes 'stoshyâmahe' in
this passage in a passive sense--'by whom shall we be praised?' I think,
however, that this is a mistake, and Harisvâmin's commentary certainly
takes it in the same sense as I have done; and, indeed, the paragraphs
which follow seem to me to make it quite clear that no other
interpretation is possible. Pra*g*âpati is about to perform the
's*ri*sh*t*is,' i. e. the creation of living beings by means of
sacrifice (his own self). He requires the assistance of the Prâ*n*as
(vital airs) in order to produce creatures endowed with breath, and he
also appeals to (the three most prominent of) them in their capacity as
*Ri*shis (VI, 1, 1, 1 seq.) to officiate as his (Udgât*ri*) priests.
They ask, 'Wherewith shall we sing praises?' and he answers, 'With me
and with your own selves.' The wherewith,' according to Harisvâmin,
refers both to the 'stotriyâ' verses to be used, and to the deities of
the s*ri*sh*t*i-stotras. That the former, at all events, is indeed the
case, a glance at the subsequent paragraphs shows, where the stotriyâs
are identified with the vital airs, and, when their number (ten) becomes
exhausted, with parts of the year (Pra*g*âpati), and of his (the
Sacrificer's, or Pra*g*âpati's) body. As regards the deities whom
Harisvâmin considers to be likewise implied, this also is by no means
improbable, though I must confess that it did not occur to me, before I
looked at the commentary. In the Udgât*ri*'s text-books, the chanting of
stotras is usually interpreted as symbolising the production of 'food'
(cf., for instance, Tâ*nd*ya-Br. I, 3, 6, 'anna*m* karishyâmy anna*m*
pravishyâmy anna*m* *g*anayishyâmi'), whilst here it seems identified
with the production of life, or breath itself (cf. ib. 5, 'b*ri*haspatis
tvâ yunaktu devebhya*h* prâ*n*âya &c.'); and, accordingly, in Sat. Br.
X, 3, 1, 1, 7, the principal vital air, the breath proper, is called
'pra*g*anana-prâ*n*a.'

<span id="fn_145"></span>[76:1](sbe4317.htm#fr_146) That is, he makes
them pass into his own power, makes them his own.
