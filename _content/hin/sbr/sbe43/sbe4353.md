### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:1">10:2:4:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati, indeed, is the year, and Agni is all objects of desire.
This Pra*g*âpati, the year, desired, 'May I build up for myself a body
so as to contain <span id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_602) Agni, all objects
of desire.' He constructed a body one hundred and one-fold; and in
constructing a body one hundred and one-fold, he built up for himself a
body so as to contain Agni, all objects of desire, and himself became
all objects of desire; there was not one object of desire outside of
him: whence they say, 'The year (includes) all objects of desire;' for,
indeed, outside the year there is no object of desire whatever.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:2">10:2:4:2</span></span>2. And
in like manner does the Sacrificer now, by constructing a body (of the
altar) one hundred and one-fold, build for himself a body so as to
contain Agni, all objects of desire: he becomes all objects of desire,
and not one object of (his) desire is outside of him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:3">10:2:4:3</span></span>3. Now
this year is the same as yonder sun; and he is this one hundred and
one-fold (Agni);--his rays are a hundredfold, and he himself who shines

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

yonder, being the one hundred and first, is firmly established in this
universe; and in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself
in this universe by constructing for himself a body a hundred and
one-fold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:4">10:2:4:4</span></span>4. And,
indeed, the one hundred and one-fold passes into (becomes equal to) the
sevenfold one; for yonder sun, whilst composed a hundred and one-fold,
is established in the seven worlds of the gods, for, indeed, there are
seven worlds of the gods,--the four quarters and these three worlds:
these are the seven worlds of the gods, and in them that (sun) is
established. And in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish
himself in the seven worlds of the gods by constructing for himself a
body a hundred and one-fold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:5">10:2:4:5</span></span>5. And,
again, as to how the one hundred and one-fold (altar) passes into the
sevenfold one:--yonder sun, composed of a hundred and one parts, is
established in the seven seasons, in the seven stomas (hymn-forms), in
the seven p*ri*sh*th*a (-sâmans), in the seven metres, in the seven
vital airs, and in the seven regions; and in like manner does the
Sacrificer now establish himself in this universe (or, on everything
here) by constructing for himself a body one hundred and one-fold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:6">10:2:4:6</span></span>6. And,
again, as to how the one hundred and one-fold passes into the sevenfold
one:--yonder sun, composed of a hundred and one parts, is established in
the seven-syllabled Brahman, for the Brahman (holy writ or prayer)
indeed consists of seven syllables,--'*ri*k' is one syllable,
'ya*g*u*h*' two, and 'sâma' two; and what other Brahman there is that is
just the 'brahman' of two syllables--this

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

seven-syllabled Brahman is the universe <span
id="fr_613"></span>[1](#fn_603): therein that (sun) is established; and
in like manner does the Sacrificer now establish himself in the
seven-syllabled Brahman by constructing for himself a body one hundred
and one-fold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:7">10:2:4:7</span></span>7.
Therefore, also, they lay down around (the altar) sets of seven (bricks)
each time, and hence the one hundred and one-fold passes into the
sevenfold one; and, indeed, the sevenfold one passes into the one
hundred and one-fold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="10:2:4:8">10:2:4:8</span></span>8.
Sevenfold, indeed, Pra*g*âpati was created in the beginning. He saw this
body composed of a hundred and one parts--fifty bricks in the
Prâ*n*abh*ri*ts <span id="fr_614"></span>[2](#fn_604), and fifty
sacrificial formulas, that makes a hundred, and the 'settling' and
sûdadohas-formula are the two one hundred and first--these two are one
and the same, for when he has 'settled' (a brick), he pronounces the
sûdadohas-formula over it: by means of this one hundred and one-fold
body he gained that conquest and obtained that success; and in like
manner does the Sacrificer, by means of this one hundred and one-fold
body, gain that conquest and obtain that success. And thus, indeed, the
sevenfold (altar) passes into the one hundred and one-fold: that which
is a hundred and one-fold is sevenfold, and that which is sevenfold is a
hundred and one-fold. So much as to the forms (of altars).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_602"></span>[313:1](sbe4353.htm#fr_612) Literally, May I
build for myself a body (self) with a view to (abhi) Agni; or, perhaps,
'He builds (a body) so as to become (Agni);' in which case 'abhi' of
'abhisa*mk*inute' would have the same force as in 'abhisampadyate.' See,
however, [X, 2, 5, 9](sbe4354.htm#10:2:5:9)-[12](sbe4354.htm#10:2:5:12),
where Sâya*n*a explains it by 'yo ya*h* kâma*h* ta*m* sarvam âtmânam
abhilakshya sampâditavân bhavati'--'He brings about (accomplishes) all
that desire for his body.'

<span id="fn_603"></span>[315:1](sbe4353.htm#fr_613) Or, perhaps, 'all
this (taken together) is the sevenfold Brahman.'

<span id="fn_604"></span>[315:2](sbe4353.htm#fr_614) In the first layer
ten Prâ*n*abh*ri*t bricks were placed along the diagonals in each of the
four corners of the body of the altar (or in the intermediate quarters),
and as many round the centre.
