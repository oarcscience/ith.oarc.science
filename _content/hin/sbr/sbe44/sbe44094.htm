<P><A NAME="fn_835"></A><A HREF="sbe44094.htm#fr_839">328:1</A> See <a href="sbe44098.htm#13:3:5:3">XIII, 3, 5, 3</A> seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_836"></A><A HREF="sbe44094.htm#fr_840">329:1</A> The term Katush<I>t</I>oma originally apparently means a sacrificial performance, or succession of chants, in which four different Stomas, or hymn-forms, are used. Hence, in T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. VI, 3, 16, the name is applied to the ordinary Agnish<I>t</I>oma, for its twelve Stotras, or chants, require the first four normal Stomas (Triv<I>ri</I>t, Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, Saptada<I>s</I>a, Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a). The term has, however, assumed the special meaning of a hymnic performance, the different Stomas of which (begin with the four-versed one, and) successively increase by four verses (cf. <a href="sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:1">XIII, 5, 1, 1</A>). In this sense, two different forms of <I>K</I>atush<I>t</I>oma are in use, one being applicable to an Agnish<I>t</I>oma, the other to a Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in, sacrifice. Whilst this latter form requires only four different Stomas (of 4, 8, 12, 16 verses resp.) and thus combines the original meaning of '<I>k</I>atush<I>t</I>oma' with its special meaning, the Agnish<I>t</I>oma form, used on the first of the three days of the A<I>s</I>vamedha, requires six Stomas, ascending from the four-versed up to the twenty-four-versed one. In regard to this latter occasion, S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XXI, 4, 1, curiously enough, seems to take 'katush<I>t</I>oma' in its original senses, since he speaks of this first day of the A<I>s</I>vamedha as an Agnish<I>t</I>oma with four Stomas, beginning with Triv<I>ri</I>t; whilst on ib. XIX, 5, 1 seq. he gives the correct explanation. As to the distribution of the six Stomas over the chants of the first day, see <a href="sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:1">XIII, 5, 1, 1</A>. The <I>k</I>atush<I>t</I>oma has, however, another peculiarity, which, in L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. S. VI, 8, 1 (or at least by the commentator Agnisv&acirc;min thereon), is taken as that which has given its name to this form of chanting, viz. that each stotra performed in it is chanted in four, instead of the ordinary three, pary&acirc;yas or turns of verses (see part ii, p. 350 note). The Bahishpavam&acirc;na-stotra is to be performed on three anush<I>t</I>ubh verses (consisting each of four octosyllabic p&acirc;das) which, however, by taking each time three p&acirc;das to make up a verse, are transformed into four verses, constituting at the same time the four pary&acirc;yas of the Stotra. As regards the exact <A NAME="page_330"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 330</FONT></A> text to be used there seems to be some doubt, S&acirc;mav. S. II, 366-8 (pavasva v&acirc;<I>g</I>as&acirc;taye) being mentioned by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XXI, 4, 5; whilst on XIX, 5, 2 he gives S. V. II, 168-70 (ayam p&ucirc;sh&acirc; rayir bhaga<I>h</I>) as the text to be used--but apparently only when the performance is that of an ek&acirc;ha (one day's sacrifice) proper, instead of one of the days of an &acirc;h&icirc;na sacrifice, as is the case in the three days&#8217; A<I>s</I>vamedha. As regards the &Acirc;<I>g</I>ya-stotras to be chanted on the eight-versed Stoma, the text of each of them consists of three g&acirc;yatr&icirc;-verses: these are to be chanted in four turns (pary&acirc;ya) of two verses each, viz. either 1 and 2, 2 and 3, 1 and 2, 2 and 3;--or 1 and 1, 1 and 2, 2 and 2, 3 and 3;--(or 1 and 1, 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 3 and 3;--or 1 and 1, 2 and 2, 2 and 2, 3 and 3). By similar manipulations the subsequent Stomas are formed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_837"></A><A HREF="sbe44094.htm#fr_841">330:1</A> Or, wounded, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes '&acirc; b<I>ri</I>hat,' on T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XXI, 4, 4 (vra<I>n</I>a<I>m</I> <I>k</I>ak&acirc;ra).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_838"></A><A HREF="sbe44094.htm#fr_842">330:2</A> The Atir&acirc;tra sarvastoma is arranged in such a way that the six principal Stomas are used successively first in the ascending, and then again in the descending, or reversed, order as is explained in <a href="sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:10">XIII, 5, 3, 10</A>.</P>
