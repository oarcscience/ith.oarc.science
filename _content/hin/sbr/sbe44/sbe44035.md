### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:1">11:6:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
*G*anaka of Videha once met some Brâhma*n*as who were travelling
about <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_352), to wit, *S*vetaketu
Âru*n*eya, Soma*s*ushma Sâtyaya*gñ*i, and Yâ*gñ*avalkya. He said to
them, 'How do ye each of you perform the Agnihotra?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:2">11:6:2:2</span></span>2.
*S*vetaketu Âru*n*eya replied, 'O great king, I make offering, in one
another, to two heats, never-failing and overflowing with glory.'--'How
is that?' asked the king.--'Well, Âditya (the sun) is heat: to him I
make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is heat: to him
I make offering in the morning in Âditya <span
id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_353).'--'What becomes of him who offers in
this way?' asked the

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

king.--'He verily becomes never-failing in prosperity and glory, and
attains to 'the fellowship of those two deities, and to an abode in
their world.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:3">11:6:2:3</span></span>3. Then
Soma*s*ushma Sâtyaya*gñ*i said, 'I, O king, make offering to light in
light.'--'How is that?' asked the king.--'Well, Âditya is light: to him
I make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is light: to
him I make offering in Âditya in the morning.'--'What becomes of him who
offers in this way? He verily becomes lightsome, and glorious, and
prosperous; and attains to the fellowship of those two deities, and to
an abode in their world.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:4">11:6:2:4</span></span>4. Then
Yâ*gñ*avalkya said, 'When I take out the fire (from the Gârhapatya), it
is the Agnihotra itself, I thereby raise <span
id="fr_354"></span>[1](#fn_354) Now when Âditya (the sun) sets, all the
gods follow him; and when they see that fire taken out by me, they turn
back. Having then cleansed the (sacrificial) vessels, and deposited them
(on the Vedi), and having milked the Agnihotra cow, I gladden them, when
I see them, and when they see me.'--'Thou, O Yâ*gñ*avalkya, hast
inquired most closely into the nature of the Agnihotra,' said the king;
'I bestow a hundred cows on thee. But not even thou (knowest) either the
uprising, or the progress, or the support, or the contentment, or the
return, or the renascent world of those two (libations of the
Agnihotra).' Thus saying, he mounted his car and drove away.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:5">11:6:2:5</span></span>5. They
said, 'Surely, this fellow of a Râ*g*anya has outtalked us: come, let us
challenge him to

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

a theological disputation!' Yâ*gñ*avalkya said, 'We are Brâhma*n*as, and
he is a Râ*g*anya: if we were to vanquish him, whom should we say we had
vanquished? But if he were to vanquish us, people would say of us that a
Râ*g*anya had vanquished Brâhma*n*as: do not think of this!' They
approved of his words. But Yâ*gñ*avalkya, mounting his car, drove after
(the king). He overtook him, and he (the king) said, 'Is it to know the
Agnihotra, Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'The Agnihotra, O king!' he replied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:6">11:6:2:6</span></span>6.
‘Well, those two libations, when offered, rise upwards: they enter the
air, and make the air their offering-fire, the wind their fuel, the
sun-motes their pure libation: they satiate the air, and rise upwards
therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:7">11:6:2:7</span></span>7.
‘They enter the sky, and make the sky their offering-fire, the sun their
fuel, and the moon their pure libation: they satiate the sky, and return
from there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:8">11:6:2:8</span></span>8.
‘They enter this (earth), and make this (earth) their offering-fire, the
fire their fuel, and the herbs their pure libation: they satiate this
(earth), and rise upwards therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:9">11:6:2:9</span></span>9.
‘They enter man, and make his mouth their offering-fire, his tongue
their fuel, and food their pure libation: they satiate man; and, verily,
for him who, knowing this, eats food the Agnihotra comes to be offered.
They rise upwards from there.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:6:2:10">11:6:2:10</span></span>10.
'They enter woman, and make her lap their offering-fire, her womb the
fuel,--for that (womb) is called the bearer, because by it Pra*g*âpati
bore creatures,--and the seed their pure libation: they satiate woman;
and, verily, for him who, knowing this, approaches his mate, the
Agnihotra comes to

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

be offered. The son who is born therefrom is the renascent world: this
is the Agnihotra, Yâ*gñ*avalkya, there is nothing higher than this.'
Thus he spoke; and Yâ*gñ*avalkya granted him a boon. He said, 'Let mine
be the (privilege of) asking questions of thee when I list,
Yâ*gñ*avalkya!' Thenceforth *G*anaka was a Brahman.

(and officiating at sacrifices); see [XI, 4, 1,

Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, p. 421 seqq.

36, instead of--'In the evening he offers Sûrya in Agni, and in the
morning he offers Agni in Sûrya'--we ought probably to translate,--'In
the evening he makes offering to Sûrya in Agni, and in the morning he
makes offering to Agni in Sûrya.' The commentary there would admit of
either rendering:--Agnir *g*yotir, iti mantre*n*a *g*uhvad agnâv eva
