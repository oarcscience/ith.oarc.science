The two A<I>s</I>vins and Sarasvat&icirc; then prepared for him this sacrifice, the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, for the purpose of healing him, and thereby consecrated him: thereby he became the highest of gods, and so does he who is consecrated by that (offering) become the highest among his own people.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:3">12:8:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. He consecrates him on a black antelope skin; for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_631"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: it is at the sacrifice he thus consecrates him; on the hairy side (of the skin), for the hair is the metres: it is on the metres (or sacred writ) he thus consecrates him.</p>

It is made of udumbara wood, for the udumbara (ficus glomerata) is strength: for the sake of strength he thus is consecrated. It is knee-high, for knee-high is this (terrestrial) world, and it is for (the rule of) this world that the Kshatriya is consecrated; and the ruler (kshatra) indeed he becomes who is consecrated by the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;: therefore it is knee-high, and of unlimited size horizontally (in width and depth),--</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:7">12:8:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. Concerning this, Gaur&icirc;viti <I>S</I>&acirc;ktya, knowing this, once said, 'Like rulers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_633"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, assuredly, we shall be in yonder world!' Perhaps&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_634"></A><A HREF="#fn_632"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> it was Rishabha Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>atura, king of the Svikna, who had told him so.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:8">12:8:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. He places the throne-seat, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XX, 1), 'Thou art the womb of the Kshatra, thou art the navel of the Kshatra!' for it indeed is the womb and navel of the Kshatra (ruling power).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:9">12:8:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. He then spreads the black antelope skin thereon, with, 'May it not injure thee! do not</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A></p>  
<p>injure me!' for the black antelope skin is the sacrifice: (thus it is spread) for the safety of the sacrifice and his own self.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:10">12:8:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. He then mounts it, with a verse to Varu<I>n</I>a (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XX, 2), for Varu<I>n</I>a is the king of the gods: by means of his own deity he thus consecrates him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_633"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,--'He hath sat down, the upholder of the sacred law, Varu<I>n</I>a, in the home-steads, for supreme rule, he the wise!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:11">12:8:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. He then throws down a gold and a silver plate (beneath his feet, the silver one beneath the left foot) with, 'Protect (me) from death!' (the gold one beneath the right foot&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_636"></A><A HREF="#fn_634"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with,) 'Protect (me) from lightning!' The Vir&acirc;<I>g</I>, doubtless, is the rain, and of this there are these two terrible forms, lightning and hail; of these the gold plate is of the form of lightning, and the silver one of that of hail: against these two deities he affords protection to him, whence he who has performed the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; has no fear of these two deities, as he also who thus knows this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:12">12:8:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. He consecrates him by sprinkling him with the fat gravy of the sacrificial animals, for the gravy of the animals means excellence: with that excellence, the essence of cattle, he thus sprinkles him. But that gravy is also the highest kind of food: with the highest kind of food he thus sprinkles him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:13">12:8:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. There are hoof-cups (of gravy), for on hoofs cattle support themselves: he thus causes him to obtain a support. There are thirty-three (such)</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_252"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 252</FONT></A></p>  
<p>cupfuls, for thirty-three in number are all the deities: by means of all the deities he thus consecrates him. He offers them with <I>g</I>agat&icirc; verses, for animals are of <I>g</I>&acirc;gata (movable) nature: by means of the <I>G</I>agat&icirc; he thus secures cattle for him. With sixteen verses (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIX, 80-94) he offers, for animals are of sixteen parts: he thus bestows excellence (or prosperity) on him part by part.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:14">12:8:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. 'With lead the wise, with wool and thread&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_637"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the sages weave the web, the sacrifice: the A<I>s</I>vins, Savit<I>ri</I>, Sarasvat&icirc;, and Varu<I>n</I>a healed the form of Indra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_638"></A><A HREF="#fn_636"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' Each time he has offered two (cupfuls) together, he pours the residue into a bowl (sata): he thereby establishes the days and nights, the half-months, the months, and the seasons in the year, and hence these days and nights, half-months, months, and seasons are established (contained) in the year.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:15">12:8:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. The bowl is made of reed, for the reed has its birth-place in the waters, and the waters are all the deities: by means of all the deities he thus consecrates him.</p>  
<p>16. A rubbing down (of the Sacrificer) with all manner of sweet-smelling substances takes place (before sprinkling him with fat), for such a rubbing down with all manner of sweet-smelling substances means supreme fragrance: with fragrance he thus consecrates (anoints) him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:17">12:8:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. He sprinkles him (with the fat gravy) in front while (himself) looking towards the back (west), for</p>

<p><A NAME="page_253"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 253</FONT></A></p>  
<p>from the front food is visibly eaten. On. every side (he sprinkles him) whilst moving round: he thus bestows food on him from all quarters, whence food is secured from all quarters by him who has performed the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, or even by him who thus knows this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:18">12:8:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. With a formula to the A<I>s</I>vins he sprinkles him first&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_639"></A><A HREF="#fn_637"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, then with one to Sarasvat&icirc;, then with one to Indra: it is by means of these deities he thus consecrates him. Now, some consecrate him by means both of these deities and those utterances, 'bh&ucirc;<I>h</I> bhuva<I>h</I>, svar,' 'for,' say they, 'these utterances ("earth, air, heaven") mean all this (universe) it is by means of all this (universe) we thus consecrate him.' Let him, however, not do so, but let him only consecrate him by means of those deities, for those deities, indeed, are all this (universe).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:19">12:8:3:19</A></FONT></span>19. He consecrates him prior to the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t (offering), for the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t is the Kshatra: he thus consecrates him by means of the Kshatra (or, by a Kshatriya). And he consecrates him between (the oblation to) the Lord of the Forest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_640"></A><A HREF="#fn_638"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, for the lord of the forest (or the tree) is Soma, and the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t (maker of good offering) is Agni: he thus consecrates him after encompassing him by Agni and Soma; whence both those who know, and those who do not, say, 'A Kshatriya is the consecrator of a Kshatriya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_641"></A><A HREF="#fn_639"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:20">12:8:3:20</A></FONT></span>20. They then lift him up&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_642"></A><A HREF="#fn_640"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> knee-high, then navel-high, then as high as the mouth; for the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya doubtless is the same as the consecration, and the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is a consecration; and even as there, at the V&acirc;<I>g</I>apeya, he (the Sacrificer) mounts the sacrificial stake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_643"></A><A HREF="#fn_641"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, like that is this rite.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:21">12:8:3:21</A></FONT></span>21. As to this they say, 'But, surely, he who is consecrated by the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; moves away from this world.' Well, he descends again upon the black antelope skin, and, the black antelope skin being the sacrifice, he thus finally establishes himself on the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:22">12:8:3:22</A></FONT></span>22.

<p>myself, and in kine,'--in the midst of horses and kine he thus establishes himself so as not to lose horses and kine;--'firmly in the limbs I establish myself, and in the body,'--in the limbs and in the body he thus establishes himself so as not to lose his limbs and his body;--'firmly in the vital airs I establish myself, and in prosperity,'--in the vital airs and in prosperity he thus establishes himself so as not to lose the vital airs and prosperity;--'firmly in heaven and on earth I establish myself, and in the sacrifice,'--he thus establishes himself in these two, heaven and earth, within which is all this (universe).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:23">12:8:3:23</A></FONT></span>23. He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_646"></A><A HREF="#fn_644"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> then sings a S&acirc;man (hymn-tune), for the S&acirc;man means lordship (kshatra): with lordship he thus consecrates him; or the S&acirc;man means imperial sway: by means of imperial sway he thus causes him to attain imperial sway. And, indeed, the S&acirc;man is the essence of all the Vedas: he thus consecrates him with the essence of all the Vedas.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:24">12:8:3:24</A></FONT></span>24.

<p>that sun shines&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_648"></A><A HREF="#fn_646"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: he thus establishes him on the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;, as his excellence and foundation.</p>

He sings it on a b<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verse relating to Indra, for this sacrifice, the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has Indra for his support: he thus consecrates him on his own support (or resting-place).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:26">12:8:3:26</A></FONT></span>26. And as to why (these hymns) are called 'bracers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_649"></A><A HREF="#fn_647"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>;' it is because by means of these S&acirc;mans the gods braced Indra up to energy, or vital power: in like manner do the officiating priests, by means of these S&acirc;mans, brace the Sacrificer up to energy, or vital power. 'Sa<I>m</I><I>s</I>ravase, vi<I>s</I>ravase, satya<I>s</I>ravase, <I>s</I>ravase&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_650"></A><A HREF="#fn_648"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>'--these are the S&acirc;mans: they proclaim</p>

<p>him in these worlds. There are four <i>finales</i>, for there are four quarters: they thus establish him in all the quarters. All (the priests) join in the <i>finale:</i> with one mind they thus bestow excellence upon him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:27">12:8:3:27</A></FONT></span>27. As to this they say, 'Seeing that this S&acirc;man is sung, wherein then does the recitation (uktha) of this S&acirc;man consist, and what is its foundation; for unsuccessful is what is chanted unless it be followed by a recitation?'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:3:28">12:8:3:28</A></FONT></span>28. 'Thrice eleven are the gods;' this, indeed, is the recitation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_651"></A><A HREF="#fn_649"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> belonging to that S&acirc;man, this its foundation.</p>

Similarly, I, 8, 1, 4, 'perhaps it was a <I>gh</I>asha, for that (fish) grows best (fastest);' II, 2, 1, 2, 'If, on the other hand, that oblation were not offered up in him, he would perhaps burn either the Adhvaryu, or the Sacrificer.' Somewhat peculiar is the passage, I, 6, 3, 10, where <I>s</I>a<I>s</I>vat occurs both in the relative and in the demonstrative clause, and where we can hardly translate otherwise than 'If, perchance, he had said, "Grow thou, the foe of Indra!" he (V<I>ri</I>tra) would perhaps have slain Indra.'--H&auml;tte er vielleicht (etwa) gesagt: 'Wachse, du Feind Indras!' so w&uuml;rde er (V<I>ri</I>tra) vielleicht (? gewiss) Indra erschlagen haben.--If this be the right interpretation of these passages, they would have td be transferred, in the St. Petersb. Dict., from meaning b (?) to c, where 'vielleicht' would have to be added, as it certainly suits better than 'gewiss' (most likely) the last of the foregoing passages, at all events. The comm. explains '<I>s</I>a<I>s</I>vat' by 'bahuk<I>ri</I>tva<I>h</I>.'</P>

XX, 3, 'At the impulse of God Savit<I>ri</I> (I consecrate) thee by the arms of the A<I>s</I>vins, and the heads of P&ucirc;shan!' followed by the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina one, 'with the healing medicine of the A<I>s</I>vins I sprinkle thee for energy and holy lustre!' and the S&acirc;rasvata one, 'with the healing medicine of Sarasvat&icirc; I sprinkle thee for vigour and food!'

<P><A NAME="fn_643"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_645">254:5</A> The function of 'prati' here seems to be to strengthen the preposition in the verb 'prati-tish<I>th</I>&acirc;mi.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_644"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_646">255:1</A> According to the commentator on K&acirc;ty. XIX, 5, 1, the Brahman sings, whilst L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. V, 4, 16-19 gives directions from which the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> would seem to be expected to perform this duty. When the Sacrificer is being anointed, the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> is to step between the (northern and southern) fires and, as soon as he is called upon by the Adhvaryu, he is to commence the S&acirc;man. It would probably depend on the Brahman's previous studies, whether or not he was sufficiently conversant with the complicated details of the hymnology.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_645"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_647">255:2</A> Viz. V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XX, 30 (Riks. VIII, 89, 1), 'To Indra, O Maruts, sing ye the great (hymn), most destructive to V<I>ri</I>tra, whereby the promoters of sacred rites produced the light, the wakeful god for the god.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_646"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_648">256:1</A> Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. VIII, p. 42, refers to a parallel passage in T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. VII, 4, 7--'By means of the Bahishpavam&acirc;na (of the morning service) the gods carried off &Acirc;ditya, the sun, to heaven; but he did not stop there. At midday they then fixed him by means of the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;, and for this reason the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; metre is used for the Pavam&acirc;na-stotra at the midday service.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_647"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_649">256:2</A> Literally, sharpeners or sharpenings (sa<I>m</I><I>s</I>&acirc;na).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_648"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_650">256:3</A> These words--apparently meaning 'for fame all round, for fame far and wide, for true fame, for fame' (or, perhaps, for hearing, or, rather, being heard of all round,' &amp;c.)--are used to form the <i>finales</i> (nidhana) in which all the priests are to join; cf. S&acirc;mav., Calc. ed., I, pp. 533-4, where the figured text is given. According to Katy. XIX, 5, 4-5; L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. V, 4, 19, the words, 'sa<I>m</I><I>g</I>ityai, vi<I>g</I>ityai, satya<I>g</I>ityai, <I>g</I>ityai' (for complete victory, victory far and wide, &amp;c.), and 'sampush<I>t</I>yai, vipush<I>t</I>yai,' &amp;c. (for complete prosperity, &amp;c.), are to be used instead, in the case of a Kshatriya and Vai<I>s</I>ya respectively, either optionally or necessarily. Though these four words are here, and elsewhere, spoken of as so many different S&acirc;mans, only 'the last of them ('<I>s</I>ravase') forms the <i>finale</i> of a S&acirc;man in the ordinary sense of the word; the others being merely combined with certain musical ejaculations, or expletives (stobhas). All the four 'S&acirc;mans' begin with the same phrase (varying only in the verb)--'sa<I>m</I> tv&acirc; hinvanti (ri<I>n</I>anti, <A NAME="page_257"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 257</FONT></A> tatakshur, <I>s</I>i<I>s</I>anti) dh&icirc;tibhi<I>h</I>,' i, e. 'they make thee up (or urge thee on) with prayers,' serving as a kind of prelude (prast&acirc;va) the single words of which are given among the Stobhas (S&acirc;mav&#8222; Calc. ed., II, p. 522, last line), as, indeed, the words 'sa<I>m</I><I>s</I>ravase,' &amp;c., themselves are (ib., p. 520). In the first three S&acirc;mans this phrase is followed by the <i>finale</i> consisting of the respective characteristic word preceded by the Stobha 'auhov&acirc;.' In the last S&acirc;man, on the other hand, the introductory phrase is followed by the choral setting of the verse 'B<I>ri</I>had indr&acirc;ya g&acirc;yata' (see <A HREF="#page_255">p. 255</A>, n. <A HREF="#fn_645">2</A>), which, in its turn, is followed again by the first phrase, with a slightly modified modulation, ending with 'auhov&acirc; <I>s</I>ravase.' Whilst joining in the <i>finale</i>, the priests, according to L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. V, 4, 17, are to lay their hands on the head of the Sacrificer.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_649"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_652">257:1</A> According to Katy. Sr. XIX, 4, 24; 5, 8 seq.; 7, 1 seq., the thirty-third libation of gravy is taken with the text, XX, 32, 'yo bh&ucirc;t&acirc;n&acirc;m adhipati<I>h</I> (he who is the over-lord of creatures),' &amp;c.; whilst, on the conclusion of the Sastra, or Hot<I>ri</I>'s recitation, the Sacrificer offers the libation from that last cup with XX, 11-12, and drinks the remainder with XX, 13. The Sastra, recited in response to the S&acirc;man, consists of the section of .eleven verses, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XX, 80-90, the first and last verses of which are recited thrice; whilst the '&acirc;h&acirc;va' (<I>s</I>o<I>m</I>s&acirc;vom, 'let us praise, om!') is inserted by him before each triplet of the remaining nine verses. The two verses used whilst the Sacrificer offers (XX, 11-12) are likewise recited by the <A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A> Hot<I>ri</I>, as a 'nivid,' being either added at the end of the Sastra, or inserted before the ninth or tenth verse; the whole recitation thus consisting of seventeen verses.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_650"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_653">258:1</A> Mah&icirc;dhara takes the instrumental throughout as a sociative (saha satyena).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_651"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_654">259:1</A> According to K&acirc;ty. XIX, 5, 9, the priests themselves first smell the remainder of the fat gravy, with the text (XX, 34), 'The protector of my breath thou art,' &amp;c. Cf. also <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:42">XIV, 2, 2, 42</A>, with note.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_652"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_655">259:2</A> The use of 'prayati' in this sense (here and V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XVIII, 1) is peculiar; being apparently derived from 'pra-yam,' one would expect it to have some such meaning as 'offer, gift.' This and the other predicates, according to Mah&icirc;dhara, are to show the state of feeling of beings towards the (royal) Sacrificer. The repetition of '&acirc;nati' (bowing, prostration, submission) is strange. A strong alliterative cadence is noticeable in the verse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_653"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_656">259:3</A> ? Hardly 'return' here; rather, perhaps, 'attaining to (the other worlds),' or, possibly, 'the turning to him, gathering round him (of the people).'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_654"></A><A HREF="sbe44070.htm#fr_657">259:4</A> ? Or, he now calls these to himself in the meantime.</P>
