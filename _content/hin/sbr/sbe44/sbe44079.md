### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:6:1">13:1:6:1</span></span>1.
\[The Adhvaryu and Sacrificer whisper in the right ear of the horse,
Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 19 <span id="fr_725"></span>[3](#fn_721),\] 'Plenteous
by the mother, strengthful by the father,'--its mother, doubtless, is
this (earth), and its father yonder (sky): it is to these two he commits
it;--'a horse thou art, a steed thou art,'--he thereby instructs it,
whence clever subjects (or children) are born to him;--'a courser (atya)
thou art, a charger thou art,'--he therewith leads it beyond (ati),
whence the horse goes beyond (surpasses) other animals, and whence the
horse attains to pre-eminence among animals;--'a runner thou art, a
racer thou art, a prize-winner thou

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

art,'--in accordance with the text is (the meaning of) this;--'a male
thou art, well-disposed towards man thou art,'--this is with a view to
its (or, his) being supplied with a mate;--'Speedy thou art called,
Child thou art called,'--this is the horse's favourite name: by its
favourite name he thus addresses it; whence even if two enemies <span
id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_722), on meeting together, address one
another by name, they get on amicably together.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:6:2">13:1:6:2</span></span>2. 'Go
thou along the way of the Âdityas!'--to the Âdityas he thus makes it
go.--'Ye divine guardians of the quarters, protect this horse, sprinkled
for sacrifice to the gods!'--the guardians of the quarters are a hundred
princes born in wedlock: to them he commits it;--'here is joy: here let
it rejoice!--here is safe keeping, here is its own safe keeping, hail!'
For a year he offers the (four Dh*ri*ti) oblations <span
id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_723)--(amounting to) sixteen nineties, for
they are the horse's chain <span id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_724), and it
is therewith alone that he chains it; whence the horse when let loose
returns to its chain: (they amount to) sixteen nineties <span
id="fr_729"></span>[4](#fn_725); for these (oblations of safe keeping)
are the horse's chain, and it is therewith alone that he chains it,
whence the horse, when let loose, does not (entirely) abandon its chain.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:6:3">13:1:6:3</span></span>3.
Verily, the A*s*vamedha means royal sway: it is after royal sway that
these strive who guard the horse. Those of them who reach the end become

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (sharers in) the
royal sway, but those who do not reach the end are cut off from royal
sway. Wherefore let him who holds royal sway perform the
horse-sacrifice; for, verily, whosoever performs the horse-sacrifice,
without possessing power, is poured (swept) away.--Now, were unfriendly,
men to get hold of the horse, his sacrifice would be cut in twain, and
he would become the poorer for it. A hundred men clad in armour guard it
for the continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice; and
he will not become the poorer for it; (but if it be lost) they should
fetch another (horse), and sprinkle it: this is the expiation in that
case.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_720"></span>[287:2](sbe44078.htm#fr_724) The author
apparently takes 'ish*t*âpûrta' in the sense of either 'sacrifice and
fulfilment,' or 'the fulfilment of (the objects of) sacrifice.' Cf.
Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 319; X, p. 96.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[287:3](sbe44079.htm#fr_725) See [XIII, 4, 2,
15](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:15).

<span id="fn_722"></span>[288:1](sbe44079.htm#fr_726) Harisvâmin,
perhaps rightly, takes 'âmitrau' in the sense of 'amitrayo*h* putrau,'
'the sons of two enemies.'

<span id="fn_723"></span>[288:2](sbe44079.htm#fr_727) See note on [XIII,
4, 3, 5](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:5).

<span id="fn_724"></span>[288:3](sbe44079.htm#fr_728) Or, place of
confinement, stable,--'bandhanasthânam.' Harisv.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[288:4](sbe44079.htm#fr_729) That is, four
times 360.
