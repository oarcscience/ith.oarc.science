### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:1">13:1:2:1</span></span>1. Now,
unsuccessful in the sacrifice, assuredly, is what is performed without a
formula. (With Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 2,) 'This rope did they take, at the
first age of the truth, \[the sages, at the rites: it hath been with us
at this Soma-sacrifice, declaring the course in the gaining of the
truth\],' he takes the halter of the horse in order to supply a formula
for the success of the sacrifice. It (the rope) is twelve cubits
long,--twelve months make a year: it is the year, the sacrifice <span
id="fr_691"></span>[1](#fn_687), he secures.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:2">13:1:2:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they say, 'Is the rope to be made twelve cubits long, or
thirteen cubits long?' Well, that year is the bull among the seasons,
and the thirteenth (or intercalary) month is an excrescence of the year;
and this A*s*vamedha is the bull among sacrifices; and inasmuch as the
bull has an excrescence (hump), one may add on a thirteenth cubit to the
rope as an excrescence to this (A*s*vamedha): even as the bull's hump is
attached <span id="fr_692"></span>[2](#fn_688) (to his back), suchlike
would this be.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:3">13:1:2:3</span></span>3. \[He
puts the halter on the horse, with Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 3, 4,\]
'Encompassing <span id="fr_693"></span>[3](#fn_689) thou art,'--

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

therefore the offerer of the A*s*vamedha conquers all the quarters <span
id="fr_694"></span>[1](#fn_690);--'the world thou art,'--the world he
thus conquers;--'a ruler thou art, an upholder,'--he thus makes him a
ruler and upholder;--'go thou unto Agni Vai*s*vânara,'--he thus makes
him go to Agni Vai*s*vânara (the friend of all men);--'of wide
extent,'--he thus causes him to extend in offspring and
cattle;--'consecrated by Svâhâ (hail!),'--this is the
Vasha*t*-call <span id="fr_695"></span>[2](#fn_691) for it;--'good speed
(to) thee for the gods!'--he thus makes it of good speed for the
gods;--'for Pra*g*âpati,'--the horse is sacred to Pra*g*âpati: he thus
supplies <span id="fr_696"></span>[3](#fn_692) it with his own deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:4">13:1:2:4</span></span>4. But,
verily, he who fetters the horse without announcing it to the Brahman
and the gods is liable to incur injury. He addresses the Brahman (the
superintending priest) by saying, 'O Brahman, I will fetter the horse
for the gods, for Pra*g*âpati: may I prosper therewith!' and having made
the announcement

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

to the Brahman, he ties up the horse, and thus incurs no injury. 'Fetter
it for the gods, for Pra*g*âpati: prosper thou therewith!' thus the
Brahman urges him, and supplies it (the horse) with its own deity. He
then sprinkles it (with water): the (symbolic) meaning of this is the
same as before <span id="fr_697"></span>[1](#fn_693).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:5">13:1:2:5</span></span>5. He
sprinkles <span id="fr_698"></span>[2](#fn_694) it, with (Vâ*g*. S.
XXII, 5), 'I sprinkle thee (so as to be) acceptable to
Pra*g*âpati,'--for Pra*g*âpati is the most vigorous of the gods: it is
vigour he bestows on it, whence the horse is the most vigorous of
animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:6">13:1:2:6</span></span>6. 'I
sprinkle thee, acceptable to Indra and Agni,'--for Indra and Agni are
the most powerful of the gods: it is power he bestows on it, whence the
horse is the most powerful of animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:7">13:1:2:7</span></span>7. 'I
sprinkle thee, acceptable to Vâyu,'--for Vâyu is the swiftest of gods:
it is speed he bestows on it, whence the horse is the swiftest of
animals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:8">13:1:2:8</span></span>8. 'I
sprinkle thee, acceptable to the All-gods,'--for the All-gods are the
most famous of gods: it is fame he bestows on it, whence the horse is
the most famous of animals,---'I sprinkle thee, acceptable to all the
gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:2:9">13:1:2:9</span></span>9.
Concerning this they say, 'Seeing that the horse is sacred to
Pra*g*âpati, wherefore (does he say), "I sprinkle thee" for other
deities also?' Well, all the gods are concerned in the horse-sacrifice;

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

when he says, 'I sprinkle thee for all the gods,' he makes all the gods
take a concern in the horse-sacrifice; whence all the gods are concerned
in the horse-sacrifice. But his wicked enemy seeks to lay hold of him
who performs the horse-sacrifice, and the horse is a
thunderbolt;--having killed the four-eyed dog, he--with 'Undone <span
id="fr_699"></span>[1](#fn_695) is the man! undone is the
dog!'--plunges <span id="fr_700"></span>[2](#fn_696) it under the
horse's feet: it is by means of the thunderbolt

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

he thus stamps him down; and the wicked enemy does not lay hold of him.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_687"></span>[276:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_691) Or, possibly, it
is for the space of a year that he secures the sacrifice, but see part
iv, introduction, p. xxiii.

<span id="fn_688"></span>[276:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_692) Lit., spread out.

<span id="fn_689"></span>[276:3](sbe44075.htm#fr_693) Some such meaning
as this (or perhaps 'encompassed, encircled') seems to be assigned by
the author to 'abhidhâ*h*,' with evident reference to 'abhidhânî,'
halter,' from 'abhi-dhâ,' 'to fasten, enclose.' The St. Petersburg
Dict., on the other hand, takes it in the sense of 'naming, denoting' (?
inasmuch as the horse gives the name to the horse-sacrifice); whilst
Mahîdhara explains it by 'that which is named or praised.'

<span id="fn_690"></span>[277:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_694) In epic times the
A*s*vamedha is commonly performed by kings who have been successful in
the 'digvi*g*aya,' or conquest in all quarters.

<span id="fn_691"></span>[277:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_695) 'Vasha*t*' is the
sacrificial call uttered by the Hot*ri* at the end of the 'yâ*g*yâ,' or
offering-verse of a regular oblation (âhuti) as distinguished from minor
libations, such as homas and âghâras, which require no 'yâ*g*yâ' and for
which the sacrificial call--marking the pouring out of the libation into
the fire--is 'svâhâ!' The meaning of 'vasha*t*' is doubtful; but it
would seem to be connected either with the root 'vaksh,' to grow, to
wax, or with 'vah,' to bear; and would thus mean either 'may it
prosper!' or 'may he (Agni) bear it (to the gods)!' By the mention of
the Svâhâ in our formula the horse is, as it were, marked as dedicated
to the gods.

<span id="fn_692"></span>[277:3](sbe44075.htm#fr_696) Or, perhaps, he
causes it to succeed by means, or with the help, of its own deity.

<span id="fn_693"></span>[278:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_697) For the sprinkling
of (the material for) oblations see I, 1, 3, 6 seq.; and an animal
victim in particular, III, 7, 4, 3.

<span id="fn_694"></span>[278:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_698) According to Kâty.
XX, 1, 37, he goes with the horse to stagnant water, and there sprinkles
it. It would seem that the horse stands in the water during this
ceremony.

<span id="fn_695"></span>[279:1](sbe44075.htm#fr_699) Mahîdhara explains
'para*h*' by 'parâbhûta*h*, adhaspada*m* nîta*h*,' i.e. defeated, laid
low. Perhaps it may mean, 'Away is the man, away the dog!' As given in
the Vâ*g*. Sa*m*h., this is only the last part of the formula,
pronounced by the Sacrificer; whilst during the killing of the dog, he
is made to say, 'Whosoever seeketh to slay the steed, him Varu*n*a
besetteth.'--According to Kâty. XX, 1, 38 seqq., the priest says to an
Âyogava (the offspring of a *S*ûdra father and a Vai*s*ya mother)--or,
to a lewd man, according to others--'Kill the four-eyed dog!' whereupon
the man kills a dog by means of a club of Sidhraka wood; and (the
priest?), by means of a rattan hoop (? or mat, ka*t*a, comm. ka*t*aka),
makes the dead dog float beneath the horse. According to the comment. on
Kâty. XX, 1, 38, in case a four-eyed dog--i.e. a (two-faced) one 'yasya
dve mukhe' and hence looking in the four (intermediate) directions
(vidi*s*), Sây.--is not available (!), a dog with marks about the eyes
should be used. The mention of the 'four-footed' dog in the formula is,
however, doubtless meant merely symbolically, as representing evil
threatening the Sacrificer from every quarter.

<span id="fn_696"></span>[279:2](sbe44075.htm#fr_700) Harisvâmin seems
to connect this with the sprinkling of the horse itself--proksha*n*a*m*
*s*una upaplâvanam u*k*yate--perhaps in the sense that the water flowing
down from the sprinkled horse would soak the dog, in which case the
horse would apparently be supposed to stand on the dry ground. See,
however, comm. on Kâty. XX, 2, 2, '*S*vânam a*s*vasyâdha*h*prade*s*e
*g*alamadhye plâvayati târayati.' The 'offerings of drops' to be
performed immediately after this ceremony might seem to be offered with
reference to the drops of water flowing from the horse, and as it were
falling outside the sacrifice; but see [paragraph
5](sbe44075.htm#13:1:2:5).
