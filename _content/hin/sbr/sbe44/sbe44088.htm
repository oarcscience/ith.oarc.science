<p>moving (round the moveless: the lights shine in the heavens);'--the ruddy bay, doubtless, is yonder sun: it is yonder sun he harnesses for him, for the gaining of the heavenly world.</p>

But even as some of the offering-material may get spilled before it is offered, so (part of) the victim is here spilled in that the hair of it when wetted comes off. When they (the wives) weave pearls (into the mane and tail) they gather up its hair. They are made of gold: the significance of this has been explained. A hundred and one pearls they weave into (the hair of) each part&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_799"></A><A HREF="#fn_795"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and his own self (or body) is the one hundred and first: in vital power, in the self, he establishes himself.

Previously to this, however, the Hot<I>ri</I> recites eleven verses in praise of the horse (cf. <a href="sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:16">XIII, 5, 1, 16</A>). Both the horses and the chariot are decorated <A NAME="page_312"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 312</FONT></A> with gold ornaments. The Adhvaryu then drives with the Sacrificer to a pond of water to the east of the sacrificial ground (an indispensable feature in choosing the place of sacrifice), and having driven into the water he makes him pronounce the formula XXIII, 7, 'When the wind hath entered the waters, the dear form of Indra, do thou, singer of praise, make that horse come back to us by that path;' whereupon they return to the sacrificial ground.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_799"></A><A HREF="sbe44088.htm#fr_803">314:4</A> It must be remembered that the sacrificial horse here represented by the stake is identified with both Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati and the Sacrificer.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_800"></A><A HREF="sbe44088.htm#fr_804">314:5</A> The actual replies to the questions in V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIII, 9 and 11, are contained in the corresponding verses ten and twelve; being given here in an expository way, with certain variations and <A NAME="page_315"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 315</FONT></A> occasional explanatory words (such as 'v<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i,' rain, in <a href="sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:14">paragraph 14</A>). The answers to the first four questions are supposed to be given by the Hot<I>ri</I>, and the last four by the Brahman.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_801"></A><A HREF="sbe44088.htm#fr_805">315:1</A> This is the meaning assigned here to 'vayas' by Mah&icirc;dhara; but the other meaning of 'vayas,' viz. 'youthful vigour, or age, (generally),' would seem to suit much better, or at least to be implied. And Harisv&acirc;min accordingly takes it in the sense of 'v&acirc;rdhakam' (old age, or long life). Mah&icirc;dhara, moreover, identifies the horse with the horse-sacrifice, which, in the shape of a bird, carries the Sacrificer up to heaven. On this notion cp. part iv, introduction, pp. xxi-xxii.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_802"></A><A HREF="sbe44088.htm#fr_806">315:2</A> Instead of '<I>s</I>r&icirc;<I>h</I>,' the answer given to this question in V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIII, 12 was 'avi<I>h</I>' which would either mean 'the gentle, kindly one,' or 'the sheep (f.),' but which Mah&icirc;dhara (in the former sense) <A NAME="page_316"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 316</FONT></A> takes as (an epithet of) the earth which he also takes '<I>s</I>r&icirc;' to mean in the above passage of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a; whilst to the &#7941;&#0960;&#0945;&#0958; &#0955;&#0949;&#0947;&#0972;&#0956;&#0949;&#0957;&#0959;&#0957; 'pilippil&acirc;' he assigns the meaning 'slippery' (<I>k</I>ikka<I>n</I>a) as applying to the earth after rain (? deriving it from the root 'lip,' to smear, anoint). Harisv&acirc;min, on the other hand, takes 'pilippil&acirc;' to be an onomatopoetic word, in the sense of '(glossy), beautiful, shining':--r&ucirc;p&acirc;nukarana<I>s</I>abdo<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>ya<I>m</I> bahur&ucirc;p&acirc;vil&acirc; (? bahur&ucirc;p&acirc;nvit&acirc;) uddyotavat&icirc;; and he adds:--<I>s</I>r&icirc;m&icirc;<I>m</I>tratu<I>h</I> (? <I>s</I>r&icirc;r mantre tu) avi<I>h</I> pippaloktau (?) s&acirc; tu <I>s</I>r&icirc;r eveti br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>e viv<I>ri</I>ta<I>m</I>, katham, iya<I>m</I> v&acirc; avi<I>h</I> p<I>ri</I>thiv&icirc;, s&acirc; <I>k</I>a <I>s</I>r&icirc;<I>h</I>, <I>s</I>r&icirc;r v&acirc; iyam iti va<I>k</I>an&acirc;t.
