He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men here have dismembered men, hewing off their limbs one by one!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.' He said, 'Is there no atonement for this?'--'Yes, there is,' they replied.--'What is it?'--'Thy father knows.'</p>

He went forth from thence southward, and lo, men were dismembering men, cutting up their limbs one by one, and saying, 'This to thee, this to me!' He said, 'Horrible! woe is me! men here have dismembered men, cutting up their limbs one by one!' They replied, 'Thus, indeed, these dealt with us in yonder world, and so we now deal with them in return.'

On seeing him, terror seized him, and he went home, and sat down. His father said to him, 'Study thy day's lesson (of scripture): why dost thou not, study thy lesson?' He said, What am I to study? there is nothing whatever.' Then Varu<I>n</I>a knew, 'He has indeed seen it!</p>

<p>sawest in the eastern region being dismembered by men hewing off their limbs one by one, and saying, "This to thee, this to me!" they were the trees: when one puts fire-wood from trees on (the fire) he subdues the trees, and conquers the world of trees.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:6:1:12">11:6:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. &#8216;And as to those two women whom thou sawest, one beautiful and one over-beautiful,--the beautiful one is Belief: when one offers the first libation (of the Agnihotra) he subdues Belief, and conquers Belief; and the over-beautiful one is Unbelief: when one offers the second libation, he subdues Unbelief, and conquers Unbelief.</p>

<p>who was standing between them with a staff in his hand, he was Wrath: when, having poured water into the spoon, one pours (the libation into the fire), he subdues Wrath, and conquers Wrath; and, verily, whosoever, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, thereby conquers everything, and subdues everything.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_347"></A><A HREF="sbe44034.htm#fr_347">108:3</A> On this legend, see Prof. Weber, Indische Streifen, I, p. 24 seqq., where the scenes here depicted are taken to be reflections of the popular belief of the time as to the punishments awaiting the guilty in a future existence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_348"></A><A HREF="sbe44034.htm#fr_348">109:1</A> That is to say, in the north-easterly direction. Prof. Weber seems to take it in the sense of the northern one of the two regions intermediate between the two (regions) first referred to. This, however, makes no sense.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_349"></A><A HREF="sbe44034.htm#fr_349">109:2</A> I think, with Prof. Delbr&uuml;ck, Altind. Syntax, p. 404, that the instrumental 'purushai<I>h</I>' stands in lieu of the accusative; this construction being adopted in order to avoid the double accusative and consequent ambiguity.</P>
