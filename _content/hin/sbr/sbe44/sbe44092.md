### TENTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:10:1">13:2:10:1</span></span>1.
When they prepare the knife-paths, the Sacrificer makes for himself that
passage across, a bridge, for the attainment of the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:10:2">13:2:10:2</span></span>2.
They prepare them by means of needles; the needles, doubtless, are the
people <span id="fr_836"></span>[3](#fn_832) (clans), and the
A*s*vamedha is the royal power: they thus supply him with people and
royal power combined. They are made of gold: the meaning of this has
been explained.

Three kinds of needles are (used), copper ones, silver ones, and gold
ones;--those of copper, doubtless, are the (principal) regions (of the
compass), those of silver the intermediate ones, and those of gold the
upper ones: it is by means of these (regions) they render it fit and
proper. By way of horizontal and vertical (stitches <span
id="fr_837"></span>[1](#fn_833)) they are many-formed, whence the
regions are many-formed; and they are of distinct form, whence the
regions are of distinct form.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_832"></span>[326:3](sbe44092.htm#fr_836) Viz. because of
the large number and the small size (insignificance) of the needles, or
wires, (and the common people), comm.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[327:1](sbe44092.htm#fr_837) It is doubtful
what word, if any, has to be supplied here,--perhaps it means, by way of
their being (in sewing) horizontal and vertical. The commentary is
silent on this passage.
