### NINTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE ADÂBHYA-GRAHA.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:1">11:5:9:1</span></span>1. Now,
the A*ms*u (cup of Soma) <span id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_337), indeed,
is no other than Pra*g*âpati; and it is the body of this (sacrifice),
for Pra*g*âpati, indeed, is the body. And the Adâbhya <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_338) (cup of Soma) is no other than speech.
When he draws the A*ms*u-cup, and then the Adâbhya-cup, he thereby
constructs the body of this (sacrifice) and then establishes that speech
therein.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:2">11:5:9:2</span></span>2. And,
indeed, the A*ms*u is also the mind, and the Adâbhya speech; and the
A*ms*u is the out-breathing, and the Adâbhya the up-breathing; and the
A*ms*u is the eye, and the Adâbhya the ear: these two cups they draw for
the sake of wholeness and completeness.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:3">11:5:9:3</span></span>3. Now,
the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, were
contending,--it was for this very sacrifice, for Pra*g*âpati, that they
were contending, saying, 'Ours he shall be! ours he shall be!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:4">11:5:9:4</span></span>4. The
gods then went on singing praises, and toiling. They saw this cup of
Soma, this Adâbhya, and drew it: they seized upon the (three)
Soma-services, and possessed themselves of the whole sacrifice, and
excluded the Asuras from the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:5">11:5:9:5</span></span>5. They
spake, 'Surely, we have destroyed (adabhâma) them;' whence (the cup is
called) Adâbhya;--'they have not destroyed (dabh) us;' whence also (it
is called) Adâbhya. And the Adâbhya

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

being speech, this speech is indestructible, whence also it is (called)
Adâbhya; and, verily, in like manner does he who knows this possess
himself of the whole sacrifice of his spiteful enemy, and exclude and
shut out his spiteful enemy from all participation in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:6">11:5:9:6</span></span>6. Into
the same vessel with which he draws the A*ms*u <span
id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_339) he pours water from the
Nigrâbhyâ*h* <span id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_340), and therein puts
those Soma-plants <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_341) with (Vâ*g*. S.
VIII, 47),--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:7">11:5:9:7</span></span>7.
'Thou art taken with a support <span id="fr_342"></span>[4](#fn_342):
for Agni I take thee, possessed of the Gâyatrî metre!'--the
morning-service is of Gâyatrî nature: he thus possesses himself of the
morning-service;--'For Indra I take thee, possessed of the Trish*t*ubh
metre!'--the midday-service is of Trish*t*ubh nature: he thus possesses
himself of the midday-service;--'For the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* I take thee,
possessed of the *G*agatî metre!'--the evening-service is of *G*agatî
nature: he thus possesses himself of the evening-service;--'The
Anush*t*ubh is thy song of praise;'--whatever is subsequent to the
(three) services <span id="fr_343"></span>[5](#fn_343), that is of
Anush*t*ubh nature: it is thereof he thus possesses

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

himself. He does not press this (batch of Soma-plants) lest he should
injure speech (or, the voice of the sacrifice), for the press-stone is a
thunderbolt, and the Adâbhya is speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:8">11:5:9:8</span></span>8. He
merely shakes the (cup with the) plants with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 48), 'In
the flow of the streaming (waters) I waft thee! in the flow of the
gurgling I waft thee! in the flow of the jubilant I waft thee! in the
flow of the most delightsome I waft thee! in the flow of the most sweet
I waft thee!' These doubtless are the divine waters: he thus bestows sap
on him (Pra*g*âpati, the sacrifice) by means of both the divine and the
human waters which there are.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:9">11:5:9:9</span></span>9.
'Thee, the bright, I waft in the bright,'--for he indeed wafts the
bright one in the bright;--'in the form of the day, in the rays of the
sun;'--he thus wafts it both in the form of the day and in the rays of
the sun.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:10">11:5:9:10</span></span>10.
\[Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 41\], 'Mightily shineth the towering form of the
ball,'--for mightily indeed shines that towering form of the ball, to
wit, yonder burning (sun);--'the bright one, the leader of the bright
one, Soma, the leader of Soma,'--he thereby makes that bright (sun) the
leader of the bright (Soma), and Soma the leader of the Soma;--'what
indestructible, watchful name there is of thine, for that do I take
thee;'--for this, to wit, speech, is indeed his (Soma's) indestructible
(adâbhya), watchful name: it is thus speech he thereby takes for speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:11">11:5:9:11</span></span>11.
Then, stepping out (from the Havirdhâna shed <span
id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344)) to (the Âhavanîya), he offers with, 'O

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Soma, to this thy
Soma, hail!'--he thus offers Soma to Soma, and so does not throw speech
into the fire <span id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_345). He breathes over
gold <span id="fr_346"></span>[2](#fn_346): the meaning of this is the
same as there (on the occasion of the A*ms*u). He gives as many presents
(to the priests) as for the A*ms*u-graha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:5:9:12">11:5:9:12</span></span>12.
He then puts the Soma-plants back (on the heap of plants in the
Havirdhâna) with (Vâ*g*. S. VIII, 50), 'Enter thou gladly Agni's dear
seat, O divine Soma!--Enter thou willingly Indra's dear seat, O divine
Soma!--As our friend enter thou, O divine Soma, the dear seat of the
Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*!' On that former occasion he possessed himself of the
(three) Soma services; he now restores them again, and causes them to be
no longer used up; and with them thus restored they perform the
sacrifice.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_337"></span>[105:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_337) See IV, 1, 1, 2;
6, 1, 1.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[105:2](sbe44033.htm#fr_338) See part ii, p.
424, note 1.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[106:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_339) See IV, 6, 1, 3
seq.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[106:2](sbe44033.htm#fr_340) That is, the water
originally taken from the Pra*n*îtâ water, and poured into the (square)
Hot*ri*'s cup (made of Udumbara wood), to be used for moistening the
Soma-plants.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[106:3](sbe44033.htm#fr_341) For the Adâbhya he
puts three Soma-plants into the Hot*ri*'s cup.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[106:4](sbe44033.htm#fr_342) According to Kâty.
XII, 6, 15, this portion of the formula--the 'upayâma,' or support--is
repeated before the formulas of each of the three plants, hence also
before 'For Indra . . .,' and 'For the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h* . . .'

<span id="fn_343"></span>[106:5](sbe44033.htm#fr_343) Viz. the Ukthyas,
Sho*d*a*s*in, &c., in forms of Soma-sacrifice other than the
Agnish*t*oma.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[107:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_344) It is there that
the Soma-plants are kept.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[108:1](sbe44033.htm#fr_345) Though the
Adâbhya-graha, that is, the water in which the three Soma-plants are
contained, and which alone is offered, has been identified with speech,
the wording of the formula is such as to protect (the faculty of) speech
from being burned in the fire.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[108:2](sbe44033.htm#fr_346) Just as, after the
offering of the A*ms*u-graha, he smelled at (or breathed over) a piece
of gold fastened to (? or contained in) the spoon, see IV, 6, 1, 6 seqq.
