### THIRD ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE AGNIHOTRA.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:1">11:3:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, the Agnihotrî cow is the speech of the Agnihotra, and her calf
is its mind. Now these two, mind and speech, whilst being one and the
same, are, as it were, distinct from each other: therefore they tie up
the calf and its mother with one and the same rope; and the fire <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177), indeed, is faith, and the ghee truth.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:2">11:3:1:2</span></span>2. Now,
as to this *G*anaka of Videha once asked Yâ*gñ*avalkya, 'Knowest thou
the Agnihotra, Yâ*gñ*avalkya?'--'I know it, O king,' he said.--'What is
it?'--'Milk, indeed.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:3">11:3:1:3</span></span>3. 'If
there were no milk, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With rice and
barley.'--'If there were no rice and barley, wherewith wouldst thou
sacrifice?'--'With what other herbs there are.'--'If there were no other
herbs, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With what forest herbs there
are.'--'If there were no forest herbs, wherewith wouldst thou
sacrifice?'--'With fruit of trees.'--'If there were no fruit of trees,
wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'--'With water.'--'If there were no
water, wherewith wouldst thou sacrifice?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:4">11:3:1:4</span></span>4. He
spake, 'Then, indeed, there would be nothing whatsoever here, and yet
there would be offered--the truth in faith.'--'Thou knowest the
Agnihotra, Yâ*gñ*avalkya: I give thee a hundred cows,' said *G*anaka.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:5">11:3:1:5</span></span>5.
Concerning this point there are also these

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

verses:--'Knowing what <span id="fr_178"></span>[1](#fn_178), does the
offerer of the Agnihotra stay away from his house? how is his wisdom
(manifested) <span id="fr_179"></span>[2](#fn_179)? how is he kept up by
his fires <span id="fr_180"></span>[3](#fn_180)?'--whereby he means to
say, 'How, then, is there no staying away from home on his part <span
id="fr_181"></span>[4](#fn_181)?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:6">11:3:1:6</span></span>6. 'He
who is the swiftest in the worlds <span id="fr_182"></span>[5](#fn_182),
that wise one is found staying abroad: thus (is manifested) his wisdom,
thus he is kept up by his fires;'--he thereby means the mind: it is
owing to his mind that there is no staying away from home on his part.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:7">11:3:1:7</span></span>7.
'When, having gone far away, he heedeth not there his duty, wherein is
that offering of his offered; (and wherein) do they, at his house,
perform the offering of the progress?'--that is to say,--'When, having
gone far away, he there heeds not his duty, wherein does that offering
of his come to be offered?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:3:1:8">11:3:1:8</span></span>8. 'He
who waketh in the worlds and sustaineth all beings, in him that offering
of his is offered, (and in him) do they, at his house, perform the
offering

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

of the progress;'--he thereby means the breath; whence they say, 'The
Agnihotra is breath.'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_177"></span>[46:1](sbe44018.htm#fr_177) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a, the fire, or heat, produced by the rope. Instead of 'te*g*a
eva *s*raddhâ,' one would rather expect '*s*raddhaiva te*g*a*h*.'

<span id="fn_178"></span>[47:1](sbe44018.htm#fr_178) That is, according
to Sâya*n*a,--What form of Agnihotra does he recognise, when he goes to
stay abroad?

<span id="fn_179"></span>[47:2](sbe44018.htm#fr_179) That is,--How does
he show his knowledge of the sacred obligation that one ought to perform
the Agnihotra regularly twice a day for life?

<span id="fn_180"></span>[47:3](sbe44018.htm#fr_180) That is to say, How
is the continuity in the constant attendance to his sacred fires kept up
by him?

<span id="fn_181"></span>[47:4](sbe44018.htm#fr_181) Literally, 'How is
non-staying abroad (brought about)?' that is to say,--How, though having
to stay abroad, does he ensure the spiritual benefits of remaining at
home? or, as Sâya*n*a puts it, How is the fault of staying abroad,
avoided?--asya pravasato ya*g*amânasya anapaproshitam
pravâsadoshâbhâva*h*.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[47:5](sbe44018.htm#fr_182) Or, among (or in)
beings. Sâya*n*a supplies 'ya*g*amâna*h*' to 'yo *g*avish*th*a*h*.'
