For that Anush<I>t</I>ubh, doubtless, is the highest metre, and the horse is the highest of animals; and the Katush<I>t</I>oma is the highest of Stomas: by means of what is highest he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach the highest position.</p>

As to this they say, 'If there were a twelvefold altar, and eleven stakes, it would be as if one were to drive on a cart drawn by one beast.' There are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: that is as when one drives with side-horses.</p>

And, indeed, he who knows the three tops on the A<I>s</I>vamedha, becomes the top of kings;--there are the twenty-one-fold altar, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, and twenty-one stakes: these, indeed, are the three tops on the A<I>s</I>vamedha; and, verily, he who thus knows them becomes the top of kings.</p>

V. II, 32-34; figured for chanting in Bibl. Ind. ed. III, p. 89) is ordinarily used for this stotra both in the Agnish<I>t</I>oma, and in the Ukthya, form of sacrifice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_847"></A><A HREF="sbe44096.htm#fr_851">333:2</A> That is, the tune of the third, or Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>kh</I>a<I>m</I>sin's, P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>astotra. For the s&acirc;mans commonly used for this stotra see part ii, p. 434, note 1. The P&acirc;rthura<I>s</I>ma-s&acirc;man may be chanted on either of the texts S&acirc;mav. II, 352-4 (figured ed. Bibl. Ind. vol. V, p. 395) or II, 355-7 (figured vol. V, p. 483). It is the latter text which is to be used on the present occasion. On the legendary origin of this s&acirc;man (which is said to represent 'strength,' and therefore to be appropriate to a R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya) see T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XIII, 4, 17.</P>

It is probably the second of these texts that is to be used here, as it is also used for the same stotra on the second day of the Garga-trir&acirc;tra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_850"></A><A HREF="sbe44096.htm#fr_854">334:1</A> Cp. the corresponding passage, Taitt. S. V, 4, 12, 3, 'that A<I>s</I>vamedha, indeed, is a disused sacrifice, for, say they, who knows if the whole of it is performed or not?' Perhaps, however, 'utsanna-ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a' rather means 'a decayed sacrifice,' i.e. one which has lost (or in the usual performance is apt to lose) some of its original elements; whence the 'Sa<I>m</I>k<I>ri</I>ti' tune is to be used for the purpose of 'making up' the lost parts. Part of the commentary in this passage is not clear to me:--uk<I>k</I>ai<I>h</I>kal&acirc;pagr&acirc;m&acirc;dau siddhasth&acirc;ne satrasthito granthato<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>rthata<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a yat ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a utsannaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a esha ya<I>h</I> a<I>s</I>vamedha<I>h</I> katham utsanna ity ata &acirc;ha, ki<I>m</I> v&acirc; h&icirc;ti, yasya dharm&acirc;<I>h</I> p&ucirc;rvayonau (? p&ucirc;rvayuge) prayu<I>g</I>yante tesh&acirc;<I>m</I> kim<I>k</I>it kalau kriyate ki<I>m</I><I>k</I>in na kriyate, tata<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a sa<I>m</I>k<I>ri</I>tir a<I>kh</I>&acirc;v&acirc;kas&acirc;ma bhavati.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_852"></A><A HREF="sbe44096.htm#fr_856">334:3</A> The commentary seems to take both '<I>ri</I>shabha' and 'v<I>ri</I>shan' here in the sense of 'bulls,' but cp. Taitt. Br.
