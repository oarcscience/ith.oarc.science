### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:2:1">13:3:2:1</span></span>1. Now
this (Sacrificer), having- conquered by means of the supreme Stoma--the
Katush*t*oma, the K*ri*ta among dice <span
id="fr_843"></span>[3](#fn_839),--on the next day establishes

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

himself on the Ekavi*ms*a <span id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_840), as a
firm foundation: from the Ekavi*ms*a, as a firm foundation, he
subsequently ascends to the next day, the seasons; for the P*ri*sh*th*a
(-stotras) are the seasons, and the seasons are the year: it is in the
seasons, in the year, he establishes himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:2:2">13:3:2:2</span></span>2. The
*S*akvarî <span id="fr_845"></span>[2](#fn_841) (verses) are the
P*ri*sh*th*a (-stotra of the second day): there is a different metre for
each (verse), for different kinds of animals, both domestic and wild
ones, are immolated here on each (day). As to the *S*akvarî (verses)
being the P*ri*sh*th*a, it is for the completeness of the horse
(sacrifice) <span id="fr_846"></span>[3](#fn_842); and different kinds
of animals are immolated on different (days), because different stomas
are performed on the different (days of the A*s*vamedha).

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:2:3">13:3:2:3</span></span>3. As
to this they say, 'These--to wit, goats and sheep and the wild
(beasts)--are not all animals <span id="fr_847"></span>[1](#fn_843); but
those--to wit, the bovine (victims)--are indeed all animals.' On the
last day he immolates bovine (victims), for they--to wit, bovine
(victims)--are all animals: he thus immolates all animals. They are
sacred to the All-gods <span id="fr_848"></span>[2](#fn_844), for the
completeness of the horse, for the horse is sacred to the All-gods. They
are many-formed (or, many-coloured), whence animals are many-formed; and
they are of distinct forms (or colours), whence animals are of distinct
forms.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_839"></span>[330:3](sbe44095.htm#fr_843) For this and the
other names of the dice, see part iii, p. 106, note 1.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[331:1](sbe44095.htm#fr_844) Though applying in
the first place to the second day of the A*s*vamedha, as an Ukthya
sacrifice which is at the same time an Ekavi*ms*a day, i.e. one the
stotras of which are all chanted in the twenty-one-versed hymn-form,
Ekavi*ms*a, the twenty-first or twenty-one-fold, as is clear from [XIII,
3, 3, 3](sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:3), here also refers to the sun, of which
it is a common epithet (cf. part iii, p. 265, note 2, also [XIII, 4, 4,
11](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:11)). This solar name seems to be derived from
the fact that the sun is also identified with the central day of the
year, the Vishuvant day, which is considered the central day of a
twenty-one days’ sacrificial performance--having one
p*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha, an Abhi*g*it (or Vi*s*va*g*it day resp.) and
three svarasâman days before and after it;--see [p.
139](sbe44046.htm#page_139), note \*[1](sbe44046.htm#fn_425)\*; and A.
Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 6 seqq.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[331:2](sbe44095.htm#fr_845) That is to say,
the so-called Mahânâmnî verses (Sâm. V. ed. Bibl. Ind. II, p. 371),
chanted on the *s*âkvara-sâman (see part iii, of this transl., introd.
p. xx, note 2), are to be used for the Hot*ri*'s P*ri*sh*th*a-stotra.
For this purpose the Rathantara-sâman is ordinarily used in the
Agnish*t*oma, and the B*ri*hat-sâman in the Ukthya, form of sacrifice.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[331:3](sbe44095.htm#fr_846) The commentator
takes this as an allusion to the 'potent' (*s*akvara = *s*akta) nature
of the verses.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[332:1](sbe44095.htm#fr_847) That is to say,
they do not fitly represent all kinds of animals, as the highest kind of
animals, the bovine cattle, may be said to do. The argument as to the
'sarve pa*s*ava*h*' is, of course, suggested by the 'a*s*vasya
sarvatvâya' of the preceding paragraph; and to bring out the
parallelism, one might translate,--these . . . . are not complete
animals.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[332:2](sbe44095.htm#fr_848) See [XIII, 5, 3,
11](sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:11).
