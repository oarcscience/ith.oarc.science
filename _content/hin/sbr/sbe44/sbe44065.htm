<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:1:8">12:7:1:8</A></FONT></span>8.

<p>and became the nyagrodha tree (ficus indica); from his marrow his drink, the Soma juice, flowed, and became rice: in this way his energies, or vital powers, went from him.</p>

Namu<I>k</I>i bethought him, 'He has been undone once for all: I will seize upon his energy, his vital power, his Soma-drink, his food,' By (taking) that Sur&acirc;-liquor of his he seized upon his energy, or vital power, his Soma-drink, his food. He lay there dissolved. The gods gathered around him, and said, 'Verily, he was the best of us; evil has befallen him: let us heal him!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:1:11">12:7:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. They said to the two A<I>s</I>vins, 'Ye are Brahman physicians: heal ye this one!' They replied, 'Let there be a guerdon for us!' They spake, 'That he-goat there shall be your guerdon.' They said, 'So be it!' and hence the smoke-coloured (he-goat) is sacred to the two A<I>s</I>vins.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:1:12">12:7:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. They (the gods) said to Sarasvat&icirc;, 'Verily, thou art healing medicine: heal thou this one!' She replied, 'Let there be a guerdon for me!' They spake, 'That ram there shall be thy guerdon!' She said, 'So be it!' and therefore the ram is sacred to Sarasvat&icirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:1:13">12:7:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. They then spake, 'Verily, there is even now as much in him (Indra) as that -bull: that one shall belong to him himself.' They said, 'So be it!' and therefore the bull is sacred to Indra.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:1:14">12:7:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. The two A<I>s</I>vins and Sarasvat&icirc;, having taken the energy, or vital power, from Namu<I>k</I>i, restored them to hire (Indra), and saved him from evil, 'Truly, we have saved him from evil so as to be well-saved (sutr&acirc;ta),' they thought, and this became</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;: and this is the (saving) nature of the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;--it saves the self from death, and repels evil for whosoever thus knows that (saving) nature of the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;. There are (for this sacrifice) thirty-three Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s (presents to priests), for thirty-three were the gods who healed him: whence they say, 'Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s are healing medicine.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_564"></A><A HREF="sbe44065.htm#fr_565">213:2</A> The Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is usually classed as one of the seven divisions of the Havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, though, in reality, it is much more than that; its peculiarity consisting in a combination of the ordinary features of the Havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, or ish<I>t</I>i (cf. XII, 7, 2, 22), with those of the animal sacrifice, whilst a third important element, viz. libations of spirituous liquor, imparts to it a certain resemblance, and doubtless an intended resemblance, to the Soma-sacrifice. Of this sacrifice we have already met with a variation in connection with the R&acirc;<I>g</I>as&ucirc;ya (cf. part iii, p. 229 seq.), that form being usually called the <I>K</I>araka-Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, as being adopted from the ritual of the <I>K</I>araka-adhvaryus; whilst the form described in the remaining portion of the present K&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>a is, according to L&acirc;<I>t</I>y. <I>S</I>raut. V, 4, 20, called Kaukili Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;. (cf. &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. III, 9, 9 comm.; Weber, Ind. Stud. III, p. 385). The name itself is derived from 'sutr&acirc;man,' i.e. 'the good guardian,' as which Indra is worshipped in this sacrifice (cf. V, 5, 4. 1 seq.). The whole performance takes four days, during the first three of which the Sur&acirc;-liquor is prepared and matured, and offerings of a rice-pap to Aditi, and a bull to Indra are performed; whilst the main sacrifice takes place on the fourth day--the day of either full moon or new moon--the chief oblations offered on that day being three cups of milk, and as many of Sur&acirc;-liquor, to the A<I>s</I>vins, Sarasvat&icirc;, and Indra respectively; of three animal victims to the same deities; and of thirty-three libations of fat gravy, or liquid fat (vas&acirc;), obtained from the cooking of the victims, and offered by means of bull's hoofs used as cups. At the end of the sacrifice, a third bull is offered to Indra in his form of Vayodhas (giver of life), together with another pap <A NAME="page_214"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 214</FONT></A> (<I>k</I>aru) to Aditi and an oblation of curds to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a. No mention is made of the Agn&icirc;shom&icirc;ya he-goat usually offered .on the day preceding the Soma-pressing, the first bull offered to Indra probably taking its place on this occasion, whilst the hull to Indra Vayodhas would seem to take the place of the sacrifice of a barren cow (to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a) which usually takes place at the end of a Soma-sacrifice. In an interesting variation (Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>a-ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a), described in <I>S</I>&acirc;&#7749;kh. <I>S</I>r. XIV, 12-13, and performed as a real (Agnish<I>t</I>oma) Soma-sacrifice, the final animal sacrifice indeed is that of a barren cow to Indra Sutr&acirc;man; only two other victims--a reddish he-goat to the A<I>s</I>vins and a ewe to Sarasvat&icirc;--being mentioned.</P>
