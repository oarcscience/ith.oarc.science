But, indeed, distinction, royal sway, departs from him who performs the horse-sacrifice; and when a man attains to distinction, the lute is played to him. Two Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>ical lute-players sing (and play) for a year; for that--to wit, the lute--is a form (attribute) of distinction: it is distinction they thus confer upon him.</p>

Concerning this they say, &#8216;Were both to be Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as who sing, noble rank (or political power) would depart from him; for he--to wit, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a--is a form of the priestly office; and the nobility takes no delight in the priestly office (or priesthood).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:1:5:3">13:1:5:3</A></FONT></span>3. &#8216;And were both to be R&acirc;<I>g</I>anyas (nobles), spiritual lustre would depart from him; for he--to wit, the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya--is a form of noble rank, and spiritual lustre takes no delight in noble rank.' One of those who sing is a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, and the other a R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya; for the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a means priestly office, and the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya noble rank: thus his distinction (social position) comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the nobility.</p>

Concerning this they say, &#8216;Were both to sing by day, his distinction would be apt to fall away from him: for that--to wit, the day--is a form of the priestly dignity; and when the king chooses he may oppress (despoil) the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, but he will fare the worse (or, become the poorer) for it.</p>

'And if both (were to sing) at night, spiritual lustre would fall away from him; for that--to wit, the night--is a form of the nobility, and spiritual lustre takes no delight in the nobility.'

'Such war he waged,--such battle he won!' such (are the topics about which) the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya sings; for the battle is the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya's strength: it is with strength he thus endows him. Three stanzas the one sings, and three stanzas the other, they amount to six,--six seasons make up a year: he thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the seasons, in the year. To both of them he presents a hundred; for man has a life of a hundred (years), and a hundred energies: it is vitality and energy, vital power, he confers upon him.</p>
