### EIGHTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:8:1">11:1:8:1</span></span>1. Now,
the gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra*g*âpati, once
strove together. Then the Asuras, even through arrogance, thinking,
'Unto whom, forsooth, should we make offering?' went on offering into
their own mouths. They came to naught, even through arrogance: wherefore
let no one be arrogant, for verily arrogance is the cause of ruin <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120).

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:8:2">11:1:8:2</span></span>2. But
the gods went on offering unto one another. Pra*g*âpati gave himself up
to them, and the sacrifice became theirs; for, indeed, the sacrifice is
the food of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:8:3">11:1:8:3</span></span>3.
Having given himself up to the gods, he created that counterpart of
himself, to wit, the sacrifice: whence people say, 'The sacrifice is
Pra*g*âpati;' for he created it as a counterpart of himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:8:4">11:1:8:4</span></span>4. By
this (Full and New-moon) sacrifice he redeemed himself from the gods.
Now when he (the Sacrificer) enters on the fast, he thereby gives
himself up to the gods, even as Pra*g*âpati thereby gave himself up to
the gods. Let him therefore endeavour to pass that night (with his mind)
completely restrained <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121), in the same
way as he would

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

proceed with (material for) an oblation, for he becomes an oblation to
the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:8:5">11:1:8:5</span></span>5. And
when (on the following day) he performs the sacrifice, then he redeems
himself by sacrifice from the gods, even as Pra*g*âpati thereby redeemed
himself: when he takes out the material for (the chief) sacrificial
dish, he redeems the sacrifice by the material for the sacrificial dish;
the sacrificial dish (he redeems) by the invitatory formula, the
invitatory formula by the portion cut (from the sacrificial dish), the
portion by the offering-formula, the offering--formula by the
Vasha*t*-call, and the Vasha*t*-call by the oblation. His oblation
itself is still unredeemed,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:8:6">11:1:8:6</span></span>6. And
that sacrifice of his is like a tree with its top broken off. He redeems
the oblation by the Anvâhârya (mess of rice) <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122); and because he thereby supplies
(anv-â-harati) what is wanting in the sacrifice, therefore it is called
Anvâhârya. Thus, then, that entire sacrifice of his comes to be
redeemed; and that sacrifice becomes the Sacrificer's self in yonder
world. And, verily, the Sacrificer who, knowing this, performs that
(offering of) redemption comes into existence in yonder world with a
complete body.

<span id="fn_121"></span>[22:3](sbe44010.htm#fr_121) Professor Delbrück,
Altind. Syntax, p. 350, takes this injunction, and apparently also the
illustration, to refer to sexual intercourse. Cf. I, 1, 1, 11.
