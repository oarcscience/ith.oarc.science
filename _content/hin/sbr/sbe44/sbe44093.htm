He perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the A<I>s</I>vamedha; he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more numerous: hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous, let him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the A<I>s</I>vamedha; and he indeed becomes great and more numerous.</p>

<p>to the gods!' and 'To the gods hail!' he makes offering by means of the king (Soma) on both sides of the omentum: he thereby gratifies those gods who are in this world, and those who are in the other, and thus gratified, both these kinds of gods lead him to the heavenly world.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_834"></A><A HREF="sbe44093.htm#fr_838">327:2</A> The formula uttered whilst the first Mahiman cup is offered runs thus (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIII, 2): 'What greatness of thine there hath <A NAME="page_328"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 328</FONT></A> been in the day and the year; what greatness of thine there hath been in the wind and the air; what greatness of thine there hath been in the heavens and the sun, to that greatness of thine, to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, hail, to the gods!' whilst that of the second Mahiman cup runs thus (XXIII, 4): 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the night and the year; what greatness of thine there hath been in the earth and the fire; what greatness of thine there hath been in the Nakshatras (lunar asterisms) and the moon, to that greatness of thine, to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, to the gods, hail!' cf. <a href="sbe44107.htm#13:5:2:23">XIII, 5, 2, 23</A>; <a href="sbe44108.htm#13:5:3:7">3, 7</A>.</P>
