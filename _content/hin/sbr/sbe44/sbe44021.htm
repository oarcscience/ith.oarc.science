By him a gold coin was offered; for in the time of our forefathers a prize used to be offered by chosen (priests) when driving about, for the sake of calling out the timid&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_192"></A><A HREF="#fn_192"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to a disputation.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:4:1:3">11:4:1:3</A></FONT></span>3. They said, 'Svaid&acirc;yana, with thee as our champion we will fight this fellow.'

He went up to him, and when he had come up, he (Udd&acirc;laka) greeted him saying,</p>

And he then spoke thus to him:--The two libations of ghee, the five fore-offerings, and, eighth, Agni's butter-portion--these are the eight butter-portions (offered) previously. Soma's butter-portion, being the first of the portions of sacrificial food--for Soma is sacrificial food,---Agni's cake, Agni-Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni-Soma's cake, and (the offering to) Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t--these are the five portions of sacrificial food in the middle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:4:1:11">11:4:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. The fore-portion, the I<I>d</I>&acirc;, what he hands to the Agn&icirc;dh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_199"></A><A HREF="#fn_199"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Brahman's portion, the Sacrificer's portion, and the Anv&acirc;h&acirc;rya (mess of rice)--these are the six (portions) of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. The three after-offerings, the four Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as, and, eighth, the Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us--these are the eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:4:1:12">11:4:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. And inasmuch as the fore-offerings are without invitatory formulas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_200"></A><A HREF="#fn_200"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, therefore creatures are horn here without teeth; and inasmuch as the chief oblations have invitatory formulas, therefore they (the teeth) grow in them; and inasmuch as the after-offerings are without invitatory formulas, therefore they (the teeth) decay in them; and inasmuch as the Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as as have invitatory formulas,</p>

<p>therefore they (the teeth) come to remain permanently with them; and inasmuch as the Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us is without invitatory formula, therefore they all decay again in the last stage of life.</p>

And inasmuch as, after uttering the invitatory formula, he offers with the offering-formula, therefore the lower (teeth) grow first, then the upper ones; and inasmuch as, after uttering a g&acirc;yatr&icirc; verse as invitatory formula, he offers with a trish<I>t</I>ubh verse&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_201"></A><A HREF="#fn_201"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, therefore the lower (teeth) are smaller, and the upper ones broader; and inasmuch as he pours out the two libations of ghee in a forward direction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_202"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, therefore the incisors are larger; and inasmuch as the two sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;s&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_203"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> are in the same metre, therefore the molars are of equal size.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:4:1:15">11:4:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. And inasmuch as the fore-offerings have ghee for their offering-material, a boy's seed is not productive, but is like water, for ghee is like water; and inasmuch as, in the middle of the sacrifice, they sacrifice with sour curds&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and with cake, therefore it is productive in his middle stage of life, for thick-flowing, as it were, is (that havis), and thick-flowing, as it were, is seed; and inasmuch as the after-offerings have ghee for their offering-material, it again is not productive in his last stage of life, and is like water, for ghee, indeed, is like water.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:4:1:16">11:4:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. The Vedi (altar-ground), doubtless, is the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;: the eight butter-portions (offered) previously are her right wing, and the eight butter-portions (offered) subsequently are her left wing: that same golden, brilliant-winged G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, indeed, bears the Sacrificer who knows this to the heavenly world.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_192"></A><A HREF="sbe44021.htm#fr_192">51:1</A> It is by no means certain whether the interpretation of the paragraph as here adapted is the right one. Prof. Geldner takes it thus,--'He (Udd.) had taken a gold piece with him; for in times of old the chosen (priests) who caused a crowd to gather round them, used to take a single gold piece with them with a view to their proposing a riddle (or problem) whenever they were afraid.' The Gopatha-Br. has a different reading, which is likewise far from clear:--tasya ha nishka up&acirc;hito babh&ucirc;va, upav&acirc;d&acirc;d bibhyato yo ma br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>o<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>n&ucirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;na upavadishyati tasm&acirc; etam prad&acirc;sy&acirc;m&icirc;ti;--by him a gold coin was offered (? by him a gold plate had been put on, i.e. was worn round the neck) being afraid of obloquy (?): 'I shall give this to any learned Brahman who will speak up against me,' thus (he thought).</P>
