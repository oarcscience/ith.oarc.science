### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:1">13:4:4:1</span></span>1. When
the year has expired <span id="fr_967"></span>[1](#fn_962), the Dîkshâ
(initiation) takes place. After the slaughtering of the victim sacred to
Pra*g*âpati <span id="fr_968"></span>[2](#fn_963), the (ish*t*i)
offerings <span id="fr_969"></span>[3](#fn_964) come to an end. Some,
however, say, ‘Let him offer (them) on the fires of his Purohita
(court-chaplain). But why should one who is initiated make offering?
There are twelve Dîkshâ (days), twelve Upasad (days) and three Sutyâs
(Soma-days), that amounts to the thrice-ninefold (stoma); but the
thrice-ninefold, indeed, is a thunderbolt, and the horse is the nobility
(kshatra), and the Râ*g*anya is the nobility; and political power
(kshatra) is won by the thunderbolt: thus he wins <span
id="fr_970"></span>[4](#fn_965) political power by means of the
thunderbolt.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:2">13:4:4:2</span></span>2. When
the Initiation-offering has been completed, and Speech released in the
evening, masters

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

of lute-players have come thither: these the Adhvaryu calls upon,
'Masters of lute-players,' he says, 'sing ye of this Sacrificer along
with the gods!' and they accordingly sing of him in that manner--

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:3">13:4:4:3</span></span>3. Day
by day, after speech has been released, when, on the completion of the
Agnîshomîya (animal sacrifices), the Vasatîvarî (water) has been carried
round <span id="fr_971"></span>[1](#fn_966) (the sacrificial ground).
The reason why they thus sing of him along with the gods is that they
thereby make him share the same world with the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:4">13:4:4:4</span></span>4. On
the Sutyâ-days (they sing of him) along with Pra*g*âpati in the same way
day by day, after the Vasatîvarî (water) has been carried round <span
id="fr_972"></span>[2](#fn_967), and the Udavasânîyâ (offering) has been
finally completed. The reason why they thus sing of him

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

along with Pra*g*âpati is that they thereby finally make him share the
same world with Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:5">13:4:4:5</span></span>5.
There are twenty-one sacrificial stakes, all of them twenty-one cubits
long. The central one <span id="fr_973"></span>[1](#fn_968) is of
ra*gg*udâla <span id="fr_974"></span>[2](#fn_969) wood; on both sides
thereof stand two <span id="fr_975"></span>[3](#fn_970) pîtudâru
(deodar) ones, six of bilva wood (Aegle Marmelos)--three on this side,
and three on that,--six of khadira (Acacia Catechu) wood--three on this
side, and three on that,--six of palâ*s*a (Butea frondosa) wood--three
on this side, and three on that.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:6">13:4:4:6</span></span>6. Then
as to why these stakes are suchlike. When Pra*g*âpati's vital airs had
gone out of him, his body began to swell; and what phlegm there was in
it that flowed together and burst forth from inside through the nose,
and it became this tree, the ra*gg*udâla, whence it is viscid, for it
originated from phlegm: with that form (quality) he thus endows it (the
stake). And as to why it is the (stake) standing by the fire, it is
because that one is the centre of the stakes, and that nose is the
centre of the (channels of the) vital airs: he thus puts it in its own
place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:7">13:4:4:7</span></span>7. And
what watery (liquid) fire, and what fragrance there was, that flowed
together and

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

burst forth from the eye, and became that tree, the pîtudâru; whence
that (wood) is sweet-smelling, since it originated from fragrance, and
whence it is inflammable, since it originated from fire: with that
quality he thus endows it. And because these two (pîtudâru stakes) are
on the two sides of the central one, therefore these two eyes are on the
two sides of the nose: he thus puts those two in their own place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:8">13:4:4:8</span></span>8. And
what 'kuntâpa <span id="fr_976"></span>[1](#fn_971),' what marrow there
was, that flowed together, and burst forth from the ear, and became that
tree, the bilva; whence all the fruit of that (tree) is eatable <span
id="fr_977"></span>[2](#fn_972) inside, and whence it (the tree, or
wood) is yellowish, for marrow is yellowish: with that quality he thus
endows it. The two (sets of) pîtudâru (stakes) stand inside, and the
bilva ones outside, for the eyes are inside, and the ears outside: he
thus puts them in their own place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:9">13:4:4:9</span></span>9. From
his (Pra*g*âpati's) bones the khadira, was produced, whence that (tree)
is hard and of great strength <span id="fr_978"></span>[3](#fn_973), for
hard, as it were, is bone: with that quality he thus endows it. The
bilva (stakes) are

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

inside, and the khadira ones outside, for inside is the marrow, and
outside the bones: he thus puts them in their own place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:10">13:4:4:10</span></span>10.
From his flesh the palâ*s*a was produced, whence that (tree) has much
juice, and (that) red juice <span
id="fr_979"></span>[1](sbe44106.htm#fn_974), for red, as it were, is
flesh: with that quality he thus endows it. The khadira (stakes) are
inside, and the palâ*s*a ones outside, for inside are the bones, and
outside is the flesh: he thus puts them in their own place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:4:4:11">13:4:4:11</span></span>11.
And as to why there are twenty-one (stakes), twenty-one cubits
long,--twenty-one-fold, indeed, is he that shines yonder <span
id="fr_980"></span>[2](sbe44106.htm#fn_975)--there are twelve months,
five seasons, these three worlds, and yonder sun is the twenty-first,
and he is the A*s*vamedha, and this Pra*g*âpati. Having thus completely
restored this Pra*g*âpati, the sacrifice, he therein seizes twenty-one
Agnîshomîya victims: for these there is one and the same performance,
and this is the performance of the day before (the first Sutyâ).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_962"></span>[371:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_967) Viz. from the day
of the setting free the horse, not from that of the mess of rice cooked
for the four priests.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[371:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_968) That is, according
to the comm., the he-goat offered to Pra*g*âpati (along with one, or
five, to Vâyu) in connection with the building of the fire-altar (which
is required for the A*s*vamedha), see part iii, pp. 165 seqq., 171 seqq.
The building of the altar, generally occupying the space of a year, is
apparently compressed on this occasion within the time of the Dîkshâ and
Upasads.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[371:3](sbe44105.htm#fr_969) Viz. the three
ish*t*is to Savit*ri* performed daily throughout the year.

<span id="fn_965"></span>[371:4](sbe44105.htm#fr_970) One would expect
here the middle (sp*rin*ute) instead of the active (sp*rin*oti); cf.
Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 259.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[372:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_971) See part ii, p.
222 seqq. Whilst there the offering of a he-goat to Agni and Soma took
place on the Upavasatha, or day before the Sutyâ or Soma-day, on the
present occasion these preliminary animal sacrifices would also seem to
be performed on each day from the completion of the Dîkshâ up to the
Upavasatha day inclusive (? i.e. on the Upasad days, cf. Kâty. *S*r. XX.
3, 9; 4, 21). Moreover, though technically called Agnîshomîya, the
sacrifice--on the Upavasatha day, at all events ([XIII, 4, 4,
11](sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:11))--is not one of a single he-goat sacred to
Agni and Soma, but a set of eleven victims distributed over the central
eleven stakes (of which twenty-one are required on the Soma-days) in the
manner explained in III, 9, 1, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_967"></span>[372:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_972) That is, at the
end of each of the three Soma-sacrifices, see part ii, p. 454. The
Udavasânîyâ (completing offering) takes place before the carrying round
of the sacred water (ib. p. 389 seqq.). According to Kâty. XX, 3, 10-11,
however, this singing of the Sacrificer's praises along with those of
Pra*g*âpati is to take place not only at the juncture specified in the
text, but also at the beginning of the animal sacrifice of the
Soma-days, that is, as would seem, prior to the slaying of the victims,
at the morning pressing. The wording of our text seems hardly to admit
of this interpretation.

<span id="fn_968"></span>[373:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_973) That is, the
so-called 'agnish*th*a,' 'standing by (or opposite) the (Âhavanîya)
fire.' Cp. [p. 301](sbe44084.htm#page_301), note
[1](sbe44084.htm#fn_761).

<span id="fn_969"></span>[373:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_974) The ra*gg*udâla
(or râ*gg*udâla, Sây. on Taitt. Br. III, 8, 19, 1) or 'sleshmâtaka' is
the Cordia Myxa or C. latifolia, from the bark of which (according to
Stewart and Brandis, Forest Flora of N.W. and Centr. India) ropes
(ra*gg*u) are made, whence doubtless the above, as well as its
scientific name, is derived; whilst 'the adhesive viscid pulp is used as
bird-lime.'

<span id="fn_970"></span>[373:3](sbe44105.htm#fr_975) That is, one on
each side, right and left.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[374:1](sbe44105.htm#fr_976) See [p.
264](sbe44071.htm#page_264), note [1](sbe44072.htm#fn_660). It would
certainly seem to be something connected with the spinal cord.

<span id="fn_972"></span>[374:2](sbe44105.htm#fr_977) According to
Stewart and Brandis, the Aegle Marmelos is cultivated throughout India,
and valued for its fruit, which is 'globose, oblong, or pyriform, 2 to 5
in. diam., with a smooth, grey or yellow rind, and a thick,
orange-coloured, sweet aromatic pulp.' The flowers are stated to be
greenish white, and 'the wood light-coloured, mottled with darker wavy
lines and small light-coloured dots.'

<span id="fn_973"></span>[374:3](sbe44105.htm#fr_978) The wood of Acacia
Catechu is described as dark red, and extremely hard and durable, and
hence not liable to be attacked by white ants, and not touched by Teredo
navalis; being much used for pestles, seed-crushers, cotton-rollers,
wheel-wright's work, ploughs, bows, spear and sword-handles.
