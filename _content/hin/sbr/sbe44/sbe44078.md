### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:5:1">13:1:5:1</span></span>1. But,
indeed, distinction, royal sway, departs from him who performs the
horse-sacrifice; and when a man attains to distinction, the lute is
played to him. Two Brâhma*n*ical lute-players sing (and play) for a
year; for that--to wit, the lute--is a form (attribute) of distinction:
it is distinction they thus confer upon him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:5:2">13:1:5:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they say, ‘Were both to be Brâhma*n*as who sing, noble
rank (or political power) would depart from him; for he--to wit, a
Brâhma*n*a--is a form of the priestly office; and the nobility takes no
delight in the priestly office (or priesthood).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:5:3">13:1:5:3</span></span>3. ‘And
were both to be Râ*g*anyas (nobles), spiritual lustre would depart from
him; for he--to wit, the Râ*g*anya--is a form of noble rank, and
spiritual lustre takes no delight in noble rank.' One of those who sing
is a Brâhma*n*a, and the other a Râ*g*anya; for the Brâhma*n*a means
priestly office, and the Râ*g*anya noble rank: thus his distinction
(social position) comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood
and the nobility.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:5:4">13:1:5:4</span></span>4.
Concerning this they say, ‘Were both to sing by day, his distinction
would be apt to fall away from him: for that--to wit, the day--is a form
of the priestly dignity; and when the king chooses he may oppress
(despoil) the Brâhma*n*a, but he will fare the worse (or, become the
poorer) for it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:5:5">13:1:5:5</span></span>5. 'And
if both (were to sing) at night, spiritual lustre would fall away from
him; for that--to wit, the night--is a form of the nobility, and
spiritual lustre takes no delight in the nobility.' The Brâhma*n*a sings
by day <span id="fr_720"></span>[1](#fn_716), and the Râ*g*anya at
night <span id="fr_721"></span>[2](#fn_717); and thus, indeed, his
distinction comes to be guarded on either side by the priesthood and the
nobility <span id="fr_722"></span>[3](#fn_718).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:5:6">13:1:5:6</span></span>6.
'Such sacrifices he offered,--such gifts he gave!' such (are the topics
about which) the

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Brâhma*n*a
sings <span id="fr_723"></span>[1](#fn_719); for to the Brâhma*n*a
belongs the fulfilment of wishes <span
id="fr_724"></span>[2](sbe44079.htm#fn_720): it is with the fulfilment
of wishes he (the Brâhma*n*a) thus endows him (the Sacrificer). 'Such
war he waged,--such battle he won!' such (are the topics about which)
the Râ*g*anya sings; for the battle is the Râ*g*anya's strength: it is
with strength he thus endows him. Three stanzas the one sings, and three
stanzas the other, they amount to six,--six seasons make up a year: he
thus establishes (the Sacrificer) in the seasons, in the year. To both
of them he presents a hundred; for man has a life of a hundred (years),
and a hundred energies: it is vitality and energy, vital power, he
confers upon him.
