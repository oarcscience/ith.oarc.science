### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:1">13:6:2:1</span></span>1. And
as to why it is called Purushamedha:--The stronghold (pur) doubtless is
these worlds, and the Purusha (spirit) is he that blows here (the wind),
he bides (*s*î) in this stronghold (pur): hence he is the Purusha. And
whatever food there is in these worlds that is its 'medha,' its food;
and inasmuch as this is its 'medha,' its food, therefore (it is called)
Purushamedha. And inasmuch as at this (sacrifice) he seizes <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[1](#fn_1059) men (purusha) meet for sacrifice
(medhya), therefore also it is called Purushamedha.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:2">13:6:2:2</span></span>2. He
seizes them on the central day, for the central day is the air, and the
air is the abode of all beings; and, indeed, these victims are also
food, and the central day is the belly: he thus puts food in the belly.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:3">13:6:2:3</span></span>3. He
seizes them by decades <span id="fr_1066"></span>[2](#fn_1060) for the
obtainment

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

of all food, for the Virâ*g* consists of ten syllables, and the Virâ*g*
is all food <span id="fr_1067"></span>[1](#fn_1061).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:4">13:6:2:4</span></span>4.
Eleven decades <span id="fr_1068"></span>[2](#fn_1062) he seizes;--the
Trish*t*ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh is the
thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the
Sacrificer thus repels evil from within him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:5">13:6:2:5</span></span>5.
Forty-eight he seizes at the central stake;--the *G*agatî consists of
forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of *G*âgata (movable) nature: by
means of the *G*agatî he (the priest) secures cattle for him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:6">13:6:2:6</span></span>6.
Eleven at each of the others;--the Trish*t*ubh consists of eleven
syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the
thunderbolt,

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from about him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:7">13:6:2:7</span></span>7. Last
of all he seizes eight;--the Gâyatrî consists of eight syllables, and
the Gâyatrî is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes the Brahman to be the
ultimate thing of this universe, whence they say that the Brahman is the
ultimate thing of this universe.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:8">13:6:2:8</span></span>8.
These (eight) are sacred to Pra*g*âpati, Pra*g*âpati assuredly is the
Brahman, for Pra*g*âpati is of the nature of the Brahman <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[1](#fn_1063): therefore they are sacred to
Pra*g*âpati.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:9">13:6:2:9</span></span>9. When
about to bring up the victims, he offers those three oblations to
Savit*ri*, with (Vâ*g*. S. XXX, 1-3), 'God Savit*ri*, (speed the
sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his share)!'--'May we obtain
that glorious light of the God Savit*ri*, (who shall inspire our
prayers)!'--'All troubles remove thou from us, O God Savit*ri*: bestow
unto us what is auspicious!' He thus pleases Savit*ri*, and thus pleased
with him, he (Savit*ri*) impels (speeds) those (sacrificial) men, and he
seizes them impelled by that (Savit*ri*).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:10">13:6:2:10</span></span>10.
For the priesthood he seizes a Brâhma*n*a, for the Brâhma*n*a is the
priesthood: he thus joins priesthood to priesthood <span
id="fr_1070"></span>[2](#fn_1064);--for the nobility he seizes a
Râ*g*anya, for the Râ*g*anya is the nobility: he thus joins nobility to
nobility;--for the Maruts (he seizes) a Vai*s*ya, for the Maruts are the
clans (peasants): he thus joins peasantry to peasantry;--

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

for (religious) toil (he seizes) a *S*ûdra, for the *S*ûdra is toil: he
thus joins toil to toil;--according to their particular form he thus
supplies these divinities with victims, and, thus supplied, they supply
him with all his objects of desire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:11">13:6:2:11</span></span>11.
He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery
mettle he thus endows him (the Sacrificer) with fiery mettle. He makes
offering with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the dear resource of the
gods: he thus supplies them with their dear resource, and, thus
supplied, they supply him with all his objects of desire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:12">13:6:2:12</span></span>12.
By means of the Purusha Nârâya*n*a (litany), the Brahman priest (seated)
to the right (south) of them, praises the men bound (to the stakes) with
this sixteen-versed (hymn, *Ri*g-v. X, 90, Vâ*g*. S. XXXI, 1-16), 'The
thousand-headed Purusha, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed <span
id="fr_1071"></span>[1](#fn_1065) . . .;'--thus (he does) for the
obtainment and the securing of everything, for everything here consists
of sixteen parts, and the Purushamedha is everything: in thus saying,
'So and so thou art, so and so thou art,' he praises and thereby indeed
magnifies him (Purusha); but he also thereby speaks of him, such as he
is. Now, the victims had had the fire carried round them, but they were
not yet slaughtered,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:13">13:6:2:13</span></span>13.
Then a voice <span id="fr_1072"></span>[2](#fn_1066) said to him,
'Purusha, do not

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

consummate (these human victims <span
id="fr_1073"></span>[1](#fn_1067)): if thou wert to consummate them, man
(purusha) would eat man.' Accordingly, as soon as fire had been carried
round them, he set them free, and offered oblations to the same
divinities <span id="fr_1074"></span>[2](#fn_1068), and thereby
gratified those divinities, and, thus gratified, they, gratified him
with all objects of desire.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:14">13:6:2:14</span></span>14.
He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: with fiery mettle
he thus bestows fiery mettle upon him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:15">13:6:2:15</span></span>15.
He concludes with those of the set of eleven (stakes),--the Trish*t*ubh
consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh is the thunderbolt,
and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus
repels evil from within.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:16">13:6:2:16</span></span>16.
The Udayanîyâ (concluding oblation) having been completed, he seizes
eleven barren cows, sacred to Mitra-Varu*n*a, the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, and
B*ri*haspati <span id="fr_1075"></span>[3](#fn_1069), with the view of
winning these deities. And as to those of B*ri*haspati being
last,--B*ri*haspati truly is the Brahman (n.), and thus he finally
establishes himself in the Brahman.

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:17">13:6:2:17</span></span>17.
And as to why there are eleven of them,--the Trish*t*ubh consists of
eleven syllables, and the Trish*t*ubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour:
with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from
within. The Traidhâtavî is the final offering (Udavasânîyâ): the mystic
import is the same (as before <span id="fr_1076"></span>[1](#fn_1070)).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:18">13:6:2:18</span></span>18.
Now as to the sacrificial fees. What there is towards the middle of the
kingdom other than the land and the property of the Brâhma*n*a, but
including the men, of that the eastern quarter belongs to the Hot*ri*,
the southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the
northern to the Udgât*ri*; and the Hot*ri*kas share this along with
them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:19">13:6:2:19</span></span>19.
And if a Brâhma*n*a performs the sacrifice, he should bestow all his
property in order to obtain and secure everything, for the Brâhma*n*a is
everything, and all one's property is everything, and the Purushamedha
is everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:6:2:20">13:6:2:20</span></span>20.
And having taken up the two fires within his own self <span
id="fr_1077"></span>[2](#fn_1071), and worshipped the sun with the
Uttara-Nârâya*n*a (litany, viz. Vâ*g*. S. XXXI, 17-22), let him betake
himself to the forest without looking round; and that (place), indeed,
is apart from men. But should he wish to live in the village, let him
take up again the two fires in the churning-sticks, and having
worshipped the sun with the Uttara-Nârâya*n*a (litany) let him dwell at
his home, and let him offer such sacrifices as he may

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

be able to afford. But, indeed, this (sacrifice) is not to be imparted
to any and every one, lest one should impart everything to any and every
one, for the Purushamedha is everything; but one may only impart it to
one who is known to him, and who is versed in sacred writ, and who may
be dear to him, but not to any and every one.

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[407:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1065) That is, he
(symbolically) immolates them.

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[407:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1066) The statement in
[paragraphs 3](sbe44111.htm#13:6:2:3) and [4](sbe44111.htm#13:6:2:4),
according to which there are eleven decades of human victims, does not
refer to the actual distribution of victims over the eleven stakes, but
it is apparently made purely for symbolical reasons (viz. with reference
to the Virâ*g* and Trish*t*ubh metres), and is probably based on the way
in which the victims are enumerated in the Vâ*g*asaneyi-sa*m*hitâ, XXX,
5-22 (see the Translation at the end of this chapter, where they are,
however, numbered according to the stakes). There the first eleven
Ka*nd*ikâs (5-15) are made up of the names and deities of ten victims
each, hence together of eleven decades; whilst of the subsequent
Ka*nd*ikâs--k. 16 consists of twelve, ks. 17-22 of ten each, and k. 22
of twelve victims. The actual mode of distribution over the several
stakes is that referred to in paragraphs 5-8, viz. the first forty-eight
victims are tied to the central stake, after which eleven victims are
tied to each of the other ten stakes. After these, amounting to 258
victims, the Sa*m*hitâ <span id="page_408">p. 408</span> enumerates
twenty-six additional victims, which, according to Mahîdhara (cf. Kâty.
XXI, 1, so), are to be added to the eleven victims of the second
stake,--viz. fourteen victims dedicated to various so-called deities;
eight victims, sacred to Pra*g*âpati and belonging neither to the
*S*ûdra nor to the Brâhma*n*a castes; and finally four more victims,
characterised in exactly the same way as the eight preceding ones. It
will be seen that of these twenty-six victims only the first set of
(eight) Prâ*g*âpatya victims are referred to in the Brâhma*n*a, and that
as the victims seized last of all. This circumstance clearly
characterises the last four victims of the Sa*m*hitâ as not recognised
by the Brâhma*n*a; and seeing that all four of these are such as have
already occurred amongst the previously enumerated victims (though there
assigned to different divinities) they must be considered (as they are
by Prof. Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 68) as having been added to the
list of the Sa*m*hitâ subsequently to the composition of the Brâhma*n*a.
A similar inference will probably apply to the fourteen victims
preceding the eight Prâ*g*âpatya ones, though all that can be urged
against them is that they are not referred to in the Brâhma*n*a.

food is virâ*g* (widely ruling or shining). In double clauses with a
middle term, such as this, the position of subject and predicate seems
often reversed in the second clause (cf. for instance, [XIII, 8, 1,
4](sbe44113.htm#13:8:1:4)),

divine spirit, the world-soul, of which Pra*g*âpati is, as it were, the
personification, or phenomenal representative.

<span id="fn_1064"></span>[409:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1070) Or, he perfects,
completes, the priesthood by (adding to it a member of) the priesthood.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[410:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1071) For a complete
translation of this hymn, the Purusha-sûkta, see J. Muir, Orig. Sanskrit
Texts, vol. i, p. 9 seqq. Cp. also part iv, introduction, p. xiv.

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[410:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1072) 'A bodiless
voice,' comm.; cf. XI, 4, 2, 16 where likewise 'an invisible voice' is
introduced censuring the priest who burns the oblations. Perhaps,
however, Vâ*k* may be intended from whom Pra*g*âpati, in the beginning,
produced the waters; cf. VI, 1, 1, 9.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[411:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1073) Thus (i.e. do
not go through with this human sacrifice) the commentator, probably
correctly, interprets 'sa*m*sthâpaya' (instead of 'do not kill,' St.
Petersb. Dict., though, practically, it would, of course, come to the
same thing),--Purusha, etân purushapa*s*ûn mâ sa*m*tish*t*ipa*h*,
udaṅnayâdikâny aṅgâny eshâ*m* mâ k*ri*thâ ityartha*h*; yadi
sa*m*sthâpayishyasi tata*h* *s*eshabhakshânukâre*n*a loke<sup>ऽ</sup>pi
purusha*h* purusham bhakshayishyati ta*k* *k*âyuktam ity abhiprâya*h*.
In the same way the verse ought accordingly to have been translated in
III, 7, 2, 8.

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[411:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1074) That is, he
offers with the formulas 'To the Brahman, hail! to the Kshatra, hail!'
&c., running through the whole series of so-called divinities of the
released victims.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[411:3](sbe44111.htm#fr_1075) Viz. three for
each of the first two deities, and five for B*ri*haspati.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[412:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1076) Viz. as set
forth V, 5, 5, 6 seqq.

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[412:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1077) Viz. by thrice
inhaling the heat (or smoke) emitted by the fires, Cf. Mânava-Dh. VI,
38; Baudhâyana-Dharmas. II, 17, 26.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[413:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1078) Comp. Prof.
Weber's German translation (Zeitschr. D. M. G., XVIII, p. 262 seqq.;
Indische Streifen, I, p. 76 seqq.), where the variants from the Taitt.
Br. and the explanations of the commentaries are given. Not a few of the
terms used (some of which are, indeed, explained in a different way by
the commentators) are, however, still of doubtful meaning. Vâ*g*. S.
XXX, 5-22.

<span id="fn_1073"></span>[413:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1079) ? The
patronymic, or matronymic, of this, 'âyobhava' is said to be the son of
a *S*ûdra from a Vai*s*ya woman.

<span id="fn_1074"></span>[413:3](sbe44111.htm#fr_1080) Or, as Mahîdhara
takes 'subhe vapam,' to well-being the seed-sower--einen Sämann dein
Gedeihen, Weber.

<span id="fn_1075"></span>[414:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1081) One of the wild
aboriginal tribesmen.

<span id="fn_1076"></span>[414:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1082) ? îryatâ, lit.
the state of one requiring to be roused.

<span id="fn_1077"></span>[414:3](sbe44111.htm#fr_1083) ? 'envy' St.
Petersb. Dict. (arâddhi),

<span id="fn_1078"></span>[414:4](sbe44111.htm#fr_1084) The meaning of
'utsâda' is doubtful; it might be 'removal,' only the etymological
meaning of 'ut-sad' having probably suggested the combination.

<span id="fn_1079"></span>[414:5](sbe44111.htm#fr_1085) Mahîdhara takes
'srâma' in the sense of one affected with ophthalmia (cf. srâva): in
both senses the association of ideas is intelligible, though apparently
(as in other cases) of a jocular nature.

<span id="fn_1080"></span>[414:6](sbe44111.htm#fr_1086) Or, the
assistant of a charioteer, according to Mah. and Sây. (cf. V, 3).

<span id="fn_1081"></span>[415:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1087) Mahîdhara takes
'prakarit*ri*' in the sense of 'vikshept*ri*'; Sây. in that of 'sower of
discord.'

<span id="fn_1082"></span>[415:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1088) ? Sây. makes
'upasekt*ri*' a composer of feuds (!).

<span id="fn_1083"></span>[415:3](sbe44111.htm#fr_1089) ? 'a stirrer up
of discord,' Sây.

<span id="fn_1084"></span>[415:4](sbe44111.htm#fr_1090) Thus also
Mahîdhara; charioteer, Sây.; cf. III, 11.

<span id="fn_1085"></span>[415:5](sbe44111.htm#fr_1091) Yamî, Taitt. Br.

<span id="fn_1086"></span>[415:6](sbe44111.htm#fr_1092) According to
Mahîdhara, a wild tribesman (inhabitant of the jungle); 'one living by
the net,' Sây.

<span id="fn_1087"></span>[416:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1093) 'The son of a
m*ri*gâri (? huntsman),' Mahîdhara; 'one who catches fish with his
hands,' Sây.

<span id="fn_1088"></span>[416:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1094) According to
Mahîdhara, the maker of 'bandhanâni (? strings, or dams);'--according to
Sây., one who catches fish by means of dikes.

<span id="fn_1089"></span>[416:3](sbe44111.htm#fr_1095) ? A Bhilla
(Bheel, mountaineer, woodman);--one catching fish by means of feathers
(par*n*a), Sây.

<span id="fn_1090"></span>[416:4](sbe44111.htm#fr_1096) Apparently a man
of a voracious, flesh-eating tribe.

<span id="fn_1091"></span>[416:5](sbe44111.htm#fr_1097) Apparently a
low, despicable man.

<span id="fn_1092"></span>[416:6](sbe44111.htm#fr_1098) Explained as one
of very low birth, or more particularly, as the son of a Nishâda from a
Kshatriya woman.

<span id="fn_1093"></span>[416:7](sbe44111.htm#fr_1099) Lit. a cutter
away (? a spendthrift).

<span id="fn_1094"></span>[416:8](sbe44111.htm#fr_1100) Thus Mahîdhara
explains 'âdinavadar*s*a'; 'one who works for his fellow-player's ruin,'
St. Petersb. Dict.

<span id="fn_1095"></span>[416:9](sbe44111.htm#fr_1102) The terms
'kalpin' and 'adhikalpin' are of doubtful meaning--'arranger' and
'head-arranger,' Weber.

<span id="fn_1096"></span>[416:10](sbe44111.htm#fr_1103) Lit. 'the
assailer,' apparently another name for the die usually called Kali. On
these dice see part iii, p. 106, note 1.

<span id="fn_1097"></span>[416:11](sbe44111.htm#fr_1104) Explained as a
jocular expression for the habitual frequenter of the gambling-house.

<span id="fn_1098"></span>[417:1](sbe44111.htm#fr_1105) St. Petersb.
Dict. conjectures 'To lust a sportive woman (? dancer or singer).'

<span id="fn_1099"></span>[417:2](sbe44111.htm#fr_1106) 'Va*ms*anartin'
explained by Mahîdhara as one who practises dancing by means of a
bamboo-staff (va*ms*ena nartana*s*îla); by Sây. as one who makes his
living by dancing on the top of a bamboo-staff
(va*ms*âgran*ri*tta*g*îvin); hardly a 'family-dancer,' Monier-Williams.
