<p>he supplies and completes it;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship:--for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!'--the import of this is the same as before.</p>

XXXVII, 5), 'Only thus large was she in the beginning,'--for, indeed, only so large was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called Em&ucirc;sha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: with that mate, his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1199"></A><A HREF="#fn_1191"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.</p>

He said, 'Verily, after bursting open (&acirc;-dar), as it were, this vital sap has sung praises:' thence &Acirc;d&acirc;ra (-plants originated); and because he lay there stinking (p&ucirc;y), as it were, therefore (they are also called) P&ucirc;t&icirc;ka; and hence, when placed on the fire</p>

<p><A NAME="page_452"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 452</FONT></A></p>  
<p>as an offering, they blaze; and hence also they are fragrant, for they originated from the vital sap of the sacrifice. And inasmuch as Indra, on that occasion, encompassed him with might, therefore he says, 'Indra's might ye are;'--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:2:13">14:1:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. Then goat's milk;---for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its heat went out of it, wherefrom the goat was produced: it is with that heat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1201"></A><A HREF="#fn_1193"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that he thereby supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.</p>

These, then, are the five equipments with which he equips (the Pravargya),--fivefold is the sacrifice, and fivefold the victims, and five seasons are in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies. These (objects), thus brought together, he touches with, 'For Makha (I consecrate) thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:2:15">14:1:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. Now there is an enclosed space&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1202"></A><A HREF="#fn_1194"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on the north</p>

<p>side: whilst proceeding towards that (shed) they mutter (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXVII, 7; Rig-v. I, 40, 3), 'May Brahma<I>n</I>aspati go forward!'--Brahma<I>n</I>aspati (the lord of devotion) doubtless is he that shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus gratifies; hence he says, 'May Brahma<I>n</I>aspati go forward;'--'may the goddess Gladness go forward!'--for the goddess Gladness she (V&acirc;<I>k</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1203"></A><A HREF="#fn_1195"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) is;--'unto the hero&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1204"></A><A HREF="#fn_1196"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, kindly to men and the dispenser of fivefold (offerings),'--he thereby praises and magnifies it (the Pravargya),--'unto the sacrifice may the gods lead us!'--he thereby makes all the gods its guardians.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:2:16">14:1:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. It is an enclosed space;--for at that time the gods were afraid, thinking, 'We hope that the fiends, the Rakshas, will not injure here this our (Pravargya):' they accordingly enclosed for it this stronghold, and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now enclose for it this stronghold.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:2:17">14:1:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. He then deposits (the sambh&acirc;ras&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1205"></A><A HREF="#fn_1197"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>) on the mound with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.

<p>the same as before;--a span high&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1206"></A><A HREF="#fn_1198"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for the head is, as it were, a span high;--contracted in the middle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1207"></A><A HREF="#fn_1199"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for the head is, as it were, contracted in the middle. At the top he then draws it out (so as to form) a spout&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1208"></A><A HREF="#fn_1200"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of three thumbs&#8217; breadths (high): he thereby makes a nose to this (Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra, or Pravargya). When it is complete, he touches it with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXVII, 8), 'Makha's head thou art,'--for it indeed is the head of Makha Saumya (the Soma-sacrifice). In the same way (he makes) the other two (Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra pots&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1209"></A><A HREF="#fn_1201"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>); silently two milking-bowls (pinvana&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1210"></A><A HREF="#fn_1202"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>), and silently two Rauhi<I>n</I>a-plates&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1211"></A><A HREF="#fn_1203"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>.</p>

Whatever one does with a Ya<I>g</I>us formula, by that one makes up that form of him (Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati) which is defined and limited; and whatever one does silently, by that one makes up that form of him which is undefined and unlimited: verily, then, whosoever, knowing this, does it on this wise, makes up that whole and complete Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. But he also leaves over a lump of spare (clay) for expiations.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:2:19">14:1:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. He then smooths&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1213"></A><A HREF="#fn_1205"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> it by means of Gavedhuk&acirc; grass (Coix barbata),--for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed away, and therefrom those plants grew up: with that vital sap he thus supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before, In the same way the other two (Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhi<I>n</I>a-plates.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:2:20">14:1:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. He then fumigates these (vessels) with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXVII, 9), 'With dung of the stallion, the impregnator, I fumigate thee,'--for the</p>

<p>stallion is an impregnator, and the impregnator means vigour: with vigour he thus supplies and completes it,--'on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way (he fumigates) the other two (Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhi<I>n</I>a-plates.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:2:21">14:1:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. He then bakes them, for what is baked belongs to the gods. He bakes them by means of bricks, for they it was that did so on that occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1214"></A><A HREF="#fn_1206"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: just in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (bricks), But, indeed, let him bake them with anything&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1215"></A><A HREF="#fn_1207"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> whereby they may become properly baked. Having laid down the fuel for baking&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1216"></A><A HREF="#fn_1208"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he puts down the Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra (pot), with, 'For Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before. In the same way the other two Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra (pots); silently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhi<I>n</I>a-plates. By day he should bury them (in the hole), and by day he should take them out, for the day belongs to the gods.</p>

XXXVII, 10), 'For the righteous one (I take) thee,'--the righteous one, doubtless, is yonder world, for the righteous one means truth; and he that shines yonder is the truth, and the first Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the righteous one (I take) thee.'</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1184"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1192">448:3</A> See VI, 6, 3, 2 seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1185"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1193">449:1</A> See I, 1, 2, 17; VI, 3, 1, 38 seq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1186"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1194">449:2</A> See III, 5, 3, 11-12.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1187"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1195">449:3</A> Between the two actions referred to in <a href="sbe44118.htm#14:1:2:8">paragraphs 8</A> and <a href="sbe44118.htm#14:1:2:9">9</A>, the digging up of the clay takes place, and hence the spade, or trowel, has changed hands. Cf. VI, 4, 2, 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1188"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1196">450:1</A> The pronouns in this and the subsequent corresponding formulas (v&acirc;<I>m</I>, va<I>h</I>, te) are taken by Mah&icirc;dhara as accusatives ('te' according to him standing for 'tv&acirc;m') to which he supplies '&acirc;d&acirc;ya'--'having taken you, may I this day compass Makha's head.' The pronouns are certainly somewhat awkward, as they can scarcely be taken as genitives of material--of you, of thee.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1189"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1197">450:2</A> See VI, 3, 3, 5, where 'valm&icirc;kavap&acirc;' is qualified by 'sushir&acirc;,' hollow. The comm. on K&acirc;ty. XXVI, 1, 2 explains 'valm&icirc;kavap&acirc;' as the vap&acirc; (omentum)-like inner lump (? surrounded by a kind of net) of an ant-hill: in the present case, this substance is likewise placed on the black antelope-skin to be mixed with the clay.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1190"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1198">450:3</A> Whilst in the text of the formula this word must be taken as being plural 'prathama<I>g</I>&acirc;<I>h</I>,' the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (making use of the Sandhi-form) treats it as if it were singular 'prathama<I>g</I>&acirc;.' Mah&icirc;dhara also, apparently influenced by the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, explains, 'the earth is the firstborn of creatures, and, from their connection with it, ants also are called firstborn.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1191"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1199">451:1</A> That is, he supplies Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (and hence also his counterpart, the Sacrificer) with the Earth, his mate. See J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. i, p. 53; vol. iv, p. 27; and cp. Taitt. I, 10, 8, where the earth is said to have been uplifted by a black boar with a thousand arms.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1192"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1200">451:2</A> At IV, 5, 10, 4 we met with this plant--here also called P&ucirc;t&icirc;ka, and explained, by the comm. on K&acirc;ty., as = the flowers (!) of the Rohisha plant (? Guilandina, or Caesalpinia, Bonducella)--as a substitute for Soma-plants.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1193"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1201">452:1</A> Thus perhaps '<I>s</I>u<I>k</I>' should also have been rendered at VI, 4, 4, 7, where it is used in connection with the ass.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1194"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1202">452:2</A> Viz. a space five cubits square enclosed with mats on all sides, and with a door on the east side, the ground being raised in the middle so as to form a mound covered with sand (cf. III, 1, 2, 2). The object of this enclosed space is to prevent any unauthorised person (such as the Sacrificer's wife, and people uninstructed in the scriptures) from seeing the manufacturing of the Mah&icirc;v&icirc;ra (during which the door is kept closed), as well as the completed pot. <A NAME="page_453"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 453</FONT></A> The place is to the north of the anta<I>h</I>p&acirc;tya peg, the black antelope-skin being spread to the south of it (and immediately north of the materials used in making the pot).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1195"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1203">453:1</A> Thus Mah&icirc;dhara, on V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXIII, 89.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1196"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1204">453:2</A> 'V&icirc;ra,' apparently an allusion to 'Mah&acirc;-vira' (great hero), the name of the pot used at the Pravargya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1197"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1205">453:3</A> Viz. as placed on the black antelope-skin which is carried northwards to the enclosed place by the Adhvaryu and his assistants taking hold of it on all sides.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1198"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1206">454:1</A> That is, from bottom to top, a belt (mekhal&acirc;) running round it at the distance of three thumbs' breadths from the top (Mah&icirc;dhara, and comm. on Katy.). This top part above the belt--here simply called 'mouth,' whilst in the &Acirc;past. <I>S</I>r. XV, 2, 14 it is called 'back' (s&acirc;nu)--ends in a hole for pouring the liquid in and out.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1199"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1207">454:2</A> That is, for taking hold of it (mush<I>t</I>igraha<I>n</I>ayogyam, comm. on Katy.).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1200"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1208">454:3</A> 'Mukha,' for which Katy. XXVI, 1, 16 has '&acirc;se<I>k</I>ana' explained by the commentator as a hole (garta; comm. on &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. G<I>ri</I>hyas. IV, 3 bila), apparently serving as the mouth, or open part of the vessel which seems to be otherwise closed. The edge of the hole would seem to protract sufficiently from the surface to suggest a similarity to the nose. In making the vessel, it seems first to be left solid, the open part which is to hold the milk being then hollowed out by means of a reed from the top hole to the depth of less than the upper half, the remainder remaining solid. Cf. &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. XV, 3, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1201"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1209">454:4</A> Only the first of the three pots is, however, actually used; unless it gets broken by accident.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1202"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1210">454:5</A> According to the comm. on Katy. Sr., these vessels are of the form of the (hand-shaped) bowl of an offering-ladle (sru<I>k</I>, cf. part i, p. 67, note 2).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1203"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1211">454:6</A> The Rauhi<I>n</I>a-kap&acirc;las are two round, flat dishes for baking the Rauhi<I>n</I>a cakes on.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1204"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1212">455:1</A> Cf. J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. v, p. 393, where a passage is quoted from Prof. Cowell's translation of the Maitri-Upanishad (VI, 3), 'There are two forms of Brahma, the embodied (m&ucirc;rta) and the unembodied (am&ucirc;rta): the former is unreal (asatya), the latter real (satya).'--Cf. Sat. Br. VI, 5, 3, 7.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1205"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1213">455:2</A> The S&ucirc;tras use the verbs '<I>s</I>laksh<I>n</I>ayati, <I>s</I>laksh<I>n</I>&icirc;kurvanti' (to make smooth, or soft), and this, I think, must indeed be the meaning of 'hinv.' It would also suit very well the passage III, 5, 1, 35, where it is said that the Vedi is a woman, and that, by sprinkling the former with water, one 'makes her smooth' for the gods. The polishing of the vessels is done by rubbing them with Gavedhuk&acirc; grass, whether with the spike, stem, or leaves is not specified.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1206"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1214">456:1</A> That is, when the Ukh&acirc; was baked, cf. VI, 5, 4, 1; or, perhaps,--they it was that (the gods) made at this juncture. The former translation is more in accordance with what follows, though one would expect 'etad' to mean 'at this time.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1207"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1215">456:2</A> That is, without using bricks (?).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1208"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1216">456:3</A> Viz. in a square hole dug for the purpose east of the G&acirc;rhapatya; the pot being then placed bottom upwards on the burning material, dry herbs, wood, &amp;c. According to &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. XV, 3, 20 such materials are to be used as, whilst being burnt, dye red.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1209"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1217">457:1</A> The accusative with 'kshi' (to inhabit) is rather peculiar here.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1210"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1218">457:2</A> As the pots are, however, standing with their open parts upwards, on sand north of the hole in which they were baked, it would chiefly be inside that they would receive the milk, being thereby cooled (cf. VI, 5, 4, 15). According to &Acirc;pastamba, sand is in the first place heaped up around them in the sunwise fashion, i.e. keeping them on the right side whilst strewing it.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1211"></A><A HREF="sbe44118.htm#fr_1219">458:1</A> That is to say, as would seem,--even as, in creating the universe, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati reconstructs his body, or constructs himself a new body, so the Sacrificer, in keeping up the observance of the Pravargya, constructs himself a new body for the future life.</P>
