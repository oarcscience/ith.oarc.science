Then the Adhvaryu takes the (lustral) sprinkling water, and, stepping up, says, 'Brahman, we shall proceed: Hot<I>ri</I>, sing praises!' for the Brahman is seated on the right (south) side as the guardian of the sacrifice: to him he thus says, 'Sit thou undistracted: we are about to restore the head of the Sacrifice;' and 'Hot<I>ri</I>, sing praises!' he says, because the Hot<I>ri</I> is the sacrifice: he thus thereby says to him, 'Restore the head of the sacrifice!' and accordingly the Hot<I>ri</I> begins to recite--</p>

Having turned round the Emperor's throne-seat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1228"></A><A HREF="#fn_1220"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in front of the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, he places it south thereof, and north of the King's (Soma's) throne-seat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1229"></A><A HREF="#fn_1221"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, so as to face the east.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:3:12">14:1:3:12</A></FONT></span>12 And as to why he places it north (of Soma's seat),--Soma is the sacrifice, and the Pravargya is its head; but the head is higher (uttara): therefore he places it north (uttara) of it. Moreover, Soma is king, and the Pravargya is emperor, and the imperial dignity is higher than the royal: therefore he places it north of it&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1231"></A><A HREF="#fn_1223"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from below; and that, to wit, gold, being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Earth also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1235"></A><A HREF="#fn_1227"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>, might injure</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:3:15">14:1:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. And when the Hot<I>ri</I> recites this (verse, Rig-v. I, 36, 9), 'Sit thee down: thou art great . . .,' sheaths of reed-grass are kindled on both sides&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1237"></A><A HREF="#fn_1229"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and throwing them (on the mound), he puts (the Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra pot) thereon. When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and therefrom these plants grew up: with that life-sap he thus supplies and completes it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:3:16">14:1:3:16</A></FONT></span>16. And as to why they are kindled on both sides: he thereby repels the Rakshas, the fiends, from all the quarters. Whilst this (pot) is being heated, the (Sacrificer's) wife covers her head, thinking, 'Lest this one, when heated and glowing, should rob me of my eyesight,' for it indeed becomes heated and glowing.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:3:17">14:1:3:17</A></FONT></span>17. He puts it on with, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art;'--for the Gharma is he who shines yonder, and he indeed is all that: it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says, 'Flame thou art, glow thou art, heat thou art.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:3:18">14:1:3:18</A></FONT></span>18. He (the Sacrificer) then invokes blessings on this (earth)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1238"></A><A HREF="#fn_1230"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for the sacrifice is this (earth): it is thus (whilst being) on her that he invokes blessings, and she fulfils them all for him.</p>

On the right (south) side (of the Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra) he (the Sacrificer) then makes amends by (laying down) the hand with the palm upwards, with, 'Shield me from all evil spirits!' whereby he means to say, 'Protect me from all troubles!' When the sacrifice had its head cut off, its life-sap flowed away, and went to the Fathers, but the Fathers are three in number&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1241"></A><A HREF="#fn_1233"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: it is with these that he thus supplies and completes it (the Pravargya).</p>

He then places a gold plate (weighing a hundred grains) on the top (of the pot), with, 'Protect it from contact with the sky!' For at that time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs from above; and that--to wit, gold--being Agni's seed, it (serves) for repelling the fiends, the Rakshas. But, indeed, the Sky also was afraid of this lest this (Pravargya), when heated and glowing, might injure it: he thus keeps it separate therefrom.

Three (fans) there are, for there are three breathings, the out (and in)-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing: it is these he thus lays into it.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:1:3:31">14:1:3:31</A></FONT></span>31.

<p>fan again thrice in the sunwise way,--this makes six; and six in number are these breathings (vital airs) in the head: it is these he thus lays into it. They cook the two Rauhi<I>n</I>a (cakes). When a blaze is produced, he takes off the gold (plate).</p>

If it be aglow, he may know that the Sacrificer will become more prosperous; and if it be not aglow, he may know that he will become poorer; and if it be neither aglow nor the reverse, he may know that he (the Sacrificer) will become neither more prosperous nor poorer: but indeed (the pot) should be fanned so (long) as to be aglow.</p>

Br., Transl., p. 51, they are placed underneath the pot in lifting it, but this seems very improbable, seeing that, at the end of the sacrifice, the Adhvaryu, by means of them, turns the pot upside down so as to pour the remainder of its contents into the offering spoon (see K&acirc;ty. XXIV, 6, 17 with comm.); nor could the blackened pot in that way be cleansed properly and placed on the supporting tray (<a href="sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:16">XIV, 2, 1, 16</A>-<a href="sbe44121.htm#14:2:1:17">17</A>).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1224"></A><A HREF="sbe44119.htm#fr_1232">462:1</A> Katy. XXVI, 2, 4 refers to the pot as 'containing ghee (&acirc;<I>g</I>yavant),' which the comm. takes to mean 'filled with consecrated ghee;' whilst &Acirc;past. XV, 7, 5 leaves the option between greasing it (a<I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>) and filling it (abhip&ucirc;r) with ghee. It would doubtless, at all events, be abundantly greased inside.</P>

The masculine form of the participle is somewhat peculiar as the term it is meant to explain refers to the earth. It has probably to be understood in the sense of, 'where he (viz. the Adhvaryu) calls for the <I>s</I>rausha<I>t</I>.' Mah&icirc;dhara explains the term '&acirc;<I>s</I>ruti' by 'where they, the priests, utter the sacrificial calls,' i.e. 'meet for sacrifice.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1232"></A><A HREF="sbe44119.htm#fr_1240">465:1</A> Here the masculine gender can hardly be understood otherwise than in the sense 'where (B<I>ri</I>haspati, or Brahman) disposes on high.' Mah&icirc;dhara takes no notice of this interpretation of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, but explains 'vidh<I>ri</I>ti' as either 'one who upholds (dh&acirc;rayati) in an especial manner,' or where 'the offering spoon, &amp;c., is held upwards (uparish<I>t</I>&acirc;d dhriyate,--? who holds it upwards),'--an explanation which can hardly commend itself.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1233"></A><A HREF="sbe44119.htm#fr_1241">465:2</A> This specification of the number seems to have no other object but that of limiting the general term of 'Fathers,' or deceased ancestors, to the specific signification it has at the <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha, where offering is made to the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1234"></A><A HREF="sbe44119.htm#fr_1242">465:3</A> According to Katy. XXVI, 3, 8, he does so whilst spanning the earth north of the Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra pot.</P>

According to K&acirc;ty., on the other hand, the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> proceeds with the baking of the cakes, whilst the Adhvaryu sprinkles the pot with ghee each time that the Hot<I>ri</I>, in his recitation, utters the syllable 'om' at the end of a verse.
