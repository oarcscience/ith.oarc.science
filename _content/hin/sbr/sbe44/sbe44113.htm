The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from the regions, and, being regionless, they were overcome.

He makes it on ground inclining towards the north, for the north is the region of men: he thus gives him (the deceased) a share in the world of men; and in that respect, indeed, the Fathers share in the world of men that they have offspring; and his (the deceased man's) offspring will, indeed, be more prosperous.</p>

'Let him make it on ground inclining towards the south,' they say, 'for the world of the Fathers inclines towards the south: he thus gives him a share in the world of the Fathers.'

For an Agni<I>k</I>it (builder of a fire-altar) one makes the tomb after the manner of the fire-altar; for when a Sacrificer builds a fire-altar he thereby constructs for himself by sacrifice a (new) body for yonder world; but that sacrificial performance is not complete until the making of a tomb; and when he makes the tomb of the Agni<I>k</I>it after the manner of the fire-altar, it is thereby he completes the Agni<I>k</I>ity&acirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:1:18">13:8:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. One must not make it (too) large lest he should make the sin (of the deceased) large. 'Let him make it as large as the fire-altar without wings and tail,' say some, 'for like that of the fire-altar is this his (the Sacrificer's) body.'</p>

Having attended to this, he encloses it with cords twisted (and extended) in the non-sunwise way&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1144"></A><A HREF="#fn_1137"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for the (sacrificial) performance connected with the Fathers is done in the non-sunwise way.</p>

He should cut it out to whatever extent he intends to raise (the sepulchral mound), but let him rather cut it out so as to be just of man's size: he thus leaves no room for another. For, on the one hand&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1145"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Fathers are the world of plants, and amongst the roots of plants they (are wont to) hide; and, on the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1146"></A><A HREF="#fn_1138"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, (he does so) lest he (the deceased) should be separated from this (earth).</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1111"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1118">421:2</A> The commentator is at pains to show that 'atha' here has not the force of 'thereupon'--that is after the performance of the Sarvamedha--but that of introducing a new topic ('Now, they do . . .'); and that therefore the directions about to be given are by no means intended to apply only to one who has performed the Sarvamedha, or even to the Agni<I>k</I>it, or builder of a fire-altar, but also to others.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1112"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1119">421:3</A> Y&acirc;ska (Nir. III, 5) resolves this word into '<I>s</I>man' (body) + '<I>s</I>ayana' (couch); whilst Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud.

Sr. XXI, 3, 1 (pit<I>ri</I>mdha<I>h</I> sa<I>m</I>vatsar&acirc;sm<I>ri</I>tau), instead of 'when they do not remember it (even once) for years, he brings it about that the sin is forgotten, even in case they should remember it,' as Prof. Delbr&uuml;ck, Altind. Syntax, p. 351 translates the passage. For the subject of the verb 'they remember it,' Prof. Delbr&uuml;ck supplies 'pitara<I>h</I>,' i.e. the dead man's deceased ancestors, instead of the living people, which seems rather improbable. The comment is very corrupt, but it makes at least some allusion to 'people's talk':--na <I>s</I>ruti<I>h</I> <I>s</I>rutyabh&acirc;vas (ta<I>m</I>) tena <I>k</I>irakara<I>n</I>ena agha<I>m</I> p&acirc;pakara<I>n</I>a<I>m</I> gamayati, <I>k</I>ir&acirc;t <I>s</I>ma<I>s</I>&acirc;na<I>m</I> kurva<I>s</I>rara<I>n</I>a<I>m</I> (? kurvata<I>h</I> <I>s</I>rava<I>n</I>a<I>m</I>) <I>g</I>anav&acirc;do<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>pi na <I>s</I><I>ri</I><I>n</I>ot&icirc;ty (!) artha<I>h</I>.</P>

XXI, 3, 2, construes the clause with the next paragraph, and it is difficult to see how otherwise any satisfactory sense could be extracted from it.

As regards the symbolic connection of the uneven number with the deceased ancestors, the commentator reminds us of the fact that it is the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather who represent the Fathers.--The only available MS. of the commentary (Ind.

<P><A NAME="fn_1126"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1133">426:1</A> That is, it should be in a place where at midday the rays of the sun do not fall obliquely on it, K&acirc;ty. XXI, 3, 15 comm.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1127"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1134">426:2</A> That is, from the village, cf. K&acirc;ty. XXI, 3, 18.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1128"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1135">426:3</A> Or, beautiful ground (<I>k</I>itra). According to the comments on K&acirc;ty. XXI, 3, 23 this means that the site of the grave should be so chosen that there are at the back (or west) of it, either woods of various kinds, or ground diversified by woods, hills, temples (!) &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1129"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1136">427:1</A> Whilst their share would have been excessive, if all the ground covered with vegetation were assigned to them. It is also worthy of note that K&acirc;ty. Sr. XXV, 7, 17, in enumerating the plants which are to be removed from the site of the funeral pile, mentions (apparently in the place of our Bh&ucirc;mip&acirc;<I>s</I>&acirc;) the Vi<I>s</I>&acirc;kha, explained by the commentator as identical with 'd&ucirc;rv&acirc;'; and Sir H. M. Elliott, Races of the N. W. Province of India, II, p. 303, remarks, on the D&ucirc;b grass (Agrestis linearis, or Cynodon dactylon), that 'its tenacity whenever it once fixes its roots has caused it to be used in a common simile when the attachment of Zami&#7749;d&acirc;rs to their native soil is spoken of.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1130"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1137">427:2</A> Apparently lit. 'binding (itself),'? i.e. either restricted in quantity, or limited to his own person, not transmitted to his son. Cf. XIII, 8, 3, 10. It can hardly be taken in the sense of 'binding the sin.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1131"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1138">427:3</A> Literally, 'Earth-net,' apparently some troublesome creeping plant corresponding to our rest-harrow (Ononis arvensis or spinosa), or couch-grass (Triticum repens), but of tropical dimensions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1132"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1139">427:4</A> Lit. 'rock-smell,' perhaps identical with A<I>s</I>vagandh&acirc; (lit. 'horse-smell,' Physalis flexuosa).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1133"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1140">428:1</A> The commentator, on K&acirc;ty. XXI, 3, 20, and V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 1, instances the <I>s</I>leshm&acirc;ntaka ('antiphlegmatic,' i.e. Cordia latifolia or myxa) and the kovid&acirc;ra ('bad for splitting,' Bauhinia variegata; which, according to Stewart and Brandis, shows vertical cracks in the bark).</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1134"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1141">428:2</A> The grave being constructed in such a way that the four corners lie in the direction of the four quarters, the back, or west side of the grave would really mean the side facing the north-west.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1135"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1142">428:3</A> Or, perhaps, more extended, more numerous or prosperous.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1136"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1143">428:4</A> In reality, the north means here the side facing the north-east. The side of the tumulus is to form a quadrilateral, of which the two sides intersecting each other at the north corner, are to be longer than the two which intersect at the south corner; viz. each of the <A NAME="page_429"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 429</FONT></A> former is to measure one man's length plus 9&frac14; a&#7749;gulas (thumb's breadths), and each of the latter one man's length minus 9&frac14; a&#7749;gulas. See comm. on V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 1.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1137"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1144">429:1</A> That is, by twisting or spinning the strands from right to left, or contrary to the sun's course. The cord is extended round the grave from right to left (east, north, west, south) by means of pegs driven into the ground at the four corners; see <a href="sbe44116.htm#13:8:4:1">XIII, 8, 4, 1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1138"></A><A HREF="sbe44113.htm#fr_1146">429:2</A> I do not see how the usual force of 'atho'--viz. that of introducing a new element or argument either analogous, or not quite conformable, to what precedes (cf. Delbr&uuml;ck, Altind. Syntax, p. 513)--can apply to this double use of the particle. The two 'atho' seem to introduce the reasons for his digging up the ground, and for his not digging up more than a man's size.</P>
