He says, 'Let me be a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin (student):' he thereby makes himself over to the Brahman. He (the teacher) then says, 'What (ka) is thy name?'--now Ka is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati: he thus initiates him after making him one belonging to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati.</p>

'Thou art a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin,' he says, and thus commits him to the Brahman;--'sip water!'--water, doubtless, means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is thus what he tells him;--'do thy work!'--work, doubtless, means vigour: 'exert vigour' is thus what he tells him;--'put on fuel!'--'enkindle thy mind with fire, with holy lustre!' is what he thereby tells him;--'do not sleep&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_286"></A><A HREF="#fn_286"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>!'--'do not die' is what he thereby says to him;--'sip water!'--water means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is what he thus tells him.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:4:12">11:5:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. Concerning this they also sing the verse,--'By laying his right hand on (the pupil), the teacher becomes pregnant (with him): in the third (night) he is born as a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a with the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_290"></A><A HREF="#fn_290"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'

<p><A NAME="page_89"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 89</FONT></A></p>  
<p>however, teach a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a (the S&acirc;vitr&icirc;) at once, for the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a belongs to Agni, and Agni is born at once&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_291"></A><A HREF="#fn_291"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: therefore, he should teach the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a at once.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:4:13">11:5:4:13</A></FONT></span>13. Now some teach an Anush<I>t</I>ubh S&acirc;vitr&icirc;, saying, 'The Anush<I>t</I>ubh is speech: we thus lay speech into him.' But let him not do so; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (student) has taken away his (the teacher's) speech: he will become dumb;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore teach him that G&acirc;yatr&icirc; S&acirc;vitr&icirc;.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:4:14">11:5:4:14</A></FONT></span>14. And some recite it to him while he (the student) is standing or sitting on (the teacher's) right side; but let him not do this; for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (teacher) has born this (student) sideways, he will become averse to him;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass: let him therefore recite it in a forward (easterly) direction to (the student) looking at him towards the west.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:4:15">11:5:4:15</A></FONT></span>15. He (first) recites it by p&acirc;das&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_292"></A><A HREF="#fn_292"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>: there being three breathings, the out-breathing, the up-breathing and the through-breathing; it is these he thus lays into him;--then by half-verses: there being these</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A></p>  
<p>two (principal) breathings, the out-breathing and the up-breathing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_293"></A><A HREF="#fn_293"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, it is the out-breathing and the up-breathing he thus lays into him;--then the whole (verse): there being this one vital air (in man), he thus lays the whole vital air into the whole of him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:4:16">11:5:4:16</A></FONT></span>16. As to this they say, 'When one has admitted a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a to a term of studentship, he should not carry on sexual intercourse, lest he should generate this Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a from shed seed; for, indeed, he who enters on a term of studentship becomes an embryo.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:4:17">11:5:4:17</A></FONT></span>17. And concerning this they also say, 'He may nevertheless do so, if he chooses; for these creatures are of two kinds, divine and human,--these human creatures are born from the womb, and the divine creatures, being the metres (verses of scripture), are born from the month: it is therefrom he (the teacher) produces him, and therefore he may do so (have intercourse) if he chooses.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:5:4:18">11:5:4:18</A></FONT></span>18. And they also say, 'He who is a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin should not eat honey, lest he should reach the end of food, for honey, doubtless, is the utmost (supreme) essence of plants.' But <I>S</I>vetaketu &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>eya, when eating honey, whilst he was a student, said, 'This honey, in truth, is the remainder (essential part) of the triple science (the Vedas), and he, indeed, who has such a remainder, is an essence.' And, indeed, if a Brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin, knowing this, eats honey, it is just as if he were to utter either a <I>Ri</I>k-verse, or Ya<I>g</I>us-formula, or a S&acirc;man-tune: let him therefore eat freely of it.</p>
