### NINTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:1">13:1:9:1</span></span>1.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 22 <span id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_739)\], 'In the
priestly office (brahman) may the Brâhma*n*a be born, endowed with
spiritual lustre (brahmavar*k*asa):' on the Brâhma*n*a he thereby
bestows spiritual lustre, whence of old the Brâhma*n*a was born as one
endowed with spiritual lustre <span id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_740).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:2">13:1:9:2</span></span>2. 'In
the royal order may the Râ*g*anya be born, heroic, skilled in archery,
sure of his mark, and a mighty car-fighter:' on the Râ*g*anya he thereby
bestows the grandeur of heroism <span id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_741),
whence of old the Râ*g*anya was born as one heroic, skilled in archery,
certain of his mark, and a mighty car-fighter.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:3">13:1:9:3</span></span>3. 'The
milch cow:' on the cow he thereby bestows milk; whence of old the cow
was born as one yielding milk.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:4">13:1:9:4</span></span>4. 'The
draught ox:' on the ox he thereby bestows strength, whence of old the ox
was born as a draught (animal).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:5">13:1:9:5</span></span>5. 'The
swift racer:' on the horse he thereby bestows speed, whence of old the
horse was born as a runner.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:6">13:1:9:6</span></span>6. 'The
well-favoured woman:' on the woman

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

he thereby bestows beautiful form, whence the beautiful maiden is apt to
become dear (to men).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:7">13:1:9:7</span></span>7. 'The
victorious warrior:' on the Râ*g*anya he thereby bestows the grandeur of
victoriousness <span id="fr_746"></span>[1](#fn_742), whence of old the
Râ*g*anya was born as one victorious.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:8">13:1:9:8</span></span>8. 'The
blitheful youth:' he, indeed, is a blitheful (or, sociable) youth who is
in his prime of life; whence one who is in his prime of life is apt to
become dear to women.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:9">13:1:9:9</span></span>9. 'May
a hero be born unto this Sacrificer!' on the Sacrificer's family he
thereby bestows manly vigour, whence of old a hero was born to him who
had performed the (A*s*vamedha) sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:9:10">13:1:9:10</span></span>10.
'May Par*g*anya rain for us whensoever we list!'--where they perform
this sacrifice, there Par*g*anya, indeed, rains whenever they
list;--'may our fruit-bearing plants ripen!'--there the fruit-bearing
plants indeed ripen where they perform this sacrifice;--'may security of
possession be assured for us!'--where they perform this sacrifice there
security of possession indeed is assured; whence wherever they perform
this (A*s*vamedha) sacrifice, security of possession becomes assured to
the people.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_739"></span>[294:1](sbe44082.htm#fr_743) These formulas are
muttered after the thirteen samidhs have been put in the ukhâ, or
fire-pan. See [p. 290](sbe44080.htm#page_290), note
[1](sbe44080.htm#fn_728).

<span id="fn_740"></span>[294:2](sbe44082.htm#fr_744) 'Whence formerly a
Brâhma*n*a was at once born as Brahmavar*k*asin (whilst now he must
study),' Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 287. Perhaps, however, 'purâ'
has here (as it certainly has in the following paragraphs) the force of
'agre'--at the beginning, from the first, from of old.

<span id="fn_741"></span>[294:3](sbe44082.htm#fr_745) I take '*s*auryam
mahimânam' here (and '*g*aitra*m* mahimânam' in [paragraph
7](sbe44082.htm#13:1:9:7)) to stand in apposition to one another, with
something of the force of a compound word. See above, [p.
66](sbe44023.htm#page_66), note [4](sbe44024.htm#fn_225).

<span id="fn_742"></span>[295:1](sbe44082.htm#fr_746) See note
[3](#fn_741), [p. 294](#page_294).
