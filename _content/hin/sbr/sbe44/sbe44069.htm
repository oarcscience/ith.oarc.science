When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw this sacrificial performance, the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, and performed it, and then he was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice is, as it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it were, taken from him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:2">12:8:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;: as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so, indeed, does he replenish himself,--he replenishes himself by offspring and cattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, or he who (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins the heavenly world.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:4">12:8:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. He replied, 'The observance of the fast, assuredly, is the head of the sacrifice, and the initiation its body. And the truth, doubtless, is of the form of the fast-observance, and faith of that of the initiation. And mind is of the form of the Sacrificer, and speech of that of the sacrifice.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:5">12:8:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Thus, when he enters upon the fast-observance, he thereby restores the head to the body of the sacrifice, and he puts truth into faith, and the Sacrificer into the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:6">12:8:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Therefore at this sacrifice (the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;) the fast-observance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is the initiation. Now, the fast-observance is a male, and the initiation a female; and the truth is a male, and faith a female; and the mind is a male, and speech a female; and the Sacrificer is the male to his wife, whence wherever there is a husband there is a wife: and at the very outset of the sacrifice he thus sets up couples with a view to production.</p>

All of them relate to the A<I>s</I>vins, all of them to Sarasvat&icirc;, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>

The &Acirc;pr&icirc;-formulas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> are anush<I>t</I>ubh verses; for the Anush<I>t</I>ubh is speech, and with speech Soma is pressed: he thus presses it with speech, for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-sacrifice. All of them relate to the A<I>s</I>vins, all of them to Sarasvat&icirc;, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>

This Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an ish<I>t</I>i-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof, for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:22">12:8:2:22</A></FONT></span>22. The Adhvaryus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_625"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> drink (the contents of) the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina (cup), for the A<I>s</I>vins are the Adhvaryus of the gods: they thus consume each his own share in his own abode.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:23">12:8:2:23</A></FONT></span>23. The Hot<I>ri</I>, Brahman, and Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a (drink that) of the S&acirc;rasvata (cup), for the Hot<I>ri</I> is the voice of the sacrifice, the Brahman its heart, and the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a its mind: they thus consume each his own share in his own abode.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:24">12:8:2:24</A></FONT></span>24. The Sacrificer drinks (that of) the Aindra (cup), for this sacrifice, the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has his abode along with Indra: he thus consumes his own share in his own abode.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:25">12:8:2:25</A></FONT></span>25. The &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina cup, indeed, is the eye, the S&acirc;rasvata one the vital air, and the Aindra one</p>

<p><A NAME="page_246"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 246</FONT></A></p>  
<p>speech. From the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina (cup) he pours (the remains) into the S&acirc;rasvata one, whereby he combines his eye with the vital airs; from the S&acirc;rasvata cup) into the Aindra one, whereby he combines his vital airs with his speech, and also establishes his vital airs in (the channel of) speech, whence all the vital airs are established on speech.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:26">12:8:2:26</A></FONT></span>26. Three (men) drink the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina (cup), to wit, the Adhvaryu, Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>, and Agn&icirc;dh; for this eye is threefold--the white, the black, and the pupil: he thus bestows on him the eye in accordance with its form.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:27">12:8:2:27</A></FONT></span>27. Three (drink) the S&acirc;rasvata (cup), the Hot<I>ri</I>, Brahman, and Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a; for threefold divided is this vital air--the in (and out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: he thus bestows on him the vital air in accordance with its form.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:28">12:8:2:28</A></FONT></span>28. Singly the Sacrificer drinks the Aindra (cup), for single is that distinction of the vital airs, speech: singly and solely to himself does he take that distinction, speech; whence he who has performed the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; becomes singly and solely the most distinguished among his own people, and so does even he who knows this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:29">12:8:2:29</A></FONT></span>29. The officiating priests (<I>ri</I>tvi<I>g</I>), doubtless, are the seasons (<I>ri</I>tu), and the draughts (of liquor) are the months;--six priests drink, for there are six seasons: by means of the priests he thus secures the seasons.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:30">12:8:2:30</A></FONT></span>30. There are twelve draughts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and twelve</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_247"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 247</FONT></A></p>  
<p>months: by means of the draughts he thus secures the months. The priests drink again and again by turns, whence the seasons and months succeed one another by turns.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:31">12:8:2:31</A></FONT></span>31. The thirteenth draught the Sacrificer takes, for, indeed, that thirteenth month is manifestly the year itself: it is this he secures by obtaining (that draught). And, indeed, the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is the same as the year, and by means of this he wins everything, and secures everything for himself.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:32">12:8:2:32</A></FONT></span>32. There are three victims, for three in number are these worlds: it is these worlds he thereby secures,--to wit, this (terrestrial) world by that of the A<I>s</I>vins, the air by that of Sarasvat&icirc;, and the sky by that of Indra: he thus wins and secures these worlds for himself in accordance with their (peculiar) form and deity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:33">12:8:2:33</A></FONT></span>33. There are three sacrificial cakes, for there are three seasons: it is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the summer by that of Indra, the rainy season by that of Savit<I>ri</I>, and the winter by that of Varu<I>n</I>a: he thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their (peculiar) form and deity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:34">12:8:2:34</A></FONT></span>34. There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are six seasons: it is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the spring and summer by the two &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina (cups), the rainy season and autumn by the two S&acirc;rasvata ones, and the winter and dewy season by the two Aindra ones: he thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their form and deity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:35">12:8:2:35</A></FONT></span>35. The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous, and relate to the same deities--</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_248"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 248</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for the sake of the continuity and uninterruptedness of the seasons. They are all of them invitatory-formulas and all offering-formulas&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, whence all the seasons pass onwards, and all of them return. All (the formulas) are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the seasons are first, all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two (formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the form of day and night: it is the day and the night he thus secures for himself; whence both the seasons and the months are established on day and night.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:2:36">12:8:2:36</A></FONT></span>36. The Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, truly, is the same as the year, and the same as the moon; and the Sacrificer is manifestly the sun: his vedi (altar-ground) is this earth, his uttara-vedi the air, his barhis the sky, his officiating priests the quarters, his fuel the trees, his ghee the waters, his oblations the plants, his fire Agni himself, his sa<I>m</I>sth&acirc; (the particular form of sacrifice) the year--and, indeed, everything here, whatever there is, is the year; whence he who has performed the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; wins everything, and secures everything for himself.</p>

It may be remarked, however, that the deities here connected with the three services (the A<I>s</I>vins, Sarasvat&icirc;, and Indra) are not those elsewhere associated with them (Vasus, Rudras, and &Acirc;dityas, IV, 3, 5, 1; or Agni, Indra, Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>, XI, 5, 9, 7).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_618"></A><A HREF="sbe44069.htm#fr_620">242:3</A> The 'praisha' are the directions by which the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a calls on the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the offering-formulas (cf. part ii, p. 183, note 2). For the fore-offerings of the three victims, these directions are given, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXI, 29-40. They all commence with 'Hot&acirc; <A NAME="page_243"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 243</FONT></A> yakshat' (may the Hot<I>ri</I> worship!), and end with 'paya<I>h</I> soma<I>h</I> parisrut&acirc; gh<I>ri</I>ta<I>m</I> madhu vyantv &acirc;<I>g</I>yasya hotar ya<I>g</I>a' (milk, Soma, with parisrut-liquor, ghee, honey,--may they partake of the butter, Hot<I>ri</I> worship!).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_622"></A><A HREF="sbe44069.htm#fr_624">244:1</A> This refers to the puro<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>nuv&acirc;ky&acirc;s and y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;s of the oblations of omentum (vap&acirc;) of the three victims. For these formulas the three verses, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XX, 67-69, are used in such a way that verse 1 forms the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, and verse 2 the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, of the A<I>s</I>vins&#8217; oblation; verse 2 the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, and verse 3 the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, of Sarasvat&icirc;'s oblation; and verse 3 the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;, and verse 1 the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, of Indra's oblation. In each of the three verses all the three deities are mentioned.--In exactly the same way the three verses, XX, 70-72, are used as the anuv&acirc;ky&acirc;s and y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;s of the three pa<I>s</I>upuro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>as; and 73-75 as those of the chief oblations (havis) of meat-portions.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_623"></A><A HREF="sbe44069.htm#fr_625">244:2</A> The &Acirc;pr&icirc;s (propitiatory verses, cf. part ii, p. 185) are the offering-formulas (y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;) of the eleven (or twelve) fore-offerings (pray&acirc;<I>g</I>a) of the animal sacrifice. Those used on the present occasion are the twelve verses given, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XX, 55-66; there being on this occasion (in the second and third places) fore-offerings both to Tan&ucirc;nap&acirc;t and Nar&acirc;<I>s</I>a<I>m</I>sa.
