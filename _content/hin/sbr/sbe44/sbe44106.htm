The central day is an ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_987"></A><A HREF="#fn_982"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for the twenty-one-fold is yonder sun, and he is the A<I>s</I>vamedha: by means of his own Stoma he thus establishes him in his own deity,--therefore it is an ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day.</p>

For the obtainment of the A<I>s</I>vamedha, the ati<I>kh</I>andas (verse, II, 22, 1), 'In the three troughs the buffalo drank the barley-draught,' is the opening verse of the Marutvat&icirc;ya (<I>s</I>astra); for outstanding, indeed, is this ati<I>kh</I>andas (hypercatalectic verse) amongst metres, and outstanding is the A<I>s</I>vamedha amongst sacrifices. This (verse), being recited thrice, amounts to a triplet, and thereby he obtains the object of desire which (may be contained) in the triplet. 'Here, O good one, is the pressed plant' (<I>Ri</I>g-veda VIII, 2, 1-3) is the 'anu<I>k</I>ara' (sequent triplet): this same (triplet) is the constant</p>

Having recited the S&acirc;vitra (triplet, VI, 71, 4-6), 'Up rose this god Savit<I>ri</I>, the friend of the house . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day's sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_998"></A><A HREF="#fn_993"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>. Having recited the four verses to Heaven and Earth (IV, 56, 1-4), 'The mighty Heaven and Earth, the most glorious, here . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn I, 159) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the &Acirc;rbhava (hymn, IV, 34), '<I>Ri</I>bhu, Vibhvan, Indra, V&acirc;<I>g</I>a, come ye to this our sacrifice . . .,'</p>

<p>he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 111) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the (hymn, V, 41) to the All-gods, 'Who is there righteous unto you, Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a? . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 89) of the one-day's sacrifice.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:5:1:12">13:5:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. Then as to the &Acirc;gnim&acirc;ruta&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_999"></A><A HREF="#fn_994"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. Having recited the (hymn, VI, 7) to (Agni) Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara, 'The head of the sky, and the disposer of the earth . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, III, 3) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the (hymn, V, 57) to the Maruts, 'Hither, O Rudras, come ye united with Indra . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 87) of the one-day's sacrifice. Having recited the nine verses (VI, 15, 1-9) to <I>G</I>&acirc;tavedas, 'This guest of yours, the early-waking . . .,' he inserts the Nivid in the (hymn, I, 143) of the one-day's sacrifice. And as to why the (hymns) of the one-day's sacrifice are used for inserting the Nivid, it is for the sake of his (the Sacrificer's) not being deprived of a firm foundation, for the <I>G</I>yotish<I>t</I>oma is a foundation.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:5:1:13">13:5:1:13</A></FONT></span>13.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:5:1:14">13:5:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. Then those (victims) for the twenty-one (stakes). He seizes twenty-one animals for each of the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1003"></A><A HREF="#fn_998"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; for as many as there are gods of the Seasonal offerings so many are all the gods; and all objects of desire are in the A<I>s</I>vamedha: 'by gratifying all the deities I shall gain all my desires,' so he thinks. But let him not proceed in this way.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:5:1:15">13:5:1:15</A></FONT></span>15. Let him seize seventeen victims for the central stake&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1004"></A><A HREF="#fn_999"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, in order that he may gain and secure every-thing,</p>

<p>for the seventeenfold is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and the seventeenfold (stoma) is everything, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything;--and sixteen at each of the other (stakes) in order that he may gain and secure everything, for everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything. Thirteen wild (beasts) he seizes for each intermediate space, in order that he may gain and secure everything, for the year consists of thirteen months, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything.</p>

Now, prior to the (chanting of the) Bahishpavam&acirc;na, they (the assistants of the Adhvaryu) bring up the horse, after cleansing it; and with it they glide along for the Pavam&acirc;na: the mystic import of this has been explained&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1005"></A><A HREF="#fn_1000"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. When the Bahishpavam&acirc;na has been chanted, they make the horse step on the place of chanting: if it sniffs, or turns away, let him know that his sacrifice is successful. Having led up that (horse), the Adhvaryu says, 'Hot<I>ri</I>, sing praises!' and the Hot<I>ri</I> sings its praises&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1006"></A><A HREF="#fn_1001"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> with eleven (verses, <I>Ri</I>g-veda I, 163, 1-11)--</p>

'When, first born, thou didst neigh . . .'--thrice (he praises) with the first, and thrice with the last (verse), these amount to fifteen,--fifteenfold is the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt means vigour: with that thunderbolt, vigour, the Sacrificer thus from the very first repels evil: thus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1007"></A><A HREF="#fn_1002"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, indeed, it is to the Sacrificer that the thunderbolt is given in</p>

<p>order to smite for him whoever is to be smitten.--[<I>Ri</I>g-veda I, 163, 12. 13], The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying. . . .'--'The racer hath gone forward to the highest place. . .'--</p>

Having omitted these two (verses), he inserts the hymn (I, 162), 'Never (shall forget us) Mitra, Varu<I>n</I>a, Aryaman, &Acirc;yu . . .,' in the Adhrigu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1008"></A><A HREF="#fn_1003"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (litany). Some, however, insert this verse (I, 162, 18), 'Thirty-four (ribs) of the steed, akin to the gods, (doth the knife hit) . . .,' before the (passage,--'twenty-six are its) ribs,' thinking lest they should place the holy syllable 'om' in the wrong place&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1009"></A><A HREF="#fn_1004"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, or lest they should suggest the plural by a singular&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1010"></A><A HREF="#fn_1005"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Let him not proceed thus, but let him insert the hymn as a whole.--'The swift racer hath gone forward to the slaying . . .'--<font size="-1" color="green">'</font>The racer hath gone forward to the highest place . . .'--</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_977"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fr_982">376:1</A> According to the practice here referred to, the Agnish<I>t</I>omas&acirc;man would not consist merely of the one triplet (usually S&acirc;mav. II, 53-4 i.e. the so-called ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya triplet) ordinarily used for it, but of four different S&acirc;mans, inasmuch as three of the triplets which may be used for the Uktha-stotras (of the Ukthya and other sacrifices) are added to that ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya triplet. In that case, however, the latter is not chanted to its own 'ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya' tune, but the V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya tune is used for all the four triplets. This practice is somewhat vaguely referred to in T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XIX, 5, 10-11. 'One S&acirc;man (tune), many metres (texts): therefore one (man) feeds many creatures. Verily, the Agnish<I>t</I>oma (s&acirc;man) is the self, and the metres (hymn-texts) are cattle: he thus secures cattle for his own self. It is neither an Ukthya nor an Agnish<I>t</I>oma (sacrifice), for cattle are neither (entirely) domestic nor wild (viz. because though kept "in the village," they also freely graze "in the forest").' Here the passage 'One S&acirc;man, many metres,' according to the commentary, refers to the V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya tune as being employed, on this occasion, for the texts of the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya, the S&acirc;kama<I>s</I>va (II, 55-57, here the Calc. ed., by mistake, calls the second tune figured for chanting, like the first, S&acirc;kama<I>s</I>va, instead of V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya), the Saubhara (II, 230-2, where the Calc. ed., by mistake, omits the name V&acirc;ravant&icirc;ya), and the Taira<I>s</I><I>k</I>a (II, 233-5; curiously enough, the Taira<I>s</I><I>k</I>a is not mentioned, in L&acirc;<I>t</I>y.

II, 233, states distinctly, 'taira<I>s</I><I>k</I>a<I>m</I> t<I>ri</I>t&icirc;yam uktham'). Whilst, as Uktha-stotras, the last three texts would usually he chanted in the ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a, or twenty-one-versed form, in the present instance, as part of the <I>k</I>atush<I>t</I>oma, they would be chanted (along with the Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&icirc;ya) in the twenty-four-versed form. Thus, though an Agnish<I>t</I>oma sacrifice, inasmuch as it has twelve stotras, yet it is not a regular one; neither is it an Ukthya, because the Ukthas are not chanted as so many Stotras, followed by the recitation of separate Sastras. In the &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r.

Some of the later authorities, however, identify it with the '<I>k</I>&acirc;taka' <A NAME="page_383"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 383</FONT></A> ('cuculus melanoleucus'). With regard to some of the wild animals referred to in the corresponding section of the V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S., the commentator Mah&icirc;dhara significantly remarks (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIV, 29; cf. K&acirc;ty. XX, 6, 6 scholl.) that the meaning of such names as are not understood must be made out with the help of quotations (nigama), Vedic vocabularies (nigha<I>n</I><I>t</I>u) and their comments (nirukta), grammar (vy&acirc;kara<I>n</I>a), the Un&acirc;div<I>ri</I>tti, and dictionaries.</P>

For autumn there are to be (three) quails, for winter 'kakara,' and for the dewy season 'vikakara.' Then follow, to the end of the 260 wild animals, a long series of divinities to each of which (or sometimes to allied deities) three animals are consigned. Thirteen of these wild animals are placed on each of the twenty spaces between the twenty-one stakes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_998"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fr_1003">383:2</A> Or, perhaps, for the (eleven) deities of the Seasonal offerings he seizes twenty-one animals for each (stake); which would certainly simplify the distribution of those animals. Regarding the victims actually consecrated to the deities of the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sya offerings, see <A HREF="sbe44087.htm#page_309">p. 309</A>, note <A HREF="sbe44087.htm#fn_787">2</A>.</P>

To these are afterwards added Agni's two victims belonging to the two sets of eleven victims (of the other twenty of which one is assigned to each of the other stakes).</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1001"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fr_1006">384:2</A> The mode of recitation is similar to that of the kindling-verses (likewise eleven, brought up, by <I>r</I>epetitions of the first and last, to fifteen), viz. by making a pause after each half-verse, but without adding the syllable 'om' thereto. &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r.

<P><A NAME="fn_1002"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fr_1007">384:3</A> Harisv&acirc;min explains 'tad vai' as standing for 'sa vai' (li&#7749;gavyatyayena)--viz. that fifteenfold thunderbolt.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1003"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fr_1008">385:1</A> On this recitation, consisting of a lengthy set of formulas, addressed to the slaughterers, see part ii, p, 188, note 2. The whole of the formulas are given Ait. Br. II, 6-7. The hymn, according to &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. X, 8, 7; is to be inserted either before the last formula of the litany, or somewhat further back--viz. before the formula 'sha<I>d</I>vi<I>m</I><I>s</I>atir asya va&#7749;krayas,' 'twenty-six are its ribs'--whilst our Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a rather allows the alternative of the eighteenth verse of I, 162 being inserted at the latter place,--unless, indeed, the insertion in that case is to be made immediately before the word 'va&#7749;kraya<I>h</I>' which is scarcely likely.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1004"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fr_1009">385:2</A> Harisv&acirc;min seems to take this to mean that as this verse is of the same nature as the formulas of the Adhrigu litany, he is to treat it as such, as otherwise, in reciting he would have to pronounce 'om' after that verse, which is not done after those formulas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1005"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fr_1010">385:3</A> Or, the plurality by the individual. Owing to the corrupt state of the MS., the commentator's explanation of this passage is not clear. He seems, however, at any rate, to take the 'plural' to refer to the formula 'sha<I>d</I>vi<I>m</I><I>s</I>atir asya va&#7749;krayas,' where apparently 'esh&acirc;m' has to be substituted for 'asya' on this occasion, as many victims are immolated, and the ribs of a plurality of beasts are thus indicated, whilst in verse eighteen of the hymn, on the <A NAME="page_386"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 386</FONT></A> contrary, only the ribs of one horse (thus forming a kind of unit) are referred to; and if that verse were recited, along with the whole hymn, before the final formula which refers to all the victims, the necessary connection would be interrupted.</P>
