<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:2:1:12">14:2:1:12</A></FONT></span>12, 'Flow for Sarasvat&icirc;!'--Sarasvat&icirc;, doubtless, is Speech, and with speech the A<I>s</I>vins then restored the head of the Sacrifice: it is those (A<I>s</I>vins) he thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Flow for Sarasvat&icirc;!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:2:1:13">14:2:1:13</A></FONT></span>13.

The (spilt) drops he then consecrates with, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice: he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice, and therefore he says, 'Hail, possessed of Indra! hail, possessed of Indra!' Thrice he says it, for threefold is the sacrifice. The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.</p>

He then steps up to the site of the G&acirc;rhapatya with, 'I pass along the wide aerial realm,'--the mystic import of this is the same as before&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1264"></A><A HREF="#fn_1256"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

Thereupon (having lifted up the pot) he sweeps it clean with a branch of reed grass: the mystic import of this is the same as before.</p>

He then puts it on the 'supporting' tray&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1266"></A><A HREF="#fn_1258"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with, 'By the air I support thee,'--for the 'supporting' tray is the air, since everything here is supported by the air; and the 'supporting' tray also is the belly, for all food and drink here is supported (held) by the belly: therefore he says, 'By the air I support thee.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="14:2:1:18">14:2:1:18</A></FONT></span>18.

With, 'O Indra and ye A<I>s</I>vins!'--for Indra is the deity of the sacrifice, and he thus pleases him who is the deity of the sacrifice; and 'Ye A<I>s</I>vins' he says, because the A<I>s</I>vins at that time restored the head of the sacrifice, and it is them he thus pleases: therefore he says, 'O Indra and ye A<I>s</I>vins!'</p>

'Of bees&#8217; honey'--this is indeed honey;--'drink ye the Gharma (hot draught),'--that is to say, drink ye the liquor;'--'ye true ones,'--those (deities) are indeed true (vasu), for it is</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1248"></A><A HREF="sbe44121.htm#fr_1256">472:2</A> According to the S&ucirc;tras and the Taitt. &Acirc;r., the southern cake <A NAME="page_473"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 473</FONT></A> is offered at this juncture of the performance, whilst the northern one is offered later on (see <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41">XIV, 2, 2, 41</A>). For both cakes one and the same text is used, viz. the first of the two here mentioned at the morning performance, whilst the second is used at the afternoon performance. The cakes, being one-kap&acirc;la ones (the two 'rauhi<I>n</I>ahavan&icirc;' ladles serving as kap&acirc;las), must be offered entire. Cf. K&acirc;ty. XXVI, 4, 14; 6, 18; &Acirc;past. XV, 10, 1; 11, 5; 12, 7; Taitt. &Acirc;r. IV, 10, 4. Though our Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a expresses itself in a rather peculiar way, its statement, here and at <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41">XIV, 2, 2, 41</A>, is perhaps meant to imply the same mode of procedure. If this is the case, the two paragraphs would mean,--at this juncture of the two performances he offers the two southern (northern, at <a href="sbe44122.htm#14:2:2:41">XIV, 2, 2, 41</A>) cakes,--the two cakes (the southern and the northern one) of the morning performance requiring the first, and those of the afternoon performance the second, text. It is not impossible, however, that the author intends a different mode of procedure or wishes to leave it purposely vague. If we were to read 'rauhi<I>n</I>am' for 'rauhi<I>n</I>au,' the text would be more in accordance with the practice prescribed in the S&ucirc;tras. Cf. also Mah&icirc;dh. (on V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXVII, 21)--where read 'rauhi<I>n</I>au' instead of 'pravargyau'--who adopts the procedure here explained.</P>
