<P><A NAME="fn_815"></A><A HREF="sbe44090.htm#fr_819">320:1</A> The 'iti' seems superfluous; Harisv&acirc;min explains it by 'etat trayam.' For a similar use of the particle, see <a href="sbe44084.htm#13:2:2:1">XIII, 2, 2, 1</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_816"></A><A HREF="sbe44090.htm#fr_820">320:2</A> That is, they spread them on the ground for the horse to lie upon. Differently St. Petersb. Dict., 'they spread over the horse;' but see K&acirc;ty. XX, 6, 10 comm.; and Harisv&acirc;min:--v&acirc;so yad antardh&acirc;n&acirc;y&acirc;lam, adhiv&acirc;so yad &acirc;<I>k</I><I>kh</I>&acirc;dan&acirc;y&acirc;lam, ta<I>k</I> <I>k</I>a v&acirc;sasa upari stara<I>n</I>&icirc;ya<I>m</I>, tayor upari hira<I>n</I>ya<I>m</I> nidheyam, tasmi<I>m</I>s traye enam adhi upari sa<I>m</I><I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>apayanti;--and he then remarks that these three objects here do not take the place of the stalk of grass which, in the ordinary animal sacrifice, is thrown on the place where the victim is to be killed and cut up (III, 8, 1, 14; K&acirc;ty. VI, 5, 15-16), but that the stalk is likewise put down on this occasion. Similarly the comm. on K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, where it is stated that the stalk of grass (or straw) is first laid down, and then the others thereon. Indeed, as was the case in regard to the stalk of grass--representing the barhis, or layer of sacrificial grass on the vedi--so here the fourfold underlayer is intended to prevent any part of the sacrificial material (havis)--the victim in this case--from being spilt. The <A NAME="page_321"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 321</FONT></A> upper garment (or cloth) must be sufficiently large to allow its being afterwards turned up so as to cover the horse and the queen consort.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_817"></A><A HREF="sbe44090.htm#fr_821">321:1</A> Prior to these, however, he offers the two 'Paripa<I>s</I>avya,' i.e. 'oblations relating to the victim,'--or, perhaps, 'oblations performed in connection with the carrying of fire round the victim,' for this last ceremony is performed for all the victims (whereupon the wild beasts placed between the stakes are let loose) before the killing of the horse. See III, 8, 1, 6-16.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_818"></A><A HREF="sbe44090.htm#fr_822">321:2</A> For the symbolic import of this, see III, 8, 2, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_819"></A><A HREF="sbe44090.htm#fr_823">321:3</A> These are just three variants used in addressing a mother (Mutter, M&uuml;tterchen, M&uuml;tterlein), or, indeed, as here, any woman (good lady! good woman!. Acc. to K&acirc;ty. XX, 6, 12, this is the formula which the assistant priest (the Nesh<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, or, according to others, the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I>, cf. K&acirc;ty. VI, 5, 27-28) makes the king's wives say whilst leading them up to the slain horse to cleanse it. It is, moreover, to be preceded by the formula used, at this juncture, at the ordinary animal sacrifice, viz. 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched one, advance unresisted unto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred truth! Ye divine, pure waters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! may ye be well-prepared preparers!' (III, 8, 2, 2-3). The words 'Amb&acirc;!' &amp;c. are, according to Mah&icirc;dhara, addressed by the women to one another. The latter part of the formula as given in the V&acirc;<I>g</I> . Sa<I>m</I>h. (viz. 'the horse sleeps near Subhadrik&acirc;, dwelling in K&acirc;mp&icirc;la') is apparently <A NAME="page_322"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 322</FONT></A> rejected (? as antiquated, or inauspicious) by the author of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. The ceremony of lying near the dead horse being looked upon as assuring fertility to a woman, the formula used here is also doubtless meant to express an eagerness on the part of the women to be led to the slaughtered horse, representing the lord of creatures, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati. On this passage compare the remarks of Professor Weber (Ind. Stud. I, p. 183), who takes the formula to be spoken by the queen consort to her three fellow-wives; and who also translates the words 'na m&acirc; nayati ka<I>s</I> <I>k</I>ana' (nobody leads me) by 'nobody shall lead me (by force to the horse; but if I do not go) the (wicked) horse will lie near (another woman such as) the (wicked) Subadhr&acirc; living in K&acirc;mp&icirc;la.'--Harisv&acirc;min's commentary on this passage is rather corrupt, but he seems at all events to assume that each of the four wives apostrophizes the others with the above formula (probably substituting their real names for the words 'amb&acirc;,' &amp;c.):--lepsam (? lips&acirc;<I>m</I>) t&acirc;vad esha patn&icirc;vaktraka<I>h</I> (? patn&icirc;vakirata<I>h</I>) pr&acirc;pnoti, katham, ekaik&acirc; hi patn&icirc; itar&acirc;s tisra &acirc;mantrya <I>s</I>esh&acirc;<I>h</I> paridevayam&acirc;n&acirc; d<I>ri</I><I>s</I>yate, he ambe he ambike he amb&acirc;like y&ucirc;yam apu<I>n</I>y&acirc; n&icirc;shp&acirc;dotv asya (?) sam&icirc;pa<I>m</I>, sa <I>k</I>a pakshap&acirc;t&icirc; kutsito<FONT SIZE=-1><SUP>&#2365;</SUP></FONT>svako mayi yushm&acirc;ka<I>m</I> sasasti meva (!) subhadrik&acirc;<I>m</I> k&acirc;mp&icirc;lav&acirc;sin&icirc;m ida (? iha) sur&ucirc;p&acirc;<I>m</I> na tu m&acirc;<I>m</I> ka<I>s</I><I>k</I>it tatra nayat&icirc;ti; sasast&icirc;ty eva vartam&acirc;nas&acirc;m&icirc;pye vartam&acirc;navad (P&acirc;<I>n</I>. III, 3, 131) ity &acirc;sannasevane drash<I>t</I>avya<I>h</I>.--This barbarous ceremony was evidently an old indigenous custom too firmly established in popular practice to be easily excluded from the sacrificial ritual. That it had nothing to do with Vedic religion and was distasteful to the author of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is evident from the brief way in which he refers to it, and from the far-fetched symbolic explanations attached to the formulas and discourses.</P>

Having completed their circumambulation, the king's wives cleanse the horse's apertures of the vital airs (mouth, nostrils, eyes, &amp;c.), as the Sacrificer's wife did at the ordinary animal sacrifice (III, 8, 2, 4), which they do with the text, 'We call upon thee, the treasure-lord of treasures, O my true lord!'</P>
