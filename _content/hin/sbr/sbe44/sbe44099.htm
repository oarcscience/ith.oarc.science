When the horse was slaughtered, the life-sap&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> went out of it; it became the A<I>s</I>vastom&icirc;ya (set of oblations&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>): when he offers the A<I>s</I>vastom&icirc;ya (oblations) he indeed supplies the horse with life-sap.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:3:6:2">13:3:6:2</A></FONT></span>2. He performs it with ghee; for ghee is life-sap, and the A<I>s</I>vastom&icirc;ya is life-sap: by means of life-sap</p>

<p>he thus puts life-sap into it. He performs with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the favourite resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their favourite resource.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:3:6:4">13:3:6:4</A></FONT></span>4. Concerning this they say, 'Is the A<I>s</I>vastom&icirc;ya to be offered first, or the Dvipad&acirc;?' The A<I>s</I>vastom&icirc;ya, surely, is cattle, and the Dvipad&acirc; is man: inasmuch as he performs the Dvipad&acirc;s after performing the A<I>s</I>vastom&icirc;ya, man subsequently establishes himself amongst cattle.</p>

<p>his support. The Dvipad&acirc;s he offers last, for Dvipad&acirc;s are a support: he thus finds a support (establishes himself). With, 'To <I>G</I>umbaka hail!' he offers, at the purificatory bath, the last oblation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_880"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for <I>G</I>umbaka is Varu<I>n</I>a: by sacrifice he thus manifestly redeems himself from Varu<I>n</I>a. He offers it on the head of a white-spotted&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, baldheaded (man) with protruding teeth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and reddish brown eyes; for that is Varu<I>n</I>a's form: by (that) form (of his) he thus redeems himself from Varu<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:3:6:6">13:3:6:6</A></FONT></span>6. Having stepped out (of the water) he prepares twelve messes of cooked rice for the priests, or performs twelve ish<I>t</I>is. Concerning this they say, 'These to wit, ish<I>t</I>is--are a form of sacrifice: were he to perform ish<I>t</I>is, the sacrifice would be ready to incline towards him; but he would become the worse for it, for, surely, of exhausted strength now are the metres (offering formulas) of him who has performed the Soma-sacrifice;--how could he make use of them so soon? For when the sacrifice is complete, V&acirc;<I>k</I> (speech and sacred writ&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>) is wholly gained, and, being gained, it now is exhausted in strength, and, as it were, wounded and mangled; but sacrifice is speech: hence he should not make use of it.'</p>

Having stepped out (of the water) he should certainly prepare twelve messes of rice for the priests; for cooked rice is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the year, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is the sacrifice: it is the year, the sacrifice, he thus gains, and the sacrifice becomes ready to incline towards him, and he does not become the worse for it.</p>
