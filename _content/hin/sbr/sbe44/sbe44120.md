### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:1">14:1:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
when the Adhvaryu here steps up and says, 'The Gharma is aglow,' they
step up and revere it (the Mahâvîra) with the Avakâ*s*a <span
id="fr_1251"></span>[1](#fn_1243); but the 'avakâ*s*a' are the vital
airs: it is thus the vital airs he lays into it. Six of them <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[2](#fn_1244) step up to it, for six in number are
these vital airs in the head: it is these he thus lays into it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:2">14:1:4:2</span></span>2.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 14,\] 'The child of the gods,'--the child (garbha)
of the gods, in truth, is he that shines yonder, for he holds (grabh)
everything here, and by him everything here is held; and the Pravargya
also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he says,
'The child of the gods.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:3">14:1:4:3</span></span>3. 'The
father of thoughts,'--for he (the sun) is indeed the father of
thoughts;--'the lord of creatures,'--for he is indeed the lord of
creatures.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:4">14:1:4:4</span></span>4. 'The
god hath united with the god Savit*ri*,'--for the god (the Mahâvîra) has
indeed united with the god Savit*ri* (the sun);--'with Sûrya he
shineth,'--for (equally) with Sûrya (the sun) he has indeed shone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:5">14:1:4:5</span></span>5.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 15,\] 'Agni hath united with Agni,'--for Agni (fire)
has indeed united with Agni;--'with the divine Savit*ri*,'--for with the
divine Savit*ri* he has indeed united;--'with Sûrya

<span id="page_470">p. 470</span>

he hath shone,'--for with Sûrya he has indeed shone.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:6">14:1:4:6</span></span>6.
'Hail! Agni hath united with his heat,'--for Agni has indeed united with
his heat; the call of hail he places first, and the deity last: the
significance of this is the same as before;--'with the divine
Savit*ri*,'--for with the divine Savit*ri* he has indeed united;--'with
Sûrya he hath shed light,'--for with Sûrya he has indeed shed light.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:7">14:1:4:7</span></span>7.
These, then, are three 'avakâ*s*a,'--for there are three vital airs, the
in (and out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it
is thereby that he lays it (the vital air) into him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:8">14:1:4:8</span></span>8.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 16,\] 'The sustainer of the sky, and of heat upon
earth, shineth forth,'--for as the sustainer of the sky, and of heat on
earth, that (sun, and Mahâvîra) indeed shines forth;--'the divine
sustainer of the gods, he, the immortal, born of heat,'--for he is
indeed the divine sustainer of the gods, the immortal one, born of
heat;--'grant unto us speech, devoted to the gods!'--speech doubtless is
worship: he thus means to say thereby, 'bestow upon us worship whereby
we shall please the gods!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:9">14:1:4:9</span></span>9.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 17; *Ri*g-v. I, 164, 31; X, 177, 3,\] 'I beheld the
guardian, the never-resting <span
id="fr_1253"></span>[1](#fn_1245),'--he who shines yonder is indeed the
guardian, for he guards everything here; and he does not lie down to
rest: therefore he says, 'I beheld the guardian, the never-resting;'--

<span id="page_471">p. 471</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:10">14:1:4:10</span></span>10,
'Wandering on paths hither and thither,'--for he indeed wanders hither
and thither on the divine <span id="fr_1254"></span>[1](#fn_1246)
paths;--'arraying himself in the gathering and the radiating,'--for he
indeed arrays himself in the gathering (converging) and the radiating
regions, or rays;--'he moveth to and fro within the spheres,'--for again
and again he wanders moving within these worlds.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:11">14:1:4:11</span></span>11.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 18,\] 'O lord of all worlds, O lord of all thought,
O lord of all speech, O lord of every speech!' that is, 'O lord of all
this (universe);'--'Thou art heard by the gods, O god Gharma, as a god,
guard thou the gods!' in this there is nothing hidden, so to speak.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:12">14:1:4:12</span></span>12.
'Give thy countenance hereafter to the divine feast of you two,'--it is
with regard to the two A*s*vins that he says this, for it was the
A*s*vins that then restored the head of the sacrifice: it is them he
thus pleases, and therefore he says, 'Give thy countenance hereafter to
the divine feast of you two.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:13">14:1:4:13</span></span>13.
'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the two longing for
honey!'--for Dadhya*ñk* the Âtharva*n*a indeed told them (the A*s*vins)
the Brâhma*n*a called Madhu (honey), and this is their dear resource: it
is by means of that (dear resource) of theirs that he approaches them,
and therefore he says, 'Honey to the two lovers of honey! honey to the
two longing for honey!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:14">14:1:4:14</span></span>14.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 19,\] 'To the heart

<span id="page_472">p. 472</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (I consecrate)
thee, to the mind thee, to the sky thee, to the sun thee: going upwards
take thou the sacrifice to the gods in heaven!' in this there is nothing
hidden, so to speak.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:15">14:1:4:15</span></span>15.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 20,\] 'Thou art our father: be thou our
father!'--for he who shines yonder is indeed the father, and the
Pravargya is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies, and therefore he
says, 'Thou art our father: be thou our father!'--'Reverence be unto
thee: injure me not!'--it is a blessing he thereby invokes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:16">14:1:4:16</span></span>16.
Thereupon he uncovers the head of the (Sacrificer's) wife, and makes her
say whilst she is looking at the Mahâvîra, 'Together with Tvash*tri*
will we serve thee: (bestow thou sons and cattle upon me! bestow thou
offspring upon us! may I remain unscathed together with my
husband!)'--the Pravargya (m.) is a male, and the wife is a female: a
productive pair is thus produced.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:4:17">14:1:4:17</span></span>17.
And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya)
enters that life, and that light: the observance thereof is the same as
at the creation <span id="fr_1255"></span>[1](#fn_1247).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[469:1](sbe44120.htm#fr_1251) Avakâ*s*a
(looks, or possibly, apertures) is the technical designation of the
verses Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 14-20 a.

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[469:2](sbe44120.htm#fr_1252) Viz. the
Sacrificer and the priests with the exception of the Prastot*ri*.

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[470:1](sbe44120.htm#fr_1253) Or, as Mahîdhara
and Sâya*n*a take it, the never-falling.

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[471:1](sbe44120.htm#fr_1254) One might expect
'daívai*h* pathíbhi*h*' or 'devaí*h* pathíbhi*h*,' which Mahîdhara
explains by 'devamârgai*h*.'
