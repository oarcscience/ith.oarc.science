### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE MAKING OF THE POT.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:1">14:1:2:1</span></span>1. He
equips (the Mahâvîra) with its equipments;--inasmuch as he equips it
therewith from this and that quarter, that is the equipping nature of
the equipments <span id="fr_1187"></span>[1](#fn_1179) (sambhâra):
wheresoever anything of the sacrifice is inherent, therewith he equips
it <span id="fr_1188"></span>[2](#fn_1180).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:2">14:1:2:2</span></span>2. He
gets ready a black antelope-skin,--for the black antelope-skin is the
sacrifice <span id="fr_1189"></span>[3](#fn_1181): it is at the

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

sacrifice he thus prepares (the pot);--with its hairy side
(upwards),--for the hairs are the metres: on the metres he thus prepares
it;--(spread out) on the left (north) side <span
id="fr_1190"></span>[1](#fn_1182),--for the north is the quarter of
men;--on (the skin) with its neck-part to the east <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[2](#fn_1183), for that (tends) towards the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:3">14:1:2:3</span></span>3. With
a spade (he digs out the clay), for the spade is a thunderbolt, and the
thunderbolt is vigour: with vigour he thus supplies and completes it
(the Pravargya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:4">14:1:2:4</span></span>4. It
is made of Udumbara (Ficus glomerata) wood, for the Udumbara is
strength <span id="fr_1192"></span>[3](#fn_1184): with strength, with
vital sap, he thus supplies and completes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:5">14:1:2:5</span></span>5. Or
of Vikaṅkata (Flacourtia sapida) wood; for when Pra*g*âpati performed
his first offering, a Vikaṅkata tree sprang forth from that place where,
after offering, he cleansed (his hands); now an offering is a sacrifice,
and (consequently) the Vikaṅkata is

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

the sacrifice: with the sacrifice he thus supplies and completes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:6">14:1:2:6</span></span>6. It
is a cubit long, for a cubit means the (fore-) arm, and with the arm
strength is exerted: it (the spade) thus is composed of strength, and
with strength he thus supplies and completes it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:7">14:1:2:7</span></span>7. He
takes it up, with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 1), 'At the impulse of the god
Savit*ri*, I take thee by the arms of the A*s*vins, by the hands of
Pûshan: thou art a woman;'--the import (of this formula) is the same as
before <span id="fr_1193"></span>[1](#fn_1185).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:8">14:1:2:8</span></span>8.
Having placed it in his left hand, he touches it with the right, and
mutters (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 2), 'They harness the mind, and they harness
the thoughts, the priests of the priest, of the great inspirer of
devotion; the knower of the rites alone hath assigned the priestly
offices: great is the praise of the god Savit*ri*;'--the import of this
is the same as before <span id="fr_1194"></span>[2](#fn_1186).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:9">14:1:2:9</span></span>9. He
then takes the lump of clay with the (right) hand and spade on the right
(south) side, and with the (left) hand alone on the left (north)
side <span id="fr_1195"></span>[3](#fn_1187), with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII,
3), 'O divine Heaven and Earth,'--for when the sacrifice had its head
cut off, its sap flowed away, and entered the sky and the earth: what
clay (firm matter) there was that is this (earth), and what water there
was that is yonder (sky); hence it is of clay and water that the
Mahâvîra (vessels) are made: he thus supplies and

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

completes it (the Pravargya) with that sap; wherefore he says, 'O divine
Heaven and Earth,'--'May I this day compass for you Makha's
head,'--Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, 'May I this day
accomplish for you <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1](#fn_1188) the head of
the sacrifice;'--'on the Earth's place of divine worship,'--for on a
place of divine worship of the earth he prepares it;--'for Makha thee!
for Makha's head thee!'--Makha being the sacrifice, he thus says, 'For
the sacrifice (I consecrate) thee, for the head of the sacrifice (I
consecrate) thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:10">14:1:2:10</span></span>10.
Then an ant-hill <span id="fr_1197"></span>[2](#fn_1189) (he takes, and
puts on the skin), with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 4), 'Ye divine ants,'--for it
was they that produced this: just in accordance with the way in which
the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and
completes it with those (ants);--'the firstborn of the world,'--the
firstborn of the world, doubtless, is this earth <span
id="fr_1198"></span>[3](#fn_1190): it thus is therewith that

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

he supplies and completes it;--'may I this day compass for you Makha's
head on the Earth's place of divine worship:--for Makha thee! for
Makha's head thee!'--the import of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:11">14:1:2:11</span></span>11.
Then (earth) torn up by a boar (he takes), with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 5),
'Only thus large was she in the beginning,'--for, indeed, only so large
was this earth in the beginning, of the size of a span. A boar, called
Emûsha, raised her up, and he was her lord Pra*g*âpati: with that mate,
his heart's delight, he thus supplies and completes him <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[1](#fn_1191);--'may I this day compass for you
Makha's head on the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for
Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:12">14:1:2:12</span></span>12.
Then Âdâra <span id="fr_1200"></span>[2](#fn_1192) (-plants), with
(Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 6), 'Indra's might ye are,'--for when Indra
encompassed him (Vish*n*u) with might, then the vital sap of him, thus
encompassed, flowed away; and he lay there stinking, as it were. He
said, 'Verily, after bursting open (â-dar), as it were, this vital sap
has sung praises:' thence Âdâra (-plants originated); and because he lay
there stinking (pûy), as it were, therefore (they are also called)
Pûtîka; and hence, when placed on the fire

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

as an offering, they blaze; and hence also they are fragrant, for they
originated from the vital sap of the sacrifice. And inasmuch as Indra,
on that occasion, encompassed him with might, therefore he says,
'Indra's might ye are;'--'may I this day compass for you Makha's head on
the Earth's place of divine worship: for Makha thee! for Makha's head
thee!' the import of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:13">14:1:2:13</span></span>13.
Then goat's milk;---for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its
heat went out of it, wherefrom the goat was produced: it is with that
heat <span id="fr_1201"></span>[1](#fn_1193) that he thereby supplies
and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the
import of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:14">14:1:2:14</span></span>14.
These, then, are the five equipments with which he equips (the
Pravargya),--fivefold is the sacrifice, and fivefold the victims, and
five seasons are in the year, and the year is he that shines yonder, and
the Pravargya also is that (sun): it is him he thus gratifies. These
(objects), thus brought together, he touches with, 'For Makha (I
consecrate) thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same
as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:15">14:1:2:15</span></span>15.
Now there is an enclosed space <span id="fr_1202"></span>[2](#fn_1194)
on the north

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

side: whilst proceeding towards that (shed) they mutter (Vâ*g*. S.
XXXVII, 7; Rig-v. I, 40, 3), 'May Brahma*n*aspati go
forward!'--Brahma*n*aspati (the lord of devotion) doubtless is he that
shines yonder, and the Pravargya also is that one: it is him he thus
gratifies; hence he says, 'May Brahma*n*aspati go forward;'--'may the
goddess Gladness go forward!'--for the goddess Gladness she (Vâ*k* <span
id="fr_1203"></span>[1](#fn_1195)) is;--'unto the hero <span
id="fr_1204"></span>[2](#fn_1196), kindly to men and the dispenser of
fivefold (offerings),'--he thereby praises and magnifies it (the
Pravargya),--'unto the sacrifice may the gods lead us!'--he thereby
makes all the gods its guardians.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:16">14:1:2:16</span></span>16.
It is an enclosed space;--for at that time the gods were afraid,
thinking, 'We hope that the fiends, the Rakshas, will not injure here
this our (Pravargya):' they accordingly enclosed for it this stronghold,
and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now enclose for it this
stronghold.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:17">14:1:2:17</span></span>17.
He then deposits (the sambhâras <span id="fr_1205"></span>[3](#fn_1197))
on the mound with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import
of this is the same as before. He then takes a lump of clay and makes
the Mahâvîra (pot) with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee,'--the
import of this is

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

the same as before;--a span high <span
id="fr_1206"></span>[1](#fn_1198), for the head is, as it were, a span
high;--contracted in the middle <span id="fr_1207"></span>[2](#fn_1199),
for the head is, as it were, contracted in the middle. At the top he
then draws it out (so as to form) a spout <span
id="fr_1208"></span>[3](#fn_1200) of three thumbs’ breadths (high): he
thereby makes a nose to this (Mahâvîra, or Pravargya). When it is
complete, he touches it with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 8), 'Makha's head thou
art,'--for it indeed is the head of Makha Saumya (the Soma-sacrifice).
In the same way (he makes) the other two (Mahâvîra pots <span
id="fr_1209"></span>[4](#fn_1201)); silently two milking-bowls
(pinvana <span id="fr_1210"></span>[5](#fn_1202)), and silently two
Rauhi*n*a-plates <span id="fr_1211"></span>[6](#fn_1203).

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:18">14:1:2:18</span></span>18.
Verily this sacrifice is Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

is both of this, defined and undefined, limited and unlimited <span
id="fr_1212"></span>[1](#fn_1204). Whatever one does with a Ya*g*us
formula, by that one makes up that form of him (Pra*g*âpati) which is
defined and limited; and whatever one does silently, by that one makes
up that form of him which is undefined and unlimited: verily, then,
whosoever, knowing this, does it on this wise, makes up that whole and
complete Pra*g*âpati. But he also leaves over a lump of spare (clay) for
expiations.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:19">14:1:2:19</span></span>19.
He then smooths <span id="fr_1213"></span>[2](#fn_1205) it by means of
Gavedhukâ grass (Coix barbata),--for when the sacrifice had its head cut
off, its vital sap flowed away, and therefrom those plants grew up: with
that vital sap he thus supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha
thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before,
In the same way the other two (Mahâvîra pots); silently the two
milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhi*n*a-plates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:20">14:1:2:20</span></span>20.
He then fumigates these (vessels) with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 9), 'With dung
of the stallion, the impregnator, I fumigate thee,'--for the

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

stallion is an impregnator, and the impregnator means vigour: with
vigour he thus supplies and completes it,--'on the Earth's place of
divine worship: for Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of
this is the same as before. In the same way (he fumigates) the other two
(Mahâvîra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, and silently the two
Rauhi*n*a-plates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:21">14:1:2:21</span></span>21.
He then bakes them, for what is baked belongs to the gods. He bakes them
by means of bricks, for they it was that did so on that occasion <span
id="fr_1214"></span>[1](#fn_1206): just in accordance with the way in
which the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and
completes it with those (bricks), But, indeed, let him bake them with
anything <span id="fr_1215"></span>[2](#fn_1207) whereby they may become
properly baked. Having laid down the fuel for baking <span
id="fr_1216"></span>[3](#fn_1208), he puts down the Mahâvîra (pot),
with, 'For Makha thee, for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the
same as before. In the same way the other two Mahâvîra (pots); silently
the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhi*n*a-plates. By day he
should bury them (in the hole), and by day he should take them out, for
the day belongs to the gods.

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:22">14:1:2:22</span></span>22.
He takes out (the first pot) with (Vâ*g*. S. XXXVII, 10), 'For the
righteous one (I take) thee,'--the righteous one, doubtless, is yonder
world, for the righteous one means truth; and he that shines yonder is
the truth, and the first Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus
gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the righteous one (I take) thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:23">14:1:2:23</span></span>23.
With, 'For the efficient one thee' (he takes out the second pot),--the
efficient one (sâdhu), doubtless, is he (Vâyu, the wind) that purifies
here by blowing, for as a permanent one (siddha) he blows through these
worlds; and the second Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus
gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For the efficient one (I take) thee.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:24">14:1:2:24</span></span>24.
With, 'For a good abode thee!' (he takes out the third pot),--the good
abode, doubtless, is this (terrestrial) world, for it is in this world
that all creatures abide; and the good abode also is Agni (fire), for
Agni abides with all creatures <span id="fr_1217"></span>[1](#fn_1209)
in this world; and the third Pravargya is that (god): it is him he thus
gratifies, and therefore he says, 'For a good abode thee.' Silently (he
takes out) the two milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhi*n*a-plates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:25">14:1:2:25</span></span>25.
He then pours goat's milk upon them <span
id="fr_1218"></span>[2](#fn_1210) (the

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

first) with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this
is the same as before. In the same way the other two; silently the two
milking-bowls, and silently the two Rauhi*n*a-plates.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:1:2:26">14:1:2:26</span></span>26.
And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya)
enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule thereof is
the same as at the creation <span id="fr_1219"></span>[1](#fn_1211).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1179"></span>[447:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1187) See part i, p.
276, note 1. Here, as formerly, it has not been thought desirable to
adhere throughout to the technical rendering of 'sam-bh*ri*'

<span id="fn_1180"></span>[447:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1188) Pravargya being
masculine, the original would, of course, have 'him' here and
throughout, the ceremony (just like the sacrifice in general) being
indeed looked upon as a person.

<span id="fn_1181"></span>[447:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1189) See part i, p.
23, note 2. In making the Gharma, or Mahâvîra, <span id="page_448">p.
448</span> pot, on the present occasion, the order of proceeding is to a
considerable extent the same as that followed at the Agni*k*ayana, in
providing the materials for, and making, the fire-pan, for which, see
VI, 3, 3, 1 seqq. Cf. also the Âpastamba *S*rautas. XV, with Garbe's
Translation and Notes, Journal of Germ. Or. Soc., vol. xxxiv.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[448:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1190) That is,
immediately north of the lump of clay (previously prepared by a potter)
and the other objects to be used for making the Mahâvîra pot, which have
been previously deposited near the anta*h*pâtya peg marking the middle
of the west or hinder side of the Mahâvedi.

<span id="fn_1183"></span>[448:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1191) The locative,
instead of the accusative, is rather strange here. As it stands, the
locative is evidently parallel to 'ya*gñ*e' and '*kh*anda*h*su,' and one
has therefore to supply--he collects (prepares) the Pravargya, viz. by
putting the lump of clay and the other objects thereon.

<span id="fn_1184"></span>[448:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1192) See VI, 6, 3, 2
seqq.

<span id="fn_1185"></span>[449:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1193) See I, 1, 2, 17;
VI, 3, 1, 38 seq.

<span id="fn_1186"></span>[449:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1194) See III, 5, 3,
11-12.

<span id="fn_1187"></span>[449:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1195) Between the two
actions referred to in [paragraphs 8](sbe44118.htm#14:1:2:8) and
[9](sbe44118.htm#14:1:2:9), the digging up of the clay takes place, and
hence the spade, or trowel, has changed hands. Cf. VI, 4, 2, 2.

<span id="fn_1188"></span>[450:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1196) The pronouns in
this and the subsequent corresponding formulas (vâ*m*, va*h*, te) are
taken by Mahîdhara as accusatives ('te' according to him standing for
'tvâm') to which he supplies 'âdâya'--'having taken you, may I this day
compass Makha's head.' The pronouns are certainly somewhat awkward, as
they can scarcely be taken as genitives of material--of you, of thee.

<span id="fn_1189"></span>[450:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1197) See VI, 3, 3, 5,
where 'valmîkavapâ' is qualified by 'sushirâ,' hollow. The comm. on
Kâty. XXVI, 1, 2 explains 'valmîkavapâ' as the vapâ (omentum)-like inner
lump (? surrounded by a kind of net) of an ant-hill: in the present
case, this substance is likewise placed on the black antelope-skin to be
mixed with the clay.

<span id="fn_1190"></span>[450:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1198) Whilst in the
text of the formula this word must be taken as being plural
'prathama*g*â*h*,' the Brâhma*n*a (making use of the Sandhi-form) treats
it as if it were singular 'prathama*g*â.' Mahîdhara also, apparently
influenced by the Brâhma*n*a, explains, 'the earth is the firstborn of
creatures, and, from their connection with it, ants also are called
firstborn.'

<span id="fn_1191"></span>[451:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1199) That is, he
supplies Pra*g*âpati (and hence also his counterpart, the Sacrificer)
with the Earth, his mate. See J. Muir, Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. i, p.
53; vol. iv, p. 27; and cp. Taitt. I, 10, 8, where the earth is said to
have been uplifted by a black boar with a thousand arms.

<span id="fn_1192"></span>[451:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1200) At IV, 5, 10, 4
we met with this plant--here also called Pûtîka, and explained, by the
comm. on Kâty., as = the flowers (!) of the Rohisha plant (? Guilandina,
or Caesalpinia, Bonducella)--as a substitute for Soma-plants.

<span id="fn_1193"></span>[452:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1201) Thus perhaps
'*s*u*k*' should also have been rendered at VI, 4, 4, 7, where it is
used in connection with the ass.

<span id="fn_1194"></span>[452:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1202) Viz. a space
five cubits square enclosed with mats on all sides, and with a door on
the east side, the ground being raised in the middle so as to form a
mound covered with sand (cf. III, 1, 2, 2). The object of this enclosed
space is to prevent any unauthorised person (such as the Sacrificer's
wife, and people uninstructed in the scriptures) from seeing the
manufacturing of the Mahîvîra (during which the door is kept closed), as
well as the completed pot. <span id="page_453">p. 453</span> The place
is to the north of the anta*h*pâtya peg, the black antelope-skin being
spread to the south of it (and immediately north of the materials used
in making the pot).

<span id="fn_1195"></span>[453:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1203) Thus Mahîdhara,
on Vâ*g*. S. XXXIII, 89.

<span id="fn_1196"></span>[453:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1204) 'Vîra,'
apparently an allusion to 'Mahâ-vira' (great hero), the name of the pot
used at the Pravargya.

<span id="fn_1197"></span>[453:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1205) Viz. as placed
on the black antelope-skin which is carried northwards to the enclosed
place by the Adhvaryu and his assistants taking hold of it on all sides.

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[454:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1206) That is, from
bottom to top, a belt (mekhalâ) running round it at the distance of
three thumbs' breadths from the top (Mahîdhara, and comm. on Katy.).
This top part above the belt--here simply called 'mouth,' whilst in the
Âpast. *S*r. XV, 2, 14 it is called 'back' (sânu)--ends in a hole for
pouring the liquid in and out.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[454:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1207) That is, for
taking hold of it (mush*t*igraha*n*ayogyam, comm. on Katy.).

<span id="fn_1200"></span>[454:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1208) 'Mukha,' for
which Katy. XXVI, 1, 16 has 'âse*k*ana' explained by the commentator as
a hole (garta; comm. on Â*s*v. G*ri*hyas. IV, 3 bila), apparently
serving as the mouth, or open part of the vessel which seems to be
otherwise closed. The edge of the hole would seem to protract
sufficiently from the surface to suggest a similarity to the nose. In
making the vessel, it seems first to be left solid, the open part which
is to hold the milk being then hollowed out by means of a reed from the
top hole to the depth of less than the upper half, the remainder
remaining solid. Cf. Â*s*v. *S*r. XV, 3, 4.

<span id="fn_1201"></span>[454:4](sbe44118.htm#fr_1209) Only the first
of the three pots is, however, actually used; unless it gets broken by
accident.

<span id="fn_1202"></span>[454:5](sbe44118.htm#fr_1210) According to the
comm. on Katy. Sr., these vessels are of the form of the (hand-shaped)
bowl of an offering-ladle (sru*k*, cf. part i, p. 67, note 2).

<span id="fn_1203"></span>[454:6](sbe44118.htm#fr_1211) The
Rauhi*n*a-kapâlas are two round, flat dishes for baking the Rauhi*n*a
cakes on.

<span id="fn_1204"></span>[455:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1212) Cf. J. Muir,
Orig. Sansk. Texts, vol. v, p. 393, where a passage is quoted from Prof.
Cowell's translation of the Maitri-Upanishad (VI, 3), 'There are two
forms of Brahma, the embodied (mûrta) and the unembodied (amûrta): the
former is unreal (asatya), the latter real (satya).'--Cf. Sat. Br. VI,
5, 3, 7.

<span id="fn_1205"></span>[455:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1213) The Sûtras use
the verbs '*s*laksh*n*ayati, *s*laksh*n*îkurvanti' (to make smooth, or
soft), and this, I think, must indeed be the meaning of 'hinv.' It would
also suit very well the passage III, 5, 1, 35, where it is said that the
Vedi is a woman, and that, by sprinkling the former with water, one
'makes her smooth' for the gods. The polishing of the vessels is done by
rubbing them with Gavedhukâ grass, whether with the spike, stem, or
leaves is not specified.

<span id="fn_1206"></span>[456:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1214) That is, when
the Ukhâ was baked, cf. VI, 5, 4, 1; or, perhaps,--they it was that (the
gods) made at this juncture. The former translation is more in
accordance with what follows, though one would expect 'etad' to mean 'at
this time.'

<span id="fn_1207"></span>[456:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1215) That is, without
using bricks (?).

<span id="fn_1208"></span>[456:3](sbe44118.htm#fr_1216) Viz. in a square
hole dug for the purpose east of the Gârhapatya; the pot being then
placed bottom upwards on the burning material, dry herbs, wood, &c.
According to Â*s*v. *S*r. XV, 3, 20 such materials are to be used as,
whilst being burnt, dye red.

<span id="fn_1209"></span>[457:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1217) The accusative
with 'kshi' (to inhabit) is rather peculiar here.

<span id="fn_1210"></span>[457:2](sbe44118.htm#fr_1218) As the pots are,
however, standing with their open parts upwards, on sand north of the
hole in which they were baked, it would chiefly be inside that they
would receive the milk, being thereby cooled (cf. VI, 5, 4, 15).
According to Âpastamba, sand is in the first place heaped up around them
in the sunwise fashion, i.e. keeping them on the right side whilst
strewing it.

<span id="fn_1211"></span>[458:1](sbe44118.htm#fr_1219) That is to say,
as would seem,--even as, in creating the universe, Pra*g*âpati
reconstructs his body, or constructs himself a new body, so the
Sacrificer, in keeping up the observance of the Pravargya, constructs
himself a new body for the future life.
