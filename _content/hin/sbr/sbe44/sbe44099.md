### SIXTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:6:1">13:3:6:1</span></span>1. When
the horse was slaughtered, the life-sap <span
id="fr_875"></span>[4](#fn_871) went out of it; it became the
A*s*vastomîya (set of oblations <span id="fr_876"></span>[5](#fn_872)):
when he offers the A*s*vastomîya (oblations) he indeed supplies the
horse with life-sap.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:6:2">13:3:6:2</span></span>2. He
performs it with ghee; for ghee is life-sap, and the A*s*vastomîya is
life-sap: by means of life-sap

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

he thus puts life-sap into it. He performs with ghee, for that--to wit,
ghee--is the favourite resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with
their favourite resource.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:6:3">13:3:6:3</span></span>3.
Having performed the A*s*vastomîya (set of) oblations, he offers the
Dvipadâs <span id="fr_877"></span>[1](#fn_873); for the A*s*vastomîya is
the horse, and the Dvipadâ is man, for man is two-footed (dvipâd),
supported on two (feet): he thus supplies him with a support.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:6:4">13:3:6:4</span></span>4.
Concerning this they say, 'Is the A*s*vastomîya to be offered first, or
the Dvipadâ?' The A*s*vastomîya, surely, is cattle, and the Dvipadâ is
man: inasmuch as he performs the Dvipadâs after performing the
A*s*vastomîya, man subsequently establishes himself amongst cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:6:5">13:3:6:5</span></span>5.
Sixteen A*s*vastomîya oblations he performs, for animals (cattle)
consist of sixteen parts <span id="fr_878"></span>[2](#fn_874): that is
the measure of cattle, and he thus supplies cattle with their (right)
measure; Were he to offer either less or more, he would deprive cattle
of their (right) measure. Sixteen he offers, for cattle consist of
sixteen parts: that is the measure of cattle, and he thus supplies
cattle with their (right) measure. He offers no other as a final
oblation <span id="fr_879"></span>[3](#fn_875): were he to offer another
as a final oblation, he would lose

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

his support. The Dvipadâs he offers last, for Dvipadâs are a support: he
thus finds a support (establishes himself). With, 'To *G*umbaka hail!'
he offers, at the purificatory bath, the last oblation <span
id="fr_880"></span>[1](#fn_876); for *G*umbaka is Varu*n*a: by sacrifice
he thus manifestly redeems himself from Varu*n*a. He offers it on the
head of a white-spotted <span id="fr_881"></span>[2](#fn_877),
baldheaded (man) with protruding teeth <span
id="fr_882"></span>[3](#fn_878) and reddish brown eyes; for that is
Varu*n*a's form: by (that) form (of his) he thus redeems himself from
Varu*n*a.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:6:6">13:3:6:6</span></span>6.
Having stepped out (of the water) he prepares twelve messes of cooked
rice for the priests, or performs twelve ish*t*is. Concerning this they
say, 'These to wit, ish*t*is--are a form of sacrifice: were he to
perform ish*t*is, the sacrifice would be ready to incline towards him;
but he would become the worse for it, for, surely, of exhausted strength
now are the metres (offering formulas) of him who has performed the
Soma-sacrifice;--how could he make use of them so soon? For when the
sacrifice is complete, Vâ*k* (speech and sacred writ <span
id="fr_883"></span>[4](#fn_879)) is wholly gained, and, being gained, it
now is exhausted in strength, and, as it were, wounded and mangled; but
sacrifice is speech: hence he should not make use of it.'

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:3:6:7">13:3:6:7</span></span>7.
Having stepped out (of the water) he should certainly prepare twelve
messes of rice for the priests; for cooked rice is Pra*g*âpati, and
Pra*g*âpati is the year, Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: it is the year,
the sacrifice, he thus gains, and the sacrifice becomes ready to incline
towards him, and he does not become the worse for it.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_871"></span>[341:4](sbe44099.htm#fr_875) Or, sacrificial
essence.

<span id="fn_872"></span>[341:5](sbe44099.htm#fr_876) See [p.
336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note [2](sbe44097.htm#fn_856).

<span id="fn_873"></span>[342:1](sbe44099.htm#fr_877) The formulas of
the six dvipâdâs--i.e. (verses) consisting of two pâdas--are found
Vâ*g*. S. XXV, 46-47.

<span id="fn_874"></span>[342:2](sbe44099.htm#fr_878) See [XII, 8, 3,
13](sbe44070.htm#12:8:3:13); for a highly artificial explanation of the
sixteen parts of the man Pra*g*âpati, probably intended here, X, 4, 1,
17. Elsewhere those of animals are explained as including head, neck,
trunk, tail, the four legs and eight claws; see Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p.
111, note.

<span id="fn_875"></span>[342:3](sbe44099.htm#fr_879) This would seem to
be directed against the practice of performing the oblation to Heaven
and Earth immediately after the A*s*vastomîyâs, see [p.
336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note [2](sbe44097.htm#fn_856).

<span id="fn_876"></span>[343:1](sbe44099.htm#fr_880) See [p.
336](sbe44097.htm#page_336), note [1](sbe44097.htm#fn_855).

<span id="fn_877"></span>[343:2](sbe44099.htm#fr_881) ? Or, pale.
Sâya*n*a, on Taitt. Br. III, 9, 15, 3, explains '*s*ukla' by '*k*itrin'
(? having white spots, or affected with white leprosy). Harisvâmin does
not explain the word.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[343:3](sbe44099.htm#fr_882) Harisvâmin
explains 'viklidha' by 'dantura,' i.e. one who has projecting teeth;
whilst Sâya*n*a, l.c., explains it by either 'given to perspiring
(svedana*s*îla*s*arîra),' or 'moist-bodied (? leprous, or, old, in
bodily decay, viklinnadeha).'

<span id="fn_879"></span>[343:4](sbe44099.htm#fr_883) Cf. V, 5, 5, 12
'that triple Veda is the thousandfold progeny of Vâ*k*.'
