Being about to offer a pap to Aditi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, he prepares it: Aditi being this (earth), he who offers Aditi's (pap) performs the sacrifice on this (earth), and by offering firmly establishes himself thereon. The sacrificial fee is a milch cow (with calf): the milch cow being this (earth), he milks out from the latter all his desires. The calf he gives away at the former (pap-offering to Aditi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_668"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>), and the mother-cow at the latter; for when a calf sucks the mother-cow, the latter gives milk when she is given away, and from her, when given away, he thus milks all his desires.</p>

And Mitra, indeed, is the in-breathing, Varu<I>n</I>a the off-breathing, and the dish of curds the food: thus when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varu<I>n</I>a, he finally establishes himself in the vital air, in food.</p>
