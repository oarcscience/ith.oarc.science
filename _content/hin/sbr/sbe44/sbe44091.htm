<P><A NAME="fn_827"></A><A HREF="sbe44091.htm#fr_831">324:1</A> The colloquy between the men and women, referred to in <a href="sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:1">paragraphs 1</A>-<a href="sbe44091.htm#13:2:9:8">8</A>, would seem to go on simultaneously. The verse addressed by the Hot<I>ri</I> to the king's discarded wife, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIII, 28, is omitted by the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, as are also the verses spoken in reply by the women (with their attendants), and closely resembling those of the men in tone and wording. According to some authorities it is the attendant women alone who reply, not the king's wives. Katy. XX, 6, 20.</P>
