### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:1">13:5:2:1</span></span>1.
Having uttered these two (verses), he pronounces what remains of the
Adhrigu. 'A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,' this is what they spread
out for the horse <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1](#fn_1006): thereon they
'quiet' (slaughter) it. When the victims have been 'quieted,' the
(king's) wives come up with water for washing the feet,--four wives; and
a young maiden as the fifth, and four hundred female attendants.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:2">13:5:2:2</span></span>2. When
the foot-water is ready, they cause the Mahishî to lie down near the
horse, and cover her up with the upper cloth, with 'In heaven ye envelop
yourselves,'--for that indeed is heaven where they immolate the victim,
. . ., 'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she
says <span id="fr_1012"></span>[2](#fn_1007) for the completeness of
union.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:3">13:5:2:3</span></span>3.
Whilst they are lying there, the Sacrificer addresses the horse (Vâ*g*.
S. XXIII, 21), 'Utsakhyâ ava guda*m* dhehi!' No one replies to him, lest
there should be some one to rival the Sacrificer.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:4">13:5:2:4</span></span>4. The
Adhvaryu then addresses the maiden, 'Hey hey maiden, that little bird .
. .'--The maiden replies to him, 'Adhvaryu! that little bird . . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:5">13:5:2:5</span></span>5. And
the Brahman addresses the Mahishî, 'Mahishî, hey hey Mahishî, thy mother
and father mount to the top of the tree . . .'--She has a hundred
daughters of kings attending upon her: these

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

reply to the Brahman, 'Brahman, hey hey Brahman, thy mother and father
play on the top of the tree. . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:6">13:5:2:6</span></span>6. And
the Udgât*ri* addresses the favourite, 'Vâvâtâ, hey hey Vâvâtâ, turn
upwards!' She has a hundred noble-women (râ*g*anyâ) attending upon her:
these reply to the Udgât*ri*, 'Hey hey Udgât*ri*, turn upwards!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:7">13:5:2:7</span></span>7. And
the Hot*ri* says to the discarded wife, 'Pariv*ri*ktâ, hey hey
Pariv*ri*ktâ, when large meets small in this a*m*hubhedî . . .'--She has
a hundred daughters of heralds and head-men of villages attending upon
her: these reply to the Hot*ri*, 'Hot*ri*, hey hey Hot*ri*, when the
gods favoured the lalâmagu . . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:8">13:5:2:8</span></span>8. Then
the chamberlain addresses the fourth wife, 'Pâlâgalî, hey hey Pâlâgalî,
when the deer eats the corn, one thinks not of the fat cattle . .
.'--She has a hundred daughters of chamberlains and charioteers
attending upon her: these reply to the chamberlain, 'Chamberlain,
hey hey chamberlain, when the deer eats the corn, one thinks not of the
fat cattle. . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:9">13:5:2:9</span></span>9.
These speeches, the derisive discourses, indeed are every kind of
attainment, and in the A*s*vamedha all objects of desire are contained:
'By every kind of speech may we obtain all objects of our desire' thus
thinking, they cause the Mahishî to rise, Those (women) then walk back
in the same way as they had come; and the others finally utter the verse
containing (the word) 'fragrant' (*Ri*g-v. IV, 39, 6), 'To Dadhikrâvan
have I sung praises. . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:10">13:5:2:10</span></span>10.
For, indeed, life and the deities depart from those who at the sacrifice
speak impure speech: it is their speech they thereby purify so that the
deities may not depart from the divine service.

<span id="page_388">p. 388</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now (some) put the
omentum of the Gom*ri*ga and that of the hornless he-goat upon the horse
and then take it (to the Âhavanîya), saying, 'The horse has no omentum.'
Let him not do so: of the horse he should certainly take the fat; the
(omenta of the) others are normal.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:11">13:5:2:11</span></span>11.
When the omenta have been roasted, and when they have performed (the
oblations) with the Svâhâs <span id="fr_1013"></span>[1](#fn_1008), and
returned to the back (of the sacrificial ground), they hold a
Brahmodya <span id="fr_1014"></span>[2](#fn_1009) (theological
discussion) in the Sadas. Having entered by the front door, they sit
down at their several hearths.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:12">13:5:2:12</span></span>12.
The Hot*ri* asks the Adhvaryu (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 45), 'Who is it that
walketh singly <span id="fr_1015"></span>[3](#fn_1010)?. . .' He replies
to him (ib. 46), 'Sûrya (the sun) walketh singly. . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:13">13:5:2:13</span></span>13.
The Adhvaryu then asks the Hot*ri* (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 47), 'Whose light
is there equal to the sun?. . .' He replies to him (ib. 48), 'The
Brahman (n.) is the light equal to the sun. . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:14">13:5:2:14</span></span>14.
The Brahman then asks the Udgât*ri* (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 49), 'I ask thee
for the sake of knowledge, O friend of the gods \[if thou hast applied
thy mind thereto: hath Vish*n*u entered the whole world at those three
places at which offering is made unto him?\]' and he replies (ib. 50),
'I too am at those three places \[at which he entered the whole world:

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

daily do I, with the one body <span id="fr_1016"></span>[1](#fn_1011),
go round the earth, the sky, and the back of yonder sky\].'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:15">13:5:2:15</span></span>15.
The Udgât*ri* then asks the Brahman (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 51), 'Into what
(things) hath the Spirit <span id="fr_1017"></span>[2](#fn_1012)
entered, \[and what (things) are established in the spirit? this, O
Brahman, we crave of thee: what answer dost thou give unto us
thereon?\]' and he replies (ib. 52), 'Into five (things) hath the spirit
entered, and they are established in the spirit: this I reply unto thee
thereon; not superior in wisdom art thou (to me).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:16">13:5:2:16</span></span>16.
When this (verse) has been uttered, they rise and betake themselves from
the Sadas eastwards to the Sacrificer. Haying come to him, seated in
front of the Havirdhâna <span id="fr_1018"></span>[3](#fn_1013) (shed),
they sit down in their several places.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:17">13:5:2:17</span></span>17.
The Hot*ri* then asks the Adhvaryu (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 53), 'What was the
first conception <span id="fr_1019"></span>[4](#fn_1014)?. . .' and he
replies (ib. 54), 'The sky was the first conception. . .'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:18">13:5:2:18</span></span>18.
The Adhvaryu then asks the Hot*ri* (ib. 55), 'Who, pray, is the tawny
one (pi*s*aṅgilâ)? \[who is the kurupi*s*aṅgilâ? who moveth in leaps?
who creepeth along the path?\]' and he replies (ib. 56), 'The tawny one
is the uncreated (night) <span id="fr_1020"></span>[5](#fn_1015); \[the
kurupi*s*aṅgilâ is the porcupine; the hare

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

moveth in leaps; the snake creepeth along the path\].'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:19">13:5:2:19</span></span>19.
The Brahman then asks the Udgât*ri* (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 57), 'How many
kinds are thereof this (sacrifice), how many syllables?--\[how many
oblations? how often is (the fire) enkindled? The ordinances of
sacrifice have I now asked of thee: how many priests offer in due
form?\]' and he replies (ib. 58), 'Six kinds there are of this
(sacrifice), a hundred syllables, \[eighty oblations, and three
kindling-sticks; the ordinances of sacrifice do I declare unto thee:
seven priests offer in due form\].'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:20">13:5:2:20</span></span>20.
The Udgât*ri* then asks the Brahman (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 59), 'Who knoweth
the navel of this world? \[who heaven and earth and the air? who knoweth
the birth-place of the great Sun? who knoweth the Moon, whence it was
born?\]' and he replies (ib. 60), 'I know the navel of this world, \[I
know heaven and earth and the air; I know the birth-place of the great
Sun, and I know the Moon, whence it was born\]'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:21">13:5:2:21</span></span>21.
The Sacrificer then asks the Adhvaryu (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 61), 'I ask thee
about the farthest end of the earth, \[I ask where is the navel of the
world; I ask thee about the seed of the vigorous steed; I ask thee about
the highest seat of speech\];' and he replies (ib. 62), 'This
altar-ground is the farthest end of the earth; \[this sacrifice is the
navel of the world; this Soma-juice is the seed of the vigorous

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

steed; this Brahman (priest) is the highest seat of speech\].'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:22">13:5:2:22</span></span>22.
Verily, this is the complete attainment of speech, to wit the Brahmodya,
and in the A*s*vamedha all desires are contained: 'By means of all
speech may we obtain all our desires!' so (they think).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:2:23">13:5:2:23</span></span>23.
When the colloquy has been held, the Adhvaryu enters the (Havirdhâna),
and draws Pra*g*âpati's (first) Mahiman cup (of Soma) in a gold vessel.
The Puroru*k* formula <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1](#fn_1016) thereof is
(Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 1; Rig-v. X, 121, 1), 'The golden germ was first
produced . . .' And its Puro<sup>ऽ</sup>nuvâkyâ is (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII,
63), 'Of good nature, self-existent at first (within the great ocean: I
verily place the right germ whence is born Pra*g*âpati).'--'May the
Hot*ri* offer to Pra*g*âpati: \[of the Mahiman Soma (cup); may he
relish, may he drink the Soma! Hot*ri*, utter the offering-formula!\]'
is the Praisha (ib. 64). The Hot*ri* utters the offering-formula (ib.
65), 'O Pra*g*âpati, none other than thee hath encompassed all these
forms <span id="fr_1022"></span>[2](#fn_1017) . . . ;' and as the
Vasha*t* is pronounced, he (the Adhvaryu) offers with (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII,
2), 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the day, and the year,
\[what greatness of thine there hath been in the wind and the air; what
greatness of thine there hath been in the heavens and the sun, to that
greatness of thine, to Pra*g*âpati, hail, to the gods <span
id="fr_1023"></span>[3](#fn_1018)!\]' He does not repeat the Vasha*t*,
for he offers the cup of Soma all at once.

one body of his (Vish*n*u's).'

<span id="fn_1012"></span>[389:2](sbe44107.htm#fr_1017) Or, man
