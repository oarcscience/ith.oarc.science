'Let them proceed (with the omenta) singly and not otherwise,' said Indrota Saunaka; 'why, indeed, should they hasten? It is in this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'

But concerning this, S&acirc;tyaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>i said, 'They may indeed do it in either way, only one must not depart from the (right) path.' But the former, indeed, is the established practice. The sacrifice (of the second day) is an Ukthya: thereby he causes the air-world to prosper. The last day is an Atir&acirc;tra with all the Stomas, for him to obtain and secure everything, for the Atir&acirc;tra with all the Stomas is everything, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is everything.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1019"></A><A HREF="sbe44108.htm#fr_1024">392:1</A> Whilst there are amongst the victims immolated on the second day, several others consecrated to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>, Indra and Agni, and Ka,--the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva, Aindr&acirc;gna, and K&acirc;ya victims, referred to in this and the following two paragraphs, belong to the K&acirc;turm&acirc;sya, or Seasonal victims, being amongst those tied to the fourteenth and sixteenth stakes. Though the text speaks only of one Vai<I>s</I>vadeva &amp;c. victim, there are really three such victims in each case. According to the views referred to in these paragraphs (cf. comm. on K&acirc;ty. XX, 7, 23), the omenta of all the preceding victims (from the 'parya&#7749;gya' onwards) up to the beginning of the K&acirc;turm&acirc;syas, would be offered together after (or along with) the vap&acirc;s of those of the respective victims (Vai<I>s</I>vadeva &amp;c.) specified in these paragraphs; and along therewith the vap&acirc;s of all the subsequent Seasonal victims. The deities to which this heap of omenta would be offered, would thus be either the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>, or Indra and Agni, or Ka, as representing all the deities. &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. S. X, 9, 7, assigns the omenta of all the victims, except the three Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya ones, to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1021"></A><A HREF="sbe44108.htm#fr_1026">393:2</A> According to this view, the omenta of all the victims after the three first (Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya) ones,--i.e. beginning from the 'parya&#7749;gya' animals (see <A HREF="sbe44084.htm#page_299">p. 299</A>, note <A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fn_755">2</A>) up to the end of the <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sya, or Seasonal victims, which are the last of the domesticated animals--would be put together in one heap and divided into twenty-one portions, which would then be offered to the first twenty-one deities of the Seasonal offerings, that is to say, to those of the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva, Varu<I>n</I>apragh&acirc;sa, S&acirc;kamedha, and Mah&acirc;havis offerings, thus omitting the deities of the Pitryesh<I>t</I>i and the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;riya offerings.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1022"></A><A HREF="sbe44108.htm#fr_1027">393:3</A> That is the first three victims, viz. the horse, the hornless he-goat, and the Gom<I>ri</I>ga.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1026"></A><A HREF="sbe44108.htm#fr_1031">394:4</A> This would be an alternative view. According to the scholl. on Katy. XX, 8, 1-3, this would seem to refer to the other Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya victims, in which case one would, however, expect the dual here, as there are only two of them besides the horse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1027"></A><A HREF="sbe44108.htm#fr_1032">395:1</A> In the same way &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. S.
