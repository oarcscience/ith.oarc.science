<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:2">12:7:2:2</A></FONT></span>2. As to this they say, 'Truly, the Soma-juice is the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a's food; and, indeed, it is not owing to Soma when a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a vomits Soma; and he who vomits Soma is one who, whilst being fit to (gain) prosperity, does not gain prosperity, and who, whilst being fit to (gain) cattle, does not gain cattle&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_571"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for Soma is cattle.'</p>

Let him seize for sacrifice that grey (he-goat) of the A<I>s</I>vins, the ram of Sarasvat&icirc;, and the bull of Indra; for the A<I>s</I>vins are the physicians of the gods, and it is by them that he heals this (Sacrificer); and Sarasvat&icirc; is healing medicine, and it is with her help that he prepares medicine for him; and Indra is energy (indriya), or vital power, and it is with his help that he bestows energy, or vital power, on this (Sacrificer).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:4">12:7:2:4</A></FONT></span>4. The two A<I>s</I>vins, indeed, are the eyesight,</p>

<p>fiery spirit; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to the A<I>s</I>vins, he (the priest) bestows eyesight, fiery spirit, on this (Sacrificer). And the ear also (he thereby bestows on him), for one and the same are the eye and the ear.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:5">12:7:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Sarasvat&icirc; is the breath, vital power; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to Sarasvat&icirc;, he bestows breath, vital power, on this (Sacrificer). And the off-breathing also (he thereby bestows on him), for one and the same are the breath (of the mouth) and the of breathing.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:6">12:7:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. Indra is speech, strength; and inasmuch as there is (a victim) sacred to Indra, he bestows speech, strength, on this (Sacrificer); and mind also, for one and the same are speech and mind.</p>

'He-goats are sacred to the A<I>s</I>vins, ewes to Sarasvat&icirc;, and cows (and bulls) to Indra,' they say: if these animals are sacrificed, he, by means of those deities, gains those (three) animals.</p>

There are grains of rice and grains of millet, grains of wheat and kuvala jujubes, Indra-grain and badara jujubes, grains of barley and karkandhu jujubes, malted rice and barley&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_575"></A><A HREF="#fn_573"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: both cultivated and wild-grain food he thereby secures; and by means of both kinds of food he duly lays energy and vital power into his own self.</p>

With lead he buys&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_576"></A><A HREF="#fn_574"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the malted rice, with (sheep's) wool the malted barley, with thread the (fried) rice-grain,--that lead is a form of both iron and gold, and the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is both an ish<I>t</I>i-offering and an animal sacrifice, so that he thereby secures both of these.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:11">12:7:2:11</A></FONT></span>11. With wool and thread&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_575"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> he buys,--this, to wit, wool and thread, is women's work; and work, indeed, means energy, or vital power, and this latter is extinct in women: he thus secures (for the Sacrificer) that energy, or vital power, which is extinct in women.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:12">12:7:2:12</A></FONT></span>12. Here now, other Adhvaryus buy the malted rice with lead from a eunuch, saying, 'That is that&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_578"></A><A HREF="#fn_576"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; for the eunuch is neither woman nor man, and the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is neither an ish<I>t</I>i-offering nor an animal sacrifice.' But let him not do so, for the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is both an ish<I>t</I>i and an animal sacrifice, and the eunuch is something unsuccessful among men: they who do this thus place failure into the very mouth (opening) of the sacrifice. Let him rather buy them from a vendor of Soma, for the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is Soma: he thus puts a form of Soma into the very mouth of the sacrifice so as to secure the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:13">12:7:2:13</A></FONT></span>13. There is a pot (kumbh&icirc;) perforated with a hundred holes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_579"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for in many ways did that (Soma) flow out of (Indra); and a hundred-sized also, indeed, is the sacrifice: it is the sacrifice he thereby secures. There is a bowl (rata&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_580"></A><A HREF="#fn_578"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>): it is the real (or good) thing (sat) he thereby secures. There is a dish (<I>k</I>apya) for him to secure food. There is a filter, for they cleanse him, (the Sacrificer, by this offering). There is a tail (-whisk) for turning away evil. There is gold for him to secure form (or colour); it weighs a hundred (grains), for man has a life of a hundred (years) and a hundred energies: life, and energy, vital power, he thus lays into his own self.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:14">12:7:2:14</A></FONT></span>14. There is an a<I>s</I>vattha (ficus religiosa) vessel: honour he thereby secures. There is an udumbara (ficus glomerata) one: force he thereby secures. There is a nyagrodha (ficus indica) one: sweet drink he thereby secures. There are (earthen) pots (sth&acirc;l&icirc;): the food of the earth he thereby secures.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:15">12:7:2:15</A></FONT></span>15. There are supernumerary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_581"></A><A HREF="#fn_579"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (vessels) of pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_221"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 221</FONT></A></p>  
<p>wood: the pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a (butea frondosa) is the Brahman (holy writ, holiness, the priesthood): it is by the Brahman that he gains the heavenly world. There are two feathers of a talon-slaying (bird)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_582"></A><A HREF="#fn_580"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: courage, the sway of birds, he thereby secures. There are thirty-six of these (objects), for the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; consists of thirty-six syllables, and cattle are related to the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;: by means of the B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; he thus secures cattle for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:16">12:7:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. As to this they say, 'The victims have one set of deities, and the cakes another set of deities: this is an improper performance&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_583"></A><A HREF="#fn_581"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; how does it become right and proper?' To Indra belongs the last of the victims, and to Indra the first of the cakes; and Indra, indeed, is energy (indriya), or vital power: through (Indra's) energy he thus confers on him energy, or vital power; and through (Indra's) energy he secures energy, or vital power.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:17">12:7:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. There is a cake to Savit<I>ri</I> for him to become impelled by Savit<I>ri</I>; and one to Varu<I>n</I>a, for it is Varu<I>n</I>a that seizes him who is seized by evil: through Varu<I>n</I>a he thus delivers him from Varu<I>n</I>a's power;--it is the final (cake): he thus delivers him finally from Varu<I>n</I>a's noose.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:18">12:7:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. Indra's (cake) is one on eleven potsherds, in order that he may secure (Indra's) energy, or vital</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_222"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 222</FONT></A></p>  
<p>power; for the Trish<I>t</I>ubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trish<I>t</I>ubh is energy, or vital power.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:19">12:7:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. Savit<I>ri</I>'s (cake) is one on twelve potsherds, for there are twelve months in the year, and the year means constantly existing food: from the year he thus secures for hire food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:20">12:7:2:20</A></FONT></span>20. Varu<I>n</I>a's (cake) is one on ten potsherds, for the Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> consists of ten syllables, and Varu<I>n</I>a is Vir&acirc;<I>g</I> (the widely ruling), the lord of food: through Varu<I>n</I>a he thus secures food for him. In the middle (of the sacrifice) they proceed with (the offering of) these cakes, for the centre means their (mother's) womb: he thus causes them to be produced from their own (mother's) womb.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:7:2:21">12:7:2:21</A></FONT></span>21. A mare with a foal is the sacrificial fee, for such a (mare) produces both the horse and the mule, and the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is both an ish<I>t</I>i-offering and an animal sacrifice: thus it is so in order that he may secure both of these.</p>
