Prior to the Vishuvat they perform first the Abhiplava, and afterwards the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya, for the Abhiplava represents the sons, and the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya the father; whence in early life the sons subsist on (the resources of) their father. Subsequent to the Vishuvat they perform first the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya, and afterwards the Abhiplava; whence in later life the father subsists on (the resources of) his sons; and, verily, the sons of him who thus knows this subsist on him in early life, and he subsists on his sons in later life.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:3:6">12:2:3:6</A></FONT></span>6. As to this they ask, 'Seeing that there are the twelve months of the year, and that one day, to wit, the Vishuvat, is in excess, does this belong to those (months) that go before or to those that follow?' Let him say, 'Both to those that go before and to those that follow;' for the Vishuvat is the body (trunk) of the year, and the months are its limbs; and where the body is there are (or, that includes) also the limbs, and where the limbs are there is also the body; and neither is the body in excess of the limbs, nor are the limbs in excess of the body: and thus, indeed, that (day) belongs both to those (months) that go before and to those that follow.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:3:7">12:2:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. But, indeed, that year is a great eagle: the six months which they perform prior to the Vishuvat are the one wing, and those which they perform subsequent thereto are the other; and the Vishuvat is the body; and, indeed, where the body is there are also the wings, and where the wings are there is also the body; for neither is the body in excess of the wings, nor are the wings in excess of the body: and thus, indeed, that (day) belongs both to those (months) that go before and to those that follow.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> (Stomas), how are these latter performed so as to tend upwards?' Let him say, 'In that they perform that Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra as one with upward tending Stomas, thereby they do so.' Now, the Mah&acirc;vrata did not yield itself to the gods saying, 'How is it, ye have performed the Vishuvat with upward tending hymns, and me with reversed ones?'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:3:9">12:2:3:9</A></FONT></span>9. The gods said, 'Try ye to find out that sacrificial performance which has upward tending Stomas, and whereby we may gain this.' They saw that Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra with upward tending Stomas after the manner of the year: what P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha there is in it that is the seasons, the (three) <I>Kh</I>andomas are these worlds, and the tenth day is the year. Thereby they gained this (Mah&acirc;vrata), and it yielded itself to them; and, verily, the Mah&acirc;vrata yields itself to him who so knows this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:3:10">12:2:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. And in this way, indeed, there is an ascent of days:--by means of the Opening Atir&acirc;tra they ascend the concluding Atir&acirc;tra, by means of the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a the Mah&acirc;vrata, by means of an Abhiplava a subsequent Abhiplava, by means of a P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya a subsequent P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya, by means of the Abhi<I>g</I>it the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it, by means of the Svaras&acirc;mans the subsequent Svaras&acirc;mans--but that one day is not ascended, to wit, the Vishuvat: and, verily, he who thus knows this ascends to (the state of) one more glorious, and no one inferior to him ascends (to be equal) to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:3:11">12:2:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. And in this way, indeed, there is a descent of days:--the Pr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;ya Atir&acirc;tra descends to the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day, the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day to the Abhiplava, the Abhiplava to the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya, the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya to the Abhi<I>g</I>it, the Abhi<I>g</I>it to the Svaras&acirc;mans, the</p>

Such, indeed, are the wilds and ravines of sacrifice, and they (take) hundreds upon hundreds of days&#8217; carriage-drives; and if any venture into them without knowledge, then hunger or thirst, evil-doers and fiends harass them, even as fiends would harass foolish men wandering in a wild forest; but if those who know this do so, they pass from one duty to another, as from one stream into another, and from one safe place to another, and obtain well-being, the world of heaven.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:2:3:13">12:2:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. As to this they say, 'How many onward, and how many backward days are there?' Well, those which are performed once each are onward days, and those which are performed repeatedly are backward days: let him at least consider these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_472"></A><A HREF="#fn_472"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as backward ones, for in accordance with the course of the Sha<I>d</I>ahas he himself moves.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_467"></A><A HREF="sbe44051.htm#fr_467">155:2</A> The term '&acirc;rkshyat' is apparently a future participle of '&acirc;-ar<I>g</I>,<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> <A NAME="page_156"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 156</FONT></A> hence 'calculated to procure, or win.' The Ait.-Br. has '&acirc;kshyat' instead. The two Sha<I>d</I>ahas (or periods of six days), here counted as such days, would seem to include the six Svaras&acirc;man days, and the special named days scattered over the session (the opening and concluding Atir&acirc;tra being apparently counted as one).</P>

The one usually denoted by that term is the second day of the Gav&acirc;m ayanam. In the Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra, or ten-days&#8217; period, there is, however, likewise a day in which the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a-stoma is used exclusively. That period consists of a P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha (six days), three <I>Kh</I>andoma days, and a final Atyagnish<I>t</I>oma, called Aviv&acirc;kya. The three <I>Kh</I>andoma days (i.e. days fashioned after metres) have assigned to them as their exclusive Stomas the twenty-four-fold, the forty-four-fold, and the forty-eight-fold hymn-forms respectively; the first of them, or the seventh day of the Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra, being thus a <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day. But in the second half of the year's session the regular order of the days of the minor sacrificial periods--the Sha<I>d</I>ahas and Svaras&acirc;mans--is reversed, the last day being performed first; and according to this paragraph the same is optionally to be the case in regard to the three <I>Kh</I>andoma days, the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day being taken either first or last (see, however, parag. 9). Cf. also Haug, Ait.-Br., Transl., p. 347, note (where, in l. 3, read Da<I>s</I>ar&acirc;tra instead of Dv&acirc;da<I>s</I>&acirc;ha).</P>
