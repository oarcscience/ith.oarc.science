Then Soma<I>s</I>ushma S&acirc;tyaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>i said, 'I, O king, make offering to light in light.'--'How is that?' asked the king.--'Well, &Acirc;ditya is light: to him I make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is light: to him I make offering in &Acirc;ditya in the morning.'--'What becomes of him who offers in this way?

Then Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said, 'When I take out the fire (from the G&acirc;rhapatya), it is the Agnihotra itself, I thereby raise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_354"></A><A HREF="#fn_354"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Now when &Acirc;ditya (the sun) sets, all the gods follow him; and when they see that fire taken out by me, they turn back. Having then cleansed the (sacrificial) vessels, and deposited them (on the Vedi), and having milked the Agnihotra cow, I gladden them, when I see them, and when they see me.'--'Thou, O Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, hast inquired most closely into the nature of the Agnihotra,' said the king; 'I bestow a hundred cows on thee. But not even thou (knowest) either the uprising, or the progress, or the support, or the contentment, or the return, or the renascent world of those two (libations of the Agnihotra).' Thus saying, he mounted his car and drove away.</p>

<p>a theological disputation!' Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya said, 'We are Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, and he is a R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya: if we were to vanquish him, whom should we say we had vanquished? But if he were to vanquish us, people would say of us that a R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya had vanquished Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as: do not think of this!' They approved of his words. But Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, mounting his car, drove after (the king). He overtook him, and he (the king) said, 'Is it to know the Agnihotra, Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya?'--'The Agnihotra, O king!' he replied.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:6:2:9">11:6:2:9</A></FONT></span>9. &#8216;They enter man, and make his mouth their offering-fire, his tongue their fuel, and food their pure libation: they satiate man; and, verily, for him who, knowing this, eats food the Agnihotra comes to be offered. They rise upwards from there.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:6:2:10">11:6:2:10</A></FONT></span>10. 'They enter woman, and make her lap their offering-fire, her womb the fuel,--for that (womb) is called the bearer, because by it Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati bore creatures,--and the seed their pure libation: they satiate woman; and, verily, for him who, knowing this, approaches his mate, the Agnihotra comes to</p>

<p>be offered. The son who is born therefrom is the renascent world: this is the Agnihotra, Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya, there is nothing higher than this.' Thus he spoke; and Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya granted him a boon. He said, 'Let mine be the (privilege of) asking questions of thee when I list, Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya!' Thenceforth <I>G</I>anaka was a Brahman.</p>
