Now, Dush<I>t</I>ar&icirc;tu Pau<I>m</I>s&acirc;yana had been expelled from the kingdom which had come down to him through ten generations; and the S<I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ayas also expelled Revottaras P&acirc;<I>t</I>ava K&acirc;kra Sthapati.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:2">12:9:3:2</A></FONT></span>2. He said to Dush<I>t</I>ar&icirc;tu Pau<I>m</I>s&acirc;yana, 'I will perform the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; for thee, and will comer upon thee that dominion over the S<I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ayas.'--'So be it!' he replied. So he performed it for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:3">12:9:3:3</A></FONT></span>3. Now Balhika Pr&acirc;tip&icirc;ya, the Kauravya king, heard (people say) this--'There is that Dush<I>t</I>ar&icirc;tu Pau<I>m</I>s&acirc;yana who has been expelled from the kingdom which has come down to him through ten generations: for him that <I>K</I>&acirc;kra Sthapati wants to perform the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; and to confer upon him the dominion over the S<I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ayas.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:4">12:9:3:4</A></FONT></span>4. He said, 'I will just tell him that if he wants to confer dominion upon him, he will indeed exclude him from dominion.' He came to him at that particular time (of the sacrifice) when the cups (of milk and liquor) are drawn.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:5">12:9:3:5</A></FONT></span>5. He said, 'Sthapati <I>K</I>&acirc;kra, they say, Sur&acirc;-liquor must not be offered in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya-fire, nor anywhere else than in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya: if thou offerest</p>

He replied, 'I shall not offer Sur&acirc;-liquor in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya nor anywhere else than in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya thus I shall not cause social confusion nor a repetition in the sacrifice, and shall not exclude him from dominion; I shall place him in dominion, and shall confer dominion upon him.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:7">12:9:3:7</A></FONT></span>7. He said, 'How, then, wilt thou do it?' He then told him this:--At first, indeed, that Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (sacrifice, m.), the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, was with the Asuras. He went forth towards the gods. He came to the waters, and the waters welcomed him, whence people welcome a better man when he comes to them. They said to him, 'We pray thee, come, reverend sir!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:8">12:9:3:8</A></FONT></span>8. He said, 'Nay, I am afraid: lead ye me forward!'--'Whereof art thou afraid, reverend sir?' they asked.--'Of the Asuras,' he said.--'Be it, then!' they said. The waters led him forward, whence he who is the protector leads forward him who is afraid; and inasmuch as the waters led him forward (pra-<I>n</I>&icirc;) therefore the waters (themselves) are 'led forward:' this is the reason why they are (called) Pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;<I>h</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_670"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; and, verily, firmly established is he who thus knows that nature of the Pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;<I>h</I>.</p>

Now, the fore-offerings had been performed, but the fire had not been carried round&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (the oblations), when the Asuras came after him. By means of the circumambient fire the gods shut out their hostile rivals, the Asuras, from Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a (the sacrifice); and in like manner does this one now, by means of the circumambient fire, shut out his spiteful enemy from the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:10">12:9:3:10</A></FONT></span>10. Verily, that &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya is the womb (seat) of the gods, and those two fires&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_676"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on either side thereof are its immortal wings: thus, when they perform the sacrifice on the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, they indeed perform the sacrifice for the gods in the womb of the gods; and, verily, the continued sacrifice inclines to him, and the sacrifice is not cut off from him who thus knows this, or for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite is performed.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:11">12:9:3:11</A></FONT></span>11. On the northern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of milk, on the northern fire they cook the sacrificial animals: the sacrificial animals, whilst being mortal, he thus places in the immortal womb, and them that are mortal he causes to be born (again) from out of the immortal womb; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this, or he for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite is performed, wards off the recurring death of his cattle, and the sacrifice is not cut off from him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:12">12:9:3:12</A></FONT></span>12. On the southern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of Sur&acirc;-liquor, near the southern fire</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_272"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 272</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they purify (the liquor) with triple strainers: the Fathers, whilst being mortal, he thus places in the immortal womb, and them that are mortal he causes to be born (again) from out of the immortal womb; and, verily, whosoever thus knows this, or he for whom, knowing this, this sacrificial rite is performed, wards off the recurring death of the Fathers, and the sacrifice is not cut off from him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:13">12:9:3:13</A></FONT></span>13. Now, inasmuch as these two fires are taken from the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, they are &Acirc;havan&icirc;yas (offering-fires), and inasmuch as they do not again reach the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, they are not &Acirc;havan&icirc;yas: he thereby obtains both kinds of oblations, that -which is (offered) on the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, and that which is (offered) on what is not an &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya--both what is offered and what is not offered.</p>  
<p>He (Balhika Pr&acirc;tip&icirc;ya) then went home, and said, 'It is not so (as we had thought): that kingdom of the S<I>ri</I><I>&ntilde;</I><I>g</I>ayas now belongs to Dush<I>t</I>ar&icirc;tu;--in. such and such a manner has that <I>K</I>&acirc;kra Sthapati this day performed at the sacrifice.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:14">12:9:3:14</A></FONT></span>14. On the northern fire they thus perform the rites of the sacrificial animals, the (animal) cakes, and <I>th</I>e cups of milk, and what other (rite) there is: it is the gods, in the world of the gods, he thereby gratifies, and, thus gratified, they gratify him, and he wins the world of the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:9:3:15">12:9:3:15</A></FONT></span>15. In the southern fire they offer (libations from) the cups of Sur&acirc;-liquor, near the southern fire they purify (the liquor) with triple strainers: it is the Fathers, in the world of the Fathers, he thereby gratifies, and, thus gratified, they gratify him, and he wins the world of the Fathers.</p>

And as the sacrificial animal, so the sacrificial stake; and inasmuch as there are those two stakes on both sides of the stake of the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; (bull of Indra), therefore these two arms are on both sides of the body&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>
