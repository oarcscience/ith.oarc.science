### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:4:1">13:1:4:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati poured forth the life-sap of the horse (a*s*va-medha) <span
id="fr_714"></span>[1](#fn_710). When poured forth, it went straight
away from him and spread itself over the regions. The gods went in quest
of it. By means of offerings (ish*t*i) they followed it up, by offerings
they searched for it, and by offerings they found it. And when he
performs ish*t*is, the Sacrificer thereby searches for the horse
(a*s*va) meet for sacrifice <span id="fr_715"></span>[2](#fn_711)
(medhya).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:4:2">13:1:4:2</span></span>2. They
(the ish*t*is <span id="fr_716"></span>[3](#fn_712)) belong to
Savit*ri*; for Savit*ri* is this (earth): if any one hides himself
thereon, if any one goes elsewhere <span
id="fr_717"></span>[4](#fn_713), it is on this

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (earth) that they
find him; for no one (creature), whether walking erect or horizontally
(like an animal), is able to go beyond it. Their belonging to Savit*ri*
thus is in order to find the horse.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:4:3">13:1:4:3</span></span>3.
Concerning this they say, 'Surely the horse disappears when it goes
straight away; for they do not turn (drive) it back <span
id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_714).' Now when he performs the Dh*ri*ti
offerings <span id="fr_719"></span>[2](#fn_715) in the evening--dh*ri*ti
(keeping) meaning peaceful dwelling, and the night also meaning peaceful
dwelling--it is by means of peaceful dwelling that he keeps it; whence
both men and beasts rest peacefully at night. And when he performs
offerings in the morning, he seeks that (horse); whence it is in daytime
that one goes to seek for what is lost. And again when he offers the
Dh*ri*tis in the evening, and the (Savit*ri*) ish*t*is in the morning,
it is security of possession the Sacrificer thereby brings about, whence
security of possession is brought about for the subjects where this
sacrifice is performed.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_710"></span>[284:1](sbe44077.htm#fr_714) Or, as it might
also be translated. Pra*g*âpati produced (created) the A*s*vamedha.

<span id="fn_711"></span>[284:2](sbe44077.htm#fr_715) Or, for the horse
full of life-sap; or, simply, the sacrificial horse.

<span id="fn_712"></span>[284:3](sbe44077.htm#fr_716) Viz. three
oblations of cakes on twelve kapâlas to Savit*ri* Prasavit*ri*,
Savit*ri* Âsavit*ri*; and Savit*ri* Satyaprasava respectively. For
particulars see [XIII, 4, 2, 6](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:6) seqq.

<span id="fn_713"></span>[284:4](sbe44077.htm#fr_717) Harisvâmin seems
to take this in the sense of 'who moves about elsewhere (in another
sphere),' and mentions, as an instance, a bird which flies in (? up
into) the air--pakshyâdir antarikshe ga*kkh*ati--but is ultimately
caught on earth.

<span id="fn_714"></span>[285:1](sbe44077.htm#fr_718) See [XIII, 4, 2,
16](sbe44103.htm#13:4:2:16).

<span id="fn_715"></span>[285:2](sbe44077.htm#fr_719) The four Dh*ri*tis
are performed on the Âhavanîya after sunset on the first day; cf. [XIII,
4, 3, 5](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:5). For the four formulas used with these
oblations ('here is joy,' &c.), see [XIII, 1, 6,
2](sbe44079.htm#13:1:6:2).
