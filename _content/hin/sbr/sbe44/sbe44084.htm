'How is he to appease&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_769"></A><A HREF="#fn_765"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> these?' they ask. 'Let him appease them with the B&acirc;rhaduktha verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_770"></A><A HREF="#fn_766"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, "Enkindled, anointing the lap of the faithful(f.) . . .;" for B<I>ri</I>haduktha, the son of V&acirc;madeva, or A<I>s</I>va, son of Samudra, saw these very (verses) to be the &acirc;pr&icirc;-verses of the horse: it is by means of these we appease it,' so they say. But let him not do so; let him appease it with the <I>G</I>&acirc;madagna verses; for <I>G</I>amadagni is Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, and so is the A<I>s</I>vamedha: he thus supplies it with its own deity; let him therefore appease (the victims) with the <I>G</I>&acirc;madagna verses&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_771"></A><A HREF="#fn_767"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>.</p>

Now some make the invitatory-formulas and the offering-formulas (to be pronounced) separately for the 'parya&#7749;gyas,' saying, 'For these we find (formulas)--for the others, on account of not finding any, we do not use them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_772"></A><A HREF="#fn_768"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>.'

<p>for the horse is the nobility (chieftain), and the other animals are the peasantry (clan); and those who do this really make the peasantry equal and refractory to the nobility; and they also deprive the Sacrificer of his vital power. Therefore the horse alone belongs to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_773"></A><A HREF="#fn_769"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the others are sacred to the gods: he thus, indeed, makes the peasantry obedient and subservient to the nobility; and he also supplies the Sacrificer with vital power.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:2:2:16">13:2:2:16</A></FONT></span>16. The slaughtering-knife of the horse is made of gold, those of the 'parya&#7749;gyas' of copper, and those of the others of iron; for gold is (shining) light, and the A<I>s</I>vamedha is the royal office: he thus bestows light upon the royal office. And by means of the golden light (or, by the light of the gold), the Sacrificer also goes to the heavenly world; and he, moreover, makes it a gleam of light shining after him, for him to reach the heavenly world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:2:2:17">13:2:2:17</A></FONT></span>17. But, indeed, the horse is also the nobility; and this also--to wit, gold--is a form (symbol) of</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_304"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 304</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the nobility: he thus combines the nobility with the nobility.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:2:2:18">13:2:2:18</A></FONT></span>18. And as to why there are copper (knives) for the 'parya&#7749;gyas,'--even as the non-royal kingmakers, the heralds and headmen, are to the king, so those 'parya&#7749;gyas' are to the horse; and so, indeed, is this--to wit, copper--to gold: with their own form he thus endows them.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:2:2:19">13:2:2:19</A></FONT></span>19. And as to why there are iron ones for the others,--the other animals, indeed, are the peasantry, and this--to wit, iron--is a form of the peasantry: he thus combines the peasantry with the peasantry. On a rattan mat (lying) north (of the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya) they cut the portions of the horse(-flesh); for the horse is of anush<I>t</I>ubh nature, and related to the Anush<I>t</I>ubh is that (northern) quarter: he thus places that (horse) in its own quarter. And as to (his doing so) on a rattan mat,--the horse was produced from the womb of the waters&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_774"></A><A HREF="#fn_770"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the rattan springs from the water: he thus causes it to be possessed of its own (maternal) womb.</p>

Possibly, however, the 'iti' may be used here with a kind of 'deiktic' force (cf. the similar use in <a href="sbe44090.htm#13:2:8:1">XIII, 2, 8, 1</A>); if, indeed, it does not simply refer to 'gom<I>ri</I>ga,' i.e. 'the animal called Gom<I>ri</I>ga.' (lit. 'bovine deer'), regarding which see note on <a href="sbe44097.htm#13:3:4:3">XIII, 3, 4, 3</A>.--Though the victims to be immolated on this day are first dealt with in this and the following Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, their slaughter only takes place at the usual time at every Soma-sacrifice, viz. after the Sarpa<I>n</I>am (<a href="sbe44085.htm#13:2:3:1">XIII, 2, 3, 1</A> seqq.), the chanting of the Bahishpavam&acirc;na Stotra, and the drawing of the &Acirc;<I>s</I>vina-graha. On the present occasion these ceremonies are preceded by the drawing of the Mahiman cups of Soma (see <a href="sbe44093.htm#13:2:11:1">XIII, 2, 11, 1</A> seqq.); whilst the chant is followed by the driving up of the victims, and the putting to of the horse, and the driving to the water, treated of in <a href="sbe44088.htm#13:2:6:1">XIII, 2, 6, 1</A> seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_754"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_758">299:1</A> Harisv&acirc;min takes this to mean that he makes the (sacrificial) horse, i.e. the king, alone the head of the army,--r&acirc;<I>g</I>abh&ucirc;tam apy a<I>s</I>va<I>m</I> sen&acirc;mukham eka<I>m</I> karot&icirc;ty artha<I>h</I>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_755"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_759">299:2</A> According to the comments on V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIV, 1, and K&acirc;ty. XX, 6, 4, a rope is wound round the horse's body in the same way as it is done with a bottle-gourd (lagenaria vulgaris), and it is to this rope that these so-called 'parya&#7749;gy&acirc;h (circumcorporal),' or victims surrounding the (horse's) body, would then be tied.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_756"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_760">299:3</A> The commentator explains 'bh&acirc;vuka' by 's&acirc;dhur bhavati;' and he adds that this is important inasmuch as numerous magic rites, such as rites for insuring success and averting evil (<I>s</I>&acirc;ntikapaush<I>t</I>ika), and incantations (&acirc;bhi<I>k</I>&acirc;rika) are performed thereon. It is the name here assigned to this, the &Acirc;vasathya, fire, viz. 'p&ucirc;rv&acirc;gni' or, original fire--with its secondary meaning 'front-fire'--which is seized upon by the author for symbolically identifying it with the victim fastened in front (or to the front) of the horse.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_757"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_761">300:1</A> Mah&icirc;dhara takes 'adhor&acirc;ma' to mean 'white-coloured on the lower part of the body.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_758"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_762">300:2</A> The word 'b&acirc;hu' means both 'arm' and 'front leg.'</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_761"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_765">301:1</A> Viz. inasmuch as the sacrificial stake to which the horse is tied (and hence the victims fastened thereto) is the so-called 'agnish<I>th</I>a' stake, or the one standing opposite to (directly in front of) the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_762"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_766">301:2</A> Viz. inasmuch as these other stakes stand in a line to the north (left) and south (right) of the central stake. Whilst, in the case of a simple 'ek&acirc;da<I>s</I>in&icirc;' (cf. III, 7, 2, 1 seqq.) there would be five stakes on each side of the central one, at the A<I>s</I>vamedha there are to be twenty-one stakes, or ten on either side of the central stake. See <a href="sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:5">XIII, 4, 4, 5</A> seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_763"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_767">301:3</A> These seventeen victims do not include the twelve parya&#7749;gyas which are tied to different parts of the horse's body, but only to those which are actually tied to the central stake,--viz. the horse and its two immediate neighbours (paragraph 2), then twelve victims (enumerated V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXIV, 2, beginning with three victims of different shades of red, rohita), and lastly two beasts belonging to two sets of eleven victims finally superadded to the sets of fifteen victims tied in the first place to the stakes.

<P><A NAME="fn_768"></A><A HREF="sbe44084.htm#fr_772">302:5</A> The commentator takes this to mean that, inasmuch as these parya&#7749;gyas--here improperly including the horse itself and the two other victims of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati at the central stake--are assigned to commonly invoked deities, formulas relating to these would easily <A NAME="page_303"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 303</FONT></A> be found; whilst in the case of the other twelve victims tied to the central stake (see <A HREF="#page_301">p. 301</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_763">3</A>), as well as those of the other stakes--though they, too, are assigned to definite deities--some of their deities (as in the case of three a year and a half old heifers assigned to G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, V&acirc;<I>g</I>.
