### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:1">12:4:3:1</span></span>1. They
also say, 'If the fire were to go out after the first libation has been
offered, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?'
Having thrown down (on the fire-place) any log of wood he may find lying
near by <span id="fr_521"></span>[1](#fn_521), let him offer thereon,
saying, 'In every (piece of) wood there is a fire,' for, indeed, there
is a fire in every (piece of) wood. But if his heart should at all
misgive him, he may offer upon gold; for gold, doubtless, is Agni's
seed; and the father is the same as the son, and the son is the same as
the father: he may therefore offer upon gold. This, then, is the rite
performed in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:2">12:4:3:2</span></span>2. They
also say, 'If, after being taken out (from the Gârhapatya), the
Âhavanîya were to go out

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

before the Agnihotra (has been offered), what rite and what expiation
would there be in that case?' Let him take it out (again) from the
Gârhapatya (and bring it) forward, and, having laid it down (on the
Âhavanîya hearth), let him offer the Agnihotra thereon. And were it to
go out again and again, after being taken out even a hundred times, let
him take it out (again) from the Gârhapatya, and, having laid it down,
let him offer the Agnihotra thereon. This, then, is the rite performed
in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:3">12:4:3:3</span></span>3. They
also say, 'If the Gârhapatya were to go out, what rite and what
expiation would there be in that case?' Well, some churn it out from a
firebrand, saying, 'Whereby man's (body) is destroyed in the end, it is
therefrom he desires the expiation of this (mishap).' Let him, however,
not do this; but let them proceed by taking either a firebrand, or a
piece from a firebrand;--let him do it in this way:--having taken a coal
from a firebrand, let him crumble it on the two churning-sticks, for (in
this way) he obtains both that desire which is contained in the (fire)
churned out of a firebrand, and that which is contained in (the fire
churned out from) the churning-sticks. This, then, is the rite performed
in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:4">12:4:3:4</span></span>4. They
also say, 'If they take out fire for any one and put it with (the
burning Âhavanîya) fire, what rite and what expiation would there be in
that case?' When uniting, these two (fires), if unappeased, would indeed
be liable to burn up the Sacrificer's family and cattle: let him
therefore utter upon them the text (Vâ*g*. S. XII, 57, 58), 'Unite ye
two, and get ye on together, loving, radiant, well disposed, dwelling
together for food and drink!--Together have I brought

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

your minds, together your rites, together your thoughts: O Agni
Purîshya, be thou the overlord, and bestow thou food and drink upon our
Sacrificer!' He thereby bespeaks peace on the part of those two for the
safety of the Sacrificer's family and cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:5">12:4:3:5</span></span>5. But
if his heart should at all misgive him, let him prepare a cake on eight
potsherds to Agni Agnimat (the fire possessed of a fire). The course of
procedure thereof (is as follows):--he should recite seventeen
kindling-verses; the two butter-portions relate to the slaying of
V*ri*tra <span id="fr_522"></span>[1](#fn_522); the sa*m*yâ*g*yâs <span
id="fr_523"></span>[2](#fn_523) are two Virâ*g* verses; and the
invitatory and offering formulas (of the chief oblation) are as
follows:--(the anuvâkyâ, *Ri*g-veda S. I, 12, 6), 'Agni is kindled by
Agni, he, the sage, the youthful house-lord, the tongue-mouthed bearer
of oblations;' and the yâ*g*yâ, 'For thou, O Agni, art kindled by Agni,
priest, as thou art, by a priest, friend by friend.' He thereby bespeaks
peace on the part of those two, for the safety of the Sacrificer's
family and cattle. This, then, is the rite performed in that case.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:6">12:4:3:6</span></span>6. They
also say, 'If any one's Gârhapatya were to go out when the Âhavanîya has
not gone out, what rite and what expiation would there be in that case?'
Now, some take (a new fire) out from that same (Âhavanîya hearth, and
carry it) forwards <span id="fr_524"></span>[3](#fn_524),

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

saying, 'The fires are the vital airs: it is the vital airs we thus take
up for him.' But let him not do this, for if, in that case, any one were
to say of him, 'Surely this one has obstructed the forward vital
airs <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_525): this Sacrificer will die,'
then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:7">12:4:3:7</span></span>7. And
some, indeed, take (the Âhavanîya) back (to the Gârhapatya <span
id="fr_526"></span>[2](#fn_526)), saying, 'These two are the
out-breathing and the up-breathing.' But let him not do this; for
conducive to heaven, indeed, is the Agnihotra; and if, in that case, any
one were to say of him, 'Surely, this one has descended again from the
heavenly world: this (offering) will be in no wise conducive to heaven
for him,' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:8">12:4:3:8</span></span>8. And
some, indeed, churn out another Gârhapatya; but let him not do this, for
if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this one has
raised a spiteful enemy from out of the fire <span
id="fr_527"></span>[3](#fn_527): speedily a spiteful enemy will be
raised to him; he (the Sacrificer) will weep <span
id="fr_528"></span>[4](#fn_528) for him who is dearest to him,' then
that would indeed be likely to come to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:9">12:4:3:9</span></span>9. And
some, again, extinguish (the Âhavanîya fire) and churn out another;--let
him not yield to a desire for this; (for if, in that case, any one were
to

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

say of him <span id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_529)), 'He has caused to be
extinguished even what was left him: no heir will remain to him,' then
that would indeed be likely to come to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:4:3:10">12:4:3:10</span></span>10.
Let him rather proceed thus:--having lifted the two fires on the two
churning-sticks <span id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_530), let him betake
himself northwards, and, having churned out (the fire), let him remain
there offering; for in this way he passes no censure on any one, and
towards night offering is made by him at his new resting-place.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[189:1](sbe44060.htm#fr_522) That is, their
Anuvâkyâs refer to V*ri*trahan.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[189:2](sbe44060.htm#fr_523) That is, the
anuvâkyâ (invitatory formula) and yâ*g*yâ (offering-formula) recited for
the oblation to Agni Svish*t*ak*ri*t. Cf. [XIII, 4, 1,
13](sbe44102.htm#13:4:1:13) note.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[189:3](sbe44060.htm#fr_524) That is to say,
they make the still burning Âhavanîya their Gârhapatya and take out a
new offering-fire which they lay down on a place to the eastward of the
former Âhavanîya (the former <span id="page_190">p. 190</span>
Dakshi*n*âgni being likewise transferred to a place south of the first
third of the line between the new Gârhapatya and Âhavanîya, Katy. XXV,
3, 5 comm.).

<span id="fn_525"></span>[190:1](sbe44060.htm#fr_525) ? Or, has forced
them forward.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[190:2](sbe44060.htm#fr_526) That is, they take
the burning Âhavanîya fire back to the Gârhapatya hearth, and then take
out therefrom a fresh Âhavanîya.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[190:3](sbe44060.htm#fr_527) Viz. inasmuch as
he takes out a new Âhavanîya from the newly kindled Gârhapatya, and puts
it on the still burning Âhavanîya fire.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[191:1](sbe44060.htm#fr_529) There seems here
to be an omission in the printed text, though MS. Ind. Off. 311, it is
true, has the same reading.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[191:2](sbe44060.htm#fr_530) That is, by
holding the sticks a moment near the fires.
