### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:1">13:1:3:1</span></span>1. Even
as some of the havis (offering-material) may be spilled before it is
offered, so also (part) of the victim is here spilled in that they let
loose the sprinkled (horse) before it is slain. When he offers the
Stokîyâs (oblations of drops), he offers that (horse) as a complete
offering <span id="fr_701"></span>[1](#fn_697)--so as to make good any
spilling <span id="fr_702"></span>[2](#fn_698); for unspilled is any
(part) of the offered (material) that is spilled. A thousand (oblations
of drops) he offers for the obtainment of the heavenly world, for the
heavenly world is equal in extent to a thousand.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:2">13:1:3:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offer measured (a specified number
of oblations), he would gain for himself something limited:' he offers
unspecified (oblations) for the obtainment of the unlimited. And indeed
Pra*g*âpati spake, 'Verily, upon the oblations of drops I establish the
A*s*vamedha, and by it, when established, I pass upward from hence.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:3">13:1:3:3</span></span>3. \[He
offers, with Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 6,\] 'To Agni, hail!'--to Agni he thus
offers it (the horse <span id="fr_703"></span>[3](#fn_699));--'to Soma,
hail!'--to Soma he thus offers it;--'to the joy of the waters,
hail!'--to the waters he thus offers it;--'to Savit*ri*, hail!'--to
Savit*ri*

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

he thus offers it;--'to Vâyu, hail!'--to Vâyu (the wind) he thus offers
it;--'to Vish*n*u, hail!'--to Vish*n*u he thus offers it to;--'Indra,
hail!'--to Indra he thus offers it;--'to B*ri*haspati, hail!'--to
B*ri*haspati he thus offers it;--'to Mitra, hail!'--to Mitra he thus
offers it;--'to Varu*n*a, hail!'--to Varu*n*a he thus offers it:--so
many, doubtless, are all the gods: it is to them he offers it. He offers
them straight away <span id="fr_704"></span>[1](#fn_700) for the
obtainment of the heavenly world, for straight away, as it were, is the
heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:4">13:1:3:4</span></span>4. But,
verily, he who offers the oblations straight away, would be liable to
fall (pass) right away <span id="fr_705"></span>[2](#fn_701): he turns
back again <span id="fr_706"></span>[3](#fn_702), and establishes
himself in this (terrestrial) world. And this <span
id="fr_707"></span>[4](#fn_703) indeed he (Pra*g*âpati) has declared to
be the perfection of the sacrifice, so as to prevent falling away
(spilling), for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:5">13:1:3:5</span></span>5. And
even as some of the offering-material may be spilled before it is
offered, so also (part) of the

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

victim is here spilled in that they let loose the sprinkled (horse)
before it is slaughtered. When he offers (the oblations relating to) the
Forms <span id="fr_708"></span>[1](#fn_704) (rûpa), he offers that
(horse) as one that is wholly offered, so as to make good any spilling;
for unspilled is what is spilled of the offered (material). With (Vâ*g*.
S. XXII, 7-8 <span id="fr_709"></span>[2](#fn_705)),'To the Hiṅ-call,
hail! to the (horse) consecrated by Hiṅ, hail! . . .'

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (he offers them);
for these are the forms (qualities) of the horse: it is them he now
obtains.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:6">13:1:3:6</span></span>6.
Concerning this they say, 'The Forms are no offering: they should not be
offered.' But, indeed, they also say, 'Therein assuredly the
horse-sacrifice becomes complete that he performs (the oblations
relating to) the Forms: they should certainly be offered.' And, indeed,
one puts that (Sacrificer) out of his resting-place, and raises a rival
for him when one offers for him oblations elsewhere than in the
fire <span id="fr_710"></span>[1](#fn_706), where there is no
resting-place.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:7">13:1:3:7</span></span>7.
Prior to the (first) oblation to Savit*ri* <span
id="fr_711"></span>[2](#fn_707), he (the Adhvaryu) offers, once only,
(the oblations relating to) the Forms <span
id="fr_712"></span>[3](#fn_708) in the Âhavanîya, whilst going rapidly
over (the formulas): he thus offers the oblations at his (the
Sacrificer's) resting-place, and raises no rival for him. He offers at
each opening of sacrifice <span id="fr_713"></span>[4](#fn_709), for the
continuity and uninterrupted performance of the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:1:3:8">13:1:3:8</span></span>8.
Concerning this they say, 'Were he to offer

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

at each opening of sacrifice, he would be deprived of his cattle, and
would become poorer.' They should be performed once only: thus he is not
deprived of his cattle, and does not become poorer. Forty-eight
(oblations) he offers;--the *G*agatî consists of forty-eight syllables,
and cattle are of *G*âgata (movable) nature: by means of the *G*agatî he
(the Adhvaryu) thus wins cattle for him (the Sacrificer). One additional
(oblation) he offers, whence one man is apt to thrive amongst (many)
creatures (or subjects).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_697"></span>[280:1](sbe44076.htm#fr_701) Cf. I, 2, 4, 3; 3,
3, 16 seqq.; IV, 2, 5, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_698"></span>[280:2](sbe44076.htm#fr_702) Lit., for
non-spilling, i.e. to neutralise any spilling that may have taken place.

<span id="fn_699"></span>[280:3](sbe44076.htm#fr_703) Harisvâmin seems
rather to lay the stress on the direct object:--agnaye param evâ*s*va*m*
*g*uhoti na kevalam â*g*yam. The context, however, does not admit of
this interpretation.

<span id="fn_700"></span>[281:1](sbe44076.htm#fr_704) According to Kâty.
XX, 2, 3-5, he offers either a thousand oblations, or as many as he can
offer till the dripping of the water from the horse has ceased. For
every ten oblations he uses the formulas here given, after which he
begins again from the beginning. The 'straight on' apparently means that
he is neither to break the order of the deities, nor to offer more than
one oblation at a time to the same deity.

<span id="fn_701"></span>[281:2](sbe44076.htm#fr_705) That is, he would
die; 'praitîty artha*h*,' Comm. The St. Petersburg Dict., on the other
hand, takes 'î*s*vara*h* pradagha*h*' in the sense of 'liable to fall
down headlong' (abstürzen).

<span id="fn_702"></span>[281:3](sbe44076.htm#fr_706) That is, by
commencing the ten oblations again from the beginning.

<span id="fn_703"></span>[281:4](sbe44076.htm#fr_707) Viz. repetition of
performance,--etâm eva *k*a sa pra*g*âpatir âv*ri*ttimattâ*m* ya*gñ*asya
sa*m*sthitim (uvâ*k*a). On repetitions in the chanting of stotras, see
III, 2, 5, 8; cf. also [XII, 2, 3, 13](sbe44051.htm#12:2:3:13).

<span id="fn_704"></span>[282:1](sbe44076.htm#fr_708) These forty-nine
oblations performed after the letting loose of the horse, are called
Prakramas (i.e. steps, or movements); cf. [XIII, 4, 3,
4](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:4); Kâty. XX, 3, 3.--Harisvâmin remarks,
a*s*varûpâ*n*â*m* hiṅkârâdînâ*m* nishkrama*n*âtmikâ (!) rûpâkhyâ âhutaya
u*k*yante, tâ evâtra prakramâ iti vakshyante.

<span id="fn_705"></span>[282:2](sbe44076.htm#fr_709) These (rather
pedantic) formulas, all of them ending in 'svâhâ,' occupy two Ka*nd*ikâs
of the Sa*m*hitâ, consisting of 24 and 25 formulas respectively:--1. To
the hiṅkâra, svâhâ! 2. To the one consecrated by 'hiṅ,' hail! 3. To the
whinnying one, hail! 4. To the neighing, hail! 5. To the snorting one,
hail! 6. To the snort, hail! 7. To smell, hail! 8. To the (thing)
smelled, hail! 9. To the stabled one, hail! 10. To the resting one,
hail! 11. To the clipped one, hail! 12. To the prancing one, hail! 13.
To the seated one, hail! 14. To the lying one, hail! 15. To the sleeping
one, hail! 16. To the waking one, hail! 17, To the groaning one, hail!
18, To the awakened one, hail! 19. To the yawning one, hail! 20. To the
untethered one, hail! 21. To the upstarting one, hail! 22. To the
standing one, hail! 23. To the starting one, hail! 24. To the advancing
one, hail!-25. To the trotting one, hail! 26. To the running one, hail!
27. To the bolting one, hail! 28. To the flighty one, hail! 29. To the
geeho, hail! 30. To the one urged on by geeho, hail! 31. To the
prostrate one, hail! 32. To the risen one, hail! 33. To the swift one,
hail! 34. To the strong one, hail! 35. To the turning one, hail! 36. To
the turned one, hail! 37. To the shaking one, hail! 38. To the shaken
one, hail! 39. To the obedient one, hail! 40. To the listening one,
hail! 41. To the looking one, hail! 42. To the one looked at, hail! 43.
To the out-looking one, hail! 44. To the winking one, hail! 45. To what
it eats; hail! 46. To what it drinks, hail! 47. To the water it makes,
hail! 48. To the working one, hail! 49. To the wrought one, hail!

<span id="fn_706"></span>[283:1](sbe44076.htm#fr_710) According to Kâty.
XX, 3, 3, the Prakramas are to be offered in the Dakshi*n*âgni; but our
Brâhma*n*a, whilst mentioning, at [XIII, 4, 3,
4](sbe44104.htm#13:4:3:4), both that fire, and the horse's footprint as
optional places of offering, there as well as here decides in favour of
the Âhavanîya; whence Harisvâmin remarks:--anyatrâgner iti
anvâhâryapa*k*ane vâ*s*vapade vâ parilikhite
vakshyamâ*n*akalpântaranindâ.

<span id="fn_707"></span>[283:2](sbe44076.htm#fr_711) See [XIII, 1, 4,
2](sbe44077.htm#13:1:4:2).

<span id="fn_708"></span>[283:3](sbe44076.htm#fr_712) That is to say,
without repeating them, when he has come to the end, as he did in the
case of the 'oblations of drops.' Nor are they to be repeated day after
day throughout the year, as some of the other offerings and rites are.

<span id="fn_709"></span>[283:4](sbe44076.htm#fr_713) Viz., according to
Harisvâmin, at (the beginning of) the dîksha*n*îyâ, prâya*n*îyâ,
âtithyâ, pravargya; the upasads, agnîshomîya, sutyâ, avabh*ri*tha,
udayanîyâ, and udavasânîyâ offerings (ish*t*i). This view is, however,
rejected by the author.
