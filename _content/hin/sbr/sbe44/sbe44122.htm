For at this time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Sv&acirc;h&acirc;-call before (its being taken to) the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya, being thus offered they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it with the Sv&acirc;h&acirc;-call before</p>

With, 'Hail to Agni, worthy of sacrifice!'--this is in lieu of the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t (offering), for Agni is the maker of good offering;--'may blessing result from the sacrificial texts!' for by the sacrificial texts that (sun) is established (as the Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra) in this world: thus it is them he thereby pleases.

The call of 'hail!' he places first, and the deity last: the significance of this is the same as before.

One must not perform the Pravargya at one's first Soma-sacrifice, since that would be sinful, and lest Indra should cut off his head; but at the second or the third (Soma-sacrifice); for at first the gods went on worshipping and toiling with the headless sacrifice, therefore (he should do so) at the second or the third (sacrifice).

<P><A NAME="fn_1269"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1278">483:1</A> The exact meaning of 'h&acirc;rdv&acirc;nam' is doubtful. Mah&icirc;dhara analyses it by 'h&acirc;rd' = 'h<I>ri</I>d', + 'v&acirc;na,' blowing, going, hence 'heart-wafting, going to the heart = dear to the heart.' The St. Petersb. Dict. takes the word to be 'h&acirc;rd-van,' in the sense of 'herzst&auml;rkend' (heart-sustaining, invigorating--? literally, 'possessed of heartiness'). The Taitt. &Acirc;r. has 'h&acirc;rdiv&acirc;nam' instead. The author of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a apparently considers the term as obscure, and uses this circumstance for his own symbolic purposes.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1270"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1279">483:2</A> Perhaps the author means to characterise also the epithet <A NAME="page_484"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 484</FONT></A> 'ahar-diva' (lit. 'day-daily,' cf. Germ. tagt&auml;glich; Aberdonian 'daily-day') as obscure. Mah&icirc;dhara takes it to mean 'relating to morning and evening,' as applying to the two performances of the Pravargya,</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1271"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1280">484:1</A> They approved of it by saying 'Well done'; Mah&icirc;dh.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1272"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1281">484:2</A> That is, as would seem, he speaks the anumantra<I>n</I>a in order to consecrate whatever milk might have been spilled in bubbling over. Possibly, however, he is to do so at the time when the pot bubbles over (though the 'atha' would rather be out of place in that case). The Taittir&icirc;yas differ somewhat on this point of the performance. <A NAME="page_485"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 485</FONT></A> After the Gharma-milk has been offered, the Pratiprasth&acirc;t<I>ri</I> fills the Mah&acirc;v&icirc;ra pot, whilst it is held over the fire, with boiled sour curds and whey (dadhi), whilst muttering the text, 'The A<I>s</I>vins drank the Gharma . . .,' and with the texts; 'For freshness swell thou,' &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1273"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1282">485:1</A> The author apparently takes 'ameni' in the sense of 'amanyu.' <A NAME="page_486"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 486</FONT></A> The St. Petersb. Dict. assigns to it the meaning 'not shooting, incapable of shooting.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1274"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1283">486:1</A> For these pieces of wood, or large chips, of Vika&#7749;kata wood (Flacourtia sapida) which were laid round the pot, see <a href="sbe44119.htm#14:1:3:26">XIV, 1, 3, 26</A>. They are dipped into the remains of the hot milk and ghee, the liquid adhering to them being then offered.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1275"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1284">486:2</A> That is, that one of the three fresh sticks enclosing the fire which is laid down first, along the back, or west side, and forms the base of a triangle the apex of which points eastwards. Cf. I, 3, 4, 1 seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1276"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1285">486:3</A> This meaning is, by the St. Petersb. Dict., assigned to 'prati-rava' <A NAME="page_487"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 487</FONT></A> (otherwise 'echo'), the proper term for the sounding-holes being 'upa-rava,' cf. III, 5, 4, 1, where they are likened to the eyes and ears, as channels of the vital airs.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1277"></A><A HREF="sbe44122.htm#fr_1286">487:1</A> If this rendering (St. Petersb. Dict.) of &ucirc;rdhvabarhis' is correct--the term being apparently based on the Fathers&#8217; epithet 'barhishada<I>h</I>,' 'seated on the barhis' (sacrificial grass-covering of the altar-ground)--the force of '&ucirc;rdhva' in the compound is very peculiar. Mah&icirc;dhara takes it in the sense of 'having their barhis pointed upwards,' i.e. towards the east (!), the peculiar feature of the barhis in the present case--as far as the participation of the Fathers in the drinking of the Gharma is concerned--being its having the tops of the grass-stalks turned to the east instead of to the south, as is the case in all ceremonies relating to the Fathers. The term '&ucirc;rdhvabarhis' might possibly mean 'having their (special) barhis above,' i.e. in the world of the Fathers, where they would be supposed to partake of the libations of hot milk; whilst yet another (suggested by the next paragraph) would be that of 'having the barhis above them;' which would, however, be more appropriate if the secreting of the stick under the barhis applied to the present, instead of the next one.</P>
