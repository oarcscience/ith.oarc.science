On the right (south) side they then dig two somewhat curved (furrows&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1167"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>), and fill them with milk and water,--these, indeed, are two inexhaustible streams (that) flow to him in the other world;--and seven (they dig) on the left (north) side, and fill them with water, for sin not to pass beyond, for indeed sin cannot pass beyond seven rivers&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1168"></A><A HREF="#fn_1160"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

XXXV, 10; <I>Ri</I>g-v. X, 53, 8): 'Here floweth the stony one: hold on to each other, rise, and cross over, ye friends: here will we leave behind what unkind spirits there be, and will cross over to auspicious nourishments;'--as the text so its import.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:4">13:8:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. They cleanse themselves with Ap&acirc;m&acirc;rga plants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1170"></A><A HREF="#fn_1162"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>--they thereby wipe away (apa-marg) sin--</p>

<p>with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 11), 'O Ap&acirc;m&acirc;rga, drive thou away from us sin, away guilt, away witchery, away infirmity, away evil dreams!'--as the text so its import.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:5">13:8:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. They bathe at any place where there is water. With (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 12), 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water with his joined hands,--for water is a thunderbolt: with the thunderbolt he thus makes friendship,--and with, 'Unfriendly may they be unto him who hateth us, and whom we hate!' he throws it in the direction in which he who is hateful to him may be, and thereby overthrows him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:6">13:8:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. And if it be standing water, it makes their (the bathers&#8217;) evil stop; and if it flows, it carries away their evil. Having bathed, and put on garments that have never yet been washed, they hold on to the tail of an ox&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1171"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and return (to their home),--for the ox is of Agni's nature: headed by Agni they thus return from the world of the Fathers to the world of the living. And Agni, indeed, is he who leads one over the paths (one has to travel), and it is he who leads these over.</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:7">13:8:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. They proceed (towards the village) muttering this verse (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 14), 'From out of the gloom have we risen&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1172"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> . . .'--from the gloom, the world of the Fathers, they now indeed approach the light, the sun. When they have arrived, ointments for the eyes and the feet are given them: such, indeed, are human means of embellishment, and therewith they keep off death from themselves.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:8">13:8:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. Then, in the house, having made up the (domestic) fire, and laid enclosing-sticks of Vara<I>n</I>a wood round it, he offers, by means of a sruva-spoon of Vara<I>n</I>a wood, an oblation to Agni &Acirc;yushmat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1173"></A><A HREF="#fn_1165"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for Agni &Acirc;yushmat rules over vital power: it is of him he asks vital power for these (the Sacrificer's family). [V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 16,] 'Thou, Agni, causest vital powers to flow: (send us food and drink, and keep calamity. far from us),' serves as invitatory formula.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:9">13:8:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. He then offers, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 17), 'Long-lived be thou, O Agni, growing by offering, ghee-mouthed, ghee-born: drinking the sweet, pleasant cow's ghee, guard thou these, as a father does his son, hail!' he thus says this so that he (Agni) may guard and protect these (men).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:10">13:8:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. The sacrificial fee for this (ceremony) consists of an old ox, old barley, an old arm-chair with head-cushion--this at least is the prescribed Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;, but he may give more according to his inclination. Such, indeed, (is the performance) in the case of one who had built a fire-altar.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_440"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 440</FONT></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:11">13:8:4:11</A></FONT></span>11. And in the case of one who has not built a fire-altar, there is the same mode of selecting the site (for the sepulchral mound) and the same performance save that of the fire-altar. 'Let him use pebbles (instead of bricks&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1174"></A><A HREF="#fn_1166"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>) in the case of one who keeps up a sacrificial fire,' say some, 'they are just what those pebbles used at the Agny&acirc;dheya are&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1167"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.' 'Let him not use them,' say others; 'surely they would be liable to weigh heavily upon one who has not built a fire-altar.' Let him do as he pleases.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:4:12">13:8:4:12</A></FONT></span>12. Having fetched a clod from the boundary, he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1168"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> deposits it (midway) between (the grave and the village), with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 15), 'This I put up as a bulwark for the living, lest another of them should go unto that thing: may they live for a hundred plentiful harvests, and shut out death from themselves by a mountain!'--he thus makes this a boundary between the Fathers and the living, so as not to commingle; and therefore, indeed, the living and the Fathers are not seen together here.</p>

Sr. XXI, the pegs are driven in immediately after the measuring, and prior to the sweeping, of the site of the tumulus; and this must certainly be the case, seeing that the cords by which the site is enclosed (<a href="sbe44113.htm#13:8:1:19">XIII, 8, 1, 19</A>) are fastened to the pegs.</P>

Prof. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 21, note, refers to the somewhat analogous practice of tying to the left arm of a dead man the tail of the anustara<I>n</I>&icirc;-cow slain at the funeral sacrifice, whereby the deceased is supposed to be led safely--across the river Vaitara<I>n</I>&icirc; (Styx); see S&acirc;y. on Sha<I>d</I>v. Br., as quoted Ind. Stud. I, p. 39; cf. also Colebrooke, Misc. Essays, second ed., p. 192--to the world of the Fathers. According to Katy. XXI, 4, 24 the ceremony of taking hold of the tail is performed with the verse, V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

It is difficult to see why the author should not have given it in its right place, unless it was done with a view to a good conclusion to the K&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>a, or because he really wished it to he done after the performance of the offering.
