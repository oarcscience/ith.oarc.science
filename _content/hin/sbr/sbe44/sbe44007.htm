But, indeed, he (the moon) is that heavenly dog: he watches the Sacrificer's cattle (to seize them), and that would not be good for cattle if amends were not made to them&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and through fear of that 'down-coming moon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>,' as they think him to be,--</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:5:2">11:1:5:2</A></FONT></span>2. They steal away into the shade. And therefore, indeed, people call that burning pain '<I>s</I>valu<I>k</I>ita' (dog's clutch);--and therefore they also call that one--</p>

Soma, the food of the gods, indeed, is the moon: at full moon they press him; and in the subsequent half of the month he enters the waters and plants; and, the cattle feeding on the water and the plants, he then during that night (of new moon) collects him from the cattle.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:5:4">11:1:5:4</A></FONT></span>4. He keeps the fast thinking, 'To-day is the day of new moon;' and then that (moon) is seen in the west, and the Sacrificer departs from the path of sacrifice. As to this they say, 'What should one do when he has departed from the path of the sacrifice? Should he sacrifice, or should he not sacrifice?' He should certainly sacrifice, for there is no other way out of it: day after day that (moon) rises larger. Having performed offering after the manner of the New-moon sacrifice, he takes out material for an additional offering either on the same, or on the following day.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:5:6">11:1:5:6</A></FONT></span>6. Now as to why he prepares (an oblation) for Agni Pathik<I>ri</I>t,--it is that Agni, being the maker of the path, leads the Sacrificer (back) to the path of sacrifice, from which he now departs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:5:7">11:1:5:7</A></FONT></span>7. And as to why to Indra V<I>ri</I>trahan,--V<I>ri</I>tra is sin: with the help of Indra, the slayer of V<I>ri</I>tra, he thus slays sin, V<I>ri</I>tra, which ever keeps him from well-being, from virtue, and from the good work: this is why he (offers) to Indra V<I>ri</I>trahan.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:5:8">11:1:5:8</A></FONT></span>8. And as to why he prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara,--when Indra had slain V<I>ri</I>tra, he burnt him completely by means of Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara, and thereby burnt all his (V<I>ri</I>tra's) sin; and in like manner does that (Sacrificer) now, after slaying sin, V<I>ri</I>tra, with the help of Indra V<I>ri</I>trahan, burn him, and all that sin of his, by means of Agni Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nara; and, verily, not the slightest sin remains in him who, knowing this, performs this offering.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:1:5:9">11:1:5:9</A></FONT></span>9. For this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses. He offers to the deities in a low voice, and makes any (verses) he pleases his invitatory and offering-formulas. In like manner (those of) the two butter-portions and the two formulas of the Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t.</p>

A bow with three arrows he gives as dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;; for with the bow a dog is driven away: he thus drives away that (dog, the moon) when he gives a bow with three arrows as dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;.</p>

<p>a dog is driven away: he thus drives away that (dog) when he gives a staff as dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;. This, indeed, is the prescribed dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;; but he may give anything else besides, of such other (objects meet for) dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s as may be at his disposal. This, doubtless, is an offering relating to cattle: he may perform it even though (the moon) was not seen (at his New-moon sacrifice).</p>
