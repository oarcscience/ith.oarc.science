### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:4:1">11:7:4:1</span></span>1. Now,
when he who is about to perform an animal sacrifice makes a stake one
cubit long, he thereby gains this (terrestrial) world; and when (he
makes) one two cubits long, he thereby gains the air-world; and when be
makes one three cubits long, he thereby gains the heavens; and when he
makes one four cubits long, he thereby gains the regions. But, indeed,
that sacrificial stake of the (ordinary) animal sacrifice is either
three or four cubits long, and one that is above that belongs to the
Soma-sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:4:2">11:7:4:2</span></span>2. As
to this they say, 'Should he offer the butter-portions or not?'--'Let
him offer them,' they say; 'for the two butter-portions are the eyes of
the sacrifice, and what were man without eyes?' For as long as a
co-sharer is not bought off by (receiving) a share of his own, so long
does he consider himself not bought off; but when he is bought off by a
share of his own, then, indeed, he considers himself bought

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

off: when the Hot*ri*, on that occasion <span
id="fr_387"></span>[1](#fn_387), recites, 'Endow the Rakshas with
blood!' he buys him off by (assigning to him) a share of his own.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:4:3">11:7:4:3</span></span>3. For
on that occasion <span id="fr_388"></span>[2](#fn_388) the anguish of
the victim, in being slaughtered, becomes concentrated in the heart, and
from the heart (it flows) into the spit. Thus, if they (were to) cook
the animal together with the heart, the anguish would again spread all
over the animal: let him therefore cook it (the heart) after spitting it
from the side on a stick.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:4:4">11:7:4:4</span></span>4. He
makes an underlayer of ghee (in the offering-ladle): this he makes a
type of the earth; he then puts a chip of gold thereon: this he makes a
type of fire; he then puts the omentum thereon: this he makes a type of
the air; he then puts a chip of gold thereon: this he makes a type of
the sun; and what (ghee) he pours upon it, that he makes a type of the
heavens. This, then, is that five-portioned omentum,--fivefold is the
sacrifice, fivefold the sacrificial animal, and five seasons there are
in the year: this is why the omentum consists of five portions <span

<span id="fn_387"></span>[125:1](sbe44040.htm#fr_387) Viz. at the time
when the victim is cut up. Cf. Ait. Br. II, 7,--'Endow ye the Rakshas
with blood!' he says; for by (assigning to them) the husks and the
sweepings of the grain the gods deprived the Rakshas of their share in
the Havirya*gñ*a, and by the blood (they deprived them) of that in the
great (Soma-) sacrifice: thus by saying, 'Endow ye the Rakshas with
blood!' he dispossesses the Rakshas of the sacrifice by assigning to
them their own share.--The Adhvaryu then smears a stalk of grass with
the blood with, 'Thou art the Rakshas’ share,' throws it on the heap of
rubbish, and treads on it with, 'Herewith I tread down the Rakshas,' &c.
Cf. III, 8, 2, 13-15.
