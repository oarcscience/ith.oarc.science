Now the animal sacrifice means cattle: thus, when he performs the animal sacrifice (pa<I>s</I>ubandha, the binding of the animal), it is in order that he may be possessed of cattle. Let him perform it at his home, thinking, 'I will bind (attach) cattle to my home.' Let him perform it in the season of abundant fodder, thinking, 'I will bind to myself cattle in a season of abundant fodder.<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> For, whilst he is offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_366"></A><A HREF="#fn_366"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the Sacrificer's fires become worn out, and so does the Sacrificer, along with the worn-out fires, and along with the Sacrificer his house and cattle.</p>

In other fires&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_368"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> people do indeed cook any kind of meat, but these (sacrificial fires) have no desire for any other flesh but this (sacrificial animal), and for him to whom they belong.</p>

Now, when he performs the animal offering. he thereby redeems himself--male by male, for the victim is a male, and the Sacrificer is a male. And this, indeed, to wit, flesh, is the best kind of food: he thus becomes an eater of the best kind of food. Let not a year pass by for him without his offering; for the year means life: it is thus immortal life he thereby confers upon himself.</p>
