### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:1">12:3:5:1</span></span>1. Of
old, indeed, they were wont to seize this victim as one dedicated to
Savit*ri*, but now they seize it as one dedicated to Pra*g*âpati,
saying, 'Savit*ri*, in truth, is the same as Pra*g*âpati.' It is
therefore after having thrown together the (sacrificial) fires that they
ought to perform this (animal) sacrifice on the G*ri*hapati's own fires,
thinking, 'May we also have a share in this tail (of the. victim)
wherewith they are now making offering together to the wives

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (of the gods).'
They then perform the initiation ceremony whenever they choose.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:2">12:3:5:2</span></span>2. Here
now they say, 'They ought to have separate hearths; and if one of the
initiates were to be taken ill let him stay aside offering the
Agnihotra. If he gets well again, they bring (the fires) together and
invite him to join them; but if he dies they burn him by his own (three)
fires <span id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_499) without an (ordinary) fire
for (burning) a dead body; and the other sacrificers sit (through the
sacrificial session);--such at least is the performance in the case of
one who keeps up his sacrificial fires; but, indeed, they have their
hearths in common: the theological explication of this is the same as in
regard to the preparatory ceremonial <span
id="fr_500"></span>[2](#fn_500).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:3">12:3:5:3</span></span>3. They
also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how does their Agnihotra come to be
uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the fast-milk.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:4">12:3:5:4</span></span>4. They
also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how does their Full-moon oblation come to be
uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the ghee and the sacrificial cake.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:5">12:3:5:5</span></span>5. They
also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how does their New-moon oblation come to be
uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the sour curds and the cake.'

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:6">12:3:5:6</span></span>6. They
also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how does their offering to the Fathers come to be
uninterrupted?' Let him reply,' By the Aupâsana (rites <span
id="fr_501"></span>[1](#fn_501)).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:7">12:3:5:7</span></span>7. They
also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how does their offering of firstfruits come to be
uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By Soma's pap <span
id="fr_502"></span>[2](#fn_502).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:8">12:3:5:8</span></span>8. They
also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how do their seasonal offerings come to be
uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the Payasyâ <span
id="fr_503"></span>[3](#fn_503).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:9">12:3:5:9</span></span>9. They
also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how does their animal sacrifice come to be
uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the animal and the cake <span
id="fr_504"></span>[4](#fn_504).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:10">12:3:5:10</span></span>10.
They also say, 'Seeing that the performers of a year's session become
initiated for a year, how

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

does their Soma come to be uninterrupted?' Let him reply, 'By the
Soma-pressings.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:11">12:3:5:11</span></span>11.
It is thus that these sacrificial rites enter into the year; and,
verily, whosoever thus knows this entering of the sacrificial rites into
the year becomes a sharer in the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:12">12:3:5:12</span></span>12.
In the year there should be known to be uniformity:--one Atirâtra they
perform before, and one after, the Vishuvat; fifty three Agnish*t*omas
they perform before, and fifty-three after, the Vishuvat; one hundred
and twenty Ukthya days they perform before, and one hundred and twenty
after, the Vishuvat,--thus at least in the case of those who perform the
Svarasâmans as Ukthyas.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:3:5:13">12:3:5:13</span></span>13.
And in the case of those who (perform them) as Agnish*t*omas, they
perform fifty-six Agnish*t*omas before, and fifty-six after, the
Vishuvat; one hundred and seventeen Ukthya days they perform before, and
one hundred and seventeen after, the Vishuvat; six Sho*d*a*s*ins they
perform before, and six after, the Vishuvat; thirty Sha*d*ahas <span
id="fr_505"></span>[1](#fn_505) they perform before, and thirty after,
the Vishuvat:--such, then, is the uniformity of that (year), and,
verily, he who thus knows this goes through a course of sacrificial
performance which is uniform, and not ineffectual, neither defective nor
redundant.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_499"></span>[175:1](sbe44057.htm#fr_499) This is the
regular procedure in accordance with G*ri*hya rites, cf. Â*s*v. G*ri*hy.
IV, 2, 11-13; whilst Pâraskara, III, 10, 11, merely says, 'with the
domestic fire they burn him who has established his (sacred) fire.'

<span id="fn_500"></span>[175:2](sbe44057.htm#fr_500) For the
'pura*sk*ara*n*a,' see part iv, p. 337, note 2.

<span id="fn_501"></span>[176:1](sbe44057.htm#fr_501) Viz., by those
rites which, during the time for which the Sacrificer is initiated, may
be performed on his domestic (Âvasathya or Aupâsana) fire. Cf. Kâty. I,
1, 20. 21. Whether the domestic offerings to the Fathers (*s*râddha) may
be so performed seems doubtful.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[176:2](sbe44057.htm#fr_502) For the ordinary
performance of the Âgraya*n*esh*t*i, see part i, p. 370 seqq. According
to Kâty. IV, 6, 11 seq. the performance of a year's sattra is to mark
the time at which the offering of first-fruits would otherwise have
taken place by using new grain for his vrata-food, as well as for two
Rauhi*n*a cakes at the Upasads, and for the cakes offered in the animal
sacrifice of the Soma days; and that a pap of new *s*yâmâka (millet) is
to be offered to Soma at the proper season (during the rains, or
autumn), and a pap of bamboo grain in summer.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[176:3](sbe44057.htm#fr_503) For this dish,
made by the addition of fresh boiled milk to sour curds, see part i, p.
381, note 2.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[176:4](sbe44057.htm#fr_504) That is, by the
animal offered on each successive Soma day, and the (savanîya)
puro*d*â*s*as offered subsequently; cf. IV, 2, 5, 14-22.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[177:1](sbe44057.htm#fr_505) That is, counting
the Prâya*n*îya Atirâtra, *K*aturvi*ms*a, Abhi*g*it, and three
Svarasâmans as one six-days’ performance, before the Vishuvat; and the
three Svarasâmans, the Vi*s*va*g*it, Gosh*t*oma, Âyush*t*oma, four days
of the Da*s*arâtra (preceding and succeeding the central Sha*d*aha), the
Mahâvrata, and Udayanîya Atirâtra as two six-days’ performances after
the Vishuvat.
