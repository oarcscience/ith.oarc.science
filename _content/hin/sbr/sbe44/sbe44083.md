### SECOND ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE FIRST SOMA-DAY (AGNISH*T*OMA) <span id="fr_747"></span>[2](#fn_743).

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:1:1">13:2:1:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati assigned the sacrifices to the gods; the A*s*vamedha he kept
for himself. The gods

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

said to him, 'Surely, this--to wit, the A*s*vamedha--is a sacrifice: let
us have a share in that also.' He contrived these Anna-homas
(food-oblations) for them: thus when he performs the Annahomas, it is
the gods he thereby gratifies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:1:2">13:2:1:2</span></span>2. With
ghee he makes offering, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery
mettle he thus lays fiery mettle into him (the horse and Sacrificer).
With ghee he offers; for that--to wit, ghee--is the gods’ favourite
resource: it is thus with their favourite resource he supplies them.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:1:3">13:2:1:3</span></span>3. With
parched groats he makes offering; for that--to wit, parched groats--are
a form of the gods <span id="fr_748"></span>[1](#fn_744): it is the gods
he thus gratifies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:1:4">13:2:1:4</span></span>4. With
grain he makes offering; for this--to wit, grain--is a form of the days
and nights <span id="fr_749"></span>[2](#fn_745): it is the days and
nights he thus gratifies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:1:5">13:2:1:5</span></span>5. With
parched grain he makes offering; for this--to wit, parched grain--is a
form of the Nakshatras <span id="fr_750"></span>[3](#fn_746) (lunar
asterisms): it is the Nakshatras

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

he thus gratifies. He offers whilst mentioning names, with (Vâ*g*. XXII,
23-33), 'To the in- (and out-) breathing hail! to the off-breathing
hail <span id="fr_751"></span>[1](#fn_747)!' . . . he thus gratifies
them by mentioning their names. \[Vâ*g*. S. XXII, 34\], 'To one hail! to
two hail! . . . to a hundred hail! to a hundred and one hail!' He offers
in the proper order: in the proper order he thus gratifies them (the
gods). He performs oblations successively increasing by one <span
id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_748), for single, indeed, is heaven: singly
he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach heaven. Straight away <span
id="fr_753"></span>[3](#fn_749) he offers in order to the winning of
heaven; for straight away, as it were, is heaven.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:1:6">13:2:1:6</span></span>6. But,
verily, he who offers the oblations straight

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

away <span id="fr_754"></span>[1](#fn_750), is liable to fall (pass)
right away. He does not go beyond a hundred and one: were he to go
beyond a hundred and one, he would deprive the Sacrificer of his vital
power. He offers a hundred and one, for man has a life of a hundred
(years), and his own self is the one hundred and first: he thus
establishes himself in a self (or body), in vital power. With 'To the
Dawn hail! to Heaven hail!' he offers the two last oblations; for the
dawn is the night, and heaven (the realm of light) is the day: it is day
and night he thus gratifies.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:2:1:7">13:2:1:7</span></span>7. As
to this they say, 'Were he to offer both either by day or by night, he
would confound day and night with one another <span
id="fr_755"></span>[2](#fn_751).' With 'To the Dawn hail!' he offers
before the sun has risen, and with 'To Heaven hail' when it has risen,
to avoid confusion between day and night.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_743"></span>[295:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_747) There are three
Sutyâs, or Soma-days, at the A*s*vamedha--viz. an Agnish*t*oma, an
Ukthya, and an Atirâtra--the most important <span id="page_296">p.
296</span> of which is the central day. The first day offers no special
features, as compared with the ordinary Agnish*t*oma; except that the
stotras are chanted on the '*k*atush*t*oma' model (see note to [XIII, 3,
1, 4](sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:4)); and that the animal sacrifice of this day
requires twenty-one sacrificial stakes, with twice eleven victims, two
of which are tied to the central stake; see note on [XIII, 2, 5,
2](sbe44087.htm#13:2:5:2). The offerings referred to in the present
Brâhma*n*a, are performed, not during the day itself, but during the
following night, as a preliminary to the important features of the
second Soma-day.

<span id="fn_744"></span>[296:1](sbe44083.htm#fr_748) Viz., according to
the commentary, because of the (particles of) groats being connected
with each other.

<span id="fn_745"></span>[296:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_749) The commentary
does not explain this comparison. It would seem to suit better the
parched grain.

<span id="fn_746"></span>[296:3](sbe44083.htm#fr_750) Viz. on account of
the capability (samarthatvât) of the (raw) grains; but whether this is
meant to refer to their power of germinating and growing is not
explained.

<span id="fn_747"></span>[297:1](sbe44083.htm#fr_751) These eleven
anuvâkas consist of altogether 149 such short dedicatory
formulas--addressed to the vital airs, the regions, the waters, wind,
fire, &c.--each ending with 'svâhâ (hail).' These are followed, in
anuvâka 34, by formulas addressed to the cardinal numbers from 1 to 101;
succeeded by two formulas addressed to the dawn and to heaven
respectively,--all of these again ending with 'svâhâ.' The Annahomas
themselves, offered by the Adhvaryu's assistant, the Pratiprasthât*ri*,
are not, however, limited to any number; but their performance is to be
continued throughout the night in such a way that each of the four
three-hours’ watches of the night is to be taken up with as many
oblations of one of the four kinds of offering materials--in the order
in which they are enumerated in the text--as can be got into the space
of three hours. The formulas addressed to the cardinal numbers--(which
are on no account to extend beyond 101)--are apparently supposed amply
to suffice to fill up the time till dawn, when the Adhvaryu makes an
oblation of ghee to the Dawn, followed by one to Heaven (or the realm of
light) after sunrise.

<span id="fn_748"></span>[297:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_752) That is, in
offering with the formulas addressed to the cardinal numbers.

<span id="fn_749"></span>[297:3](sbe44083.htm#fr_753) That is to say,
without repeating any formula, or commencing again from the beginning,
when the whole series is exhausted.

<span id="fn_750"></span>[298:1](sbe44083.htm#fr_754) That is, without
stopping.

<span id="fn_751"></span>[298:2](sbe44083.htm#fr_755) There is no 'iti'
here; and the quotation, therefore, may perhaps extend to the end of the
paragraph.
