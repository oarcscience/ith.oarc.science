Now, when Indra's energies, or vital powers, departed from him, the gods restored them by means of this very sacrifice. Both cups of milk and cups of Sur&acirc;-liquor are filled: they thereby restore to him his energies, or vital powers. On the northern fire they offer (from) the cups of milk, and thereby provide him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> with the bright liquor, with the Soma-drink.</p>

<p>to joy, and so does the Sur&acirc;-liquor: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Sur&acirc; he thus secures;--'worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!'--for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful.

'To the Svadh&acirc;-loving Fathers be Svadh&acirc;, adoration!' he thereby places the Fathers with the Svadh&acirc; in the world of the Fathers.--'To the Svadh&acirc;-loving grandfathers he Svadh&acirc;, adoration!' he thereby places the grandfathers with the Svadh&acirc; in the world of the grandfathers.--'To the Svadh&acirc;-loving great-grandfathers be Svadh&acirc;, adoration!' he thereby places the great-grandfathers with the Svadh&acirc; in the world of the great-grandfathers.</p>

Having fetched water, he pours it (into the cups) with, 'The Fathers have drunk:' he thereby bestows food on them;--'the Fathers have enjoyed themselves:' he thereby causes them to enjoy themselves;--'the Fathers have become satisfied:' he thereby satisfies them;--'may the Fathers cleanse themselves!' he thereby purifies all of them from the first downwards, for the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; is a means of purification&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_602"></A><A HREF="#fn_600"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:10">12:8:1:10</A></FONT></span>10. With 'p&acirc;vam&acirc;n&icirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_601"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (verses)' they purify; for p&acirc;vam&acirc;n&icirc;s are a means of purification: by a means of purification they thus purify him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:11">12:8:1:11</A></FONT></span>11. With three (verses) they purify each time,--there are three vital airs, the in-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: it is by means of these that they purify him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:12">12:8:1:12</A></FONT></span>12. With nine (verses) they purify,--there are nine vital airs: by means of the vital airs they purify him, and when purified they establish him again in the vital airs.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:13">12:8:1:13</A></FONT></span>13. They purify by means of a (goat's hair and sheep's wool) strainer,--such a strainer doubtless is a form (symbol) of goats and sheep: by means of goats and sheep they thus purify him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:14">12:8:1:14</A></FONT></span>14. They purify by means of a tail-whisk,--such a tail-whisk doubtless is a form of kine and horses: with kine and horses they thus purify him.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:16">12:8:1:16</A></FONT></span>16. They purify him by means of Sur&acirc;-liquor, for the Sur&acirc; is purified: they thus purify him by that which is purified; and even as the liquor, whilst being purified, is cleared of impure matter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_604"></A><A HREF="#fn_602"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, so is that Sacrificer thereby freed from all evil who, knowing this, performs the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc;, or who even knows this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:17">12:8:1:17</A></FONT></span>17. Here, now, they ask, 'Is the Sautr&acirc;ma<I>n</I>&icirc; to be performed, or is it not to be performed, seeing that (in any case) they continuously repel from him all evil?' As to this Revottaras Sthapati P&acirc;<I>t</I>ava K&acirc;kra once said, 'Even after making the surrender, one ought certainly to perform the sacrifice; for the Sacrificer is the body of the sacrifice, and the officiating priests are its limbs; and wherever the body is pure there the limbs also are pure; both of them, indeed, purify him, and both of them repel the evil from him: therefore even after making the surrender (of one's own self) one ought certainly to sacrifice.'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:18">12:8:1:18</A></FONT></span>18. But, indeed, those who perform at the southern fire, go down to the world of the Fathers. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being (material of) sacrifice, it is by sacrifice that they establish themselves in the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:19">12:8:1:19</A></FONT></span>19. He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIX, 45), 'The Fathers who, one in form and one in mind, live in Yama's realm,--may their world,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_237"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 237</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Svadh&acirc;, adoration, and sacrifice prosper among the gods!' he thereby commits the Fathers to Yama, and he also conquers the world of the Fathers. Having, all of them, invested themselves sacrificially&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_605"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, they betake themselves to the northern fire, for the northern fire&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_606"></A><A HREF="#fn_604"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is this (terrestrial) world&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_607"></A><A HREF="#fn_605"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>: they thus establish themselves in this world. He offers an oblation of ghee: ghee being sacrifice, it is from out of the sacrifice that they establish themselves in the sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:20">12:8:1:20</A></FONT></span>20. He (the Sacrificer) offers, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIX, 46), 'Mine own (people) who are one in form and one in mind, living among the living,--may their fortune prosper with me, in this world, for a hundred years!' he thereby secures the good fortune of his own people, and he also confers long life on them. Whilst they hold on to each other, he (the Adhvaryu) offers milk, for milk is vital air and food: in the vital air, in food, they thus finally establish themselves.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:21">12:8:1:21</A></FONT></span>21. He offers, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIX, 47), 'Two paths for mortals have I heard of, (that of the Fathers and that of the gods&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_606"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>),'--'two paths</p>

<p>indeed there are,' they say, 'those of the gods and of the Fathers,'--'thereon all that liveth here passeth,' for thereon, indeed, everything living here passes;--'what there is between the father and the mother,'--the father, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the mother is this (earth): by means of these two he leads the Fathers to the world of heaven. He (the Sacrificer) alone drinks what is left from the offering&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_607"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: to himself alone he thus takes prosperity, for milk is prosperity.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="12:8:1:22">12:8:1:22</A></FONT></span>22. He drinks it, with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XIX, 48), 'May this oblation be productive for me,'--for productive indeed it is, whether it be milk or Soma;--'possessed of ten heroes,'--the ten heroes, doubtless, are the vital airs: vital airs he thus takes to himself;--'possessed of all the troops,'--all the troops, doubtless, are the limbs: it is limbs he thus takes to himself;--'for well-being: breath-winning,'--the breath of life he thus wins;--'race-winning,'--a race (offspring) he thus wins;--'cattle-winning,'--cattle he thus wins;--'place-winning'--for it is for a place (in heaven) that he sacrifices: it is that he gains;--'safety-winning,'--the (place of) safety, doubtless, is the heavenly world: in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes himself;--'May Agni raise for me abundant offspring,</p>

<p>and bestow ye upon us food, milk, and seed!' it is to those (priests) who offer for him that he thus says, 'Bestow ye all this upon me!' By means of gold they cleanse themselves&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_610"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for gold is immortal life: in immortal life they thus finally establish themselves.</p>
