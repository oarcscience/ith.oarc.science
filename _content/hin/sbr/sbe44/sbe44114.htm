The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, were contending for (the possession of) this (terrestrial) world. The gods drove out the Asuras, their rivals and enemies, from this world; whence those who</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_430"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 430</FONT></A></p>  
<p>are godly people make their sepulchres so as not to be separate (from the earth), whilst those (people) who are of the Asura nature, the Easterns and others, (make their sepulchral mounds) so as to be separated (from the earth), either on a basin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1147"></A><A HREF="#fn_1139"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> or on some such thing.</p>

With a formula he sets up those, silently these: he thus keeps separate what refers to the gods and what refers to the Fathers. With (an) undefined (number of stones he encloses it), for undefined is yonder world.</p>

He then sweeps that (site) with a pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a (Butea frondosa) branch--what the sweeping (signified) on that occasion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1149"></A><A HREF="#fn_1141"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that (it does) here--with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, I), 'Let the niggards avaunt from hence, the perverse scorners of the gods!'--he thereby expels from this world the niggards, the perverse haters of the gods, the Asura-Rakshas;--'it is the place of this Soma-offerer,' for he who has performed a Soma-sacrifice is a Soma-offerer;--'(an abode) distinguished by lights, by days, by nights,'--he thereby makes him to</p>

'May Yama grant him an abode;'--for Yama has power over the abode in this (earth), and it is him he solicits for an abode therein for this (dead man). He throws out this (branch) to the right (south), the other&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1150"></A><A HREF="#fn_1142"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to the left (north) side: he thus keeps the divine separate from what belongs to the Fathers.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:2:5">13:8:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. He (the Adhvaryu) then yokes (the team) to the plough on the south side,--some say on the north side: he may do as he chooses. Having given the order, saying, 'Yoke!' he (the Sacrificer) utters the formula (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXXV, 2), 'May Savit<I>ri</I> vouchsafe for thy bones a place in the earth!'--Savit<I>ri</I> now indeed vouchsafes a place in the earth for his (the deceased man's) bones;--'Let the oxen be yoked therefore!' for it is indeed for this work that the oxen are yoked.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:2:6">13:8:2:6</A></FONT></span>6. It is (a team) of six oxen,--six seasons are a year: on the seasons, on the year, as a firm foundation, he thus establishes him. Having turned round (the plough) from right to left&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1151"></A><A HREF="#fn_1143"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, he ploughs the first furrow with (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S.

Four furrows he ploughs with a formula: he thereby establishes him in whatever food there is in the four quarters. And (as to why it is done) with a formula,--certain, assuredly, is the sacrificial formula (ya<I>g</I>us), and certain are these quarters.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:8:2:8">13:8:2:8</A></FONT></span>8.

Having performed the work for which he has put the team to that (plough), he now unfastens it: 'Let the oxen be unyoked!' he says, for it is for that work that the oxen were yoked. To the right (south) side&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1146"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he removes this (plough and team), to the left (side) arty other: he thus keeps the divine separate from what' belongs to the Fathers.</p>
