### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:1">11:7:2:1</span></span>1. Now
there is one animal sacrifice of the Havirya*gñ*a order <span
id="fr_369"></span>[3](#fn_369), and another of the order of the
Soma-sacrifice. Of the Havirya*gñ*a order is that at which he (the
Adhvaryu) brings him fast-food <span id="fr_370"></span>[4](#fn_370),
leads water

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

forward <span id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_371), and pours out a jarful of
water <span id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_372), and at which (the
Sacrificer) strides the Vish*n*u-strides <span
id="fr_373"></span>[3](#fn_373); and of the order of the Soma-sacrifice
is that (animal sacrifice) at which these (rites) are not performed.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:2">11:7:2:2</span></span>2.
Concerning this they ask, 'Is the animal sacrifice an ish*t*i or a great
(Soma-) sacrifice?'--'A great sacrifice,' let him say; 'for in that
(other) case <span id="fr_374"></span>[4](#fn_374) thou hast made the
animal sacrifice an ish*t*i, and shattered it.' Thus he should say to
him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:3">11:7:2:3</span></span>3. Its
fore-offerings are the morning-service <span
id="fr_375"></span>[5](#fn_375), its after-offerings the
evening-service, and its sacrificial cake <span
id="fr_376"></span>[6](#fn_376) the midday-service.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:4">11:7:2:4</span></span>4. Now,
some bring up the Dakshi*n*âs (presents to the priests) when the omentum
has been offered <span id="fr_377"></span>[7](#fn_377);

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

but let him not do so, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him,
'Surely, this (Sacrificer) has brought the Dakshi*n*âs outside of the
vital airs (or, of life), he has not strengthened his vital airs: he
will become either blind, or lame, or deaf, or paralyzed on one side;'
then that would indeed he likely to come to pass.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:5">11:7:2:5</span></span>5. Let
him perform it in this way:--when the I*d*â of the cake-offering has
been invoked, he should bring up the Dakshi*n*âs; for to Indra belongs
this vital air in the centre (of the body): by means of the Dakshi*n*âs
he thus strengthens this vital air in the centre (of the body); and to
Indra also belongs the midday Soma-service, and at the midday-service
the Dakshi*n*âs are brought up: therefore. he should bring up the
Dakshi*n*âs after the invocation of the I*d*â of the cake-offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:6">11:7:2:6</span></span>6. Here
now they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath in the case
of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou initiate him?'
Well, let them <span id="fr_378"></span>[1](#fn_378) sustain him till
the purificatory bath,--to wit, the Adhvaryu, the Pratiprasthât*ri*, the
Hot*ri*, the Maitrâvaru*n*a, the Brahman, and the

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Âgnîdhra, for it
is through these that this (formula) is called 'sha*ddh*ot*ri* <span
id="fr_379"></span>[1](#fn_379)': having rapidly muttered that
'sha*ddh*ot*ri*,' he offers, performing either one or five oblations of
ghee <span id="fr_380"></span>[2](#fn_380),--'The heaven is his <span
id="fr_381"></span>[3](#fn_381) back, the air his body, O Vâ*k*aspati,
by his limbs he gave rise to the sacrifice, by his forms to the earth;
by his flawless voice and his flawless tongue to the god-gladdening
invocation, Hail!' This, indeed, is his initiation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:7">11:7:2:7</span></span>7. As
to this they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath in the
case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou take him
down to the purificatory bath?' Well, when they perform with the
heart-spit <span id="fr_382"></span>[4](#fn_382), that is his
purificatory bath.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:7:2:8">11:7:2:8</span></span>8.
Madhuka Paiṅgya once said, 'Some perform the animal sacrifice without
Soma, and others do so with Soma. Now, Soma was in the heavens, and
Gâyatrî, having become a bird, fetched him; and inasmuch as one of his
leaves (par*n*a) was cut off <span id="fr_383"></span>[5](#fn_383),

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

that was how the Par*n*a-tree arose:' such, indeed, is (the passage in)
the Brâhma*n*a that is told. And some, it is true, perform the animal
sacrifice without Soma, and others with Soma; for he who makes the
sacrificial stake other than of Palâ*s*a wood, performs the animal
sacrifice without Soma; and he who makes the sacrificial stake of
Palâ*s*a performs the animal sacrifice with Soma: therefore let him make
his sacrificial stake of Palâ*s*a wood.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_369"></span>[119:3](sbe44038.htm#fr_369) That is, the
offering of the Agnîshomîya he-goat which takes place on the day before
the press-day (see part ii, p. 162 seqq.); whilst the
Savanîya-pa*s*ubandha is performed on the day of the Soma-sacrifice
itself; the victim being slaughtered during the morning-service, and the
flesh-portions cooked during the day and offered at the evening-service
(cf. part ii, p. 313, note 3; p. 356, note 3).

<span id="fn_370"></span>[119:4](sbe44038.htm#fr_370) That is, milk from
the Vratadughâ cow (which may be mixed with some rice or barley; III, 2,
2, 14), the only food to be taken by the Sacrificer during his dîkshâ,
or period of initiation--in this case on the day before the
Soma-sacrifice.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[120:1](sbe44038.htm#fr_371) That is, the
so-called 'pra*n*îtâ*h*' used for sacrificial purposes generally, and
especially for supplying what is required for pressing the Soma. Cf. the
comm. on Kâty. VI, 7, 19, where the 'pra*n*îtâpra*n*ayana' is expressly
referred to as a necessary element of the performance of the
Agnîshomîya.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[120:2](sbe44038.htm#fr_372) For the pouring
out of the water on the south side of the Vedi, at the end of the
Havirya*gñ*a, see I, 9, 3, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[120:3](sbe44038.htm#fr_373) The Sacrificer
intercepts with his hands some of the water poured out, touches his face
therewith, and then strides the three Vish*n*u-strides; cf. I, 9, 3, 8
seqq.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[120:4](sbe44038.htm#fr_374) Viz. in case of
the animal sacrifice being performed on the Havirya*gñ*a or Ish*t*i
model; which, strictly speaking, would involve the use of no other
offering-material except milk, ghee, and dishes made of cereals.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[120:5](sbe44038.htm#fr_375) The usual order of
subject and predicate would require the translation, 'the
morning-service is its fore-offerings,' which would hardly be in
accordance with the author's reasoning.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[120:6](sbe44038.htm#fr_376) For the
pa*s*u-puro*d*â*s*a, III, 8, 3, 1 seqq.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[120:7](sbe44038.htm#fr_377) That is, prior to
the offering of the 'animal cake' (pa*s*u-puro*d*â*s*a), whilst the
presentation of the dakshi*n*âs--a head of cattle, or a milch-cow, or
some other desirable object--according to Kâty. VI, 7, 29, should take
place after the offering of the I*d*â, which marks the end of the
Pa*s*u-puro*d*â*s*a-ish*t*i.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[121:1](sbe44038.htm#fr_378) Sâya*n*a supplies
'*g*anâ*h*,' 'the people;' but possibly the text of the commentary may
be corrupt in this place. The author's meaning would seem to be that, as
there is no purificatory bath at the end of the animal sacrifice
performed on the Soma-day, the Sacrificer's strength is to be kept up by
the Sha*ddh*ot*ri* formula (representing the six priests themselves)
which will carry him as far as the purificatory bath at the end of the
Soma-sacrifice. I am, however, far from sure that this is the real
meaning of the passage. The Sha*ddh*ot*ri* is performed (at the animal
sacrifice of the pressing-day) shortly after the beginning of the
ceremonies connected with the Pa*s*ubandha, viz. immediately after the
'yûpâhuti,' see part ii, p. 162 seqq.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[122:1](sbe44038.htm#fr_379) That is, one
containing (mentioning), or requiring, six offering-priests, the number
required for the animal sacrifice.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[122:2](sbe44038.htm#fr_380) In either case the
offering consists of five ladlings of ghee; and in the case of a single
oblation, according to Sâya*n*a, a different dipping-spoon (sruva) would
seem to be used for each ladling; unless, indeed, 'ekaikena sruvena'
mean 'with one sruva-full each.' According to Kâty. VI, 1, 36, the
formula is merely 'run through mentally.'

<span id="fn_381"></span>[122:3](sbe44038.htm#fr_381) Sâya*n*a
interprets 'thy back'; and he apparently supplies 'prâpnoti' at the end
of the first half-verse, whilst 'airayat' he takes to stand for the
second person singular.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[122:4](sbe44038.htm#fr_382) That is, when the
heart is roasted on the spit prior to its being offered; see III, 8, 3,
16. This use of the spit is to take the place of the purificatory bath,
the technical term of which is 'spit-bath' (*s*ûlâvabh*ri*tha), the spit
being on that occasion buried at the point where the dry and the moist
meet,' see III, 8, 5, 8-10.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[122:5](sbe44038.htm#fr_383) Either a leaf of
Soma or a feather of Gâyatrî was cut off by an <span id="page_123">p.
123</span> arrow shot by an archer pursuing Gâyatrî, and, on its falling
to the earth, a Palâ*s*a, or Par*n*a, tree (Butea frondosa) sprang
forth, see III, 3, 4, 10.
