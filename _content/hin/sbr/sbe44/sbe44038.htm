Concerning this they ask, 'Is the animal sacrifice an ish<I>t</I>i or a great (Soma-) sacrifice?'--'A great sacrifice,' let him say; 'for in that (other) case&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_374"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> thou hast made the animal sacrifice an ish<I>t</I>i, and shattered it.'

<p>but let him not do so, for if, in that case, any one were to say of him, 'Surely, this (Sacrificer) has brought the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s outside of the vital airs (or, of life), he has not strengthened his vital airs: he will become either blind, or lame, or deaf, or paralyzed on one side;' then that would indeed he likely to come to pass.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:7:2:5">11:7:2:5</A></FONT></span>5. Let him perform it in this way:--when the I<I>d</I>&acirc; of the cake-offering has been invoked, he should bring up the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s; for to Indra belongs this vital air in the centre (of the body): by means of the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s he thus strengthens this vital air in the centre (of the body); and to Indra also belongs the midday Soma-service, and at the midday-service the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s are brought up: therefore. he should bring up the Dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s after the invocation of the I<I>d</I>&acirc; of the cake-offering.</p>

As to this they say, 'Seeing that the want of the purificatory bath in the case of the initiated is improper, Adhvaryu, when didst thou take him down to the purificatory bath?'

Madhuka Pai&#7749;gya once said, 'Some perform the animal sacrifice without Soma, and others do so with Soma.

<p>that was how the Par<I>n</I>a-tree arose:' such, indeed, is (the passage in) the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a that is told. And some, it is true, perform the animal sacrifice without Soma, and others with Soma; for he who makes the sacrificial stake other than of Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a wood, performs the animal sacrifice without Soma; and he who makes the sacrificial stake of Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a performs the animal sacrifice with Soma: therefore let him make his sacrificial stake of Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a wood.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_370"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_370">119:4</A> That is, milk from the Vratadugh&acirc; cow (which may be mixed with some rice or barley; III, 2, 2, 14), the only food to be taken by the Sacrificer during his d&icirc;ksh&acirc;, or period of initiation--in this case on the day before the Soma-sacrifice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_371"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_371">120:1</A> That is, the so-called 'pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;<I>h</I>' used for sacrificial purposes generally, and especially for supplying what is required for pressing the Soma. Cf. the comm. on K&acirc;ty. VI, 7, 19, where the 'pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc;pra<I>n</I>ayana' is expressly referred to as a necessary element of the performance of the Agn&icirc;shom&icirc;ya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_372"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_372">120:2</A> For the pouring out of the water on the south side of the Vedi, at the end of the Havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, see I, 9, 3, 1 seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_373"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_373">120:3</A> The Sacrificer intercepts with his hands some of the water poured out, touches his face therewith, and then strides the three Vish<I>n</I>u-strides; cf. I, 9, 3, 8 seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_374"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_374">120:4</A> Viz. in case of the animal sacrifice being performed on the Havirya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a or Ish<I>t</I>i model; which, strictly speaking, would involve the use of no other offering-material except milk, ghee, and dishes made of cereals.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_375"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_375">120:5</A> The usual order of subject and predicate would require the translation, 'the morning-service is its fore-offerings,' which would hardly be in accordance with the author's reasoning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_376"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_376">120:6</A> For the pa<I>s</I>u-puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>a, III, 8, 3, 1 seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_377"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_377">120:7</A> That is, prior to the offering of the 'animal cake' (pa<I>s</I>u-puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>a), whilst the presentation of the dakshi<I>n</I>&acirc;s--a head of cattle, or a milch-cow, or some other desirable object--according to K&acirc;ty. VI, 7, 29, should take place after the offering of the I<I>d</I>&acirc;, which marks the end of the Pa<I>s</I>u-puro<I>d</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>a-ish<I>t</I>i.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_378"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_378">121:1</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a supplies '<I>g</I>an&acirc;<I>h</I>,' 'the people;' but possibly the text of the commentary may be corrupt in this place. The author's meaning would seem to be that, as there is no purificatory bath at the end of the animal sacrifice performed on the Soma-day, the Sacrificer's strength is to be kept up by the Sha<I>d</I><I>dh</I>ot<I>ri</I> formula (representing the six priests themselves) which will carry him as far as the purificatory bath at the end of the Soma-sacrifice. I am, however, far from sure that this is the real meaning of the passage. The Sha<I>d</I><I>dh</I>ot<I>ri</I> is performed (at the animal sacrifice of the pressing-day) shortly after the beginning of the ceremonies connected with the Pa<I>s</I>ubandha, viz. immediately after the 'y&ucirc;p&acirc;huti,' see part ii, p. 162 seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_379"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_379">122:1</A> That is, one containing (mentioning), or requiring, six offering-priests, the number required for the animal sacrifice.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_380"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_380">122:2</A> In either case the offering consists of five ladlings of ghee; and in the case of a single oblation, according to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, a different dipping-spoon (sruva) would seem to be used for each ladling; unless, indeed, 'ekaikena sruvena' mean 'with one sruva-full each.' According to K&acirc;ty. VI, 1, 36, the formula is merely 'run through mentally.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_381"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_381">122:3</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a interprets 'thy back'; and he apparently supplies 'pr&acirc;pnoti' at the end of the first half-verse, whilst 'airayat' he takes to stand for the second person singular.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_382"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_382">122:4</A> That is, when the heart is roasted on the spit prior to its being offered; see III, 8, 3, 16. This use of the spit is to take the place of the purificatory bath, the technical term of which is 'spit-bath' (<I>s</I>&ucirc;l&acirc;vabh<I>ri</I>tha), the spit being on that occasion buried at the point where the dry and the moist meet,' see III, 8, 5, 8-10.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_383"></A><A HREF="sbe44038.htm#fr_383">122:5</A> Either a leaf of Soma or a feather of G&acirc;yatr&icirc; was cut off by an <A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A> arrow shot by an archer pursuing G&acirc;yatr&icirc;, and, on its falling to the earth, a Pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a, or Par<I>n</I>a, tree (Butea frondosa) sprang forth, see III, 3, 4, 10.</P>
