The two attendants&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_162"></A><A HREF="#fn_162"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are the day and night; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the day and night of him whoso knows that the two attendants are the day and night; and all that is done in the day and night comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:6">11:2:7:6</A></FONT></span>6. The first kindling-verse is this (earth), the second the fire, the third the wind, the fourth the air, the fifth the sky, the sixth the sun, the seventh the moon, the eighth the mind, the ninth speech, the tenth fervid devotion, and the eleventh the Brahman; for it is these that kindle all this (universe), and by them all this (universe) is kindled, whence they are called kindling-verses.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:10">11:2:7:10</A></FONT></span>10. The first fore-offering is brilliance, the second honour, the third fame, the fourth holy lustre, the fifth food (prosperity).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:11">11:2:7:11</A></FONT></span>11.

The cake offered to Agni is the Brahman (priesthood); and, verily, whosoever knows Agni's cake to be the priesthood secures for himself the priesthood; and whatever is to be gained by the priesthood all that he now gains.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:15">11:2:7:15</A></FONT></span>15. The low-voiced offering is the Kshatra (nobility); and, verily, whosoever knows the low-voiced offering to be the nobility secures for himself the nobility; and whatever is to be gained by the nobility all that he now gains. And inasmuch as some perform the low-voiced offering, and others do not. therefore people speak (give information) to the noble both in a loud voice and in a low voice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:16">11:2:7:16</A></FONT></span>16. The second cake is the Vi<I>s</I> (people); and, verily, whosoever knows the second cake to be the people secures for himself the people; and whatever is to be gained by the people all that he gains. And inasmuch as Agni's cake and the low-voiced offering come first therefore the priesthood and nobility are established upon the people.</p>

The S&acirc;nn&acirc;yya&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is royal dignity; and, verily, whosoever knows the S&acirc;nn&acirc;yya to be royal dignity secures for himself royal dignity; and whatever is to be gained by royal dignity all that he gains. And inasmuch as some pour (sweet and sour milk) together&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and others do not, therefore the royal dignity both (combines) together and (keeps) asunder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>.</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>secures for himself fervid devotion; and whatever is to be gained by fervid devotion all that he now gains.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:19">11:2:7:19</A></FONT></span>19. The fore-portion is the place (in heaven); and, verily, whosoever knows the fore-portion to be the place (in heaven) secures for himself the place (in heaven); and whatever is to be gained by the place (in heaven) all that he now gains; and, indeed, he does not by ever so little fall from his place, for it is by ever so little that in yonder world men fall from their place; and whosoever knows this does not fall from his place however much evil he may have done.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:20">11:2:7:20</A></FONT></span>20. The I<I>d</I>&acirc; is faith; and, verily, whosoever knows the I<I>d</I>&acirc; to be faith secures for himself faith, and whatever is to be gained by faith all that he now gains.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:21">11:2:7:21</A></FONT></span>21. The first after-offering is the thunderbolt, the second the hail-stone, the third the (heavenly) firebrand (meteor).</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:22">11:2:7:22</A></FONT></span>22. After the first after-offering let him utter (the anumantra<I>n</I>a), 'O thunderbolt, smite N.N.!' (naming) him whom he hates; after the second, O hail-stone, smite N.N.!' after the third, 'O firebrand, smite N.N.!'</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:23">11:2:7:23</A></FONT></span>23. And if such a one dies suddenly, then, indeed, it is that after-offering, the thunderbolt, that smites him; and if he is, as it were, covered with out-flowing (blood), then it is that after-offering, the hail-stone, that smites him; and if he is, as it were, covered with scorching, then it is that after-offering, the (heavenly) firebrand, that smites him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:24">11:2:7:24</A></FONT></span>24. Such is the bolt of the sacrifice: it was by that bolt, indeed, that the gods overcame the Asuras;</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_43"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 43</FONT></A></p>  
<p>and in like manner does the Sacrificer who knows this overcome his wicked, spiteful enemy.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:25">11:2:7:25</A></FONT></span>25. And if the sacrifice were to end with after-offerings, then it would end with the thunderbolt, the hail-stone, and the (heavenly) firebrand: therefore the sacrifice of the gods ends either with the I<I>d</I>&acirc; or with the <I>S</I>amyos.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:26">11:2:7:26</A></FONT></span>26. By the fore-offerings, indeed, the gods reached the world of heaven. The Asuras tried to get thither after them; and by the after-offerings they (the gods) drove them back: thus, when the after-offerings are performed, the Sacrificer drives back his wicked, spiteful enemy.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:27">11:2:7:27</A></FONT></span>27. The fore-offerings, indeed, are the out-breathings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and the after-offerings the off-breathings wherefore the fore-offerings are poured out in a forward direction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for that is the form of the out-breathing; and the after-offerings (are poured out) in a backward direction&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, for that is the form of the off-breathing. The after-offerings, indeed, are the Upasads&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Full and New-moon sacrifices, whence they are performed in a backward direction after the manner of the Upasads.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:28">11:2:7:28</A></FONT></span>28. The S&ucirc;ktav&acirc;ka is the completion; and, verily, whosoever knows the S&ucirc;ktav&acirc;ka to be the completion secures for himself the completion; and whatever is to be gained by the completion all that he now gains: he obtains the completion of his (full) lifetime.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:29">11:2:7:29</A></FONT></span>29. The <I>S</I>amyorv&acirc;ka is the resting-place; and, verily, whosoever knows the <I>S</I>amyuv&acirc;ka to be the resting-place secures for himself a resting-place; and whatever is to be gained by a resting-place all that he now gains: he reaches a resting-place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:30">11:2:7:30</A></FONT></span>30. The gods fortified the Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as by a mound from behind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, and placed a couple thereon for the sake of procreation: thus when the Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as are performed, he places a couple thereon for the sake of procreation; for, indeed, after the procreation of the gods offspring is produced, and offspring is produced by pair after pair (of men and beasts) for him who knows this.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:31">11:2:7:31</A></FONT></span>31. The Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us is food; and, verily, whosoever knows the Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us to be food secures for himself food; and whatever is to be gained by food all that he now gains.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:32">11:2:7:32</A></FONT></span>32. The Sacrificer is the Year; and the Seasons officiate for him. The &Acirc;gn&icirc;dhra is the Spring,</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></p>  
<p>whence forest-fires take place in spring, for that is a form of Agni. The Adhvaryu is the Summer, for summer is, as it were, scorched; and the Adhvaryu comes forth (from the sacrificial ground) like something scorched&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>. The Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> is the Rainy season; whence, when it rains hard, a sound as that of a chant is produced. 'The Brahman is the Autumn; whence, when the corn ripens, they say, 'The creatures are rich in growth (brahma<I>n</I>vat).' The Hot<I>ri</I> is the Winter, whence in winter cattle waste away, having the Vasha<I>t</I> uttered over them. These, then, are the divinities that officiate for him; and even if Aish&acirc;v&icirc;r&acirc;<I>h</I>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> were to officiate for him, let him think in his mind of those divinities, and those deities, indeed, officiate for him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:7:33">11:2:7:33</A></FONT></span>33. Now, as to that balance, the right (south) edge of the Vedi&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. Whatever good deed man does that is inside the Vedi; and whatever evil deed he does that is outside the Vedi. Let him therefore sit down, touching the right edge of the Vedi; for, indeed, they place him on the balance in yonder world; and whichever of the two will rise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> that he will follow, whether it be the good or the evil. And, verily, whosoever knows this, mounts the balance even in this world, and escapes being placed on the balance in yonder world; for his good deed rises, and not his evil deed.</p>
