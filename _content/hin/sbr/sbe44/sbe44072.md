### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:1">12:9:2:1</span></span>1.
Having performed the sacrifice they betake themselves to the
purificatory bath; for after a Soma-sacrifice they do betake themselves
to the purificatory bath, and the Sautrâma*n*î is the same as the Soma
(sacrifice).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:2">12:9:2:2</span></span>2. \[He
plunges the mash-pot into the water, with Vâ*g*. S. XX, 14-18 <span
id="fr_664"></span>[1](#fn_660),\] 'Whatever contumely

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

against the gods, O divine gods, we have committed, from that sin may
Agni deliver me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--he thereby
delivers him from the sin committed against the gods.--'Whether by day,
whether by night we have committed sins, from that sin may Vâyu deliver
me; may he deliver me from all trouble!'--he thereby delivers him from
whatever sin he commits by day and night.---'Whether waking, whether in
sleep we have committed sins, from that sin may Sûrya deliver me; may he
deliver me from all trouble!'--what is awake is men, and what is asleep
is the Fathers: he thus delivers him from guilt against men and Fathers.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:3">12:9:2:3</span></span>3.
'Whatever sin we have committed in the village, in the forest'--for
either in the village or in the forest sin is committed: therefrom he
delivers him;--'whatever in the assembly'--from the sin of the assembly
he thereby delivers him;--'whatever in our organs of sense'--from the
sin against the gods he thereby delivers him;--'whatever against the
*S*ûdra or the Arya, whatever against the right of any one, thereof thou
art the expiation,'--from all that sin he thereby delivers him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:4">12:9:2:4</span></span>4.
'That we swear by the Inviolable Waters <span
id="fr_665"></span>[1](#fn_661), by Varu*n*a, therefrom deliver us, O
Varu*n*a!'--he thereby delivers him from sin against Varu*n*a.\[He then
immerses the pot, with Vâ*g*. S. XII, 18; 19,\]

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'O laving bath,
laving thou glidest along,'--the bath, indeed, is that whirlpool (now
produced) in the water, and that indeed is either Varu*n*a's son or
brother: it is him he thereby praises;--'with the help of the gods have
I expiated <span id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_662) the sin committed
against gods,'--he thereby expiates the sin committed against
gods;--'with the help of mortals that committed against mortals,'--he
thereby expiates the sin committed against mortals;--'preserve me, O
God, from injury from the fiercely-howling (demon)!' whereby he means to
say, 'Protect me against all inflictions!'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:5">12:9:2:5</span></span>5. 'In
the ocean, in the waters, is thy heart,'--for the ocean is the waters,
and water is sap: with that sap he thus supplies him;--'may the plants
and waters unite with thee!'--he thereby supplies him with both kinds of
sap, that which is in plants, and that which is in water--He goes two
steps northward from out (of the water); for as much as the step is the
briskness in man: with what briskness there is in him he thus leaves
evil behind him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:6">12:9:2:6</span></span>6.
With, 'May the waters and plants be friendly unto us!' he takes water in
his joined hands; for water is a thunderbolt: he thus makes a covenant
with the thunderbolt;--and with, 'May they he unfriendly unto him who
hateth us, and whom we hate!' let him sprinkle it in whatever direction
he who is hateful to him may be, and he thereby discomfits him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:7">12:9:2:7</span></span>7. With
(Vâ*g*. S. XX, 20), 'As one set free (is liberated) from the stake, as
he who sweateth

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (is cleansed) from
filth by bathing, as the ghee is purified by the strainer, so may the
waters cleanse me from sin!' he causes his garment to float away: even
as one would pluck out a reed from its sheath, so he plucks him from out
all evil. He bathes, and (thereby) drives the darkness (of sin) from
himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:8">12:9:2:8</span></span>8. \[He
comes out <span id="fr_667"></span>[1](#fn_663), with Vâ*g*. S. XX,
21,\] 'From out of the gloom have we risen,'--gloom is evil: it is
gloom, evil, he thus keeps away;--'beholding the higher light <span
id="fr_668"></span>[2](#fn_664),'--this (terrestrial) world is higher
than the water: it is on this world he thus establishes himself;--'God
Sûrya, with the gods, the highest light,'--Sûrya, the highest light
(*g*yotis), is the heavenly world: it is in the heavenly world he thus
finally establishes himself. He walks along without looking back, and
approaches the Âhavanîya,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:9">12:9:2:9</span></span>9. With
(Vâ*g*. S. XX, 22), 'Along the waters have I gone this day,'--the
essence of the waters he thereby secures for himself;---'with their
essence have we united,'--the essence of the waters he thus takes to
himself;--'rich in sap, O Agni, have I come: do thou unite (supply) me
with splendour, with offspring, and with wealth!' he thereby invokes a
blessing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:10">12:9:2:10</span></span>10.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XX, 23), 'A kindler thou art:

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

may we prosper <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_665)!' he takes a
kindling-stick, for a kindler of Agni (the fire) the kindling-stick
indeed is. With, 'Enkindling thou art, fire thou art: lay thou fire into
me!' he puts the kindling-stick on the Âhavanîya: he thereby kindles the
fire, and, thus kindled, it kindles him with fire (energy) <span
id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_666).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:11">12:9:2:11</span></span>11.
Being about to offer a pap to Aditi <span
id="fr_671"></span>[3](#fn_667), he prepares it: Aditi being this
(earth), he who offers Aditi's (pap) performs the sacrifice on this
(earth), and by offering firmly establishes himself thereon. The
sacrificial fee is a milch cow (with calf): the milch cow being this
(earth), he milks out from the latter all his desires. The calf he gives
away at the former (pap-offering to Aditi <span
id="fr_672"></span>[4](#fn_668)), and the mother-cow at the latter; for
when a calf sucks the mother-cow, the latter gives milk when she is
given away, and from her, when given away, he thus milks all his
desires.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:9:2:12">12:9:2:12</span></span>12.
As to this they say, 'Surely, he who goes down to the water for the
purificatory bath falls away from this world!' Well, when he has come
out from the bath, he offers a dish of curds to Mitra and Varu*n*a; now
Mitra is this (terrestrial) world,

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Varu*n*a yonder
world, and the dish of curds is what there is here between (those two):
thus, when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varu*n*a, he
establishes himself in these worlds. And Mitra, indeed, is the
in-breathing, Varu*n*a the off-breathing, and the dish of curds the
food: thus when he offers the dish of curds to Mitra and Varu*n*a, he
finally establishes himself in the vital air, in food.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_660"></span>[264:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_664) Of the first three
verses the text quotes only the first pâda, the rest having been
supplied in the translation.

<span id="fn_661"></span>[265:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_665) Cf. III, 8, 5, 10,
where the text varies slightly--'That they say, we swear by the
Inviolable (cows, or waters), by Varu*n*a, therefrom deliver us, O
Varu*n*a!'

<span id="fn_662"></span>[266:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_666) Cf. II, 5, 2, 47;
IV, 4, 5, 22, where the formula has 'ava ayâsisham' (correct,--'with the
help of the gods have I wiped out the sin committed against the gods')
instead of 'ava yakshi.'

<span id="fn_663"></span>[267:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_667) Having put on
fresh garments, the Sacrificer and his wife are led out by the
Unnet*ri*, the mantra being muttered at the same time; and they then
return with the priests to the offering-ground, whilst the Âmatrîyâ-hymn
(on *Ri*g-veda S. VIII, 48, 3, 'we have drunk Soma . . .') is sung: see
part ii, p. 385, note 2; Kâty. *S*raut. X, 9, 7.

<span id="fn_664"></span>[267:2](sbe44072.htm#fr_668) Mahîdhara takes
'svar' in the sense of 'svarga,' heaven; whilst the Brâhma*n*a seems
rather to take it as referring to the earth or dry land on which the
Sacrificer now steps.

<span id="fn_665"></span>[268:1](sbe44072.htm#fr_669) The text of the
formula 'edho<sup>ऽ</sup>sy edhishîmahi' is evidently meant to suggest a
connection (real or alliterative) between 'edha' (root 'indh') and the
final verb (root 'edh').

<span id="fn_666"></span>[268:2](sbe44072.htm#fr_670) According to Kâty.
XIX, 5, 20, and Mahîdhara, he now offers on the kindling-stick an
oblation of ghee, with the text, Vâ*g*. S. XX, 23, 'Hither come the
earth, the dawn, the sun, and all this world.'

<span id="fn_667"></span>[268:3](sbe44072.htm#fr_671) See [p.
213](sbe44064.htm#page_213), note [2](sbe44065.htm#fn_564).

<span id="fn_668"></span>[268:4](sbe44072.htm#fr_672) This offering
takes place at the beginning of the performance of the Sautrâma*n*î, cf.
Kâty. *S*r. XIX, 1, 5-10. The dish of curds which according to this
paragraph is to follow the second pap to Aditi, may, according to
Kâtyâyana, be offered before it.
