### FOURTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:1">11:2:4:1</span></span>1. The
full moon, doubtless, is the same as that burning (sun), for he, indeed,
is full day by day; and the new moon (dar*s*a) is the same as the moon,
for he appears (dar*s*), as it were.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:2">11:2:4:2</span></span>2. But
they also say inversely, 'The full moon is the same as the moon, for
after the filling up of the latter there is the night of full moon;' and
the new moon (dar*s*a) is the same as that burning (sun), for the latter
appears, as it were.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:3">11:2:4:3</span></span>3. The
full moon, indeed, is this (earth), for she is, as it were, full; and
the new moon is yonder sky, for yonder sky appears (or, is seen), as it
were.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:4">11:2:4:4</span></span>4. The
full moon, indeed, is the night, for this

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

night is, as it were, full; and the new moon is the day, for this day
appears, as it were. This, then, is the theory regarding the full and
new moon in respect of the gods.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:5">11:2:4:5</span></span>5. Then
as to the body. The full moon is the up-breathing, for it is by the
up-breathing <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143) that this man is, as
it were, filled; and the new moon is the out (and in)-breathing <span
id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_144), for this out-breathing appears, as it
were: thus, the full and new moon are these two, the eater and the giver
of food.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:6">11:2:4:6</span></span>6. The
out (and in)-breathing (the mouth) is the eater of food, for by means of
the out (and in)-breathing this food is eaten; and the up-breathing is
the giver of food, for by the up-breathing <span
id="fr_145"></span>[3](#fn_145) this food is given to him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:7">11:2:4:7</span></span>7. The
full moon is the mind, for full, as it were, is this mind; and the new
moon is speech, for this speech appears, as it were. Thus these two are
clearly the full and new moon, as regards the body; and inasmuch as on
the day of fasting he eats the (food) suitable for eating on the vow, he
thereby clearly gratifies these two in regard to the body; and on the
morrow (he gratifies them) as gods by sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:8">11:2:4:8</span></span>8. As
to this they say,--'Seeing that no offering-material is taken out "for
the full moon," nor any offering-material "for the new moon," and seeing
that he does not say, "Recite the invitatory formula for the full moon,"
nor "Recite the invitatory formula

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

for the new moon;" nor "Recite the offering-formula for the full moon,"
nor "Recite the offering-formula for the new moon," how, then, is
offering made to this full and new moon?' Well, when he makes a libation
of ghee to the Mind--the full moon being the Mind--he thereby makes
offering to the full moon; and when he makes a libation of ghee to
Speech--the new moon being Speech--he thereby makes offering to the new
moon: and thus offering is made by him to the full and new moon.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:9">11:2:4:9</span></span>9. Now,
some prepare two messes of rice, one for Sarasvat on the full moon, and
one for Sarasvatî on the new moon, saying, 'We thus clearly make
offering to the full and new moon.' But let him not do this; for
Sarasvat is the Mind, and Sarasvatî is Speech; and thus, in making
libations of ghee to these two, offering is made by him to the full and
new moon: let him therefore not prepare these two messes of rice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:4:10">11:2:4:10</span></span>10.
As to this they say, 'Surely, he who performs the Full and New-moon
offerings becomes a (mere) utterer of the Âgur <span
id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146); for, when he has performed

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

the Full-moon offering, he knows that he will perform the New-moon
offering; and when he has performed the New-moon offering, he knows that
he will again perform the Full-moon offering; thus when he goes to the
other world he goes thither as an utterer of the Âgur: how, then, does
he become one who has not (merely) uttered the Âgur?' Well, when, on
both occasions, he makes those two libations of ghee (to Mind and
Speech), then his Full and New-moon offerings become complete; and he
goes to the other world after his Full and New-moon offerings are
completed, and thus becomes one who has not (merely) uttered the Âgur.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_143"></span>[31:1](sbe44014.htm#fr_143) The udâna is
explained by Sâya*n*a as the breath passing (up into the head, and)
through the nose.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[31:2](sbe44014.htm#fr_144) The prâ*n*a is the
breath of the mouth.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[31:3](sbe44014.htm#fr_145) That is, by (the
vital air of) the head (hence of the eyes, ears, &c.).

<span id="fn_146"></span>[32:1](sbe44014.htm#fr_146) Or, one who has
only had the Âgur-formulas uttered for him (by the priests). Âgur is the
technical term of two formulas, viz. of the formula '(Agnim) ya*g*a'
(recite the offering-formula to Agni, or to whatever deity offering is
made), by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot*ri* to recite; and of the
formula 'Ye ya*g*âmahe (Agnim),' by which the Hot*ri* introduces the
yâ*g*yâ, or offering-verse. At the Soma-sacrifice the former formula is
modified to 'Hotâ yakshat,' uttered by the Maitrâvaru*n*a priest. See
Haug, Transl. of Ait. Br., p. 133, note.--In comparing these
Âgur-formulas with the performances of the Full and New-moon offerings,
the author thus seems to imply that, just as the utterance of these
formulas is merely the preliminary to the oblation itself, so each
fortnightly <span id="page_33">p. 33</span> performance is only the
preliminary to the next performance; but that the Sacrificer never
actually completes the sacrifice. Sâya*n*a, on the other hand, takes
'âgûrtin' to mean 'one who has formed a resolution (âgûrta, âgura*n*am =
sa*m*kalpa);' and native dictionaries, indeed, give 'âgur' as a synonym
of 'prati*gñ*â' (promise, agreement; Zuruf, Zusage). But, even if this
were the right meaning of the word, the general drift of the passage
would remain the same, viz. that such a sacrificer would ultimately die
as one who had merely promised or intended to offer sacrifice, without
his having actually performed it, or brought it to a proper conclusion,
and thus without reaping the ultimate benefit from it, viz. citizenship
in the heavenly abodes.
