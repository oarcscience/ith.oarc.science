<P><A NAME="fn_486"></A><A HREF="sbe44053.htm#fr_486">166:1</A> The Triv<I>ri</I>t, or nine-versed stoma, is, however, followed by the Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, or fifteen-versed stoma--the thirteen-versed form not being in ordinary use--and these are succeeded by the Saptada<I>s</I>a (17), Ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a (21), &amp;c. Possibly, however, this last sentence may refer to the six days of the P<I>ri</I>sh<I>th</I>ya-sha<I>d</I>aha for which the stomas consisting of 9, 25, 17, 21, 27 and 33 verses respectively are used. On the Abhi<I>g</I>it day, each of the first four stomas is used in succession for three stotras, the four hymn-forms thus making up the twelve stotras of the Agnish<I>t</I>oma. On the Vi<I>s</I>va<I>g</I>it day, on the other hand, only three stomas are used--the Triv<I>ri</I>t, Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>ada<I>s</I>a, and Saptada<I>s</I>a--four stotras being assigned to each of these three hymn-forms.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_487"></A><A HREF="sbe44053.htm#fr_487">167:1</A> Though the Mah&acirc;vrata day is actually the last day but one of the one year's sacrificial session, whilst the <I>K</I>aturvi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day is the second, these two days mark really the end and beginning of the year, whilst the nominal first and last days of the sessional performance may be considered as consisting of mere preliminary and concluding (winding-up) rites. The above symbolic identification of the Mah&acirc;vrata with the mouth of Agni-Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the Year, might thus lead one to suppose (as, indeed, is done by Prof. Hillebrandt, Die Sonnwendfeste in Alt-Indien, p. 11) that if two such annual sessions were immediately to succeed each other, the Mah&acirc;vrata and Katurvim<I>s</I>a would fall on one and the same day. The Mah&acirc;vrata, representing (at least symbolically) the winter-solstice, would thus mark both the end and the beginning of two successive solar periods.</P>
