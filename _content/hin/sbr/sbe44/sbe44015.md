### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:5:1">11:2:5:1</span></span>1. And,
verily, even on this occasion <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147),
they slaughter the sacrificial horse (A*s*vamedha) as a sacrifice to the
gods: of this (New and Full-moon sacrifice) they say, 'It is the
original (normal) A*s*vamedha;' and that (real A*s*vamedha), indeed, is
just the other (modified one); for, indeed, the A*s*vamedha is the same
as the moon.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:5:2">11:2:5:2</span></span>2. As
to this, they say, 'For each foot of the sacrificial horse they offer an
oblation;'--when he performs the Agnihotra in the evening and morning,
he offers two oblations in the evening, and two in the morning--that
makes four oblations: thus--the horse being four-footed--an oblation is
offered for each of its feet.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:5:3">11:2:5:3</span></span>3. As
to this, they say, 'On the starting off of the horse he performs an
offering <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148); for the moon, doubtless,
is the same as King Soma, the food of the gods: when, during that night
(of new moon), he does not appear either in the east or in the west,
then he comes to this world, and starts for this world <span
id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149).'

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:5:4">11:2:5:4</span></span>4. Now,
when he performs the New-moon sacrifice, he thereby performs the (same)
offering (as) on the starting of that (horse), and when he performs the
Full-moon sacrifice he slaughters the sacrificial horse itself, and,
having slaughtered it, he presents it to the gods. The other (real)
horse-sacrifice they indeed perform (only) a year after (the starting
offering), but this month (of the Full and New-moon sacrifice),
revolving, makes up a year <span id="fr_150"></span>[3](#fn_150): thus
the sacrificial horse comes to be slaughtered for him year after year.

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:2:5:5">11:2:5:5</span></span>5.
Verily, then, for him who, knowing this, offers both the Agnihotra and
the Full and New-moon sacrifices, they slaughter the sacrificial horse
month by month; and month by month the A*s*vamedha is offered for him,
and his Agnihotra and Full and New-moon sacrifices come to pass into the
A*s*vamedha.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_147"></span>[33:1](sbe44015.htm#fr_147) Viz. in performing
the Full and New-moon sacrifice, for which all the benefits accruing
from the A*s*vamedha are here claimed.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[34:1](sbe44015.htm#fr_148) According to Â*s*v.
X, 6, 2 seqq., having chosen the horse to be sacrificed, he performs two
ish*t*is, to Agni Mûrdhanvat and Pûshan; whereupon he sets free the
horse, and for a year performs three ish*t*is daily at the three
pressings, viz. to Savit*ri* Satyaprasava, Prasavit*ri*, and Âsavit*ri*.

<span id="fn_149"></span>[34:2](sbe44015.htm#fr_149) Or, he disappears
in this world; the same verb (vi-v*ri*t) being used for the
disappearance as for the starting off of the horse when set free.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[34:3](sbe44015.htm#fr_150) The syntactic
construction of the last two sentences is that frequently alluded to
before, viz. that of parenthetic causal clauses.
