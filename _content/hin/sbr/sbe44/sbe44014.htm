<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:1">11:2:4:1</A></FONT></span>1. The full moon, doubtless, is the same as that burning (sun), for he, indeed, is full day by day; and the new moon (dar<I>s</I>a) is the same as the moon, for he appears (dar<I>s</I>), as it were.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:2">11:2:4:2</A></FONT></span>2. But they also say inversely, 'The full moon is the same as the moon, for after the filling up of the latter there is the night of full moon;' and the new moon (dar<I>s</I>a) is the same as that burning (sun), for the latter appears, as it were.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:3">11:2:4:3</A></FONT></span>3. The full moon, indeed, is this (earth), for she is, as it were, full; and the new moon is yonder sky, for yonder sky appears (or, is seen), as it were.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:4">11:2:4:4</A></FONT></span>4. The full moon, indeed, is the night, for this</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_31"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>night is, as it were, full; and the new moon is the day, for this day appears, as it were. This, then, is the theory regarding the full and new moon in respect of the gods.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:5">11:2:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. Then as to the body. The full moon is the up-breathing, for it is by the up-breathing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that this man is, as it were, filled; and the new moon is the out (and in)-breathing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, for this out-breathing appears, as it were: thus, the full and new moon are these two, the eater and the giver of food.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:6">11:2:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. The out (and in)-breathing (the mouth) is the eater of food, for by means of the out (and in)-breathing this food is eaten; and the up-breathing is the giver of food, for by the up-breathing&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_145"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> this food is given to him.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:7">11:2:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. The full moon is the mind, for full, as it were, is this mind; and the new moon is speech, for this speech appears, as it were. Thus these two are clearly the full and new moon, as regards the body; and inasmuch as on the day of fasting he eats the (food) suitable for eating on the vow, he thereby clearly gratifies these two in regard to the body; and on the morrow (he gratifies them) as gods by sacrifice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:8">11:2:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. As to this they say,--'Seeing that no offering-material is taken out "for the full moon," nor any offering-material "for the new moon," and seeing that he does not say, "Recite the invitatory formula for the full moon," nor "Recite the invitatory formula</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>for the new moon;" nor "Recite the offering-formula for the full moon," nor "Recite the offering-formula for the new moon," how, then, is offering made to this full and new moon?' Well, when he makes a libation of ghee to the Mind--the full moon being the Mind--he thereby makes offering to the full moon; and when he makes a libation of ghee to Speech--the new moon being Speech--he thereby makes offering to the new moon: and thus offering is made by him to the full and new moon.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:9">11:2:4:9</A></FONT></span>9. Now, some prepare two messes of rice, one for Sarasvat on the full moon, and one for Sarasvat&icirc; on the new moon, saying, 'We thus clearly make offering to the full and new moon.' But let him not do this; for Sarasvat is the Mind, and Sarasvat&icirc; is Speech; and thus, in making libations of ghee to these two, offering is made by him to the full and new moon: let him therefore not prepare these two messes of rice.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:4:10">11:2:4:10</A></FONT></span>10. As to this they say, 'Surely, he who performs the Full and New-moon offerings becomes a (mere) utterer of the &Acirc;gur&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; for, when he has performed</p>

</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the Full-moon offering, he knows that he will perform the New-moon offering; and when he has performed the New-moon offering, he knows that he will again perform the Full-moon offering; thus when he goes to the other world he goes thither as an utterer of the &Acirc;gur: how, then, does he become one who has not (merely) uttered the &Acirc;gur?' Well, when, on both occasions, he makes those two libations of ghee (to Mind and Speech), then his Full and New-moon offerings become complete; and he goes to the other world after his Full and New-moon offerings are completed, and thus becomes one who has not (merely) uttered the &Acirc;gur.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_146"></A><A HREF="sbe44014.htm#fr_146">32:1</A> Or, one who has only had the &Acirc;gur-formulas uttered for him (by the priests). &Acirc;gur is the technical term of two formulas, viz. of the formula '(Agnim) ya<I>g</I>a' (recite the offering-formula to Agni, or to whatever deity offering is made), by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite; and of the formula 'Ye ya<I>g</I>&acirc;mahe (Agnim),' by which the Hot<I>ri</I> introduces the y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc;, or offering-verse. At the Soma-sacrifice the former formula is modified to 'Hot&acirc; yakshat,' uttered by the Maitr&acirc;varu<I>n</I>a priest. See Haug, Transl. of Ait. Br., p. 133, note.--In comparing these &Acirc;gur-formulas with the performances of the Full and New-moon offerings, the author thus seems to imply that, just as the utterance of these formulas is merely the preliminary to the oblation itself, so each fortnightly <A NAME="page_33"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 33</FONT></A> performance is only the preliminary to the next performance; but that the Sacrificer never actually completes the sacrifice. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on the other hand, takes '&acirc;g&ucirc;rtin' to mean 'one who has formed a resolution (&acirc;g&ucirc;rta, &acirc;gura<I>n</I>am = sa<I>m</I>kalpa);' and native dictionaries, indeed, give '&acirc;gur' as a synonym of 'prati<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;' (promise, agreement; Zuruf, Zusage). But, even if this were the right meaning of the word, the general drift of the passage would remain the same, viz. that such a sacrificer would ultimately die as one who had merely promised or intended to offer sacrifice, without his having actually performed it, or brought it to a proper conclusion, and thus without reaping the ultimate benefit from it, viz. citizenship in the heavenly abodes.</P>
