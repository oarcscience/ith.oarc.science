That makes fifteen oblations:--for these fifteen oblations those fifteen kindling-verses (serve, as it were, as) invitatory formulas; and for these invitatory formulas these (serve as) offering-formulas--whatever formula (is used) there (at those oblations) and what Nigada (is used at the invocation of the I<I>d</I>&acirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_131"></A><A HREF="#fn_131"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>) that is of the form of offering-formulas. Thereby, then, those oblations of his come to be supplied with invitatory formulas through those kindling-verses; and through those oblations those invitatory formulas come to be supplied with both offering-formulas and oblations.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_124"></A><A HREF="sbe44011.htm#fr_124">24:2</A> According to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, this refers either to the formula by which the Adhvaryu calls on the Hot<I>ri</I> to recite the kindling-verses, and which, he says, consists of nine syllables (samidhyam&acirc;n&acirc;y&acirc;nubr&ucirc;hi); or to nine preliminary formulas (forming a nigada) pronounced by the Hot<I>ri</I> before the performance of the fore-offerings, see I, 5, 2, 1 seqq. These latter formulas are probably those intended by the author; the former formula being the less likely to be referred to, as, in its above form of nine syllables, it is indeed allowed to be used optionally by the &Acirc;pastambas&ucirc;tra, but not by the authorities of the white Ya<I>g</I>us, who use the formula '(Hotar) Agnaye samidhyam&acirc;n&acirc;y&acirc;nubr&ucirc;hi;' see <I>S</I>at.

<P><A NAME="fn_126"></A><A HREF="sbe44011.htm#fr_126">24:4</A> The word 's<I>ri</I>sh<I>t</I>i' usually means 'creation,' but in accordance with the primary meaning of the verb 's<I>ri</I><I>g</I>,' it apparently refers here (as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a seems to think) to the throwing of the anointed Prastara, as the representative of the Sacrificer, into the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire, thus insuring for the Sacrificer his despatch to, and renewed life in, the heavenly world. With reference to <A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A> this throwing of the grass-bunch into the fire (I, 8, 3, 11 seq.; 9, 2, 19) some of the S&ucirc;tras use, indeed, the verb 's<I>ri</I><I>g</I>,' cf.
