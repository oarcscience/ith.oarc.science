### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### EXPIATORY CEREMONIES.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:1">14:3:2:1</span></span>1. Now
this--to wit, the sacrifice--is the self of all beings, and of all gods:
after its successful consummation the Sacrificer prospers in offspring
(or, people) and cattle; but he whose Gharma (pot) is shattered is
deprived of his offspring and cattle. In that case there is an
expiation.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:2">14:3:2:2</span></span>2. He
offers an oblation of a full (spoon of ghee); for the full means
everything: with everything he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful
in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:3">14:3:2:3</span></span>3. \[He
offers, with Vâ*g*. S. XXXIX, 1,\] 'Hail to the vital airs with their
over-lord!'--the over-lord of the vital airs, doubtless, is the mind
(soul), for in the mind all the vital airs are established: it is thus
by means of the mind that he thereby heals whatever has been
unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span id="page_505">p. 505</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:4">14:3:2:4</span></span>4. 'To
the Earth hail!'--the earth, doubtless, is a place of abode for all the
gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has
been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:5">14:3:2:5</span></span>5. 'To
Agni hail!'--Agni, doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it is thus by
means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in
the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:6">14:3:2:6</span></span>6. 'To
the Air hail!'--the air, doubtless, is a place of abode for all the
gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has
been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:7">14:3:2:7</span></span>7. 'To
Vâyu hail!'--Vâyu (the wind), doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it
is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been
unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:8">14:3:2:8</span></span>8. 'To
the Sky hail!'--the sky, doubtless, is a place of abode for all the
gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has
been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:9">14:3:2:9</span></span>9. 'To
Sûrya hail!'--Sûrya (the sun), doubtless, is the self of all the gods:
it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been
unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:10">14:3:2:10</span></span>10.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXIX, 2,\] 'To the Regions hail!'--the regions, doubtless,
are a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of all the
deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:11">14:3:2:11</span></span>11.
'To *K*andra hail!'--*K*andra (the moon), doubtless, is the self of all
the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever
has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:12">14:3:2:12</span></span>12.
'To the Nakshatras hail!'--the Nakshatras

<span id="page_506">p. 506</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (lunar asterisms),
doubtless, are a place of abode for all the gods: it is thus by means of
all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the
sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:13">14:3:2:13</span></span>13.
'To the Waters hail!'--the waters, doubtless, are a place of abode for
all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals
whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:14">14:3:2:14</span></span>14.
'To Varu*n*a hail!'--Varu*n*a, doubtless, is the self of all the gods:
it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been
unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:15">14:3:2:15</span></span>15.
'To the Navel hail! To the Purified one <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[1](#fn_1315) hail!'--This is undefined, for
undefined is Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: it is thus
Pra*g*âpati, the sacrifice, he thereby heals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:16">14:3:2:16</span></span>16.
These are thirteen oblations,--for there are thirteen months in the
year, and the year is Pra*g*âpati, and Pra*g*âpati is the sacrifice: it
is thus Pra*g*âpati, the sacrifice, he thereby heals.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:17">14:3:2:17</span></span>17.
\[Vâ*g*. S. XXXIX, 3,\] 'To the Voice hail!'--a mouth he thereby gives
to it;--'to the Breath hail! to the Breath hail!'--two nostrils (a nose)
he thereby gives to it;--'to the Eye hail! to the Eye hail!'--two eyes
he thereby gives to it;--'to the Ear hail! to the Ear hail!'--two ears
he thereby gives to it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:18">14:3:2:18</span></span>18.
These are seven oblations,--now seven in number are these vital airs in
the head: it is them he thereby gives to it. He offers a last oblation
of a full (spoon),--the full means everything:

<span id="page_507">p. 507</span>

with everything he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the
sacrifice,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:19">14:3:2:19</span></span>19.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XXXIX, 4), 'The mind's purpose,'--by the mind, indeed,
everything is gained here: by the mind he thus heals whatever has been
unsuccessful in the sacrifice;--

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:20">14:3:2:20</span></span>20.
'The truth of speech may I freely obtain,'--by speech everything is
gained here: by speech he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in
the sacrifice;--'may the form of cattle, the essence of food, fame, and
prosperity accrue unto me, hail!'--a blessing he thereby invokes.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:21">14:3:2:21</span></span>21.
Thereupon, having pounded that spare (clay), and mixed it with powdered
clay, he makes (a pot) in proper form, and bakes it in proper form for
the purpose of the 'setting out'; and let him perform (the sacrifice)
with whichever of the two reserve (pots) may be firm.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:22">14:3:2:22</span></span>22.
The Pravargya, indeed, is the year; for the year is everything, and the
Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire then it is
spring; when it is burning-hot then it is summer; when it is flowing
over then it is the rainy season;--but, indeed, when the rains overflow,
all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the rains
overflow for him who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:23">14:3:2:23</span></span>23.
The Pravargya, indeed, is these worlds, for these worlds are everything,
and the Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire then it
is this (terrestrial) world; when it is burning-hot then it is the
air-world; and when it flows over then it is yonder (heavenly)
world;--but,

<span id="page_508">p. 508</span>

indeed; when yonder world overflows, all the gods and all beings subsist
thereon; and, verily, yonder world overflows for him who thus knows
this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:24">14:3:2:24</span></span>24.
The Pravargya, indeed, is those deities--Agni, Vâyu, and Âditya; for
those deities are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it
is placed on the fire then it is Agni; when it is burning-hot then it is
Vâyu (the wind); and when it flows over then it is Âditya (the
sun);--but, indeed, when yonder sun overflows, all the gods and all
beings subsist upon him; and, verily, yonder sun overflows for him who
thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:25">14:3:2:25</span></span>25.
The Pravargya, indeed, is the Sacrificer, his own self, his offspring
(or people) and cattle; for the Sacrificer is everything, and the
Pravargya is everything when it is placed on the fire then it is his own
self; when it is burning-hot then it is his offspring; and when it flows
over then it is his cattle;--but, indeed, when the cattle overflow (with
milk) all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the
cattle overflow for him who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:26">14:3:2:26</span></span>26.
The Pravargya, indeed, is the Agnihotra, for the Agnihotra is
everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the Agnihotra
milk) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it
is ladled out then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is
offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the
Agnihotra overflows all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and,
verily, the Agnihotra overflows for him who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:27">14:3:2:27</span></span>27.
The Pravargya, indeed, is the New and Full-moon sacrifices; for the New
and Full-moon sacrifices

<span id="page_509">p. 509</span>

are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the havis) is
put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is
standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is
offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma); but, indeed, when the New
and Full-moon sacrifices overflow all the gods and all beings subsist
thereon; and, verily, the New and Full-moon sacrifices overflow for him
who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:28">14:3:2:28</span></span>28.
The Pravargya, indeed, is the Seasonal sacrifices, for the Seasonal
sacrifices are everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the
havis) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when
it is standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is
offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the
Seasonal sacrifices overflow then all the gods and all beings subsist
thereon; and, verily, the Seasonal sacrifices overflow for him who thus
knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:29">14:3:2:29</span></span>29.
The Pravargya, indeed, is the Animal sacrifice, for the Animal sacrifice
is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the meat) is
put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; and when it is
standing ready then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is
offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the
animal offering overflows all the gods and all beings subsist thereon;
and, verily, the animal offering overflows for him who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:30">14:3:2:30</span></span>30.
The Pravargya, indeed, is Soma, for Soma is everything, and the
Pravargya is everything: when it is poured out then it is the (Gharma)
placed on the fire; when it is drawn (into the

<span id="page_510">p. 510</span>

cups) then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then
it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when Soma overflows all
the gods and all beings avail themselves thereof; and, verily, Soma
overflows for him who thus knows this; and, verily, no sacrifice
whatever is offered without the Pravargya for him who thus knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="14:3:2:31">14:3:2:31</span></span>31.
And, verily, whosoever either teaches, or partakes of, this (Pravargya)
enters that life, and that light: the observance of the rule thereof is
the same as at the creation <span id="fr_1326"></span>[1](#fn_1316).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[506:1](sbe44124.htm#fr_1325) Mahîdhara takes
'pûta' in the sense of 'the purifier (*s*odhaka)' and apparently the
name of a god (as he does also the Navel (nâbhyai devatâyai)).
