### EIGHTH ADHYÂYA. FIRST BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:1:1">11:8:1:1</span></span>1.
Verily, even as this cart-wheel, or a potter's wheel, would creak <span
id="fr_390"></span>[1](#fn_390) if not steadied, so, indeed, were these
worlds unfirm and unsteadied.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:1:2">11:8:1:2</span></span>2.
Pra*g*âpati then bethought him, 'How may these worlds become firm and
steadied?' By means of the mountains and rivers he stablished this
(earth), by means of the birds and sun-motes <span
id="fr_391"></span>[2](#fn_391) the air, and by means of the clouds and
stars the sky.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:8:1:3">11:8:1:3</span></span>3. He
then exclaimed, 'Wealth!'--now, wealth <span
id="fr_392"></span>[3](#fn_392) (mahas) means cattle, whence they
(cattle) thrive (mahîyante <span id="fr_393"></span>[4](#fn_393))
exceedingly in the homestead of one who possesses many of them; and this
(Sacrificer), indeed, possesses many of them, and in his homestead they
do thrive exceedingly. Wherefore, if people were either to forcibly
drive him from his home, or to bid him go forth, let him, after
performing the Agni-hotra, approach (the fires) saying, 'Wealth'; and he
becomes firmly established by offspring and cattle, and is not deprived
of his home.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_390"></span>[126:1](sbe44041.htm#fr_390) Sâya*n*a
apparently takes 'krand' in the sense of 'to shake, or wabble,'--'even
as a cart-wheel or some other wheel, not standing on the ground for want
of the wooden rest (âlambana-kâsh*th*a,? axle-pin) or some other thing,
would wabble (hvalet).' What Sâya*n*a means to say, probably, is that
the verb used by the author expresses the effect of the action intended.

<span id="fn_391"></span>[126:2](sbe44041.htm#fr_391) Or, sun-beams
(ra*s*mi), as Sâya*n*a takes 'marî*k*i'; cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 9,
note.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[126:3](sbe44041.htm#fr_392) Or, joy;--cp. II,
3, 4, 25, which would seem to be the passage referred to in the present
paragraph.

<span id="fn_393"></span>[126:4](sbe44041.htm#fr_393) Or, perhaps, 'they
enjoy themselves, gambol,' as the St. Petersb. Dict. takes it.
Differently, again, Sâya*n*a,--yata ebhi*h* pa*s*ubhir mahîyate (he
thrives?), ata ete maha*h*.
