<P><A NAME="fn_771"></A><A HREF="sbe44085.htm#fr_775">304:2</A> Pavam&acirc;na is the name of the pressed Soma while it is 'clarifying.' Hence the first stotra of each of the three Savanas of a Soma-day--chanted after the pressing of the Soma and the drawing of the principal cups--is called Pavam&acirc;na-stotra. Whether by the term 'Pavam&acirc;na' here the clarifying Soma is alluded to, as well as the stotra--which alone the commentator takes it to mean, and to which the second mention certainly refers--must remain <A NAME="page_305"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 305</FONT></A> doubtful. The commentator, it would seem, accounts for this identification of the Pavam&acirc;na-stotra with heaven by the fact that the second day of the A<I>s</I>vamedha is an ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a day (see <a href="sbe44096.htm#13:3:3:3">XIII, 3, 3, 3</A>; T&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>ya-Br. XXI, 4, 1), i.e. one on which all the stotras are performed in the twenty-one-versed hymn-form; and that the Sun is commonly called 'ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>a,' the twenty-first, or twenty-one-fold. The particular chant intended is that of the morning pressing, viz. the Bahishpavam&acirc;na, or outside-Pavam&acirc;na-stotra, so-called because at the ordinary one-day's Soma-sacrifice, it is chanted outside the Sadas. But, on the other hand, in the case of Ah&icirc;na-sacrifices, or those lasting from two to twelve days, that stotra is chanted outside only on the first day, whilst on the others it is done inside the Sadas. An exception is, however, made in the case of the A<I>s</I>vamedha, which requires the morning Pavam&acirc;na, on all three days, to be performed in its usual place on the north-eastern part of Vedi, south of the <I>K</I>&acirc;tv&acirc;la.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_772"></A><A HREF="sbe44085.htm#fr_776">305:1</A> For the noiseless way of sliding or creeping from the Sadas, and returning thither, and approaching the different Dhish<I>n</I>yas, or fire-hearths, see part ii, p. 299, note 2. As has already been stated, it is only after the chanting of the Bahishpavam&acirc;na that the victims are driven up to the offering place.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_773"></A><A HREF="sbe44085.htm#fr_777">305:2</A> It is from this, the principal part of the S&acirc;man, or chanted verse (cf. part ii, p. 310, note), that the Udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I> takes his name; this particular function of his being, on the present occasion, supposed to he performed by the whinnying of the horse. After this they make the horse step on the chanting-ground, apparently either as a visible recognition of the part it has been made to play, or because the horse thereby is made to go to heaven with which the Bahishpavam&acirc;na was identified.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_774"></A><A HREF="sbe44085.htm#fr_778">306:1</A> On the mystic significance of this ejaculation (here compared with the neighing of the horse) in the sacrifice, and especially in the S&acirc;man, see I, 4, 1, 1 seqq.; II, 2, 4, 12.</P>
