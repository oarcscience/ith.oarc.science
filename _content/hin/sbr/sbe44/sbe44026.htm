<P><A NAME="fn_250"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_250">74:2</A> The Vai<I>s</I>vadeva, or first of the four seasonal sacrifices, requires the following oblations:--1. a cake on eight potsherds to Agni; 2. a pap to Soma; 3. a cake on twelve or eight potsherds to <A NAME="page_75"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 75</FONT></A> Savit<I>ri</I>; 4. a pap to Sarasvat&icirc;; 5. a pap to P&ucirc;shan--these first five oblations recur at all seasonal offerings;--6. a cake on seven potsherds to the Maruts; 7. a dish of clotted curds to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>; 8. a cake on one potsherd to Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_251"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_251">75:1</A> It would rather seem that what is intended here by 'sa<I>m</I>dhi' is not the joints themselves, but the limbs (in the anatomical sense) between the articulations. Similarly in 'trishandhi' in <a href="sbe44026.htm#11:5:2:7">parag. 7</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_252"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_252">75:2</A> That is to say, it is a low-voiced offering, the two formulas, with the exception of the final Om and Vausha<I>t</I>, being pronounced in a low voice. All cakes on one potsherd are (except those to Varu<I>n</I>a) of this description; K&acirc;ty. <I>S</I>r. IV, 5, 3; &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. II, 15, 5; cf. <I>S</I>at. Br. II, 4, 3, 8.</P>

Then follows the Great Oblation consisting of 6-10, the five common oblations; 11. a cake on twelve potsherds to Indra and Agni; 12. a pap to Mahendra; and 13. a cake on one potsherd to Vi<I>s</I>vakarman.

<P><A NAME="fn_257"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_257">76:3</A> This offering of a cake to Aditi, mentioned in K&acirc;ty. Sr. V, 7, 2, is not referred to in the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a's account of the S&acirc;kamedh&acirc;<I>h</I>, see II, 5, 3, 20.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_258"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_258">77:1</A> The Sun&acirc;s&icirc;r&icirc;ya, or last Seasonal offering, consists of--1-5. the common oblations; 6. the <I>S</I>un&acirc;s&icirc;r&icirc;ya cake on twelve potsherds; 7. a milk oblation to V&acirc;yu; 8. a cake on one potsherd to S&ucirc;rya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_259"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_259">77:2</A> The Seasonal offerings are performed so as to leave an interval of four months between them; the fourth falling exactly a year after the first; hence the whole performance consists, as it were, of three periods of four months each, with two joints between them;--corresponding to the formation of the arms and legs.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_260"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_260">77:3</A> Of the five oblations common to the four sacrifices, one--viz. the cake to Savit<I>ri</I>--is a low-voiced offering (K&acirc;ty. Sr. IV, 5, 5; &Acirc;<I>s</I>v. <I>S</I>r. II, 15, 7), as are also the one-kap&acirc;la cakes of which there is one in each sacrifice. According to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a the first and last Seasonal sacrifices have only these two Up&acirc;m<I>s</I>uy&acirc;<I>g</I>as, whilst the second and third have each one additional low-voiced oblation, but he does not specify them. This is, however, a mistake, as K&acirc;ty&acirc;yana, <I>S</I>r. IV, 5, 6. 7, states distinctly, that the two additional low-voiced oblations are the Vai<I>s</I>vadev&icirc; payasy&acirc; in the first, and the oblation to V&acirc;yu in the last, <I>K</I>&acirc;turm&acirc;sya.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_261"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_261">78:1</A> According to S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a this refers to the first and last Seasonal sacrifices, inasmuch as there is no uttaravedi required for these, and hence only the simple leading forward of the fire to the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya hearth; whilst the commentary on Katy. V, 4, 6, on the contrary, refers it just to the other two, because a double leading forth takes place there.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_262"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_262">78:2</A> Or, as S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a takes it, man walks on two feet.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_263"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_263">78:3</A> The <I>K</I>atush<I>t</I>oma, properly speaking, is the technical term for such an arrangement of the Stotras of a Soma-sacrifice by which they are chanted on stomas, or hymn-forms, increasing successively by four verses. Two such arrangements (of four and six different stomas respectively) are mentioned, one for an Agnish<I>t</I>oma sacrifice, and the other for a Sho<I>d</I>a<I>s</I>in. See note on <a href="sbe44094.htm#13:3:1:4">XIII, 3, 1, 4</A>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_264"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_264">78:4</A> These 362 B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc; verses (of 36 syllables each) would amount to 13,032 syllables; and, verses of the four metres referred to amounting together to 148 syllables, this amount is contained in the former 88 times, leaving only eight over; so slight a discrepancy being considered of no account in such calculations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_265"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_265">78:5</A> That is, a year of 360 days; and if, as is done by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a (in <A NAME="page_79"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 79</FONT></A> accordance with the calculations in Book X), the year is identified with the fire-altar, a mah&acirc;vedi containing 360 Ya<I>g</I>ushmat&icirc; bricks.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_266"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_266">79:1</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a reminds us that the Mah&acirc;vrata-s&acirc;man consists of five parts in five different stomas (Triv<I>ri</I>t, &amp;c., see part iv, p. 282, note 4), the verses of which, added up (9, 15, 17, 25, 21), make 87, which amount is apparently, in a rough way, to be taken as identical with that of 88 obtained in note <A HREF="#fn_264">4</A> of last page.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_267"></A><A HREF="sbe44026.htm#fr_267">79:2</A> Viz. inasmuch as the total amount of B<I>ri</I>hat&icirc;s (362) exceeds by two the number of days in the year.</P>
