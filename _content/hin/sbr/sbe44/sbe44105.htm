When the year has expired&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_967"></A><A HREF="#fn_962"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, the D&icirc;ksh&acirc; (initiation) takes place. After the slaughtering of the victim sacred to Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_968"></A><A HREF="#fn_963"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, the (ish<I>t</I>i) offerings&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_969"></A><A HREF="#fn_964"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> come to an end. Some, however, say, &#8216;Let him offer (them) on the fires of his Purohita (court-chaplain). But why should one who is initiated make offering? There are twelve D&icirc;ksh&acirc; (days), twelve Upasad (days) and three Suty&acirc;s (Soma-days), that amounts to the thrice-ninefold (stoma); but the thrice-ninefold, indeed, is a thunderbolt, and the horse is the nobility (kshatra), and the R&acirc;<I>g</I>anya is the nobility; and political power (kshatra) is won by the thunderbolt: thus he wins&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_970"></A><A HREF="#fn_965"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> political power by means of the thunderbolt.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:4:5">13:4:4:5</A></FONT></span>5. There are twenty-one sacrificial stakes, all of them twenty-one cubits long. The central one&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_973"></A><A HREF="#fn_968"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> is of ra<I>g</I><I>g</I>ud&acirc;la&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_974"></A><A HREF="#fn_969"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> wood; on both sides thereof stand two&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_975"></A><A HREF="#fn_970"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> p&icirc;tud&acirc;ru (deodar) ones, six of bilva wood (Aegle Marmelos)--three on this side, and three on that,--six of khadira (Acacia Catechu) wood--three on this side, and three on that,--six of pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a (Butea frondosa) wood--three on this side, and three on that.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:4:6">13:4:4:6</A></FONT></span>6. Then as to why these stakes are suchlike. When Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati's vital airs had gone out of him, his body began to swell; and what phlegm there was in it that flowed together and burst forth from inside through the nose, and it became this tree, the ra<I>g</I><I>g</I>ud&acirc;la, whence it is viscid, for it originated from phlegm: with that form (quality) he thus endows it (the stake). And as to why it is the (stake) standing by the fire, it is because that one is the centre of the stakes, and that nose is the centre of the (channels of the) vital airs: he thus puts it in its own place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:4:7">13:4:4:7</A></FONT></span>7. And what watery (liquid) fire, and what fragrance there was, that flowed together and</p>

<p>burst forth from the eye, and became that tree, the p&icirc;tud&acirc;ru; whence that (wood) is sweet-smelling, since it originated from fragrance, and whence it is inflammable, since it originated from fire: with that quality he thus endows it. And because these two (p&icirc;tud&acirc;ru stakes) are on the two sides of the central one, therefore these two eyes are on the two sides of the nose: he thus puts those two in their own place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:4:8">13:4:4:8</A></FONT></span>8. And what 'kunt&acirc;pa&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_976"></A><A HREF="#fn_971"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>,' what marrow there was, that flowed together, and burst forth from the ear, and became that tree, the bilva; whence all the fruit of that (tree) is eatable&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_977"></A><A HREF="#fn_972"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> inside, and whence it (the tree, or wood) is yellowish, for marrow is yellowish: with that quality he thus endows it. The two (sets of) p&icirc;tud&acirc;ru (stakes) stand inside, and the bilva ones outside, for the eyes are inside, and the ears outside: he thus puts them in their own place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:4:9">13:4:4:9</A></FONT></span>9.

From his flesh the pal&acirc;<I>s</I>a was produced, whence that (tree) has much juice, and (that) red juice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_979"></A><A HREF="sbe44106.htm#fn_974"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, for red, as it were, is flesh: with that quality he thus endows it.

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="13:4:4:11">13:4:4:11</A></FONT></span>11.

Having thus completely restored this Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, the sacrifice, he therein seizes twenty-one Agn&icirc;shom&icirc;ya victims: for these there is one and the same performance, and this is the performance of the day before (the first Suty&acirc;).</p>

The building of the altar, generally occupying the space of a year, is apparently compressed on this occasion within the time of the D&icirc;ksh&acirc; and Upasads.</P>

Whilst there the offering of a he-goat to Agni and Soma took place on the Upavasatha, or day before the Suty&acirc; or Soma-day, on the present occasion these preliminary animal sacrifices would also seem to be performed on each day from the completion of the D&icirc;ksh&acirc; up to the Upavasatha day inclusive (? i.e. on the Upasad days, cf. K&acirc;ty. <I>S</I>r. XX. 3, 9; 4, 21). Moreover, though technically called Agn&icirc;shom&icirc;ya, the sacrifice--on the Upavasatha day, at all events (<a href="sbe44105.htm#13:4:4:11">XIII, 4, 4, 11</A>)--is not one of a single he-goat sacred to Agni and Soma, but a set of eleven victims distributed over the central eleven stakes (of which twenty-one are required on the Soma-days) in the manner explained in III, 9, 1, 1 seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_967"></A><A HREF="sbe44105.htm#fr_972">372:2</A> That is, at the end of each of the three Soma-sacrifices, see part ii, p. 454. The Udavas&acirc;n&icirc;y&acirc; (completing offering) takes place before the carrying round of the sacred water (ib. p. 389 seqq.). According to K&acirc;ty. XX, 3, 10-11, however, this singing of the Sacrificer's praises along with those of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati is to take place not only at the juncture specified in the text, but also at the beginning of the animal sacrifice of the Soma-days, that is, as would seem, prior to the slaying of the victims, at the morning pressing. The wording of our text seems hardly to admit of this interpretation.</P>

The flowers are stated to be greenish white, and 'the wood light-coloured, mottled with darker wavy lines and small light-coloured dots.'</P>
