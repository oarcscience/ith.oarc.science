<p>intelligence gives rise to four duties attaching to the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a--Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>ical descent, a befitting deportment, fame, and the perfecting of the people; and the people that are being perfected guard the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a by four duties--by (showing him) respect, and liberality, (and by granting him) security against oppression, and security against capital punishment.</p>

And, truly, whatever may be the toils here between heaven and earth, the study (of the scriptures) is their last stage, their goal (limit) for him who, knowing this, studies his lesson: therefore one's (daily) lesson should be studied.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_324"></A><A HREF="sbe44031.htm#fr_324">99:6</A> S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a seems to take 'ek&acirc;r&acirc;mat&acirc;' in the sense of 'remaining always the same,'--eka eva sann &acirc; samant&acirc;d bhavat&icirc;ty ek&acirc;r&acirc;mas tasya bh&acirc;va<I>h</I>.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_326"></A><A HREF="sbe44031.htm#fr_326">100:1</A> The study of the Veda being 'the sacrifice of the Brahman,' the reading of a portion is, as it were, a special rite, or form of offering, belonging to that sacrifice. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a, on the other hand, takes it to mean that the student performs, as it were, the particular rite, or offering, to which the portion he reads may refer. It may, indeed, be implied, though it certainly is not expressed in the text.</P>

II, 3, 6, 8, the same commentator explains it as a verse (<I>ri</I>g-vi<I>s</I>esha) conveying some precept of conduct (&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ra<I>s</I>iksh&acirc;r&ucirc;pa), such as 'brahma<I>k</I>&acirc;ryasy&acirc;po<I>s</I>&acirc;na<I>m</I> karma kuru, div&acirc; m&acirc; sv&acirc;ps&icirc;<I>h</I>,' &amp;c.

The student, as the sacrificer, has accordingly, during the sacrifice (that is, during the period of his study of the Vedas, or for life), as it were, to limit his daily food to the drinking of the Vrata-milk, which rule he obeys symbolically by reciting such a verse or formula.</P>
