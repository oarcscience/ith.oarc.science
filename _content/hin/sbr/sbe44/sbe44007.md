### FIFTH BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:1">11:1:5:1</span></span>1. He
observes the fast thinking, 'To-day is the day of new moon <span
id="fr_96"></span>[4](#fn_96);' and then that (moon) is seen in

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

the west. But, indeed, he (the moon) is that heavenly dog: he watches
the Sacrificer's cattle (to seize them), and that would not be good for
cattle if amends were not made to them <span
id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97); and through fear of that 'down-coming
moon <span id="fr_98"></span>[2](#fn_98),' as they think him to be,--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:2">11:1:5:2</span></span>2. They
steal away into the shade. And therefore, indeed, people call that
burning pain '*s*valu*k*ita' (dog's clutch);--and therefore they also
call that one--

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:3">11:1:5:3</span></span>3. 'The
hare in the moon <span id="fr_99"></span>[3](#fn_99).' Soma, the food of
the gods, indeed, is the moon: at full moon they press him; and in the
subsequent half of the month he enters the waters and plants; and, the
cattle feeding on the water and the plants, he then during that night
(of new moon) collects him from the cattle.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:4">11:1:5:4</span></span>4. He
keeps the fast thinking, 'To-day is the day of new moon;' and then that
(moon) is seen in the west, and the Sacrificer departs from the path of
sacrifice. As to this they say, 'What should one do when he has departed
from the path of the sacrifice? Should he sacrifice, or should he not
sacrifice?' He should certainly sacrifice, for there is no other way out
of it: day after day that (moon) rises larger. Having performed offering
after the manner of the New-moon sacrifice, he takes out material for an
additional offering either on the same, or on the following day.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:5">11:1:5:5</span></span>5.
There are three chief oblations for this (offering),--(he prepares) a
cake on eight potsherds for

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Agni Pathik*ri*t
(the path-maker), one on eleven potsherds for Indra V*ri*trahan (the
slayer of V*ri*tra), and a cake on twelve potsherds for Agni
Vai*s*vânara.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:6">11:1:5:6</span></span>6. Now
as to why he prepares (an oblation) for Agni Pathik*ri*t,--it is that
Agni, being the maker of the path, leads the Sacrificer (back) to the
path of sacrifice, from which he now departs.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:7">11:1:5:7</span></span>7. And
as to why to Indra V*ri*trahan,--V*ri*tra is sin: with the help of
Indra, the slayer of V*ri*tra, he thus slays sin, V*ri*tra, which ever
keeps him from well-being, from virtue, and from the good work: this is
why he (offers) to Indra V*ri*trahan.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:8">11:1:5:8</span></span>8. And
as to why he prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Agni
Vai*s*vânara,--when Indra had slain V*ri*tra, he burnt him completely by
means of Agni Vai*s*vânara, and thereby burnt all his (V*ri*tra's) sin;
and in like manner does that (Sacrificer) now, after slaying sin,
V*ri*tra, with the help of Indra V*ri*trahan, burn him, and all that sin
of his, by means of Agni Vai*s*vânara; and, verily, not the slightest
sin remains in him who, knowing this, performs this offering.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:9">11:1:5:9</span></span>9. For
this (offering) there are seventeen kindling-verses. He offers to the
deities in a low voice, and makes any (verses) he pleases his invitatory
and offering-formulas. In like manner (those of) the two butter-portions
and the two formulas of the Svish*t*ak*ri*t.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:10">11:1:5:10</span></span>10. A
bow with three arrows he gives as dakshi*n*â; for with the bow a dog is
driven away: he thus drives away that (dog, the moon) when he gives a
bow with three arrows as dakshi*n*â.

<span class="margnote"><span id="11:1:5:11">11:1:5:11</span></span>11. A
staff he gives as dakshi*n*â; for with a staff

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

a dog is driven away: he thus drives away that (dog) when he gives a
staff as dakshi*n*â. This, indeed, is the prescribed dakshi*n*â; but he
may give anything else besides, of such other (objects meet for)
dakshi*n*âs as may be at his disposal. This, doubtless, is an offering
relating to cattle: he may perform it even though (the moon) was not
seen (at his New-moon sacrifice).
