### SECOND BRÂHMA*N*A.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:1">12:8:2:1</span></span>1.
Pra*g*âpati created the (Soma-)sacrifice. He took it and performed it.
When he had performed it, he felt like one emptied out. He saw this
sacrificial performance, the Sautrâma*n*î, and performed it, and then he
was again replenished; and, indeed, he who performs the Soma-sacrifice
is, as it were, emptied out, for his wealth, his prosperity is, as it
were, taken from him.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:2">12:8:2:2</span></span>2.
Having performed a Soma-sacrifice one ought to perform the Sautrâma*n*î:
as a cow that has been milked would replenish again, even so, indeed,
does he replenish himself,--he replenishes himself by offspring and
cattle; and, verily, he who, knowing this, performs the Sautrâma*n*î, or
he who (even) knows this, establishes himself in this world, and wins
the heavenly world.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:3">12:8:2:3</span></span>3. As
to this Suplan Sâr*ñg*aya asked Pratîdar*s*a Aibhâvata <span
id="fr_611"></span>[2](#fn_609), 'Seeing that neither does one

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

become initiated, nor are Soma-shoots <span
id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_610) thrown down (to be pressed), how then
does the Sautrâma*n*î become a Soma-sacrifice?'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:4">12:8:2:4</span></span>4. He
replied, 'The observance of the fast, assuredly, is the head of the
sacrifice, and the initiation its body. And the truth, doubtless, is of
the form of the fast-observance, and faith of that of the initiation.
And mind is of the form of the Sacrificer, and speech of that of the
sacrifice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:5">12:8:2:5</span></span>5.
Thus, when he enters upon the fast-observance, he thereby restores the
head to the body of the sacrifice, and he puts truth into faith, and the
Sacrificer into the sacrifice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:6">12:8:2:6</span></span>6.
Therefore at this sacrifice (the Sautrâma*n*î) the fast-observance <span
id="fr_613"></span>[2](#fn_611) is the initiation. Now, the
fast-observance is a male, and the initiation a female; and the truth is
a male, and faith a female; and the mind is a male, and speech a female;
and the Sacrificer is the male to his wife, whence wherever there is a
husband there is a wife: and at the very outset of the sacrifice he thus
sets up couples with a view to production.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:7">12:8:2:7</span></span>7.
'And, indeed, those (materials) are the Soma-shoots at this sacrifice,'
they say, 'to wit, the malted rice, the malted barley, and the fried
rice.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:8">12:8:2:8</span></span>8. The
malted rice <span id="fr_614"></span>[3](#fn_612), indeed, is of the
form of the

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

morning-pressing, for the morning-pressing is this (terrestrial) world,
and the latter relates to the A*s*vins, and Â*s*vina milk he pours (into
the Surâ-liquor) the first night: he thus provides him (the
Sacrificer <span id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_613)) with the
morning-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own
form <span id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_614).

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:9">12:8:2:9</span></span>9. And
the malted barley is of the form of the midday-pressing, for the
midday-pressing is the air, and the latter relates to Sarasvatî <span
id="fr_617"></span>[3](#fn_615), and the Sârasvata milk he pours (into
the Surâ) the second night: he thus provides him with the
midday-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its own
form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:10">12:8:2:10</span></span>10.
And the fried rice is of the form of the evening-pressing, for the
evening-pressing is the sky, and the latter relates to Indra, and Aindra
milk he pours (into the Surâ) the third night: he thus provides him with
the evening-pressing--with its own world, with its own deity, with its
own form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:11">12:8:2:11</span></span>11.
The milk of one (cow) he pours (into the Surâ) the first night, the milk
of two the second

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

night, and the milk of three the third night: he thus provides him with
the pressings, in accordance with their forms, and in accordance with
their deities.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:12">12:8:2:12</span></span>12.
With (Vâ*g*. S. XIX, 2), 'Hereof pour ye to the juice,' he pours in (the
milk) for the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing;--'(to) the
Soma who is the supreme offering,'--for this, to wit, Soma, is indeed
the supreme offering (-material): he thus makes it <span
id="fr_618"></span>[1](#fn_616) to be the supreme offering;--'the manly
one who hath rushed into the waters,' for both with water and between it
is he (Soma) indeed pressed out;--'I have pressed out Soma by stones,'
for by means of stones Soma is indeed pressed out: it is thus by means
of stones he presses it out for the sake of (conformity with) the
Soma-pressing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:13">12:8:2:13</span></span>13.
As to this they say, ‘That Sautrâma*n*î, surely, is of the form of both
effused (extracted) and infused <span id="fr_619"></span>[2](#fn_617)
(Soma);--to wit, that essence of both water and plants, the milk, is of
the form of the effused (Soma); and that essence of food, the liquor, is
of the form of infused (Soma): by both (kinds of) pressings he thus
expresses it, by both pressings he secures it.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:14">12:8:2:14</span></span>14.
As to this they say, 'Seeing that the Soma-juice is pressed out by
stones, how as to the Sautrâma*n*î?' Let him reply, 'By the
directions <span id="fr_620"></span>[3](#fn_618) and the

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Âprî-verses;' for
the directions (praisha) are in the B*ri*hatî (metre), and the
pressing-stones are of bârhata nature: by means of stones the Soma-juice
is indeed pressed out, and by means of stones he now presses it out for
the sake of (conformity with) the Soma-pressing.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:15">12:8:2:15</span></span>15.
All (the praishas) contain (the word) 'payas' (milk), for in the form of
milk Soma is (here) pressed <span id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_619); they
all contain (the word) 'Soma,' for the sake of (conformity with) the
Soma-pressing; they all contain (the word) 'parisrut' (spirituous
liquor), for in the form of spirituous liquor Soma is (here) pressed;
they all contain (the word) 'gh*ri*ta' (ghee), for this--to wit,
ghee--doubtless is manifestly a form of the sacrifice: he thus makes it
to be manifestly a form of the sacrifice; they all contain (the word)
'madhu' (honey), for this--to wit, honey--is manifestly a form of Soma:
he thus makes it to be manifestly a form of Soma.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:16">12:8:2:16</span></span>16.
They all refer to the A*s*vins <span id="fr_622"></span>[2](#fn_620),
for the sake of healing-power <span id="fr_623"></span>[3](#fn_621);
they all refer to Sarasvatî, for the obtainment of food; they all refer
to Indra, for the obtainment of energy, or vital power.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:17">12:8:2:17</span></span>17.
And, again, as to why they all refer to the A*s*vins, all of them to
Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra,--these, indeed, were the deities
who first

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

prepared this sacrifice (the Sautrâma*n*î); with the help of these
deities he thus prepares it; and, besides, he also provides these
deities with a share.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:18">12:8:2:18</span></span>18.
The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous <span
id="fr_624"></span>[1](#fn_622), and relate to the same deities,--for
the sake of continuity and uninterruptedness of the race (offspring).
All of them relate to the A*s*vins, all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of
them to Indra: the significance of this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:19">12:8:2:19</span></span>19.
The Âprî-formulas <span id="fr_625"></span>[2](#fn_623) are anush*t*ubh
verses; for the Anush*t*ubh is speech, and with speech Soma is pressed:
he thus presses it with speech, for the sake of (conformity with) the
Soma-sacrifice. All of them relate to the A*s*vins, all of them to
Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of this is the
same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:20">12:8:2:20</span></span>20.
The anupraishas <span id="fr_626"></span>[3](#fn_624) (after-directions)
are in the

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

*g*âgata metre; for the *G*agatî is this (earth), and by means of her
Soma is pressed: by means of her he thus presses it for the sake of
(conformity with) the Soma-pressing. All of them relate to the A*s*vins,
all of them to Sarasvatî, and all of them to Indra: the significance of
this is the same as before.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:21">12:8:2:21</span></span>21.
This Sautrâma*n*î, then, is manifestly a Soma-sacrifice; and were the
Sacrificer alone to drink (the liquor), it would be either an
ish*t*i-offering, or an animal sacrifice; but, for the sake of
conformity of the liquor) to the Soma, all the priests drink thereof,
for all the priests drink of the Soma-juice.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:22">12:8:2:22</span></span>22.
The Adhvaryus <span id="fr_627"></span>[1](#fn_625) drink (the contents
of) the Â*s*vina (cup), for the A*s*vins are the Adhvaryus of the gods:
they thus consume each his own share in his own abode.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:23">12:8:2:23</span></span>23.
The Hot*ri*, Brahman, and Maitrâvaru*n*a (drink that) of the Sârasvata
(cup), for the Hot*ri* is the voice of the sacrifice, the Brahman its
heart, and the Maitrâvaru*n*a its mind: they thus consume each his own
share in his own abode.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:24">12:8:2:24</span></span>24.
The Sacrificer drinks (that of) the Aindra (cup), for this sacrifice,
the Sautrâma*n*î, belongs to Indra, and even now he who sacrifices has
his abode along with Indra: he thus consumes his own share in his own
abode.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:25">12:8:2:25</span></span>25.
The Â*s*vina cup, indeed, is the eye, the Sârasvata one the vital air,
and the Aindra one

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

speech. From the Â*s*vina (cup) he pours (the remains) into the
Sârasvata one, whereby he combines his eye with the vital airs; from the
Sârasvata cup) into the Aindra one, whereby he combines his vital airs
with his speech, and also establishes his vital airs in (the channel of)
speech, whence all the vital airs are established on speech.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:26">12:8:2:26</span></span>26.
Three (men) drink the Â*s*vina (cup), to wit, the Adhvaryu,
Pratiprasthât*ri*, and Agnîdh; for this eye is threefold--the white, the
black, and the pupil: he thus bestows on him the eye in accordance with
its form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:27">12:8:2:27</span></span>27.
Three (drink) the Sârasvata (cup), the Hot*ri*, Brahman, and
Maitrâvaru*n*a; for threefold divided is this vital air--the in (and
out)-breathing, the up-breathing, and the through-breathing: he thus
bestows on him the vital air in accordance with its form.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:28">12:8:2:28</span></span>28.
Singly the Sacrificer drinks the Aindra (cup), for single is that
distinction of the vital airs, speech: singly and solely to himself does
he take that distinction, speech; whence he who has performed the
Sautrâma*n*î becomes singly and solely the most distinguished among his
own people, and so does even he who knows this.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:29">12:8:2:29</span></span>29.
The officiating priests (*ri*tvi*g*), doubtless, are the seasons
(*ri*tu), and the draughts (of liquor) are the months;--six priests
drink, for there are six seasons: by means of the priests he thus
secures the seasons.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:30">12:8:2:30</span></span>30.
There are twelve draughts <span id="fr_628"></span>[1](#fn_626), and
twelve

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

months: by means of the draughts he thus secures the months. The priests
drink again and again by turns, whence the seasons and months succeed
one another by turns.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:31">12:8:2:31</span></span>31.
The thirteenth draught the Sacrificer takes, for, indeed, that
thirteenth month is manifestly the year itself: it is this he secures by
obtaining (that draught). And, indeed, the Sautrâma*n*î is the same as
the year, and by means of this he wins everything, and secures
everything for himself.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:32">12:8:2:32</span></span>32.
There are three victims, for three in number are these worlds: it is
these worlds he thereby secures,--to wit, this (terrestrial) world by
that of the A*s*vins, the air by that of Sarasvatî, and the sky by that
of Indra: he thus wins and secures these worlds for himself in
accordance with their (peculiar) form and deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:33">12:8:2:33</span></span>33.
There are three sacrificial cakes, for there are three seasons: it is
the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the summer by that of Indra,
the rainy season by that of Savit*ri*, and the winter by that of
Varu*n*a: he thus wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance
with their (peculiar) form and deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:34">12:8:2:34</span></span>34.
There are six cups (of milk and liquor), for there are six seasons: it
is the seasons he thereby secures,--to wit, the spring and summer by the
two Â*s*vina (cups), the rainy season and autumn by the two Sârasvata
ones, and the winter and dewy season by the two Aindra ones: he thus
wins and secures the seasons for himself in accordance with their form
and deity.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:35">12:8:2:35</span></span>35.
The invitatory and offering formulas are made continuous, and relate to
the same deities--

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

for the sake of the continuity and uninterruptedness of the seasons.
They are all of them invitatory-formulas and all offering-formulas <span
id="fr_629"></span>[1](#fn_627), whence all the seasons pass onwards,
and all of them return. All (the formulas) are first, all of them
intermediate, and all of them last, whence all the seasons are first,
all of them intermediate, and all of them last. All the cups have two
(formulas, an) invitatory and (an) offering-formula,--this is of the
form of day and night: it is the day and the night he thus secures for
himself; whence both the seasons and the months are established on day
and night.

<span class="margnote"><span id="12:8:2:36">12:8:2:36</span></span>36.
The Sautrâma*n*î, truly, is the same as the year, and the same as the
moon; and the Sacrificer is manifestly the sun: his vedi (altar-ground)
is this earth, his uttara-vedi the air, his barhis the sky, his
officiating priests the quarters, his fuel the trees, his ghee the
waters, his oblations the plants, his fire Agni himself, his sa*m*sthâ
(the particular form of sacrifice) the year--and, indeed, everything
here, whatever there is, is the year; whence he who has performed the
Sautrâma*n*î wins everything, and secures everything for himself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_609"></span>[239:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_611) Cf. II, 4, 4, 3-4,
where the latter is called Pratîdar*s*a *S*vaikna (king of the
*S*vikna), whilst the former, after studying with him, is said to have
been called Sahadeva Sâr*ñg*aya.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[240:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_612) The 'Somâ*ms*ava
iva' would seem to have here the force of 'Soma-shoots proper,' only
substitutes (milk and liquor) being used instead.

<span id="fn_611"></span>[240:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_613) That is to say,
the observance of the fast--by which the Sacrificer during the four days
of the performance of the Sautrâma*n*î, lives solely on the remains of
the Agnihotra--takes the place of the ordinary initiation of the
Soma-sacrifice, there being no Dîkshâ at the Sautrâma*n*î.

<span id="fn_612"></span>[240:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_614) The malted rice,
malted barley, and fried rice, referred to in <span id="page_241">p.
241</span> this and the next two paragraphs, refer to the remnants of
these materials, not used at first in the preparation of the Surâ, and
amounting to one-third of the original quantity of each; these being
added successively during the three nights during which the Surâ has to
mature; cf. [p. 223](sbe44067.htm#page_223), note
[2](sbe44067.htm#fn_583).

<span id="fn_613"></span>[241:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_615) Or, he renders
him, the Sacrificer (or, perhaps, it, the sacrifice), successful by
means of the morning-pressing.

<span id="fn_614"></span>[241:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_616) The literal
translation would seem to be,--he thus provides him with the respective
(sva) world, with the respective deity, and with the respective
form,--(hence) with the morning-pressing. It may be remarked, however,
that the deities here connected with the three services (the A*s*vins,
Sarasvatî, and Indra) are not those elsewhere associated with them
(Vasus, Rudras, and Âdityas, IV, 3, 5, 1; or Agni, Indra, Vi*s*ve
Devâ*h*, XI, 5, 9, 7).

<span id="fn_615"></span>[241:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_617) Viz. inasmuch as
it is full of moisture (saras).

<span id="fn_616"></span>[242:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_618) The 'enam' must
refer to the Surâ-liquor, treated as identical with Soma.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[242:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_619) I do not quite
understand the distinction between suta' and 'âsuta '; cf. XII, 8, 1, 6;
unless the former be the pure Soma-juice, and the latter that mixed with
other ingredients.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[242:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_620) The 'praisha' are
the directions by which the Maitrâvaru*n*a calls on the Hot*ri* to
recite the offering-formulas (cf. part ii, p. 183, note 2). For the
fore-offerings of the three victims, these directions are given, Vâ*g*.
S. XXI, 29-40. They all commence with 'Hotâ <span id="page_243">p.
243</span> yakshat' (may the Hot*ri* worship!), and end with 'paya*h*
soma*h* parisrutâ gh*ri*ta*m* madhu vyantv â*g*yasya hotar ya*g*a'
(milk, Soma, with parisrut-liquor, ghee, honey,--may they partake of the
butter, Hot*ri* worship!).

<span id="fn_619"></span>[243:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_621) ? Literally, 'by
(way of) milk'--or, perhaps, 'by the admixture of milk--Soma is (here,
as it were) produced.'

<span id="fn_620"></span>[243:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_622) In all the
directions referred to, the three deities are named.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[243:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_623) The two A*s*vins
are the physicians of the gods. Cf. IV, 1, 5, 8 seqq.; [XII, 7, 2,
3](sbe44066.htm#12:7:2:3).

<span id="fn_622"></span>[244:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_624) This refers to the
puro<sup>ऽ</sup>nuvâkyâs and yâ*g*yâs of the oblations of omentum (vapâ)
of the three victims. For these formulas the three verses, Vâ*g*. S. XX,
67-69, are used in such a way that verse 1 forms the anuvâkyâ, and verse
2 the yâ*g*yâ, of the A*s*vins’ oblation; verse 2 the anuvâkyâ, and
verse 3 the yâ*g*yâ, of Sarasvatî's oblation; and verse 3 the anuvâkyâ,
and verse 1 the yâ*g*yâ, of Indra's oblation. In each of the three
verses all the three deities are mentioned.--In exactly the same way the
three verses, XX, 70-72, are used as the anuvâkyâs and yâ*g*yâs of the
three pa*s*upuro*d*â*s*as; and 73-75 as those of the chief oblations
(havis) of meat-portions.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[244:2](sbe44069.htm#fr_625) The Âprîs
(propitiatory verses, cf. part ii, p. 185) are the offering-formulas
(yâ*g*yâ) of the eleven (or twelve) fore-offerings (prayâ*g*a) of the
animal sacrifice. Those used on the present occasion are the twelve
verses given, Vâ*g*. S. XX, 55-66; there being on this occasion (in the
second and third places) fore-offerings both to Tanûnapât and
Narâ*s*a*m*sa. In each of these verses, again, all three deities are
referred to.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[244:3](sbe44069.htm#fr_626) I do not exactly
know what formulas are thereby referred to. <span id="page_245">p.
245</span> It can hardly be the praishas of the anuyâ*g*as (Vâ*g*. S.
XXI, 48-58), as these are not in the *g*agatî, but in the (ârshî)
trish*t*ubh metre; though certainly each of them contains the names of
the three deities.

<span id="fn_625"></span>[245:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_627) Viz. the Adhvaryu,
and his two assistants, the Pratiprasthât*ri* and Agnîdh. Cf. [XII, 8,
1, 3](sbe44068.htm#12:8:1:3) seqq.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[246:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_628) Viz. inasmuch as
three priests partake of each of the first two cups of milk, and of the
first two cups of Surd-liquor, and each priest drinks twice.

<span id="fn_627"></span>[248:1](sbe44069.htm#fr_629) See [p.
244](#page_244), note , where it is shown that each of the three verses
serves successively as puro<sup>ऽ</sup>nuvâkyâ and as yâ*g*yâ.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Next: XII, 8, 3. Third Brâhma*n*a](sbe44070)
