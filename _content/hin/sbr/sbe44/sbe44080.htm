<P><A NAME="fn_726"></A><A HREF="sbe44080.htm#fr_730">289:1</A> Or, 'might I make offering with the life-sap of the horse?' the natural, as well as the technical, meaning of the term 'a<I>s</I>vamedha' being generally understood in these speculations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_727"></A><A HREF="sbe44080.htm#fr_731">289:2</A> The oblations offered prior to the initiation--here, as at any Soma-sacrifice--are called Audgrabha<I>n</I>a (elevatory) oblations. On the present occasion he, in the first place, performs, on each of the first six days of the D&icirc;ksh&acirc;, the four oblations of this kind offered at the ordinary Soma-sacrifice (for which see III, 1, 4, 1 seqq.); whilst on the seventh day he offers, instead of these, the six corresponding oblations of the Agni<I>k</I>ayana (which forms a necessary element of the A<I>s</I>vamedha), see VI, 6, 1, 15-20; for a further and final oblation offered on all these occasions, see <A HREF="#page_292">p. 292</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_732">1</A>. He then performs on each day three additional oblations <A NAME="page_290"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 290</FONT></A> (increased to four on the last day) which are peculiar to the A<I>s</I>vamedha, and vary from day to day in respect of the deities to whom they are offered. But whilst, in the <I>S</I>rautas&ucirc;tras, these special oblations are likewise called Audgrabha<I>n</I>a (Katy. XX, 4, 2-10), the author here applies to them the term Vai<I>s</I>vadeva, owing apparently to the fact of their being offered, not to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I> properly speaking, but to different deities. In the dogmatic explanation of the Audgrabha<I>n</I>as of the ordinary sacrifice, reference was also made (at III, 1, 4, 9) to the Vi<I>s</I>ve Dev&acirc;<I>h</I>, but only incidentally. Harisv&acirc;min, indeed, points out that the designation Vai<I>s</I>vadeva refers in the first place to the invocations (V&acirc;<I>g</I>. S. XXII, 20) used with these special oblations (as is, indeed, evident from <a href="sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:2">paragraph 2</A>; cf. also part ii, p. 20, note 1); and the total of seven applied to them does not therefore refer here (as it does in <a href="sbe44080.htm#13:1:7:4">paragraph 4</A>) to the four ordinary and the three special Audgrabha<I>n</I>a oblations, but to the series of dedicatory formulas relating to the latter oblations, as explained <A HREF="#page_291">p. 291</A>, note <A HREF="#fn_729">1</A>; and, of course, by implication, to the oblations themselves.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_728"></A><A HREF="sbe44080.htm#fr_732">290:1</A> Though the Initiation only becomes perfect by the Sacrificer being girded with a hempen zone, whilst kneeling on a double black-antelope skin, and by a staff being handed to him (III, 2, 1, 1-32); on the present occasion, the Sacrificer is on each day, after the performance of the Audgrabha<I>n</I>a oblations, at least to sit down on the antelope skin; whilst on the seventh and last day of the D&icirc;ksha<I>n</I>&icirc;yesh<I>t</I>i, the remaining ceremonies take place, after which those of the Agni<I>k</I>ayana, viz. the placing of the Ukh&acirc;, or fire-pan, on the fire and the putting of thirteen fire-sticks in the pan (VI, 6, 2, 1 seqq.), &amp;c.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_729"></A><A HREF="sbe44080.htm#fr_733">291:1</A> The ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc; XXII, 20 is made up of seven parts, each of which consists of three distinct invocations addressed to the same deity; the seven deities addressed in the whole formula being Ka, Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati, Aditi, Sarasvat&icirc;, P&ucirc;shan, Tvash<I>t</I><I>ri</I>, and Vish<I>n</I>u; whilst the three invocations to Ka, for instance, are 'K&acirc;ya sv&acirc;h&acirc;! Kasmai sv&acirc;h&acirc;! Katamasmai sv&acirc;h&acirc;!' Cf. <a href="sbe44081.htm#13:1:8:2">XIII, 1, 8, 2</A> seqq.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_730"></A><A HREF="sbe44080.htm#fr_734">291:2</A> Viz. either the Vasus, Rudras, and &Acirc;dityas (cf. IV, 5, 7, 2); or those of the sky, the air, and the earth, headed by S&ucirc;rya, V&acirc;yu, and Agni respectively.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_731"></A><A HREF="sbe44080.htm#fr_735">291:3</A> That is, the four Audgrabha<I>n</I>as of the ordinary Soma-sacrifice offered on each of the seven days of the D&icirc;ksh&acirc;, and two more added thereto on the seventh day.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_732"></A><A HREF="sbe44080.htm#fr_736">292:1</A> For a full discussion of this final Audgrabha<I>n</I>a oblation, the only one, it would seem, offered with the regular offering-spoon (<I>g</I>uh&ucirc;) filled by means of the dipping-spoon (sruva), see III, 1, 4, 2; 16-23; cf. also VI, 6, 1, 21.</P>
