The Pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc; water, doubtless, is the head of the sacrifice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_151"></A><A HREF="#fn_151"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and when he leads forward the Pra<I>n</I>&icirc;t&acirc; water, it is the head of the sacrifice he thereby forms, and he should know that it is that head of his own that is then being formed.</p>

The five fore-offerings are these its five (outlets of the) vital airs in the head;--the first fore-offering is its mouth, the second the right nostril, the third the left nostril, the fourth the right ear, and the fifth the left ear. And inasmuch as at the fourth fore-offering he pours together (the ghee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_154"></A><A HREF="#fn_154"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>), therefore this ear is, on the inner side, connected by a channel (with the other).

The three after-offerings are these its three downward breathings; and the S&ucirc;ktav&acirc;ka and <I>S</I>amyorv&acirc;ka its arms (or fore-feet); the four Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as the four supports--the two thighs and the two knee-bones; and the Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us is the two (hind) feet.</p>

These are twenty-one offerings;--two libations of ghee, five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, and Agni's cake: this makes ten; Agni and Soma's low-voiced offering, Agni and Soma's cake, the Agni Svish<I>t</I>ak<I>ri</I>t, the I<I>d</I>&acirc;, three after-offerings, the S&ucirc;ktav&acirc;ka, the <I>S</I>amyorv&acirc;ka, further his seizing (the two spoons) at the same time there at the Patn&icirc;sa<I>m</I>y&acirc;<I>g</I>as&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_159"></A><A HREF="#fn_159"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and (last) the Samish<I>t</I>aya<I>g</I>us.</p>

These are twenty-one offerings,--there are twelve months and five seasons in a year; and three worlds--that makes twenty; and yonder burning (sun) is the twenty-first--that is the goal&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_160"></A><A HREF="#fn_160"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>, that the resting-place: he thus reaches that goal, that resting-place.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:6:12">11:2:6:12</A></FONT></span>12. Now, as to this &Acirc;ru<I>n</I>i said, 'Every half-month, indeed, I become a sharer of the same world with yonder sun: that is the perfection of the Full and New-moon sacrifices which I know.'</p>

Let him say, 'The self-offerer;' for a self-offerer, doubtless, is he who knows, 'This my (new) body is formed by that (body of Ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>a, the sacrifice), this my (new) body is procured&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_161"></A><A HREF="#fn_161"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> thereby.' And even as a snake frees itself from its skin, so does he free himself from his mortal body, from sin; and made up of the <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>, the Ya<I>g</I>us, the S&acirc;man, and of offerings, does he pass on to the heavenly world.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="11:2:6:14">11:2:6:14</A></FONT></span>14. And a god-offerer, doubtless, is he who knows, 'I am now offering sacrifice to the gods, I am serving the gods,'--such a one is like an inferior who brings tribute to his superior, or like a man of the people who brings tribute to the king: verily, he does not win such a place (in heaven) as the other.</p>
