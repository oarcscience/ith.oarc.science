### THIRD BRÂHMA*N*A.

#### THE VAPÂ-OFFERINGS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:1">13:5:3:1</span></span>1. Now
as to the offering of the omenta. 'They should proceed with them singly
up to the omentum of the Vai*s*vadeva (victim) <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[1](#fn_1019); and when the omentum of the
Vai*s*vadeva has been offered, they should thereupon offer the others,'
said Satyakâma *G*âbâla; 'for, doubtless, the All-Gods (Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*)
are all (sarve) the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them deity
after deity.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:2">13:5:3:2</span></span>2.
'When the omentum of the Aindrâgna (victim) has been offered, they
should thereupon offer the others,' said the two Saumapa
Mânutantavya;'for, doubtless, Indra and Agni are all the gods: it is in
this way he gratifies them deity after deity.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:3">13:5:3:3</span></span>3.
'When the omentum of the (victim) sacred to Ka has been offered, they
should thereupon offer

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

the others,' said *S*ailâli; 'for, doubtless, Ka is Pra*g*âpati, and
behind Pra*g*âpati are all the gods: it is in this way he gratifies them
deity after deity.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:4">13:5:3:4</span></span>4.
'Having gone through the twenty-one deities of the Seasonal <span
id="fr_1025"></span>[1](#fn_1020) (victims), let them proceed by
dividing (the omenta) into twenty-one parts <span
id="fr_1026"></span>[2](#fn_1021),' said Bhâllaveya; 'for as many as
there are Seasonal deities so many are all the gods: it is in this way
he gratifies them deity after deity.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:5">13:5:3:5</span></span>5. 'Let
them proceed (with the omenta) singly and not otherwise,' said Indrota
Saunaka; 'why, indeed, should they hasten? It is in this way he
gratifies them deity after deity.' This, then, is what these have said,
but the established practice is different therefrom.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:6">13:5:3:6</span></span>6. Now
Yâ*gñ*avalkya said, 'They should proceed simultaneously with the
(omenta) of Pra*g*âpati's <span id="fr_1027"></span>[3](#fn_1022)
(victims), and simultaneously with those consecrated to single gods: it
is in this way that he gratifies them deity after deity, that he goes
straightway to the completion of the sacrifice, and does not stumble.'

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:7">13:5:3:7</span></span>7. When
the omenta have been offered, the Adhvaryu enters (the Havirdhâna shed)
and draws

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pra*g*âpati's
second Mahiman cup of Soma in a silver vessel. The Puroru*k* thereof is
(Vâ*g*. XXIII, 3), 'He who by his greatness hath become the one king of
the breathing and blinking world, \[and who here ruleth over the
two-footed and the four-footed: to the god Ka (Who?) will we pay homage
by offering\].' The Anuvâkyâ and Yâ*g*yâ are interchanged so as to
(ensure) unimpaired vigour <span id="fr_1028"></span>[1](#fn_1023), and
the Praisha (direction to Hot*ri*) is the same (as that of the first
cup). As the Vasha*t* is uttered, he offers with (Vâ*g*. S. XXIII, 4),
'What greatness of thine there hath been in the night, and the year,
\[what greatness of thine there hath been in the earth and the fire;
what greatness of thine there hath been in the Nakshatras and the moon,
to that greatness of thine, to Pra*g*âpati, to the gods, hail <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[2](#fn_1024)\].' He does not repeat the Vasha*t*:
the significance of this has been explained.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:8">13:5:3:8</span></span>8. Of
the blood of the other victims they make no sacrificial portions; of
(that of) the horse they do make portions <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[3](#fn_1025). Of (the blood of) the others they
make portions <span id="fr_1031"></span>[4](#fn_1026) on the south side,
of (that of) the horse on the north side (of the altar); of (the blood
of) the others he makes portions on (a mat of) plaksha (ficus
infectoria) twigs, of (that of) the horse on rattan twigs.

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:9">13:5:3:9</span></span>9. But
concerning this, Sâtyaya*gñ*i said, 'They may indeed do it in either
way, only one must not depart from the (right) path.' But the former,
indeed, is the established practice. The sacrifice (of the second day)
is an Ukthya: thereby he causes the air-world to prosper. The last day
is an Atirâtra with all the Stomas, for him to obtain and secure
everything, for the Atirâtra with all the Stomas is everything, and the
A*s*vamedha is everything.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:10">13:5:3:10</span></span>10.
Its Bahishpavamâna (stotra) is in the Triv*ri*t (9-versed Stoma), the
Â*g*ya (stotras) in the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a (15-versed), the
Mâdhyandina-pavamâna in the Saptada*s*a (17), the P*ri*sh*th*as in the
Ekavi*ms*a (21), the T*ri*tîya Pavamâna in the Tri*n*ava (27), the
Agnish*t*oma-sâman in the Trayastri*ms*a (33), the Ukthas in the
Ekavi*ms*a (21), the Sho*d*a*s*in in the Ekavi*ms*a, the night (chants)
in the Pa*ñk*ada*s*a, the Sandhi (twilight chant) in the Triv*ri*t (9).
Whatever *S*astra is (recited) for the second day of the P*ri*sh*th*ya
Sha*d*aha that is (used at) the Atirâtra sacrifice <span
id="fr_1032"></span>[1](#fn_1027); thereby he causes yonder (heavenly)
world to prosper.

<span class="margnote"><span id="13:5:3:11">13:5:3:11</span></span>11.
'There are twenty-one Savanîya victims, all of them consecrated to Agni,
and there is one and the same performance for them,' so say some; but
let him rather immolate those twenty-four bovine (victims <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[2](#fn_1028)) for twelve deities,--twelve months
are a year, and the year is everything, and the A*s*vamedha

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

is everything: thus it is for the sake of his obtaining and securing
everything.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1019"></span>[392:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1024) Whilst there are
amongst the victims immolated on the second day, several others
consecrated to the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, Indra and Agni, and Ka,--the
Vai*s*vadeva, Aindrâgna, and Kâya victims, referred to in this and the
following two paragraphs, belong to the Kâturmâsya, or Seasonal victims,
being amongst those tied to the fourteenth and sixteenth stakes. Though
the text speaks only of one Vai*s*vadeva &c. victim, there are really
three such victims in each case. According to the views referred to in
these paragraphs (cf. comm. on Kâty. XX, 7, 23), the omenta of all the
preceding victims (from the 'paryaṅgya' onwards) up to the beginning of
the Kâturmâsyas, would be offered together after (or along with) the
vapâs of those of the respective victims (Vai*s*vadeva &c.) specified in
these paragraphs; and along therewith the vapâs of all the subsequent
Seasonal victims. The deities to which this heap of omenta would be
offered, would thus be either the Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*, or Indra and Agni, or
Ka, as representing all the deities. Â*s*v. S. X, 9, 7, assigns the
omenta of all the victims, except the three Prâ*g*âpatya ones, to the
Vi*s*ve Devâ*h*.

<span id="fn_1020"></span>[393:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1025) See [p.
309](sbe44087.htm#page_309), note [2](sbe44087.htm#fn_787).

<span id="fn_1021"></span>[393:2](sbe44108.htm#fr_1026) According to
this view, the omenta of all the victims after the three first
(Prâ*g*âpatya) ones,--i.e. beginning from the 'paryaṅgya' animals (see
[p. 299](sbe44084.htm#page_299), note [2](sbe44084.htm#fn_755)) up to
the end of the *K*âturmâsya, or Seasonal victims, which are the last of
the domesticated animals--would be put together in one heap and divided
into twenty-one portions, which would then be offered to the first
twenty-one deities of the Seasonal offerings, that is to say, to those
of the Vai*s*vadeva, Varu*n*apraghâsa, Sâkamedha, and Mahâhavis
offerings, thus omitting the deities of the Pitryesh*t*i and the
*S*unâsîriya offerings.

<span id="fn_1022"></span>[393:3](sbe44108.htm#fr_1027) That is the
first three victims, viz. the horse, the hornless he-goat, and the
Gom*ri*ga.

<span id="fn_1023"></span>[394:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1028) By simple
repetition this would be impaired.

<span id="fn_1024"></span>[394:2](sbe44108.htm#fr_1029) See [XIII, 2,
11, 2](sbe44093.htm#13:2:11:2) with note.

<span id="fn_1025"></span>[394:3](sbe44108.htm#fr_1030) See [XIII, 3, 4,
2](sbe44097.htm#13:3:4:2)-[5](sbe44097.htm#13:3:4:5).

<span id="fn_1026"></span>[394:4](sbe44108.htm#fr_1031) This would be an
alternative view. According to the scholl. on Katy. XX, 8, 1-3, this
would seem to refer to the other Prâ*g*âpatya victims, in which case one
would, however, expect the dual here, as there are only two of them
besides the horse.

<span id="fn_1027"></span>[395:1](sbe44108.htm#fr_1032) In the same way
Â*s*v. S. X, 4, 8 lays down the rule that the *S*astras of the second
day are those of the fifth day of the Vyû*dh*a P*ri*sh*th*ya-sha*d*aha;
cf. above, [XIII, 5, 1, 7](sbe44106.htm#13:5:1:7) seqq.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[395:2](sbe44108.htm#fr_1033) See [XIII, 3, 2,
3](sbe44095.htm#13:3:2:3).
