*Dakshinamurti Stotra*, translated by Alladi Mahadeva Sastri, \[1920\],
at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

In this edition the Sanskrit texts of *Manasollasa* and
*Pranava-vartika* have been added, while in the first edition the texts
of *Dakshinamurti-stotra* and *Dakshinamurti-Upanishad* were alone given
in the form of an appendix, separately from their translations. All the
four texts are here embodied along with their English translations, for
convenient reference. The text of the *Manasollasa* followed in the
first Edition has been revised with the aid of the Mss. of the Adyar
Library; and this has rendered necessary some changes in the text and
the translation here and there. In other respects the second edition
remains the same as the first.
