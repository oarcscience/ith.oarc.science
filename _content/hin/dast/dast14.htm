<p>Because the universality of Atman has thus been explained in this hymn, therefore by hearing it, by reflecting and meditating upon its teaching, and by reciting it, that Divine State which is endued with the mighty grandeur of being the Universal Self shall, of itself, come into being, as also that unimpeded Divine Power presenting itself in forms eight.</p>  
<p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">The Highest end.</h4>  
<p>1. To attain to the (natural) state of the Universal Ego, by giving up the casual state of the limited Ego, is declared (in the tenth stanza) to be the end of this hymn.</p>  
<p><small>The Ego is, in Himself, one and universal. He becomes many and detached only by attachment to the bodies which are many and separate from one another. The aim of the hymn is to produce, in man, a conviction of this truth and thereby to reclaim the Ego from his present separate existence and life.</p>  
<p>The meaning of the tenth stanza may be explained as follows:</small></p>  
<p>2. Sons, grandsons, houses, lands, money, grain, all in plenty&#8212;these lower ends, too, accrue in svarga, in p&acirc;t&agrave;la and on the earth.</p>  
<p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></A></p>  
<p><small>Though the devotee will attain all things of desire by this hymn, yet the wise man should not resort to it for attaining such lower ends as these. He should ever aim at the highest object, nothing short of attaining to the state of Paramesvara Himself. That being achieved, everything else will have been attained as a matter of course.</small></p>  
<p>3. As cold is warded off from him who is engaged in cooking, so by this hymn all gain will accrue to him incidentally.</p>  
<p>4. Lordliness is in the very nature of Isvara, the Divine Being. It has, indeed, no separate existence from Him. Though man may be running, yet his shadow accompanies him.</p>  
<p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></A></p>  
<p>5. Infinite Power is in the nature of Isvara, the Divine Being, and <i>anim&acirc;</i> and the like are only a few drops that trickle down from it. When the devotee has himself become Isvara, they come to him of themselves.</p>  
<p>6. Atman is none other than Sad&acirc;siva, and it is by drops of Atman's power that Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva shine so powerful.</p>  
<p>7. By him who carries a flower, its odour is enjoyed without his seeking for By him who has realised. himself as I. the Universal Ego, the limited powers (of Brahma, etc.) are enjoyed.</p>  <h4 align="center">The Eight Siddhis.</h4>  
<p><a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 184</font></A></p>  
<p>8. Anim&acirc; (smallness), Mahim&acirc; (vastness), Garim&acirc; (heaviness), Laghim&acirc; (lightness), Pr&acirc;pti (range of vision), Pr&acirc;k&acirc;mya (freedom of will), Isitva (power to command), Vasitva (power to control)&#8212;these are the <i>eight siddhis</i> (powers).</p>  
<p>9. The power called <i>anim&agrave;</i> (smallness) consists in the all-pervading Paramatman entering into extremely small creatures as their Atman.</p>  
<p>10. The power called <i>mahim&agrave;</i> (vastness) consists in the group of the thirty-six principles, from Brahmanda to Siva, pervading every-where outside.</p>  
<p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></A></p>  
<p>11. The wise hold that <i>laghim&agrave;</i> (lightness) consists in (the Yogin)&#8212;whose body is equal to Mahameru&#8212;being as light as cotton when being lifted up.</p>  
<p>12. The wise hold that <i>garim&agrave;</i> (heaviness) consists in (the Yogin)&#8212;whose body is as small as an atom&#8212;being as heavy as Meru when being lifted up.</p>  
<p>13. The power called <i>pr&agrave;jpti</i> (range of vision) consists in a person who lives in P&acirc;t&acirc;la seeing the Brahmaloka; and it is very hard to attain for those who are not Yogins.</p>  
<p>14. The attaining, by one's own mere will, of power to journey through the</p>  
<p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></A></p>  
<p>sky and of other such powers is called <i>pr&acirc;k&agrave;mya</i> (freedom of will).</p>  
<p>15. Some declare that there is a power called <i>pv&agrave;k&agrave;s&#8217;ya</i> (luminosity), in virtue of which all things shine in the light of the Yogin's own body.</p>  
<p>16. The power to cause, by mere will, a creation of one's own, its continuance, and dissolution, and to command the sun and the like is called <i>Isitva</i> (supremacy).</p>  
<p>17. <i>Vasitva</i> (the power of controlling) consists in having all the worlds as well as the lords of those worlds under one's</p>  
<p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></A></p>  
<p>own control; and it is easy for Siva-Yogins to acquire that power.</p>  <h4 align="center">Glory of the Divine Contemplation</h4>  
<p>18. Devas are under the control of that Br&acirc;hmana who contemplates as above: what need is there to say that princes, tigers, snakes, women, men, and the like (are subject to his control)?</p>  
<p>19. To those in whose minds the conviction as to their being one with the Universal Ego holds an unintermittent sway, to those who are perfect in sam&acirc;dhi, what is there which cannot be attained?</p>  
<p>20, The wise man should recite this hymn and contemplate on the idea that</p>  
<p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></A></p>  
<p>he is the Self in all, abandoning all yearning for the lesser fruits arising from svarga and so on.</p>  
<p>21. No wise man, indeed, ever looks upon the kingdom of svarga as a great empire. That alone is his empire, namely, the identity of his Self with the Supreme Being.</p>  
<p>22. All siddhis (powers) come to him who ever contemplates the Self in all. Wherefore, with the mind controlled, one should hold his empire in the Atman.</p>  <h4 align="center">Love of God and Guru essential for wisdom.</h4>  
<p>23. "Who so hath highest love for God, and for the Guru as for God, to that</p>  
<p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Mah&acirc;tman the truths here taught shine in full."</p>  
<p>24. He Who, by His power of light, affords light to all lights, Who lights the whole universe, may that Light shine full in His light!</p>  
<p>25. Thus ends the tenth chapter in brief in the work called M&acirc;nasoll&acirc;sa, which expounds the meaning of the Hymn to the Blessed Dakshin&acirc;m&ucirc;rti.</p>
