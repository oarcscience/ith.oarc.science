*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

37\. Thereby the omnipresence (of Brahman is established), in accordance
with the statements about (Brahman's) extent.

The preceding demonstration that the texts calling Brahman a bank, and
so on, are not to be taken literally, and that, on the other hand, the
texts denying all plurality must be accepted as they stand., moreover,
serves to prove that the Self is omnipresent. If the former texts were
taken literally, banks and the like would have to be looked upon as
belonging to the Self, and thence it would follow that the Self is
limited. And if the texts of the latter class were not accepted as
valid, there would be substances exclusive of each other, and thus the
Self would again be limited.--That the Self is omnipresent follows from
the texts proclaiming its extent, &c., cp. *Kh*. Up. VIII, 1, 3, 'As
large as this ether is, so large is that ether within the heart;' 'Like
the ether, he is omnipresent and eternal;' 'He is greater than the sky,
greater than the ether' (*S*at. Br. X, 6, 3, 2); 'He is eternal,
omnipresent, firm, immoveable' (Bha. Gîtâ II, 24); and other similar
passages from *S*ruti and Sm*ri*ti.
