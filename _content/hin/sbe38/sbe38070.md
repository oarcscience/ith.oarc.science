16\. And on account of the permanence of this (viz. the embodied soul).

This embodied soul abides permanently in this body as the enjoyer, since
it can be affected by good and evil and can experience pleasure and
pain. Not so the gods; for they exist in the state of highest power and
glory and cannot possibly enter, in this wretched body, into the
condition of enjoyers. So scripture also says, 'Only what is good
approaches him; verily evil does not approach the devas' (B*ri*. Up. I,
5. 20).--And only with the embodied soul the prâ*n*as are permanently
connected, as it is seen that when the soul passes out &c. the prâ*n*as
follow it. This we see from passages such as the following: 'When it
passes out the prâ*n*a passes out after it, and when the prâ*n*a thus
passes out all the other prâ*n*as pass after it' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 2).
Hence although there are ruling divinities of the organs, the embodied
soul does not cease to be the enjoyer; for the divinities are connected
with the organs only, not with the state of the soul as enjoyer.
