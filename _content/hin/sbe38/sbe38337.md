21\. And on account of the indications of equality of enjoyment only.

The lordly power of those who take their stand on the effected Brahman
is not absolute, for that reason also that scripture teaches that their
enjoyment only is equal to that of the eternally perfect Lord. For
scripture contains statements and indications of the difference (of the
Lord and the released soul); compare 'To him he says, Water indeed is
enjoyed <span id="fr_237"></span>[1](sbe38338.htm#fn_237) (by me); that
world (is to be enjoyed by thee also)' (Kau. Up. I, 7); 'As all beings
honour that deity, so do all beings honour him who knows that' (B*ri*.
Up. I, 5, 20); 'He obtains through it equality (in body) and sameness of
abode with that deity' (B*ri*. Up. I, 5, 23). But from the circumstance
of the lordly power of the released souls not being absolute it follows
that it comes to an end, and then they will have to return from the
world of Brahman!--To this objection the reverend Bâdarâya*n*a replies
in the following Sûtra.
