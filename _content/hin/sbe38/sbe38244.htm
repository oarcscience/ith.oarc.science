Scripture also shows that he who is furnished with such means as Brahma<I>k</I>arya, &amp;c., is not overpowered by such afflictions as passion and the like. Compare the passage, 'That Self does not perish which they find out by Brahma<I>k</I>arya' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VIII,,";, 3).--It is thus a settled conclusion that sacrifices and so on are works incumbent on the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas as well as co-operative towards knowledge.</p>
