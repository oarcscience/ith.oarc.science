<p>21. And on account of the indications of equality of enjoyment only.</p>  
<p>The lordly power of those who take their stand on the effected Brahman is not absolute, for that reason also that scripture teaches that their enjoyment only is equal to that of the eternally perfect Lord. For scripture contains statements and indications of the difference (of the Lord and the released soul); compare 'To him he says, Water indeed is enjoyed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="sbe38338.htm#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> (by me); that world (is to be enjoyed by thee also)' (Kau. Up. I, 7); 'As all beings honour that deity, so do all beings honour him who knows that' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. I, 5, 20); 'He obtains through it equality (in body) and sameness of abode with that deity' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. I, 5, 23). But from the circumstance of the lordly power of the released souls not being absolute it follows that it comes to an end, and then they will have to return from the world of Brahman!--To this objection the reverend B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a replies in the following S&ucirc;tra.</p>
