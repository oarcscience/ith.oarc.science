<p>9. And on account of the (omk&acirc;ra) extending over the whole (Veda), (the view that the term udg&icirc;tha expresses a specialisation) is appropriate.</p>  
<p>In the passage, 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the udg&icirc;tha,' the two words 'omk&acirc;ra' and 'udg&icirc;tha' are placed in co-ordination.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_132"></A><A HREF="#fn_132"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The question then arises</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_197"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 197</FONT></A></p>  
<p>whether the relation in which the ideas conveyed by these two words stand to each other is the relation of super-imposition (adhy&acirc;sa) or sublation (apav&acirc;da) or unity (ekatva) or specification (vi<I>s</I>esha<I>n</I>a); for prim&acirc; facie each of these relations may present itself to the mind.--Adhy&acirc;sa takes place when the idea of one of two things not being dismissed from the mind, the idea of the second thing is superimposed on that of the first thing; so that together with the superimposed idea the former idea remains attached to the thing on which the second idea is superimposed. When e.g. the idea of (the entity) Brahman superimposes itself upon the idea of the name, the latter idea continues in the mind and is not driven out by the former. A similar instance is furnished by the superimposition of the idea of the god Vishnu on a statue of Vishnu. So, in the case under discussion also, the idea of the udg&icirc;tha may be superimposed on the omk&acirc;ra or the idea of the omk&acirc;ra on the udg&icirc;tha.--We, in the second place, have apav&acirc;da when an idea previously attached to some object is recognised as false and driven out by the true idea springing up after the false one. So e.g. when the false idea of the body, the senses, and so on being the Self is driven out by the true idea springing up later--and expressed by judgments such as 'Thou art that'--that the idea of the Self is to be attached to the Self only. Or, to quote another example, when a previous mistaken notion as to the direction of the points of the compass is replaced by the true notion. So here also the idea of the udg&icirc;tha may drive out the idea of the omk&acirc;ra or vice vers&acirc;.--The relation would, in the third place, be that of 'unity' if the terms 'omk&acirc;ra' and 'udg&icirc;tha' were co-extensive in meaning; just as the terms, 'the Best of the Twice-born,' 'the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a,' 'the god among men,' all denote an individual of the noblest caste.--The relation will, finally, be that of specification if, there being a possibility of our understanding the omk&acirc;ra in so far as co-extensive with all the Vedas, the term 'udg&icirc;tha' calls up the idea of the sphere of action of the udg&acirc;t<I>ri</I>. The passage would then mean, 'Let a man meditate on that omk&acirc;ra which is the udg&icirc;tha,' and would</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A></p>  
<p>be analogous to an injunction such as 'Let him bring that lotus-flower which is blue.'</p>  
<p>All these alterations present themselves to the mind, and as there is no reason for deciding in favour of any one, the question must remain an unsettled one.</p>  
<p>To this p&ucirc;rvapaksha-view the S&ucirc;tra replies, 'And on account of extending over the whole, it is appropriate.'</p>  
<p>The word 'and' stands here in place of 'but,' and is meant to discard the three other alternatives. Three out of the four alternatives are to be set aside as objectionable; the fourth, against which nothing can be urged, is to be adopted.--The objections lying against the first three alternatives are as follows. In the case of adhy&acirc;sa we should have to admit that the word which expresses the idea superimposed is not to be taken in its direct sense, but in an implied sense&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_133"></A><A HREF="#fn_133"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>; and we should moreover have to imagine some fruit for a meditation of that kind.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_134"></A><A HREF="#fn_134"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Nor can it be said that we need not imagine such a fruit, as scripture itself mentions it in the passage, 'He becomes indeed a fulfiller of desires' (I, 1, 7); for this passage indicates the fruit, not of the ideal superimposition of the udg&icirc;tha on the omk&acirc;ra, but of the meditation in which the omk&acirc;ra is viewed as the fulfilment of desires.--Against the hypothesis of an apav&acirc;da there likewise lies the objection that no fruit is to be seen. The cessation of wrong knowledge can certainly not be alleged as such; for we see no reason why the cessation of the idea that the omk&acirc;ra is udg&icirc;tha and not omk&acirc;ra or vice vers&acirc; should be beneficial to man. Sublation of the one idea by the other is moreover not even possible in our case; for to the omk&acirc;ra the idea of the omk&acirc;ra remains always attached, and so to the udg&icirc;tha the idea of the udg&icirc;tha. The passage, moreover, does not aim at teaching the true</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_199"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 199</FONT></A></p>  
<p>nature of something, but at enjoining a meditation of a certain kind.--The hypothesis of unity again is precluded by the consideration that as in that case one term would suffice to convey the intended meaning, the employment of two terms would be purposeless. And moreover the term 'udg&icirc;tha' is never used to denote the omk&acirc;ra in its connexion with the <I>Ri</I>g-veda and Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda; nor is the word 'omk&acirc;ra' used to denote that entire second subdivision of a s&acirc;man which is denoted by the word 'udg&icirc;tha.' Hence it cannot be said that we have to do with different words only denoting one and the same thing.--There thus remains the fourth alternative, 'On account of its comprising all the Vedas.' That means: In order that the omk&acirc;ra may not be understood here as that one which comprises all the Vedas, it is specified by means of the word 'udg&icirc;tha,' in order that that omk&acirc;ra which constitutes a part of the udg&icirc;tha may be apprehended.--But does not this interpretation also involve the admission of implication, as according to it the word 'udg&icirc;tha' denotes not the whole udg&icirc;tha but only a part of it, viz. the omk&acirc;ra?--True, but we have to distinguish those cases in which the implied meaning is not far remote from the direct meaning and those in which it is remote. If, in the present case, we embrace the alternative of adhy&acirc;sa, we have to assume an altogether remote implication, the idea of one matter being superimposed on the idea of an altogether different matter. If, on the other hand, we adopt the alternative of specification, the implication connected therewith is an easy one, the word which in its direct sense denotes the whole being understood to denote the part. And that words denoting the whole do duty for words denoting the part is a matter of common occurrence; the words 'cloth,' 'village,' and many others are used in this fashion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_135"></A><A HREF="#fn_135"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>.--For all these reasons we declare that the appropriate view of the <I>Kh</I>&acirc;ndogya-passage is to take the word 'udg&icirc;tha' as specialising the term 'omk&acirc;ra&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_136"></A><A HREF="#fn_136"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>.'</p>
