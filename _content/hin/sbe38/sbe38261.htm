<p>52. No such definite rule (exists) as to the fruit which is release, on account of the assertions as to that condition, on account of the assertions as to that condition.</p>  
<p>We have seen that in the case of persons desirous of release who rely upon the means of knowledge there exists a definite difference of result, in so far as the knowledge resulting springs up either in this life or a future life according to the degree of strength of the means employed. It might now be supposed that there exists a similar definite difference with regard to the fruit characterised as final release, owing to the superior or inferior qualification of the persons knowing.</p>  
<p>With reference to this possible doubt the S&ucirc;tra now says, 'No such definite rule as to that fruit which is release.' That means: We must not suppose that in the case of that fruit which is release there exists an analogous definite rule a difference.--Why?--'On account of the assertions (by scripture about that condition.' For all Ved&acirc;nta-texts assert the state of final release to be of one kind only. The state of final release is nothing but Brahman, and Brahman cannot be connected with different forms since many scriptural passages assert it to have one nature only. Compare e.g. 'It is neither coarse nor fine' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. III, 8, 8); 'That Self is to be described by No, no' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. III, 9, 26); 'Where one sees nothing else' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VII, 24, 1); 'That immortal Brahman is before' (Mu. Up. II, 2, 11); 'This everything is that Self (B<I>ri</I>. Up. II, 4, 6);</p>

<p>'This great unborn Self, undecaying, undying, immortal, fearless, is indeed Brahman' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 4. 2, 5); 'When the Self only is all this how should he see another?' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 5, 15).--Moreover the means of knowledge might perhaps, according to their individual strength, impart a higher (or lower) degree to their result, viz. knowledge, but not to the result of knowledge, viz. release; for, as we have explained more than once, release is not something which is to be brought about, but something whose nature is permanently established, and is reached through knowledge. Nor does, in reality, knowledge admit of lower or higher degree; for it is, in its own nature, high only, and would not be knowledge at all if it were low. Although therefore knowledge may differ in so far as it originates after a long or short time, it is impossible that release should be distinguished by a higher or lower degree. And from the absence of difference of knowledge also there follows absence of definite distinction on the part of the result of knowledge (viz. release). The whole case is analogous to that of the results of works. In that knowledge which is the means of release there is no difference as there is between works. In those cognitions, on the other hand, which have the qualified Brahman for its object--such as 'he who consists of mind, whose body is pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a'--a difference is possible according to the addition or omission of qualities, and hence there may be a definite distinction of results, just as there is between the results of actions. This is also indicated by the passage, 'according as they meditate on him they become.' But in meditations on Brahman devoid of qualities it is otherwise. Thus Sm<I>ri</I>ti also says, 'No higher road is possible for any one; for they speak of inequality only where there are qualities.'--The repetition of the clause on account of the assertions as to that condition' indicates the termination of the adhy&acirc;ya.</p>
