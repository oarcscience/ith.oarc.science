38\. On account of the reversal of power.

The soul distinct from 'understanding' has to be viewed as an agent for
the following reason also. If the buddhi which is denoted by the term
'understanding' were the agent, there would take place a reversal of
power, i.e. the instrumental power which appertains to the buddhi would
have to be set aside, and to be replaced by the power of an agent. But
if the buddhi has the power of an agent, it must be admitted that it is
also the object of self-consciousness

(ahampratyaya) <span id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33), since we see that
everywhere activity is preceded by self-consciousness, 'I go, I come, I
eat, I drink,' &c. But if the buddhi is endowed with the power of an
agent and effects all things, we have to assume for it another
instrument by means of which it effects everything. For we see that
agents although themselves capable of acting yet become really active
only through making use of instruments.--Hence the whole dispute is
about a name only, and there is no real difference, since in either case
that which is different from the instrument of action is admitted to be
the agent.

virtually identify the buddhi with the *g*îva, the individual soul.
