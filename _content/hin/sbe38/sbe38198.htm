<p>55. But the (meditations) connected with members (of sacrificial acts are) not (restricted) to (particular) <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, according to the Veda (to which they belong).</p>  
<p>The above occasional discussion being terminated, we return to the discussion of the matter in hand.--We meet in the different <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s of each Veda with injunctions of vidy&acirc;s connected with certain members of sacrificial acts, such as the udg&icirc;tha and the like. Cp. e.g. 'Let a man meditate on the syllable Om (as) the udg&icirc;tha' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. I, 1, 1); 'Let a man meditate on the fivefold S&acirc;man as the five worlds' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. II, 2, I); 'People say: "Hymns, hymns!" the hymn is truly this earth' (Ait. &Acirc;r. II, 1, 2, 1); 'The piled up fire-altar truly is this world' (<I>S</I>at. Br&acirc;. X, 5, 4, 1). A doubt here arises whether the vidy&acirc;s are enjoined with reference to the udg&icirc;tha and so on as belonging to a certain <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; only or as belonging to all <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s. The doubt is raised on the supposition that the udg&icirc;tha and so on differ in the different <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s because the accents, &amp;c. differ.</p>  
<p>Here the p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that the vidy&acirc;s are enjoined only with reference to the udg&icirc;tha and so on which belong to the particular <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; (to which the vidy&acirc; belongs).--Why?--On account of proximity. For as such general injunctions as 'Let a man meditate on the udg&icirc;tha' are in need of a specification, and as this need is satisfied by the specifications given in the same <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; which stand in immediate proximity, there is no reason for passing over that <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; and having recourse to specifications enjoined</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_273"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 273</FONT></A></p>  
<p>in other <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s. Hence the vidy&acirc;s are to be held apart, according to the <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s to which they belong.</p>  
<p>To this the S&ucirc;tra replies 'but those connected with members,' &amp;c.--The word 'but' discards the prim&acirc; facie view. The meditations are not restricted to their own <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s according to the Veda to which they belong, but are valid for all <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s.--Why?--Because the direct statements of the texts about the udg&icirc;tha and so on enounce no specification. For to such general injunctions as 'Let a man meditate on the udg&icirc;tha'--which say nothing about specifications--violence would be done, if on the ground of proximity we restricted them to something special belonging to its own <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, and that would be objectionable because direct statement has greater weight than proximity. There is, on the other hand, no reason why the vidy&acirc; should not be of general reference. We therefore conclude that, although the <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s differ as to accents and the like, the vidy&acirc;s mentioned refer to the udg&icirc;tha and so on belonging to all <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;s, because the text speaks only of the udg&icirc;tha and so on in general.</p>
