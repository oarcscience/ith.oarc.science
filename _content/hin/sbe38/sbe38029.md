28\. On account of the separate statement (of soul and intelligence).

From the passage 'Having by knowledge taken possession of the body'
which represents the soul and intelligence as separate, viz. as
respectively the agent and the instrument of action, we understand that
the soul pervades the body only by means of intelligence, its quality.
Again the passage 'Then (the intelligent person) having through the
intelligence of the senses absorbed within himself all intelligence'

agent, i.e. the embodied soul, and so likewise confirms our view.--The
reply to all this is as follows.
