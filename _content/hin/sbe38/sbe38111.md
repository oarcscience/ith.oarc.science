8\. Hence the awaking from that (viz. Brahman).

And because the Self only is the place of deep sleep, on that account
the scriptural chapters treating of sleep invariably teach that the
awaking takes place from that Self. In the B*ri*. Up. when the time
comes for the answer to the question, 'Whence did he come back?' (II, 1,
16) the text

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

says, 'As small sparks come forth from fire, thus all prâ*n*as come
forth from that Self (II, 1, 20). And *Kh*. Up. VI, 10, 2, we read:
'When they have come back from the True they do not know that they have
come back from the True.' If there were optional places to which the
soul might resort in deep sleep, scripture would teach us that it awakes
sometimes from the nâ*d*îs, sometimes from the pericardium, sometimes
from the Self.--For that reason also the Self is the place of deep
sleep.
