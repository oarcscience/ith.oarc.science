<p>8. If it be said (that the vidy&acirc;s are one) on account of (the identity of) name; (we reply that) that is explained (already); moreover that (identity of name) is (found in the case of admittedly separate vidy&acirc;s).</p>  
<p>Here it might be said that after all the unity of the two vidy&acirc;s discussed must be admitted, since they are called by one and the same name, viz. 'the science of the udg&icirc;tha.'--But this argument is of no avail against what has been said under the preceding S&ucirc;tra. The decision there advocated has the advantage of following the letter of the revealed text; the name 'udg&icirc;tha-vidy&acirc;' on the other hand is not a part of the revealed text, but given to the vidy&acirc;s for convenience sake by ordinary men for the reason that the word 'udg&icirc;tha' is met with in the text.--Moreover, we observe that admittedly separate meditations such as the two mentioned under the last S&ucirc;tra have one and the same name. Similarly altogether separate sacrificial performances, such as the agnihotra, the dar<I>s</I>ap&ucirc;r<I>n</I>am&acirc;sa, and so on, are all comprised under the one name K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka, merely because they are recorded in the one book called K&acirc;<I>th</I>aka.--Where, on the other hand, there is no special reason for assuming the difference of vidy&acirc;s, their unity may be declared on the ground of identity of name; as, e.g. in the case of the Sa<I>m</I>vargavidy&acirc;s.</p>
