<p>4. Because speech is preceded by that (viz. fire and the other elements).</p>  
<p>Although in the chapter, 'That sent forth fire,' &amp;c., the origin of the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as is not mentioned, the origin of the three elements, fire, water, and earth only being stated, nevertheless, the fact of the text declaring that speech, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, and mind presuppose fire, water, and earth--which in their turn have Brahman for their causal substance--proves that they--and, by parity of reasoning, all pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as--have sprung from Brahman. That speech, pr&acirc;<I>n</I>a, and mind presuppose fire, water, and earth is told in the same chapter, 'For truly, my child, mind consists of earth, breath of water,</p>

<p>speech of fire' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VI, 5, 4). If their consisting of earth and so on is taken literally, it follows at once that they have sprung from Brahman. And if it be taken in a metaphorical sense only, yet, as the sentence forms part of the chapter which treats of the evolution of names and forms effected by Brahman; and as the introductory phrase runs, 'That by which we hear what is not heard' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VI, 1, 3); and as the concluding passage is 'In it all that exists has its Self' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. VI, 8, 7); and as the matter is moreover known from other scriptural passages; we understand that also the statement about mind and so on consisting of earth, &amp;c., is meant to teach that they are products of Brahman.--It is therefore an established conclusion that the pr&acirc;<I>n</I>as also are effects of Brahman.</p>
