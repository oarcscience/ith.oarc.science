44\. To the lord (of the sacrifice) only (the agent-ship in meditations
belongs), because scripture declares a fruit; this is the view of
Âtreya.

With regard to meditations on subordinate members of sacrificial actions
there arises a doubt whether they are to be carried out by the
sacrificer (i.e. him for whom the sacrifice is performed) or by the
officiating priests.--By the sacrificer, the pûrvapakshin maintains,
because scripture declares fruits. For a fruit is declared in such texts
as the following one, 'There is rain for him, and he brings rain for
others who thus knowing meditates on the fivefold Sâman as rain' (*Kh*.
Up. II, 3, 2); and we must conclude that that fruit goes to the Lord of
the sacrifice, because it is he who is entitled to the sacrificial
performance together with its subordinate members, and because such
meditations fall within the sphere of that to which he is entitled. And
that the fruit belongs to him who carries out the meditations scripture
states when saying, 'There is rain for him who meditates.'--But
scripture declares a fruit for the priest also, viz. in the passage,
'Whatever desire he may desire either for himself or for the sacrificer
he obtains by his singing.'--That passage, we reply, is of no force
because it expressly declares the fruit (as belonging to the priest in a
special case only). Hence the lord of the sacrifice only

is the agent in those meditations which have a fruit, this is the
opinion of the teacher Âtreya.
