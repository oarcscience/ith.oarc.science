13\. And it is minute.

And the chief vital air is to be considered as minute like the other
prâ*n*as.--Here also we have to understand by minuteness that the chief
vital air is subtle and of limited size, not that is of atomic size; for
by means of its five functions it pervades the entire body. It must be
viewed as subtle because when passing out of the body it is not
perceived by a bystander, and as limited because scripture speaks of its
passing out, going and coming.--But, it may be said, scripture speaks
also of its all-pervadingness; so,

e.g. 'He is equal to a grub, equal to a gnat, equal to an elephant,
equal to these three worlds, equal to this Universe' (B*ri*. Up. I, 3,
22).--To this we reply that the all-pervadingness of which this text
speaks belongs to the Self of the prâ*n*a in its adhidaivata relation,
according to which it appears as Hira*n*yagarbha in his
double--universal and individual--form, not in its adhyâtma relation.
Moreover the statements of equality 'equal to a grub,' &c., just declare
the limited size of the prâ*n*a which abides within every living
being.--Thus there remains no difficulty.
