24\. And in the state of perfect conciliation also (the Yogins apprehend
the highest Brahman), according to *S*ruti and Sm*ri*ti.

At the time of perfect conciliation the Yogins see the unevolved Self
free from all plurality. By 'perfect conciliation' we understand the
presentation before the mind (of the highest Self), which is effected
through meditation and devotion.--This is vouched for by *S*ruti as well
as

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sm*ri*ti. So, e.g.
Ka. Up. IV, 1, 'The Self-existent pierced the openings of the senses so
that they turn outward; therefore man looks without, not within himself.
Some wise man, however, with his eyes closed and wishing for
immortality, saw the Self within.' And Mu. Up. III, 1, 8, 'When a man's
mind has become purified by the serene light of knowledge then he sees
him, meditating on him as without parts.' Sm*ri*ti-passages of the same
tendency are the following ones, 'He who is seen as light by the Yogins
meditating on him sleepless, with suspended breath, with contented
minds, with subdued senses; reverence be to him <span

eternal one.'

But if in the state of perfect conciliation there is a being to be
conciliated and a being conciliating, does not this Involve the
distinction of a higher and a lower Self?--No, the next Sûtra replies.
