<p>17. (This scripture) also shows, and it is likewise stated in Sm<I>ri</I>ti.</p>  
<p>That Brahman is without any difference is proved by those scriptural passages also which expressly deny that it possesses any other characteristics; so, e.g. 'Next follows the teaching by No, no' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. II, 3, 6); 'It is different from the known, it is also above the unknown' (Ke. Up. I, 4); 'From whence all speech, with the mind, turns away unable to reach it' (Taitt. Up. II, 9). Of a similar purport is that scriptural passage which relates how B&acirc;hva, being questioned about Brahman by Vashkalin, explained it to him by silence, 'He said to him, "Learn Brahman, O friend," and became silent. Then, on a second and third question, he replied, "I am teaching you indeed, but you do not understand. Silent is that Self."' The same teaching is conveyed by those Sm<I>ri</I>ti-texts which deny of Brahman all other characteristics; so, e.g. 'I will proclaim that which is the object of knowledge, knowing which one reaches immortality; the highest Brahman without either beginning or end, which cannot be said either to be or not to be' (Bha. G&icirc;t&acirc; XIII, 12). Of a similar purport is another Sm<I>ri</I>ti-passage, according to which the omniform N&acirc;r&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a instructed N&acirc;rada, 'The cause, O N&acirc;rada, of your seeing me endowed with the qualities of all beings is the M&acirc;y&acirc; emitted by me; do not cognize me as being such (in reality).'</p>
