*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5\. In the case of (a devout meditation) common (to several *S*âkhâs)
(the particulars mentioned in each *S*âkhâ) have to be combined, since
there is no difference of essential matter; just as in the case of what
is complementary to injunctions.

\[This Sûtra states the practical outcome of the discussion carried on
in the first four Sûtras.\] It having been determined that the
cognitions of Brahman are equally intimated by all Vedânta-texts, it
follows that as long as the cognition is one and the same its specific
determinations mentioned in one text are to be introduced into other
texts also where they are not mentioned. For if the matter of these
determinations subserves some particular cognition in one place, it
subserves it in another place also, since in both places we have to do
with one and the same cognition. The case is analogous to that of the
things subordinate to some sacrificial performance, as, e g. the
agnihotra. The agnihotra also is one performance, and therefore its
subordinate members, although they may be mentioned in different texts,
have to be combined into one whole.--If the

cognitions were separate, the particulars mentioned in different texts
could not be combined; for they would be confined each to its own
cognition and would not stand to each other in that relation in which
the typical form of a sacrifice stands to its modifications <span
id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128). But as the cognitions are one, things
lie differently--The above Sûtra will be explained and applied at length
further on, in Sûtra 10 ff.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_128"></span>[192:1](sbe38148.htm#fr_128) The Pûrvâ
Mîmâ*m*sâ teaches that all subordinate things which the Veda prescribes
for some typical sacrifice are eo ipso prescribed for the modified forms
of the sacrifice also.
