11\. Where concentration of mind (is possible), there (meditation may be
carried on), on account of there being no difference.

A doubt here arises with regard to direction, place, and

time, viz. whether any restrictive rules exist or not.--Against the view
of those who maintain that such rules exist because we have analogous
rules concerning the locality, &c., of Vedic works, the Sûtrakâra
remarks that all rules concerning direction, place, and time depend on
the aim merely; that is to say: Let a man meditate at whatever time, in
whatever place and facing whatever region, he may with case manage to
concentrate his mind. For while scripture prescribes an easterly
direction, the time of forenoon, and a spot sloping towards the cast for
certain sacrifices, no such specific rules are recorded for meditation,
since the requisite concentration may be managed indifferently
anywhere.--But, an objection is raised, some passages record such
specific rules, as e.g. the following one, 'Let a man apply himself (to
meditation) in a level and clean place, free from pebbles, fire and
dust, noises, standing water, and the like, favourable to the mind, not
infested by what hurts the eyes, full of caves and shelters' (*S*vet.
Up. II, 10).--Such particular rules are met with indeed; but the teacher
being friendly-minded says that there is no binding rule as to
the--particulars mentioned therein. The clause 'favourable to the mind'
moreover shows that meditation may be carried on wherever concentration
of the mind may be attained.
