*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

5\. But by the meditation on the highest that which is hidden (viz. the
equality of the Lord and

the soul, becomes manifest); for from him (the Lord) are its (the
soul's) bondage and release.

Well, but the individual soul is a part of the highest Self as the spark
is a part of the fire. And as fire and spark have in common the powers
of burning and giving light, so the individual soul and the Lord have in
common the powers of knowledge and rulership; hence the individual soul
may, by means of its lordship, effect in the dreaming state a creation
of chariots and the like, springing from its wishes (sa*m*kalpa).--To
this we reply that although the Lord and the individual soul stand to
each other in the relation of whole and part, yet it is manifest to
perception that the attributes of the two are of a different nature.--Do
you then mean to say that the individual soul has no common attributes
with the Lord?--We do not maintain that; but we say that the equality of
attributes, although existing, is hidden by the veil of Nescience. In
the case of some persons indeed who strenuously meditate on the Lord and
who, their ignorance being dispelled at last, obtain through the favour
of the Lord extraordinary powers and insight, that hidden equality
becomes manifest--just as through the action of strong medicines the
power of sight of a blind man becomes manifest; but it does not on its
own account reveal itself to all men.--Why not?--Because 'from him,'
i.e. from the Lord there are bondage and release of it, viz. the
individual soul. That means: bondage is due to the absence of knowledge
of the Lord's true nature; release is due to the presence of such
knowledge. Thus *S*ruti declares, 'When that god is known all fetters
fall off; sufferings are destroyed and birth and death cease. From
meditating on him there arises, on the dissolution of the body, a third
state, that of universal Lordship; he who is alone is satisfied'
(*S*vet. Up. I, 11), and similar passages.
