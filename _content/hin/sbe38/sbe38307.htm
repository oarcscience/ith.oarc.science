For that that person leads them is stated in the following passage, 'When they have reached the place of lightning a person, not a man, leads them to the world of Brahman' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. VI, 2, 15). Varu<I>n</I>a and the rest, we must understand, favour them either by not hindering or somehow assisting them.--Therefore it is well said that light and so on are the gods who act as conductors.</p>
