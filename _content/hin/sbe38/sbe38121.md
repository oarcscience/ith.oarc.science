18\. For this very reason (there are applied to Brahman) comparisons
such as that of the images of the sun and the like.

Because that Self is of the nature of intelligence, devoid of all
difference, transcending speech and mind, to be

described only by denying of it all other characteristics, therefore the
Moksha *S*âstras compare it to the images of the sun reflected in the
water and the like, meaning thereby that all difference in Brahman is
unreal, only due to its limiting conditions. Compare, e.g. out of many,
the two following passages: 'As the one luminous sun when entering into
relation to many different waters is himself rendered multiform by his
limiting adjuncts; so also the one divine unborn Self;' and 'The one
Self of all beings separately abides in all the individual beings; hence
it appears one and many at the same time, just as the one moon is
multiplied by its reflections in the water.'

The next Sûtra raises an objection.
