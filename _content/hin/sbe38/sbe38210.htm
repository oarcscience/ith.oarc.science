<p align="center">REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!</p>  
<p>1. The purpose of man (is effected) thence (i.e. through the mere knowledge of Brahman), thus B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a opines.</p>  
<p>The S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra at present enters on an inquiry whether the knowledge of the Self which is derived from the Upanishads, is connected with works through him who is entitled to perform the works&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, or is an independent means to accomplish the purpose of man. He begins by stating the final view in the above S&ucirc;tra, 'Thence' &amp;c. The teacher B&acirc;dar&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a is of opinion that thence, i.e. through the independent knowledge of Brahman enjoined in the Ved&acirc;nta-texts, the purpose of man is effected.--Whence is this known?--'From scripture,' which exhibits passages such as the following: 'He who knows the Self overcomes grief' (<I>Kh</I>. Up. III, 4, 1); 'He who knows that highest Brahman becomes even Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9); 'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'For him who has a teacher there is delay only so long as he is not delivered; then he will be perfect'(<I>Kh</I>. Up. VI. 14, 2); 'He who has searched out and understands the Self which is free from sin, &amp;c. &amp;c., obtains all worlds and all desires'(<I>Kh</I>. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'The Self is to be seen' &amp;c. up to 'Thus far goes immortality' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. IV, 5, 6-15). These and similar texts declare that mere knowledge effects the purpose of man.--Against this the opponent raises his voice as follows.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_182"></A><A HREF="sbe38210.htm#fr_182">285:1</A> The p&ucirc;rvapakshin (see next S&ucirc;tra) maintains that the knowledge of the Self is subordinate to (sacrificial) action through the mediation of the agent, i.e. in so far as it imparts to the agent a certain qualification.</P>
