43\. But (they are to be kept outside) in either case, on account of
Sm*ri*ti and custom.

But whether lapses from the duties of one's order, committed by those
who are bound to chastity, be mortal sins or minor sins, in either case
such persons are to be excluded by honourable men (*s*ish*t*as). For
Sm*ri*ti refers to them in terms of the highest reproach; cp. passages
such as the one quoted under Sûtra 41; and the following one, 'He who
touches a Brâhma*n*a that has broken his vow and fallen from his order,
or a hanged man or one gnawed by worms must undergo the *K*ândrâya*n*a
penance.' And good custom also condemns them; for good men do not
sacrifice, study, or attend weddings with such persons.
