*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

4\. And on account of the word (of the Veda).

The word of the Veda also proclaims the non-originatedness of ether; for
it declares that 'air and ether (antariksha) are immortal' (B*ri*. Up.
II, 3, 3), and what is immortal cannot have an origin. Another
scriptural passage ('omnipresent and eternal like ether'), by comparing
two attributes of Brahman, viz. omnipresence and eternity with the
other, intimates that those qualities belong to the ether

also; in which case no beginning can be attributed to it. Other passages
to be quoted in this connexion are, 'As this ether is infinite, so the
Self is to be known as infinite;' and 'Brahman has the ether for its
body, the ether is the Self.' For if the ether had a beginning, it could
not be predicated of Brahman (as is done in the last passage), as we
predicate blueness of a lotus ('the lotus is blue'). Hence we understand
that the eternal Brahman is of the nature as ether.
