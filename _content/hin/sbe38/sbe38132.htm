<p>29. Or else (the relation of the two is to be conceived) in the manner stated above.</p>  
<p>Or else the relation of the two has to be conceived in the manner suggested by S&ucirc;tra 25. For if the bondage of the soul is due to Nescience only, final release is possible. But if the soul is really and truly bound--whether the soul be considered as a certain condition or state of the highest Self as suggested in S&ucirc;tra 27, or as a part of the highest Self as suggested in S&ucirc;tra 28--its real bondage cannot be done away with, and thus the scriptural doctrine of final release becomes absurd.--Nor, finally, can it be said that <I>S</I>ruti equally teaches difference and non-difference. For non-difference only is what it aims at establishing; while, when engaged in setting forth something else, it merely refers to difference as something known from other sources of knowledge (viz. perception, &amp;c.).--Hence the conclusion stands that the soul is not different from the highest Self, as explained in S&ucirc;tra 25.</p>
