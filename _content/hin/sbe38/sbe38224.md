*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

15\. Some also by proceeding according to their liking (evince their
disregard of anything but knowledge).

Moreover some who know, having obtained the intuition of the fruit of
knowledge, express, in reliance thereon, the purposelessness of the
means of all other results, viz. by proceeding according to their liking
(and abandoning those means). A scriptural text of the Vâ*g*asaneyins
runs as follows: 'Knowing this the people of old did not wish for
offspring. What shall we do with offspring, they said, we who have this
Self and this world' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 22). And that the fruit of
knowledge, being present to intuition, does not manifest itself at a
later time only as the fruits of actions do, we have explained more than
once. From this also it follows that knowledge is not subordinate to
action, and that the scriptural statements as to the fruit of knowledge
cannot be taken in any but their true sense.
