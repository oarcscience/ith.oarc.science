10\. The absence (of a body and sense-organs, on the part of the
released) Bâdari (asserts); for thus scripture says.

The passage, 'By his mere wish the fathers rise,' shows that the
released possesses a mind (internal organ, manas) whereby he wills. A
question however arises whether he

who knows, after having reached lordly power, possesses a body and
senses, or not. Here the teacher Bâdari is of opinion that the glorified
possessor of knowledge is without body and sense-organs.--Why
so?--Because scripture declares this, With the mind seeing those wishes
he rejoices' (*Kh*. Up. VIII, 12, 5). If he rejoiced with the mind, the
body, and the senses, scripture would not specially say 'with the mind.'
Hence there are neither body nor sense-organs in the state of release.
