*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

12\. It is designated as having five functions like mind.

The chief vital air has its specific effect for that reason also that in
scripture it is designated as having five functions, prâ*n*a, apâna,
vyâna, udâna, samâna. This distinction of functions is based on a
distinction of effects. Prâ*n*a is the forward-function whose work is
aspiration, &c.; apâna is the backward-function whose work is
inspiration, &c.; vyâna is that which, abiding in the junction of the
two,

is the cause of works of strength <span id="fr_59"></span>[1](#fn_59);
udâna is the ascending function and is the cause of the passing out (of
the soul); samâna is the function which conveys the juices of the food
equally through all the limbs of the body. Thus the prâ*n*a has five
functions just as the mind (manas) has. The five functions of the mind
are the five well-known ones caused by the ear, &c., and having sound
and so on for their objects. By the functions of the mind we cannot here
understand those enumerated (in B*ri*. Up. I, 5, 3), 'desire,
representation,' &c., because those are more than five. But on the
former explanation also there exists yet another function of the mind
which does not depend on the ear, &c., but has for its object the past,
the future, and so on; so that on that explanation also the number five
is exceeded.--Well, let us then follow the principle that the opinions
of other (systems) if unobjectionable may be adopted, and let us assume
that the five functions of the manas are those five which are known from
the Yoga*s*âstra, viz. right knowledge, error, imagination, slumber, and
remembrance. Or else let us assume that the Sûtra quotes the manas as an
analogous instance merely with reference to the plurality (not the
fivefoldness) of its functions.--In any case the Sûtra must be construed
to mean that the prâ*n*a's subordinate position with regard to the soul
follows from its having five functions like the manas.
