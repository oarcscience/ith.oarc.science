*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

16\. And (scripture) declares (Brahman) to consist of that (i.e.
intelligence).

And scripture declares that Brahman consists of intelligence, is devoid
of any other characteristics, and is altogether without difference; 'As
a mass of salt has neither inside nor outside, but is altogether a mass
of taste, thus, indeed, has that Self neither inside nor outside, but is
altogether

a mass of knowledge' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 5, 13). That means: That Self has
neither inside nor outside any characteristic form but intelligence;
simple non-differentiated intelligence constitutes its nature; just as a
lump of salt has inside as well as outside one and the same saltish
taste, not any other taste.
