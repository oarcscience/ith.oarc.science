28\. And because (on the above interpretation)

there is no contradiction to both (i.e. man's making an effort to free
himself from his deeds and actually freeing himself) according to his
liking.

Moreover if we assumed that the man frees himself from his good and evil
deeds on the way--after having departed from the body and having entered
on the path of the gods--we should implicate ourselves in
impossibilities; for after the body has been left behind, man can no
longer accomplish, according to his liking, that effort which consists
in self-restraint and pursuit of knowledge, and which is the cause of
the obliteration of all his good and evil deeds, and consequently that
obliteration also cannot take place. We therefore must assume that the
requisite effort is made--and its result takes place--at an earlier
moment, viz. in the state in which man is able to effect it, and that in
consequence thereof man rids himself of his good and evil deeds.

Nothing then stands in the way of the conditioning and the conditioned
events taking place, and the assumption moreover agrees with the
statements of the Tâ*nd*ins and Sâ*t*yâyanins.
