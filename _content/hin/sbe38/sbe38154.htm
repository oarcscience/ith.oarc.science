<p>11. Bliss and other (qualities) as belonging to the subject of the qualities (have to be attributed to Brahman everywhere).</p>  
<p>Those scriptural texts which aim at intimating the characteristics of Brahman separately ascribe to it various qualities, such as having bliss for its nature, being one mass of knowledge, being omnipresent, being the Self of all and so on. Now the doubt here presents itself whether in each place where Brahman is spoken of we have to understand only those qualities which actually are mentioned there, or whether we have to combine all qualities of Brahman mentioned anywhere.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_202"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 202</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains that only the attributes actually stated are to be understood as referred to in each particular scriptural text.--But this view the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra discards by declaring that delight and all the other qualities which belong to the subject, i.e. Brahman, are all of them to be understood in each place. The reason for this conclusion is the one given in S&ucirc;tra 10. In all the passages treating of Brahman the subject to which the qualities belong is one, non-different; hence, as explained at length under the preceding S&ucirc;tra, the qualities attributed to Brahman in any one place have to be combined wherever Brahman is spoken of.</p>  
<p>But in that case also such qualities as having joy for its head. &amp;c., would have to be ascribed to Brahman everywhere; for we read in the Taittir&icirc;yaka with reference to the Self consisting of Bliss, 'Joy is its head, satisfaction is its right arm, great satisfaction its left arm, bliss is its trunk, Brahman is its tail, its support' (II, 5).</p>  
<p>To this objection the next S&ucirc;tra replies.</p>
