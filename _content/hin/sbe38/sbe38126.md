*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

23\. That (Brahman) is unevolved; for (thus scripture) says.

If that highest Brahman which is different from the world that is
negatived in the passage discussed above really exists, why then is it
not apprehended?--Because, the Sûtrakâra replies, it is unevolved, not
to be apprehended by the senses; for it is the witness of whatever is
apprehended (i.e. the subject in all apprehension). Thus *S*ruti says,
'He is not apprehended by the eye, nor by speech, nor by the other
senses, not by penance or good works' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 8); 'That Self is
to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be
comprehended' (B*ri*. Up. III, 9, 26); 'That which cannot be seen nor
apprehended' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6); 'When in that which is invisible,
incorporeal, undefined, unsupported' &c. (Taitt. Up. II, 7). Similar
statements are made in Sm*ri*ti-passages; so e.g. 'He is called
unevolved, not to be fathomed by thought, unchangeable.'
