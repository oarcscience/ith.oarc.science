<p>36. But also (persons standing) between (are qualified for knowledge); for that is seen (in scripture).</p>  
<p>A doubt arises whether persons in want who do not possess means, &amp;c., and therefore are not able to enter one or the other of the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas., standing between as it were, are qualified for knowledge or not.--They are not qualified, the p&ucirc;rvapakshin maintains. For we have ascertained that the works incumbent on the &acirc;<I>s</I>ramas are the cause of knowledge, and those persons have no opportunity to perform those works.--To this the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra replies. 'But also between.' Even a person who because he does not belong to an &acirc;<I>s</I>rama stands between, as it were, is qualified for knowledge. 'For that is seen.' For we meet with scriptural passages declaring that persons of that class--such as Raikva and the daughter of Va<I>k</I>aknu--possessed the knowledge of Brahman (<I>Kh</I>. Up. IV, 1; B<I>ri</I>. Up. III, 6, 8).</p>
