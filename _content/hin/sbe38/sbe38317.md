16\. And scripture declares a difference (in the case of meditations on
symbols).

With reference to the meditations on symbols, such as name and so on,
scripture declares that each following meditation has a different result
from the preceding one, 'As far as name reaches he is lord and
master;--speech is greater than name;--as far as speech reaches he is
lord and master;--mind is greater than speech' (*Kh*. Up. VII, 1, ff.).

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Now this
distinction of rewards is possible because the meditations depend on
symbols, while there could be no such distinction if they depended on
the one non-different Brahman.--Hence those who take their stand on
symbols cannot have the same reward as others.
