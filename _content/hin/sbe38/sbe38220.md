*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

11\. There is distribution (of the work and knowledge) as in the case of
the hundred.

In reply to the averment (Sûtra 5) that the passage, 'Then both his
knowledge and his work take hold of him,' indicates the non-independence
of knowledge, we point out that the passage must be understood in a
distributed sense, knowledge taking hold of one man and work of another.
The case is analogous to that of the 'hundred.' When it is said, 'Let a
hundred be given to these two men,' the hundred are divided in that way
that fifty are given to one man and fifty to the other.--Moreover what
the text says about the laying hold does not refer to him who is about
to obtain final release; for the concluding passage, 'So much for the
man who desires,' indicates that the whole section refers to the soul
implicated in the sa*m*sâra, and a new beginning is made for him who is
about to be released, in the clause. 'But as to the man who does not

desire.' The clause about the laying hold thus comprises all knowledge
which falls within the sphere of the transmigrating soul whether it be
enjoined or prohibited <span id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_189), since
there is no reason for distinction, and to all action whether enjoined
or prohibited, the clause embodying a reference to knowledge and work as
established elsewhere. And on this interpretation there is room for the
clause even without our having recourse to the distribution of knowledge
and work.

The next Sûtra replies to the averment made in Sûtra 6.
