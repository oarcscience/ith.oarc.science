12\. If it be objected that it is not so, on account of the difference
(taught by the Veda); we reply that it is not so on account of the
declaration of (Brahman)

being not such, with reference to each (declaration of difference).

Let this be, but nevertheless it cannot be maintained that Brahman is
devoid of difference and attributes, and does not possess double
attributes either in itself or on account of difference of station.--Why
not?--'On account of difference.' The various vidyâs teach different
forms of Brahman; it is said to have four feet (*Kh*. Up. III, 18, 1);
to consist of sixteen parts (Pr. Up. VI, 1); to be characterised by
dwarfishness (Ka. Up. V, 3); to have the three worlds for its body
(B*ri*. Up. I, 3, 22); to be named Vai*s*vânara (*Kh*. Up. V, 11, 2),
&c. Hence we must admit that Brahman is qualified by differences
also.--But above it has been shown that Brahman cannot possess twofold
characteristics!--That also does not contradict our doctrine; for the
difference of Brahman's forms is due to its limiting adjuncts. Otherwise
all those scriptural passages which refer to those differences would be
objectless.

All this reasoning, we say, is without force 'on account of the
declaration of its being not such, with reference to each,' i.e. because
scripture declares, with reference to all the differences produced by
the limiting adjuncts, that there is no difference in Brahman. Cp. such
passages as the following: 'This bright immortal person in this earth,
and that bright immortal person incorporated in the body; he indeed is
the same as that Self (B*ri*. Up. II, 5, 1). It, therefore, cannot be
maintained that the connexion of Brahman with various forms is taught by
the Veda.

<span id="fn_112"></span>[153:1](sbe38114.htm#fr_112) The limiting
adjunct of the crystal, i.e. the red colour of a thing, e.g. a flower
with which the crystal is in contact, is as real as the crystal itself;
only the effect is an illusion.--But the limiting adjuncts of Brahman
are in themselves illusion.
