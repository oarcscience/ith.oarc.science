<p>If that highest Brahman which is different from the world that is negatived in the passage discussed above really exists, why then is it not apprehended?--Because, the S&ucirc;trak&acirc;ra replies, it is unevolved, not to be apprehended by the senses; for it is the witness of whatever is apprehended (i.e. the subject in all apprehension). Thus <I>S</I>ruti says, 'He is not apprehended by the eye, nor by speech, nor by the other senses, not by penance or good works' (Mu. Up. III, 1, 8); 'That Self is to be described by No, no! He is incomprehensible, for he cannot be comprehended' (B<I>ri</I>. Up. III, 9, 26); 'That which cannot be seen nor apprehended' (Mu. Up. I, 1, 6); 'When in that which is invisible, incorporeal, undefined, unsupported' &amp;c. (Taitt. Up. II, 7). Similar statements are made in Sm<I>ri</I>ti-passages; so e.g. 'He is called unevolved, not to be fathomed by thought, unchangeable.'</p>
