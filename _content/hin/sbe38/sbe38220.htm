<p>11. There is distribution (of the work and knowledge) as in the case of the hundred.</p>  
<p>In reply to the averment (S&ucirc;tra 5) that the passage, 'Then both his knowledge and his work take hold of him,' indicates the non-independence of knowledge, we point out that the passage must be understood in a distributed sense, knowledge taking hold of one man and work of another. The case is analogous to that of the 'hundred.' When it is said, 'Let a hundred be given to these two men,' the hundred are divided in that way that fifty are given to one man and fifty to the other.--Moreover what the text says about the laying hold does not refer to him who is about to obtain final release; for the concluding passage, 'So much for the man who desires,' indicates that the whole section refers to the soul implicated in the sa<I>m</I>s&acirc;ra, and a new beginning is made for him who is about to be released, in the clause. 'But as to the man who does not</p>

<p>desire.' The clause about the laying hold thus comprises all knowledge which falls within the sphere of the transmigrating soul whether it be enjoined or prohibited&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_189"></A><A HREF="#fn_189"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, since there is no reason for distinction, and to all action whether enjoined or prohibited, the clause embodying a reference to knowledge and work as established elsewhere. And on this interpretation there is room for the clause even without our having recourse to the distribution of knowledge and work.</p>  
<p>The next S&ucirc;tra replies to the averment made in S&ucirc;tra 6.</p>
