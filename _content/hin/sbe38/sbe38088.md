12\. Of those also who do not perform sacrifices (the ascent to the
moon) is stated by scripture.

It has been said that those who perform sacrifices, &c., go to the moon.
The question now arises whether those also who do not perform sacrifices
go to the moon or not.--The pûrvapakshin maintains that it cannot be
asserted that men belonging to the former class only go to the moon,

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

because scripture speaks of the moon as being resorted to by those also
who have not performed sacrifices. For the Kâushîtakins make the
following general statement, 'All who depart from this world go to the
moon' (Kau. Up. I, 2). Moreover, the origination of a new body in the
case of those who are born again is not possible without their having
(previously) reached the moon, on account of the precise definition of
number contained in the statement, 'In the fifth oblation' (*Kh*. Up. V,
9, 1) <span id="fr_97"></span>[1](#fn_97). Hence all men must be
supposed to resort to the moon. If it be objected that it does not
appear proper that those who perform sacrifices and those who do not
should go to the same place, we reply that there is no real objection,
because those who do not perform sacrifices do not enjoy anything in the
moon.

presupposes four other oblations, the first of which is the one from
which 'Soma the king rises.'
