19\. And on account of the difference of characteristics.

There is moreover a difference of characteristics between the chief
prâ*n*a and the other prâ*n*as. When speech &c. are asleep, the chief
prâ*n*a alone is awake. The chief prâ*n*a alone is not reached by death,
while the other prâ*n*as are. The staying and departing of the chief
prâ*n*a--not that of the sense-organs--is the cause of the maintenance
and the destruction of the body. The sense-organs, on the other hand,
are the cause of the perception of the sense-objects, not the chief
prâ*n*a. Thus there are manifold differences distinguishing the prâ*n*a
from the senses, and this also shows the latter to be different in being
from the prâ*n*a--To infer from the passage, 'thereupon they all assumed
his form,' that the sense-organs are nothing but prâ*n*a is wrong,
because there also an examination of the context makes us understand
their difference. For there the sense-organs are enumerated first
('Voice held, I shall speak,' &c.); after that it is said that speech,
&c. were seized by death in the form of weariness ('Death having become
weariness held them back; therefore speech grows weary'); finally
prâ*n*a is mentioned separately as not having been overcome by death
('but death did not seize the central breath'), and is

asserted to be the best ('he is the best of us'). The assuming of the
form of prâ*n*a has therefore, in accordance with the quoted passages,
to be understood to mean that the energizing of speech and so on depends
on the prâ*n*a, but not that they are identical with it.--Hence it
follows that the word 'prâ*n*a is applied to the sense-organs in a
secondary sense. Thus *S*ruti also says, 'Thereupon they all assumed his
form, and therefore they are called after him prâ*n*as;' a passage
declaring that the word prâ*n*a, which properly refers to the chief
prâ*n*a is secondarily applied to the sense-organs also. Speech and the
other sense-organs are therefore different in being from the prâ*n*a.
