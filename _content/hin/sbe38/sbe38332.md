*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.

16\. (What scripture says about absence of all specific cognition)
refers either to deep sleep or union (release); for this is manifested
(by the texts).

By 'entering into one's own Self' is meant dreamless

sleep; according to the text, 'He is gone to his own Self, he sleeps
they say' (*Kh*. Up. VI, 8, 1). 'Union' means blissful isolation (final
release), according to the text, 'Being Brahman he goes to Brahman'
(B*ri*. Up. IV, 4, 6). What the texts say about absence of specific
cognition is said with reference to either of those two states,
dreamless sleep or final release.--How do we know this?--Because this is
'manifest,' owing to the fact that those two states form the topic there
(where absence of all cognition is mentioned). Compare the passages,
'Having risen from out of these elements it perishes again after them.
Having departed there is no more knowledge;' 'But where the Self only is
all this;' 'Where when asleep he desires no more desires, and dreams no
more dreams' (B*ri*. Up. II, 4, 12; IV, 5, 15; IV, 3, 19).--Those
passages, on the other hand, which describe lordly power refer to an
altogether different condition, which--like the heavenly world and so
on--is an abode where qualified knowledge produces its results.--Thus
there is no contradiction.
