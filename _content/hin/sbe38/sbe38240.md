31\. And hence also a scriptural passage as to non-proceeding according
to liking.

There is also a scriptural passage prohibiting unlawful food, the
purpose of which it is to stop procedure therein according to one's
liking, viz. in the Sa*m*hitâ of the Ka*th*as, 'Therefore a Brâhma*n*a
is not to drink spirits.' This text also is more appropriate if we take
the passage, 'To him who knows this,' as an arthavâda.--Hence passages
of that kind are arthavâdas, not injunctions.
