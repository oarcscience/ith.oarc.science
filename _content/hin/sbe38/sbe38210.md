### FOURTH PÂDA.

REVERENCE TO THE HIGHEST SELF!

1\. The purpose of man (is effected) thence (i.e. through the mere
knowledge of Brahman), thus Bâdarâya*n*a opines.

The Sûtrakâra at present enters on an inquiry whether the knowledge of
the Self which is derived from the Upanishads, is connected with works
through him who is entitled to perform the works <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182), or is an independent means to
accomplish the purpose of man. He begins by stating the final view in
the above Sûtra, 'Thence' &c. The teacher Bâdarâya*n*a is of opinion
that thence, i.e. through the independent knowledge of Brahman enjoined
in the Vedânta-texts, the purpose of man is effected.--Whence is this
known?--'From scripture,' which exhibits passages such as the following:
'He who knows the Self overcomes grief' (*Kh*. Up. III, 4, 1); 'He who
knows that highest Brahman becomes even Brahman' (Mu. Up. III, 2, 9);
'He who knows Brahman attains the Highest' (Taitt. Up. II, 1); 'For him
who has a teacher there is delay only so long as he is not delivered;
then he will be perfect'(*Kh*. Up. VI. 14, 2); 'He who has searched out
and understands the Self which is free from sin, &c. &c., obtains all
worlds and all desires'(*Kh*. Up. VIII, 7, 1); 'The Self is to be seen'
&c. up to 'Thus far goes immortality' (B*ri*. Up. IV, 5, 6-15). These
and similar texts declare that mere knowledge effects the purpose of
man.--Against this the opponent raises his voice as follows.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_182"></span>[285:1](sbe38210.htm#fr_182) The pûrvapakshin
(see next Sûtra) maintains that the knowledge of the Self is subordinate
to (sacrificial) action through the mediation of the agent, i.e. in so
far as it imparts to the agent a certain qualification.
