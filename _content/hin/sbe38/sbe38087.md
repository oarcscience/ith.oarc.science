*The Vedanta Sutras of Badarayana, Commentary by Sankara (SBE38)*, tr.
by George Thibaut \[1896\] at Intangible Textual Heritage

11\. But (*k*ara*n*a means) nothing but good and evil works; thus Bâdari
opines.

The teacher Bâdari, however, thinks that the word '*k*ara*n*a' denotes
nothing else but good works and evil works. It means the same as
anush*th*âna (performance) or karman (work). For we see that the root
*k*ar (to walk, to conduct oneself) is used in the general sense of
acting. Of a man who performs holy works such as sacrifices, &c., people
say in ordinary language, 'that excellent man walks in righteousness.'
The word â*k*âra also denotes only a kind of religious duty. That works
and *k*ara*n*a (conduct) are sometimes spoken of as different things is
analogous to the distinction sometimes made between Brâhma*n*as and
Parivrâ*g*akas <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96). We, therefore,
decide that by men of good *k*ara*n*a are meant those whose works are
worthy of praise, by men of evil *k*ara*n*a those whose works are worthy
of blame.
