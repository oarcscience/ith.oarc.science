# RÂMAK*RI*SH*N*A

## HIS LIFE AND SAYINGS

###### BY

### F. MAX MÜLLER

#### \[1898\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ramakrishna (1833-86), was a Bengali Hindu sage. Although theoretically
a high-caste Brahamin by birth, he came from a poor, low-caste village
and had little or no education. He did not know a word of Sanskrit and
his knowledge of the Vedas, Puranas, and Hindu Epics was obtained orally
(in the Bengali language). In spite of this, he managed to convey in his
aphorisms the essence of the Hindu religion. Ramakrishna also worshipped
with Muslims and Christians, and propounded a simple approach to
religious tolerance: "Creeds and sects matter nothing. Let every one
perform with faith the devotions and practices of his creed. Faith is
the only clue to get to God." (\#200).

His often earthy sayings and short fables are immediately comprehensible
to everyone, using vivid metaphors which employ everyday objects and
settings to express deep Hindu philosophical concepts. This collection
of sayings was collected by his followers after his death and translated
by Max Müller.

PRODUCTION NOTES: this book uses the same transcription system as the
[Sacred Books of the East](../../sbe/index). Also, I have broken up the
sayings, which comprise one huge chapter in the source book, into four
separate files.
