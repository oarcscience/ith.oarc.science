### Footnotes

<span id="fn_16"></span>[189:1](rls29.htm#fr_16) This Index was made for
a collection of the Sayings of Ramakrishna which was sent to me in
manuscript. When the MS. came to be printed there were several sayings
which had been given twice. As these had to be left out when they
occurred the second time, it was necessary to assign two numbers to some
of the sayings in order not to disturb the figures of the Index.
