### HYMN LXXXVIII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008801">1</span></span>Him who with
might hath propped earth's ends, who sitteth in  
   threefold seat, Brihaspati, with thunder,  
  Him of the pleasant tongue have ancient sages, deep thinking,.  
   holy singers, set before them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008802">2</span></span>Wild in
their course, in well-marked wise rejoicing were they,.  
  Brihaspati, who pressed around us  
  Preserve, Brihaspati, the stall uninjured,r,this company's raining.  
   ever-moving birth-place.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008803">3</span></span>Brihaspati,
from thy remotest distance have they sat down who  
   love the law eternal.  
  For thee were dug wells springing from the mountain, which  
   murmuring round about pour streams of sweetness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008804">4</span></span>Brihaspati,
when first he had his being from mighty splendour in  
   supremest heaven.  
  Strong, with his sevenfold mouth, with noise of thunder, with  
   his seven rays blew and dispersed the darkness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008805">5</span></span>With the
loud-shouting band who sang his praises, with thunder,  
   he destroyed malignant Vala.  
  Brihaspati thundering drave forth the cattle, the lowing cows  
   who make oblations ready.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2008806">6</span></span>Serve we
with sacrifices, gifts, and homage even thus the Steer  
   of all the Gods, the Father.  
  Brihaspati, may we be lords of riches, with noble progeny and,  
   store of heroes.
