### HYMN XXIX

#### A benediction on a sick man

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202901">1</span></span>Gods, give
him all that earth hath best with bodily strength and  
   happy fate.  
  Agni and Sūrya grant him life, Brihaspati give him eminence!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202902">2</span></span>Bestow thou
life on him, O Jātavedas. Store him with future  
   progeny, O Tvashtar.  
  Send him, O Savitar, full growth of riches. Let this thy servant  
   live a hundred autumns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202903">3</span></span>May this our
prayer bring strength and goodly offspring. Give,  
   both of you one-minded, strength and riches. <span id="page_a56">p.
a56</span>  
  Let him with might win fields and victory, Indra! setting beneath  
   his feet the rest, his rivals.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202904">4</span></span>As Indra's
gift, by Varuna instructed the fierce one came to us  
   sent by the Maruts.  
  Let him, O Heaven and Earth, rest in your bosom. Let him not  
   hunger, let him not be thirsty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202905">5</span></span>Ye twain
endowed with vigour, grant him vigour. Ye who are  
   rich in milk, give milk to feed him.  
  These twain have given him vigour, Earth and Heaven, and all  
   the Gods, the Maruts, and the Waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202906">6</span></span>With
health-bestowing drops thine heart I comfort: all-bright  
   again, and undiseased, enjoy them.  
  Drest in like robes let these two drink the mixture, wearing  
   the Asvins' form as an illusion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0202907">7</span></span>Erst Indra,
wounded, made this strengthening portion, eternal  
   food: thine is it, here presented.  
  With this live full of vigour through the autumns. Let not thy  
   strength be drained. Leeches have helped thee.
