# BOOK VII

### HYMN I

#### Glorification of the power of prayer and to Agni

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700101">1</span></span>They who by
thought have guided all that Speech hath best, or  
   they who with their heart have uttered words of truth,  
  Made stronger by the strength which the third prayer bestows,  
   have by the fourth prayer learned the nature of the Cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0700102">2</span></span>Well knows
this son his sire, he knows his mother well: he hath  
   been son, and he hath been illiberal.  
  He hath encompassed heaven, and air's mid-realm, and sky; he  
   hath become this All; he hath come nigh to us.
