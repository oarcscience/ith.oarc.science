### HYMN XIX

#### A counter-charm and charm to secure general protection.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401901">1</span></span>Thou
breakest ties of kith and kin, thou causest, too, relation-  
   ship:  
  So bruise the sorcerer's offspring, like a reed that groweth in the  
  Rains.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401902">2</span></span>Thou hast
been blessed with blessing by the Brāhman, Kanva  
  Nārshada.  
  Thou fliest like a flashing dart: there is no fear or danger, Plant!  
   within the limit of thy range.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401903">3</span></span>Illumining,
as 'twere, with light, thou movest at the head of  
   plants.  
  The saviour of the simple man art thou, and slayer of the fiends.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401904">4</span></span>As once when
time began the Gods with thee expelled the  
  Asuras,  
  Even thence, O Plant, wast thou produced as one who wipes and  
   sweeps away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401905">5</span></span>Thy father's
name was Cleaver. Thou with thousand branches  
   cleavest all.  
  Do thou, turned backward, cleave and rend the man who treateth  
   us as foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401906">6</span></span>The evil
sprang from earth; it mounts to heaven and spreads to  
   vast extent.  
  Reverted, shaking him with might, thence on its maker let it  
   fall.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401907">7</span></span>For thou
hast grown reverted, and turned backward also is thy  
   fruit.  
  Remove all curses far from me, keep most remote the stroke of  
   death. <span id="page_a128">p. a128</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401908">8</span></span>Preserve me
with a hundred, yea, protect me with a thousand  
   aids.  
  May mighty Indra, Lord of Plants! give store of strength and.  
   power to thee.
