### HYMN IX

#### The Sataudanā or Hundredfold Oblation

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000901">1</span></span>Binding the
mouths of those who threaten mischief, against my  
   rivals cast this bolt of thunder,  
  Indra first gave the Hundredfold Oblation, welfare of him who  
   worships, foe-destroying.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000902">2</span></span>Thy skin
shall be the Altar; let thine hair become the Sacred  
  Grass.  
  This cord hath held thee firmly: let this pressing-stone dance  
   round on thee:  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000903">3</span></span>The holy
water be thy hair: let thy tongue make thee clean, O

   and of the earth,  
  Whoever pays the Hundredfold. Oblation with its golden light.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000907">7</span></span>Thine
Immolators, Goddess! and the men who dress thee for  
   the feast, all these will guard thee, Hundredfold Oblation!  
  Have no fear of them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000908">8</span></span>The Vasus
from the South will be thy guards, the Maruts from  
   the North,  
  Ādityas from the West; o'ertake and pass the Agnishtoma,  
   thou!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000909">9</span></span>The Gods,
the Fathers, mortal men, Gandharvas, and Apsara-  
   ses,  
  All these will be the guards: o'ertake and pass the Atirātra,

and omentum, let thy belly's hollows, and thy skin,  
   etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000918">18</span></span>Let all thy
marrow, every bone, let all thy flesh, and all thy  
   blood, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000919">19</span></span>Let both
thy shoulders and thy hump, thy forelegs, and their  
   lower parts, etc.

and nape and shoulder-joints, thy ribs and inter-costal  
   parts, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000921">21</span></span>So let thy
thighs and thy knee-bones, thy hinder quarters, and  
   thy hips, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000922">22</span></span>So let thy
tail and all the hairs thereof, thine udder, and thy  
   teats, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000923">23</span></span>Let all thy
legs, the refuse of thy feet, thy heelropes, and thy  
   hooves.  
  Pour for the giver mingled curd, and flowing butter milk, and  
   mead.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000924">24</span></span>Let all thy
skin, Sataudanā! let every hair thou hast, O Cow,  
  Pour for the giver mingled curd, and flowing butter, milk, and  
   mead.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000925">25</span></span>Sprinkled
with molten butter, let the two meal-cakes be sport  
   for thee.  
  Make them thy wings, O Goddess, and bear him who dresses  
   thee to heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000926">26</span></span>Each grain
of rice in mortar or on pestle, all on the skin or in  
   the winnowing-basket,  
  Whatever purifying Mātarisvan, the Wind, hath sifted, let the  
  Hotar Agni make of it an acceptable oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000927">27</span></span>In the
priest's hands I lay, in separate order, the sweet celestial  
  Waters, dropping fatness.  
  As here I sprinkle them may all my wishes be granted unto me  
   in perfect fulness. May we have ample wealth in our posses-  
   sion.
