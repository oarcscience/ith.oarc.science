### HYMN L

#### A gambler's prayer for success in gaming

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705001">1</span></span>As evermore
the lightning flash strikes, irresistible, the tree,  
  So, irresistible, may I conquer the gamblers with the dice. <span
id="page_a290">p. a290</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705002">2</span></span>From every
side, from hale and sick, impotent to defend them-  
   selves,  
  May all the fortune of the folk as winnings pass into my hands.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705003">3</span></span>I pray to
Agni, him who guards his treasure: here, won by  
   homage, may he pile our winnings.  
  As 'twere with racing cars I bring my presents: duly with  
   reverence, let me laud the Maruts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705004">4</span></span>With thee to
aid us may we win the treasure: do thou assist  
   our side in every battle.  
  Give us wide room and easy way, O Indra; break down, O  
  Maghavan, the foemen's valour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705005">5</span></span>I have
completely cleaned thee out, won from thee what thou  
   keptest back.  
  As a wolf tears and rends a sheep, so do I tear thy stake away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705006">6</span></span>Yea, by
superior play one gains advantage: in time he piles his  
   spoil as doth a gambler.  
  He overwhelms with wealth's inherent powers the devotee who  
   keeps not back his riches.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705007">7</span></span>May we all,
much-invoked! repel with cattle want that brings  
   sin, hunger with store of barley.  
  May we uninjured, first among the princes, obtain possessions  
   by our own exertions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705008">8</span></span>My right
hand holds my winnings fast, and in my left is  
   victory.  
  I would that I were winner of cattle and horses, wealth and  
   gold.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705009">9</span></span>Dice, give
me play that bringeth fruit as 'twere a cow with  
   flowing milk!  
  And, as the bowstring binds, the bow, unite me with a stream of  
   gains.
