### HYMN XXI

#### A hymn to the War-drum and various deities for victory

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502101">1</span></span>Speak to our
enemies, O Drum, discouragement and wild  
   dismay.  
  We bring upon our foemen fear and discord and discomfiture.  
  Drum! drive these enemies away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502102">2</span></span>When
sacrificial butter hath been offered, let our foemen flee.  
  Through consternation, terrified, trembling in mind and eye and  
   heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502103">3</span></span>Wrought out
of wood, compact with straps of leather, dear to  
   all the clan, <span id="page_a182">p. a182</span>  
  Bedewed with sacrificial oil, speak terror to our enemies.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502104">4</span></span>As the wild
creatures of the wood flee in their terror from a  
   man,  
  Even so do thou, O Drum, roar out against our foes to frighten  
   them, and then bewilder thou their thoughts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502105">5</span></span>As, when the
wolf approaches, goats and sheep run sorely  
   terrified,  
  Even so do thou, O Drum, roar out against our foes to frighten  
   them, and then bewilder thou their thoughts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502106">6</span></span>As birds of
air, day after day, fly in wild terror from the hawk,  
   as from a roaring lion's voice,  
  Even so do thou, O Drum, roar out against our foes to frighten  
   them, and then bewilder thou their thoughts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502107">7</span></span>May all the
deities whose might controls the fortune of the fray  
  Frighten away our enemies with Drum and skin of antelope.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502108">8</span></span>Let those
our enemies who go yonder in their battalions shake.  
  In fear at shadows and the sounds of feet which Indra sporteth  
   with.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502109">9</span></span>To all the
quarters of the sky let clang of bowstrings and our  
  Drums.  
  Cry out to hosts of foes that go discomfited in serried ranks.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502110">10</span></span>Āditya,
take their sight away! Follow them close, ye motes of  
   light.  
  Let them cleave fast to foot-bound hosts when strength of arm  
   hath past away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502111">11</span></span>Do ye, O
mighty Maruts, sons of Prisni, crush down, with  
  Indra for ally, our foemen.  
  King Soma. Varuna, great God and sovran, Indra too, aye,  
  Death,—  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0502112">12</span></span>May these
embattled Gods, brilliant as Sūrya—All hail!—one-  
   minded conquer those who hate us.
