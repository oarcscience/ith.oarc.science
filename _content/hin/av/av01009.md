### HYMN IX

#### Benediction on a King at his inauguration

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100901">1</span></span>May Indra,
Pūshan, Varuria, Mitra, Agni, benignant Gods,  
   maintain this man in riches.  
  May the Ādityas and the Vive Devas set and support him in  
   supremest lustre. <span id="page_a10">p. a10</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100902">2</span></span>May light, O
Gods, be under his dominion, Agni, the Sun, all;  
   that is bright and golden.  
  Prostrate beneath our feet his foes and rivals. Uplift him to the.  
   loftiest cope of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100903">3</span></span>Through that
most mighty prayer, O Jātavedas, wherewith thou.  
   broughtest milk to strengthen Indra,  
  Even therewith exalt this man, O Agni, and give him highest rank  
   among his kinsmen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100904">4</span></span>I have
assumed their sacrifice, O Agni, their hopes, their glory,.  
   and their riches' fulness.  
  Prostrate beneath our feet his foes and rivals. Uplift him to the-  
   loftiest cope of heaven.
