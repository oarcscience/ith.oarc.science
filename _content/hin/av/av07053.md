### HYMN LIII

#### A charm to recover a sick man at the point of death

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705301">1</span></span>As thou,
Brihaspati, from the curse hast saved us, from dwel-  
   ling yonder in the realm of Yama,  
  The Asvins, leeches of the Gods, O Agni, have chased Death  
   far from us with mighty powers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705302">2</span></span>Move both
together; do not leave the body. Let both the  
   breathings stay for thee united.  
  Waxing in strength live thou a hundred autumns. Thy noblest  
   guardian and thy lord is Agni. <span id="page_a292">p. a292</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705303">3</span></span>Return, thy
life now vanished into distance! Return, the breath  
   thou drawest and exhalest!  
  Agni hath snatched it from Destruction's bosom: into thyself  
   again I introduce it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705304">4</span></span>Let not the
vital breath he draws forsake him, let not his  
   expiration part and leave him.  
  I give him over to the Seven Rishis: let them conduct him to  
   old age in safety.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705305">5</span></span>Enter him,
both ye breaths, like two draught-oxen entering their  
   stall.  
  Let him, the treasure of old age, still wax in strength, uninjured,.  
   here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705306">6</span></span>I send thee
back thy vital breath; I drive Consumption far from  
   thee,  
  May Agni here, most excellent, sustain our life on every side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0705307">7</span></span>From out the
depth of darkness, we, ascending to the highest  
   heaven,  
  Have come to the sublimest light, to Sūrya, God among the.  
  Gods.
