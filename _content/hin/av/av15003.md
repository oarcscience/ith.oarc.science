### HYMN III

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500301">1</span></span>For a whole
year he stood erect. The Gods said unto him, Why  
   standest thou, O Vrātya? He answered and said, Let them  
   bring my couch.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500303">3</span></span>They brought
the couch for that Vrātya.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500304">4</span></span>Two of its
feet were Summer and Spring, and two were Autumn  
   and the Rains.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500305">5</span></span>Brihat and
Rathantara were the two long boards, Yajnāyajniya  
   and Vāmadevya the two cross-boards.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500306">6</span></span>Holy verses
were the strings lengthwise, and Yajus formulas the  
   cross-tapes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500307">7</span></span>Sacred lore
was the blanket, Devotion the coverlet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500308">8</span></span>The Sāman
was the Cushion, and chanting the bolster.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500309">9</span></span>The Vrātya
ascended that couch.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500310">10</span></span>The hosts
of Gods were his attendants, solemn vows his  
   messengers, and all creatures his worshippers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1500311">11</span></span>All
creatures become the worshippers of him who possesses this  
   knowledge.
