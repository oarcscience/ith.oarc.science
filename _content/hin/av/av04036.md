### HYMN XXXVI

#### A charm against fiends, human enemies, and other pests

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403601">1</span></span>Endowed with
true strength, let the Bull, Agni Vaisvānara, burn  
   them up.  
  Him who would pain and injure us, him who would treat us as  
   a foe. <span id="page_a146">p. a146</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403602">2</span></span>Him who,
unharmed, would injure us, and him who, harmed,  
   would do us harm,  
  I lay between the doubled fangs of Agni, of Vaisvānara.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403603">3</span></span>Those who,
what time the moon is dark, hunt with loud cry and  
   answering shout,  
  Flesh-eaters, others who would harm,—all these I overcome with  
   might.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403604">4</span></span>I conquer
the Pisāchas with my power, and take their wealth  
   away.  
  All who would injure us I slay. Let mine intention have success.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403605">5</span></span>With Gods
who flee with him, and match their rapid motion  
   with the Sun,  
  I with those animals who dwell in rivers and on hills am found.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403606">6</span></span>I trouble
the Pisāchas as the tiger plagues men rich in kine.  
  They, even as dogs when they have seen a lion, find no hiding-  
   place.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403607">7</span></span>Naught with
Pisāchas can I do, with thieves, with roamers of the  
   wood.  
  Pisāchas flee and vanish from each village as I enter it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403608">8</span></span>Into
whatever village this mine awful power penetrates,  
  Thence the Pisāchas flee away, and plot no further mischief  
   there.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403609">9</span></span>Those who
enrage me with their prate, as flies torment an  
   elephant,  
  I deem unhappy creatures, like small insects troublesome to  
   man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403610">10</span></span>Destruction
seize upon the man, as with a cord they hold a  
   horse,  
  The fool who is enraged with me! He is not rescued from the  
   noose.
