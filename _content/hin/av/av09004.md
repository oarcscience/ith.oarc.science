### HYMN IV

#### A glorification of the typical sacrificial bull

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900401">1</span></span>The Bull,
fierce, thousandfold, filled full of vigour, bearing  
   within his flanks all forms and natures,  
  Brihaspati's Steer, hath stretched the thread, bestowing bliss on  
   the worshipper, the liberal giver.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900402">2</span></span>He who at
first became the Waters' model, a match for everyone,  
   like Earth the Goddess;  
  The husband of the cows, the young calves' father, may be  
   secure us thousandfold abundance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900403">3</span></span>Masculine,
prégnant, stedfast. full of vigour, the Bull sustains a  
   trunk of goodly treasure.  
  May Agni Jātavedas bear him offered, on pathways traversed by  
   the Gods, to Indra. <span id="page_a366">p. a366</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900404">4</span></span>The husband
of the cows, the young calves' father, father is he  
   of mighty water-eddies.  
  Calf, after-birth, new milk drawn hot, and biestings, curds, butter,  
   that is his best genial humour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900405">5</span></span>He is the
Gods' allotted share and bundle, essence of waters,  
   and of plants, and butter.  
  Sakra elected him, the draught of Soma. What was his body  
   was a lofty mountain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900400">0</span></span>6. A beaker
filled with Soma juice thou bearest. framer of forms,  
   begetter of the cattle.  
  Kindly to us be these thy wombs here present, and stay for us,  
  O Axe, those that are yonder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900407">7</span></span>He bears
oblation, and his seed is butter. Thousand-fold plenty;  
   sacrifice they call him.  
  May he, the Bull, wearing the shape of Indra, come unto us, O  
  Gods, bestowed, with blessing.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900408">8</span></span>Both arms of
Varuna, and Indra's vigour, the Maruts' hump is  
   he, the Asvins' shoulders.  
  They who are sages, bards endowed with wisdom, call him  
  Brihaspati compact and heightened.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900409">9</span></span>Thou,
vigorous, reachest to the tribes of heaven. Thee they call  
  Indra, thee they call Sarasvān.  
  Turned to one aim, that Brāhman gives a thousand who offers  
   up the Bull as his oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900410">10</span></span>Brihaspati,
Savitar gave thee vital vigour: thy breath was  
   brought from Tvashtar and from Vāyu.  
  In thought I offer thee in air's mid-region. Thy sacrificial grass  
   be Earth and Heaven!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900411">11</span></span>Let the
priest joyfully extol the limbs and members of the Bull  
  Who moved and roared among the kine as Indra moves among  
   the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900412">12</span></span>The sides
must be Anumati's, and both rib-pieces Bhaga's share,  
  Of the knee-bones hath Mitra said, Both these are mine, and  
   only mine.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900413">13</span></span>The Ādityas
claim the hinder parts, the loins must be Brihas-  
   pati's.  
  Vāta, the God, receives the tail: he stirs the plants and herbs  
   therewith,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900414">14</span></span>To Sūryā
they assigned the skin, to Sinivāli inward parts. <span
id="page_a367">p. a367</span>  
  The Slaughterer hath the feet, they said, when they distributed  
   the Bull.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900415">15</span></span>They made a
jest of kindred's curse: a jar of Soma juice was set,  
  What time the deities, convened, assigned the Bull's divided  
   parts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900416">16</span></span>They gave
the hooves to tortoises, to Saramā scraps of the feet:  
  His undigested food they gave to worms and things that creep  
   and crawl.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900417">17</span></span>That Bull,
the husband of the kine, pierces the demons with his  
   horns,  
  Banishes famine with his eye, and hears good tidings with his  
   ears.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900418">18</span></span>With
hundred sacrifices he worships: the fires consume him not:  
  All Gods promote the Braman who offers the Bull in sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900419">19</span></span>He who hath
given away the Bull to Brāhmans frees and cheers  
   his soul.  
  In his own cattle-pen he sees the growth and increase of his  
   cows.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900420">20</span></span>Let there
be cattle, let there be bodily strength and progeny:  
  All this may the Gods kindly grant to him who gives away the  
  Bull.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900421">21</span></span>Indra here
verily hath rejoiced: let him bestow conspicuous  
   wealth.  
  May he draw forth at will from yonder side of heaven a deft  
   cow, good to milk, whose calf is never wanting.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900422">22</span></span>With close
connexion mingle with the cows in this our cattle-  
   pen:  
  Mingle, the Bull's prolific flow, and, Indra! thine heroic  
   strength!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900423">23</span></span>Here we
restore this Bull, your youthful leader: sporting with  
   him, go, wander at your pleasure.  
  Ne'er, wealthy ones! may he be reft of offspring; and do ye  
   favour us with growth of riches.
