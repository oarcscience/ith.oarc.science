### HYMN XXXV

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003501">1</span></span>To him, to
him swift, strong, and high-exalted, I bring my song  
   of praise as dainty viands;  
  My thought to him resistless, meet for praises, prayers offered  
   most devotedly to Indra. <span id="page_293">p. 293</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003502">2</span></span>To him I
offer praise as choice refreshment, bring forth my song,  
   with seemly laud besiege him.  
  For Indra, Lord of olden time, the singers shall deck their hymns  
   with heart and mind and spirit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003503">3</span></span>To him then
with my lips my song of praises, excellent, winning  
   heavenly light, I offer,  
  To magnify with hymns of invocation and eulogies the Lord,  
   most bounteous Giver.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003504">4</span></span>Even for him
I frame a laud—so fashions the wright a chariot  
   for the man who needs it  
  Songs for wise Indra hymned with invocation, a song composed  
   with care and all-impelling.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003505">5</span></span>So with my
tongue I deck, to please that Indra, my hymn as't-  
   were a horse, through love of glory,  
  To reverence the Hero, bounteous Giver, famed far and wide,  
   destroyer of the castles.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003506">6</span></span>Even for him
hath Tvashtar forged the thunder, most deftly  
   wrought, celestial, for the battle.  
  Wherewith he reached the vital parts of Vritra, striking—the  
   vast, the mighty—with the striker,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003507">7</span></span>As soon as,
at libations of his mother, great Vishnu had drunk  
   up the draught, he plundered.  
  The dainty cates, the cooked mess; but One stronger transfixed  
   the wild boar, shooting through the mountain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003508">8</span></span>To him, to
Indra when he slew the Dragon, the Dames too,  
  Consorts of the Gods, wove praises.  
  The mighty heaven and earth hath he encompassed: thy great-  
   ness heaven and earth, combined, exceed not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003509">9</span></span>Yea, of a
truth, his magnitude surpasseth the magnitude of  
   earth, mid-air and heaven.  
  Indra whom all men praise, the Sovran Ruler, waxed in his  
   home loud-voiced and strong for battle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003510">10</span></span>Through his
own strength with bolt of thunder Indra smote  
   piece-meal Vritra, drier up of waters.  
  He let the floods go free, like cows imprisoned, for glory, with  
   a heart inclined to bounty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003511">11</span></span>Through his
resplendent power still stood the rivers when with  
   his bolt on every side he stayed them. <span id="page_294">p.
294</span>  
  With lordly might favouring him who worshipped, he made a  
   ford, victorious, for Turviti.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003512">12</span></span>Vast, with
thine ample power, with eager movement against this  
  Vritra cast thy bolt of thunder.  
  Rend thou his joints, as of an ox dissevered, with bolt oblique  
   that floods of rain may follow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003513">13</span></span>Sing with
new lauds his exploits wrought aforetime, the deeds  
   of him, yea, him who moveth swiftly,  
  When, hurling forth his weapons in the battle, he with impetuous  
   wrath lays low the foemen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003514">14</span></span>When he,
yea, he is born the firm-set mountains and the whole  
   heaven and earth tremble in terror.  
  May Nodhas ever lauding the protection of this dear Friend win  
   straightway strength heroic.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003515">15</span></span>Now unto
him of these things hath been given what he, who  
   rules alone o'er much, electeth.  
  Indra helped Etasa, the Soma presser, contending in the chariot-  
   race with Sūrya.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003516">16</span></span>Thus to
thee, Indra, yoker of bay coursers, the Gotamas have  
   brought their prayers and praises.  
  Bestow upon them thought, decked with all beauty. May he,  
   enriched with prayer, come soon and early.
