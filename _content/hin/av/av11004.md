### HYMN IV

#### A glorification of Prāna, Breath or Vital Spirit

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100401">1</span></span>Homage to
Prāna, him who hath dominion o'er the universe,  
  Who hath become the Sovran Lord of all, on whom the whole  
   depends!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100402">2</span></span>Homage, O
Prāna, to thy roar, to thunder-peal and lightning  
   flash!  
  Homage, O Prāna, unto thee what time thou sendest down thy  
   rain!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100403">3</span></span>When Prāna
with a thunderous voice shouts his loud message  
   to the plants,  
  They straightway are impregnate, they conceive, and bear  
   abundantly. <span id="page_53">p. 53</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100404">4</span></span>When the due
season hath arrived and Prāna shouteth to herbs,  
  Then all is joyful, yea, each thing upon the surface of the earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100405">5</span></span>When Prāna
hath poured down his flood of rain upon the  
   mighty land.  
  Cattle and beasts rejoice thereat: Now great will he our  
   strength, they cry.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100406">6</span></span>Watered by
Prāna's rain the plants have raised their voices in  
   accord:  
  Thou hast prolonged our life, they say, and given fragrance to us  
   all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100407">7</span></span>Homage to
thee when coming nigh, homage to thee departing  
   hence!  
  Homage, O Prāna, be to thee when standing and when sitting  
   still.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100408">8</span></span>Homage to
thee at every breath thou drawest in and sendest  
   forth!  
  Homage to thee when turned away, homage to thee seen face to  
   face! This reverence be to all of thee!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100409">9</span></span>Prāna,
communicate to us thy dear, thy very dearest form.  
  Whatever healing balm thou hast, give us thereof that we may  
   live.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100410">10</span></span>Prāna robes
living creatures as a father his beloved son. Prāna  
   is sovran Lord of all, of all that breathes not, all that  
   breathes  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100411">11</span></span>Prāna is
Fever, he is Death. Prāna is worshipped by the Gods.  
  Prāna sets in the loftiest sphere the man who speaks the words  
   of truth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100412">12</span></span>Prāna is
Deshtri, and Virāj Prāna is reverenced by all. He is the  
  Sun, he is the Moon. Prāna is called Prajāpati.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100413">13</span></span>Both
breaths are rice and barley, and Prāna is called the toiling  
   ox:  
  In barley is the inbreath laid, and rice is named the outward  
   breath.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100414">14</span></span>The human
infant in the womb draws vital breath and sends it  
  Lout:  
  When thou, O Prāna, quickenest the babe it springs anew to  
   life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100415">15</span></span>The name of
Prāna is bestowed on Mātarisvan and on Wind.  
  On Prāna, past and future, yea, on Prāna everything depends. <span
id="page_54">p. 54</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100416">16</span></span>All herbs
and plants spring forth and grow when thou, O Prāna  
   quickenest,  
  Plants of Atharvan, Angiras, plants of the deities and men.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100417">17</span></span>When Prāna
hath poured down his flood of rain upon the  
   mighty earth,  
  The plants are wakened into life, and every herd that grows on  
   ground.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100418">18</span></span>The man who
knows this truth of thee, O Prāna, and what bears  
   thee up  
  To him will all present their gift of tribute in that loftiest will  
   all present their gift of tribute in that loftiest world.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100419">19</span></span>As all
these living creatures are thy tributaries, Prāna, so  
  Shall they bring tribute unto him who hears thee with attentive  
   ears.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100420">20</span></span>Filled with
a babe, mid deities he wanders: grown; near at hand,  
   he springs again to being.  
  That Father, grown the present and the future, hath past into  
   the son with mighty powers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100421">21</span></span>Hansa, what
time he rises up, leaves in the flood one foot un-  
   moved.  
  If he withdrew it there would be no more tomorrow or to-day,  
  Never would there be night, no more would daylight shine or  
   morning flush.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100422">22</span></span>It rolleth
on, eight-wheeled and single-fellied, and with a thousand  
   eyes, forward and backward.  
  With one half it engendered all creation. What sign is there to  
   tell us of the other?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100423">23</span></span>Homage, O
Prāna unto thee armed with swift bow among the  
   rest,  
  In whose dominion is this All of varied sort that stirs and  
   works!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100424">24</span></span>May he who
rules this Universe of varied sort, that stirs and  
   works,  
  Prāna, alert and resolute, assist me through the prayer I pray.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100425">25</span></span>Erect among
the sleepers he wakes, and is never laid at length,  
  No one hath ever heard that he hath been asleep while others  
   slept.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100426">26</span></span>Thou,
Prāna, never shalt be hid, never shalt be estranged from  
   me.  
  I bind thee on myself for life, O Prāna, like the Waters' germ.
