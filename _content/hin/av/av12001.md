### HYMN I

#### A hymn of prayer and praise to Prithivī or deified Earth

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200101">1</span></span>Truth, high
and potent Law, the Consecrating Rite, Fervour,  
  Brahma, and Sacrifice uphold the Earth.  
  May she, the Queen of all that is and is to be, may Prithivī  
   make ample space and room for us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200102">2</span></span>Not over
awded by the crowd of Manu's sons, she who hath  
   many heights and floods and level plains;  
  She who bears plants endowed with many varied powers, may  
  Prithivī for us spread wide and favour us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200103">3</span></span>In whom the
sea, and Sindhu, and the waters, in whom our food  
   and corn-lands had their being,  
  In whom this all that breathes and moves is active, this Earth.  
   assign us foremost rank and station!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200104">4</span></span>She who is
Lady of the earth's four regions, in whom our food  
   and corn-lands had their being,  
  Nurse in each place of breathing, moving creatures, this Earth.  
   vouchsafe us kine with milk that fails not!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200105">5</span></span>On whom the
men of old before us battled, on whom the Gods  
   attacked the hostile demons,  
  The varied home of bird, and kine and horses, this Prithivī  
   vouchsafe us luck and splendour!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200106">6</span></span>Firm
standing-place, all-bearing, store of treasures, gold-breasted,  
   harbourer of all that moveth.  
  May Earth who bears Agni Vaisvānara, Consort of mighty  
   Indra, give us great possessions  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200107">7</span></span>May Earth,
may Prithivī, always protected with ceaseless care by  
   Gods who never slumber,  
  May she pour out for us delicious nectar, may she bedew us  
   with a flood of splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200108">8</span></span>She who at
first was water in the ocean, whom with their wond-  
   rous powers the sages followed,  
  May she whose heart is in the highest heaven, compassed about  
   wit h truth, and everlasting, <span id="page_76">p. 76</span>  
  May she, this Earth, bestow upon us lustre, and grant us power  
   in loftiest dominion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200109">9</span></span>On whom the
running universal waters flow day and night with  
   never-ceasing motion,  
  May she with many streams pour milk to feed us, may she  
   bedew us with a flood of splendour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200110">10</span></span>She whom
the Asvins measured out, o'er whom the foot of  
  Vishnu strode,  
  Whom Indra, Lord of Power and Might, freed from all foemen  
   for himself,  
  May Earth pour out her milk for us, a mother unto me her son.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200111">11</span></span>O Prithivī,
auspicious be thy woodlands, auspicious be thy hills  
   and snow-clad mountains.  
  Unslain, unwounded, unsubdued, I have set foot upon the  
  Earth,  
  On earth brown, black, ruddy and every-coloured, on the firm  
   earth that Indra guards from danger.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200112">12</span></span>O Prithivī,
thy centre and thy navel, all forces that have issued  
   from thy body  
  Set us amid those forces; breathe upon us. I am the son of  
  Earth, Earth is my Mother. Parjanya is my Sire; may he  
   promote me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200143">43</span></span>Earth on
whose surface they enclose the altar, and all-performers  
   spin the thread of worship;  
  In whom the stakes of sacrifice, resplendent, are fixed and raised  
   on high before the oblation, may she, this Earth, prospering,  
   make us prosper.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200114">14</span></span>The man who
hates us, Earth! who fights against us, who  
   threaten us with thought or deadly weapon, make him our  
   thrall as thou hast done aforetime.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200115">15</span></span>Produced
from thee, on thee move mortal creatures: thou  
   bearest them, both quadruped and biped.  
  Thine, Prithivī, are these Five human Races, for whom, though  
   mortal, Sūrya as he rises spreads with his rays the light that is  
   immortal.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200116">16</span></span>In concert
may these creatures yield us blessings. With honey of  
   discourse, O Earth, endow me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200117">17</span></span>Kind, ever
gracious be the Earth we tread on, the firm Earth,  
  Prithivī, borne up by Order, mother of plants and herbs, the  
   all-producer. <span id="page_77">p. 77</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200118">18</span></span>A vast
abode hast thou become, the Mighty. Great stress is on  
   thee, press and agitation, but with unceasing care great Indra  
   guards thee.  
  So make us shine, O Earth, us with the splendour of gold. Let  
   no man look on us with hatred.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200119">19</span></span>Agni is in
the earth, in plants; the waters hold Agni in them,  
   in the stones is Agni.  
  Agni abideth deep in men: Agnis abide in cows and steeds.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200120">20</span></span>Agni gives
shine and heat in heaven: the spacious air is his, the  
  God's  
  Lover of fatness, bearer of oblation, men enkindle him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200121">21</span></span>Dark-kneed,
invested with a fiery mantle, Prithivī sharpen me  
   and give me splendour!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200122">22</span></span>On earth
they offer sacrifice and dressed oblation to the Gods.  
  Men, mortals, live upon the earth by food in their accustomed  
   way.  
  May that Earth grant us breath and vital power. Prithivī give  
   me life of long duration!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200123">23</span></span>Scent that
hath risen from thee, O Earth, the fragrance which.  
   growing herbs and plants and waters carry,  
  Shared by Apsarases, shared by Gandharvas therewith make  
   thou me sweet: let no man hate me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200124">24</span></span>Thy scent
which entered and possessed the lotus, the scent  
   which they prepared at Sūryā's bridal,  
  Scent which Immortals Earth! of old collected, therewith make  
   thou me sweet: let no man hate me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200125">25</span></span>Thy scent
in women and in men, the luck and light that is in.  
   males,  
  That is in heroes and in steeds in sylvan beasts and elephants,  
  The splendid energy of maids, therewith do thou unite us,.  
  Earth! Let no man look on us with hate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200126">26</span></span>Rock earth,
and stone, and dust, this Earth is held together,.  
   firmly bound.  
  To this gold-breasted Prithivī mine adoration have I paid.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200127">27</span></span>Hither we
call the firmly held, the all-supporting Prithivī,  
  On whom the trees, lords of the wood, stand evermore immov-  
   able.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200128">28</span></span>Sitting at
ease or rising up, standing or going on our way.  
  With our right foot and with our left we will not reel upon the  
   earth. <span id="page_78">p. 78</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200129">29</span></span>I speak to
Prithivī the purifier, to patient Earth who groweth  
   strong through Brahma.  
  O Earth, may we recline on thee who bearest strength, increase,  
   portioned share of food, and fatness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200130">30</span></span>Purified
for our bodies flow the waters: we bring distress on  
   him who would attack us.  
  I cleanse myself, O Earth, with that which cleanseth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200131">31</span></span>Earth, be
thine eastern and thy northern regions, those lying  
   southward and those lying westward.  
  Propitious unto me in all my movements. Long as I tread the  
   ground let me not stumble.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200132">32</span></span>Drive us
not from the west or east, drive us not from the north  
   or south,  
  Be gracious unto us, O Earth: let not the robbers find us; keep  
   the deadly weapon far away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200133">33</span></span>Long as, on
thee, I look around, possessing Sūrya as a friend,  
  So long, through each succeeding year, let not my power of  
   vision fail.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200134">34</span></span>When, as I
lie, O Earth, I turn upon my right side and my left,  
  When stretched at all our length we lay our ribs on thee who  
   meetest us.  
  Do us no injury there, O Earth who furnishest a bed for all.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200135">35</span></span>Let what I
dig from thee, O Earth, rapidly spring and grow  
   again.  
  O Purifier, let me not pierce through thy vitals or thy heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200136">36</span></span>Earth, may
thy summer, and thy rains, and autumn, thy winter,  
   and thy dewy frosts, and spring-time.  
  May thy years, Prithivī! and ordered seasons, and day and  
   night pour out for us abundance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200137">37</span></span>The
purifier, shrinking from the Serpent, she who held fires that  
   lie within the waters,  
  Who gives as prey the God-blaspheming Dasyus, Earth choosing  
  Indra for her Lord, not Vritra, hath clung to Sakra, to the  
  Strong and Mighty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200138">38</span></span>Base of the
seat and sheds, on whom the sacrificial stake is  
   reared,  
  On whom the Yajus-knowing priests recite their hymns and  
   chant their psalms,  
  And ministers are busied that Indra may drink the Soma juice; <span
id="page_79">p. 79</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200139">39</span></span>On whom the
ancient Rishis, they who made the world, sang  
   forth the cows,  
  Seven worshippers, by session, with their fervent zeal and  
   sacrifice;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200140">40</span></span>May she,
the Earth, assign to us the opulence for which we  
   yearn,  
  May Bhaga share and aid the task and Indra come to lead the  
   way.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200141">41</span></span>May she,
the Earth, whereon men sing and dance with varied  
   shout and noise,  
  Whereon men meet in battle, and the war-cry and the drum  
   resound,  
  May she drive off our foemen, may Prithivī rid me of my foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200142">42</span></span>On whom is
food, barley and rice, to whom these Races Five  
   belong,  
  Homage to her, P arjanya's wife, to her whose marrow is the  
   rain!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200143">43</span></span>Whose
castles are the work of Gods, and men wage war upon  
   her plain  
  The Lord of Life make Prithivī, who beareth all things in her  
   womb, pleasant to us on every side!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200144">44</span></span>May Earth
the Goddess, she who bears her treasure stored up  
   in many a place, gold, gems, and riches,  
  Giver of opulence, grant great possessions to us bestowing them  
   with love and favour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200145">45</span></span>Earth,
bearing folk of many a varied language with divers rites  
   as suits their dwelling-places,  
  Pour, like a constant cow that never faileth, a thousand streams  
   of treasure to enrich me!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200146">46</span></span>Thy snake,
thy sharply stinging scorpion, lying concealed, be-  
   wildered, chilled with cold of winter,  
  The worm, O Prithivī, each thing that in the Rains revives and  
   stirs,  
  Creeping, forbear to creep on us! With all things gracious bless  
   thou us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200147">47</span></span>Thy many
ways on which the people travel, the road for car and  
   wain to journey over,  
  Thereon meet both the good and bad, that pathway may we  
   attain without a foe or robber. With all things gracious bless  
   thou us. <span id="page_80">p. 80</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200148">48</span></span>Supporting
both the foolish and the weighty she bears the death  
   both of the good and evil.  
  In friendly concord with the boar, Earth opens herself for the  
   wild swine that roams the forest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200149">49</span></span>All sylvan
beasts of thine that love the woodlands, man-eaters,.  
   forest-haunting, lions, tigers,  
  Hyena, wolf, Misfortune, evil spirit, drive from us, chase the  
   demons to a distance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200150">50</span></span>Gandharvas
and Apsarases, Kimīdins, and malignant sprites,  
  Pisāchas all, and Rākshasas, these keep thou, Earth! afar from  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200151">51</span></span>To whom the
winged bipeds fly together, birds of each various  
   kind, the swans, the eagles;  
  On whom the Wind comes rushing, Mātarisvan, rousing the  
   dust and causing trees to tremble, and flame pursues the blast.  
   hither and thither;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200152">52</span></span>Earth, upon
whom are settled, joined together, the night and  
   day, the dusky and the ruddy, Prithivī compassed by the rain  
   about her,  
  Happily may she stablish us in each delightful dwelling place.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200153">53</span></span>Heaven,
Earth, the realm of Middle Air have granted me this  
   ample room,  
  Agni, Sun, Waters, all the Gods have joined to give me mental  
   power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200154">54</span></span>I am
victorious, I am called the lord superior on earth,  
  Triumphant, all-o'erpowering the conqueror on every side  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200155">55</span></span>There, when
the Gods, O Goddess, named thee, spreading thy  
   wide expanse as thou wast broadening eastward,  
  Then into thee passed many a charm and glory: thou madest  
   for thyself the world's four regions.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200156">56</span></span>In hamlets
and in woodland, and in all assemblages on earth,  
  In gatherings, meeting of the folk, we will speak glorious things  
   of thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200157">57</span></span>As the
horse scattereth the dust, the people who dwelt upon  
   the land, at birth, she scattered,  
  Leader and head of all the world, delightful, the trees' protectress  
   and the plants' upholder.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200158">58</span></span>Whate'er I
say I speak with honey-sweetness, whatever I behold  
   for that they love me.  
  Dazzling, impetuous am I: others who fiercely stir I slay. <span
id="page_81">p. 81</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200159">59</span></span>Mild,
gracious, sweetly odorous, milky, with nectar in her breast,  
  May Earth, may Prithivī bestow her benison, with milk, on me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200160">60</span></span>Whom
Visvakarman with oblation followed, when she was set  
   in mid-air's billowy ocean  
  A useful vessel, hid, when, for enjoyment, she was made mani-  
   fest to those with mothers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200161">61</span></span>Thou art
the vessel that containeth people, Aditi, granter of the  
   wish, far-spreading.  
  Prajāpati, the first-born Son of Order, supplieth thee with what-  
   soe'er thou lackest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200162">62</span></span>Let thy
breasts, frec from sickness and Consumption, be.  
  Prithivī, produced for our advantage.  
  Through long-extended life wakeful and watching still may we  
   be thy tributary servants.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1200163">63</span></span>O Earth, my
Mother, set thou me happily in a place secure.  
  Of one accord with Heaven, O Sage, set me in glory and in  
   wealth.
