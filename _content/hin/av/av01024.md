### HYMN XXIV

#### A charm against leprosy

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0102401">1</span></span>First,
before all, the strong-winged Bird was born;; thou wast  
   the gall thereof.  
  Conquered in fight, the Asuri took then the shape and form of  
   plants.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0102402">2</span></span>The Asuri
made, first of all, this medicine for leprosy, this  
   banisher of leprosy.  
  She banished leprosy, and gave one general colour to the skin.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0102403">3</span></span>One-coloured, is thy mother's name,
One-coloured is thy father  
   called:  
  One-colour-maker, Plant! art thou: give thou one colour to this  
   man. <span id="page_a23">p. a23</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0102404">4</span></span>Sāmā who
gives one general hue was formed and fashioned from  
   the earth:  
  Further this work efficiently. Restore the colours that were his.
