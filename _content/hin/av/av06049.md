### HYMN XLIX

#### In praise of Agni

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0604901">1</span></span>O Agni, in
thy body man hath never found a wounded part.  
  The Ape devours the arrow's shaft as a cow eats her after-  
   birth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0604902">2</span></span>Thou like a
fleece contractest and expandest thee what time the  
   upper stone and that below devour.  
  Closely compressing head with head and breast with breast he  
   crunches up the tendrils with his yellow jaws.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0604903">3</span></span>The Eagles
have sent forth their voice aloud to heaven: in the  
   sky's vault the dark impetuous ones have danced.  
  When they come downward to repair the lower stone, they,  
   dwellers with the Sun, have gained abundant seed.
