### HYMN XXXII

#### A charm against worms or bots in cows

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203201">1</span></span>Uprising let
the Sun destroy, and when he sinketh, with his  
   beams.  
  The Worms that live within the cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203202">2</span></span>The
four-eyed worm, of every shape, the variegated, and the  
   white  
  I break and crush the creature's ribs, and tear away its head  
   besides.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203203">3</span></span>Like Atri I
destroy you, Worms! in Kanva's, Jamadagni's way:  
  I bray and bruise the creeping things to pieces with Agastya's•  
   spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203204">4</span></span>Slain is the
sovran of these Worms, yea, their controlling lord  
   is slain:  
  Slain is the Worm, his mother slain, brother and sister both are  
   slain.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203205">5</span></span>Slain are
his ministers, and slain his followers and retinue:  
  Yes, those that seemed the tiniest things, the Worms have all  
   been put to death.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203206">6</span></span>I break in
pieces both thy horns wherewith thou pushest here  
   and there:  
  I cleave and rend the bag which holds the venom which is•  
   stored in thee.
