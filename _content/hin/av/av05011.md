### HYMN XI

#### A dialogue between Atharvan and Varuna

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501101">1</span></span>How,
terrible in might, hast thou here spoken to the great God,  
   how to the gold-hued Father!  
  Thy mind watched, greedy Varuna! to recover the brindled cow  
   thou hadst bestowed as guerdon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501102">2</span></span>Not through
desire do I revoke my present: I bring this brind-  
   led cow to contemplate her.  
  Now by what lore, by what inherent nature, knowest thou all  
   things that exist, Atharvan?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501103">3</span></span>Truly I am
profound in wisdom, truly I know by nature all  
   existing creatures.  
  No Dāsa by his greatness, not an Arya, may violate the law that  
  I will stablish.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501104">4</span></span>None,
self-dependent Varuna! existeth wiser than thou or sager  
   by his wisdom.  
  Thou knowest well all these created beings: even the man of  
   wondrous powers fears thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501105">5</span></span>O
self-dependent Varuna, wise director, thou knowest verily all  
   generations.  
  What is, unerring one! beyond this region? What more remote  
   than that which is most distant?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501106">6</span></span>One thing
there is beyond this air, and something beyond that  
   one, most hard to reach, remotest.  
  I, Varuna, who know, to thee declare it. Let churls be mighty <span
id="page_a167">p. a167</span>  
   in the lower regions. Let Dāsas sink into the earth beneath  
   them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501107">7</span></span>Many
reproaches, Varuna, dost thou utter against the misers.  
   who revoke their presents.  
  Be not thou added to that crowd of niggards: let not men call  
   thee an illiberal giver.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501108">8</span></span>Let not men
call me an illiberal giver. I give thee back the  
   brindled cow, O singer.  
  Attend in every place where men inhabit, with all thy powers,  
   the hymn that tells my praises.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501109">9</span></span>Let hymns of
praise ascend to thee, uplifted in every place of  
   human habitation.  
  But give me now the gift thou hast not given. Thou art my  
   friend for ever firm and faithful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501110">10</span></span>One origin,
Varuna! one bond unites us I know the nature of  
   that common kinship.  
  I give thee now the gift that I retracted. I am thy friend for ever  
   firm and faithful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501111">11</span></span>God, giving
life unto the god who lauds me, Sage strengthener  
   of the sage who sings my praises.  
  Thou, self-dependent Varuna! hast begotten the kinsman of the  
  Gods, our sire Atharvan.  
  On him bestow most highly-lauded riches. Thou art our friend,  
   high over all, our kinsman.
