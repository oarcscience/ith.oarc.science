### HYMN VII

#### A charm to make a poisonous plant innocuous

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400701">1</span></span>So may this
water guard us on the bank of Varanāvati.  
  Therein hath Amrit been infused: with that I ward thy poison  
   off.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400702">2</span></span>Weak is the
poison of the East, weak is the poison of the North,  
  So too this poison of the South counts as a cake of curds and  
   meal.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400703">3</span></span>When he hath
made of thee a cake, broad, steaming, swelling up  
   with fat,  
  And even in hunger eaten thee, then gripe him not, thou hideous  
   one!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400704">4</span></span>Intoxicater!
like a shaft we make thy spirit fly away, Like a pot  
   boiling on the fire, we with our word remove thee hence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400705">5</span></span>We set
around thee with the spell as 'twere a gathered arma-  
   ment.  
  Stay quiet like a rooted tree. Dug up with mattocks, gripe not  
   thou.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400706">6</span></span>For
coverings men have bartered thee, for skins of deer and  
   woven cloths.  
  Thou art a thing of sale, O Plant. Dug up with mattocks, gripe  
   not thou!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400707">7</span></span>None have
attained to those of old, those who wrought holy acts  
   for you.  
  Let them not harm our heroes here. Therefore I set before you  
   this.
