### HYMN VI

#### A charm to avert evil dreams, and to transfer them to an enemy

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600601">1</span></span>Now have we
conquered and obtained: we have been freed  
   from sin to-day.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600602">2</span></span>Let Morning
with her light dispel that evil dream that frightened  
   us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600603">3</span></span>Bear that
away to him who hates, away to him who curses us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600604">4</span></span>To him whom
we abhor, to him who hates us do we send it hence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600605">5</span></span>May the
Goddess Dawn in accord with Speech, and the Goddess  
  Speech in accord with Dawn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600606">6</span></span>The Lord of
Dawn in accord with the Lord of Speech and the  
  Lord of Speech in accord with the Lord of Dawn,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600607">7</span></span>Carry away
to Such-an-one niggard fiends, hostile demons, and  
  Sadanvas,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600608">8</span></span>Kumbhikas,
Dushikas, and Piyakas,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600609">9</span></span>Evil
day-dream, evil dream in sleep,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600610">10</span></span>Wishes for
boons that will not come, thoughts of poverty, the  
   snares of the Druh who never releases.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600611">11</span></span>This, O
Agni, let the Gods bear off to Such-an-one that he may  
   be a fragile good-for-nothing eunuch.
