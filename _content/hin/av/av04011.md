### HYMN XI

#### A glorification of the sacrificial gharma or milk caldron

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401101">1</span></span>The Bull
supports the wide-spread earth and heaven, the Bull  
   supports the spacious air between them.  
  The Bull supports the sky's six spacious regions: the universal  
   world hath he pervaded.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401102">2</span></span>The Bull is
Indra o'er the beasts he watches. He, Sakra  
   measures out three several pathways.  
  He, milking out the worlds, the past, the future, discharges all  
   the Gods' eternal duties.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401103">3</span></span>Being
produced among mankind as Indra, the Caldron works  
   heated and brightly glowing.  
  Let him not, with good sons, pass off in vapour who hath not  
   eaten of the Ox with knowledge.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401104">4</span></span>The Ox pours
milk out in the world of virtue: in earliest time,  
   he, Pavam5na, swells it.  
  Parjanya is the stream, Maruts his udder, sacrifice is the milk,  
   the meed his milking.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401105">5</span></span>That which
not sacrifice nor sacrificer, not giver nor receiver  
   rules and governs,  
  All-winning, all-supporting, all-effecting,—which of all quadru-  
   peds, tell us! is the Caldron?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401106">6</span></span>May we,
fame-seekers, reach the world of virtue by service of  
   the Gharma and through fervour,  
  Whereby the Gods went up to heaven, the centre of life eternal,  
   having left the body.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401107">7</span></span>Prajāpati,
supreme and sovran ruler, Indra by form and by his  
   shoulder Agni,  
  Came to Visvānara, came to all men's Bullock: he firmly forti-  
   fied and held securely. <span id="page_a117">p. a117</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401108">8</span></span>The middle
of the Bullock's neck, there where the shoulder-bar  
   is placed,  
  Extends as far to east of him as that is settled to the west.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401109">9</span></span>He whosoever
knows the seven exhaustless pourings of the Ox,  
  Wins himself offspring and the world: the great Seven Rishis  
   know this well.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401110">10</span></span>With feet
subduing weariness, with legs extracting freshening  
   draughts,  
  Through toil the plougher and the Ox approach the honeyed  
   beverage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401111">11</span></span>Assigned
are these twelve nights, they say, as holy to Prajāpati:  
  Whoever knows their proper prayer performs the service of the  
  Ox.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0401112">12</span></span>At evening
he is milked, is milked at early morn, is milked at  
   noon.  
  We know that streams of milk that flow from him are in-  
   exhaustible.
