   spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900802">2</span></span>From both
thine ears, from parts thereof, thine earache, and the  
   throbbing pain,  
  All malady that wrings thy brow we charm away with this our  
   spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900803">3</span></span>So that
Consumption may depart forth from thine ears and from.  
   thy mouth,  
  All malady that wrings thy brow we charm away with this our  
   spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900804">4</span></span>The malady
that makes one deaf, the malady that makes one  
   blind,  
  All malady that wrings thy brow we charm away with this our  
   spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900805">5</span></span>The
throbbing pain in all thy limbs that rends thy frame with  
   fever-throes,  
  All malady that wrings thy brow we charm away with this our  
   spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900806">6</span></span>The malady

  Fever whom every Autumn brings we charm away with this our  
   spell. <span id="page_a380">p. a380</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900807">7</span></span>Disease that
creeps about the thighs and, after, reaches both the  
   groins,  
  Consumption from thine inward parts we charm away with this  
   our spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900808">8</span></span>If the
disease originates from love, from hatred, from the heart,  
  Forth from the heart and from the limbs we charm the wasting  
   malady.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900809">9</span></span>The yellow
Jaundice from thy limbs, and Colic from the parts  
   within,

   our spell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900810">10</span></span>Let wasting
malady turn to dust, become the water of disease.  
  I have evoked the poison-taint of all Consumptions out of thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900811">11</span></span>Forth from
the hollow let it run, and rumbling sounds from  
   thine inside.  
  I have evoked the poison-taint of all Consumptions out of thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900812">12</span></span>Forth from
thy belly and thy lungs, forth from thy navel and  
   thy heart.  
  I have evoked the poison taint of all Consumptions out of thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900813">13</span></span>The
penetrating stabs of pain which rend asunder crown and  
   head,  
  Let them depart and pass away, free from disease and harming  
   not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900814">14</span></span>The pangs
that stab the heart and reach the breast-bone and  
   connected parts,  
  Let them depart and pass away, free from disease and harming  
   not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900815">15</span></span>The stabs
that penetrate the sides and pierce their way along the  
   ribs,  
  Let them depart and pass away, free from disease and harming  
   not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900816">16</span></span>The
penetrating pangs that pierce thy stomach as they shoot  
   across,  
  Let them depart and pass away, free from disease and harming  
   not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900817">17</span></span>The pains
that through the bowels creep, disordering the inward  
   parts,  
  Let them depart and pass away, free from disease and harming  
   not. <span id="page_a381">p. a381</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900818">18</span></span>The pains
that suck the marrow out, and rend and tear the bones  
   apart,  
  May they speed forth and pass away, free from disease and  
   harming not.  
<span class="margnote"><span
id="an_0900819">19</span></span>Consumptions with their Colic pains
which make thy limbs  
   insensible  
  I have evoked the poison-taint of all Consumptions out of thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900820">20</span></span>Of piercing
pain, of abscesses, rheumatic ache, ophthalmia—  
  I have evoked the poison-taint of all Consumptions out of thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900821">21</span></span>I have
dispelled the piercing pains from feet, knees, hips, and  
   hinder parts,  
  And spine, and from the neck and nape the malady that racked  
   the head.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0900822">22</span></span>Sound are
the skull-bones of thy head and thy heart's beat is  
   regular.  
  Thou, Sun, arising with thy beams hast chased away the head's  
   disease, hast stilled the pain that racked the limbs.
