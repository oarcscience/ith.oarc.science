### HYMN XXXVII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003701">1</span></span>He, like a
bull with sharpened horns, terrific, singly excites and  
   agitates all the people.  
  Then givest him who largely pours libation his wealth who pours  
   not, for his own possession.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003702">2</span></span>Thou verily,
Indra, gavest help to Kutsa, willingly lending ear  
   to him in battle.  
  When, aiding Arjunneya, thou subduedst to him both Kuyava and  
   the Dāsa Sushna.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003703">3</span></span>O Bold One,
thou with all thine aids hast boldly helped Sudās  
   whose offerings were accepted,  
  Pūru in winning land and slaying foemen, and Trasadasyu son  
   of Purukutsa.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003704">4</span></span>At the Gods'
banquet, Hero-souled! with heroes, Lord of Bay  
  Steeds, thou slewest many Vritras.  
  Thou sentest in swift death to sleep the Dasyu, both Chumuri  
   and Dhuni, for Dabhiti,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003705">5</span></span>These were
thy mighty powers that, Thunder-wielder! then  
   swiftly crushedst nine-and ninety castles. <span id="page_298">p.
298</span>  
  Thou capturedst the hundredth in thine onslaught; thou slewest  
  Namuchi, thou slewest Vritra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003706">6</span></span>Old are the
blessings, Indra, which thou gavest Sudās the wor-  
   shipperwho brought oblations.  
  For thee, the strong I yoke thy strong bay horses: let them,  
   approach our prayers and wealth, Most Mighty!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003707">7</span></span>Give us not
up, Lord of Bay Horses, victor, in this our time of-  
   trouble, to the wicked.  
  Deliver us with true and faithful succour: dear may we be to  
   thee among the princes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003708">8</span></span>May we men,
Bounteous Lord, the friends thou lovest, near i  
   thee be joyful under thy protection.  
  Fain to fulfil the wish of Atithigva, bow Turvasa, bow down,.  
   the son of Yadu.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003709">9</span></span>Swiftly, in
truth, O Bounteous Lord, about thee men skilled im  
   hymning sing their songs and praises.  
  Elect us shares of their love and friendship who by their calls on,  
   thee despoiled the niggards.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003710">10</span></span>Thine are
these Lauds, O manliest of heroes, Lauds which revert  
   to us and give us riches.  
  Favour these, Indra, when they strike the foemen, as Friend and  
  Hero and the heroes' helper.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2003711">11</span></span>Now, lauded
for thine aid, heroic Indra, sped by our prayer,,  
   wax mighty in thy body.  
  To us apportion wealth and habitations. Ye Gods, protect us-  
   evermore with blessings.
