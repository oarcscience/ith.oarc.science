### HYMN XXXVI

#### A charm to secure a husband for a marriageable girl

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203601">1</span></span>To please us
may the suitor come, O Agni, seeking this maid and  
   bringing us good fortune.  
  Approved by wooers, lovely in assemblies, may she be soon  
   made happy with a husband.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203602">2</span></span>As bliss
beloved by Soma, dear to Prayer, and stored by Arya-  
   man,  
  With the God Dhātar's truthfulness I work the bridal oracle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203603">3</span></span>O Agni, may
this woman find a husband. Then verily King Soma  
   makes her happy.  
  May she bear sons, chief lady of the household, blessed and  
   bearing rule beside her consort.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203604">4</span></span>As this
lair, Maghavan! that is fair to look on was dear to wild  
   things as a pleasant dwelling,  
  So may this woman here be Bhaga's darling. Loved by her lord  
   and prizing his affection. <span id="page_a64">p. a64</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203605">5</span></span>Mount up,
embark on Bhaga's ship, the full, the inexhaustible,  
  Thereon bring hitherward to us the lover whom thou fain  
   wouldst wed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203606">6</span></span>Call out to
him, O Lord of Wealth! Make thou the lover well-  
   inclined.  
  Set each on thy right hand who is a lover worthy of her choice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203607">7</span></span>Here is the
Bdellium and the gold, the Auksha and the bliss are  
   here:  
  These bring thee to the husbands, so to find the man whom thou.  
   wouldst have.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203608">8</span></span>May Savitar
lead and bring to thee the husband whom thy heart  
   desires.  
  O Plant, be this thy gift to her!
