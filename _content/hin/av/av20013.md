### HYMN XIII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001301">1</span></span>Lords of
great wealth, Brihaspati and Indra, rejoicing at this  
   sacrifice drink Soma.  
  Let the abundant drops sink deep within you: vouchsafe us  
   riches with full store of heroes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001302">2</span></span>Let your
swift-gliding coursers bear you hitherward with their  
   fleet pinions. Come ye forward with your arms.  
  Sit on the grass; a wide seat hath been made for you: delight  
   yourselves, O Maruts, in the pleasant food.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001303">3</span></span>For
Jātavedas, worthy of our praise, will we frame with our  
   mind this eulogy as 'twere a car.  
  For good in his assembly is this care of ours. Let us not in thy  
   friendship, Agni, suffer harm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001304">4</span></span>With these,
borne on one car, Agni, approach us; or borne on  
   many, for thy steeds are able.  
  Bring, with their Dames, the Gods, the Three-and-Thirty, after  
   thy Godlike nature, and he joyful.
