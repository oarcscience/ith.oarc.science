### HYMN XXXV

#### Magnification of the Odana or oblation of milk and rice

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403501">1</span></span>Odana which
Prajāpati, the firstborn of Order, dressed with  
   fervour for the Brāhman,  
   which guards the worlds from breaking atIthe centre,—I with this  
  Odana will conquer Mrityu. <span id="page_a145">p. a145</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403502">2</span></span>Whereby the
World-Creators vanquished Mrityu, that which  
   they found by fervour, toil and trouble,  
  That which prayer first made ready for the Brāhman,—I with  
   this Odana will conquer Mrityu.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403503">3</span></span>That which
upholds the Earth, the all-sustainer, that which hath  
   filled air's middle realm with moisture,  
  Which, raised on high in grandeur, stablished heaven,—I with  
   this Odana will conquer Mrityu.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403504">4</span></span>From which
the months with thirty spokes were moulded, from  
   which the twelve-spoked year was formed and fashioned.  
  Which circling day and night have ne'er o'ertaken,—I with this  
  Odana will conquer Mrityu.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403505">5</span></span>Which hath
become breath-giver, life-bestower; to which the  
   worlds flow full of oil and fatness,  
  To whom belong all the refulgent regions,—I with this Odana  
   will conquer Mrityu.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403506">6</span></span>From which,
matured, sprang Amrit into being, which hath  
   become Gāyatris lord and ruler,  
  In which the perfect Vedas have been treasured,—I with this  
  Odana will conquer Mrityu,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403507">7</span></span>I drive away
the hostile God-despiser: far off be those who are  
   mine adversaries,  
  I dress Brahmaudana that winneth all things. May the Gods  
   hear me who believe and trust them.
