  Filled with the mingled beverage, with sap and vigour hath it  
   come.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000603">3</span></span>What though
the strong-armed carpenter have cleft thee with

give apportioned food, clarified butter, wine, and

id="page_20">p. 20</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000631">31</span></span>May this
Chaim, offspring of the Gods, make me superior to my  
   foe.  
  So may this charm whose milk expressed these three worlds  
   longingly await,  
  Be fastened on me here, that it may crown me with surpassing  
   power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000632">32</span></span>The Charm
to which men, Fathers, Gods look ever for their  
   maintenance,  
  May this be fastened on me here, to crown me with surpassing  
   power  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000633">33</span></span>As, when
the plough hath tilled the soil, the seed springs up in.  
   fertile land,  
  Let cattle, progeny, and food of every kind spring up with me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000634">34</span></span>Charm,
forwarder of sacrifice, who hast a hundred priestly fees.  
  Speed to preeminence him to whom I have attached thy happy  
   fate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1000635">35</span></span>Love thou,
O Agni, pleased with burnt oblations, this sacred  
   fuel that is ranged in order.  
  In him may we find grace and loving-kindness, happiness,  
   progeny, and sight and cattle, in Jātavedas kindled with  
   devotion.
