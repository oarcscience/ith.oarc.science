### HYMN XVI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001601">1</span></span>Like birds
who keep their watch, plashing in water, like the loud  
   voices of the thundering rain-cloud,  
  Like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain thus to  
  Brihaspati our hymns have sounded.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001602">2</span></span>The son of
Angiras, meeting the cattle, as Bhaga, brought in  
  Aryaman among us.  
  As Friend of men he decks the wife and husband. As for the  
   race, Brihaspati, nerve our coursers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001603">3</span></span>Brihaspati,
having won them from the mountains, strewed down,  
   like barley out of winnowing-baskets,  
  The vigorous, wandering cows who aid the pious, desired of all,  
   of blameless form, well-coloured.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001604">4</span></span>As the Sun
dews with meath the seat of Order, and casts a flam-  
   ing meteor down from heaven,  
  So from the rock Brihaspati forced the cattle, and cleft the  
   earth's skin as it were with water.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001605">5</span></span>Forth from
mid-air with light he draye the darkness, as the gale  
   blows a lily from the river.  
  Like the wind grasping at the cloud of Vala, Brihaspati gathered  
   to himself the cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001606">6</span></span>Brihaspati,
when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the  
   weapon of reviling Vala,  
  Consumed him as tongues eat what teeth have compassed: he  
   threw the prisons of the red cows open.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001607">7</span></span>That secret
name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave  
  Brihaspati discovered,  
  And draye, himself, the bright kine from the mountain, like a  
   bird's young after the eggs' disclosure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001608">8</span></span>He looked
around on rock-imprisoned sweetness as one who  
   eyes a fish in scanty water.  
  Brihaspati, cleaving through with varied clamour, brought it  
   forth like a bowl from out the timber. <span id="page_276">p.
276</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001609">9</span></span>He found the
light of heaven, and fire, and Morning: with lucid  
   rays he forced apart the darkness.  
  As from a joint, Brihaspati took the marrow of Vala as he  
   gloried in his cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001610">10</span></span>As trees
for foliage robbed by winter, Vala mourned for the  
   cows Brihaspati had taken.  
  He did a deed ne'er done, ne'er to be equalled, whereby the sun  
   and moon ascend alternate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001611">11</span></span>Like a dark
steed adorned with pearl, the Fathers have decorat-  
   ed heaven with constellations.  
  They set the light in day, in night the darkness, Brihaspati cleft  
   the rock and found the cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001612">12</span></span>This homage
have we offered to the Cloud-God who thunders  
   out to many in succession.  
  May this Brihaspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and  
   horses, men, and heroes.
