### HYMN CXXV

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012501">1</span></span>Drive all
our enemies away, O Indra, the western, mighty Con-  
   queror, and the eastern,  
  Hero, drive off our northern foes and southern, that we in thy  
   wide shelter may be joyful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012502">2</span></span>What then?
As men whose fields are full of barley reap the ripe  
   corn removing it in order,  
  So bring the food of those men, bring it hither, who come not  
   to prepare the grass for worship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012503">3</span></span>Men come not
with one horse at sacred seasons; thus they  
   obtain no honour in assemblies.  
  Sages desiring herds of kine and horses strengthen the mighty  
  Indra for his friendship.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012504">4</span></span>Ye, Asvins,
Lords of Splendour, drank full draughts of grateful  
  Soma juice,  
  And aided Indra in his work with Namuchi of Asura birth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012505">5</span></span>As parents
aid a son, both Asvins, Indra, aided thee with their  
   wondrous powers and wisdom  
  When thou, with might, hadst drunk the draught that glad-  
   dens, Sarasvati, O Maghavan refreshed thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012506">6</span></span>Indra is
strong to save, rich in assistance: may he, possessing  
   all, be kind and gracious.  
  May he disperse our foes and give us safety, and may we be the  
   lords of hero vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012507">7</span></span>May we enjoy
his favour, his the holy: may we enjoy his blessed  
   loving-kindness.  
  May this rich Indra, as our good protector, drive off and keep  
   afar all those who hate us.
