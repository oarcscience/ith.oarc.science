### HYMN VI

#### A charm to make a poisoned arrow harmless

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400601">1</span></span>The Brāhman
first was brought to life ten-headed and with faces  
   ten.  
  First drinker of the Soma, he made poison ineffectual.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400602">2</span></span>Far as the
heavens and earth are spread in compass, far as the  
  Seven Rivers are extended,  
  So far my spell, the antidote of poison, have I spoken hence,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400603">3</span></span>The
strong-winged Bird Garutmān first of all, O Poison fed on  
   thee:  
  Thou didst not gripe or make him drunk: aye, thou becamest  
   food for him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400604">4</span></span>Whoever with
five fingers hath discharged thee from the crooked  
   bow,  
  I from the shaft have charmed away the poison of the fastening  
   band.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400605">5</span></span>The poison
have I charmed away from shaft, cement, and feather-  
   ed end;  
  Yea, from the barb, the neck, the horn, the poison have I charmed  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400606">6</span></span>Feeble, O
Arrow, is thy shaft, thy poison, too, hath lost its  
   strength.  
  Made of a worthless tree, thy bow, O feeble one, is impotent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400607">7</span></span>The men who
brayed it, smeared it on, they who discharged it,  
   sent it forth,  
  All these are made emasculate, emasculate the poison-hill.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0400608">8</span></span>Thy diggers
are emasculate, emasculate, O, Plant art thou.  
  The rugged mountain that produced this poison is emasculate.
