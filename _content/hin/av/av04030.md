### HYMN XXX

#### A glorification of vāk or speech

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403001">1</span></span>I travel
with the Rudras and the Vasus, with the Ādityas and  
  All-Gods I wander.  
  I hold aloft both Varuna and Mitra, I hold aloft Indra and  
   both the Asvins.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403002">2</span></span>I am the
Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful,  
   first of those who merit worship.  
  The Gods, making me enter many places, in diverse spots have  
   set mine habitation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403003">3</span></span>I, verily,
myself announce and utter the word that Gods, and  
   men alike shall welcome.  
  I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him a sage, a  
  Rishi, and a Brāhman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403004">4</span></span>Through me
alone all eat the food that feeds them, each man  
   who sees, breathes, hears, the word out-spoken.  
  They know it not, but yet they dwell beside me. Hear, one and  
   all, the truth as I declare it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403005">5</span></span>I bend the
bow for Rudra that his arrow may strike and slay  
   the hater of devotion.  
  I rouse and order battle for the people, and I have penetrated  
  Earth and Heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403006">6</span></span>I cherish
and sustain high-swelling Soma, and Tvashtar I support,  
  Pashan, and Bhaga.  
  I load with wealth the zealous sacrificer who pours the juice and  
   offers his oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403007">7</span></span>On the
world's summit I bring forth the Father: my home is in  
   the waters, in the ocean.  
  Thence I extend o'er all existing creatures, and touch even  
   yonder heaven with my forehead.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0403008">8</span></span>I breathe a
strong breath like the wind and tempest, the while I  
   hold together all existence. <span id="page_a140">p. a140</span>  
  Beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens I have become  
   so mighty in my grandeur.
