### HYMN XXXV

#### Expiation for an imperfectly performed sacrifice

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203501">1</span></span>We who
enjoying it have grown no richer, for whom the sacred  
   altar-fires have sorrowed,  
  We who compounded with deficient worship,—may Visvakarman  
   make our service prosper.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203502">2</span></span>Rishis have
called the sacrifice's patron amerced through sin,  
   sorrowing for his offspring.  
  Those drops of meath whereof the missed enjoyment,—may  
  Visvakarman with those drops unite us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203503">3</span></span>Regarding
niggard churls as Soma-drinkers, skilful in sacrifice,  
   weak at the meeting,  
  Whatever sin the captive hath committed, do thou for weal  
   release him, Visvakarman!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203504">4</span></span>Awful are
Rishis: unto them be homage, and to their eye and  
   truthfulness of spirit!  
  Loud homage to Brihaspati, O mighty! Homage to thee, O  
  Visvakarman! Guard us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0203505">5</span></span>The eye of
sacrifice, source, and beginning—with voice, ear,  
   spirit unto him I offer.  
  To this our sacrifice wrought by Visvakarman may the Gods  
   come gracious and kindly-hearted.
