### HYMN XXVIII

#### A charm to change the ill-omened birth of twin calves into a blessing

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302701">1</span></span>This cow was
born to bring forth offspring singly, though they  
   created kine of every colour.  
  When she produces twins in spite of Order, sullen, with groan  
   and grudge she harms the cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302702">2</span></span>She brings
destruction on the beasts, turned to a flesh-devouring  
   worm.  
  Yes, give her to the Brāhman that she may bring luck and  
   happiness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302703">3</span></span>Be thou
auspicious to our folk, bring luck to horses and to kine.  
  Auspicious unto all this farm, bring luck and happiness to us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302704">4</span></span>Let there be
rain and increase here, here be thou most munifi-  
   cient.  
  Mother of twins, prosper our herd.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302705">5</span></span>Where,
having left all sickness of their bodies, the pious lead, as  
   friends, their lives of gladness  
  Nigh to that world approached the twin calves' mother. Let her  
   not harm our people and our cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0302706">6</span></span>Where lies
the world of those dear friends, the pious, those who  
   have brought due sacrifice to Agni  
  Nigh to that world approached the twins calves' mother. Let her  
   not harm our people and our cattle.
