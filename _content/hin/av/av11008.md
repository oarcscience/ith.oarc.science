### HYMN VIII

#### On the origin of some Gods and the creation of man

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100801">1</span></span>When Manyu
brought his consort home forth from Sankalpa's  
   dwelling-place,  
  Who were the wooers of the bride, who was the chief who  
   courted her?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100802">2</span></span>Fervour and
Action were the two, in depths of the great billowy  
   sea?  
  These were the wooers of the bride; Brahma the chief who  
   courted her.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100803">3</span></span>Ten Gods
before the Gods were born together in the ancient  
   time.  
  Whoso may know them face to face may now pronounce the  
   mighty word.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100804">4</span></span>Inbreath and
outbreath, eye and ear, decay and freedom from.  
   decay, <span id="page_65">p. 65</span>  
  Spiration upward and diffused, voice, mind have brought us  
   wish and plan.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100805">5</span></span>As yet the
Seasons were unborn, and Dilator and Prajāpati,  
  Both Asvins, Indra, Agni. Whom then did they worship as  
   supreme?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100806">6</span></span>Fervour and
Action were the two, in depths of the great billowy  
   sea;  
  Fervour sprang up from Action: this they served and worship-  
   ped as supreme.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100807">7</span></span>He may
account himself well versed in ancient time who knows  
   by name.  
  The earth that was before this earth, which only wisest Sages  
   know.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100808">8</span></span>From whom
did Indra spring? from whom sprang Soma?  
   whence was Agni born?  
  From whom did Tvashtar spring to life? and whence is Dilator's  
   origin?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100809">9</span></span>Indra from
Indra, Soma from Soma, Agni from Agni sprang  
  Tvashtar from Tvashtar was produced, Dilator was Dhātar's  
   origin.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100810">10</span></span>Those Gods
who were of old, the Ten begotten earlier than the  
  Gods,  
  What world do they inhabit since they gave the world unto  
   their sons?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100811">11</span></span>When he had
brought together hair, sinew and bone, marrow  
   and flesh.  
  And to the body added feet, then to what world did he depart?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100812">12</span></span>Whence,
from what region did he bring the hair, the sinews, and  
   the bones,  
  Marrow and limbs, and joints, and flesh? Who was the bringer,  
   and from whence?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100813">13</span></span>Casters,
those Gods were called who brought together all the  
   elements:  
  When they had fused the mortal man complete, they entered  
   into him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100814">14</span></span>The thighs,
the knee-bones, and the feet, the head, the face,  
  Land both the hands,  
  The ribs, the nipples, and the sides—what I ishi hath constructed  
   that? <span id="page_66">p. 66</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100815">15</span></span>Head, both
the hands, and face, and tongue, and neck, and inter-  
   coastal parts,  
  All this, investing it with skins, Mahi conjoined with bond and  
   tie.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100816">16</span></span>What time
the might body lay firmly compact with tie and bond,  
  Who gave its colour to the form, the hue wherewith it shines  
   to-day?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100817">17</span></span>All Deities
had lent their aid: of this a noble Dame took note,  
  Tsā, the Consort of Command. She gave its colour to the form.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100818">18</span></span>When
Tvashtar, Tvashtar's loftier Sire, had bored it out and  
   hollowed it.  
  Gods made the mortal their abode, and entered and possessed  
   the man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100819">19</span></span>Sleep,
specially, Sloth, Nirriti, and deities whose name is Sin,  
  Baldness, old age, and hoary hairs within the body found their  
   way.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100820">20</span></span>Theft,
evil-doing, and deceit, truth, sacrifice, exalted fame,  
  Strength, princely power, and energy entered the body as a  
   home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100821">21</span></span>Prosperity
and poverty, kindnesses and malignities,  
  Hunger and thirst of every kind entered the body as a home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100822">22</span></span>Reproaches,
freedom from reproach, all blamable, all blameless  
   deeds,  
  Bounty, belief, and unbelief entered the body as a home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100823">23</span></span>All
knowledge and all ignorance, each other thing that one may  
   learn,  
  Entered the body, prayer, and hymns, and songs, and sacrificial  
   texts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100824">24</span></span>Enjoyments,
pleasures, and delights, gladness, and rapturous  
   ecstasies.  
  Laughter and merriment and dance entered the body as a home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100825">25</span></span>Discourse
and conversation, and the shrill-resounding cries of  
   woe,  
  All entered in, the motives and the purposes combined there-  
   with.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100826">26</span></span>Inbreath
and outbreath, ear and eye, decay and freedom from  
   decay.  
  Breath upward and diffused, voice, mind, these quickly with the  
   body move, <span id="page_67">p. 67</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100827">27</span></span>All earnest
wishes, all commands, directions, and admonish-  
   ments.  
  Reflections, all deliberate plans entered the body as a home.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100828">28</span></span>They laid
in the abhorrent frame those waters hidden, bright,  
   and thick,  
  Which in the bowels spring from blood, from mourning or from  
   hasty toil.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100829">29</span></span>Fuel they
turned to bone, and then they set light waters in the  
   frame.  
  The molten butter they made seed: then the Gods entered into  
   man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100830">30</span></span>All Waters,
all the Deities. Virāj with Brahma at her side:  
  Brahma into the body passed: Prajāpati is Lord thereof.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100831">31</span></span>The Sun and
Wind formed, separate, the eye and vital breath of  
   man.  
  His other person have the Gods bestowed on Agni as a gift.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100832">32</span></span>Therefore
whoever knoweth man regardeth him as Brāhman's  
   self:  
  For all the Deities abide in him as cattle in their pen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100833">33</span></span>At his
first death he goeth hence, asunder, in three separate  
   parts.  
  He goeth yonder with one part, with one he goeth yonder:  
   here he sinketh downward with a third.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1100834">34</span></span>In the
primeval waters cold the body is deposited.  
  In this there is the power of growth: from this is power of  
   growth declared.
