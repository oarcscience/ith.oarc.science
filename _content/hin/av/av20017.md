### HYMN XVII

  I. In perfect unison all yearning hymns of mine that find the light  
   of heaven have sung forth Indra's praise.  
  As wives embrace their lord, the comely bridegroom, so they  
   compass Maghavan about that he may help.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001702">2</span></span>Directed
unto thee my spirit never strays, for I have set my  
   hopes on thee, O much-invoked!  
  Sit, wonderful! as King upon the sacred grass, and let thy  
   drinking-place be by the Soma juice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001703">3</span></span>From
indigence and hunger Indra turns away: Maghavan hath  
   dominion over precious wealth.  
  These the Seven Rivers flowing on their downward path increase  
   the vital vigour of the Mighty Steer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001704">4</span></span>As on the
fair-leafed tree rest birds, to Indra flow the gladden-  
   ing Soma juices that the bowls contain.  
  Their face that glows with splendour through their mighty  
   power hath found the shine of heaven for man, the Aryas'  
   light.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001705">5</span></span>As in the
game a gambler piles his winnings, so Maghavan,  
   sweeping all together, gained the Sun.  
  This mighty deed of thine none other could achieve, none,  
  Maghavan, before thee, none in recent time.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001706">6</span></span>Maghavan
came by turns to all the tribes of men: the Steer  
   took notice of the people's songs of praise.  
  The man in whose libations Sakra hath delight by means of  
   potent Somas vanquisheth his foes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001707">7</span></span>As waters
flow together to the river, thus Somas to Indra flow,  
   as rivulets to the lake.  
  In place of sacrifice sages exalt his might, as the rain swells the  
   corn by moisture sent from heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001708">8</span></span>He rushes
through the region like a furious bull, he who hath  
   made these floods the dames of worthy lords.  
  This Maghavan hath found light for the man who brings  
   oblation, sheds the juice, and promptly pours his gifts.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001709">9</span></span>Let the keen
axe come forth together with the light: here be,  
   as erst, the teeming cow of sacrifice.  
  Let the Red God shine pure with his refulgent ray, and let the  
  Lord of heroes glow like heaven's clear sheen. <span id="page_278">p.
278</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001710">10</span></span>O
much-invoked, may we subdue all famine and evil want with  
   store of grain and cattle.  
  May we allied, as first in rank, with princes, obtain possessions  
   by our own exertion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001711">11</span></span>Brihaspati
protect us from the rearward, and from above, and  
   from below, from sinners.  
  May Indra from the front, and from the centre, as friend to  
   friends, vouchsafe us room and freedom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2001712">12</span></span>Ye twain
are Lords of wealth in earth and heaven, thou, O  
  Brihaspati, and thou, O Indra.  
  Mean though he be, give wealth to him who lauds you. Preserve  
   us evermore, ye Gods, with blessings.
