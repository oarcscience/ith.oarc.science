### HYMN CIV

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010401">1</span></span>May these my
songs of praise exalt thee, Lord who hast abun-  
   dant wealth.  
  Men skilled in holy hymns, bright with the hues of fire, have  
   sung them with their lauds to thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010402">2</span></span>He with his
might enhanced by Rishis thousand-fold, hath like  
   an ocean spread himself. <span id="page_349">p. 349</span>  
  His majesty is praised as true at solemn rites, his power where  
   holy singers rule  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010403">3</span></span>May Indra,
who in every fight must be invoked, be near to us.  
  May the most mighty Vritra-slayer, meet for praise, come to  
   libations and to hymns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2010404">4</span></span>Thou art the
best of all in sending bounteous gifts, true art thou,.  
   lordly in thine act.  
  We claim alliance with the very Glorious One, yea, with the-  
   mighty Son of Strength.
