### HYMN XCVII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009701">1</span></span>Here verily
yesterday we let the Thunder-wielder drink his fill.  
  So in like manner, offer him the juice to day. Now range you.  
   by the Glorious One.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009702">2</span></span>Even the
wolf, the savage beast that rends the sheep, follows the  
   path of his decrees.  
  So, India, graciously accepting this our praise, with wondrous.  
   thought come forth to us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2009703">3</span></span>What manly
deed of vigour now remains that Indra hath not  
   done?  
  Who hath not heard his glorious title and his fame, the Vritra-  
   slayer from his birth?
