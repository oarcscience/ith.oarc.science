### HYMN XXVI

#### Praise of Vishnu

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702601">1</span></span>I will
declare the mighty deeds of Vishnu, of him who measured  
   out the earthly regions, <span id="page_a281">p. a281</span>  
  Who propped the highest place of congregation, thrice setting  
   down his footstep, widely striding.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702602">2</span></span>Loud boast
doth Vishnu make of this achievement, like some  
   wild beast, dread, prowling, mountain-roaming.  
  May he approach us from the farthest distance.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702603">3</span></span>Thou within
whose three wide-extended paces all worlds and  
   creatures have their habitation,  
  Drink oil, thou homed in oil! promote the sacrificer more and  
   more.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702604">4</span></span>Through all
this world strode Vishnu: thrice his foot he planted,  
   and the whole  
  Was gathered in his footstep's dust.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702605">5</span></span>Vishnu the
guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps,  
   thenceforth.  
  Establishing these high decrees.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702606">6</span></span>Look ye on
Vishnu's works, whereby the friend of Indra, close-  
   allied,  
  Hath let his holy ways be seen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702607">7</span></span>The princes
evermore behold that loftiest place where Vishnu is,  
  Like an extended eye in heaven,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0702608">8</span></span>From heaven,
O Vishnu, or from earth, O Vishnu, or from the  
   great far-spreading air's mid-region,  
  Fill both thy hands full of abundant treasures, and from the  
   right and left bestow them freely.
