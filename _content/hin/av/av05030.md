### HYMN XXX

#### A charm to restore life and health

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503001">1</span></span>From thy
vicinity I call, from near, from far, from night at  
   hand.  
  Stay here: depart not: follow not the Fathers of the olden  
   time. I bind thy vital spirit fast.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503002">2</span></span>If any man,
a stranger or akin, hath cast a spell on thee,  
  I with my voice to thee declare thy freedom and release there-  
   from.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503003">3</span></span>If in thy
folly thou hast lied or cursed a woman or a man,  
  I with my voice declare to thee thy freedom and release there-  
   from. <span id="page_a195">p. a195</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503004">4</span></span>If thou art
lying there because of mother's or of father's sin,  
  I with my voice declare to thee thy freedom and release there-  
   from.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503005">5</span></span>Accept the
healing medicine, the balm thy mother and thy sire,  
  Thy sister and thy brother bring. I make thee live through  
   lengthened years.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_050306">6</span></span>O man, stay
here among us; stay with all thy spirit: follow not  
  Yama's two messengers. Approach the castles where the living  
   dwell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503007">7</span></span>Come back as
thou art called to come, knowing the outlet of  
   the path,  
  And the Approach and its ascent, the way of every living man.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503008">8</span></span>Be not
alarmed: thou wilt not die. I give thee lengthened years  
   of life.  
  Forth from thy members have I charmed Decline that caused  
   the fever there.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503009">9</span></span>Gone is the
pain that racked thee, gone thy fever, gone thy  
   heart's disease.  
  Consumption, conquered by my voice, hath, like a hawk, fled  
   far away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503010">10</span></span>Two sages,
Sense and Vigilance, the sleepless and the watchful  
   one,  
  These, the protectors of thy life, shall be awake both day and  
   night.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503011">11</span></span>This Agni
must be waited on. Here let the Sun mount up for  
   thee.  
  Rise from deep death and come away, yea, from black darkness  
   rise thou up!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503012">12</span></span>Homage be
paid to Yama, to Mrityu, and to the Fathers, and to  
   those who guide us!  
  I honour first, for this man's preservation, that Agni who well  
   knoweth how to save him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503013">13</span></span>Let breath
and mind return to him, let sight and vigour come  
   again  
  Let all his body be restored and firmly stand upon its feet.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503014">14</span></span>Provide
this man with breath and sight, O Agni, and with his  
   body and his strength unite him.  
  Thou knowest Amrit: let him not go hence, nor dwell in house  
   of clay.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503015">15</span></span>Let not
thine inward breathing fail, let not thine outward breath <span
id="page_a196">p. a196</span>  
   be lost.  
  Let Sūrya who is Lord Supreme raise thee from death with  
   beams of light.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503016">16</span></span>Tied,
tremulously moving, here the tongue is speaking in the  
   mouth.  
  With thee I charmed Decline away and Fever's hundred ago-  
   nies.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0503017">17</span></span>This living
world, unconquered of the Gods, is most beloved of  
   all.  
  To whatsoever death thou wast destined when thou wast born,.  
  O man,  
  This death and we call after thee. Die not before decrepit age!
