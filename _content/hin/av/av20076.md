### HYMN LXXVI

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007601">1</span></span>As sits the
young bird on the tree rejoicing, ye, swift pair, have  
   been roused by clear laudation,  
  Whose Hoter-priest through many days is Indra, earth's  
   guardian, friend of men, the best of heroes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007602">2</span></span>May we, when
this Dawn and the next dance hither, be thy best  
   servants, most heroic Hero!  
  Let the victorious car with triple splendour bring hitherward the  
   hundred chiefs with Kutsa.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007603">3</span></span>What was the
gladdening draught that pleased thee, Indra?  
  Speed to our doors, our songs, for thou art mighty.  
  Why comest thou to me, what gift attracts thee?  
  Fain would I bring thee food most meet to offer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007604">4</span></span>Indra, what
fame hath one like thee mid heroes? With what  
   plan wilt thou act? Why hast thou sought us?  
  As a true friend, Wide-Strider! to sustain us, since food absorbs  
   the thought of each among us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007605">5</span></span>Speed
happily those, as Sūrya ends his journey, who meet his  
   wish as bridegrooms meet their spouses;  
  Men who support, O Indra strong by nature, with food the  
   many songs that tell thy praises. <span id="page_327">p. 327</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007606">6</span></span>Thine are
two measures, Indra, wide, well-meted, heaven for thy  
   majesty, earth for thy wisdom.  
  Here for thy choice are Somas mixed with butter: may the  
   sweet meath be pleasant for thy drinking.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007607">7</span></span>They have
poured out a bowl to him, to Indra, full of sweet  
   juice, for faithful is his bounty.  
  O'er earth's expanse hath he grown great by wisdom, the friend  
   of man, and by heroic exploits.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007608">8</span></span>Indra hath
conquered in his wars the mighty: men strive in  
   multitudes to win his friendship.  
  Ascend thy chariot as it were in battle, which thou shalt drive  
   to us with gracious favour,
