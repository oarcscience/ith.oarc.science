### HYMN XV

#### A prayer for peace and security

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901501">1</span></span>Indra, give
us security from that whereof we are afraid.  
  Help us, O Maghavan, let thy succour grant us this: drive foes  
   and enemies afar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901502">2</span></span>We call on
Indra, on the liberal giver: we will be prosperous in  
   men and cattle.  
  Let not the hosts of cruel fiends approach us. Drive of the  
  Druhs to every side, O Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901503">3</span></span>Best, making
household wealth increase. Indra our saviour, kills  
   the foe.  
  May he from outmost point be our potector, and from the  
   centre and from west and eastward.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901504">4</span></span>Lead us to
ample room. O thou who knowest, to happiness  
   security, and sunlight.  
  Strong, Indra, are the arms of thee the mighty: may we betake  
   us to their lofty shelter.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901505">5</span></span>May air's
mid-region give us peace and safety, safety may both  
   these, Heaven and Earth, afford us.  
  Security be ours from west, from eastward, from north and  
   south may we be free from danger.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1901506">6</span></span>Safety be
ours from friend and from the unfriendly, safety from  
   what we know and what we know not.  
  Safety be ours by night and in the day-time! friendly to me be  
   all my hopes and wishes!
