### HYMN IV

#### A glorification of the Sun as the only Deity

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300401">1</span></span>Down
looking, on the ridge of sky Savitar goes to highest  
   heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300402">2</span></span>To misty
cloud filled with his rays Mahendra goes encompassed  
   round.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300403">3</span></span>Creator and
Ordainer, he is Vāyu, he is lifted cloud.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300404">4</span></span>Rudra, and
Mahādeva, he is Aryaman and Varuna.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300405">5</span></span>Agni is he,
and Siirya, he is verily Mahāyama.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300406">6</span></span>Calves,
joined, stand close beside him, ten in number, with one  
   single head.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300407">7</span></span>From west to
east they bend their way: when he mounts up he  
   shines afar.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300408">8</span></span>His are
these banded Maruts: they move gathered close like  
   porters' thongs. <span id="page_125">p. 125</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300409">9</span></span>To misty
cloud filled with his rays Mahendra goes encompassed  
   round,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300410">10</span></span>His are the
nine supports, the casks set in nine several places  
   here.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300411">11</span></span>He keeppeth
watch o'er creatures, all that breatheth and that  
   breatheth not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300412">12</span></span>This
conquering might hath entered him, He is the sole the  
   simple One, the One alone.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300413">13</span></span>In him
these Deities become simple and One  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300414">14</span></span>Renown and
glory, and force and cloud, the Brāhman's  
   splendour, and food, and nourishment,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300415">15</span></span>To him who
knoweth this God as simple and one.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300416">16</span></span>Neither
second, nor third, nor yet fourth is he called;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300417">17</span></span>He is
called neither fifth, nor sixth, nor yet seventh  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300418">18</span></span>He is
called neither eighth, nor ninth, nor yet tenth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300419">19</span></span>He watcheth
over creatures, all that breatheth and that breatheth  
   not.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300420">20</span></span>This
conquering might hath entered him. He is the sole, the  
   simple One, the One alone,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300421">21</span></span>In him
these Deities become simple and One  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300422">22</span></span>Devotion
and Religious Fervour, and renown and glory, and  
   force and cloud, the Brāhman's splendour, and food and  
   nourishment.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300423">23</span></span>And past
and future, and Faith and lustre, and heaven and sweet  
   oblation,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300424">24</span></span>To him who
knoweth this God as simple and One.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300425">25</span></span>He, verily,
is death, he is immortality, he is the monster, he is  
   the fiend.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300426">26</span></span>He is
Rudra, winner of wealth in the giving of wealth; in uttering  
   homage he is the sacrificial exclamation Vashat duly employed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300427">27</span></span>All
sorcerers on earth obey with reverence his high behest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300428">28</span></span>All
constellations yonder, with the Moon, are subject to his will.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300429">29</span></span>He was
brought forth from Day: and Day derives his origin.  
   from him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300430">30</span></span>He was
brought forth from Night: and Night derives her origins  
   from him.

produced from Air: and Air derives its origin from him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300432">32</span></span>He was
produced from Wind: and Wind derives his origin from.  
   him. <span id="page_126">p. 126</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300433">33</span></span>From Heaven
was he produced: and Heaven derives his origin  
   from him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300434">34</span></span>He sprang
from regions of the sky: from him the heavenly  
   regions sprang.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300435">35</span></span>He is the
offspring of the Earth: Earth hath her origin from  
   him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300436">36</span></span>He was
produced from fire: and fire derives its origin from  
   him.

waters' offspring: and from him the waters were  
   produced.

verses was he born: from him the holy verses  
   sprang.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300439">39</span></span>He is the
son of sacrifice: and sacrifice was born from him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300440">40</span></span>Sacrifice,
sacrifice's Lord, he was made head of sacrifice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300441">41</span></span>He
thundereth, he lighteneth, he casteth down the thunder-stone  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300442">42</span></span>For misery
or happiness, for mortal man or Asura.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300443">43</span></span>Whether
thou formest growing plants, or sendest rain for  
   happiness, or hast increased the race of man,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300444">44</span></span>Such is thy
greatness, liberal Lord! A hundred bodily forms are  
   thine.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300445">45</span></span>Millions
are in thy million, or thou art a billion in thyself.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300446">46</span></span>Stronger
than immortality is Indra: stronger thou than deaths;  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1300447">47</span></span>Yea,
stronger than Malignity art thou, O Indra, Lord of Might.
