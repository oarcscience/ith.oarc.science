### HYMN XLVII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004701">1</span></span>We make this
Indra show his strength, to strike the mighty  
  Vritra dead:  
  A vigorous Hero shall he be.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004702">2</span></span>Indra was
made for giving, most powerful, friendly in carouse,  
  Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song. <span id="page_304">p.
304</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004703">3</span></span>By song, as
'twere, the mighty bolt, which none may parry, was  
   prepared:  
  Lofty, invincible he grew.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004710">10</span></span>They who
stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the  
   ruddy Steed:  
  The lights are shining in the sky.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004711">11</span></span>They yoke
on both sides to the car the two bay coursers dear to  
   him,  
  Bold, tawny, bearers of the Chief.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004712">12</span></span>Thou,
making light where no light was, and form, O Men r  
   where no form was,  
  Wast born together with the Dawns,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004713">13</span></span>His bright
rays bear him up aloft, the God who knoweth all that=  
   is,  
  Sūrya, that every one may see.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004714">14</span></span>The
constellations pass away, like thieves, together with their-  
   beams,  
  Before the all-beholding Sun.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004715">15</span></span>His herald
rays are seen afar refulgent o'er the world of men,  
  Like fiery flames that burn and blaze.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004716">16</span></span>Swift and
all-beautiful art thou, O Sūrya, maker of the light.  
  Illuming all the radiant realm.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004717">17</span></span>Thou guest
to the troops of Gods, thou comest hither to man-  
   kind,  
  Hither, all light for us to see.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004718">18</span></span>Thou with
that eye of thine wherewith thou seest, brilliant.  
  Varuna,  
  The active one throughout mankind.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004719">19</span></span>Pervadest
heaven and wide mid-air, melting the days out with.  
   thy beams,  
  Sun, seeing all things that have birth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004720">20</span></span>Seven bay
steeds, harnessed to thy car, bear thee, O.thou far-  
   seeing One,  
  God, Sūrya, thee with radiant hair.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2004721">21</span></span>Sūrya hath
yoked the seven bright mares, the daughters of the  
   car: With these,  
  His own dear team, he travelleth.
