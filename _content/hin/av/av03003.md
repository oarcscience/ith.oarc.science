### HYMN III

#### A charm for the restoration of an expelled king

  L Loudly he roared. Here let him labour deftly. Spread, Agni, over  
   spacious earth and heaven. <span id="page_a68">p. a68</span>  
  Let Maruts who possesses all treasures yoke thee. Bring him who  
   reverently paid oblations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300302">2</span></span>Though he be
far away, let the red horses bring Indra, bring the  
   sage to us and friendship,  
  Since with Sautrāmani Gods for him o'erpower Gāyatri, Brihatī,  
   and hymn of praises.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300303">3</span></span>King Varuna
call thee hither from the waters! From hills and  
   mountains Soma call thee hither!  
  Let Indra call thee hither to these people. Fly hither to these  
   people as a falcon.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300304">4</span></span>May the hawk
bring the man who must be summoned, from far  
   away, in alien land, an exile.  
  May both the Asvins make thy pathway easy. Come, and unite  
   yourselves with him, ye Kinsmen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300305">5</span></span>Let thine
opponents call thee back. Thy friends have chosen,  
   thee again.  
  Indra and Agni, all the Gods have kept thy home amid the  
   tribe.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300306">6</span></span>He who
disputes our calling thee, be he a stranger or akin.  
  Drive him, O Indra, far away, and do thou bring this man to  
   us.
