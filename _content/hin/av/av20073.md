### HYMN LXXIII

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007301">1</span></span>All these
libations are for thee, O Hero: to thee I offer these  
   my prayers that strengthen.  
  Ever, in every place, must men invoke thee. <span id="page_324">p.
324</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007302">2</span></span>Never do men
attain, O Wonder-worker, thy greatness, Mighty  
  One who must be lauded,  
  Nor, Indra, thine heroic power and bounty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007303">3</span></span>Bring to the
Wise, the Great who waxeth mighty your offerings  
   and make ready your devotion:  
  To many clans he goeth, man's Controller.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007304">4</span></span>When, with
the Princes, Maghavan, famed of old, comes nigh  
   the thunderbolt of gold and the Controller's car  
  Which his two tawny coursers draw, then Indra is the Sovran  
  Lord of power whose fame spreads far and wide.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007305">5</span></span>With him too
is this rain of his that comes like herds: Indra  
   throws drops of moisture on his yellow beard.  
  When the sweet juice is shed he seeks the pleasant place, and  
   stirs the worshipper as the wind disturbs the wood.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2007306">6</span></span>We laud and
praise his several deeds of valour who, fatherlike,.  
   with power hath made us stronger;  
  Who with his voice slew many thousand wicked ones who spake  
   in varied manner with contemptuous cries.
