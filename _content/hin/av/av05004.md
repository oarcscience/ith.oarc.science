### HYMN IV

#### A charm against fever and other ailments

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500401">1</span></span>Thou who
wast born on mountains, thou most mighty of all  
   plants that grow.  
  Thou Banisher of Fever, come, Kushtha! make Fever pass  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500402">2</span></span>Brought from
the Snowy Mountain, born on the high hill where  
   eagles breed,  
  Men seek to buy thee when they hear: for Fever's Banisher  
   they know.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500403">3</span></span>In the third
heaven above us stands the Asvattha tree, the seat  
   of Gods.  
  There the Gods sought the Kushtha Plant, embodiment of end-  
   less life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500404">4</span></span>There moved
through heaven a golden ship, a ship with cordage  
   wrought of Gold.  
  There the Gods won the Kushtha Plant, the blossom of eternal  
   life. <span id="page_a159">p. a159</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500405">5</span></span>They sailed
on pathways paved with gold, the oars they piled  
   were wrought of gold:  
  All golden were the ships wherein they carried Kushtha down  
   to earth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500406">6</span></span>O Kushtha,
bring thou hitherward this man of mine, restore his  
   health,  
  Yes, free him from disease for me.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500407">7</span></span>Thou art
descended from thee Gods, Soma's benignant friend  
   art thou,  
  Befriend my breath and vital air be gracious unto this mine eye.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500408">8</span></span>Sprung,
northward, from the Snowy Hill thou art conveyed to  
   eastern men.  
  There they deal out among themselves Kushtha's most noble  
   qualities.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500409">9</span></span>Most
excellent, indeed, art thou, Kushtha! most noble is thy  
   sire.  
  Make all Consumption pass away and render Fever powerless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0500410">10</span></span>Malady that
affects the head, eye-weakness, bodily defect—  
  All this let Kushtha heal and cure: aye, godlike is the vigorous  
   power.
