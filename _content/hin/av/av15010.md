### HYMN X

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501001">1</span></span>So let the
King, to whose house the Vrātya who possesses this  
   knowledge comes as a guest.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501002">2</span></span>Honour him
as superior to himself. So he Both not act against  
   the interests of his princely rank or his kingdom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501003">3</span></span>From him,
verily, sprang Priesthood and Royalty. They said,  
  Into whom shall we enter?  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501004">4</span></span>Let
Priesthood enter into Brihaspati, and Royalty into Indra,  
   was the answer.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501005">5</span></span>Hence
Priesthood entered into Brihaspati and Royalty into  
  Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501006">6</span></span>Now this
Earth is Brihaspati, and Heaven is Indra.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501007">7</span></span>Now this
Agni is Priesthood, and yonder Sun is Royalty.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501008">8</span></span>Priesthood
comes to him, and he becomes endowed with priestly  
   lustre.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501009">9</span></span>Who knows
that Earth is Brihaspati and Agni Priesthood.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501010">10</span></span>Great power
comes to him and he becomes endowed with great  
   power.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1501011">11</span></span>Who knows
that Āditya is Royalty and that Heaven is Indra.
