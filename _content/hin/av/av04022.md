### HYMN XXII

#### A benediction on a newly consecrated king

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402201">1</span></span>Exalt and
strengthen this my Prince, O Indra, Make him sole  
   lord and leader of the people.  
  Scatter his foes, deliver all his rivals into his hand in struggles  
   for precedence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402202">2</span></span>Give him a
share in village, kine, and horses, and leave his  
   enemy without a portion.  
  Let him as King be head and chief of Princes, Give up to him,  
  O Indra, every foeman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402203">3</span></span>Let him be
treasure-lord of goodly treasures, let him as King be  
   master of the people.  
  Grant unto him great power and might, O Indra, and strip his  
   enemy of strength and vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402204">4</span></span>Like
milch-kine yielding milk for warm libations, pour, Heaven  
   and Earth! on him full many a blessing.  
  May he as King be Indra's well-beloved, the darling of the kine,  
   the plants, the cattle.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402205">5</span></span>I join in
league with thee victorious Indra, with whom men  
   conquer and are ne'er defeated.  
  He shall make thee the folk's sole lord and leader, shall make  
   thee highest of all human rulers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402206">6</span></span>Supreme art
thou, beneath thee are thy rivals, and all, O King,  
   who were thine adversaries.  
  Sole lord and leader and allied with Indra, bring, conqueror, thy  
   foremen's goods and treasures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0402207">7</span></span>Consume,
with lion aspect, all their hamlets, with tiger aspect,  
   drive away thy foemen.  
  Sole lord and leader and allied with Indra, seize, conqueror,  
   thine enemies' possessions.
