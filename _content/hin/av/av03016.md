### HYMN XVI

#### A Rishi's morning prayer

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301601">1</span></span>Agni at
dawn, and Indra we invoke at dawn, and Varuna and  
  Mitra, and the Asvins twain:  
  Bhaga at dawn, Pūshan and Brāhmanaspati, Soma at dawn, and  
  Rudra we invoke at dawn.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301602">2</span></span>We all
strong Bhaga, conqueror in the morning, the son of  
  Aditi, the great Disposer,  
  Whom each who deems himself poor, strong and mighty, a king,  
   addresses thus, Grant thou my portion!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301603">3</span></span>Bhaga, our
guide, Bhaga whose gifts are faithful, favour this  
   hymn and give us wealth, O Bhaga.  
  Bhaga, augment our store of kine and horses. Bhaga, may we be  
   rich in men and heroes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301604">4</span></span>So may
felicity be ours at present, and when the Sun advances,  
   and at noontide;  
  And may we still, O Bounteous One, at sunset be happy in the  
  Gods' protecting favour. <span id="page_a85">p. a85</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301605">5</span></span>May Bhaga
verily be bliss-bestower, and through him, Gods!  
   may happiness attend us.  
  As such with all my might I call and call thee: as such be thou  
   our leader here, O Bhaga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301606">6</span></span>To this our
sacrifice may the Dawns incline them, and come to  
   the pure place like Dadhikrāvan.  
  As strong steeds draw a chariot may they bring me hitherward  
  Bhaga who discovers treasure.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301607">7</span></span>May the kind
Mornings dawn on us for ever with, wealth of  
   kine, of horses, and of heroes.  
  Streaming with all abundance, pouring fatness,  
  Do ye preserve us evermore with blessings!
