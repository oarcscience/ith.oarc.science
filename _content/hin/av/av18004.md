### HYMN IV

#### A funeral hymn, composed partly of verses from the Rigveda

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800401">1</span></span>Rise to your
mother, flames of Jātavedas! I send you up by  
   paths which Fathers traverse.  
  With headlong speed the Oblation bearer bore our gifts: toil ye,  
   and place the offerer where the righteous dwell.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800402">2</span></span>The Seasons,
Deities, form and order Worship, butter, cake,  
   ladles, sacrificial weapons.  
  Tread thou God-travelled paths whereby the righteous, payers  
   of sacrifices, go to Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800403">3</span></span>Carefully
look on Sacrifice's pathway whereon the Angirases,  
   the righteous, travel.  
  By those same pathways go thou up to Svarga where the  
  Ādityas take their fill of sweetness, There make thy home in  
   the third vault of heaven,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800404">4</span></span>Three eagles
in the region's roar are standing high on heaven's  
   ridge in their appointed station.  
  The worlds of Svarga shall, filled full of Amrit, yield food and  
   power to him who sacrificeth. <span id="page_202">p. 202</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800405">5</span></span>Upabhrit
stablished air, Juhū the heaven, Dhruva supported  
   earth securely founded.  
  As meed, the Svarga worlds, o'erspread with fatness shall yield  
   the sacrificer all his wishes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800406">6</span></span>Dhruvā,
ascend thou earth the all sustainer: go thou, O Upa-  
   bhrit, to air's mid-region.  
  Juhu, go skyward with the sacrificer; go, and with Sruva be thy  
   calf beside thee drain all the swelling unreluctant quarters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800407">7</span></span>They ford
the mighty rivers by the pathway which they who  
   sacrifice, the righteous, travel.  
  There they gave room unto the sacrificer when they made regions  
   and existing creatures.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800408">8</span></span>The
Angirases' pathway is the eastern Agni, the Ādityas' path-  
   way is the Gārhapatya:  
  The southward Agni is the way of Southerns.  
  To Agni's greatness whom the prayer divideth go powerful, un-  
   scathed with all thy members.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800409">9</span></span>Eastward let
east fire happily consume thee, and westward  
   happily the Gārhapatya.  
  Burn southern fire, thine armour and protection: from air's-  
   mid-region from the north and centre, on all sides, Agni,  
   guard thou him from horror.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800410">10</span></span>Do ye, with
your most kindly forms, O Agni, waft, turned to  
   rapid steeds whose ribs bear burthens,  
  The sacrificer to the world of Svarga where with the Gods they  
   banquet and are joyful.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800411">11</span></span>Happily
from the rear burn this man, Agni, happily from before,  
   above, and under.  
  One, triply parted, Jātavedas, place him happily in the world  
   that holds the righteous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800412">12</span></span>Happily
lit, let fires, each Jātavedas, seize on Prajāpati's appoint-  
   ed victim.  
  Let them not cast it down while here they cook it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800413">13</span></span>Sacrifice,
duly offered, comes preparing the sacrificer for the.  
   world of Svarga,  
  Let all the fires, each Jatavedas, welcome Prajāpati's completely  
   offered victim.  
  Let them not cast it down while here they cook it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800414">14</span></span>Fain to fly
up from the sky's ridge to heaven, the worshipper  
   hath mounted visible Agni. <span id="page_203">p. 203</span>  
  Lucid from out the mist to him, the pious, gleams the God-  
   travelled path that leads to Svarga.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800415">15</span></span>On thy
right hand let Indra be thy Brāhman, Brihaspati Adh-  
   varyu Agni Hotar.  
  This ordered sacrifice goes offered thither whither presented  
   gifts have gone aforetime.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800416">16</span></span>Enriched
with cake and milk here let the Charu rest.  
  World-makers, makers of the path we worship you of the Gods  
   who here partake oblations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800417">17</span></span>Enriched
with cake and curds, etc. (as in stanza 16).  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800418">18</span></span>Enriched
with cake and drops, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800419">19</span></span>Enriched
with cake and butter, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800420">20</span></span>Enriched
with cake and flesh, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800421">21</span></span>Enriched
with cake and food, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800422">22</span></span>Enriched
with cake and mead, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800423">23</span></span>Enriched
with cake and juice, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800424">24</span></span>Here, mixt
with cake and water rest the Charu!  
  World-makers, makers of the path, we worship those Gods of  
   you who here partake oblations.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800425">25</span></span>Let these
which Gods have held for thee, these beakers covered  
   o'er with cake,  
  Be full of sacred food for thee, distilling fatness, rich in mead.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800426">26</span></span>Grains
which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum, as holy  
   food.  
  May they for thee be excellent and potent. King Yama look on,  
   them as thine with favour!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800427">27</span></span>More
immortality!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800428">28</span></span>On all the
earth, to heaven, the drop descended, on this place  
   and on that which was before it.  
  I offer up, throughout the seven oblations, the drop which still  
   to one same place is moving.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800429">29</span></span>Those who
observe men look on wealth as Vāyu with countless.  
   streams, and as light-finding Arka;  
  Those drain out Guerdon sprung from seven mothers, who satis-  
   fy and evermore give presents.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800430">30</span></span>They for
their weal drain out the cask, the beaker four-holed,.  
   the milch-cow Idā full of sweetness,  
  Injure not, Agni, in the loftiest heaven Aditi heightening strength  
   among the people.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800431">31</span></span>On thee
doth Savitar the God bestow this vesture for thy wear. <span
id="page_204">p. 204</span>  
  Clothe thee herein, and find meet robe in Yama's realm to cover  
   thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800432">32</span></span>The grains
of corn have now become a cow, the Sesamum her  
   calf.  
  He in the realm of Yama lives on her the inexhaustible.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800433">33</span></span>Let these
become thy milch-kine, man! supplying all thy heart's  
   desires.  
  There, speckled, white, like-hued and various-coloured, with  
   calves of Sesamum let them stand beside thee.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800434">34</span></span>Let the
green grains become thy white, and speckled, The dusky  
   corns become thy ruddy milch-kine.  
  Let those with calves of Sesamum for ever yield strength to him  
   and never flinch from milking.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800435">35</span></span>I offer in
Vaisvānara this oblation, thousandfold spring that  
   pours a hundred steamlets.  
  This with a swelling flow supports the Father, supports grand-  
   fathers and their sires before them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800436">36</span></span>Beside the
spring with hundred, thousand currents, expanding  
   on the summit of the water,  
  Exhaustless, yielding strength, never reluctant, the Fathers with  
   their sacred food are seated.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800437">37</span></span>This pile
of wood, collected, heaped together, regard it, O ye,  
   kinsmen, and come near it.  
  To immortality this mortal goeth: prepare a home for him, all  
   ye his kindred.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800438">38</span></span>Be here,
even here, acquiring wealth, here be thou thoughts here  
   be thou strength.  
  Be stronger here in manly power, life-giver, never beaten back.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800439">39</span></span>Giving the
son and grandson satisfaction, let these the present  
  Waters full of sweetness,  
  Pouring forth food and Amrit for the Fathers, refresh both these  
   and those, the Goddess Waters.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800440">40</span></span>40. Waters,
send Agni forward to the Fathers: let them accept the  
   sacrifice I offer.  
  May they who follow Vigour that abideth there send us down  
   wealth with full store of heroes.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800441">41</span></span>Lover of
butter, deathless, him, Oblation-bearer, they inflame.  
  He knoweth well the treasured stores gone to the Fathers, far  
   away. <span id="page_205">p. 205</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800442">42</span></span>The mingled
draught, the mess of rice, the flesh which I present  
   to thee,  
  May these be full of food for thee, distilling fatness, rich in  
   sweets.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800443">43</span></span>Grains
which for thee I scatter, mixt with Sesamum as sacred  
   food,  
  May these for thee be excellent and potent. King Yama look on,  
   them, as thine, with favour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800444">44</span></span>This is the
ancient, this the recent pathway, by which thy sires  
   of olden time departed.  
  They who first travelled it, and they who followed, convey thee  
   to the world where dwell the righteous.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800445">45</span></span>The pious
call Sarasvati: they worship Sarasvati while sacrifice  
   proceedeth.  
  The righteous doers of good deeds invoke her: Sarasvati send  
   bliss to him who giveth!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800446">46</span></span>Approaching
on the south our solemn worship, the Fathers call-  
  Sarasvati to hear them.  
  Sit on this holy grass and be ye joyful: give thou us strengthen-  
   ing food that brings no sickness.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800447">47</span></span>Sarasvati,
who tamest with them, joying in hymns and food, O  
  Goddess, with the Fathers,  
  Here give the Sacrificer growth of riches, a portion, worth a  
   thousand, of refreshment.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800448">48</span></span>As Prithivī
rests on earth, so do I seat thee. May the God Dhātar  
   lengthen our existence.  
  For you may he who parts in turn find treasures, but let the  
  Dead among the Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800449">49</span></span>Depart ye
two: wipe ye away whatever omens of evil fortune  
   here have told you.  
  Go from this man, both Steers, to him who wills it: ye are my  
   joys here by the giver's Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800450">50</span></span>From a good
quarter have we gained this guerdon, gift of this  
   man, strength giving, plenteous milker.  
  Bringing in youth old age unto the living, may she bear these  
   together to the Fathers.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800451">51</span></span>I bring
this clipped grass hither for the Fathers: grass living,.  
   higher, for the Gods I scatter.  
  Mount this, O man, as victim: let the Fathers recognize thee:  
   when thou hast travelled yonder. <span id="page_206">p. 206</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800452">52</span></span>Set on this
grass thou hast become a victim. Fathers shall know  
   thee yonder when they meet thee.  
  Gather thy body, limb by limb, together: I by the power of  
   prayer arrange thy members.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800453">53</span></span>The royal
Parna is the caldrons' cover: strength have we gained,  
   force, power, and might, and vigour.  
  Bestowing length of life upon the living, for long existence  
   through a hundred autumns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800454">54</span></span>The share
of vigour which gave this man being, the stone won  
   lordship over foods that nourish.  
  Hymn this with your oblations, Visvāmitras: may he, may Yama,  
   lengthen our existence.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800455">55</span></span>As the Five
Races of mankind for Yama set apart a house.  
  Even so I set a house apart that greater numbers may be mine.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800456">56</span></span>Take thou
and wear this piece of gold, the gold thy father used  
   to wear.  
  Wipe tenderly the right hand of thy sire who goes away to  
   heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800457">57</span></span>To all, the
living and the dead, all that are born, the worshipful.  
  Let the full brook of fatness run, o'erflowing, with stream of  
   mead.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800458">58</span></span>Far-seeing
he flows on, the Bull, the Lord of hymns, promoter  
   of the Sun, of Days, of Dawns, of Heaven.  
  Breath of the rivers he hath roared into the jars, and through  
   his wisdom entered into Indra's heart.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800459">59</span></span>Let thy
bright smoke envelop thee, spread forth, O Bright One,  
   in the sky.  
  For, Purifier, like the Sun thou shinest with thy radiant glow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800460">60</span></span>Indu is
moving forth to Indra's destined place, and slights not  
   as a friend the promise of his friend.  
  Thou, Soma, comest nigh as bridegroom meets the bride, reach-  
   ing the beaker by a course of hundred paths.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800461">61</span></span>Well have
they eaten and rejoiced: their dear ones have they  
   shaken off.  
  Sages, self-luminous, have praised: we who are youngest  
   supplicate.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800462">62</span></span>Come
hither, Fathers, who deserve the Soma, by the deep path-  
   ways which the Fathers travel.  
  Bestow upon us life and store of children, and favour us with  
   increase of our riches. <span id="page_207">p. 207</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800463">63</span></span>Depart, O
Fathers, ye who merit Soma, by the deep pathways  
   which the Fathers travel;  
  But in a month, rich in fair sons and heroes, come back into  
   our homes to eat oblation.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800464">64</span></span>If Agni
Jātavedas, as he bore you hence to the Fathers' world,  
   hath left one single.  
  Limb of your bodies, here do I restore it. Fathers, rejoice in  
   heaven with all your members!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800465">65</span></span>Meet for
men's praises, Agni Jātavedas was sent as envoy when  
   the day was closing.  
  Thou gavest to the Fathers with oblation. They ate; eat, God,  
   our offered sacrifices.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800466">66</span></span>Here hast
thou left thy heart; O man, as sisters leave their little  
   pet. Do thou, O earth, envelop him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800467">67</span></span>Bright be
to thee those worlds where dwell the Fathers! I seat  
   thee in that sphere which they inhabit.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800468">68</span></span>Thou art
the grass whereon our Fathers seat them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800469">69</span></span>Loosen, O
Varuna, the bond that binds us; loosen the bond  
   above, between, and under.  
  Then under thy protection, O Āditya, may we be sinless and  
   restored to freedom.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800470">70</span></span>From all
those bonds, O Varuna, release us, wherewith a man  
   is bound at length and cross-wise.  
  Then may we live a hundred autumn seasons guarded by thee,  
  O King, by thee protected.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800471">71</span></span>To Agni,
bearer of oblation to the Manes, be Hail! and  
   homage!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800472">72</span></span>To Soma
connected with the Fathers Hail! and homage!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800473">73</span></span>To the
Fathers connected with Soma Hail! and homage!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800474">74</span></span>To Yama
connected with the Fathers Hail! and homage!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800475">75</span></span>To thee, O
Great-grandfather, and those with thee be this cry of  
  Hail  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800476">76</span></span>To thee,
Great-grandfather, and to those with thee be this cry of  
  Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800477">77</span></span>To thee, O
Fathers, be this cry of Hail!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800478">78</span></span>Hail to the
Fathers who inhabit earth!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800479">79</span></span>Hail to the
Fathers who inhabit the firmament!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800480">80</span></span>Hail to the
Fathers who dwell in heaven!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800481">81</span></span>Hail,
Fathers, to your energy! Hail, Fathers, to your sap!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800482">82</span></span>Hail
Father; to your wrath! Hail, Fathers, to your ardour! <span
id="page_208">p. 208</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800483">83</span></span>Hail,
Fathers, to what is awful! Hail to what is terrible in you!'  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800484">84</span></span>Hail,
Fathers, to all that is propitious! Hail to all that is plea-  
   sant in you!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800485">85</span></span>Homage to
you Fathers! Hail to you, Fathers!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800486">86</span></span>All Fathers
who are here, the Fathers here are you: let then-  
    follow you. May ye be the most excellent of these.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800487">87</span></span>All living
fathers who are here are we here: let them follow us.  
  May we be the most excellent of these.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800488">88</span></span>Bright
Agni, we will kindle thee, rich in thy splendour, fading.  
   not.  
  So that this glorious fuel may send forth to heaven its light for  
   thee. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1800489">89</span></span>Within the
waters runs the Moon, the strong-winged Eagle soars.  
   in heaven.  
  Ye Lightnings with your golden wheels, men find not your abid-  
   ing-place. Hear this my call, O Heaven and Earth.
