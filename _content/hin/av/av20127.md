### HYMN CXXVII

#### A hymn in praise of the good Government of King Kaurama

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012701">1</span></span>Listen to
this, ye men, a laud of glorious bounty shall be sung.  
  Thousands sixty, and ninety we, O Kaurama, among the  
  Rusamas have received.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012702">2</span></span>Camels
twice-ten that draw the car, with females by their side,  
   he gave.  
  Fain would the chariot's top bow down escaping from the stroke  
   of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012703">3</span></span>A hundred
chains of gold, ten wreaths, upon thee Rishi he  
   bestowed,  
  And thrice-a-hundred mettled steeds, ten-times-a-thousand cows  
   he gave.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012704">4</span></span>Glut thee, O
Singer, glut thee like a bird on a ripe-fruited tree.  
  Thy lips and tongue move swiftly like the sharp blades of a pair  
   of shears.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012705">5</span></span>Quickly and
willingly like kine forth come the singers and their  
   hymns:  
  Their little maidens are at home, at home they wait upon the  
   cows.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012706">6</span></span>O Singer,
bring thou forth the hymn that findeth cattle, findeth:  
   wealth. <span id="page_364">p. 364</span>  
  Even as an archer aims his shaft address this prayer unto the  
  Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012707">7</span></span>List to
Parikshit's eulogy, the sovran whom all people love,  
  The King who ruleth over all, excelling mortals as a God.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012708">8</span></span>'Mounting
his throne, Parikshit, best of all, hath given us peace  
   and rest,'  
  Saith a Kauravya to his wife as he is ordering his house.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012709">9</span></span>'Which shall
I set before thee, curds, gruel of milk, or barley-  
   brew?'  
  Thus the wife asks her husband in the realm which King  
  Parikshit rules.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012710">10</span></span>Up as it
were to heavenly light springs the ripe corn above the  
   cleft.  
  Happily thrive the people in the land where King Parikshit  
   reigns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012711">11</span></span>Indra hath
waked the bard and said, Rise, wander singing here  
   and there.  
  Praise me, the strong: each pious man will give thee riches in  
   return,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012712">12</span></span>Here, cows!
increase and multiply, here ye, O horses, here, O  
   men.  
  Here, with a thousand rich rewards, doth Pūshan also seat him-  
   self.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012713">13</span></span>O Indra,
let these cows be safe, their master free from injury.  
  Let not the hostile-hearted or the robber have control of them.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_2012714">14</span></span>Oft and
again we glorify the hero with our hymn of praise, with  
   prayer, with our auspicious prayer.  
  Take pleasure in the songs we sing: let evil never fall on us.
