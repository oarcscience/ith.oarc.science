### HYMN XII

#### A prayer to Lightning, against fever, headache, and cough

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101201">1</span></span>Born from
the womb, brought forth from wind and from the  
   cloud, the first red bull comes onward thundering with the  
   rain.  
  Our bodies may he spare who, cleaving, goes straight on; he who,  
   a single force, divides himself in three.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101202">2</span></span>Bending to
thee who clingest to each limb with heat, fain would  
   we worship thee with offered sacrifice,  
  Worship with sacrifice the bends and curves of thee who with a  
   vigorous grasp hast seized on this one's limbs.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101203">3</span></span>Do thou
release this man from headache, free him from cough  
   which has entered into all his limbs and joints.  
  May he, the child of cloud, the offspring of the wind, the whiz-  
   zing lighting, strike the mountains and the trees.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0101204">4</span></span>Well be it
with my upper frame, well be it with my lower parts.  
  With my four limbs let it be well. Let all my body be in health.
