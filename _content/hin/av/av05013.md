### HYMN XIII

#### A charm against snakes

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501301">1</span></span>Varuna, Sage
of heaven, hath given me the gift: with spells of  
   mighty power I draw thy poison out.  
  Dug up, not dug, adherent, I have seized it fast: low hath thy  
   venom sunk like water in the sands.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501302">2</span></span>All the
non-fluid portion of thy venom, I receive in these.  
  I take thy middlemost, thy highest, lowest juice: may it be  
   spent and lest by reason of thy fear.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501303">3</span></span>Strong is my
cry like thunder with the rainy cloud: with power-  
   ful incantation let thy strength be stayed.  
  I, with the men to aid, have seized that juice of his; as light  
   from out the gloom, let Sūrya rise on high  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501304">4</span></span>I with this
eye destroy thine eye, and with this poison conquer  
   thine.  
  Live not, O Snake, but die the death: back go thy venom on  
   thyself.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501305">5</span></span>Listen to
me, Black Snakes and hateful creatures, Lurker-in-  
  Grass, Karait, and Brown, and Spotty,  
  Approach not near the house my friend inhabits: give warning,  
   and rest quiet with your poison.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501306">6</span></span>Even as the
cord that strings the bow, I slacken, as it were, the  
   cars.  
  Of the All-conquering serpent's wrath, of the fierce rage of  
  Black, and Brown, Taimāta, and Apodaka.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501307">7</span></span>And Āligi
and Viligi, their father and the mother too,—  
  What will ye do? Your venomed sap, we know, is utterly  
   powerless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501308">8</span></span>Daughter of
Urugūlā, she-fiend whom the black, skinned mother  
   bare—  
  All female serpents poison who crept swiftly near is impotent.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501309">9</span></span>Dwelling
beside the mountain's slope, the quick-eared porcupine  
   exclaimed:  
  Of all these she-snakes homed in earth the poison is most  
   powerless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0501310">10</span></span>Tābuva or
not Tābuva, thou verily art not Tābuva: poison is  
   killed by Tābuva. <span id="page_a171">p. a171</span>  
  Tastuva or not Tastuva, thou verily art not Tastuva: poison is  
   killed by Tastuva.
