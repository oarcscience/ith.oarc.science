### HYMN V

#### A King's address to an amulet which is to strengthen his authority

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300501">1</span></span>This
Parna-Amulet hath come, strong and destroying with its  
   strength my rivals.  
  The power of the Gods, the plants' sweet essence, may it incite  
   me ceaselessly with vigour.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300502">2</span></span>O
Parna-Amulet, in me set firmly might and opulence.  
  Within the compass of my rule may I be rooted and supreme.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300503">3</span></span>That dear
mysterious Amulet which Gods have set within the  
   tree,  
  May the Gods grant to me to wear together with extended  
   life.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300504">4</span></span>As Indra's
gift, by Varuna instructed, Parna hath come, the  
   mighty strength of Soma:  
  This would I, brightly shining, love and cherish for long life  
   lasting through a hundred autumns.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300505">5</span></span>The
Parna-Charm hath come to me for great security from ill.  
  That I may be exalted, yea, above the wealth of Aryaman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300506">6</span></span>Sagacious
builders of the car, cleaver and skilful artisans,—  
  Make all the men on every side, Parna, obedient to my will  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300507">7</span></span>The kings
and makers of the kings, troop-leaders, masters of the  
   horse,  
  Make all the men on every side, Parna, obedient to my will.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300508">8</span></span>Thou, Parna,
art my body's guard, man kin my birth to me a  
   man.  
  With splendour of the circling year I bind thee on me, Amulet!
