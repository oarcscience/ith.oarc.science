### HYMN II

#### A rifaccimento or recension of I

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300201">1</span></span>May Agni, he
who knows, our envoy, meet them, burning  
   against ill-will and imprecation.  
  May he bewilder our opponent's senses. May Jātavedas smite and  
   make them handless.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300202">2</span></span>This Agni
hath bewildered all the senses that were in your  
   hearts:  
  Now let him blast you from your home, blast you away from  
   every side.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300203">3</span></span>Dazing their
senses, Indra, come hitherward with the wish and  
   will.  
  With Agni's, Vāta's furious rush drive them to every side away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300204">4</span></span>Vanish, ye
hopes and plans of theirs, be ye confounded, all their  
   thoughts!  
  Whatever wish is in their heart, do thou expel it utterly.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300205">5</span></span>Bewildering
the senses of our foemen, seize on their bodies and  
   depart, O Apvā!  
  Go meet them, flame within their hearts and burn them. Smite  
   thou the foes with darkness and amazement.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0300206">6</span></span>That army of
our enemies, O Maruts, that comes against us with'  
   its might, contending—  
  Meet ye and strike it with unwelcome darkness so that not one.  
   of them may know another.
