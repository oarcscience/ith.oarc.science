### HYMN XII

#### A prayer for vengeance on a malicious rival worshipper

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201201">1</span></span>The spacious
Firmament, and Earth and Heaven, the Field's  
  Queen, and the wonderful Wide-Strider,  
  Yea, the broad middle air which Vāta guardeth, may these now  
   burn with heat while I am burning.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201202">2</span></span>Listen to
this, ye Gods who merit worship. Hymns here are sung  
   for me by Bharadvāja.  
  Bound in the noose may he be doomed to trouble whoever mars  
   this that our mind hath purposed.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201203">3</span></span>Hear this my
call, O Indra, Soma-drinker, as with a burning  
   heart I oft invoke thee.  
  I smite, as 'twere a tree felled with a hatchet, the man who  
   marreth this my plan and purpose.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201204">4</span></span>Together
with thrice-eighty Sāma-singers, Angirases, and Vasus,  
   and Ādityas,  
  May the felicity of the Fathers guard us. I seize that man with  
   fire that Gods have kindled. <span id="page_a45">p. a45</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201205">5</span></span>O Heaven and
Earth, regard me with your favour, and, all ye  
  Gods, stand on my side and help me.  
  Angirases, Fathers worthy of the Soma! woe fall on him who,  
   caused the hateful outrage!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201206">6</span></span>Whoever
either scorns us, O ye Maruts, or blames devotion  
   which we now are paying.  
  Let his own wicked deeds be fires to burn him. May Heaven  
   consume the man who hates devotion.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201207">7</span></span>Thy
sevenfold vital breath, thine eight marrows I rend away  
   with prayer.  
  With Agni as thine envoy, go, prepared, to Yama's dwelling  
   place.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0201208">8</span></span>In Jātavedas
kindled flame I set the place assigned to thee.  
  Let fire consume thy body, and thy voice go to the general  
   breath.
