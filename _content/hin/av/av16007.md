### HYMN VII

#### An imprecation on an enemy

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600701">1</span></span>Herewith I
pierce this man. With poverty I pierce him. With  
   disappearance I pierce him. With defeat I pierce him. With  
  Grāhi I pierce him. With darkness I pierce him.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600702">2</span></span>I summon him
with the awful cruel orders of the Gods.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600703">3</span></span>I place him
between Vaisvānara's jaws.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600704">4</span></span>Thus or
otherwise let her swallow him up.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600705">5</span></span>Him who
hates us may his soul hate, and may he whom we  
   hate hate himself.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600706">6</span></span>We scorch
out of heaven and earth and firmament the man who  
   hates us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600707">7</span></span>Suyāman son
of Chakshus.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600708">8</span></span>Here I wipe
away the evil dream on the descendant of Such-an-  
   one, son of Such-a-woman.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600709">9</span></span>Whatsoever I
have met with, whether at dusk or during early  
   night,  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600710">10</span></span>Whether
waking or sleeping, whether by day or by night.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600711">11</span></span>Whether I
meet with it day by day, from that do I bribe him  
   away.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600712">12</span></span>Slay him;
rejoice in this; crush his ribs.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_1600713">13</span></span>Let him not
live. Let the breath of life forsake him.
