### HYMN LXXIII

#### An invitation to the Asvins

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707301">1</span></span>Inflamed is
Agni, Heroes! charioteer of heaven. The caldron  
   boils: the meath is drained to be your food.  
  For we, O Asvins, singers sprung from many a house, invite you  
   to be present at our banquetings. <span id="page_a301">p.
a301</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707302">2</span></span>Asvins, the
fire is all aglow: your caldron hath been heated;.  
   come!  
  Here, even now, O Heroes, are the milch-kine milked. The  
   priests, ye mighty ones! rejoice.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707303">3</span></span>Pure with
the Gods is sacrifice with cry of Hail! That is the  
  Asvins' cup whence Gods are wont to drink.  
  Yea, the Immortal Ones accept it, one and all, and come to kiss  
   that cup with the Gandharva's mouth.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707304">4</span></span>Milk, molten
butter offered when the mornings break,—this is  
   your portion, Asvins! Come ye hitherward.  
  Lords of the brave, balm-lovers, guards of sacrifice, drink ye the  
   warm libation in the light of heaven.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707305">5</span></span>Let the warm
drink approach you with its Hotar-priest: let the  
  Adhvaryu come to you with store of milk.  
  Come, O ye Asvins, taste the meath that hath been drained,  
   drink of the milk provided by this radiant cow.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707306">6</span></span>Come hither,
quickly come, thou milker of the kine; into the  
   caldron pour milk of the radiant cow.  
  Most precious Savitar hath looked upon the heaven. After  
  Dawn's going-forth he sends his light abroad.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707307">7</span></span>I invocate
this milch-cow good for milking, so that the milker,  
   deft of hand, may milk her.  
  May Savitar give goodliest stimulation. The caldron hath been  
   warmed. Let him proclaim it.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707308">8</span></span>She, sovran
of all treasures, is come hither yearning in spirit for  
   her calf, and lowing.  
  May this cow yield her milk for both the Asvins, and may she  
   prosper to our great advantage.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707309">9</span></span>As dear
house-friend, guest welcome in the dwelling, to this our  
   sacrifice come thou who knowest.  
  And, Agni, having scattered all assailants, bring to us the posses-  
   sions of our foemen.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707310">10</span></span>Show
thyself strong for mighty bliss, O Agni! Most excellent be  
   thine effulgent splendours!  
  Make easy to maintain our household lordship, and overcome  
   the might of those who hate us.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0707311">11</span></span>Fortunate
mayst thou be with goodly pasture, and may we also  
   be exceeding wealthy.  
  Feed on the grass, O Cow, at every season, and, coming hither,  
   drink the limpid water.
