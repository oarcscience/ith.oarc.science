### HYMN XVIII

#### A jealous wife's incantation against a rival

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301801">1</span></span>From out the
earth I dig this Plant, and herb of most effectual  
   power,  
  Wherewith one quells the rival wife and gains the husband for  
   one's self.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301802">2</span></span>Auspicious,
with expanded leaves, sent by the Gods, victorious  
  Plant,  
  Drive thou, the rival wife away, and make my husband only  
   mine.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301803">3</span></span>Indeed he
hath not named her name: thou with this husband  
   dalliest not,  
  Far into distance most remote we drive the rival wife away. <span
id="page_a88">p. a88</span>  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301804">4</span></span>Stronger am
I, O stronger one, yea, mightier than the mightier;  
  Beneath me be my rival wife, down, lower than the lowest  
   dames!  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301805">5</span></span>I am the
conqueror, and thou, thou also art victorious:  
  As victory attends us both we will subdue my fellowwife.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0301806">6</span></span>I've girt
thee with the conquering Plant, beneath thee laid the  
   mightiest one.  
  As a cow hastens to her calf, so let thy spirit speed to me,  
   hasten like water on its way.
