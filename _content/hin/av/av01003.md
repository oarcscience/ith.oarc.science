### HYMN III

#### A charm against constipation and suppression of urine

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100301">1</span></span>We know the
father of the shaft, Parjanya strong with hundred  
   powers:  
  By this may I bring health unto thy body: let the channels pour  
   their burthen freely as of old.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100302">2</span></span>We know the
father of the shaft, Mitra, the Lord of hundred  
   powers:  
  By this, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100303">3</span></span>We know the
father of the shaft, Varuna, strong with hundred  
   powers: <span id="page_a4">p. a4</span>  
  By this, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100304">4</span></span>We know the

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100305">5</span></span>We know the
father of the shaft, the Sun endowed with hundred  
   powers:  
  By this may I bring health unto thy body: let the channels pour  
   their burthen freely as of old.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100306">6</span></span>Whate'er
hath gathered, as it flowed, in bowels, bladder, or in  
   groins,  
  Thus let the conduit, free from check, pour all its burthen as of  
   old.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100307">7</span></span>I lay the
passage open as one cleaves the dam that bars the  
   lake:  
  Thus let, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100308">8</span></span>Now hath the
portal been unclosed as, of the sea that holds the  
   flood:  
  Thus let, etc.  
<span class="margnote"><span id="an_0100309">9</span></span>Even as the
arrow flies away when loosened from the archer's  
   bow,  
  Thus let the burthen be discharged from channels that are checked  
   no more.
