<p>1. If, untired, he performs three suppressions of his breath according to the rule, the sins which he committed during a day and a night are instantly destroyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_679"></A><A HREF="#fn_679"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. Seated during the evening prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions of his breath all guilt which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_680"></A><A HREF="#fn_680"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>he incurred during the day by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.</p>  
<p>3. But standing during the morning prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions of his breath all guilt which he incurred during the night by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.</p>  
<p>4. But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied by (the recitation of) the Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis and the syllable Om, repeated daily, purify after a month even the slayer of a learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_681"></A><A HREF="#fn_681"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. Even a drinker of spirituous liquor becomes pure, if he mutters the (hymn seen) by Kutsa, 'Apa na<I>h</I> sosu<I>k</I>ad agham,' and (the hymn seen) by Vasish<I>th</I>a (which begins with the word) 'Prati,' the M&acirc;hitra (hymn), and the <I>S</I>uddhavat&icirc;s.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_682"></A><A HREF="#fn_682"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. Even he who has stolen gold becomes instantly free from guilt, if he once mutters (the hymn beginning with the words) 'Asya v&acirc;masya' and the <I>S</I>ivasa<I>m</I>kalpa.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_683"></A><A HREF="#fn_683"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. The violator of a Guru's bed is freed (from sin) if he repeatedly recites the (hymn beginning) 'Havish p&acirc;ntam a<I>g</I>aram' and that (beginning) 'Na tam a<I>m</I>ha<I>h</I>' and mutters the hymn addressed to Purusha.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. Or plunging into water he may thrice mutter the Aghamarsha<I>n</I>a. Manu has declared that the (effect is the) same as if he had gone to bathe at a horse-sacrifice.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. An offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more efficacious than a sacrifice at which animals are killed; a (prayer) which is inaudible (to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the mental (recitation of sacred texts) one thousand times.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. The four P&acirc;kaya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as and those sacrifices which are enjoined by the rules of the Veda are all together not equal in value to the sixteenth part of a sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>11. But, undoubtedly, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a reaches the highest goal by muttering prayers only; whether he perform other (rites) or neglect them, he is called a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who befriends all creatures (maitra).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. The sins of those who are intent on muttering prayers, of those who offer burnt-oblations, of those who are given to meditation, of those who reside in sacred places, and of those who have bathed after performing the vows called <I>S</I>iras, do not remain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. As a fire, fanned by wind, burns brighter, and (as its flame grows) through offerings (of butter), even so a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who is daily engaged in</p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_129"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 129</FONT></A></p>  
<p>muttering sacred texts shines with a brilliant lustre.</p>  
<p>14. The destruction of those who fulfil the duty of daily study, who constantly restrain themselves, who mutter prayers and offer sacrifices has never been known (to happen).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. Let him who is desirous of purification repeat, though he be charged with all sins, the divine (G&acirc;yatr&icirc;), at the most one thousand times, or one hundred times as a medium (penance), or at least ten times (for trivial faults).</p>  
<p>16. A Kshatriya shall pass through misfortunes which have befallen him by the strength of his arms, a Vai<I>s</I>ya and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra by their wealth, the highest among twice-born men by muttered prayers and burnt-oblations.</p>  
<p>17. As horses (are useless) without a chariot, as chariots (are useless) without horses, even so austerity (is useless) to him who is destitute of sacred learning, and sacred learning to him who practises no austerities.</p>  
<p>18. As food mixed with honey, or honey mixed with food, even so are austerities and learning, joined together, a powerful medicine.</p>  
<p>19. No guilt taints a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who possesses learning, practises austerities, and daily mutters sacred texts, though he may constantly commit sinful acts.</p>
