three days) food given without

asking, and to fast during the last three days. That is an
Atik*rikkh*ra.

3\. A K*rikkh*ra penance (during the performance of which one) subsists
on water (only is called) a K*rikkh*râtik*rikkh*ra. <span

4\. The peculiar observances (prescribed during the performance) of
K*rikkh*ra penances (are as follows): <span

5\. 'Having cut his nails, (the performer) shall cause his beard and all
his hair to be shaved off, excepting the eyebrows, the eyelashes, and
the lock at the top of the head; (wear) one garment only; he shall eat
blameless food; what one obtains by going to beg once (is called)
blameless food; he shall bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the
evening; he shall carry a stick (and) a waterpot; he shall avoid to
speak to women and *S*ûdras; carefully keeping himself in an upright or
sitting posture, he shall stand during the day, and remain seated during
the night.' Thus speaks the divine Vasish*th*a.

6\. Let him not instruct in these Institutes of the sacred law anybody
but his son or a pupil who stays (in his house at least) for a
year. <span id="fr_673"></span>[6](#fn_673)

7\. The fee (for teaching it) is one thousand (pa*n*as), (or) ten cows
and a bull, or the worship of the teacher.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[124:6](sbe1427.htm#fr_673) The MSS. read in
the beginning of this Sûtra, satayânudeti or satayâtudeta, while
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, probably as a guess, writes satapâ nudati. I do
not think that his correction is satisfactory, and propose in its stead,
sa tadyadetad (dharma*s*âstram).
