# VASISH*TH*A.

### CHAPTER I.

1\. Now, therefore, the desire to know the sacred law for their welfare
(should arise) in (initiated) men. <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56)

2\. He who knows and follows the (sacred law is called) a righteous man.

3\. He becomes most worthy of praise in this world and after death gains
heaven. <span id="fr_57"></span>[3](#fn_57)

4\. The sacred law has been settled by the revealed texts and by the
tradition (of the sages).

5\. On failure of (rules given in) these (two sources) the practice of
the *S*ish*t*as (has) authority.

6\. But he whose heart is free from desire (is called) a *S*ish*t*a.

7\. (Acts sanctioned by) the sacred law (are those) for which no
(worldly) cause is perceptible. <span id="fr_58"></span>[7](#fn_58)

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

8\. The country of the Âryas (Âryâvarta) lies to the east of the region
where (the river Sarasvatî) disappears, to the west of the Black-forest,
to the north of the Pâripâtra (mountains), to the south of the
Himâlaya. <span id="fr_59"></span>[8](#fn_59)

9\. (According to others it lies to the south of the Himâlaya) and to
the north of the Vindhya range (being limited east and west by the two
oceans). <span id="fr_60"></span>[9](#fn_60)

10\. Acts productive of spiritual merit, and customs which (are approved
of) in that country, must be everywhere acknowledged (as authoritative);

11\. But not different ones, (i.e. those) of (countries where) laws
opposed (to those of Âryâvarta prevail). <span
id="fr_61"></span>[11](#fn_61)

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

12\. Some (declare the country of the Âryas to be situated) between the
(rivers) Gaṅgâ and Yamunâ. <span id="fr_62"></span>[12](#fn_62)

13\. Others (state as) an alternative, that spiritual pre-eminence (is
found) as far as the black antelope grazes. <span
id="fr_63"></span>[13](#fn_63)

14\. Now the Bhâllavins quote also (the following) verse in the
Nidâna: <span id="fr_64"></span>[14](#fn_64)

15\. 'In the west the boundary-river, in the east <span
id="fr_65"></span>[15](#fn_65)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

the region where the sun rises,--as far as the black antelope wanders
(between these two limits), so far spiritual pre-eminence (is found).

16\. 'Those religious acts which men, deeply versed in the knowledge of
the three Vedas and acquainted with the sacred law, declare to be
lawful, (are efficient) for purifying oneself and others.' <span
id="fr_66"></span>[16](#fn_66)

17\. Manu has declared that the (peculiar) laws of countries, castes,
and families (may be followed) in the absence of (rules of) the revealed
texts. <span id="fr_67"></span>[17](#fn_67)

18\. Sinful men are, he who sleeps at sunrise or at sunset, he who has
deformed nails or black teeth, he whose younger brother was married
first, he who married before his elder brother, the husband of a younger
sister married before the elder, the husband of an elder sister whose
younger sister was married first, he who extinguishes the sacred fires,
(and) he who forgets the Veda through neglect of the daily
recitation. <span id="fr_68"></span>[18](#fn_68)

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

19\. They state that there are five mortal sins. (mahâpâtaka),

20\. (Viz. violating) a Guru's bed, drinking (the spirituous liquor
called) surâ, slaying a learned Brâhma*n*a, stealing the gold of a
Brâhma*n*a, and associating with outcasts, <span
id="fr_69"></span>[20](#fn_69)

21\. Either by (entering into) spiritual or matrimonial (connexion with
them). <span id="fr_70"></span>[21](#fn_70)

22\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who during a year
associates with an outcast becomes (likewise) an outcast; not by
sacrificing for him, by teaching him or by (forming) a matrimonial
(alliance with him), but by using the same carriage or seat.' <span
id="fr_71"></span>[22](#fn_71)

23\. A minor offence causing loss of caste (ûpapâtaka, is committed by
him) who (after beginning an Agnihotra sacrifice) forsakes the sacred
fires, and by him who offends a Guru, by an atheist, by him who takes
his livelihood from atheists, and by him who sells the Soma
(plant). <span id="fr_72"></span>[23](#fn_72)

24\. Three wives (are permitted) to a Brâhma*n*a according to the order
of the castes, two to a Kshatriya, one to a Vai*s*ya and to a
*S*ûdra. <span id="fr_73"></span>[24](#fn_73)

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

25\. Some declare (that twice-born men may marry) even a female of the
*S*ûdra caste, like those (other wives), without (the recitation of)
Vedic texts.

26\. Let him not act thus. <span id="fr_74"></span>[26](#fn_74)

27\. For in consequence of such (a marriage) the degradation of the
family certainly ensues, and after death the loss of heaven.

28\. There are six marriage-rites, <span id="fr_75"></span>[28](#fn_75)

29\. (Viz.) that of Brahman (brâhma), that of the gods (daiva), that of
the *Ri*shis (ârsha), that of the Gandharvas (gândharva), that of the
Kshatriyas (kshâtra), and that of men (mânusha).

30\. If the father, pouring out a libation of water, gives his
(daughter) to a suitor, that (is called) the Brahma-rite <span
id="fr_76"></span>[30](#fn_76)

31\. If (the father) gives his daughter, decking her with ornaments, to
an officiating priest, whilst a sacrifice is being performed, that is
called the Daiva-rite. <span id="fr_77"></span>[31](#fn_77)

32\. And (if the father gives his daughter) for a cow and a bull, (that
is called) the Ârsha-rite. <span id="fr_78"></span>[32](#fn_78)

33\. If a lover takes a loving female of equal caste, that (is called)
the Gândharva-rite. <span id="fr_79"></span>[33](#fn_79)

34\. If they forcibly abduct (a damsel), destroying (her relatives) by
strength (of arms), that (is called) the Kshâtra-rite. <span
id="fr_80"></span>[34](#fn_80)

35\. If, after making a bargain (with the father, a <span
id="fr_81"></span>[35](#fn_81)

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

suitor) marries (a damsel) purchased for money, that (is called) the
Mânusha-rite.

36\. The purchase (of a wife) is mentioned in the following passage of
the Veda, 'Therefore one hundred (cows) besides a chariot should be
given to the father of the bride.' <span id="fr_82"></span>[36](#fn_82)

37\. (It is stated) in (the following passage of) the *K*âturmâsyas,
'She (forsooth) who has been bought by her husband (commits sin, as)
afterwards she unites herself with strangers.' <span
id="fr_83"></span>[37](#fn_83)

38\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Lost learning comes
back; when the family is lost all is lost. Even a horse becomes
estimable on account of its pedigree; therefore men marry wives
descended from an (unblemished) family.

39\. The three (lower) castes shall live according to the teaching of
the Brâhma*n*a. <span id="fr_84"></span>[39](#fn_84)

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

40\. The Brâhma*n*a shall declare their duties,

41\. And the king shall govern them accordingly.

42\. But a king who rules in accordance with the sacred law, may take
the sixth part of the wealth (of his subjects), <span
id="fr_85"></span>[42](#fn_85)

43\. Except from Brâhma*n*as. <span id="fr_86"></span>[43](#fn_86)

44\. It has been declared in the Veda, 'But he obtains the sixth part of
(the merit which Brâhma*n*as gain by) sacrifices and charitable
works.' <span id="fr_87"></span>[44](#fn_87)

45\. (It is further stated in the Veda), 'The Brâhma*n*a makes the Veda
rich; the Brâhma*n*a saves from misfortune; therefore the Brâhma*n*a
shall not be made a source of subsistence. Soma is his king.' <span
id="fr_88"></span>[45](#fn_88)

46\. Further (another passage says), 'After death bliss (awaits the king
who does not oppress Brâhma*n*as).'

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_56"></span>[1:1](sbe1404.htm#fr_56) **1**. The word 'now'
serves, in this as in analogous cases, various purposes. It marks the
beginning of the book, serves as an auspicious invocation (maṅgala), and
indicates that something else, the initiation, must precede the study of
the sacred law. 'Therefore' means 'because, after initiation, the
neophyte is to be taught the prescribed rules regarding personal
purification:--K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita. For the wording of the Sûtra
compare the be-ginning of *G*aimini's Mîmâ*m*sâ-sûtras.

<span id="fn_57"></span>[1:3](sbe1404.htm#fr_57)-6. Gautama I, 1-4;
XXVIII, 48.

<span id="fn_58"></span>[1:7](sbe1404.htm#fr_58) The Sûtra contains a
limitation of Sûtra 5. It indicates that the customs of the *S*ish*t*as,
for which worldly motives are perceptible, have no authority, and are
not to be followed. The principle enunciated is one inculcated by the
Mîmâ*m*sakas (P: M. S. <span id="page_2">p. 2</span> I, 3, 3-4). See
also Âpastamba I, 1, 4, 5-10; I, 4, 12, 8; and Introduction, p. xxvii.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita has misunderstood the Sûtra. He reads, against the
MSS., ag*ri*hyamâ*n*akâra*n*o ’dharma*h*, 'unlawful acts are those for
which no motive, i.e. no sacred source such as the Vedas, is
perceptible.'

<span id="fn_59"></span>[2:8](sbe1404.htm#fr_59) The region where the
river Sarasvatî disappears is the Pattiâlâ district in the Pa*ñg*âb. The
Pâripâtra mountains belong to the great Vindhya range, and are probably
the hills in Mâlvâ. The position of the Kâlakavana or Black-forest is
not accurately known. But it must probably be sought in Bihâr. All the
MSS. as well as K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita read in this Sûtra prâgâdar*s*anât
instead of prâgadar*s*anât, 'to the east of the region where the river
Sarasvatî disappears.' This circumstance gains some importance by the
fact that the Mahâbhâshya on Pâ*n*ini II, 4, 10, quotes the same
definition of the Âryâvarta, giving, however, instead of adar*s*anât
prâgâdar*s*ât, 'to the east of Âdar*s*a, i.e. the Âdar*s*a mountains.'
It seems to me not improbable that our Sûtra, too, had originally
prâgâdar*s*ât, and that some Pa*nd*it who knew nothing about the
Âdar*s*a hills, but remembered Manu II, as, and Baudhâyana I, 1, 25,
where the word vina*s*anât, 'the disappearance of the Sarasvatî,'
undoubtedly occurs, added the syllable na and forgot to correct the â,
after prâg.

<span id="fn_60"></span>[2:9](sbe1404.htm#fr_60) The translation follows
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's commentary, which recommends itself on account of
the analogous definition of Âryâvarta given by Manu II, 22.

<span id="fn_61"></span>[2:11](sbe1404.htm#fr_61) My translation follows
the text given by K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita and <span id="page_3">p. 3</span>
B., and the explanation of the former, because it seems to me that the
general sense which they give, is the correct one. I feel, however, not
certain that the word. pratilomakadharmâ*n*âm, 'of those countries where
opposite laws prevail,' is more than a care less correction. The
majority of the MSS. read pratilomakakshadharmâ*n*a*h*
(kalpadharmâ*n*a*h*), which by itself is difficult of explanation. But,
as the text of the next Sûtra contains an apparently superfluous phrase,
I fear, we shall have to admit that the text is here disfigured by
corruptions, which with our present MSS. it is impossible to remove with
certainty.

<span id="fn_62"></span>[3:12](sbe1404.htm#fr_62) K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita
reads this Sutra 'etad âryâvartam ityâ*k*akshate gaṅgâyamunayor
antaretyeke,' and takes it as one sentence, the subject of which is
'eke.' I feel no doubt that this explanation is utterly untenable, and
that the first four words have nothing to do with this Sutra, the second
part of which occurs also in the Baudhâyana Dharma-sûtra I, 1, 27. My
opinion is that they originally belonged to Sûtra 11, though the state
of the MSS. at my disposal does not allow me to say how Sûtra 11 has to
be corrected. The general sense of Sûtra 12 is, however, perfectly
certain.

<span id="fn_63"></span>[3:13](sbe1404.htm#fr_63) Manu II, 23;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 2. It deserves to be noted that the black antelope
(black-buck), Oryx cervicapra, selects for its home the well-cultivated,
rich plains of India only, and is entirely wanting in the sandy,
mountainous or forest districts, which are now, just as in ancient
times, the portion of the aboriginal tribes.

<span id="fn_64"></span>[3:14](sbe1404.htm#fr_64) Regarding the
Bhâllavins, see Max Müller, History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature, pp.
193, 364. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita thinks that Nidâna means de*s*anir*n*aya,
'the disquisition on the countries,' which is the title of a section
which occurs in most modern compilations on law. But it will be safer to
take it as the name of a Vedic work, identical with or similar to that
quoted in *S*aunaka's B*ri*haddevatâ, Weber, Hist. Ind. Lit., p. 81.

<span id="fn_65"></span>[3:15](sbe1404.htm#fr_65) Sindhur vidhâra*n*î or
vidhara*n*î, as B. reads, cannot be <span id="page_4">p. 4</span> taken
with K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, as 'the ocean,' because in the latter sense
sindhu is a masculine. It must be a boundary-river, probably the
Sarasvatî. By sûryasyodana, 'the region where the sun rises,' the
udayagiri or 'mountain of the east' may possibly be meant.

<span id="fn_66"></span>[4:16](sbe1404.htm#fr_66) This verse, too, is
marked as a quotation by the concluding word iti, though it is not
necessary that it should be taken as a quotation from the Nidâna. Here,
and in the sequel verses ending in iti are marked as quotations by
hyphens.

<span id="fn_67"></span>[4:17](sbe1404.htm#fr_67) Manu VII, 203; VIII,
41; Gautama XI, 20. *G*âti,' castes,' which sometimes, and perhaps as
appropriately, has been translated by 'tribes,' denotes in my opinion
those numerous subdivisions of the four great var*n*as, which we now
find all over India, and which can be shown to have existed for a very
long time. Usually the word 'caste' is also applied to them.

<span id="fn_68"></span>[4:18](sbe1404.htm#fr_68) K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita
explains vîrahâ, 'he who extinguishes the sacred fires,' by 'the
destroyer of his sons or of his spiritual clients' <span id="page_5">p.
5</span> (ya*g*amâna); but the rules given below, XX, 11, and XXI, 27,
in the section on penances, confirm the explanation given above.

<span id="fn_69"></span>[5:20](sbe1404.htm#fr_69) Vish*n*u XXXV, 1-2.
Guru means here the father, see below, XX, 15.

<span id="fn_70"></span>[5:21](sbe1404.htm#fr_70) Vish*n*u XXXV, 3-5.
Spiritual connexion, i.e. becoming the teacher or priest of an outcast,
or his pupil or spiritual client (ya*g*amâna).

<span id="fn_71"></span>[5:22](sbe1404.htm#fr_71) Identical with Manu
XI, 181. It must be understood that spiritual or matrimonial connexion
with an outcast causes immediate degradation, as Vish*n*u states
expressly.

<span id="fn_72"></span>[5:23](sbe1404.htm#fr_72) Vish*n*u XXXVII, 6,
31; Gautama XXI, 11. Regarding the precise meaning of prati*g*ahnuyât,
'offends,' see below, XXI, 27.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[5:24](sbe1404.htm#fr_73)-25. Manu III, 13;
Yâ*gñ*avalkya I, 57; Pâraskara G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 4, 8-11.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[6:26](sbe1404.htm#fr_74)-27. Manu III, 14-19.

<span id="fn_75"></span>[6:28](sbe1404.htm#fr_75) Âpastamba II, 5, II,
17-20.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[6:30](sbe1404.htm#fr_76) Vish*n*u XXIV, 19;
Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 6, 1.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[6:31](sbe1404.htm#fr_77) Vish*n*u XXIV, 20;
Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya.-sûtra I, 6, 2,

<span id="fn_78"></span>[6:32](sbe1404.htm#fr_78) Vish*n*u XXIV, 21;

<span id="fn_79"></span>[6:33](sbe1404.htm#fr_79) Vish*n*u XXIV, 23;
Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 6, 5.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[6:34](sbe1404.htm#fr_80) Vish*n*u XXIV, 25;
Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 6, 8.

<span id="fn_81"></span>[6:35](sbe1404.htm#fr_81) Vish*n*u XXIV, 24;
Â*s*valâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 6, 6.

<span id="fn_82"></span>[7:36](sbe1404.htm#fr_82) *S*âṅkhâyana
G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 14; Pâraskara G*ri*hya-sûtra I, 8, 18; Âpastamba II,
6, 13, 12. Though Vasish*th*a's quotation is less complete than
Âpastamba's, still the following Sûtras show that he knew the conclusion
of the passage, and does not take it as an authority for the sale of a
daughter.

<span id="fn_83"></span>[7:37](sbe1404.htm#fr_83) K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita
makes a mistake by connecting the word '*k*âturmâsyeshu' with the next
Sûtra. He is right in saying that 'the *K*âturmâsyas' is the name of a
book. It is, however, not a separate work, but the kâ*nd*a or section of
a Vedic work treating of the *K*âturmâsya sacrifices (see Max Müller,
Hist. Anc. Sansk. Lit., p. 355). The particular work from which our
quotation has been taken, is either the Maitrâyâ*n*îya Sa*m*hitâ, or the
Kâ*th*aka. For, as Dr. von Schroeder informs me, Maitrâyâ*n*îya
Sa*m*hitâ I, 10, 11 reads 'an*ri*ta*m* vâ eshâ karoti yâ patyu*h* krîtâ
satyathânyai*s* *k*arati,' and the title of the kâ*nd*a is
*K*âturmâsyâni. Professor Weber, Ind. Stud. V, 407, has found the same
words in the *K*âturmâsya section of the Kâ*th*aka XXXVI, 5. In the
translation I have added the beginning of the passage which Vasish*th*a
omits, according to the Maitrâyâ*n*îya Sa*m*hitâ.

<span id="fn_84"></span>[7:39](sbe1404.htm#fr_84)-41. Gautama XI, 25-27.

<span id="fn_85"></span>[8:42](sbe1404.htm#fr_85) Vish*n*u III, 22-25.
Though the ambiguous word dhana, 'wealth,' is used in the text, it seems
not doubtful that Vasish*th*a alludes to the land-tax, which generally
consists of one sixth of the produce.

<span id="fn_86"></span>[8:43](sbe1404.htm#fr_86) Vish*n*u III, 26.

<span id="fn_87"></span>[8:44](sbe1404.htm#fr_87) Vish*n*u III, 27--28.
Pûrta, 'the merit gained by charitable works,' i.e. by planting trees,
digging wells, and so forth. The words 'iti ha,' placed at the end of
the Sûtra, indicate that it is a quotation, and that vi*gñ*âyate, 'it is
declared in the Veda,' has to be understood from Sûtra 46. Gautama XI,
11, too, alleges that the rule is based on a Vedic passage.

<span id="fn_88"></span>[8:45](sbe1404.htm#fr_88) *S*atapatha-brâhma*n*a
V, 4, 2, 3. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's division of the quotation into
several Sûtras is unnecessary. His explanation of anâdya, which he takes
to mean 'the first of all,' is wrong. He asserts that the Brâhma*n*a is
said 'to make the Veda rich,' because by sacrificing and so forth he
fulfils its object and protects it. But the phrase is probably corrupt.
If it is said that Soma is the king of the Brâhma*n*as, the object is to
indicate that an earthly king is not their master, see Gautama XI, 1.
