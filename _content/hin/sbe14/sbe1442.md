### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 5, KA*ND*IKÂ 9.

1\. The Veda declares that the hand of an artisan is always pure, so is
every vendible commodity exposed for sale and food obtained by begging,
which a student holds in. his hand. <span

2\. A calf is pure on the flowing (of the milk), a bird on the fall of
the fruit, women at the time of dalliance, and a dog when he catches a
deer. <span id="fr_857"></span>[2](#fn_857)

3\. All mines and places of manufacture are pure excepting distilleries
of spirituous liquor; continuously flowing streams of water and dust
raised by the wind cannot be contaminated. <span
id="fr_858"></span>[3](#fn_858)

4\. The flowers and fruit of flowering and fruit-bearing trees which
grow in unclean places are likewise not impure.

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

5\. On touching a tree standing on a sacred spot, a funeral pile, a
sacrificial post, a *K*a*nd*âla or a person who sells the Veda, a
Brâhma*n*a shall bathe dressed in his clothes. <span
id="fr_859"></span>[5](#fn_859)

6\. One's own couch, seat, clothes, wife, child, and waterpot are pure
for oneself; but for strangers they are impure.

7\. A seat, a couch, a vehicle, ships (and boats), the road and grass
are purified by the wind, if they have been touched by *K*a*nd*âlas or
outcasts. <span id="fr_860"></span>[7](#fn_860)

8\. Grain on the threshing-floor, water in wells and reservoirs, and
milk in the cowpen are fit for use even (if they come) from a person
whose food must not be eaten. <span id="fr_861"></span>[8](#fn_861)

9\. The gods created for Brâhma*n*as three means of purification, (viz.)
ignorance of defilement, sprinkling with water, and commending by word
of mouth. <span id="fr_862"></span>[9](#fn_862)

10\. Water collected on the ground with which <span
id="fr_863"></span>[10](#fn_863)

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

cows slake their thirst is a means of purification, provided it is not
strongly mixed with unclean (substances), nor has a (bad) smell, nor is
discoloured, nor has a (bad) taste.

11\. But land becomes pure, according to the degree of the defilement,
by sweeping the (defiled) spot, by sprinkling it with water, by smearing
it with cowdung, by scattering (pure earth) on it, or by scraping
it. <span id="fr_864"></span>[11](#fn_864)

12\. Now they quote also (the following verse):

<span id="fn_856"></span>[170:1](sbe1442.htm#fr_856) **9**. Vish*n*u
XXIII, 48.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[170:2](sbe1442.htm#fr_857) Vish*n*u XXIII, 49.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[170:3](sbe1442.htm#fr_858) Vish*n*u XXIII, 48.
The term âkara, translated by 'mines and places of manufacture,' is
explained in the commentary by 'places of production, i.e. of sugar and
honey.' It is no doubt intended to apply to any place where articles of
consumption or use are produced. Govinda adds that as 'continuous
streams of water' are always pure, one must take care that the water for
sipping flows out of the vessel in an unbroken stream.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[171:5](sbe1442.htm#fr_859) Vasish*th*a IV, 37.
*K*aityav*ri*ksha, 'a tree standing on sacred ground,' means literally,
'a memorial-tree.'

<span id="fn_860"></span>[171:7](sbe1442.htm#fr_860) Govinda points out
that couches and seats and the like, on which *K*a*nd*âlas and outcasts
have lain or sat down, must be purified.

<span id="fn_861"></span>[171:8](sbe1442.htm#fr_861) 'That must be
referred to grain on a threshing-floor, and so forth, which has been
produced by men whose food must not be eaten, and again is considered to
be common to all. In this case, too, what has been received from
outcasts and *K*a*nd*âlas, that is defiled. Milk which has been received
just at milking-time may be drunk out of a vessel that stands in the
cowpen.'--Govinda. As regards the grain produced by low-caste people,
the rule probably refers to cases where the land of an Agrahâra or other
village is cultivated by men of the lowest castes. The author means to
say that in such cases a Brâhma*n*a may take his share from the
threshing-floor, where the whole produce of the village-land is stored,
without hesitation.
