<p>Now, therefore, (we will speak) of those who desire (to fulfil) the duties of S&acirc;l&icirc;nas (dwellers in houses), Y&acirc;y&acirc;varas (wanderers), and <I>K</I>akra<I>k</I>aras (circle-goers), who subsist by nine (different) means of livelihood.</p>  
<p>2. The term livelihood' (v<I>ri</I>tti) is used because they subsist thereby (tadvartan&acirc;t).</p>  
<p>3. The word S&acirc;l&icirc;na (is used) because they dwell in houses (<I>s</I>&acirc;l&acirc;).</p>  
<p>4. To be a Y&acirc;y&acirc;vara (means that one) goes on by means of a most excellent livelihood (v<I>ri</I>tty&acirc; varay&acirc; y&acirc;ti).</p>  
<p>5. The term <I>K</I>akra<I>k</I>ara is derived from going by turns (to the houses of rich men).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1329"></A><A HREF="#fn_1329"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. We will explain those (above-mentioned means of livelihood) in their proper order.</p>  
<p>7. They are nine, (viz.) Sha<I>n</I><I>n</I>ivartan&icirc;, Kaudd&acirc;li, Dhruv&acirc;, Sampraksh&acirc;lan&icirc;, Sam&ucirc;h&acirc;, P&acirc;lan&icirc;, Silo<I>&ntilde;</I><I>kh</I>&acirc;, Kapot&acirc;, and Siddho<I>&ntilde;</I><I>kh</I>&acirc;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1330"></A><A HREF="#fn_1330"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>

<p>8. (In addition) to these there is a tenth way of living, viz. forest-life.</p>  
<p>9. (If he desires to adopt) any of the nine ways of living,</p>  
<p>10. He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails to be cut, and besides gets ready (the following objects),</p>  
<p>11. (Viz.) the skin of a black antelope, a water-pot, a staff, a yoke for carrying burdens, (and) a sickle.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1331"></A><A HREF="#fn_1331"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. He desires to go forth, after having offered a Traidh&acirc;tav&icirc;ya (offering) or a Vai<I>s</I>v&acirc;nar&icirc; (ish<I>t</I>i).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1332"></A><A HREF="#fn_1332"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. Now on the (following) morning, after the sun has risen, he makes the sacred fires burn brightly, melts butter on the G&acirc;rhapatya fire, cleanses it (with Ku<I>s</I>a grass), heats the (spoons called) Sru<I>k</I> and Sruva, cleans (them), takes out four (spoonfuls of butter) in the Sru<I>k</I>, and offers the V&acirc;stoshpat&icirc;ya (oblation) in the &Acirc;havan&icirc;ya fire according to (the rules of his) S&ucirc;tra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1333"></A><A HREF="#fn_1333"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>

<p>14. Having recited the Puronuv&acirc;ky&acirc; (verse), 'O lord of the dwelling, permit us,' &amp;c., he offers (the oblation) with the Y&acirc;<I>g</I>y&acirc; verse, 'O lord of the dwelling, with thy kind company,' &amp;c.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1334"></A><A HREF="#fn_1334"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. Some (declare that) every person who has kindled the sacred fires (shall offer these Homas).</p>  
<p>16. Others (say that) a Y&acirc;y&acirc;vara alone (shall do it).</p>  
<p>17. After departing (from his house), he stops at the extremity of the village, or at the extremity of the boundary of the village, builds there a hut or a cottage, and enters that.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1335"></A><A HREF="#fn_1335"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>18. Let him use the skin of the black antelope and the other (objects) which he has prepared for the several purposes which they are intended to serve.</p>  
<p>19. Known (is) the (duty of) serving the fires; known (is) the (duty of) offering the new and full moon sacrifices; known (is) the successive performance of the five Mah&acirc;ya<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>as; it is seen that the vegetables, which have been produced, are offered.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1336"></A><A HREF="#fn_1336"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. He hallows those (vegetables), either (reciting the text),' I offer what is agreeable to all the gods,' or silently, and cooks (them).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1337"></A><A HREF="#fn_1337"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_287"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 287</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. For such (a man the duty of) teaching, sacrificing for others, accepting gifts, and (performing) other sacrifices (than those mentioned) ceases.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1338"></A><A HREF="#fn_1338"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>22. (The use of) sacrificial food fit to be eaten during the performance of a vow is seen;</p>  
<p>23. That is as follows: (his food may be) mixed with clarified butter or sour milk, (it must) not (contain) pungent condiments or salt, nor meat, nor (be) stale.</p>  
<p>24: (He shall remain) chaste, or approach (his wife) in season.</p>  
<p>25. (It is necessary) to have the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body, and his nails cut on each Parva day, and the rules of purification (are obligatory on him).</p>  
<p>26. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two kinds of purification, which the <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>as reverentially practise, are mentioned in the Veda,--external (purification), which consists in the removal of impure stains and foul smells, and internal (purification), which consists in the abstention from injuring live creatures.'</p>  
<p>27. 'The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the soul of beings by abstention from injuring, (and) the internal organ by truth.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1339"></A><A HREF="#fn_1339"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1329"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1329">284:5</A> <b>1</b>. Govinda says that <I>K</I>akra<I>k</I>ara is another name for Y&acirc;y&acirc;vara, and that anukrama<I>k</I>ara<I>n</I>a, 'going by turns,' means going successively to the houses of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<I>s</I>yas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1330"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1330">284:7</A> The terms left untranslated are fully explained in the next <A NAME="page_285"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 285</FONT></A> chapter. All the MSS. read kaunt&acirc;l&icirc; for kaudd&acirc;l&icirc;, which occurs in the commentary alone.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1331"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1331">285:11</A> The v&icirc;vadha, 'a yoke for carrying burdens,' consists usually of a bamboo pole, to the ends of which two ropes are attached for fastening the loads. Kuthah&acirc;r&icirc;, 'a sickle,' seems to be the name of a particular kind of sickle, since Govinda explains it by v&acirc;savas&acirc;sanad&acirc;tram. He adds that the term includes 'a spade' (kudd&acirc;la) and other implements.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1332"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1332">285:12</A> The meaning is that on the evening before his departure from the old home he is to offer the Traidh&acirc;tav&icirc;ya-homa. According to the <I>S</I>rauta-s&ucirc;tras (see the Petersb. Dict. s. v. traidh&acirc;tav&icirc;) the latter offering always occurs at the end of a great sacrifice. Hence it is appropriate for a person who wishes to begin a new mode of life.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1333"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1333">285:13</A> This is the leave-taking from the old dwelling.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1334"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1334">286:14</A> The two verses occur Taittir&icirc;ya Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; III, 4, 10, I. It is specially mentioned by S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a that the two verses have to be recited by an Agnihotrin on departing from his home.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1335"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1335">286:17</A> Ma<I>th</I>a, 'a cottage,' is, according to Govinda, a house resting on many posts or pillars, while ku<I>t</I>&icirc; is the simple shed with four posts and a roof of leaves.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1336"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1336">286:19</A> The last clause, probably, is meant to prescribe a simpler form of the Vai<I>s</I>vadeva.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1337"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1337">286:20</A> Govinda adds that the meaning is that the sacrificer shall eat the boiled rice in silence.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1338"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1338">287:21</A> Govinda adds that the obligation of performing other meritorious deeds, such as digging wells and tanks (p&ucirc;rta), also ceases.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_1339"></A><A HREF="sbe1473.htm#fr_1339">287:27</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a III, 60.</P>
