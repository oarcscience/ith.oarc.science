### CHAPTER X.

1\. Let an ascetic depart from his house, giving a promise of safety
from injury to all animated beings. <span
id="fr_265"></span>[1](#fn_265)

2\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'That ascetic who
wanders about at peace with all creatures, forsooth, has nothing to fear
from any living being,' <span id="fr_266"></span>[2](#fn_266)

3\. 'But he who becomes an ascetic and does not promise safety from
injury to all beings, destroys the born and the unborn; and (so does an
ascetic) who accepts presents.' <span id="fr_267"></span>[3](#fn_267)

4\. Let him discontinue the performance of all religious ceremonies, but
let him never discontinue the recitation of the Veda. By neglecting the
Veda he becomes a *S*ûdra; therefore he shall not neglect it.' <span
id="fr_268"></span>[4](#fn_268)

5 '(To pronounce) the one syllable (Om) is the best (mode of reciting
the) Veda, to suppress the breath is the highest (form of) austerity;
(to subsist on) alms is better than fasting; compassion is preferable to
liberality.' <span id="fr_269"></span>[5](#fn_269)

6\. (Let the ascetic) shave (his head); let him have no property and no
home. <span id="fr_270"></span>[6](#fn_270)

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

7\. Let him beg food at seven houses which he has not selected
(beforehand), <span id="fr_271"></span>[7](#fn_271)

8\. (At the time) when the smoke (of the kitchen-fire) has ceased and
the pestle lies motionless. <span id="fr_272"></span>[8](#fn_272)

9\. Let him wear a single garment, <span id="fr_273"></span>[9](#fn_273)

10\. Or cover his body with a skin or with grass that has been nibbled
at by a cow.

11\. Let him sleep on the bare ground.

12\. Let him frequently change his residence, <span
id="fr_274"></span>[12](#fn_274)

13\. (Dwelling) at the extremity of the village, in a temple, or in an
empty house, or at the root of a tree.

14\. Let him (constantly) seek in his heart the knowledge (of the
universal soul). <span id="fr_275"></span>[14](#fn_275)

15\. (An ascetic) who lives constantly in the forest,

16\. Shall not wander about within sight of the village-cattle.

17\. 'Freedom from future births is certain for him who constantly
dwells in the forest, who has subdued his organs of sensation and
action, who has renounced all sensual gratification, whose mind is fixed
in meditation on the Supreme Spirit, and who is (wholly) indifferent (to
pleasure and pain).'

18\. (Let him) not (wear) any visible mark (of his order), nor (follow)
any visible rule of conduct.

19\. Let him, though not mad, appear like one out of his mind.

20\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'There is no salvation
for him who is addicted to <span id="fr_276"></span>[20](#fn_276)

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

the pursuit of the science of words, nor for him who rejoices in
captivating men, nor for him who is fond of (good) eating and (fine)
clothing, nor for him who loves a pleasant dwelling.'

21\. 'Neither by (explaining) prodigies and omens, nor by skill in
astrology and palmistry, nor by casuistry and expositions (of the
*S*âstras), let him ever seek to obtain alms.' <span
id="fr_277"></span>[21](#fn_277)

22\. 'Let him not be dejected when he obtains nothing, nor glad when he
receives something. Let him only seek as much as will sustain life,
without caring for household property.' <span
id="fr_278"></span>[22](#fn_278)

23\. 'But he, forsooth, knows (the' road to) salvation who cares neither
for a hut, nor for water, nor for clothes, nor for the three Pushkaras'
(holy tanks), nor for a house, nor for a seat, nor for food.' <span
id="fr_279"></span>[23](#fn_279)

24\. In the morning and in the evening he may eat as much (food) as he
obtains in the house of one Brâhma*n*a, excepting honey and meat, <span
id="fr_280"></span>[24](#fn_280)

25\. And he shall not (eat so much that he is quite) satiated. <span
id="fr_281"></span>[25](#fn_281)

26\. At his option (an ascetic) may (also) dwell in a village.

27\. Let him not be crooked (in his ways); (let him) not (observe the
rules of) impurity on account <span id="fr_282"></span>[27](#fn_282)

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

of deaths (or births); let him not have a house; let him be of
concentrated mind.

28\. Let him not enjoy any object of sensual gratification.

29\. Let him be (utterly) indifferent, avoiding to do injury or to show
kindness to any living being.

30\. To avoid backbiting, jealousy, pride, self-consciousness, unbelief,
dishonesty, self-praise, blaming others, deceit, covetousness, delusion,
anger, and envy is considered to be the duty of (men of) all
orders. <span id="fr_283"></span>[30](#fn_283)

31\. A Brâhma*n*a who wears the sacred thread, who holds in his hand a
gourd filled with water, who is pure and avoids the food of *S*ûdras
will not fail (to gain) the world of Brahman. <span
id="fr_284"></span>[31](#fn_284)

<span id="fn_269"></span>[46:5](sbe1413.htm#fr_269) Manu II, 83.

<span id="fn_270"></span>[46:6](sbe1413.htm#fr_270) Gautama III, 11, 22.
The term parigraha, 'home,' includes the wife, the family, attendants,
and a house.

<span id="fn_272"></span>[47:8](sbe1413.htm#fr_272) Vish*n*u XCVI, 6;
Manu VI, 56.

<span id="fn_273"></span>[47:9](sbe1413.htm#fr_273) Vish*n*u XCVI, 13.
It is very probable that the single garment mentioned in the Sûtra is,
as K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita thinks, a small strip of cloth to cover the
ascetic's nakedness.

<span id="fn_274"></span>[47:12](sbe1413.htm#fr_274)-13. Vish*n*u XCVI,
10-12.

<span id="fn_275"></span>[47:14](sbe1413.htm#fr_275) Manu VI, 43, 65.

<span id="fn_276"></span>[47:20](sbe1413.htm#fr_276) I read
'ramyâvasathapriyasya,' with the majority of the MSS.

<span id="fn_277"></span>[48:21](sbe1413.htm#fr_277) Identical with Manu
VI, 50.

<span id="fn_278"></span>[48:22](sbe1413.htm#fr_278) Vish*n*u XCVI, 4.
Identical with Manu VI, 57.

<span id="fn_279"></span>[48:23](sbe1413.htm#fr_279) There are three
Tîrthas called Pushkara; see Professor Jolly's note on Vish*n*u LXXXV,
I.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[48:24](sbe1413.htm#fr_280)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita thinks that this rule is a concession to those
ascetics who are unable to subsist on one meal a day, as Manu VI, 55
prescribes.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[48:25](sbe1413.htm#fr_281) Manu VI, 59. 26.
Manu VI, 94-95.

<span id="fn_282"></span>[48:27](sbe1413.htm#fr_282) The text is here
probably corrupt. But I follow K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita. Several MSS. read
a*s*a*th*o, 'he shall not be a rogue,' for a*s*avo, 'he shall not
observe the rules of impurity.'

<span id="fn_283"></span>[49:30](sbe1413.htm#fr_283) Vish*n*u II, 16-17.

<span id="fn_284"></span>[49:31](sbe1413.htm#fr_284)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita believes that this Sûtra again refers to ascetics.
But that is hardly possible, as ascetics are not allowed to wear a
sacrificial thread (see above. Sûtra 18). I think that it is meant to
emphatically assert that a Brâhma*n*a who is free from the shortcomings
enumerated in the preceding Sûtra, and who follows the rule of conduct,
will obtain salvation, whether he passes through the order of
Sa*m*nyâsins or not.
