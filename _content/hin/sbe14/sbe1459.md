### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 3, KA*ND*IKÂ 5.

1\. Bathing is suitable for (the practice of) austerity.

2\. The libation to the manes (is offered) after the gods have been
satisfied (with water),

3\. They pour out water which gives strength, from one Tîrtha after the
other. <span id="fr_1173"></span>[3](#fn_1173)

4\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'With flowing,
unconfined water twice-born men of the three castes shall satisfy the
gods, *Ri*shis, and manes, when they have risen in the morning.'

5\. 'They shall not offer (libations of water) con-fined (in tanks and
wells), (If they do it), he who made the embankment; will obtain a share
(of the merit of their devotion).' <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[5](#fn_1174)

6\. 'Therefore let him avoid embankments (around tanks) and wells made
by others.' <span id="fr_1175"></span>[6](#fn_1175)

7\. Nov they quote also (the following verse): 'Or, in times of
distress--not as a rule--he may bathe in (water) confined (in tanks),
after taking out three lumps (of earth); from a well (let him take
three) lumps of clay and three jars of water.' <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[7](#fn_1176)

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

8\. If he has accepted presents from one who is able to give presents to
many, or from one whose presents ought not to be accepted, or if he has
sacrificed for one for whom he ought not to have sacrificed, or if he
has eaten food (given by a person) whose food must not be eaten, he
shall mutter the Taratsamandîya. <span id="fr_1177"></span>[8](#fn_1177)

9\. Now they quote also (the following verse): Those who improperly
associate with (an outcast) teacher, those who improperly associate with
(outcast) pupils, and those who improperly associate (with outcasts) by
(accepting their) food or by (reciting) Mantras (for them), enter into
deep darkness.'

10\. Now (follow) the duties of a Snâtaka. <span
id="fr_1178"></span>[10](#fn_1178)

11\. After offering at the morning and at the evening (meals) with (a
portion of) the food which he may have, the Vai*s*vadeva and the
Bali-offerings, he shall honour, according to his ability, Brâhma*n*as,
Kshatriyas, Vai*s*yas, and *S*ûdras (who may come to his house as)
guests. <span id="fr_1179"></span>[11](#fn_1179)

12\. If he cannot (afford to give food) to many, let him give
(something) to one who possesses good qualities,

13\. Or to him who has come first.

14, If a *S*ûdra (has come as) a guest, he shall order him (to do some)
work, (and feed him afterwards); <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[14](#fn_1180)

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

15\. Or (if he cannot spare much), he may give a first portion (agrya)
to a *S*rotriya. <span id="fr_1181"></span>[15](#fn_1181)

16\. It is prescribed that the division (of the food) shall be made
without detriment to (the interests of) those who daily receive a
portion. <span id="fr_1182"></span>[16](#fn_1182)

17\. But he shall never eat without having given away (some small
portion of the food).

18\. Now they quote also two verses which have been proclaimed by (the
goddess of) food: 'Him who, without giving me to the gods, the manes,
his servants, his guests and friends, consumes what has been prepared
and (thus), in his exceeding folly, swallows poison, I consume, and I am
his death. But for him who, offering the Agnihotra, performing the
Vai*s*vadeva, and honouring guests, eats, full of contentment, purity,
and faith, what remains after feeding those whom he must support, I
become ambrosia, and he (really) enjoys me.'

19\. Presents of money must be given, according to one's ability, to
good Brâhma*n*as, *S*rotriyas, and Vedapâragas, when they beg outside
the Vedi, for the sake of Gurus, in order to defray (the expenses of)
their marriages, or of medicine, or when they are distressed for a
livelihood, or desirous to offer a sacrifice, or engaged in studying, or
on a journey, or have performed a Vi*s*va*g*it sacrifice. <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[19](#fn_1183)

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

20\. Cooked food (must be given) to other (beggars). <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[20](#fn_1184)

21\. Let him eat (seated) in a pure, enclosed place, after having well
washed his hands and feet and after having sipped water, respectfully
receiving the food which is brought to him, keeping himself free from
lust, anger, hatred, greed, and perplexity, (conveying the food into his
mouth) with all his fingers and making no noise (during
mastication). <span id="fr_1185"></span>[21](#fn_1185)

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[238:3](sbe1459.htm#fr_1173) **5**. As to the

I read the verse as follows: uddh*ri*tya vâpi trîn pi*nd*ân kuiyâd
âpatsu no sadâ \| niruddhâsu *k*a m*ri*tpi*nd*ân kûpât trîn
abgha*t*â*m*statheti \|\| The Dekhan MSS. read at the end of the second
half verse, kûpâ*m*strînava*t*â*m*stathâ; M. has
kupât*rî*nabapa*t*ânstathâ while C. I. gives kûpât trîn
gha*t*â*m*stathâ. Nandapa*nd*ita on Vish*n*u, loc. cit., seems to have
had the latter <span id="page_239">p. 239</span> reading, and to have
changed it to 'kûpât to trin gha*t*â*m*stathâ,' in order to save the
metre. The sense remains the same.

<span id="fn_1177"></span>[239:8](sbe1459.htm#fr_1177) Manu XI, 254. The
text is found Rig-veda IX, 58. Govinda explains bahupratigrâhya, 'one
who is able to give presents to many,' by bahubh*ri*tyabhara*n*akshama,
'one who is able to support many servants.'

is equal to sixteen mouthfuls, each of the size of a peahen's egg.

<span id="fn_1182"></span>[240:16](sbe1459.htm#fr_1182) Âpastamba II, 4,

wives, and so forth.--Govinda. But see also Âpastamba, loc. cit.
