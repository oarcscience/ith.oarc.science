### CHAPTER XXVI.

1\. If, untired, he performs three suppressions of his breath according
to the rule, the sins which he committed during a day and a night are
instantly destroyed. <span id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_679)

2\. Seated during the evening prayer, he removes by (three) suppressions
of his breath all guilt which <span id="fr_680"></span>[2](#fn_680)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

he incurred during the day by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.

3\. But standing during the morning prayer, he removes by (three)
suppressions of his breath all guilt which he incurred during the night
by deeds, thoughts, or speeches.

4\. But sixteen suppressions of breath, accompanied by (the recitation
of) the Vyâh*ri*tis and the syllable Om, repeated daily, purify after a
month even the slayer of a learned Brâhma*n*a. <span
id="fr_681"></span>[4](#fn_681)

5\. Even a drinker of spirituous liquor becomes pure, if he mutters the
(hymn seen) by Kutsa, 'Apa na*h* sosu*k*ad agham,' and (the hymn seen)
by Vasish*th*a (which begins with the word) 'Prati,' the Mâhitra (hymn),
and the *S*uddhavatîs. <span id="fr_682"></span>[5](#fn_682)

6\. Even he who has stolen gold becomes instantly free from guilt, if he
once mutters (the hymn beginning with the words) 'Asya vâmasya' and the
*S*ivasa*m*kalpa. <span id="fr_683"></span>[6](#fn_683)

7\. The violator of a Guru's bed is freed (from sin) if he repeatedly
recites the (hymn beginning) 'Havish pântam a*g*aram' and that
(beginning) 'Na tam a*m*ha*h*' and mutters the hymn addressed to
Purusha. <span id="fr_684"></span>[7](#fn_684)

8\. Or plunging into water he may thrice mutter the Aghamarsha*n*a. Manu
has declared that the (effect is the) same as if he had gone to bathe at
a horse-sacrifice. <span id="fr_685"></span>[8](#fn_685)

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

9\. An offering consisting of muttered prayers is ten times more
efficacious than a sacrifice at which animals are killed; a (prayer)
which is inaudible (to others) surpasses it a hundred times, and the
mental (recitation of sacred texts) one thousand times. <span
id="fr_686"></span>[9](#fn_686)

10\. The four Pâkaya*gñ*as and those sacrifices which are enjoined by
the rules of the Veda are all together not equal in value to the
sixteenth part of a sacrifice consisting of muttered prayers. <span
id="fr_687"></span>[10](#fn_687)

11\. But, undoubtedly, a Brâhma*n*a reaches the highest goal by
muttering prayers only; whether he perform other (rites) or neglect
them, he is called a Brâhma*n*a who befriends all creatures
(maitra). <span id="fr_688"></span>[11](#fn_688)

12\. The sins of those who are intent on muttering prayers, of those who
offer burnt-oblations, of those who are given to meditation, of those
who reside in sacred places, and of those who have bathed after
performing the vows called *S*iras, do not remain. <span
id="fr_689"></span>[12](#fn_689)

13\. As a fire, fanned by wind, burns brighter, and (as its flame grows)
through offerings (of butter), even so a Brâhma*n*a who is daily engaged
in

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

muttering sacred texts shines with a brilliant lustre.

14\. The destruction of those who fulfil the duty of daily study, who
constantly restrain themselves, who mutter prayers and offer sacrifices
has never been known (to happen). <span id="fr_690"></span>[14](#fn_690)

15\. Let him who is desirous of purification repeat, though he be
charged with all sins, the divine (Gâyatrî), at the most one thousand
times, or one hundred times as a medium (penance), or at least ten times
(for trivial faults).

16\. A Kshatriya shall pass through misfortunes which have befallen him
by the strength of his arms, a Vai*s*ya and *S*ûdra by their wealth, the
highest among twice-born men by muttered prayers and burnt-oblations.

17\. As horses (are useless) without a chariot, as chariots (are
useless) without horses, even so austerity (is useless) to him who is
destitute of sacred learning, and sacred learning to him who practises
no austerities.

18\. As food mixed with honey, or honey mixed with food, even so are
austerities and learning, joined together, a powerful medicine.

19\. No guilt taints a Brâhma*n*a who possesses learning, practises
austerities, and daily mutters sacred texts, though he may constantly
commit sinful acts.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[126:1](sbe1429.htm#fr_679) **XXVI**. The verb
dhârayet, 'performs,' seems to be used in order to indicate that,
according to the Yoga*s*âstra, three Prâ*n*âyâmas make one Dhâra*n*â;
see Yâ*gñ*avalkya III, 201.

<span id="fn_683"></span>[127:6](sbe1429.htm#fr_683) Manu LI, 251. The

<span id="fn_686"></span>[128:9](sbe1429.htm#fr_686) Manu II, 85;
Vish*n*u LV, 19. The term ârambhaya*gñ*a, translated by 'an offering at
which animals are slain,' is taken by K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita to mean
pâthaya*gñ*a, 'an offering consisting of Vedic mantras recited aloud.'
The word may be taken in several ways, but the various reading
vidhiya*gñ*a in Manu's verse induces me to adopt the translation given
above.

Manu II, 86, and Vish*n*u LV, 20. Regarding the four Pâkaya*gñ*as, see
Professor Jolly's note on Vish*n*u. In my opinion the four classes of
rites huta, ahuta, prahuta, and prâ*s*ita are meant.
