### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 6, KA*ND*IKÂ 13.

1\. The gods enjoy a pure sacrifice (only); <span
id="fr_932"></span>[1](#fn_932)

2\. For the gods are desirous of purity and (themselves) pure.

3\. The following (*Rik*) declares that, 'To you, O Maruts, the pure
ones, pure viands; to you, the pure ones, I offer a pure sacrifice. They
who love the pious rites, who are of pure origin, (themselves) pure and
purifiers (of others), came duly to the truthful (worshipper).' <span
id="fr_933"></span>[3](#fn_933)

4\. (He will be) pure (if there is) no blemish on his clothes, therefore
let him perform all (acts) that are connected with sacrificing,
(dressed) in unblemished clothes. <span id="fr_934"></span>[4](#fn_934)

5\. The sacrificer and his wife as well as the officiating priests shall
put on dresses which have been washed, and dried by the wind, and which
are not in a bad condition. <span id="fr_935"></span>[5](#fn_935)

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

6\. (It shall be) thus from the (beginning of the) Prakrama, <span
id="fr_936"></span>[6](#fn_936)

7\. And thus at the long Soma-sacrifices and the Sattras;

8\. And (on other occasions other dresses must be used) in accordance
with the injunction (of the Veda),

9\. Thus at (all) Ish*t*is, animal sacrifices, and Soma-sacrifices which
may be used as spells (against enemies), the priests shall perform (the
sacred rites), wearing red turbans and red dresses; (when reciting the
hymn seen by) V*ri*shâkapi (he shall) wear a dress and a mantle of many
colours and so forth. <span id="fr_937"></span>[9](#fn_937)

10\. At the Agnyâdhâna (sacrifice) the clothes (shall be made) of flax;
on failure of such, (dresses) made of cotton or of wool are used.

11\. Clothes defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen and the like (shall
be) cleaned with earth, water and the like. <span
id="fr_938"></span>[11](#fn_938)

12\. (Dresses) made of T*ri*pa-bark and v*ri*kala (shall be treated)
like cotton-cloth, <span id="fr_939"></span>[12](#fn_939)

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

13\. Deer-skins like (dresses) made of bark. <span
id="fr_940"></span>[13](#fn_940)

14\. (Let him) not (use) a mantle which has been wrapped (round the
loins, or) on which he has been lying (in his bed), without washing it.

15: Let him not employ for the gods anything used by men without beating
it on a stone. <span id="fr_941"></span>[15](#fn_941)

16\. If solid earth is defiled, (it must be) smeared with cowdung. <span
id="fr_942"></span>[16](#fn_942)

17\. Loose (earth must be cleansed by) ploughing,

18\. Moist (earth) by bringing pure (earth) and covering (it with that).

19\. Land is purified in four (ways), by being trod on by cows, by
digging, by lighting a fire on it, by rain falling on it,

20\. Fifthly by smearing it with cowdung, and sixthly through (the lapse
of) time.

21\. Grass placed on unconsecrated ground (must be) washed. <span
id="fr_943"></span>[21](#fn_943)

22\. (Grass) defiled out of one's sight, (shall be) sprinkled (with
water). <span id="fr_944"></span>[22](#fn_944)

23\. Small pieces of sacred fuel (shall be purified) in the same manner.

24\. Large pieces of wood (must be) washed and dried.

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

25\. But a great quantity (of wood shall be) sprinkled (with water).

26\. Wooden vessels which have been touched by impure men (shall be)
scraped;

27\. (And) those which are defiled by stains of remnants (shall be)
planed. <span id="fr_945"></span>[27](#fn_945)

28\. (Wooden vessels) defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and the
like (very impure substances shall be) thrown away. <span
id="fr_946"></span>[28](#fn_946)

29\. These (rules must be followed) except in case a (special)
injunction (is given);

30\. Thus, for instance, (purification by) washing with Ku*s*a grass and
water (is prescribed) on all the following (occasions, viz.) at the
Agnihotra, the Gharmo*kkh*ish*t*a, the Dadhigharma, the Ku*nd*apâyinâm
Ayana, the Utsargi*n*âm Ayana, the Dâkshâya*n*a sacrifice, the
Ardhodaya, the *K*atu*sk*akra, and the Brahmaudanas, <span
id="fr_947"></span>[30](#fn_947)

31\. (Again) at all Soma-sacrifices (the cups must be) cleaned with
water only on (the heap of earth called) the Mâr*g*âliya;

32\. If these same (cups are defiled) by urine, ordure, <span
id="fr_948"></span>[32](#fn_948)

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

blood, semen, and the like (they must be) thrown away.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_932"></span>[186:1](sbe1446.htm#fr_932)-2. **13**. See also
above, I, 5, 10, 4. This Adhyâya and the next ought to have been given
in the *S*rauta Sûtra.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[186:3](sbe1446.htm#fr_933) Rig-veda VII, 56,
12; Taittirîya-brâhma*n*a II, 8, 5, 5. The meaning of the last portion
of the verse is somewhat doubtful. Sâya*n*a gives two different
explanations and Govinda a third.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[186:4](sbe1446.htm#fr_934) Govinda points out
that the dresses of the sacrificer and of his priests must be white,
because farther on (Sûtras 9-10) other colours are specially prescribed.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[186:5](sbe1446.htm#fr_935) Govinda thinks that
the word *k*a, 'as well as,' is intended to include the lookers-on.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[187:6](sbe1446.htm#fr_936) Regarding the
ceremony called Prakrama, literally 'stepping forward from the
Gârhapatya fire,' see Sâya*n*a on Taitt. Br. I, 1, 4, 1. It opens the
Agnyâdhâna rite.

<span id="fn_937"></span>[187:9](sbe1446.htm#fr_937) Govinda states that
the words iti ka, and so forth,' are intended to include other
incantations. The V*ri*shâkapi hymn is found Rig-veda X, 86.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[187:11](sbe1446.htm#fr_938) Govinda states
that the word iti, 'and the like,' is intended to include cowdung, cow's
urine, and other substances used for purification.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[187:12](sbe1446.htm#fr_939) Govinda states
that there is a tree called T*ri*pa, the bark of which is used for
dresses. V*ri*kala, which has been left untranslated, is explained by
*s*akama, a word which is not found in our dictionaries.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[188:13](sbe1446.htm#fr_940) Govinda says that,
as the treatment of valkala, bark-dresses,' has not been prescribed, the
meaning of the Sûtra can only be, that bark-dresses and black-buck skins
are to be treated alike, i.e. that they are to be cleaned with Bel-nut
and rice; see above.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[188:15](sbe1446.htm#fr_941) Govinda explains
apalpûlitam by 'without beating it with the hand on a stone.' He
mentions as an instance the skin which is used in preparing the Soma.

<span id="fn_942"></span>[188:16](sbe1446.htm#fr_942) According to
Govinda, solid earth is such on which the fire-altars are built.

<span id="fn_943"></span>[188:21](sbe1446.htm#fr_943) E.g. grass
intended for the barhis, if it has been placed on a spot which has not
been sprinkled with water.

<span id="fn_944"></span>[188:22](sbe1446.htm#fr_944) 'Defiled out of
one's sight,' i.e. brought by *S*ûdras.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[189:27](sbe1446.htm#fr_945) Govinda says that
this rule is optional.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[189:28](sbe1446.htm#fr_946) Govinda adds that
fuel, Ku*s*a grass, and the like, which have been defiled in this
manner, must also be thrown away.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[189:30](sbe1446.htm#fr_947) Regarding the
Dadhigharma, a homa, see Vaitâna Sûtra 21,18; regarding the
Ku*nd*apâyinâm Ayana, Â*s*valâyana *S*rauta Sûtra XII, 4; and regarding
the Dâkshâya*n*a sacrifice, a variety of the new and full-moon offering,
Â*s*valâyana II, 14. The Ardhodaya is possibly the vrata of that name
mentioned in the Purâ*n*as, According to Govinda, the *K*atu*sk*akra,
which is otherwise known as a Tântric rite, is a sacrifice,
ish*t*akâkosh*t*a (?) madhyavasanto ya*g*ante tathetaradaya*h* (?).
Regarding the Brahmaudana, see Â*s*valâyana *S*rauta Sûtra I, 4.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[189:32](sbe1446.htm#fr_948) Govinda says that
the injunction to throw away defiled <span id="page_191">p. 191</span>
vessels has been repeated, in order to prevent a misconception. For as
Soma is said to be a great means of purification, it might be supposed
that it was powerful enough to prevent the defilement of vessels into
which it is poured at a sacrifice. But compare the next Sûtras.
