<p>4. When the stars have risen, let him partake of gruel prepared of one handful of barley.</p>  
<p>5. After seven (days and) nights he is freed from all minor sins (upap&acirc;taka), whether they have been committed intentionally or unintentionally, after twelve (days and) nights (from all other sins) excepting the murder of a learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, the violation of a Guru's bed, stealing gold, and drinking Sur&acirc;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1358"></A><A HREF="#fn_1358"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

He overcomes everything, he conquers all, he obtains the reward of all sacrifices, he has bathed at all sacred bathing-places, he has performed the vows required for (the study of) all the Vedas, he becomes known to all the gods, he sanctifies a company (of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as) by merely looking (at them), and his undertakings are successful. Thus speaks Baudh&acirc;yana.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1359"></A><A HREF="#fn_1359"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>
