<p>1. Referring to deaths and births, they declare that the impurity of Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as lasts ten days; excepting officiating priests, men who have performed the initiatory ceremony of a Soma-sacrifice, and students of the Veda.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_888"></A><A HREF="#fn_888"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. But amongst Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a-relationship (extends) to the seventh person.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_889"></A><A HREF="#fn_889"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. (If children die) before the completion of the seventh month or before teething, (the relatives) shall bathe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_890"></A><A HREF="#fn_890"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. In (the case of a child) that dies before the completion of its third year or before teething, offerings of funeral cakes and water are not prescribed, and one should not burn its (body);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_891"></A><A HREF="#fn_891"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. Nor when unmarried maidens die.</p>  
<p>6. Some do it in the case of married daughters.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_892"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

<p>of the people. Women are considered to have no business with the sacred texts.</p>  
<p>8. 'The relatives of unmarried women become pure after three days. But the uterine brothers become pure by (following) the rule mentioned before.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_894"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. Moreover, the great-grandfather, the grand-father, the father, oneself, the uterine brothers, the son by a wife of equal caste, the grandson, (and) the great-grandson--these they call Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, but not the (great-grandson's) son;--and amongst these a son and a son's son (together with their father are) sharers of an undivided oblation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_895"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. The sharers of divided oblations they call Sakulyas.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_896"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>

<p>11. If no other (relations) are living, the property (of a deceased male) descends to them (the Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. On failure of Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, the Sakulyas (inherit).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. On failure of them, the teacher who (holds the place of a spiritual) father, a pupil, or an officiating priest shall take it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>14. On failure of them, the king. Let him give that property to persons well-versed in the three Vedas.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. But the king should never take for himself the property of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. Now they quote also (the following verse): The property of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a destroys (him who</p>

<p>takes it), together with sons and grandsons; poison kills one man only. (Therefore) they do not declare poison to be (the worst) poison. The property of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is called (the worst) poison.'</p>  
<p>17. If a birth and a death occur together, one. and the same period of ten (days and) nights (shall serve for both).</p>  
<p>18. Now if (other deaths or births) happen before the completion of the ten (days and) nights (of impurity), the first period of ten (days and) nights (shall suffice, provided the new cause of impurity occurs) before the end of the ninth day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>19. On a birth, indeed, the parents (alone) become impure during ten days.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. Some (declare that) the mother (alone becomes impure), because (people) avoid (lying-in women alone).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. Others (say that) the father (alone becomes impure) because the semen is the chief cause (of the generation).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>22. For sons who were born without mothers, are mentioned in the revealed texts.</p>  
<p>23. But (the correct opinion is that) both the parents (become impure) because they are equally connected (with the event).</p>

<p><A NAME="page_181"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 181</FONT></A></p>  
<p>24. But when a death (has happened, the relatives of the deceased), allowing the youngest to begin, shall pass their sacrificial threads over the right shoulder and under the left arm, descend into the water at a bathing-place, submerge (their bodies), emerge (out of the water), ascend the bank, sip water, pour out libations for the (deceased, repeating the last four acts) severally three times thereafter, ascend the bank, sip water, touch a coal, water or the like at the door of their house, and sit during ten days on mats, eating food that does not contain pungent condiments or salt.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>25. (Let him perform) a funeral sacrifice on the eleventh or the twelfth (day).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>26. In (performing) the remaining rites (one should) conform to (the customs of) the people.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>27. In case of a (death) let him also keep (a period of impurity) for (persons who are) not (his) Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as, according to the degree of nearness, three (days and) nights, a day and a night, one day and so forth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>

<p>28. For a teacher, a sub-teacher (up&acirc;dhy&acirc;ya), and their sons, three (days and) nights,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>29. Likewise for officiating priests,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>30. Let hire keep. on account of a pupil, for one who has the same spiritual guide, for a fellow-student (sabrahma<I>k</I>&acirc;rin) three (days and) nights, one day and a night, one day and so forth (as periods of impurity).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>31. On a miscarriage females (remain impure) as many (days and) nights as months (elapsed after conception).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>32. If he unintentionally touches the corpse of a stranger, he becomes at once pure after bathing dressed in his clothes.</p>  
<p>33. (If he does it) intentionally, (he will remain impure) during three (days and) nights.</p>  
<p>34. And (the same rules apply if he touches a woman) during her courses.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>35. A son who is born from (intercourse with a temporarily unclean woman) becomes an Abhi<I>s</I>asta. Thereby the penances (to be performed) by him have been explained.</p>  
<p>

<p><A NAME="page_183"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 183</FONT></A></p>  
<p>36. On touching one who sells the Veda, a sacrificial post, an outcast, a funeral pile, a dog, or a <I>K</I>a<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;la he shall bathe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_915"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>37. Now if a worm is produced in an open wound that is filled with pus and sanies, how shall, in that case, a penance be performed?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_916"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A></p>  
<p>38. He who is bitten by a worm will become pure on bathing (daily) during three days and drinking (a mixture of) cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, butter, and water boiled with Ku<I>s</I>a grass.</p>  
<p>39. He who has been touched by a dog shall bathe dressed in his clothes;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_917"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A></p>  
<p>40. Or he becomes pure by washing that spot (where he has been touched), by touching it with fire, by (afterwards) again washing it and his feet, and by sipping water.</p>  
<p>41. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who has been bitten by a dog, is purified if he goes to a river that flows into the ocean, (bathes there and) suppresses his breath one hundred times and (afterwards) eats clarified butter. He will (also) become pure at, once on bathing (in water brought) in golden or silver (vessels), or in a cow's horn, or in new (earthen pots).'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_918"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_895"></A><A HREF="sbe1444.htm#fr_895">178:9</A> Colebrooke, D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga XI, 1, 37; V. Digest CCCXCVII. The text on which Colebrooke's two versions are based differs from that of my MSS. and of Govinda by reading avibhaktad&acirc;y&acirc;d&acirc;n instead of tesh&acirc;<I>m</I> <I>k</I>a putrapautram [v. l. &deg;pautrakam] avibhaktad&acirc;yam. The meaning of the latter clause, which is placed parenthetically before sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;n &acirc;<I>k</I>akshate, '(these) they call Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as,' seems to be that a father with his son and grandson share the cakes offered at one funeral sacrifice by the fourth descendant. Its object is to show that the group called Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as consists of two such subdivisions, between whom the middlemost forms the connecting link. For the middlemost, the svayam, 'oneself,' of the text, first offers the cakes to his three ancestors and later receives the cakes, together with his first two descendants, from his great-grandson. Govinda gives no help. He merely remarks that the S&ucirc;tra contains a paribh&acirc;sh&acirc; or technical rule of interpretation, and that the words api <I>k</I>a, 'moreover,' indicate that it is an expansion of S&ucirc;tra 2.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_896"></A><A HREF="sbe1444.htm#fr_896">178:10</A> Colebrooke, loc. cit. According to <I>G</I>&icirc;m&ucirc;tav&acirc;hana the Sakulyas are the three ascendants beyond the great-grandfather and the three descendants beyond the great-grandson. Others, among <A NAME="page_179"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 179</FONT></A> whom Govinda takes his place, explain the word sakulya to mean 'members of one family' in general. Govinda says, sambandhavi<I>s</I>esha<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ne sati sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc; u<I>k</I>yante sambandham&acirc;tra<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;ne sakuly&acirc;<I>h</I>|| Ata<I>s</I> <I>k</I>a sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc; api sakuly&acirc;<I>h</I>|| 'If a particular relationship is known, they are called Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as; and if (the fact) only is known that relationship exists, Sakulyas.

<P><A NAME="fn_897"></A><A HREF="sbe1444.htm#fr_897">179:11</A> Colebrooke, loc. cit. Both the D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga and the Digest read satsvanga<I>g</I>eshu, 'when there is male issue,' and the V&icirc;ramitrodaya, fol. 218, p. 2, l. 7, agrees with them. The MSS. read all satsv anyeshu, which may, however, be taken with Govinda for asatsv anyeshu, because the preceding word ends in <i>e</i>. Govinda explains anyeshu, 'others,' by auras&acirc;dishu, 'legitimate sons of the body, and so forth.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_898"></A><A HREF="sbe1444.htm#fr_898">179:12</A> Colebrooke, D&acirc;yabh&acirc;ga, loc. cit. The digest omits this S&ucirc;tra.</P>

G&icirc;m&ucirc;tav&acirc;hana wrongly reads pit&acirc; <I>k</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;rya<I>h</I>, 'the father and the teacher.' Govinda gives the explanation adopted above. Regarding the spiritual fatherhood of the teacher, see e.g. Vasish<I>th</I>a II, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_900"></A><A HREF="sbe1444.htm#fr_900">179:14</A> Colebrooke, loc. ca. Govinda reads satsvam, 'the property of a holy man,' instead of tatsvam, 'that property.'</P>

Govinda correctly states that iti, 'or the like,' which stands after 'a coal, water,' is intended to include 'cowdung, and yellow mustard seed,' which are mentioned by Y&acirc;<I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>avalkya III, 13.

<P><A NAME="fn_909"></A><A HREF="sbe1444.htm#fr_909">181:27</A> Gautama XIV, 20. Govinda is of opinion that the duration of the impurity shall depend on the good qualities, learning, &amp;c. of the deceased.</P>

It looks as if he had read the words pakshi<I>n</I>yek&acirc;ham in his text.</p>  
<p>
<P><A NAME="fn_911"></A><A HREF="sbe1444.htm#fr_911">182:29</A> Govinda asserts that ka, 'likewise,' indicates that the rule applies also on the death of persons for whom one sacrifices.</P>
