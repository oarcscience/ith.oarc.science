<p>1. The gods enjoy a pure sacrifice (only);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_932"></A><A HREF="#fn_932"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>3. The following (<I>Ri</I><I>k</I>) declares that, 'To you, O Maruts, the pure ones, pure viands; to you, the pure ones, I offer a pure sacrifice. They who love the pious rites, who are of pure origin, (themselves) pure and purifiers (of others), came duly to the truthful (worshipper).'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_933"></A><A HREF="#fn_933"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. (He will be) pure (if there is) no blemish on his clothes, therefore let him perform all (acts) that are connected with sacrificing, (dressed) in unblemished clothes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_934"></A><A HREF="#fn_934"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. The sacrificer and his wife as well as the officiating priests shall put on dresses which have been washed, and dried by the wind, and which are not in a bad condition.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_935"></A><A HREF="#fn_935"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>7. And thus at the long Soma-sacrifices and the Sattras;</p>  
<p>8. And (on other occasions other dresses must be used) in accordance with the injunction (of the Veda),</p>  
<p>9. Thus at (all) Ish<I>t</I>is, animal sacrifices, and Soma-sacrifices which may be used as spells (against enemies), the priests shall perform (the sacred rites), wearing red turbans and red dresses; (when reciting the hymn seen by) V<I>ri</I>sh&acirc;kapi (he shall) wear a dress and a mantle of many colours and so forth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_937"></A><A HREF="#fn_937"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. At the Agny&acirc;dh&acirc;na (sacrifice) the clothes (shall be made) of flax; on failure of such, (dresses) made of cotton or of wool are used.</p>  
<p>11. Clothes defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen and the like (shall be) cleaned with earth, water and the like.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_938"></A><A HREF="#fn_938"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>

<p>14. (Let him) not (use) a mantle which has been wrapped (round the loins, or) on which he has been lying (in his bed), without washing it.</p>  
<p>15: Let him not employ for the gods anything used by men without beating it on a stone.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_941"></A><A HREF="#fn_941"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. If solid earth is defiled, (it must be) smeared with cowdung.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_942"></A><A HREF="#fn_942"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. Loose (earth must be cleansed by) ploughing,</p>  
<p>18. Moist (earth) by bringing pure (earth) and covering (it with that).</p>  
<p>19. Land is purified in four (ways), by being trod on by cows, by digging, by lighting a fire on it, by rain falling on it,</p>  
<p>20. Fifthly by smearing it with cowdung, and sixthly through (the lapse of) time.</p>  
<p>21. Grass placed on unconsecrated ground (must be) washed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_943"></A><A HREF="#fn_943"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>

<p>23. Small pieces of sacred fuel (shall be purified) in the same manner.</p>  
<p>24. Large pieces of wood (must be) washed and dried.</p>

<p>26. Wooden vessels which have been touched by impure men (shall be) scraped;</p>  
<p>27. (And) those which are defiled by stains of remnants (shall be) planed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_945"></A><A HREF="#fn_945"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>

<p>29. These (rules must be followed) except in case a (special) injunction (is given);</p>  
<p>30. Thus, for instance, (purification by) washing with Ku<I>s</I>a grass and water (is prescribed) on all the following (occasions, viz.) at the Agnihotra, the Gharmo<I>k</I><I>kh</I>ish<I>t</I>a, the Dadhigharma, the Ku<I>n</I><I>d</I>ap&acirc;yin&acirc;m Ayana, the Utsargi<I>n</I>&acirc;m Ayana, the D&acirc;ksh&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a sacrifice, the Ardhodaya, the <I>K</I>atu<I>s</I><I>k</I>akra, and the Brahmaudanas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_947"></A><A HREF="#fn_947"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>31. (Again) at all Soma-sacrifices (the cups must be) cleaned with water only on (the heap of earth called) the M&acirc;r<I>g</I>&acirc;liya;</p>  
<p>32. If these same (cups are defiled) by urine, ordure,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_948"></A><A HREF="#fn_948"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_932"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_932">186:1</A>-2. <b>13</b>. See also above, I, 5, 10, 4. This Adhy&acirc;ya and the next ought to have been given in the <I>S</I>rauta S&ucirc;tra.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_933"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_933">186:3</A> Rig-veda VII, 56, 12; Taittir&icirc;ya-br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a II, 8, 5, 5. The meaning of the last portion of the verse is somewhat doubtful. S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a gives two different explanations and Govinda a third.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_934"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_934">186:4</A> Govinda points out that the dresses of the sacrificer and of his priests must be white, because farther on (S&ucirc;tras 9-10) other colours are specially prescribed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_935"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_935">186:5</A> Govinda thinks that the word <I>k</I>a, 'as well as,' is intended to include the lookers-on.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_936"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_936">187:6</A> Regarding the ceremony called Prakrama, literally 'stepping forward from the G&acirc;rhapatya fire,' see S&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a on Taitt. Br. I, 1, 4, 1. It opens the Agny&acirc;dh&acirc;na rite.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_937"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_937">187:9</A> Govinda states that the words iti ka, and so forth,' are intended to include other incantations. The V<I>ri</I>sh&acirc;kapi hymn is found Rig-veda X, 86.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_938"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_938">187:11</A> Govinda states that the word iti, 'and the like,' is intended to include cowdung, cow's urine, and other substances used for purification.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_939"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_939">187:12</A> Govinda states that there is a tree called T<I>ri</I>pa, the bark of which is used for dresses. V<I>ri</I>kala, which has been left untranslated, is explained by <I>s</I>akama, a word which is not found in our dictionaries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_940"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_940">188:13</A> Govinda says that, as the treatment of valkala, bark-dresses,' has not been prescribed, the meaning of the S&ucirc;tra can only be, that bark-dresses and black-buck skins are to be treated alike, i.e. that they are to be cleaned with Bel-nut and rice; see above.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_941"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_941">188:15</A> Govinda explains apalp&ucirc;litam by 'without beating it with the hand on a stone.' He mentions as an instance the skin which is used in preparing the Soma.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_942"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_942">188:16</A> According to Govinda, solid earth is such on which the fire-altars are built.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_943"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_943">188:21</A> E.g. grass intended for the barhis, if it has been placed on a spot which has not been sprinkled with water.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_944"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_944">188:22</A> 'Defiled out of one's sight,' i.e. brought by <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_945"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_945">189:27</A> Govinda says that this rule is optional.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_946"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_946">189:28</A> Govinda adds that fuel, Ku<I>s</I>a grass, and the like, which have been defiled in this manner, must also be thrown away.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_947"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_947">189:30</A> Regarding the Dadhigharma, a homa, see Vait&acirc;na S&ucirc;tra 21,18; regarding the Ku<I>n</I><I>d</I>ap&acirc;yin&acirc;m Ayana, &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana <I>S</I>rauta S&ucirc;tra XII, 4; and regarding the D&acirc;ksh&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a sacrifice, a variety of the new and full-moon offering, &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana II, 14. The Ardhodaya is possibly the vrata of that name mentioned in the Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as, According to Govinda, the <I>K</I>atu<I>s</I><I>k</I>akra, which is otherwise known as a T&acirc;ntric rite, is a sacrifice, ish<I>t</I>ak&acirc;kosh<I>t</I>a (?) madhyavasanto ya<I>g</I>ante tathetaradaya<I>h</I> (?). Regarding the Brahmaudana, see &Acirc;<I>s</I>val&acirc;yana <I>S</I>rauta S&ucirc;tra I, 4.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_948"></A><A HREF="sbe1446.htm#fr_948">189:32</A> Govinda says that the injunction to throw away defiled <A NAME="page_191"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 191</FONT></A> vessels has been repeated, in order to prevent a misconception. For as Soma is said to be a great means of purification, it might be supposed that it was powerful enough to prevent the defilement of vessels into which it is poured at a sacrifice. But compare the next S&ucirc;tras.</P>
