### PRA*S*NA IV, ADHYÂYA 3.

1\. We will explain the (secret) penances which are not prescribed (by
others, but by the offender himself, and) particularly what shall be
done in (case) faults (have been committed) by men who, with
concentrated minds, (are) intent (on the performance of their
duties). <span id="fr_1423"></span>[1](#fn_1423)

2\. (Such a man) may sip water, (in order to atone) for all mortal sins,
reciting the syllable Om and all the Vyâh*ri*tis. <span
id="fr_1424"></span>[2](#fn_1424)

3\. When he sips water the first time, he gladdens the Rig-veda, the
second time the Ya*g*ur-veda, the third time the Sâma-veda. <span
id="fr_1425"></span>[3](#fn_1425)

4\. When he wipes (his lips) the first time, he gladdens the
Atharva-veda, the second time the Itihâsas and Purâ*n*as.

5\. When he sprinkles water on the right hand, the feet, the head, the
heart, the nostrils, the eyes, the ears, and the navel, he gladdens the
trees and herbs and all deities. Therefore he is freed from all sin by
sipping water.

6\. Or let him offer in the fire eight pieces of sacred fuel, reciting
(the following) eight (texts): 'Thou art the expiation of sin committed
by the gods, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by men,
Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by the manes, Svâhâ;'
'Thou art the expiation of sin committed by myself, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art
the expiation of the sift which we have committed either by day or by
night, Svâhâ;" Thou art the expiation of the sin which we have committed
either sleeping or waking, Svâhâ;' 'Thou art the expiation of the sin
which we have committed either intentionally or unintentionally, Svâhâ;'
Thou art the expiation of every sin, Svâhâ.' <span
id="fr_1426"></span>[6](#fn_1426)

7\. When he has offered (these eight oblations) he will be freed from
all guilt.

8\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The Aghamarsha*n*a, the
Devak*ri*ta, the Suddhavatîs, the Taratsamâs, the Kûshmâ*nd*îs, the
Pâvamânîs, the Virâ*g*âs, the M*ri*tyulâṅgala, the Durgâ (Sâvitrî), the
Vyâh*ri*tis, and the Rudras (are texts) which are very efficacious for
effacing sin.' <span id="fr_1427"></span>[8](#fn_1427)
