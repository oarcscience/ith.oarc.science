### PRA*S*NA I, ADHYÂYA 4, KA*ND*IKÂ 6.

1\. Now (those who know the law) prescribe the carrying of a
waterpot. <span id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_810)

2\. It is declared (in the Vedas) that fire (resides) in the right ear
of a goat, in the right hand of a Brâhma*n*a, likewise in water (and) in
a bundle of Ku*s*a grass. Therefore after personal purification let him
wipe (his water-vessel) on all sides with his (right) hand, (reciting
the mantra), 'Blaze up, O fire;' for that (is called) encircling it with
fire and is preferable to heating (the pot on the fire). <span
id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_811)

3\. With reference to this matter they prescribe also (the following
rules): 'If he thinks in his heart that (the pot) has been slightly
defiled, let him light Ku*s*a or (other) grass and heat (the pot) on all
sides, keeping his right hand turned towards it.' <span
id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_812)

4\. 'If (pots) have been touched by crows, dogs, or <span
id="fr_813"></span>[4](#fn_813)

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

other (unclean animals, they shall be heated, until they are of) the
colour of fire, after the (paryagnikara*n*a has been performed).'

5\. (Pots) which have been defiled by urine, ordure, blood, semen, and
the like must be thrown away. <span id="fr_814"></span>[5](#fn_814)

6\. If his waterpot has been broken, let him offer one hundred
(oblations) reciting the Vyâh*ri*tis, or mutter (the Vyâh*ri*tis as
often). <span id="fr_815"></span>[6](#fn_815)

7\. (Reciting the text), 'Earth went to earth, the mother joined the
mother; may we have sons and cattle; may he who hates us be destroyed,'
he shall collect the fragments, throw them into water, repeat the
Gâyatrî at least ten times and take again another (pot). <span
id="fr_816"></span>[7](#fn_816)

8\. Taking refuge with Varu*n*a, (he shall recite the mantra), 'That
(belongs) to thee, Varu*n*a; again to me, Om,' (and) meditate on the
indestructible. <span id="fr_817"></span>[8](#fn_817)

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

9\. 'If he has received (the new vessel) from a *S*ûdra, let him recite
(the Gâyatrî) one hundred (times). (If he has received it) from a
Vai*s*ya, fifty (repetitions of the Gâyatrî) are prescribed, but (on
receiving it) from a Kshatriya twenty-five, (and on taking it) from a
Brâhma*n*a ten.' <span id="fr_818"></span>[9](#fn_818)

10\. Those who recite the Veda are doubtful whether he shall fetch water
after the sun has, set or shall not fetch it.

11\. The most excellent (opinion is) that he may fetch it.

12\. Let him restrain his breath, while he fetches water.

13\. Fire, forsooth, takes up water. <span
id="fr_819"></span>[13](#fn_819)

14\. It is declared (in the Veda), 'When he has washed his hands and
feet with water from his water-vessel, he is impure for others, as long
as the moisture (remains). He purifies himself only. Let him not perform
other religious rites (with water from his pot).' <span
id="fr_820"></span>[14](#fn_820)

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

15\. Baudhâyana (says), 'Or if on the occasion of each personal
purification (he washes himself with other water) up to the wrist, (he
will become) pure.' <span id="fr_821"></span>[15](#fn_821)

16\. Now they quote also (the following verses):

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_810"></span>[160:1](sbe1439.htm#fr_810) **6**. As Govinda
observes, the rules regarding the waterpot (kama*nd*alu) are introduced
here in connexion with I, 3, 5, 4.

<span id="fn_811"></span>[160:2](sbe1439.htm#fr_811) Vasish*th*a XII,
15-16. The mantra is found, Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 1, 4.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[160:3](sbe1439.htm#fr_812) The word
upadi*s*anti, 'they prescribe,' stands at the end of Sûtra 4, as it
refers to both rules.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[160:4](sbe1439.htm#fr_813) Vasish*th*a III,
59. The paryagnikara*n*a is the rite prescribed in Sûtra 2.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[161:5](sbe1439.htm#fr_814) Vasish*th*a III,
59.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[161:6](sbe1439.htm#fr_815) Regarding the
Vyâh*ri*tis, see Gautama I, 51.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[161:7](sbe1439.htm#fr_816) Govinda says that
Vâmadeva is the *Ri*shi of the mantra. The fragments of the pot are to
be thrown into a river or tank, in order to preserve them from
defilement. See also Journ. Bo. Br. Roy. As. Soc., No. XXXIV A, p. 55
note.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[161:8](sbe1439.htm#fr_817) 'Taking refuge with
Varu*n*a, i.e. saying, "I flee for safety to Varu*n*a." (The words),
"That for thee, Varu*n*a, again to me, Om," (are) the mantras (to be
recited) on taking (a new vessel). Its meaning is this: "Those fragments
which I have thrown into the water shall belong to thee, Varu*n*a,"
(Saying), "Come, thou (who art) a lord of water-vessels, again to me,
Om," he shall meditate on another visible pot as indestructible, i.e. at
the end of the Vedic (word) "Om," let him meditate, (i.e.) recollect,
that not everything will be turned topsy-turvy, (but that some things
are) also indestructible, i.e. that that is not destroyed, does not
perish.'--Govinda. The explanation of the last clause of our Sûtra seems
to be that, on pronouncing the syllable (akshara) Om, the reciter is
<span id="page_162">p. 162</span> to recollect the etymological import
of the word akshara, 'indestructible,' and thus to guard the new vessel
against the mishap which befell the old one.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[162:9](sbe1439.htm#fr_818) According to
Govinda, either the pra*n*ava, the syllable Om, or the Gâyatrî are the
mantras to be recited, and the recitation is a penance to be performed
when the vessel is received. The MSS. of the text mark the verse as
quotation by adding the word 'iti,' which the commentary omits.

<span id="fn_819"></span>[162:13](sbe1439.htm#fr_819) According to
Govinda, a Brâhma*n*a who goes to fetch water at night, which he may
want for personal purification, is ordered to restrain his breath,
because thereby the air in the body becomes strong, and fire or heat
(agni) is produced. Now as at night the sun is stated to enter the fire
and to become subject to it, a Brâhma*n*a, who by restraining his breath
has produced fire, has secured the presence of the sun, when he goes to
fetch water.

<span id="fn_820"></span>[162:14](sbe1439.htm#fr_820) Govinda expressly
states that the word vie, vi*gñ*âyate, 'it is declared,'<span
id="page_163">p. 163</span> literally, 'it is distinctly known,' always
indicates that the passage quoted is taken from the Veda. The rites for
which water from the waterpot is not to be used, are libations to the
manes, the gods, and the fire. See also below, I, 4, 7, 5.

<span id="fn_821"></span>[163:15](sbe1439.htm#fr_821) The words enclosed
between parentheses are Govinda's.
