<p>22. But a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who repeatedly (and intentionally partakes) of liquor extracted from rice, shall drink (liquor of) the same (kind) boiling hot. 'He becomes pure after death.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>

<p>25. Let the slayer of a learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a kindle a fire and offer (therein the following eight oblations, consisting of portions of his own body),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_599"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>

<p>30. To this (effect) they quote also (the following verse): 'By saying to an outcast, "O thou outcast!" or to a thief, "O thou thief!" a man incurs a guilt as great as (that of the offender). (If he) falsely (accuses anybody of such offences), his guilt will be twice as great.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_603"></A><A HREF="#fn_603"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>

<p>35. We will explain (the term) Atrey&icirc;. They declare that she who has bathed after temporary uncleanness is an Atrey&icirc;.</p>  
<p>36. 'For if (the husband) approaches her at that (time), he will have offspring.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_608"></A><A HREF="#fn_608"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>37. (For killing a female of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste) who is not an &Acirc;trey&icirc;, (the penance prescribed) for the murder of a Kshatriya (must be performed),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_609"></A><A HREF="#fn_609"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A></p>

<p>41. If a man has stolen gold belonging to a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, he shall run, with flying hair, to the king, (exclaiming) 'Ho, I am a thief; sir, punish me!' The king shall give him a weapon made of Udumbara wood; with that he shall kill himself.

It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure after death.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_611"></A><A HREF="#fn_611"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A></p>  
<p>43. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Hear, (how) the bodies of those who having committed various crimes died a long time ago, and were (afterwards) born again, are (marked);'</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>

<p>44. 'A thief will have deformed nails, the murderer of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a will be afflicted with white leprosy, but he who has drunk spirituous liquor will have black teeth, and the violator of his Guru's bed will suffer from skin diseases.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_612"></A><A HREF="#fn_612"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A></p>  
<p>45. Property received from outcasts, after forming alliances with them either by (teaching) the Veda (and by sacrificing) or by marriage, must be relinquished. Let him not associate with such (men).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_613"></A><A HREF="#fn_613"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A></p>  
<p>46. It is declared in the Veda that (he who has associated with outcasts) becomes pure by reciting the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; (of his Veda), proceeding in a northerly direction and fasting.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_614"></A><A HREF="#fn_614"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_602"></A><A HREF="sbe1423.htm#fr_602">106:29</A> Taken by itself the S&ucirc;tra would seem to refer to the maxim that a free confession reduces the guilt of the offender (Manu XI, 228). But on account of the next S&ucirc;tra it is necessary to assume, with K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita, that half the guilt of a crime, of which another man justly accuses an offender, falls on the accuser, while the <A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A> offender's guilt becomes less by the publication of his misdeed.
