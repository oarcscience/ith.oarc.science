### Footnotes

<span id="fn_715"></span>[136:4](sbe1432.htm#fr_715) **XXIX**. This
Sûtra, which recommends self-cremation, is of some importance, as it
confirms the teaching of the Purâ*n*as and explains the accounts of the
Greeks regarding the self-immolation of Brâhma*n*as who visited Europe.

<span id="fn_716"></span>[136:9](sbe1432.htm#fr_716) Vish*n*u XCII, 21.

<span id="fn_717"></span>[136:12](sbe1432.htm#fr_717) Vish*n*u XCII, 27;
Manu IV, 232. 'Master of a harem,' i.e. the possessor of many beautiful
wives and concubines.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[137:14](sbe1432.htm#fr_718) Vish*n*u XCII, 31.
15. Vish*n*u XCII, 28.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[137:16](sbe1432.htm#fr_719) Vish*n*u XCII, 4.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita quotes a passage of the Matsya-purâ*n*a according
to which 'a bull's hide' is a, measure equal to 140 square hastas; see,
however, notes to Vish*n*u loc. cit. and V, 183.

<span id="fn_720"></span>[137:17](sbe1432.htm#fr_720) Manu IV, 229.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[137:18](sbe1432.htm#fr_721) Read in the text
vidhivaddânam kanyâdânena tatsamam.

<span id="fn_722"></span>[137:19](sbe1432.htm#fr_722)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita wrongly makes two Sûtras out of this verse.

<span id="fn_723"></span>[137:20](sbe1432.htm#fr_723)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita and MS. B. read, against the metre and sense,
yoginâ*m* sampûritam vidvân, another reading yoginâ*m* sa*m*matam
vidvân. F. reads yonasa*m*yurima*m* vidvân. I read yo ’nasûyurima*m*
vidvân.
