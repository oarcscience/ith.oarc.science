### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 7, KA*ND*IKÂ 13.

1\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'As cotton and reeds,
thrown into a fire, blaze up, even so all the guilt of him who
sacrifices to the soul is consumed;'

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

2\. (Moreover), 'He who eats merely (in order to satisfy his own hunger)
reaps only guilt. In vain (the fool) takes food.' <span
id="fr_1268"></span>[2](#fn_1268)

3\. Let him daily, both in the morning and in the evening, sacrifice in
this manner;

4, Or (he may offer) water in the evening.

5\. Now they quote also (the following verses): Let him first feed his
guests, next the pregnant women, then the infants and the aged,
thereafter the distressed and particularly the diseased. But he who eats
first, without having given (food) to those (persons) according to the
rule, does not know that he is being eaten. He does not eat, (but) he is
eaten.' <span id="fr_1269"></span>[5](#fn_1269)

6\. 'Let him eat silently what remains, (after he has given their
portions) to the manes, the gods, the servants, his parents, and his
Gurus; that is declared to be the rule of the sacred law.' <span
id="fr_1270"></span>[6](#fn_1270)

7\. Nov they quote also (the following verses): Eight mouthfuls are the
meal of an ascetic, sixteen that of a hermit in the woods, thirty-two
that of a householder, and an unlimited (quantity) that of a student.'

8\. 'An Agnihotrin, a draught-ox, and, a student, those three can do
their work only if they eat (much); without eating (much) they cannot do
it.'

9\. 'A householder, or a student who practises <span

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

austerity by fasting, becomes an Avakîr*n*in through the omission of the
sacrifice to the vital airs;'

10\. Except when he performs a penance. In the case of a penance that
(fasting) is the rule.

11\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'He who never eats
between the morning and the evening meals, (obtains the same reward as
he who) constantly fasts.'

12\. 'As in case one obtains no materials (for the sacrifice), one must
mutter the sacred texts to be recited at the Agnihotra, offered in the
three fires, even so one should mutter the texts to be recited at the
Prâ*n*âgnihotra, when one is prevented from dining.'

13\. 'He who acts thus, will become one with Brahman.' Thus spake
Pra*g*âpati (the lord of created beings).
