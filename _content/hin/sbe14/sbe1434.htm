<p>4. The practice of the <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>as (stands) third.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_731"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. <I>S</I>ish<I>t</I>as, forsooth, (are those) who are free from envy, free from pride, contented with a store of grain sufficient for ten days, free from covetousness, and free from hypocrisy, arrogance, greed, perplexity, and anger.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="#fn_732"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>7. On failure of them, an assembly consisting at least of ten members (shall decide disputed points of law).</p>  
<p>8. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Four men, who each know one of the four Vedas, a M&icirc;m&acirc;<I>m</I>saka, one who knows the A&#7749;gas, one who recites (the works on) the sacred law, and three Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as belonging to (three different) orders, (constitute) an assembly consisting, at least, of ten members.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_734"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. 'There may be five, or there may be three, or there may be one blameless man, who decides (questions regarding) the sacred law. But a thousand fools (can)not (do it).'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_735"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>

<p>12. 'Narrow and difficult to find is the path of the sacred law, towards which many gates lead. Hence, if there is a doubt, it must not be propounded by one man (only), however learned he may be.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>

<p>14. 'As wind and sun will make water, collected on a stone, disappear, even so the sin that (cleaves) to an offender completely vanishes like water.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_729"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_729">143:1</A> <b>I</b>. Vasish<I>th</I>a I, 4. Each Veda, i.e. each <I>s</I>&acirc;kh&acirc; or redaction of the Veda.--Govinda.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_730"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_730">143:3</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a I, 4. Govinda takes sm<I>ri</I>ti, 'the tradition,' in the sense of works (grantha) explaining the recollections of the <I>Ri</I>shis, and is no doubt right in doing so.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_731"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_731">143:4</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a I, 5. The explanation of &acirc;gama by 'practice' rests on the authority of Govinda and the parallel passages where <I>s</I>&icirc;la and &acirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;ra, 'conduct,' are used.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_732"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_732">143:5</A> &Acirc;pastamba I, 7, 20, 8; Gautama XXVIII, 48. Kumbhidh&acirc;nya, translated according to Govinda by 'contented with a store of grain sufficient for ten days,' means, according to others, 'contented with a store of grain sufficient for six days or for a year.'</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_733"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_733">143:6</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a VI, 43. Govinda omits the word 'iti,' given by the <A NAME="page_144"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 144</FONT></A> MSS. after the verse, whereby it is marked as a quotation. 'The appendages,' i.e. the Itih&acirc;sas and Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as.--Govinda.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_734"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_734">144:8</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a III, 20. Govinda, quoting Gautama XXVIII, 49, says that V&acirc;naprasthas cannot serve as members of Parishads, because they live in the forest. He also notices a different reading, not found in my MSS. '&Acirc;<I>s</I>ramasth&acirc;s trayo mukhy&acirc;<I>h</I>.' He asserts that thereby professed students are intended, because professed students are declared to be particularly holy in the Dharmaskandha-br&acirc;hmana.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_735"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_735">144:9</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a III, 7. Itare, translated by 'fools,' means literally, those different from the persons enumerated in the preceding verse.' Govinda remarks that according to S&ucirc;tra 12 one learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a must be taken only in cases of the most pressing necessity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_736"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_736">144:10</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a III, 11.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_737"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_737">145:11</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a III, 6.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_738"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_738">145:12</A> The 'gates' of the sacred law are the Vedas, the Sm<I>ri</I>tis, and the practice of the Sish<I>t</I>as. They are many, because the redactions of the Vedas and Sm<I>ri</I>tis are numerous and the practices vary in different countries.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_739"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_739">145:14</A> I.e. provided the offender performs the penance imposed by learned and virtuous Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as. Pra<I>n</I>&acirc;<I>s</I>ayet, 'will make disappear,' is ungrammatical, as the subject stands in the dual. Grammatical accuracy has probably been sacrificed to the exigencies of the metre.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_740"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_740">145:15</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a XIX, 9. <I>S</I>ar&icirc;ram, literally 'the body,' means here the constitution, which may be bilious, 'windy,' and so forth. &Acirc;yu<I>h</I>, literally 'life' or 'long life,' has been translated by 'knowledge,' in accordance with Govinda's explanation <I>g</I><I>&ntilde;</I>&acirc;nam. As the word vaya<I>h</I>, 'age,' also occurs in this verse, it is clear that &acirc;yu<I>h</I> cannot have its usual meaning.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_741"></A><A HREF="sbe1434.htm#fr_741">146:16</A> Vasish<I>th</I>a III, 5. The two copies of the commentary omit this S&ucirc;tra, though it is quoted in the explanation of S&ucirc;tra 9. The best MSS. repeat the last words of the S&ucirc;tra in order to show that the Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc; ends here. The same practice is observed, though not quite regularly, in the sequel.</P>
