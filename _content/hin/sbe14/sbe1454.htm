<p>2. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'It is declared that a female who has been purchased for money is not a wife. She cannot (assist) at sacrifices offered to the gods or the manes. K&acirc;<I>s</I>yapa has stated that she is a slave.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1031"></A><A HREF="#fn_1031"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p>3. 'Those wicked men who, seduced by greed, give away a daughter for a fee, who (thus) sell themselves and commit a great crime, fall (after death) into a dreadful place of punishment and destroy their family down to the seventh (generation). Moreover they will repeatedly die and be born again. All (this) is declared (to happen), if a fee (is taken).'</p>  
<p>4. On the day of the full moon, on the eighth day (of each half month), on the day of the new moon, on the appearance of a meteor, on the occasion of an earthquake, on visiting a burial-ground, and on the death of the king of the country, of a <I>S</I>rotriya or of one who has the same Guru (sat&icirc;rthya), the study of the Veda must be discontinued for a day and a night.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1032"></A><A HREF="#fn_1032"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. (The study of the Veda must be interrupted) while (a strong) wind (blows), a foul smell (is perceptible), or hoar-frost (lies on the ground), when dancing (is going on), and while the sounds of singing, musical instruments, weeping, or of the S&acirc;man (melodies are audible).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1033"></A><A HREF="#fn_1033"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. When thunder, lightning, and rain come together, (the interruption shall last) three days except in the rainy season.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1034"></A><A HREF="#fn_1034"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

<p>7. In the rainy season, too, (the reading must be interrupted) until the same hour of the (next) day or night, (if thunder and lightning come together), not on account of rain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1035"></A><A HREF="#fn_1035"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. If (he has) received anything or dined on the occasion of a sacrifice in honour of the manes, (he shall not read) during the remainder of the day,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1036"></A><A HREF="#fn_1036"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. (Nor) after meals until (the food) has been digested.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1037"></A><A HREF="#fn_1037"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. For the hand of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is his mouth.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1038"></A><A HREF="#fn_1038"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>11. Now they quote also (the following verse): According to the revealed texts there is no difference whether one has eaten or received (a present at a <I>S</I>r&acirc;ddha).'</p>  
<p>12. (A student shall discontinue the study of the Veda) during three days in case his father has died.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1039"></A><A HREF="#fn_1039"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. 'Of two kinds, forsooth, is the virile energy of a famous Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who is learned in the Vedas, (that which resides) above the navel and the other (that resides) below the' navel. Through that which&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1040"></A><A HREF="#fn_1040"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>

<p>(resides) above the navel, his offspring is produced when he initiates Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, when he teaches them, when he causes them to offer sacrifices, when he makes them holy. All these are his children. But through that which resides below the navel the children of his body are produced. Therefore they never say to a <I>S</I>rotriya who is versed in the Vedas, 'Thou art destitute of offspring.'</p>  
<p>14. 'Therefore a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a has two names, two mouths, two kinds of virile energy, and two births.'</p>  
<p>15. (Let him discontinue the recitation of the Veda) as long as he is within hearing or sight of <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras and Apap&acirc;tras.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1041"></A><A HREF="#fn_1041"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. When at night the howl of a solitary jackal is heard, he shall not study until he has slept.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1042"></A><A HREF="#fn_1042"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. Let him not study in the evening and morning twilights nor on the Parva-days.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1043"></A><A HREF="#fn_1043"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>18. He shall not eat meat nor approach his wife (on those days).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1044"></A><A HREF="#fn_1044"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>19. It is declared in the Veda, 'For on the Parva-days the R&acirc;kshasas and the Pi<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>as roam about (in order to injure men).'</p>  
<p>20. And on (the appearance of) other omens and portents (he shall not repeat the Veda), except mentally, during a day and a night.</p>

<p>21. The mental recitation of the Veda must also be interrupted on births and deaths (occurring in the family).</p>  
<p>22. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The eighth day destroys the teacher, the fourteenth destroys the pupil, the fifteenth destroys learning; therefore let him avoid (studying the Veda) on the Parva-days.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1045"></A><A HREF="#fn_1045"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>

'Ten virtuous sons and daughters (spring) from a Daiva marriage, ten from a Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya marriage. It is declared in the Veda that the son of a wife wedded according to the Br&acirc;hma rite (sanctifies) ten ancestors, ten descendants, and oneself.' 2. 'The power of learning the Veda also <A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A> belongs to such sons.' None of my MSS. of the text has these words, and they are suspicious, because the phrase 'Now they quote also' usually precedes verses only. The Dekhan and Gu<I>g</I>ar&acirc;t MSS., except K., omit these and the next S&ucirc;tra too.</P>

Govinda states that the precise meaning of an&ucirc;<I>k</I>&acirc;na, 'versed or learned in the Veda,' is 'one who knows the Veda, its meaning, and the A&#7749;gas: See also Baudh&acirc;yana G<I>ri</I>hya-s&ucirc;tra I, 10, 5.</P>
