### CHAPTER XVII.

1\. The father throws his debts on the (son) and obtains immortality if
he sees the face of a living son. <span id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_486)

2\. It is declared in the Veda, 'Endless are the worlds of those who
have sons; there is no place for the man who is destitute of male
offspring.' <span id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_487)

3\. There is a curse (in the Veda), 'May our enemies be destitute of
offspring.' <span id="fr_488"></span>[3](#fn_488)

4\. There is also (the following) passage of the Veda, 'May I obtain, O
Agni, immortality by offspring.' <span id="fr_489"></span>[4](#fn_489)

5\. 'Through a son he conquers the worlds, through a grandson he obtains
immortality, but through his son's grandson he gains the world of the
sun.' <span id="fr_490"></span>[5](#fn_490)

6\. There is a dispute (among the wise; some say), The son belongs to
the husband of the wife;' (and some say), 'The son belongs to the
begetter.' <span id="fr_491"></span>[6](#fn_491)

7\. With respect to this (matter) they quote also on both sides verses
like the following:

8\. (Some say), 'If (one man's) bull were to beget a hundred calves on
another man's cows, they would belong to the owner of the cows; in vain
would the bull have spent his strength.' <span
id="fr_492"></span>[8](#fn_492)

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

9\. (Others say), 'Carefully watch the procreation of your offspring,
lest strangers sow seed on your soil; in the next world the son belongs
to the begetter; (by carelessness) a husband makes (the possession of)
offspring in vain.' <span id="fr_493"></span>[9](#fn_493)

10\. If amongst many brothers who are begotten by one father, one have a
son, they all have offspring through that son; thus says the Veda. <span
id="fr_494"></span>[10](#fn_494)

11\. If among many wives of one husband, one have a son, they all have
offspring through that son; thus says the Veda. <span
id="fr_495"></span>[11](#fn_495)

12\. Twelve (kinds of) sons only are noticed by the ancients. <span
id="fr_496"></span>[12](#fn_496)

13\. The first (among these is the son) begotten by the husband himself
on his legally married wife. <span id="fr_497"></span>[13](#fn_497)

14\. The second is the son of a wife (who is begotten) on failure of the
(first) on a (wife or widow duly) authorised (thereto, by a
kinsman). <span id="fr_498"></span>[14](#fn_498)

15\. The third is an appointed daughter. <span
id="fr_499"></span>[15](#fn_499)

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

16\. It is declared in the Veda, 'A maiden who has no brothers comes
back to the male ancestors (of her own family); returning she becomes
their son.' <span id="fr_500"></span>[16](#fn_500)

17\. With reference to this (matter there is) a verse (to be spoken by
the father when appointing daughter), 'I shall give thee a brotherless
damsel, decked with ornaments; the son whom she may bear, shall be my
son.' <span id="fr_501"></span>[17](#fn_501)

18\. The fourth is the son of a remarried woman. <span
id="fr_502"></span>[18](#fn_502)

19\. She is called remarried (punarbhû) who leaving the husband of her
youth, and having lived with others, re-enters his family; <span
id="fr_503"></span>[19](#fn_503)

20\. And she is called remarried who leaving an impotent, outcast or mad
husband, or after the death of her husband takes another lord. <span
id="fr_504"></span>[20](#fn_504)

21\. The fifth is the son of an unmarried damsel. <span
id="fr_505"></span>[21](#fn_505)

22\. They declare that the son whom an unmarried damsel produces through
lust in her father's house, is the son of his maternal
grandfather. <span id="fr_506"></span>[22](#fn_506)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

23\. Now they quote also (the following verse): If an unmarried daughter
bear a son begotten by a man of equal caste, the maternal grandfather
has a son through him; he shall offer the funeral cake, and take the
wealth (of his grandfather).'

24\. (A male child) secretly born in the house is the sixth. <span
id="fr_507"></span>[24](#fn_507)

25\. They declare that these (six) are heirs and kinsmen, preservers
from a great danger. <span id="fr_508"></span>[25](#fn_508)

26\. Now among those (sons) who are not heirs, but kinsmen, the first is
he who is received with a pregnant bride. <span
id="fr_509"></span>[26](#fn_509)

27\. (The son of a damsel) who is married pregnant (is called) a son
received with the bride (saho*dh*a).

28\. The second is the adopted son,

29\. (He) whom his father and his mother give (in adoption). <span
id="fr_510"></span>[29](#fn_510)

30\. (The son) bought is the third.

31\. That is explained by (the story of) Suna*hs*epa.

32\. 'Hari*sk*andra, forsooth, was a king. He bought the son of
A*g*îgarta Sauyavasi. <span id="fr_511"></span>[32](#fn_511)

33\. The fourth is (the son) self-given. <span
id="fr_512"></span>[33](#fn_512)

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

34\. That is (likewise) explained by (the story of) Suna*hs*epa.

35\. 'Suna*hs*epa, forsooth, when tied to the sacrificial stake, praised
the gods; there the gods loosened his bonds. To him poke (each of) the
officiating priests, "He shall be my son." He did not agree to their
(request. Then) they made him make (this) agreement, "He shall be the
son of him whom he chooses." Vi*s*vâmitra was the Hot*ri* priest at that
(sacrifice). He became his son.'

36\. The son cast off is the fifth. <span
id="fr_513"></span>[36](#fn_513)

37\. (He is called so) who, cast off by his father and his mother, is
received (as a son).

38\. They declare that the son of a woman of the *S*ûdra caste is the
sixth. These (six) are kinsmen, not heirs. <span
id="fr_514"></span>[38](#fn_514)

39\. Now they quote also (the following rule): 'These (last-mentioned)
six (sons) shall take the heritage of him who has no heir belonging to
the first-mentioned six (classes).

40\. Now (follow the rules regarding) the partition of the (paternal)
estate among brothers: <span id="fr_515"></span>[40](#fn_515)

41\. And (let it be delayed) until those (widows) who have no offspring,
(but are supposed to be pregnant), bear sons. <span
id="fr_516"></span>[41](#fn_516)

42\. Let the eldest take a double share, <span
id="fr_517"></span>[42](#fn_517)

43\. And a tithe of the kine and horses.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

44\. The goats, the sheep, and the house belong to the youngest,

45\. Black iron, the utensils, and the furniture to the middlemost.

46\. Let the daughters divide the nuptial present of their mother. <span
id="fr_518"></span>[46](#fn_518)

47\. If a Brâhma*n*a has issue by wives belonging to the Brâhma*n*a,
Kshatriya, and Vai*s*ya classes respectively, <span
id="fr_519"></span>[47](#fn_519)

48\. The son of the Brâhma*n*a wife shall receive three shares,

49\. The son of the Kshatriya wife two shares,

50\. The other (sons) shall inherit equal shares.

51\. And if one of the (brothers) has gained something by his own
(effort), he shall receive a double share. <span
id="fr_520"></span>[51](#fn_520)

52\. But those who have entered a different order receive no
share, <span id="fr_521"></span>[52](#fn_521)

53\. Nor (those who are) eunuchs, madmen, or outcasts. <span
id="fr_522"></span>[53](#fn_522)

54\. Eunuchs and madmen (have a claim to) maintenance. <span
id="fr_523"></span>[54](#fn_523)

55\. The widow of a deceased person shall sleep <span
id="fr_524"></span>[55](#fn_524)

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

on the ground during six months, practising religious vows and
abstaining from pungent condiments and salt.

56\. After the completion of six months she shall bathe, and offer a
funeral oblation to her husband. (Then) her father or her brother shall
assemble the Gurus who taught or sacrificed (for the deceased) and his
relatives, and shall appoint her (to raise issue to her deceased
husband). <span id="fr_525"></span>[56](#fn_525)

57\. Let him not appoint a (widow who is) mad, ill-conducted, or
diseased, <span id="fr_526"></span>[57](#fn_526)

58\. Nor one who is very aged.

59\. Sixteen years (after maturity is the period for appointing a
widow);

60\. Nor (shall an appointment be made) if the (male entitled to
approach the widow) is sickly.

61\. Let him approach (the widow) in the muhûarta sacred to.
Pra*g*âpati, (behaving) like a husband, without (amorously) dallying
with her, and without abusing or ill-treating her. <span
id="fr_527"></span>[61](#fn_527)

62\. Let her obtain (the expenses for) food, raiment, baths, and
unguents from (the estate of) her former (husband).

63\. They declare that a son begotten on (a widow who has) not been
(duly) appointed, belongs to the begetter. <span
id="fr_528"></span>[63](#fn_528)

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

64\. If she was (appointed, the child belongs) to both the males
connected with the appointment. <span id="fr_529"></span>[64](#fn_529)

65\. No appointment (shall be made) through a desire to obtain the
estate. <span id="fr_530"></span>[65](#fn_530)

66\. Some say, 'Or, one may appoint (a widow out of covetousness), after
imposing a penance.' <span id="fr_531"></span>[66](#fn_531)

67, A maiden who has attained puberty shall wait for three years. <span
id="fr_532"></span>[67](#fn_532)

68\. After three years (have passed), she may take a. husband of equal
caste.

69\. Now they quote also (the following verses) But if through a
father's negligence a maiden is here given away after the suitable age
has passed, she who was waiting (for a husband) destroys him who gives
her away, just as the fee which is paid too late to the teacher
(destroys the pupil).'

70\. 'Out of fear of the appearance of the menses let the father marry
his daughter while she still runs about naked. For if she stays (in the
house) after the age of puberty, sin falls on the father.' <span
id="fr_533"></span>[70](#fn_533)

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

71\. 'As often as the courses of a maiden, who is filled with desire,
and demanded in marriage by men of equal caste, recur, so often her
father and her mother are guilty of (the crime of) slaying an embryo;
that is a rule of the sacred law.' <span
id="fr_534"></span>[71](#fn_534)

72\. 'If the betrothed of a maiden die after she has been promised to
him verbally, and by (a libation of) water, but before she was married
with (the recitation of) sacred texts, she belongs to her father
alone.' <span id="fr_535"></span>[72](#fn_535)

73\. 'If a damsel has been abducted by force, and not been wedded with
sacred texts, she may lawfully be given to another man; she is even like
a maiden.'

74\. 'If a damsel at the death of her husband had been merely wedded by
(the recitation of) sacred texts, and if the marriage had not been
consummated, she may be married again.'

75\. The wife of an emigrant shall wait for five years. <span
id="fr_536"></span>[75](#fn_536)

76\. After five years (have passed), she may go (to seek) her husband.

77\. If for reasons connected with spiritual or with money matters she
be unwilling to leave her home, she must act in the same manner as if
(her husband were) dead.

78\. In this manner a wife of the Brâhma*n*a caste who has issue (shall
wait) five years, and one who has no issue, four years; a wife of the
Kshatriya caste who has issue, five years, and one who has no issue,
three years; a wife of the Vai*s*ya caste who

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

has issue, four years, and one who has no issue, two years; a wife of
the *S*ûdra caste who has issue, three years, and one who has no issue,
one year.

79\. After that among those who are united (with her husband) in
interest, or by birth, or by the funeral cake, or by libations of water,
or by descent from the same family, each earlier named person is more
venerable than the following ones. <span
id="fr_537"></span>[79](#fn_537)

80\. But while a member of her family is living, she shall certainly not
go to a stranger.

81\. Let the Sapi*nd*as or the subsidiary sons divide the heritage of
him who has no heir of the first-mentioned six kinds. <span
id="fr_538"></span>[81](#fn_538)

82\. On failure of them the spiritual teacher and a pupil shall take the
inheritance. <span id="fr_539"></span>[82](#fn_539)

83\. On failure of those two the king inherits. <span
id="fr_540"></span>[83](#fn_540)

84\. But let the king not take (the estate) of a Brâhma*n*a.

85\. For the property of a Brâhma*n*a is a terrible poison.

86\. 'Poison they do not call the (worst) poison; the property of a
Brâhma*n*a is said to be the (most destructive) poison. Poison destroys
only one person, but the property of a Brâhma*n*a (him who takes it)
together with sons and grandsons.'

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

87\. He should give it to men who are well versed in the three
Vedas. <span id="fr_541"></span>[87](#fn_541)

CCIII; Mitâksharâ I, 11, 3; Vyavahâra Mayûkha IV, 4, 43. The curious
fact that Vasish*th*a here calls the appointed daughter a son may
perhaps be explained by a custom which, though rarely practised, still
occurs in Ka*s*mîr, and by which a brotherless maiden is given a male
name. A historical instance of this kind is mentioned in the
Râ*g*ataraṅgi*n*î, where it is stated that Kalyâ*n*adevî, princess of
Gau*d*a and wife of king *G*ayâpî*d*a, was called by her father
Kalyâ*n*amalla. When I collated this passage with the help of a
Ka*s*mîrian, I was told that a certain Brâhma*n*a, still living in
*S*rinagar, had changed the <span id="page_86">p. 86</span> name of his
only child, a daughter called Amrî, to the corresponding masculine form,
Amar*g*û, in order to secure to himself through her the same spiritual
benefits as if he had a son. It seems to me not improbable that
Vasish*th*a's Sûtra alludes to the same legal fiction, and that he
recommends in the first instance that the father is to make his daughter
a son by changing her name, and next to secure for himself her son, by
the verse quoted Sûtra 17.

'To both the males connected with the appointment,' i.e. to the deceased
husband for whose sake the appointment is made, and to the natural
father of the child, to whom the widow is made over.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[91:65](sbe1420.htm#fr_530) Colebrooke,
Mitâksharâ II, 1, 11. K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita thinks that the Sûtra forbids
an appointment which is made with the intention to secure the estate or
a share of the estate of the natural father, from whom the kshetra*g*a
son inherits also (Yâ*gñ*avalkya II, 127). But it seems equally probable
that it is intended to pre-vent a widow from agreeing to an appointment
in order to obtain control over her husband's estate.

K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita thinks that the rule refers to all cases of
appointment.

intended are, (1) brothers united in interest with her husband and other
coparceners, (2) separated brothers of the husband. (3) separated
blood-relations of the husband within six degrees, (4) separated
blood-relations of the husband within fourteen degrees, and (5) persons
bearing the same family name or, in the case of Brâhma*n*as, descended
from the same *Ri*shi.

who under ordinary circumstances do not inherit; see also above, Sûtra
39, and Gautama XXVIII, 34.
