### CHAPTER XII.

1\. Now, therefore, the duties of a Snâtaka (will be explained). <span
id="fr_335"></span>[1](#fn_335)

2\. Let him not beg from anybody except from a king and a pupil. <span
id="fr_336"></span>[2](#fn_336)

3\. But let him ask, if pressed by hunger, for some (small gift) only, a
cultivated or uncultivated field, a cow, a goat or a sheep, (or) at the
last extremity, for gold, grain or food. <span
id="fr_337"></span>[3](#fn_337)

4\. But the injunction (given by those who know the law) is, 'A Snâtaka
shall not be faint with hunger.' <span id="fr_338"></span>[4](#fn_338)

5\. Let him not dwell together with a person whose clothes are
foul; <span id="fr_339"></span>[5](#fn_339)

6\. (Let him not cohabit) with a woman during her courses,

7\. Nor with an unfit one. <span id="fr_340"></span>[7](#fn_340)

8\. Let him not be a stay-at-home. <span id="fr_341"></span>[8](#fn_341)

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

9\. Let him not step over a stretched rope to which a calf (or cow) is
tied. <span id="fr_342"></span>[9](#fn_342)

10\. Let him not look at the sun when he rises or sets. <span
id="fr_343"></span>[10](#fn_343)

12\. Nor spit into it.

13\. Let him ease himself, after wrapping up his head and covering the
ground with grass that is not fit to be used at a sacrifice, and turning
towards the north in the day-time, turning towards the south at night,
sitting with his face towards the north in the twilight. <span
id="fr_345"></span>[13](#fn_345)

14\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But Snâtakas shall
always wear a lower garment and an upper one, two sacrificial threads,
(shall carry) a staff and a vessel filled with water.' <span
id="fr_346"></span>[14](#fn_346)

15\. 'It is declared, that (a vessel becomes) pure (if cleaned) with
water, or with the hand, or with a stick, or with fire: Therefore he
shall clean (his) vessel with water and with his (right) hand.'

16\. 'For Manu, the lord of created beings, calls (this mode of
cleaning) encircling it-with fire.'

17\. He who is perfectly acquainted with (the rules of) purification
shall sip water (out of this vessel), after he has relieved the
necessities of nature.'

18\. Let him eat his food facing the east. <span
id="fr_347"></span>[18](#fn_347)

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

19\. Silently let him swallow the entire mouthful, (introducing it into

21\. Let him approach his wife in the proper season, except on the Parva
days. <span id="fr_349"></span>[21](#fn_349)

22\. Let him not commit a crime against nature (with her).

23\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'The ancestors of a
man-who commits an unnatural crime with a wedded wife, feed during that
month on his semen. All unnatural intercourse is against the sacred
law.'

24\. It is also declared in the Kâ*th*aka, '(When) the women (asked)
Indra, "May even those among us, who are soon to be mothers, (be allowed
to) cohabit with their husbands," he granted that wish.'

25\. Let him not ascend a tree. <span id="fr_350"></span>[25](#fn_350)

26\. Let him not descend into a well.

for permission. <span id="fr_352"></span>[30](#fn_352)

31\. Let him not dine together with his wife. For it is declared in the
Vâ*g*asaneyaka, His children will be destitute of manly vigour.' <span

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

39\. Let him not wear any visible wreath excepting a golden one; <span
id="fr_360"></span>[39](#fn_360)

40\. And let him disdain assemblies and crowds. <span
id="fr_361"></span>[40](#fn_361)

41\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'To deny the authority

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_335"></span>[59:1](sbe1415.htm#fr_335) **XII**. 'Now' marks
the beginning of a new topic. 'Therefore,' i.e. because the duties of a
Snâtaka have to be taught after those of a student.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[59:2](sbe1415.htm#fr_336) Manu IV, 33; Gautama
IX, 63.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[59:5](sbe1415.htm#fr_339)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, whom I have followed in the translation of this
Sûtra, thinks that it indicates the obligation of wearing clean clothes,
see e.g. Vish*n*u LXXI, 9. It seems to me, however, probable that its
real sense is, 'Let him not cohabit with a woman during her courses,'
and that the next Sûtra has to be read nâra*g*asvalayâ., 'Nor with one
of immature age.'

<span id="fn_340"></span>[59:7](sbe1415.htm#fr_340) 'An unfit one,'
i.e.' one of low caste' (hînâ).--K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita, Probably a sick
wife is meant, Gautama IX, 28.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[59:8](sbe1415.htm#fr_341) Gautama IX, 53.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita gives besides the above interpretation of the Sûtra
from Haradatta's Gautamîyâ Mitâksharâ, another one, according to which
it means, 'Let him not forsake his own family and enter another one (by
adoption and so forth).' A third <span id="page_60">p. 60</span>
explanation is given by Nârâya*n*a on Sâṅkhâyana G*ri*hya-sûtra IV, 12,
II, who takes it to mean, 'Let him not go from one house to the other.'

<span id="fn_342"></span>[60:9](sbe1415.htm#fr_342) Gautama IX, 52;
Vish*n*u LXIII, 42.

<span id="fn_361"></span>[62:40](sbe1415.htm#fr_361) I read
sabhâsamavâyâ*msk*âva*g*ayeta. The corrupt readings of Bh. samavâyâ*sk*a
*g*avîyan and of F. samavâyâ*msk*a vakshîyanna point to this version,
the sense of which agrees with the parallel passages of other Sm*ri*tis,
see e.g. Âpastamba I, 11, 32, 19.

According to K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita the time intended is midday.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[63:44](sbe1415.htm#fr_365) Vish*n*u LXIII, 47.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[63:45](sbe1415.htm#fr_366) Vish*n*u LXIII, 46.
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita omits this Sûtra which is found in the majority of
the MSS.

<span id="fn_367"></span>[63:46](sbe1415.htm#fr_367) Âpastamba I, II,
32, 15; Vish*n*u XXX, 27.

<span id="fn_368"></span>[63:47](sbe1415.htm#fr_368) Manu IV, 92;
Vish*n*u LX, i. The Muhûrta sacred to Pra*g*âpati is the same as the
Brâhma-muhûrta, and falls in the last watch of the night.
