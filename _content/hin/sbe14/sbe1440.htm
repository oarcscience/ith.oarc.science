<p>3. Let him hold it in his right hand when he voids urine and excrements, in the left when he sips water. That is (a) settled (rule) for all good men.</p>  
<p>4. For as the sacrificial cusp (<I>k</I>amasa) is declared to be pure on account of its contact with the Soma-juice, even so the water-vessel is constantly pure through its contact with water.</p>  
<p>5. Therefore let him avoid (to use) it for the worship of the manes, the gods, and the fire.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_824"></A><A HREF="#fn_824"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. Therefore let him not go on a journey without a waterpot, nor to the boundary of the village, nor from one house to the other.</p>  
<p>7. Some (declare that he must not go without it) a step further than the length of an arrow.</p>  
<p>8. Baudh&acirc;yana (says that he shall not go without it) if he wishes to fulfil his duties constantly.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_822"></A><A HREF="sbe1440.htm#fr_822">163:1</A> <b>7</b>. The division of this chapter into two sections occurs in the M. manuscript only. The Dekhan MSS., which give the division into Ka<I>n</I><I>d</I>ik&acirc;s, do not note it, and have at the end of the Pra<I>s</I>na the figure 20, while M. has 21 and in words ekavi<I>m</I><I>s</I>ati<I>h</I> after the enumeration of the Prat&icirc;kas.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_823"></A><A HREF="sbe1440.htm#fr_823">163:2</A> 'A wise man must not corrupt his mind,' i.e. must not doubt or adopt erroneous views regarding the teaching of the <I>S</I>&acirc;stras with respect to the waterpot. It seems to me that this passage indicates the existence of an opposition to the constant carrying of the waterpot in Baudh&acirc;yana's times. This is so much more probable, as the custom is now obsolete, and is mentioned in some Pur&acirc;<I>n</I>as and versified Sm<I>ri</I>tis as one of the practices forbidden in the Kali age; see e<I>g</I>. the general note appended to Sir W. Jones' translation of Manu.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_824"></A><A HREF="sbe1440.htm#fr_824">164:5</A> According to Govinda the word 'therefore' refers back to S&ucirc;tra I, 4, 6, 14.</P>

The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is indicated by (the word) v&acirc;k, ("the goddess of) speech." The meaning is, "The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a says that there is also a <I>Ri</I>k-verse to this effect. That is as follows, tasyaish&acirc; bhavati yat te <I>s</I>ilpam ity&acirc;di' (Taittir&icirc;ya-&Acirc;ra<I>n</I>yaka I, 7, a).--Govinda.</P>
