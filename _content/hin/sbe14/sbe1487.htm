<p>1. Now, therefore, I will proclaim by what rites, connected with the S&acirc;man, Rik, Ya<I>g</I>us, and Atharva-vedas,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1433"></A><A HREF="#fn_1433"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p><A NAME="page_323"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 323</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> (man) quickly attains the wishes of his heart.</p>  
<p>2. Having purified his body by muttered prayers, burnt oblations, Ish<I>t</I>is, restraints, and the like, he will accomplish all his objects. He will not attain success in any other way.</p>  
<p>3. A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, who is going to mutter prayers, to offer burnt oblations or Ish<I>t</I>is, or to practise restraints, shall, first, during the bright half of the month, on a lucky day and under a lucky constellation, cause his hair and beard to be cut.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1434"></A><A HREF="#fn_1434"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. Let him bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening; let him beware of anger and untruth; let him not address women and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras; let him be continent, and subsist solely on food fit for offerings.</p>  
<p>5. Avoiding to sleep in the day-time, let him worship cows, Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, manes, and gods. As long as he is engaged in muttering prayers, offering Homas and Ish<I>t</I>is, and practising restraints, let him stand during the day and sit during the night.</p>  
<p>6. The K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra (penance) revealed by Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati lasts twelve days, (which are divided into four separate) periods of three days; (during the first period of three days he eats) in the day-time (only, during the second) at night (only, during the third he subsists on) food given without asking, (and during the fourth) finally (he lives on) air.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1435"></A><A HREF="#fn_1435"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. (If one eats on) one (day in) the morning (only), and (on the following day) at night (only, on the next day food) given without asking, (and on the fourth day) subsists on air, and repeats this three times, that is called the K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra (penance) of children.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1436"></A><A HREF="#fn_1436"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. (If) one eats one mouthful only at each (meal), following, during (three) periods of three days, the rules given above, and subsists during another period of three days on air, that is called the Atik<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1437"></A><A HREF="#fn_1437"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. (If) during those (first) three periods of three days one partakes of water only, and subsists afterwards (during three days) on air, that third (variety) must be known to be the most efficacious K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>r&acirc;tik<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1438"></A><A HREF="#fn_1438"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. If one drinks hot milk, (hot) clarified butter, (and a hot) decoction of Ku<I>s</I>a grass, each during three days, and fasts during another three days, that is called the Taptak<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1439"></A><A HREF="#fn_1439"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>11. (If one lives during one day) on cow's urine, (during one day) on cowdung, (during one day) on milk, (during one day) on sour milk, (during one day) on clarified butter, (during one day) on a decoction of Ku<I>s</I>a grass, and during one (day and) night on air, that is called the S&acirc;<I>m</I>t&acirc;pana K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1440"></A><A HREF="#fn_1440"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. Let him take the cow's urine, reciting the G&acirc;yatr&icirc;; the cowdung, (reciting the text), 'Gandhadv&acirc;r&acirc;m;'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1441"></A><A HREF="#fn_1441"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>

<p>the milk, (reciting the verse), '&Acirc;py&acirc;yasva;' the sour milk, reciting (the verse), 'Dadhikr&acirc;v<I>n</I>&acirc;;' the clarified butter, (saying), '<I>S</I>ukram asi;' the decoction of Ku<I>s</I>a grass (with the text), 'Devasya tv&acirc;;'</p>  
<p>13. (And mix together) one part of cow's urine, half as much .cowdung, three parts of milk, two of sour milk, one part of clarified butter, and one part of water boiled with Ku<I>s</I>a grass;' a S&acirc;<I>m</I>t&acirc;pana K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra (performed) in this manner will purify even a <I>S</I>vap&acirc;ka.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1442"></A><A HREF="#fn_1442"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>14. He who subsists during five (days and) nights on cow's urine, cowdung, milk, sour milk, and clarified butter will be purified by (that) Pa<I>&ntilde;</I><I>k</I>agavya (the five products of the cow).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1443"></A><A HREF="#fn_1443"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. If, self-restrained and attentive, he fasts during twelve days, that is called a Par&acirc;ka K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra, which destroys all sin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1444"></A><A HREF="#fn_1444"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. If he subsists on cow's urine and the other (substances named above), one day on each, and continues (this mode of life) during thrice seven days, the theologians call that a Mah&acirc;s&acirc;<I>m</I>t&acirc;pana K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1445"></A><A HREF="#fn_1445"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. If he daily adds to his food one mouthful during the bright (half of the month) and diminishes it daily by one mouthful during the dark (half of the month), and keeps two fasts in the two halves of the month, that is called a <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1446"></A><A HREF="#fn_1446"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>18. If, with concentrated mind, a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a eats four mouthfuls in the morning and four mouthfuls when the sun has set, he will perform the <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a of children.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1447"></A><A HREF="#fn_1447"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A></p>  
<p>19. If, self-restrained, he daily eats, during a month, at midday eight mouthfuls of food, fit for a sacrifice, he will perform the <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a of ascetics.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1448"></A><A HREF="#fn_1448"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. But a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who eats anyhow, during a month, thrice eighty mouthfuls of food, fit for a sacrifice, goes to the world of the moon.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1449"></A><A HREF="#fn_1449"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. As the rising moon frees the world from the fear of darkness, even so a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a who performs a <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a removes the fear of sin.</p>  
<p>22. He who lives one day on (rice)-grains, three days on oil-cakes, 'five days on buttermilk mixed with water, seven days on water, and (one day) on air, (performs) the guilt-destroying Tul&acirc;purusha.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1450"></A><A HREF="#fn_1450"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A></p>  
<p>23. Living on barley-gruel (y&acirc;vaka) removes the guilt of corporeal beings after seven days, and so does a fast of seven days; that has been recognised by wise men.</p>  
<p>24. By dressing in wet clothes, by living in the open air, and by exposing himself to the sun during the light halves of the months Pausha (December-January), Bh&acirc;drapada (August-September), and Gyesh<I>th</I>a (May-June), a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is freed from (all) sin excepting crimes causing loss of caste (patan&icirc;ya).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1451"></A><A HREF="#fn_1451"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>25. (If one swallows) cows' urine, cowdung, milk,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1452"></A><A HREF="#fn_1452"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>

<p>sour milk, clarified butter, and a decoction of Ku<I>s</I>a grass, mixed with barley gruel, that is the most sanctifying Brahmak&ucirc;r<I>k</I>a.</p>  
<p>26. He who fasts on the new moon day and eats sesamum grains on the full moon day, will be freed in the course of a year from the sins which he committed in the bright and the dark halves of the month.</p>  
<p>27. He who lives on alms obtained from Agnihotrins is purified in one month; (he who obtains his food) from a Y&acirc;y&acirc;vara. in ten days; he who receives it from a hermit in the forest, in five days;</p>  
<p>28. (He who lives) on food given by a person who has a store sufficient for one day only, will be purified in one day; he who drinks water given by a person subsisting by the Kapota-v<I>ri</I>tti (pigeon-life), is purified in three (days).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1453"></A><A HREF="#fn_1453"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>29. If one recites the whole <I>Ri</I>g-veda, Ya<I>g</I>ur-veda, and S&acirc;ma-veda, or thrice reads one of these Vedas and fasts, (that is) a most efficient means of purification.</p>  
<p>30. Now if one is in haste to finish, one may live on air during a day, and pass the night standing in water, that is equal (in efficacy) to a Pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya (K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1454"></A><A HREF="#fn_1454"><FONT SIZE="1">30</FONT></A></p>  
<p>31. He who at sunrise mutters the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; one thousand and eight times, is free from all sin, provided he has not slain a learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_328"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 328</FONT></A></p>  
<p>32. He who distributes food, speaks the truth, and has compassion on all living beings, is more (holy) than all those who have been purified by the restraints mentioned above.</p>
