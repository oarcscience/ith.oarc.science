<span id="fn_989"></span>[199:1](sbe1451.htm#fr_989) **18**. Vasish*th*a
I, 42-44. Learned Brâhma*n*as do not pay taxes, but the king obtains a
sixth part of the spiritual merit which they acquire. Hence Baudhâyana
uses the general term, 'a sixth share.'

<span id="fn_990"></span>[199:2](sbe1451.htm#fr_990) Vasish*th*a II,
13-14.

<span id="fn_991"></span>[199:3](sbe1451.htm#fr_991) Vasish*th*a II,

<span id="fn_995"></span>[200:7](sbe1451.htm#fr_995) Vasish*th*a XIX,
3-6. Govinda explains sarvatodhuram, 'foremost in all,' by sarva*gñ*am,
'omniscient.'

<span id="fn_996"></span>[200:8](sbe1451.htm#fr_996) Vasish*th*a I,
40-41. The rule, of course, refers primarily to advice in spiritual
matters.

<span id="fn_998"></span>[200:10](sbe1451.htm#fr_998) Manu VII, 90.

<span id="fn_999"></span>[200:11](sbe1451.htm#fr_999) Gautama X, 18. The

<span id="fn_1000"></span>[200:12](sbe1451.htm#fr_1000)-13. Vasish*th*a
III, 18.

<span id="fn_1001"></span>[200:14](sbe1451.htm#fr_1001) I take this to
mean that the king may take one article which particularly pleases him
out of each consignment, and impose on the rest an ad valorem duty of
ten per cent. Regarding the tribute in kind to be paid to Indian kings
by foreign merchants, see Periplus maris Erythraei, par. 49.

201</span> oppressing the traders,' by 'without deducting
(anuddh*ri*tya) a choice article.'

<span id="fn_1003"></span>[201:16](sbe1451.htm#fr_1003) Vasish*th*a XVI,
19-20. As stated above, I, 5, II, 15, the king must not take the
property of a Brâhma*n*a.

<span id="fn_1004"></span>[201:17](sbe1451.htm#fr_1004) Vish*n*u V, 2.
