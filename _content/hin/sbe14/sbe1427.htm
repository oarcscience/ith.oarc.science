<p>asking, and to fast during the last three days. That is an Atik<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra.</p>  
<p>3. A K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance (during the performance of which one) subsists on water (only is called) a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>r&acirc;tik<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p>5. 'Having cut his nails, (the performer) shall cause his beard and all his hair to be shaved off, excepting the eyebrows, the eyelashes, and the lock at the top of the head; (wear) one garment only; he shall eat blameless food; what one obtains by going to beg once (is called) blameless food; he shall bathe in the morning, at noon, and in the evening; he shall carry a stick (and) a waterpot; he shall avoid to speak to women and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras; carefully keeping himself in an upright or sitting posture, he shall stand during the day, and remain seated during the night.' Thus speaks the divine Vasish<I>th</I>a.</p>  
<p>6. Let him not instruct in these Institutes of the sacred law anybody but his son or a pupil who stays (in his house at least) for a year.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. The fee (for teaching it) is one thousand (pa<I>n</I>as), (or) ten cows and a bull, or the worship of the teacher.</p>
