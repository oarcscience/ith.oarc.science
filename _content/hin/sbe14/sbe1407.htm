<p>1. The four castes are distinguished by their origin and by particular sacraments.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_164"></A><A HREF="#fn_164"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>2. There is also the following passage of the Veda, 'The Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a was his mouth, the Kshatriya formed his arms, the Vai<I>s</I>ya his thighs; the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra was born from his feet.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_165"></A><A HREF="#fn_165"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. It has been declared in (the following passage</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of) the Veda that (a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra) shall not receive the sacraments, 'He created the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a with the G&acirc;yatr&icirc; (metre), the Kshatriya with the Trish<I>t</I>ubh, the Vai<I>s</I>ya with the <I>G</I>agat&icirc;, the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra without any metre.'</p>  
<p>4. Truthfulness, suppression of anger, liberality, abstention from injuring living beings, and the procreation of offspring (are duties common to) all (castes).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_166"></A><A HREF="#fn_166"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. The M&acirc;nava (S&ucirc;tra states), 'Only when he worships the manes and the gods, or honours guests, he may certainly do injury to animals.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. 'On offering a Madhuparka (to a guest), at a sacrifice, and at the rites in honour of the manes, but on these occasions only may an animal be slain; that (rule) Manu proclaimed.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A></p>  
<p>7. 'Meat can never be obtained without injuring living beings, and to injure living beings does not procure heavenly bliss; therefore the (sages declare) the slaughter (of beasts) at a sacrifice not to be slaughter (in the ordinary sense of the word).'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>8. 'Now he may also cook a full-grown ox or a full-grown he-goat for a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a or Kshatriya guest; in this manner they offer hospitality to such (a man).'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>9. Libations of water (must be poured out) for all (deceased relatives) who completed the second year and (their death causes) impurity.</p>  
<p>10. Some declare that (this rule applies also to children) that died after teething.</p>  
<p>11. After having burnt the body (of the deceased, the relatives) enter the water without looking at (the place of cremation),&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. Facing the south, they shall pour out water with both hands on (those days of the period of impurity) which are marked by odd numbers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_172"></A><A HREF="#fn_172"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>

</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_28"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. The south, forsooth, is the region sacred to the manes.</p>  
<p>14. After they have gone home, they shall sit during three days on mats, fasting.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_173"></A><A HREF="#fn_173"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. If they are unable (to fast so long), they shall subsist on food bought in the market or given unasked.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_174"></A><A HREF="#fn_174"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>  
<p>16. It is ordered that impurity caused by a death shall last ten days in the case of Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a relations.</p>  
<p>17. It has been declared in the Veda that Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>a relationship extends to the seventh person (in the ascending or descending line).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_175"></A><A HREF="#fn_175"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>  
<p>18. It has been declared in the Veda that for married females it extends to the third person (in the ascending or descending line).</p>  
<p>19. Others (than the blood-relations) shall perform (the obsequies) of married females,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_176"></A><A HREF="#fn_176"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A></p>  
<p>20. (The rule regarding impurity) should be exactly the same on the birth of a child for those men who desire complete purity,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_177"></A><A HREF="#fn_177"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. Or for the mother and the father (of the child alone); some (declare that it applies) to the&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_178"></A><A HREF="#fn_178"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>

<p>mother (only), because she is the immediate cause of that (event).</p>  
<p>22. Now they quote also (the following verse): On the birth (of a child) the male does not become impure if he does not touch (the female); on that (occasion) the menstrual excretion must be known to be impure, and that is not found in males.'</p>  
<p>23. If during (a period of impurity) another (death or birth) happens, (the relatives) shall be pure after (the expiration of) the remainder of that (first period);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_179"></A><A HREF="#fn_179"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>  
<p>24. (But) if one night (and day only of the first period of impurity) remain, (they shall be pure) after two (days and nights);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_180"></A><A HREF="#fn_180"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>25. (If the second death or birth happens) on the morning (of the day on which the first period of impurity expires, they shall be purified) after three (days and nights).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_181"></A><A HREF="#fn_181"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>26. A Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a is freed from impurity (caused by a death or a birth) after ten days,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_182"></A><A HREF="#fn_182"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>27. A Kshatriya after fifteen days,</p>  
<p>28. A Vai<I>s</I>ya after twenty days,</p>  
<p>29. A <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra after a month.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_183"></A><A HREF="#fn_183"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A></p>  
<p>30. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'But (a twice-born man) who has eaten (the food) of a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra during impurity caused by a death or a</p>

<p>birth, will suffer dreadful (punishment in) hell and be born again in the womb of an animal.'</p>  
<p>31. 'A twice-born man who eats by appointment in the house of a stranger whose ten days of impurity, caused by a death, have not expired, after death will become a worm and feed on the ordure of that (man who fed him).'</p>  
<p>32. It has been declared in the Veda, '(Such a sinner) becomes pure by reciting the Sa<I>m</I>hit&acirc; of the Veda for twelve months or for twelve half-months while fasting.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_184"></A><A HREF="#fn_184"><FONT SIZE="1">32</FONT></A></p>  
<p>33. On the death of a child of less than two years or on a miscarriage, the impurity of the Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as lasts three (days and) nights.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A></p>  
<p>34. Gautama (declares that on the former occasion they become) pure at once.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">34</FONT></A></p>  
<p>35. If (a person) dies in a foreign country and (his Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as) hear (of his death) after ten days (or a longer period), the impurity lasts for one (day and) night.</p>  
<p>36. Gautama (declares that) if a person who has kindled the sacred fire dies on a journey, (his Sapi<I>n</I><I>d</I>as shall) again celebrate his obsequies, (burning a dummy made of leaves or straw), and remain impure (during ten days) as if (they had actually buried) his corpse.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">36</FONT></A></p>  
<p>37. When he has touched a sacrificial post, a pyre, a burial-ground, a menstruating or a lately confined woman, impure men or (<I>K</I>&acirc;<I>n</I><I>d</I>&acirc;las and so forth), he shall bathe, submerging both his body and his head.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_188"></A><A HREF="#fn_188"><FONT SIZE="1">37</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_167"></A><A HREF="sbe1407.htm#fr_167">26:5</A> M&acirc;navam, 'the M&acirc;nava (S&ucirc;tra),' means literally 'a work proclaimed by Manu' (manun&acirc; proktam). It is probable that the work referred to by Vasish<I>th</I>a is the lost Dharma-s&ucirc;tra of the M&acirc;nava <I>S</I>&acirc;kh&acirc;, which is a subdivision of the Maitr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>&icirc;yas, and on which the famous metrical M&acirc;nava Dharma<I>s</I>&acirc;stra is based. The words of the S&ucirc;tra may either be a direct quotation or a summary of the opinion given in the M&acirc;nava-s&ucirc;tra. I think the former supposition the more probable one, and believe that not only S&ucirc;tra 5, but also S&ucirc;tras 6-8 have been taken bodily from the ancient Dharma-s&ucirc;tra. For S&ucirc;tra 6 agrees literally with a verse of the metrical Manusm<I>ri</I>ti, and at the end of S&ucirc;tra 8 several MSS. have the word iti, the characteristic mark that a quotation is finished, while the language of S&ucirc;tra 8 is more antiquated than Vasish<I>th</I>a's usual style. If my view is correct, it follows that the lost M&acirc;nava Dharma-s&ucirc;tra consisted, like nearly all the known works of this class, partly of prose and partly of verse.</P>

The reading is, however, wrong, because the parallel passages of most Sm<I>ri</I>tis enjoin that a man who has touched a sacrificial post shall bathe. The cause of the mistake is probably a mere clerical error. The MSS. repeat the last word of this chapter, apa ityapa<I>h</I>. The reason is not, as K<I>ri</I>sh<I>n</I>apa<I>n</I><I>d</I>ita imagines, that the author wishes to indicate the necessity of bathing when one touches a person who has touched some impure thing or person. It is the universal practice of the ancient authors to repeat the last word of a chapter in order to mark its end, see e<I>g</I>. Gautama note on I, 61. If it is neglected in the earlier chapters of the V&acirc;sish<I>th</I>a Dharma-s&ucirc;tra, the badness of the MSS. is the cause.</P>
