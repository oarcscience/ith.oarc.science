<p>2. If (the father) gives (his daughter) to a student (who has not broken his vow of chastity and) who asks for her, after fully enquiring into his learning and character, that (is) the rite .of Brahman (br&acirc;hma).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1023"></A><A HREF="#fn_1023"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. If (the father gives his daughter away) after clothing her and decking her with ornaments, (saying) 'That (is thy wife), fulfil the law (with her),' that (is) the rite of Pra<I>g</I>&acirc;pati (pr&acirc;<I>g</I>&acirc;patya).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1024"></A><A HREF="#fn_1024"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. If (the bridegroom) after offering the first burnt oblation of parched grain (receives the maiden) for a bull and a cow, that is the rite of the <I>Ri</I>shis (&acirc;rsha).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1025"></A><A HREF="#fn_1025"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. If (a maiden is given) to an officiating priest within the sacrificial enclosure, while the presents are being taken away, that (is) the rite of the gods (daiva).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1026"></A><A HREF="#fn_1026"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>6. The union of a lover with a loving damsel (is called) the rite of the Gandharvas (g&acirc;ndharva).</p>  
<p>7. (If the bridegroom receives the maiden) after gladdening (the parents) by money, (that is) the rite of the Asuras (&acirc;sura).</p>  
<p>8. (If the maiden is wedded) after being forcibly abducted, (that is) the rite of the R&acirc;kshasas (r&acirc;kshasa).</p>  
<p>9. If one has intercourse with (a maiden) who is sleeping, intoxicated, or out of her senses (with fear or passion and weds her afterwards, that is) the rite of the Pi<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>as (pai<I>s</I>&acirc;<I>k</I>a).</p>  
<p>10. Among these (eight rites) the four first (named) are (lawful) for a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a. Among these also each earlier named is preferable.</p>  
<p>11. Among the (four) later (named rites) each succeeding one is more sinful (than the preceding ones).</p>  
<p>12. Among these the sixth and the seventh agree with the law of the Kshatriyas. For power is their attribute.</p>

<p>12. Vish<I>n</I>u XXIV, 28; Vasish<I>th</I>a I, 29, 34. The meaning of the last clause is that as, according to I, 10, 18, 3, Brahman placed power in the Kshatriyas, they may adopt marriage rites by which a disregard of conventionalities or strength is displayed.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. The fifth and the eighth (are lawful) for Vai<I>s</I>yas and <I>S</I>&ucirc;dras.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1027"></A><A HREF="#fn_1027"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>

<p>16. Some recommend the G&acirc;ndharva rite for all (castes), because it is based on (mutual) affection.</p>
