<p>1.

He shall cause the head of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&icirc; to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a black donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad.

<p>2. If a Vai<I>s</I>ya approaches a female of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste, (the king) shall cause the Vai<I>s</I>ya to be tied up in Lohita grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&icirc; to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a yellowish donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).</p>  
<p>3. If a Kshatriya approaches a female of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste, (the king) shall cause the Kshatriya to be tied up in leaves of Sara grass and shall throw him into a fire. He shall cause the head of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>&icirc; to be shaved, and her body to be anointed with butter; placing her naked on a white donkey, he shall cause her to be conducted along the highroad. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).</p>  
<p>4. A Vai<I>s</I>ya who offends) with a female of the Kshatriya class (shall be treated) in the same manner,</p>  
<p>5. And a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra (who offends) with females of the Kshatriya or Vai<I>s</I>ya castes.</p>  
<p>6. If (a wife) has been mentally unfaithful to her husband, she shall live on barley or rice boiled in milk during three days, and sleep on the bare ground. After the three days (have expired), the (husband) shall offer eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; (and the Mantra called) <I>S</I>iras, while she is immersed in water.

<p>7. If (a wife) has held an (improper) conversation (with another man), she must perform the same penance during a month. After (the expiration of) the month, (the husband) shall offer four times eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; (and the Mantra called) <I>S</I>iras, while she is immersed in water. It is declared in the Veda that she becomes pure (thereby).</p>  
<p>8. But if (a wife) has actually committed adultery, she shall wear during a year a garment smeared with clarified butter, and sleep on a mat of Ku<I>s</I>a grass, or in a pit filled with cowdung. After (the expiration of) the year, (the husband) shall offer eight hundred burnt-oblations, (reciting) the S&acirc;vitr&icirc; (and the Mantra called) <I>S</I>iras, while she is immersed in water.

<p>the life of her lord, or who commits adultery with a man of a degraded caste.</p>  
<p>11. That woman of the Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a caste who drinks spirituous liquor, the gods will not admit (after death) to the same abode with her husband; losing all spiritual merit she wanders about in this world and is born again as a leech or a pearl-oyster.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A></p>  
<p>12. The wives of Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>as, Kshatriyas, and Vai<I>s</I>yas who commit adultery with a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra may be purified by a penance in case no child is born (from their adulterous intercourse), not otherwise.</p>  
<p>13. (Those who have committed adultery) with a man of lower caste shall perform a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance, succeeded by one, two, or three <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>14. Faithful wives who are constantly pure and truthful (reside after death) in the same abodes with their husbands; those who are unfaithful are born as jackals.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>

<p>drinks spirituous liquor. No purification is prescribed for the half which has fallen.</p>  
<p>16. If a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a unintentionally commits adultery with the wife of a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, (he shall perform) a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance in case (the husband) fulfils the religious duties (of his caste), and an Atik<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance in case (the husband) does not fulfil his religious duties.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_623"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A></p>  
<p>17. The same (penances are prescribed) for Kshatriyas and Vai<I>s</I>yas (for adultery with women of their respective castes).</p>  
<p>18. If he kills a cow, let him perform, during six months, a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra or a Taptak<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra, dressed in the raw hide of that (cow).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_624"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A></p>  
<p>19. The rule for these two (penances is as follows):</p>  
<p>20. 'During three days he eats in the day-time (only), and during the (next) three days at night (only), he subsists during (another) period of three days on food offered without asking, and (finally) he fasts during three days.' That is a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_625"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>21. 'Let him drink hot water during three days; let him drink hot milk during the (next) three days; after drinking during (another) period of three days hot clarified butter, he shall subsist on air during the (last) three days.' That is a Taptak<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>  
<p>22. And he shall give (to a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a) a bull and a cow.</p>  
<p>23. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'Through killing a spotted deer, a he-goat, and&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A></p>

<p>a bird three maladies (befal men), viz. jealousy, hunger, and old age; (therefore) let him (who is guilty of such an offence) perform (a penance) during ninety-eight (days).'</p>  
<p>24. Having slain a dog, a cat, an ichneumon, a snake, a frog, or a rat, let him perform a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance of twelve days' duration, and give something (to a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A></p>  
<p>25. But having slain a quantity of boneless animals, equal to the weight of a cow, let him perform a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance of twelve days' duration, and give something (to a Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A></p>  
<p>26. But (the same penance must be performed) for each single (slain animal) that possesses bones.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_630"></A><A HREF="#fn_630"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A></p>  
<p>27. He who extinguishes the (sacred) fires shall perform a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance of twelve days, and cause them to be kindled again (by priests engaged for the occasion).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_631"></A><A HREF="#fn_631"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A></p>  
<p>28. He who falsely accuses a Guru shall bathe, dressed in his clothes, and ask his Guru's pardon. It is declared in the Veda that he becomes pure by the Guru's forgiving him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_632"></A><A HREF="#fn_632"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A></p>  
<p>29. An atheist shall perform a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance of twelve days' duration, and give up his infidelity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_633"></A><A HREF="#fn_633"><FONT SIZE="1">29</FONT></A></p>

<p>30. But he who receives subsistence from infidels (shall perform) an Atik<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance (and not repeat his offence).</p>  
<p>31. (The rule applicable to) a seller of Soma has been explained hereby.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_634"></A><A HREF="#fn_634"><FONT SIZE="1">31</FONT></A></p>  
<p>32. A hermit, on violating the rules of his order, shall perform a K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra penance of twelve days' duration, and continue (the observances obligatory on him) in a great forest.</p>  
<p>33. Ascetics, (offending in the same manner) as hermits, shall perform for a protracted period (the vow of regulating the quantity of their food according to) the growth of the moon, and shall again be initiated, in accordance with (the rules of) the Institutes applicable to them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_635"></A><A HREF="#fn_635"><FONT SIZE="1">33</FONT></A></p>

Thus a Brahma<I>n</I>&icirc; must perform one K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra and one <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>a for adultery with a Kshatriya, one K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra and two <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>as for adultery with a Vai<I>s</I>ya, and one K<I>ri</I><I>k</I><I>kh</I>ra and three <I>K</I>&acirc;ndr&acirc;ya<I>n</I>as for adultery with a <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra. His view that the rule refers to wives who commit the sin without intent or against their will, is open to doubt.
