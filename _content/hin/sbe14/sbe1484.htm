<p>1. We will separately explain the various penances for the several offences, both heavier and lighter ones.</p>  
<p>2. Let him prescribe whatever may be befitting for each (case),--heavier penances for great (crimes), and lighter ones for trivial (faults).</p>  
<p>3. Let him perform the penances according to the rule given in the Institutes of the Sacred Law.</p>  
<p>4. He who is about to accept gifts, or he who has accepted gifts, must repeatedly recite the four <I>Ri</I>k-verses (called) Taratsamand&icirc;s.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1415"></A><A HREF="#fn_1415"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. But in case one has eaten any kind of forbidden food; or that given by a person whose food must not be eaten, the means of removing the guilt is to sprinkle water (over one's head) while one recites the Taratsamand&icirc; <I>Ri</I><I>k</I>as.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1416"></A><A HREF="#fn_1416"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>  
<p>6. But we will, hereafter, declare another rule for (the expiation of) the murder of a learned Br&acirc;hma<I>n</I>a, whereby (men) are freed also from mortal sins of all (kinds).</p>  
<p>7. Let him (perform), during twelve nights, suppressions</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_318"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 318</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of the breath (and) mutter purificatory texts, the Vy&acirc;h<I>ri</I>tis, the syllable Om, (and) the Aghamarsha<I>n</I>a hymn, (living) on milk;</p>  
<p>8. Or (he becomes) pure if he bathes, and during three (days and) nights subsists on air and (remains dressed) in wet clothes.</p>  
<p>9. But if he has repeatedly committed forbidden acts of all kinds, and has (afterwards) worshipped reciting the V&acirc;ru<I>n</I>&icirc; (texts), he is freed from all sin.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1417"></A><A HREF="#fn_1417"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>10. Now a student who has broken his vow (avak&icirc;r<I>n</I>in) shall heap fuel on the fire on the night of the new moon, perform the preparatory ceremonies required for a Darv&icirc;homa, and offer two oblations of clarified butter (reciting the following texts): 'O Lust, I have broken my vow, my vow I have broken, O Lust, to. Lust Sv&acirc;h&acirc;;' 'O Lust, I have done evil, I have done evil, O Lust, to Lust Sv&acirc;h&acirc;.'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1418"></A><A HREF="#fn_1418"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A></p>  
<p>11. After he has made the offering, he shall address the fire, closely joining his hands and turning sideways, (with the following texts): 'May the Maruts grant me, may Indra, may B<I>ri</I>haspati,, may this fire grant me long life and strength, make me long-lived.' The Maruts, forsooth, give back to him the vital airs, Indra gives back to him strength, B<I>ri</I>haspati the lustre of Brahman, Fire all the remainder. (Thus) his body is made whole, and he attains the full length of life. Let him next address (the gods) with three (repetitions of the texts).</p>

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> For the gods are trebly true. (All that) has been declared in the Veda.</p>  
<p>12. He who considers himself defiled by minor offences (upap&acirc;taka), will be freed from all guilt if he offers burnt oblations according to this same rule;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1419"></A><A HREF="#fn_1419"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>13. Or if he has partaken of food unfit to be eaten or to be drunk or of forbidden food, and if he has committed sinful acts or performed sinful rites either unintentionally or intentionally, and if he has had connexion with a female of the <I>S</I>&ucirc;dra caste or committed an unnatural crime, he becomes pure by bathing (and reciting) the Abli&#7749;ga (verses) and (those called) V&acirc;ru<I>n</I>&icirc;s.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1420"></A><A HREF="#fn_1420"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>14. Now they quote also (the following verse): If he has partaken of food unfit to be eaten or to be drunk, or of forbidden food, and if he has committed forbidden acts or performed forbidden rites, he will, nevertheless, be freed from (crimes) committed intentionally which are similar to mortal sins, nay, even from mortal sins (p&acirc;taka).'&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1421"></A><A HREF="#fn_1421"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A></p>  
<p>15. Or let him fast during three (days and) nights, bathe thrice a day, and, suppressing his breath, thrice recite the Aghamarsha<I>n</I>a. Manu has declared that that is equal (in efficacy) to the final bath at a horse-sacrifice.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1422"></A><A HREF="#fn_1422"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A></p>

<p>16. And it is declared in the Veda, '(That is) the ancient purificatory rite, which is widely known (in the Institutes of the Sacred Law); purified thereby man conquers sin. May we, sanctified by this holy means of purification, conquer our enemy, sin.'</p>
