### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 10, KA*ND*IKÂ 18.

1\. Now the following vows are (to be kept by an ascetic):

2\. Abstention from injuring living beings, truthfulness, abstention
from appropriating the property of others, continence, (and)
liberality. <span id="fr_1314"></span>[2](#fn_1314)

3\. There are five minor vows, (viz.) abstention from anger, obedience
towards the Guru, avoidance of rashness, cleanliness and purity in
eating. <span id="fr_1315"></span>[3](#fn_1315)

4\. Now (follows the rule for) begging. Let him <span
id="fr_1316"></span>[4](#fn_1316)

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

ask Brâhma*n*as, both those who have houses (*s*âlîna) and those who
lead a wandering life (yâyâvara), for alms, when the Vai*s*vadeva
offering has been finished.

5\. Let him ask (for it), prefacing (his request with the word) Bhavat.

6\. Let him stand begging no longer than the time required for milking a
cow.

7\. When he returns from begging, he lays (the alms) down in a pure
place, washes his hands and feet, and announces (what he obtained) to
the sun, (reciting the text), 'Ud u tya*m* *k*itram,' &c. He (also)
announces it to Brahman (with the text), 'The first-born Brahman,'
&c. <span id="fr_1317"></span>[7](#fn_1317)

8\. It is declared in the Veda, 'After the Brahmâdhâna the sacrificer
himself (contains) the sacrificial fires. His respiration (prâ*n*a,
represents) the Gârhapatya fire, the air that goes downwards (apâna,
represents) the Anvâhâryapa*k*ana (or Dakshi*n*a) fire, the circulation
in the body (vyâna, represents) the Âhavanîya fire, the cerebral
circulation (udâna) and the abdominal circulation (samâna, represent)
the Sabhya and Âvasathya fires. These five fires are abiding in 'the
soul. He (therefore) offers (the oblations) in the soul alone.' <span
id="fr_1318"></span>[8](#fn_1318)

9\. 'This sacrifice, offered in the soul, which is located in and based
on the soul, leads the soul to happiness.'

10\. Giving, compassionately, portions (of his food) to the living
beings, and sprinkling the remainder

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

with water, he shall eat it as if it were a medicine.

11\. After he has eaten and sipped water, he mutters (the texts), 'Out
of darkness we,' &c., (and), My speech resides in the mouth,' &c., and
worships the sun with the (verse called) *G*yotishmatî. <span
id="fr_1319"></span>[11](#fn_1319)

12\. Let him eat food, given without asking, regarding which nothing has
been settled before-hand and which has reached him accidentally, so much
only as is sufficient to sustain life. <span
id="fr_1320"></span>[12](#fn_1320)

13\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Eight mouthfuls (make)
the meal of an ascetic, sixteen (that) of a hermit in the woods,
thirty-two (that) of a householder, an unlimited (quantity that) of a
student.' <span id="fr_1321"></span>[13](#fn_1321)

14\. 'Alms (may) either (be obtained) from (men

of) the three castes, or the food (given) by a single Brâhma*n*a (may be
eaten); or (he may obtain food) from (men of) all castes, and not (eat)
that given by a single Brâhma*n*a.'

15\. Now they quote (the following special rules) for the case that the
teachers explain (the doctrine) of the Upanishads: 'Diligently standing
(in the day-time), keeping silence, sitting (at night) with crossed
legs, bathing three times a day, and eating

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

at the fourth, sixth, or eighth (meal-time only), he shall subsist
entirely on (rice) grains, oil-cake, food prepared from barley, sour
milk, (and) milk.'

16\. It is declared in the Veda, On that (occasion) he shall rigidly
keep silence; pressing the teeth together he may converse, without
opening his mouth, as much as is necessary with teachers deeply versed
in the three Vedas (and) with ascetics possessing a great knowledge of
the scriptures, not with women, nor when he would break (his vow).'

17\. (Let him keep) only one of (the rules which enjoin) standing (in
the day-time), rigid silence, and sitting (at night) with crossed legs;
let him not keep all three together.

18\. It is declared in the Veda, And he who has gone there may eat, in
times of distress, a small quantity of the food prescribed by his vow
after (having partaken of other dishes), provided he does not break (his
vow).' <span id="fr_1322"></span>[18](#fn_1322)

19\. 'Eight (things) do not cause him who is intent on standing (in the
day-time), keeping rigid silence, sitting (at night) with crossed legs,
bathing three times a day, and (eating) at the fourth, sixth, or eighth
meal-time only, to break his vow, (viz.) water, roots, clarified butter,
milk, sacrificial food, the wish of a Brâhma*n*a, an order of his
teacher, and medicine.' <span id="fr_1323"></span>[19](#fn_1323)

20\. Let him mutter the (Mantras which must be

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

recited at the) Agnihotra, in the evening and in the morning,

21\. After performing his evening devotions by (reciting the verses
called) Vâru*n*îs, and his morning devotions by (reciting the verses
called) Maitrîs. <span id="fr_1324"></span>[21](#fn_1324)

22\. An ascetic shall keep no fire, have no house, no home, and no
protector. He may enter a village in order to collect alms, and emit
speech at the private recitation of the Veda.' <span
id="fr_1325"></span>[22](#fn_1325)

23\. It is declared in the Veda,' Limited in number are the
*Ri*k-verses, limited in number are the Sâmans, limited is the answer
(of the Adhvaryu priest): <span id="fr_1326"></span>[23](#fn_1326)

24\. 'Thus (an ascetic) shall not give up the Veda, (but live), until he
is liberated from the body, at the root of the tree.' <span
id="fr_1327"></span>[24](#fn_1327)

25\. 'The tree (is) the Veda; the syllable Om is its root; the syllable
Om is the essence of the Veda.'

26\. 'Meditating on the syllable Om, he becomes

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

fit (to be united with) Brahman.' Thus spake the lord of created beings.

27\. Let him cleanse the vessel of Brahman with the seven
Vyâh*ri*tis. <span id="fr_1328"></span>[27](#fn_1328)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1314"></span>[279:2](sbe1472.htm#fr_1314) **18**. The five
vows (vratas) named here are the principal ones. As to the vow of
'liberality' Govinda remarks that though the ascetic possesses no
'store' and no property in the ordinary sense of the word, still he can
have books and give those away.

<span id="fn_1315"></span>[279:3](sbe1472.htm#fr_1315) 'Avoidance of
rashness,' i.e. committing any act which might destroy life.

<span id="fn_1316"></span>[279:4](sbe1472.htm#fr_1316) 'When the
Vai*s*vadeva offering has been finished,' i.e. when people. have had
their dinner; see also Vasish*th*a X, 7.

<span id="fn_1317"></span>[280:7](sbe1472.htm#fr_1317) The second text
occurs repeatedly in the Taittirîya-veda, e*g*. Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X,
1, 10.

<span id="fn_1318"></span>[280:8](sbe1472.htm#fr_1318) Regarding the
Brahmâdhâna, see above, II, 10, 17, 19.

<span id="fn_1319"></span>[281:11](sbe1472.htm#fr_1319) The first text
occurs frequently in the Taittirîya-veda, e.g. Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ IV,
i, 7, 4; the second, Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 72. The Gyotishmatî is,
according to Govinda, the first of the two Mantras quoted.

<span id="fn_1320"></span>[281:12](sbe1472.htm#fr_1320) According to
Govinda this verse gives the opinion of 'some' teachers, not the
author's. Asa*m*k*li*ptam, 'regarding which nothing has been settled
beforehand,' indicates, according to Govinda, that the ascetic must not
even mentally determine what he is going to eat.

<span id="fn_1321"></span>[281:13](sbe1472.htm#fr_1321) See above, II,
7, 13, 7.

<span id="fn_1322"></span>[282:18](sbe1472.htm#fr_1322) 'The meaning is,
that in times of distress, having partaken at his pleasure (of other
food), he may afterwards eat of one (of the substances mentioned above,
viz.) rice-grains and the rest.'--Govinda.

<span id="fn_1323"></span>[282:19](sbe1472.htm#fr_1323) All the MSS.
except M. have snâna, 'bathing,' instead of sthâna, 'standing (in the
day-time),' though the reading is clearly wrong.

<span id="fn_1324"></span>[283:21](sbe1472.htm#fr_1324) The Maitrîs
occur Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ III, 4, 11, 5, and the Vâru*n*îs follow them
immediately.

<span id="fn_1325"></span>[283:22](sbe1472.htm#fr_1325) Âpastamba II, 9,
21, 10.

<span id="fn_1326"></span>[283:23](sbe1472.htm#fr_1326) This and the
next Sûtras are intended to teach that ascetics may limit their private
recitation to the repetition of the, pra*n*ava, the syllable Om:
According to Govinda the passage of the Veda quoted refers originally to
the *K*aturhotâra*h*, which the Taittirîya Brâhma*n*a II, 2, I, 4, and
III, 12, 5, I identifies with. the Brahman, and where the pratigara, the
answer of the Adhvaryu priest, is 'O*m* hota*h*' (Aitareya Brâhma*n*a V,
25).

<span id="fn_1327"></span>[283:24](sbe1472.htm#fr_1327) I have taken
v*ri*kshamûlikovedasa*m*nyâsî to stand for v*ri*kshamûliko
avedasa*m*nyasî. For the vedasa*m*nyâsa, 'giving up the Veda,' is not
permitted to an ascetic; see e.g. Vasish*th*a X, 4. But even without the
negative particle vedasa*m*nyâsî may convey a sense not opposed to the
general teaching of the Sm*ri*tis. For it may be taken to mean
'abandoning (the recitation of other portions of) the Veda.'

<span id="fn_1328"></span>[284:27](sbe1472.htm#fr_1328) Govinda is
uncertain if the term brahmabhâ*g*ana, 'the vessel of Brahman,' refers
to the alms-bowl or to the body of the ascetic. Probably both are meant,
and the Sûtra is intended to prescribe the frequent recitation of the
Vyâh*ri*tis in addition to the syllable Om.
