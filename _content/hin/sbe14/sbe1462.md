### PRA*S*NA II, ADHYÂYA 5, KA*ND*IKÂ 8.

1\. Now, after washing his hands, he shall take his waterpot and a clod
of earth, go to a (sacred) bathing-place and thrice clean his feet (with
earth and water) and thrice his body. <span
id="fr_1226"></span>[1](#fn_1226)

2\. Now some say, 'One must not enter a burial-ground, water, a temple,
a cowpen, nor a place where Brâhma*n*as (sit) without having cleaned
one's feet.'

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

3\. Then he enters the water, (reciting the following verse): 'I take
refuge with gold-horned Varu*n*a, give me at my request (O Varu*n*a) a
purifying bathing-place. May Indra, Varu*n*a, B*ri*haspati, and
Savit*ri* again and again cleanse me from all sin which I have committed
by eating the food of unholy men, by receiving gifts from the wicked,
and from all evil which I have done by thoughts, speeches, or
deeds.' <span id="fr_1227"></span>[3](#fn_1227)

4\. Then he takes up water in his joined hands, (saying), 'May the
waters and the herbs be propitious to us.' <span
id="fr_1228"></span>[4](#fn_1228)

5\. (Next) he pours (the water) out in that direction in which an enemy
of his dwells, (saying), 'May they work woe to him who hates us and whom
we hate.' <span id="fr_1229"></span>[5](#fn_1229)

6\. Then he sips water, and thrice makes the water eddy around himself
turning from the left to the right (and saying), 'May that which is
hurtful, which is impure, and which is inauspicious in the water be
removed.' <span id="fr_1230"></span>[6](#fn_1230)

7\. After having submerged himself and having emerged from the
water, <span id="fr_1231"></span>[7](#fn_1231)

8\. (Acts of) personal purification, washing the clothes by beating them
on a stone and sipping <span id="fr_1232"></span>[8](#fn_1232)

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

water are not (permitted to the worshipper) as long as he is in the
water.

9\. If (the water used for bathing) has been (taken from a) confined
(place, such as a well), he worships it with the following (Mantra):
'Adoration to Agni, the lord of the waters; adoration to Indra;
adoration to Varu*n*a; adoration to Vâru*n*î; adoration to the
waters.' <span id="fr_1233"></span>[9](#fn_1233)

10\. After having ascended the bank and having sipped water, let him
again sip water, though he has done so before, (and recite the following
Mantras) 'May water purify the earth, may the purified earth purify me,
may Brahma*n*aspati (and) Brahman purify, may the purified (earth)
purify me. May water purify me, (taking away) all (the guilt which I
incurred by eating) remnants of food, and forbidden food, (by
committing) evil deeds, (by) receiving gifts from wicked men,
Svâhâ!' <span id="fr_1234"></span>[10](#fn_1234)

11\. Making two Pavitras he rubs (his body) with water. Having rubbed
himself, (reciting the) three (verses), 'Ye waters are,' &c., the four
(verses), 'The golden-coloured, pure, purifying,' &c., (and) the
Anuvâka, 'He who purifies,' &c., he performs, stepping back into the
water, three Prâ*n*âyâmas with the Aghamarsha*n*a (hymn); then he
ascends the bank, squeezes (the water) out of his dress, puts on
garments which have been washed and dried in the air and which are not
the worse for wear, sips water, <span id="fr_1235"></span>[11](#fn_1235)

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

sits down on Darbha grass, and, holding Darbha grass (in his hands),
recites, facing the east, the Gâyatrî one thousand times, (or) one
hundred times, or any number of times, or at least twelve times.

12\. Then he worships the sun (reciting the following Mantras): 'Out of
darkness we,' &c., 'Up that bright,' &c., That eye which is beneficial
to the gods,' &c., (and) 'He who rose,' &c. <span
id="fr_1236"></span>[12](#fn_1236)

13\. Now they quote also (the following maxim): 'The syllable Om,, the
Vyâh*ri*tis, and the Sâvitrî, these five Veda-offerings daily cleanse
the Brâhma*n*a from guilt.'

14\. Being purified by the five Veda-offerings, he next satiates the
gods (with water, saying), <span id="fr_1237"></span>[14](#fn_1237)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1226"></span>[249:1](sbe1462.htm#fr_1226) **8**. Vish*n*u
LXIV, 18. This Adhyâya contains the rules for bathing, and the subject
is introduced, as Govinda observes, because in the preceding chapter II,
4, 7, 2, it has been said that an impure person must bathe before he
performs the twilight devotions. Govinda also states that the word *k*a,
'and,' which stands after m*ri*tpi*nd*am, 'a clod,' indicates that
gomaya, 'cowdung,' must also be employed.

<span id="fn_1227"></span>[250:3](sbe1462.htm#fr_1227) The verse is
found Taittirîya Âra*n*yaka X, 1, 12,

<span id="fn_1228"></span>[250:4](sbe1462.htm#fr_1228) Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka X, 1, 11.

<span id="fn_1229"></span>[250:5](sbe1462.htm#fr_1229) Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka, loc. cit. This and the following Sutras, down to II, 6, 11,
15, are wanting in the Gu*g*arât and Dekhan MSS. except in K.

<span id="fn_1230"></span>[250:6](sbe1462.htm#fr_1230) Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka X, 1, 13.

<span id="fn_1231"></span>[250:7](sbe1462.htm#fr_1231) Govinda points
out that the completion of this Sûtra is to be found in Sûtra to. He
adds that Baudhâyana inserted Sutras 8-9 in the middle, because he was
afraid to forget the rules contained in them.

<span id="fn_1232"></span>[250:8](sbe1462.htm#fr_1232) Vish*n*u LXIV,
10, 11.

<span id="fn_1233"></span>[251:9](sbe1462.htm#fr_1233) Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka X, 1, 12.

<span id="fn_1234"></span>[251:10](sbe1462.htm#fr_1234) Taittirîya
Âra*n*yaka X, 23. Govinda says that the rule is intended to indicate
also that a person who recites sacred texts while sipping water, must do
so only after having taken water once before. K. inserts before this
Mantra, also Anuvâka 22.

<span id="fn_1235"></span>[251:11](sbe1462.htm#fr_1235) Vish*n*u LXIV,
13-14; 18-19. The Vedic passages intended <span id="page_252">p.
252</span> are found Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ IV, 1, 5, r; V, 6, 1, r; and
Taitt. Brâhma*n*a I, 4, 8. Pavitras, i.e. blades of Ku*s*a grass. 'He
performs three Prâ*n*âyâmas with the Aghamarsha*n*a hymn (Rig-veda X,
190),' i.e. he thrice suppresses his breath (prâ*n*âyâma) and recites
during each suppression the Aghamarsha*n*a three times, just as on other
occasions the Gâyatrî is recited three times.

<span id="fn_1236"></span>[252:12](sbe1462.htm#fr_1236) The first Mantra
is found Taitt. Sa*m*hitâ IV, 1, 7, 4; the third and the fourth Taitt.
Âra*n*yaka IV, 42, 32-33.

<span id="fn_1237"></span>[252:14](sbe1462.htm#fr_1237) Vish*n*u XLIV,
24. The ceremony is the so-called Tarpa*n*a, which is usually described
in the G*ri*hya-sûtras, e.g. Sâṅkhâyana IV, 9-10, and the quotations in
Professor Oldenberg's notes, Indische Studien XV, 152.
