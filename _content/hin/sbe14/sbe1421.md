### CHAPTER XVIII.

1\. They declare that the offspring of a *S*ûdra and of a female of the
Brâhma*n*a caste becomes a *K*â*nd*âla, <span
id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_542)

2\. (That of a *S*ûdra and) of a female of the Kshatriya caste, a
Vai*n*a,

3\. (That of a *S*ûdra and) of a female of the Vai*s*ya caste, an
Antyâvasâyin.

4\. They declare that the (son) begotten by a Vai*s*ya on a female of
the Brâhma*n*a caste becomes a Râmaka, <span
id="fr_543"></span>[4](#fn_543)

5\. (The son begotten by the same) on a female of the Kshatriya caste, a
Pulkasa.

6\. They declare that the (son) begotten by a Kshatriya on a female of
the Brâhma*n*a caste becomes a Sûta. <span
id="fr_544"></span>[6](#fn_544)

7\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'One may know by their
deeds those who have been begotten secretly, and to whom the stigma of
springing from unions in the inverse order of the castes attaches,
because they are destitute of virtue and good conduct.' <span
id="fr_545"></span>[7](#fn_545)

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

8\. (Children) begotten by Brâhma*n*as, Kshatriyas, and Vai*s*yas on
females of the next lower, second lower, and third lower castes become
(respectively) Ambash*th*as, Ugras, and Nishâdas. <span
id="fr_546"></span>[8](#fn_546)

9\. (The son of a Brâhma*n*a and) of a *S*ûdra woman (is) a Pâra*s*ava.

10\. They declare that the condition of a Pâra*s*ava is that of one who,
though living, is (as impure) as a corpse. <span
id="fr_547"></span>[10](#fn_547)

11\. Some call that *S*ûdra race a burial-ground. <span
id="fr_548"></span>[11](#fn_548)

12\. Therefore (the Veda) must not be recited in the presence of a
*S*ûdra.

13\. Now they quote also the (following) verses, which Yama proclaimed:

'The wicked *S*ûdra-race is manifestly a burial-ground. Therefore (the
Veda) must never be recited in the presence of a *S*ûdra.'

14\. 'Let him not give advice to a *S*ûdra, nor what remains from his
table, nor (remnants of) offerings (to the gods); nor let him explain
the holy law to such a man, nor order him (to perform) a penance.' <span
id="fr_549"></span>[14](#fn_549)

15\. 'He who declares the law to such a man, and he who instructs him in
(the mode of) expiating (sin), sinks together with that very man into
the dreadful hell, (called) Asa*m*v*ri*ta.'

16\. 'If ever a worm is produced in an open wound (on his body), he
shall purify himself by the Prâ*g*âpatya penance, and give gold, a cow,
(and) a garment as presents (to Brâhma*n*as).' <span
id="fr_550"></span>[16](#fn_550)

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

17\. Let him not approach a wife of the *S*ûdra caste after he has built
the fire-altar for a *S*rauta-sacrifice.

18\. For a *S*ûdra-wife who belongs to the black race, (is espoused) for
pleasure, not in order to fulfil the law.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[94:1](sbe1421.htm#fr_542) **XVIII**. Vish*n*u
XVI, 6.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[94:4](sbe1421.htm#fr_543) K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita
reads Romaka, 'a Roman,' for Râmaka, and the B. MS. supports him. The
other MSS., including I. O. 913, give the reading adopted above. I
prefer it, as there is no reason to assume that the Vâsish*th*a
Dharma*s*âstra belongs to the late period when the Hindus had become
aware of the existence of the Roman empire. On the other hand, it may be
urged that Romaka is a correction which would easily suggest itself to a
Pa*nd*it, who was unable to find a parallel passage in which the word
Râmaka occurs.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[95:10](sbe1421.htm#fr_547) I omit the words
*s*ava iti m*ri*tâkhyâ, 'a corpse is another name for one who has died,'
as an interpolation.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[95:14](sbe1421.htm#fr_549)-15. Identical with
Manu IV, 80-81.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[95:16](sbe1421.htm#fr_550) A Prâ*g*âpatya
penance, i.e. a K*rikkh*ra, see below, XXI, 20. <span id="page_96">p.
96</span> The verse belongs rather to the section on penances, and seems
to have been entered here merely because it stood in Yama's text with
the other two, and the author, to use a homely Indian comparison, 'did
not disdain to catch a fish, though he went to fetch water.'
