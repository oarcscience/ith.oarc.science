### CHAPTER XXII.

1\. Now, indeed, man (in) this (world) speaks an untruth, or sacrifices
for men unworthy to offer a sacrifice, or accepts what ought not to be
accepted, or eats forbidden food, or practises what ought not to be
practised. <span id="fr_636"></span>[1](#fn_636)

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

2\. They are in doubt if he shall perform a penance for such (a deed),
or if he shall not do it.

3\. (Some) declare that he shall not do it,

4\. Because the deed does not perish.

5\. (The correct view is, that) he shall perform (a penance), because it
is enjoined in the revealed texts, <span id="fr_637"></span>[5](#fn_637)

6\. 'He who offers a horse-sacrifice conquers all sin, he destroys the
guilt of the murder of a Brâhma*n*a.'

7\. (Moreover), 'Let an Abhi*s*asta offer a Gosava or an
Agnish*t*ut-sacrifice,'

8\. Reciting the Veda, austerity, a sacrifice, fasting, giving gifts are
the means for expiating such a (blamable act).

9\. (The purificatory texts are) the Upanishads, the Vedântas, the
Sa*m*hitâ-text of all the Vedas, the (Anuvâkas called) Madhu, the (hymn
of) Aghamarsha*n*a,  <span id="fr_638"></span>[9](#fn_638)

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

the Atharva*s*iras, the (Anuvâkas called) Rudras, the Purusha-hymn, the
two Sâmans called Râ*g*a*n*a and Rauhi*n*eya, the Kûshmâ*nd*as, the
Pâvamânîs, and the Sâvitrî,

10\. Now they quote also (the following verse): 'He who performs once in
each season the offerings to Vai*s*vânara and Vratapati and the
Pavitresh*t*i sanctifies ten ancestors.' <span
id="fr_639"></span>[10](#fn_639)

11\. To live on milk alone, as if one were fasting, to eat fruit only,
(to live on) barley gruel prepared of a handful of grain, to eat gold,
to drink Soma (are modes of subsistence which) purify. <span
id="fr_640"></span>[11](#fn_640)

12\. All mountains, all rivers, holy lakes, places of pilgrimage, the
dwellings of *Ri*shis, cowpens, and temples of the gods (are) places
(which destroy sin).

13\. A year, a month, twenty-four days, twelve days, six days, three
days, a day and a night are the periods (for penances).

14\. These (acts) may be optionally performed when no (particular
penance) has been prescribed,

15\. (Viz.) for great sins difficult (penances), and for trivial faults
easy ones.

16\. The K*rikkh*ra and the Atik*rikkh*ra (as well as) the
*K*ândrâya*n*a are penances for all (offences).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_636"></span>[115:1](sbe1425.htm#fr_636) **XXII**. As this
chapter is almost identical with and probably copied from Baudhâyana
III, 10, and Gautama XIX, the division of the Sûtras has not been made
in accordance with K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita's commentary, but agrees with
that of the chapter in Gautama's Dharma*s*âstra. The notes to the
translation of the <span id="page_116">p. 116</span> latter work must be
consulted for the explanation of the more difficult passages.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[116:5](sbe1425.htm#fr_637)-7. The text appears
here to be corrupt. After Sûtra 5, Baudhâyana III, 10, 6 (Gautama XIX,
7), Puna*h* stomena ya*g*eta puna*h* savanamâyântîti vi*gñ*âyate,' It is
declared in the Veda, "Let him offer a Puna*h*stoma-sacrifice, (those
who offer it) again come to partake of (the libations of) Soma,"' has
been left out. This omission caused the insertion of the words
tasmâ*kkh*rutinidar*s*anât \[dar*s*anât, Bh. F.\], ('because it is
enjoined in the revealed texts,') at the end of Sutra 5. The proof that
the sixth Sûtra of Baudhâyana has been accidentally omitted is furnished
by the fact That several MSS. of Vasish*th*a read iti *k*a after yo
’*s*vamedhena ya*g*ate (Vas. XXII, 6). This *k*a has no meaning, except
if another Vedic passage preceded Sutra. 6. In order to escape this
difficulty, K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita writes yo ’*s*vamedhena ya*g*ata iti,
and begins the next Sûtra with iti *k*a, which he explains by
'moreover.'

<span id="fn_638"></span>[116:9](sbe1425.htm#fr_638)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita gives before 'Vedântas' another word vedâdaya*h*,
which he explains by 'the Vedas, Sm*ri*tis, and Purâ*n*as.'

<span id="fn_639"></span>[117:10](sbe1425.htm#fr_639)
K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita takes the last word da*s*apûrusham to mean ten
ancestors and ten descendants.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[117:11](sbe1425.htm#fr_640) 'As if one were
fasting,' i.e. in small quantities.--K*ri*sh*n*apa*nd*ita.
