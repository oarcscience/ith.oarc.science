### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 1.

Now, therefore, (we will speak) of those who desire (to fulfil) the
duties of Sâlînas (dwellers in houses), Yâyâvaras (wanderers), and
*K*akra*k*aras (circle-goers), who subsist by nine (different) means of
livelihood.

2\. The term livelihood' (v*ri*tti) is used because they subsist thereby
(tadvartanât).

3\. The word Sâlîna (is used) because they dwell in houses (*s*âlâ).

4\. To be a Yâyâvara (means that one) goes on by means of a most
excellent livelihood (v*ri*ttyâ varayâ yâti).

5\. The term *K*akra*k*ara is derived from going by turns (to the houses
of rich men). <span id="fr_1329"></span>[5](#fn_1329)

6\. We will explain those (above-mentioned means of livelihood) in their
proper order.

7\. They are nine, (viz.) Sha*nn*ivartanî, Kauddâli, Dhruvâ,
Samprakshâlanî, Samûhâ, Pâlanî, Silo*ñkh*â, Kapotâ, and
Siddho*ñkh*â. <span id="fr_1330"></span>[7](#fn_1330)

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

8\. (In addition) to these there is a tenth way of living, viz.
forest-life.

9\. (If he desires to adopt) any of the nine ways of living,

10\. He causes the hair of his head, his beard, the hair on his body,
and his nails to be cut, and besides gets ready (the following objects),

11\. (Viz.) the skin of a black antelope, a water-pot, a staff, a yoke
for carrying burdens, (and) a sickle. <span
id="fr_1331"></span>[11](#fn_1331)

12\. He desires to go forth, after having offered a Traidhâtavîya
(offering) or a Vai*s*vânarî (ish*t*i). <span
id="fr_1332"></span>[12](#fn_1332)

13\. Now on the (following) morning, after the sun has risen, he makes
the sacred fires burn brightly, melts butter on the Gârhapatya fire,
cleanses it (with Ku*s*a grass), heats the (spoons called) Sru*k* and
Sruva, cleans (them), takes out four (spoonfuls of butter) in the
Sru*k*, and offers the Vâstoshpatîya (oblation) in the Âhavanîya fire
according to (the rules of his) Sûtra. <span
id="fr_1333"></span>[13](#fn_1333)

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

14\. Having recited the Puronuvâkyâ (verse), 'O lord of the dwelling,
permit us,' &c., he offers (the oblation) with the Yâ*g*yâ verse, 'O
lord of the dwelling, with thy kind company,' &c. <span
id="fr_1334"></span>[14](#fn_1334)

15\. Some (declare that) every person who has kindled the sacred fires
(shall offer these Homas).

16\. Others (say that) a Yâyâvara alone (shall do it).

17\. After departing (from his house), he stops at the extremity of the
village, or at the extremity of the boundary of the village, builds
there a hut or a cottage, and enters that. <span
id="fr_1335"></span>[17](#fn_1335)

18\. Let him use the skin of the black antelope and the other (objects)
which he has prepared for the several purposes which they are intended
to serve.

19\. Known (is) the (duty of) serving the fires; known (is) the (duty
of) offering the new and full moon sacrifices; known (is) the successive
performance of the five Mahâya*gñ*as; it is seen that the vegetables,
which have been produced, are offered. <span
id="fr_1336"></span>[19](#fn_1336)

20\. He hallows those (vegetables), either (reciting the text),' I offer
what is agreeable to all the gods,' or silently, and cooks (them). <span
id="fr_1337"></span>[20](#fn_1337)

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

21\. For such (a man the duty of) teaching, sacrificing for others,
accepting gifts, and (performing) other sacrifices (than those
mentioned) ceases. <span id="fr_1338"></span>[21](#fn_1338)

22\. (The use of) sacrificial food fit to be eaten during the
performance of a vow is seen;

23\. That is as follows: (his food may be) mixed with clarified butter
or sour milk, (it must) not (contain) pungent condiments or salt, nor
meat, nor (be) stale.

24: (He shall remain) chaste, or approach (his wife) in season.

25\. (It is necessary) to have the hair of his head, his beard, the hair
on his body, and his nails cut on each Parva day, and the rules of
purification (are obligatory on him).

26\. Now they quote also (the following verses): 'Two kinds of
purification, which the *S*ish*t*as reverentially practise, are
mentioned in the Veda,--external (purification), which consists in the
removal of impure stains and foul smells, and internal (purification),
which consists in the abstention from injuring live creatures.'

27\. 'The body is purified by water, the understanding by knowledge, the
soul of beings by abstention from injuring, (and) the internal organ by
truth.' <span id="fr_1339"></span>[27](#fn_1339)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1329"></span>[284:5](sbe1473.htm#fr_1329) **1**. Govinda
says that *K*akra*k*ara is another name for Yâyâvara, and that
anukrama*k*ara*n*a, 'going by turns,' means going successively to the
houses of Brâhma*n*as, Kshatriyas, and Vai*s*yas.

<span id="fn_1330"></span>[284:7](sbe1473.htm#fr_1330) The terms left
untranslated are fully explained in the next <span id="page_285">p.
285</span> chapter. All the MSS. read kauntâlî for kauddâlî, which
occurs in the commentary alone.

<span id="fn_1331"></span>[285:11](sbe1473.htm#fr_1331) The vîvadha, 'a
yoke for carrying burdens,' consists usually of a bamboo pole, to the
ends of which two ropes are attached for fastening the loads. Kuthahârî,
'a sickle,' seems to be the name of a particular kind of sickle, since
Govinda explains it by vâsavasâsanadâtram. He adds that the term
includes 'a spade' (kuddâla) and other implements.

<span id="fn_1332"></span>[285:12](sbe1473.htm#fr_1332) The meaning is
that on the evening before his departure from the old home he is to
offer the Traidhâtavîya-homa. According to the *S*rauta-sûtras (see the
Petersb. Dict. s. v. traidhâtavî) the latter offering always occurs at
the end of a great sacrifice. Hence it is appropriate for a person who
wishes to begin a new mode of life.

<span id="fn_1333"></span>[285:13](sbe1473.htm#fr_1333) This is the
leave-taking from the old dwelling.

<span id="fn_1334"></span>[286:14](sbe1473.htm#fr_1334) The two verses
occur Taittirîya Sa*m*hitâ III, 4, 10, I. It is specially mentioned by
Sâya*n*a that the two verses have to be recited by an Agnihotrin on
departing from his home.

<span id="fn_1335"></span>[286:17](sbe1473.htm#fr_1335) Ma*th*a, 'a
cottage,' is, according to Govinda, a house resting on many posts or
pillars, while ku*t*î is the simple shed with four posts and a roof of
leaves.

<span id="fn_1336"></span>[286:19](sbe1473.htm#fr_1336) The last clause,
probably, is meant to prescribe a simpler form of the Vai*s*vadeva.

<span id="fn_1337"></span>[286:20](sbe1473.htm#fr_1337) Govinda adds
that the meaning is that the sacrificer shall eat the boiled rice in
silence.

<span id="fn_1338"></span>[287:21](sbe1473.htm#fr_1338) Govinda adds
that the obligation of performing other meritorious deeds, such as
digging wells and tanks (pûrta), also ceases.

<span id="fn_1339"></span>[287:27](sbe1473.htm#fr_1339) Vasish*th*a III,
60.
