### PRA*S*NA III, ADHYÂYA 5.

1\. Now we will explain the rule of the most holy Aghamarsha*n*a. <span
id="fr_1356"></span>[1](#fn_1356)

2\. He goes to a bathing-place and bathes (there). Dressed in a pure
dress let him raise, close to the water, an altar, and moistening his
clothes by one (application of water), and filling his hand once (with
water), let him recite the Aghamarsha*n*a hymn (in the manner of his
daily) private recitation. <span id="fr_1357"></span>[2](#fn_1357)

3\. (Let him repeat it) one hundred times in the morning, one hundred
times at midday, and one hundred times or an unlimited number of times
in the afternoon.

4\. When the stars have risen, let him partake of gruel prepared of one
handful of barley.

5\. After seven (days and) nights he is freed from all minor sins
(upapâtaka), whether they have been committed intentionally or
unintentionally, after twelve (days and) nights (from all other sins)
excepting the murder of a learned Brâhma*n*a, the violation of a Guru's
bed, stealing gold, and drinking Surâ. <span

6\. After twenty-one (days and) nights he over-comes even those (crimes)
and conquers them.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

7\. He overcomes everything, he conquers all, he obtains the reward of
all sacrifices, he has bathed at all sacred bathing-places, he has
performed the vows required for (the study of) all the Vedas, he becomes
known to all the gods, he sanctifies a company (of Brâhma*n*as) by
merely looking (at them), and his undertakings are successful. Thus
speaks Baudhâyana. <span id="fr_1359"></span>[7](#fn_1359)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1356"></span>[296:1](sbe1477.htm#fr_1356) **5**.
Vasish*th*a XXVI, S.

<span id="fn_1357"></span>[296:2](sbe1477.htm#fr_1357) Stha*nd*ila, 'an
altar,' is a slightly raised mound of earth, which, according to
Govinda, in this case must have the shape of the sun's disc. According
to the same authority the hand of the performer must remain filled with
water as long as the recitation lasts, and the perform, stands behind
the altar facing the east.

<span id="fn_1358"></span>[296:5](sbe1477.htm#fr_1358) Regarding the
pras*ri*tiyâvaka, '(subsisting on) gruel prepared from a handful of
barley,' see below, III, 6.

<span id="fn_1359"></span>[297:7](sbe1477.htm#fr_1359) Govinda is of
opinion that the words, 'thus speaks Baudhâyana,' indicate that this
part of the work has been composed by a pupil or some other person.
