# Interpretation

To interpret a prophecy is more hazardous than to make one, for a
prophecy may be vague, but an interpretation is expected to be exact.

I will not venture to interpret any of the predictions, but only chance
to suggest the meaning of some of them.

Ingenious readers are welcome to interpret each and all of the
Prophecies in their own way. It may interest those fond of historical
research or who are keenly following the course of political events.

Religion also plays a large part in the predictions.

As history repeats itself, a prediction thought to have been
accomplished by a country, person or event,, may again be verified by
another or similar occurrence.

Paracelsus apparently saw the future as a series of cinematograph
pictures before him, but describes without chronological sequence.

As a whole the figures and chapters relate either to the Church or to
the State.

Thus IV, VII, X, XII, XV, XX, XXII, XXIII, XXV, XXVIII to XXXII
apparently

refer to religious or ecclesiastical affairs, while the rest of the
figures and prognostications relate to social and political changes.

Figures and Chapters I, II are evidently intended for France.

VI is a striking prediction of Napoleon on St. Helena. The laurel branch
on a rock.

III, V, VIII may fit Kaiser Wilhelm.

IX, 'The wild Lion, that is Bohemia, will again enter the Church,' etc.
Paracelsus Opera, Strassburg ed., vol. ii, p. 625.

IV, VII, X, XII, XV, XXVIII, XXX relate to the Pope and the Catholic
Church.

XVI, Old Theology.

XVII, XXIX, XXXI, The New Religion.

XVIII, XIX, Germany.

XIII, XIV, Austria.

XX, Materialism.

XXI, The Turk drowning in the Bosphorus, and of Turkey in Europe.

XXII, Knight and Monk, Aristocracy and Clergy.

XXIII, While Theology disputes, the Mystic steals away the Truth of
Religion.

XXIV, A strange forecast.

XXV, Rationalism.
