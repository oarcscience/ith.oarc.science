<P>To interpret a prophecy is more hazardous than to make one, for a prophecy may be vague, but an interpretation is expected to be exact.</P>
<P>I will not venture to interpret any of the predictions, but only chance to suggest the meaning of some of them.</P>
<P>Ingenious readers are welcome to interpret each and all of the Prophecies in their own way. It may interest those fond of historical research or who are keenly following the course of political events.</P>
<P>Religion also plays a large part in the predictions.</P>
