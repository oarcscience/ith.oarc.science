### NEWBURY'S OLD ELM

Among the venerable relics of Newbury few are better known and more
prized than the old elm. It is a stout tree, with a girth of twenty-four
and a half feet, and is said to have been standing since 1713. In that
year it was planted by Richard Jacques, then a youthful rustic, who had
a sweetheart, as all rustics have, and adored her as rustics and other
men should do. On one of his visits he stayed uncommonly late. It was
nearly ten o'clock when he set off for home. The town had been abed an
hour or more; the night was murky and oppressively still, and
corpse-candles were dancing in the graveyard. Witch times had not been
so far agone that he felt comfortable, and, lest some sprite, bogie,
troll, or goblin should waylay him, he tore an elm branch from a tree
that grew before his sweetheart's house, and flourished it as he walked.
He reached home without experiencing any of the troubles that a
superstitious fancy had conjured. As he was about to cast the branch
away a comforting vision of his loved one came into his mind, and he
determined to plant the branch at his own door, that in the hours of
their separation he might be reminded of her who dwelt beneath the
parent tree. He did so. It rooted and grew, and when the youth and maid
had long been married, their children and grandchildren sported beneath
its branches.
