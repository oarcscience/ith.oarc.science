### THE OLD STONE MILL

If the round tower at Newport was not Benedict Arnold's wind-mill, and
any one or two of several other things, it is probably a relic of the
occupancy of this country by Thorwald and his Norsemen. After coasting
Wonderstrands (Cape Cod), in the year 1007, they built a town that is
known to historians—if not in their histories—as Norumbega, the lost
city of New England. It is now fancied that the city stood on the
Charles River, near Waltham, Massachusetts, where a monument may be
erected, but it is also believed that they reached the neighborhood of
Newport, Rhode Island. After this tower—popularly called the old stone
mill-was built, a seer among the Narragansetts had a vision in which he
foresaw that when the last remnant of the structure had fallen, and not
one stone had been left on another, the Indian race would vanish from
this continent. The work of its extermination seems, indeed, to have
begun with the possession of the coast by white men, and the fate of the
aborigines is easily read.
