### HEARTBREAK HILL

The name of Heartbreak Hill pertains, in the earliest records of
Ipswich, to an eminence in the middle of that town on which there was a
large Indian settlement, called Agawam, before the white men settled
there and drove the inhabitants out. Ere the English colony had been
firmly planted a sailor straying ashore came among the simple natives of
Agawam, and finding their ways full of novelty he lived with them for a
time. When he found means to return to England he took with him the love
of a maiden of the tribe, but the girl herself he left behind,
comforting her on his departure with an assurance that before many moons
he would return. Months went by and extended into years, and every day
the girl climbed Heartbreak Hill to look seaward for some token of her
lover. At last a ship was seen trying to make harbor, with a furious
gale running her close to shore, where breakers were lashing the rocks
and sand. The girl kept her station until the vessel, becoming
unmanageable, was hurled against the shore and smashed into a thousand
pieces. As its timbers went tossing away on the frothing billows a
white, despairing face was lifted to hers for an instant; then it sank
and was seen nevermore—her lover's face. The "dusky Ariadne" wasted fast
from that day, and she lies buried beside the ledge that was her
watch-tower.
