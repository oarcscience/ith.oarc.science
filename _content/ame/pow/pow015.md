TO MAKE A WAND FOR SEARCHING FOR IRON, ORE OR WATER.

On the first night of Christmas, between 11 and 12 o'clock, break off
from any tree a young twig of one year's growth, in the three highest
names (Father. Son. and Holy Ghost), at the same time facing toward
sunrise. Whenever you apply this wand in searching for anything apply it
three times. The twig must be forked, and each end of the fork must be
held in one hand, so that the third and thickest part of it stands up,
but do not hold it too tight. Strike the ground with

the thickest end, and that which you desire will appear immediately, if
there is any in the ground where you strike. The words to be spoken when
the wand is thus applied are as follows:

Archangel Gabriel, I conjure thee in the name of God, the Almighty, to
tell me, is there any water here or not? do tell me! + + +

If you are searching for Iron or Ore, you have to say the same, only
mention the name of what you are searching for.
