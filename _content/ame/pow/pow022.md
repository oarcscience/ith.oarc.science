*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO CURE THE POLL-EVIL IN HORSES, IN TWO OR THREE APPLICATIONS.

Break off three twigs from a cherry-tree: one towards morning, one
towards evening, and one towards mid. night. Cut three small pieces off
the hind part of your shirt, and wrap each of those twigs in one of
these pieces; then clean the poll-evil with the twigs and leave them
under-the eaves. The ends of the twigs which had been in the wound must
be turned toward the north; after which you must do your business on
them, that is to say, you must dirty them; then cover it, leaving the
rags around the twigs. After all this the wound must be again stirred
with the three twigs, in one or two days, and the twigs placed as
before.
