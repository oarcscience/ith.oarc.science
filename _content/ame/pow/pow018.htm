<p align="CENTER">A SAFE REMEDY FOR VARIOUS ULCERS, BOILS AND OTHER DEFECTS.</p> 
<p>Take the root of an iron-weed, and tie it around the neck; it cures running ulcers; it also serves against obstructions in the bladder (stranguary), and cures the piles, if the roots are boiled in water with honey, and drank; it cleans and heals the lungs and effects a good breath. If this root is planted among grape vines or fruit trees, it promotes the growth very much. Children who carry it are educated without any difficulty, they become fond of all useful arts and sciences, and grow up joyfully and cheerfully.</p>
