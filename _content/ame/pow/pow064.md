TO REMOVE PAIN AND HEAL UP WOUNDS WITH THREE SWITCHES.

With this switch and Christ's dear blood,  
I banish your pain and do you good!

\+ + +

Mind it well: you must in one cut, sever from a tree, a young branch
pointing toward sunrise, and then make three pieces of it, which you
successively put in the wound. Holding them in your hand, you take the
one toward your right side first. Everything prescribed in this book
must be used three times, even if the three crosses should not be
affixed. Words are always to have an interval of half an hour, and
between the second and third time should pass a whole night, except
where it is otherwise directed. The above three sticks, after the end of
each has been put into the wound as before directed, must be put in a
piece of white paper, and placed where they will be warm and dry.
