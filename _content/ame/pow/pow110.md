*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at

A MORNING PRAYER TO BE SPOKEN BEFORE STARTING ON A JOURNEY, WHICH WILL
SAVE THE PERSON FROM ALL MISHAPS.

I (here the name is to be pronounced) will go on a journey to-day; I
will walk upon God's way, and walk where God himself did walk, and our
dear Lord Jesus Christ, and our dearest Virgin with her dear little
babe, with her seven rings and her true things. Oh, thou! my dear Lord
Jesus Christ, I am thine own, that no dog may bite me, no wolf bite me,
and no murderer secretly

approach me; save me, O my God, from sudden death! I am in God's hands,
and there I will bind myself. In God's hands I am by our Lord Jesus'
five wounds, that any gun or other arms may not do me any more harm than
the virginity of our Holy Virgin Mary was injured by the favor of her
beloved Jesus. After this say three Lord's prayers, the Ave Maria, and
the articles of faith.
