<p align="CENTER">TO PREVENT BEING CHEATED, CHARMED OR BEWITCHED, AND TO BE AT ALL TIMES BLESSED.</p> 
<p>Like unto the cup and the wine, and the holy supper, which our dear Lord Jesus Christ gave unto his dear disciples on Maunday Thursday, may the Lord Jesus guard me in daytime, and at night, that no dog may bite me, no wild beast tear me to pieces, no tree fall on me,</p> 
<p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="green">p. 55</font></A></p> 
<p>no water rise against me, no fire-arms injure me, no weapons, no steel, no iron, cut me, no fire burn me, no false sentence fall upon me, no false tongue injure me, no rogue enrage me, and that no fiends, no witchcraft and enchantment can harm me. Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS TO EFFECT THE SAME.</p> 
<p>The Holy Trinity guard me, and be and remain with me on the water and upon the land, in the water or in the fields, in cities or villages, in the whole world wherever I am. The Lord Jesus Christ protect me against all my enemies, secret or public; and may the Eternal Godhead also guard me through the bitter sufferings of Jesus Christ; his holy rosy blood, shed on the cross, assist me, J. J. Jesus has been crucified, tortured and died. These are true words, and in the same way must all words be efficacious which are here put down, and spoken in prayer by me. This shall assist me that 1 shall not be imprisoned, bound or overcome by anyone. Before me all guns or other weapons shall be of no use or power. Fire-arms, hold your fire in the almighty hand of God. Thus all fire-arms shall be charmed. + + + When the right hand of the Lord Jesus Christ was fastened to the tree, of the cross; like unto the Son of the Heavenly Father who was obedient unto death, may the Eternal Godhead protect me. by the rosy blood, by the five holy wounds on the tree of the cross; and thus must I be blessed and well protected like the cup and the wine, and the genuine true bread, which Jesus Christ gave to his disciples on the evening of Maunday Thursday. J. J. J.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">ANOTHER SIMILAR DIRECTION.</p> 
<p>The grace of God and his benevolence he with me (N). I shall now ride or walk out; and I will gird about my loins with a sure ring. So it pleases God, the Heavenly Father, he will protect me, my flesh and blood,</p> 
<p><a name="page_56"><font size="1" color="green">p. 56</font></A></p> 
<p>and all my arteries and during this day and night which I have before me; and however numerous my enemies may be, they must be dumbstruck, and all become like a dead man, white as snow, so that no one will be able to shout, cut or throw at me, or to overcome me, although he may hold rifle or steel against whomever else evil weapons and arms might be called, in his hand. My rifle shall go off like lightening, and my sword shall cut as a razor. Then wen our dear lady Mary upon a very high mountain; she looked down into a very dusky valley and beheld her dear child standing amidst the Jews, harsh, very harsh, because he was bound so harsh, because he was bound so hard; and therefore may the dear Lord Jesus Christ save me from all that is injurious to me. + + + Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">ANOTHER SIMILAR DIRECTION</p> 
<p>There walk out during this day and night, that thou mayest not let any of my enemies,, or thieves, approach me, if they do not intend to bring me what was spent from the holy altar. Because God the Lord Jews is ascended into heaven in his living body. O Lord, this is good for me this day and night. + + + Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">ANOTHER ONE LIKE IT.</p> 
<p>In the name of God I walk out. God the Father be with me, and God the Holy Ghost be by my side. Who ever is stronger than these three persons may approach my body and my life; yet whoso is not stronger than these three would much better let me be. J. J. J.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">ANOTHER ONE LIKE IT.</p> 
<p>I conjure thee, sword, sabre or knife, that mightest injure or harm me, by the priest of all prayers, who had gone into the temple at Jerusalem, and said: An edged sword shall pierce your soul that you may not injure me, who am a child of God.</p>
