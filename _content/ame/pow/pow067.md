TO MAKE HORSES THAT REFUSE THEIR FEED TO EAT AGAIN--ESPECIALLY
APPLICABLE WHEN THEY ARE AFFLICTED IN THIS MANNER ON THE PUBLIC ROADS.

Open the jaws of the horse, which refuses his feed, and knock three
times on his palate. This will certainly cause the horse to eat again
without hesitation, and to go along willingly.
