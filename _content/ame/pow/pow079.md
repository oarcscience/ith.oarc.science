TO MAKE AN OIL OUT OF PAPER, WHICH IS GOOD FOR SORE EYES.

A man from Germany informed me that to burn two sheets of white paper
would produce about three drops of oil or water, which would heal all
sores in or about the eye if rubbed with it. Any affection of the eyes
can be cured in this way, as long as the apple of the eye is sound.
