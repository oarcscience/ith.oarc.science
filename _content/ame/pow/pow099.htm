<p align="CENTER">FOR THE SCURVY AND SORE THROAT.</p> 
<p>Speak the following, and it will certainly help you: Job went through the land, holding his staff close in the hand, when God the Lord did meet him, and said to him: Job, what art thou grieved at? Job said: Oh God, why should I not be sad? My throat and my mouth are rotting away. Then said the Lord to Job: In yonder valley there is a well which will cure thee [name], and thy mouth, and thy throat, in the name of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p> 
<p>This must be spoken three times in the morning and three times in the evening; and where it reads "which will cure," you must blow three times in the child's mouth.</p>
