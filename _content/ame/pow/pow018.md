*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at

A SAFE REMEDY FOR VARIOUS ULCERS, BOILS AND OTHER DEFECTS.

Take the root of an iron-weed, and tie it around the neck; it cures
running ulcers; it also serves against obstructions in the bladder
(stranguary), and cures the piles, if the roots are boiled in water with
honey, and drank; it cleans and heals the lungs and effects a good
breath. If this root is planted among grape vines or fruit trees, it
promotes the growth very much. Children who carry it are educated
without any difficulty, they become fond of all useful arts and
sciences, and grow up joyfully and cheerfully.
