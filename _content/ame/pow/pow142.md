TO RETAIN THE RIGHT IN COURT AND COUNCIL.

Jesus Nazarenus, Rex Judeorum.

First carry these characters with you, written on paper, and then repeat
the following words: "I (*name*) appear before the house of the Judge.
Three dead men look out of the window; one having no tongue, the other
having no lungs, and the third was sick, blind and

dumb." This is intended to be used when you are standing before a court
in your right, and the judge not being favorably disposed toward you.
While on your way to the court you must repeat the benediction already
given above.
