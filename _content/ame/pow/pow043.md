*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A REMARKABLE PASSAGE FROM THE BOOK OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS.

It says: If you burn a large frog to ashes, and mix the ashes with
water, you will obtain an ointment that will, if put on any place
covered with hair, destroy the hair and prevent it from growing again.

ANOTHER PASSAGE FROM THE WORK OF ALBERTUS MAGNUS.

If you find the stone which a vulture has in his knees, and which you
may find by looking sharp, and put it in the victuals of two persons who
hate each other, it causes them to make up and be good friends.
