<p align="CENTER">A CHARM TO BE CARRIED ABOUT THE PERSON</p> 
<p>Carry these words about you, and nothing can hit you: Ananiah, Azariah, and Missel, blessed be the Lord, for he has redeemed us from hell, and has saved us from death, and he has redeemed us out of the fiery furnace and has preserved us even in the midst of the fire; in the same manner may it please him the Lord that there be no fire.</p>

<p align="CENTER">TO CHARM ENEMIES, ROBBERS AND MURDERERS</p> 
<p>God be with you, brethren; stop, ye thieves, robbers, murderers, horsemen, and soldiers, in all humility, for we have tasted the rosy blood of Jesus. Your rifles and guns will be stopped up with the holy blood of Jesus; all swords and arms are made harmless by the five holy wounds of Jesus. There are three roses upon the heart of God; the first in beneficent, the other is omnipotent, the third is his holy will. You thieves must therefore stand under it, standing still as long as I will</p> 
<p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="green">p. 52</font></A></p> 
<p>In the name of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, you are conjured and made to stand.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">A CHARM AGAINST FIRE-ARMS.</p> 
<p>Jesus passed over the Red Sea, and looked upon the land; and thus must break all ropes and bands, and thus must break all manner of fire-arms, rifles, guns, or pistols, and all false tongues be silenced. May the benediction of God on creating the first man always be upon me; the benediction spoken by God, when he ordered in a dream that Joseph and Mary together with Jesus should flee into Egypt, be, upon me always, and may the holy t be ever lovely and beloved in my right hand I journey through the country at large where no one is robbed, killed or murdered--where no one can do me any injury, and where not even a dog could bite me, or any other animal tear me to pieces. In all things let me be protected, as also my flesh and blood, against sins and false tongues which reach from the earth up to heaven. by the power of the four Evangelists, in the name of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost. Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">ANOTHER FOR THE SAME.</p> 
<p>I (name) conjure ye guns, swords and knives, as well as all other kinds of arms, by the spear that pierced the side of God, and opened it so that blood and water could flow out, that ye do not injure me, a servant of God, in the + + +. I conjure ye, by Saint Stephen, who was stoned by the Virgin, that ye cannot injure me who am a servant of God, in the name of + + +. Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">PROTECTION AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WEAPONS.</p> 
<p>Jesus, God and man, do thou protect me against all manner of guns, fire-arms, long or short, of any kind of metal. Keep thou thy fire, like the Virgin Mary, who kept her fire both before and after her birth. May</p> 
<p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="green">p. 53</font></A></p> 
<p>Christ bind up all fire-arms after the manner of his having bound up himself in humility while in the flesh. Jesus, do thou render harmless all arms and weapons, like unto the husband of Mary the mother of God, he having been harmless likewise. Furthermore, do thou guard the three holy drops of blood which Christ sweated on the Mount of Olives. Jesus Christ! do thou protect me against being killed and against burning fires. Jesus, do thou not suffer me to be killed, much less to be damned, without having received the Lord's Supper. May God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, assist me in this. Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">A CHARM AGAINST SHOOTING, CUTTING OR THRUSTING.</p> 
<p>In the name of J. J. J. Amen. I (<i>name</i>); Jesus Christ is the true salvation; Jesus Christ governs, reigns, defeats and conquers every enemy, visible or invisible; Jesus, be thou with me at all times, forever and ever, upon all roads and ways, upon the water and the land, on the mountain and in the valley, in the house and in the yard, in the whole world wherever I am, stand, run, ride or drive; whether I sleep or wake, eat or drink, there be thou also, Lord Jesus Christ, at all times, late and early, every hour, every moment; and in all my goings in or goings out. Those five holy red wounds, oh, Lord Jesus Christ, may they guard me against all fire-arms, be they secret or public, that they cannot injure me or do me any harm whatever, in the name of + + +. May Jesus, with his guardianship and protection, shield me (<i>name</i>) always from daily commission of sins, worldly injuries and injustice, from contempt, from pestilence and other diseases, from fear, torture, and great suffering, from all evil intentions, from false tongues and old clatter-brains; and that no kind of fire-arms can inflict any injury to my body, do thou take care of me. + + +. And that no band of</p> 
<p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="green">p. 54</font></A></p> 
<p>thieves nor Gypsies, highway robbers, incendiaries, witches and other evil spirits may secretly enter my house or premises, nor break in; may the dear Virgin Mary, and all children who are in heaven with God, in eternal joys, protect and guard me against them; and the glory of God the Father shall strengthen me, the. wisdom of God the Son shall enlighten me, and the grace of God the Holy Ghost shall empower me from this hour unto all eternity. Amen.</p> 
<p align="CENTER">TO CHARM GUNS AND OTHER ARMS.</p> 
<p>The blessing which came from heaven at the birth of Christ be with me (<i>name</i>). The blessing of God at the creation of the first man be with me; the blessing of Christ on being imprisoned, bound, lashed, crowned so dreadfully, and beaten, and dying on the cross, be with me; the blessing which the Priest spoke over the tender, joyful corpse of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with me; the constancy of the Holy Mary and all the saints of God. of the three holy kings, Caspar, Melchior and Balthasar, be with me; the holy four Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, be with me; the Archangels St. Michael, St. Gabriel, St. Raphael and St. Uriel, be with me; the twelve holy messengers of the Patriarchs and all the Hosts of Heaven, be with me; and the inexpressible number of all the Saints be with me. Amen.</p> <b>
