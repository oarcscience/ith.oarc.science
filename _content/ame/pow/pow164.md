FOR THE STING OF A WASP OR BEE.

A Liverpool paper states as follows: "A few days ago, happening to be in
the country, we witnessed the efficacy of the remedy for the sting of a
wasp mentioned in one of our late papers. A little boy was stung
severely and was in great torture, until an onion was applied to the
part affected, when the cure was instantaneous. This important and
simple remedy cannot be too generally known, and we pledge ourselves to
the facts above stated."
