HOW TO BELIEVE PERSONS OR ANIMALS AFTER BEING BEWITCHED.

Three false tongues have pound thee, three holy tongues have spoken for
thee. The first is God, the Father, the second is God the Son, and the
third is God the Holy Ghost. They will give you blood and flesh, peace
and comfort. Flesh and blood are grown upon thee, born on thee, and lost
on thee. If any trample on thee with his horse, God will bless thee, and
the holy Ciprian; has any woman trampled on thee, God and the body of
Mary shall bless thee; if an servant has given you trouble, I bless thee
through God and the laws of heaven; if any servant-maid or woman has led
you astray, God and the heavenly constellations shall less thee. Heaven
is above thee, the earth is beneath thee, and thou art between. I bless
thee against all tramplings by horses. Our dear Lord Jesus Christ walked
about in his bitter afflictions and death; and all the Jews that had
spoken and promised, trembled in their falsehoods and mockery. Look, now
trembleth the Son of God, as if he had the itch, said the Jews. And then
spake Jesus: have not the itch and no one shall have it. Whoever will
assist me to carry the cross him will I free from the itch, in the name
of God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
