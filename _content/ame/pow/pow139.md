TO TAKE THE PAIN OUT OF A FRESH WOUND.

Our dear Lord Jesus Christ had a great many biles and wounds, and yet he
never had them dressed. They did not grow old, they were not cut, nor
were they ever found running. Jonas was blind, and I spoke to the
heavenly child, as true as five holy wounds were inflicted.
