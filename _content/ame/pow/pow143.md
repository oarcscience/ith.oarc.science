TO STOP BLEEDING AT ANY TIME.

Write the name of the four principal waters of the whole world, flowing
out of Paradise, on a paper, namely: Pison, Gihon, Hedekiel and Pheat,
and put it on the wound. In the first book of Moses, the second chapter,
verses 11, 12, 13, you will find them. You will find this effective.

ANOTHER WAY TO STOP BLOOD.

As soon as you cut yourself you must say: "Blessed wound, blessed hour,
blessed be the day on which Jesus Christ was born, in the name + + +
Amen.

ANOTHER SIMILAR PRESCRIPTION.

Breathe three times upon the patient, and say the Lord's Prayer three
times until the words, "upon the earth," and the bleeding will be
stopped.

ANOTHER STILL MORE CERTAIN WAY TO STOP BLEEDING.

If the bleeding will not stop, or if a vein has been cut, then lay the
following on it, and it will stop that hour. Yet if any one does not
believe this, let him write the letters upon a knife and stab an
irrational animal, and he will not be able to draw blood. And whosoever
carries this about him will be safe against all his enemies.

I. m. I. K. I. B. I. P. a. x. v. ss. Ss. vas,  
I. P. O. unay Lit. Dom. mper vobism.

And whenever a woman is going to give birth to a child, or is otherwise
afflicted, let her have this letter about her person; it will certainly
be of avail.
