A VERY GOOD REMEDY FOR THE WHITE SWELLING.

Take a quart of unslacked lime, and pour two parts of water on it; stir
it well and let it stand over night. The scum that collects on the
lime-water must be taken off, and a pint of flax-seed oil poured in,
after which it must be stirred until it becomes somewhat consistent .
then put it in a pot or pan, and add a little lard and wax; melt it
well, and make a plaster, and apply it to the parts affected-the plaster
should be renewed every day, or at least every other day, until the
swelling is gone.
