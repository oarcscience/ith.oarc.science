AGAINST BURNS.

Our dear Lord Jesus Christ going on a journey, saw a firebrand burning;
it was Saint Lorenzo stretched out on a roast. He rendered him
assistance and consolation; he lifted his divine hand and blessed the
brand; he stopped it from spreading deeper and wider. Thus may the
burning be blessed in the name of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost.
Amen.

ANOTHER REMEDY FOR BURNS.

Clear out, brand, but never in; be thou cold or hot, thou must cease to
burn. May God guard thy blood and thy flesh, thy marrow and thy bones,
and every artery, great or small. They all shall be guarded and
protected in the name of God against inflammation and mortification, in
the name of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. Amen.
