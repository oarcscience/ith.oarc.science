HOW TO CURE WEAKNESS OF THE LIMBS.

Take the buds of the birch tree, or the inner bark of the root of the
tree at the time of the budding of the birch, and make a tea of it, and
drink it occasionally through the day. Yet, after having used it for two
weeks, it must be discontinued for a while, before it is resorted to
again; and during the two weeks of its use it is well at times to use
water for a day instead of the tea.

ANOTHER REMEDY FOR WEAKNESS.

Take Bittany and St. John's wort, and put them in good old rye whiskey.
To drink some of this in the morning before having taken anything else,
is very wholesome and good. A tea made of the acorns of the white oak is
very good for weakness of the limbs.
