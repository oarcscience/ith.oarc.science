*Pow-Wows, or Long Lost Friend*, by John George Hoffman, \[1820\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

FOR THE SCURVY AND SORE THROAT.

Speak the following, and it will certainly help you: Job went through
the land, holding his staff close in the hand, when God the Lord did
meet him, and said to him: Job, what art thou grieved at? Job said: Oh
God, why should I not be sad? My throat and my mouth are rotting away.
Then said the Lord to Job: In yonder valley there is a well which will
cure thee \[name\], and thy mouth, and thy throat, in the name of God
the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

This must be spoken three times in the morning and three times in the
evening; and where it reads "which will cure," you must blow three times
in the child's mouth.
