				<h4>PROCEEDINGS</h4>
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  The official start of our 
 
       first public hearing is going to be an 
 
       extraordinarily important job, we believe, for the

       country.  In my capacity as the Chairman of the 
 
       Commission on Terrorist Attacks in the United 
 
       States, I am honored and humbled to convene this 
 
       first public hearing. 
 
        <p>Since my colleagues and I were appointed

       at the turn of the year, many people from all walks 
 
       of life, and actually from other nations even, have 
 
       inquired about our work.  And many offered their 
 
       help.  What they really wanted, however, were 
 
       answers.

        <p>Their questions fall into three basic 
 
       categories:  First, they wanted to know what led to 
 
       the terrorist attacks upon our country September 
 
       11th, that took the lives of almost 3,000 Americans 
 
       and forever changed the lives of millions of

       others.  There was not a person alive that day 
 
       whose life was not changed in some way by September 
 
       11th.  
  
        <p>Those who perished in those attacks or 
 
       those who were wounded had done nothing to warrant 
 
       it.  They were going about their business.  They 
 
       were doing their jobs.  They were flying to see

       family or to conduct business or to spend time with 
 
       loved ones or going or returning from vacations. 
 
        <p>They didn't personally know their 
 
       assassins.  Those who attacked them had no 
 
       particular human target in mind.  They just wanted

       to kill as many people as possible.  They didn't 
 
       care who the victims were.  All they had to do to 
 
       warrant their killing and maiming, they wanted to 
 
       target buildings or certain airplanes. 
 
        <p>Most of whom who died or were injured were

       Americans.  The deceased and survivors were of all 
 
       backgrounds, races, religions, creeds and even 
 
       nationalities.  They only had one thing in common. 
 
       They were all at the time doing their best to keep 
 
       ours, the finest, strongest, most productive,

       creative, diverse and welcoming democracy that has 
 
       ever been created on the face of the earth, and, 
 
       you see, that's what the terrorists sought to  
  
       destroy. 
 
        <p>They wanted to extinguish the very 
 
       freedom, vitality and diversity that characterizes 
 
       the American way of life and makes it the bastion

       of hope for so many others in the world. 
 
        <p>And they sought to do this by killing 
 
       thousands of our people, disrupting the life 
 
       pattern of this country as a whole, and by 
 
       instilling what they hoped was fear, not only in

       our nation but in all nations that allow ideas to 
 
       compete freely and fairly in the open marketplace. 
 
        <p>The American people want the answers to so 
 
       many questions around 9/11.  They want to know who 
 
       were these people and how could they have done this

       terrible thing to so many innocent people.  What 
 
       kind of fanaticism drove them to do this? 
 
        <p>They also want to know how such a 
 
       dastardly attack could occur and succeed in a 
 
       nation as strong as ours, militarily, economically

       and technologically.  They want to know what, if 
 
       anything, went wrong on that pacific day, what 
 
       evidence did those charged with safeguarding the  
  
       security of us all, what evidence did they have that 
 
       might somehow have averted this tragedy and how did 
 
       they use it. 
 
        <p>What evidence then was available?  What

       could have been done to avert this tragedy?  What 
 
       if people had acted differently on that day and the 
 
       days leading up to September 11th?  And finally, 
 
       most importantly, they want to know what can be 
 
       done to prevent future terrorist attacks of this

       scale and how can we make this country safer for 
 
       all its people. 
 
        <p>In conversations I have had with family 
 
       members of people who perished in the attacks 
 
       against the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and

       in that plane crash in a small field in Somerset 
 
       County, Pennsylvania, they told me time and again 
 
       that the one thing they were concerned about was to 
 
       make sure that their loved ones had not died in 
 
       vain.

        <p>It's horrible enough to see someone you 
 
       love struck down in this manner.  It would be even 
 
       worse for the rest of us to do nothing to prevent  
  
       other families from having to endure such grief and 
 
       pain in the future. 
 
        <p>As Chairman of the Commission, I want to 
 
       say that I consider this task the most important

       part of our work.  We must not allow the people who 
 
       were struck down to simply become statistics.  Each 
 
       represented a life that was interrupted.  All had 
 
       families, colleagues and friends who care deeply 
 
       about them, all who perished had dreams that are

       now unfulfilled.  All became the first casualties 
 
       of what has become a war against the United States, 
 
       declared by international terrorists. 
 
        <p>The victims did not know, when they said 
 
       good-bye to their loved ones when they departed for

       work or the airport on that fateful morning, that 
 
       they would be part of such a war.  They had no 
 
       weapons and they didn't even know the identity of 
 
       their enemies. 
 
        <p>We will, I know, in this country construct

       memorials, and we should, to honor these people, 
 
       but the greatest service we can pay those who made 
 
       the ultimate sacrifice and those who survived the  
  
       blaze is to do all we can to assure that no one 
 
       ever again experiences the kind of anguish that 
 
       they endured. 
 
        <p>I know there's nothing we can do on this

       Commission to bring anybody back to life, but those 
 
       who were taken from us on September 11th, we can 
 
       work to assure that no future families suffer in 
 
       this way, the way so many people have suffered. 
 
       And this is what our Commission intends to do.

        <p>I want to say a word or two about the 
 
       purpose of today's hearing.  In the parlance of 
 
       Congress, this is not an investigative hearing but 
 
       an informal one.  Today we will not, as we'll be 
 
       doing in the future, be cross-examining witnesses.

       The Mayor and Governor are coming.  They are coming 
 
       to welcome us.  We will have questions for them 
 
       probably later, but today we will not be doing 
 
       that. 
 
        <p>We will be doing that on, as I say, a

       number of other occasions.  And some of our 
 
       meetings will be in public, some will not be in 
 
       public because of the kind of sensitive materials  
  
       that we will be dealing with.  On those occasions, 
 
       we will be able to have extensive discussions with 
 
       many people who will be testifying today and 
 
       tomorrow.

        <p>On this first day of our hearing, we will 
 
       be seeking to ascertain what those who feel a 
 
       personal stake in our deliberations think is 
 
       important for us to study. 
 
        <p>We will hear from people who have lived

       and survived the attacks on the World Trade Center 
 
       and the Pentagon.  We will hear from 
 
       representatives of families of those who died in 
 
       those attacks.  We will hear from the governor of 
 
       this great state and the mayor of this great city.

       And finally, we will hear from a number of others 
 
       who have a particular interest in the events of 
 
       that terrible day. 
 
        <p>Tomorrow we will hear from people who have 
 
       particular expertise in national terrorism, the

       kinds of actions that made the attacks on September 
 
       11th possible, and the kinds of measures that might 
 
       be taken to avoid such future events.  
  
        <p>Before I turn over the floor to our Vice 
 
       Chairman, Lee Hamilton, I want to say a couple, two 
 
       additional things about what this Commission will 
 
       and will not attempt to do and something about the

       Commission itself. 
 
        <p>As I said, our purpose is to find out why 
 
       things happened, how they could have happened, and 
 
       what we can do to prevent their ever happening 
 
       again.  We will be following paths and we will

       follow those individual paths wherever they lead. 
 
       We may end up holding individual agencies, people 
 
       and procedures to account. 
 
        <p>But our fundamental purpose will not be to 
 
       point fingers, it is rather to answer fully the

       questions that so many still have and, most 
 
       importantly, as I say, to prevent and to do 
 
       everything we can to make the American people safer 
 
       so we will not have this kind of thing ever happen 
 
       again.

        <p>As we were getting ourselves organized, I 
 
       asked members of the Commission staff, were there 
 
       any precedents for what we were about to do.  And I  
  
       came forward with two commissions.  Both came into 
 
       being in the aftermath of other national tragedies. 
 
        <p>Those who are old enough to remember the 
 
       bombing of Pearl Harbor and the assassination of

       President Kennedy remember those commissions well. 
 
       Neither fully satisfied the hopes of those that 
 
       created them. 
 
        <p>It seems there are no real precedents for 
 
       what we're about to attempt.  To succeed, we are

       going to need the cooperation of the Congress, the 
 
       national administration, federal, state and local 
 
       law enforcement and other agencies, think tanks, 
 
       foundations, university professors, business, 
 
       industry and labor, survivors, witnesses, and

       ordinary citizens.  And I thank them in advance for 
 
       their help. 
 
        <p>Finally, about the Commission itself:  We 
 
       were created by the United States Congress for a 
 
       specific purpose.  I have outlined in a general way

       what we hope to do.  The Commission operates in a 
 
       strictly nonpartisan nature.  Five of us happen to 
 
       be registered as Republicans, five of us as  
  
       Democrats, but we're not going to operate as party 
 
       members, and the staff is not partisan. 
 
        <p>All of us, in one capacity or another, 
 
       have served in government.  None of us still do.

       None of us have any agenda but getting to the truth 
 
       to make ours a safer country. 
 
        <p>I want in particular to single out the 
 
       Vice Chairman of this Commission, Lee Hamilton.  I 
 
       have long admired Congressman Hamilton for his

       public service, in the truest sense of the word, 
 
       and what he has done for this country.  I am very 
 
       honored to be able to serve with him on this 
 
       particular Commission. 
 
        <p>Today marks the first occasion when the

       American people will have an opportunity to see who 
 
       we are.  Each of us had our own reasons for 
 
       accepting the call to serve on this Commission. 
 
        <p>For eight years I have had the honor to 
 
       serve as Governor of the State of New Jersey.  I

       was born here in this great city, attended graduate 
 
       school at Columbia, met my wife here.  I've spent 
 
       almost my entire life living and working around  
  
       this region. 
 
        <p>I remember when the World Trade Center was 
 
       built.  I must have been in it hundreds of times. 
 
       I appointed half the commissions to the Port

       Authority when I was Governor.  I was well 
 
       acquainted with many of its employees and knew some 
 
       of those who died on September 11th as friends. 
 
        <p>As a private citizen, I sat on the board 
 
       of a company who lost over 80 people on that

       terrible day.  I delivered the eulogy at that 
 
       memorial service.  As a university president, I 
 
       counseled students who were grieving on that 
 
       terrible day and afterwards. 
 
        <p>Not far from where I live, a young pastor

       of a rural church that serves no more than two- or 
 
       three-thousand families told the local newspaper he 
 
       had performed nine funeral masses on a single day. 
 
       I didn't lose any member of my family on that 
 
       particular day, but I did lose a lot of friends in

       the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and that 
 
       flight. 
 
        <p>Adlai Stevenson said, when he learned of  
  
       John Kennedy's assassination, each of us who was 
 
       alive will carry the memory of that particular 
 
       death until the day of ours.  That is how we feel 
 
       about September 11th.

        <p>Thank you,  and I will now call on 
 
       Congressman Lee Hamilton, the Vice Chairman of the 
 
       Commission. 
 
        <p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  Good morning, 
 
       Governor.  Thank you for a very moving and eloquent

       statement. 
 
        <p>Governor Kean is an inspired choice to 
 
       lead this Commission.  He's the only member of the 
 
       Commission appointed by the President, and I 
 
       commend the President for his appointment.  The

       other members of the Commission are appointed by 
 
       members of Congress. 
 
        <p>I am very pleased to serve with Governor 
 
       Kean on this Commission, as Vice Chairman, and I 
 
       have appreciated already his remarkable leadership

       as I have talked with him over the phone every day 
 
       now for the past four or five months. 
 
        <p>I'm pleased and privileged to be joined by  
  
       my fellow Commissioners.  Each bring remarkable and 
 
       unique experience from public service and from 
 
       private life.  They really are an exceptional 
 
       group, a talented group, that gives me high

       confidence that this Commission will successfully 
 
       complete its awesome task.  Each of us believes 
 
       that this is as serious an undertaking as any in 
 
       which we have been involved. 
 
        <p>The Commission exists to understand what

       happened on September 11th and to protect our 
 
       nation against future attack.  Our mandate is to 
 
       look back, to learn the vital lessons of 9/11, to 
 
       look forward, to make recommendations that leave 
 
       the United States and its people safer.

        <p>Our primary task is to answer one 
 
       essential question:  What can we do to prevent 
 
       another 9/11? 
 
        <p>Our mandate is breathtakingly broad. 
 
       After all, 9/11 was not simply a failure of a

       single person or department of government but 
 
       rather a systemic breakdown of our government's 
 
       defenses, our preparedness for catastrophic  
  
       terrorism and our understanding of a new world in 
 
       which threats develop an ocean away and strike us 
 
       with horrifying impact within our own borders. 
 
        <p>Thus, our mandate, as stated by the

       Congress and reaffirmed by the President, extends 
 
       to many areas of policy.  We are specifically 
 
       mandated to scrutinize intelligence, law 
 
       enforcement, diplomacy, immigration and border 
 
       controls, the financing of terrorism, commercial

       aviation, Congressional oversight of 
 
       counterterrorism efforts and other areas that we, 
 
       as a Commission, deem relevant. 
 
        <p>In all we do as a Commission, we will 
 
       strive to be independent, impartial, thorough, and

       nonpartisan.  The Commission will provide a factual 
 
       record of September 11, 2001, how events developed 
 
       and how our nation responded, from the first 
 
       responders at the Pentagon and the World Trade 
 
       Center, to the national leadership.

        <p>As the Chairman has already said, we will 
 
       also seek a better understanding of the enemy.  How 
 
       did al Qaeda emerge as a threat?  How did our  
  
       government's counterterrorism policy evolve?  What 
 
       have been our successes and our failures, and what 
 
       are the broad foreign-policy lessons of 9/11? 
 
        <p>I believe this Commission can and will

       make a significant and valuable impact worthy of 
 
       the attention and scrutiny of the American people 
 
       and policymakers. 
 
        <p>Much good work has already been done on 
 
       several issues before us.  The Congressional Joint

       Inquiry into the intelligence failures of 9/11 has 
 
       concluded its work and many other credible sources 
 
       have analyzed the issues that confront this 
 
       Commission, but the Joint Inquiry's focus was 
 
       limited to intelligence and other inquiries have

       lacked the breadth of our mandate. 
 
        <p>Now, some 18 months after that terrifying 
 
       day, we still have no comprehensive analysis of 
 
       9/11, no authoritative record of the many forces 
 
       that led to the attacks, no definitive narrative of

       the events of the day, and no set of 
 
       recommendations to address the wide assortment of 
 
       government policies and concerns related to the  
  
       attack. 
 
        <p>Today the Commission holds the first of 
 
       its public hearings.  The Commission is committed 
 
       to public hearings such as these for two reasons.

        <p>First, we are revisiting a seismic event 
 
       in American history and the lives of all Americans, 
 
       and we are working on issues of the utmost 
 
       importance to their safety and security.  Thus, we 
 
       are obligated to keep the American people as

       informed as we can of our work and our findings. 
 
        <p>Second, the American people are our 
 
       greatest resource.  The success of our inquiry 
 
       depends upon their intelligence, fortitude and good 
 
       will.  We will do our best to engage Americans of

       all walks of life to complete our work. 
 
        <p>Today we seek guidance from individuals 
 
       who can offer unique perspective and valuable 
 
       vision.  We will hear from the survivors of the 
 
       attack who can relate to us the awful experience of

       that day.  We will hear from the families of the 
 
       victims. 
 
        <p>Nobody suffered a greater loss on that  
  
       terrible day.  This loss both focuses and informs 
 
       our work.  The families offer a solemn reminder of 
 
       the gravity of our inquiry.  And through the 
 
       knowledge they have acquired in seeking answers to

       their many questions, the families also are a very 
 
       valuable resource. 
 
        <p>We will hear from the first responders who 
 
       were called to duty on 9/11.  Their brave and 
 
       extraordinarily capable example set this nation on

       a path towards recovery and their experience is 
 
       essential to our understanding of the events of the 
 
       day and our preparedness for future attacks. 
 
        <p>And we will hear from public officials who 
 
       coordinated this city and state's response.  They

       too were on the front lines in their 
 
       decision-making and marshalling of resources.  We 
 
       look forward to their wisdom on preventing, 
 
       preparing for, and responding to terrorist attacks. 
 
        <p>We step into a moving stream.  We operate

       in the context of the war on terror, which includes 
 
       operations abroad, some precautions already taken, 
 
       with more under consideration, and a government  
  
       that is reshaping itself to combat terrorism.  And 
 
       all the while, the threat of another attack looms. 
 
       The urgency of our work is apparent. 
 
        <p>Our staff, very ably led by Dr. Zelikow

       and Chris Kojm, represents some of the finest 
 
       expertise in the country.  We are establishing an 
 
       office in New York, as well as Washington.  We have 
 
       contacted all the various agencies we will be 
 
       working with in the coming months.

        <p>We have received assurances of cooperation 
 
       from the White House and from the Congress.  We 
 
       have set a course, an infrastructure, to meet the 
 
       charge of our mandate.  And we have begun to review 
 
       and build upon, not duplicate, the foundation of

       good work that has already been done by the Joint 
 
       Inquiry and many others. 
 
        <p>Our time is short and much work lies 
 
       ahead.  We have miles to go before we sleep.  At 
 
       the end of our work, it is my hope that we will

       have helped insure the security of the American homeland. 
 
       What greater or more urgent task could there be 
 
       than understanding this national tragedy and  
  
       working to strengthen the safety of the American 
 
       people? 
 
        <p>All want this Commission to succeed.  With 
 
       the help of our witnesses today and the many more

       to follow, we will produce a record that we trust 
 
       will stand the tests of time, a record that 
 
       heightens our understanding of the challenges ahead 
 
       and sets our course, as a nation, toward peace and 
 
       stability.

        <p>Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Congressman 
 
       Hamilton.  Now I'd like to introduce Commissioner 
 
       Fred Fielding. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER FIELDING:  Thank you, Mr.

       Chairman.  Good morning. 
 
        <p>At the outset, let me state how honored 
 
       and awed I am to be a member of this Commission and 
 
       to have the opportunity and privilege of working 
 
       with the Chairman, the Vice Chairman and my fellow

       Commissioners. 
 
        <p>It is a very onerous and huge task ahead 
 
       of us, and I can only pledge to provide all the  
  
       time, energy and skill I may possess to the 
 
       complete fulfillment of such important goals. 
 
        <p>For my part, I come to this task with no 
 
       preconceptions as to what we may find and no

       preconceived agenda as to what we may ultimately 
 
       recommend. 
 
        <p>I do, however, come with the anger and 
 
       sorrow and the despair shared by others over the acts 
 
       of 9/11 and over the loss we suffered to our

       national sense of domestic security and of the 
 
       losses, the senseless and vicious losses, of 
 
       friends and family and innocent people. 
 
        <p>I personally lost a dear friend who was 
 
       also the wife of a very close and longtime

       colleague and friend of mine.  I also personally 
 
       lost a delightful and most promising young law 
 
       partner, Karen Kincaide.  Her presence is so sorely 
 
       missed at the law firm. 
 
        <p>So I can't say that I am dispassionate and

       I can't say that I am totally objective about that 
 
       day, but we all suffered losses in various and 
 
       varied degrees.  And that collective loss must be  
  
       the motivation to be sure that everything is done 
 
       to prevent this from happening again. 
 
        <p>We must not rush to judgment, to be sure, 
 
       but we surely must make judgments.  As I see our

       mission, it is to carefully look to the past in 
 
       order that we can then realistically look to the 
 
       present and ultimately formulate credible 
 
       recommendations for the future. 
 
        <p>We must be fair and respectful and

       impartial in our work, but we must also be thorough 
 
       and surgical in our pursuit of these facts.  We 
 
       must follow facts wherever they lead.  There are no 
 
       sacred cows in this endeavor. 
 
        <p>We must be respectful to our institutions

       at every and all levels of government, but we must 
 
       also honor the mandate given to us to be as 
 
       thorough as possible in order to make the most 
 
       relevant findings and recommendations. 
 
        <p>I don't know where the facts will lead us

       when we seek to determine and to understand not 
 
       only what happened on that horrible day but also 
 
       how it could happen and how our government entities  
  
       were then dealing with the threat that gave rise to 
 
       it. 
 
        <p>And I don't know where the facts will lead 
 
       us as we probe the various institutions of our

       government, federal, state, executive, legislative, 
 
       to determine how each of these institutions was 
 
       poised and prepared to deal with other actions that 
 
       could have possibly occurred or, God forbid, 
 
       actions that can occur.

        <p>Further, we must probe to see if 
 
       institutional oversight, pressure, or actions 
 
       inhibited in any way the role or the degree of 
 
       vigilance that was necessary. 
 
        <p>To repeat the obvious, we don't know where

       these facts will lead us, but we will seek the 
 
       facts and have them lead us to conclusions which 
 
       then, and only then, can be the basis for realistic 
 
       recommendations that will hopefully mitigate the 
 
       possibility that we might again suffer the assaults

       of those who want to attack our way of life by 
 
       attacking and terrorizing our citizens and our 
 
       people in this country.  
  
        <p>A word of self-imposed caution is needed. 
 
       Probity, skill, intelligence, good judgment-they're 
 
       all necessary to accomplishing our 
 
       responsibility and should be the hallmarks of our

       conduct in our deliberations. But most important is 
 
       our task of instilling in the public confidence in 
 
       our objectivity. 
 
        <p>Critics will look to any indicia of 
 
       partisanship, divisiveness or disarray, and we must

       be vigilant to resist anything that leads to such a 
 
       conclusion.  History has shown that such actions, and 
 
       especially things such as leaks of sensitive 
 
       information prematurely, create the destruction of 
 
       a commission's work and its vitality and,

       therefore, its credibility and its validity. 
 
        <p>In today's world, I suspect no commission 
 
       will ever be able to satisfy everyone by its work, 
 
       but we must do everything we can to satisfy anyone 
 
       about the objective way we operate.  We have to

       have a shared commitment to an effort that is not 
 
       only thorough but is thoroughly fair and thoroughly 
 
       impartial and thoroughly nonpartisan.  
  
        <p>Those who attacked us on September 11th 
 
       wanted to usher in not a brave new world but a 
 
       cowardly one, a world in which terrorists who envy 
 
       our freedom and despise our values are willing to

       slaughter the innocent through any means at their 
 
       disposal. 
 
        <p>We have collectively learned this unwillingly, and at the cost of great 
 
       suffering, great shock and great sorrow. We now 
 
       have a challenge to prepare a report that will

       honor those who died on September 11th, their 
 
       families and friends who remain, and all the 
 
       Americans who are trusting us to help the President 
 
       and Congress to guard against any such other 
 
       attacks.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner. 
 
       Commissioner Richard Ben-Veniste. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Thank you, Mr. 
 
       Chairman, Mr. Co-Chairman, fellow Commissioners. 
 
       Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

        <p>Like countless Americans, I felt the 
 
       searing pain, shock and horror of the brutal 
 
       September 11th attacks upon my fellow citizens and  
  
       the symbols of American greatness and power. 
 
        <p>Less than two weeks before the September 
 
       11th attacks, I brought my family to visit the 
 
       World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty.  Like tens of thousands of others on September 
 
       11th, I realized, there but for the grace of God go 
 
       I. 
 
        <p>In the intervening time since the 
 
       September 11th attacks, we have learned a great

       deal about what happened on that day and the events 
 
       leading up to it.  In particular, we are grateful 
 
       for the work of the Joint Inquiry conducted by the 
 
       Senate and House Intelligence Committees. 
 
        <p>Congress has specifically instructed us to

       build upon the good work of the Joint Inquiry as we 
 
       proceed with our investigation and develop 
 
       recommendations for Congress and the President. 
 
        <p>Yet the Joint Inquiry's full report had 
 
       only just last week been made available to the

       members of this Commission who have their full 
 
       security clearances.  As of last week, most of the 
 
       Commissioners and most of the staff had not yet  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       received security clearances. 
 
        <p>I believe the scheduling of this hearing 
 
       has had a salutary effect on speeding up the 
 
       clearance process and I am gratified that the White

       House has now promised the funds necessary to carry 
 
       out our work. 
 
        <p>It is important that President Bush has 
 
       publicly supported this Commission and its goals. 
 
       The full cooperation of the relevant departments

       and agencies of the executive branch is essential 
 
       to the Commission's ability to carry out its 
 
       responsibilities.  And the result of such 
 
       cooperation will be a measure of our success. 
 
        <p>I am pleased that in recent weeks the

       Commission has made good progress in hiring an
 
       excellent staff, capable of carrying out the 
 
       ambitious agenda Congress has set out for us. 
 
        <p>From an historical perspective, it would 
 
       seem that the closest precedent to our assignment

       was the Roberts Commission, created by President 
 
       Roosevelt immediately after the Japanese attack on 
 
       Pearl Harbor.  The Roberts Commission failed to  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       address certain fundamental aspects of our 
 
       unpreparedness at Pearl Harbor and was criticized 
 
       by subsequent inquiries for serious omissions and 
 
       impaired conclusions.

        <p>We must be thorough and diligent in our 
 
       work in order to get it right.  We have been given 
 
       an historic opportunity to contribute to the public 
 
       good and to provide a record that will withstand 
 
       the test of time.

        <p>In fulfilling our responsibilities, it is 
 
       imperative that we assess our vulnerability to 
 
       terrorist attacks, and specifically, why we were 
 
       unprepared for the attacks of September 11, 2001. 
 
        <p>No department or agency in this

       administration, or any other, is exempted from our 
 
       careful review.  I do not, however, interpret our 
 
       investigative mandate to be an invitation to engage 
 
       in finger-pointing or to participate in the blame 
 
       game.  Rather, it is the essential precursor to a

       reasoned analysis of how changes and improvements 
 
       to our security apparatus can and should be made. 
 
        <p>I have had the privilege of meeting with  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       representatives of families of citizens who died in 
 
       the September 11th attacks.  The loss that they 
 
       have suffered is beyond measure, but their strength 
 
       and determination will continue to keep our nation

       and this Commission focused on answering the 
 
       questions posed by this tragedy. 
 
        <p>The personal involvement of surviving 
 
       family members was central to the 
 
       creation of this Commission, and I welcome their

       continued involvement as we go forward with our 
 
       work. 
 
        <p>Among the many challenges facing our 
 
       nation is the need for balance as we respond to the 
 
       real and ongoing threat of terrorist attacks.

       While our focus on protection of the homeland is 
 
       paramount, we must be ever mindful of the 
 
       collateral consequences of measures which may 
 
       threaten our vital personal and civil liberties. 
 
        <p>There is no question but that we must

       factor into the equation of proper balance the 
 
       capacity of our adversaries to exploit the 
 
       protections afforded by our Constitutional  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       guarantees of freedom of religion and due process 
 
       of law to advance their nefarious objectives. 
 
        <p>This balancing will be no easy task, but 
 
       it is imperative that we get it right.  And I hope

       this Commission will make recommendations that 
 
       reflect the importance of that balancing. 
 
        <p>In 1989, Justice Thurgood Marshall warned, 
 
       "History teaches us that grave threats to liberty 
 
       often come in times of urgency when Constitutional

       rights seem too extravagant to endure." 
 
        <p>Similarly, in 1995, Justice Sandra Day 
 
       O'Connor cautioned, "It can never be too often 
 
       stated that the greatest threats to our 
 
       Constitutional freedoms come in times of crisis."

        <p>If the acts of al Qaeda and other 
 
       terrorist organizations who mean us harm result in 
 
       a response that disproportionately curtails the 
 
       personal freedoms and civil liberties that define 
 
       our American way of life, then our enemies will

       have won a great victory without taking another 
 
       life. 
 
        <p>In conclusion, our Commission was created  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       to operate outside the permanent structure of the 
 
       three branches of government.  In addition to the 
 
       experience and judgment we can bring to bear to 
 
       this assignment, we can offer another critically

       important quality, our independence and 
 
       objectivity. 
 
        <p>We can and must consider carefully the 
 
       actions and roles of all three branches of 
 
       government as they operate to respond to the threat

       of further terrorist attacks.  We should offer 
 
       objective, neutral analysis, with no pre-set agenda 
 
       or allegiance to any agency or branch of government 
 
       or political party.  No lesser standard will 
 
       satisfy our nation's expectation of this

       Commission.  Thank you. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner. 
 
       Commissioner Slade Gorton. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  Mr. Chairman, the 
 
       members of this Commission are charged by the

       Congress of the United States to produce a thorough 
 
       and dispassionate history of the events, the 
 
       individuals, the organizations and the ideas that  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       led up to 9/11, together with the immediate 
 
       response of American institutions to that attack. 
 
        <p>I'm convinced at the same time that the 
 
       members of this Commission are charged by our

       consciences never to forget, never to have at any 
 
       place other than the forefront of our thoughts the 
 
       individuals whose lives were lost in this attack 
 
       and the far larger number of lives that were 
 
       devastated by that attack.

        <p>We are charged by the Congress of the 
 
       United States to analyze the structural and human 
 
       failures that resulted in the failure of this 
 
       nation's defenses, adequately or at all, to 
 
       anticipate and to prevent this attack.  We are told

       by the statute that created us to build on the work 
 
       of the Joint Congressional Inquiry, which has done 
 
       much good work but which recognized its own 
 
       incompleteness and inadequacy. 
 
        <p>I am convinced that one of the important

       aspects of this Commission's work is to examine 
 
       what has taken place in the 18 months since 9/11 to 
 
       prevent future such attacks.  Have we changed our  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       ways?  Is our intelligence better?  Are 
 
       preventative measures in effect?  Could we do a 
 
       better job in the future than they have in the 
 
       past?

        <p>Beyond that, however, I agree one hundred 
 
       percent with our Chairman's remarks that we are to 
 
       come up with recommendations as to future and 
 
       additional changes, changes in the structure of our 
 
       intelligence and law- enforcement agencies, perhaps

       more difficult, a recommendation of attitudinal 
 
       changes with respect to the way that individuals in 
 
       positions of authority respond and do their 
 
       job. 
 
        <p>And finally, I'd like to echo the remarks

       of my colleague, Mr. Ben-Veniste.  The object of 
 
       the attack of 9/11 was a free and open society 
 
       which those attackers hated and wished to destroy. 
 
        <p>An immense challenge before this 
 
       Commission and before the people of the United

       States is to determine ways in which that free and 
 
       open society can far better prevent future such 
 
       attacks, with a full balance and respect for the  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       values of that free society of individual liberty 
 
       and openness. 
 
        <p>This is in my view a huge task which I 
 
       approach, I trust, with due humility in the hope

       and the expectation that the 10 members of this 
 
       Commission will carry out this task not only 
 
       honorably but effectively and with a result that 
 
       causes the respect and the acceptance of the 
 
       American people.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner. 
 
       Commissioner Jamie Gorelick. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  Good morning.  Thank you, Tom Kean and 
 
       Lee Hamilton, for your leadership of this

       Commission. 
 
        <p>The first obligation of government is to 
 
       protect its people.  And clearly our government 
 
       failed to do that on September 11th.  As a country, 
 
       we have since declared war on terrorism, but as

       those schooled in the art of war know, history is 
 
       the best teacher. 
 
        <p>And it is for that reason that our  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       military, since the Revolutionary War when George 
 
       Washington appointed Baron von Steuben to assess 
 
       how our newly formed Army could do better, our 
 
       military has consistently demanded, in meticulous

       detail, after-action reports of every military 
 
       event so that in the future our actions could be 
 
       informed by both our successes and our failures. 
 
        <p>That principle has also been adopted in 
 
       our civilian agencies by act of Congress.  We have

       inspectors general in every civilian agency.  And they 
 
       know, as do their military counterparts, that our 
 
       consistent history is a prompt, effective and, most 
 
       importantly, unflinching review of our failures, 
 
       even, even when it is hard to accept the truth.

        <p>Now there may not be perfect historical 
 
       analogies to what we undertake here today, but we 
 
       have a consistent history of prompt, effective and 
 
       unflinching reviews.  We have already failed to 
 
       undertake this review promptly.

        <p>The statute establishing this Commission 
 
       was not passed until nearly a year and a half after 
 
       September 11, 2001.  And we have, to be sure,  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       encountered some obstacles in getting this inquiry 
 
       off the ground. But we are now underway, and 
 
       underway forcefully. 
 
        <p>Whatever difficulties we encounter, I

       will dedicate myself, as I know my fellow 
 
       colleagues will do also, to overcoming them because 
 
       we have to.  We must get this right.  If we don't, 
 
       we will fail to learn from our mistakes. 
 
        <p>I am a native of New York.  I am a

       long-time Washingtonian.  The two communities that 
 
       I call mine, where my children and my family and 
 
       friends want and need to feel safe, are the ones 
 
       that feel our vulnerability the most.  So I come to 

 
       this task with a great sense of urgency, which is

       underscored by my meetings and my communications 
 
       with the representatives of the families of the 
 
       victims. 
 
        <p>In my career I have dedicated myself to a 
 
       strong national defense, to a safe and secure

       domestic life, and to the protection of our 
 
       precious liberties.  And I pledge to those here and 
 
       to those who have placed their fate in this  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       Commission's work that I will bring every ounce of 
 
       my energy and each of those perspectives to bear as 
 
       we undertake the solemn obligations of this 
 
       Commission's work.  Thank you.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner John Lehman. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN:  Thank you, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  Good morning.  In my career I have 
 
       served in the Naval Forces, the National Security 
 
       Council Staff, the State Department, as a diplomat,

       and as Secretary of the Navy. 
 
        <p>In that last tour on my watch, I lost 241 
 
       Marines and sailors to a state-sponsored terrorist 
 
       attack in Beirut.  Most of those perpetrators today 
 
       are still recruiting and training terrorists.  Both

       of those states that sponsored that attack are 
 
       still harboring and sponsoring terrorism.  And it 
 
       has been a continuing dedication on my part to see 
 
       that the lessons that should be drawn from that 
 
       experience are applied in government.

        <p>So far, that has not been terribly 
 
       successful. But my experience in government has 
 
       certainly taught me one great lesson, that the  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       genius of our system is that we do learn the 
 
       lessons of history.  It takes us more time perhaps 
 
       in our democratic methods than we would prefer, but 
 
       I am a believer in the way our system, haltingly

       but inevitably, learns the lessons of history so that 
 
       they are not repeated. 
 
        <p>I think that our Commission is the ideal 
 
       vehicle, the ideal catalyst, to see that the 
 
       lessons of 9/11 are promptly applied, to see that

       they are not repeated as, unfortunately, our 
 
       experience in Beirut has been repeated numerous 
 
       times in the intervening decade. 
 
        <p>And so I think you will see a very 
 
       intense, a very active process in pursuing this

       investigation, in seeing that the recommendations 
 
       of previous commissions, the longstanding and 
 
       understood shortcomings in the organization of our 
 
       government that have been identified by a number of 
 
       previous commissions but never acted on, are going

       to be focused on and the new nature of the spread 
 
       of international terrorism is understood and 
 
       applied in concrete recommendations and proposals  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       that will issue from this Commission. 
 
        <p>And I'm confident that the Executive 
 
       Branch in Congress, with the catalyst of this 
 
       Commission's work, will see that those proposals

       are implemented and we indeed will learn the 
 
       lessons of history and not repeat them.  Thank you. 
 
				<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Commissioner 
 
       Lehman.  We are going to interrupt the statements 
 
       from the Commissioners because Governor Pataki has

       arrived.  Governor, we welcome you.  Thank you 
 
       very much for coming. 
 
        <p>GOVERNOR PATAKI:  Good morning, Chairman 
 
       Kean, Vice Chairman Hamilton, and members of the 
 
       Commission.  It's a privilege to be here before you

       this morning on behalf of the 19 million citizens of New 
 
       York State.  I have formal comments that you have 
 
       before you, and you're welcome to make them a part 
 
       of the record, but I would just like to reflect a 
 
       little bit on my thoughts of September 11th.

        <p>Thank you for your efforts to make sure 
 
       that every step is taken to make sure that America 
 
       is prepared and proactive to try to make sure it  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       doesn't happen again and if there are additional 
 
       attacks against anyone anywhere in America, we're 
 
       prepared to respond appropriately. 
 
        <p>Of course, when I think of September 11th,

       the first overwhelming feeling I have is a sense of 
 
       loss, a sense of loss of not just the hundreds of 
 
       brave firefighters and police officers and Port 
 
       Authority police officers, but also of the 
 
       thousands of civilians, just ordinary people who

       went to work that morning with their normal dreams 
 
       for a good day and a better future for themselves 
 
       and their families. 
 
        <p>You can't help but have a tremendous 
 
       sense of loss when you reflect on the individuals,

       friends that I know and so many in New York whom we 
 
       lost on that morning. But the second thought I have 
 
       is one of overwhelming pride and a tremendous sense 
 
       of the courage of those who faced unspeakable 
 
       tragedy with such incredible willingness to

       sacrifice.  And because of that courage, because of 
 
       that willingness to sacrifice, the efforts of the 
 
       terrorists on September 11th failed.  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
        <p>Now certainly they succeeded in bringing 
 
       down two towers, two symbols of American strength 
 
       and in the process killing thousands of innocent 
 
       people in a way that has broken our hearts. But

       they didn't want to break our hearts, they wanted 
 
       to break our spirit.  They didn't want to bring 
 
       down towers, they wanted to bring down our 
 
       confidence and our freedom and our way of life. 
 
        <p>And because of the way that ordinary New

       Yorkers responded with extraordinary courage, 
 
       instead of seeing us divided and frightened, we saw 
 
       us unified and inspired. 
 
        <p>I can recall the morning of September 
 
       11th walking the streets of lower Manhattan and

       seeing in front of St. Luke's Hospital doctors and 
 
       nurses lined up with gurneys.  Maybe they were 
 
       frightened because no one knew what might happen 
 
       next, but their fear was overcome by their courage 
 
       and their willingness to stand out in the streets

       of lower Manhattan in the hopes that injured people 
 
       would be brought that they could treat. 
 
        <p>I walked the streets of lower  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       Manhattan.  I will never forget turning a 
 
       corner and seeing more than a block of ordinary New 
 
       Yorkers lining the street.  And they weren't lining 
 
       the street to catch the subway uptown or to catch a

       bus out of town.  They were lined up, in the midst 
 
       of this fear and uncertainty, to give blood in the 
 
       hopes that somehow they could help New Yorkers 
 
       overcome this tragedy. 
 
        <p>All of the superficial differences that on

       the morning of September 11th seemed so important, 
 
       whether it was race or religion or politics or 
 
       economic position, disappeared in the sense of 
 
       unity and the sense that we had been attacked and 
 
       we were going to get through this together.

        <p>And it was with extraordinary pride that I 
 
       walked those streets of lower Manhattan and saw 
 
       how yes, our firefighters and our police officers 
 
       and our emergency-service workers charged into 
 
       those towers with no regard for their own lives to

       save others, but also with the pride of the 
 
       ordinary New Yorkers, who 
 
       responded with such courage.  And since that day  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       that sense of unity and that sense of courage is 
 
       something I believe still is very strong here in 
 
       New York. 
 
        <p>We are going to hear from family

       members who lost their loved ones on September 
 
       11th.  Their courage, their strength, a year and a 
 
       half later, is something that still inspires me 
 
       and, I believe, still inspires Americans. 
 
        <p>And we are going to rebuild Ground Zero in

       a way that makes it a symbol of the resurgence of 
 
       New York and the confidence Americans have in our 
 
       freedom, but at the same time, we're going to be 
 
       respectful and we're going to never forget that 
 
       almost 3,000 heroes were lost on that day.  And we

       are going to make sure we have a memorial that is 
 
       appropriate for all time and a symbol of courage 
 
       and a symbol of the sacrifice those heroes made on 
 
       that day. 
 
        <p>As we watch the nightly news and now see

       the war against terror being fought in the Middle 
 
       East, a lot of people say that, well, perhaps 
 
       almost two weeks ago the first shots of that war  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       were fired.  In my view, the first shots of that 
 
       war were fired September 11, 2001, right here in 
 
       New York City. 
 
        <p>In my view, the heroes and the martyrs

       of September 11th were the first casualties in that 
 
       war, a war we're going to win.  And when we win 
 
       that war, New York and America and the world will 
 
       be a safer place because of that. 
 
        <p>Last week I had the privilege of being in

       Fort Drum, which is a military base in upstate New 
 
       York, when the 77th Regional Command U.S. Army Reserve 
 
       Unit was mobilized and on their way to the Middle 
 
       East.  I had a chance to talk to them and talk 
 
       to their commanding general.

        <p>The 77th has suffered six fatalities in 
 
       this war.  They didn't suffer them in the Middle 
 
       East. They suffered them on September 11th when 
 
       firefighters, and a lawyer, one of them a very 
 
       close friend of mine, died responding to that

       attack.  And they are going over there with a 
 
       tremendous sense of pride and a tremendous sense of 
 
       mission knowing that their first casualties will  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       not occur in Iraq. They occurred on the streets of 
 
       New York. 
 
        <p>So as we go forward, I can't help but 
 
       think of the President's comments when he addressed

       the people of America on the eve of the war.  And 
 
       the President said, one of the points that has 
 
       stuck with me and will always stick with me, is that 
 
       this war against terror should be fought by our 
 
       soldiers and our sailors and our Marines and our

       Air Force and not by our firefighters and police 
 
       officers.  That to me is an important lesson of 
 
       September 11th. 
 
        <p>I am sure this Commission, as it goes about 
 
       its hearings and listens to so many people, will

       learn a lot of other lessons of September 11th.  I 
 
       thank you for your service.  I thank you for your 
 
       commitment and willingness to put in the time and 
 
       the effort to try to do everything we can to 
 
       protect the people of New York and to protect the

       people of America. 
 
        <p>New York State government and I'm sure the 
 
       people of New York stand ready to cooperate in any  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       way we possibly can to help you on this important 
 
       mission.  Again, let me just say that when you 
 
       think of September 11th, yes, we will never forget 
 
       the sadness and the heroes, but let's never forget

       the courage and the strength that ordinary New 
 
       Yorkers showed under extraordinary circumstances. 
 
       Thank you and God bless you.  Thank you, Chairman. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Governor. 
 
       Thank you very much.  I'd like to introduce

       Commissioner Tim Roemer. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  I'd just ask permission to have my 
 
       entire statement entered into the record so I can be 
 
       a little bit briefer than the whole statement.

        <p>I am honored to serve with you, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  You bring such a good bipartisan 
 
       reputation to this Commission.  I am honored to 
 
       serve with the Vice Chair, Mr. Hamilton, with whom I 
 
       served in Congress.  And I'm honored to be

       here with the families that could have stepped away 
 
       in their grief and their sorrow and instead 
 
       participated in a process that helped bring us here  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       today with the Commission. 
 
        <p>We are here today because we love 
 
       democracy.  And in democracy, sometimes it is not 
 
       easy to get at the facts, to ask the tough

       questions, to make people feel uncomfortable, to 
 
       move paradigms and models from old ways into new 
 
       ways, to take on the threat of al Qaeda, who wants 
 
       to kill hundreds if not thousands of people and do 
 
       it anyplace in the world, including in the United

       States of America. 
 
        <p>We are here to get at the facts.  And 
 
       getting at the facts won't kill us, but not getting 
 
       at those facts might.  We need to make sure that we 
 
       follow the clues and the evidence wherever they will

       lead. 
 
        <p>Walter Lippman, a gifted and prolific 
 
       writer, reminded us that "A central function of 
 
       democracy is to allow a free people to drag 
 
       realities out into the sunlight and demand a full

       accounting from those who were permitted to hold 
 
       power." 
 
        <p>As our Declaration of Independence  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       proclaims, those holding power, "Deriving their 
 
       powers from the consent of the governed" should be 
 
       accountable to their citizens.  That's what we are 
 
       going to do on this Commission.

        <p>New York City is the appropriate place to 
 
       begin this great task.  Even before September 11th, 
 
       at 12:18, on February 26, 1993, a bomb exploded in 
 
       the World Trade Center, killing six people, 
 
       injuring 1,000 people, and causing $510 million in

       damage.  On June 24, 1993, the FBI arrested eight 
 
       individuals for plotting to bomb a number of New 
 
       York City landmarks. 
 
        <p>Why did it take our bureaucracies, our 
 
       intelligence community and our politicians so long

       to react to targets and clues and evidence that had 
 
       been building and building and building over time? 
 
        <p>A distinguished historian, Roberta 
 
       Wohlstetter, wrote a superb book on Pearl Harbor. 
 
       And the forward by Thomas Schelling is even more

       superb, and I quote, "It would be reassuring to 
 
       believe that Pearl Harbor was just a colossal and 
 
       extraordinary blunder.  In fact, blunder is too  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       specific.  It was just a dramatic failure of a 
 
       remarkably well-informed government to call the 
 
       next enemy move in a Cold War crisis." 
 
        <p>Today it might be some of the same words,

       a "well-intentioned but well-informed government to 
 
       call the next enemy move."  It was not a Cold War 
 
       crisis and it wasn't the Japanese, but it was al 
 
       Qaeda and it was an enemy that had declared war on 
 
       the United States in 1998.

        <p>We need our agencies, our bureaucracies, 
 
       our people to react with a sense of urgency, the 
 
       urgency that we have in the war right now in the 
 
       Middle East.  We should have had this sense of 
 
       urgency years ago.

        <p>When I have criticisms that maybe our 
 
       Commission got off to a slow start, when I have 
 
       criticisms of the White House, even reluctantly, in 
 
       finally coming forward with some of the funding, $9 
 
       million instead of $11 million, through a new

       account instead of through a supplemental 
 
       appropriation that should have gone through the 
 
       United States Congress, it is not a personal  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       criticism, it is not even a political criticism. 
 
       It is because of the urgency that I feel that al 
 
       Qaeda is coming after us again and again, and soon. 
 
        <p>It is the sense of urgency that the

       country should feel, not only because of 9/11, but 
 
       because of the impending and direct threat of 
 
       terrorists that have changed their modus operandi 
 
       from we "will cause damage and terror but not kill 
 
       lots of people" to "we will terrify people and kill

       thousands of them to get their attention." 
 
        <p>Let me conclude by saying, we should have 
 
       three objectives: a full accountability in sunlight 
 
       that this Commission asks the tough questions of 
 
       our government, asks the tough questions.

        <p>In an unclassified finding of the Joint 
 
       Inquiry that I served on, we asked, were other 
 
       governments involved in funding the terrorists.  We 
 
       need to get to the bottom of those questions. 
 
        <p>Secondly, the sense of urgency in this

       bond of the American people that we need to 
 
       establish.  Many commissions have made countless 
 
       recommendations that sit on dusty shelves, going  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       nowhere. 
 
        <p>These recommendations, with this sense of 
 
       urgency and bond with the American people, need to 
 
       find their way to the President's desk and be

       signed into law so that we make this country a 
 
       safer place and that they are not ignored at the end 
 
       of the day. 
 
        <p>We bury today not just someone from Hell's 
 
       Kitchen or someone New Yorkers are proud of but

       somebody that all America is proud of and somebody 
 
       I served with in the United States Congress, former 
 
       Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan.  He gives us all 
 
       the sense of urgency that we should have in our 
 
       great work ahead.

        <p>He said in a Harvard commencement ceremony 
 
       last year, and I quote, "The terrorist attacks on 
 
       the United States of last September 11th were not 
 
       nuclear, but they will be." 
 
        <p>That is the sense of threat, of urgency,

       of love for democracy and accountability of our 
 
       government that I hope this Commission will bring 
 
       forward in a non-partisan, bipartisan way and get  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       to the bottom of why this happened and how we make 
 
       the country a safer place for every single American 
 
       in this great country that we love so much.  Thank 
 
       you.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Jim Thompson. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER THOMPSON:  Mr. Chairman, 
 
       thank you.  I too am honored to serve as a member 
 
       of this Commission and to serve with extraordinary 
 
       people who have each in their own way contributed

       much to this nation. 
 
        <p>I have always believed, as Commissioner 
 
       Gorelick has already noted, that the first 
 
       obligation of government, all governments, is to 
 
       protect the lives and property of its citizens.

        <p>Here is the American bargain.  Each of us, 
 
       as individual citizens, take a portion of our 
 
       liberties and our lives and pass them to those whom 
 
       we elect or appoint as our guardians.  And their 
 
       task is to hold our liberties and our lives in

       their hands, secure.  That is an appropriate 
 
       bargain. 
 
        <p>But on September 11th, that bargain was  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       not kept.  Our government, all governments, somehow 
 
       failed in their duty that day.  We need to know 
 
       why.  No one who was not there nor bound by family 
 
       or emotional ties to the victims can completely

       understand the horror and still present shock of 
 
       that day.  It is incomprehensible.  But as 
 
       Americans, we are all victims of September 11th and 
 
       the whole nation must be satisfied when we finish 
 
       our work.

        <p>I remember watching the television news as 
 
       I prepared to go to work that morning and saw the 
 
       first plane crash into the World Trade Tower.  And 
 
       my assumption was that this was a grievous, 
 
       horrible accident.  By the time I reached the

       street and learned of the second plane crashing 
 
       into the second tower, the whole world knew it was 
 
       no accident. 
 
        <p>A number of young people worked with me at 
 
       our law firm.  And by midmorning, when we made our

       decision to close our offices and send our people 
 
       home, they asked if they could go home with me. 
 
       Nobody wanted to be alone on September 11th.  One  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       young man and his wife and baby came to my house 
 
       because I live on the seventh floor.  They live in 
 
       another building on the 12th floor.  They felt 
 
       safer with me, closer to the ground.

        <p>Several months later, when I was in New 
 
       York, I stopped at Ground Zero, got out of my car, 
 
       ran to the fence before the policeman could shoo me 
 
       away, peered through the barricade and looked at 
 
       that vast empty space.  Space had replaced people

       and instruments of commerce.  Others will fill that 
 
       space one day with buildings and memorials and 
 
       human life will flourish again there. 
 
        <p>Our task is, to borrow a phrase, without 
 
       fear or favor to fill that space with the facts,

       with the truth, and with answered questions.  Thank 
 
       you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Max Cleland. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND:  Thank you very 
 
       much, Mr. Chairman.

        <p>I am deeply moved by the emotion and the 
 
       dedication and the commitment of these fine 
 
       Americans on this panel and the wonderful Americans  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       in the audience toward finding out what happened, 
 
       why and making sure it never happens again.  So I'm 
 
       honored to be among these wonderful people today. 
 
        <p>Let me just say that 18 months ago, this

       city and our country suffered an attack like none 
 
       we had ever experienced before.  On that day we 
 
       lost more than the thousands of innocent men and 
 
       women and children who perished or were grievously 
 
       injured.  We lost more than the two great towers

       that fell, we lost our sense of safety and 
 
       invulnerability. 
 
        <p>Almost without question, we could and 
 
       should have been better prepared, we know that, to 
 
       protect our homeland against the terrorist assault.

       As in the final report of the Joint Congressional 
 
       Intelligence Committee Inquiry into the 9/11 
 
       attacks found, "Prior to September the 11th, the 
 
       intelligence community was neither well organized 
 
       nor equipped and did not adequately adapt to meet

       the challenge posed by global terrorists focused on 
 
       targets within the domestic United States.  These 
 
       problems greatly exacerbated the nation's  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       vulnerability to an increasingly dangerous and 
 
       immediate international terrorist threat inside the 
 
       United States." 
 
        <p>Because of this I believe the work of this

       Commission will not only affirm those intelligence 
 
       deficiencies but will find corresponding lapses in 
 
       border control, aviation security, and a host of 
 
       other fields. 
 
        <p>As a member of the 107th Congress of the

       Senate Committee on Armed Services and Commerce and 
 
       Governmental Affairs, I participated in literally 
 
       dozens of hearings which thoroughly delved within 
 
       our unpreparedness for the terrorist threat.  And I 
 
       was pleased in some small way to play a role in the

       development of the Department of Aviation and 
 
       Transportation Security Act of 2001, Maritime 
 
       Transportation and Security Act of 2001, and the 
 
       Homeland Security Act of 2002. 
 
        <p>But I believe that this investigation will

       show that, as true of executive agencies, the Congress 
 
       should have been and could have been better 
 
       prepared and done better.  It's not hard to see  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       parallels between September 11th, 2001 and 
 
       December 7, 1941.  I am particularly sensitive to 
 
       such comparisons because my father was stationed in 
 
       Pearl Harbor after the attack.  That attack had a

       profound effect on this country and on my family 
 
       personally. 
 
        <p>As a CIA-funded study of the agency's 
 
       history reported, the intelligence community we had 
 
       in place in 2001 was in many respects a product of

       the 1941 debacle, after which our national leaders 
 
       had concluded "that the surprise attack could have 
 
       been blunted if the various commanders and 
 
       departments had coordinated their actions and 
 
       shared their intelligence."

        <p>And boy, does that have a familiar ring. 
 
       That was right after 1941.  These sobering 
 
       assessments led to the adoption of the National 
 
       Security Act of 1947 which "attempted to implement 
 
       the principles of unity of command and unity of

       intelligence." 
 
        <p>In many ways that is what now, over 50 
 
       years later, we have been trying to do in the wake  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       of the 2001 disaster. But there are some important 
 
       differences between Pearl Harbor and 9/11 which 
 
       also must be kept in mind as this Commission and 
 
       the country chart our course on where we go from

       here.  As shattering a blow as December 7, 
 
       1941, it was a military strike, aimed at military 
 
       targets, ordered by the Imperial Government of 
 
       Japan and coming at the end of a long period of 
 
       tensions between the two governments.

        <p>September the 11th, 2001 was a terrorist 
 
       strike, aimed primarily at civilian targets, in 
 
       which the perpetrators were not acting for a nation 
 
       but for a terrorist network.  It's true that previous 
 
       attacks, as has been stated, by al Qaeda, including

       the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the 
 
       thwarted 1995 Bojinka plot in the Philippines, the 
 
       1990 embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania, and 
 
       the 2000 attack on the USS Cole should have 
 
       produced, and amongst some governmental officials

       did produce, a heightened sense of urgency and 
 
       attention to the new terrorist threat. 
 
        <p>But these attacks were all either far away  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       or of limited success or both.  They were not 
 
       enough to shake us out of our collective sense of 
 
       invulnerability which was borne of the security 
 
       long provided us by two great oceans and friendly

       neighbors for almost 200 years, since the war of 
 
       1812, without significant hostile foreign assaults 
 
       on the continental United States, and by our more 
 
       recent victory in the Cold War which eliminated the 
 
       Soviet threat.

        <p>Thus, the pre-9/11 attacks by al Qaeda 
 
       were not sufficient to make intelligence 
 
       bureaucracy shed their turf-consciousness and 
 
       their Cold War mentalities or our border-control 
 
       agencies to overcome inertia and budget shortfalls

       or the airlines and airports to tighten security, 
 
       even if it meant some added inconvenience to the 
 
       traveling public or the executive or legislative 
 
       branches to prioritize homeland security above other 
 
       spending programs.

        <p>None of these things happened before 9/11.
 
       But all of them have occurred to at least some 
 
       degree since then.  It could and no doubt should  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       have been different. If it had been different, 
 
       some or all those who perished on that day would 
 
       still be with us.  Now at the very least, we do 
 
       want to, for those victims and their families, make

       sure we're never again so ill prepared to defend 
 
       our homeland. 
 
        <p>But I say that those families and the 
 
       sacrifices of their loved ones, that they have not 
 
       have died in vain.  The victims themselves have

       galvanized the public, the private sector and the 
 
       government into action in a way which unfortunately 
 
       would not likely have occurred otherwise. 
 
        <p>And the surviving families members, many 
 
       of them who are with us today, through your

       dedication, your persistence, and your untiring 
 
       efforts, more than any other force, are responsible 
 
       for this Commission, and thus have given us the 
 
       grave responsibility and opportunity to help 
 
       produce a more secure country for all of us as

       Americans. 
 
        <p>However, if a false sense of 
 
       invulnerability and security was our downfall on  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       September the 11th, in many ways the current 
 
       danger, in my opinion that we will succumb to 
 
       what FDR called "fear itself." Continuing the 
 
       quote, "nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror,

       which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat 
 
       into advance." 
 
        <p>That was from 1933.  President Roosevelt 
 
       was speaking, of course, of the fear of economic 
 
       insecurity wrought by the great global depression

       of the '30s, but I believe his words still ring 
 
       true these 70 years later as we confront "nameless, 
 
       unreasoning, unjustified fear," of the global 
 
       terrorism of the 21st century. 
 
        <p>We must never again lapse into complacency

       about homeland security when the march of 
 
       technology has made physical boundaries and 
 
       international borders more and more surmountable 
 
       and has expanded the destructive power of weapons 
 
       to the point that small groups, or even

       individuals, can now inflict a degree of death and 
 
       destruction heretofore reserved to great armies. 
 
        <p>But if we are to prevail in this struggle,  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       we must not give in to the terror of terrorism 
 
       which is, after all, at once both the major weapon 
 
       and the chief objective of al Qaeda and its allies. 
 
        <p>The war against terrorism bears many

       similarities to the Cold War against 
 
       communism, a war in which President Kennedy called 
 
       on our country to "bear the burden of a long 
 
       twilight struggle, year in and year out, rejoicing 
 
       in hope, patient in tribulation, in our struggle

       against the common enemies of man, tyranny, 
 
       disease and war itself." 
 
        <p>That is our challenge.  We walk in that 
 
       great challenge in the last half of the 20th 
 
       century with firmness and strength but also with

       the patience and hope that JFK spoke of.  We need a 
 
       similar combination to vanquish the new enemy. 
 
        <p>In my judgment, that is the task to which 
 
       this Commission must dedicate itself, to assist the 
 
       country in being neither complacent nor fearful in

       maintaining a sense of safety but not false 
 
       invulnerability. 
 
        <p>In closing, I'd just like to say a word of  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       prayer and thanks to the great men and women of the 
 
       Armed Forces of our country who, even as we meet 
 
       here today, stand in harm's way, far from home. 
 
       God be with them and bless them and their families.

       Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much, 
 
       Commissioner.  I'd now like to introduce and 
 
       welcome Mayor Michael Bloomberg of the City of New 
 
       York.

        <p>AUDIENCE MEMBER:  How about jobs and not 
 
       rhetoric?  How about saving human rights in this 
 
       country? 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Governor, want me to 
 
       start?

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Yes, please.  I introduced 
 
       you before.  I will welcome you. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Thank you very much.  If 
 
       I need the introduction, I'm in big trouble here in 
 
       this city.

        <p>Governor, members of the Commission, 
 
       welcome to New York City.  We hope you spend a lot 
 
       of money and generate some sales-tax revenues while  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       you're here.  We could use you. 
 
        <p>Your Commission has a broad mandate, that 
 
       is, to look at the reasons why 9/11 happened, to 
 
       consider the steps the federal government should

       take to make sure attacks like that don't occur 
 
       again and to propose measures that would be taken 
 
       now to prepare us to respond to future terrorist 
 
       incidents. 
 
        <p>Much of your work will focus on such

       important questions as how did terrorists get into 
 
       this country, what should we do to make our borders 
 
       safe, how were the terrorists allowed to learn to 
 
       fly airplanes in our own country, how on earth 
 
       could they get by airport security with the

       obviously unenforced and ineffective federal 
 
       regulations, and how can we stop other acts of 
 
       terrorism in the future.  These are the issues for 
 
       your Commission. 
 
        <p>I want to focus on different but also

       important issues.  I will describe our city 
 
       government's reaction to the attacks to the World 
 
       Trade Center, including our emergency response that  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       day, our recovery effort in the days and months 
 
       immediately afterward, and what we have done since 
 
       in the areas of counterterrorism and preparedness. 
 
        <p>Simply put, the terrorist attack on 9/11

       was one of the darkest days in New York's history. 
 
       It took the lives of 2,700-plus of our loved ones, 
 
       friends and colleagues, including more than 360 
 
       valiant city firefighters, police officers and 
 
       emergency workers.

        <p>It revealed our vulnerability to murderous 
 
       plots formulated half a world away.  It shattered 
 
       forever any illusions that our vast ocean 
 
       boundaries can protect us. But out of the 
 
       devastation came one of our finest hours, defined

       by the heroism of those who rushed into the 
 
       buildings to save others, the selflessness of New 
 
       Yorkers who supported the recovery through acts as 
 
       simple as lining up on West Street to say thank you 
 
       to our emergency workers and the resilience of New

       Yorkers who refused to stop living their lives in 
 
       the difficult days, weeks and months that followed 
 
       the attack.  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
        <p>New York City has learned, and continues 
 
       to learn, the lessons of 9/11.  Today I want to 
 
       underscore the need for an effective and ongoing 
 
       counterterrorism partnership with the federal

       government. 
 
        <p>Police Commissioner Ray Kelly and Fire 
 
       Commissioner Nick Scoppetta are with me today. 
 
       They will make statements following my testimony, 
 
       if you so desire, and are prepared to answer your

       questions. 
 
        <p>As you know, I was not the mayor on 9/11. 
 
       Our administration took office the following 
 
       January. But the efforts of 9/11 have been a major 
 
       focus of our administration over the last 15

       months.  We have examined the city's response to 
 
       9/11 thoroughly, and I can tell you that it was 
 
       swift, massive, heroic and extraordinarily 
 
       effective. 
 
        <p>Within 10 minutes of the first attack at

       8:46 a.m., 50 percent of the Police Department's 
 
       Special Operation Units were deployed and were 
 
       either at or on their way to the World Trade  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       Center.  By 9:00 a.m., before the second plane even 
 
       hit, both the Fire Department and our Emergency 
 
       Medical Service had command posts on the scene 
 
       directing rescue operations.  By 9:10 a.m., less

       than half an hour after the first tower was struck, 
 
       100 percent of the Fire Department's rescue and 
 
       high-rise units had been ordered into action. 
 
        <p>Police officers immediately secured the 
 
       perimeter around the World Trade Center and police

       emergency-service units entered the towers to 
 
       assist in evacuations.  Department of Health 
 
       officials started considering public-health effects 
 
       and began contacting area hospitals to establish 
 
       procedures for accepting the heavy influx of

       injured people that was anticipated. 
 
        <p>Sadly, those numbers did not materialize. 
 
       I say sadly because instead of the influx of 
 
       injured New Yorkers, we experienced massive 
 
       fatalities.

        <p>The professionalism of our rescue efforts 
 
       and the bravery of those who carried them out is 
 
       encapsulated in one statistic, some 25,000 people  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       were safely evacuated from the World Trade Center 
 
       that morning, the most successful urban emergency 
 
       evacuation in modern history. 
 
        <p>After the towers collapsed, the city's

       response was just as exemplary.  Department of 
 
       Sanitation officials at the recently closed Fresh 
 
       Kills Landfill in Staten Island, knowing they had 
 
       heavy lifting and hauling equipment at hand, 
 
       immediately made plans to send that equipment into

       Manhattan. 
 
        <p>The offices of the city's Department of 
 
       Design and Construction, or DDC, acted with equal 
 
       dispatch, obtaining equipment from some of the 
 
       city's major construction firms.  Despite the fact

       that its command center was destroyed in the 
 
       attack, the city's Office of Emergency Management, 
 
       OEM, established a temporary command post.  By the 
 
       evening of September 11th, lights lit up the entire 
 
       site while the search for survivors went on.

        <p>Firefighters worked day and night to 
 
       extinguish fires that burned beneath the rubble for 
 
       months.  The Department of Design and Construction,  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       along with the Fire Department and the Office of 
 
       Emergency Management, spearheaded interagency 
 
       coordination among city agencies and with federal 
 
       and state agencies and private organizations.

        <p>In the first five days alone, almost 3,000 
 
       truckloads of debris were removed.  Over the next 
 
       seven months, an average of more than 7,000 tons of 
 
       debris, per day, was taken from the site.  Barging 
 
       operations were established at Hudson River Piers

       25 and 26 to transport debris from Manhattan to the 
 
       Fresh Kills Landfill, which was reopened to 
 
       accommodate the enormous tonnage of material. 
 
        <p>The recovery proceeded in a manner that 
 
       made the search for human remains the highest

       priority.  Work came to a halt any time it appeared 
 
       such a discovery might be made.  To date, the 
 
       remains of 1,481 victims of that attack have been 
 
       identified by the Office of the Chief Medical 
 
       Examiner, an office that has led the nation in its

       use of state-of-the-art DNA identification 
 
       technology. 
 
        <p>The clearing of the site, which was  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       initially expected to take years, instead took 
 
       eight months.  The work was not only accomplished 
 
       much faster than expected but done under budget, 
 
       without a single loss of life, with an injury rate

       far less than at an ordinary construction site, 
 
       despite the unprecedented conditions in which the 
 
       work was done. 
 
        <p>Would you like me to wait while we finish? 
 
       I'd be happy to wait until we catch up, soon as we

       finish briefing, then we can continue.  It's quite 
 
       all right.  I have plenty of time, so I'd be happy 
 
       to do it. 
 
        <p>In retrospect, there is little this city 
 
       could have done on 9/11 to avoid the tremendous

       loss of life that occurred so quickly after the 
 
       attacks.  The failure of airport security doomed 
 
       the 2,700 poor souls who are no longer with us. 
 
       However, since then we have taken it upon ourselves 
 
       to learn everything possible from this tragedy.

        <p>Shortly after 9/11, the consulting firm of 
 
       McKinsey & Company agreed to study, on a pro bono 
 
       basis, the response of the Police and Fire  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       Departments to the attack on the World Trade Center 
 
       and to make recommendations for the future. 
 
        <p>These extremely valuable consultant 
 
       studies, which are available on the Web,

       complemented studies already underway in both these 
 
       departments.  And many of the consultants' 
 
       recommendations were already in effect or were 
 
       being implemented when the final reports were 
 
       issued.

        <p>For example, at the NYPD, one of 
 
       Commissioner Kelly's first acts was to establish a 
 
       Counterterrorism Bureau and expand the department's 
 
       Intelligence Division.  Protective and other 
 
       equipment issued to officers responding to possible

       terrorist incidents also was upgraded. 
 
        <p>McKinsey & Company also recommended that 
 
       the NYPD create a comprehensive disaster-response 
 
       plan with the means to effectuate it, measures that 
 
       have already be carried out.  The McKinsey report

       concerning the FDNY was eloquent in its praise for 
 
       the heroism and sacrifice of our firefighters. 
 
        <p>It also focused on four principal areas;  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       operational preparedness, planning and management, 
 
       communications technology and the provision of 
 
       counseling and support services to members of the 
 
       department and their families.

        <p>Since its release, the Fire Department 
 
       also has appointed a Terrorist Advisory Task Force, 
 
       headed by former CIA director, James Woolsey. 
 
        <p>Perhaps the most encouraging McKinsey
 
       finding was that while the city's massive response

       was taking place downtown, the rest of the city 
 
       remained protected with response times to 
 
       emergencies elsewhere in the five boroughs barely 
 
       impacted. 
 
        <p>Other key agencies have also responded to

       the lessons of 9/11.  The Department of Health has 
 
       enhanced its bioterrorism surveillance, developed a 
 
       Web-based system to communicate with medical 
 
       providers in our city and is building a 
 
       state-of-the-art bioterrorism laboratory.

        <p>Our Office of Emergency Management has an 
 
       interim headquarters and is in the process of 
 
       building a new permanent home.  It has also  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       coordinated a series of inter-agency preparedness 
 
       exercises which have guided our city's response to 
 
       the increased security needs occasioned by the 
 
       current war in Iraq.

        <p>New York City, which unfortunately is one 
 
       of, if not the primary potential target of a 
 
       terrorist attack, must be prepared to both prevent 
 
       those attacks and to respond quickly and 
 
       effectively if they occur.  Our administration is

       committed to doing just that. 
 
        <p>We have developed an extraordinary system 
 
       to guard and protect this city, and every day we're 
 
       making those systems even more effective.  We are 
 
       developing the most sophisticated systems possible,

       both to prevent terrorism and respond to it. 
 
        <p>Some 10 days ago I met with President Bush 
 
       and the Homeland Security Secretary, Tom Ridge, to 
 
       brief them on the counterterrorism measures the 
 
       city has taken because of the war in Iraq.  Our

       operation is known as Operation Atlas.  Secretary 
 
       Ridge later said, "There is no city in this country 
 
       that does a better job of working across the board  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       to prevent terrorism than the City of New York." 
 
        <p>After 9/11 President Bush pledged $20 
 
       billion in federal rebuilding assistance to New 
 
       York City and he has been as good as his word.  We

       have also benefited from bipartisan support in 
 
       both houses of Congress on this matter, but we now 
 
       need additional help from the federal government to 
 
       meet the high costs of homeland security. 
 
        <p>New York City is the nation's financial

       capital and its communications nerve center. 
 
       Protection for New York is protection for the 
 
       nation.  And the key to our city's ability to 
 
       respond to any future terrorist attack is funding. 
 
        <p>I am sure you're aware of the city's

       fiscal plight.  We face a multi-billion-dollar 
 
       budget gap for the fiscal year beginning July 1st. 
 
       Much of that deficit is the result of the increased 
 
       expenses and decreased economic activity created by 
 
       9/11 and its aftermath.

        <p>I urge the Commission in the most emphatic 
 
       form possible to recommend to Congress that it 
 
       appropriate sufficient monies earmarked to the  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       cities most vulnerable to attack to help us defray 
 
       the extraordinary costs of protecting our citizens 
 
       and the whole country. 
 
        <p>Specifically, we have requested additional

       funds for counterterrorism training, equipment and 
 
       to cover the costs of our massive security 
 
       operations around the city in the supplemental 
 
       appropriation the administration sent to Congress 
 
       last week.  The Homeland Security Fund should be

       allocated on the basis of threat analysis and risk. 
 
       Any other formula, for example by population, 
 
       defies logic and makes a mockery of the country's 
 
       counterterrorism efforts. 
 
        <p>New York City has been targeted, let me

       remind you, four times by terrorists and the 
 
       federal government cannot ignore our symbolic 
 
       value, recent history and common sense as it works 
 
       to increase homeland security.  To argue that most 
 
       other cities have comparable threats is just

       ridiculous. 
 
        <p>New York City, to put it into perspective, 
 
       is estimated to receive between 8 and 11 million  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       dollars out of the 560 million dollars from the 
 
       last Homeland Security distribution.  At some point 
 
       politics has to give way to reality.  If we 
 
       distributed monies to the military this way, our

       troops in Iraq would have bows and arrows to fight 
 
       with. 
 
        <p>I want to close with some comments on 
 
       another problem that deserves your attention and 
 
       that of our policymakers.  It is how to deal with

       the massive destruction and personal injuries that 
 
       can result from a terrorist attack. 
 
        <p>New York's response to 9/11 was truly 
 
       extraordinary.  Within hours of the collapse of the 
 
       World Trade Center buildings, the city government

       and private companies had equipment and personnel 
 
       at Ground Zero to undertake the massive recovery 
 
       and debris-removal operations that were necessary. 
 
       The city and these contractors stayed there until 
 
       the end and did so selflessly and without a thought

       to the consequences. 
 
        <p>However, in the real world there are 
 
       consequences, and one of those is lawsuits.  The  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       city and the private contracting community are now 
 
       aware of the risks we took on without the benefit 
 
       of federal protection to cover our operations.  It 
 
       took over a year and a special act of Congress for

       any significant insurance to become available to 
 
       protect the city and private contractors from such 
 
       lawsuits arising from the cleanup operation. 
 
        <p>And the insurance provided is billions of 
 
       dollars less than sought in lawsuits already filed.

       Personal-injury claims regarding alleged long-term 
 
       health damage could bankrupt our city over the next 
 
       20 years.  Congress must give us retroactive 
 
       indemnification or the drag on the national economy 
 
       from New York's economic burden will ruin

       opportunity throughout all 50 states. 
 
        <p>Knowing what we know now, it is imperative 
 
       that a federal indemnification plan be enacted that 
 
       would insure municipalities and private contractors 
 
       so that in the future, when we respond to a

       terrorist attack, we will be protected against the 
 
       inevitable lawsuits. 
 
        <p>The attacks on 9/11 were attacks on the  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       United States, not just the City of New York.  We 
 
       cannot afford the substantial risk that, in the 
 
       wake of another terrorist attack, a municipality or 
 
       state will feel it has to wait for the Army Corps

       of Engineers to do the necessary work or private 
 
       companies will feel they have to refuse to provide 
 
       assistance until and unless a statute is passed 
 
       giving them protection. 
 
        <p>Therefore, the Commission should urge

       Congress to enact a special indemnification or 
 
       insurance program for governmental entities and 
 
       their contractors who respond to such an attack to 
 
       insure that FEMA can and will fund significant 
 
       intermediate insurance coverage to such governments

       and contractors.  Without Congressional action, the 
 
       nation will be unprepared to respond to the 
 
       destruction created by any future terrorist 
 
       attacks. 
 
        <p>Despite their extraordinarily busy

       schedules and the work they're doing right now to 
 
       meet the heightened security concerns accompanying 
 
       the war in Iraq, Commissioners Kelly and Scoppetta  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       are here to answer any questions you may have. 
 
        <p>Before turning over the floor to you and 
 
       to them I want to conclude with this thought: You 
 
       are charged with performing a great service to this

       nation and we all want to do what we can to 
 
       remember those who perished on 9/11 and those who 
 
       so selflessly toiled for the days and weeks and 
 
       months thereafter. 
 
        <p>We must learn the lessons of that terrible

       day and make sure that this city and other cities 
 
       in our nation have the communications systems, the 
 
       well-trained personnel and the federal assistance 
 
       we need to prevent and respond to such attacks in 
 
       the future.  Thank you.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much for 
 
       your comments.  We did not expect Commissioners 
 
       Kelly and Scoppetta -- excuse me? 
 
        <p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  Scoppetta. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  -- Scoppetta this morning.

        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I thought it would be 
 
       easier with all of us here, since one of the keys 
 
       is to make sure that we have all the departments  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       cooperating, so I thought that if we all testified 
 
       together, it would give you a better opportunity to 
 
       understand just how well prepared this city was and 
 
       is.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  We'd be delighted to hear. 
 
       I know we have a panel tomorrow at which 
 
       representatives from your departments are going to 
 
       take part.  We would be delighted at this point to 
 
       hear Commissioner Kelly and Commissioner Scoppetta,

       any comments you would like to add to the Mayor's. 
 
        <p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  I think we just can answer 
 
       questions, Mr. Chairman. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Mr. Chairman, I

       apologize, Mayor, I was asking the staff if this 

 
       meant that we would not have their expertise and 
 
       their insight and their counsel tomorrow. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Keep in mind that 
 
       neither were commissioners when the attacks

       occurred, or in the first three months.  They're 
 
       really only able to testify to the city's response 
 
       after 9/11's aftermath, starting January 1st, when  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       they took the lessons that we learned and actually 
 
       tried to implement them. 
 
        <p>And for the last 15 months, they have been 
 
       working very hard to increase this city's

       preparedness to any future attack, but certainly 
 
       more than that, to focus on preventing an attack. 
 
       People talk about first responders, these are our 
 
       first preventers. 
 
        <p>And the city is well-served by the NYPD

       and the Fire Department, not only to prevent 
 
       possible terrorist attacks, but if you take a look 
 
       at the murder rate and the deaths from fires 
 
       continues to decline and has precipitously in the 
 
       last 15 months, that's their job and they do it

       very well. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  But Mayor, my 
 
       question was, will they still be available to us 
 
       tomorrow at the 1:30 to 3:00 panel? 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I thought I would make

       the head of the Department of Design and 
 
       Construction, Ken Holden, available.  He's the only 
 
       one in the administration that was running an  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       agency then and was onsite, and he can add a lot. 
 
       I think if there were specific questions, 
 
       unfortunately, both of these guys have an awful lot 
 
       to do, so I thought if we all came, we could avoid

       wasting their time. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Congressman Gorelick? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Let me say this. 
 
       Ray Kelly is probably the best-suited person in 
 
       this country to talk to us about the coordination

       that is taking place in real time between our 
 
       localities and the various agencies of the federal 
 
       government. 
 
        <p>I had the privilege of working with Ray 
 
       when he was in the federal government in various

       capacities, and I know that he's deeply involved 
 
       with our federal agencies.  I would find it 
 
       enormously helpful if we could have a session with 
 
       you at some later point to talk in detail about how 
 
       it is working for you in the city.

        <p>I would love to hear a general statement 
 
       now, but to Commissioner Roemer's point, I think we 
 
       could learn a great deal from you, if you would  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       make yourself available to us, I know you're 
 
       incredibly busy, but if you could make yourself 
 
       available to us, give us a sense of how the various 
 
       elements of the federal government are relating to

       each other and to you. 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  Sure, we can do that in the 
 
       future. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  But if you could 
 
       characterize it now, I think it would be helpful

       just to get us started and locate it, if you would. 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  I think there's no question 
 
       that state and local and federal agencies are 
 
       working more closely now than ever before.  We have 
 
       an excellent working relationship, that is the NYPD

       does with both the FBI and the CIA, and also the state's 
 
       Office of Public Security that is involved.  We're 
 
       much closer now than ever before.  We have a 
 
       free flow of information. 
 
        <p>I don't think there's any question in my

       mind that we're not getting information certainly 
 
       relevant to New York City on an immediate basis. 
 
       Internally in the city, I think we're working much  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       closer.  Commissioner Scoppetta and I and the staff 
 
       of the Fire and Police Department work closely 
 
       together. 
 
        <p>We now have executives assigned to each

       other's headquarters.  We make available our 
 
       helicopter assets to fire chiefs to survey the 
 
       scene of major events or major fires.  We are now 
 
       able to communicate on a city-wide basis, an 
 
       interagency-communication net that exists.  I think

       it certainly needs further development. 
 
       Commissioner Scoppetta can give you more specific 
 
       information about their communications systems. 
 
        <p>So just, you know, in a nutshell, there's 
 
       much more communication, much more coordination

       than there has ever been before.  Are there 
 
       occasional hiccups?  Yeah, but nothing really of 
 
       significance.  So I don't know how I can say it 
 
       more directly. 
 
        <p>We're getting the information that we

       think we need.  We, for instance, have increased 
 
       our Joint Terrorism Task Force component.  On 
 
       September 11, 2001, there were 17 investigators  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       from the NYPD, on the Joint Terrorism Task Force, 
 
       there are now over a hundred and they are working with 
 
       the FBI literally throughout the world. 
 
        <p>The CIA has been very forthcoming with

       information, as well.  We have brought onboard 
 
       General Frank Libutti, retired, a Marine Corps 
 
       Lieutenant General, to head our Counterterrorism 
 
       Bureau, and in that bureau is our Joint Terrorist 
 
       Task Force component.

        <p>We have also brought onboard David Cohen, 
 
       former Deputy Director and Director of Operations 
 
       for the CIA.  Commissioner Cohen is in charge of 
 
       the Intelligence Division.  He has really done a 
 
       remarkable job pulling that together.  We have our

       own Arabic speakers, Urdu, Pashtu, Hindi speakers 
 
       that we've brought together, and again, in that 
 
       construct, we work closely with the federal 
 
       government, as well. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  As we proceed, I

       think it would be enormously helpful if we could 
 
       sit down with you and your team as we -- 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I thought tomorrow we'd  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       deliver a statement from both the Police 
 
       Commissioner and the Fire Commissioner, a written 
 
       statement, so that you can start going in that 
 
       direction.  And as you get more information and

       formulate specific questions, we'd be happy to 
 
       answer questions. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you, Mayor. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Hamilton? 
 
        <p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  Mayor, I am very

       grateful to you and your colleagues for coming this 
 
       morning.  And what especially I appreciated about 
 
       your statement was the specific recommendations you 
 
       made. 
 
        <p>Our task as a Commission, at the end of

       the day, will be to make recommendations to 
 
       policymakers to prevent such attacks occurring 
 
       again.  And while you're here -- and I hope without 
 
       taking advantage of you -- I would like to get from 
 
       you what several recommendations you think are most

       important for this Commission to make with regard 
 
       to the prevention of future attacks. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Well, funding for the  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       people on the ground is perhaps the most important 
 
       thing that Congress could do.  In the end, it is 
 
       the cop on the beat, it is the firefighter in the 
 
       truck that does the work.

        <p>We can talk about policies, we can fund 
 
       studies, but you need to get those people that do 
 
       the work to be well trained, to have the equipment 
 
       they need and to be fairly compensated.  And you 
 
       will only do that if you direct the monies to where

       the need is. 
 
        <p>It is laughable, and tragically laughable, 
 
       to think that a tiny city in another state is under 
 
       the same kind of threat that New York City is or 
 
       that if an attack were -- let us pray not -- but if

       an attack were to take place that it would have the 
 
       same kind of effect on the entire country. 
 
        <p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  My point was 
 
       prevention, your point is protection.  Your point 
 
       is very, very important and very valuable.  And I

       think your experience in New York City can teach us 
 
       an awful lot about how we respond to terrorism and 
 
       how we can protect against terrorism, but is there  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       anything that comes out of the New York City 
 
       experience that can guide us with regard to the 
 
       prevention of terrorism? 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  We have a thousand of

       our police officers on intelligence.  The New York 
 
       City Police Department has its own police officers 
 
       in major cities around the world so that we get 
 
       intelligence.  What you see under Operation Atlas, a 
 
       group of heavily armed men and women in police

       uniforms all of a sudden show up and then go 
 
       someplace else totally unexpected, that is a 
 
       preventive thing. 
 
        <p>VICE CHAIRMAN HAMILTON:  Are you 
 
       comfortable with the amount of intelligence you get

       from the federal government?  Is there good 
 
       coordination with our intelligence agencies at the 
 
       federal level and your intelligence agencies? 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  As the Commissioner 
 
       said, that in terms of information that references

       New York, Commissioner Kelly is comfortable that we 
 
       get it virtually instantly.  The problem with 
 
       intelligence is there's so much and it tends to be  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       so unspecific that there isn't a direct answer to 
 
       your question. 
 
        <p>Only in retrospect can you look back and 
 
       say whether or not you had too few assets deployed.

       We will never know whether we had too many, but we 
 
       have an obligation to prevent, to protect, and if 
 
       need be respond to the public, not just terrorism 
 
       from terrorists, terrorism from criminals. 
 
        <p>There's lots of different things that all

       of our security agencies, law-enforcement agencies, 
 
       Fire Department, medical people, have to 
 
       respond to every day.  Not everything is caused by 
 
       terrorists. 
 
        <p>I think we're going in the right

       direction.  We have a commitment to provide the 
 
       level of security that we believe is adequate.  It 
 
       is not as much as we would like.  I'd love to have 
 
       a firehouse on every corner.  We can't afford that. 
 
       I'd love to have a police officer stationed in the

       lobby of every building.  We can't afford that.  We 
 
       have to deal with the economic realities of the 
 
       world.  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
        <p>Having said that, we will provide the 
 
       level that our senior management in police and fire 
 
       think is appropriate to make this city safe.  And 
 
       the consequences of doing that are that we will

       have to, unfortunately, not do many of the other 
 
       things that the people of this city and this 
 
       country need, due to the limited resources. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Commissioner Ben-Veniste? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Mayor

       Bloomberg, I thank you for your pledge of full 
 
       cooperation, and we will certainly take you up on 
 
       it.  I would like to congratulate you on your 
 
       selection of my old friend and colleague, Nick 
 
       Scoppetta, to be Fire Commissioner.  And I see Ray

       Kelly, who I have had the privilege of meeting with 
 
       in the past. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Let me also point out 
 
       that we have our Corporation Counsel here, so out 
 
       of the four of us up here, three are lawyers.

        <p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Not a bad 
 
       thing. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  It depends.  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Let me ask Nick 
 
       Scoppetta this question, and one we will continue 
 
       to think about, and that is the relationship of the 
 
       federal and state and local systems working

       together. 
 
        <p>Traditionally, there has been a criticism 
 
       that federal agencies and particularly our domestic 
 
       law-enforcement agencies, the FBI, has treated state 
 
       and local authorities in a manner involving a

       one-way street of information.  Many criticisms 
 
       have been laid to that situation. 
 
        <p>And let me ask both Commissioner Scoppetta 
 
       and Commissioner Kelly whether, in the post-9/11 
 
       environment, you see any improvement in the flow of

       information from the federal government to the 
 
       state and city authorities. 
 
        <p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  I think Commissioner Kelly 
 
       is in a better position to address that question. 
 
       And I'd like to start by saying that we rely

       heavily on the Police Department, and I in 
 
       particular rely heavily on my contacts with 
 
       Commissioner Kelly, which are frequent and  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       continuous.  And there has been more than one 
 
       occasion when he has called me directly to discuss 
 
       a piece of intelligence that we then jointly acted 
 
       on.

        <p>I will say that I think I have never seen 
 
       better cooperation and coordination between the 
 
       various city agencies that might be called upon to 
 
       first responders and, in particular, fire and 
 
       police.  We have done four joint exercises

       together. 
 
        <p>We have, as Commissioner Kelly mentioned, 
 
       executive liaisons at each other's headquarters 
 
       that report there every day.  We have a high-level 
 
       working committee, our chief of the department, our

       chief of operations and their counterparts in the 
 
       Police Department meet on a regular basis. 
 
        <p>And so there is a lot of coordination and 
 
       cooperation and joint planning with police and 
 
       fire, which is the thing that concerns me

       primarily.  And the relationship with the FBI and 
 
       the other law-enforcement and intelligence 
 
       communities on the federal level is one that Ray  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       Kelly has I think a very good relationship with. 
 
       And we rely heavily on police intelligence. 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  I have been in law enforcement 
 
       a long time, both on the federal and the local

       level.  And clearly there were some issues in the 
 
       past with the flow of information. 
 
        <p>I can tell you that has changed 
 
       significantly in the aftermath of September 11th. 
 
       I think the Patriot Act also has changed it.  So

       there were some restrictions placed on the federal 
 
       agencies restricting them from talking to other 
 
       agencies, and indeed talking to local agencies.  That 
 
       has changed. 
 
        <p>There is a palpable difference in their

       approach to doing business.  They want to get that 
 
       information out.  They are getting it out.  Again, 
 
       we're commingled, you might say, on the Joint 
 
       Terrorism Task Force level, as never before, with a 
 
       number of investigators that we have assigned over

       there. 
 
        <p>So in terms of the flow of information, it 
 
       is much, much different, much better than it was  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       prior to September 11th. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  But let me also add that 
 
       it is not just police and fire with this kind of 
 
       terrorism that you saw on 9/11.  Our Office of

       Emergency Management, our Department of Health and 
 
       Mental Hygiene, our Medical Examiner's Office, our 
 
       Department of Environmental Protection, all of 
 
       those agencies meet virtually every day, have 
 
       contacts, either in person or over the phone.

        <p>The threat to this country and the threat 
 
       to this city of an attack on our water supply or a 
 
       bioterrorism threat or a chemical threat, those are 
 
       the kinds of agencies that would have to recognize 
 
       threats, occurrences, when they take place, which

       is not easy to do. 
 
        <p>You don't just wake up and say, oh, we 
 
       have a bioterrorism threat or an attack.  It's over 
 
       a period of time that you build information to say, 
 
       hey, we must have been attacked days ago.  That's

       the way bioterrorism works. And it is having scientists, researchers, 
 
       personnel on the ground that look and have their  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       eyes and ears open and exercise common sense and 
 
       have the interdisciplinary as well as interagency 
 
       coordination.  I just cannot tell you the amount of 
 
       research that is done every day to make sure the

       city stays safe.  And it's not just looking for the 
 
       kinds of acts that are obvious once they take 
 
       place. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  Let me follow 
 
       up in one way.  And I'm gratified to hear

       Commissioner Kelly's statement with respect to 
 
       cooperation from the FBI and other 
 
       intelligence-gathering agencies of the federal 
 
       government. 
 
        <p>Are there specific areas where you feel

       improvement still needs to be made? 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  I think it's something that 
 
       has to be worked on every day.  You have to be 
 
       aware of it and be conscious of it every day.  We 
 
       don't want agencies to fall back into old habits.  And I

       think that it is very important at the top, 
 
       certainly here in this city, we have a great 
 
       working relationship with the Assistant Director of  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       the FBI, Kevin Donovan. 
 
        <p>It's something that you have to focus on 
 
       and use.  You just can't let that slip.  So I can't 
 
       think of a particular area where we would want to

       say we need more information in that area. 
 
        <p>I think it's general approach.  People 
 
       want that information to go forward.  Quite 
 
       frankly, they don't want to be caught holding onto 
 
       information that should be disseminated.  So people

       now see it in their interest to move that 
 
       information forward. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE:  I appreciate 
 
       that.  And we look forward to you continuing to 
 
       think about these issues and to advise us of where

       we may be helpful in making recommendations for 
 
       even further cooperation. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  We'd better move on 
 
       because we have two more Commissioners with 
 
       questions.  I know we're going to deal with this

       subject more tomorrow.  Commissioner Thompson and 
 
       Commissioner Roemer. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER THOMPSON:  I'd be interested,  
  
        <p>        <p>        <p>             
 
       Mr. Chairman, in hearing from either Commissioner 
 
       about their opportunity, if one has presented 
 
       itself -- I know that they have been 
 
       extraordinarily busy with their New York duties --

       in passing on to their peers in law enforcement and 
 
       firefighting across the United States and other 
 
       large metropolitan areas the lessons that these 
 
       departments have learned, or if they have not yet 
 
       had that opportunity, whether they plan to do that

       in the future. 
 
        <p>MR. SCOPPETTA:  A lot of our people have 
 
       spent a lot of time since 9/11 traveling to other 
 
       jurisdictions, talking about our experience, 
 
       talking about the lessons we have learned.  And in

       fact, when we had the McKinsey study done of our 
 
       response on 9/11, the McKinsey people and our 
 
       senior chiefs traveled across the country, both 
 
       talking about our experience and trying to learn 
 
       something from other jurisdictions.  That was

       extremely useful.  So there's been a lot of that. 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  We have done some of that, but 
 
       quite frankly, our focus is right here in New York.  
 
       There's an opportunity cost when you take your 
 
       senior leadership and maybe send them to other 
 
       jurisdictions.  I think people are welcome to come 
 
       here to New York.

        <p>I think the Mayor proposed that perhaps 
 
       even there is a possibility for us to maybe have some lessons 
 
       given and perhaps some money can come our way as a 
 
       result of that, but quite frankly, we are focused 
 
       on New York and protecting this city.  So we

       haven't done as much of that, I guess, as we could 
 
       have. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  I did volunteer to the 
 
       President and to Secretary Ridge, that we would be 
 
       happy, financing and time being available, to share

       lessons which we learned here with other 
 
       municipalities.  Keep in mind that New York, 
 
       because of its size and density, is somewhat 
 
       different than any other city, even the other very 
 
       large cities.

        <p>To put it in perspective, our police 
 
       department is bigger than the police departments of 
 
       the next four largest cities in this country  
 
       combined.  So we have a different problem. 
 
        <p>Forty percent of our population was born 
 
       outside of the United States.  There is roughly 140 
 
       different languages spoken here in New York City.

       So when another city might look for somebody that 
 
       speaks a language, we probably have a hundred 
 
       people in the Police Department that speak that 
 
       language. 
 
        <p>We have a service where you can call 24

       hours a day, seven days a week, to interact with 
 
       municipal government.  We have identified 170 
 
       different languages that we could take your 
 
       question in and give you a response. 
 
        <p>I will say that when we had the terrible

       tragedy of 9/11, this country responded to help New 
 
       York in ways that New Yorkers will forever remember 
 
       and forever be grateful.  And I said to the 
 
       President and to Secretary Ridge, if we can find 
 
       the funding and the time, perhaps there are some

       ways that we can, in a small measure, by helping 
 
       the rest of this country, say thank you for their 
 
       outpouring of support back then.  
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you. 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  I just want to add one thing, 
 
       I'm sorry, Governor.  We do have an excellent 
 
       working relationship with the senior staff of the

       Chicago Police Department.  They did visit here 
 
       with us and we have sent representatives there.  So 
 
       I know you might have particular interest in 
 
       Illinois.  I wanted to emphasize that. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Congressman Roemer.

        <p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Commissioner Kelly, 
 
       you not only hit right away on one of the 
 
       Governor's concerns, you hit absolutely on the mark 
 
       in your two minutes what the United States Congress 
 
       looked at for 12 months in the Joint Inquiry with

       regard to what are the two key issues to make sure 
 
       the federal government is sharing information with 
 
       local Police Departments and Fire Departments and 
 
       intelligence agencies. 
 
        <p>The two key issues that we found, and I

       wish you would comment on them, are one, how do we make 
 
       sure the people in your department get clearances. 
 
       The Governor of Virginia, Jim Gilmore, eloquently  
 
       complained to Congress that he wasn't even cleared, 
 
       as a governor, to get certain information.  And how 
 
       do you then make sure that you get the information 
 
       to you and your top people.

        <p>The second issue is, as you again hit on 
 
       and I wish you'd be a little bit more explicit 
 
       about some ways we can improve this, is 
 
       actionable intelligence.  How do we improve the 
 
       specifics of that information to you the first

       time, if not the second time, to give you the right 
 
       information that can help you prevent some kind of 
 
       terrorist attack from taking place? 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  I think the granting of 
 
       clearances is a real issue.  It is still an issue

       and it obviously has to be handled on the federal 
 
       level.  There has been some give in the granting of 
 
       interim clearances, but it just has to be speeded 
 
       up. 
 
        <p>And we are on the receiving end of that.

       I think the Mayor and I have had some discussions 
 
       about that.  The background checks are extensive. 
 
       There's some archaic regulations.  
 
        <p>I myself have not been, I've gone through 
 
       the nomination process twice.  And when I was in 
 
       the federal government, I moved from one job to the 
 
       other requiring another clearance process.  That

       whole thing had to be done again, even though I was 
 
       sitting in an office.  I was an Undersecretary 
 
       moving to the Commissioner position.  I had to go 
 
       through the whole process again.  It simply did not 
 
       make sense.  So I think that we just need give

       in that regard. 
 
        <p>As far as actionable intelligence, the 
 
       problems, it just doesn't come in a neat package. 
 
       It's not specific.  We're not getting it as a 
 
       nation with great specificity.  It's not coming to

       us with specificity.  We're getting bits and pieces 
 
       and it's difficult for our intelligence agencies. 
 
       And we work with them.  It's difficult to put it 
 
       together.  There's no easy answer. 
 
        <p>And you know, we can go back 30 years and

       all of these discussions that we've had about 
 
       over-reliance on technology versus human 
 
       intelligence, but that's what we're faced with now,  
 
       that's what we get on a national level, that's what 
 
       comes down to us on the local level. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  Let me add to that.  One 
 
       of the surest ways to let the terrorists attack us

       again is for all of us to stay home, seal ourselves 
 
       in, and let our economy and our lives fall apart 
 
       because of a perceived threat. 
 
        <p>America is a country that for 225 years 
 
       has been willing to stand up, run risks, fight to

       make sure that we stay a democratic country and to 
 
       try to help the rest of the world.  And we have not 
 
       gone back and hidden ourselves at home.  We have to 
 
       say, turn it over to the professionals and go about 
 
       our business.

        <p>And this constant reaction to ill-defined 
 
       terrorist threats can only damage our economy and 
 
       prevent us from responding later on when a real 
 
       threat does occur.  And we have to be very careful 
 
       that we don't go in the other direction in the

       interest of being able to show that we had X number 
 
       of threats and we responded here, here and here. 
 
        <p>The fact of the matter is, the public has  
 
       to go on.  This is, by and large, let us pray, 
 
       totally, it is a safe country.  And we have 
 
       professionals certainly in this city, and I think, 
 
       although I have a little less experience at the

       state and federal level, to prevent terrorist 
 
       attacks in the future, let us all pray.  In the 
 
       meantime, we have to go about our business and our 
 
       lives. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  The last question,

       Secretary Lehman. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN:  Yes, thank you for 
 
       your statement.  I would really like to request at 
 
       a subsequent opportunity that we get the city 
 
       government's best recommendations with regard to a

       problem that was highlighted in the Joint Committee 
 
       investigations and became a major criticism of the 
 
       FBI in particular, and that is the dominance of the 
 
       law-enforcement and prosecutorial approach to 
 
       terrorist issues and the obstacle that that becomes

       in the sharing of intelligence, which may be 
 
       evidentiary, and becomes protected as soon as an 
 
       investigation gets going, and how you, at your  
 
       level, can come up with procedures to insure that 
 
       there is full sharing among all the offices in your 
 
       government, as well as the federal government, even 
 
       at the expense of perhaps weakening the evidentiary

       sanctity of a prosecution.  That would be very 
 
       valuable to us in the future. 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  I agree.  I think that is an 
 
       excellent point.  I think it's an issue of culture. 
 
       We need that change, again, in the FBI, and

       obviously the Department of Justice, That's their 
 
       business, the prosecution. We are now forced to 
 
       be in the preventive mode where we have to focus on 
 
       stopping another event, preventing another event, 
 
       rather than doing a retrospective examination of

       one of these horrific events. 
 
        <p>It takes a lot of focus and a real 
 
       culture change in those agencies.  I think that Director Mueller is 
 
       doing an excellent job in that regard, but it is a

       heavy lift, and he understands it.  I've had these 
 
       conversations. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN:  Do you think you  
 
       have the right balance in the NYPD? 
 
        <p>MR. KELLY:  I think we have it in the 
 
       department more so than perhaps on the federal 
 
       level because I think we're literally at Ground

       Zero.  There is much more of an awareness of the 
 
       need for prevention than perhaps on the federal 
 
       level.  It's something we have to focus on, as 
 
       well. 
 
        <p>MAYOR BLOOMBERG:  And evidentiary

       considerations are not just for criminal 
 
       prosecution.  We live in a litigious society, and 
 
       we have to continue day in and day out and pay the 
 
       bills. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Mayor, I want to thank you

       very much, Commissioner Kelly, Commissioner 
 
       Scoppetta, Counsel, thank you for your time very, 
 
       very much today.  I appreciate it. 
 
<p>I now ask the panel of Mr. Waizer, David 
 
       Lim, Lee Ielpi, Brian Birdwell and Craig Sincock,

       please.  All right.  Are we ready to get started 
 
       again?  We are running behind, which I apologize 
 
       for.  We did not expect the Commissioners from New  
 
       York but thought it was wrong, since they made 
 
       themselves available, they are an important part of 
 
       this, and I thought it was wrong not to ask them 
 
       questions when they offered to accept questions.

        <p>Mr. Waizer, do you want to start in? 
 
        <p>MR. WAIZER:  Governor Kean, members of the 
 
       Commission, thank you for asking me to speak before 
 
       you today.  My experience of 9/11 differs from 
 
       yours and that of the general public.  As this

       nation and much of the world watched in shock and 
 
       horror on 9/11, as events unfolded at the World 
 
       Trade Center, at the Pentagon and in the air over 
 
       the farmlands of Pennsylvania, I was otherwise 
 
       engaged, battling for my life.  If hearing my

       personal story can help this Commission fulfill its 
 
       important task, I will gladly tell it. 
 
        <p>On September 11th, at approximately 8:46 
 
       in the morning, I was in an elevator, somewhere 
 
       between the 78th and 101st floor, in Tower 1 of the

       World Trade Center.  I had left my wife, Karen, and 
 
       our three children, Katie then age 13, Joshua 12, 
 
       and Jodi 10, at about 7:15 that morning and I was  
 
       on my way to my offices on the 104th floor where I 
 
       was employed as Vice President and Tax Counsel in 
 
       charge of national and international tax matters 
 
       for Cantor Fitzgerald.

        <p>The elevator was ascending when, suddenly, 
 
       I felt it rocked by an explosion, and then felt it 
 
       plummeting.  Orange, streaming sparks were apparent 
 
       through the gaps in the doors at the sides of the 
 
       elevator as the elevator scraped the walls of the

       shaft.  The elevator burst into flame.  I began to 
 
       beat at the flames, burning my hands, arms and legs 
 
       in the process.  The flames went out, but I was hit 
 
       in the face and neck by a separate fireball that 
 
       came through the gap in the side of the elevator

       doors.  The elevator came to a stop on the 78th 
 
       floor, the doors opened, and I jumped out. 
 
        <p>I began the long walk down 78 flights in 
 
       the fire stairwell.  I walked, focused on my single 
 
       mission: to get to the streets and find an

       ambulance.  I knew I was seriously hurt.  The 
 
       stairwell was filled with people calmly walking 
 
       down, with no apparent sense of the magnitude of  
 
       what had just occurred.  I was shouting out to 
 
       people in the stairwell, telling them I was burned, 
 
       asking them to step aside so that I could get down 
 
       more quickly.  Faces turned towards me, sometimes

       with apparent annoyance at this intrusion on the 
 
       orderly evacuation process.  I saw the look on many 
 
       of those faces turn to sympathy or horror as they 
 
       saw me.  At one point I noticed a large flap of 
 
       skin hanging on my arm.  I did not look any

       further. 
 
        <p>Somewhere on the way down, I believe 
 
       around the 50th floor, I met a man who appeared to 
 
       be either a firefighter or Emergency Medical 
 
       Technician walking up.  He stopped, turned around,

       and walked in front of me, leading me down.  We 
 
       made it to the lobby and walked two blocks to find 
 
       an empty ambulance, which took me to the Burn 
 
       Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital.  I stayed 
 
       conscious only long enough to give them my name and

       my wife's phone number. 
 
        <p>I have no memories after that for some six 
 
       or seven weeks; I spent that period in a state of  
 
       induced coma, but I can offer a secondhand account 
 
       of some of the more important personal events.  I 
 
       was triaged at the hospital, where they took my 
 
       clothes, wallet, watch and glasses, none of which I

       ever saw again.  They began to cut off my wedding 
 
       band from my badly burned fingers, but a 
 
       sympathetic nurse used an entire jar of lubricant 
 
       to remove it intact and saved it for my wife. 
 
       Karen has worn that ring on a chain around her neck

       since then, saving it for the day when I can wear 
 
       it on my finger again. 
 
        <p>As the world watched with horror as the 
 
       events of that morning unfolded, Karen began 
 
       receiving phone calls from friends and relatives.

       She tried to call me and waited, with fading hope, 
 
       for me to call her.  Friends and family gathered at 
 
       my home to offer hope and, if the worst happened, 
 
       comfort.  My two older children, having heard of 
 
       the attack called home and were allowed to return

       home.  My 10 year old daughter remained in school, 
 
       unaware.  At 12:30 the nurse was finally able to 
 
       call Karen, who took the call in our kitchen and  
 
       passed the news on to the others that I was alive. 
 
       Screams and tears of joy filled that room.  But as 
 
       one nightmare ended for her, another was to begin. 
 
        <p>Karen had no idea how seriously I had been

       injured.  She was unable to reach me at the 
 
       hospital until almost 8 o'clock that evening.  When 
 
       Karen first saw me that night, I was not 
 
       recognizable.  My head was swollen almost 
 
       basketball size, the rest of my body had similarly

       swelled and my features were either covered by 
 
       bandages or so blackened and distorted as to be 
 
       unidentifiable.  It was only the ring that gave her 
 
       any comfort that the swollen, misshapen body lying 
 
       in that hospital bed was in fact her husband.

        <p>The doctors explained to Karen the nature 
 
       and severity of my injuries.  I was particularly at 
 
       risk because the fireball in my face had seared my 
 
       windpipe and lungs and I had inhaled a large amount 
 
       of jet fuel, leaving me particularly prone to

       life-threatening infections.  I have since been 
 
       told that my chances of survival at that moment 
 
       were roughly five percent.  
 
        <p>That night began a seven-week 
 
       roller-coaster ride for Karen, friends and family. 
 
       I would appear to be recovering one day and be 
 
       diagnosed with a highly dangerous infection the

       next.  I underwent multiple surgeries to graft new 
 
       skin on my hands, arms, face and neck, suffered a 
 
       blood clot, a seizure, a partial lung collapse and 
 
       a series of blood and lung infections. 
 
        <p>Karen's mother moved up from Delaware into

       our home to take care of our three children. 
 
       Members of our local and our synagogue communities 
 
       delivered dinner to our home and drove our children 
 
       to their various activities.  Friends and family 
 
       accompanied Karen to the hospital every day.  Mine

       was not just a personal struggle, it was shared by 
 
       family and community. 
 
        <p>After five months of hospitalization, 
 
       multiple surgeries, a year and a half, and 
 
       counting, of painful, sometimes grueling, therapy,

       I am here today to bear witness.  My injuries have 
 
       left me with lung damage, chronic pain in my right 
 
       elbow, my left knee, my back, damage to my vocal  
 
       cords and the prognosis for the nerve and tendon 
 
       damage in my hands is still uncertain.  But I can 
 
       enjoy various activities, play with my children, 
 
       and enjoy my time spent with my wife, with my

       friends and family. 
 
        <p>I am one of the handful of lucky ones. 
 
       Just blocks away from here lay the unrecovered 
 
       remains of many friends and colleagues, some dear 
 
       friends.  They can no longer speak for themselves

       and I am left with the unchosen, unhappy task of 
 
       trying to speak for them.  I do this with no 
 
       particular moral authority, but neither I nor they 
 
       have a choice. 
 
        <p>I have no rage about what happened on

       9/11, only a deep sadness for the many innocent, 
 
       worthy lives lost and the loved ones who lost so 
 
       much that day.  There have always been madmen, 
 
       perhaps there always will be.  They must be 
 
       stopped, but with the cold detachment reserved by a

       surgeon for removing a cancer.  They are not worthy 
 
       of my rage.  Neither do I feel anger at those who 
 
       arguably could have foreseen, and thereby  
 
       prevented, the tragedies.  If there were mistakes, 
 
       they were the mistakes of complacency, a 
 
       complacency in which we all shared. 
 
        <p>This Commission cannot turn back the hands

       of time.  There's nothing to be gained by asserting 
 
       blame, by pointing fingers.  The dead will remain 
 
       dead despite this Commission's best efforts and 
 
       intentions.  But it is my hope that this Commission 
 
       can learn and teach us from its scrutiny of the

       past, and if the findings of this Commission can 
 
       prevent even one future 9/11, if they can forestall 
 
       even one plan of Osama bin Laden, prevent even one 
 
       more act of madness and horror, I and the rest of 
 
       this nation will owe the Commission our gratitude,

       and I will be proud of the small part I was allowed 
 
       to play today. 
 
        <p>I do have one concern I would like to 
 
       voice.  I have no political experience, but I do 
 
       have experience as an informed citizen.  It tells

       me that commissions such as this are usually formed 
 
       by men and women of good will, have committed, 
 
       intelligent members and staff possessed of good  
 
       will, and eventually produce reports that are read 
 
       carefully and seriously by others of good will. 
 
       Yet the findings of such commissions are often 
 
       ignored in the end.  Compassion and concern are

       often spread thin, and other important issues 
 
       become priorities after the glare of the public 
 
       spotlight fades. 
 
        <p>My fear is that the work of this 
 
       Commission will have a similar fate.  My hope is

       that by speaking to you today, by putting a human 
 
       face on the tragedy that was 9/11, by attempting to 
 
       speak, however inadequately, for those who no 
 
       longer have voices, I can help further the cause of 
 
       this Commission and this nation, to help build a

       safer, more secure tomorrow for all of us, and that 
 
       doing so will help bring peace for us and our 
 
       children.  Thank you. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Mr. Waizer, thank you for 
 
       your eloquence, sir.  Mr. David Lim, of the Port

       Authority. 
 
        <p>MR. LIM:  I would first like to say, that 
 
       was one of the most moving statements I have ever  
 
       heard.  And it makes what I have to say, I guess, 
 
       pale in comparison. 
 
        <p>I would like to thank the Commission, 
 
       Governor Kean, for allowing me to speak before you

       today in regards to my personal experience on 9/11. 
 
       As Mr. Waizer said, if what I can tell you will 
 
       help you in any way, find a cause to prevent future 
 
       happening of events such as this, speaking from a 
 
       police officer's point of view, will be greatly

       appreciated. 
 
        <p>I saw, I saw a great number of my 
 
       brethren, 37 Port Authority police officers were 
 
       killed that day.  Port Authority police only had 
 
       1,100 police officers at that time.  And therein

       lies my responsibility, the same as Mr. Waizer's, I 
 
       have to speak now for those who can no longer 
 
       speak. 
 
        <p>I guess that's where it lies heaviest for 
 
       me.  These men and women, like myself, were just

       doing our jobs that day, something we do every day. 
 
       And only recently, I guess, it's appreciated, 
 
       unfortunately, through our great loss.  
 
        <p>Someone asked why the Port Authority 
 
       police were in the World Trade Center, with the 
 
       exception of Governor Kean, of course.  The Port 
 
       Authority police are in the World Trade Center

       because the Port Authority of New York and New 
 
       Jersey built the World Trade Center.  They built it 
 
       back in the '70s and from the first time they dug 
 
       the first hole, there was a Port Authority police 
 
       officer present to provide security for that area.

        <p>When I first became a police officer, that 
 
       was back in 1980, I'll be perfectly honest, I 
 
       didn't know a lot of Port Authority police.  I 
 
       wanted to be a police officer.  I wanted to serve 
 
       the public.  So I learned.

        <p>I learned that the Port Authority police 
 
       were responsible for most of the 
 
       public-transportation facilities in the bi-state 
 
       area, which of course includes tunnels, bridges, 
 
       airports, areas which obviously need security but

       post-9/11 have now become the most highlighted 
 
       areas in this area, in this theater of terrorism. 
 
       But I digress.  
 
        <p>I wanted to say a lot of things today 
 
       about the Port Authority, but I think, I guess, I 
 
       said enough about that.  And I'm going to tell you 
 
       about what happened to me that day.  When I tell

       you this, I want you to remember what I tell you is 
 
       not the story of just David Lim, it's the story of 
 
       every police officer, firefighter, EMS, civilians 
 
       that were helping out that day. 
 
        <p>As the governor, Governor Pataki, said to

       you earlier, it was a day that we all came 
 
       together.  We, everybody, pulled together to help 
 
       every else.  You will understand that as I tell my 
 
       story. 
 
        <p>I myself have been a Port Authority police

       officer for 23 years, the greater part of that at 
 
       the World Trade Center Command until I got into the 
 
       Canine Unit and have been doing that for the last 
 
       six years.  And that's where my story begins. 
 
        <p>I was working on 9/11, like I do every

       day, with my partner, Sirius, my explosive-detector 
 
       canine, checking trucks coming into the World Trade 
 
       Center.  This was considered vital, considering  
 
       what happened in '93.  We did this every day with a 
 
       great feeling that we were accomplishing a very 
 
       necessary job. 
 
        <p>The Trade Center itself, I can speak to

       the security.  We had delta barriers and all kinds 
 
       of security situations set up to prevent future 
 
       terrorist attacks after '93.  On that day I had 
 
       just finished up searching a multitude of trucks 
 
       with my partner and I had retired to my office to

       do my paperwork and have a little breakfast. 
 
        <p>8:45 a.m. all that changed.  I was in the 
 
       basement of Number 2 World Trade Center, yet I felt 
 
       the shock of the first plane hitting Tower 1.  And 
 
       that could give you at least a start of the idea of

       the power of that hit, if I was in the basement of 
 
       the other building.  I secured my partner in his 
 
       kennel, told him that I had to go help the people 
 
       -- he was a bomb dog, not a search-and-rescue dog 
 
       -- and I figured he'd be safe there while I went to

       assist.  Unfortunately, that was the last time I 
 
       saw him. 
 
        <p>I went over to Tower Number 1 to the  
 
       mezzanine level by the plaza by the sound stage 
 
       where they would have summertime shows.  I was 
 
       assisting people out of the A staircase as they 
 
       were coming out of the building.  At this point the

       debris was already falling onto the plaza. 
 
       Somebody screamed that a body was outside on the 
 
       plaza.  I went over to investigate.  And sure 
 
       enough, was the first body that I had seen. 
 
        <p>It's not something that I'm going to

       describe here, there's no point.  It's just 
 
       something that I will never forget for the rest of 
 
       my life.  Here, as a police officer, at that point 
 
       I guess 21-and-a-half-years, was what I thought was 
 
       the most important thing, I had a body, a DOA.  I

       had a lot of procedures to follow.  And I went to 
 
       call it in on the radio. 
 
        <p>And just as I did that, another body fell 
 
       about 10 feet away from that one.  And all of a 
 
       sudden, what I thought was the most important thing

       to take care of, this body, became inconsequential 
 
       in the fact that obviously things were going to get 
 
       a lot worse than this one body that I had seen.  
 
        <p>I took it upon myself at that point to 
 
       start heading up into the building to assist before 
 
       people would start jumping out of the building.  I 
 
       started going up the stairs and I saw a lot of

       frightened faces.  People were asking me what was 
 
       going on.  At that point I already heard about the 
 
       airplane, but I lowered my radio to prevent people 
 
       from getting too scared. 
 
        <p>I kept on going up, telling people to keep

       going down, down is good.  I remember running into 
 
       people similar to Mr. Waizer that were burned, 
 
       asking for help.  What I did was I assigned those 
 
       people to people that were healthy to 
 
       help get them down.  I felt the greater good was

       for me to get to a higher point to try to assist 
 
       those people upstairs. 
 
        <p>I got to the 27th floor and I saw a man in 
 
       a wheelchair waiting with his friend.  I remember 
 
       this because it's very important.  I went up to him

       and he said he was waiting for the crowd to clear 
 
       and then he would go down.  Coming up another 
 
       staircase, the B staircase, was the Fire Department  
 
       who said that they would take care of the gentleman 
 
       and that if I wanted, to proceed up. 
 
        <p>Well, I tell you, I went into the 
 
       staircase that they came out of and, as you'll

       hear, it was very important.  As I went to that 
 
       staircase, there were more people coming down. 
 
       There were some clogs of people, but generally they 
 
       were calm and they were not too frightened.  At 
 
       this point it was still rather early, but they were

       going down orderly. 
 
        <p>I got up to the 44th floor, Tower 1, the 
 
       sky lobby.  I had made that my goal based on the 
 
       fact that there are express elevators that are 
 
       situated on that floor.  My fear was that people

       coming from the middle floors would get onto those 
 
       elevators and try to take the quicker way down. 
 
        <p>I have learned from my training in ESU 
 
       that an elevator is probably not one of the better 
 
       places to be.  And I apologize for that, you know,

       it's just you didn't know, obviously, you know, at 
 
       the time.  I'm talking about post-emergency. 
 
        <p>And sure enough, just as I was starting to  
 
       get the people down, I felt another collision on 
 
       the left side.  Looking out the window I saw this 
 
       rain of fire coming down and it blew out the 
 
       windows on the 44th floor.  Fortunately, I was

       right in the middle, I was not burned, but I was 
 
       knocked to the ground by the concussion.  I grabbed 
 
       whatever people I had left. 
 
        <p>And at this point, as you say, I knew we 
 
       were under attack.  I thought it was an accident,

       there was no reason to think otherwise at that 
 
       point.  A horrible accident, something we actually 
 
       had trained for, I remember, in the '80s in case 
 
       something like that would happen.  But as I started 
 
       going down and taking the people with me, I could

       see the fear in their eyes growing. 
 
        <p>The building now was starting to shake and 
 
       was not the stablest, you know, in other words, it 
 
       was not very stable.  I'll just leave it at that. 
 
       As we were going down, I was clearing the floors,

       getting people that were left behind that were 
 
       waiting.  Most of them were either handicapped, 
 
       elderly, had someone coming with disabilities, but at  
 
       this point there was no more waiting.  We had to 
 
       go. 
 
        <p>So I proceeded to gather them, right, and 
 
       start going, start heading down.  We got to about the

       35th floor, in that general area.  I don't remember 
 
       specifically when I felt the building shaking.  I 
 
       thought for sure that my building was collapsing. 
 
       It shook and it stopped. 
 
        <p>Then I heard on the radio something I will

       never forget, it was from our police desk over at 5 
 
       World Trade Center.  And the transmission said, 
 
       "Tower 2 is down, all units evacuate Tower 1."  I 
 
       couldn't believe it.  What do you mean, Tower 2 is 
 
       down?  I mean, it's the World Trade Center.  Each

       building, 1,477 feet, can withstand anything.  But 
 
       it also raised in my mind if that building can 
 
       fall, so can mine. 
 
        <p>And now the people I was with were very 
 
       upset, of course.  I just told them, we have to

       keep going.  And we started heading down again.  On 
 
       the 21st floor I ran into three of my supervisors, 
 
       Chief Romito, Captain Mazza and Lieutenant Cirri.   
 
       They were assisting a gentleman who has having 
 
       difficulty walking and breathing.  They were making 
 
       a stretcher out of a soda push cart. 
 
        <p>I told the chief about the other building

       going down and that this collapse was imminent.  So 
 
       he gathered the gentleman, one arm over his 
 
       shoulder, Lieutenant Cirri grabbed the other arm, 
 
       and we proceeded to take him down the building with 
 
       Captain Mazza, myself and our people.  We went

       down. 
 
        <p>As we were going down, and now we were 
 
       starting to lose power in the building, the lights 
 
       were going on and off.  We had some emergency lighting in 
 
       the staircase and after '93, they'd painted stripes

       and they glow and it was very eerie watching the 
 
       stairs as they lit up.  I concentrated on the task 
 
       at hand, which was to get the people out of the 
 
       building. 
 
        <p>I got down to the fifth floor and I saw,

       that is where I met Josephine Harris and Ladder 
 
       Company 6, Ladder Company 6, a fire company out of 
 
       Chinatown.  Josephine Harris, who is a Port  
 
       Authority employee, had walked down 72 flights, and 
 
       she had a bad leg problem and she could go no 
 
       further. 
 
        <p>Captain Jonas, of Ladder 6, was attempting

       to find a chair to put her in to help carry her 
 
       down.  I told the captain it was too late.  And 
 
       following my chief's lead, I grabbed Josephine by 
 
       one arm, Firefighter Tommy Falco grabbed the other 
 
       arm, with Billy Butler right behind us, we started

       going down. 
 
        <p>I remember my captain, Captain Mazza, 
 
       telling me to leave and let the Fire Department 
 
       handle that and to go with her.  And I just said, 
 
       I'm helping out, just go ahead.  Well, one more

       flight down was as far as we got and the building 
 
       started coming down.  I knew that was it because 
 
       the other building was already gone.  The memory of 
 
       that is very sharp in my mind, something I'll never 
 
       forget.  People always ask me, of course, but this,

       I knew it was coming down. 
 
        <p>All I could think of is, well, if I could 
 
       protect Josephine from the debris.  So me and Tommy  
 
       were covering her and it started coming.  And you 
 
       could feel the wind of pushing down as they were 
 
       compressing through the building, you could hear 
 
       the sound.  It was like an on-rushing locomotive or

       an avalanche.  You could almost feel the sound of 
 
       the floors pancaking on top of each other as they 
 
       were collapsing.  As we all know, they collapsed 
 
       straight down. 
 
        <p>Actually, one of the firefighters, Matty,

       actually blew right by us as he went down.  I 
 
       didn't even know that until afterwards.  And they 
 
       just kept coming and coming.  And I guess my final 
 
       thoughts were about my family.  I thought about my 
 
       wife, my kids.  Excuse me.  I hoped they would

       think well of me for what I did.  I was very 
 
       fortunate.  When the debris stopped falling -- 
 
       excuse me. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Just take your time. 
 
        <p>MR. LIM -- first I thought I had died.  I

       heard nothing, I saw nothing.  But then I heard a 
 
       voice, I heard a voice, the voice of Captain Jonas, 
 
       my new friend.  The voice was, "Who's here?"  And I  
 
       heard a fireman that was in the stairwell with us 
 
       shouting out the names of companies.  I remember 
 
       saying, "Lim, Port Authority police." 
 
        <p>We couldn't see each other.  It was

       totally black.  We couldn't breathe.  We had to try 
 
       to breathe through our shirts, but we were fairly, 
 
       in fairly good shape.  We were alive.  And we were 
 
       very grateful for that. 
 
        <p>I hoped then that Captain Jonas and the

       men of Ladder 6 and there were other fire companies 
 
       below us, of course, there was a total of 12 
 
       firefighters, Josephine and myself in that 
 
       stairwell.  And for five hours, we fought to get 
 
       out of there.  When I say we fought, we fought as a

       team. 
 
        <p>There were times you may have heard in New 
 
       York that firefighters and police officers sometimes 
 
       don't get along.  Well, we changed all that. 
 
       Between their actions and my expertise, after

       working almost 20 years in the building, we did 
 
       manage eventually to work our way out. 
 
        <p>We also managed to get ahold of our  
 
       families, I was fortunate to have a couple of cell 
 
       phones, and managed to get through to let them know 
 
       that we were okay.  And that was probably one of 
 
       the hardest moments for me was trying to explain to

       my wife that I might not get out of there.  But 
 
       she's strong, a good cop's wife, she understood, I 
 
       was doing my job. 
 
        <p>We ended up going up to get out through 
 
       the sixth floor stair, top of the staircase.  We

       had started smelling jet fuel in the staircase, 
 
       unburned jet fuel, and the fear of fire had caused 
 
       us to work even harder to get out.  We saw a light 
 
       over the sixth-floor staircase and our first 
 
       thought was that the floor had power in it and it was

       virtually, or at least partially, intact, we could 
 
       make our stand there. 
 
        <p>We felt we would be there for a lot longer 
 
       than five hours.  As it turns out, as that light 
 
       got brighter, it turned out to be the sun.  We were

       virtually standing on top of what was left of the 
 
       World Trade Center.  When I say that, you have to 
 
       picture a straw in a pancake.  We were in that  
 
       straw. 
 
        <p>By all the engineers and everybody else 
 
       that tried to figure this out, there's no reason 
 
       why I should be sitting here talking to you right

       now.  It was just a small sliver of staircase from 
 
       the sixth floor down to the first floor, damaged, 
 
       though still enough to keep us alive, that 
 
       preserved our lives. 
 
        <p>We finally got through on the radio to

       Ladder Company 43 and they managed to come and 
 
       throw us ropes.  We managed to climb down onto the 
 
       debris field in order to exit.  They sent two of 
 
       their officers to stand by with Josephine for a 
 
       basket in order to carry her out.

        <p>Then came the trek to get out of Ground 
 
       Zero.  And that in itself was treacherous.  One of 
 
       our party had a concussion, Mikey Meldrom, so I was 
 
       helping him.  And the field was still on fire. 
 
       There were things that we saw that, like I said, there is

       no need to repeat. 
 
        <p>So we attempted to exit actually through, 
 
       ironically enough, the U.S. Customs House over at  
 
       Six World Trade Center, but then we saw fire and we 
 
       heard what we thought was gunfire.  And I guess in 
 
       my moment of stress, I thought we were under attack 
 
       and these guys had landed on the beach.  And all I

       could think of was, well, I've got 46 rounds, I'll 
 
       take 'em. 
 
        <p>But as it turned out, it was just ammunition 
 
       going off.  But you still couldn't go out that way. 
 
       We ended up going out by One World Trade Center and

       exiting on West Street.  We finally got out, I 
 
       think it was around 3:30 or so and we were beaten, 
 
       but we were alive, virtually with minor injuries. 
 
        <p>Myself, I was taken to the hospital with a 
 
       concussion and some leg and back injuries which I

       have recovered from.  But I guess it's the mental 
 
       injuries that I still suffer at times.  Yes, I 
 
       still have some nightmares, I still have trouble, 
 
       as you can see, talking about this at times, but I 
 
       think it's important that we as a people move on.

        <p>One of the questions that I'm usually 
 
       asked when I do speak about this is why don't I 
 
       retire.  I'm a 20-plus man, I can retire any time.   
 
       And my answer is that I will retire at a time of my 
 
       choosing, not at the choosing of some knucklehead 
 
       from Afghanistan.  No way is he going to determine 
 
       when this cop is going to quit.

        <p>I just again want to thank you for 
 
       allowing me to speak here.  And I know, I know it's 
 
       obviously not quite as important as all the people 
 
       that we lost.  I grieve for all those that I knew 
 
       that day, I grieve for those that I will never

       know, but I also grieve for the best partner I ever 
 
       had.  Thank you very much. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Thank you. Mr. Ielpi? 
 
        <p>MR. IELPI:  Good morning.  Before I start, 
 
       let me say two things.  One, I'm not used to

       reading, I'd rather talk candidly, but I'm going to 
 
       have to read for time.  And two, some of the things 
 
       I'm going to say are going to be sensitive to some 
 
       of the families that might be listening, so I'd 
 
       like to let them know ahead of time.

        <p>I come to you today as an ambassador for 
 
       the dead and on behalf of the many others who 
 
       toiled at Ground Zero to recover the victims of the  
 
       terrorist attack.  My son Jonathan, a member of 
 
       Squad Company 288 at the New York City Fire 
 
       Department, was killed in the South Tower. 
 
        <p>I am a retired firefighter and a grieving

       father.  I bring no political agenda to this 
 
       hearing.  The only baggage I bear is a broken heart 
 
       and a resolve that the terrible events of September 
 
       11th not be repeated. 
 
        <p>Ten minutes is a very short time to

       summarize even one day of the horror and loss that 
 
       filled Ground Zero.  It is far too short to describe 
 
       nine months of picking though rubble and debris, to 
 
       find torsos, fingers, arms, bones and legs. Far too 
 
       short to convey one year and seven months of

       missing my son and looking into the sorrowful eyes 
 
       of his mother, his siblings, his wife, his 
 
       children.  I can only summarize.  I cannot 
 
       summarize an eternity, I can only share with you 
 
       some of the images of Ground Zero that I will carry

       with me forever. 
 
        <p>That morning when I arrived at the Trade 
 
       Center site, I got there about half an hour, within  
 
       a half an hour after the South Tower had come down. 
 
       I saw my first fatality, a New York City 
 
       firefighter laying by his apparatus.  I continued 
 
       down the block.  I got down to West and Vessey

       where the walkway spanned the West Side Highway. 
 
       It had collapsed onto a number of fire vehicles. 
 
       We were able to crawl underneath of these vehicles 
 
       and start a search. 
 
        <p>We were able to turn off some of the

       engines that were still running.  All of the souls 
 
       that ran underneath of this walkway to find shelter 
 
       were dead.  My primary reason, of course, was to 
 
       find my son.  My ultimate reason was to find my 
 
       son.  I continued searching with a lot of my

       friends that I had met.  I had been a firefighter 
 
       for some 26 years and I know a lot of people on the 
 
       job. 
 
        <p>The searching continued in and out of 
 
       voids, under and around spaces, and over and above,

       only to find death.  We found no life.  After the 
 
       first bunch of hours at the site, for the remainder 
 
       of those nine months, we were to find nobody alive.  
 
       We were only going to find death. 
 
        <p>I continued that day in searching.  It 
 
       became quite obvious as we progressed that it was 
 
       going to be a difficult day for my family.  The

       following days were much the same.  I spent the 
 
       better part of nine months at that site searching. 
 
        <p>I met a lot of wonderful people that came 
 
       from across this country to assist us.  I cannot 
 
       begin to tell you how wonderful it was to see and

       talk and listen to these people.  These were men 
 
       and women that came to serve us, to serve us food, 
 
       to listen to us, to cry with us, to not say 
 
       anything to us. 
 
        <p>We worked with operating engineers, we

       worked with carpenters, we worked with iron 
 
       workers, we worked with police, we worked with 
 
       fire.  I worked with a number of fathers who came 
 
       to look for their sons.  I brought a picture along 
 
       with me that I will leave here.  Many of these

       fathers that came did not find their sons. 
 
        <p>On December 11th, three months to the day, 
 
       I had left the site, I was home, it was about 11:30  
 
       at night, I got a phone call.  It was Paul Ferro, 
 
       who was the Deputy Chief at the site.  He was 
 
       working the night tour.  When I heard his voice, I 
 
       knew what it was.  Paul said, Lee, we have your

       son.  I said okay, Paul, I'll be right there. 
 
        <p>I got my son Brendan, who is also a 
 
       firefighter, we hopped in a car.  We had a fire 
 
       vehicle at our disposal.  We headed back to the 
 
       site.  At about 1:30 in the morning, my son Brendan

       and I started our descent down into the site.  And 
 
       this is within the slurry-wall area, bathtub, 
 
       otherwise known as, about 35 to 40 feet below 
 
       level. 
 
        <p>Over on the side was a stokes basket, and

       my son was in it.  He was covered with an American 
 
       flag.  Paul Ferro came over to me and he put his 
 
       hands on my shoulder and he said, Lee, he's all 
 
       there.  That meant something to me.  And I will 
 
       explain it later.

        <p>I went over to my son.  I knelt down.  I 
 
       spoke to him.  I still had to feel him from head to 
 
       toe to satisfy my own curiosity.  Then with the  
 
       help of my son Brendan and some of the men from 
 
       Squad 288, we picked up my son and we carried him 
 
       up the hill.  We placed him in an ambulance and my 
 
       son Brendan and I rode with him to the morgue.  We

       were able to bring home our son in one piece and we 
 
       put him to bed at home where he belonged. 
 
        <p>We have a chart here, if I could just show 
 
       it for a second.  The work that continued at the 
 
       site went on for almost nine months.  The New York

       City Fire Department used the GPS system to mark 
 
       every remain that was found.  This map, you can see 
 
       the vast majority of remains, those are the towers. 
 
        <p>Those towers sit within the slurry-wall 
 
       area.  That area goes down six stories deep.  Every

       dot there represents a body part.  We could not 
 
       represent all of them because we went from grade 
 
       level down to six stories below, so one dot may 
 
       represent 5, 10, 15, 20 body parts.  Thank you.  I 
 
       will leave that with you also.

        <p>We meet with the -- I belong to the 
 
       Coalition of 9/11 Families.  We meet with the 
 
       Medical Examiner's Office every three weeks.  I'll  
 
       give you just a couple of quick figures here. 
 
       Between Shanksville of course, Pennsylvania, and 
 
       the Pentagon, we know that some 3,000 lives were 
 
       taken that day.  At the World Trade Center site,

       2,792 souls were murdered that day, 19,934 body 
 
       parts were retrieved in nine months. 
 
        <p>To date, 6,438 of those remains have been 
 
       identified.  To date, 13,447 of those remains still 
 
       are unidentified and remain at the Medical

       Examiner's Office.  Fourteen hundred and seveny seven families have been 
 
       notified that their loved ones were found.  1,312 
 
       have not.  Out of 2,792 souls lost at the World 
 
       Trade Center, there were only 292 whole bodies. 
 
       There will never be any more than 292 whole bodies.

       My son was one of those whole bodies. 
 
        <p>One night after all the recovery work was 
 
       over, I was at the site, six stories below grade at 
 
       bedrock, for a small tribute.  There were many of 
 
       them.  Afterwards, as I was ready to leave, I

       realized that no one was working.  As I started to 
 
       walk that long walk to the ramp that led out to 
 
       street level, a Port Authority cop that I know  
 
       drove by and said, "Would you like a ride up the 
 
       hill?"  I said, "No, I think I would like to walk." 
 
       He understood and he left. 
 
        <p>I had never been down there where there

       was this fire.  I walked over to where they found 
 
       my son.  I cannot describe the overwhelming feeling 
 
       of warmth and sadness as I stood there.  And I 
 
       could hear people talking.  It was a very powerful 
 
       feeling.  Now I guess I'm going to try to help you

       hear those voices too. 
 
        <p>We cannot change what happened on 
 
       September 11th, but it must not be forgotten and it 
 
       must never happen again.  America's guardians 
 
       failed us on 9/11.  You are now the guardians of

       that legacy of that horrible day.  Each of you 
 
       personally, not merely as a member of a commission, 
 
       now bear responsibility to see that the lessons you 
 
       learn at these hearings are remembered, and more 
 
       importantly, acted on.

        <p>I urge you not to fail the past or the 
 
       future.  And I thank you for the time. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.   
 
       Colonel Birdwell? 
 
        <p>COLONEL BIRDWELL:  Good morning, Governor 
 
       Kean, members of the Commission.  Thank you for 
 
       affording me this opportunity to share with you my

       experiences from the events of September 11th. 
 
       It's also my distinct honor to be a representative 
 
       of those in our national defense, the Pentagon and 
 
       those currently serving overseas right now. 
 
        <p>First let me establish where I was located

       inside the Pentagon at the moment of impact of 
 
       American Airlines Flight 77.  You have a slide 
 
       inside your packet that I provided that gives you 
 
       that layout.  Inside the attached slide, you'll see 
 
       the impact point on the E-ring, the outermost ring

       of the building.  To the left of the collapsed 
 
       structure, my office window is circled in yellow. 
 
        <p>The top right-hand portion of the slide is 
 
       called the corridor.  The corridors are the spokes 
 
       of the building that connect the rings to one

       another.  The rectangular tan box designated with a 
 
       red X at the top of the building shows the location 
 
       of the elevators within the corridor.  
 
        <p>As I stepped out of the men's restroom 
 
       inside corridor 4 on the second floor to return to 
 
       my office, I was passing in front of those 
 
       elevators at the moment of impact, in fact moving

       toward the point of impact.  The arrow originating 
 
       from my circled office window indicates the window 
 
       I was facing at the time of impact, approximately 
 
       15 to 20 yards behind that window inside the 
 
       corridor.

        <p>As you can see from the slide, I had just 
 
       crossed the path of the plane in going to the 
 
       restroom and was just seconds from being in the 
 
       direct path of the plane at the time of the impact. 
 
       When an 80-ton airliner traveling at over 300 miles

       an hour with over 10,000 gallons of petroleum jet-A 
 
       slams into a building 15 to 20 yards from you, 
 
       you may also discern that I sit here at the 
 
       miraculous hand of Christ. 
 
        <p>In surviving the concussion and being

       conscious through it, the blast, the fire, the 
 
       smoke, I am able to provide for you a glimpse of 
 
       the ghastly, firey death that many died in that  
 
       day.  By virtue of surviving my injuries, I can 
 
       provide you the great detail of the emotional and 
 
       physical trauma of the critically injured. 
 
        <p>As a husband and father, I can share with

       you the physical and emotional strain of my wife 
 
       Mel and my son Matt as I experienced throughout my 
 
       hospitalization and continued recovery.  Let me 
 
       share with you a little bit of that experience of 
 
       my wife.

        <p>I too would offer the same thing that Lee 
 
       offered as well, to the family members in the room 
 
       today.  At the moment of impact I went, in an 
 
       instant, from a well-lit corridor that I had 
 
       traversed many times to an earthly hell of fire,

       choking black smoke, physical and emotional pain 
 
       and the disorientation, all of which seemed to last 
 
       an eternity. 
 
        <p>First was the physical pain of the fire. 
 
       My body was burned with 60 to 65 percent total body

       surface burn area on my back, legs, face, neck, 
 
       arms, hands, with approximately 40 percent of my 
 
       burns being third degree.  Portions of my face and  
 
       each entire arm required complete grafting of skin 
 
       from those portions of my body that could donate 
 
       such skin.  The heat, smoke and fuel vapor within 
 
       my lungs inflicted a serious inhalation injury on

       me, as well.  Second, I was disoriented and unable 
 
       to navigate my way out of the building due to the 
 
       loss of lighting, combined with the smoke that was 
 
       pouring out of the building. 
 
        <p>I cannot put into words, there are none

       sufficient in the English language, to describe for 
 
       you the abject terror and panic that I experienced, 
 
       not only facing such grievous, life-threatening 
 
       injuries, but at the same time the inability to 
 
       escape them.  Third, I knew I was facing the

       finality of my life.  I thought about how I had 
 
       said good-bye to my wife Mel that morning, and my 
 
       son Matt, and how it would be my last. 
 
        <p>In moments immediately after impact, I 
 
       reacted normally with the survival instincts of

       trying to save myself.  I attempted to get to my 
 
       feet but was unable to do so, given the concussion 
 
       and blast of the explosion and the subsequent  
 
       vacuum that had to be filled and the damage that 
 
       had on my sense of balance.  After an undetermined 
 
       amount of time, I eventually accepted my death and 
 
       collapsed to the floor and waited for whatever that

       feeling is of the soul departing your body.  By 
 
       God's grace, I never felt that feeling. 
 
        <p>Instead, I could feel liquid running down 
 
       my face, but it wasn't blood, it was cold.  In fact 
 
       it was water.  I had collapsed into one of the

       functioning sprinkler systems inside the Pentagon. 
 
       That water was able to douse the flames on and 
 
       around me and I was eventually evacuated for 
 
       treatment at Georgetown University Hospital. 
 
        <p>In my written remarks, I wanted to pause

       and move on in the interests of time, but let me 
 
       share just a little bit of that with you, if I may, 
 
       Governor.  With your permission, let me just share 
 
       that with you. 
 
        <p>Inside corridor 4 on the second floor,

       there are portions that were still under 
 
       renovation, portions that were, on my right side, 
 
       that were plywooded up, still under construction.   
 
       Portions on my left were badge-access doors that, 
 
       even though my badge was burned beyond recognition 
 
       at that point, even if it had functioned, I did not 
 
       have access to those areas.  The corridor to the

       A-ring, which is the innermost circle, the 
 
       innermost ring of the Pentagon, the fire doors had 
 
       already closed.  I was only operating with 
 
       emergency lights and the will to survive and God's 
 
       grace am I still being alive.

        <p>As I moved, actually staggered, it was not 
 
       a walk, it was not calm, I was not able to run, I 
 
       got down to about B-ring where Bill McKennan and 
 
       Roy Wallace stepped out of the B-ring doors to see if 
 
       there were any survivors inside the hallway.  I was

       the only one there.  Pieces of my skin were still 
 
       hanging off of me, pants burned, portions of my 
 
       polyester pants had melted to me.  It's not a 
 
       description I wish to go into in greater detail 
 
       because Roy was already rather descriptive of it

       for me already. 
 
        <p>They and two other gentlemen carried me to 
 
       the A-ring through one of the passages that they  
 
       had within their area, took me to Redskins Snack 
 
       Bar.  You may be familiar with that, Secretary 
 
       Lehman.  At that point I was laid down for triage 
 
       with five other seriously injured people.  I was

       the first one evacuated. 
 
        <p>Fortunately, I had a great Air Force 
 
       doctor, Dr. Baxter, give me a shot of morphine in 
 
       my foot and then in the other foot gave me the IV 
 
       bag.  My feet were the only portion of my body that

       they could determine was not seriously injured.  I 
 
       was immediately evacuated by ambulance inside the 
 
       Pentagon up to North Parking, from North Parking 
 
       taken to Georgetown University Hospital by a Ford 
 
       Expedition.

        <p>Inside Georgetown University, I had yet 
 
       another seminal moment.  Major John Collison had 
 
       accompanied me to Georgetown.  I knew that when Dr. 
 
       Williams, the attending physician there, told me 
 
       they were soon to place me under general anesthesia

       and intubate me that he was going to do the best he 
 
       could to save my life. But I also knew that I was 
 
       facing, in being under anesthesia, that my last  
 
       words were maybe those that I now speak. 
 
        <p>I asked John to take the wedding ring off 
 
       my finger.  It removed skin, it removed muscle, it 
 
       removed other tissue, but I don't recall it

       hurting.  I don't know if that was because of the 
 
       morphine that I received from Dr. Baxter or because 
 
       I was more concerned with the manner of my death 
 
       and how my life or my death was going to give 
 
       witness to those on the medical staff.

        <p>John took the ring off.  I looked at the 
 
       hospital chaplain and asked to say a prayer, a 
 
       prayer of salvation, actually, rather, sovereignty 
 
       of God in my life, not of salvation.  We said that 
 
       prayer.  And after that prayer I had the peace of

       God's concern in my life and his sovereignty in my 
 
       life to look at Dr. Williams and say, let's get on 
 
       with it, resting in his sovereignty. 
 
        <p>I was fortunate, as you can imagine, to be 
 
       sitting here with you today.  I was evacuated to

       Washington Hospital Center Burn Unit by ambulance, 
 
       or by air ambulance, after the FAA had opened air 
 
       space inside Washington D.C.  That evening I was  
 
       admitted where I would spend the next three-plus 
 
       months enduring 30 surgeries, 24 days on a 
 
       respirator, 26 days in intensive care, nearly 90 
 
       days breathing through a trache, numerous tank

       sessions of sterile debridement in a solution of 
 
       water, iodine and chlorine -- and I can tell you 
 
       that is, short of being a prisoner of war, probably 
 
       the most horrific, painful experience you can 
 
       endure -- three days of maggots to eat the dead

       tissue off my arms, to sterilize the infection, to 
 
       give me live tissue, living tissue, that the 
 
       doctors could then graft on top of, daily physical 
 
       therapy to the point of requiring a morphine 
 
       derivative, Dilaudid, prior to each session, in

       addition to the scheduled pain medications. 
 
        <p>The physical environment was agonizing, 
 
       but the emotional pain was probably far worse. 
 
       Seeing the anguish my wife was enduring on my 
 
       behalf, the separation she endured from Matt and to

       complicate that emotional pain was my inability to 
 
       communicate with her for a good portion of my 
 
       hospitalization, and that physical incapacitation  
 
       combined with the pain medications that I was 
 
       receiving. 
 
        <p>Mel and Matt had already overcome the 
 
       immediate torment of those first few moments and

       hours of watching the attacks.  Mel had previously 
 
       accompanied me to my office when we made the move 
 
       from one part of the building to the other.  She 
 
       knew that my office overlooked the helipad and in 
 
       watching the local news coverage, saw the helipad

       and the row of windows overlooking it with fire 
 
       coming out of them. 
 
        <p>Mel and Matt eventually learned that I was 
 
       alive and were quite overjoyed at that.  The 
 
       greatest challenges ahead were dealing with the

       medical setbacks that are indicative of not knowing 
 
       if I would survive.  In our visits together, 
 
       especially Matt's, the overtone was always, is this 
 
       my last chance to speak with Dad alive. 
 
        <p>By virtue of the hand of the Lord, an

       outstanding group of medical professionals, the 
 
       presence of my church and the presence of the U.S. 
 
       Army family, I sit here before you enjoying the  
 
       remainder of my life.  I trust that you will keep 
 
       my life and those of other citizens of this great 
 
       nation in mind as you go about the business of 
 
       determining how we can improve our processes to

       combat terrorism. 
 
        <p>I look forward to answering any questions 
 
       that you may have about my family's experience. 
 
       Again, thank you for the honor to be here with you 
 
       today.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Mr. Sincock? 
 
        <p>DR. SINCOCK:  Mr. Chairman, Commissioners, 
 
       I'm Dr. Craig Sincock of Woodbridge, Virginia.  To 
 
       me, it is an honor to come to you today as a 
 
       citizen, an Army officer of 34 years, and as a

       surviving spouse of September 11, 2001. 
 
        <p>Before I proceed into the things that I 
 
       had written down, this gentleman right beside me, 
 
       Brian Birdwell, is the only survivor out of my 
 
       wife's office.  He is now my dearest friend.  He's

       like a brother to me. 
 
        <p>The Pentagon was my building and it was my 
 
       wife's building too, my wife, Cheryle.  I was first  
 
       stationed there in 1985, brand new W-2 with the 
 
       Army.  My wife came in 1987, working as an Army 
 
       civil servant.  Both of us went to work there, 
 
       usually together, from those years until the events

       of 9/11.  I worked in just about every corridor and 
 
       most of the floors of that building.  I met 
 
       countless thousands of people, both military and 
 
       civilian.  Most of those people I consider as 
 
       friends.

        <p>My wife made several promotions through 
 
       the years as an Army civil servant.  She was 
 
       excited about where she worked, who she worked for, 
 
       and the fact that she was doing her small part to 
 
       make the system work better.

        <p>On the day her world ended, Cheryle got up 
 
       at 3:00 a.m., got dressed, and drove herself to 
 
       work at 4:30.  My last recollection of her was 
 
       standing in our bedroom combing her hair.  We said 
 
       good-bye and I told her I would call her later to

       see if she wanted to come home early.  This was one 
 
       of those days when her illnesses made her very 
 
       sick, but being sick never stopped her from work,  
 
       from her duty. 
 
        <p>I followed her to work about a half hour 
 
       later.  This was our normal schedule for almost 15 
 
       years.  And although I was on leave, I went to work

       anyway.  The belief was, year-end use-or-lose type 
 
       of leave in the military, but that did not mean I 
 
       did not do my job.  And I credit my wife, Cheryle, 
 
       with showing me that side of the work ethic. 
 
        <p>I called Cheryle at about 8:30.  She

       sounded like she was hurting.  In fact, she told me 
 
       her head was just pounding.  That meant usually 
 
       that her blood pressure was elevated, but true to 
 
       her form, she said no to going home at that time. 
 
       I told her I had been invited to participate in a

       meeting in Rosslyn and I should be back in the 
 
       early afternoon.  That was the last time I talked 
 
       to my wife.  I know I told her I loved her and for 
 
       that I'm ever so grateful. 
 
        <p>When the plane hit the Pentagon an hour

       later, I felt the shudder two miles away in 
 
       Rosslyn.  When I looked out the window and saw the 
 
       first plume of smoke go up, I simultaneously heard  
 
       the TV announcer in a back room say that the south 
 
       parking lot of the Pentagon had been hit by an 
 
       airplane. 
 
        <p>My heart stopped because I just knew that

       was where Cheryle worked and something told me she 
 
       was in danger.  I ran the two miles back to the 
 
       Pentagon, through Arlington Cemetery.  I spent that 
 
       entire day, until 11:30 that night, working, 
 
       praying, and hoping at the side of the building we

       called home.  It was not until the next morning 
 
       that I got the official word from the Army that my 
 
       wife Cheryle, my bride of almost 25 years, was on 
 
       the missing list. 
 
        <p>That is what happened to Cheryle and 183

       others that day.  What has happened to the families 
 
       and friends since that day is another story.  I 
 
       like to think of 9/11 as an event and what we do 
 
       now as the journey after the event.  Every once in 
 
       awhile, someone or something will take us back to

       that day.  Those are the triggers from the event. 
 
       We hope that as time goes by, the triggers become 
 
       less in frequency and their results less in depth.  
 
        <p>This is the reason I said yes to coming 
 
       before you today.  What you do here, the results 
 
       you obtain and the recommendations you send 
 
       forward, will, I sincerely hope, lessen those

       triggers for all of us. 
 
        <p>I found early on in my grieving process 
 
       that to hold onto anger brought on resentment.  And 
 
       with resentment came sleepless nights, foggy days, 
 
       and bad memories.  So you won't hear anger from me.

       I won't talk about what people should have done, 
 
       for that would be to try to place blame somewhere. 
 
       That may be part of what you end up doing, but it 
 
       is not part of my responsibility. 
 
        <p>I will however, give you some personal

       observations. 
 
        <p>I watched that day as everyone with any 
 
       authority tried to take charge of something, take 
 
       charge of anything, but no one was really in 
 
       charge.  No matter how many times the scenario of a

       plane crashing into the Pentagon during takeoff or 
 
       landing at National Airport had been practiced, 
 
       no one was prepared for this attack.  
 
        <p>I know many of these in the Defense Protective 
 
       Service and there's not one of them that I would 
 
       fault for not doing their job and then some that 
 
       day.  I know many of the building support personnel

       and they too are above reproach and blame.  I've 
 
       worked for many of the top-level and mid-level 
 
       managers of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine 
 
       Corps.  Each one of them and their subordinates did 
 
       what their training and their instincts directed

       them to do.  Some of them died trying. 
 
        <p>If there is anything to blame, it is our 
 
       systems, our bureaucracies and our inflexibility 
 
       towards change.  That is normal for bureaucracies 
 
       and large systems.  That is what happened on 9/11.

       Those who are used to change, are trained to 
 
       respond to events demanding instant change, are the 
 
       police, fire and rescue.  Bureaucrats do not like 
 
       change, in fact they fear it, for their programs 
 
       may go away and with it their very existence.

        <p>So when these same bureaucrats tried to 
 
       respond to 9/11 events, they were not prepared for 
 
       it, but we should not blame them for that because  
 
       we may have made them what they are.  We do this 
 
       with our antiquated programming, budgeting and 
 
       execution methods.  We do this by outsourcing 
 
       almost everything we do until we make our

       government managers policy makers rather than 
 
       decision makers. 
 
        <p>We cannot fault our fine nonprofit 
 
       organizations and the multitude of companies that 
 
       responded to the needs starting within many hours

       of the tragedy.  These people brought everything 
 
       they could think of, provided every service they 
 
       could, and extended themselves, usually at a loss 
 
       of profit.  But within months of the event, the 
 
       attitude of these same people, not all of them to

       be sure, but a lot of them, went back to the way 
 
       they had been before 9/11.  They did what so many 
 
       of our own citizens did.  They reverted to what was 
 
       comfortable and known.  This is one of the prime 
 
       laws of systems thinking, which I happen to have a

       doctorate in, that tells us that a system always 
 
       reverts to where it is comfortable.  That's where 
 
       bureaucracies go, back to being comfortable.  
 
        <p>Some of the organizations that responded 
 
       had gone through similar incidents and responses 
 
       like this before.  Some of them already had 
 
       response models they could modify quickly.  But the

       vast majority of responders did not have a clue 
 
       because this was so much bigger, so much different 
 
       than anything they had ever seen before.  And now 
 
       almost a year and a half has gone by and we still 
 
       don't have any more models of crisis response than

       we had before. 
 
        <p>I'm certain that some bureaucrats have 
 
       probably worked on a few of those and spent several millions 
 
       of dollars of public funds to try to get a model 
 
       going, but I suspect that when push comes to shove,

       God forbid, those models will have become 
 
       shelfware.  For until our bureaucracies start to 
 
       train themselves on how to change, on how to be 
 
       flexible and pliable, they will never be in a 
 
       position to respond properly to events such as

       9/11. 
 
        <p>I trust that what you do here will be 
 
       guided by finding answers, not placing blame.  I  
 
       trust that you will search out the truth, no matter 
 
       where it leads, and pass that truth to those who 
 
       can make changes that matter.  I trust that you 
 
       will do the next right thing.

        <p>As you call your witnesses and try to find 
 
       out what happened and why, please try to remember 
 
       that those who were at the sites that day, those 
 
       who lost loved ones and friends, those who were 
 
       injured, are still going through their private and

       individualized trauma and grief processes.  Some 
 
       may be angry, many may be depressed, some may be 
 
       distraught and others may have their own agendas. 
 
       Try to understand that each of these people will 
 
       try to do their best given the circumstances that

       befell them. 
 
        <p>You are now part of their healing process. 
 
       I know you will do right by them and right by our 
 
       great country, the United States of America. 
 
        <p>Thank you once again for the honor of

       being here, and God bless. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you all very much. 
 
       You're an extraordinary group of people.  And I  
 
       thank you all so much for being here today. 
 
       Senator Gorton has a question. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  Mr. Waizer, was 
 
       there anyone else on that elevator?

        <p>MR. WAIZER:  There was another woman, a 
 
       black, middle-aged woman, who I have tried to 
 
       identify.  I think I know who she was.  And if it's 
 
       who I think it was, she died in the hospital.  She 
 
       didn't make it down to another ambulance.  But I

       have never be able to confirm that. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  I was going to have 
 
       a question for Mr. Lim, Mr. Chairman, but he 
 
       answered it.  He went back to work.  And I just 
 
       wanted to say that that was a great thing to do.

       You really deserve our admiration, not only for 
 
       what you did on that day but you're back to work 
 
       right now. 
 
        <p>MR. LIM:  There's a great need for 
 
       bomb-dog handlers right now.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you.  Any other 
 
       questions from the Commission? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  I'd just like to  
 
       make a comment.  When we were deciding what to do 
 
       for our first hearing, we considered many different 
 
       alternatives.  And clearly we wanted to hear from 
 
       the families of the victims.  We also wanted to

       hear firsthand from people who had experienced the 
 
       tragedy themselves for two reasons. One, we knew it 
 
       would motivate us.  And it has.  We will 
 
       collectively keep your stories with us as we go on 
 
       this journey.  And two, you have given us some

       challenges to live up to.  As you said, you are 
 
       speaking for so many others.  And we have heard 
 
       you.  Thank you. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Yes, Senator? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND:  Mr. Chairman, come

       April 8th, I will celebrate 35 years after my 
 
       tremendous trauma and challenges, grieving all 
 
       that, physical loss and pain and suffering. 
 
        <p>And this is an extraordinary story.  The 
 
       nation needed to hear it.  We needed to hear it.

       We love you.  We appreciate you.  And we hope that 
 
       God continues to strengthen you in your struggle. 
 
       Thank you.  
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.  The 
 
       next panel, Stephen Push, Mary Fetchet, Mindy 
 
       Kleinberg, Allison Vadhan. 
 
        <p>(Recess)

<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  We will call the session 
 
       back to order.  I'd like to introduce, first of 
 
       all, Stephen Push from the Families of September 
 
       11. 
 
        <p>MR. PUSH:  Governor Kean, Congressman

       Hamilton, and the other members of the Commission, 
 
       thank you for inviting me to offer my views about 
 
       the Commission as it starts its investigation of 
 
       the worst terrorist attack in American history. 
 
       And thank you all for taking on this assignment.

       You're doing a tremendous service for your country. 
 
        <p>You have an extremely important task 
 
       before you.  What is at stake is nothing less than 
 
       the legitimacy of the United States government. 
 
       The primary function of government is to provide

       for the common defense.  If the government cannot 
 
       do that effectively, everything else it does is of 
 
       little value.  
 
        <p>I would like to explain to you what it was 
 
       that brought me before you today.  I don't claim to 
 
       speak for all the 9/11 families, but I believe that 
 
       many of them have similar views concerning the need

       for this Commission. 
 
        <p>When my wife, Lisa Raines, was murdered 
 
       aboard American Airlines Flight 77, I was 
 
       immediately cast into a spiral of shock, disbelief, 
 
       and grief.  Within two weeks, however, my strongest

       emotion was anger.  And I think I probably differ 
 
       substantially from Mr. Waizer and Dr. Sincock in 
 
       that.  In fact, actually, anger is an inadequate 
 
       word to describe what I felt.  What I felt was a 
 
       rage so intense it was like no emotion I had ever

       felt before.  But I haven't let go of this anger. 
 
       I've tried to pour it into working to see that 
 
       something like this never happens again. 
 
        <p>Initially my rage was directed at the 
 
       hijackers.  Why did they do this?  What did they

       expect to accomplish?  What had Lisa done to them? 
 
       But as I read the newspapers and spent night after 
 
       sleepless night watching cable news networks and  
 
       searching books and the Web for information about 
 
       terrorism, I also became angry at my government, 
 
       the government that was supposed to protect Lisa 
 
       but that, as I eventually learned, had failed her

       and the other 3,000-plus victims of 9/11. 
 
        <p>I learned, for instance, that two of the 
 
       hijackers on Lisa's plane were known to the CIA. 
 
       In fact, the CIA even knew that one of them had a 
 
       multiple-entry visa to come into the country.  They

       knew that they were associated, I found out a 
 
       little later on that they were associated with the 
 
       people who bombed the Cole, the USS Cole, knew that 
 
       they had attended a terrorism conference in Kuala 
 
       Lumpur.  Nevertheless, they were allowed to enter

       the country, to live here for months and to board 
 
       the plane using their own names. 
 
        <p>I also learned that, for 14 years prior to 
 
       9/11, the Government Accounting Office repeatedly 
 
       documented the ineffectiveness of the aviation

       security system, but during that 14-year period, 
 
       nothing was done to correct the problems. 
 
        <p>I realized that al Qaeda had first  
 
       attacked America in 1993, declared war on America a 
 
       few years later, and mounted a series of 
 
       increasingly daring and deadly attacks.  While all 
 
       of this was happening, the Clinton administration

       took only ineffectual steps against al Qaeda.  And 
 
       after all of these clear signs that we were at war 
 
       with a ruthless enemy, the new Bush administration 
 
       put counterterrorism on the back burner until 
 
       September 11th.

        <p>I am now convinced that this tragedy did 
 
       not have to happen.  9/11 was foreseeable.  And it 
 
       could have been prevented.  But even if you don't 
 
       accept my word on that, I think everyone must admit 
 
       that at the very least 9/11 exposed serious

       problems with our counterterrorism and 
 
       national-security procedures. 
 
        <p>I'm not advocating conspiracy theories.  I 
 
       personally don't believe that anyone in the 
 
       government had specific knowledge of what would

       happen on 9/11.  If only it were that simple, we 
 
       could then easily correct the problem by 
 
       investigating and punishing those responsible.  
 
        <p>But I fear that what we're up against is 
 
       far more insidious.  There has been a failure of 
 
       leadership in this country that cuts across decades 
 
       and political parties.  Too many politicians put

       reelection above national security.  Too many 
 
       government managers favor process over results and 
 
       careerism over service. 
 
        <p>I'm not maligning the many brave men and 
 
       women who protect us.  I have great respect and

       gratitude to those in the military and the 
 
       intelligence agencies and for the many others who 
 
       have dedicated their lives to public service, but 
 
       in too many cases, they have been poorly led. 
 
        <p>I'd like to make a comment about something

       that Mr. Ben-Veniste and one of the witnesses said 
 
       about not pointing fingers.  I think this 
 
       Commission should point fingers.  I'm not 
 
       suggesting that you find scapegoats, someone to 
 
       hang out to dry, but there were people, people in

       responsible positions, who failed us on 9/11.  They 
 
       didn't just fail us once;  9/11 occurred because 
 
       they were failing us over a long period of time.   
 
       Some of these people are still in responsible 
 
       positions in the government.  Perhaps they 
 
       shouldn't be.  And that's one of the things I think 
 
       you need to look at and think about.

        <p>I also hope that you will, in conducting 
 
       your investigation, talk to some of the rank and 
 
       file in the agencies that you will be looking at. 
 
       I notice that you have some people from the Fire 
 
       Department and the Police Department speaking

       tomorrow.  I don't know what level they're at, but 
 
       you should speak to some of the rank and file in 
 
       those departments and see if what the leaders
 
       are telling you squares with what the rank and file 
 
       are telling you.

        <p>The same goes for the federal agencies. 
 
       I'm in touch with a number of former and current 
 
       employees of the Federal Aviation Administration 
 
       and the new Transportation Security Administration 
 
       who have horror stories to tell about our aviation

       security.  And I'd like you to listen to them. 
 
       Maybe not everything they say is legitimate, but 
 
       there is a lot there for you to look at that  
 
       requires serious consideration. 
 
        <p>I'd also like to say something about what 
 
       Mr. Waizer said about these commissions coming to 
 
       naught in the end.  If I have anything to say about

       it, that's not going to happen.  Your report is not 
 
       the end of the process, it's the beginning. 
 
        <p>And I think I can speak for some of the 
 
       other families who are here today, we're not going 
 
       away.  We're going to see that your recommendations

       are translated into legislation, that the 
 
       legislation is translated into effective action by 
 
       the agencies. 
 
        <p>Since 9/11, there have been some important 
 
       successes in the war on terrorism.  Afghanistan has

       been liberated, al Qaeda has been disrupted, and 
 
       many of al Qaeda's leaders have been captured. 
 
        <p>But there have been far too many failures, 
 
       as well.  For example, despite the expensive and 
 
       highly publicized creation of the Transportation

       Security Administration, aviation security is still 
 
       little better than it was on 9/11. 
 
        <p>Just last month, an investigative  
 
       journalist was able to defeat the carry-on-bag 
 
       screening process at a major American airport 10 
 
       out of 10 times.  This is a year and a half after 
 
       9/11, months after the TSA has taken over

       responsibility for all the airports, an 
 
       investigative journalist can carry unallowed items 
 
       through security a hundred percent of the time at a 
 
       major American airport. 
 
        <p>And this is not just one incident.  I just

       mentioned this one because it happened long after 
 
       TSA had taken over.  But I just this weekend 
 
       watched a compilation tape of stories that were 
 
       done by national and local television stations over 
 
       the period starting before 9/11 and continuing

       throughout the period when TSA was training and 
 
       hiring and taking over, right up until last month. 
 
       And in every single one of those instances, they 
 
       were able to defeat the system between 50 and 100 
 
       percent of the time.  I will provide you with a

       copy of that tape.  It's sickening. 
 
        <p>The TSA's response to this latest story, 
 
       to this latest appalling failure rate, was to  
 
       assert that "proper screening procedures were 
 
       followed."  I'm sure the families of the next 
 
       hijack victims will take great comfort in knowing 
 
       that "procedures were followed."

        <p>These ineffectual reforms of 
 
       transportation security focus almost exclusively on 
 
       addressing past attacks.  And this seems to be a 
 
       recurring theme in the government.  Let's respond 
 
       to the last attack.  Richard Reid uses a shoe bomb,

       so let's check everybody's shoes.  Well, the 
 
       terrorists are probably a little smarter than that 
 
       and probably the next time it's not going to be 
 
       shoes. 
 
        <p>But most of what's been done by the TSA so

       far responds to the threats that became evident on 
 
       9/11 and the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie. 
 
       Little has been done to address other 
 
       aviation-security issues, and these issues are well 
 
       known.  Little has been done to address threats to

       other modes of transportation. 
 
        <p>We have to do much more than prevent a 
 
       repeat of prior terrorist attacks.  We need people  
 
       in government who know how to anticipate new 
 
       tactics and develop methods to defeat them.  Even 
 
       more important, we need to understand and change 
 
       the causes of terrorism.  This will require a major

       change in the government's mindset. 
 
        <p>I urge you to look beyond al Qaeda and 
 
       beyond 9/11 and examine the underlying problems 
 
       that this country has not fully faced and has done 
 
       little to address.  I urge you to ask the tough

       questions and offer tough solutions. 
 
        <p>For example, what changes need to be made 
 
       in our foreign policy, including -- no, not 
 
       including -- especially in our relations with 
 
       so-called friends such as Saudi Arabia?

        <p>Does the new Department of Homeland 
 
       Security really make America safer or has the 
 
       government just reshuffled the boxes on the 
 
       organizational chart? 
 
        <p>Can we obtain useful counterterrorism

       intelligence from an intelligence community made up 
 
       of 14 different agencies when no one is in charge 
 
       of the entire operation?  
 
        <p>Can the FBI, an agency steeped in a 
 
       law-enforcement culture transform itself into a 
 
       counterterrorism agency, or do we need to create an 
 
       agency similar to Britain's MI-5?

        <p>Are political campaign contributions from 
 
       the airlines undermining Congressional oversight of 
 
       aviation security? 
 
        <p>These are just a few of the questions you 
 
       are going to need to answer.  The list of questions

       is too long for this brief testimony.  I know that 
 
       other 9/11 families and many other people have 
 
       provided you or can provide you with far more 
 
       comprehensive lists. 
 
        <p>The families, the 9/11 families, aren't

       asking these questions for our own benefit.  We 
 
       have already been irreparably damaged.  Our loved 
 
       ones have already paid the ultimate price.  We ask 
 
       these questions for all Americans, for all people 
 
       who may be the next victims of terrorism, for

       future generations. 
 
        <p>Thank you again for inviting me to 
 
       testify.  And good luck in your search for the  
 
       truth. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you.  Mary Fetchet, 
 
       who is from Voices of 9/11. 
 
        <p>MS. FETCHET:  Good afternoon.  My name is

       Mary Fetchet.  I tragically lost my son Brad in the 
 
       most devastating attack on our country, the attacks 
 
       on the World Trade Center.  I am Co-Chair of Voices 
 
       of September 11th and a member of the family 
 
       steering committee for the 9/11 Independent

       Commission.  I'm honored to be here today and want 
 
       to thank Governor Kean, Mr. Hamilton, and all the 
 
       commissioners for the opportunity to discuss my 
 
       expectations for the 9/11 Commission. 
 
        <p>I want to express to all of you my very

       deep concern about the slow progress of the 
 
       Commission and stress the urgency we feel as 
 
       precious time is being wasted.  I also want to 
 
       impress on you the importance of the Commission's 
 
       investigation in answering our mounting questions.

        <p>Your investigation will help identify the 
 
       systemic problems within and amongst government 
 
       agencies that contributed to the success of the  
 
       terrorists in carrying out this horrific attack on 
 
       our country. 
 
        <p>It will also set a framework for the 
 
       necessary changes to insure national security.  The

       responsibility of the success of this investigation 
 
       rests on your shoulders.  We have waited far too 
 
       long for this Commission to get up and running. 
 
        <p>As a mother who lost her child, it is my 
 
       moral obligation to speak on behalf of my son and

       all those that died on September 11th.  They 
 
       deserve answers to how and why they were 
 
       senselessly murdered in their own country, nearly 
 
       3,000 innocent citizens at work and traveling on 
 
       American aircraft.  I also speak on behalf of my

       family and other families who are searching for 
 
       answers to how and why their loved ones died on 
 
       September 11th.  We deserve answers to the long 
 
       list of questions we have. 
 
        <p>Most importantly, I am here as a citizen,

       like you and the rest of the nation, who continues 
 
       to feel unprotected at these volatile times.  For 
 
       the sake of our children, we feel a great sense of  
 
       urgency.  What were the failures?  Who was 
 
       accountable? 
 
        <p>As I speak about my son, I would like to 
 
       share with you a picture which I took this morning

       from his 15-year-old brother's bedroom.  Brad was 
 
       24 years' old and the oldest of our three sons.  He 
 
       worked at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods as an equity 
 
       trader on the 89th floor of Tower 2.  Brad was an 
 
       understated, athletic, handsome young man, as you

       can see from the picture, with a sparkle in his 
 
       eyes and a wonderful smile.  Much like the 3,000 
 
       other innocent victims, he was hard working and 
 
       dedicated to his family and friends. 
 
        <p>Brad was planning to become engaged to his

       girlfriend of three years, Brooke.  When Brad died, 
 
       my husband and I lost a son and our dreams for his 
 
       future, a wedding, a daughter-in-law and 
 
       grandchildren.  His younger brothers have lost a 
 
       friend, a coach, a mentor, a confidant and a

       companion. 
 
        <p>It is incomprehensible that the 
 
       devastation was so great that our families are  
 
       being notified of minute body parts, such as a 
 
       finger, a jaw or a vertebra, or worse, nothing at 
 
       all.  We have been notified three times of Brad's 
 
       limited remains and have had a memorial service and

       a burial.  We will wait until the notification 
 
       process ends before we have a final burial.  It may 
 
       continue for years. 
 
        <p>On September 11th, Brad called my husband 
 
       at work shortly after the first plane hit Tower 1.

       Like other times when there was an emergency in the 
 
       building, he wanted to reassure us that he was 
 
       okay.  He was shaken because he had seen someone, 
 
       quote, "drop from the 91st floor, all the way 
 
       down."  He knew a plane hit Tower 1, but wasn't

       aware it was a commercial jet. 
 
        <p>The Port Authority directed my son's 
 
       company to stay put in their office, quote, "that 
 
       the building is safe and secure."  My husband asked 
 
       Brad to call me at home and here's the recording of

       his call left on my message machine at home around 
 
       9 o'clock a.m.: 
 
        <p>"Hey Mom, it's Brad.  I just wanted to  
 
       call and let you know, I'm sure that you've heard, 
 
       or maybe you haven't heard, that a plane crashed 
 
       into World Trade Center One.  We're fine, we're in 
 
       World Trade Center Two.  I'm obviously alive and

       well over here, but it's obviously a pretty scary 
 
       experience.  I saw a guy fall out of probably the 
 
       91st story all the way down.  So you're welcome to 
 
       give a call here.  I think we'll be here all day. 
 
       I'm not sure if the firm is going to shut down for

       the day or what.  Give me a call back later.  I 
 
       called Dad to let him know.  Love you." 
 
        <p>Brad always tried to be strong so I would 
 
       not worry.  Although he wasn't aware his life was 
 
       in danger, I can hear the fear in his voice.  I

       never had the opportunity to return his call, to 
 
       say good-bye and tell him I love him. 
 
        <p>Brad made two calls to his girlfriend, the 
 
       last after the second plane hit Tower 2.  The 
 
       message was brief.  Sirens were sounding in the

       background and he was franticly trying to escape 
 
       the building.  Other families received similar 
 
       calls from their loved ones after the building was  
 
       hit. 
 
        <p>These individuals knew they were going to 
 
       die.  They were trapped above the fire, asphyxiated 
 
       or injured, and unable to escape.  They died a

       horrendous death. 
 
        <p>So I ask you, if the house next door to 
 
       your home was hit by a plane or on fire, would you 
 
       direct your family to remain in your home?  How is 
 
       it that people would be directed to remain in a

       110-story building supposedly, quote, "safe and 
 
       secure," when its twin tower is billowing in smoke, 
 
       and people are jumping to their death to avoid a 
 
       high-rise fire?  How is it is that Brad was unaware 
 
       of the dangerous situation he was in 15 minutes

       after the first plane hit Tower 1?  Precious time 
 
       was wasted. 
 
        <p>Unlike Brad's situation, Rick Rescorla, 
 
       Director of Security for Morgan Stanley, directed 
 
       his employees to leave the building, to disregard

       the Port Authority's commands to evacuees to, 
 
       quote, "return up to their offices." 
 
        <p>How is it that they were receiving such  
 
       conflicting information which ultimately, 
 
       senselessly, cost my son's life and the lives of 
 
       600 others in Building 2?  What lessons were 
 
       learned after the bombing in 1993?  Were there

       evacuation policies in place?  Were they followed? 
 
       No one in Building 2 should be dead today.  What 
 
       were the failures and who is accountable? 
 
        <p>Furthermore, what communications existed 
 
       to warn city authorities and the Port Authority

       that hijacked commercial aircraft appeared headed 
 
       for their targets?  More specifically, what was New 
 
       York City and the Port Authority told about the 
 
       findings of the Joint FBI and NYPD Terrorist Task 
 
       Force?

        <p>What were the breakdowns in communication 
 
       between the control towers, the FAA, NORAD, and 
 
       other government agencies?  On a larger scale, what 
 
       were the CIA, the FBI, the INS and the military 
 
       doing to protect our country?  What were the

       systemic failures?  Who should be held accountable? 
 
        <p>September 11th has repeatedly been 
 
       referred to as a wake-up call.  Our president said  
 
       on September 27, 2001, "We have awakened to a new 
 
       danger, but our resolve is great." As late as May 
 
       16, 2002, Condoleeza Rice stated that, "I don't 
 
       think anybody could have predicted that these

       people would take an airplane and slam it into the 
 
       World Trade Center, take another one and slam it 
 
       into the Pentagon; that they would try to use an 
 
       airplane as a missile, a hijacked airplane as a 
 
       missile."

        <p>But September 11th should not have been a 
 
       wake-up call.  Nor was it a new danger.  September 
 
       11th should have been predictable.  The loss of 
 
       life in the 1993 bombing and the continued threats, 
 
       specifically on the World Trade Center and other

       New York City landmarks, should have been the 
 
       wake-up call. 
 
        <p>In fact, Eleanor Hill from the Joint 
 
       Intelligence Committee concludes, "There was 
 
       considerable historical evidence that international

       terrorists had planned and were, in fact, capable 
 
       of conducting major terrorist strikes within the 
 
       United States."  
 
        <p>Despite increased chatter and the CIA 
 
       Director, George Tenet, issuing a declaration of 
 
       war on al Qaeda on December 4, 1998, the FBI and 
 
       CIA failed to communicate or coordinate their

       efforts in providing national security.  How could 
 
       this be that the two intelligence agencies 
 
       responsible for our safety are not coordinating 
 
       their efforts to protect our citizens?  How could 
 
       this happen and who is accountable?

        <p>The Hart-Rudman Commission released on 
 
       February 2001 also predicted a terrorist attack of 
 
       great magnitude and loss of life on our own soil. 
 
       This report both identified the increasing threat 
 
       of terrorism and was also a blueprint for the

       development of homeland security, which, if 
 
       implemented, could have prevented September 11th. 
 
       However, their recommendations to address these 
 
       threats were never implemented.  The report sat on 
 
       a shelf.

        <p>It is also important to note that two 
 
       earlier presidential commissions on airline safety, 
 
       security and antiterrorism were established  
 
       following airline disasters, the Pan Am Flight 103 
 
       and the TWA Flight 800.  However, these commissions 
 
       were bogged down by lobbying from the aviation 
 
       industry.  Timetables were delayed, and financial

       expenditures were given priority over the safety of 
 
       human lives. 
 
        <p>During this time what steps did the 
 
       aviation community take amidst the growing threat, 
 
       one which centered on using aircraft as bombs and

       American cities as targets?  If an effective 
 
       security system was in place, how did box cutters 
 
       get through security?  What were the failures and 
 
       who is accountable? 
 
        <p>Thankfully, we live in a country with

       freedom of speech.  Yet our elected officials with 
 
       oversight have neglected to implement prior 
 
       commissions' important recommendations to improve 
 
       airline and national security.  We have a strong 
 
       military support, yet they were not able to protect

       us within our own borders. 
 
        <p>We have sophisticated intelligence 
 
       agencies that, for reasons unknown to the public,  
 
       are territorial and have been proven to be 
 
       ineffective, at least as far as protecting American 
 
       lives.  Our nation is technologically advanced, yet 
 
       the technology is not protecting the skyways of

       America. 
 
        <p>Before September 11th, I assumed we were 
 
       safe and secure living in the United States, that 
 
       the threat of terrorism was outside our country, 
 
       that government officials and other agencies were

       competent, responsible individuals, coordinating 
 
       their efforts and acting in our best interests.  I 
 
       found out the hard way that I was naive, that my 
 
       assumptions were wrong. 
 
        <p>Unfortunately, the threat of terrorism

       exists in our country.  The building that Brad 
 
       worked in was unsafe and an identified target.  And 
 
       government agencies with the responsibility to 
 
       protect us have major systemic problems 
 
       communicating.

        <p>For 18 months our family has been denied 
 
       the truth that a thorough investigation would 
 
       reveal.  As a family member, I am frustrated to  
 
       have suffered the loss of a son and yet to be 
 
       required to spend time away from my family and 
 
       fight for the establishment of a commission that 
 
       should have been in place on the day of the tragic

       events. 
 
        <p>Following a recent mining disaster and 
 
       tragic Columbian aircraft explosion, commissions 
 
       were established immediately, with substantial 
 
       funding.  It is now 18 months later.  We're at war

       with heightened alert.  Yet the Commission has had 
 
       a slow start.  A quest for the truth has to begin 
 
       at the top, with the support of the administration, 
 
       to require all government agencies to provide 
 
       necessary documents and act in full cooperation

       with the Commission. 
 
        <p>Security for all Commissioners and staff 
 
       should be expedited.  Necessary funds should be 
 
       allocated for a Commission of this magnitude.  The 
 
       findings of this Commission are of utmost

       importance to developing an effective Homeland 
 
       Security Department. 
 
        <p>I found a journal my son began writing at  
 
       age 21.  On the first page he wrote a quote which 
 
       best describes how he lived his life: "You can tell 
 
       the character of a man by what he does for the man 
 
       who can offer him nothing."

        <p>I challenge you, the Commissioners, the 
 
       staff, and all those involved with the success of 
 
       this Commission to approach this important inquiry 
 
       with the same manner that Brad approached life, to 
 
       approach it with an open mind and with integrity,

       above all, with a sense of urgency and a full 
 
       commitment to the time and energy that will be 
 
       necessary to do a complete and thorough job. 
 
        <p>It is your moral and legal obligation to 
 
       insure that no stone is unturned.  Most

       importantly, each Commissioner must recuse 
 
       themselves in areas that they have a conflict of 
 
       interest.  Our nation deserves this Commission to 
 
       be different.  We want to prevent other families 
 
       from suffering the loss we have had to endure.  We

       want you to answer our questions, identify systemic 
 
       failures, and resolve problems. 
 
        <p>Despite the cost, we want recommendations  
 
       that are implemented and we want accountability. 
 
       We want to know that changes are being made so our 
 
       families can feel safe living in this country. 
 
       Ultimately, you are accountable for the success of

       this Commission. 
 
        <p>In closing, I would like to offer my 
 
       sincerest condolences to the families of the brave 
 
       soldiers who perished in Iraq.  I understand their 
 
       grief.  May God bless my son and all those who died

       as a result of September 11th and may their spirit 
 
       grant you the strength and wisdom as you proceed 
 
       with this important contribution for the sake of 
 
       our nation.  Thank you. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.

       Mindy Kleinberg from September 11th Advocates. 
 
        <p>MS. KLEINBERG:  My name is Mindy 
 
       Kleinberg.  My husband Alan, 39 years old, was 
 
       killed in the World Trade Center on September 11th, 
 
       2001.  As I testify here today about the 9/11

       attacks, I will begin by saying that my thoughts 
 
       are very much with the men and women who are 
 
       involved in armed conflict overseas and their  
 
       families who wait patiently for them to return. 
 
        <p>This war is being fought on two fronts, 
 
       overseas as well as here on our shores.  This means 
 
       that we are all soldiers in this fight against

       terrorism.  As the threat of terrorism mounts here 
 
       in the United States, the need to address the 
 
       failures of September 11th is more important than 
 
       ever.  It is an essential part of lessons learned. 
 
        <p>As such, this commission has an extremely

       important task before it.  I'm here today to ask 
 
       you, the Commissioners, to help us understand how 
 
       this could have happened.  Help us understand where 
 
       the breakdown was in our nation's defense 
 
       capabilities.

        <p>Where we were on the morning of September 
 
       11th.  On the morning of September 11th my 
 
       three-year-old son, Sam, and I walked Jacob, 10, 
 
       and Lauren, seven, to the bus stop at about 8:40 
 
       a.m.  It was the fourth day of a new school year

       and you could still feel everyone's excitement.  It 
 
       was such a beautiful day that Sam and I literally 
 
       skipped home, oblivious to what was happening in  
 
       New York. 
 
        <p>At around 8:55 I was confirming play-date 
 
       plans for Sam when a friend said, "I can't believe 
 
       what I'm watching on TV, a plane has just hit the

       World Trade Center."  For some reason it didn't 
 
       register with me until a few minutes later, I asked 
 
       her calmly, "What building did you say?  Oh, that's 
 
       Alan's building, I have to call you back." 
 
        <p>There was no answer when I tried to reach

       him at the office.  By now my house started filling 
 
       with people -- his mother, my parents, our sisters 
 
       and friends.  The seriousness of the situation was 
 
       beginning to register.  We spent the rest of the 
 
       day calling hospitals and the Red Cross and

       anyplace else we could think of to see if we could 
 
       find him.  I will never forget thinking all day 
 
       long, "How am I going to tell Jacob and Lauren that 
 
       their father was missing?" 
 
        <p>They came home to a house filled with

       people but no Daddy.  How were they going to be 
 
       able to wait calmly for his return?  What if he was 
 
       really hurt?  This was their hero, their king,  
 
       their best friend, their father.  The thoughts of 
 
       that day replay over and over in our heads, always 
 
       wishing for a different outcome. 
 
        <p>We are trying to learn to live with the

       pain.  We will never forget where we were or how we 
 
       felt on September 11th.  But where was our 
 
       government, its agencies and institutions prior to 
 
       and on the morning of September 11th? 
 
        <p>The theory of luck.  With regard to the

       9/11 attacks, it has been said that the 
 
       intelligence agencies have to be right 100 percent 
 
       of the time and the terrorists only have to get 
 
       lucky once.  This explanation for the devastating 
 
       attacks of September 11th, simple on its face, is

       wrong in its value, because the 9/11 terrorists 
 
       were not just lucky once, they were lucky over and 
 
       over again.  Allow me to illustrate. 
 
        <p>The SEC.  The terrorists' lucky streak 
 
       began the week before September 11th with the

       Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  The 
 
       SEC, in concert with the United States intelligence 
 
       agencies, has sophisticated software programs that  
 
       are used in real time to watch both domestic and 
 
       overseas markets to seek out trends that may 
 
       indicate a present or future crime. 
 
        <p>In the week prior to September 11th both

       the SEC and U.S. intelligence agencies ignored one 
 
       major stock-market indicator, one that could have 
 
       yielded valuable information with regard to the 
 
       September 11th attacks.  On the Chicago Board 
 
       Options Exchange during the week before September

       11th, put options were purchased on American and 
 
       United Airlines, the two airlines involved in the 
 
       attacks.  The investors who placed these orders 
 
       were gambling that in the short term, the stock 
 
       prices of both airlines would plummet.

        <p>Never before on the Chicago Exchange were 
 
       such large amounts of United and American Airlines 
 
       options traded.  These investors netted a profit of 
 
       several million dollars after the September 11th 
 
       attacks.  Interestingly, the names of the investors

       remain undisclosed and the millions remain 
 
       unclaimed in the Chicago Exchange account. 
 
        <p>Why were these aberrant trades not  
 
       discovered prior to 9/11?  Who were the individuals 
 
       who placed these trades?  Have they been 
 
       investigated?  Who was responsible for monitoring 
 
       these activities?  Have those individuals been held

       responsible for their inaction? 
 
        <p>The INS.  Prior to 9/11, our United States 
 
       intelligence agencies should have stopped the 19 
 
       terrorists from entering this country for 
 
       intelligence reasons alone.  However, their failure

       to do so in 19 instances does not negate the luck 
 
       involved for the terrorists when it comes to their 
 
       visa applications and our Immigration and 
 
       Naturalization Service, or INS. 
 
        <p>With regard to the INS, the terrorists got

       lucky 15 individual times because 15 of the 19 
 
       hijackers' visas should have been unquestionably 
 
       denied. 
 
        <p>Most of the 19 hijackers were young, 
 
       unmarried, unemployed males.  They were, in short,

       the classic overstay candidates.  A seasoned former 
 
       Consular Officer stated in National Review 
 
       Magazine, "Single, idle young adults with no  
 
       specific destination in the United States rarely 
 
       get visas absent compelling circumstances." 
 
        <p>Yet these 19 young, single, unemployed, 
 
       "classic overstay candidates still received their

       visas."  I am holding in my hand some of the 
 
       applications of the terrorists who killed my 
 
       husband.  All of these forms are incomplete and 
 
       incorrect. 
 
        <p>Some of the terrorists listed their means

       of support as simply "student" failing to then list 
 
       the name and address of any school or institution. 
 
       Others, when asked about their means of support for 
 
       their stay in the United States wrote "myself" and 
 
       provided no further documentation.  Some of the

       terrorists listed their destination as simply 
 
       "hotel" or "California" or "New York".  One even 
 
       listed his destination as "no". 
 
        <p>Had the INS or the State Department 
 
       followed the law, at least 15 of the hijackers

       would have been denied visas and would not have 
 
       been in the United States on September 11, 2001. 
 
        <p>Help us to understand how something as  
 
       simple as reviewing forms for completeness could 
 
       have been missed at least 15 times.  How many more 
 
       lucky terrorists gained unfettered access into this 
 
       country?  With no one being held accountable, how

       do we know that this still isn't happening? 
 
        <p>On the morning of September 11th, the 
 
       terrorists' luck commenced with airline and airport 
 
       security.  When the 19 hijackers went to purchase 
 
       their tickets and to receive their boarding passes,

       nine were singled out and questioned through a 
 
       screening process.  Luckily for those nine 
 
       terrorists, they passed the screening process and 
 
       were allowed to continue on with their mission. 
 
        <p>But the terrorists' luck did not end at

       the ticket counter, it accompanied them through 
 
       airport security, as well, because how else would 
 
       the hijackers get specifically contraband items 
 
       such as box cutters, pepper spray, or, according to 
 
       one FAA executive summary, a gun, on those planes?

        <p>Finally, sadly for us, years of GAO 
 
       recommendations to secure cockpit doors were 
 
       ignored making it all too easy for the hijackers to  
 
       gain access to the flight controls and carry out 
 
       their suicide missions. 
 
        <p>The FAA and NORAD.  Prior to 9/11, FAA and 
 
       Department of Defense manuals gave clear,

       comprehensive instructions on how to handle 
 
       everything from minor emergencies to full-blown 
 
       hijackings.  These protocols were in place and were 
 
       practiced regularly for a good reason -- with 
 
       heavily trafficked airspace, airliners without

       radio and transponder contact are collisions 
 
       waiting to happen. 
 
        <p>These protocols dictate that in the event 
 
       of an emergency, the FAA is to notify NORAD.  Once 
 
       that notification takes place, it is then the

       responsibility of NORAD to scramble fighter jets to 
 
       intercept the errant plane.  It is a matter of 
 
       routine procedure for fighter jets to intercept 
 
       commercial airliners in order to regain contact 
 
       with the pilot.  In fact, between June 2000 and

       September 2001, fighter jets were scrambled 67 
 
       times. 
 
        <p>If that weren't enough protection, on  
 
       September 11th, NEADS, or the Northeast Air Defense 
 
       System department of NORAD, was several days into a 
 
       semi-annual exercise known as Vigilant Guardian. 
 
       This meant that our Northeast Air Defense System

       was fully staffed.  In short, key officers were 
 
       manning the operation battle center, fighter jets 
 
       were cocked, loaded, and carrying extra gas on 
 
       board.  Lucky for the terrorists none of that 
 
       mattered on September 11th.

        <p>Let me use Flight 11 as an example. 
 
       American Airlines Flight 11 departed Boston Logan 
 
       Airport at 7:45 a.m.  The last routine 
 
       communication between ground control and the plane 
 
       occurred at 8:13 a.m.  Between 8:13 and 8:20,

       Flight 11 became unresponsive to ground control. 
 
       Additionally, radar indicated that the plane had 
 
       deviated from its assigned path of flight.  Soon 
 
       thereafter, transponder contact was lost. 
 
        <p>Two Flight 11 airline attendants had

       separately called American Airlines reporting a 
 
       hijacking, the presence of weapons and the 
 
       inflictions of injuries upon passengers and crew.   
 
       At this point it would seem abundantly clear that 
 
       Flight 11 was an emergency. 
 
        <p>And yet, according to NORAD's official 
 
       timeline, NORAD was not contacted until 20 minutes

       later at 8:40 a.m.  Tragically, the fighter jets 
 
       were not deployed until 8:52 a.m., a full 32 
 
       minutes after loss of contact with Flight 11. 
 
        <p>Why was there a delay in the FAA notifying 
 
       NORAD?  Why was there a delay in NORAD's scrambling

       fighter jets?  How is this possible when NEADS was 
 
       fully staffed with planes at the ready, monitoring 
 
       our airspace? 
 
        <p>Flights 175, 77 and 93 all had this same 
 
       repeat pattern of delays in notification and delays

       in scrambling fighter jets, delays that are 
 
       unimaginable considering a plane had, by this time, 
 
       already hit the World Trade Center.  Even more 
 
       baffling for us is the fact that fighter jets were 
 
       not scrambled from the closest Air Force bases.

        <p>For example, for the flight that hit the 
 
       Pentagon, the jets were scrambled from Langley Air 
 
       Force, in Hampton, Virginia rather than Andrews Air  
 
       Force Base right outside D.C.  As a result, 
 
       Washington skies remained wholly unprotected on the 
 
       morning of September 11th. 
 
        <p>At 9:41 a.m., one hour and 21 minutes

       after the first plane was hijack confirmed by 
 
       NORAD, Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon.  The 
 
       fighter jets were still miles away.  Why? 
 
        <p>So the hijackers' luck had continued.  On 
 
       September 11th both the FAA and NORAD deviated from

       standard emergency operating procedures.  Who were 
 
       the people that delayed the notification?  Have 
 
       they been questioned? 
 
        <p>In addition, the interceptor planes or 
 
       fighter jets did not fly at their maximum speed.

       Had the belatedly scrambled fighter jets flown at 
 
       their maximum speed of engagement, they would have 
 
       reached New York City and the Pentagon within 
 
       moments of their deployment, intercepted the 
 
       hijacked airliners before they could have hit their

       targets, and undoubtedly saved lives. 
 
        <p>The leadership.  The acting Joint Chief of 
 
       Staff on September 11th was General Richard B.   
 
       Myers.  On the morning of September 11th, he was 
 
       having a routine meeting.  The acting Joint Chief 
 
       of Staff stated that he saw a TV report about a 
 
       plane hitting the World Trade Center but thought it

       was a small plane or something like that. 
 
        <p>So, he went ahead with his meeting. 
 
       "Meanwhile, the second World Trade Center was hit 
 
       by another jet.  Nobody informed us of that," 
 
       Myers said.  By the time he came out of this

       meeting, the Pentagon had been hit. 
 
        <p>Whose responsibility was it to relay this 
 
       emergency to the Joint Chief of Staff?  Have they 
 
       been held accountable for this error?  Surely this 
 
       represents a breakdown in protocol.

        <p>The Secretary of Defense was at his desk 
 
       doing paperwork when Flight 77 crashed into the 
 
       Pentagon.  As reported, Secretary Rumsfeld felt the 
 
       building shake, went outside, saw the damage and 
 
       started helping the injured onto stretchers.  After

       aiding the victims, the Secretary then went to the 
 
       War Room. 
 
        <p>How is it possible that the National  
 
       Military Command Center, located in the Pentagon 
 
       and in contact with law enforcement and air-traffic 
 
       controllers from 8:46 a.m., did not communicate to 
 
       the Secretary of Defense, also at the Pentagon,

       about the other hijacked planes, especially the one 
 
       headed to Washington?  How is it that the Secretary 
 
       of Defense could have remained at his desk until 
 
       the crash?  Whose responsibility is it to relay 
 
       emergency situations to him?

        <p>At 6:15 a.m. on the morning of September 
 
       11th, my husband Alan left for work.  He drove in 
 
       to New York City and was at his desk and working at 
 
       his NASDAQ security-trading position with Cantor 
 
       Fitzgerald, in Tower 1 of the World Trade Center,

       by 7:30 a.m. 
 
        <p>In contrast, on that morning President 
 
       Bush was scheduled to read to elementary-school 
 
       children.  Before the President walked into the 
 
       classroom, NORAD had sufficient information that

       the plane that hit the World Trade Center was 
 
       hijacked.  At that time they also had knowledge 
 
       that two other commercial airliners in the air were  
 
       also hijacked. 
 
        <p>It would seem that a national emergency 
 
       was in progress, yet the President was allowed to 
 
       enter a classroom full of young children and listen

       to students read. 
 
        <p>Why didn't the Secret Service inform him 
 
       of this national emergency?  When is the President 
 
       supposed to be notified of everything the agencies 
 
       know?  Why was the President permitted by the

       Secret Service to remain in the Sarasota elementary 
 
       school?  Was this Secret Service protocol? 
 
        <p>In the case of a national emergency, 
 
       seconds of indecision could cost thousands of 
 
       lives.  And it is precisely for that reason that

       our government has a whole network of adjuncts and 
 
       advisors to ensure that these top officials are 
 
       among the first to be informed and not the last. 
 
        <p>Where were these individuals who did not 
 
       properly inform these top officials?  Where was the

       breakdown in communication?  Was it luck?  Is it 
 
       luck that aberrant stock trades were not monitored? 
 
       Is it luck when 15 visas are awarded based on  
 
       incomplete forms?  Is it luck when airline security 
 
       screeners allow hijackers to board planes with box 
 
       cutters and pepper spray?  Is it luck when 
 
       emergency FAA and NORAD protocols are not followed?

       Is it luck when a national emergency is not 
 
       reported to top government officials on a timely 
 
       basis? 
 
        <p>To me luck is something that happens once. 
 
       When you have this repeated pattern of broken

       protocols, broken laws, broken communication, one 
 
       cannot still call it luck.  If at some point we 
 
       don't look to hold the individuals accountable for 
 
       not doing their jobs properly, then how can we ever 
 
       expect for terrorists to not get lucky again?

        <p>And that is why I'm here with all of you 
 
       today, because we must find the answers as to what 
 
       happened that day so as to ensure that another 
 
       September 11th can never happen again. 
 
        <p>Commissioners, I implore you to answer our

       questions.  You are the generals in the terrorism 
 
       fight on our shores.  In answering our questions, 
 
       you have the ability to make this nation a safer  
 
       place and, in turn, minimize the damage if there is 
 
       another terrorist attack.  And if there is another 
 
       attack, the next time our systems will be in place 
 
       and working and luck will not be an issue.  Thank

       you. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Is Allison Vadhan here 
 
       yet?  She's on the way and she has a statement and 
 
       we will put her on after the break. 
 
        <p>SPEAKER:  She's here now, she's right

       upstairs. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Here she is.  All right. 
 
       You picked your timing very well.  Are you all 
 
       right to go on right now? 
 
        <p>MS. VADHAN:  I'm all right, yes.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Okay. 
 
        <p>MS. VADHAN:  Thank you.  I apologize. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much. 
 
       Allison Vadhan, Families of Flight 93. 
 
        <p>MS. VADHAN:  Members of the Commission,

       Mr. Kean, honored guests, my name is Allison Vadhan 
 
       and I lost my very young 65-year-old mother, 
 
       Kristin White Gould, on United Flight 93, the plane  
 
       that crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania while the 
 
       passengers and crew tried to overcome the 
 
       hijackers. 
 
        <p>I'd like to thank the Commission for

       inviting me to speak today.  I've always had a 
 
       strong inner faith and I still believe that God 
 
       doesn't give us what we can't handle.  Being here 
 
       today and your hearing my voice and our voices in 
 
       place of our loved ones is a privilege.

        <p>My mother, a graduate from Cornell 
 
       University and a medical journalist, preferred to 
 
       spend her vacation time visiting ancient cities to 
 
       learn about ancient civilizations.  Before I knew 
 
       that she was flying that day, I had already

       witnessed the second tower of the World Trade 
 
       Center explode into an orange fireball and I saw 
 
       with my own eyes the great black mushroom cloud 
 
       rise above the New York City skyline, not far from 
 
       my own home.

        <p>I'm sure most Americans today remember the 
 
       sinking feeling when it was obvious that not only 
 
       the World Trade Center had come under terrorist  
 
       attacks but that there were other planes in trouble 
 
       -- along with fires and explosions in Washington. 
 
       And then there was news about a plane down in 
 
       Pennsylvania.  Before the day was over, we all knew

       that this was war. 
 
        <p>By the Christmas holidays, we faced the 
 
       anthrax attacks, the attempted bombing of the plane 
 
       from Paris to Miami, which was averted to Boston, 
 
       by Richard Reid, the discovery of an American, John

       Walker Lind, who was captured as a Taliban rebel in 
 
       Afghanistan.  How many other plans were there?  It 
 
       felt like each day could be the next day for an 
 
       attack. 
 
        <p>Most of us would turn on the TV first

       thing in the morning to see if the world had 
 
       changed overnight.  Finally, it seemed crystal 
 
       clear to citizens, as well as governments, that the 
 
       U.S. is a prized target for al Qaeda.  And this 
 
       could possibly happen again and again and again,

       whether they actually hit or just miss. 
 
        <p>I'm concerned not only about my own three 
 
       children and if the U.S. will be as strong as it  
 
       has been in the 20th century.  I'm also concerned 
 
       about what's already been taught to children in 

 
       Madrassa schools this year, last year, five years 
 
       ago.

        <p>Six days after my mother was killed, our 
 
       family traveled to Shanksville, Pennsylvania for 
 
       the memorial services for the families of Flight 
 
       93.  After the services I went back to my hotel 
 
       room for some quiet time and when I turned on the

       TV, a reporter in Pakistan was interviewing 8- and 
 
       10-year-old boys at school.  Their computer screen 
 
       savers bounced pictures of Osama bin Laden.  We 
 
       have discovered that there is another generation 
 
       being trained and raised to become terrorists when

       they grow up. 
 
        <p>I can tell you that forgetting and trying 
 
       to move on is a survival mechanism and it is part 
 
       of human nature.  The pain of trying to envision 
 
       what my mother might have been going through and

       experienced on that plane is so great that it's 
 
       almost only normal to try to forget about it and 
 
       think about something else.  But trying to forget  
 
       is an indulgence for any American who saw what we 
 
       saw. 
 
        <p>Al Qaeda and similar cells around the 
 
       world are training their young ones.  If Americans

       don't prepare for this next generation, we have 
 
       only ourselves in this room to hold accountable. 
 
        <p>I'm concerned about civil liberties as an 
 
       excuse for not taking action to prevent terrorism. 
 
       I'm concerned about how many untold cases there are

       of federal and local agencies not being able to 
 
       properly investigate a potential terrorist.  At the 
 
       time FBI investigators could not obtain a criminal 
 
       search warrant to inspect the laptop computer of 
 
       Zacharias Moussaoui because supervisors in

       Washington D.C. thought there was no probable 
 
       cause. 
 
        <p>Now that we know our laws for 
 
       investigating are outdated and no longer 
 
       appropriate, I'm concerned that we will choose not

       to fix them in the name of protecting civil 
 
       liberties, rather than protecting the lives of 
 
       American civilians.  
 
        <p>President Bush effectively made us aware 
 
       that we are fighting a new kind of war.  And if the 
 
       battlefield is here at home, waged by specific 
 
       groups from specific areas around the world, in the

       name of a specific religion, I'm concerned that 
 
       avoiding racial profiling will supersede preventing 
 
       further terrorism.  And the enemy knows this. 
 
        <p>Terrorism is similar to the guerilla 
 
       warfare we hear about going on in Iraq: Militants

       pose themselves as ordinary citizens and immigrants 
 
       here in the United States.  They appear so clean 
 
       cut, they could fit in on any golf course.  And 
 
       they do this to remain undetected until they carry 
 
       out their terrorist goals.  If we're lucky, they're

       dressed in their customary dress, they're wearing 
 
       their traditional non-Western clothing. 
 
        <p>As long as we allow groups to be protected 
 
       from racial profiling, how can we win this new war? 
 
       And after seeing those little boys in the Madrassa

       schools which are sponsored by Osama bin Laden and 
 
       the like, our children and grandchildren will, with 
 
       no uncertainly, face a very dangerous existence,  
 
       especially if we try to forget and move on. 
 
        <p>The people who died on September 11th were 
 
       the first casualties in this new war.  It is our 
 
       responsibility not to let them die in vain.  I hope

       we learn from our mistakes and prevent our children 
 
       from having to deal with the problems that their 
 
       parents and grandparents could have and should have 
 
       addressed with action and resolve. 
 
        <p>Thank you for inviting me and other

       families to speak today.  I believe that we all 
 
       share the same goal in making our country and our 
 
       world a safer place.  I hope the outcome of the 
 
       independent Commission is to learn from the past so 
 
       that history will not repeat itself.  Thank you.

        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you all very much. 
 
       This is an extraordinary panel and you have given 
 
       us a tremendous charge.  I might say, in addition 
 
       to the fact of all the questions that you have 
 
       given us that we must answer to our satisfaction

       and the satisfaction of the American people, in 
 
       addition the families' group, I didn't realize this 
 
       was appointed somewhat late, but there wouldn't be  
 
       a Commission if it was not for the work of the 
 
       victims and the families.  And we're all very, very 
 
       aware of that. 
 
        <p>I also want to say, as Chairman, that

       every single time that this Commission has asked 
 
       the families to help in any way in the execution of 
 
       our mission, they have been there, from setting out 
 
       the mission to helping us get an adequate budget. 
 
        <p>I just want to say to you all, as

       representatives of the families, thank you very, 
 
       very much, and we look forward to working with you 
 
       in the future. 
 
        <p>At this point, if I could recognize 
 
       Senator Cleland.

        <p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND:  Thank you very 
 
       much, Mr. Chairman.  Miss Kleinberg has referred to 
 
       a meeting of the new Chairman 
 
       of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was having, at that 
 
       moment of 9/11. He was having that meeting with me.

       I was on the Armed Services Committee.  And we were 
 
       talking about America's defenses at the moment. 
 
        <p>My understanding of that is at the very  
 
       moment that we were talking about that, the aide, a 
 
       lieutenant colonel, was receiving a call from the 
 
       Pentagon.  Basically the message was, as I 
 
       understand it, New York hit, Washington next.

        <p>And that scared one of my secretaries so 
 
       badly about that moment that the Chairman and I 
 
       rolled in and watched the second plane hit.  And we 
 
       left the office immediately, but it was ironic that 
 
       we were talking about defending the country at that

       very moment.  I just wanted to add that for the 
 
       record. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you, Senator. 
 
       Senator Gorton? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  Mr. Push, with the

       exception of some of your co-sufferers from this 
 
       tragedy, I doubt that anyone in the course of the 
 
       last 18 months has spent more time or thought on 
 
       this entire matter than you have. 
 
        <p>And in your written and oral testimony,

       you have several questions that you think it 
 
       necessary for us to answer.  I'd like to know 
 
       whether or not you have formed any tentative  
 
       answers to those questions that you'd like to share 
 
       with us.  And let me just do one of them. 
 
        <p>Do you have any strong and informed views 
 
       on whether or not the FBI can be an appropriate

       counterterrorism agency or whether or not we should 
 
       have a separate British-type MI-5? 
 
        <p>MR. PUSH:  It is my opinion that we should 
 
       have a separate MI-5 type of organization.  It

       appears to me that the whole culture of the FBI is 
 
       antithetical to the skills that are needed in 
 
       counterterrorism.  The reward system is geared 
 
       towards people who solve cases rather than prevent 
 
       terrorist attacks.

        <p>And I realize that the director of the FBI 
 
       is attempting to change that culture, but we 
 
       haven't got the luxury of time.  And I think we 
 
       should try a different model.  Would you like me to 
 
       mention my views on these others?

        <p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  If you'd like to do 
 
       so.  I may comment. 
 
        <p>MR. PUSH:  Sure.  
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORTON:  I have a friend who 
 
       is a United States Attorney in one of the districts 
 
       in Washington who has said to me, not at all 
 
       facetiously, recently, that he can't get the FBI to

       investigate bank robberies anymore because they're 
 
       all looking for, spies and they may very 
 
       well be inconsistent charges. 
 
        <p>MR. PUSH:  As far as foreign policy, I 
 
       think we have to take, I realize that now that

       we're at war with Iraq is not the right moment to 
 
       reevaluate our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but 
 
       I think that we need to reevaluate our 
 
       relationships with the Middle East. 
 
        <p>I think too many governments, particularly

       Saudi Arabia, but I think this applies to other 
 
       Middle Eastern governments as well, who play a 
 
       double game, who pretend to be our allies while 
 
       secretly, or sometimes not so secretly, turning a 
 
       blind eye to their citizens, funding terrorism,

       even the governments themselves setting up 
 
       newspapers that are blatantly anti-American, 
 
       anti-Semitic, schools and mosques that provide  
 
       hatred and violence. 
 
        <p>And I think that we need to use the full 
 
       weight of our -- military action 
 
       like in Iraq will not always be appropriate, but I

       think we should use the full weight of our foreign 
 
       policy, whether it be diplomatic or through foreign 
 
       aid or whatever to pressure these governments to 
 
       change until -- I believe that we'll never be safe 
 
       from Islamic extremism until the Arab Muslim

       countries begin to experience democracy. 
 
        <p>In the case of the Homeland Security 
 
       Department, I believe that it was done more to 
 
       appease the American public than to make 
 
       fundamental change.  I think just

       throwing a lot of agencies together under a single 
 
       department in and of itself does not in itself 
 
       provide a more secure environment.  We really have 
 
       to rethink. And one of the things I've mentioned 
 
       about people who are still in responsible

       positions, it's my understanding that the managers 
 
       who are responsible for the poor performance of 
 
       aviation security under the FAA have been  
 
       transferred to responsible positions in the TSA 
 
       and/or to contractors who work for the TSA.  So we 
 
       changed the label it's operating under, we haven't 
 
       changed the fundamental problem.

        <p>In the case of the 14 agencies, I support 
 
       the recommendation of the Joint 9/11 Inquiry to 
 
       have a Director of National Intelligence.  I spent 
 
       most of my time in the private sector.  You would 
 
       never even dream in the private sector having 14

       different departments in a company doing the same 
 
       thing, and nobody is in charge. 
 
        <p>And as far as political campaign 
 
       contributions having an effect on aviation 
 
       security, I suspect they have.  The airlines have

       always gotten a pass from the government.  I know 
 
       that they make the case that they're absolutely 
 
       vital to the national interest, and I believe they 
 
       are, but I believe they're in trouble not because 
 
       of regulatory requirements but because of poor

       management. 
 
        <p>And I think that they have, they seem to 
 
       have plenty of money to spend on political campaign  
 
       contributions and on lawyers and they, before 9/11 
 
       and after 9/11, they seem to have successfully 
 
       evaded many of the requirements that the government 
 
       has tried to place on them.

        <p>And I think that, and this is a broader 
 
       issue, I'm picking on the airline industry because 
 
       they're the industry that I think had played a key 
 
       role in responsibility for 9/11, but this is just 
 
       the tip of the iceberg, I think, and maybe this is

       too broad for this Commission to get into, but I 
 
       think the whole political campaign contribution
 
       system in this country is warping the political 
 
       process.  And the problems with the airline 
 
       industry are just one example of it.

        <p>COMMISSIONER FIELDING:  Thank you, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  Just a general statement, if I may, 
 
       thanking this panel.  Your stories are very 
 
       compelling, your advice is good and sound, and 
 
       obviously you have strengthened our resolve.

        <p>I know I speak for all of us, you're 
 
       obviously one of our best assets.  Please, stay 
 
       with us, please keep giving us guidance, please  
 
       keep us direct.  Thank you. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Senator Gorelick? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Yes, I might just 
 
       follow up on that.  I was very impressed with what

       both Mary Fetchet and Mindy Kleinberg had to say in 
 
       terms of the body of acknowledge that you have 
 
       brought to bear on this issue. 
 
        <p>And I was struck by the fact that 
 
       laypeople, with no powers of subpoena, with no

       access to inside information of any sort, could put 
 
       together a very powerful set of questions and set 
 
       of facts that are a roadmap for us.  And I would 
 
       just ask you to briefly describe by what process 
 
       you have developed the factual basis that you have

       laid before us today because it is really quite 
 
       striking. 
 
        <p>MS. KLEINBERG:  Hours and hours and hours 
 
       of reading articles, and you know, over the 
 
       Internet, we e-mailed each other articles.

       Somewhere in October we became obsessed with 
 
       everything that was September 11th. 
 
        <p>It started with, you know, any article  
 
       that had anything to do with September 11th we 
 
       started to pass back and forth.  And then, you 
 
       know, if they had something to do with let's say 
 
       INS, we started to look up information about the

       INS.  So it's literally 18 months of doing nothing 
 
       but grieving and reading. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you for the 
 
       reading part, motivated by the grieving, I'm sure. 
 
        <p>MS. FETCHET:  I think initially we were

       all just numb.  And we were like the general 
 
       public.  And I said to my friends, in fact, you 
 
       might read an article and say, gee, that's sort of 
 
       odd, they gave visas to the terrorists.  And you 
 
       know, that's unusual or that's, you know.

        <p>So I think that as we progressed, our 
 
       curiosity took over.  And we started reading and 
 
       really not only putting the articles together but 
 
       also connecting the dots.  And you see, I mean, 
 
       they had more than enough information to really, if

       not minimize, completely prevent this from 
 
       happening. 
 
        <p>And the problem is, these agencies are not  
 
       communicating.  They don't have protocol that they 
 
       have in place or they're not following it.  So it's 
 
       just, I think our curiosity took over and we 
 
       started drawing conclusions to reading this

       information. 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER GORELICK:  Thank you. 
 
        <p>MS. FETCHET.  But we're turning it over to 
 
       you now because we're tired.  Now it's your job. 
 
        <p>MR. PUSH:  And we want to see lots of

       subpoenas. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Congressman Roemer? 
 
        <p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER:  Thank you, Mr. 
 
       Chairman. 
 
        <p>Having served in Congress and as a member

       of the Joint Inquiry, I cannot thank all of you 
 
       enough and the people in the audience enough for 
 
       your participation in making sure that the Joint 
 
       Inquiry continued to dig hard and dig deep and get 
 
       at the facts and put out the starting point for the

       Commission. 
 
        <p>Many of you could have taken your grief 
 
       and your sorrow and your pain and gone to the  
 
       sidelines.  Instead, just as we see today the 
 
       pictures out there of your wife or your son or your 
 
       loved one, you came to every single public hearing 
 
       that we had on the Joint Inquiry.

        <p>And the members of that Joint Inquiry 
 
       looked out in the audience and saw those faces 
 
       every single day.  And that had a huge impact on 
 
       that committee, that bipartisan committee of 
 
       Senators and Congressmen, trying to do their job

       harder and harder and more effectively every day. 
 
        <p>You were instrumental in the creation of 
 
       the Commission.  It would not have happened 
 
       legislatively, getting through the House and 
 
       Senate, if it had not been for you.  At a time when

       many Americans don't even take the opportunity to 
 
       cast a ballot, you folks went out and made the 
 
       legislative system work.  You can take great pride 
 
       in that. 
 
        <p>I hope you will stay involved in this

       Commission's work.  And I hope that you will stay 
 
       involved in helping us implement recommendations of 
 
       the Commission.  That will be one of the most  
 
       difficult parts we get to. 
 
        <p>And along those lines, Steve, if you want 
 
       to, I just want to ask you a very quick question. 
 
       Maybe you don't answer it today, maybe you answer

       it in six months.  And Steve, you may have 
 
       partially answered it, but maybe you can all take a 
 
       quick try at it. 
 
        <p>What two recommendations would you like to 
 
       see us pass at the end of the day to make the

       country a safer place against this fluid, dynamic, 
 
       very lethal threat of al Qaeda and terrorists? 
 
        <p>Steve, I will call on you first.  You may 
 
       have mentioned two of them, the creation of the 
 
       Director of National Intelligence and an MI-5.

        <p>MR. PUSH:  Yes, actually I think if I had 
 
       to pick only two, I would say the Director of 
 
       National Intelligence and a change in our 
 
       relationship to the Middle East, both.  I mentioned 
 
       Saudi Arabia, but also I think we have to reexamine

       our policy towards Israel, as well. 
 
        <p>I support Israel, but we've turned a blind 
 
       eye to the expansion of settlements in the West  
 
       Bank and all of these things are interconnected. 
 
       I'm not a blame-America-first advocate.  This was 
 
       the fault of the hijackers, and the hijackers were 
 
       the fault of a dysfunctional society in the Arab

       Muslim countries. 
 
        <p>Unfortunately, we can't just pin the blame 
 
       on them because they're killing us.  So we have to 
 
       do whatever we can, use whatever leverage we have 
 
       to force changes there that will stop them from

       continuing to create young people who hate us more 
 
       than they love life itself. 
 
        <p>We can build a wall around America, and we 
 
       will never be able to protect ourselves as long as 
 
       there are people like that in the world.

        <p>MS. FETCHET:  I think the two areas I 
 
       would like to see changes in would be the FBI and 
 
       the CIA working together.  To me it's inexcusable 
 
       that you have two agencies that are supposed to be 
 
       protecting our citizens.  And they have cultures

       and territorial wars and they're not communicating 
 
       or coordinating their efforts. 
 
        <p>I think the second thing is immigration.   
 
       I think we really do not know who is living in this 
 
       country.  I was amazed to hear -- the learning 
 
       curve for all of us has been beyond straight up -- 
 
       but when I sat in the Joint Intelligence hearings

       and I heard that the watch list only goes one way, 
 
       that doesn't make sense to me.  And I can't 
 
       understand how we're not monitoring people coming 
 
       and going.  So I think those are the two areas. 
 
        <p>And one other thing I'd like to include is

       just to mention how thankful we are for the work 
 
       that the Joint Intelligence Committee did.  They 
 
       really, worked hard.  I 
 
       would like you to follow some of their 
 
       recommendations.

        <p>They were very frustrated with people not 
 
       showing up for testimony, people not complying with 
 
       subpoenas, and so, I've forgotten who mentioned it 
 
       to us, but they said subpoena early and often, and 
 
       that's another recommendation that I would have, is

       make that list and get started. 
 
        <p>MS. KLEINBERG:  You know, I agree with 
 
       Mary and Steve.  I also think that there's a part  
 
       about accountability that we, as citizens, we can't 
 
       hold the Director of Central Intelligence 
 
       accountable or the people that work for him or the 
 
       FBI, we're not in charge of hiring or firing them.

        <p>And there's no way, there's no report 
 
       card, you know, it's a matter of national security. 
 
       So Congressional oversight becomes extremely 
 
       important.  And you know, our ability to, as 
 
       Americans, to get the story out so that we know

       who's accountable and we know that we could use our 
 
       votes to ensure this accountability.  That's one of 
 
       them. 
 
        <p>And the other is, I think there should be 
 
       full disclosure for public officials of any of

       their business interests.  You know, we have talked 
 
       a lot about conflicts on this Commission.  And you 
 
       know, the onus is on you to rise above those 
 
       conflicts. 
 
        <p>And I'm sure that you will be able to do

       that when it is this important of a job, but I 
 
       think, you know, it's another area that has to be 
 
       looked at that when we put people into office,  
 
       whether it's a Congressman or a Senator or a 
 
       President, we have to take a look at what their 
 
       business interests are so that there are no 
 
       conflicts there either.

        <p>MS. VADHAN:  Again, I'll just reiterate 
 
       what I have said in my statement.  I think we need 
 
       to take a good look at the laws, how we investigate 
 
       possible suspects, how we investigate, how we keep 
 
       track of immigrants, and also take a look at, take

       a good hard look at what we do know about September 
 
       11th and the people who were involved with 
 
       conspiring the terrorist attacks and finding out 
 
       why we decided to stop investigating or stop 
 
       following one of the hijackers in the middle of the

       year, right before September 11th, we just decided 
 
       to stop following him. 
 
        <p>We had been on his tail for over a year, 
 
       and for some unknown reason, we just don't know, we 
 
       decided to stop watching him.  And we didn't hear

       about him until he ended up on the plane, on Flight 
 
       93 that crashed in Pennsylvania. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Are there anymore  
 
       questions from the Commissioners?  If not, you are 
 
       extraordinary people.  Thank you so very much for 
 
       your testimony.  I believe we're running late, not 
 
       unexpectedly, but I would ask, therefore, if we

       could hold our break to 45 minutes.  Let's catch 
 
       our 15 minutes that way, if we could be back here 
 
       in 45 minutes.  Thank you all very much. 
 
        <p>(45-minute recess) 
 
<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you all very, very

       much for coming.  I'd like to start by introducing 
 
       Dr. Sofaer, from Hoover Institution.  Institute, 
 
       right? 
 
        <p>DR. SOFAER:  Institution. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Institution.  It's

       Institution, all right.  Thank you very much, sir, 
 
       for coming here today. 
 
        <p>DR. SOFAER:  Delighted to be here, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  It's a privilege, Mr. Chairman and 
 
       members of this Commission, to testify concerning

       the prevention of terrorist acts against the United 
 
       States.  My experience in this field is based on 
 
       service as a federal prosecutor with one of the  
 
       Commissioners here, Mr. Ben-Veniste, as a federal 
 
       judge, as legal advisor to the Department of State 
 
       and another Commissioner participated in making me 
 
       legal advisor, Fred Fielding, and as a scholar in

       the area of national security. 
 
        <p>And I am honored to say, Mr. Chairman, 
 
       that I serve with many in the federal government, 
 
       with many of the people who are sitting here as 
 
       Commissioners and I am privileged to be with you

       again. 
 
        <p>This Commission has the formidable task of 
 
       explaining the terrorist acts of September 11th and 
 
       providing recommendations help to prevent such 
 
       attacks in the future.  The cost of those attacks

       is staggering, as you know:  2,819 lives at the 
 
       World Trade Center, including 343 firefighters and 
 
       paramedics, 23 New York City policemen, 124 killed 
 
       at the Pentagon, 271 people who died in the crashes 
 
       of the airplanes involved and the economic

       consequences of it are tremendous and still haven't 
 
       been figured out.  We know that New York City, this 
 
       great city, lost 146,000 jobs.  
 
        <p>Those who were murdered on September 11th 
 
       remain in our minds and hearts.  We owe it to them 
 
       to ask ourselves, what are the lessons of their 
 
       terrible deaths, have we made the changes to permit

       us to say they did not die in vain. 
 
        <p>The long process of introspection began 
 
       immediately after the attacks and continues.  This 
 
       Commission will find no shortage of ideas as to how 
 
       America can defend itself more effectively,

       including better intelligence, reorganization of 
 
       agencies, enhanced technologies, better 
 
       diplomacy and accountability.  These are all 
 
       important subjects which the Commission must 
 
       address.

        <p>My testimony, Mr. Chairman, though, will 
 
       focus on what I regard as most significant, the 
 
       failure to use force to prevent the terrorist acts 
 
       of 9/11 from happening.  It is now the strategic 
 
       policy of the United States to use force

       preemptively to prevent terrorists and their 
 
       states' supporters from attacking this country. 
 
        <p>Until 9/11, however, the use of force was  
 
       not seriously pursued.  When President Clinton 
 
       promised to bring terrorists to justice, he meant 
 
       that he would investigate them, try to capture 
 
       them, and when that was possible, see that they

       were tried, convicted and sent to prison. 
 
        <p>Preventing terrorist attacks became a game 
 
       in which national-security experts, the FBI, 
 
       prosecutors and intelligence personnel attempted to 
 
       learn where and when attacks were to occur before

       they actually happened so they could do their best 
 
       to prevent it. 
 
        <p>For many years prior to 9/11, I spoke out 
 
       as forcefully as I could against this approach to 
 
       fighting terrorism.  My position was not original,

       Mr. Chairman.  It reflected the views of Secretary 
 
       of State George Shultz, and the views of his boss, 
 
       Ronald Reagan. 
 
        <p>He proposed in 1983 that the United States 
 
       should adopt a policy of active defense against

       terror.  "Fighting terrorism will not be a clean or 
 
       pleasant contest," he said, "but we have no choice. 
 
       We must reach a consensus in this country that our  
 
       responses should go beyond passive measures, 
 
       passive defense, to consider means of active 
 
       prevention, preemption and retaliation.  Our goal 
 
       must be to prevent and deter future terrorist

       attacks." 
 
        <p>By the end of the Reagan administration, 
 
       the Shultz Doctrine had become national policy as 
 
       reflected by the bombing of Libya in 1987 for 
 
       arranging terrorist attacks on America.

        <p>Mr. Chairman, you know, and certainly 
 
       Co-Chairman Hamilton knows, that nothing stays the 
 
       same in Washington D.C.  After the first President 
 
       Bush took over, the bombing of Pan Am 103 was 
 
       treated as a criminal matter and eventually

       resolved after years of legal and diplomatic 
 
       maneuvering with the conviction of a single Libyan 
 
       intelligence operative. 
 
        <p>Osama bin Laden fashioned his strategy on 
 
       the basis of this passive policy.  He became

       convinced the U.S. could be forced to leave Muslim 
 
       countries and abandon Israel if he launched attacks 
 
       that shed American blood.  Nothing that happened  
 
       prior to September 11th gave bin Laden reason to 
 
       doubt his assumptions. 
 
        <p>Al Qaeda was responsible for several 
 
       successful attacks on U.S. targets prior to

       September 11th, as the Commission knows.  And 
 
       throughout this onslaught, we responded precisely 
 
       as bin Laden anticipated. 
 
        <p>In early 1993, al Qaeda operatives began 
 
       training Somali fighters to attack UN forces, and

       in October that year, they participated in attacks 
 
       that killed 18 marines.  We had boisterously 
 
       arranged to have the UN Security Council issue a 
 
       warrant for the arrest of Mohamed Aidid, but after 
 
       suffering these 18 deaths, we withdrew from

       Somalia. 
 
        <p>On February 26, 1993, a car bomb exploded 
 
       under the World Trade Center, killing eight people 
 
       and injuring over a thousand.  We convicted most of 
 
       the perpetrators, but we left the organization from

       which they came unscathed. 
 
        <p>On June 26, 1996, car bombs killed 19 
 
       Americans in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and injured  
 
       another 200.  The U.S. suspected bin Laden and al 
 
       Qaeda.  All we did, however, was open a criminal 
 
       investigation.  Bin Laden was not intimidated.  On 
 
       October 12th that year, he issued a declaration of

       war against the U.S., calling on Muslims to "fight 
 
       jihad and cleanse the land from these Crusader 
 
       occupiers." 
 
        <p>In November of 1996, bombings in Riyadh 
 
       and at the Khobar Towers barracks killed another 19

       American servicemen and injured 109.  Bin Laden 
 
       called those attacks "praiseworthy terrorism," and 
 
       he promised more would follow.  Once again, we sent 
 
       in the FBI. 
 

        <p>In February 1998, bin Laden put his war

       into the form of a religious order, declaring the 
 
       "killing of Americans and their civilian and 
 
       military allies is a religious duty for each and 
 
       every Muslim." 
 
        <p>And then August that same year, al Qaeda

       terrorists car-bombed the U.S. embassies in Kenya 
 
       and Tanzania, killing 224 people and injuring about 
 
       5,000.  The U.S. launched a single ineffectual  
 
       missile strike on an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan, 
 
       on one of those big old mountains, and on a 
 
       pharmaceutical plant in Sudan. 
 
        <p>When it came to legal action, though, we

       pulled out the stops; we indicted bin Laden on 224 
 
       counts of murder.  Characteristically, he failed to 
 
       show up for his trial.  We settled for prosecuting 
 
       four al Qaeda operatives, after which prosecutors 
 
       triumphantly declared that they would continue to

       investigate al Qaeda until bin Laden and his 
 
       cohorts were all brought to justice. 
 
        <p>This so terrified bin Laden that he told 
 
       Time Magazine, "The U.S. knows that I have attacked 
 
       it, by the grace of God, for more than 10 years

       now," in other words, why are they making such a 
 
       big deal out of this? 
 
        <p>On October 12, 2000, a suicide boat 
 
       bombing of the USS Cole in Aden harbor killed 17 
 
       American sailors and injured 40, in addition to

       causing over $100 million of damage.  We knew it, 
 
       it was al Qaeda's work, but the Clinton 
 
       administration did not bother to engage even in a  
 
       symbolic use of force, not even that one salvo of 
 
       missiles this time.  Instead, it launched once 
 
       again a massive invasion of aggressive FBI agents, 
 
       incidentally, none of whom could speak Arabic.

        <p>At the turn of the millennium, we had some 
 
       very good luck.  An attack plan for the Los Angeles 
 
       Airport was aborted when the perpetrator panicked 
 
       on his way into the U.S.  from Canada. 
 
        <p>U.S. officials knew that bin Laden would

       strike again.  They worried intensively, not about 
 
       whether an attack was coming, over where and when. 
 
       As the attack began on September 11th, the 
 
       President's advisors were sitting around a table in 
 
       the White House, worrying.  They knew immediately

       that the attack for which they were waiting was 
 
       underway. 
 
        <p>Given these events, it is small surprise 
 
       that after the attacks of September 11th, bin Laden 
 
       was triumphant.  He was a hero.  His strategy had

       worked.  The U.S. had not stopped him. 
 
        <p>Now we have heard many claims by former 
 
       and present officials in an attempt to explain why  
 
       they could not have prevented the 9/11 attacks. 
 
       The accumulating evidence undermines these claims. 
 
       But these excuses are, in any event, beside the 
 
       point.  And that is the fundamental point of my

       testimony to this Commission.  They are beside the 
 
       point. 
 
        <p>The fact is that well before September 
 
       11th, the FBI, the intelligence community, the 
 
       Terrorism Czar, and everyone to whom they reported

       all knew that additional attacks by al Qaeda were 
 
       being planned and would certainly be attempted. 
 
       They simply failed to do before September 11th what 
 
       was done immediately thereafter. 
 
        <p>The horrors of that day finally galvanized

       the nation into action.  Now President Bush has 
 
       adopted three principles to guide U.S. policy: 
 
       First, that serious terrorist attacks should be 
 
       treated as acts of war, not merely as crimes; 
 
       second, that states are responsible for terrorism

       from within their borders; and third, that we must 
 
       preempt attacks where possible. 
 
        <p>These principles are strategically  
 
       necessary, morally sound, and legally defensible. 
 
       This Commission should confirm the need to adopt 
 
       active measures of defense.  Where grave threats 
 
       are present, state responsibility exists and the

       need for the use of preemptive force is 
 
       demonstrable, even if not imminent. 
 
        <p>The notion that criminal prosecution could 
 
       bring a terrorist group like al Qaeda to justice is 
 
       absurd.  And the UN Security Council has now

       authoritatively established the responsibilities of 
 
       states in this regard in its Resolution 1373. 
 
        <p>As for preemption, the Commission should 
 
       consider carefully the implications of a position 
 
       that would preclude the U.S. from acting in its

       self defense merely because a real, terrible, and 
 
       certain threat was not also imminent.  The 
 
       Commission should reject any standard of law that 
 
       would unreasonably restrict the President from 
 
       performing his or her obligation to protect the

       United States. 
 
        <p>The need for preemptive actions stems 
 
       ultimately from the conditions in modern life.  We  
 
       are a target-rich country, huge, virtually 
 
       impossible to defend effectively.  Every potential 
 
       type of weapon can be used against us, from the 
 
       most conventional to the most modern and

       unconventional.  We are vulnerable.  Our entire 
 
       infrastructure is vulnerable and will be for many 
 
       years to come. 
 
        <p>The area of intelligence is no less 
 
       subject to this reality.  Many improvements should

       be made to enhance capacities, but it is illusory 
 
       to believe that intelligence, even combined with 
 
       all presently conceivable advances in technology, 
 
       will enable us to know in advance of all the 
 
       attacks we will have to foil through passive

       measures to achieve an adequate level of security. 
 
        <p>We must, therefore, be able, when 
 
       necessary, to resort to active measures, and 
 
       necessity must be determined on the basis of all 
 
       relevant factors, not just imminence.

        <p>No national-security policy against 
 
       terrorism can be regarded as sound if it fails to 
 
       include preemptive actions as an essential element.  
 
       Nor should the Commission underestimate the 
 
       importance of preemption. 
 
        <p>The historical record indicates that many 
 
       terrorist acts, attacks on the U.S., can be

       anticipated.  The most recent attacks were by al 
 
       Qaeda, a single organization responsible for most 
 
       of the attacks I have listed for you, led by a man 
 
       who announced his intentions to kill Americans, in 
 
       advance, and who demonstrated his capacity to do so

       over and over again before he was finally stopped. 
 
        <p>Other groups likely to attack us are also 
 
       well known, indeed, this panel has on it some of 
 
       the world's experts on those groups.  It is true 
 
       that any war carries risks and the war on terrorism

       is no exception. But the risks of using force must 
 
       always be weighed against the risk of inaction. 
 
        <p>The Commission should keep in mind the 
 
       utterly helpless posture into which our 
 
       national security officials placed themselves and

       the damage to which they exposed the nation by 
 
       failing to treat, as a proper part of their 
 
       authority and indeed of their responsibility, the  
 
       use of force against so well-established and 
 
       determined an enemy as al Qaeda. 
 
        <p>Ultimately, we owe the dead, the living, 
 
       and the unborn a world of freedom and tolerance.

       When all else fails, we must fight to preserve and, 
 
       in due course, extend those values.  Freedom and 
 
       tolerance are not merely Western or American 
 
       ideals.  They are enshrined in the UN Charter, 
 
       freely subscribed to by all Member States.  To

       allow their subordination to any ideology or 
 
       religion, however deeply felt, would undo the 
 
       principles upon which the future of this nation and 
 
       of humanity rests.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.

       Professor Dan Byman, who's got a class to teach, 
 
       somebody who works for a university who understands 
 
       very, very clearly is a top priority.  He's from 
 
       Georgetown University.  Thank you, sir, for coming. 
 
       And when you have to leave, we will certainly

       understand that. 
 
        <p>PROFESSOR BYMAN:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  Governor Kean, Vice Chairman Hamilton,  
 
       Commissioners and Commission staff, representatives 
 
       of the victims and survivors of the attack.  I am 
 
       very grateful and honored to be here today speaking 
 
       to you.

        <p>In my testimony today I am going to 
 
       concentrate, in the interests of brevity, on key 
 
       intelligence and policy issues that proved a 
 
       problem before September 11th.  The CIA has been 
 
       roundly criticized, as have other intelligence

       agencies, for their performance in 
 
       counterterrorism.  They particularly have been 
 
       faulted for not stopping the attacks of September 
 
       11th. 
 
        <p>A closer scrutiny of the factual

       background, however, suggests there was no single 
 
       action, no simple step, that, had it been taken, 
 
       would have stopped the attack.  More broadly, the 
 
       intelligence community, and I would say 
 
       particularly the CIA, did well in providing

       strategic warning of the al Qaeda threat. 
 
        <p>Policymakers from both parties have 
 
       confirmed that the intelligence community informed  
 
       them of the identity of the foe, the scale of its 
 
       ambitions and its lethality before September 11th. 
 
       Nevertheless, it is clear that the intelligence 
 
       community could have done much better.

        <p>In my judgment, many of the problems the 
 
       intelligence community faced in meeting the 
 
       challenge al Qaeda stemmed from broader structural 
 
       issues, and I will discuss three today. 
 
        <p>One issue was a large gap that existed

       between the gathering of intelligence domestically 
 
       by the FBI and the overseas focus of the rest of 
 
       the intelligence community.  As a result of this 
 
       gap, there was lack of sharing of information 
 
       between those tracking radicals at home and those

       tracking radicals abroad. 
 
        <p>There was little attempt to marry up this 
 
       privileged information that only the FBI held with 
 
       broader CIA information and vice versa.  And the 
 
       working-level analysts and operatives often did not

       know information was available, let alone its 
 
       content. 
 
        <p>Because of these problems, it is  
 
       unfortunate but reasonable to conclude that the 
 
       threat to the U.S. homeland received less attention 
 
       than the coverage of al Qaeda's activities 
 
       overseas.

        <p>A second structural problem was that there 
 
       was no firm control of the intelligence community, 
 
       and as a result, prioritization was exceptionally 
 
       difficult.  The CIA had responsibilities for 
 
       supporting more fighting in Iraq and the Balkans,

       monitoring China and other rivals and so on.  For 
 
       the FBI, dead-beat dads, drug money, infrastructure 
 
       protection, all competed for resources with 
 
       counterterrorism.  There was no single plan that 
 
       everyone followed and because everything was

       declared to be a priority, nothing really was. 
 
        <p>A third structural problem was that before 
 
       September 11th, the FBI was not properly oriented 
 
       for counterterrorism.  The Bureau often failed to 
 
       collect relevant information and the information

       collected often was not disseminated outside of the 
 
       FBI and many times within the FBI.  Few people in 
 
       the FBI with counterterrorism responsibilities knew  
 
       about al Qaeda.  What knowledge that existed was 
 
       primarily confined to the New York field office. 
 
       The FBI culture fostered these problems. 
 
        <p>Before September 11th, the FBI was

       primarily a law-enforcement agency and it was 
 
       probably the world's best.  But law enforcement 
 
       focuses on prosecuting cases, not on understanding 
 
       a broader network.  Law enforcement emphasizes 
 
       gathering specific evidence, not collecting and

       sharing all possibly relevant information. 
 
        <p>As a result of these problems, the FBI not 
 
       only was not conscious of al Qaeda activities in 
 
       the United States but also didn't know the depth of 
 
       its own ignorance; it didn't know what it didn't

       know.  But concentrating attention solely on the 
 
       intelligence community misses the broader context 
 
       of counterterrorism. 
 
        <p>A broader review of the U.S. Government's 
 
       performance in both the Clinton and the Bush

       administrations before September 11th suggests 
 
       several deep flaws and problems.  As a result of 
 
       these, the intelligence community's successful  
 
       strategic warning of the al Qaeda threat was not 
 
       met with the proper response. 
 
        <p>One policy problem was very carefully and 
 
       well discussed by my colleague here at the table,

       Mr. Sofaer.  I will simply add my endorsement to 
 
       his remarks that the use of force was not properly 
 
       considered as an option before September 11th. 
 
        <p>A second problem was that U.S. policy left 
 
       the issue of terrorist sanctuary unresolved.  In

       Afghanistan, al Qaeda was essentially allowed to build 
 
       to an army of like-minded radicals outside the 
 
       reach of the United States.  But even more 
 
       troubling, al Qaeda enjoyed a permissive 
 
       environment in the West, including in the United

       States.  It was allowed to recruit, raise money, 
 
       train and plot with relatively little interference 
 
       throughout much of the world. 
 
        <p>A third policy flaw was the limited 
 
       defensive measures against terrorism in the United

       States.  Almost 20 years ago, the Inman Commission 
 
       investigated the bombings of the U.S. and Marine 
 
       barracks in Lebanon.  And they concluded, "If  
 
       determined well-trained and funded teams are 
 
       seeking to do damage, they will eventually 
 
       succeed." 
 
        <p>Over 10 years later, the Cole Commission,

       investigating the 1998 embassy bombings, came to 
 
       pretty much the same conclusion, "We cannot count 
 
       on having intelligence to warn us of such  
 
       attacks." 
 
        <p>But despite the finding that intelligence is

       likely to be lacking, when facing a skilled 
 
       adversary and the intelligence community's 
 
       strategic warning of the al Qaeda threat, very few 
 
       defensive measures were initiated in the United 
 
       States before September 11th.

        <p>Now the problems I have briefly described 
 
       are problems in a pre-9/11 world.  And much has 
 
       changed since September 11th.  Since the attack, 
 
       funding for intelligence and counterterrorism in 
 
       particular has increased dramatically.  Both

       policymakers and the intelligence community are 
 
       intensely focused on terrorism and there have been 
 
       numerous bureaucratic changes to fight terrorism,  
 
       particularly in the FBI. 
 
        <p>In its work, I hope the Commission not 
 
       only evaluates what went wrong on September 11th 
 
       but also the quality of changes that we have taken

       since then as a nation to prevent the recurrence of 
 
       these attacks. 
 
        <p>Mr. Chairman, the work that you and your 
 
       fellow commissioners are doing is essential if we 
 
       are to ensure the security of Americans and triumph

       over the threat of terrorism.  And I am confident 
 
       that the Commission's work will enable our country 
 
       to better meet future challenges and prevent a 
 
       recurrence of the nightmare of September 11th. 
 
        <p>But I must conclude on a pessimistic note.

       Al Qaeda is simply too skilled an adversary to 
 
       expect uninterrupted success.  The United States 
 
       and every nation should recognize that any 
 
       improvements that occur will reduce the frequency 
 
       of attacks, will reduce the lethality of attacks,

       but will not end them completely.  Thank you very 
 
       much. 
 
        <p>CHAIRMAN KEAN:  Thank you very much.  Our  
 
       next speaker we have is Mr. Brian Jenkins, from the 
 
       Rand Corporation. 
 
        <p>MR. JENKINS:  Thank you very much, Mr. 
 
       Chairman.  The written remarks that I submitted to

       the Commission, which I believe are in your 
 
       briefing books, address the nature of the current 
 
       terrorist threat, the goals of our counterterrorist 
 
       strategy and the role of intelligence in dealing 
 
       with terrorism.

        <p>Subsequently, I was asked by members of 
 
       your staff if, in my comments this afternoon, I 
 
       could specifically address the topics of al Qaeda's 
 
       mindset, their purpose in attacking the World Trade 
 
       Center, and how this attack has profoundly affected

       our society. 
 
        <p>The members of this panel were chatting 
 
       just before we convened here about the necessity to 
 
       change our vocabulary when it came to the 
 
       description of al Qaeda. This is not some
organization which we simply can depict in a chart
on the wall and draw Xs through its key figures.

		<p>Al Qaeda is more than an organization, it

is a global network of relationships. It is one
among a galaxy of like-minded terrorist
enterprises. It is a system, a process for
transforming the discontents of Islam into a
violent expression of jihad.

		<p>Al Qaeda also reflects a mindset, a
mindset that really transcends the specific members
that we may label as members of al Qaeda. Its
members believe, as others, that Islam is on the
defensive.

		<p>Indeed, they believe that Islam's very
existence is threatened, not simply by the presence
of our troops in Saudi Arabia or our support for
Israel, but by the secular nature of our society,
by our vast commercial and cultural power, by the
destructive effects they see in globalization, by
their own marginalization in the world, in their
own societies, in the countries to which they and
their parents have migrated.

		<p>They really operate and are instructed in
a very harrowing, apocalyptic vision of death and
destruction, one that is informed by an conflated

history of centuries, from the Crusades, to the
sacking of Baghdad by the Mongol armies, to the
latest headlines on CNN. To respond to this, to
battle their way to what they regard as the age of
the tyrants and to achieve this utopian restoration
of the Caliphate, God commands that they mount an
aggressive attack and places no limits on its
violence. Only violence, cataclasmic violence, can
change that reality, defend Islam, and drive them
into this new age.

		<p>Therefore, it is absolutely consistent
that al Qaeda, as we see from the intelligence
reports, is determined to acquire and use weapons
of mass destruction, is determined to carry out
events on the scale of a 9/11. Fortunately, for
the time being, its capabilities in the area of
chemical or biological weapons trail its
ambitions, but it's certainly something that we
have to take as a presumption going forward.

		<p>Now what did these people hope to
accomplish by attacking the World Trade Center? As
a consequence of its sheer size, its soaring

height, its prominence on the New York skyline, the
World Trade Center was an obvious terrorist target
almost from the moment its construction was
completed. Both terrorists and terrorism's
analysts saw this.

		<p>The size also meant mass casualties. To
terrorists who in the 1990s seemed increasingly
intent upon large-scale violence, toppling the
towers could bring fatalities in the tens of
thousands, which we now know was the terrorists'
intent.

		<p>Symbolically, the World Trade Center
represented America's economic might, our ambition
to extend our brand of free commerce throughout the
world, the physical expression of globalization,
even before the term was coined. Bringing down the
World Trade Center, in their mind, would challenge
American authority and would demonstrate the power
of the attackers.

		<p>Of course having been attacked
unsuccessfully in 1993, that only increased the
possibility that it would be attacked again. We

recognized this immediately after the '93 bombing.
In contemplating all possible forms of attack, we
even included among the theoretical scenarios a
plane crashing into the building.

		<p>Now there wasn't a hell of a lot we could
do about that with protective measures other than
to recommend that there be the opportunity for
swift evacuation of the towers, and fortunately, a
lot of people did get out on September 11th.

		<p>Officials in charge of the property also
recognized that another major terrorist attack,
even if unsuccessful, would ruin its commercial
future. And I want to return to this point in
light of current concerns about the ruinous
economic consequences of another 9/11-scale attack
in the United States.

		<p>Al Qaeda's leadership also, in attacking
the World Trade Center, hoped by such an attack to
provoke an American retaliation. A feeble American
response like that described by my colleague here,
like that in 1998, would only confirm, in their
eyes, our impotence. On the other hand, an

indiscriminate massive response could be portrayed
by them as an assault on Islam and might provoke a
huge backlash that would also advantage al Qaeda.

		<p>Now destruction of the World Trade Center
obviated concerns about the commercial viability of
the property itself, but the 9/11 attack did have
cascading effects, devastating cascading effects,
on the American economy.

		<p>Abe correctly points out, calculating the
costs of 9/11 is tricky business, but in addition
to the lives lost, the damage to property, the
insured business-interruption losses amount to
perhaps $50 billion, total losses in revenue into
the hundreds of billions, increased security costs
at the federal level, tens of billions.

		<p>State and local governments are being
crushed by the incremental security costs.
Corporate security costs have increased by an
average of 40 to 50 percent, insurance premiums up
by 30 percent. Borders and ports slowed down just-
in-time deliveries, inventories increased at a cost. We have
spent the last three decades exploiting new

technology and new management techniques to remove
friction from the economy. We have spent the last
18-and-a-half months putting friction back in.

		<p>Now all of this imposes a cost, making
terrorism an effective mode of economic warfare.
Now I doubt that the terrorists were aware of this
on September 11th, but they cannot help but to
have observed these effects in the 18-and-a-half
months since. And that poses a challenge to us.

		<p>We cannot rely in our strategy of homeland
security on a gates-and-guards approach. We must
design security that is effective and efficient.
We must build critical infrastructure that is
strong and resilient, able to suffer damage and
continue to function. Above all, we must abandon
unrealistic expectations of total security and
instead adopt a more realistic acceptance of risk.
We must not allow terrorist attacks or fears of
terrorist attack to shut us down.

		<p>Now building a more effective defense is
going to require intelligence. And let me just
make a final comment on intelligence. There has

been a great deal of debate in the federal
government about how we should reorganize to
improve our intelligence collection and analysis
here in the United States. We've talked about
restructuring the FBI, we've talked about creating
a domestic intelligence-collection service,
patterned after the British MI-5.

		<p>In my own view, we can do a lot more by
taking advantage of local-level intelligence
collection, and I think that might even be better
than creating another federal entity.

		<p>There's great potential at the local
level. Local police departments know their
territory, they are recruited locally, they often
have a composition that better reflects the local
ethnic mix, they have often more native fluency,
foreign-language capabilities. Unlike federal
officers, they don't rotate from city to city every
three or four years.

		<p>To take as an example, you heard from the
New York Police Department this morning. The NYPD
is one of the most effective departments in the
country. They have devoted a thousand of their
officers to intelligence collection, about
two-and-a-half percent of their total strength. If
police departments across the country were to
dedicate a similar portion of their strength to
intelligence collection, we would have a national
intelligence capability of 15,000 to 18,000
officers.

		<p>Now in order to make it work on a national
basis, they would need better training, they would
need a common curriculum, they would need some
better technology, and, above all, they would have
to be linked so that the results of their
investigations could be shared across
jurisdictional lines.

		<p>They're ready to go. We don't have to
wait several years to create another entity in
Washington. We don't even have to build a new
building. So I think that in looking at
intelligence solutions, we might want to look to
our local capabilities before we look to another
Washington solution. Thank you.

		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Dr. Ranstorp is from the
University of St. Andrews.

		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Thank you much, honored
members of this panel, this Commission, members of
the Senate, members of Congress, ladies and
gentlemen and honored guests. I am honored to be
here.

		<p>I am not going to go into the
introspective of what happened on 9/11, but
hopefully, I can contribute to some future
prescription, looking at it from the outside,
looking at U.S. terrorism policy in a global
perspective.

		<p>I applaud the introspective and noble
purpose of this Commission. We must understand our
historic shortcomings to better order our future
steps in security. To no one is this quest more
important or heartfelt than the families and
friends of those fallen on September the 11th, some
of whom are assembled here today.

		<p>Now while nothing will compensate them for
their loss, the search for some semblance of
justice lies not only in assessing the intelligence
and policy failures. And let me say that it's not
just in the context of the United States, but also
there were not only intelligence failures but also
intelligence failures in terms of policy failures
that contributed even on the outside of the United
States and that contributed to this over the past.

		<p>But we also must look towards the future
to ensure that September the 11th will never
again be repeated. Let me emphasize something
that has been echoed here before. There is no plan
that is absolutely watertight. There is no one
overarching solution that will defeat terrorism.
We can say with certainty that what Osama bin Laden
and al Qaeda set in motion on September the 11th is
likely to reoccur in different places under
different circumstances in the future.

		<p>Much of our future success lies in knowing
our adversary. Let me echo what Brian Jenkins
said, in our conception of al Qaeda -- and that's
something I spent a lot of time on in my written
contribution to this Commission -- how it adapts,

and in prescribing countermeasures which would
stand the rigors of an ever-changing global
context.

		<p>Now we have deconstructed in myriad ways
our intelligence failures and have offered some
potential solutions in addressing these and in
breaking down the bureaucratic barriers. Today,
unlike before September the 11th, there is an
unprecedented U.S.-led coalition, including -- and
me emphasize this -- including over 90 countries
overtly and covertly that have degraded the
capabilities of al Qaeda.

		<p>For instance, a number of those
responsible for the planning of September the 11th
attacks and other terrorist operations are in U.S.
custody, including the mastermind of al Qaeda's
planning, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed.

		<p>Now the response of the United States to
al Qaeda has been focused and highly successful,
both visibly and otherwise. And I laude President
Bush's 4D approach to fighting terror, to defeat,
to deny, to diminish and to defend, and I believe

this strategy strikes the requisite balance of
offence and defense. And let me stress the
necessity of offence to counter terrorism with a
global reach.

		<p>Further, the recent establishment of the
Terrorist Threat Integration Center is a powerful
testament to the progressive strategy of the
administration and sends a commanding signal to
terrorists and their supporters that the United
States will continue to bring to bear the full
measure of its intelligence capabilities to thwart
future plans.

		<p>Now my expertise as a foreign scholar of
Islam, militant Islamic movements and terrorism
lies not in assessing or critiquing the structures
or responses of the U.S. intelligence community,
the counterterrorism bodies, or other institutional
bureaucracies, or in pinpointing the precise
shortcomings that led to September the 11th, 2001.
There are those better equipped to address the
panel.

		<p>What I can do is possibly think about this

in more of a global perspective in highlighting not
only challenges but also possibly a roadmap toward
the future, in order to preempt, to prevent another
attack upon the interests of the United States, at
home or abroad.
		<p>Now it is essential that the United States
in this global war on terrorism continues to craft
and to evolve comprehensive new strategies and
tactics that balance a changing adversary with a
rapidly changing global environment. It is
absolutely necessary not just to take a defensive
approach but also think globally. And the United
States is doing that at this moment.

		<p>Counterterrorism policy has never been,
will never be in the future, divorced from other
strands of foreign policy, regional initiatives, or
fail to take into account, for example, the nuances
and the significance of the Israeli-Palestinian
crisis.

		<p>Yet, as Vice Admiral Thomas R. Wilson
indicated, even the resolution of this
Israeli-Palestinian conflict will not bring an end
1
to the systemic problems inherent to the global
landscape that foment terrorism and enable
organizations such as al Qaeda to thrive and to
flourish.

		<p>Countering al Qaeda depends upon
understanding its true character, as well as the
environment in which violent jihadism operates.
Only then can prescriptive solutions be applied and
the flow of capabilities and the threat-based
intelligence be translated into building effective
countermeasures within a strategic framework.

		<p>Now Brian Jenkins offered, I would say, a
way in which one should look at al Qaeda, not as a
static phenomenon. It is not a static
organization. It exists on a number of different
levels. We have to think about what comes after al
Qaeda, post-al Qaeda, and the systemic environment
is very difficult in producing, potentially, future
generations that will follow the message of bin
Laden and al Qaeda.

		<p>Let me go deep down into some of the
prescriptions and highlighting some of these

prescriptions I think are important. The first
one, not only understanding the threat, we have to
continuously reevaluate the threat itself in
adjusting our response not only internally but also
globally.

		<p>Another issue we need to counter with
great urgency is the issue of identity theft. Not
only is this a problem within the United States but
also has been the basic building blocks for al
Qaeda to function without philanthropic donations,
without official donations on a large scale. And
we need to work harder on this issue because if
there is one common theme that we see, it's the
issue of identity theft. And we saw some of those
9/11 hijackers utilizing that in order to not only
gain entry into the United States but also to
garner requisite resources.

		<p>The second issue I want to highlight is
countering terrorism finance. Now more resources
need to be expended in a more coordinated fashion
on the financial front in the war against
terrorism.

		<p>Now beyond the existing goal and efforts
to deny terrorist groups access to the
international system, to impair their ability to
fundraise in different theaters of operations and
also, of course, to expose and incapacitate the
financial networks used by terrorists, more focused
global coordination is needed.
		<p>We need better trained, we need
multilingual financial analysts, and accountants
are crucial. Closer knit multi-agency
coordination is vital to monitor the changing means
and contours of terrorist finance and how it flows
as they provide vital -- and I would take this sort
of as a measure from the European perspective, if
one can't follow the contours of the organization,
a good way is to follow how the finance flows in,
understand how it's structuring, how it's changing,
how it's adapting to the security measures.
However, it is a simple and true reality that
terrorist finances flow far quicker in the
international financial system than any one
law-enforcement agency can react to.

		<p>Operationally, linking funds in one
country with a terrorist crime in another is
extremely difficult to prove in a court of law, let
alone tracking the money in today's international
financial system. We have to focus and we have to
look at the nexus not only between terrorism but
also between organized crime.
		<p>There are numerous black holes that we
need to address, numerous areas of sustained areas
of lawlessness that fuel and that feed the ability
of terrorism to garner resources and operational
capacity. And I can think of not only areas
continuing in the Middle East, even in Eastern
Europe, the former Soviet Union, but also in
America's own back yard in Latin America.
		<p>Apart from that, we also need to
understand how al Qaeda works, not only as an
organization but also in assessing their
terrorist-attack mode, understanding the
psychological makeup of the terrorist and
decision-making procedures and how do they
identify, how do they gather intelligence of

potential targets, how do they select peculiar
attack modes.
		<p>And that is urgently needed. We need to
centrally collate lessons learnt from intelligence
gathering, from interrogations, from military
manuals and from identifying weaknesses in our own
critical infrastructure.
		<p>Now instituting protection of our nuclear
power stations, providing protection and security
of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear
weapons against attack and theft, while also of
course overall improving our response and
resilience towards the use of these weapons, is
absolutely critical.
		<p>Insufficient degrees of physical
protection, security of chemical and biological
facilities in the former Soviet Union and
elsewhere, coupled with the availability of
freelance scientific expertise, increases the
spectre of catastrophic terrorism.
		<p>Now even if al Qaeda may be far away, or
may be close to the using or succeeding in using

what I call a CBRN attack, it is very clear that
the media also will play a critical role in
allaying the broader psychological effects for the
public, with or without major fatalities.
		<p>It is still questionable whether there are
sufficient contingency plans in coordinating public
information between the public contingency offices
in any country and major media outlets, yet the
framework for this type of coordination will be
absolutely critical in mitigating the effects of
such an attack, both in terms of dissemination of
public advice but also in ensuring infrastructure
and societal economic continuity.
		<p>Let me finish off by saying that the new
terrorism represented by September the 11th
presents special and new urgent challenges to the
West and international community, especially not
only to the United States, but to Europe. In
Europe right now there is a feeling that there's a
question of not if but rather when terrorism
globalization and weapons of mass destruction may
be fused into one, an attack will be imminent.

		<p>The fundamental first step but also
critical step is building on lessons learnt, on
cross-border cooperation, in looking at U.S.
counterterrorism in a global arena. And we have to
understand the changing nature of the threat
itself. The United States has made significant
inroads in readdressing weaknesses inside the
United States but also outside, not only overtly
but also covertly, in building a tremendous
multilateral intelligence cooperation with many
different countries.
		<p>But the simple lesson is that the United
States, if it wants to protect itself for the long
term, cannot do this alone. It needs allies. It
needs multilateral cooperation. This is not a war
on terrorism, it's a ceaseless struggle that goes
beyond any administration that will and should
remain at the heart of protecting the homeland
nationally and its interests abroad.
		<p>More than ever it is critically necessary
to prevent, coming back to what my fellow panel
members had mentioned before, not only to prevent

but also to preempt, beyond U.S. borders,
terrorist cells, otherwise, September the 11th may
repeat itself with potentially higher levels of
lethality.
		<p>Now as a testimony of the great strength
of New York City and the American people to
overcome but never to forget, we owe it to the
victims, their families and the country to be ever
vigilant in the face of evil, not only from the
U.S. perspective but also with those allies that
responded to the tragic events of September the
11th. Thank you very much.
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Thank you very much, Dr.
Ranstorp. Are there any questions from the
Commission? Senator Lehman?
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: I would like to ask
Professor Sofaer, the first part of your testimony
I found very compelling with regard to the vision
that stretched over a number of administrations
where prosecution and bringing the terrorists to
justice, and I believe Reagan used that term
numerous times as well, superseded and dominated

the sharing of information at the expense of that
prosecution, as I think you pointed out or in some
of the previous testimony, the Joint Investigation,
the CIA, sometimes DIA, sometimes learned important
intelligence only by reading the trial transcripts
of some of the 93 perpetrators.
		<p>As a former prosecutor and distinguished
legal advisor, could you get a little more specific
of how could we establish a procedure or a process
within the government to bring that a little more
back into balance so if it was necessary to perhaps
sacrifice a conviction in order to prevent a
disaster that that balance can be made on a
common-sense basis.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: With pleasure. I think what
the present government and the present Department
of Homeland Security has been trying to do,
Congress is trying to do right now, is overcome
those barriers. Once you adopt the criminal-law
model as your primary model, of course it has to be
part of any effort to prosecute criminals, but once
you adopt it as your primary model, a number of

very complicated things happen. Evidence that a
national-security strategist might think is very
important is treated as unimportant by someone who
wants to make a case. He's always thinking about
whether the evidence is admissible in a courtroom.
		<p>I mean, there are so many points like this
that support what you have just said, Secretary
Lehman. In general, what you have to do is
subordinate the interests in criminal prosecution
to the interests in protecting the country. And I
would think that that's a no-brainer.
		<p>We subordinate the interests of criminal
prosecution to Congressional investigations because
our public needs to know things and our legislators
need to know things. I would think that it would
follow from that premise that we would subordinate
the interests of criminal prosecution to the
interests of protecting the country.
		<p>And that needs to be done institutionally.
You need to have a body of some kind in Washington,
a counterterrorism center of some sort, that's
capable of doing that. And I must say, I don't

think that the combination of the CIA and the FBI
is that body. Frankly, it's the first evidence
I've ever seen of them cooperating effectively, and
that is in precluding the development of an
independent intelligence operation that would in
fact lead to the protection of the American people.
		<p>I have the highest regard for both
agencies, but to think that that is going to solve
the problem is a terrible mistake. And I think the
President was sold a bill of goods. I hope he
changes his mind and reconsiders and helps to give the Department of
Homeland Security
this authority to create a real counter-balance to
the interests of two agencies that have utterly
failed to cooperate and will continue to fail to
cooperate because they have radically different
agendas, and the underlying issues, as you pointed
out, aren't changing.
		<p>So you need to have, as you said, a
different institutional structure that puts in
place this notion of the nation's security as
preeminent. I do want to say that I think Attorney

General Ashcroft has made the protection of America
his chief priority but that still the agencies
under him are still geared to achieving
predominantly other things.
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: And it's not just
the federal. I think we would very much appreciate
on the Commission your giving further thought, in
your career combining policy with the
prosecutorial, to perhaps give us some
recommendations down the road for specific ways to
do this.
		<p>This is not just a federal problem. If a
New York cop who speaks Farsi picks up a piece of
intelligence and is involved in a case, the
district attorney can put it under seal and it's
gone into the mole hole until that case is
resolved.
		<p>And saying we're going to put national
security ahead of prosecutions. It's all fine, it's
motherhood, but if we don't have specific
procedures and changes to recommend, then it's just
so much hot air.

		<p>DR. SOFAER: Can I get a little help from
the Rand Institution? I mean, I'd like an office
there and a little bit of an opportunity to consult
with some of the experts. That's a wonderful
subject and I'm very serious in suggesting that it
will take some, several talented people to put
together a detailed plan of the kind you're talking
about.
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: That leads right
into another theme that all three of you have
touched on, and that is the sharing of
intelligence. And all through the post-9/11
period, some people have pointed to MI-5 as a
better way of dealing with this contradiction
between law enforcement and intelligence.
		<p>I would be interested if each of you could
tell the Commission, either now or later, after
further reflection, what other examples, in your
experience, in Europe and elsewhere in the world,
where they're getting it right and we're getting it
wrong in the handling of counterterrorism, not just
intelligence, but across the board.

		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Could I comment on this?
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Yes.
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: I think there's a great
sort of reflection of what went wrong in 9/11 from
the U.S. perspective, but let's make one thing very
clear. This was not just a U.S. problem, this was
a problem that we had in Germany. I mean, the
German intelligence had these cells under
investigation, dating back to 1998.
		<p>However, the legislation was not up to
speed in what kind of adversary we were facing.
The same with Britain. I mean, the only country
that I can think of that has had it right is a
country, France, which have had very much
less-restricted laws in terms of dealing with the
problem of Islamic radicalism, but that is of
course at the expense of civil liberties.
		<p>So when we look at this issue, we cannot
just look at it from the U.S. perspective, we have
to look at it from a global perspective,
particularly with our European allies who
constituted part of this coalition, but also

front-line defense.
		<p>It's no accident, first of all, that 15 of
the hijackers were from Saudi Arabia, given al
Qaeda and bin Laden's desire to create the
response, vis-a-vis United States and Saudi, nor is
it an accident that they stationed themselves in
Germany having analyzed, having probed, having
known exactly where the weakness is.
		<p>We know that from the interrogations. We
know that from having the benefit of the doubt of
the interrogations, the evidence that we had in the
past that we're dealing with an exceptionally savvy
adversary who would know and understand our
weaknesses.
		<p>And therefore, I would be hesitant to sort
of try to import a model like MI-5 into the United
States. Rather, we have to rely, and we're doing
that now, we're getting things right in terms of
counterterrorism cooperation not only between the
United States and European allies, but more
importantly, with friendly Arab allies who have
provided invaluable information and assistance in

not only understanding al Qaeda but also what may
come after al Qaeda.
		<p>And therefore, I think that my
recommendation, as a foreigner to this country, and
having looked at this problem for a long time, is
that we have to not only look at this problem from
a U.S. perspective in trying to get the modalities
right in terms of the structure, but also looking
at how can we overcome the intelligence-sharing
issues that, despite September the 11th, still
plagues some of the cooperation, even among our
most valued allies, in other words, the
prioritization of intelligence.
		<p>MR. JENKINS: Mr. Secretary, I'd like to
take you up on your offer to have an opportunity to
reflect on that more, but let me just make a couple
of comments which are perhaps sobering comments.
		<p>First of all, if you ask people, you know,
should we have something like an MI-5, a lot of
people will say, yes, and then you ask what is it,
and they haven't the vaguest idea. So there's some
mystique about this notion. The fact is, most of

the Western European nations, many of the nations
around the world, do have more than one
intelligence service. They do divide their
responsibilities.
		<p>The British have MI-5 and MI-6. The
Germans have their intelligence service, the Bundes
Criminal Amt, the Bundesamt fur Verfassungsschutz,
to deal with different aspects of intelligence.
The French divide it. The Italians divide it.
That is a common feature for very, very good, good
reason.
		<p>The problem of intelligence, of sharing
among intelligence agencies, is chronic. Creating
another entity may be a solution, but it doesn't
automatically mean that intelligence will be
shared. Instead of having two rival agencies, we
can create three and four rival agencies. Simply
sharing information, to most intelligence services, is
an unnatural act.
		<p>The third point I'd like to make is that I
am willing to concede that we can learn a great
deal from the intelligence services of the European

countries, many of whom have dealt with terrorist
threats on their turf longer than we have dealt
with it here. At the same time, we have to keep in
mind again the realities.
		<p>It took the British 15, 20 years to
effectively penetrate the IRA. There were still
surprises. Large bombs went off in the heart of
London. That's dealing with an adversary that
speaks roughly the same language, and not something
headquartered in distant Afghanistan. So we want
to be careful about that.
		<p>Final point, and it relates to something
that Magnus had said which I think is important.
We do have to figure out how to create capability
at an international level. We have achieved since
September 11th an unprecedented degree of
cooperation among intelligence services of a number
of countries in going after al Qaeda.
		<p>What we have to figure out how to do now
is how to institutionalize that and to create
permanent machinery and procedures that will allow
us to orchestrate -- and I use the word orchestrate

here -- traditional law enforcement, intelligence
collection, responses, whether in the form of
arrest, special operations, or application of
military force, and to do that across the globe in
a very, very effective way, since this is the type
of adversary we're going to be dealing with.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: Could I just add one thing,
Mr. Secretary, and that is that I hope you did pay
a little bit of attention to what I said, where we
can drive ourselves nuts trying to come up with
different ways to figure out everything about
everybody that might attack us, when and where
they're going to do it.
		<p>The fact of the matter is that we have
excellent strategic intelligence. And Dan Byman is
absolutely right about that. We knew who was going
to attack us, we knew where he was, we knew he
could do it. And we knew he wanted to do it and
was determined to do it. And how much more do you
need to know before you actually do something to
stop an enemy?
		<p>I hope that you won't be offended that I

repeat that. I just think that there is a tendency
among us all, we're all civilized people, we all
sort of tend to get drawn into this game of trying
to manipulate things around so somehow we can make
the world safe without raising a hand in violence
or anger, but ultimately -- and that's the right
attitude -- but ultimately, when it's pretty clear
you're not going to talk someone out of wanting to
kill you that you have to do something about him.
		<p>And when I hear stuff about the Middle
East and Israel and stuff, I just, obviously I have
always been, I've worked hard on Israel peace
issues. When I was in the department, Chairman
Hamilton, you remember that we worked together on
many things involving Iran and we showed our good
will in many ways to these countries, but can you
imagine that a peace treaty between Israel and the
Palestinians would be anything but anathema to
these people, these people who hate us?
		<p>The last thing they want is a peace
treaty between Israel and the Palestinians. They
would be determined to destroy it, to tear it down.

Go read what Islamic jihad says. They're our next
enemy, Islamic jihad. And I'm telling you, they
have told us they want to kill us. They have
already started doing it.
		<p>And we have to pay attention to these few
organizations that are around the world who are
determined to attack us for the reasons that these
gentlemen have so brilliantly articulated.
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: That leads into
another question, Professor Ranstorp. You're a
well-known expert on Hizbollah, for instance, and
other groups. As Mr. Jenkins has so well
elucidated, this, what we call al Qaeda, is really
a set of or an archipelago of groups, some that
will last a short time, some a long time.
Hizbollah has lasted a very long time.
		<p>How would you describe the relationship
today between Hizbollah, Hamas, the group that just
got hit up in northern Iraq, and these other parts
of the archipelago and how much should we focus on
them, as well as the core of al Qaeda?
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Mr. Secretary, a very good

question. It's a very broad question. I think we
have to understand that al Qaeda is one of three
things, first of all, before I address the issue of
Hizbollah.
		<p>First of all, at the higher level, we're
talking about an organization that have command and
control structure. It's very organized. We have
made major dents into the organization. We
understand it.
		<p>The second level, which is probably the
largest level, we have those working in the service
of al Qaeda, those concerted groups who are
operating on a national level, trying to confront
not just the United States but also their own
regimes and trying to effect regime changes.
		<p>Thirdly, we have those that are inspired
or are sympathetic to the means and modes of al
Qaeda. In terms of the cooperation between the two
groups, there's very little corporation, there has
been some.
		<p>In terms of Hizbollah itself, I would
recommend to divorce Hizbollah as a movement and

those individuals who have been part of Hizbollah's
past, who I would more characterize as half Iranian
intelligence agents and half Hizbollah operatives,
who are standing with one foot in Iran and one foot
in Hizbollah, who the United States is pursuing
with extraordinary vigor.
		<p>The movement itself knows it may be on the
sort of third phase on the war against terrorism.
It's exceptionally sensitive to that issue. It is
of course bounded up into the U.S.-Iranian dynamic
in terms of its relationship, but it is of course
an organization with global reach.
		<p>I mean, it's an organization just like al
Qaeda, if one disturbs the bee hive, they may come
back at us. We have to treat this issue with
extraordinary care. Otherwise, we may be in for
possibly retaliation from the organization.
		<p>In terms of other organizations, of course
there are other ones in Lebanon, not just Hizbollah
elements but also we have an organization called
Asbat al-Ansar. And certainly there were connections
between Asbat al-Ansar in Ein-el-Helweh, a refugee

camp, with Ansa al-Islam, and connections also to
the assassination of Lawrence Foley in Jordan. So
there were these loose connections that are more
based on logistical aspects than any common
ideology. So we have to treat this on a
case-by-case basis.
		<p>I wouldn't say that there is a
full-fledged cooperation between Hizbollah and al
Qaeda. They have different goals. They may focus
in on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as a mobilizing
tool, but certainly we should treat them as
separate. And Hizbollah certainly knows that they
may be the next face in the U.S. war on terrorism.
And they are very sensitive to that issue.
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Do they have any
current plans or operations that you're aware of
targeted in the United States?
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: I would say this, that
there are, there have been, according to my
assessment, according to my contacts and support,
that should there be a confrontation between the
United States and Iran, they could cause some

damage inside the U.S. mainland.
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: That raises a very
interesting dimension also that Mr. Jenkins had
raised, the fact that this is a kind of a
missionary organization and that it depends on
interrelationships and sponsors and sanctuaries.
		<p>What would your judgment be if we were
truly effective in draining the financial swamp, I
mean cutting off principally the Saudi money that
flows through various channels and through the
various foundation networks, if we were successful
in doing what Mr. Push had recommended so
eloquently earlier and really putting the heat on
those sources that like to have it both ways, would
that dry up al Qaeda and other groups, related
groups?
		<p>MR. JENKINS: Going after finances is
useful, to the extent that it can reduce some of
the resources that are available to these
organizations, that is of benefit. It is also,
quite separate from how much money you can dry up,
it is a source of useful intelligence itself, that

is, it tells us a great deal about connections
between various entities, so it has a separate
utility.
		<p>In terms of being able, however, to dry it
up enough to halt terrorist activities, that, I
must say, I'm somewhat skeptical of. To be sure,
the cash flow of organizations like al Qaeda was
significant, but a lot of that
money was used to support the Taliban, a lot of it
was used to support the training camps and
infrastructure in Afghanistan itself, which they no
longer have.
		<p>Can we squeeze it down enough to reduce
money to support actual terrorist operations? That
I'm less certain about because that, you know,
we're talking about estimates of the cost of
September 11th on the terrorists' side, we're
probably something in the area of a half a million.
A terrorist operation, major large-scale terrorist
operation, we're talking about something in the
hundreds of thousands.
		<p>Given the volume of money sloshing around

the world in legitimate and illegitimate channels,
through formal and informal structures, the notion
that we can squeeze it down into the
hundreds-of-thousands-of-dollars level, I'm not so
sure we can do that.
		<p>So we can put a dent in these
organizations, we can make the support that they
provide for some of these more radical movements,
proselytization activities, support for some of
these madrassas, we can do that. Can we deny the
money necessary to buy the bombs, to recruit the
people to carry out these attacks? I'm a lot less
certain about that.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: I'm not sure we can close the
madrassas down. I mean, do you think about how we
would ever have the ability to close madrassas down
in western Pakistan?
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Money talks.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: Money talks, yeah, but I
don't know how this country could go along and
convince the government of Pakistan to do that when
the people of Pakistan want those madrassas.

		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: But are they not
supported by the Saudis financially?
		<p>DR. SOFAER: I'm sure. I'm sure they are.
I'm sure they are.
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: Is there nothing we
can do there?
		<p>DR. SOFAER: Oh, we can do plenty, I just
think there's a limit.
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Mr. Secretary, if I may
add, beyond the philanthropic aspects of this, let
me say that I have looked into every single arrest
in Europe and beyond. The common feature is what I
outlined as the number-one issue, and that was,
every time you catch an al Qaeda suspect or al
Qaeda operative, you will have 15 to 20 different
identities.
		<p>Through these, he can easily, with or
without Saudi or other financing, be able to garner

the requisite resources, the building blocks of
being able to launch terrorism through credit-card
fraud, bank fraud. And that's an issue what we
need to tackle with great urgency if we're going to

be able to find these individuals, to weed them
out, and to put a stop to this preemptively.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: It isn't, Mr. Secretary, if I
may say, it isn't the teaching of Islam that we
should be trying to prevent or inhibit. It's the
teaching of one type of Islam, the Wahhabi type
brand of Islam. So if we can modify our effort and
narrow it and target it to those uses of funds that
threaten us as human beings and appeal to Muslims
in the world and say, 'stop teaching your children
to kill us,' that is really what we want you to do.
		<p>Teach Islam, go ahead, but that branch of
Islam, if we can narrow it, then we might succeed
because if the Islamic world sees this as an effort
to squeeze the financing of Islamic institutions,
we will never get anywhere.
		<p>COMMISSIONER LEHMAN: One last question.
How close is al Qaeda to having usable weapons of
mass destruction? I'd like to hear it from all of
you.
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Well, I was asked by CNN,
when they found the terrorist tapes, to come and

analyze them, the so-called dog tapes, it was
visual representation of the fact that they were on
their way to using chemical agents.
		<p>I think al Qaeda is very close to, and
particularly in two spheres, number one, the ricin
arrests we have had in Europe, we have had them for
about a year and a half, I mean, we have known
about this issue for a year and a half, over a year
and a half, since 9/11.
		<p>And it's not a weapon of mass destruction,
it's a weapon of mass disruption. It would have
huge economic consequences, psychological
contingent of fear.
		<p>Perhaps more worrying is al Qaeda and al
Qaeda elements in the former Soviet Union are
searching for radiological material. And you have
those two elements. On the one hand, chemical
agents, that there's a program, an active program
to try to acquire them and to also possibly deploy
them. On the other hand, you have a lot of
radiological material.
		<p>And in many ways I think the prevailing

view in Europe among security officials that I have
spoken to is that it is not a question of if but
rather when that they are deployed, perhaps not in
the United States, but possibly in Europe.
		<p>MR. JENKINS: Depending on how you define
weapons of mass destruction, in fact they have
them, I mean, we know that they have chemical
capabilities and biological capabilities. The
construction of a radiological dispersal device
takes nothing more than some source of
radioactivity, which is readily available in
society, and some explosive or other means of
dispersing it.
		<p>If we're talking about using those on a
scale that would create mass destruction, mass
casualties, then they're probably far, far from
that, but as Magnus points out, the issue here is
not the body count but rather the effects. We
should perhaps be talking about weapons of mass
effect.
		<p>That is, if we go back to the incident in
Tokyo and the attack involving nerve gas in Tokyo

subways, 12 people died in that attack, 5,500 were
treated at hospital as a consequence of that. Of
those 5,500, 1,200 were actually exposed to the
chemical. The other 4,700 were illnesses brought
about by anxiety, I mean real heart attacks, real
respiratory problems, asthmatic attacks,
psychosomatic attacks. And that's something that
we would have to expect.
		<p>Simply by mentioning the words biological
or nerve gas or radioactivity in the same sentence
with terrorism is going to get us some real effects
here. So the issue is not whether they can carry
out the terrorist equivalent of a Chernobyl or a
Bhopal, but rather simply how they could use these
in order to create a tremendous amount of fear,
alarm, national panic, and economic disruption.
		<p>I mean, we remember from our own
experience, which is not al Qaeda connected, but
with the anthrax letters that we experienced in the
fall of September 2001, five people were killed,
but we closed down a portion of a Senate office
building for months while we tried to get things

down to the 'manageable number of spores,' I think
was one of the quotes.
		<p>If we talk about a major transportation
system or a major commercial property, I'm not
quite sure what the public reaction would be to the
manageable number of spores. It's going to have
tremendous psychological consequences, not just
biochemical.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: I would just add one remark,
one comment to what my colleagues have said, Mr.
Secretary, Mr. Chairman, and that is that you
should not consider the potential of al Qaeda or
terrorist groups to use these weapons on their own.
You have to take into account the potential of
cooperation with a state.
		<p>We have on the record, in the last year
and a half or so, two statements that I consider
highly significant. One is by former Prime
Minister Rafsanjani where he suggests that a
nuclear device in Tel Aviv would put an end to
Israel, whereas a nuclear device in the Arab world
would simply take some casualties and they'd get

over it and move on.
		<p>And another statement and most recently
made by the former Head of Intelligence of
Pakistan, General al Haq, where he said essentially
the same thing, we could use a nuclear device and
put an end to Israel.
		<p>Most of this, both these comments were
directed at Israel, but clearly the option is
always there of going to a terrorist group if you
are hostile to the United States or any other
western country, including Israel, and having them
do your dirty work and providing the terrorist with
the ability to do that. Indeed, that is probably
the ultimate fear that we have to confront.
		<p>MR. JENKINS: I'm going to take exception
to the comments of my colleague on that point. I
am not absolutely convinced that national
governments, even those we may identify as rogue
states, are so ready to put weapons of mass
destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, things
that have signatures, in the hands of groups they
do not absolutely control. They would bear the

consequences.
		<p>And indeed, I think this is, however, the
point where probably Abe and I would find common
ground on this, that we can affect this by policy.
We can ensure that people well understand that we
will take appropriate action to deal with that,
whether it's action after the fact or whether it's
action before the fact, that will be treated, that
the notion that this can be done with some
successful degree of subterfuge through some
terrorist operative and that that will necessarily
fool us or deter us from going back to the source,
I think in wake of the headlines we're looking at,
as we speak, that becomes a fairly credible
argument. So as I say, we affect that by our
policy.
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Mr. Secretary, may I sort
of continue beyond the state using those types of
weapons. What concerns security and policy-makers
in thinking about al Qaeda for the future is
possibly not so much what is happening right now --
because we have a very good handle on that, there's

an unprecedented coordination among 90 countries --
it's the potential for al Qaeda or post-al Qaeda to
become an incubator of specific states, I'm
thinking particularly about the consequences of,
for example, Pakistan.
		<p>We've got al Qaeda eventually taking over,
post-Al Qaeda taking over other structures like
Saudi. So al Qaeda is very patient. What
represents al Qaeda is very patient, thinking about
strategy over the long term.
		<p>I think we equally have to craft
strategies. They are thinking about these issues
over the long term. It is not going to be easy
decades ahead, but I hope we will be able to
prevent another catastrophe that we had like here
in New York City.
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Congressman Roemer?
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Well, in his usual
fashion, Secretary Lehman has thoroughly delved
into a host of the very important topics here. And
let me just merely try to follow up on a couple of
them while we have your very helpful expertise and

counsel and insight before us.
		<p>With respect to the body count and the
number of people that terrorists are willing to
take, kill, especially as we reflect back on
September 11th, let me read a quote:
"Terrorists want a lot of people watching
and a lot of people listening and not a lot of
people dead."
		<p>I read that not to embarrass anybody, not
to, you know, try to throw that around at all.
It's a quote from 1975. It's a quote from one of
the panelists. And it is very, very perceptive in
showing how much terrorists have changed. And Mr.
Jenkins and I talked a little about that before the
hearing. It has been a monumental change in what
terrorists can do with what they have access to do
and what they are willing to do.
		<p>Mr. Jenkins, you said that back in 1975.
It was very accurate back then. Why do you think
it has changed to such a degree today?
		<p>MR. JENKINS: Well, I am the culprit. And
I believed it then. And in fact I think for many

of the groups, even groups that we would label
terrorists today, that that still applies. That is
so long as an enterprise thinks in terms of a
political ideology or a political agenda, that's
what we were talking about in the 1970s when I
wrote that, so long as there's a sense of political
agenda, then there's a sense of political
constituency.
		<p>And that imposes constraints that we
recognized in the 1970s that terrorists, using
primitive weapons that we knew they had, weapons of
explosives, weapons of fire, could kill a lot more
people than they did. And yet they didn't do so,
not because of some technological ceiling, it had
to be because of some self-imposed constraint. And
over a period of time, through interrogation of
terrorists and interviews in prisons, through trial
testimony, we learned what those constraints were.
		<p>They worried about group cohesion, not all
of whose members might have the same stomach for
violence. They worried about their perceived
constituents. They always imagine themselves to

have legions of supporters. They wanted to provoke
public alarm but not to provoke so much backlash
that would change the rules and threaten their own
survival.
		<p>And therefore, terrorists have a notion of
some kind of a red line, some type of a line beyond
which the violence would be counter-productive.
		<p>Now those constraints were not universal and they
were not immutable. And over a period of time,
they changed. And they changed in part because, as
terrorism became commonplace, there was a built-in
requirement to escalate.
		<p>Hijacking airliners may get you a headline
in 1971. When you're up to the 150th hijacking,
you're page 5 news. So they had to escalate. But
I think the real change, the qualitative change
that came about, that was referred to as a
so-called new terrorism in the late '80s and 1990s
was the decline of ideology as a driving force for
political violence, and increasingly, either ethnic
hatreds or religious fanaticism.
		<p>Now if one believes that instructions to

act, instructions to kill, are handed down from
God, however that God may communicate with an
individual, then you really don't worry about the
constraints of conventional morality, you don't
worry about constituents on this planet. They are
infidels or pagans or nonbelievers who will burn in
hell anyway.
		<p>And it is that, the fundamental change in
the quality of terrorist violence, so that by the
1990s, large-scale indiscriminate violence was
becoming increasingly the reality of contemporary
terrorism.
		<p>Now projecting that is scary because what
it means, if the willingness is there because of
technological advance, that power, power I mean
crudely, simply is the capacity to kill, to
destroy, to disrupt, to alarm, to oblige us to
divert vast resources to security, that that is
descending into the hand of smaller and smaller
groups whose grievances, real or imaginary, it's
not always going to be possible to satisfy.
		<p>Putting that another way, the bands of

fanatics, irreconcilables, lunatics that have
existed throughout history, are becoming in our age
an increasingly potent force to be reckoned with.
And how we, as a society, as a democratic society,
are going to successfully cope with that and remain
a democratic society to me is one of the major
challenges of this century.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: So your argument is,
quite simply, constraints are coming off, the
technology is going up, and we can't afford even a
single mistake, given that these terrorist groups
could get access to the kind of weaponry that their
ambition already has them seeking to get.
		<p>MR. JENKINS: Exactly.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: You talked a little
bit, you talked a little bit in your testimony
about how we got it so wrong throughout the 1990s
in calculating the enemy. Al Qaeda's vision, al
Qaeda's organizational capabilities, al Qaeda's
money and fundraising.
		<p>The Clinton administration didn't get it
right, they got it wrong in a lot of ways. The

Bush administration didn't get it right, they got
it wrong in a lot of ways. The Europeans, the same
thing.
		<p>I can't help but recall the words from one
of the counterterrorism chiefs in the Joint Inquiry
hearings of the FBI who said he was 98 percent
certain in 2000 that the attack would come from
overseas and be overseas and it wouldn't be in the
United States. We not only got it wrong, there was
no hand-off to get it right domestically. And if
you might comment on how we do get it right in the
future.
		<p>Mr. Jenkins, you talked a little bit about
an intriguing proposal, with 15,000 to 18,000 local
sheriffs and police officers that could help us get
it right at the local level.
		<p>Could you flush that out a bit more and
talk a little bit more in detail about that, and
would that replace what the Bush administration has
proposed a T-TIC center [Terrorist Threat Investigation Center] here, or
work with
them; how would that work together as a fusion
center in getting information out to the local

people?
		<p>MR. JENKINS: That is simply one among
many proposals. It's a rough-and-ready response.
We're talking about needing a lot more collection
capability on the streets. And that is one
approach to getting it. I'd say it probably gets
us there faster than the creation of a new federal
agency and the deployment of additional federal
agencies, but by itself, it's not going to work.
		<p>Here we have to really address a broad
variety of proposals, some of which have been
discussed in this panel. Part of the problem, as
has been mentioned, in terms of the FBI's
unwillingness to share information relating to
investigations that might ultimately result in
prosecution, that itself reflects a trajectory in
our domestic-intelligence capabilities over the
years.
		<p>In the 1960s, much more of the FBI's
counter-intelligence efforts in what we would call
terrorist-related crimes was aimed at prevention,
but because of abuses that were recognized in the

1970s, we imposed new rules, new constraints, that
basically said at the federal level, and these were
repeated at the state and local level, we don't
want intelligence in the prevention business
anymore. We want you in the prosecution business,
that the prevention business is just too intrusive
in a free society. So we imposed new guidelines in
the bureau, at the state level. These were
repeated by police commissions throughout the
country.
		<p>By the beginning of the '80s, it was
recognized that perhaps some of these constraints
were having a serious impact on
intelligence-collection capabilities, and so they
were relaxed somewhat, began to swing a little bit
the other way, but really there was at the same
time, there was a perceived decline in the
terrorist threat domestically in this country. And
so in fact, because they were difficult to manage,
because they were politically risky, because they
were in some cases costly to operate, we continued
to dismantle domestic-intelligence capabilities.

		<p>That reversed somewhat in the 1990s as we
began to perceive a more serious threat again, but
we really didn't rebuild the capabilities. And it
wasn't until September 11th that we recognized we
had a failure of intelligence in terms of looking
at this. When I say, "failure," I want to put that
in quotes. I am not one who believes that if we
had had just a little better intelligence
collection, we could have connected the dots, as
the phrase goes. This is very, very tough.
		<p>When you read the last page of a mystery
novel first and then read the novel, all of the
clues are obvious. Going forward, it's a lot more
complicated than that. But we probably can do it
better. Now that we have pushed back into the
prevention business, then that should allow us to
more easily share some of this information across
lines without some of the constraints imposed by
prosecution, which was the real constraint. So
sharing has to be made better.
		<p>The analysis does have to get there and
does have to get better. We also have to keep in

mind that we can't judge intelligence solely on the
basis of identifying and preventing an attack. Of
course we're going to do that, but intelligence is
also aimed at disrupting your opponent's capability
to operate.
		<p>We don't know how many attacks we may have
thwarted since September 11th. It's a good many.
And we can identify some clearly, but there may be
many more that were aborted because of increased
security or because of good intelligence that we
will find out about years from now when we catch
more of these people and interrogate them.
		<p>Better sharing, better analysis, better
mechanisms across national frontiers, to work more
closely with our allies, take advantage of this
unprecedented cooperation I mentioned before.
		<p>When we can get a good flow of information
from the streets of our cities across to, whether
it is an investigating magistrate in France or an
intelligence operative in the Middle East, and
begin to assemble that kind of information and
analyze it and repackage it and send it back out to

users, whether it's a policeman on the beat or a
judge in Italy or a Special Forces Team in
Afghanistan, then we will be getting close to the
kind of capability we need to deal with this kind
of problem. That's going to take a couple, a few
years.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: More than a few
years, I would suspect. Several years. Professor,
you talked a little bit about the problems of
communication and information sharing between the
CIA and the FBI. The Joint Inquiry's findings
agree very much with those systemic and endemic and
ongoing problems.
		<p>How do you fix it? Do you create more
agencies to do it and more stove-piping? How do we
get either those agencies to talk to one another
and share information or do you create this new
Terrorist Threat Integration Center? Where do you
put it, Homeland Security or outside of it? How do
they communicate with the local people? Give me
some tangible suggestions here.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: You're really in good shape.

Your Executive Director happens to be the former
Executive Director of the Markle Commission, a
Commission Task Force Report on this very subject.
And he was the principal author, Philip Zelikow was
the principal author of that report.
		<p>And that report does a lot to move policy
in the right direction on those issues. They're
very complicated. And the Markle Commission is
continuing its work and trying to develop a sort of
a distributed intelligence framework where you have
less top-down evaluation, the kind of thing that
Brian had suggested earlier with the New York City
police force and the other local police forces, but
on an intelligence, computer-based intelligence
system.
		<p>I think it's very, very complicated and
important that it be done, but I think that's the
way it's got to be done, through experts. We've
got people in the room, I'm privileged to be on
that task force, who I don't even understand when
they start talking about distributed networks and
all these other things.

		<p>And they clearly have a handle on how to
use information and also how to control your
seeking of information so that you maintain civil
liberties. They have a handle on those issues that
is really highly sophisticated at this stage in the
private sector. And that's where we really have to
turn to them and ask them to guide us in these
very, very complicated issues.
		<p>But don't forget, Congressman, that when
you know who your enemy is and he's killed you a
few times, you can sort of skip the dots on a
particular incident and go take him out before he
comes back and kills our people again. Don't
forget that.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: There has to be an
offensive and a defensive strategy.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: Absolutely. That's right. I
think that it is very hard to keep, it's so hard to
keep the attention of commissions and government
officials away from this process of examination,
this going deeper and deeper into intelligence,
trying to figure out things.

		<p>There is a certain point at which that you
have figured it out, you know what the issue is and
who the enemy is. And when you get to that point,
when you can indict someone twice, he had been
indicted twice before 9/11, when you can do that,
my God, you've waited around too long. You already
solved the problem, you know who your enemy was.
You know he is going to come kill you.
		<p>I think this is an important point not
just for this case but for other cases. There
aren't that many big terrorist groups in the world.
There are some. And you have got here, with Brian
and Magnus, we've got here really two of the great
experts on this. Magnus has written the work on
Hizbollah. I mean, no one knows more about
Hizbollah in the world, I don't think, than Magnus.
		<p>And the fact of the matter is, there's
Hizbollah, there's Islamic jihad, you know, you can
make a list. It's not that long a list. And part
of what you should do to keep America safe is focus
on those people who say they hate us and they want
to kill us, because those are the guys who are

going to do it, Mr. Secretary.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Magnus, let me draw
you in here and ask for your international insight
into this.
You mentioned earlier about al Qaeda and
other terrorist organizations, but specifically, I
believe your words were that al Qaeda is dispersed
from Afghanistan, but they're still an organization
that has tentacles in a host of different places
and are very much able to attack us from where
they're going, whether that be in Indonesia or
Malaysia or other parts of the world.
		<p>Can you draw this out a little bit more
clearly for us in terms of how we expect they have
dispersed, where they are, and how this 90-country
international coalition continues to focus on this
international law on terrorism and what are the two
or three most effective ways to do that?
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Well, let me say that from
the American people's point of view, they can rest
assured, from the international perspective of what
I see, Europe, Europe's contribution, we have 500

people in custody in Europe in many, many different
countries, we have thwarted many plots, and that
is that we are getting things right.
		<p>Fortunately, unfortunately, 9/11 was the
wake-up call for that. It was a tremendous secret
war of intelligence hunters out there trying to
learn as much as possible about al Qaeda, about how
al Qaeda is changing from different regions.
And of course, it is very difficult. It
is not affected by the war against Iraq, rather,
those are institutional linkages that are already,
it's not affected in terms of the sharing and
cooperation between a number of countries.
		<p>There have been some countries that have
been tremendously helpful. Among them, of course,
Pakistan, but also Jordan, particularly Jordan's
role in contributing, and not only protecting
itself and its royal family, but also in
illuminating our understanding of how the al Qaeda
network works, alongside the Egyptians and other,
shall we say, coalition partners. So we are
getting things right, but there are also of course

tremendous challenges because they do exist.
		<p>Al Qaeda's network has a presence in over
98 different countries around the world. It has a
global reach. One of the areas we have not tackled
very much is in America's own back yard, Latin
America. We know that there has been some al Qaeda
presence there.
		<p>Of course, there are other problems there
as well. There's a sort of al Qaeda elements,
other Islamic extremist elements who are not only
dispersed in Latin America but of course the world.
		<p>It's a tremendously difficult issue.
And I think one of the issues and one of
the things that I put in my recommendation is that
we should coordinate our response, particularly
because terrorism is fusing together with organized
crime and even ordinary crime, that we should put
together our efforts, particularly within the U.S.
structures, of the war on terrorism as well as the
war on drugs, because as we speak right now, we
dealt with Afghanistan, it was a huge blow for al
Qaeda.

		<p>The issue of reconstruction in Afghanistan
is still a major issue. As we speak, there are
Taliban and al Qaeda suspects flooding back into
Afghanistan or using a large portion of the
country. It's a lawless zone. It's a blind spot
in this war of terrorism.
		<p>And it's not just Afghanistan, it's not
just in certain portions of Iran, it's not just the
fact that Iran has facilitated al Qaeda transit out
of that area. There are large proportions in the
world where we do not have effective central
authority, where the authority does not have the
capability. And the United States have been not
only hunting down al Qaeda cells but also providing
antiterrorism assistance.
		<p>The United States is the only country with
global intelligence reach on a tremendous level.
And I think that, you know, we may want to sort of
do an inventory of how we can do things better, but
I think that we have gone a long way of ensuring
that al Qaeda will at lease not strike with ease
against the American homeland or against U.S.

citizens abroad.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: You mentioned the
need for central authority. I think a half a dozen
commissions throughout the 1990s have recommended
the creation of a Director of National
Intelligence, somebody with centralized power and
authority within the intelligence community that
has the responsibility for a budget, that can
implement policy and, if they declare a war on
terrorism or al Qaeda, they have the resources to
marshal the intelligence community forward to get
it done.
		<p>Six or seven commissions have recommended
it. We are probably moving in the other direction,
in reality, from accomplishing that.
Do you have views on whether or not,
Professor, should we create a DNI, Mr. Jenkins, Mr.
Ranstorp?
		<p>DR. SOFAER: I'm not sure we should, Mr.
Congressman. I think that our reluctance to be
strong and act positively, actively in our self
defense leads us sometimes to overwork on the

passive measures to the point that we do create
real threats to our civil liberties.
I think that an active defense would
facilitate, in fact, less reliance on internal
control of our own citizens. And so I worry about
setting up institutions in this country that would
change the nature of our life.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Mr. Jenkins?
		<p>MR. JENKINS: First of all, I thought at
one time we had created someone that was supposed
to be in charge of the intelligence community and
it didn't quite work out that way.
		<p>There's a tendency, by the way, to try to
approach a particularly gnarly problem like this
one by the creation of some sort of a czar. This
is a recurring theme in our governmental approach.
I'm not sure. I'm not going to make a powerful
argument against it, but I'm not automatically
convinced that it provides an answer that simply a
new organization or a new head of organization gets
us there.
		<p>There are rather procedural issues, there

are issues of imperative, there are issues of
incentives that I think we have to address quite
apart from the issue of government reorganization.
The fact is, my own view is that we do
have the basic building blocks now to do this
thing. We are making progress. We do have to
improve and we will improve as we go along. Every
time we create another entity, that may expand our
capabilities in one sense, but at the same time, it
becomes a distraction.
		<p>I mean, I'm not going to argue against the
creation of a Homeland Security Department.
Bringing together is a good idea, but at the same
time, how it is going to function, how it is
actually going to integrate them in this major
post-merger environment now that has been created,
and effectively operate, that becomes, that almost
tends to slow you down somewhat in terms of dealing
with the actual process that we want to deal with.
		<p>So as I say, I'm not going to argue against it, but
I'm not sure an Intelligence Czar or a
Counterterrorist Czar is automatically going to get

us there.
		<p>I do think, and this is a cultural
problem, it's not a government-organizational
problem, that we, being a very pragmatic nation,
that we like to view things in terms of finite
achievement -- there's a problem, we identify the
problem, we solve the problem, move on to the next
problem -- and that we are so desperate for closure
after September 11th that we're looking for some
way, organizationally, that we can put the lid on
this thing and say we have now solved that, we are
now moving on.
		<p>Instead what I think our message is here,
and I'm not putting words in the mouths of my
colleagues here, but that this is an open-ended
thing we're engaged in here. Our pursuit of al
Qaeda itself must be unrelenting. If it takes us
two years, if it takes us 20 years, this enterprise
must be destroyed to reduce its capabilities to
attack us and also as a lesson to other
organizations around the world, that if you do
this, this will be the response of the United

States and we will spend the rest of our lives
hunting you down.
		<p>At the same time, where we can
appropriately use the term "war", and I think
language needs to be precise here, where we can
appropriately use the term "war" for dealing with
an al Qaeda or its successors, that we're also
simultaneously engaged in an effort to improve the
security of our homeland against catastrophes like
9/11.
		<p>And as I pointed out here, that's going to
take certain kinds of strategies, both intelligence
strategies, response strategies, infrastructure,
the way we do security, to do it in a way that
doesn't cripple our own economy, that doesn't
create some sort of a neo-medieval society where we
spend the rest of our lives living under the
kitchen table.
		<p>At the same time, another court of our
activity must be to combat terrorism. Now here the
verb is important. Combat implies an enduring
task. We're going to do the things that we can

internationally to improve the exchange of
intelligence, to improve travel documentation, to
improve border security, aviation security, all of
the things, financial controls, all of the things
that we can do to make the environment
operationally more difficult for the terrorists,
whatever group they belong to.
		<p>We are doing all these things
simultaneously, some we will succeed. Ultimately,
we will destroy al Qaeda. These other tasks that
we're talking about, these are tasks that are going
to take years, probably decades.
		<p>And there will be other commissions to
follow this one that will be examining and making
useful contributions to improve things along the
way. But the notion that we can come up to some
moment and say, we have won, the terrorists have
lost, probably not in my lifetime.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Sir?
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: I think Brian echoed
exactly my sentiment in terms of looking at this as
a ceaseless struggle. I think there is, from the

outside, I have to preface my comments as being an
outsider, a foreigner to the United States, that
there's an over-tendency to look at trying to
hermetically seal the U.S. or immunize itself from
a future attack.
		<p>It's important that we do the work that
has been done so far in terms of homeland security,
in terms of the possibility of centralizing
intelligence, in making intelligence flow, not just
from the top between different agencies but also,
as Brian said earlier, more importantly, the front
line of defense, the local law-enforcement
officers, the police, equipping them with the right
equipment.
		<p>I think, thinking back, and I was in the
United States in 1998 on the day on which President
Clinton ordered air strikes against Afghanistan and
instituted some protective measures, in part to try
to protect the U.S. against what I would call
catastrophic terrorism, but I would have to say
this, that we have to balance our protective
measures, our defensive measures, with more

aggressive preemptive action.
		<p>I mean, logic would prevail that once they
start moving towards the target, we've already lost
half the battle. And therefore, we have to work on
multilateral cooperation, we have to work on making
it as difficult as possible, we have to create the
sense of insecurity for the adversary, for al
Qaeda, so that they're not able to plan
undisturbed, but they also have to worry about
their own security and the fact that they may
become apprehended by the U.S. in the future.
		<p>Therefore, I think, you know, we have gone
a long way towards getting it right. A lot of the
measures we don't see because they're occurring in
the quiet, occurring in the intelligence sphere.
Therefore, you know, on the one hand, we're
creating different structures and trying to
centralize different decisions, pooling
intelligence and intelligence analysis, but there's
a tremendous force, an unseen force out there that
are hunting these people down, that will seek
justice, no matter how long it will take.

		<p>And that goes not only for al Qaeda but
also for those forces that killed the U.S. Marines
in '93.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: At the end of the
day, this Commission will be about some
recommendations. And what I am hearing very
clearly from you is that part of those
recommendations might be in fact communicating to
the American people that this war, this combatting
terrorism, as Mr. Jenkins says, one needs the sense
of urgency that we have when our troops go into
Afghanistan or Iraq, and secondly, that this is
long-term, almost ceaseless struggle, that will
take a lot of time, that despite the
recommendations that this Commission makes in May
of 2004, al Qaeda may be out there in 2014. I see
you nodding.
		<p>MR. JENKINS: If not al Qaeda, the son of
al Qaeda or the grandson of al Qaeda or some other
enterprise.
		<p>Look, we have been dealing with terrorism,
fortunately not at the scale of 9/11, for many,

many years. And it's not because of an absence of
intelligent people who have been addressing this
topic, it's because this is a very, very big
challenge. This thing is going to go on. It's not
simply going to be a matter of how we can
reorganize our intelligence collection or how many
National Guardsmen we can deploy or how much
concrete we can pour around every identifiable
piece of critical infrastructure we have in this
country.
		<p>Ultimately, it is going to be our own
sense of urgency, our own tenacity, our own
determination, our own courage, to a certain
extent, our own stoicism about accepting that there
are going to be some failures, there are going to
be some losses, and in the process -- and I think
this is very, very important because it's long-term
and because we are America -- our own continuing
commitment to the values for which this country
stands.
		<p>It's not something that we can simply
reorganize, toss the values, forget the rules, and

go off and blast away and fix things up and come
back and restore the old rules and say we'll go
back to whatever normality was on September 10,
2001. We don't get to go back. It is a different
world. It is a long-term contest. And so we
better do it in a way that we can maintain the
sense of values.
		<p>I'm not saying we don't change the rules.
We can change rules. Every country that has dealt
with terrorism has been obliged to change the rules
of detention, of intelligence gathering, of trial
procedures, but the countries of Europe that have
done this, they have done this as democracies and
remained democracies.
		<p>We can do the same, but we cannot, we
cannot violate fundamentally those rules and
maintain the support we will need domestically and
internationally for what promises to be a long-term
struggle.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: I would agree with all that,
Mr. Congressman. I just want to say that I think
this Commission should make it clear that the duty

to protect and defend the American people includes,
very explicitly, the duty to go out and stop a
known enemy that has killed Americans from doing it
again, that that duty is a clear, precise duty.
		<p>You're not supposed to sit in Washington
with a bunch of experts trying to make dots and
connect ideas to figure out when someone is going
to kill you and where he's going to do it if you
know there's someone out there that is determined
to do it and capable of doing it and you know where
he is.
		<p>So this Commission should, I think, make
it clear that presidents don't have the option of
sitting back and playing that game, that part of
fighting terrorism is that when you know there's an
enemy who rises up to kill you, and the words that
should be familiar to all of us in all three of our
religions, that you rise up and kill him first.
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: I'm going to interrupt
this shortly because we have already kept our panel
more than we expected.
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: Thank you for your

patience.
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Do you have anymore
questions?
		<p>COMMISSIONER ROEMER: No, I'm all done.
Thank you very much. I want to thank the panel,
too. You've been terrific.
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Senator, you have a
question?
		<p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND: Mr. Jenkins, all of
you, you've been eloquent to a fault. Thank you
very much.
		<p>Mr. Jenkins, right at the end of your
incredible, wonderful presentation, you talked
about, in effect, defeating al Qaeda, that is a
specific goal, they did rise up to kill us and did,
and they declared war on us. And I couldn't agree
more. Then you went to combatting terrorism.
		<p>What that reminded me of was an experience
I had in Malaya, or now it's Malaysia. I was in
Vietnam, '67, '68, fighting guerillas, terrorists,
suicide bombers and the like, took a little R & R
in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and read a book called

The Long, Long War. It was about the British
experience in combatting guerrillas, terrorists,
suicide bombers. And one of the things they
learned was that the terrorist doesn't lose, he
wins. The terrorist doesn't lose, he wins.
		<p>So for those who came after us, you're
exactly right, and that's specific. We know who
did it and we must kill or capture them or else
they will do it again. What little I know about al
Qaeda, that is true. Within the combating of
terrorism, doing what you can in terms of strategic
offensive abroad, strategic defensive at home, that
is the long, long war.
		<p>What I want to pose to you is a couple of
problems with this. One of the problems is that in
terms of stirring up the bee hive, Mr. Ranstorp,
your point about the Hizbollah, it seems to me that
Osama bin Laden deliberately has stirred up the bee
hive to create an overreaction by Western
democracies, particularly America, so that we would
then trigger more recruits for his jihad.
		<p>In his declaration of war, for instance,

bin Laden states that the stationing of American
forces on the soil of the Arabian Peninsula
constitutes the greatest aggression committed
against the Muslims since the death of the prophet
Mohammed in AD 632. Well, we don't believe that,
but that's his rhetoric.
		<p>The point being, is it your understanding,
Mr. Jenkins, that to the extent to which we
increase our footprint on Arab soil, Muslim soil,
and appear to be the Crusaders of old trying to
take over Islamic lands, which fulfills his
rhetoric, that as we do that, we stand in
difficulty or difficult trouble, or potentially
potential trouble of creating really a backlash
against us and more terrorist activity?
		<p>Talk to me a little bit about it. We
created an air base in Saudi Arabia and one in
Iraq. We have a presence in the Middle East in
many, many ways. Talk to me a little bit about the
potential dangers that you see about increasing
what -- another article is called the Pax Americana
in the Middle East -- and how that could possibly

generate a greater terrorist threat ultimately in
terms of a backlash against us.
		<p>MR. JENKINS: This is not easy because
this is a balance and, as you know, policy is
always a matter of trade-offs. To not respond
forcefully to the events of September 11th, to me,
would have been unimaginable. In responding,
whether it's responding to September 11th or
whether it's what we are currently engaged in in
Iraq, clearly unavoidably, does raise risks. It
raises risks that our opponents will be able to
exploit these, we know they will, in order to
increase their recruiting.
		<p>So the challenge for us becomes can we
respond forcibly and effectively in a way without
signalling a desire for dominion, a desire for
Imperialist rule, a desire, communicating the
desire that we wish to remake the world in our, in
our image or in anything that suggests that we're
opposed to a religion. Now that is hard to do.
I'm not sure that there's a single formulaic answer
to that specific question.

		<p>By the way, the question to our opponents
would be unimaginable, it would be utterly bizarre
because while we may say that we're not engaged in
a war on Islam, correctly so in that we're not
interested in dominion and that we make separations
between what people believe and how they behave and
we respond to how they behave to us, these
bifurcations of a spiritual world of belief, of
political developments, are completely foreign to
them. This is all of a single piece. So can we
operate in this territory and do it.
		<p>In Afghanistan, although we're not home
yet in Afghanistan, in Afghanistan we were
successful. We used military force, we destroyed
al Qaeda bases. And there was no uprising of
Islam. There was no worldwide surge in terrorism
against us as a consequence, as a consequence of
this.
		<p>Now, as I say, we're not there yet. And
one of the things that we also have to figure out
how to do to ensure, and I think a mistake made the
first time around in dealing with Afghanistan is

that probably, without being Imperialists, we can't
afford to leave too many black holes on the planet,
can't afford to have too many badlands where these
type of things can find a petri dish they need to
grow and survive.
		<p>So we're going to have to actively go out
and, in one way or another, not always with Special
Forces or smart bombs or other applications of
military force, we're going to find out how to
address some of these.
		<p>That doesn't mean straying off into what
to me is illusions about addressing root causes.
It is not demonstrable that there's any causal
relationship between poverty and terrorism. We
will address, we will address poverty in the world,
we will address lack of education, we will address
political oppression because it's the right thing
to do, not because we have any illusions that it is
going to end terrorism.
		<p>As I say, in doing so, we run these risks,
but I think we have to take these one at a time and
get them right.

		<p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND: Mr. Ranstorp?
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: Connecting with what Brian
said, I think the environment is such that we're
moving towards greater complexity. I mean,
unfortunately, if you look at the Middle East, for
example, U.S. economists have estimated it will
take economic growth rate five times that of the
United States to get the region on an even keel.
		<p>There's been a youth explosion. There's
been demographic growth. There's no link between
poverty and terrorism, yet it's that environment
which so easily lends itself to certain radical
nodes of radical Islam. I think that we have,
following 9/11, we addressed many of those issues.
We are aware of them.
		<p>We do not have the capability of reaching
into so-called black spots. We're simply not
perhaps developing our own capabilities, but we're
outsourcing this. This is not just the United
States' problem, this is a Western problem, not
just a U.S. problem, but also a European problem.
And therefore, we're working hand in hand in trying

to alleviate this.
		<p>But we have tremendous challenges. I
think one of the issues particularly we have to
grapple with is the global feeling of
anti-Americanism, in using public diplomacy to much
greater effect, in thinking ahead about tactics and
strategies, explaining better to the world why
American is doing what it is doing.
		<p>And you can see that's happening now as an
integral part of the war against Iraq. In the war
against the hearts and minds and the war against
Islamic extremism, it's very difficult to do, but
it has to be done at some level. It has to be, it
has to be confronted.
		<p>I have spent 15 years working, mapping
Islamic extremists. And let me say that one of the
issues where it is both the strength and the
weakness which we have to tackle with greater
ingenuity and innovation is the issue of their
legitimacy. We have to tackle at the root heart
their legitimacy. And there are many ways one can
do that, but it will take a greater ingenuity. It

has to take greater effort. And it is not going to
be an easy road ahead.
		<p>COMMISSIONER CLELAND: Thank you, Mr.
Chairman. 
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Thank you. Mr.
Commissioner Ben-Veniste.
		<p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: I know it's
getting late.
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: This is going to be the
last question, just to let these people go.
		<p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: Also a biblical
expression. Both Judge Sofaer and Mr. Jenkins have
commented on the concept of creating a new domestic
intelligence agency from different perspectives.
Judge Sofaer, you have mentioned that you
opposed it, and one of the reasons that you stated
was because of the greater threat to civil
liberties. And Mr. Jenkins said that he thought
that the basic building blocks to do the work were
there.
		<p>And perhaps that ties into the
extraordinary presentation of Miss Kleinberg
earlier this morning. She talked about all of the

things that were missed by our intelligence
agencies that could have, in fact, on the basis of
information in hand, had they been working
cooperatively and done the work that was expected
of them, could have identified at least some of the
terrorists involved in 9/11.
		<p>I wonder whether you would each expand
upon that because one of the major objectives I
think we have in making our ultimate
recommendations will be related to whether a new
system of domestic intelligence should be
instituted or whether in fact we can make do with
what we have with significant improvement.
		<p>DR. SOFAER: I think the latter. I think
we can make do with what we have with significant
improvements. I think we ought to use DHS more
than going back to the FBI and CIA. I think that
we're not going to make much progress if we rely on
those agencies exclusively.
		<p>I think the list of failures and
opportunities that the Joint Committee has put
together with Miss Hill, her report has been very

impressive. And I can't imagine that the
Commission needs to spend a lot of time building on
that record.
		<p>I mean, it's just clear that we lost, we
missed a lot of opportunities. And I think we can
do a lot to correct that if we don't rely
exclusively on the same agencies that missed those
opportunities, incidentally, without any
accountability whatsoever. There's be no
accountability whatsoever for those missed
opportunities.
		<p>MR. JENKINS: Again, I think we could have
done it better prior to September 11th. I'm not
sure that that would have prevented the September
11th attack. I just don't know that. Putting
aside the issue of whether could have or could not
have identified the attack coming, how do we
approach this, how do we approach it now.
I notice that you used the word, can we
make the system better. I think you said system.
		<p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: That supposes a
fact that perhaps is not yet in evidence.

		<p>MR. JENKINS: That is, my point is that I
think there's a key word there that we want to
focus on, can we make this into a system and how do
we achieve that. It's not a question of can we
create another entity or not create another entity.
That, to me, is a tactical question, it's a
how-you-get-there question.
		<p>The root, how do we create a system out of
the capabilities that we have now and that we can
reasonably create? We can enhance those
capabilities. There's a variety of ways we can do
that, one of which I have indicated already, but
how do we procedurally, what is the machinery for
creating a system?
		<p>If that requires a new entity, then so be
it. I'm not convinced that it does yet, but I am
persuaded that we need to do something to bring
about a system.
		<p>COMMISSIONER BEN-VENISTE: Mr. Ranstorp,
do you care to comment?
		<p>DR. RANSTORP: No, I totally agree that
there has to be an integrated system. I think

we're on our way there. I think though within,
this is the European experience, within bearing in
mind civil liberties, I think that cannot be the
casualty of any system. I think protecting and
preserving them is something that we all cherish.
		<p>CHAIRMAN KEAN: Dr. Sofaer, Mr. Jenkins,
Mr. Ranstorp, thank you very, very much for the
enlightening discussion. We are adjourned until
9:00 tomorrow morning.
		<p>(Whereupon, at 5:10 p.m., the proceedings
were recessed, to reconvene at 9:00 a.m., Tuesday,
April 1, 2003.)</p><P ALIGN="center">
