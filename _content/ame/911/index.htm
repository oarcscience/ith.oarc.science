<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">9/11/2001: A REMEMBRANCE</H1>

<P>
One of the few good things that came out of the 9/11 tragedy
was a high-water mark for unity and religious tolerance in the United States.
At gatherings small and large Christians, Jews, Muslims and others
jointly offered prayers for the dead and for world peace.
In many communities, people of all faiths stood vigil to protect mosques.
This outpouring of ecumenical support far outweighed the few random
attacks on Muslims.
And Muslims worldwide condemned the attacks as a distortion of Islam.
This is worth remembering in light of subsequent events.
</P>
<P>
This page archives some key documents of the 9/11 attack, including
the list of casualties, and the report of the US government commission,
which was completed in 2004.

<P>
Shortly after the disaster, Intangible Textual Heritage received nearly a million
hits in one day, which was twenty times the normal traffic at that point.
This was primarily because of wild (and incorrect) rumors circulating via
email that Nostradamus had predicted 9/11. Fortunately, this site
has <A HREF="../../nos/index">a complete cache of Nostradamus in English and French</A> so it
was possible to refute the bogus quatrain that was being circulated.
In the process, though, I found another obscure quatrain that had a
certain resonance...
</P>
<P>
Another question which was being publicly debated was whether the
attacks were sanctioned by Islam.
As luck would have it, I was working on an etext of the Hadith,
which has numerous passages which clarify this question, so I accelarated
my work.
I posted the etext of the Hadith on October 9th, 2001.

<A HREF="700club">Remarks of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell, 9/13/2004</A>
<BR>
These embarrassing remarks by two prominent Evangelical (conservative)
Christian clergy caused quite a bit of criticism, by blaming Muslims in general,
as well as the ACLU and other liberal groups,
Pagans, feminists, gays and lesbians,
and (strangest of all) abortionists for 9/11.
Unfortunately for them, their little cracker-barrel bull session
was being aired on national TV.
Of course, these views should not be taken to represent
the attitude of the majority
of US Christians, or of any particular religious group, or of this site.
</P>

<BR>
<A HREF="bush0921">Speech of President Bush to joint session of Congress, 9/21/2001</A><BR>
In counterpoint, President George W. Bush, an Evangelical Christian
himself, to his credit, took care at the time to identify the real
source of the attacks, the terrorist group Al-Qaeda.
His remarks also stressed religious tolerance and
outreach to mainstream Islam.
This speech was only one of several he and other US political leaders
made at the time which sounded this theme.
