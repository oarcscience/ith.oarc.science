### THE DERIVATION OF FAMILY NAMES IS ALWAYS INTERESTING

A Knowledge of Family Names is not only of passing interest but may be
of great value to students and researchers. Names, as we know, undertake
to make many changes, even in the same family, even today.

"Pennsylvania German family names may be divided into three classes:
first, those derived from personal names; second, those derived from
occupation; and third, those derived from the place where the individual
lived (including house signs) or whence he came," says Kuhns, <span
id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) and "in this last class may likewise be
properly included nicknames, or those due to personal peculiarities,
physical or mental."

The smaller type following is an excerpt from Kuhns’ book:

These personal names exist today in Pennsylvania, some of them but
little changed; such are Albrecht: of distinguished race (P.G.
\[Pennsylvania Germans\] Albright); Arnwald: one who rules as the eagle;
Bernhard: strong as a bear; Conrad: bold in council; Dietrich: ruler of
people; Eberhart: strong as a boar; Eckert: strong sword; Garman:
spearman; Gebhard: generous giver (P.G. Kephart); Gerhard: stong spear;
Gottschalk: servant of God; Hartman: strong man; Heidrich: of noble
rank; Hildebrandt: battle-sword; Hubert: bright of intellect;
Irmintraut: friend of the Walkyrie Thrudr (P.G. Ermentrout); Lühr:
war-people; Reinhard: strong in counsel; Reinhold: ruler of council;
Trautman: follower of the Walkyrie Thrudr.

In most cases, however, these double-stem names were shortened by
dropping the second stem, whence such names as Kuhn (from Kunrat), Hein
(from Heinrich), Ott (from Ottman), Traut (from Trautmann), Bär, Barr
(from Berhard). To these stems diminutive suffixes were added; thus from
"i" we have the forms Bürki (from Burkhard), Ebi (from Ebarhard), Egli
(from Agilbrecht), Hägi (from Haginbert), Lichti (from Ludger: P.G.
Light), Stäheli (from Stahal), Welti (from Walther), Geissle (from
Gisalhart: P.G. Yeissley); from "izo" we get Boss and Butz (from
Bodomar), Dietz (from Dietrich), Fritz and Fritschi (from Friedrich: cf.
Barbara Frietchie), Heintz (from Heinrich), Kuntz (from Kunrat: P.G.
Koons and Kuhns), Landis, Lentz, and Lantz (from Landfrid), Lutz (from
Ludwig), Seitz (from Siegfrid: P.G. Sides), Tietz (from Dietrich), Waltz
(from Walther), from "iko" we get Frick (from Friedrich), Illig and the
genitive Hilleges (from Hildebrand), Kündig (from Gundobert), Leidig
(from Luithart); from "ilo" we get Ebli and Eberli (from Ebarhard),
Bechtel (from Berchtold), Bickel (from Botger), Diehl (from Dietrich),
Hirzel (from Hieruzleip: P.G. Hartzell), Hubeli (from Hugubert), Markel
and Märgli (from Markwald), Meili (from Maganhard), Nägeli (from
Nagalrich), Rubli (from Hrodebert: Robert), Schnäbeli (from root
Sneo--snow: P.G. Snavely); from "z" plus "l" we get Künzel (from
Kunrat), Reitzel (from Ricohard: Richard), and Tietzel (from Dietrich).

From all the above forms patronymics in "mann," "inger," and "ler" are
formed: Bausman, Beidleman, Denlinger, Dietzinger, Gehringer,
Grissinger, Heintzelman, Hirtzler, Hollinger.

In addition to the purely German personal names we have also many names
taken from Biblical characters and from the lives of saints: Bartel
(from Bartholomaeus), Klause (Nicholas), Martin, Theiss, and Theissen
(Matthias), Peters, Hensel (Johannes), Jäggi and Jäckli (Jacobus: P.G.
Yeagy and Yackley), Jörg, Jorges (George: P.G. Yerrick and Yerkes),
Brosius (Ambrosius), Bastian (Sebastisn), Flory (Florus), Johst (Justus:
P.G. Yost).

The second class of Pennsylvania-German family names are derived from
the occupation of the individual; among the best known are Becker
(baker), Baumgartner (orchard-grower), Brenneisen (blacksmith), Brunner
(well-digger), Dreher, Trachsel, Trechsler (turner), Fischer, Gerber
(tanner, currier: P.G. Garver), Glöckner (bell-ringer: P.G. Klackner,
Kleckner), Heilman (doctor), Huber (one who owns a "hube"--a small
farm), Jäger (hunter), Kärcher (carter), Kohler, Koehler (coal-burner):
P.G, Kaler, Cayler), Kaufman (merchant), Küfer and Küfner (cooper),
Küster (sexton), Maurer (mason), Metzger (butcher), Lehmann (one under
feudal tenure), Leineweber (linen-weaver), Müller, Probst (provost),
Reifschneider, Riemenschneider (harness-maker), Sauter, Suter
(shoemaker), Schaffner (steward), Schenck (cup-bearer), Scherer
(barber), Schlegel (one who hammers), Schmidt (smith), Schneider
(tailor), Schreiber (writer), Schreiner (joiner), Schütz (shooter, or
archer: P.G. Sheets), Schultz (mayor), Siegrist (sexton), Spengler
(tin-smith), Steinmetz (stone-cutter), Tschudi (judge: Swiss), Vogt
(bailiff), Wagner (wagoner), Wannemaker (basket-maker), Weber (weaver),
Wirtz (landlord), Widmeyer, Widmer (one who has land from church or
monastery), Ziegler (brick-maker), Zimmerman (carpenter).

The first subdivision of names in the third class comprises those which
denote the place where one lives or whence one comes; such are Algäuer
(from the Allgau in Switzerland), Altendörfer (from village in St. Gall,
Switz.), Amweg (beside the road), Amend (at end of village), Bach,
Bacher, Bachman (who live near a brook), Berner (from Berne, Switz.),
Basler (from Basel), Berger (lives on mountain), Beyer (a Bavarian),
Biemensdörfer, Blickensdorfer (from village in Canton Zürich), Boehm (a
Bohemian), Brechbühl (unploughed hill: P.G. Brightbill and Brackbill),
Breitenbach (village in Solothurn, Switz.), Brubacher (village in
Zürich), Büttigkoffer (from village Büttikofen, Berne), Detweiler
(village in Canton Zurich), Diefenbach (Tiefenbach, in Canton Uri,
Switz.), Dieffendörfer (from Tiefendorf), Flückiger (village in Canton
Berne), Fahrni (village in Berne), Frick (in Aargau, Switz.), Haldi,
Haldeman (from Halden, common name for village in Switzerland),
Hofstetter (name of several villages in Zürich, St. Gall, and Berne),
Eschelman (from Aeschi, village in Canton Berne), Imgrund (in hollow
land), Imboden (in bottom-lands), Imhof (in farm-yard), Köllicker
(village in Aargau), Longenecker (village in Berne), Mellinger (village
in Aargau), Neuenschwander (village in Berne), Oberholtzer (several
villages in Berne), Ruegsegger (Berne: P.G. Ricksecker), Schollenberger
(castle and village, Zürich), Schwab (a Swabian: P.G. Swope), Urner
(from Canton Uri), Zug (Canton Zug), Zürcher (from Zürich). <span

During the Middle Ages the houses were not numbered as now, but had
signs painted on them, something after the manner of hotels at the
present time. From these many names were derived: Bär (bear), Baum
(tree), Bieber (beaver), Bischof (bishop), Engel (angel), Fasnacht
(Shrove Tuesday), Faust (fist), Fuchs (fox), Fünfrock (five-coats), Haas
(hare), Hahn (rooster), Helm (helmet), Hertzog (duke: P.G. Hartsook),
Holtzapfel (wild-apple), Kalb (calf: P.G. Kulp, Culp), Kaiser (emperor),
König (king), Krebs (crab), Münch (monk), Oechsli (little ox: P.G.
Exley), Pfaff (priest), Ritter (knight), Vogel (bird), Voegli (little
bird: P.G. Feagley), Würfel (die, cube), Wolf.

Finally we have names given from personal peculiarities. Such are:
Braun, Dürr (dry, thin), Fröhlich (cheerful: P.G. Frailey), Frei (free),
Freytag (Friday), Gut (good), Hübschmann (handsome), Hoch (tall), Jüng
(young), Kahl (bald), Klein (small), Kleindienst (small sevice), Krause
(curly), Krumbein (crooked legs), Kurtz (short), Lang (long), Lebengut
(good-liver: P.G. Livingood), Rau, Rauch (rough), Reich (rich), Roth
(red), Rothrock (red-coat), Rothaermel (red-sleeve), Schwartz (black),
Seltenreich (seldom rich), Weiss (white).

These German names almost all came from the Palatinate and Switzerland.
Even today we can trace the Swiss origin of many--for instance, Urner
(from Uri), Johns (Tschantz), Neagley (Naegeli), Bossler (Baseler).

Some are of French Huguenot origin, which by combined German and English
influence have often received a not very elegant or euphonious form:
examples are Lemon (Le Mon), Bushong (Beauchamp), and Shunk (Jean); the
original Fierre was changed to German Faehre, and later became
anglicised into Ferree. <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3)

The number of different of spelling even the simplest names is often
surprisingly large: thus, for the original Graf we find today Graaf,
Graff, Groff, Groft, Graft, and Grove. So Baer gives us Bear, Bare,
Bair. Of course the vagaries of English orthography are largely
responsible for this.

There were three ways in which the change of names took place: first, by
translation; second, by spelling German sounds according to English
methods; and third, by analogy.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[3](elpg06.htm#fr_2) Some of these names may come
from homonymous places in the Palatinate; almost all the Lancaster
County family-names, however, which are derived from places, are of
Swiss origin.--O.K.

Pennsylvania are Fortuné (Fordney), Correll, Florey, De Frehn, Farney,
