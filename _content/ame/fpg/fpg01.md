# Folk-Lore Of The Pennsylvania Germans.

### PART I.

### Journal of American Folk-Lore 1:2 pp. 125-35 \[1888\]

BEFORE describing the customs, folk-medicine, and folk-lore of the
Pennsylvania Germans, it will be necessary to present a brief sketch of
the people to which they relate, and to explain the origin of the
dialect generally, though erroneously, denominated "Pennsylvania Dutch."

Swedish settlers appeared at Tinicum Island, on the Delaware River,
about the year 1638, where they held possession until 1655, when they
were displaced by the Dutch, who in turn (in 1664) were compelled to
give way to the English. A few adventurers had already arrived and
established themselves where Chester now stands, a year before the
arrival of Penn in 1682. Previous to this, numbers of Germans from the
Palatinate--Rhenish Bavaria--had been induced to come to England upon
the invitation of Queen Anne, the object of the English authorities
being the rapid colonization of the new possessions in America;
therefore many of the immigrants who came with Penn, and during the
following years, were retained for a greater or less period of time to
indemnify that government for the expense of transportation and
maintenance. Some sold themselves to settlers from the interior, for
whom they worked for a specified time. Numbers of these German colonists
were transported to Georgia and to New York, but most of them ultimately
made their way to Pennsylvania, where their friends had previously
settled.

During the years 1683 and 1684 the immigration steadily increased, and
was represented chiefly by Welsh, English, a few Dutch, and, above all,
by Palatines. According to Proud, some of these lodged in the woods, in
hollow trees, and in caves and dug-outs made along the banks of the
Delaware and the Wissahickon, while others hastily erected rude huts.

Thousands of new arrivals flocked in between the years 1708 and 1720,
these being chiefly Palatines, with a few natives of Würtemberg and
Darmstadt. Franconia, Baden, and Saxony were also represented at various
intervals. Irish, from the north of Ireland, began to arrive about the
year 1719, and the Welsh had been among the first to purchase land of
Penn, selecting that on the west bank of the Schuylkill. Previous to
1692, the latter settled six townships in Chester County. The Irish, on
the contrary, established themselves on the Lehigh, at a point between
the present sites of Bethlehem and Allentown, which was long known as
"Craig's Settlement." North of the Blue Mountains, near the Delaware, a
few Dutch families

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

from New Jersey and New York took up land, as did also a number of
French and Spanish.

Philadelphia County was established in 1682, and on account of the
number of Germans at the northern extremity of the settlement that spot
received the name of "Germantown," which it still retains. From this
point north and west the country was rapidly penetrated and clearings
were made, so that during the eighteenth century all that portion of the
State east of the Blue Mountains, from the Delaware to Maryland,
contained thriving settlements and the beginnings of future cities.

Intermarriage between the various German immigrants, among whom the
dialects of the Palatinate, Franconia, etc., predominated, has resulted
in the formation of a dialect which is known as "Pennsylvania German."
This more strongly resembles some of the Bavarian dialects than any
other of the German, as was recognized by the present writer during his
service as staff-surgeon in the Prussian army during the war of 1870-71.
Although Pennsylvanians read German newspapers and books, they are
generally unable to converse in that language, and experience great
difficulty in understanding a recent German immigrant, whom they regard
in the light of a foreigner, as much as do people of English descent.

German names were gradually Anglicized, so that few original forms,
comparatively speaking, are now found. Some could not be satisfactorily
treated in this manner, and were allowed to survive, such as
Knappenberger, Lichtenwalner, Fenstermacher, Nunnemacher, Oberholtzer,
Lautenschläger, Katzenmoyer, Trockenmüller, Himmelreich (= Kingdom of
Heaven), etc. Others are found to-day, both the German and the English
equivalent, possessed by different branches of the same family, as the
following will illustrate:--

Another change is discernible in quite a number of names, *i. e.*, a
change of spelling to simplify pronunciation, or to disguise or conceal
ideas apparently absurd, as Wetherhold, from Wedderholtz; Balliet, from
Pollyard; Hendershott, from Hinnershitz; Sheetz, from Schitz, etc.

Although impracticable, in the present paper, to treat of the philologic
peculiarities of this dialect, it is necessary to submit a short scheme
to facilitate in the proper pronunciation of such words and phrases as
may be given from time to time. Consonants are sounded as in English;
vowels are short, unless indicated by a line over the vowel prolonged in
sound.

|                         |                       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| a, as in *far*, *tar*.  | i, as in *pit*.       |
| ä as in *hat*.          | ī, as *e* in *neat*.  |
| â, as in *law*.         | o, as *u* in *nut*.   |
| ai, as *ai* in *aisle*. | ō, as in note.        |
| âi, as *oi* in *oil*.   | u, as *u* in *put*.   |
| e, as in *net*.         | ŭ, as *oo* in *fool*. |
| ē, as *a* in *ale*.     |                       |

 

ch, as in German *nicht*.

gh, as the soft sound of *g* in *Tagen*, *schlagen*.

z is represented by *ts*.

c "      "        by *k* or *s*.

' the acute accent, is used to indicate accented syllables.

n, the superior n indicates a nasalized sound of the letter to which it
is attached. This sound appears to be one of the most striking
peculiarities of the dialect, and resembles the nasalized *n* of the
French language. The final *en* of all German words becomes *a* or *ä*,
as schlagen (to strike) = shla'gha; essen (to eat) = es'sä.

It is extremely difficult for people of the rural districts to acquire
the proper sound of *j* and *g*, as in the words James and gem, the
usual result being *tsh*, as *ch* in Charles; words beginning with *ch*
are sounded like the English *j*, and the final *th* becomes *s*, while
the same sound as initial, in *this*, becomes *d*.

This dialect is still in common use, particularly in the country and
small villages, though through the agency of public schools the English
language is rapidly replacing it. As pronounced and spoken by the
country folk, the dialect is frequently very amusing to those speaking
it in the cities, as the former have a peculiar drawl or prolonged
intonation not often heard in business communities, where everything is
done with promptness and dispatch. There are marked differences, too, in
words and phrases, so that one who is familiar with this dialect can
readily distinguish whether the speaker be from Lancaster, or Berks, or
Lehigh County.

The descendants of the early German colonists, after having

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

received during several generations the benefits of education and
mingling in cultured society, cannot be distinguished from the offspring
of other nationalities, and it is only in the rural districts, and in
what is frequently termed the "backwoods," that we find the ruder and
more primitive customs and superstitions surviving.

The country folks (*bush'lait*) are very averse to the adoption of the
usages of polite society, and consequently adhere to many curious
customs and manners with great tenacity. A common response, when
questioned in regard to this, is, "As my father did, so I do" (*Wi dĕr
fádĕr gedú<sup>n</sup> hŏt, so du ich â*).

Occasional newspaper articles have appeared from time to time purporting
to present accounts of the customs and superstitions of this people; but
as the writers were generally not of the people, and in addition many
were unfamiliar with the dialect, the accuracy of such descriptions may
reasonably be questioned.

Many of the customs and superstitions are the remnants of what were
imported into this country at the time of the first settlements, and it
is only natural, therefore, to expect parallels in various portions of
Great Britain and on the Continent. Still, the colonists had invariably
to adapt themselves to their new environment; and as most of them had no
money wherewith to secure the comforts of civilization, they began life
*de novo*. Houses of moderate size were erected upon the clearings,
usually having two rooms, sometimes three; the chimney being erected on
the inside, as was also the oven. Windows consisted of small square
openings, with a sliding board on the inner side, to serve as a shutter.
Furniture of all descriptions was home-made and of the most primitive
patterns. All clothing was made by the women, and they frequently
resorted to buckskin skirts when working in the fields. Squirrel-skin
moccasins were considered a luxury, and when the young women went to
church on Sunday, in order to make them last as long as possible, they
walked barefoot until within sight of the building before putting them
on. In time, however, the condition of things and persons improved, so
that the account which follows pertains chiefly to the early and middle
portion of the present century.

Nearly every farmer raised sufficient flax or hemp for home consumption.
The preparation of this, so that the spun fibre could be delivered to
the weaver, entailed much labor and time, as many well remember. Wool
was also prepared, dyed, and woven for garments and bed-covers. Dyes
were made from the bark of trees and from plants. Sassafras bark
produced a substantial yellow for woollen materials; a decoction of the
bark of the red maple was employed, though a quantity of copperas had to
be added. The bark of both the hickory and the oak were employed,
chiefly for linen goods, and

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

the loose skins of old onions produced a light yellow. As a substitute
for alum, urine was employed, and this was carefully poured into large
vessels, until sufficient had accumulated for the desired purpose.

Barns, were then, as now, always larger and frequently more comfortable
than the dwelling-house. The ground floor is divided into compartments
for the stabling of horses and cattle, one end being left open as a
driveway, where farm implements are placed during inclement weather. The
main floor, extending over all, is usually from ten to twelve feet above
the ground, and is divided into three parts. The middle third is
reserved for threshing and the temporary storage of carriages and
wagons, while upon either side are located the granaries, above which is
stored the hay or straw. The roofs are of shingles. According to an old
superstition, the shingles must be nailed on during the waning of the
moon, or they will soon curl tip and split. It is a common sight to find
a horse-shoe nailed upon the lintels of the stable doors, to insure good
luck and safety to the animals, and it is still better if the horse-shoe
be one that was found upon the highway.

The writer is inclined to believe that this custom had its origin at a
time more remote than the superstitions relating to "thirteen at a
table" and the "spilling of salt," both of which are generally conceded
to have originated at or with the Lord's Supper and consequent events.
The Romans drove nails into the walls of cottages, as an antidote
against the plague: for this reason L. Manlius, A. U. C. 390, was named
dictator to drive the nail (Brand's "Antiq.," 1882, iii. 18), In
Jerusalem, a rough representation of a hand is marked by the natives on
the wall of every house whilst in building (Lt. Condor, "Palestine
Explor. Fund," January, 1873, p. 16). The Moors generally, and
especially the Arabs of Kairwan, employ the marks on their houses as
prophylactics, and similar hand-prints are found in El Baird, near
Petra.

That these practices and the later use of the horse-shoe originated with
the rite of the Passover is probable. The blood upon the door-posts and
upon the lintel (Exodus xii. 7) formed the chief points of an arch, and
when the horse-shoe was invented it was naturally adopted by the
superstitious as conforming to the shape, or outline, upon the primitive
doorway, and in time it became the symbol of luck, or "safety to those
residing under its protection."

The fence around the barn-yard, as well as others upon the farm, is also
made during the waxing of the moon, or the posts will sink and soon rot
away (Fayette County). In the eastern part of the State, fences must be
made when the horns are turned up, when they will remain; if built when
the horns of the moon are directed

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

downward, the posts will sink until the bottom rail touches the ground.
So also with the planting of vegetables, etc. Peas, beans, and other
plants growing as vines are planted when the horns of the moon are
turned up, so that they may grow vigorously. If planted when the horns
of the moon are turned down, they will remain low and stunted. <span
id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1)

Potatoes are planted in the new moon, so that they will have sufficient
light and all strike root; "the sign of the moon must be in the feet"
(Mr. Brown, Fayette County). The same authority also says that corn
should be planted during the new moon, "when the sign is in the head,"
so that it may all go to ear. In Lehigh County, the first day of May was
the day set apart for planting corn.

Cabbage should be planted on the seventeenth day of March, to insure its
heading well.

Cucumbers must be planted in the morning, before sunrise, as otherwise
they would be destroyed by bugs.

Wheat must not be cut before full moon, as it will not be fully ripe;
"and if Ember-days are high \[*sic*\] one may expect to obtain a good
price therefor." This last is from Mr. L. W. Brown, of Fayette County,
but the description is not clear.

A curious belief is still extant in Lehigh County respecting the
transplanting of parsley, Should any one obtain one or more plants, and
replant them in his own garden, it is believed that such person's death
will soon follow. <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2)

It is but a few years ago that hogs were slaughtered during the waxing
of the moon, as at any other time the meat would shrink and not be as
good. <span id="fr_3"></span>[3](#fn_3)

It is still confidently asserted, in many localities, that the cattle
kneel and low at midnight before Christmas.

To kill a toad or a barn-swallow will cause the cows to give bloody
milk.

In Fayette County, according to my informant, Mr. L. W. Brown, it when a
colt opens its mouth for the first time, it drops what is

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

usually called a 'false tongue;' this should be picked up and suspended
in the stable, when the colt will always be easily caught when out in
pasture."

As counter-charms, the following are still believed in. When corn and
beans are reserved for the next year's planting, the cobs, husks, and
vines are carefully carried out into a field or upon the highway, that
they may be quickly destroyed. Should they be burned, the next crop of
corn and beans will be attacked by black fungus (*brâut*).

To exterminate briers and alders, cut them when the waning moon is in
the "sign of the heart."

One will frequently observe, even at this day, the bodies of birds of
prey, with outstretched wings, nailed against the gable ends of barns.
Birds of this kind, shot upon the farm, were thus exposed to keep away
others. A quarter of a century ago it was the custom for the young men
to organize a party and shoot all obnoxious birds, and frequently those
beneficial to the farmer, on Ascension Day. The origin of this custom,
and the reason why that particular day should be selected, is not known.

Corn-husking parties and the merriment incident thereto is well known
and indulged in even at this time, but there were also gatherings in the
fields at night, after the husking had been completed, one of which the
writer witnessed some years ago in Monroe County. In making a journey
across the Blue Mountains, the summit was not reached until near
midnight, and, just as the country beyond was dimly outlined in the
moonlight, occasional strains of music and laughter could bc detected
floating up from below. Presently large fires were seen, and around them
the rapidly moving bodies of the merrymakers. The husking had been
completed, and a dance was in progress,--"a genuine jig," as it is
termed in that region. The fiddler was seated upon a stump, while the
couple who had the "floor" were stationed *vis-à-vis*, and in this
position danced out the set, after which their places were taken by
another couple. After several rounds, the whole party would promenade
round the fire, which served both for illuminating the grounds and to
furnish warmth, as it was late in the month of October.

When dances were held in the barn, light was afforded by lanterns and
tallow candles. Husking parties (*husk'in matsh'es*) were then held
during the day, and the finding of a red ear of corn entitled the finder
to kiss any one of the girls present; if a girl found such an ear, and
wished to avoid being kissed, she would hide it quickly as possible,
though, if discovered, the first of the young men to reach her was
entitled to the kiss.

That curious custom of courting termed bundling still survives

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

in a few isolated localities along the eastern foothills of the Blue
Mountains. It was rather common during the early portion of the present
century, and survived and was considered a not improper practice even
until the outbreak of the late war. It is more than probable that the
young men discovered the absurdity and indecency of the custom during
their enlistment, when they came in contact with more enlightened
people, to whom such practice no doubt seemed criminal.

Among the uncultured this form of courtship was conducted with propriety
and sincerity, but by the educated classes the proceedings were looked
upon as decidedly immodest. No young man was esteemed a desirable beau
unless he possessed at least a horse and buggy, so as to be enabled to
take his sweetheart to local gatherings on holidays, and to church on
Sunday.

Saturday evening was considered the proper time for courting
(*shpär'iya*), though this delightful pastime often extended over the
whole of Sunday. As before stated, houses were limited as to rooms; and
as the distance travelled by the lover was often too great for him to
return home late Saturday night, and to be at the command of his
*fiancée* on Sunday morning, the matter was compromised by his remaining
and sharing her bed. At sunset, the old folks were wont to retire, both
to rest from the labors of the day and to save the unnecessary burning
of tallow candles, which were homemade and a luxury.

The custom of bundling was, in early times, not confined to Pennsylvania
alone, but extended into the New England States, as the following
quotation will illustrate. William Smith, in the "Gentleman's Magazine"
1747, p. 211), says: "It must be noted that it is the custom in this
country \[New England\] for young persons between whom there is a
courtship, or treaty of marriage, to lye together, the woman having her
petticoats on, and the man his breeches; and afterwards, if they do no
fall out, they confess the covenant at the church, in the midst of the
congregation, and to the minister, who declares the marriage legal; and
if anything criminal has been acted, orders a punishment accordingly,
sometimes of forty stripes save one."

In Pennsylvania, however, superfluous clothing was frequently dispensed
with, and, if a like rule had existed, it would have been rarely found
necessary to inflict such punishment.

That bundling received judicial recognition by the Supreme Court of the
State of Pennsylvania is evident in the case of Kenderline *v*. Phelin,
about the year 1852. This was on appeal from the case tried before Chief
justice Gibson, holding court at nisi prius in Philadelphia, who, in a
decision on a point of evidence, ruled that in that part of the country
where the custom was known to prevail, "that the

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

female being in bed with a man, or different men, was not conclusive
evidence as to her want of chastity;" and, on appeal, the decision was
sustained. <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4)

Another case, tried at Allentown, resulted in favor of the defendant,
for the reason shown in the following extract from "The Pennsylvania Law
Journal" (v. 1846, p. 30): "In an action brought to recover damages for
the seduction of the plaintiff's daughter, it appeared that the
defendant and the daughter slept together on the occasion of the
seduction, according to a *custom* which prevailed in the part of the
country where they resided (known as bundling), and with the knowledge
of the plaintiff: Held, that the knowledge of the plaintiff amounted to
connivance, and he could not therefore recover damages." <span
id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5)

Thirty years ago it was common, at church, to see all the marriageable
girls--or at least those who had lovers--wearing white scarfs or
handkerchiefs around their necks, to hide the scarlet blotches caused by
the kisses and "love bites" of the preceding evening. When visiting the
larger towns, numbers of young couples would stroll along the streets
with clasped hands or linked fingers, like children, totally oblivious
to all comment from the amused lookers-on and the writer distinctly
remembers seeing such visitors sitting upon the butcher's block, in the
public market-place, clasped in each other's arms and sound
asleep!--this, too, in the midst of a multitude of people who had been
attracted to the town on account of a public demonstration.

The marriage ceremony was generally performed at the minister's
residence, and it was he, also, who furnished refreshments, consisting
of home-made wine and small cakes. The bride and groom, sometimes
attended by friends, usually went on horseback, and wedding trips were
unknown to most people. Upon the return of the party to the temporary or
future home of the newly wedded couple, dancing and other festivities
were indulged in until long after midnight.

It was the custom for the bride to furnish the household linen, bedding,
etc., the husband being supposed to have secured a house and plat of
ground, either by purchase or renting. The habit was never to take an
old broom into a new house, as bad luck was sure to follow. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6) It must be a new broom, and first carried
across the meadow, to avert any evil consequences.

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

Both at wedding feasts and upon other occasions it was usual, when
dancing to "dance for flax;" that is, the higher the feet were raised
from the floor, the higher would be the host's crop of flax at the next
harvest. <span id="fr_7"></span>[1](#fn_7)

The young, wife, in the absence of farm help, often lent a helping hand
in the heavy work of farming, such as plowing, threshing grain, clearing
the fields of large stones, etc. From spring until autumn it was her
duty, to gather the various herbs, barks, roots, and flowers supposed to
contain medicinal properties, which were subsequently employed in
domestic practice, as occasion required. Garden-seeds were also selected
for the next year's planting, and, altogether, these various packages
and bags, suspended from the rafters of the loft or garret of the house,
formed quite an important and interesting collection. The subject of
folk-medicine and the superstitions relating thereto will be presented
later on.

"Quiltings" and apple-butter parties were looked forward to by the young
folks with much interest. At the former the young women assisted in
finishing bed-quilts, which consisted of many-colored patches of calico,
and sometimes silks, the evening terminating with a dance and a supper;
while, at the latter, much of the day was spent in boiling down cider
and paring apples, which were subsequently reduced therein to the proper
consistency. As this required constant stirring to avoid burning, the
labors sometimes extended far into the night, and were then followed by
a dance.

In some localities it is believed that if vinegar be disturbed while the
apple-trees bloom it will again turn to cider.

With the exception of very few articles, nearly every variety of food
was of farm production. Such as was obtained at the country stores was
received in exchange for butter and eggs.

The housewife sometimes found difficulty in butter-making, the "spell"
being believed to be the work of a witch, as every locality boasted of
such a personage. The remedy was to plunge a red-hot poker into the
contents of the churn, when the spell was broken, and the butter
immediately began to form.

To refuse a witch any request was sure to be followed by misfortune. The
following incident was related to the writer by Mr. A. F. Berlin, of
Allentown, Pennsylvania, who received it at first hand. A farmer who
lives at Alburtis, Lehigh County, had two cows. One

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

day an old woman, who lived but a short distance away, and who was
suspected of being a witch, came to the house, and, during the course of
conversation, asked which of the two cows gave the greater quantity of
milk. The one which was indicated was then with calf. Upon the following
day the two cows were driven, as usual, into the fields to pasture, but
on attempting to drive them home, later in the day, the milch cow was
found lying helpless upon the ground. The farmer, upon hearing of this,
went into the field with his sons, to endeavor to get the animal upon
her feet. The sons took hold of the horns, while the father grasped the
tail, but all attempts to move the cow were ineffectual. The father then
directed the boys to gather some wood to make a fire, which was to be
placed near the cow. During all this time the witch was standing on the
portico of the farmer's house, watching the proceedings; but the instant
she saw that fire was to be kindled, she came forward, and inquired
after the purpose of the proceedings. The farmer accused her of
bewitching the cow, but this she denied most vigorously. The witch then
bade the farmer call his wife, who, upon her arrival, was told to take
hold of the cow's tail while the witch went to the head. After a few
caresses and the utterance of some words of endearment and
encouragement, the cow rose from the ground, and walked away as if
nothing had occurred.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[130:1](fpg01.htm#fr_1) That a similar belief
obtained in Great Britain is observed from the following passage in
Tusser's *Poems* (printed 1744), quoted by Mr. Folkard in his *Plant
Lore, Legends, and Lyrics* (London, 1884), p. 168, viz.: "It must be
granted the moon is an excellent clock, and, if not the cause of many
surprising accidents, gives a just indication of them, whereof this
Pease and Beans may be one instance; for Pease and Beans sown during the
increase do run more to hawm and straw, and during the declension more
to cod, according to the common consent of countrymen."

<span id="fn_2"></span>[130:2](fpg01.htm#fr_2) A similar belief obtains
in Devonshire, England. Parsley was regarded by the Greeks as a funeral
herb, and. they frequently strewed the tombs of their dead with it.

<span id="fn_3"></span>[130:3](fpg01.htm#fr_3) "Do not kill your pig
until full moon, or the pork will be ruined," is a West Sussex
superstition. *The Folk-Lore Record*, 1878, i. II.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[133:3](fpg01.htm#fr_6) A New England saying,
noted in the *London Folk-Lore Journal* (1884, ii. 24), is, "He who
proposes moving into a new house must send in beforehand bread and a new
broom."

<span id="fn_7"></span>[134:1](fpg01.htm#fr_7) In one part of Germany it
is customary "for the bride to place flax in her shoes, that she may
never come to want" (*Flowers and Flower-Lore*, by Hilderic Friend, i.
134). Another custom, from the same authority, is to the effect that a
bride will "tic a string of flax around her left leg, in the belief that
she will thereby enjoy the full blessing of the married state."

"Flax is the symbol of free and abundant vegetable life" (*Mythologie
des Plantes*, by Count A. de Gubernatis, ii. 199).
