No metal vessel or anything which chills&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">B1</FONT></A> must be put on his navel till he dies, as it is written [Eccl. xii. 6]: "While the silver cord is not yet torn loose."</p> <i>

<p>D</i>. His eyes must not be closed. Whoever touches or moves him is regarded as a shedder of blood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">D1</FONT></A></p> <i>
<p>E</i>. His relatives may not rend their clothes nor remove their shoes nor lament over him, nor may the coffin be brought into his room, till he dies.</p> <i>
<p>F</i>. His death must not be announced, nor his deeds proclaimed, until he dies; R. Jehudah, however, said: If he was a wise man, the latter may be done.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">F1</FONT></A></p> <i>
<p>G</i>. Greetings must not be exchanged when there is a death in a village, but it may be done in a greater city. An infant cut or torn at birth, a miscarriage, or born alive at the eighth month, or born dead at the ninth--all the religious ceremonies do not apply to it.</p> <i>

Woe, hero!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">H1</FONT></A> R. Jehudah said: (It may be said also:) Woe, trusted man, who lived by his labor!

<p>the yard, and they followed him; he returned to the house, and they followed him. He then said to them: I thought that you might be scalded with lukewarm water, now I see that you cannot be scalded even with boiling. Have I not taught unto you: No consolation is needed (on the death of) slaves?</p> <i>
<p>J</i>. When Tebbi the slave of Rabban Gamaliel died, the latter accepted consolation. Said his disciples to him: Our master! hast thou not taught unto us that no consolation is needed on slaves? He rejoined: My slave Tebbi cannot be likened to other slaves; he was a righteous one.</p> <i>
<p>K</i>. He also permitted him to lay Tephilin. Said his disciples: Our master! hast thou not taught unto us that slaves are exempt from Tephilin? And he made the same rejoinder.</p> <i>
<p>L</i>. Slaves must not be distinguished as Father so and so, or Mother so and so.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">L1</FONT></A> The household of Rabban Gamaliel, however, used the distinction of "Father Tebbi" and "Mother Tebbitha" to the above-named and his wife.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">L2</FONT></A></p> <i>
<p>M</i>. Ancestors must not be distinguished as the fathers of the nation (or the tribes), except the three Patriarchs; nor mothers of the nation, but the four mothers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">M1</FONT></A></p>

<P><A NAME="fn_2"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_2">1:A3</A> If he is the only son of his father who died at that time, he is considered as a living child, and to exempt the widow from Yibum or Halitzah.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_3"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_3">1:A4</A> His wife or slave if he is a priest, also his mother if she was the daughter of a commoner.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_4"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_4">1:A5</A> If his wife was the daughter of a priest, and he a commoner [Lev. xxii. 12-14].</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_5"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_5">1:A6</A> For instance, if his mother dies at that time and leaves property to him, it is considered his; so that when he dies his relatives on his mother's side inherit from him, but not those on his father's. See Nidah, 44<i>a</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_6"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_6">1:A7</A> It is not a subject of defilement, to make him who touches it or the tent which contains it unclean, if it has not a certain quantity, as will be explained farther on.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_7"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_7">1:A8</A> The blood of an offering can be sprinkled only when the offerer is alive, and has a substitute in the Temple.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_8"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_8">2:B1</A> <i>B</i>. See Sabbath, p. 353.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_9"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_9">2:C1</A> <i>C</i>. As was the custom at that time.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_10"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_10">2:D1</A> <i>D</i>. For the reason, see ibid., Mishna and Gemara thereon; here, however, this is said in the name of R. Meir.</P>

Some say even in his presence, because he is used to hear his praises, and will not be alarmed; but we do not find any basis for this assertion.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_13"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_13">2:H2</A> It seems to us that this is said of a bondman only, but not of an idolater, as an idolater, even if he was a Gentile, is called a sinner according to the Talmud, which declares that idolatry was prohibited to Noah for all nations.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_14"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_14">3:L1</A> <i>L</i>. The word Abba, which means "Father," was a title at that time, as "Reverend" is now, or as the Catholics entitle their superiors of the Church and nunneries "Father" and "Mother."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_15"></A><A HREF="rab01.htm#fr_15">3:L2</A> In Midrash Rabbah [Lev. chap. xix.] is to be found Tebbitha, the female slave of Rabban Gamaliel, presumably Tebbi's wife.</P>
