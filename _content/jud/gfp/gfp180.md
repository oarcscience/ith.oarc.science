### CHAPTER XLIV

THE precepts of the ninth class are those enumerated in the Section on
Love. Their reason is obvious. The actions prescribed by them serve to
remind us continually of God, and of our duty to fear and to love Him,
to keep all His commandments, and to believe concerning God that which
every religious person must believe. This class includes the laws of
Prayer, Reading of Shema, Grace, and duties connected with these,
Blessing of the priests, Tefillin, Mezuzah, Ẓiẓit, acquiring a scroll of
the Law, and reading in it at certain times. The performance of all
these precepts inculcates into our heart useful lessons. All this is
clear, and a further explanation is superfluous, as being a mere
repetition and nothing else.
