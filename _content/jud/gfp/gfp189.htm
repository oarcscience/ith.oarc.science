<p>THIS chapter treats of the meaning of three terms which we find necessary to explain, viz., <i>&#7717;esed</i> ("loving kindness"), <i>mishpat</i> ("judgment"), and <i>&#7827;edakah</i> ("righteousness").</p>  
<p>In our Commentary on the Sayings of the Fathers (chap. v. 7) we have explained the expression <i>&#7717;esed</i> as denoting an excess [in some moral quality]. It is especially used of extraordinary kindness. Loving-kindness is practised in two ways: first, we show kindness to those who have no claim whatever upon us; secondly, we are kind to those to whom it is due, in a greater measure than is due to them. In the inspired writings the term <i>&#7717;esed</i> occurs mostly in the sense of showing kindness to those who have no claim to it whatever. For this reason the term <i>&#7717;esed</i> is employed to express the good bestowed upon us by God: "I will mention the loving-kindness of the Lord" (Isa. lxiii. 7). On this account, the very act of the creation is an act of God's loving-kindness. "I have said, The Universe is built up in loving-kindness" (Ps. lxxxix. 3); i.e., the building up of the Universe is an act of loving-kindness. Also, in the enumeration of God's attributes, Scripture says: "And abundant in loving-kindness" (Exod. xxxiv. 6).</p>

<p>The term <i>&#7827;edakah</i> is derived from <i>&#7827;edek</i>, "righteousness"; it denotes the act of giving every one his due, and of showing kindness to every being according as it deserves. In Scripture, however, the expression <i>&#7827;edakah</i> is not used in the first sense, and does not apply to the payment of what we owe to others. When we therefore give the hired labourer his wages, or pay a debt, we do not perform an act of <i>&#7827;edakah</i>. But we do perform an act of <i>&#7827;edakah</i> when we fulfil those duties towards our fellow-men which our moral conscience imposes upon us; e.g., when we heal the wound of the sufferer. Thus Scripture says, in reference to the returning of the pledge [to the poor debtor]: "And it shall be <i>&#7827;edakah</i> (righteousness) unto thee" (Deut. xxiv. 11). When we walk in the way of virtue we act righteously towards our intellectual faculty, and pay what is due unto it; and because every virtue is thus <i>&#7827;edakah</i>, Scripture applies the term to the virtue of faith in God. Comp. "And he believed in the Lord, and he accounted it to him as righteousness" (Gen. xv. 6); "And it shall be our righteousness" (Deut. vi. 25).</p>  
<p>The noun <i>mishpat</i>, "judgment," denotes the act of deciding upon a certain action in accordance with justice which may demand either mercy or punishment.</p>  
<p>We have thus shown that <i>&#7717;esed</i> denotes pure charity; <i>&#7827;edakah</i> kindness, prompted by a certain moral conscience in man, and being a means of attaining perfection for his soul, whilst <i>mishpat</i> may in some cases find expression in revenge, in other cases in mercy.</p>  
<p>In discussing the impropriety of admitting attributes of God (Part I., chap. liii., seq.), we stated that the divine attributes which occur in Scripture are attributes of His actions; thus He is called <i>&#7717;asid</i>, "kind," because He created the Universe; <i>&#7827;addik</i>, "righteous," on account of His mercy with the weak, in providing for every living being according to its powers; and <i>shofet</i>, "judge," on account of the relative good and the great relative evils that are decreed by God's justice as directed by His wisdom. These three names occur in the Pentateuch: "Shall not the judge (<i>shofet</i>) of all the earth," etc. (Gen. xviii. 25); "Righteous (<i>&#7827;addik</i>) and upright is he" (Deut. xxxii. 4); "Abundant in loving-kindness" (<i>&#7717;esed</i>, Exod. xxxiv. 6).</p>  
<p>We intended in explaining these three terms to prepare the reader for the next chapter.</p>
