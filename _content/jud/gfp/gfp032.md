### CHAPTER XXII

IN Hebrew, the verb *bo* signifies "to come" as applied to a living
being, i.e., its arrival at a certain place, or approach to a certain
person, as "Thy brother came (*ba*) with subtilty" (Gen. xxvii. 35). It
next denotes (with regard to a living being) "to enter" a certain place,
e.g., "And when Joseph came (*va-yabo*) into the house" (Gen. xliii.
26); "When ye come (*ta-boü*) into the land" (Exod. Xii. 25). The term
was also employed metaphorically in the sense of "to come" applied to a
certain event, that is, to something incorporeal, as "When thy sayings
come to pass (*yabo*)" (Judg. xiii. 17); "Of that which will come
(*yaboü*) over thee" (Isa. xlvii. 13). Nay, it is even applied to
privatives, e.g., "Yet evil came (*va-yabo*)" (Job iii. 26); "And
darkness came (*va-yabo*)" Now, since the word has been applied to
incorporeal things, it has also been used in reference to God-to the
fulfilment of His word, or to the manifestation of His Presence (the
Shechinah). In this figurative sense it is said, "Lo, I come (*ba*) unto
thee in a thick cloud" (Exod. xix. 9); "For the Lord the God of Israel
cometh (*ba*) through it" (Ezek. xliv. 2). In these and all similar
passages, the coming of the Shechinah is meant, but the words, "And the
Lord my God shall come (*u-ba*)" (Zech. xiv. 5) are identical with "His
word will come," that is to say, the promises which He made through the
Prophets will be fulfilled; therefore Scripture adds "all the holy ones
that are with thee," that is to say, "The word of the Lord my God will
be performed, which has been spoken by all the holy ones who are with
thee, who address the Israelites."
