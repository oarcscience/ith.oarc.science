### PREFACE TO VOLUME ONE OF THE FIRST EDITION

IN compliance with a desire repeatedly expressed by the Committee of the
Hebrew Literature Society, I have undertaken to translate Maimonides
*Dalalāt* *al-Ḥairin*, better known by the Hebrew title *Moreh
Nebuchim*, and I offer the first instalment of my labours in the present
volume. This contains--(1) A short Life of Maimonides, in which special
attention is given to his alleged apostasy. (2) An analysis of the whole
of the Moreh Nebuchim. (3) A translation of the First Part of this work
from the Arabic, with explanatory and critical notes.

Parts of the Translation have been contributed by Mr. Joseph Abrahams,
B.A., PhḌ., and Rev. H. Gollancz--the Introduction by the former, and
the first twenty-five chapters by the latter.

In conclusion I beg to tender my thanks to Rev. A. Loewy, Editor of the
Publications of the Hebrew Literature Society, for his careful revision
of my manuscript and proofs, and to Mr. A. Neubauer, M.A., for his
kindness in supplying me with such information as I required.

M. FRIEDLÄNDER.

Jews’ College, *June* 1881.
