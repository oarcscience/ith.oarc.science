### CHAPTER XLIV

THE Hebrew *‘ayin* is a homonym, signifying "fountain"; e.g., "By a
fountain (*‘en*) of water" (Gen. xvi. 7). It next denotes "eye"; comp.
(*‘ayin*) "Eye for eye" (Exod. xxi. 24). Another meaning of the word is
"providence," as it is said concerning Jeremiah, "Take him and direct
thine attention (*eneka*) to him" (Jer. xxxix. 12). In this figurative
sense it is to be understood when used in reference to God; e.g., "And
my providence and my pleasure shall be there perpetually" (1 Kings ix.
3), as we have already explained (page [140](gfp085.htm#page_140)); "The
eyes (*‘ene*), i.e., the Providence of the Lord thy God, are always upon
it" (Deut. xi. 12); "They are the eyes (*‘ene*) of the Lord, which run
to and fro through the whole earth" (Zech. iv. 10), i.e., His providence
is extended over everything that is on earth, as will be explained in
the chapters in which we shall treat of Providence. When, however, the
word "eye" is connected with the verb "to see," (*raah* or *ḥazah*) as
in "Open thine eyes, and see" (1 Kings xix. 16); "His eyes behold" (Ps.
xi. 4), the phrase denotes perception of the mind, not that of the
senses: for every sensation is a passive state, as is well known to you,
and God is active, never passive, as will be explained by me.
