### CHAPTER XXIX

THE term *‘eẓeb* is homonymous, denoting, in the first place, pain and
trembling; comp. "In sorrow (*be-‘eẓeb*) thou shalt bring forth
children" (Gen. iii. 16). Next it denotes anger; comp. "And his father
had not made him angry (*‘aẓabo*) at any time" (1 Kings i. 6); "for he
was angry (*ne‘eẓab*) for the sake of David" (1 Sam. xx. 34). The term
signifies also provocation: comp. "They rebelled, and vexed (*‘iẓẓebu*)
his holy spirit" (Isa. lxiii. 10); "and provoked (*ya‘aẓibahu*) him in
the desert" (Ps. lxxviii. 40); "If there be any way of provocation
(*‘oẓeb*) in me" (*ib*. cxxxix. 24); "Every day they rebel (*ye‘aẓẓebu*)
against my words" (*ib*. lvi. 6).

In Genesis vi. 6 the word has either the second or the third
signification. In the first case, the sense of the Hebrew *va-yit‘aẓẓeb
el libbo* is "God was angry with them on account of the wickedness of
their deeds" as to the words "to his heart" used here, and also in the
history of Noah (*ib*. viii. 21) I will here explain what they mean.
With regard to man, we use the expression "he said to himself," or "he
said in his heart," in reference to a subject which he did not utter or
communicate to any other person. Similarly the phrase "And God said in
his heart," is used in reference to an act which God decreed without
mentioning it to any prophet at the time the event took place according
to the will of God. And a figure of this kind is admissible, since "the
Torah speaketh in accordance with the language of man" (*supra* c.
xxvi.). This is plain and clear. In the Pentateuch no distinct mention
is made of a message sent to the wicked generation of the flood,
cautioning or threatening them with death; therefore, it is said
concerning them, that God was angry with them in His heart; likewise
when He decreed that no flood should happen again, He did not tell a
prophet to communicate it to others, and for that reason the words "in
his heart" are added.

Taking the verb in the third signification, we explain the passage thus:
"And man rebelled against God's will concerning him"; for *leb* (heart)
also signifies "will," as we shall explain when treating of the
homonymity of *leb* (heart).
