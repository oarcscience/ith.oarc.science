### CHAPTER XLII

*Ḥai* ("living") signifies a sentient organism (lit. "growing" and
"having sensation"), comp. "Every moving thing that liveth" (Gen. ix.
3); it also denotes recovery from a severe illness: "And was recovered
(*va-yeḥi*) of his sickness" (Isa. xxxviii. 9); "In the camp till they
recovered" (*ḥayotam*) (Josh. v. 8); "quick, raw (*ḥai*) flesh" (Lev.
xiii. 10).

*Mavet* signifies "death" and "severe illness," as in "His heart died
(*va-yamot*) within him, and he became as a stone" (1 Sam. xxv. 37),
that is, his illness was severe. For this reason it is stated concerning
the son of the

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

woman of Zarephath, "And his sickness was so sore, that there was no
breath left in him" (1 Kings xvii. 17). The simple expression
*va-yamoth* would have given the idea that he was very ill, near death,
like Nabal when he heard what had taken place.

Some of the Andalusian authors say that his breath was suspended, so
that no breathing could be perceived at all, as sometimes an invalid is
seized with a fainting fit or an attack of asphyxia, and it cannot be
discovered whether he is alive or dead: in this condition the patient
may remain a day or two.

The term *ḥai* has also been employed in reference to the acquisition of
wisdom. Comp. "So shall they be life (*ḥayyim*) unto thy soul" (Prov.
iii. 22); "For whoso findeth me findeth life" (*ib*. viii. 35); "For
they are life (*hayyim*) to those that find them" (*ib*. iv. 22). Such
instances are numerous. In accordance with this metaphor, true
principles are called life, and corrupt principles death. Thus the
Almighty says, "See, I have set before thee this day life and good and
death and evil" (Deut. xxx. 15), showing that "life" and "good," "death"
and "evil," are identical, and then He explains these terms. In the same
way I understand His words, "That ye may live" (*ib*. v. 33), in
accordance with the traditional interpretation of "That it may be well
with thee" \[*scil*. in the life to come\] (*ib*. xxii. 7). In
consequence of the frequent use of this figure in our language our Sages
said, "The righteous even in death are called living, while the wicked
even in life are called dead." (*Talm. B. Berakkoth*, p. 78). Note this
well.
