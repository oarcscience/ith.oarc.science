*The Weasel and the Well*.

A young man, upon his journeys through the country, fell in with a young
woman, and they became mutually attached. When the young man was obliged
to leave the neighbour-hood of the damsel's residence, they met to say
"good-by." During the parting they pledged a mutual faith, and each
promised to wait until, in the course of time, they might be able to
marry. "Who will be the witness of our betrothal?" said the young man.
Just then they saw a weasel run past them and disappear in the wood.
"See," he continued, "this weasel and this well of water by which we are
standing shall be the witnesses of our betrothal;" and so they parted.
Years passed, the maiden remained true, but the youth married. A son was
born to him, and grew up the delight of his parents. One day while the
child was playing he became tired, and lying upon the ground fell
asleep. A weasel bit him in the neck, and he bled to death. The parents
were consumed with grief by this calamity, and it was not until another
son was given them that they forgot their sorrow. But when this second
child was able to walk alone it wandered without the house, and bending
over the well, looking at its shadow in the water, lost its balance and
was drowned. Then the father recollected his perjured vow, and his
witnesses, the weasel and the well. He told his wife of the
circumstance, and she agreed to a divorce. He then sought the maiden to
whom he had promised marriage, and found her still awaiting his return.
He told her how, through God's agency, he had been punished for his
wrongdoing, after which they married and lived in peace.
