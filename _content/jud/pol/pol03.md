# INTRODUCTION.

# THE TALMUD,

### ITS NATURE AND SCOPE, WITH A CHRONOLOGICAL TABLE OF ITS COMPILATION.

THE "Talmud" is a collection of early Biblical discussions, with the
comments of generations of teachers who devoted their lives to the study
of the Scriptures. It is an encyclopædia of law, civil and penal, human
and divine. It is more, however, than a mere book of laws. It records
the thoughts, rather than the events, of a thousand years of the
national life of the Jewish people; all their oral traditions, carefully
gathered and preserved with a love devout in its trust and simplicity.
Accepted as a standard study, it became endeared to the people, who, as
they were forbidden to add to or diminish from the law of Moses, would
not suffer this work of their Rabbis to be tampered with in any manner.
As it was originally compiled it has been transmitted to us. It is a
literary wilderness. At the first view, everything style, method, and
language, seems tangled and confused. The student, however, will soon
observe two motives or currents in the work; at times harmonious, at
times diverse. One displaying the logical mind, which compares,
investigates, developes, and instructs; the other, imaginative and
poetical. The first is called "Halachah" (Rule), and finds a vast field
in the Levitical and ceremonial laws; the other

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

takes possession of the ethical and historical portions of Holy Writ. It
is called "Hagadah," or Legend, not so much in our present acceptance of
the term, as in the wider sense of a saying without positive authority,
an allegory, a parable, a tale.

The Talmud is divided into two parts, *Mishna* and *Gemarah*. They are
the continued works of successive Rabbis, chiefs or principals of the
colleges in which they devoted their lives to study. Most of the
*redacteurs* of the *Mishna* were dead, however, long before the
*Gemarah* was commenced. The time consumed in the completion of the
entire Talmud is stated to have been three hundred and eleven years. In
its present form it consists of twelve folio volumes, containing the
precepts of the Pentateuch with extended commentaries upon them;
amplified Biblical incidents; occurrences affecting the religious life
of those who prepared it; philosophical treatises; stories, traditions,
and parables. It was called the oral or unwritten law, in
contradistinction to the Pentateuch, which remained under all
circumstances, the immutable code, the divinely given constitution, the
*written* law.

The guardianship of the laws and traditions was vested in the chiefs of
the colleges, known as "Scribes," "Men of the Great Synod," "Princes and
Fathers of the House of Judgment." They instructed the people, preached
in the synagogues, and taught in the schools. Nothing was allowed to
seriously interrupt their duties. Palestine was ruled by various
dynasties; the masters were martyred; the academies were destroyed; to
study the law was made a crime against the state; yet the chain of
living tradition remained intact. The dying masters appointed their
successors, and for one academy destroyed, three new ones sprang up in
another quarter.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

These masters were superior men, mentally and physically, and the scope
of their learning was almost unlimited. To be eligible to the position,
they were required to be men of well-balanced mind, neither too young
nor too old, that their judgment might be neither hasty nor enfeebled.
They were required to be thorough linguists, to be masters of the
sciences of mathematics, botany, and natural history, and familiar with
the arts as well as the sciences.

The highest rank in the estimation of the people belonged to these
*Chachamim*, wise men. Many of them were humble tradesmen, yet they were
considered greater than priest or noble. Idleness was particularly
abhorred by them, and piety and learning were considered deserving of
their full meed of homage only when joined to active, bodily work,

Among the common sayings of the time, we find these:

"It is well to add a trade to your studies if you would remain free from
sin."

"The tradesman at his work is the equal of the most learned doctor."

"He who derives his livelihood from the labour of his hands is as great
as he who fears God."

The laws, traditions, and ordinances, during many hundred years, grew to
such immense proportions, that some better method of their preservation
than their scattered and chiefly unwritten form, became a necessity.
Three different attempts were made to reduce them into system and order.
The third alone was successful.

The progress of these laws, &c., from their revelation and conception
till their final rest in the Talmud, is thus traced in the writings of
Maimonides.

During the last forty years of the life of Moses, the Lord gave to him
six hundred and thirteen precepts, including the Decalogue, with full
explanation of their meaning and intent,

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

that he might be able to properly instruct the people. The manner in
which Moses imparted these precepts to the chosen race is thus recorded
in the treatise *Erubim*. First, he called his brother Aaron into his
tent and spoke to him alone, all the words which God had commanded; the
sons of Aaron were then admitted and the same words repeated to them;
the seventy elders of the people were then called before Moses, and from
his lips received the commandments and ordinances of their God, and then
any of the people who so desired were allowed to enter the tent, and to
them Moses spoke again the same words. Thus Aaron heard these precepts
four times, his sons thrice, the elders twice, and the people once, from
the lips of Moses. After this first course of instruction, the prophet
retired and Aaron repeated the precepts; then his sons spoke the words
which they had heard; the elders reiterated them, and thus were the
commands delivered to Moses, impressed upon the minds of the people, who
were authorised in turn to teach one another. The precepts themselves
were written on rolls of parchment, but the explanations thereof became
the basis of the oral law, the foundation and substance of the Talmud.
These six hundred and thirteen precepts were given between the years
2448 and 2488 (1312 and 1272 B. C. E.).

"And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the
first day of the month," that Moses called all the people together and
said unto them, "My last days on earth are drawing nigh. If there be any
among you who have forgotten the precepts of the Lord which I have
taught to you, speak now and I will repeat them; or if there be any one
among you to whom the law is not clear, and who desires an explanation
of any point, behold I am here to answer his questions."

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

Thus, on the first day of *Shebat* (February), Moses began to repeat and
explain the law and its traditions, as it is written: "On this side of
the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law,
saying" (Deut. 1: 5).

On the seventh day of Adar (March) he concluded this labour. He wrote
thirteen copies of the Pentateuch upon parchment. He gave one copy into
the keeping of each of the tribes, and the thirteenth he placed in the
hands of the Levites, saying, "Take this book of the law and put it at
the side of the ark."

At noon, "on this self-same day," the Lord said to Moses: "Go up to the
Mount Nebo." The earthly pilgrimage of the great prophet was completed,
the rest of Heaven and the smile of God was his for evermore, and upon
his friend and servant Joshua devolved the duty to teach and to observe.

Joshua was born in the year 2406. He was eighty-two years of age when he
became the leader of the people, and he died in the year 2516. After his
death, the elders, chief among whom were Caleb and Pinechas, undertook
the duty of preserving a general knowledge of the oral laws. They lived
about seventeen years after Joshua's death, and then the charge
descended to the judges and the prophets. First of these was Eli, the
High Priest. He became judge in 2830, the same year in which Samuel was
born, and he died in 2870, one year after Samuel had succeeded to his
office. Samuel judged the people eleven years, yielding up his spirit
whence it came upon the 28th of *Iyar* (May), 2882. The sacred
guardianship fell then to David the son of Jesse, from him it descended
to Achiyah the Shelomite, and from him to the pure Elijah. In the year
3047 Elijah ascended to Heaven, and, with his mantle, his duties
devolved upon Elisha, his pupil. Then Yehoyada, Zecheriah, Hosea,

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Isaiah, Micah, and
Joel were the successive guardians of the law and its growing "fences"
and traditions. Nahum, Zephaniah, Jeremiah, and Baruch, the son of
Neriah, succeeded these, and in the year 3413 the duty devolved upon
Ezra, high priest, scribe, and prophet. Ezra was a member of the great
senate, composed of one hundred and twenty members, which introduced a
regular order of prayers for divine service. (Previously the people had
composed their own prayers--words from their hearts, appropriate to
their circumstances and conditions. They had but three set prayers,
portions of the Pentateuch, recited from the moment of its existence,
viz.: "Hear, O Israel" (Deut. 6: 4-10) "And it shall come to pass"
(Deut. 11: 13-22); and "The Lord spoke to Moses, saying" (Numb. 20: 31
to end).

After the death of Ezra, the guardianship fell successively upon
Antigonus of Socho, Jose, the son of Joazur of Serada, Jose, the son of
Jochanan of Jerusalem, Judah, the son of Tabai, Shemiah, Abtalyon, and
then to Hillel, the great teacher and sage in Israel. Hillel was chief
of the college, and among his pupils was Shamai, a learned man, but of
hasty temper and fond of argument. He seceded from Hillel's college and
organised another one over which he presided. The controversies between
the two were long, sharp, and exhaustive.

Hillel was called the Hillel of Babel, having been born in that place.
At the age of forty years he journeyed to Jerusalem, in order that he
might study with Shemiah and Abtalyon. He pursued his studies for forty
years, and was chief of the college for forty years, dying when he was
one hundred and twenty years old. He was a very meek man, and the many
dissensions at the college of Hillel, which form a not insignificant
portion of the Biblical commentaries, owe their existence to the
polemical disposition of

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

his friend Shamai. To Hillel the necessity of arranging, simplifying,
and committing to writing the great bulk of oral law and tradition
seemed first to present itself in full force. He commenced the work in
the year 3728; but, though he succeeded in arranging and condensing some
six hundred sections into six volumes, he died while the work was still
far from completion.

The generations which followed Hillel and Shamai were even more disposed
to controversies than had been their predecessors, and for a century
nothing was added to Hillel's work. The guardianship of the traditions
fell to his son Simon, then to Simon's son, Gamliel. Rabbi Shimnon, the
son of Gamliel, was the thirty-fourth teacher into whose especial charge
they were given, and from him they descended to Rabbi Judah, the
successful *redacteur*, commonly called, by reason of his great
eminence, "Rabbi."

Rabbi Judah was a man of immense learning, of a progressive mind, and
thoroughly versed in the sciences of his day. The Emperor Antoninus
conceived for him a respect and affection which resulted in many marks
of favour and distinction. Through his influence with the Roman ruler he
was enabled to do much towards the benefit of his race. His great desire
was to create among the people a love for the study of the law, and a
familiarity with its beauties and its moral and religious code. He saw
that a complete knowledge of the law was limited to a comparatively few,
who were dispersed through many countries, and he feared it might in
time be entirely forgotten if the interest in its study was allowed to
decrease as it had for some time been diminishing. With the aid of the
sages and pupils of his college he set diligently to work, and
collecting the rules, explanations, and traditions extant since the
death of

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Moses, he
inscribed them into six volumes, which he called the *Mishna*, or
"Second Law." In the year 3978, one hundred and fifty years after the
destruction of the second temple, the redaction was completed. Many of
the laws were already obsolete, even on their first publication. Rome
had long before substituted her own penal code for that belonging to the
Jewish nationality; the minute injunctions regulating the sacrifices and
the temple services had but an ideal value, and many of the other laws
applied particularly to Palestine, where but comparatively few of the
people remained. Yet the whole was received in Palestine and Babylonia,
not merely as a record of the past, but as a holy work, an infallible
text-book, a record of laws that, with the restoration of the
commonwealth, would come into practice as in time past. All Israel gave
thanks for the completion of this great undertaking.

The six sections into which the Mishna was divided may be indexed as
follows:

SECTION I., *Seeds*: The Agrarian Laws. Tithes and Donations to Priests,
Levites, and the Poor. The Sabbatical Year. Prohibited Mixtures in
Plants, Animals, and Garments.

SECTION II., *Feasts*: Sabbaths, Festivals, and Fast Days; the
Ceremonies Ordained, and the Sacrifices to be offered on them. Special
chapters are given to the Passover, the New Year's Feast, the Day of
Atonement, Succoth, and Purim.

SECTION III., Woman: Betrothal, Marriage, and Divorce. Vows and
Obligations.

SECTION IV., *Damages*: This section includes the major portion of the
Civil and Criminal Law. Ordinary Money Transactions. Idolatry.
Witnesses. Legal Punishments, and "Sentences of the Fathers."

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

SECTION V., *Sacred Things*: Sacrifices. First Born Children.
Measurements and Details of the Temple and its Utensils.

SECTION VI., *Purification*: Levitical and Hygienic Laws. Impure persons
and things, and the methods for their purification.

Among the Rabbis who assisted Rabbi Judah were his sons, Rabbi Simon and
Rabbi Gamliel.

The Mishna being formed into a code, became in its turn what the
Scriptures had been to it--a basis of development and discussion. After
the death of Rabbi Judah, his successors, Rab and Samuel, began
explanations of its principles. These were continued in a second
generation by Rabbi Judah bar Ezekiel, principal of the college at
Nehardea, and Rabbi Hunah, principal of the college at Sura. The latter
died in 4056, and until the sixth generation, 4127, the oral
commentaries upon the *Mishna*, now known as the *Gemarah*, were
continued.

Rab Ashi inaugurated the collection of these commentaries, and it is
said that from the days of Rabbi Judah the Chief, never was the study of
the law so prevalent as during the life of this latter Rabbi. He died in
4180, before he had completed his undertaking; and his successors, Mar
and Meremar, the latter being his son, were the last of the generations
of the "Rabbis of the Talmud."

The Talmud is without doubt the most reliable record of Jewish law and
tradition, yet its popularity is due more to the force of circumstances
than to its general acceptance at the time of its redaction. During the
bitter persecution of the Jews in Persia the schools were closed, and
oral instruction being in a great measure interfered with, the book
obtained a hold and authority which its authors never intended. This
applies, of course, to its legal portions; the

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

legendary portion, the *Haggadah*, was poetry, imaginative fancy. But
though the Rabbis themselves considered the latter of secondary
importance, and explained its character, the majority of the people
clung to it, and regarded the Talmud as a complete whole, worthy of
their reverence.
