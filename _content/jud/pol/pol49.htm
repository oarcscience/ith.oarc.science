<p align="center"><i>Truth</i>.</p>  
<p>When God was about to create man the angels gathered about him. Some of them opening their lips exclaimed, "Create, oh God, a being who shall praise Thee from earth even as we in heaven sing Thy glory."</p>  
<p>But others said:</p>  
<p>"Hear us, Almighty King, create no more! The glorious</p>

<p>harmony of the heavens which Thou hast sent to earth will be by man disturbed, destroyed."</p>  
<p>Then silence fell upon the contesting hosts as the Angel of Mercy appeared before the throne of grace on bended knees.</p>  
<p>Sweet was the voice which said entreatingly:</p>  
<p>"Oh, Father, create Thou man; make him Thine own noble image. With heavenly pity will I fill his heart, with sympathy towards every living thing impress his being; through him will they find cause to praise Thee."</p>  
<p>Then the Angel of Mercy ceased, and the Angel of Peace with tearful eyes spoke thus:</p>  
<p>"O God, create him not! Thy peace he will disturb, the flow of blood will follow sure his coming. Confusion, horror, war, will blot the earth, and Thou wilt no longer find a pleasant place among Thy. works on earth."</p>  
<p>Then spoke in stern tones the Angel of Justice:</p>  
<p>"And Thou wilt judge him, God; he shall be subject to my sway."</p>  
<p>The Angel of Truth approached, saying:</p>  
<p>"Cease! Oh God of truth, with man Thou sendest falsehood to the earth."</p>  
<p>Then all were silent, and out of the deep quietness the Divine words came:</p>  
<p>"Thou, oh Truth, shalt go to earth with him, and yet remain a denizen of heaven; 'twixt heaven and earth to float, connecting link between the two."</p>
