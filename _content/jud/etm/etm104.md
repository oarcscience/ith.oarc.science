# XXIII. TREATISE YEBAMOTH.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introduction</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> Treatise contains laws relating to
the precept of *Yeboom*, i.e. the obligation of marrying the childless
widow of a deceased brother (see Deut. xxv. 5–11), and the ceremony of
*Chalitzah*, or the taking off the shoe by the widow to her
brother-in-law, in case he refuses to marry her (Deut. xxv. 9).

In the first place, it must be premised that a surviving brother can
marry only one of his brother's widows, and when the deceased brother
has left several wives, and many brothers, the obligation of Yeboom is
incumbent on one of the brothers, and of the widows only, and when that
duty has been observed by them, all the others are released therefrom
(Maimonides Hilchoth Yeboom, vol. ii. chap. i. § 9).

Secondly, that when circumstances exist which would render such marriage
unlawful; as, for instance, if the parties were related to each other
within the degree of consanguinity prohibited by the Holy Law to
intermarry, the precept of Yeboom is superseded, and even the ceremony
of *Chalitzah* is unnecessary.

Thirdly, that when the brother-in-law cannot marry the widow on account
of near affinity, he may not marry any of the other wives of his
deceased brother, who in the technical term of the Mishna are called
rivals, ‏צרות‎ (see our first note).

This Treatise contains also many regulations having reference to the
marriage laws in general, and is the first of the class or division of
the Mishna called ‏נשים‎, or laws relating to *women* \[i.e. to
marriage, divorce, &c.\], because Yeboom is not a voluntary action, like
marriage, or divorce, as the person on whom that duty devolves can be
judicially compelled either to marry his widowed sister-in-law, or to
allow her to perform the ceremony of Chalitzah to him.

We have found it indispensable, in order to avoid the almost constant

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

repetition of tedious circumlocution and periphrase, to retain a few
Hebrew terms which recur in almost every section, viz. ‏יבום‎ *Yeboom;*
and ‏חליצה‎, *Chalitzah;* which have already been explained; also ‏גט‎,
*get*, letter of divorce; and ‏כתובה‎, *ketoobah;* or marriage contract.
