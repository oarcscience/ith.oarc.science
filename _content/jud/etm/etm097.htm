<p>&sect; 1. Inhabitants of a town who have sold the open [or marketplace]</p>  
<p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></A></p>  
<p>of the town,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_588"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> may buy for that money a synagogue. The money obtained by the sale of a synagogue, they may apply to the purchase of an ark [to keep the rolls of the Holy Law in]; for that obtained by the sale of such an ark, cloaks or wrappers for the rolls of the Holy Law may be purchased; for the produce of such wrappers, sacred books&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_592"></A><A HREF="#fn_589"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> may be purchased; for the produce of sacred books, a roll of the Holy Law may be purchased; but if they had sold a roll of the Holy Law, it will not be lawful to apply that money for the purchase of [other] sacred books, nor wrappers for the proceeds of sacred books, nor an ark for the proceeds of wrappers, nor a synagogue with the proceeds of an ark, nor an open [or market] place with the money obtained by the sale of a synagogue,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_593"></A><A HREF="#fn_590"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and even so in respect to any surplus fund. According to R. Meir, it is unlawful to sell sacred public property to private individuals, because its sanctity becomes thereby lowered: but the sages replied, "If so, it would be also prohibited for a large town to sell sacred things to a smaller one."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. A synagogue may, according to R. Meir, only be sold on condition that it may at any time be repurchased by the original owners; but the sages permit it to be sold permanently, only it may not be sold to be applied to the following occupations: namely, as a bathing-house, as a tanning place [or pit], as a diving-bath, and as a laundry. R. Jehudah says, "It may be sold on the condition that it be made an open court, and then the purchaser is at liberty to turn it to what purpose he pleases."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. R. Jehudah teaches also, that no funeral orations may be delivered in a synagogue which had become ruinous, nor may it be used as a rope-walk,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_594"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> nor to spread nets therein [to dry, &amp;c.], nor to spread fruit on its roof, nor to use it as a short cut,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_595"></A><A HREF="#fn_592"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> as it is said (Lev. xxvi. 31), "I will bring your sanctuaries into desolation," that is, they remain sanctuaries even in their desolation.

<p>&sect; 4. When the new moon of Adar happens on a Sabbath, the section Shekalim (Exod. xxx. 11), is to be read; if it happen on any other day, that section must he read on the preceding Sabbath, and nothing additional is read on the following Sabbath. On the second, the section &#8207;&#1494;&#1499;&#1493;&#1512;&#8206; (Deut. xv. 14), is to be read; on the third, that of the red heifer, &#8207;&#1508;&#1512;&#1492;&#8206; (Num. xix); on the fourth, that of &#8207;&#1492;&#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#8206; (Exod. xvii); on the fifth, they return again to the regular order.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_596"></A><A HREF="#fn_593"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> The regular order [of Aphtoroth] is also to be interrupted on the feast of new moon, on that of dedication, on Pureem,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_597"></A><A HREF="#fn_594"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and on public fast-days, also on the fast of the standing men.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_598"></A><A HREF="#fn_595"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 5. On [the first day of] Passover, the section in Leviticus relative to the festival must be read; on the feast of weeks, that commencing, "Seven weeks shall ye count," &amp;c. (Deut. xvi); on the feast of new year, the section commencing, "In the seventh month, on the first day of the month" (Num. xxix. 1); on the day of atonement, that of &#8207;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514;&#8206; (Lev. xvi.); on the first day of the feast of tabernacles, the section in Leviticus relative to the festivals must be read; and on the other days of that festival, the offerings for each day (Num. xxix. 17).</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. On the feast of dedication, the section of the offerings of the princes (Num. vii.) must be read; on Pureem, that of &#8207;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488; &#1506;&#1502;&#1500;&#1511;&#8206; (Exod. ix. 8); on the feast of new moon, &#8207;&#1493;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1497; &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;&#8206; (Num. xviii. 11); on the fast-days for the standing men, the history of the creation (Gen. i., &amp;c.);&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_599"></A><A HREF="#fn_596"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> on fast-days, the section containing the blessings and maledictions (Lev. xxvi. 3), the denunciations therein contained must be read without interruption, namely, one man must read the whole [chapter]. On Mondays and Thursdays, and on the Sabbath afternoon, they shall read the section of the law in its regular order, but these readings are not available to reduce the regular number:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_600"></A><A HREF="#fn_597"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> for it is said, Lev. xxiii. 44, "Moses declared</p>
