<p><a name="page_325"><font size="1" color="green">p. 325</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER I.</h3>  
<p>&sect; 1. All persons are qualified to slaughter [animals allowed to be eaten], and what has been properly slaughtered by them may be lawfully eaten. Deaf and dumb, or demented persons, or minors, are, however, excepted from this rule, because they are liable to make mistakes in slaughtering. That which was slaughtered by a heathen must be considered as Nebelah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1154"></A><A HREF="#fn_1149"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and like that pollutes the person who carries it.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1155"></A><A HREF="#fn_1150"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> When the slaughtering was done by night [i.e., in the dark], or by a blind person, it is Cash&eacute;r.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1156"></A><A HREF="#fn_1151"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> If a person slaughtered on the Sabbath or on the Day of Atonement, although he has by that act forfeited his life, yet what he has slaughtered is Cash&eacute;r.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. When a person had cut the throat [of an animal] with a hand sickle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1157"></A><A HREF="#fn_1152"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> a sharp flint stone, or with a reed, it is Cash&eacute;r. All&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1158"></A><A HREF="#fn_1153"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> may slaughter, at any time, and with any instrument, excepting a reaping hook, a saw, the [sharp] teeth [of animals fixed in the maxillary bone], or with the finger nail,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1159"></A><A HREF="#fn_1154"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> because the [first mentioned three] do not cut, but strangle [and tear]. When a person slaughtered an animal with a reaping hook, having teeth or notches, with the first or down stroke or cut only,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1160"></A><A HREF="#fn_1155"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> it is unfit for use according to Beth Shammai, but Beth Hillel hold it to be Cash&eacute;r; but if the teeth of the reaping hook had been ground away [so as to give it a sharp and even edge] it is the same as a knife.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. Should a person have to cut through the great or top ring of the trachea or windpipe, that but the width of a thread of the whole circumference of the ring remained [on the upper part], the animal</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="green">p. 326</font></A></p>  
<p>so killed is Cash&eacute;r. R. Jos&eacute; bar Jehudah saith, "It is Cash&eacute;r when the greatest part of this breadth remained."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1161"></A><A HREF="#fn_1156"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 4. An animal which was slaughtered by being cut at either side of the throat is Cash&eacute;r, but if the neck of a bird brought as a sacrifice was wrung off&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1162"></A><A HREF="#fn_1157"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> sideways, it is thereby rendered an unfit sacrifice. If an animal was cut from the neck downwards,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1163"></A><A HREF="#fn_1158"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> it becomes unlawful for use, but a bird whose neck was thus wrung is a valid sacrifice. An animal which was cut below the throat is Cash&eacute;r, but the wringing off of birds&#8217; heads from below the throat render them unfit sacrifices, because the whole region of the neck is appropriate for the wringing off of the head [of birds], and the whole region of the throat for slaughtering [animals], therefore whatever [in respect to cutting] renders an animal Cash&eacute;r, must render a bird thus treated an unfit sacrifice, and the same in the reverse case.</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. That which makes turtle-doves proper sacrifices,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1164"></A><A HREF="#fn_1159"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> renders young pigeons improper ones, and whilst these are valid as young pigeons, they cannot be used as sacrifices of turtle-doves. When the neck feathers of either kind begin to shine and to turn yellow, they are unfit sacrifices.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1165"></A><A HREF="#fn_1160"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 6. That which constitutes a [red] heifer a proper sacrifice, invalidates the calf [whose neck was to be broken&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1166"></A><A HREF="#fn_1161"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A>], and also the reverse.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1167"></A><A HREF="#fn_1162"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> That which does not disqualify priests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1168"></A><A HREF="#fn_1163"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> [to minister in the Temple] disqualifies Levites, and the reverse. That which is [legally] clean in earthenware vessels,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1169"></A><A HREF="#fn_1164"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> renders other vessels unclean,</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p><a name="page_327"><font size="1" color="green">p. 327</font></A></p>  
<p>and the reverse takes place in other kinds of vessels.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1170"></A><A HREF="#fn_1165"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> That which is considered [legally] clean in a wooden vessel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1171"></A><A HREF="#fn_1166"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> is unclean in one of metal, and the reverse. The degree of ripeness which subjects bitter almonds to tithe, does not yet subject sweet almonds to the same;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1172"></A><A HREF="#fn_1167"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> and when the latter become subject, the bitter ones are already free from the obligation of tithe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1173"></A><A HREF="#fn_1168"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 7. An infusion of water on grape lees which has not yet fermented, may not be bought for the money of second tithe,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1174"></A><A HREF="#fn_1169"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> and renders a bath, however, unfit [for legal cleansing];&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1175"></A><A HREF="#fn_1170"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> but when it has fermented it may be purchased for the money of second tithe, and its admixture does not render a bath unfit&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1176"></A><A HREF="#fn_1171"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> Brothers who, after sharing the inheritance from their parents, have entered into partnership, are not bound to pay the tithe of cattle while they are liable to the Kalbon,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1177"></A><A HREF="#fn_1172"><FONT SIZE="1">24</FONT></A> but whilst they are liable to the payment of cattle-tithe they are not subject to the Kalbon. While the right of sale is vested in the father [who may during the minority of his daughter sell her as a handmaid] no fine can be imposed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1178"></A><A HREF="#fn_1173"><FONT SIZE="1">25</FONT></A> and when damages can be legally claimed the right of sale ceases. Whilst the right of refusal is in force&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1179"></A><A HREF="#fn_1174"><FONT SIZE="1">26</FONT></A> Chalitzah does not take place,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1180"></A><A HREF="#fn_1175"><FONT SIZE="1">27</FONT></A> and when that ceremony</p>  
<p>

<p>is performed the right of refusal is no longer applicable. When the cornet is sounded&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1181"></A><A HREF="#fn_1176"><FONT SIZE="1">28</FONT></A> no Habdallah is said, and when that is said the cornet is not sounded. When a festival happens on the eve of the Sabbath the cornet is sounded, but the Habdallah is not said. If on the day after the Sabbath, it is said, but the cornet is not sounded. What is the form of the [prayer] Habdallah? [Blessed art thou, &amp;c.] "who makest a distinction between holy and holy;" but according to R. Dosa, "who makest a distinction between the greater and minor degrees of holiness."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_1163"></A><A HREF="etm151.htm#fr_1168">326:15</A> Viz., age. For priests are not disqualified to minister in the temple but on account of having contracted a corporeal blemish. This does not disqualify Levites, but their age disqualifies them, for when they have attained the age of fifty they are no longer to be employed in the active service of the Temple. (See Numbers viii. 25.)</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_1168"></A><A HREF="etm151.htm#fr_1173">327:20</A> Because they are only subject to the payment of tithe while they are edible, which is when they are small and not full grown.</P>
