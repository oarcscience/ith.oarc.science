<p>&sect; 1. He who in the Ketubah undertakes to his bride,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_897"></A><A HREF="#fn_892"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> "Right and title have I none to thy property," does [nevertheless] enjoy the usufruct thereof during her lifetime, and if she dies, he inherits from her.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_898"></A><A HREF="#fn_893"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Such being the case, what [then] is the effect of his undertaking to her, "Right and title have I none to thy property?" That what she sells, or gives away, is valid. Had he undertaken in writing, "Right and title have I none to thy property, nor to the usufruct thereof;" he is not entitled to the usufruct during her lifetime. R. Jehudah saith, "At all events he has the usufruct of the proceeds</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="green">p. 265</font></A></p>  
<p>of her property,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_899"></A><A HREF="#fn_894"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> unless he undertakes to her, 'Right and title have I none to thy property, nor to the fruits thereof, nor to the proceeds of these fruits [henceforth and] for ever.' Had he undertaken to her, 'Right and title have I none to thy property, nor to the fruits thereof [or to the proceeds of these fruits]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_900"></A><A HREF="#fn_895"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> during thy lifetime, nor at thy death,' he does not enjoy the usufruct during leer life, and at her decease he does not inherit of her." R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "At her decease he does inherit of her, because he has contracted [to do that which is] opposed to what is written in the law; and whosoever contracts [to do that which is] opposed to what is written in the law, his contract is null and void."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. Should a man dying leave a wife, creditors and heirs, and his property, either as a trust or as a loan is in the hands of other persons, R. Tarphon holds, "It must be given up to the weakest among them."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_901"></A><A HREF="#fn_896"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> But R. Akivah remarked, "No commiseration [must interfere with] the administration of justice; therefore it [the property] must be given up to the heirs, for all others [creditors] must be sworn,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_902"></A><A HREF="#fn_897"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> whereas the heirs need not be sworn."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_903"></A><A HREF="#fn_898"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 3. If he&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_904"></A><A HREF="#fn_899"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> has left fruit reaped [gathered off the ground], whichever [of the parties concerned] first obtains possession thereof, is entitled thereto. Should the wife have taken possession of more than [the amount of] her Ketubah, or the creditor of more than [the amount of] his debt, the surplus must, according to R. Tarphon, be given to the weakest among them; but R. Akivah remarked, "No commiseration [must interfere with] the administration of justice; therefore it [the surplus] must be given up to the heirs, for all others need be sworn, but the heirs need not be sworn."</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. He who appoints his wife saleswoman [in his shop], or administratrix [manager of any part of his property], may have her</p>

<p>sworn&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_905"></A><A HREF="#fn_900"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> whenever he pleases. R. Eleazar saith, "[He may do so under any circumstances], even as to her spindle or her dough."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. If he has undertaken to her, "Vow or oath will I not impose on thee," he cannot have her sworn, but he may have her heirs sworn, and those who act under her authority. [If he has undertaken to her] "Vow or oath will I not impose on thee, nor on thy heirs, nor on those who act under thy authority,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_906"></A><A HREF="#fn_901"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> he cannot have her sworn, not her, nor her heirs, nor those who act under her authority? But his heirs can have her sworn, her, her heirs, and those who act by her authority. [If he has undertaken] "Vow or oath shall neither I, nor my heirs, nor those who act by my authority, impose on thee, or on thy heirs, or on those who act by thy authority,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_907"></A><A HREF="#fn_902"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> neither he, nor his heirs, nor any that act by his authority," can have her sworn, neither her, nor her heirs, nor those who act under her authority.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. If she [a widow circumstanced as in the preceding &sect; stated], goes [directly] from her husband's grave to her father's house, or should she return to the house of her father-in-law, but is not appointed administratrix [manager of her deceased husband's property], his heirs cannot have her sworn. But if she has been appointed administratrix, the heirs may have her sworn as to the future, but they cannot have her sworn as to the past.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_908"></A><A HREF="#fn_903"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 7. She who prejudices her own Ketubah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_909"></A><A HREF="#fn_904"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> cannot recover unless she be sworn. Should one witness bear testimony that she has [already] been paid, she cannot recover unless she be sworn. [If she is to be paid] out of orphans&#8217; property, or alienated property, or should he [the husband] be absent, she cannot recover unless she be sworn.</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. "Prejudice her Ketubah;" how [can she do so]? [Suppose] her Ketubah was a thousand zooz; the husband asserts, "Thou hast received [the whole amount of] thy Ketubah;" to which she replies, No, I have only received a hundred zooz;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_910"></A><A HREF="#fn_905"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> [in that case] she cannot recover [the amount she claims] unless she be sworn.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_911"></A><A HREF="#fn_906"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> "Should</p>

<p>one witness bear testimony that she has [already] been paid;" how [is this meant]? [Suppose] her Ketubah was a thousand zooz; the husband asserts, "Thou hast received [the whole amount of] thy Ketubah;" to which she replies, "No, thou hast only paid me a hundred zooz." Should one witness bear testimony against her, [and affirm that] she has already been paid, she cannot recover [the amount she claims] unless she be sworn. "Out of alienated property;" how [is this to be understood]? Should he [the husband] have sold his property to others, and she [seeks to] recover [the amount of her Ketubah] from the purchasers, she cannot enforce payment unless she be sworn.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_912"></A><A HREF="#fn_907"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> "Out of orphans&#8217; property;" how [is this meant]? Should he [the husband] die, and leave his property to his orphan children, and she [seeks to] recover [the amount of her Ketubah] from the orphans, she cannot enforce payment unless she be sworn. "If he [the husband] is absent;" how [is this to be understood]? If he is gone beyond seas, and she [seeks to] recover [the amount of her Ketubah] during his absence, she cannot enforce payment unless she be sworn. R. Simeon saith,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_913"></A><A HREF="#fn_908"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> "Whenever she [a widow] claims [the amount of] her Ketubah, the heirs of her husband can put her upon her oath: but if she does not claim [the amount of] her Ketubah, the heirs cannot put her upon her oath.</p>  
<p>&sect; 9. If a woman produces her Get,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_914"></A><A HREF="#fn_909"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> but does not produce a [<A HREF="errata.htm#3">written</A>] Ketubah, she is [nevertheless] entitled to recover [the standard amount of] her Ketubah.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_915"></A><A HREF="#fn_910"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> Should she produce her [written] Ketubah, but does not produce her Get, but says, "My Get is lost," to which he [the husband] replies, "My receipt [in discharge of thy Ketubah] is lost;" and likewise, in case a creditor produces his bond,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_916"></A><A HREF="#fn_911"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> but does not produce the judicial pre-monition:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_917"></A><A HREF="#fn_912"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A> [in either of these cases] they [the wife or the creditor] do not recover [the amount</p>  
<p>

<p>they respectively claim]. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Ever since the time of [public] danger began, a woman can recover [the amount of] her Ketubah without producing the Get, and a creditor can recover [the amount of] his bond without producing the judicial pre-monition. [Should she produce] two Gittin and two Ketuboth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_918"></A><A HREF="#fn_913"><FONT SIZE="1">22</FONT></A> she is entitled to recover the amounts of both Ketuboth. [Should she produce] two Ketuboth and one Get, or two Gittin and one Ketubah, or one Ketubah, one Get, and [proof of her husband's subsequent] decease,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_919"></A><A HREF="#fn_914"><FONT SIZE="1">23</FONT></A> she can only recover the amount of one Ketubah; for he who divorces his wife and takes <A HREF="errata.htm#4">her</A> back, does only take her back under the obligation of her first Ketubah. [Of] a minor, whom his father gives in marriage, the Ketubah [which he has signed] continues valid, as it is in virtue thereof that she continues his wife. Should a proselyte embrace Judaism, together with his wife, her Ketubah remains legally valid, as it is in virtue thereof that she continues his wife."</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_896"></A><A HREF="etm128.htm#fr_901">265:5</A> Some commentators hold that this expression applies to the creditor whose bond bears the latest date, and whose title is in law held to be the weakest, as he has no claim on the property which his debtor has alienated prior to that date. Others apply the expression to the wife.</P>

The fact of her not producing her written Ketubah is immaterial, for the law enacts that every woman shall have a Ketubah; it is, therefore, assumed that she has one, even though it is not in her possession.</P>
