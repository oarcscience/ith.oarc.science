<p>&sect; 1. The ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i> must take place before three judges, who may be laymen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_735"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> If it is performed with a shoe,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_736"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> it is valid, but not if with a shoe made of felt, or of cloth. The <i>Chalitzah</i> is also valid when it is performed with a sandal which has a leather strap at the heel, but not if it is not furnished with such a strap. If it is tied under the knee, it is valid, but not if it was tied above the knee.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. If <i>Chalitzah</i> was performed with a sandal which does not belong to the man, or with a wooden sandal [covered with leather], or on the right foot, with a sandal belonging to the left foot, it is valid. If with a sandal which is too large, but with which the man may walk nevertheless, or with one too small [to cover the whole foot], but which nevertheless covers the greater part of the foot, the <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid. If that ceremony was performed at night it is valid, but R. Eleazar declares it void. A <i>Chalitzah</i> performed on the left foot is void, but R. Eleazar declares it to he valid.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. If the woman took off the shoe, and did expectorate [before the brother-in-law], but did not pronounce the words [necessary to be spoken on that occasion], the <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid; if she spoke the words and expectorated, but did not take off the shoe, the <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid; if she took off the shoe and spoke the words, but did not expectorate, the <i>Chalitzah</i> is void, according to R. Eleazar; but valid according to R. Akivah. R. Eleazar thus expounds the text (Deut. xxv. 9), "Thus shall it be done," &amp;c. viz. "All acts there prescribed must be performed, and the omission of any renders the <i>Chalitzah</i> void." But R. Akivah replied, "The same text affords a proof of my opinion, for it is there stated, 'Thus shall it be done to the man;' which proves that it only relates to the acts of the man."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_742"></A><A HREF="#fn_737"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p>&sect; 4. When a deaf and dumb man had performed to him the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i>, or if a deaf and dumb woman performed it, or when a woman performed it to a minor, the <i>Chalitzah</i> is void. A female who, during her minority performed a <i>Chalitzah</i>, must repeat it on attaining her majority, otherwise the first <i>Chalitzah</i> is void.</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. When a woman gave <i>Chalitzah</i> in the presence of two, or even of three judges, if one of them happens to be related to her, or incompetent to give evidence, the <i>Chalitzah</i> is void: but R. Simeon and R. Jochanan Hasandelar declare it valid. It happened once that a man received <i>Chalitzah</i> from a woman in a prison, where none but themselves were present, and when that case was submitted to R. Akivah, he declared it a valid <i>Chalitzah</i>.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. The due performance of the precept of <i>Chalitzah</i> is as follows:&#8212;The man and his sister-in-law shall appear before the tribunal [Beth Din] who are to advise him according to circumstances, for it is said (Deut. xxv. 8), "The elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto him," &amp;c., she shall say (Deut. xxv. 7), "My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a name in Israel, he will not perform to me the duty of a husband's brother." He shall then say, "I like not to take her (Deut. xxv. 8)." This was always said in the Holy language [Hebrew], "Then shall the brother's wife come unto him, and spit out before him;" viz. so that the judges can plainly see her expectorate. Then shall she answer and say, "So shall it be done with the man that will not build up his brother's house" (Deut. xxv. 9). Thus far was it read formerly, but when R. Hyrcanus had the whole passage&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_743"></A><A HREF="#fn_738"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> read under an oak in the village Atam [&#8207;&#1506;&#1497;&#1496;&#1501;&#8206;], it became customary ever after to read the whole section. The injunction of the law (Deut. xxv. 16), "His name shall be called in Israel the house of him that hath his shoe loosened," is obligatory on the judges only,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_744"></A><A HREF="#fn_739"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> but not on the disciples present; but according to R. Jehudah, it is incumbent on every one present at the ceremony to call out three times [&#8207;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1509; &#1492;&#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#8206;], Unshod one! Unshod one! Unshod one!</p>
