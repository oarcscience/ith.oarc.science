<p>&sect; 1. A wife is acquired in three ways, and may recover her liberty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1088"></A><A HREF="#fn_1083"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in two ways. She is acquired by money, by a marriage contract, or through carnal connection [with her].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1089"></A><A HREF="#fn_1084"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> What sum of money is required [for the mentioned purpose]? According to Beth Shammai, "It must not be less than a denarius [&#8207;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1512;&#8206;] or its value;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1090"></A><A HREF="#fn_1085"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> but according to Beth Hillel, "It is sufficient if it be a &#8207;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492;&#8206;, or the value</p>

<p>thereof." What is the value of a &#8207;&#1508;&#1512;&#1493;&#1496;&#1492;&#8206;? The eighth part of an Italian asser [&#8207;&#1488;&#1497;&#1505;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1496;&#1500;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#8206;].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1091"></A><A HREF="#fn_1086"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> She regains her liberty by a Get [letter of divorce], and the death of her husband. A woman whose husband died without issue, and who is left to a brother-in-law to be married by him according to the laws of Yeboom, is fully acquired by the brother-in-law as a wife by carnal connection with her. She regains her liberty either by performing the ceremony of Chalitzah, or by the death of her brother-in-law.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. A Hebrew slave becomes his master's property by money paid for his purchase, or by virtue of a contract, and recovers his liberty by [the termination of his] years [of servitude], by the Jubilee, and by the decrease in the value of his original purchase money through his <A HREF="errata.htm#7">servitude</A>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1092"></A><A HREF="#fn_1087"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> A Hebrew bondwoman's rights are more extensive than those of the Hebrew bondman, inasmuch as she regains her liberty when she produces the signs [of puberty]. A slave, who after six years of service wishes to remain with his master, is acquired by the latter through the act of piercing the slave's ear [Exod. xxi. 6], and recovers his liberty by the Jubilee, or the death of his master.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. A Canaanite slave is acquired by money paid for his purchase, a contract, or by any act of the slave indicative of his subjection,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1093"></A><A HREF="#fn_1088"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and can, according to R. Meir, recover his liberty by his purchase money being repaid to his master by other people, and by a deed of manumission which he himself receives. But the sages say, "Also when the purchase money is repaid by himself, or the deed of his manumission was received by others; but the money must be given to him for that purpose by other people."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1094"></A><A HREF="#fn_1089"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 4. Large cattle are acquired by the delivery [of the animal from the seller to the buyer], and small cattle by raising them. Such is the dictum of R. Meir and R. Eleazar; but the sages decide, "That</p>

<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="green">p. 308</font></A></p>  
<p>the legal acquisition of small cattle is by their being driven away [by or for the buyer]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. [Immoveable] property on which a lender has a retrogressive or permanent right,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1095"></A><A HREF="#fn_1090"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> is acquired by purchase money, deed of sale, or taking possession. [Moveable] property which does not afford that security to a lender, is acquired by being removed by the purchaser. Property of the description last mentioned is acquired along with other property which does afford permanent security, through the payment of the purchase money, by a deed of sale, or taking possession. Yet, property which does not afford that security, can cause its owner to take an oath on account of the mentioned immoveable property.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1096"></A><A HREF="#fn_1091"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 6. In all things the value of which must be reduced into money,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1097"></A><A HREF="#fn_1092"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> as soon as one person has taken possession of the property he has received in barter, the other party acquires a property in that for which he exchanged it, as for instance: If a person bartered [with anc. her] an ox for a cow, or an ass for an ox, as soon as one party has taken possession of the article bartered, the other becomes possessed of the thing received in exchange, and is liable to any risk appertaining thereto. The right of property is secured to the Sanctuary as soon as the purchase money [for the article bought] is paid; but that of private persons, only when they have taken actual possession. A promise of property to the Sanctuary&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1098"></A><A HREF="#fn_1093"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> is equivalent to the delivery to a private person.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1099"></A><A HREF="#fn_1094"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 7. All duties which it is incumbent on a father to do for his son,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1100"></A><A HREF="#fn_1095"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> are incumbent on males only, but not on females; but the obligation of all duties from a son to his father&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1101"></A><A HREF="#fn_1096"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> is incumbent on both sexes. The observance of all affirmative precepts of the law, the</p>

<p>performance of which is limited to a certain time, are incumbent on males, and not on females; and all affirmative precepts, the performance of which is not limited to a certain time, are obligatory on both sexes. All negative precepts, whether their performance does or does not depend on time, are obligatory on both sexes, except the precepts not to destroy [the beard] (Lev. ix. 27), not to cut round the corners of the hair (ibid.), and against contamination from a dead body [which, either do not apply to, or are not obligatory on, females].</p>  
<p>8. The imposition of hands [on animals about to be sacrificed], the wavings [of offerings], the bringing [meat-offerings] to the altar, the taking of the handful of flour thereof, the burning of incense, the wringing or pinching off the heads of birds [brought as sacrifices], the sprinklings and receiving of the blood [of sacrifices] are obligatory on males only, and not on females,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1102"></A><A HREF="#fn_1097"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> except the meat-offering of a suspected adultress and of a woman who had taken the vow of a Nazarite, which these women must wave [personally].</p>  
<p>&sect; 9. Every precept which especially applies to the soil of the land of Israel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1103"></A><A HREF="#fn_1098"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> is obligatory only within the land of Israel, but those which do not especially apply to that land&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1104"></A><A HREF="#fn_1099"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A> are obligatory in and out of Palestine, except the precept of "Orlah"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1105"></A><A HREF="#fn_1100"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> and "Kilaim."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1106"></A><A HREF="#fn_1101"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> R. Eleazar saith, "Also the prohibition to eat of the new corn."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1107"></A><A HREF="#fn_1102"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 10. Whoever duly observes the commandment of the law will receive happiness from heaven; his days will be prolonged, and he shall hereafter inherit felicity in the land of eternal bliss. But he who does not perform any commandment will not receive happiness from heaven, his days will not be prolonged, nor shall he hereafter inherit felicity in the land of eternal bliss. Whoever is versed in the law, in the Mishna [oral law], and the usages of civilized society will not easily fall into sin, as it is written, "A threefold cord is not easily broken" [Eccl. iv. 12]; and those who are ignorant of the written and oral law, and also of good morals, are unfit for human society.</p>

Although such a marriage is a legal one, and cannot be dissolved, except by a Get or the death of the parties, yet the man who thus marries, is, as a transgressor against morality and decency, punishable by the Tribunal with the infliction of &#8207;&#1502;&#1499;&#1514; &#1502;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;&#8206;, or, "stripes for rebellion."</P>
