<p>&sect; 1. Rabbon Gamaliel saith, "In marriage by <i>Yeboom</i> no other letter of divorce is valid after such a one has. already been given,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>

<p>nor a promise of marriage after such a promise, nor connexion [with another sister-in-law] after such connexion [with a first], and no <i>Chalitzah</i> after a first <i>Chalitzah</i> had been given." But the sages say, "Another divorce may be given after a first, or a promise of marriage after such a promise, but there cannot be any thing [further of the same nature] after a connexion, nor after a <i>Chalitzah</i>."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. As in the following cases:&#8212;When a brother-in-law promised marriage by <i>Yeboom</i> to his widowed sister-in-law, and then gives her a <i>Get</i>, she will be bound to perform also <i>Chalitzah</i> to him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_699"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> If he promised her marriage, and then received <i>Chalitzah</i> from her, she will require a <i>Get</i> [in addition] to be fully released. If, after having promised her marriage, he had connexion with her, he acted according to law.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 3. If he gave her a letter of divorce, and promised her marriage afterwards, she will require another <i>Get</i> and <i>Chalitzah</i> [to be fully released]. Also, if after giving her <i>Get</i> he had connexion with her; but if, after giving her <i>Get</i>, he received <i>Chalitzah</i> from her, this latter will be a useless act.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> If he received <i>Chalitzah</i> from her, and then gave her either a promise of marriage, or a <i>Get</i>, or had connexion with her, or that the connexion preceded the promise, or the <i>Get</i>, or the receipt of <i>Chalitzah</i> from her, then neither of these acts are valid after <i>Chalitzah</i> has been once performed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> It is immaterial in these cases, whether it happened with one sister-in-law, and one brother-in-law, or two sisters-in-law with one brother-in-law.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. As in the following case:&#8212;If a person promised marriage to his two widowed sisters-in-law, they will both require [to enable them to marry another man] a <i>Get</i> from him, and he is to receive <i>Chalitzah</i></p>  
<p>

<p>from one of them. If he promised marriage to one, and divorced the other, then the first will require a <i>Get</i> and <i>Chalitzah</i>. If he promised marriage to one, and then had connexion with the other, both will require a <i>Get</i>, and one the <i>Chalitzah</i>. If he promised marriage to one, and received <i>Chalitzah</i> from the other, the first will require a <i>Get</i>. If he divorced both, they will both require <i>Chalitzah</i>. If he divorced one, and had connexion with the other, this latter requires both <i>Get</i> and <i>Chalitzah</i>. If he divorced one, and promised marriage to the other, the last mentioned will require both <i>Get</i> and <i>Chalitzah</i>. If he divorced one, and received <i>Chalitzah</i> from the other, nothing that was done after the <i>Chalitzah</i> is valid.</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. If he received <i>Chalitzah</i> first from one, and subsequently from another sister-in-law, or after having received <i>Chalitzah</i> of one, promised marriage to the other, or gave her <i>Get</i>, or had connexion with her, or had connexion, first with one, and then with the other, and gave the last mentioned then&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> a promise of marriage, or a <i>Get</i>, or received <i>Chalitzah</i> from her, then, all that happened after the <i>Chalitzah</i> [or after the connexion] is not valid. It is indifferent whether this happen with one brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law, or with one sister-in-law and two brothers-in-law.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. If, after receiving <i>Chalitzah</i> from his sister-in-law, he promised her marriage, or divorced her, or had connexion with her, and gave her afterwards a promise of marriage, or gave her <i>Get</i>, or received <i>Chalitzah</i> from her, then no other acts after the <i>Chalitzah</i> are valid, be it in the beginning, middle or end [of other acts], but in the case of connexion; whatever took place afterwards is not valid, when it happened at the beginning, but it is valid if it happened in the middle, or end [of other acts]. R. Nehemiah saith, "Nothing is valid either after <i>Chalitzah</i>, or after connexion, whether at the beginning, middle, or end of other acts."</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CHAPTER VI.</h3>

<P><A NAME="fn_698"></A><A HREF="etm109.htm#fr_703">212:1</A> It is necessary to observe, that the Mishna treats here of a case when many wives were left by a deceased brother to the surviving brother, who must perform the <i>Yeboom</i>, or when there is but one such a widow, but many surviving brothers. Neither this section, nor, indeed, the whole of this chapter, can be well understood, without attending to the following rules, mentioned in the commentary of Maimonides.</p>  
<p>First, that a widow who, agreeably to the law of <i>Yeboom</i>, must either be married by her brother-in-law, or must perform <i>Chalitzah</i> to him, but is not released so as to enable her to marry again by any <i>Get</i> she may have received of her said brother-in-law.</p>  
<p>Secondly, that the obligation incumbent on the parties does only then cease, when the said widow has fully and completely become the wife of her former brother-in-law [i.e. after the marriage has been consummated], and not before, <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></A> so that although he betrothed her either with money, a ring, &amp;c., or with a marriage contract, which on other occasions is considered a binding and valid marriage (see Treatise Kedushin, chap. I. &sect; I); yet, here it is but partially binding, and it is the same with a letter of divorce [<i>Get</i>] given her before consummation of the marriage, which also has the effect of releasing her, but partially only; for it will be necessary that the ceremony of <i>Chalitzah</i> be performed before she be finally released; and when such a woman is betrothed, she must first receive a <i>Get</i>, and then perform <i>Chalitzah</i>, before she will be finally released.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_699"></A><A HREF="etm109.htm#fr_704">213:2</A> But owing to the divorce he may not marry her by <i>Yeboom</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_700"></A><A HREF="etm109.htm#fr_705">213:3</A> According to the regulations of the sages, that the promise of marriage must precede connexion.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_701"></A><A HREF="etm109.htm#fr_706">213:4</A> For she is prohibited to him from the moment he gave her the <i>Get</i>.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_702"></A><A HREF="etm109.htm#fr_707">213:5</A> Or after connexion in other cases.</P>
