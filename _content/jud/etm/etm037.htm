<p>&sect; 1. These [are the kind of] knots which render [a man] guilty: the camel-drivers&#8217; knot, and the [sailors&#8217;] boatmen's knot;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_149"></A><A HREF="#fn_149"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and as he becomes guilty by tying [splicing] them, so does he likewise become guilty by untying them. R. Meir saith, "A knot which he can untie with one hand only, he does not become guilty for [untying]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. There are other knots, the tying or untying of which does not render guilty, as the camel-drivers&#8217; and [sailors&#8217;] boatmen's knots [do]: a woman may tie the slit in her chemise, and her cap-ribbons, and her stay-laces [girdle], and her shoe-strings, and her sandal-laces; [also] skins of oil, and of wine, and pots of meat. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "They may tie a rope before a beast, to prevent its going out." A pail may be tied [to a well] by a girdle, but not by a rope. R. Jehudah laid down the rule, "Any knot which is not intended to be lasting [tied once for good and all] does not cause [any one] to become guilty.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. Clothes may be folded even four or five times; on the evening of the Sabbath, the beds may be made for [use on] the Sabbath; but they must not be made on the Sabbath, for [to be used] after the Sabbath is out. R. Ishmael saith, "The clothes may be folded, and the beds made on the day of atonement, for [use on] the Sabbath."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_150"></A><A HREF="#fn_150"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And the fat of the Sabbath-sacrifices may be offered on the day of atonement: [another version adds, "but not that of the day of atonement on the Sabbath."] R. Akivah saith, "That of the Sabbath must not be offered on the day of atonement, nor that of the day of atonement on the Sabbath."</p>
