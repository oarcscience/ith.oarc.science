<p>&sect; 1. Wherewith may [a man let] an animal go out?&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_91"></A><A HREF="#fn_91"><FONT SIZE="1">1a</FONT></A> and wherewith may [he] not [let] it go out? The camel [he] may [let] go out with its halter, the she camel with a nose-ring; the Lybian ass with bridle and bit; the horse with its collar; all [animals] that wear a collar may go out therewith, and be led thereby; [in case it, the collar, becomes unclean] it must be rinsed, and dipped in its place [without taking it off.]</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. The ass goes out with its rug [while it is tied on him]. He-goats may go out with a leather bandage round their privates; sheep with their tails fastened up or down, and with wrapper;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_92"></A><A HREF="#fn_92"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> sire-goats</p>

<p>with their udders tied up. R. Jose prohibits all these, excepting the sheep with wrapper. R. Jehudah saith, "She-goats may go out with their udders tied up, if [this be done] to dry [up the milk], but not if it be done to [preserve the] milk."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. Wherewith may [a man] not [let] animals go out? The camel must not go out with a rag tied to its tail,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_93"></A><A HREF="#fn_93"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> nor with its legs strapped,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_94"></A><A HREF="#fn_94"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> nor with its fore and hind-legs fastened together;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_95"></A><A HREF="#fn_95"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> this [applies] to all domestic animals. A man must not fasten camels together and lead them, but he may hold the [different] ropes in his hand, only [taking care] that they do not get twisted.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_96"></A><A HREF="#fn_96"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 4. An ass must not go out with its rug that had not been fastened on [before the Sabbath], nor with a bell, although it be muffled, nor with a wooden frame-work round its neck,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_97"></A><A HREF="#fn_97"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> nor with a strap to its legs. Hens must not go out with cords&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_98"></A><A HREF="#fn_98"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> tied on them, nor with straps to their feet. Rams must not go out with go-carts to their tails;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_99"></A><A HREF="#fn_99"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> nor sheep with sneezing-wood;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_100"></A><A HREF="#fn_100"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> nor calves with a reed-yoke;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_101"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> nor a cow with the skin of a hedgehog tied to her udders,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> nor with a strap between her horns. The cow of R. Eleazar hen Azariah went out [on the Sabbath] with a strap between her horns, which was against the consent of the sages.</p>
