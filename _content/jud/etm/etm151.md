### CHAPTER I.

§ 1. All persons are qualified to slaughter \[animals allowed to be
eaten\], and what has been properly slaughtered by them may be lawfully
eaten. Deaf and dumb, or demented persons, or minors, are, however,
excepted from this rule, because they are liable to make mistakes in
slaughtering. That which was slaughtered by a heathen must be considered
as Nebelah, <span id="fr_1154"></span>[1](#fn_1149) and like that
pollutes the person who carries it. <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[2](#fn_1150) When the slaughtering was done by
night \[i.e., in the dark\], or by a blind person, it is Cashér. <span
id="fr_1156"></span>[3](#fn_1151) If a person slaughtered on the Sabbath
or on the Day of Atonement, although he has by that act forfeited his
life, yet what he has slaughtered is Cashér.

§ 2. When a person had cut the throat \[of an animal\] with a hand
sickle, <span id="fr_1157"></span>[4](#fn_1152) a sharp flint stone, or
with a reed, it is Cashér. All <span id="fr_1158"></span>[5](#fn_1153)
may slaughter, at any time, and with any instrument, excepting a reaping
hook, a saw, the \[sharp\] teeth \[of animals fixed in the maxillary
bone\], or with the finger nail, <span id="fr_1159"></span>[6](#fn_1154)
because the \[first mentioned three\] do not cut, but strangle \[and
tear\]. When a person slaughtered an animal with a reaping hook, having
teeth or notches, with the first or down stroke or cut only, <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[7](#fn_1155) it is unfit for use according to Beth
Shammai, but Beth Hillel hold it to be Cashér; but if the teeth of the
reaping hook had been ground away \[so as to give it a sharp and even
edge\] it is the same as a knife.

§ 3. Should a person have to cut through the great or top ring of the
trachea or windpipe, that but the width of a thread of the whole
circumference of the ring remained \[on the upper part\], the animal

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

so killed is Cashér. R. José bar Jehudah saith, "It is Cashér when the
greatest part of this breadth remained." <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[8](#fn_1156)

§ 4. An animal which was slaughtered by being cut at either side of the
throat is Cashér, but if the neck of a bird brought as a sacrifice was
wrung off <span id="fr_1162"></span>[9](#fn_1157) sideways, it is
thereby rendered an unfit sacrifice. If an animal was cut from the neck
downwards, <span id="fr_1163"></span>[10](#fn_1158) it becomes unlawful
for use, but a bird whose neck was thus wrung is a valid sacrifice. An
animal which was cut below the throat is Cashér, but the wringing off of
birds’ heads from below the throat render them unfit sacrifices, because
the whole region of the neck is appropriate for the wringing off of the
head \[of birds\], and the whole region of the throat for slaughtering
\[animals\], therefore whatever \[in respect to cutting\] renders an
animal Cashér, must render a bird thus treated an unfit sacrifice, and
the same in the reverse case.

§ 5. That which makes turtle-doves proper sacrifices, <span
id="fr_1164"></span>[11](#fn_1159) renders young pigeons improper ones,
and whilst these are valid as young pigeons, they cannot be used as
sacrifices of turtle-doves. When the neck feathers of either kind begin
to shine and to turn yellow, they are unfit sacrifices. <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[12](#fn_1160)

§ 6. That which constitutes a \[red\] heifer a proper sacrifice,
invalidates the calf \[whose neck was to be broken <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[13](#fn_1161)\], and also the reverse. <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[14](#fn_1162) That which does not disqualify
priests <span id="fr_1168"></span>[15](#fn_1163) \[to minister in the
Temple\] disqualifies Levites, and the reverse. That which is
\[legally\] clean in earthenware vessels, <span
id="fr_1169"></span>[16](#fn_1164) renders other vessels unclean,

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

and the reverse takes place in other kinds of vessels. <span
id="fr_1170"></span>[17](#fn_1165) That which is considered \[legally\]
clean in a wooden vessel <span id="fr_1171"></span>[18](#fn_1166) is
unclean in one of metal, and the reverse. The degree of ripeness which
subjects bitter almonds to tithe, does not yet subject sweet almonds to
the same; <span id="fr_1172"></span>[19](#fn_1167) and when the latter
become subject, the bitter ones are already free from the obligation of
tithe. <span id="fr_1173"></span>[20](#fn_1168)

§ 7. An infusion of water on grape lees which has not yet fermented, may
not be bought for the money of second tithe, <span
id="fr_1174"></span>[21](#fn_1169) and renders a bath, however, unfit
\[for legal cleansing\]; <span id="fr_1175"></span>[22](#fn_1170) but
when it has fermented it may be purchased for the money of second tithe,
and its admixture does not render a bath unfit <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[23](#fn_1171) Brothers who, after sharing the
inheritance from their parents, have entered into partnership, are not
bound to pay the tithe of cattle while they are liable to the
Kalbon, <span id="fr_1177"></span>[24](#fn_1172) but whilst they are
liable to the payment of cattle-tithe they are not subject to the
Kalbon. While the right of sale is vested in the father \[who may during
the minority of his daughter sell her as a handmaid\] no fine can be
imposed, <span id="fr_1178"></span>[25](#fn_1173) and when damages can
be legally claimed the right of sale ceases. Whilst the right of refusal
is in force <span id="fr_1179"></span>[26](#fn_1174) Chalitzah does not
take place, <span id="fr_1180"></span>[27](#fn_1175) and when that
ceremony

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

is performed the right of refusal is no longer applicable. When the
cornet is sounded <span id="fr_1181"></span>[28](#fn_1176) no Habdallah
is said, and when that is said the cornet is not sounded. When a
festival happens on the eve of the Sabbath the cornet is sounded, but
the Habdallah is not said. If on the day after the Sabbath, it is said,
but the cornet is not sounded. What is the form of the \[prayer\]
Habdallah? \[Blessed art thou, &c.\] "who makest a distinction between
holy and holy;" but according to R. Dosa, "who makest a distinction
between the greater and minor degrees of holiness."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1149"></span>[325:1](etm151.htm#fr_1154) That is, an animal
which died of itself, and of which it is prohibited to eat.

<span id="fn_1150"></span>[325:2](etm151.htm#fr_1155) See Treatise
Kelim, chap. I. § 2.

<span id="fn_1151"></span>[325:3](etm151.htm#fr_1156) By this is
indicated that which is *fit* to eat, or rather, what may be lawfully
eaten. As we shall have frequent occasion to mention this word, we
shall, to avoid periphrase, retain this Hebrew term, as also the terms
Nebelah and Terefá, explained above.

<span id="fn_1152"></span>[325:4](etm151.htm#fr_1157) An instrument, one
side of which is sharp and the other notched.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[325:5](etm151.htm#fr_1158) That is, even an
Israelite who was guilty of many transgressions of the law, excepting if
he were guilty of idolatry or the public profanation of the Sabbath.

<span id="fn_1154"></span>[325:6](etm151.htm#fr_1159) Whilst attached to
the person.

<span id="fn_1155"></span>[325:7](etm151.htm#fr_1160) That is, without
the second or returning cut, consequently he does not lacerate.

<span id="fn_1156"></span>[326:8](etm151.htm#fr_1161) Towards the head,
even if the ring had not been cut throughout the whole of its
circumference.

<span id="fn_1157"></span>[326:9](etm151.htm#fr_1162) Lev. i. 15.

<span id="fn_1158"></span>[326:10](etm151.htm#fr_1163) That is, if the
incision was made on the top of the neck, through the vertebra, before
the knife reached the gullet and windpipe.

<span id="fn_1159"></span>[326:11](etm151.htm#fr_1164) Viz., their age.

<span id="fn_1160"></span>[326:12](etm151.htm#fr_1165) The young
pigeons, because they are then too old, and the turtle-doves, because
they are yet too young.

<span id="fn_1161"></span>[326:13](etm151.htm#fr_1166) As an expiation
for uncertain murder. (See Deut. xxi.)

<span id="fn_1162"></span>[326:14](etm151.htm#fr_1167) That is, the red
heifer must have its throat cut in the prescribed form, but the calf
must have its neck broken or struck off.

<span id="fn_1163"></span>[326:15](etm151.htm#fr_1168) Viz., age. For
priests are not disqualified to minister in the temple but on account of
having contracted a corporeal blemish. This does not disqualify Levites,
but their age disqualifies them, for when they have attained the age of
fifty they are no longer to be employed in the active service of the
Temple. (See Numbers viii. 25.)

<span id="fn_1164"></span>[326:16](etm151.htm#fr_1169) Viz., when any
creeping or unclean thing had touched the external surface of an
earthenware vessel it does not contract pollution, but other vessels do
contract it under the mentioned circumstance.

<span id="fn_1165"></span>[327:17](etm151.htm#fr_1170) Should any thing
unclean have entered the cavity of a vessel without touching it in any
part, an earthen vessel is unclean, but any other kind of vessel remains
clean.

<span id="fn_1166"></span>[327:18](etm151.htm#fr_1171) Wooden utensils
do not contract pollution when level, but they do when they are hollowed
out, though yet in an unfinished state. Metal vessels, however, contract
pollution in a finished state only, whether they are hollow or level.

<span id="fn_1167"></span>[327:19](etm151.htm#fr_1172) Because they are
not yet edible.

<span id="fn_1168"></span>[327:20](etm151.htm#fr_1173) Because they are
only subject to the payment of tithe while they are edible, which is
when they are small and not full grown.

<span id="fn_1169"></span>[327:21](etm151.htm#fr_1174) Because it is
only water. (See Treatise Maaser Sheni, chap. II. § 5.)

<span id="fn_1170"></span>[327:22](etm151.htm#fr_1175) When a quantity
of three lugs and upward of it had been mixed with the waters of a bath
not containing forty seahs.

<span id="fn_1171"></span>[327:23](etm151.htm#fr_1176) Because it is
considered as wine, and does not otherwise render a bath unfit except
when it discolors the water.

<span id="fn_1172"></span>[327:24](etm151.htm#fr_1177) That is, the
agio, or premium paid to a money changer for the accommodation of
receiving half-shekels, wherewith to pay the annual contribution for the
offerings of the temple. (See Treatise Shekalim, chap. I. §§ 6 and 7.)

<span id="fn_1173"></span>[327:25](etm151.htm#fr_1178) Upon a person who
violated or seduced her. (See Treatise Ketuboth, chap. III. § 8, note
11.)

<span id="fn_1174"></span>[327:26](etm151.htm#fr_1179) This relates to a
female, who, in her minority, had been betrothed by her mother and
brothers, and, on becoming nubile, refuses to ratify the engagement they
entered into for her. (See Treatise Yebamoth, chaps. I. and II.)

<span id="fn_1175"></span>[327:27](etm151.htm#fr_1180) That is, a widow
need not wait to remarry under the mentioned circumstances <span
id="page_328">p. 328</span> till her brother-in-law has received
Chalitzah from her, for she can make use of her right of refusal.

<span id="fn_1176"></span>[328:28](etm151.htm#fr_1181) On the eves of
the Sabbath and festivals, when the cornet was thrice sounded, as
mentioned in Treatise Succah, chap. V. § 5.
