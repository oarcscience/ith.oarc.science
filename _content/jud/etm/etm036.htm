As to all other kinds of reptiles, or worms, whoever wounds [bruises] them is absolved; whoever catches them, if for use, is guilty; if not for use, is absolved.

<p>&sect; 2. Man must not make [prepare] brine on the Sabbath; but he may make [mix] salt and water wherein to dip his bread, and to put into his food, to season it. R. Jos&eacute; observed, "And is not this [mixture] brine, whether it be more or less salted? The [only mixture of] salt and water which is permitted [on the Sabbath], is that in which oil has been previously put, either to the salt or to the water."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. It is unlawful to eat Greek hyssop on the Sabbath, because it is not food [fit] for healthy [people]; but man may eat wild-rosemary, and drink &#8207;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1489; &#1512;&#1493;&#1506;&#1492;&#8206;;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_146"></A><A HREF="#fn_146"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> man may eat of any [kind of] food as medicine, and drink any kind of beverage, except water of &#8207;&#1491;&#1511;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;&#8206;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_147"></A><A HREF="#fn_147"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and &#8207;&#1499;&#1493;&#1505; &#1506;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;&#8206;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_148"></A><A HREF="#fn_148"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> as these are [only remedies] for the jaundice; but a man may drink the <i>water of Dekalim</i> for thirst, and may anoint himself with the oil of <i>Ikkarim</i>, but not as a remedy.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. He who has the toothache must not rinse his teeth with vinegar, but he may wash them as usual [dip something in vinegar and rub them], and if he does get cured, he does get cured. He who has pains in his loins, must not rub them with wine or vinegar; he may [however] anoint them with [any kind of] oil, except rose</p>
