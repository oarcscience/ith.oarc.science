# XXI. TREATISE MEGUILLAH,

###### OR, OF THE ROLL OF THE BOOK OF ESTHER.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introduction</span>.

THIS Treatise, according to its title, treats of the periods appointed
for the reading of the book, of the manner in which it is to be written,
and read on the feast of lots ‏פורים‎. A considerable part of this
Treatise, however, is taken up with matters not immediately connected
with the subject of its title, such as laws relating to synagogues, the
public readings of the Holy law on various solemn days, &c. and with
other matters incidentally mentioned.
