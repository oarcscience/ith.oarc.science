<p>&sect; 1. Should a cask break, sufficient may be saved to serve three meals. The owner may also call to others, "Come and save for yourselves [whatever you can];" provided, always, [that] no portion of the leakage be [sponged] up [soaked up with a sponge]. Men must not squeeze fruits, so as to extract the juice; and if it ooze out by itself, it is forbidden [to use it]. R. Jehudah saith, "If the fruits are for eating, the juice which oozes out is permitted [for use], but if the fruits are for beverage, the juice which oozes out is forbidden [for use]. If honey-cakes have been broken on the Sabbath-eve, and the honey oozes out, it is forbidden [for use]; but R. Eleazar permits [its use].</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. Whatever has been dressed with hot water on the Sabbath-eve may be soaked in hot water on the Sabbath; and whatever has not been dressed with hot water on the Sabbath-eve must only be passed through hot water on the Sabbath; except stale salt fish, [small salted fishes], and Spanish &#8207;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1505;&#8206;;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_170"></A><A HREF="#fn_170"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as the passing these through hot water is their proper dressing [all the cooking they require].</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. A man may break open a cask, to eat dry figs out of it; provided always, he does it not with the intention to prepare the cask for subsequent use. He must not pierce the bung-hole of a cask; such is the dictum of R. Jehudah; but the sages permit it. [According to another version, R. Jos&eacute; permits it]. He must not spile a cask [bore a hole in the side thereof]: and, if it is spiled, he must not put wax on it, because he [thereby] smoothens it down. R. Jehudah said, "Such a case was once brought before R. Jochanan, ben Sachai, at Arob, when he remarked, 'I doubt whether I ought not to have inflicted a sin-offering on the accused.'"</p>

<p>&sect; 4. They may put cooked victuals into a cave [cellar] to save them; also put good water [in a vessel] into water that is not drinkable, to keep it [the former] cool: likewise cold water [in a vessel], into hot water, to warm [the former]. He whose clothes have dropped into the water while on the road, may unhesitatingly go on with them. As soon as he arrives at the outmost court [of the town or village] he may spread his clothes in the sun, but not before the people [publicly].</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. Whoever bathes in the water of a cavern, or in the hot wells of Tiberias, though he wipe himself with ten napkins, he must not bring them away in his hand; but ten persons wiping themselves with one napkin, their faces, their hands, and their feet, may bring it away in their hands.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. They may anoint and rub the stomach with the hands, but not so as to get fatigued. They must not brush the body with a flesh brush, or descend into a &#8207;&#1511;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;&#8206;;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_171"></A><A HREF="#fn_171"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> they must not take an emetic, or stretch the limbs of an infant, or put back a rupture; he who has strained his hand or foot must not pour cold water on it; but he may wash it in the usual way; and if he does get cured he does get cured.</p>
