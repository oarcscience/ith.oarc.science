<p>&sect; 1. He whose dead lieth before him, is exempt from saying the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;, from the &#8207;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;&#8206; [prayer], and from &#8207;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;&#8206; [phylacteries]. Those who carry the bier, those who relieve them, and those who relieve the relief,&#8212;such as go before the bier, and such as go after it [whose services] are required for the bier&#8212;are all exempt [from] saying [the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;]. But those [whose services] are not required for the bier are bound [to say &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;]. Both are alike exempt from the &#8207;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;&#8206; [prayer].</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. When they have buried the dead and return, if they have time to begin and end [any entire section of the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;] before they</p>  
<p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A></p>  
<p>reach the files,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> they are to begin: if not, they are not to begin. Of those who stand in the files, the inner ones are exempt, but the outer ones are bound to say the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;.</p>  
<p>3. Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from saying the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;, and also from &#8207;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;&#8206; [phylacteries]; but they are bound [to observe] the &#8207;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;&#8206; [prayer] the &#8207;&#1502;&#1494;&#1493;&#1494;&#1492;&#8206; [inscription on the door-post], and the grace after meat.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. A man who is unclean from seminal emission [without carnal copulation], is to meditate inwardly on the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;, but does not pronounce the benedictions before or after it. At his meals he says grace after meat, but not before. R. Jehudah saith, "He says grace both before and after meat."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. If he stands in the &#8207;&#1514;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;&#8206; [prayer], and recollects that he is unclean from seminal emission, he is not to break off [at once], but to shorten [the prayer]. If he has stepped into the water [to bathe&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>] should he have time [sufficient] to ascend, to cover [his nakedness], and to say the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206; before the sun shines forth [over the mountain tops], he is to ascend, to cover himself, and to say the &#8207;&#1513;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;. If not, he is to cover himself with water, and to say it. But he is not to cover himself with foul water, or such water as [any substance has been] dissolved in, unless he has poured clean water to it. At what distance is he to keep from [such] foul water, or from [any] excrement? 4 amoth [cubits].</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. A man who has a running issue [blenorrhagia], and experiences seminal emission; a woman who, having the flowers, emits semen &#8207;&#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1513;&#1502;&#1513;&#1514; &#1513;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492; &#1504;&#1491;&#1492;&#8206;, all require to bathe; but R. Jehudah declares them exempt.</p>
