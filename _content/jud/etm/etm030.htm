Jos&eacute; saith, "large enough to receive [hold] quarter [of a lug]." R. Meir saith, "Although there is not [any absolute] proof in support [of my] assertion, there is an indication [of my] assertion; for it is said, 'There shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire from the hearth.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> But R. Jos&eacute; replied, "[Can you] thence [adduce] a proof? [Does not the sentence conclude with the words], 'or to take water withal out of the pit?'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>
