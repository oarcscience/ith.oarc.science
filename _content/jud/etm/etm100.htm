<p>&sect; 1. Dry land may be irrigated on the Moed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_618"></A><A HREF="#fn_615"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and also during the Sabbatical year, as well from a fountain that is newly sprung forth, as from one that is not newly sprung forth; but they must not irrigate it with rain-water, nor with water [drawn] from a deep well; nor may they make [dig] trenches [to hold water] round vines.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. R. Eleazar ben Azariah saith, "They must not make [dig] a fresh trench [conduit, or water course] on the Moed, or during the Sabbatical year." But the sages hold, that a fresh trench [water course] may be dug during the Sabbatical year, and that those [conduits] which are choked up, may be repaired on the Moed. They may [likewise] repair water reservoirs [which are] in the public reshuth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_619"></A><A HREF="#fn_616"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and cleanse them: They may also repair the roads [streets], the market [public] places, and the spring-baths. In short, they may do whatever the exigencies of the public [service] require. They</p>

<p>may mark [whitewash] tombs,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_620"></A><A HREF="#fn_617"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and even send out [inspectors] of Kilaim.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_621"></A><A HREF="#fn_618"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 3. R. Eleazar ben Jacob saith, "They may lead water from tree to tree, provided always the whole orchard be not irrigated; plants which have not imbibed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_622"></A><A HREF="#fn_619"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> [water] before the Moed, must not be irrigated during the Moed."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_623"></A><A HREF="#fn_620"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> But the sages permit the one and the other.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. They may [by means of gins and pit-falls] catch moles and field-mice in orchards and fields, but they must not [do this] in the [usual] way,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_624"></A><A HREF="#fn_621"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> both on the Moed and during the Sabbatical year. But the sages hold that in an orchard [the vermin may he caught] in the [usual] way, but that in a corn-field [it must] not [be caught] in the [usual] way. During the Moed they may pile [loose stones to stop] a gap&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_625"></A><A HREF="#fn_622"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> [in a fence], but during the Sabbatical year they repair it in the [ordinary] way.</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. R. Meir saith, "Priests make the first inspection of the plague [of leprosy] in order to relieve [the patient], but not to restrict [him]." But the sages decide neither to relieve nor to restrict [in no case is such an inspection to be undertaken during the Moed].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_626"></A><A HREF="#fn_623"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> R. Meir [further] saith, "A man may collect the bones of his father and mother [during the Moed, to inter them], because it is a satisfaction to him [relieves his mind]." But R. Jos&eacute; saith, "It is a grief to him [afflicts his mind]. Man is not to excite [others to mourn] over his dead,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_627"></A><A HREF="#fn_624"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> nor hold a funeral oration for thirty days before the festival."</p>

<p>&sect; 6. They must not dig graves or burial vaults on the Moed, but they may prepare [enlarge] graves [previously dug] on the Moed, and also make a washing pit during the Moed, and a coffin in the same court where the corpse lies. [This, however,] R. Jehudah prohibits, unless the boards have been [previously] provided.</p>  
<p>&sect; 7. They must not espouse wives on the Moed, neither virgins nor widows; nor must they be &#8207;&#1502;&#1497;&#1489;&#1501;&#8206;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_628"></A><A HREF="#fn_625"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> as that [the espousal] is a cause of joy to him individually,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_629"></A><A HREF="#fn_626"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> but he may receive back his own divorced wife. A woman may prepare her ornaments on the Moed. R. Jehudah saith, "She must not apply lime [chalk as a cosmetic], because it [may] disfigure her."</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. An ordinary person [who is not of the craft] may sew [make stitches] in the [regular] way; but the craftsman [whose trade it is to sew, must only do it] zigzag [during the Moed]. They may twine [the ropes in the sacking of] bedsteads. R. Jos&eacute; saith, "[They may] only tighten [the ropes]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 9. They may erect an oven, or a hearth, or a mill, on the Moed [for the use of the festival]. R. Jehudah saith, "New millstones must not be chipped."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_630"></A><A HREF="#fn_627"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 10. A railing [balustrade] may be made round a roof, or gallery [according to the] workmanship of common men, but not [according to the] workmanship of [regular] craftsmen. Rents [in the roof] may also be closed, and [then] smoothened with a roller,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_631"></A><A HREF="#fn_628"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> or with hand and foot, but not with a trowel. Should the hinges of the door-frame, or the beam, or the lock [of the door], or the key [thereto], have been broken, they may be repaired on the Moed, provided always he does not intentionally put off the repairs till the Moed. All [kinds of] pickled food&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_632"></A><A HREF="#fn_629"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> of which he can eat during the Moed, may be pickled.</p>
