# IV. TREATISE KILAIM

###### CONTAINS LAWS DERIVED FROM, AND ENFORCING THE DIVINE COMMANDS.—(Levit. xix. 19; Deut. xxii. 9, 11).

"*Thou shalt not let thy cattle gender with a diverse kind; thou shalt
not sow thy field with a mingled seed, neither shall a garment of
mingled woollen come upon thee*" (Levit. xix. 19).

"*Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds, lest the fruit of
thy seed, which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy vineyard, become
defiled. Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together. Thou
shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts of woollen and linen together*"
(Deut. xxii. 9, 11).

§ 1. Wheat and ‏זוּאנִין‎ <span id="fr_32"></span>[1](#fn_32) are not in
the relation of kilaim, <span id="fr_33"></span>[2](#fn_33) towards each
other. Barley and oats are not kilaim, neither are spelt and rye, nor
beans and chickpeas, nor small peas and ‏מוֹפַה‎, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[3](#fn_34) nor white beans and scarlet beans.

§ 2. Cucumbers and melons are not kilaim. R. Jehudah saith they are.
Lettuce and cabbage-lettuce are not kilaim; neither are endive and wild
succory; nor common \[garden\] leek and wild leek; nor common coriander
and wild coriander; nor common mustard and Egyptian mustard; nor
Egyptian pumpkins and bitter pumpkins; nor Egyptian beans and pod-beans.

§ 3. Turnips and rape \[turnip radishes\] are not kilaim; neither are
cabbage and \[wild\] colewort, nor ‏תְּרָדִים‎ <span
id="fr_35"></span>[4](#fn_35) and ‏לְעוֹנִים‎. <span
id="fr_36"></span>[5](#fn_36) R. Akivah adds, neither are common garlic
and wild garlic; nor onions and shalots; nor ‏תּוֹרְמוֹם‎ <span
id="fr_37"></span>[6](#fn_37) and ‏פַּלְסוּם‎. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[7](#fn_38)

§ 4. Among the \[fruits of\] trees, pears and crustumina <span
id="fr_39"></span>[8](#fn_39) are not kilaim; nor are quinces and
medlars. The apple and crab apple, apricots and almonds, plums and
pistachios, although similar \[in flavour\] are, nevertheless, kilaim.

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

§ 5. Radishes and rape, mustard and lapsano, <span
id="fr_40"></span>[9](#fn_40) Greek and Egyptian pumpkins \[together\]
and bitter pumpkins, although similar, are, nevertheless, kilaim.

§ 6. The wolf and the dog, the fox and the fox-hound, goats and deer,
sheep and chamois, the horse and the mule, the mule and the ass, the ass
and the zebra, although similar, are kilaim.

§ 7. \[The fruits of\] trees must not be grafted on trees of a different
kind; nor \[one kind of\] shrub, \[plant or herb\] on another kind of
shrub; nor yet \[scions of\] trees on shrubs, nor shrubs on trees. R.
Jehudah permits the grafting of shrubs on trees.

§ 8. Shrubs must not be planted on a sycamore-bush; rue must not be
grafted on white cassia, because that \[would be a shrub\] on a tree; a
scion of figs must not be planted among ‏חֲצוּב‎ <span
id="fr_41"></span>[10](#fn_41) to cool it; a vine-branch must not be
sunk \[trained\] into a melon-bed, to instil its juices therein, because
that is a tree on a plant; pumpkin-seed must not be set among mallow, in
order that it may be preserved therein, as that is herb in herb.

§ 9. If turnips and radishes be hidden \[in the ground\] beneath a vine,
so that part of the leaves are visible, man need not feel any hesitation
\[to use them\], either on the score of kilaim or of the 7th
\[sabbatical\] year, <span id="fr_42"></span>[11](#fn_42) nor yet of
tithes; and they \[the turnips and radishes\] may be taken \[out of the
ground\] on the Sabbath-day. If wheat and barley be sown at once
\[together\], that forms kilaim. R. Jehudah saith, "Kilaim are not
formed unless two kinds of wheat be sown to one of barley, or two kinds
of barley to one of wheat; or wheat, barley, and spelt, be sown
together."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_32"></span>[14:1](etm012.htm#fr_32) Commentators differ as
to what kind of plant is designated by this name. Surenhusius renders it
lolium \[darnel\]. Some believe it to be some species of *vicia*
\[vetch\], while others consider it a kind of ervum \[tare\]: all agree
that it is non-edible.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[14:2](etm012.htm#fr_33) The word "kilaim"
denotes the commixture of things differing in kind, species, or nature;
here it means mixed seeds of various kinds.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[14:3](etm012.htm#fr_34) A kind of pea or legume
\[a pod-vegetable\].

<span id="fn_35"></span>[14:4](etm012.htm#fr_35) Bieta \[beet\].

<span id="fn_40"></span>[15:9](etm012.htm#fr_40) Nipplewort. Most of the

\[ivy.\]

<span id="fn_42"></span>[15:11](etm012.htm#fr_42) Should they have been
