*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER X.

§ 1. Whoever preserves a thing, either as seed or for a sample, or, as a
medicine, and carries out any quantity thereof on the Sabbath, is
guilty. All \[other\] persons are only guilty if they carry out the
\[prescribed\] quantity; if he who preserves the article carries it back
again, he also is only guilty \[of a second offence\] if there be the
prescribed quantity.

§ 2. He who, carrying out victuals, puts them on the threshold <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_135) \[of his house\], whether he himself
afterwards carries them out or any other person carries them out, both
are \[alike\] absolved; because neither completed the work at once
\[off-hand\]. If he put a basket full of fruit on the outer threshold,
although the larger portion of the fruit be in the street \[of the
threshold\], he is absolved, so long as the whole of the basket is not
carried out \[at once\].

§ 3. Whoever carries out, either with his right hand or with his left,
in his lap, or on his shoulder, is guilty; \[the last\] being the manner
in which the sons of Kohath carried their load: but if he carries

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

on the back of his hand, or \[pushes by\] his foot, or \[carries in\]
his mouth, or \[shoves with\] his elbow, or \[carries in\] his ear, or
\[tied to\] his hair, or in the purse of his girdle, with the opening
downwards, or between his girdle and his shirt, or in the skirt of his
shirt, or in his shoe, or in his sandal, he is absolved, because he
carries not in the usual way.

§ 4. If a person intends to carry out \[something\] before him, and it
gets behind him, he is absolved; \[if he intended to carry it\] behind
him, and it gets before him, he is guilty. They \[the sages\] did indeed
decide, that a woman who carries out something in her small girdle is
guilty, whether \[it be carried\] before her or behind her; for it is
liable to shift. R. Jehudah saith, "letter-carriers likewise." <span
id="fr_136"></span>[2](#fn_136)

§ 5. If a man carries a \[large\] loaf into the public reshuth, he is
guilty; if two carry it they are absolved: <span
id="fr_137"></span>[3](#fn_137) if one was not able to carry it, and
\[therefore\] the two carried it out, they are guilty. If a person
carries out victuals, less than the prescribed quantity, in a vessel, he
is absolved, even for \[carrying\] the vessel, as that is an accessary
to the victuals. \[If he carries out\] a living person on a couch, he is
absolved, even for \[carrying\] the couch, as that is an accessary to
the person \[on it\]. \[If he carry out\] a corpse on a couch or bier,
he is guilty. Likewise \[if he carry\] the size of an olive
\[appertaining to a human\] corpse, or the size of an olive of carrion,
or the size of a lentil of a reptile, he is guilty. R. Simeon absolves
him.

§ 6. He who pares his nails, \[either pulling them off\] with his nails,
or \[biting them off\] with his teeth; or who pulls the hair out of his
head, or off his lip, or out of his beard; likewise a woman who plaits
her hair, or dyes her eye-brows, or who parts the hair on her forehead;
R. Eleazar pronounces \[them all\] guilty. The sages prohibit all these,
on the score of \[their violating\] the Sabbath rest. He who plucks
\[leaf, flower, or blossom\] out of a perforated flower-pot, is guilty:
\[but if the flower-pot be\] not perforated, he is absolved. R. Simeon
absolves him in either case.
