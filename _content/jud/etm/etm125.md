*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER VI.

§ 1. Whatever a woman finds, and \[likewise\] the produce of her labor
belongs to her husband: of what she inherits he enjoys the usufruct
during her life. \[Damages awarded to her in compensation for\] insult
or injury <span id="fr_854"></span>[1](#fn_849) belong to her. R.
Jehudah ben Bethera saith "\[If the injury inflicted on her is\] hidden
\[not visible\] two-thirds \[of the damages recovered\] belong to her,
and one-third to him \[the husband\]. But if it is apparent \[visible\]
two-thirds belong to him and one-third to her. His \[share\] is paid
\[over\] to him at once: for her share land is bought, of which he has
the usufruct."

§ 2. Should a man stipulate \[to give a certain sum of\] money \[as
dowry\] to his son-in-law, and his son-in-law dies, he may say \[to the
brother of the deceased who is to marry his childless widow\], "To thy
brother I would have given \[the money\], but to thee I do not intend
giving it."

§ 3. If she \[the bride\] stipulates to bring him one thousand dinar
\[in ready money as a dowry\], he must against that sum assign to her
\[in the Ketubah\] fifteen maneh. <span id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_850)
But against \[articles subject to\] appraisement, he assigns to her
one-fifth less than her valuation. <span id="fr_856"></span>[3](#fn_851)
\[Should the articles be\] appraised at a maneh, and are \[actually\]
worth a maneh, he assigns to her only one maneh. \[But if he is required
to assign her that sum for articles\] to be valued at a maneh, she must
bring him \[property to the value of thirty-one selah\], <span
id="fr_857"></span>[4](#fn_852) and if \[he is to assign\] four hundred
dinar, she must bring him \[to the value of\] five hundred.

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But if he assigns
\[the amount of her dowry in the Ketubah after the property has been
appraised\], he deducts one fifth \[from the amount of the valuation\].

§ 4. If she stipulates to bring \[her dowry in\] ready money, he must
\[in the Ketubah\] assign her six dinar for every selah \[of four
dinar\]. The bridegroom must also take upon himself \[to allow her\] ten
dinar pocket money <span id="fr_858"></span>[5](#fn_853) for every maneh
she brings him. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Every thing is regulated
according to the custom of the country."

§ 5. He who gives his daughter \[in marriage\] without any \[previous\]
stipulation \[as to dowry\], must not give her less than fifty zooz. If
it is stipulated that he \[the husband\] is to take her naked \[without
any outfit\], he must not say, "When I have brought her to my own house
I will cover her with my raiment," but he is bound to clothe her while
she is yet in her father's house. So likewise must he, who \[by virtue
of his office as overseer of the poor\] gives an orphan in marriage, not
give her less than fifty zoos \[for her dowry\], and if there is
sufficient \[means\] in the box <span id="fr_859"></span>[6](#fn_854)
she is to be provided \[with an outfit\] becoming her condition.

§ 6. An orphan who was given in marriage by her mother and brothers with
her consent, and they had assigned to her a dowry of a hundred or of
fifty zooz, she is entitled when she comes of age to recover from them
whatever is her due. R. Jehudah saith, "If the father has given one
daughter in marriage, the same amount \[of dowry\] must be given to the
second \[daughter\] as he had given to the first;" the sages, however,
object that sometimes a man was poor and becomes rich, or was rich and
becomes poor; <span id="fr_860"></span>[7](#fn_855) but the property
\[the father left\] is to be appraised, and \[her fair share\] given to
her.

§ 7. If a person deposits money for \[the dowry of\] his daughter in the
hands of a trustee, <span id="fr_861"></span>[8](#fn_856) should she
say, "I have full confidence in my bridegroom," <span
id="fr_862"></span>[9](#fn_857) the trustee must \[nevertheless\] act
according to the strict letter of the trust reposed in him. <span
id="fr_863"></span>[10](#fn_858) Such is the dictum of

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Meir, but R.
Joss saith, "Suppose it \[the trust money\] had been converted into a
field, which she is desirous to sell, she has a right to sell it at
once." <span id="fr_864"></span>[11](#fn_859) To whom do these remarks
apply? To a grownup female; but as to a minor, whatever a minor does is
as nothing \[void\].

a limb, or any other permanent blemish.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[256:2](etm125.htm#fr_855) He adds one third
for the use of the ready money which may at once be productive of profit
to him.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[256:3](etm125.htm#fr_856) Because it is
assumed that to gain favor with her bridegroom, the amount of her dowry
has been swelled, and the articles composing the same rated beyond their
real value.

<span id="fn_852"></span>[256:4](etm125.htm#fr_857) A selah is four
dinar, so that the actual value must exceed the amount assigned to her
by one fifth.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[257:5](etm125.htm#fr_858) ‏קופה‎ box: some
commentators render it "perfume-box," others "cash-box."

<span id="fn_854"></span>[257:6](etm125.htm#fr_859) Should the charity
funds be exhausted, the overseers are bound to borrow the money
necessary for this purpose, on the security of the rates.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[257:7](etm125.htm#fr_860) And as his mind
would be influenced by the change in his circumstances, what he gave to
one daughter is not a fair criterion of what he would give to the other.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[257:8](etm125.htm#fr_861) To purchase land
withal.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[257:9](etm125.htm#fr_862) Therefore let him
have the money.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[257:10](etm125.htm#fr_863) And not comply with
her wish.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[258:11](etm125.htm#fr_864) Consequently her
wishes are to be complied with.
