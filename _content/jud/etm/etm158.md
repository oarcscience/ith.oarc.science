### CHAPTER VIII.

§ 1. It is prohibited to boil any kind of flesh <span
id="fr_1247"></span>[1](#fn_1242) in milk, except that of locusts <span
id="fr_1248"></span>[2](#fn_1243) and fish; neither may meat and cheese
be brought to

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

table together, except locusts and fish. A person who vowed not to eat
meat, may eat locusts and fish. Fowl and cheese may, according to Beth
Shammai, be brought to table together, but may not be eaten together;
but, according to Beth Hillel, they may neither be brought to table nor
be eaten together. R. José saith, "This is one of the cases in which
Beth Shammai decide in a less rigid manner than Beth Hillel." <span
id="fr_1249"></span>[3](#fn_1244) What kind of table is here alluded to?
The table on which the person is eating; but on the table on which food
is prepared \[a dresser\], both kinds may without apprehension be placed
near to each other.

§ 2. Meat and cheese may be wrapped up together in one cloth, if they do
not touch each other \[i.e. are placed in contact\]. Rabbon Simeon ben
Gamaliel saith, "Two guests \[at an inn or ordinary\] may without
apprehension eat at the same table, one of them meat, and the other
cheese."

§ 3. When a drop of milk fell upon a piece of meat \[in a pan\], all the
meat therein is prohibited if it could have communicated its flavor to
the meat; <span id="fr_1250"></span>[4](#fn_1245) but if the contents of
the pot had been immediately stirred together \[after the milk fell into
it\]: if it imparted its flavor to the whole, the contents of the pot
are prohibited. The udder \[of a cow or goat, &c.\] must be torn, and
the milk be pressed out of it; but if it had not been torn, the person
who eats it has not transgressed; the heart must also be torn and the
blood pressed out. If it had not been torn, the person who eats it thus
has not transgressed; <span id="fr_1251"></span>[5](#fn_1246) and he who
has fowl and cheese brought to table together has not transgressed the
negative commandment.

§ 4. It is prohibited to boil \[in milk\] or to derive any benefit from
the flesh of a clean animal which was boiled in milk of a clean animal,
but it is permitted to boil and to reap advantage of flesh of a clean
animal boiled in the milk of an unclean one, or, of the flesh of an
unclean animal boiled in the milk of a clean one. R. Akivah saith,

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Wild animals and
fowl are not specified in the law \[as subject to this prohibition\];
for it is said, 'Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk,' but
this precept was mentioned three times, <span
id="fr_1252"></span>[6](#fn_1247) to include wild animals, fowl, and
unclean animals. R. José the Galilean saith, "It is said \[Deut. xiv.
21\], 'Thou shalt not eat of any thing that dieth of itself'
\[Nebelah\], and it is added immediately, 'Thou shalt not boil a kid in
its mother's milk.' Consequently, those animals only which are
prohibited as *Nebelah* may not be boiled in milk, and as it might be
supposed that since a fowl may become prohibited as *Nebelah*, it would
therefore be prohibited to boil it in milk, the Scripture uses the
expression, 'in its *mother's milk*,' to except fowl, to which that
expression cannot apply." <span id="fr_1253"></span>[7](#fn_1248)

§ 5. It is prohibited to use the curdled milk in the maw of an animal
slaughtered by a non-Israelite, which is *Nebelah*. When a person put
milk in the interior membrane of the maw <span
id="fr_1254"></span>[8](#fn_1249) of a Cashér killed animal; <span
id="fr_1255"></span>[9](#fn_1250) if the milk can impart a flavor to it,
it is prohibited. The milk in the maw of a Cashér animal, which sucked
from one that is Terefá, is prohibited; but the milk of a Terefá, which
sucked from a Cashér animal, may be used, because the milk remains
gathered \[enclosed\] in the intestines. <span
id="fr_1256"></span>[10](#fn_1251)

§ 6. Several laws are more rigid in respect to the prohibition of eating
suet \[‏חלב‎\] than they are in that against eating blood, and some,
again, which relate to this latter prohibition, are more severe than
those in respect to the first mentioned. More severe in respect to suet,
inasmuch as a trespass \[‏מעילה‎\] may be thereby incurred, as also the
guilt of having brought an abominable \[i.e. unfit\] sacrifice
\[‏פגול‎\], and having eaten of what remained <span
id="fr_1257"></span>[11](#fn_1252) \[‏נותר‎\], and became unclean, which
is not the case in respect to the blood. Some laws are more severe as
regards blood, since this prohibition applies to the blood of domestic
and wild animals, and also to fowl, whether they are of a clean or
unclean species, but that against eating suet applies to clean animals
exclusively.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1242"></span>[344:1](etm158.htm#fr_1247) This term includes
the flesh of cattle and venison, and also of fowl; the prohibition of
the two first is derived from the Law, that of the last-mentioned is of
Rabbinical origin.

<span id="fn_1243"></span>[344:2](etm158.htm#fr_1248) Some species of
locusts are even at this day used as a common article of food <span
id="page_345">p. 345</span> in some countries of the east. The species
here particularly alluded to is of the cucullated or hooded species, and
is called "Locusta minor flavicans *Chagab* edulis," i.e. the lesser
yellowish locust, or edible *Chagab*.—(Scheuchzer, Physica Sacra.)

<span id="fn_1244"></span>[345:3](etm158.htm#fr_1249) The contrary is
generally the case, Beth Hillel being mostly less rigid in their
decisions than Beth Shammai.

<span id="fn_1245"></span>[345:4](etm158.htm#fr_1250) This is the case
when the piece of meat does not exceed sixty times the size or
proportion of the drop of milk.

<span id="fn_1246"></span>[345:5](etm158.htm#fr_1251) In the Talmud,
Treatise ‏כריתות‎, this is explained as limited to a fowl's heart only.

<span id="fn_1247"></span>[346:6](etm158.htm#fr_1252) Exodus xxiii. 19;
ibid. xxxiv. 26; and Deut. xiv. 21.

<span id="fn_1248"></span>[346:7](etm158.htm#fr_1253) Hebrew, "which
have no mothers milk." The Halacha or Rabbinical decision is, however,
according to R. Akivah.

<span id="fn_1249"></span>[346:8](etm158.htm#fr_1254) Which is flesh.

<span id="fn_1250"></span>[346:9](etm158.htm#fr_1255) To convert it into
runnet to make cheese.

<span id="fn_1251"></span>[346:10](etm158.htm#fr_1256) And does not mix
with the juices, &c., of the animal that is Terefá.

<span id="fn_1252"></span>[346:11](etm158.htm#fr_1257) That is, if eaten
or kept on the third day since the animal was sacrificed. (See Leviticus
xix. 5, 6, &c.)
