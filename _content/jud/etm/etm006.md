*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER V.

§ 1. Men are not to stand up and pray, except with profound humility.
The pious men of ancient days used to pause a full hour before they
began to pray, in order to direct their minds \[hearts\] to the Deity.
Though the king salute him he is not to respond \[to the salutation\]
and though a serpent wind itself round his heel, he is not to interrupt
\[his prayers\].

§ 2. The \[divine\] power of \[causing\] the rain \[to descend\] must be
mentioned in \[the benediction for\] the resurrection of the dead.
Supplication for rain is to be made in the benediction for the year, and
‏הבדלה‎, \[the distinction between the Sabbath and week day\] in the
benediction ‏חונן הדעת‎ \[who graciously bestows knowledge\]. R. Akivah
saith the ‏הבדלה‎ is to be said in a fourth benediction by itself. R.
Eleazar saith, in the thanksgiving \[‏מודים‎\].

§ 3. He who says in his prayers "Thy mercy extends \[even\] to a bird's
nest, or for the good \[which thou doest us\] be thy name remembered,"
or he who says twice ‏מודים‎ \[we thank\] is to be silenced. If a man
step up to the ark \[as minister to pray for the congregation\] and make
a mistake, another shall step up in his stead; nor may he in such a
case, decline the office. From whence does he \[the substitute\] begin?
From the commencement of the benediction in which his predecessor made
the mistake.

§ 4. He who steps up to the ark is not to respond "Amen" after the
Cohanim \[priests\], lest his attention become diverted \[from the
prayers\]. If no other Cohen be present but himself, he is not to lift
up his hands \[to bless the congregation\]. But if he feel quite assured
that he can lift up his hands, and then resume \[his prayers\], he is at
liberty so to do.

§ 5. If a man prays and makes a mistake, it is a bad omen for him. If he
be deputed by a congregation \[minister\], it is a bad omen for his
constituents, for a man's deputy is like the man himself. It is related
of R. Hanina ben Dosa, that when he prayed for the sick, he would say,
"This one will live," or "Such a one will die." They \[the sages\] said
to him, "By what dost thou know \[it\]?" He said to them, "If my prayer
is fluent in my mouth, I know that he is accepted; but if not, I know
that he is lost!"
