*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER XXI.

§ 1. A man may lift up his child with a stone in its hand; also, a
hamper, wherein there is a stone; and unclean heave-offering may be
moved with clean and with non-consecrated things. R. Jehudah saith,
"They may also take out the heave-offering from ‏מדמע‎, <span
id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167) in the proportion of one to the
hundred. <span id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168)

§ 2. \[If\] a stone \[lie\] on the bung-hole of a cask, a man may
incline the cask to one side, so that the stone fall of. If it \[the
cask in question\] is among other casks, he may raise it, and incline it
on one side, so that the stone may fall off. If there be money \[coins\]
on a bolster, the bolster may be turned, so that they may fall off. If
there be any ordure on a pillow, man may wipe it off with a rag; if the
cover \[of the pillow\] be of skin, water may be poured on it until the
ordure is rinsed off.

§ 3. Beth Shammai hold, "That men may carry from the table bones and
husks." Beth Hillel hold, "That the whole table-cloth is to be lifted up
and shaken." <span id="fr_169"></span>[3](#fn_169) They may carry away
from the table

fragments \[of food\] less than the size of an olive, and also the husks
of beans and of lentiles; for these are food for cattle. A sponge, if it
has a leather handle, they may wipe with it; if not, they must not wipe
with it. The sages hold, "That, of either kind, it \[the sponge\] may be
moved on the Sabbath, and is not liable to contract uncleanness."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_167"></span>[65:1](etm043.htm#fr_167) Heave offering, which
has got mixed among non-consecrated grain, which thereby becomes
forbidden food for all but priests.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[65:2](etm043.htm#fr_168) Vide Treatise
Terumoth.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[65:3](etm043.htm#fr_169) According to the
Talmud, the opinions here assigned to the two schools are, <span
id="page_66">p. 66</span> from some error, inverted, so that the opinion
of Beth Hillel is given as that of Beth Shammai, and *vice versâ*. The
remnants here spoken of are only such as may serve to feed cattle.
