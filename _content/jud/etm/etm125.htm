<p>&sect; 1. Whatever a woman finds, and [likewise] the produce of her labor belongs to her husband: of what she inherits he enjoys the usufruct during her life. [Damages awarded to her in compensation for] insult or injury&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_854"></A><A HREF="#fn_849"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> belong to her. R. Jehudah ben Bethera saith "[If the injury inflicted on her is] hidden [not visible] two-thirds [of the damages recovered] belong to her, and one-third to him [the husband]. But if it is apparent [visible] two-thirds belong to him and one-third to her. His [share] is paid [over] to him at once: for her share land is bought, of which he has the usufruct."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. Should a man stipulate [to give a certain sum of] money [as dowry] to his son-in-law, and his son-in-law dies, he may say [to the brother of the deceased who is to marry his childless widow], "To thy brother I would have given [the money], but to thee I do not intend giving it."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. If she [the bride] stipulates to bring him one thousand dinar [in ready money as a dowry], he must against that sum assign to her [in the Ketubah] fifteen maneh.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_855"></A><A HREF="#fn_850"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> But against [articles subject to] appraisement, he assigns to her one-fifth less than her valuation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_856"></A><A HREF="#fn_851"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> [Should the articles be] appraised at a maneh, and are [actually] worth a maneh, he assigns to her only one maneh. [But if he is required to assign her that sum for articles] to be valued at a maneh, she must bring him [property to the value of thirty-one selah],&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_857"></A><A HREF="#fn_852"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> and if [he is to assign] four hundred dinar, she must bring him [to the value of] five hundred.</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> But if he assigns [the amount of her dowry in the Ketubah after the property has been appraised], he deducts one fifth [from the amount of the valuation].</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. If she stipulates to bring [her dowry in] ready money, he must [in the Ketubah] assign her six dinar for every selah [of four dinar]. The bridegroom must also take upon himself [to allow her] ten dinar pocket money&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_858"></A><A HREF="#fn_853"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> for every maneh she brings him. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "Every thing is regulated according to the custom of the country."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. He who gives his daughter [in marriage] without any [previous] stipulation [as to dowry], must not give her less than fifty zooz. If it is stipulated that he [the husband] is to take her naked [without any outfit], he must not say, "When I have brought her to my own house I will cover her with my raiment," but he is bound to clothe her while she is yet in her father's house. So likewise must he, who [by virtue of his office as overseer of the poor] gives an orphan in marriage, not give her less than fifty zoos [for her dowry], and if there is sufficient [means] in the box&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_859"></A><A HREF="#fn_854"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> she is to be provided [with an outfit] becoming her condition.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. An orphan who was given in marriage by her mother and brothers with her consent, and they had assigned to her a dowry of a hundred or of fifty zooz, she is entitled when she comes of age to recover from them whatever is her due. R. Jehudah saith, "If the father has given one daughter in marriage, the same amount [of dowry] must be given to the second [daughter] as he had given to the first;" the sages, however, object that sometimes a man was poor and becomes rich, or was rich and becomes poor;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_860"></A><A HREF="#fn_855"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> but the property [the father left] is to be appraised, and [her fair share] given to her.</p>  
<p>&sect; 7. If a person deposits money for [the dowry of] his daughter in the hands of a trustee,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_861"></A><A HREF="#fn_856"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> should she say, "I have full confidence in my bridegroom,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_862"></A><A HREF="#fn_857"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> the trustee must [nevertheless] act according to the strict letter of the trust reposed in him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_863"></A><A HREF="#fn_858"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> Such is the dictum of</p>

Joss saith, "Suppose it [the trust money] had been converted into a field, which she is desirous to sell, she has a right to sell it at once."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_864"></A><A HREF="#fn_859"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> To whom do these remarks apply? To a grownup female; but as to a minor, whatever a minor does is as nothing [void].</p>
