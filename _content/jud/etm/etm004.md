*Eighteen Treatises from the Mishna*, by D. A. Sola and M. J. Raphall,
\[1843\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### CHAPTER III.

§ 1. He whose dead lieth before him, is exempt from saying the ‏שמע‎,
from the ‏תפלה‎ \[prayer\], and from ‏תפלין‎ \[phylacteries\]. Those who
carry the bier, those who relieve them, and those who relieve the
relief,—such as go before the bier, and such as go after it \[whose
services\] are required for the bier—are all exempt \[from\] saying
\[the ‏שמע‎\]. But those \[whose services\] are not required for the
bier are bound \[to say ‏שמע‎\]. Both are alike exempt from the ‏תפלה‎
\[prayer\].

§ 2. When they have buried the dead and return, if they have time to
begin and end \[any entire section of the ‏שמע‎\] before they

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

reach the files, <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14) they are to begin:
if not, they are not to begin. Of those who stand in the files, the
inner ones are exempt, but the outer ones are bound to say the ‏שמע‎.

3\. Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from saying the ‏שמע‎, and also
from ‏תפלין‎ \[phylacteries\]; but they are bound \[to observe\] the
‏תפלה‎ \[prayer\] the ‏מזוזה‎ \[inscription on the door-post\], and the
grace after meat.

§ 4. A man who is unclean from seminal emission \[without carnal
copulation\], is to meditate inwardly on the ‏שמע‎, but does not
pronounce the benedictions before or after it. At his meals he says
grace after meat, but not before. R. Jehudah saith, "He says grace both
before and after meat."

§ 5. If he stands in the ‏תפלה‎ \[prayer\], and recollects that he is
unclean from seminal emission, he is not to break off \[at once\], but
to shorten \[the prayer\]. If he has stepped into the water \[to
bathe <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15)\] should he have time
\[sufficient\] to ascend, to cover \[his nakedness\], and to say the
‏שמע‎ before the sun shines forth \[over the mountain tops\], he is to
ascend, to cover himself, and to say the ‏שמע‎. If not, he is to cover
himself with water, and to say it. But he is not to cover himself with
foul water, or such water as \[any substance has been\] dissolved in,
unless he has poured clean water to it. At what distance is he to keep
from \[such\] foul water, or from \[any\] excrement? 4 amoth \[cubits\].

§ 6. A man who has a running issue \[blenorrhagia\], and experiences
seminal emission; a woman who, having the flowers, emits semen ‏והמשמשת
שראתה נדה‎, all require to bathe; but R. Jehudah declares them exempt.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_14"></span>[5:1](etm004.htm#fr_14) After interring the
dead, those who attended the funeral used, at some short distance from
the grave, to form files or rows, through which the mourners passed to
receive the customary condolence.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[5:2](etm004.htm#fr_15) Lev. xv. 16.
