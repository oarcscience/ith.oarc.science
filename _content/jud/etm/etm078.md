# XVIII. TREATISE YOM TOB,

###### OR, OF THE FESTIVAL.

### <span class="smallcaps">Introduction</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> book, which is commonly called
‏ביצה‎, or egg \[from the word with which it commences\], contains laws
and regulations for the proper observance of the festivals. It explains
the works forbidden on the Sabbath, but which may be done on the
festival; and prescribes the restrictions and mode in which they may be
done.

It is necessary, for the proper understanding of this Treatise, to
explain here three phrases which will often occur therein; viz. ‏נולד‎,
i.e. whatever was born or has come into existence, has been produced, or
become fit for use, on the very day of the festival, is thus called.
Such are the egg that was laid on the day of the festival, the fruit
which thereon had fallen from trees, &c. All these may not be used on
the festival, because thereon those things only may be used which have
been ‏מוכן‎, or *prepared* before the festival. The third term, ‏מוקצה‎,
designates those articles of food, &c. which have not been thus
previously "prepared," or set apart for the festival; and which,
therefore, may not be used thereon.
