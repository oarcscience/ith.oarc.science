<p>&sect; 1. He who by vow interdicts his wife from enjoying any benefit from him for thirty days, must provide her [maintenance through] a guardian:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_865"></A><A HREF="#fn_860"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> beyond then [if for a longer period] he must divorce her, and pay [the amount of] her Ketubah. R. Jehudah saith, "In the case of an [ordinary] Israelite, [if his vow extends to] one month, he must keep her, [but if to] two months, he must divorce her, and pay [the amount of] her Ketubah. [In the case of] a priestess [should his vow extend to] two months, he must keep her, [but if to] three months, he must divorce her and pay her Ketubah.</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. He who tacitly confirms the vow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_866"></A><A HREF="#fn_861"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of his wife, that she will not taste any [particular] kind of fruit, must [at once] divorce her, and pay lier Ketubah. R. Jehudah saith, "[In the case of] an [ordinary] Israelite, [should the vow extend to] one day, he must keep her, [but if to] two days, he must divorce her, and pay her Ketubah: [in the case of] a priestess, [should the vow extend to] two days, he must keep her, [but if to] three days, he must divorce her, and pay her Ketubah."</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. He who tacitly confirms the vow of his wife, that she will not adorn herself with any particular kind of ornament, must divorce her, and pay her Ketubah. R. Jose saith, "[In the case] of a poor woman, if she has set no [fixed] limit [to the duration of her vow]:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_867"></A><A HREF="#fn_862"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and [of] a rich woman after thirty days.</p>

<p>enter her father's house,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_868"></A><A HREF="#fn_863"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> should the father reside in the same town, [if the vow extends to] one month, he [the husband] must keep her; [but if to] two months, he must divorce her, and pay her Ketubah. Should the father reside in another town, [if the vow extends to] one festival, he [the husband] must keep her;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_869"></A><A HREF="#fn_864"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> [but if to] three festivals, he must divorce her, and pay her Ketubah.</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. He who tacitly consents to the vow of his wife, that she will not enter a house of mourning or a house of feasting,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_870"></A><A HREF="#fn_865"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> must divorce her, and pay her Ketubah, because he closes [all doors] against her.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_871"></A><A HREF="#fn_866"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> But if he assigns other [good] reasons [for confirming her vow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_872"></A><A HREF="#fn_867"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A>], he is permitted to keep her. If he says: "[I will annul thy vow] on condition thou tellest A.B. what [lewd words] thou didst speak to me," or "which I did speak to thee," or that she is to fill [a given number of buckets of water] and pour [them] on a dunghill,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_873"></A><A HREF="#fn_868"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A> he must divorce her, and pay her Ketubah.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. The following women are divorced, and do not receive [the amount of] their Ketubah:&#8212;She who violates the Law of Moses, or Jewish [rules].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_874"></A><A HREF="#fn_869"><FONT SIZE="1">10</FONT></A> What constitutes [a violation of] the Law of Moses? If she causes him to eat [food] which has not paid tithe: if she submits to his embraces while she is in a state of Niddah:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_875"></A><A HREF="#fn_870"><FONT SIZE="1">11</FONT></A> if she does not set apart Chalah: and if she vows, but does not keep [her vow]. What constitutes [a violation of] Jewish rules [customs]? If she goes out with her hair loose [bareheaded]: if she spins in the street, and converses [flirts] with any man. Abbah Saul saith, "[Likewise] if she curses his children in his presence." R. Tarphon saith, "[Also] if she is a &#8207;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#8206;, a noisy woman."

<p>by] a noisy woman? One who speaks in her own house [so loud] that the neighbours can hear her.</p>  
<p>&sect; 7. If a man is Mekadesh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_876"></A><A HREF="#fn_871"><FONT SIZE="1">12</FONT></A> a woman, on condition that she is not subject to any vows, and it is discovered that she is subject to vows, the Kidushin&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_877"></A><A HREF="#fn_872"><FONT SIZE="1">13</FONT></A> are void. Should he have espoused her without investigation [as to the condition he stipulated], and then discovers that she is subject to vows, he may divorce her without paying her Ketubah. If he has mekadeshed her on condition that she is free from corporeal blemishes, and she is found to be subject to such blemishes, the Kidushin are void. Should he have espoused her without investigation, and then discovers blemishes, he may divorce her without paying her Ketubah. All those blemishes which disqualify priests&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_878"></A><A HREF="#fn_873"><FONT SIZE="1">14</FONT></A> [from ministering at the altar], also disqualify women [from insisting on the validity of their Kidushin].</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. If the blemishes are discovered while she is yet in her father's house, it is incumbent on the father to prove, that after she was betrothed these blemishes had arisen, and his [the bridegroom's] field become harrowed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_879"></A><A HREF="#fn_874"><FONT SIZE="1">15</FONT></A> But if she is entered under the husband's authority, it is incumbent on the husband to prove, that before she was betrothed these blemishes existed in her, and that his bargain was entered upon in error. Such is the dictum of R. Meir, but the sages say: "To what do these remarks apply? To blemishes that are hidden [out of sight]; but with respect to those that are evident he cannot start any objections. And should there be a bath in the city in which the espousals are to take place, he cannot raise any objections, even with respect to such blemishes as are hidden, as he could cause her to be examined by his female relatives."</p>  
<p>&sect; 9. Should the husband contract any corporeal blemish, they [the Bethdin] do not compel him to divorce his wife. R. Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, "To what [case] does this assertion apply? To minor blemishes. But [in cases of] serious blemishes, they compel him to divorce [his wife]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 10. The following [are the circumstances on account of which] they compel him to divorce [his wife]: if he is smitten with leprosy, or afflicted with a polypus;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_880"></A><A HREF="#fn_875"><FONT SIZE="1">16</FONT></A> or if he gathers dogs&#8217;-dung [for the purpose of preparing leather], or is a copper-smelter, or a tanner.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_881"></A><A HREF="#fn_876"><FONT SIZE="1">17</FONT></A></p>

<p><a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="green">p. 261</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Whether these circumstances existed before marriage or arose after marriage, with respect to them all, R. Meir observes, "Even though he [the husband] specially covenanted with her,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_882"></A><A HREF="#fn_877"><FONT SIZE="1">18</FONT></A> she may plead, 'I thought I could bear it, but now I find I cannot.'" The sages, however, hold, that she is compelled to bear it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_883"></A><A HREF="#fn_878"><FONT SIZE="1">19</FONT></A> except [in the case of the husband becoming] smitten with leprosy, as he [then] is in danger of a decline.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_884"></A><A HREF="#fn_879"><FONT SIZE="1">20</FONT></A> It happened at Sidon, that a tanner died, and left a brother [who also was] a tanner. The sages held "That she [his childless widow] had a right to plead, 'Thy brother I could bear, but thee I cannot bear.'"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_885"></A><A HREF="#fn_880"><FONT SIZE="1">21</FONT></A></p>
