<p>&sect; 1. A man may lift up his child with a stone in its hand; also, a hamper, wherein there is a stone; and unclean heave-offering may be moved with clean and with non-consecrated things. R. Jehudah saith, "They may also take out the heave-offering from &#8207;&#1502;&#1491;&#1502;&#1506;&#8206;,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_167"></A><A HREF="#fn_167"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the proportion of one to the hundred.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_168"></A><A HREF="#fn_168"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 2. [If] a stone [lie] on the bung-hole of a cask, a man may incline the cask to one side, so that the stone fall of. If it [the cask in question] is among other casks, he may raise it, and incline it on one side, so that the stone may fall off. If there be money [coins] on a bolster, the bolster may be turned, so that they may fall off. If there be any ordure on a pillow, man may wipe it off with a rag; if the cover [of the pillow] be of skin, water may be poured on it until the ordure is rinsed off.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. Beth Shammai hold, "That men may carry from the table bones and husks." Beth Hillel hold, "That the whole table-cloth is to be lifted up and shaken."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_169"></A><A HREF="#fn_169"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> They may carry away from the table</p>

<p>fragments [of food] less than the size of an olive, and also the husks of beans and of lentiles; for these are food for cattle. A sponge, if it has a leather handle, they may wipe with it; if not, they must not wipe with it. The sages hold, "That, of either kind, it [the sponge] may be moved on the Sabbath, and is not liable to contract uncleanness."</p>
