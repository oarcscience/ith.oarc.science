<p>&sect; 1. All [such] vessels [as may be] moved on the Sabbath, their doors [lids] may be moved with them, even though they have become</p>  
<p><a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="green">p. 61</font></A></p>  
<p>parted on the Sabbath; for they are not like house-doors, which are not [originally] prepared [to be moved].</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. A man may take [use] a hammer to crack nuts, or a hatchet to chop fig-cake, or a handsaw to saw cheese, or a shovel to take up dry figs, or a fan or fork to give food thereon to a child, a spindle or a shuttle to pick up fruit, or a sewing-needle to pick a splinter out [of his skin], or a packing-needle to open [undo] the door.</p>  
<p>&sect; 3. An olive-cane,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_156"></A><A HREF="#fn_156"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> that has a knob at the top of it, is liable to contract uncleanness; but if [it has] none, it is not liable to contract uncleanness; in either case it may be moved on the Sabbath.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. R. Judah saith, "All vessels [utensils] may he moved except a large saw and a ploughshare; all vessels [utensils] may be moved, whether they are [wanted] for use [on the Sabbath], or not [wanted] for use." R. Nehemiah saith, "They are only to be moved if [actually wanted] for use."</p>  
<p>&sect; 5. All [such] vessels as may be moved on the Sabbath, their fragments [should they be broke] may likewise be moved, provided they be fit to put to some use: [such as] the fragments of a kneading-trough, to cover the bunghole of a cask, or the fragments of a glass to cover a pitcher. R. Jehudah saith, "Provided they [the fragments] be fit to put to some use [analogous to] their [original] purpose: [such as] the fragments of a kneading-trough to hold pap [porridge], or the fragments of a glass to hold oil."</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. If a stone be in a hollow pumpkin [gourd], should the stone not fall out when water is drawn, they may draw water therewith; if otherwise, they must not draw water therewith. Should a vine-branch be fastened to a pitcher [by way of a handle], water may be drawn therewith on the Sabbath.</p>  
<p>&sect; 7. [Of a] window-blind, R. Eleazar saith, "If it be fastened, and hang down, it may be put before the window; if not, it must not be so used." But the sages hold, "That in either case, it may be put [before the window]."</p>  
<p>&sect; 8. The lids of all such vessels as are fixed to the ground, may be moved on the Sabbath. R. Jos&eacute; saith, "To what does this decision apply? To the lids of all such vessels [fixtures] as are sunk into the ground [as cisterns, &amp;c]. What then [is the case] with respect to the lids of vessels fixed to the ground? Either kind may be moved on the Sabbath."</p>
