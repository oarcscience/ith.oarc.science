<p>&sect; 1. The precept concerning the prohibition of eating the "sinew which shrank" [&#8207;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1492;&#8206;] is obligatory in and out of the Holy Land, during and after the existence of the Temple, in animals slaughtered for profane use [&#8207;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503;&#8206;], and in respect also to consecrated sacrifices, and applies to wild and domestic animals, and to both the right and left thighs of the animal; it does not apply to fowl, since these have no "hollow in the thigh." It applies to a f&#339;tus in embryo,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1238"></A><A HREF="#fn_1233"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and its suet [&#8207;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#8206;] it is permitted to use.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1239"></A><A HREF="#fn_1234"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> According to R. Meir, "The assertion of butchers in respect to their having removed the &#8207;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1492;&#8206; is not to be relied on;" but the sages hold, "That they may be relied on in this respect, and in that of the removal of &#8207;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;&#8206;, or suet."</p>  
<p>&sect; 2. It is lawful to send to a non-Israelite a thigh having the &#8207;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1492;&#8206; yet within it,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1240"></A><A HREF="#fn_1235"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> because its existence is easily ascertained. In removing the &#8207;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1492;&#8206; the whole sinew must be carefully cut out. R. Jehudah saith, "It suffices if enough was removed so as to fulfil the precept."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1241"></A><A HREF="#fn_1236"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>&sect; 3. A person who eats the quantity of an olive in size of a &#8207;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1492;&#8206;, incurs the penalty of forty stripes. Should a person have eaten the whole of that sinew, and it was under the mentioned size, he has nevertheless incurred the same penalty. If a person eat the size of an olive of the sinews of each hip, eighty stripes are to be inflicted on him; but according to R. Jehudah, forty stripes only.</p>  
<p>&sect; 4. If a hip was boiled with the &#8207;&#1490;&#1497;&#1491; &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1492;&#8206; within it, if that sinew was of sufficient size to impart a flavor to the hip, this latter may not be used. How is this to be calculated? In the same proportion as meat boiled with turnips.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1242"></A><A HREF="#fn_1237"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>

<p>&sect; 5. When the Guid Anash&eacute; was boiled with other sinews, if that sinew can be recognised [it must be removed, and] the other sinews are prohibited, if it could have imparted a flavor to them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1243"></A><A HREF="#fn_1238"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> But when it cannot be recognised, all the sinews are prohibited. The broth [or liquid in which it is boiled] may not be used if the Guid Anash&eacute; imparted a flavor to it;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1244"></A><A HREF="#fn_1239"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> and it is even so if a piece of Nebelah, or of a fish prohibited to be eaten, should have been boiled with other pieces of meat or fish allowed to be eaten: if the first mentioned pieces can be recognised, they are to be removed, and if they could have imparted a flavor to the other pieces, the latter may not be used. If they could not be recognised, all the pieces are prohibited; and thus in respect to the broth, which may not be used, if the flavor of the prohibited pieces could have been imparted to it.</p>  
<p>&sect; 6. The prohibition of the Guid Anash&eacute; applies to clean animals, and not to unclean ones. R. Jehudah saith, "It must be observed also in respect to unclean animals;" for he argued thus, "The Guid Anash&eacute; was prohibited since the time of the sons of Jacob [i.e. <i>before</i> the promulgation of the law], when it was not yet prohibited to use unclean animals as food."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1245"></A><A HREF="#fn_1240"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A> The sages replied, "This precept was first promulgated at Sinai, but it was written [incidentally] in its place."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_1246"></A><A HREF="#fn_1241"><FONT SIZE="1">9</FONT></A></p>
