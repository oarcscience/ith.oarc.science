<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">POEMS OF JUDAH HALEVI</H1>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">ODE TO ZION</H3>
<P>Art thou not, Zion, fain<BR>
To send forth greetings from thy sacred rock<BR>
Unto thy captive train,<BR>
Who greet thee as the remnants of thy flock?<BR>
Take thou on every side--<BR>
East, west, and south, and north -their greetings multiplied.<BR>
Sadly he greets thee still,<BR>
The prisoner of hope, who, day and night,<BR>
Sheds ceaseless tears, like dew on Hermon's hill--<BR>
Would that they fell upon thy mountain's height!</P>
<P>Harsh is my voice when I bewail thy woes,<BR>
But when in fancy's dream<BR>
I see thy freedom, forth its cadence flows<BR>
Sweet as the harps that hung by Babel's stream.<BR>
My heart is sore distressed<BR>
For Bethel ever blessed,<BR>
For Peniel, and each ancient, sacred place.<BR>
The holy presence there<BR>
To thee is present where<BR>
Thy Maker opes thy gates, the gates of heaven to face.</P>
<P>The glory of the Lord will ever be<BR>
Thy sole and perfect light;<BR>
No need hast thou, then, to illumine thee,<BR>
Of sun by day, or moon and stars by night.<BR>
I would that, where God's spirit was of yore<BR>
Poured out unto thy holy ones, I might<BR>
There, too, my soul outpour!<BR>
The house of kings and throne of God wert thou, <A NAME="page_338"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 338</FONT></A><BR>
How comes of it then that now<BR>
Slaves fill the throne where sat thy kings before?</P>
<P>Oh! who will lead me on<BR>
To seek the posts where, in far-distant years,<BR>
The angels in their glory dawned upon<BR>
Thy messengers and seers?<BR>
Oh! who will give me wings<BR>
That I may fly away,<BR>
And there, at rest from all my wanderings,<BR>
The ruins of my heart among thy ruins lay?<BR>
I'll bend my face unto thy soil, and hold<BR>
Thy stones as precious gold.<BR>
And when in Hebron I have stood beside<BR>
My fathers' tombs, then will I pass in turn<BR>
Thy plains and forest wide,<BR>
Until I stand on Gilead and discern<BR>
Mount Hor and Mount Abarim, 'neath whose crest<BR>
Thy luminaries twain, thy guides and beacons rest.</P>
<P>Thy air is life unto my soul, thy grains<BR>
Of dust are myrrh, thy streams with honey flow;<BR>
Naked and barefoot, to thy ruined fanes<BR>
How gladly would I go;<BR>
To where the ark was treasured, and in dim<BR>
Recesses dwelt the holy cherubim.</P>
<P>I rend the beauty of my locks, and cry<BR>
In bitter wrath against the cruel fate<BR>
That bids thy holy Nazarites to lie<BR>
In earth contaminate.<BR>
How can I make or meat or drink my care,<BR>
How can mine eyes enjoy<BR>
The light of day, when I see ravens tear<BR>
Thy eagles' flesh, and dogs thy lions' whelps destroy?<BR>
Away! thou cup of sorrow's poisoned gall!<BR>
Scarce can my soul thy bitterness sustain.<BR>
When I Ahola unto mind recall, <A NAME="page_339"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 339</FONT></A><BR>
I taste thy venom; and when once again<BR>
Upon Aholiba I muse, thy dregs I drain.</P>
<P>Perfect in beauty, Zion! how in thee<BR>
Do love and grace unite!<BR>
The souls of thy companions tenderly<BR>
Turn unto thee; thy joy was their delight,<BR>
And, weeping, they lament thy ruin now.<BR>
In distant exile, for thy sacred height<BR>
They long, and toward thy gates in prayer they bow.<BR>
Thy flocks are scattered o'er the barren waste,<BR>
Yet do they not forget thy sheltering fold,<BR>
Unto thy garments' fringe they cling, and haste<BR>
The branches of thy palms to seize and hold.<BR>
Shinar and Pathros! come they near to thee?<BR>
Naught are they by thy Light and Right divine.<BR>
To what can be compared the majesty<BR>
Of thy anointed line?<BR>
To what the singers, seers, and Levites thine?<BR>
The rule of idols fails and is cast down,<BR>
Thy power eternal is, from age to age thy crown.</P>
<P>The Lord desires thee for his dwelling-place<BR>
Eternally; and blest<BR>
Is he whom God has chosen for the grace<BR>
Within thy courts to rest.<BR>
Happy is he that watches, drawing near,<BR>
Until he sees thy glorious lights arise,<BR>
And over whom thy dawn breaks full and clear<BR>
Set in the Orient skies.<BR>
But happiest he, who, with exultant eyes,<BR>
The bliss of thy redeemed ones shall behold,<BR>
And see thy youth renewed as in the days of old.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">GOD, WHOM SHALL I COMPARE TO THEE?</H3>
<P>God! whom shall I compare to thee,<BR>
When thou to none canst likened be? <A NAME="page_340"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 340</FONT></A><BR>
Under what image shall I dare<BR>
To picture thee, when ev'rywhere<BR>
All Nature's forms thine impress bear?</P>
<P>Greater, O Lord! thy glories are<BR>
Than all the heavenly chariot far.<BR>
Whose mind can grasp thy world's design?<BR>
Whose word can fitly thee define?<BR>
Whose tongue set forth thy powers divine?</P>
<P>Can heart approach, can eye behold<BR>
Thee in thy righteousness untold?<BR>
Whom didst thou to thy counsel call,<BR>
When there was none to speak withal<BR>
Since thou wast first and Lord of all?</P>
<P>Thy world eternal witness bears<BR>
That none its Maker's glory shares.<BR>
Thy wisdom is made manifest<BR>
In all things formed by thy behest,<BR>
All with thy seal's clear mark imprest.</P>
<P>Before the pillars of the sky<BR>
Were raised, before the mountains high<BR>
Were wrought, ere hills and dales were known,<BR>
Thou in thy majesty alone<BR>
Didst sit, O God! upon thy throne!</P>
<P>Hearts, seeking thee, from search refrain,<BR>
And weary tongues their praise restrain.<BR>
Thyself unbound by time and place,<BR>
Thou dost pervade, support, embrace<BR>
The world and all created space.</P>
<P>The sages' minds bewildered grow,<BR>
The lightning-speed of thought is slow.<BR>
"Awful in praises" art thou named;<BR>
Thou fillest, strong in strength proclaimed,<BR>
This universe thy hand has framed.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_341"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 341</FONT></A></P>
<P>Deep, deep beyond all fathoming,<BR>
Far, far beyond all measuring,<BR>
We can but seek thy deeds alone;<BR>
When bow thy saints before thy throne<BR>
Then is thy faithfulness made known.</P>
<P>Thy righteousness we can discern,<BR>
Thy holy law proclaim and learn.<BR>
Is not thy presence near alway<BR>
To them who penitently pray,<BR>
But far from those who sinning stray?</P>
<P>Pure souls behold thee, and no need<BR>
Have they of light: they hear and. heed<BR>
Thee with the mind's keen ear, although<BR>
The ear of flesh be dull and slow.<BR>
Their voices answer to and fro.</P>
<P>Thy holiness forever they proclaim:<BR>
The Lord of Hosts! thrice holy is Ibis name!</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">SERVANT OF GOD</H3>
<P>Oh! would that I might be<BR>
A servant unto thee,<BR>
Thou God by all adored:<BR>
Then, though by friends out-cast,<BR>
Thy hand would hold me fast,<BR>
And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</P>
<P>Spirit and flesh are thine,<BR>
O Heavenly Shepherd mine!<BR>
My hopes, my thoughts, my fears, thou seest all)<BR>
Thou measurest my path, my steps dost know.<BR>
When thou upholdest, who can make me fall?<BR>
When thou restrainest, who can bid me go?<BR>
Oh! would that I might be<BR>
A servant unto thee, <A NAME="page_342"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 342</FONT></A><BR>
Thou God, by all adored.<BR>
Then, though by friends out-cast,<BR>
Thy band would hold me fast,<BR>
And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</P>
<P>Fain would my heart come nigh<BR>
To thee, O God! on high,<BR>
But evil thoughts have led me far astray<BR>
From the pure path of righteous government.<BR>
Guide thou me back into thy holy way,<BR>
And count me not as one impenitent.<BR>
Oh! would that I might be<BR>
A servant unto thee,<BR>
Thou God, by all adored.<BR>
Then, though by friends out-cast,<BR>
Thy hand would hold me fast,<BR>
And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</P>
<P>If in my youth I still<BR>
Fail to perform thy will,<BR>
What can I hope when age shall chill my breast?<BR>
Heal me, O Lord! with thee is healing found<BR>
Cast me not off, by weight of years opprest,<BR>
Forsake me not when age my strength has bound.<BR>
Oh! would that I might be<BR>
A servant unto thee,<BR>
Thou God, by all adored.<BR>
Then, though by friends out-cast,<BR>
Thy hand would bold me fast,<BR>
And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</P>
<P>Contrite and full of dread,<BR>
I mourn each moment fled<BR>
Midst idle follies roaming desolate;<BR>
I sink beneath transgressions manifold,<BR>
That from thy presence keep me separate;<BR>
Nor can sin-darkened eyes thy light behold.<BR>
Oh! would that I might be <A NAME="page_343"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 343</FONT></A><BR>
A servant unto thee,<BR>
Thou God, by all adored.<BR>
Then, though by friends out-cast,<BR>
Thy hand would hold me fast,<BR>
And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</P>
<P>So lead me that I may<BR>
Thy sovereign will obey.<BR>
Make pure my heart to seek thy truth divine;<BR>
When burns my wound, be thou with healing near!<BR>
Answer me, Lord! for sore distress is mine,<BR>
And say unto thy servant, I am here!<BR>
Oh! would that I might be<BR>
A servant unto thee,<BR>
Thou God, by all adored!<BR>
Then, though by friends out-cast,<BR>
Thy hand would bold me fast,<BR>
And draw me near to thee, my King and Lord!</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">TO THE SOUL</H3>
<P>O thou, who springest gloriously<BR>
From thy Creator's fountain blest,<BR>
Arise, depart, for this is not thy -rest!<BR>
The way is long, thou must prepar&egrave;d be,<BR>
Thy Maker bids thee seek thy goal--<BR>
Return then to thy rest, my soul,<BR>
For bountifully has God dealt with thee.</P>
<P>Behold! I am a stranger here,<BR>
My days like fleeting shadows seem.<BR>
When wilt thou, if not now, thy life redeem?<BR>
And when thou seek'st thy Maker have no fear,<BR>
For if thou have but purified<BR>
Thy heart from stain of sin and pride,<BR>
Thy righteous deeds to him shall draw thee near.</P>
<P>O thou in strength who treadest, learn<BR>
To know thyself, cast dreams away! <A NAME="page_344"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 344</FONT></A><BR>
The goal is distant far, and short the day.<BR>
What canst thou plead th' Almighty's grace to earn?<BR>
Would thou the glory of the Lord<BR>
Behold, O soul? With prompt accord<BR>
Then to thy Father's house return, return!</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">O SLEEPER! WAKE, ARISE!</H3>
<P>O sleeper! wake, arise!<BR>
Delusive follies shun,<BR>
Keep from the ways of men and raise thine eyes<BR>
To the exalted One.<BR>
Hasten as haste the starry orbs of gold<BR>
To serve the Rock of old.<BR>
O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</P>
<P>Behold the firmament<BR>
His hands have wrought on high,<BR>
See how his mighty arms uphold the tent<BR>
Of his ethereal sky,<BR>
And mark the host of stars that heaven reveals--<BR>
His graven rings and seals.<BR>
Tremble before his majesty and hope<BR>
For his salvation still,<BR>
Lest, when for thee the gates of fortune ope,<BR>
False pride thy spirit fill.<BR>
O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</P>
<P>Go seek at night abroad<BR>
Their footsteps, who erewhile<BR>
Were saints on earth, whose lips with hymns o'erflowed,<BR>
Whose hearts were free from guilt.<BR>
Their nights were spent in ceaseless prayer and praise,<BR>
In pious fast their days.<BR>
Their souls were paths to God, and by his throne<BR>
Their place is set anigh.<BR>
Their road through life was but a stepping-stone<BR>
Unto the Lord on high.<BR>
O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_345"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 345</FONT></A></P>
<P>Weep for thy sins, and pause<BR>
In wrongful deeds, to implore<BR>
God's pardoning grace, nor fret thyself because<BR>
Of evil-doers more.<BR>
Cleave to the right, and of thy substance bring<BR>
To honor him, thy King.<BR>
When saviors then Mount Zion joyfully,<BR>
Ascend with eager feet,<BR>
And nations shout for gladness, thou wilt be<BR>
Prepared thy God to meet.<BR>
O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</P>
<P>Whence does man's wisdom flow--<BR>
Man, who of dust is wrought,<BR>
Whose poor pre-eminence on earth does show<BR>
Over the beast as naught?<BR>
Only those gazing with the inward eye<BR>
Behold God's majesty:<BR>
They have the well-spring of their being found,<BR>
More precious far than wine.<BR>
Thou also thus, though by earth's fetters bound,<BR>
Mayst find thy Rock divine.<BR>
O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</P>
<P>The Lord is Lord of all,<BR>
His hands hold life and death,<BR>
He bids the lowly rise, the lofty fall,<BR>
The world obeys his breath.<BR>
Keep judgment, then, and live and cast aside<BR>
False and rebellious pride,<BR>
That asketh when and where, and all below<BR>
And all above would know;<BR>
But be thou perfect with the Lord thy God!<BR>
O sleeper! rise and call upon thy God!</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE HEART'S DESIRE</H3>
<P>Lord! unto thee are ever manifest<BR>
My inmost heart's desires, though unexprest <A NAME="page_346"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 346</FONT></A><BR>
In spoken words. Thy mercy I implore<BR>
Even for a moment--then to die were blest.</P>
<P>Oh! if I might but win that grace divine,<BR>
Into thy hand,, O Lord, I would resign<BR>
My spirit then, and lay me down in peace<BR>
To my repose, and sweetest sleep were mine.</P>
<P>Afar from thee in midst of life I die,<BR>
And life in death I find, when thou art nigh.<BR>
Alas! I know not how to seek thy face,<BR>
Nor how to serve and worship thee, Most High.</P>
<P>Oh! lead me in thy path, and turn again<BR>
My heart's captivity, and break in twain<BR>
The yoke of folly: teach me to afflict<BR>
My soul, the while I yet life's strength retain.</P>
<P>Despise not thou my lowly penitence,<BR>
Ere comes the day, when, deadened every sense,<BR>
My limbs too feeble grown to bear my weight,<BR>
A burden to myself, I journey hence.</P>
<P>When to the all-consuming moth a prey,<BR>
My wasted form sinks slowly to decay,<BR>
And I shall seek the place my fathers sought,<BR>
And find my rest there where at rest are they.</P>
<P>I am on earth a sojourner, a guest,<BR>
And my inheritance is in her breast,<BR>
My youth has sought as yet its own desires,<BR>
When will my soul's true welfare be my quest?</P>
<P>The world is too much with me, and its din<BR>
Prevents my search eternal peace to win.<BR>
How can I serve my Maker when my heart<BR>
Is passion's captive, is a slave to sin?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_347"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 347</FONT></A></P>
<P>But should I strive to scale ambition's height,<BR>
Who with the worm may sleep ere fall of night?<BR>
Or can I joy in happiness to-day<BR>
Who know not what may chance by morning's light?</P>
<P>My days and nights will soon, with restless speed,<BR>
Consume life's remnant yet to me decreed;<BR>
Then half my body shall the winds disperse,<BR>
Half will return to dust, as dust indeed.</P>
<P>What more can I allege? From youth to age<BR>
Passion pursues me still at every stage.<BR>
If thou art not my portion, what is mine?<BR>
Lacking thy favor, what my heritage?</P>
<P>Bare of good deeds, scorched by temptation's fire,<BR>
Yet to thy mercy dares my soul aspire;<BR>
But wherefore speech prolong, since unto Thee,<BR>
Lord, is manifest my heart's desire?</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HYMN FOR PENTECOST</H3>
<P>When thou didst descend upon Sinai's mountain,<BR>
It trembled and shook 'neath thy mighty hand,<BR>
And the rocks were moved by thy power and splendor;<BR>
How then can my spirit before thee stand<BR>
On the day when darkness o'erspread the heavens,<BR>
And the sun was hidden at thy command?<BR>
The angels of God, for thy, great name's worship,<BR>
Are ranged before thee, a shining band,<BR>
And the children of men are waiting ever<BR>
Thy mercies unnumbered as grains of sand;<BR>
The law they received from the mouth of thy glory,<BR>
They learn and consider and understand.<BR>
Oh! accept thou their song and rejoice in their gladness,<BR>
Who proclaim thy glory in every land.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">GOD AND MAN</H3>
<P>O Lord! I will declare<BR>
Thy holy name, thy glories past compare:<BR>
My tongue shall not conceal, O Lord!<BR>
Thy righteousness made known to me:<BR>
I heard and I believed thy word,<BR>
I will not ask presumptuously.<BR>
For should the vase of clay<BR>
"What doest thou?" unto its maker say?<BR>
Him have I sought and known,<BR>
A rock of strength, a tower of might,<BR>
Resplendent as the glorious light,<BR>
Without or veil or covering, radiant shown:<BR>
Exalted, magnified,<BR>
Extolled and glorified.</P>
<P>The heavens from hour to hour<BR>
Declare thy wondrous works, proclaim thy power;<BR>
Sunrise and sunset, still the same,<BR>
Prostrate in awe eternally.<BR>
The angels pass through flood and flame<BR>
As unto thee they testify;<BR>
Thy praise they celebrate,<BR>
O thou, the fruit of lips who dost create.<BR>
For thou uphold'st alone,<BR>
Unwearied and invisible,<BR>
The depths, the heights, where move and dwell<BR>
The living creatures and the heavenly throne:<BR>
Exalted, magnified,<BR>
Extolled and glorified.</P>
<P>Who has the glory praised<BR>
Fitly of him, whose word the heavens upraised?<BR>
The Eternal One, who dwells concealed<BR>
In his exalted heights, but yet<BR>
In Zion's temple, full revealed,<BR>
Did erst his glorious presence set,<BR>
And he showed visions then <A NAME="page_349"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 349</FONT></A><BR>
To cause his image to be seen of men;<BR>
Yet past all measuring<BR>
His wisdom is, past depth and height<BR>
He flashes on his prophet's sight<BR>
In visions only as the heavenly king:<BR>
Exalted, magnified,<BR>
Extolled and glorified.</P>
<P>His power, exceeding great,<BR>
Is without end: who can his praise narrate?<BR>
Happy the man, who testifies<BR>
Unto his greatness manifold,<BR>
Whose faith in God unshaken lies,<BR>
In God, whose arms the world uphold,<BR>
Who, fearing God, can trust<BR>
In Him, acknowledging his deeds are just,<BR>
That for himself has he<BR>
Made all his works, his creatures all,<BR>
And that his awful day will call<BR>
All men, the judgment of their deeds to see:<BR>
Exalted, magnified,<BR>
Extolled and glorified.</P>
<P>Do thou then heed and learn,<BR>
Prepare thyself thy nature to discern.<BR>
See whence thou comest, what thou art,<BR>
And who created thee and taught<BR>
Thee knowledge, and in every part<BR>
Of thee the power of motion wrought.<BR>
Mark then God's might untold,<BR>
And rouse thyself his wonders to behold.<BR>
But to himself concealed<BR>
Dare not to stretch thy hand, for then<BR>
Thou seekest, with presumptuous ken,<BR>
The first and last, the hidden and revealed:<BR>
Exalted, magnified,<BR>
Extolled and glorified.</P>
