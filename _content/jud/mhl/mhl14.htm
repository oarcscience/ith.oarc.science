<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">MY KING</H3>
<P>Ere time began, ere age to age had thrilled,<BR>
I waited in his storehouse, as he willed;<BR>
He gave me being, but, my years fulfilled,<BR>
I shall be summoned back before the King.</P>
<P>He called the hidden to the light of day,<BR>
To right and left, each side the fountain lay,<BR>
From out the stream and down the steps, the way<BR>
That led me to the garden of the King.</P>
<P>Thou gavest me a light my path to guide,<BR>
To prove my heart's recesses still untried;<BR>
And as I went, thy voice in warning cried:<BR>
"Child! fear thou him who is thy God and King!"</P>
<P>True weight and measure learned my heart from thee;<BR>
If blessings follow, then what joy for me!<BR>
If naught but sin, all mine the shame must be,<BR>
For that was not determined by the King.</P>
<P>I hasten, trembling, to confess the whole<BR>
Of my transgressions, ere I reach the goal<BR>
Where mine own words must witness 'gainst my soul,<BR>
And who dares doubt the writing of the King?</P>
<P>Erring I wandered in the wilderness,<BR>
In passion's grave night sinking powerless:<BR>
Now deeply I repent, in sore distress,<BR>
That I kept not the Statutes of the King!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_353"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 353</FONT></A></P>
<P>With worldly longings was my bosom fraught,<BR>
Earth's idle toys and follies all I sought;<BR>
Ah! when he judges joys so dearly bought,<BR>
How greatly shall I fear my Lord and King!</P>
<P>Now conscience-stricken, humbled to the dust,<BR>
Doubting himself, in thee alone his trust,<BR>
He shrinks in terror back, for God is just<BR>
How can a sinner hope to reach the King?</P>
<P>Oh! be thy mercy in the balance laid,<BR>
To hold thy servant's sins more lightly weighed,<BR>
When, his confession penitently made,<BR>
He answers for his guilt before the King.</P>
<P>Thine is the love, O God! and thine the grace,<BR>
That folds the sinner in its mild embrace;<BR>
Thine the forgiveness bridging o'er the space<BR>
'Twixt man's works and the task set by the King.</P>
<P>Unheeding all my sins, I cling to thee!<BR>
I know that mercy will thy footstool be:<BR>
Before I call, oh! do thou answer me,<BR>
For nothing dare I claim of thee, my King!</P>
<P>O thou who makest guilt to disappear,<BR>
My help, my hope, my rock, I will not fear;<BR>
Though thou the body hold in dungeon drear,<BR>
The soul has found the palace of the King.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HYMN FOR TABERNACLES</H3>
<P>Thy praise, O Lord! will I proclaim<BR>
In hymns unto thy glorious name.<BR>
O thou Redeemer, Lord and King,<BR>
Redemption to thy faithful bring!<BR>
Before thine altar they rejoice <A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A><BR>
With branch of palm and myrtle stem,<BR>
To thee they raise the prayerful voice--<BR>
Have mercy, save and prosper them.</P>
<P>Mayst thou, in mercy manifold,<BR>
Dear unto thee thy people hold,<BR>
When at thy gate they bend the knee,<BR>
And worship and acknowledge thee.<BR>
Do thou their hearts' desire fulfil,<BR>
Rejoice with them in love this day,<BR>
Forgive their sins and thoughts of ill,<BR>
And their transgressions cast away.</P>
<P>They overflow with prayer and praise<BR>
To him, who knows the future days.<BR>
Have mercy thou, and hear the prayer<BR>
Of those who palms and myrtles bear.<BR>
Thee day and night they sanctify,<BR>
And in perpetual song adore;<BR>
Like to the heavenly hosts they cry:<BR>
"Blessed art thou for evermore."</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">JUDGMENT AND MERCY</H3>
<P>By the faithful of his children in their conclaves<BR>
Shall his name be sanctified,<BR>
Awe-inspiring are the praises of his angels,<BR>
And the voices in his temple spread his glory<BR>
Far and wide.</P>
<P>Those who keep his law shall yet again be gathered<BR>
To the stronghold of his might,<BR>
Those who fear him commune, praying, with each other--<BR>
He will hear and in the book of their memorial<BR>
He will write.</P>
<P>Let your deeds be fair and righteous--then unbroken<BR>
He the covenant will hold. <A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A><BR>
He who maketh bright the heavens, he will heed you<BR>
And will count your prayers more precious than the off'rings<BR>
Brought of old.</P>
<P>May the tribes of those who worship and proclaim him<BR>
Be uplifted as of yore,<BR>
When he pruneth, may he cut the straggling branches,<BR>
For to him belong the sov'reignty and kingdom<BR>
Evermore.</P>
<P>May he lead us once again unto the mountain<BR>
Of his sanctuary's shrine,<BR>
There to glorify him ever in his temple,<BR>
For our God will not forget his word, the holy<BR>
And divine.</P>
<P>At his name shall heaven and earth break forth in praises<BR>
With a joy that shall not cease,<BR>
And the woods shall shout and clap their hands in gladness,<BR>
For the Lord our God has visited his people,<BR>
Bringing peace.</P>
<P>From each band of angels mighty in their splendor,<BR>
From each shining, circling star,<BR>
Hymns and praises evermore declare his glory,<BR>
Saying, "Praise him with the sound of joyful trumpets,<BR>
The Shophar!"</P>
<P>All the creatures of the universe together,<BR>
Heaven above and earth below,<BR>
Shall proclaim, "The Lord in all his works is mighty,<BR>
He is king o'er all the earth, and his salvation<BR>
All shall know."</P>

<P>Our Rock with loving care,<BR>

Be led there, every one,<BR>
By David's holy son,<BR>
The anointed of the Lord.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">LORD OF THE UNIVERSE</H3>
<P>Lord of the universe, who reigned<BR>
Ere earth and heaven's fashioning,<BR>
When to create the world he deigned,<BR>
Then was his name proclaim&egrave;d King.</P>
<P>And at the end of days shall he,<BR>
The Dreaded One, still reign alone,<BR>
Who was, who is, and still will be<BR>
Unchanged upon his glorious throne.</P>
<P>And he is one, his powers transcend,<BR>
Supreme, unfathomed, depth and height,<BR>
Without beginning, without end,<BR>
His are dominion, power, and might.</P>
<P>My God and my Redeemer he,<BR>
My rock in sorrow's darkest day,<BR>
A help and refuge unto me,<BR>
My cup's full portion, when I pray.</P>
<P>My soul into his hand divine<BR>
Do I commend; I will not fear,<BR>
My body with it I resign,<BR>
I dread no evil; God is near.</P>
