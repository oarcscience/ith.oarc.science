<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">O SOUL, WITH STORMS BESET!</H3>
<P>O soul, with storms beset!<BR>
Thy griefs and cares forget.<BR>
Why dread earth's transient woe,<BR>
When soon thy body in the grave unseen<BR>
Shall be laid low,<BR>
And all will be forgotten then, as though<BR>
It had not been?</P>
<P>Wherefore, my soul, be still!<BR>
Adore God's holy will,<BR>
Fear death's supreme decree.<BR>
Thus mayest thou save thyself, and win high aid<BR>
To profit thee,<BR>
When thou, returning to thy lord, shalt see<BR>
Thy deeds repaid.</P>
<P>Why muse, O troubled soul,<BR>
O'er life's poor earthly goal?<BR>
When thou hast fled, the clay<BR>
Lies mute, nor bear'st thou aught of wealth, or might<BR>
With thee that day,<BR>
But, like a bird, unto thy nest away,<BR>
Thou wilt take flight.</P>
<P>Why for a land lament<BR>
In which a lifetime spent<BR>
Is as a hurried breath?<BR>
Where splendor turns to gloom, and honors show<BR>
A faded wreath,<BR>
Where health and healing soon must sink beneath<BR>
The fatal bow?</P>
<P><A NAME="page_335"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 335</FONT></A></P>
<P>What seemeth good and fair<BR>
Is often falsehood there.<BR>
Gold melts like shifting sands,<BR>
Thy hoarded riches pass to other men<BR>
And strangers' hands,<BR>
And what will all thy treasured wealth and lands<BR>
Avail thee then?</P>
<P>Life is a vine, whose crown<BR>
The reaper Death cuts down.<BR>
His ever-watchful eyes<BR>
Mark every step until night's shadows fall,<BR>
And swiftly flies<BR>
The passing day, and ah! how distant lies<BR>
The goal of all.</P>
<P>Therefore, rebellious soul,<BR>
Thy base desires control;<BR>
With scantly given bread<BR>
Content thyself, nor let thy memory stray<BR>
To splendors fled,<BR>
But call to mind affliction's weight, and dread<BR>
The judgment-day.</P>
<P>Prostrate and humbled go,<BR>
Like to the dove laid low,<BR>
Remember evermore<BR>
The peace of heaven, the Lord's eternal rest.<BR>
When burdened sore<BR>
With sorrow's load, at every step implore<BR>
His succor blest.</P>
<P>Before God's mercy-seat<BR>
His pardoning love entreat.<BR>
Make pure thy thoughts from sin,<BR>
And bring a contrite heart as sacrifice<BR>
His grace to win--<BR>
Then will his angels come and lead thee in<BR>
To Paradise.</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE LAND OF PEACE</H3>
<P>Whose works, O Lord, like thine can be,<BR>
Who 'neath thy throne of grace,<BR>
For those pure souls from earth set free,<BR>
Hast made a dwelling-place?</P>
<P>There are the sinless spirits bound,<BR>
Up in the bond of life,<BR>
The weary there new strength have found,<BR>
The weak have rest from strife.</P>
<P>Sweet peace and calm their spirits bless,<BR>
Who reach that heavenly home,<BR>
And never-ending pleasantness--<BR>
Such is the world to come.</P>
<P>There glorious visions manifold<BR>
Those happy ones delight,<BR>
And in God's presence they behold<BR>
Themselves and him aright.</P>
<P>In the King's palace they abide,<BR>
And at his table eat,<BR>
With kingly dainties satisfied,<BR>
Spiritual food most sweet.</P>
<P>This is the rest forever sure,<BR>
This is the heritage,<BR>
Whose goodness and whose bliss endure<BR>
Unchanged from age to age.</P>
<P>This is the land the spirit knows<BR>
That everlastingly<BR>
With milk and honey overflows<BR>
And such its fruit shall be.</P>
