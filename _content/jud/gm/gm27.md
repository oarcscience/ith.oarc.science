### HIS TORAH

<span class="smallcaps">When</span> the Baal Shem Tov was near his
death, a student came to him with a written book and said, "These are
your words, which I have written down. This is the Torah of Rabbi
Israel."

The Master read what was written, and said, "Not one word of this is my
Torah."

 

Before he died, Rabbi Israel said, "The holy men after me will be as the
leaves on the trees. The Tsadikim will be as numerous as poppyseeds, and
as great."
