<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">All</span> of the knowledge of Power that the Baal Shem Tov ever possessed was contained in the secret book that he had received from Rabbi Adam.</p>  
<p>After the Baal Shem had returned from his journey to the Ancient Land, he prepared for his journey to eternity.</p>  
<p>Then Rabbi Adam came down to the Baal Shem Tov and said, "You have no more need of this Book. The Book is in your heart."</p>  
<p>Rabbi Israel asked, "Who shall have it after me?"</p>  
<p>That was the Book of Mysteries that had been given only to seven. It was given to Adam, and to Abraham, to Joseph, and to Joshua ben Nun, to Solomon, and to Rabbi Adam, and to Rabbi Israel, son of Eleazer.</p>  
<p>And the eighth one to possess the Book of Wisdom shall be Messiah, Son of David.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>The Baal Shem Tov and Rabbi Adam went up into the mountains. They found a great stone. Rabbi Adam touched the stone, and the stone split open. Within the stone, Rabbi Israel placed the Book of Wisdom. Then he touched the stone, and the stone closed.</p>
