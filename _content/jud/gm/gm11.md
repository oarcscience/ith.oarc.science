### THE STANDING SHEEP

<span class="smallcaps">Once</span>, when the Baal Shem Tov was on a
journey, Sabbath overtook him on the highway. He stopped the wagon, and
went out into the field to perform the services that welcome the coming
of Sabbath, and to remain there until the Sabbath was ended.

On the field, a flock of sheep were grazing.

When the Baal Shem Tov raised his voice and spoke the prayers that
welcome the Sabbath as the coming of a Bride, the sheep rose upon their
hind legs, and lifted their heads in the air, and stood like people
listening.

And so they remained in wrapt attention for two hours, all the while
that the Baal Shem spoke.
