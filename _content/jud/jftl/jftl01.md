# PREFACE

THE very cordial welcome given to my earlier volume of "Jewish Fairy
Tales and Fables" has prompted me to draw further upon Rabbinic lore in
the interest, chiefly, of the children. How the wise Rabbis of old took
into account the necessities of the little ones, whose minds they
understood so perfectly, is obvious from such legends as those dealing
with boyish exploits of the great Biblical characters, Abraham, Moses,
and David. These I have rewritten from the stories in the Talmud and
Midrash in a manner suitable for the children of to-day.

I have ventured also beyond the confines of these two wonderful
compilations. There is a wealth of delightful imagination in the legends
and folk-lore of the Jews of a later period which is almost entirely
unknown to children. I have drawn also on these sources for some of the
stories here presented. My desire is to give boys and girls something
Jewish which they may be able to regard as companion delights to the
treasury of general fairy-lore and childish romance.

AUNT NAOMI.
