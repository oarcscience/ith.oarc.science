This is a scholarly study of the origin and evolution of the Kabbalah.
Originally published in French in 1843, with a second
French edition in 1889, this book traces the origins
of the philosophical concepts of the Kabbalah to the ancient
Zoroastrians.
Franck goes into fascinating detail about the doctrine of the Kabbalah,
as expressed in the Sepher Yetzirah and the Zohar.
He uses internal evidence to trace the origins of these texts
many centuries prior to their first
known publication in the thirteenth century C.E.</P>

Franck carefully compares the philosophy of the Kabbalah with
Greek philosophy, the Alexandrians, Philo, and the Gnostics, and
concludes that, although there are similarities, none of them can claim
to be the source of the Kabbalah.
However, he does find many more similarities with the ancient
Zoroastrian beliefs.
By this process of elimination, he comes to the conclusion that
the doctrines of the Kabbalah had their origin during the
Babylonian exile circa 500 B.C.E., which was also the
time when Zoroaster was active in the same geographical region.
This thesis is worth considering, and potentially adds more weight to the 
already numerous contributions of
