This is a scholarly study of the origin and evolution of the Kabbalah.
Originally published in French in 1843, with a second French edition in
1889, this book traces the origins of the philosophical concepts of the
Kabbalah to the ancient Zoroastrians. Franck goes into fascinating
detail about the doctrine of the Kabbalah, as expressed in the Sepher
Yetzirah and the Zohar. He uses internal evidence to trace the origins
of these texts many centuries prior to their first known publication in
the thirteenth century C.E.

Franck carefully compares the philosophy of the Kabbalah with Greek
philosophy, the Alexandrians, Philo, and the Gnostics, and concludes
that, although there are similarities, none of them can claim to be the
source of the Kabbalah. However, he does find many more similarities
with the ancient Zoroastrian beliefs. By this process of elimination, he
comes to the conclusion that the doctrines of the Kabbalah had their
origin during the Babylonian exile circa 500 B.C.E., which was also the
time when Zoroaster was active in the same geographical region. This
thesis is worth considering, and potentially adds more weight to the
already numerous contributions of [Zoroastrianism](../../zor/index) to
world culture.
