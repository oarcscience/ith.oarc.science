#### On Reciting the Shma‘ with Intention, and on Saluting between the Sections.

*M*. II. 1. If one is reading <span id="fr_97"></span>[7](#fn_97) \[the
Shma‘\] in the Law and the time has come for reciting it, then if he
reads with intention he has fulfilled the obligation \[of reciting the
Shma‘\], but if not \[with intention\] he has not. And at the
sections <span id="fr_98"></span>[8](#fn_98) he may give a salutation
out of respect \[to his friend\], and he may reply to a salutation
given. And in

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>the middle \[of a section\] he may
give it, out of fear \[of a superior\], and he may reply. This is the
opinion of R. Meir. R. Judah says: In the middle he may give it out of
fear, and may reply out of respect; and at the sections he may give it
out of respect, and may give the usual response of "Peace" to any
one. <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99)

**T**. II. 2. He who recites the Shma‘ must direct his attention to it.
R. Achai <span id="fr_100"></span>[2](#fn_100) says in the name of R.
Judah, If he directs his attention to it in the first section, although
he has not directed his attention to it in the later section, he has
fulfilled his duty.
