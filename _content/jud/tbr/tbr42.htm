<P><A NAME="fn_365"></A><A HREF="tbr42.htm#fr_366">59:2</A> <i>Dmai</i>. Literally, "suspicion" or "talk." Fruits about which there is a suspicion whether they have been tithed or not. The third treatise of the Mishna deals with this subject, and is so called. For the duty of tithing see Lev. 27<sup>30</sup>.</P>

For the Contribution see Num. 15<sup>19-21</sup>, and Driver's note on Deut. 12<sup>6</sup>. It is said to have varied from the sixtieth to the fortieth part of the whole untithed produce. The remainder was tithed.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_367"></A><A HREF="tbr42.htm#fr_368">59:4</A> <i>Second Tithes</i>, Num. 18<sup>26</sup>. The Second Tithe was taken from the remainder after the First Tithe.</P>
