Women, and slaves, and little children,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_376"></A><A HREF="#fn_375"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> are not invited [to say the Benediction]. What is the least account of food which qualifies for the invitation? Not less than the size of an olive. R. Judah says not less than the size of an egg.</p>  
<p><DIR><b>T</b>. V. 14.

<p>13. One who is of double sex sets one like himself free [from his obligation], but no one else; one who is of uncertain sex sets neither free.</p>  
<p>16. One who is half a slave and half of free birth sets neither one like himself nor any one else free [from their obligation].</p>  
<p>17. Women and slaves and children do not set the majority free from their obligation. [Yet] in fact they say:&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_381"></A><A HREF="#fn_380"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> A woman says the Benediction for her husband, a son for his father, a slave for his master.</p>  
<p>18. A child who can eat anything about the size of an olive we include in the invitation to say the Benediction, but him who cannot eat anything about the size of an olive we do not. We do not insist on preciseness with a child, whether he says, "Let us bless," or says, "Blessed be He." We do not take him up for this, but the precisians do take him up for this.</p>  
<p>20. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel says: If they have gone upstairs, and have reclined at meat, and he dips his hands (in the dish) with them, although he has not eaten with them [any] corn as much as an olive, behold these invite him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_382"></A><A HREF="#fn_381"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>11. If a sweet relish comes to him in the middle of the meal, one says the Benediction over the meal, and lets the sweet relish go free.</p>  
<p>12. R. Mona&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_383"></A><A HREF="#fn_382"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> says in the name of R. Judah, A bit of bread that comes with dessert after food requires a Benediction before it and after it.</p>
