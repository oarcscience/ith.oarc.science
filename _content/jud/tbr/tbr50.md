#### On Wiping one's Hands.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 4 (3). The School of Shammai
say: One *M*. wipes his hands <span id="fr_410"></span>[3](#fn_409) with
a napkin, and lays it on the table; <span
id="fr_411"></span>[4](#fn_410) and the School of Hillel say: On the
cushion. <span id="fr_412"></span>[5](#fn_411)

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

**T**. VI. 3. The School of Shammai say: One wipes his hands with a
napkin, and leaves it on the table. Perchance \[any\] moisture which is
on the napkin becomes unclean through the cushion \[if the napkin were
placed there\], and makes his hands unclean again.

The School of Hillel say: Any doubt about moisture on his hands means
that he is clean.

Another reason \[is given\]: The washing of the hands is not for
ordinary food. <span id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_412) But one wipes his
hand with a napkin, and leaves it on the cushion. Perchance \[any\]
moisture which is on the napkin will become unclean through the table,
and make the eatables unclean again.

5\. The School of Shammai say: The cup of wine <span
id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_413) is on one's right hand, and
sweet-smelling oil on one's left. He says the Benediction over the wine
and afterwards says the Benediction over the oil. <span
id="fr_415"></span>[3](#fn_414) But the School of Hillel say:
Sweet-smelling oil on his right, and cup of wine on his left. He says
the Benediction over the oil and smears it on the head of the
attendant. <span id="fr_416"></span>[4](#fn_415) If the attendant be
learned in the Law, he smears it on the wall, for it is no credit to one
learned in the Law to go out anointed with perfume.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_409"></span>[67:3](tbr50.htm#fr_410) *wipes his hands*.
After the first washing before eating.

<span id="fn_410"></span>[67:4](tbr50.htm#fr_411) See *T*.

<span id="fn_411"></span>[67:5](tbr50.htm#fr_412) *the cushion*. *i.e.*
on which he is lying.

<span id="fn_412"></span>[68:1](tbr50.htm#fr_413) *not for ordinary
food*. It is thus not a question of making the hands, but the eatables,
unclean.

<span id="fn_413"></span>[68:2](tbr50.htm#fr_414) *the cup of wine*. At
the end of Sabbath.

<span id="fn_414"></span>[68:3](tbr50.htm#fr_415) *afterwards says the
Benediction over the oil*. The wine is the more important.

<span id="fn_415"></span>[68:4](tbr50.htm#fr_416) *on the head of the
attendan*t. So as not to waste it.
