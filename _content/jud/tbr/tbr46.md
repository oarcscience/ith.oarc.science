#### On Companies joining for the Benediction at the End of a Meal. The Benediction over Wine—Whether Water should be added first.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 8 (5). If there are two
companies that are eating in one house when some of them \[can\] see the
others, behold, they join themselves together to give the invitation
\[to say the Benediction\]. But if not, then they give the invitation
each party to themselves.

They do not say the Benediction over the wine until one puts water into
it. This is the opinion of R. Eliezer. <span

Benediction.

<span id="fn_396"></span>[64:3](tbr46.htm#fr_397) *R. Eliezer*. His
reason was that until water was mixed with the wine there was some doubt
whether it was drunk (cf. [p. 45](tbr38.htm#page_45)). The Majority
assume it would be. The fact that our Lord spoke a Benediction over the
wine at the Last Supper (Mark 14<sup>23</sup>; Matt. 26<sup>27</sup>;
Luke 22<sup>17</sup>; and apparently 1 Cor. 11<sup>23-25</sup>). This
supplies no evidence that water had been already mixed with it, if He
followed the opinion of the Majority.
