#### The Closing Words of the Benedictions.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IX. 8*b* (5*c*). All the
"seals" <span id="fr_530"></span>[9](#fn_529) of the Benedictions which
were in the Temple were \[*i.e.* were closed

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>with\] "from ever." <span
id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_530) (But) from the time that the
Heretics <span id="fr_532"></span>[2](#fn_531) spoiled things, and said,
"There is no world save one," they ordered that \[men\] should say:
"from ever to ever." <span id="fr_533"></span>[3](#fn_532)

**T**. VII. 21. All the "seals" of the Benedictions which were said in
the Temple were "to everlasting." From the time that the Heretics
\[*minim*\] spoiled things, and said, There is no world save one, they
ordained that men should say, "from everlasting and to everlasting," and
\[so\] acknowledge that this world is when compared to the world to come
only like the vestibule in front of the dining-hall. <span
id="fr_534"></span>[4](#fn_533)

22\. They did not answer "Amen" in the Temple. And whence do we know
that they did not answer "Amen" in the Temple? Because it is said:
"*Stand up and bless the LORD your God from ever to ever*;" <span
id="fr_535"></span>[5](#fn_534) and it says \[then\] "*And let them
bless thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
praise*," above every single Blessing and above every single
\[ascription of\] praise. <span id="fr_536"></span>[6](#fn_535)

20\. He that openeth \[his Benediction\] with Yôd, Hê, <span
id="fr_537"></span>[7](#fn_536) and closeth <span
id="fr_538"></span>[8](#fn_537) with Yôd, Hê—behold, this is a wise man,
\[He that openeth\] with the Aleph but

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

not with Daleth, <span id="fr_539"></span>[1](#fn_538) and closeth with
Yôd, Hê—behold, this is a middling man. \[He that openeth\] with Yôd,
Hê, and closeth with Aleph but not with Daleth—behold, this is an
uneducated man. \[He that openeth\] with Aleph but not with Daleth, and
closeth with Aleph but not with Daleth—behold, this is another Way
\[altogether\]. <span id="fr_540"></span>[2](#fn_539)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_521"></span>[86:1](tbr62.htm#fr_522) *staff . . . shoes*.
Cf. Matt. 10<sup>10</sup>.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[86:2](tbr62.htm#fr_523) *the dust on his
feet*. Cf. Matt. 10<sup>14</sup>.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[86:3](tbr62.htm#fr_524) *a short cut*. The
word is *compendiaria* (*via*).

<span id="fn_524"></span>[86:4](tbr62.htm#fr_525) B. omits from "What of
wearing" to "regulation." Cf. *T*., infra, p. 220.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[86:5](tbr62.htm#fr_526) *in his linen cloth*
(*bisdîno*). Which he was wearing, Mark 14<sup>51</sup>.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[86:6](tbr62.htm#fr_527) Eccles. 5<sup>1</sup>.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[86:7](tbr62.htm#fr_528) Esther 4<sup>2</sup>.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[86:8](tbr62.htm#fr_529) *the Law says*. *i.e.*
in Eccles. 5<sup>1</sup>. For the application of the term "the Law" to
the Hagiographa, *cf*. John 10<sup>34</sup>, referring to Ps.
82<sup>6</sup>.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[86:9](tbr63.htm#fr_530) *All the* "*seals*."
So C, *kol chôtham*. But this should perhaps be emended to the usual
text *kol chôthme*, which may be read as "all the seals," or "all who
sealed." See the next note.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[87:1](tbr63.htm#fr_531) "*from ever*." C reads
*hāyu* *min ha‘ôlām*, literally, "were from ever" or "from the world."
But B has *hāyu* *’omrīm ‘ad ha‘ôlām*, "all they who sealed the
Benedictions which were in the Temple used to say 'for ever.'" Probably,
however, T. VII. 21 is right in reading only *‘ad*, "to," instead of
*min*, "from."

<span id="fn_531"></span>[87:2](tbr63.htm#fr_532) *the Heretics* (*ha
Minim*). Here plainly not the Hebrew-Christians, for these never denied
the existence of the next world. Cf. pp. [40](tbr34.htm#page_40) *sq*.,
[42](tbr36.htm#page_42).

<span id="fn_532"></span>[87:3](tbr63.htm#fr_533) *from ever to ever*.
Literally, "from the world and even to the world." Yet in Neh.
9<sup>5</sup> we find said in the Second Temple, "Arise, bless the LORD
your God from ever to ever." For other references see Dalman, *Worte*,
pp. 123 *sq*. (E. T. p. 151).

<span id="fn_533"></span>[87:4](tbr63.htm#fr_534) *the vestibule*. Cf.
*Aboth*, IV. 21(23).

<span id="fn_534"></span>[87:5](tbr63.htm#fr_535) Neh. 9<sup>5</sup>.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[87:6](tbr63.htm#fr_536) No mention is made of
"Amen."

<span id="fn_536"></span>[87:7](tbr63.htm#fr_537) *Yôd*, *Hê*. The first
and last letters of YHWH.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[87:8](tbr63.htm#fr_538) *closeth*. Literally,
"sealeth."

<span id="fn_538"></span>[88:1](tbr63.htm#fr_539) *not with Daleth*.
Laible explains that instead of beginning with Adonai (which stands for
YHWH), he begins with Elohim.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[88:2](tbr63.htm#fr_540) He mentions Elohim
twice, suggesting that there is more than one God.
