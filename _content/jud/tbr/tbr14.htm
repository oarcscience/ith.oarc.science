Are we to make mention of the Going forth from Egypt in the days of Messiah? Lo, it says: "<i>Therefore, behold the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, As the LORD liveth, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; but, As the LORD liveth, which brought up and which led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country</i>,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> etc. They said to him: [The meaning is] not that the Going forth from Egypt should be rooted out of their remembrance, but that you should make [the going forth from] Egypt an addition to [the deliverance from] the kingdoms; the kingdoms are the principal thing, and Egypt is extra.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Similarly in, "Thy name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> [The meaning is] not that the name of Jacob should be rooted out from him, but that [you should] make Jacob an addition to Israel&#8212;Israel is the principal thing, and Jacob is extra.</p>  
<p>11. Similarly [we read]: "<i>Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things of old</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> "Remember ye not the former things"&#8212;these are the yoke of the [heathen] kingdoms. "Neither consider the things of old"&#8212;these are the yoke of Egypt. "<i>Behold, I will do a new thing; now shall it spring forth; shall ye not know it?</i>"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A>&#8212;this is the</DIR></p>

But afterwards a lion attacked him; and he was delivered from it. He forgot the incident of the wolf, and used to narrate the incident of the lion. Afterwards a serpent attacked him, and he was delivered out of its power. He forgot the incidents of the two former, and used to narrate the incident of the serpent. Even so with Israel&#8212;the later calamities cause the former to be forgotten.</p>  
<p>12. Like unto it is: "<i>As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> At first, lo, she was princess over her people, now, lo, she is princess over the peoples of the world, for it is said: "for Sarah shall her name be."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_80"></A><A HREF="#fn_80"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

He was Abram while God had not held converse with him, and he was Abram after He had held converse with him. He was Hoshea while he had not entered on [his] greatness, and he was Hoshea after he had entered on [his] greatness. <i>Moses, Moses, Abraham, Abraham, Jacob, Jacob, Samuel, Samuel</i>, are expressions of affection and encouragement. They both hold good while He had not held converse with them, and both after He had held converse with them.
