<P><A NAME="fn_257"></A><A HREF="tbr34.htm#fr_258">40:2</A> <i>the thanksgiving for the lan</i>d. In the Benediction after the meal, SA, p. 280. The Erfurt text is ungrammatical, but the Vienna and the ordinary text read "who has not made mention of the covenant in the Benediction for the land." The covenant is "that which Thou hast sealed in our flesh."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_258"></A><A HREF="tbr35.htm#fr_259">40:3</A> <i>Over a bird's nest</i>. Deut. 22<sup>7</sup>. The prayer would continue "and therefore have mercy upon us." But this implies that Deut. 22<sup>7</sup> was recorded to exhibit God's mercy. It was not so. For otherwise God would not allow birds and beasts to be killed. That passage is to be accepted as God's decree, without our making use of it for such a purpose (<i>Tosaphoth Yom Tob</i>). It is possible, as the following cases are connected with heretical opinions, that the remembrance of Matt. 10<sup>29</sup> may also have had some influence.</P>

IX. 8 (5), <A HREF="tbr63.htm#page_87">p. 87</A>, and the common argument for the Trinity from the threefold use of "Holy" in Isa. vi. 3).</P>

It was correct for him who was invited to lead the Tephillah to decline the first time, but to yield to a second and third invitation (Gemara <i>T</i>. B. 34<sup>a</sup>).</P>
