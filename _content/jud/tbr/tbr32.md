#### The Additional Prayers—Whether to be said only in a Congregation.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IV. 7. R. Eleazar ben Azariah used
to say: The Additional Prayers are said only in the local
congregation. <span id="fr_205"></span>[5](#fn_204) But the
Teacher <span id="fr_206"></span>[6](#fn_205) says: Both in a local
congregation and where there is no local congregation. R. Judah used to
say in his name: <span id="fr_207"></span>[7](#fn_206) In every place
where there is a local congregation the individual is exempt from the
Additional Prayers. <span id="fr_208"></span>[8](#fn_207)

**T**. III. 10. In every festival in which there is no Additional
service, as, for example, Chanuka and Purim, at the morning and the
afternoon service one

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

prays the Eighteen, and says an abstract corresponding to the needs of
the occasion. <span id="fr_209"></span>[1](#fn_208) If he does not say
this he is not made to turn back. And in every festival in which there
is an Additional service, as, for example, the beginning of the month,
and the ordinary days in a festival, at the morning and the afternoon
service he prays the Eighteen, and says \[the special section for\] the
sanctification of the day <span id="fr_210"></span>[2](#fn_209) in the
Benediction about the Temple service. <span
id="fr_211"></span>[3](#fn_210) R. Eleazar says (that he says it) in the
*Hoda’ah*. <span id="fr_212"></span>[4](#fn_211) And if he does not he
is turned back.

And in the Additional services he prays seven <span
id="fr_213"></span>[5](#fn_212) \[Benedictions\] and says \[the special
section for\] the sanctification of the day in the middle.

11\. In the case of a sabbath which falls on the first day of the month,
or on the ordinary day of a festival, at morning and afternoon prayer
one prays sevens prayers, and says an abstract corresponding to the
needs of the occasion in the "Temple worship" Benediction. <span
id="fr_214"></span>[6](#fn_213) But R. Eleazar says, in the *Hoda’ah*.
If one has not said it, he is not turned back. And at the Additional
Prayers he prays seven prayers and says \[the special section for\] the
sanctification of the day in the middle.

12\. On sabbath, and festival, and the Day of Atonement, one prays seven
prayers, and says \[the special section for\] the sanctification of the
day in the middle. <span id="fr_215"></span>[7](#fn_214)

13\. The case of the festival of New Year's Day, which falls upon a
sabbath. The School of

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Shammai say: One
prays ten <span id="fr_216"></span>[1](tbr33.htm#fn_215)
\[Benedictions\], and says that for the sabbath by itself, and that for
the festival by itself, and he begins with that for the sabbath. But the
School of Hillel says: he prays nine <span
id="fr_217"></span>[2](tbr33.htm#fn_216) \[Benedictions\].

The case of a festival which falls on a sabbath. The School of Shammai
say: he prays eight \[Benedictions\], and says that for the sabbath by
itself, and that for the festival by itself, and he begins with that for
the sabbath. But the School of Hillel say: he prays seven, beginning
with that for the sabbath, and ending with that for the sabbath, and he
says \[the special section for\] the sanctification of the day in the
middle. R. Nathan says: also he seals it with: "Blessed be Thou that
sanctifiest the sabbath and Israel and the festival seasons." <span
