#### Salutations in the Name.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IX. 8*c* (5*d*). And they ordered
that a man should salute his companion in the Name. <span
id="fr_541"></span>[3](#fn_540) For it is said: "*And, behold, Boaz came
from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers: The LORD be with you, and they
said to him: The LORD bless thee*." <span
id="fr_542"></span>[4](#fn_541) And it says: "*The LORD be with thee,
thou mighty man of valour*." <span id="fr_543"></span>[5](#fn_542) And
it says: "*Despise not thy mother when she is old*." <span
id="fr_544"></span>[6](#fn_543)° And it says: "*It is time to work for
the LORD; they have made thy law void*." <span
id="fr_545"></span>[7](#fn_544) R. Nathan says: They break Thy law, at a
time when they work for the LORD. <span id="fr_546"></span>[8](#fn_545)

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

**T**. VII. 23. In ancient times when the Law was being forgotten of
Israel the elders used to dry-nurse it them, <span
id="fr_547"></span>[1](#fn_546) for it is said: "*And, behold, Boaz came
from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers, The LORD be with you*," <span
id="fr_548"></span>[2](#fn_547) and it says: "*The LORD be with thee,
thou mighty man of valour*." <span id="fr_549"></span>[3](#fn_548)

24\. Hillel the Elder <span id="fr_550"></span>[4](#fn_549) says: At a
time when men gather do thou scatter, and at a time when men scatter do
thou gather. \[That means\] At a time when thou seest that the Law is
precious to Israel, and all rejoice in it, do thou be scattering with
it. <span id="fr_551"></span>[5](#fn_550) For it is said: "*There is
that scattereth, and increaseth yet more*." <span
id="fr_552"></span>[6](#fn_551) And at a time when thou seest that the
Law is forgotten of Israel, and none pay attention to it, do thou be
gathering in it. <span id="fr_553"></span>[7](#fn_552) For it is said:
"*It is time to work for the LORD;* \[when\] *they have made thy law
void*." <span id="fr_554"></span>[8](#fn_553) R. Meir used to say: "They
have made thy law void, therefore it is time for the LORD to
work." <span id="fr_555"></span>[9](#fn_554)

R. Meir used to say: Thou hast no man in Israel who is not performing a
hundred commandments every day. He recites the Shma‘; he says
Benedictions before it and after it; he eats his bread, and says a
Benediction before it and after it; he prays the Eighteen Benedictions
three times, and he does the rest of all the commandments and says
Benedictions over them.

25\. And so R. Meir used to say: Thou hast no man in Israel whom the
commandments <span id="fr_556"></span>[10](#fn_555) do not

surround. *Tephillin* are on his head; and *Tephillin* on his arm; and a
*Mezuzah* on his door; and four *Tsitsith* surround him. And concerning
them said David: "*With seven a day do I praise thee, because of thy
righteous judgments*." <span id="fr_557"></span>[1](#fn_556) When he
entered into the public bath, circumcision was on his flesh, for it is
said: "*For the Chief Musician; set to the Eighth. A Psalm of
David*." <span id="fr_558"></span>[2](#fn_557) And it says, "*The angel
of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth
them*." <span id="fr_559"></span>[3](#fn_558)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_540"></span>[88:3](tbr64.htm#fr_541) *the Name*. The
following examples suggest that this was the Tetragrammaton. But if so
the regulation must be very early.

<span id="fn_541"></span>[88:4](tbr64.htm#fr_542) Ruth 2<sup>4</sup>.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[88:5](tbr64.htm#fr_543) Judges 6<sup>12</sup>.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[88:6](tbr64.htm#fr_544) Prov. 23<sup>22</sup>.
For "thy mother" (’imka) C reads ‘imka "with thee," as immediately
before, or, more probably, *‘amka* "thy people" *i.e.* thy elders,
representing thy people. In any case this is the recognized explanation
of "thy mother." Cf. Hos. ii. 2.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[88:7](tbr64.htm#fr_545) Ps. 119<sup>126</sup>.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[88:8](tbr64.htm#fr_546) R. Nathan's
interpretation is that zeal in God's service causes infraction of part
of His Law. Here the meaning appears to be that zealous greeting of
one's companions leads to a use of the Holy Name which in ordinary cases
is wrong. B reads "They break Thy law, because it is time to work for
the LORD," *i.e.* to work for the LORD sometimes requires the infraction
of the words of the Law. It seems only to express the meaning of C more
definitely.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[89:1](tbr64.htm#fr_547) *used to dry-nurse it
them*. Literally, "used to cause them to swallow it"; *i.e.* they taught
people truths without their being aware that they were being taught.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[89:2](tbr64.htm#fr_548) Ruth 2<sup>4</sup>.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[89:3](tbr64.htm#fr_549) Judges 6<sup>12</sup>.
Again the central truth of the Law is implied.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[89:4](tbr64.htm#fr_550) Hillel the Elder, see
[p. 27](tbr25.htm#page_27) note.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[89:5](tbr64.htm#fr_551) When men come in to
listen, do thou teach.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[89:6](tbr64.htm#fr_552) Prov. 11<sup>24</sup>.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[89:7](tbr64.htm#fr_553) When none regard it,
do thou learn from it.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[89:8](tbr64.htm#fr_554) Ps. 119<sup>126</sup>.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[89:9](tbr64.htm#fr_555) *or the LORD to work*.
That is, in anger.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[89:10](tbr64.htm#fr_556) *whom the
commandments*. The ordinary text reads "whom seven commandments," and
this seems necessary.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[90:1](tbr64.htm#fr_557) Ps. 119<sup>164</sup>.
Cf. the Yalqut on that verse, and on Ps. 6<sup>1</sup> (§ 633).

<span id="fn_557"></span>[90:2](tbr64.htm#fr_558) Ps. 12<sup>1</sup>.
Circumcision made an eighth commandment. Besides it was generally
performed on the eighth day.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[90:3](tbr64.htm#fr_559) Ps. 347. Each
commandment is such an angel.
