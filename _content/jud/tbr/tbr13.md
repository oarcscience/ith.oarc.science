### The Benedictions connected with the Shma‘.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>I. 7 (4). At dawn one says two
Benedictions <span id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46) *M*. before the Shma‘,
and one after it; <span id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47) \[\[In the evening
one says two Benedictions before it and one after it\]\]. <span
id="fr_48"></span>[4](#fn_48) In the evening two before it <span
id="fr_49"></span>[5](#fn_49) and two after it, <span
id="fr_50"></span>[6](#fn_50) one in the long and one in the short
form. <span id="fr_51"></span>[7](#fn_51)

In a place where they bid one use the long form it is not permissible to
use the short, and where to

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>use the short, it is not permissible
to use the long. Where \[they have bidden men\] "seal" <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52) it is not permissible not to seal, and
where not to seal, it is not permissible to seal.

**T**. I. 5. Why <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53) do they say <span
id="fr_54"></span>[3](#fn_54) "one in the short form?" In a place where
they bid one use the long form it is not permissible to use the short,
and where to use the short it is not permissible to use the long. Where
\[they bid one\] "seal," it is not permissible not to seal, and where
\[they bid\] not seal it is not permissible to seal. <span
id="fr_55"></span>[4](#fn_55) In a place where they bid one open it with
"Blessed" it is not permissible not to open it with "Blessed," and where
not to open it with "Blessed," it is not permissible to open it with
"Blessed." \[In a place where it is customary\] to bend <span
id="fr_56"></span>[5](#fn_56), it is not permissible not to bend, and
where not to bend, it is not permissible to bend.

6\. The following are the Benedictions which are said in the short form.
When one utters a Benediction over fruits, and over religious duties;
(also) the Benediction at the invitation, <span
id="fr_57"></span>[6](#fn_57) and the second Benediction at the
recitation of the Shma‘.

The following are the Benedictions which are said in the long form—the
Benediction at the Fasts, and the Benedictions on New Year's Day, and
the Benedictions on the Day of Atonement: By a man's benedictions it is
discovered whether he be ignorant or whether he be a scholar.

7\. The following are the Benedictions which one

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

does not "seal" with "Blessed"—when one utters a Benediction over
fruits, and over religious duties, (also) in the Benediction at the
invitation, and the second Benediction in the Benediction after a meal.
R. Jose the Galilean <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58) used to seal at
the Second Benediction in the Benediction after a meal, and use the long
form.

8\. The following are the Benedictions with which one opens with
"Blessed,"—the whole of the Benedictions one opens with "Blessed,"
except the Benediction which is joined to the recitation of the
Shma‘, <span id="fr_59"></span>[2](#fn_59) and the Benediction which is
joined to another Benediction. For one does not open in these with
"Blessed."

9\. The following are the Benedictions in which one bends forward, the
first Benediction, <span id="fr_60"></span>[3](#fn_60) at its beginning
and its end; and in the *Modim*, <span id="fr_61"></span>[4](#fn_61) at
its beginning and at its end. And as for him who bends forward in every
single Benediction, he is to be instructed that he should not bend
forward. We do not respond together with him who pronounces the
Benediction. <span id="fr_62"></span>[5](#fn_62) \[But\] R. Judah used
to respond together with him who pronounced the Benediction: "*Holy,
holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts, the whole earth is full of His
glory*," and "*Blessed be the glory of the LORD out of His
place*." <span id="fr_63"></span>[6](#fn_63) All these (words) R. Judah
used to say together with him who pronounced the Benediction.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_45"></span>[7:1](tbr12.htm#fr_45) See *M*. 3.

<span id="fn_46"></span>[7:2](tbr13.htm#fr_46) The first is *Yotser’
Ôr*, with additions (Staerk, pp. 4 *sq*., SA, 37-39), the second,
*’Ahabah rabbah* (Staerk, p. 6; SA, pp. 39 *sq*.)

<span id="fn_47"></span>[7:3](tbr13.htm#fr_47) This begins with *’Emeth
wyatzîb*, and includes the *Ge’ullah*, vide supra [p.
4](tbr11.htm#page_4).

<span id="fn_48"></span>[7:4](tbr13.htm#fr_48) The clause in \[\[ \]\],
found in C, is clearly an error.

<span id="fn_49"></span>[7:5](tbr13.htm#fr_49) *Ma‘arîb arabim* and
*’Ahabath ‘olâm* (Staerk, p. 8; SA, p. 96).

<span id="fn_50"></span>[7:6](tbr13.htm#fr_50) The first begins with
*’Emeth we-’emunah*, and includes the *Ge’ullah* (Staerk; p. 8; SA, pp.
98. *sq*.); the second begins with *Hashkibenu*, and is a prayer for
protection during the night (Staerk, P. 9; SA, pp. 99. *sq*.).

<span id="fn_51"></span>[7:7](tbr13.htm#fr_51) *one in the long and one
in the short form*. The meaning is not clear, for to-day the two prayers
are of much the same length. Perhaps formerly the first in each case was
the longer. Or perhaps permission was given to use an abstract (see [p.
30](tbr27.htm#page_30) note) in one, or in the other, of the two
prayers.

<span id="fn_52"></span>[8:1](tbr13.htm#fr_52) *seal*. *i.e.* with a
summary of the Benediction it follows, beginning with "Blessed."

<span id="fn_53"></span>[8:2](tbr13.htm#fr_53) *why*. The answer does
not seem to be given.

<span id="fn_54"></span>[8:3](tbr13.htm#fr_54) *do they say*. *i.e.* the
authorities in the mishna.

<span id="fn_55"></span>[8:4](tbr13.htm#fr_55) *not permissible to
seal*. So far the section is a quotation from our mishna, but the next
sentence is not there.

<span id="fn_56"></span>[8:5](tbr13.htm#fr_56) *to bend*. Compare what
is said of Aqiba in *T*. III. 5 ([p. 88](tbr63.htm#page_88)).

<span id="fn_57"></span>[8:6](tbr13.htm#fr_57) *the invitation*. See
*M*. vii. 1. (*infra*, [p. 59](tbr41.htm#page_59)).

<span id="fn_58"></span>[9:1](tbr13.htm#fr_58) *R. Jose the Galilean*.
In the younger group of the second generation of mishna-teachers (c.
110-130), to be carefully distinguished from R. Jose (ben Chalaphta). He
was the father of R. Eleazar bar Jose ([p. 29](tbr26.htm#page_29)).

<span id="fn_59"></span>[9:2](tbr13.htm#fr_59) *except the Benediction
which is joined to the recitation of the Shma‘*. *i.e.* *’Emeth wyatzib*
in the morning (SA, p. 42), and *’Emeth we-'emunah* in the evening (SA,
p. 98).

<span id="fn_60"></span>[9:3](tbr13.htm#fr_60) *the first Benediction*.
*i.e.* of the Tephillah, the *Eighteen Benedictions* (Staerk, pp. 9
*sq*. SA, p. 44).

<span id="fn_61"></span>[9:4](tbr13.htm#fr_61) *the Modim*. The 17th or
18th of the *Eighteen* (SA, p. 51).

<span id="fn_62"></span>[9:5](tbr13.htm#fr_62) *we do not respond
together*, etc. See *T*. III. 26, V. 21 (*infra*, [p.
73](tbr55.htm#page_73)).

<span id="fn_63"></span>[9:6](tbr13.htm#fr_63) Isa. 6<sup>3</sup>; Ezek.
3<sup>12</sup>, both in the third Benediction.
