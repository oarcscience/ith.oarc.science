#### Parenthesis: A Rabbi's Prayers on Entering and Leaving His "School."

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IV. 2. R. Nechuniah ben
ha-Qanah <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_186) used to pray on his
entering the School, <span id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_187) and on his
going out, a short prayer. They said to him, What is the nature <span
id="fr_189"></span>[3](#fn_188) of this prayer? He said to them: On my
entering I pray that no offence \[to others\] happens through me, <span
id="fr_190"></span>[4](#fn_189) and on my going out I give thanks for my
lot. <span id="fr_191"></span>[5](#fn_190)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_186"></span>[30:1](tbr27.htm#fr_187) *R. Nechuniah ben
ha-Qanah*. One of the first generation of mishna teachers, C. 90 A.D.,
the teacher of R. Ishmael ([p. 6](tbr12.htm#page_6)). He is the reputed
author of the Cabbalistic *Sepher ha Bahir*.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[30:2](tbr27.htm#fr_188) *the School*.
Literally, the Beth ha Midrash, the lecture room.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[30:3](tbr27.htm#fr_189) *nature*. So
Bartenora, literally "place." Possibly it means only "occasion."

<span id="fn_189"></span>[30:4](tbr27.htm#fr_190) *through me*. By a
wrong exposition, at which other scholars may laugh, glad at my mistake,
and so sin.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[30:5](tbr27.htm#fr_191) *my lot*. My calling
as a frequenter of the School. Both the prayer and the thanksgiving are
given in the Gemara, 28<sup>b</sup>.
