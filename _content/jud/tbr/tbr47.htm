The following are the points of difference between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_398"></A><A HREF="#fn_397"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the case of a meal. The School of Shammai say: One says&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_399"></A><A HREF="#fn_398"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the Benediction over the day, and afterwards the Benediction over the wine; and the School of Hillel say: One says the benediction over the wine, and afterwards over the day.</p>  
<p><DIR><b>T</b>. VI. 1. Matters which are in dispute between the School of Shammai and the School of Hillel in the case of a meal.</p>  
<p>The School of Shammai say: One pronounces the Benediction over the day, and afterwards the Benediction over the wine. For the day carries with it the coming of the wine, and the holy day had already come before the wine had come.</p>  
<p>The School of Hillel say: One pronounces the Benediction over the wine, and afterwards over the day. For the wine carries with it the saying of sanctification of the day.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_400"></A><A HREF="#fn_399"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Another reason [given] is: The Benediction of the wine is constant, but the Benediction of the day is not constant.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_401"></A><A HREF="#fn_400"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> And the Rule is according to the words of the School of Hillel.</p>

<p>In the case of sabbath nights and feast-day nights. In them [both] is the sanctification of the day (spoken) over the cup, and in them [both] is the mention [of the holiness of the day] in the Benediction after the meal.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_404"></A><A HREF="#fn_403"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Sabbath, and feast&#8212;day, and the first day of the month, and the weekdays of the feasts&#8212;in them [all] is the mention [of the holiness of the day] in the Benediction after the meal, but there is not in them the sanctification of the day over the cup.</DIR></p>
