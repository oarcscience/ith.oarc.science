<P><A NAME="fn_408"></A><A HREF="tbr49.htm#fr_409">67:2</A> The point is, that in sweeping up the crumbs perhaps a piece of food as large as an olive may be found among them, which would have been rendered unclean by water having been spilt on it. Hence the order according to the School of Shammai. But the, School of Hillel argues that to proceed on the supposition that so large a piece will be found on the floor implies that the attendant is an <i>&#8216;am ha&#8217;aretz</i>, who ought not to be so employed. The <i>Halaka</i>, however, follows the School of Shammai, thus permitting the use of an attendant who is an <i>&#8216;am ha&#8217;aretz</i>.</P>
