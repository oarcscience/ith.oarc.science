<p>They say in parables, To what is the matter like? To a king of flesh and blood who told his servant to boil him some broth, though he had never boiled him broth in his life. The result was he burnt the broth and provoked his master. [He told him] to make him a fold to his shirt, though he had never made him a fold to a shirt in his life.</DIR></p>

Jastrow (p. 1382<sup>b</sup>) translates the parallel passage in the Gemara, <i>T</i>.

<P><A NAME="fn_515"></A><A HREF="tbr60.htm#fr_516">85:1</A> <i>provoked his master</i>. The point of the parable is, that less is expected from a Gentile, a woman, and an uneducated person. They are all ignorant of the specific religious duties.</P>
