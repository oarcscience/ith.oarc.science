#### The Wording of the Benediction over the Lamp.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 6 (5 *continued*). The School
of Shammai say: "He who created the lamp <span
id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_421) of fire." The School of Hillel say:
"Creator of the lamps of fire." <span id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_422)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_421"></span>[70:1](tbr52.htm#fr_422) *the lamp*. The word
so translated here and in the following clause is *ma’ôr* (Gen.
1<sup>16</sup>), in the preceding mishna, *nêr*. But in *T*. *ma’ôr* is
used instead of *nêr*.

<span id="fn_422"></span>[70:2](tbr52.htm#fr_423) The difference in the
two forms of the Benediction appears to be that the School of Shammai
regarded the fire as containing the one manifestation of the divine
light, and the School of Hillel as containing various particles and
colours; also that the former regarded all as included in the one past
creation ("created"), the latter as the result of the LORD'S present
work ("creating" or "creator").
