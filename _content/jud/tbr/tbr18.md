#### Where Workmen may Recite the Shma‘.

II\. 5 (4). Workmen may recite \[the Shma‘\] on the top of a tree, or on
the top of a scaffold, although they are not free to do so in the
Prayer. <span id="fr_122"></span>[4](#fn_122)

**T**. II. 8. Labourers recite the Shma‘ if they are in the top of a
tree, and they say the Prayer if they are in the top of an olive—tree,
and in the top of a

fig-tree. <span id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123) But in the case of all
other trees, they come down and then say the Prayer. The owner of the
house in either case comes down and says the Prayer. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124)

9\. Labourers recite the Shma‘, and say the Benedictions before it and
after it <span id="fr_125"></span>[3](#fn_125) They eat their food and
say Benedictions before and after. <span id="fr_126"></span>[4](#fn_126)
They say the Eighteen Benedictions three times, <span
id="fr_127"></span>[5](#fn_127) but we do not let them go down in front
of the Ark \[to say prayers for others\]. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[6](#fn_128)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_122"></span>[18:4](tbr18.htm#fr_122) *in the Prayer*. The
Shma‘ requires attention only in its first verse, but the Eighteen
Benedictions throughout, for prayer is a matter of love (Bartenora).

<span id="fn_123"></span>[19:1](tbr18.htm#fr_123) *olive-tree . . . .
fig-tree*. There is not much danger of falling from these trees.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[19:2](tbr18.htm#fr_124) His time is not so
valuable.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[19:3](tbr18.htm#fr_125) *the Benedictions
before it and after it*. SA, pp. 39-42.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[19:4](tbr18.htm#fr_126) *before . . . after*.
Literally "before them" and "after them," *i.e.* the Shma‘ and the meal
(*vide infra*, [p. 23](tbr23.htm#page_23)).

<span id="fn_127"></span>[19:5](tbr18.htm#fr_127) *three times*. *i.e.*
morning, afternoon, and evening. The *shel* in Zuckermandel's text seems
to be a printer's error.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[19:6](tbr18.htm#fr_128) *let them go down in
front of the Ark*. Cf. *M*. V. 3: "him that passes before the Ark."
Either phrase was originally used of the leader in the Tephillah,
because he stepped forward in front of the Ark containing the rolls of
the Law. But the term remained on when he had taken his place there long
before the Tephillah. "Go down," because sometimes the Ark was lower
than the body of the synagogue, perhaps in order to teach humility. See
Elbogen, P. 497; SA, on p. 42 (p. lvi.). Cf. *infra*, [p.
40](tbr34.htm#page_40).
