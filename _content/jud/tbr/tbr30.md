#### Prayer when riding on an Ass.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IV. 5. Should one be riding on an
ass let him dismount. If he cannot dismount let him turn his face. <span
id="fr_199"></span>[2](#fn_198) And if he cannot turn his face let him
direct his intention towards the most Holy Sanctuary.

**T**. III. 18. If a man is riding on his ass, if he has anyone to hold
the ass for him let him descend and pray; but if not let him pray where
he is. Rabbi says: In either case he prays where he is, only he must
direct his intention.
