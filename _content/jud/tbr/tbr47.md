### Points in Dispute between the Schools of Shammai and Hillel: The Order of the Benedictions.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. I. The following are the
points of difference between the School of Shammai and the School of
Hillel <span id="fr_398"></span>[1](#fn_397) in the case of a meal. The
School of Shammai say: One says <span id="fr_399"></span>[2](#fn_398)
the Benediction over the day, and afterwards the Benediction over the
wine; and the School of Hillel say: One says the benediction over the
wine, and afterwards over the day.

**T**. VI. 1. Matters which are in dispute between the School of Shammai
and the School of Hillel in the case of a meal.

The School of Shammai say: One pronounces the Benediction over the day,
and afterwards the Benediction over the wine. For the day carries with
it the coming of the wine, and the holy day had already come before the
wine had come.

The School of Hillel say: One pronounces the Benediction over the wine,
and afterwards over the day. For the wine carries with it the saying of
sanctification of the day. <span id="fr_400"></span>[3](#fn_399) Another
reason \[given\] is: The Benediction of the wine is constant, but the
Benediction of the day is not constant. <span
id="fr_401"></span>[4](#fn_400) And the Rule is according to the words
of the School of Hillel.

III\. 8. The question of honouring the day and honouring the night. The
honouring of the day

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

takes the precedence over honouring the night. <span
id="fr_402"></span>[1](#fn_401) If one has only one cup (of wine), the
sanctification of the day takes the precedence over the honouring of the
day and the honouring of the night. <span
id="fr_403"></span>[2](#fn_402)

In the case of sabbath nights and feast-day nights. In them \[both\] is
the sanctification of the day (spoken) over the cup, and in them
\[both\] is the mention \[of the holiness of the day\] in the
Benediction after the meal. <span id="fr_404"></span>[3](#fn_403)

Sabbath, and feast—day, and the first day of the month, and the weekdays
of the feasts—in them \[all\] is the mention \[of the holiness of the
day\] in the Benediction after the meal, but there is not in them the
sanctification of the day over the cup.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_397"></span>[65:1](tbr47.htm#fr_398) The reasons in each
case are given in *T*.

<span id="fn_398"></span>[65:2](tbr47.htm#fr_399) *One says*. *i.e.* at
the beginning of Sabbaths and Festivals.

<span id="fn_399"></span>[65:3](tbr47.htm#fr_400) *sanctification of the
day*. The Benediction which mentions the day is never uttered without
the use of wine.

<span id="fn_400"></span>[65:4](tbr47.htm#fr_401) *constant . . . not
constant*. That which is done every day has a claim prior to that which
is done only occasionally.

<span id="fn_401"></span>[66:1](tbr47.htm#fr_402) If it is impossible to
honour both day and night of sabbath or festival by special meals one
should reserve it for the day (*cf*. Laible).

<span id="fn_402"></span>[66:2](tbr47.htm#fr_403) The Benediction should
be said over that one cup at the entrance of the day (*cf*. Laible).

<span id="fn_403"></span>[66:3](tbr47.htm#fr_404) The portion stating
the special reference of each festival is to be mentioned.
