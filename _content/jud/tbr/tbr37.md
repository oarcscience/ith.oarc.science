#### ADDITIONAL MATTER IN T.

##### Reverence in Writing the Name.

**T**. III. 22. He who is writing the name \[of the LORD\] may not
return a man's salutation even if it be that of a king. If he is writing
five or six such names, when he has finished one of them he returns the
salutation.

##### The Benediction of Mourners.

23\. In a place where they are accustomed to say the Benediction of
Mourners as three prayers, <span id="fr_269"></span>[1](#fn_268) we say
three; where as two, we say two; where as one, we say one.

24\. In a place where they are accustomed to say the Benediction of
mourners as three prayers, a man combines the first with that about the
Resurrection of the Dead and seals it with "Thou that quickenest the
dead." \[He combines\] the second with "the consolation of the mourners"
and seals it with "He that consoleth His people and His city." \[He
combines\] the third with "the restitution of kindnesses," but does not
seal it. He that dismisses the congregation in the cemetery has no need
to seal.

##### On Certain Points in the Eighteen.

25\. The Eighteen Benedictions which the Majority have ordered,
correspond to the eighteen times that the LORD is mentioned in the Psalm
beginning "*Give to the LORD, O ye sons of the mighty*." <span
id="fr_270"></span>[2](#fn_269) One combines \[the Benediction about\]
the *Minim* <span id="fr_271"></span>[3](#fn_270) with

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

that about the Pharisees, <span id="fr_272"></span>[1](tbr38.htm#fn_271)
and that about the Proselytes with that about the Elders, <span
id="fr_273"></span>[2](tbr38.htm#fn_272) and that about David with that
about Jerusalem. <span id="fr_274"></span>[3](tbr38.htm#fn_273) If men
have said each of these by themselves, their obligation is fulfilled.

Palestinian, or "older form of the Twelfth Benediction is, "To the
apostates (*mshummāddim*) let there be no <span id="page_43">p.

days. And let the Christians (*notzrim*), and the *minim*, perish as in
a moment. Let them be wiped out of the book of life, and with the
righteous let them not be written. Blessed art Thou, O LORD, who
subdueth the proud." The common, and later, form may be found in SA, p.
48.
