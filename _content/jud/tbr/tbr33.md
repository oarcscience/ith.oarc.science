#### The Posture and Attention in Prayer.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>V. 1. Men stand <span
id="fr_219"></span>[4](#fn_218) not to pray save with solemnity. <span
id="fr_220"></span>[5](#fn_219) The pious of former time used to wait
for one hour and then pray, so that they might direct their intention
upon God. <span id="fr_221"></span>[6](#fn_220) Should the King <span
id="fr_222"></span>[7](#fn_221) salute him, let him not return the

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>salutation. And should even a
snake <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_222) twist round his heel, he
should not make a pause.

**T**. III. 4. Ben Azzai says: Everyone whose body suffers because of
his learning <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_223)—it is a favourable
sign for him; if his learning because of his body, it is a bad sign for
him. Everyone whose mind is disordered because of his learning it is a
favourable sign for him; and everyone whose learning is disordered
because of his mind, <span id="fr_225"></span>[3](#fn_224) it is a bad
sign for him. He that prayeth must direct his intention to it. Abba
Saul <span id="fr_226"></span>[4](#fn_225) says, The *Memoria
technica* <span id="fr_227"></span>[5](#fn_226) for the Prayer is,
"*When Thou directest their heart, Thou wilt cause Thine ear to
hear*." <span id="fr_228"></span>[6](#fn_227)

5\. R. Judah said: When R. Aqiba was praying with the congregation he
used to shorten \[his prayers, hurrying\] in front of them all; when he
was praying quite alone, if a man left him on this side (of the room) he
would come and find him on the other side, because of the bowings and
prostrations that he used to make. <span id="fr_229"></span>[7](#fn_228)

6\. Perhaps a man should pray the whole day long? He has clearly said in
the case of Daniel: "three times a day was he kneeling upon his
knees," <span id="fr_230"></span>[8](#fn_229) etc. Perhaps \[this was\]
from the time that he came into Captivity? It is expressly said: "as he
did aforetime." Perhaps one should say it loud enough for oneself to
hear? He has clearly said in

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

the case of Hannah: "*Now Hannah, she was speaking in her heart*, <span
id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_230) etc. Perhaps we should include them all
(the Eighteen) at one sitting? He has expressly stated in the case of
David: "*Evening, and morning, and noonday*," <span
id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_231) etc. "Evening "that is, evening prayer;
"morning"—that is, morning prayer; "noonday"—that is afternoon prayer
(Minchah). Perhaps one should ask for what one needs and then depart
(without saying the Benediction)? He has expressly stated in the case of
Solomon: "*to hearken unto the cry and to the prayer*" <span
id="fr_233"></span>[3](#fn_232) "cry"—that is chanting (in praise), and
so he says: "*Cry aloud, ye righteous, in the LORD*," <span
id="fr_234"></span>[4](#fn_233) etc. We do not say anything after "True
and sure," <span id="fr_235"></span>[5](#fn_234) but we do say things
after the Prayer, even though it be the Order of Confession of the Day
of Atonement. <span id="fr_236"></span>[6](#fn_235)

14\. A blind man, and whoever is not able to determine the direction in
which he faces, direct their intentions to God <span
id="fr_237"></span>[7](#fn_236) and pray; for it is said: "*and they
shall pray towards the LORD*." <span id="fr_238"></span>[8](#fn_237)

15\. They who stand \[praying\] outside the \[Holy\] Land set their
intention opposite the land of Israel, and pray; for it is said: "*and
they pray towards the LORD in the direction of their land* <span
id="fr_239"></span>[9](#fn_238) *which Thou hast chosen*." They who
stand in the land of Israel set their intention opposite Jerusalem and
pray; for it is said: "*and they pray towards this city*." <span
id="fr_240"></span>[10](#fn_239)

16\. They who stand in Jerusalem set their intention opposite the
Sanctuary, and pray; for it is said: "*and they pray towards this
place*." <span id="fr_241"></span>[11](#fn_240) a If they find
themselves standing on the north \[of the

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

temple\] their faces should be towards the south, if standing on the
south their faces should be towards the north, if standing on the east
their faces should be towards the west, if standing on the west their
faces should be towards the east, and so all Israel find themselves
praying to one place.

17\. A man may not stand upon a bed, nor upon a seat, nor upon a bench,
and pray, for there may be no high position before God; <span
id="fr_242"></span>[1](#fn_241) for it is said: "*Out of the depths have
cried unto thee, O LORD*." <span id="fr_243"></span>[2](#fn_242) if he
is old, or ill, behold, then it is permissible. <span
id="fr_244"></span>[3](#fn_243)

20\. Suppose a man is standing and praying in a camp <span
id="fr_245"></span>[4](#fn_244) or in an open highway, behold, he avoids
an ass or an ass-driver or a seller of pots; <span
id="fr_246"></span>[5](#fn_245) he does not pause \[in his prayer\].
They say concerning R. Chanina ben Dosa, that he was standing and
praying, and an *‘arod* <span id="fr_247"></span>[6](#fn_246) bit him,
and he made no pause. His disciples went and found it dead on the mouth
of its hole. They said: Woe to the man whom an *‘arod* has bitten;
\[but\] woe to the *‘arod* which bit ben Dosa.

21\. We do not stand up to pray straightway from conversation, nor from
laughter, nor from frivolity, nor from idle talk, but (we do) from
learned discourse.

And so a man should not take leave of his companion straightway from
conversation, nor from laughter, nor from idle talk, nor from frivolity,
but from learned discourse. For so we find in the

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

case of the prophets of old <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_247) that
they closed their words with words of praise and supplications. <span
id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_248)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_215"></span>[35:1](tbr32.htm#fr_216) *ten Benedictions*.
The first three and last three of the Eighteen, three for New Year's Day
(SA, pp. 241 *sq*.), and one for the sabbath (see Laible).

<span id="fn_216"></span>[35:2](tbr32.htm#fr_217) *nine*
\[(*Benedictions*)\]. Not adding a special Benediction about the
sabbath.

<span id="fn_217"></span>[35:3](tbr32.htm#fr_218) SA, p. 238.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[35:4](tbr33.htm#fr_219) *stand*. i.e. to say
the Eighteen (*cf*. pp. [4](tbr11.htm#page_4) *sq*.).

<span id="fn_219"></span>[35:5](tbr33.htm#fr_220) *with solemnity*. The
phrase is literally "with heaviness of head," *i.e.* with bending it
down, but probably the expression is here solely metaphorical, in
contrast to "lightness of head," *i.e.* irreverence, *cf*. *T*. III. 21
([p. 38](#page_38)). It is not far removed from the phrase "the poor in
spirit" (Matt 5<sup>3</sup>).

<span id="fn_220"></span>[35:6](tbr33.htm#fr_221) *God*. Lit.: the Place
([p. 29](tbr26.htm#page_29)). B has "their Father who is in heaven."

<span id="fn_221"></span>[35:7](tbr33.htm#fr_222) *the King*. An
Israelite, for to a heathen king one must answer, for fear of the
consequences (Bartenora).

<span id="fn_222"></span>[36:1](tbr33.htm#fr_223) *a snake*. An ordinary
one, which does not generally bite. But in the case of a viper or a
scorpion, which certainly bite and kill, he should pause (Bartenora).

<span id="fn_223"></span>[36:2](tbr33.htm#fr_224) *learning*. Lit.:
"wisdom," and so throughout this section.

<span id="fn_224"></span>[36:3](tbr33.htm#fr_225) *mind*. *da‘ath*,
perhaps constitution.

<span id="fn_225"></span>[36:4](tbr33.htm#fr_226) *Abba Saul*. Of the
third generation of mishna teachers, c. 130-160 A.D.

<span id="fn_226"></span>[36:5](tbr33.htm#fr_227) *memories technica*.
Lit.: "sign."

<span id="fn_227"></span>[36:6](tbr33.htm#fr_228) Ps. 10<sup>17</sup>.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[36:7](tbr33.htm#fr_229) The section shows the
earnestness with which the great teacher prayed.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[36:8](tbr33.htm#fr_230) Dan. 6<sup>10</sup>.
The phrases in the case of Daniel, Hannah, David, Solomon are literally
"in Daniel," etc., and possibly are of the same type as on [p.
79](tbr59.htm#page_79).

<span id="fn_230"></span>[37:1](tbr33.htm#fr_231) 1 Sam. 1<sup>13</sup>.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[37:2](tbr33.htm#fr_232) Ps. 55<sup>17</sup>.

<span id="fn_232"></span>[37:3](tbr33.htm#fr_233) 1 Kings
8<sup>28</sup>.

<span id="fn_233"></span>[37:4](tbr33.htm#fr_234) Ps. 33<sup>1</sup>.

<span id="fn_234"></span>[37:5](tbr33.htm#fr_235) "True and sure"
(*’Emeth wyatzib*), *cf*. [p. 7](tbr12.htm#page_7).

<span id="fn_235"></span>[37:6](tbr33.htm#fr_236) After the Prayer
(*Tephillah*) serious variations may begin, exclusive of minor
variations in the *Tephillah* itself.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[37:7](tbr33.htm#fr_237) *God*. Lit.: "the
Place."

<span id="fn_237"></span>[37:8](tbr33.htm#fr_238) 1 Kings
8<sup>44</sup>.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[37:9](tbr33.htm#fr_239) *their land*. Not
verbally in 1 Kings 8<sup>44</sup>.

<span id="fn_239"></span>[37:10](tbr33.htm#fr_240) Again, not verbally
correct.

<span id="fn_240"></span>[37:11](tbr33.htm#fr_241) *this place*. This
also is not verbally exact.

<span id="fn_241"></span>[38:1](tbr33.htm#fr_242) = the Place, and so,
often.

<span id="fn_242"></span>[38:2](tbr33.htm#fr_243) Ps. 130<sup>1</sup>.

<span id="fn_243"></span>[38:3](tbr33.htm#fr_244) On this section see
"*The Hebrew-Christian Messiah*," p. 237.

<span id="fn_244"></span>[38:4](tbr33.htm#fr_245) *camp*. στρατεία.

<span id="fn_245"></span>[38:5](tbr33.htm#fr_246) *a seller of pots*
(*qaddar*). But Kahan's emendation in Laible to *qarrar*, or rather
*qârār* (waggoner) may be accepted.

<span id="fn_246"></span>[38:6](tbr33.htm#fr_247) *an* ‘arod. Usually a
wild ass, but here evidently a species of venomous snake. The story
comes also in T. J. V. 1. (p. 9<sup>a</sup>), but rather differently in
*T*. B. 33<sup>a</sup>.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[39:1](tbr33.htm#fr_248) *the prophets of old*.
Literally "the former prophets," but this technical term for the Books
of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings can hardly be intended here.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[39:2](tbr33.htm#fr_249) For the principle
compare the direction of the Massoretes to repeat Isa. 66<sup>23</sup>
after ver. 24.
