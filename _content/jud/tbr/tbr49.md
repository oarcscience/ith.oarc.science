#### Tidying the Room.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII I. 3 (4). The School of Shammai
say: They tidy the room and afterwards wash their hands. But the School
of Hillel say: They wash their hands and afterwards tidy the room. <span

**T**. VI. 4. The School of Shammai say: They put the room tidy to
prevent spoiling the food, and afterwards they wash their hands. And the
School of Hillel say: If the attendant is skilled in the Law he gathers
up the pieces which are as large as an olive, \[and\] they wash their
hands. And after that they put the room tidy.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_408"></span>[67:2](tbr49.htm#fr_409) The point is, that in
sweeping up the crumbs perhaps a piece of food as large as an olive may
be found among them, which would have been rendered unclean by water
having been spilt on it. Hence the order according to the School of
Shammai. But the, School of Hillel argues that to proceed on the
supposition that so large a piece will be found on the floor implies
that the attendant is an *‘am ha’aretz*, who ought not to be so
employed. The *Halaka*, however, follows the School of Shammai, thus
permitting the use of an attendant who is an *‘am ha’aretz*.
