### CHAPTER XI.

1\. These are to be strangled,—he who beats his father or his mother,
and he who steals a soul from Israel, and an "elder" who is rebellious
against the judges, and a false prophet, and he who prophesies in the
name of idolatry, and false witnesses proved to be perjured against a
priest's daughter and her paramour. He who beats father or mother is not
guilty till he make a bruise in them. It is more grievous to curse them
than to beat them. Because if he cursed them after their death, he is
guilty; but if he beat them after their death, he is free. He who stole
a soul from Israel is not guilty till he bring him on his property. R.
Judah said, "till he bring him on his property and obtain service by
him," as is said, "And maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him." <span
id="fr_431"></span>[2](#fn_425) "If he steal his own son?" R. Ishmael,
the son of R. Jochanan, the son of Beroka, pronounces him

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "guilty," but the
Sages pronounce him "free." "If he stole one, half a servant and half
free?" R. Judah pronounces him "guilty," but the Sages pronounce him
"free."

2\. The elder rebellious against the decision of the judges? as it is
said, "If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment," <span
id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_426) etc. There were three places of
judgment. One place was by the door of the Mountain of the House; and
one was by the door of the court; and one was in the chamber of hewn
stone. The witnesses against the rebellious elder came to the one by the
door of the Mountain of the House, and each one said, "so I expounded,
and so my companions expounded; so I taught, and so my companions
taught." If the judges listened to them, they told them: but if not,
they went to those at the door of the court, and each one said, "so I
expounded, and so my companions expounded; so I taught, and so my
companions taught." If they listened to them, they told them; but if
not, both parties went to the supreme court in the chamber of hewn
stone, because from it the Law proceeded forth to all Israel, as is
said, "Of that place which the Lord shall choose." <span
id="fr_433"></span>[2](#fn_427) "If the rebellious elder returned to his
city, and taught as before?" "He is free." "But if he decided to
practise false teaching?" He is guilty, as is said, "And the man that
will do presumptuously." <span id="fr_434"></span>[3](#fn_428) He is not
guilty till he decide to practise his false teaching. A disciple who
decided to practise false teaching is free. It follows that what is a
grave offence in the one is a light offence in the other.

3\. The burden in the words of the scribes is greater than the burden in
the words of the law. He who said, "There are no phylacteries, so as to
transgress the words of the law?" "He is free." He who said, "*There
are* five frontlets, so as to add to the words of the scribes?" "He is
guilty."

4\. “The judges do not put such an offender to death in the tribunal of
his city, nor in the tribunal of Jabneh, <span
id="fr_435"></span>[4](#fn_429) but they bring him up to the supreme
court in Jerusalem, and they guard him till a holiday; and they put him
to death on a holiday, as is said, “And all the people shall hear and
fear,

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

and do no more presumptuously.” <span id="fr_436"></span>[1](#fn_430)
The words of R. Akiba. R. Judah said, "they do not cause him anguish in
delaying his judgment, but they execute him off-hand." And they write
and send messengers to all places, "Such a man, the son of such a man,
is condemned to death by the tribunal."

5\. A false prophet, who prophesied what he did not hear, and what was
not told to him, is put to death by the hands of man. But he who
suppressed his prophecy, and he who added to the words of a prophet, and
a prophet who transgressed his own words, is put to, death by the
visitation of heaven, as is said, "I will require it of him." <span
id="fr_437"></span>[2](#fn_431)

6\. And he who prophesied in the name of idolatry and said, "so the idol
said," even though its decision was exactly to pronounce unclean the
unclean, and to pronounce cleansed the clean, is to be strangled. And so
also the false witnesses against a priest's daughter. Because all false
witnesses are condemned to the same death which they had intended (for
the accused), except false witnesses against the daughter of a priest,
and they are to be strangled.
