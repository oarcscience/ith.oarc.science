### CHAPTER IV.

1\. "With what may they cover up (pots to retain the heat)?" "And with
what may they not cover them up?" "They may not cover them up with
oil-dregs, or dung, or salt, or lime, or sand either fresh or dry, or
straw, or grape-skins, or woollen, or herbs when they are fresh, but
they may cover up with them when they are dry. They may cover up with
garments, and fruits, with doves’ wings, with carpenters’ sawdust, and
with tow of fine flax." Rabbi Judah forbids "fine," but allows "coarse."

2\. They may cover up with hides, and remove them,—with woollen fleeces,
but they must not remove them. "How does one do?" "He takes off the
cover, and they fall down." Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Azariah, says "the
vessel is inclined on its side, and he takes them away." "Perhaps he
took them away and cannot return them?" <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_99) But the Sages say "he may take them away,
and return them." "He does not cover it, while it is yet day?" "He must
not cover it, when it begins to be dark." "He covered it, and it
opened?" "It is allowed to cover it again." A man may fill the goblet,
and put it under the pillow or under the bolster (to warm it).
