<p>1. These are the controversies relating to meals between the schools of Shammai and Hillel. The school of Shammai say, "one must say the blessing of the day, and then bless the wine;" but the school of Hillel say, "one must say the blessing on the wine, and then bless the day."</p>  
<p>2. The school of Shammai say, "men must pour water on the hands, and then mix the goblet;" but the school of Hillel say, "the goblet must be mixed, and then water poured on the hands."</p>  
<p>3. The school of Shammai say, "one is to wipe his hands on the napkin, and lay it on the table;" but the school of Hillel say, "on the cushion."</p>

The school of Shammai say, "who created the light of fire;" but the school of Hillel say, "Creator of the lights of fire."</p>

<p>8. "If wine came to the company, and there is but one goblet?" The school of Shammai say "that one must bless the wine and then bless the food." But the school of Hillel say "that one must bless the food and then bless the wine. Men must answer "Amen" when an Israelite blesses; but they must not answer "Amen" when a Samaritan blesses, until the whole&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_31"></A><A HREF="bar020.htm#fn_31"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> blessing be heard.</p>
