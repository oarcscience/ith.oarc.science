The length of one curtain (shall be) thirty cubits."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And they were coupled in two vails, one of five, and one of six, as is said, "And thou shalt couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_714"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and they were coupled with fifty loops, as is said, "And he made fifty loops upon the outmost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_715"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> And the loops were coupled to fifty taches of brass, as is said, "And thou shalt make fifty taches of brass, and put the taches into the loops, and couple the tent together that it may be one."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_716"></A><A HREF="#fn_709"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> The length of the curtains was thirty cubits.
