### CHAPTER VII.

"How did Bezaleel make the ark?" “He made three boxes, two of gold and
one of wood. He put the wooden one inside the golden one, and the golden
one inside the wooden one, and covered the upper edge with gold; as is
said, “And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold: within and without
shalt thou overlay it.” <span id="fr_752"></span>[2](#fn_744) "And what
is the meaning of saying, 'thou shalt overlay it?'" "It means that he
covered the upper edges (with) gold." The golden mercy-seat was placed
above upon it; as is said, "And thou shalt put the mercy-seat above upon
the ark." <span id="fr_753"></span>[3](#fn_745) And four rings of gold
were fastened in it, two on the north and two on the south, and in them
the staves were put, and they were never moved from thence; as is said,
"The staves shall be in the rings of the ark; they shall not be taken
from it." <span id="fr_754"></span>[4](#fn_746) Even though Solomon made
the pattern of all the vessels, the pattern of the ark he did not make;
as is said, "And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up
the ark." <span id="fr_755"></span>[5](#fn_747) The ark was placed in
the midst of the House, and divided the House ten cubits by ten cubits.
And two cherubs of gold stood on their feet on the ground. From the wall
to the cherub there were five cubits, and from the cherub to the wall
five cubits. "Where is it mentioned, that as soon as the priests brought
in the ark the staves were drawn out, and they reached to the vail, and
they touched the entrance?" As is said, "And they drew out the staves,
that the ends of the staves were seen out in the holy place before the
oracle." <span id="fr_756"></span>[6](#fn_748) For that reason the doors
of the Holy of Holies were never closed. "And they were not seen
without." <span id="fr_757"></span>[7](#fn_749) “It is not possible to
say that they were not seen, since it was already said “they were seen.”
Neither is it possible to say that

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

they were seen, since it is already said "they were not seen." "How is
it?" "They were pushing out in the vail, and were seen in the
[sanctuary](errata.htm#11) like the two paps of a woman." "And from
whence (do we know) that they were drawn out from the inside?" As is
said, "And they were not seen without." There we learned that they were
drawn out from the inside. And from thence (we learned) that they were
drawn out to the outside, as is said, "And the ends of the staves were
seen." And where thou sayest that as the staves were drawn out, so were
drawn out the wings of the cherubim, and they covered the ark, and
overshadowed the house from above, as is said, "And the
[cherubim](errata.htm#12) covered the ark and the staves thereof,
above." <span id="fr_758"></span>[1](#fn_750) "And where was the ark
concealed?" Rabbi Judah, the son of Lachish, said, "in its place in the
house of the Holy of Holies, as is said, 'And there they are unto this
day.'" <span id="fr_759"></span>[2](#fn_751) But the Sages say, "in the
chamber of the wood." "And who concealed it?" Rabbi Judah the Holy said,
"Josiah concealed it, as it is said; 'And said unto the Levites that
taught all Israel, which were holy unto the Lord, Put the holy ark in
the house which Solomon the son of David, King of Israel, did build; it
shall not be a burden upon your shoulders.'" <span
id="fr_760"></span>[3](#fn_752) He said to them, "it shall not be
carried captive with you to Babylon, that you should bear it upon your
shoulders." Rabbi Eleazar said, "it went to Babylon, as is said,
'Nothing shall be left, saith the Lord,' <span
id="fr_761"></span>[4](#fn_753) nothing, not even the words in it." The
house of the Holy of Holies, which Solomon made for it, had a wall,
entrance, and doors, as is said, "And the temple and the sanctuary had
two doors." <span id="fr_762"></span>[5](#fn_754) But in the latter
house there was no wall, only two boards were there, and the length of
each one was a cubit and a half. And two vails of gold were there,
spread over them from above, and it was called the place of
Partition. <span id="fr_763"></span>[6](#fn_755)
