<p>When Israel was to encamp, the pillar of cloud rose up and spread out over the children of Judah like a kind of booth, and it covered the tent outwards, and filled the tabernacle inwards; as is said, "Then a cloud covered the</p>  
<p><a name="page_357"><font size="1" color="green">p. 357</font></A></p>  
<p>tent of the congregation, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_820"></A><A HREF="#fn_812"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> And that was one of the clouds of glory, which served the Israelites in the wilderness forty years. One on the right hand, and one on the left, and one before them, and one behind them. And one over them, and a cloud dwelling in their midst (and the cloud, the SHECHINAH which was in the Tent), and the pillar of cloud which moved before them, making low before them the high (places), and making high before them the low (places), and killing serpents and scorpions, and burning thorns and briers, and guiding them in the straight way. Rabbi Simon, the son of Jos&eacute;, said, "during the forty years, when the Israelites were in the wilderness, none of them had need of the light of the sun by day, nor the light of the moon by night. When it became reddish they knew that the sun had set, and when it became whitish they knew that the sun rose. And when one looked into a barrel, he knew what was in it; and into a pitcher, and he knew what was in it, by reason of the cloud, the SHECHINAH in their midst," as is said, "For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel throughout all their journey."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_821"></A><A HREF="#fn_813"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And so it is prepared to come in the future: as is said, "Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee." "The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the Lord shall be unto thee an everlasting light." "Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw itself; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be ended."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_822"></A><A HREF="#fn_814"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "From whence did the SHECHINAH speak with Moses?" &#147;Rabbi Nathan said, &#147;from the altar of incense,&#148; as is said, "And thou shalt put it before the vail that is by the ark of the testimony, etc.</p>

<p>The disciples of Rabbi Ishmael said, "beside the altar of burnt-offering," as is said, "This shall be a continual burnt-offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, before the Lord,</p>
