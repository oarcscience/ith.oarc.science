### CHAPTER III.

1\. These cause transgression during passover: the Babylonian
cuthack, <span id="fr_130"></span>[2](#fn_127) and the Median beer, and
the Edomite vinegar, and the Egyptian zithum, <span
id="fr_131"></span>[3](#fn_128) and the purifying dough

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

of the dyer, <span id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_129) and the clarifying
grain of the cooks, and the paste of the bookbinders. Rabbi Eleazar
said, "even the cosmetics of women." This is the rule. All kinds of
grain whatever may cause transgression during the passover. These are
negative commands, and they are not visited by cutting off.

2\. "Dough in a split of a kneading trough?" "If there be the size of an
olive in a single place one is bound to clear it out." Less than this is
worthless from its minuteness. And so is it with the question of
uncleanness. Particularity causes division. "But if one wish it to
remain?" "It is reckoned as the trough." "Dough dried up?" <span
id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_130) "If it be like that which can become
leavened it is forbidden."

3\. "How do persons separate the dough-offering when it becomes unclean
on a holiday?" Rabbi Eleazar said, "you cannot call it a dough-offering
till it be baked." Rabbi Judah, the son of Bethira, said, "you must put
it in cold water." Said R. Joshua, "it is not leaven so as to transgress
the negative command 'It shall not be seen nor found,' <span
id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_131) but it must be separated and left till
the evening. But if it become leavened it is leavened."

4\. Rabban Gamaliel said, "three women may knead at once, and bake in
one oven, each after the other." But the Sages say, "three women may be
busied with the dough, one kneads, and one prepares, and one bakes."
Rabbi Akiba said, "all women, and all wood, and all ovens, are not
alike." This is the rule. "If it ferment it must be smoothed down with
cold water."

5\. Dough which begins to leaven must be burned, but he who eats it is
free. When it begins to crack it must be burned, and he who eats it must
be cut off. "What is leavening?" "Like the horns of locusts."
"Cracking?" "When the cracks intermingle." The words of R. Judah. But
the Sages say, "if either of them be eaten, the eater must be cut off."
"And what is leavening?" "All which

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

changed its appearance, as when a man's hairs stand on end through
fright."

6\. "If the fourteenth day of Nisan happened on the Sabbath?" "They must
clear off all the leaven before the Sabbath begins." The words of R.
Meier. But the Sages say, "in the proper season." Rabbi Eleazar, the son
of Zaduk, said, "the heave-offering before the Sabbath, and ordinary
things in the proper season."

7\. "If one went to kill his passover, or circumcise his son, or to eat
the marriage-feast in the house of his father-in-law, and he remembered
that there was leaven in his house?" "If he can he must return and clear
it out, and return to his duties. He must return and clear it away. But
if not, he can esteem it as nothing in his heart." "(If one went) to
save a person from the militia, or from a river, or from robbers, or
from burning, or from the fall of buildings?" "He may esteem it as
nothing in his heart." "But if he is reposing at his ease?" "He must
return off-hand."

8\. And so also when one went forth from Jerusalem and remembered that
he had holy flesh in his hand. If he passed Zophim <span
id="fr_135"></span>[1](#fn_132) he must burn it on the spot. But if not
he must return and burn it in front of the temple with the wood of the
altar. "And for how much flesh or leaven must men return?" Rabbi Meier
said, "both of them the size of an egg." Rabbi Judah said, "both the
size of an olive." But the Sages say, "Holy flesh the size of an olive,
and leaven the size of an egg."
