### CHAPTER VIII.

THE TABLE which Moses made in the wilderness was in length two cubits,
and its breadth one cubit, and its height was one cubit and a half, as
is said, "Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood, two cubits shall
be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and
a half the height thereof." <span id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_756) Rabbi
Judah said, "the cubit (contained) five handbreadths, thus there are ten
handbreadths." From thence the Sages said, "the table was in length ten
handbreadths, and in breadth five handbreadths. And the shew-bread was
in length ten handbreadths, and in breadth five. The length of the
shew-bread was placed against the breadth of the table. It extended over
two handbreadths and a half on either side. It follows that its length
quite filled the breadth of the table." Rabbi Meier said, "the table was
in length twelve handbreadths, and in breadth six handbreadths. And the
shew-bread was in length ten (handbreadths), and in breadth five. And
its length was placed against the breadth of the table. It extended over
two handbreadths on either side; and there was an opening of two
handbreadths in the middle, that the air might blow through them (the
loaves)." Aba Shaul said, "they put there two cups of incense of the
shew-bread." The Sages said to him, "and is it not already said, 'And
thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row.'" <span
id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_757) He replied to them, "and is it not
already said, 'And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh?'" <span
id="fr_766"></span>[3](#fn_758) Although Solomon made ten tables, and
all of them were lawful for service, as is said, "He made also ten
tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the right side, and five
on the left." <span id="fr_767"></span>[4](#fn_759) "If thou sayest five
on the south, and five on the north, is not a table on the south
worthless?" But what is the meaning of saying, "five on the right and
five on the left?" "Five to the right of the table

of Moses, and five to the left of the table of Moses, even though he did
not arrange the shew-bread, save for the table of Moses only, as is
said, 'And the table whereupon the shew-bread was.'" <span
id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_760) Rabbi José, the son of Rabbi Judah,
said, "all the tables were arranged for shew-bread as is said, 'And the
tables whereon the shew-bread was set.'" <span
