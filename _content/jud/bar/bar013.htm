<p>1. "If one who is reading in the Law when the time comes for praying intends it in his heart?" "He is free." "But if not?" "He is not free." "At the end of the sections one salutes out of respect, and responds; but in the middle of a section he salutes from fear, and responds." Such are the words of R. Mair. R. Judah says, "in the middle he salutes from fear, and responds out of respect; at the end he salutes out of respect, and repeats peace to every man."</p>  
<p>2. The intervals of the sections are between the first blessing and the second&#151;between the second and "Hear, O Israel;" between "Hear" and "it shall come to pass;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> between "and it shall come to pass" "and he said;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> between "and he said" and it is "true and certain."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> Said R. Judah, "between 'and he said and it is true and certain,' none is to pause." R. Joshua, the son of Korcha, said "Why does the (section) "Hear," etc., precede, "and it shall come to pass"? "That one may take on himself the kingdom of heaven, before he take on himself the yoke of the commandments." Why does (the section) and "it shall come to pass" precede "and he said"? "Because 'and it shall come to pass' may be practised by day and by night;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> but 'and he said,' etc., only by day."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>

<p>3. He who recites the Shemah so as not to be audible to his own ears, is legally free.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> R. Jos&eacute; says "he is not legally free." "If he has said it without grammar and pronunciation?" R. Jos&eacute; says "he is legally free." R. Judah says "he is not legally free." "If he said it irregularly?" "He is not legally free." "In recitation he mistook?" "He must recommence from the place where he mistook."</p>  
<p>4. Labourers may recite the Shemah on the top of a tree, or of a wall, but they are not allowed to do so with the prayer.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>5. A bridegroom is exempted from reciting the Shemah on the first night of marriage, and, even until the expiration of the Sabbath if the marriage be not complete. It happened that Rabban Gamaliel recited on the first night. His disciples said to him, "hast thou not taught us, our master, that a bridegroom is exempted from reciting Shemah on the first night?" He said to them, "I will not hear you, to deprive myself of the yoke of the kingdom of heaven even one hour."</p>  
<p>6. He (R. Gamaliel) bathed on the first night of his wife's death. His disciples said to him, "hast thou not taught us, our master, that a mourner is forbidden to bathe?" He said to them, "I am not like all other men; I am infirm."</p>  
<p>7. When his slave Tabbi died, he received visits of condolence. His disciples said to him, "hast thou not taught us, our master, that visits of condolence are not to be received for slaves?" He said to them, "my slave Tabbi was not like all other slaves, he was upright."</p>  
<p>8. The bridegroom who wishes to recite the Shemah on the first night may recite it. R. Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, said, "not every one who wishes to affect the pious reputation, can affect it"</p>
