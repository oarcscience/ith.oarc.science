### CHAPTER XII.

Moses made one LAVER, as is said, "Thou shalt also make a laver of
brass." <span id="fr_793"></span>[2](#fn_785) Solomon made ten lavers,
as is said, "He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand,
and five on the left, to wash." <span id="fr_794"></span>[3](#fn_786)
"There is no meaning in saying 'five on the right hand, and five on the
left,' and what is the meaning of saying 'five on the right hand, and
five on the left?'" "Five on the right of the laver of Moses, and five
on the left of the laver of Moses." Solomon added to it when he made the
sea, as is said, "And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim
to the other; it was round all about, and his height was five cubits;
and a line of thirty cubits did compass it round about. And it was an
handbreadth thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a
cup, with flowers of lilies, it contained two thousand baths." <span
id="fr_795"></span>[4](#fn_787) It is not possible to say "two
thousand," since before it is said "three thousand," <span
id="fr_796"></span>[5](#fn_788) and it is not possible to say "three
thousand," since before it is said "two thousand." "How can it be?" "Two
thousand liquid make three thousand dry measure." But you don't know how
much is the bath until it be said, "The ephah and the bath contain one
measure," <span id="fr_797"></span>[6](#fn_789) "for ten baths are an
homer." Allow ten baths for every cur—there are two hundred curs.
Subtract from them fifty curs, and allow fifty square, there are one
hundred and fifty cleansing pools; since every pool contains forty
seahs." "And from whence do we know that every pool contains forty
seahs?" "As is

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

said, 'And bathe his flesh in water,' <span
id="fr_798"></span>[1](#fn_790) water to cover all his flesh." "And how
much is it?" "A square cubit, in height three cubits." From thence the
Sages judged the measure of a pool to be forty seahs. "And how can it
contain one hundred and fifty cleansing-pools, if thou shalt say it was
all round?" "It could not contain them." "If thou shalt say it was all
square?" "It therefore contained more." But the three lowest cubits were
square; allow for ten cubits square, there are an hundred cubits. Allow
for an hundred square; there are an hundred cleansing-pools. The two
highest cubits were round. Allow for ten cubits square; there are
seventy-five cubits. Allow for seventy-five square; there are an hundred
and fifty. Allow for fifty square; there are fifty cleansing-pools;
since the square exceeds the round by a fourth. "And whence do we know
that the square exceeds the round by a fourth?" "As is said, 'Ten cubits
from brim to brim, round in compass, and a line of thirty cubits did
compass it round about.'" <span id="fr_799"></span>[2](#fn_791) This
teaches that the square exceeds the round by a fourth. "And whence do we
know that it was round above?" "As is said, 'And it was an handbreadth
thick, and the brim thereof was wrought like the brim of a cup.'" "And
whence know we that it was square below?" "As is said, 'It stood upon
twelve oxen, three looking towards the north, and three looking towards
the west, and three looking towards the south, and three looking towards
the east.'" <span id="fr_800"></span>[3](#fn_792) And what is meant by
saying "looking towards" four times; but that when one entered the
temple, he looked towards the right; when he entered into the court, he
looked towards the right; when he entered the Mountain of the House, he
looked towards the right; when the priest went up to the top of the
altar, he looked towards the right. "And under it was the similitude of
oxen, which did compass it round about, ten in a cubit, compassing the
sea round about. Two rows of oxen." <span
id="fr_801"></span>[4](#fn_793) It follows that (there were) four rows
of the heads of oxen, which served for the four sides, as is said, "And
the similitude of oxen, two rows of oxen were cast

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

when it was cast." <span id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_794) And it was all
cast even from the feet of the ox.
