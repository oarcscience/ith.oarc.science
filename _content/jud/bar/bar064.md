### CHAPTER III.

1\. “The Sanhedrin and all Israel saw (the new moon); the witnesses were
examined, but it became dark before they

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

could say, “Sanctified”? "The month is intercalary." "The Sanhedrin
alone saw it?" "Two members must stand up and testify before them, and
they shall say, 'Sanctified, sanctified.'" "Three composing a Sanhedrin
saw it?" "Two of them must stand up, and their assessors must be seated
with the single member, and before them they shall testify, and say,
'Sanctified, sanctified,' because an individual cannot be trusted by
himself alone."

2\. All cornets are allowed, except (horns) of a heifer, <span
id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_297) because it is (written) horn. <span
id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_298) Said Rabbi José, "are not all cornets
called horn? for it is said, 'When they shall make a long (blast) with
the ram's horn.'" <span id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_299)

3\. The cornet of the New Year was a straight horn of a wild goat; and
its mouthpiece was plated with gold. And the two trumpets <span
id="fr_304"></span>[4](#fn_300) were stationed on each side. The cornet,
prolonged its note when the trumpets ceased, because the obligation of
the day was for the cornet.

4\. On fast days (there were) crooked ram's horns; and their mouthpieces
were plated with silver. And the two trumpets were stationed in the
midst. The cornet ceased, and the trumpets prolonged their notes,
because the obligation of the day was for the trumpets.

5\. The jubilee is like the New Year for the sounding and the blessings.
R. Judah says, "on the New Year they sounded rams’ horns; and on the
jubilee wild goats’ horns."

6\. A cornet, which was rent and cemented, is disallowed. One cemented
from fragments of cornets is disallowed. "It had a hole, which was
closed?" "If it hinder the sound, it is disallowed; but if not, it is
allowed."

7\. "If one sound the cornet within a pit, a cistern, or in an
earthenware vessel, and one (outside) hears the sound of the cornet?"
"He is free." <span id="fr_305"></span>[5](#fn_301) "But if he hear the
echo of the sound?" "He is not free." And so, if one be passing behind a
synagogue, or his house adjoin the synagogue, and he hear the sound of
the cornet, or the reading of the roll of

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Esther, he is
legally free, provided he heard it with due attention; but if not, he is
not legally free. Although one hears as well as another; yet one hears
with hearty intention, and another without hearty intention.

8\. "And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand that Israel
prevailed," <span id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_302) etc. And how could the
hands of Moses make the battle, or crush the battle? But it is written
to tell thee that whilst Israel looked to Heaven for aid, and subjected
their hearts to their heavenly Father, they prevailed; and when they did
not do so, they were defeated. Like as He says, "Make thee a fiery
serpent, and set it upon a pole, and it shall come to pass that every
one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live." <span
id="fr_307"></span>[2](#fn_303) And how could the serpent kill, or make
alive? But when the Israelites looked to Heaven for aid, and subjected
their hearts to their heavenly Father, they were healed; and when they
did not do so, they perished. One deaf and dumb, or an idiot, or a
child, cannot, as proxies, free others from their obligations. This is
the rule—all who are not responsible for a thing, cannot free others
from their obligations.
