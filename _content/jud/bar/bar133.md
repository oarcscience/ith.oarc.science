### CHAPTER I.

1\. <span class="smallcaps">A Quarter</span> log <span
id="fr_666"></span>[1](#fn_659) of water is poured on the hands of one
person; also on the hands of two persons. Half a log on three or four.
From a log for five, ten, or even one hundred (persons.) R. José says,
"provided there be not less for the last than a quarter log." Men may
add (water) for the second washing, <span
id="fr_667"></span>[2](#fn_660) but they must not add it for the first.

2\. They may put water for hands in all vessels, even in vessels of
dung, or vessels of stone, or vessels of earth. But they must not pour
it on hands out of the (broken) sides of vessels, or the bottom of a
tub, or the bung of a cask. Nor may one give it to his neighbour out of
the hollow of his hand: because they must not draw or consecrate, or
sprinkle the water of purification, or put it on hands, except it be in
a vessel. They can only preserve vessels by the covering bound <span
id="fr_668"></span>[3](#fn_661) upon them. Nor can they preserve from

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

uncleanness water in open earthen vessels, <span
id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_662) only in (covered) vessels.

3\. Water which is unfit for animals to drink, is unfit (for washing) in
vessels; but on the ground it is fit. If ink, gum, or vitriol black drop
into it, and its colour be changed, it is unfit. If one made use of it,
or soaked his bread in it, it is unfit. Simeon the Temanite said, "even
if he intended to soak it in one vessel and it dropped into another, it
is fit."

4\. If one rinsed vessels in it, or rinsed out measures, it is unfit. If
one rinsed in it vessels already washed, or new ones, it is fit. R. José
"disallows it for new vessels."

5\. Water in which the baker has dipped rolls, is unfit; but if he only
dipped in his hands, it is fit. All are allowed to pour water on hands,
even one deaf, an idiot, or a minor. A man may rest a cask between his
knees and pour it. He may incline the barrel on its side and pour it. An
ape may pour water on hands. R. José "disallows these two cases."
