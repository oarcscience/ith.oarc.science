### CHAPTER II.

1\. Rabbi Eliezer said, "an heifer for a sin-offering is allowed even in
pregnancy." But the Sages disallow her.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> R. Eliezer said,
"she is not to be taken from foreigners." But the Sages allow her. And
not only she, but all the offerings of the congregation, and of the
individual, may come from the Land (of Israel), or from outside the
land, from the fresh harvest and from the old harvest, except the
omer, <span id="fr_629"></span>[1](#fn_622) and the two loaves, <span
id="fr_630"></span>[2](#fn_623) which may only come from the fresh
harvest, and from the Land.

2\. An heifer whose horns and hoofs are black should have them cut away.
The pupil of the eye, and the teeth, and the tongue, cause no blemish in
the heifer. If she be diminutive, she is allowed. "Had she a wen which
was cut away?" R. Judah "disallowed her." Rabbi Simon said, "every place
which was cut down, and no red hair sprang up in its place, renders her
blemished."

3\. An heifer produced from the side, or from the hire of immorality, or
exchanged for a dog, is disallowed. R. Eliezer allowed it, "as is said,
'Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a dog into
the house of the Lord thy God.' <span id="fr_631"></span>[3](#fn_624)
But she did not come into the house." All blemishes which are disallowed
in holy things are disallowed in the heifer. If one rode on her, or
leaned on her, or hung something on her tail, or crossed a river on her,
or doubled the rope over her, or put his garment on her, she is
disallowed. But if one bound her with a rope, or made a shoe to prevent
her slipping, or spread his garment over her because of the flies, she
is allowed. This is the rule. Everything which was necessary for her is
allowed. If there be any use of her for another's benefit, she is
disallowed.

4\. If a bird rested on her, she is allowed. If the male came to her,
she is disallowed. R. Judah said, "if he were

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

brought, she is disallowed, but if he came of himself, she is allowed."

5\. If she had two black or white hairs in one cavity, she is
disallowed. R. Judah said, "even in one pore." "If they be in two pores
and they prove united?" "She is disallowed." Rabbi Akiba said, "even
four or five, if they be scattered, may be plucked out." Rabbi Eleazar
said, "even fifty." R. Joshua, son of Bathira, said, "if there be even
one in her head, and one in her tail, she is disallowed." "If there be
two hairs, their roots black, and their tops red, their roots red and
their tops black?" "All follows after the appearance." The words of
Rabbi Meier. But the Sages say, "after the root."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_622"></span>[302:1](bar122.htm#fr_629) Lev. xxiii. 10, 17.
The omer or wave sheaf of barley was always cut on the evening of the
15th Nisan, even though it were a Sabbath. It must always have been
gathered from a fresh harvest cultivated even in the Sabbatical year.
The reapers asked these questions three times of those who were
witnesses, "Has the sun gone down?" "With this sickle?" "Into this
basket?" "on this Sabbath (first day of the Passover)?" "Shall I reap?"
After the witnesses answered these questions the sheaf was reaped. It
was finally ground into flour, and an handful of it mixed with
frankincense was burned on the altar. The remainder belonged to the
priests.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[302:2](bar122.htm#fr_630) Numb. xxviii. The
two wave loaves of wheaten flour were always offered on the Jewish
Pentecost.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[302:3](bar122.htm#fr_631) Deut. xxiii. 18.
