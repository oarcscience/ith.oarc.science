### CHAPTER III.

1\. "Whosoever puts his hands into a house smitten with leprosy?" "His
hands are unclean in a primary degree." <span
id="fr_672"></span>[2](#fn_665) The words of R. Akibah. But the Sages
say, "his hands are unclean in a secondary degree." <span
id="fr_673"></span>[3](#fn_666) "Whatever renders garments unclean at
the time of contact, renders hands unclean in a primary degree." The
words of R. Akibah. But the Sages say, "in a secondary degree." They
said to R. Akibah, "where do we find the hands (unclean) in a primary
degree?" "Everywhere," he said to them; "and how is it possible for them
to be unclean in a primary degree, unless his body is unclean, excepting
this." <span id="fr_674"></span>[4](#fn_667) "Victuals, and vessels
which are unclean through liquids render hands unclean in a secondary
degree." The words of R. Joshua. But the Sages say, "that which is
unclean through a source of uncleanness, <span
id="fr_675"></span>[5](#fn_668) renders the hands unclean; but derived
uncleanness <span id="fr_676"></span>[6](#fn_669) does not render the
hands unclean." Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, said, "it happened
that a woman came before my father. She said to him, 'my hands entered
into the hollow of an earthen vessel.' He said to her 'my daughter, from
what was its uncleanness?' But I did not hear what she said to him." The
Sages said, "the thing is clear, that which is unclean through a source
of uncleanness renders the hands unclean; but derived uncleanness does
not render the hands unclean."

2\. "Whatever disallows the heave-offering, renders the

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

hands unclean in a secondary degree. One hand can render the other hand
unclean." The words of R. Joshua. But the Sages say, "a secondary cannot
make a secondary." <span id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_670) He said to
them, "and are not Holy Scriptures secondaries, and they render the
hands unclean." They said to him, "we cannot judge the words of the Law
from the words of the scribes, nor the words of the scribes from the
words of the Law, nor the words of the scribes from other words of the
scribes."

3\. Straps of phylacteries with the phylacteries, render the hands
unclean. R. Simeon says, "the straps of phylacteries do not render the
hands unclean."

4\. The margin in a book of the Law, at the top and bottom, at the
beginning and end, renders the hands unclean. R. José says, "in the end
it does not render the hands unclean, until the roller be attached."

5\. A book of the Law which is erased, but in which there remain
eighty-five letters like the portion, "And it came to pass when the Ark
set forward," <span id="fr_678"></span>[2](#fn_671) renders the hands
unclean. Any roll in which there are written eighty-five letters like
the portion, "And it came to pass when the Ark set forward," renders the
hands unclean. All sacred Scriptures render the hands unclean. The
Canticles and Ecclesiastes render the hands unclean. R. Judah says,
"Canticles render the hands unclean, but Ecclesiastes is in dispute." R.
José says, "Ecclesiastes does not render the hands unclean, but the
Canticles are in dispute." R. Simeon says, "Ecclesiastes is one in which
the school of Shammai is less strict, and the school of Hillel more
rigid." R. Simeon, the son of Azai, said, "I received by tradition from
the mouths of the seventy-two elders, on the day they inducted R.
Eleazar, the son of Azariah, into the presidents’ seat, that Canticles
and Ecclesiastes render the hands unclean." R. Akivah said, "God forbid!
no man in Israel ever questioned that the Canticles render the hands
unclean, as the whole world is not equal to

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

the day on which the Canticles were given to Israel; for all the
Scriptures are holy, but the Canticles are Holy of Holies. They only
disputed in reference to Ecclesiastes." R. Jochanan, the son of Joshua,
the son of R. Akibah's father-in-law, said, "according to the words of
the son of Azai, thus they disputed, and thus they decided."
