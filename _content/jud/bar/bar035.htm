<p>with tails bound back, doubled down, or put in a bag. The goats go forth bound tightly. Rabbi Jos&eacute; "forbids all, excepting ewes, to have their tails in a bag." Rabbi Judah says "the goats go forth bound tightly to dry up their udders, but not to guard the milk."</p>  
<p>3. "And with what must they not go forth?" "A camel must not go forth with a rag bound as a mark to its tail, nor fettered, nor with fore-foot tied doubled up, and so with the rest of all beasts; a man must not bind camels one to another, and lead them, but he may take their ropes into his hand, and hold them, guarding that they be not twisted.<font size="-1" color="green">"</font>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. One must not bring forth an ass with a pack-saddle, when it is not tied upon him <i>before the Sabbath;</i> nor with a bell, even though it be muffled, nor with a ladder&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> on its throat, nor with a strap on its leg; nor may cocks and hens be led forth with twine or straps on their legs. Nor may rams be led forth with a gocart under their tails, nor ewes with John wood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_106"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> And the calf must not be led forth with a muzzle, nor a cow with the skin of the hedgehog,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_107"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> nor with a strap between her horns. The cow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_108"></A><A HREF="#fn_106"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of Rabbi Eleazar, the son of Azariah, used to go out with a strap between her horns, but not with the will of the Sages.</p>
