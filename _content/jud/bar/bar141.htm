<p>The court of the tabernacle was in length one hundred cubits, and in breadth fifty cubits, as is said, "And thou shalt make the court of the tabernacle for the south side, etc., an hundred cubits,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_730"></A><A HREF="#fn_723"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and likewise for the north side an hundred cubits," as is said, "And likewise for the north side in length there shall be hangings of an hundred cubits long."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_724"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> And on the west fifty cubits, as is said, "On the west side shall be hangings of fifty cubits."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="#fn_725"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> And on the east fifty cubits, as is said, "On the east side eastward <i>shall be</i> fifty cubits."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_733"></A><A HREF="#fn_726"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Take front them fifty cubits for hangings, as is said, "The hangings of one side of the gate shall be fifteen cubits,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_734"></A><A HREF="#fn_727"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> etc. "And for the other side," etc. From both sides the hangings on the south to the tent were twenty cubits, and the tent</p>

<p>was ten cubits broad, and from the tent to the hangings on the north were twenty cubits. This teaches that the breadth (of the court) was fifty cubits. From the hangings on the west to the tent were twenty cubits, and the tent was thirty cubits long; and from the tent to the hangings on the east, there were fifty cubits. This teaches that its length was an hundred cubits, as is said, "The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth fifty everywhere."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_735"></A><A HREF="#fn_728"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Rabbi Jos&eacute; said there is no meaning in saying "fifty everywhere," and what is meant by saying "fifty everywhere?" "That is in front of the tent." This teaches that its length was one hundred cubits, and its breadth fifty cubits. But you could not know the breadth of the hangings till you know the height of the court, as he (Moses) said, "And the height five cubits;"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_736"></A><A HREF="#fn_728"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as the height was five cubits, so was the breadth five cubits. "How was the court set up?" Twenty sockets of brass were put on the north side, and twenty on the south side, and there was a pillar in every one of them. And there were beams, and a ring was fastened in their middle, and the beams were fastened with ropes and pillars; and the length of every beam was six handbreadths, and its breadth was three (handbreadths). And the ring was hung on the hook in the pillar; and the hanging was rolled on it like the sail of a ship. It follows that the hanging extended from the pillar two cubits and a half on one side, and two cubits and a half on the other side; and so with the second pillar. This teaches that between each pillar there were five cubits. The beams were coupled with ropes and pillars, and they were coupled in the pins of brass; and as there were pins to the tabernacle, so were there pins to the court, as is said, "All the vessels of the tabernacle in all the service thereof, and all the pins thereof, and all the pins of the court, shall be of brass."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_737"></A><A HREF="#fn_729"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> But you could not know how much space there was front the hangings to the entrance of the court, till he said, "And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_738"></A><A HREF="#fn_730"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> As between the tabernacle</p>

<p>and the altar there were ten cubits, so from the hangings to the entrance of the court there were ten cubits. But you could not know how high was the entrance of the court, till he said, "And for the gate of the court shall be an hanging of twenty cubits," in length and height. In breadth it was five cubits. "There was no meaning in saying five cubits, and what is the meaning of saying five cubits?" "To instruct thee that its length was ten cubits, and its breadth five cubits." As was the entrance of the tent, so was the entrance of the court. As was the entrance of the court, so was the entrance of the sanctuary. As was the height of the entrance of the sanctuary, so was the breadth of the entrance of the porch. "The length of the court shall be an hundred cubits, and the breadth of it fifty everywhere."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_739"></A><A HREF="#fn_731"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The oral law says, "Take fifty and surround them with fifty."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_740"></A><A HREF="#fn_732"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Hence said Rabbi Jos&eacute;, the son of Rabbi Judah,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_741"></A><A HREF="#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> "an enclosed space which can contain two seahs (of sown grain) as the court of the tabernacle, is lawful for carrying burdens on the Sabbath day."</p>
