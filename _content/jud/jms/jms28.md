Frazer, Golden Bough, 1900, I, 403-47. [Methuselah](errata.htm#2)
advised Lamech, father of Noah, to delay naming his son "because the
people of that generation were sorcerers, and they would have bewitched
him if they had known his name" (*Da‘at Zekenim* on Gen. 5:28).

opinion is inevitably implied in the practice; cf. *Ẓiyuni*, 22a: ‏ראה
כי אין טוב להשתמש בשמות ומכאן תבין גדול עונש המטריח את קונו‎. Even the
invocation of angels involves a measure of coercion

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

upon God, who is [ultimately](errata.htm#3) responsible for their
actions; cf. *Lebush* on *Oraḥ Ḥayim* 584:1: ‏סגולת ההשבעות האמיתיות כן
היא שהשם ית׳ יתן להם רשות לאותן מלאבים שיעשו דברי המשביעים בלא שום
זבות‎.

or another when writing them, or of substituting shorthand forms, grew
up at a very early time. Eighty-three written substitutes for the
Tetragrammaton have been listed. For fear of writing even the particle
rah proper names were abbreviated, so that Jehudah became Judah, the
final "h" of Elijah and Isaiah was dropped, the number 15 was written
‏ט״ו‎ instead of ‏ט״ה‎, etc. See Lauterbach, *Proc. Amer. Acad. for Jew.
Research*, 1931, 39-67; S. W. Baron, *A Social and Religious History of
the Jews*, N. Y. 1937, III, 48;—*Raziel*, 2a.

<span id="an_7_18">18</span>. The Aggadah has a few references to
invocation of the names of God: Moses killed the Egyptian (Ex. 2:11) by
merely speaking God's name; the name of God, engraved on Moses’ staff,
caused the sea to divide (Blau, 50, 60). The words *ehyeh asher ehyeh
yah YHVH ẓebaot amen amen selah, written on a staff*, caused a stormy
sea to subside (*B.B.* 73a).

On the meaning of the term ‏שם המפורש‎ concerning which there is
considerable difference of opinion, see Grünbaum, *Ges. Auf.*, 190 and
238 ff.; Blau, 125; Grunwald, *MGJV*, V, 35 and X, 95; *JE*, XI, 262
ff.; L. Geiger, *Kebuẓat Maamarim*, ed. Poznanski, Warsaw 1910, p. 98,
and Ginzberg's note, p. 394; H. H. Schaeder, *Esra der Schreiber*,
Tübingen 1930, 53 ff. This term was applied in post-Talmudic times not
alone to the Tetragrammaton, but also to the longer names; cf. Hai Gaon
in Ashkenazi,

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

loc. cit.; Rashi, San 60a, *Suk.* 45a, *Erub.* 18b, etc. *Raziel*, 7a,
has a *shem hameforash* which altogether defies classification.

<span id="an_7_22">22</span>. The 12-letter name is mentioned once, in
*Kid.* 71 a, which also speaks of the name of 42 letters. The only other
reference to this latter name in Talmudic literature is in *Lekaḥ Tov*
to Ex. 3:15, p. 10a, ed. Buber. The name of 72 letters (or elements) is
not mentioned in the Talmud, but does occur in one frequently repeated
passage of the Midrash: *Gen. R.* 44: 19, Lev. R. 23, beg., *Nu. R.*
1:11, etc.: ‏ששמו של הקב״ה שבעים ושתים אותיות‎ *Cant. R.* to 2:2 has:
‏ששמו של הקב״ה ע״ב שמות הן‎. Blau, 137 if., suggests that the oldest
mystical name is that of 12 letters; 42 and 72 developed out of it
later. The name of 72 was known, at the latest, by the first half of the
third century. The Talmudic literature, however, gives us no information
about these names, what they were, what were their component elements,
or how they were constructed.

<span id="an_7_23">23</span>. This, in addition to the 4-, 12-, 42-, and
72-letter names, constitutes the list given in the ms. *S. Gematriaot*,
72b ff.

<span id="an_7_24">24</span>. See, *e.g.*, *Raziel*, 24b ff.; Jellinek,
40-41.

<span id="an_7_25">25</span>. *Raziel*, Sob.

<span id="an_7_26">26</span>. *Pesikta R.* ch. 21 (ed. Friedmann, 104a);
see also Ginzberg, *Legends*, V, 5, n. 10. There were several theories
as to just which name of God was responsible for the creation of the
universe. The one most often advanced is that it was the Tetragrammaton
alone, or in conjunction with the particle *yah*, that did the job. See
Eleazar of Worms, *Commentary on S. Yeẓirah*, 1c; Jellinek, 33;
Grunwald, *JJV*, I, 388, n. 4. *Raziel*, 12b, offers an interesting and
original hypothesis: God had 73 of His names inscribed at His right hand
when He was about to commence the work of creation. Out of the first
name there came forth three drops of water which filled the universe;
the second provided light; the third, fire; and so forth. When His task
was completed He set the name of 42 to keep the celestial waters apart
from the terrestrial; it was the removal of this name that caused the
flood (p. 14a).

<span id="an_7_27">27</span>. Cf. Thorndike, II, 407.

<span id="an_7_28">28</span>. These particles were very popular. *Pes.
R.*, loc. cit.: ‏אפילו אות אחת משמו עושה צבא ככל שמו‎; Blau, 102 f.;
Wohlstein, 30; Montgomery, 60; Jellinek, 33; Grunwald, *MJV*, XIX
(1906), 112; etc.

<span id="an_7_29">29</span>. *Ẓiyuni* 11 a, Sob; see also *Raziel*,
24a-b, 33b.

<span id="an_7_30">30</span>. An effort has been made by some scholars
to reconstruct the three names known in Talmudic times, those of 12, 42
and 72, on the assumption that they were not the same as those employed
in later times. Bacher (*Agada der babylonischen Amoräer*, 17-20)
suggests that the 12-letter name was based on the three creative
potencies ‏חכמה תבונה דעת‎; and the 42 on the full ten: ‏הכמה תבונה דעת
כח גבורה גערה צדק משפט חסד רחמים‎ with the addition of the
Tetragrammaton. Franck (Kabbalah, 71) derives the name of 42 from the
ten *Sefirot* (cf. also Bischoff, 35 ff., 107 ff.), which, as Ginsburg
(Kabbalah, 183) points out, is an obvious anachronism. Robert Eisler
(*REJ*, LXXXII \[1926\], 157-9) bases the names of 42 and 72 on the
thirteen *Middot* of Ex. 34:6-7. Blau (p. 144), on the analogy of the
Greek magical papyri, in which the seven Greek vowels play a great rôle,
works out a triangular anagram which, beginning with one *YHVH* builds
up by the addition of one letter at a time to three—this, he maintains,
contains the 4-letter name in the first line, the 12 in the last, the 42
in the last four, and the 72 in its totality. Finally, A. Haffer
(*HaẒofeh*, II \[1912\], 127 ff.) derives the 12-letter name from the
first three names of God that occur in the *Shema‘*, ‏אל אלהינו יהוה‎,
and to make up the 42-letter name he adds the final two words of the
*Shema‘* and the doxology ‏ברוך שם כבוד מלכותו לעולם ועד‎. The name of
72 he derives from Deut. 4:34. See also Schwab, *Vocabulaire*, 28 ff.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

These theories ring false, and certainly bear no relation to what was
considered a potent magic name in the post-Talmudic period; in any
event, such efforts are entirely a matter of conjecture and invention,
which can in no way be substantiated from the available facts. It seems
to me that there is a strong probability that the names of 42 and 72
employed in the Middle Ages were the same as those in use during the
first few centuries of the Common Era. Hai Gaon (10th-11th century)
(*Ta‘am Zekenim*, 57) spoke of them in words which imply that they had
been well known for a long time, and the tenacity of traditional lore,
especially in a field such as that of mysticism and magic, in which
letter-perfection is one of the prime requisites, is a well-known
phenomenon.

<span id="img_29000"></span> ![](img/29000.jpg)

An incantation in a sixteenth-century manuscript employs "the 22-letter
name of the Priestly Benediction" to conjure a divinatory spirit
(Grunwald, *MJV*, XIX \[1906\], 106). By means of this name the dead
will be recalled from their graves at the resurrection; cf. Gaster,
*Studies and Texts*, III, 230; Gollancz, *Clavic. Sal.*, 42. The
"Jerusalem" type of amulet-*mezuzah* (see p. 150 above) includes both
benediction and name in a manner indicating their close relationship;
cf. Aptowitzer, *REJ*, LXV (1913), 59. An additional item of evidence is
provided by a late Italian ms. entitled *Sefer HaRazim* (Ms. D 146, J.
T. S. Library) which (p. 18a) combines the name and the blessing in an
amulet.

<span id="an_7_38">38</span>. *Pardes*, loc. cit.; cf. also Joel, *Allg.
Zeit. des Jud.*, XXXVIII (1874), 246, 351-2.

<span id="an_7_39">39</span>. *Ta‘am Zekenim*, 57; B. M. Lewin, *Otzar
HaGaonim*, IV (Jerusalem 1931), *Ḥagigah*, 20 f. In connection with this
name Maimonides launched a bitter denunciation of all these mystical
names of God (cf. More Neb. I, 61, 62) which aroused only the faintest
echo in Northern Europe.

<span id="an_7_40">40</span>. Cf. *Raziel*, 24b, 45a-b; Ms. *S.
Gematriaot*, 74b: ‏ומכל אות ואות של זה השם יוצא שם אחד והם מ״ב שמות‎.
There were other versions of the name

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

of 42, such as that which the *Zohar* constructed out of the ten divine
names mentioned in the Bible (see Ginsburg, *Kabbalah*, 186-7), and the
mnemotechnical signs for the ten plagues in the Passover *Haggadah*
which a sixteenth-century ms. designated as this name because their
numerical sum (by *mispar katan*) is 42 (Grunwald, *MJV*, XIX \[1906\],
p. 119; see also *JE*, IX, 164); but these were "sports" which never
challenged the position of the true name.

<span id="an_7_41">41</span>. See I. M. Casanowicz, *Jour. Amer. Or.
Soc.*, XXXVI (1917), 159. This prayer was made much of by the
Kabbalists, who also composed other such prayers containing this name in
acrostic; cf. Landshuth, p. xxv; *EJ*, II, 857.

<span id="an_7_42">42</span>. Cf. *Tos. Ḥag.* lib, s. v. ‏אין דורשין‎:
\[‏מ״ב‎ read\] ‏פי׳ ר״ת הוא שם ע״ב אותיות היוצא מבראשית ומפסוק של
אחריו‎. (See also Bacher, *REJ* XVIII \[1889\], 292-3, whose
interpretation of this statement is far wide of the mark.) *Raziel*,
24b: ‏זה השם . . . יוצא מן הפסוק הראשין שבתורה הנא מן ב׳ של בראשית עד ב׳
של בוהו‎; *Ẓiyuni*, wc: ‏פסיק בראשית לתיבות שש שש אותיות בשם של מ״ב‎;
Ms. *S. Gematriaot*, 74b: ‏שם בן מ״ב אותיות היוצא מפסיק בראשית עד ה׳ של
בוהו ולא תחשוב ה׳ אחרובה של היתה‎; I may add that while the other works
cited do not specify that the name of 42 to which they refer is the one
of which I have been speaking, *Raziel* makes it clear that this is so.
Cordovero (*Pardes*, 21:13, ed. Lemberg 1862, p. 112b) offers a complete
exposition, through alphabetical permutations, of the derivation of this
name from the opening verses of the Bible.

<span id="an_7_43">43</span>. P. 43a: ‏לא יובלו למעבד שום כשוף אלא על
ידי בלי ע״ב‎. Wohlstein, pp. 12 f., woefully misunderstood this passage
when he stopped at the word ‏בלי‎ and translated it literally as
"vessel," thus making the use of a vessel (he had in mind the many clay
vessels that have been found inscribed with Aramaic incantations)
obligatory upon the magician. The sentence quoted, and the context, make
it unmistakably clear that the "vessel" or "tool" referred to is the
name of 72.

exhaustive in this presentation of angelic and godly names, Hebraic and
foreign. The material is far too vast to permit of anything more than a
sampling here. Schwab has made the largest collection of such names, and
if his etymologies are as often as not dubious, he presents a good
survey of the entire field. The purpose of this discussion has been
solely to illustrate the type of material under consideration.
