<p><i>A Psalm of David</i>.&#8212;Lord, who shall abide in thy tent? Who shall dwell in thy holy mountain? He that walketh blamelessly and worketh righteousness, and speaketh truth in his heart. He that slandereth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his fellow, nor bringeth reproach upon his neighbor. In whose eyes a reprobate is despised; but he honoreth them that fear the Lord. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not. He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh a bribe against the innocent. He</p>  
<p><a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="green">p. 446</font></A></p>  
<p>that doeth these things shall never be moved.</p>  
<p align="center">Psalm ci. A Psalm of David.</p>  
<p>I will sing of lovingkindness and justice: unto thee, O Lord, will I sing praises. I will give heed to the way of integrity: O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house in the integrity of my heart. I will set no base thing before mine eyes: I hate licentious deeds; they shall not cleave unto me. A froward heart shall depart from me: I will know no evil thing. Whoso secretly slandereth his neighbor, him will I destroy: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will I not suffer. Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in the way of integrity, he shall minister unto me. He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that speaketh falsehood shall not abide before mine eyes. Morning by morning will I destroy all the wicked of the land: to cut off all the workers of iniquity from the city of the Lord.</p>

<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Beth</span>.</p>  
<p>Wherewith shall a young man keep his way pure? By taking heed thereto according to thy word. With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments. Thy word have I treasured up within mine heart, that I might not sin against thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord: teach me thy statutes. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth. I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches. I will meditate on thy precepts, and look towards thy paths. I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resh</span>.</p>  
<p>Consider mine affliction, and deliver me; for I do not forget thy Law. Plead thou my cause, and redeem me: quicken me according to thy promise. Salvation</p>  
<p><a name="page_447"><font size="1" color="green">p. 447</font></A></p>  
<p>is far from the wicked; for they seek not thy statutes. Great are thy tender mercies, O Lord: quicken me according to thy judgments. Many are my persecutors and mine adversaries; yet have I not swerved from thy testimonies. I beheld the treacherous dealers, and loathed them; because they observed not thy word. See how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O Lord, according to thy lovingkindness. The sum of thy word is truth: and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Caph</span>.</p>  
<p>My soul pineth for thy salvation: I hope for thy word. Mine eyes pine for thy promise, while I say, When wilt thou comfort me? For I am become like a wineskin in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes. How many are the days of thy servant? When wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me? The proud have digged pits for me, they who are not after thy Law. All thy commandments are faithfulness: they persecute me with falsehood; help thou me. They have almost made an end of me on earth; but I forsake not thy precepts. Quicken me according to thy lovingkindness; so shall I observe the testimony of thy mouth.</p>  
<p align="center"><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">He</span>.</p>  
<p>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy statutes; and I will keep it unto the end. Give me understanding. and I will keep thy Law; yea, I will observe it with my whole heart. Make me to tread the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight. Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness. Turn away mine eyes from looking at vanity, and quicken me in thy way. Confirm thy word unto thy servant, which leadeth unto the fear of thee. Turn away my reproach whereof I am afraid; for thy judgments are good. Behold, I long after thy precepts; quicken me in thy righteousness.</p>

<p>Sovereign of the universe! Look down from thy holy habitation, and in mercy and favor accept the prayer and supplication of thy children, who are assembled here to consecrate this dwelling, and to offer their thanksgiving unto thee for all the lovingkindness and truth thou hast shown unto them. We beseech thee, let not thy lovingkindness depart, nor the covenant of thy peace be removed from them. Shield this their abode that no evil befall it. May sickness and sorrow not come nigh unto it, nor the voice of lamentation be heard within its walls. Grant that the members of the household may dwell together in this their habitation in brotherhood and fellowship, that they may love and fear thee, and cleave unto thee, and may meditate in thy Law, and be faithful to its precepts.</p>  
<p>Vouchsafe thy blessings unto the master of this I house. Bless, O Lord, his substance, and accept the work of his hands. Keep him far from sin and transgression. Let thy grace be upon him, and establish thou the work of his hands. May thy lovingkindness be with her who looketh well to the ways of her household, and may she be mindful that the woman who feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Bestow upon their sons and daughters the spirit of wisdom and understanding. Lead them in the path of thy commandments, so that all who see them may acknowledge that they are an offspring blessed of the Lord, blessed with a knowledge of thy Law and with the fear of thee. Preserve them from all evil; preserve their lives. May thy gracious promise be realized in them, Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, blessed when thou goest out. And even as we have been permitted to consecrate this house, so grant that we may together witness the dedication of thy great and holy temple in Jerusalem, the city of our solemnities, speedily in our days. Amen.</p>
