<p align="center">Psalm i.</p>  
<p>Happy is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also doth not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper. The wicked are not so; but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous. For the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous, but the way of the wicked shall perish.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Psalm xv., <A HREF="spb47.htm#page_445">p. 445</A>; xvi. <A HREF="spb54.htm#page_460">p. 460</A>; xc. <A HREF="spb05.htm#page_26">p. 26</A></i>.</p>  
<p>As for man, his days are as grass; as the flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more. But the lovingkindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children. Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end. For at his death he shall carry nothing away; his glory shall not descend after him. Mark the innocent man, and behold the upright; for the latter end of that man is peace. The Lord setteth free the soul of his servants; and none that take refuge in him shall be condemned. How precious is thy lovingkindness, O God! and the children of men take refuge under the shadow of thy wings. They sate themselves with the fatness of thy house; and thou givest them to drink of the river of thy pleasures. He shall enter into peace; they shall rest on their beds&#8212;each one that walketh in his uprightness.</p>
