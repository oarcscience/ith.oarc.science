<p>Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>Great is the Lord, and exceedingly to be praised: and his greatness is unsearchable.</p>  
<p>One generation shall laud thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.</p>  
<p>On the majestic glory of thy splendor, and on thy marvellous deeds, will I meditate.</p>  
<p>And men shall speak of the might of thy awful acts; and I will recount thy greatness.</p>  
<p>They shall pour forth the fame of thy great goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness.</p>  
<p>The Lord is gracious and merciful; slow to anger and of great lovingkindness.</p>  
<p>The Lord is good to all; and his tender mercies are over all his works.</p>  
<p>All thy works shall give thanks unto thee, O Lord; and thy loving ones shall bless thee.</p>  
<p>They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power.</p>  
<p>To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the majestic glory of his kingdom.</p>  
<p>Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.</p>  
<p>The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.</p>  
<p>The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due season.</p>  
<p>Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest every living thing with favor.</p>

<p>The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and loving in all his works.</p>  
<p>The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.</p>  
<p>He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him; he also will hear their cry, and will save them.</p>  
<p>The Lord guardeth all them that love him; but all the wicked will he destroy.</p>  
<p>My mouth shall speak of the praise of the Lord; and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.</p>  
<p>But we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore. Praise ye the Lord.</p>

<p>It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else: in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart,</small></p>

<p><small>that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>  
<p>We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law, The Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.</small></p>

<p>May it be thy will, O Lord our God, and God of our fathers, speedily to send a perfect healing from heaven, a healing of soul and body unto the sick . . . among the other sick of Israel.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_11"></A><A HREF="spb12.htm#fr_13">117:*</A> <i>On the Fast of the Ninth of Ab the following is added:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>Comfort, O Lord our God, the mourners of Zion, and the mourners of Jerusalem, and the city <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="green">p. 118</font></A> that is in mourning, laid waste, despised and desolate; in mourning for that she is childless, laid waste as to her dwellings, despised in the downfall of her glory, and desolate through the loss of her inhabitants: she sitteth with her head covered like a barren woman who hath not borne. Legions have devoured her; worshippers of strange gods have possessed her: they have put thy people Israel to the sword, and in wilfulness have slain the loving ones of the Most High. Therefore let Zion weep bitterly, and Jerusalem give forth her voice. O my heart, my heart! how it grieveth for the slain! My bowels, my bowels! how they yearn for the slain! For thou, O Lord, didst consume her with fire; and with fire thou wilt in future restore her, as it is said, As for me, I will be unto her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about, and I will be a glory in the midst of her. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who comfortest Zion and rebuildest Jerusalem.</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_12"></A><A HREF="spb12.htm#fr_14">119:*</A> <i>On Fast Days the Congregation here say the following:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>Answer us, O Lord, answer us on this day of the fast of our humiliation, for we are in great trouble. Turn not to our wickedness; conceal not thy face from us, and hide not thyself from our supplication. Be near, we entreat thee, unto our cry; let thy lovingkindness be a comfort to us; even before we call unto thee answer us, according as it is said, And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer; while they &#8218;are yet speaking, I will hear; for thou, O Lord, art he who answereth in time of trouble, who delivereth and rescueth in all times of trouble and distress; </P>
