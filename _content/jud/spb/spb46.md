### MARRIAGE SERVICE

Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord; we bless you out of
the house of the Lord.

O come, let us worship and bow down; let us knee before the Lord our
Maker.

Serve the Lord with joy; come before him with exulting.

Psalm c., [p. 23](spb05.htm#page_23).

He who is mighty, blessed and great above all beings, may he bless the
bridegroom and the bride,

PRAYER OR ADDRESS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the
fruit of the vine.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning
forbidden marriages; who hast disallowed unto us those that are
betrothed, but hast sanctioned unto us such as are wedded to us by the
rite of the canopy and the sacred covenant of wedlock. Blessed art thou,
O Lord, who sanctifiest thy people Israel by the rite of the canopy and
the sacred covenant of wedlock.

*The Bridegroom places the ring upon the forefinger of the right hand of
the Bride, and says:—*

Behold, thou art consecrated unto me by this ring, according to the Law
of Moses and of Israel.

*The Hebrew Marriage Contract is read by the Celebrant, after which the
following Seven Benedictions are said:—*

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the
fruit of the vine.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast created
all things to thy glory.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Creator of man.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast made
man in thine image, after thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him, out
of his very self, a perpetual fabric. Blessed art thou, O Lord, Creator
of man.

May she who was barren (Zion) be exceeding glad and exult, when her
children are gathered within her in joy. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who
makest Zion joyful through her children.

O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old thou
didst gladden thy creature in the garden of Eden. Blessed art thou, O
Lord, who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast created
joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth and exultation, pleasure
and delight, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be
heard in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice
of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the
bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies, and of
youths from their feasts of song. Blessed ay thou, O Lord, who makest
the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.
