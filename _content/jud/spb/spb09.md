### PRAYER FOR SUSTENANCE.

My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth. Cast thy burden
upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. Mark the perfect man, and
behold the upright; for the latter end of that man is peace.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Trust in the Lord,
and do good; dwell in the land, and feed upon faithfulness. Behold, God
is my salvation; I will trust and will not be afraid: for Jah the Lord
is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation.—O Sovereign of
the universe, in thy holy words it is written, saying, He that trusteth
in the Lord, lovingkindness shall compass him, about; and it is written,
And thou givest life to them all. O Lord God of truth, vouchsafe
blessing and prosperity upon all the work of my hands, for I trust in
thee that thou wilt so bless me through my occupation and calling, that
I may be enabled to support myself and the members of my household with
ease and not with pain, by lawful and not by forbidden means, unto life
and peace. In me also let the scripture be fulfilled, Cast thy burden
upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee. Amen!
