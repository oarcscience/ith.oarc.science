<p align="center"><i>The Ark is opened and the following Hymn is chanted in alternate verses by the Reader and Congregation</i>.</p>  
<p>I will chant sweet hymns and compose songs; for my soul panteth after thee.</p>  
<p>My soul hath longed to be beneath the shadow of thy hand, to know all thy secret mysteries.</p>  
<p>Even whilst I speak of thy glory, my heart yearneth for thy love.</p>  
<p>Therefore will I speak glorious things of thee, and will honor thy name with songs of love.</p>  
<p>I will declare thy glory, though I have not seen thee; under images will I describe thee, though I have not known thee.</p>  
<p>By the hand of thy prophets, in the mystic utterance of thy servants, thou hast imaged forth the grandeur and the glory of thy majesty.</p>  
<p>Thy greatness and thy might they described in accordance with the power made manifest in thy acts.</p>  
<p>In images they told of thee, but not according to thine essence; they but likened thee in accordance with thy works.</p>  
<p>They figured thee in a multitude of visions; behold thou art One under all images.</p>  
<p>They saw in thee both age and youth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> the hair of thy head now grey as in old age, now black as in youth.</p>  
<p>Age in the day of judgment, and youth in the day of battle; as a man of war he striveth with his hands:</p>  
<p>He hath bound a helmet of victory upon his head; his right hand, and his holy arm, hath wrought victory for him:</p>  
<p>With dew of light his head is filled, and his locks with drops of the night.</p>  
<p>He shall be glorified by me for he delighteth in me; yea, he shall be to me a crown of beauty.</p>  
<p>His head is like fine, pure gold; upon his forehead is impressed the glory of his holy name.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="green">p. 247</font></A></p>  
<p>For grace and glory, beauty and splendor his people hath encircled him with a crown.</p>  
<p>The plaited hair of his head seemed as in the days of youth, his black locks were flowing in curls.</p>  
<p>The abode of righteousness&#8212;his glorious beauty&#8212;may he prefer it above his chiefest joy.</p>  
<p>May his treasured people be a crown in his hand, a royal diadem of glorious beauty.</p>  
<p>They were borne by him, he carried them; with a crown he adorned them; for that they were precious in his sight he honored them.</p>  
<p>His glory resteth upon me, and mine upon him; and he is nigh unto me, when I cry unto him.</p>  
<p>He is bright and ruddy in red apparel, when he cometh front treading the winepress in Edom.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The symbol of his all-embracing providence he showed to the meek Moses, when the similitude of the Lord was before his eyes.</p>  
<p>Taking pleasure in his people, he will glorify the meek; that, dwelling amid praises, he may be glorified by them.</p>  
<p>The sum of thy word is truth; O thou, who hast called every generation from the beginning, seek the people that seeketh thee.</p>  
<p>Accept, I beseech thee, the multitude of my songs, and let my joyous cry come near unto thee.</p>  
<p>Let my praise be a crown unto thy head, and my prayer be set forth before thee as incense.</p>  
<p>Let the song of the poor be precious in thy sight as the song that was sung at thy offerings.</p>  
<p>May my blessing rise to the bountiful God, who createth and produceth, who is just and mighty.</p>  
<p>And when I bless thee, incline thine head unto me, and take what I offer as though it were the choicest spices.</p>  
<p>May my meditation be pleasant unto thee, for my soul panteth after thee.</p>

<p align="center">Psalm xcii.</p>  
<p>A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath Day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: to declare thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, with an instrument of ten strings and with a harp, with thoughtful music upon the lyre. For thou, O Lord, hast made me rejoice through thy work: I will exult in the works of thy hands. How great are thy works, O Lord: the thoughts are very deep. A brutish man knoweth it not, neither doth a fool understand this: when the wicked sprang up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity flourished, it was that they might be destroyed for ever. But thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. But my horn hast thou exalted, like that of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies; mine ears have heard my desire of them that rose up against me, doers of evil. The righteous shall spring up like a palm-tree; he shall grow tall like a cedar in Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall blossom in the courts of our God. They shall still shoot forth in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to declare that the Lord is upright; he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>
