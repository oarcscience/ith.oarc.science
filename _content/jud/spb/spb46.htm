<p>Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord; we bless you out of the house of the Lord.</p>  
<p>O come, let us worship and bow down; let us knee before the Lord our Maker.</p>  
<p>Serve the Lord with joy; come before him with exulting.</p>

<p>He who is mighty, blessed and great above all beings, may he bless the bridegroom and the bride,</p>

<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the fruit of the vine.</p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and hast given us command concerning forbidden marriages; who hast disallowed unto us those that are betrothed, but hast sanctioned unto us such as are wedded to us by the rite of the canopy and the sacred covenant of wedlock. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest thy people Israel by the rite of the canopy and the sacred covenant of wedlock.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>The Bridegroom places the ring upon the forefinger of the right hand of the Bride, and says:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>Behold, thou art consecrated unto me by this ring, according to the Law of Moses and of Israel.</p>

<p><i>The Hebrew Marriage Contract is read by the Celebrant, after which the following Seven Benedictions are said:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the fruit of the vine.</p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast created all things to thy glory.</p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, Creator of man.</p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast made man in thine image, after thy likeness, and hast prepared unto him, out of his very self, a perpetual fabric. Blessed art thou, O Lord, Creator of man.</p>  
<p>May she who was barren (Zion) be exceeding glad and exult, when her children are gathered within her in joy. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest Zion joyful through her children.</p>  
<p>O make these loved companions greatly to rejoice, even as of old thou didst gladden thy creature in the garden of Eden. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest bridegroom and bride to rejoice.</p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast created joy and gladness, bridegroom and bride, mirth and exultation, pleasure and delight, love, brotherhood, peace and fellowship. Soon may there be heard in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy and gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the jubilant voice of bridegrooms from their canopies, and of youths from their feasts of song. Blessed ay thou, O Lord, who makest the bridegroom to rejoice with the bride.</p>
