<p>O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall declare thy praise.</p>  
<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, the Great, mighty and revered God, the most high God, who bestowest lovingkindnesses and possessest all things; who rememberest the pious deeds of their patriarchs, and in love wilt bring a redeemer to their children's children for thy name's sake.</p>  
<p>O King, Helper, Savior and Shield. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the Shield of Abraham.</p>  
<p><a name="page_326"><font size="1" color="green">p. 326</font></A></p>  
<p>Thou, O Lord, art mighty for ever, thou quickenest the dead, thou art mighty to save.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>From the Sabbath after the Eighth Day of Solemn Assembly until the First Day of Passover say:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>Thou causest the wind to blow and the rain to fall,</p>  
<p>Thou sustainest the living with lovingkindness, quickenest the dead with great mercy, supportest the falling, healest the sick, loosest the bound, and keepest thy faith to them that sleep in the dust. Who is like unto thee, Lord of mighty acts, and who resembleth thee, O King, who killest and quickenest, and causest salvation to spring forth?</p>  
<p>Yea, faithful art thou to quicken the dead. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who quickenest the dead. *</p>  
<p>Thou art holy, and thy name is holy, and holy beings praise thee daily. (Selah.) Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.</p>

<p>* <i>Reader</i>.&#8212;We will sanctify thy name in the world even as they sanctify, it in the highest heavens, as it is written by the hand of thy prophet:</p>

<p><i>Cong</i>.&#8212;Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.</p>  
<p><i>Reader</i>.&#8212;From thy place shine forth, O our King, and reign over us, for we wait for thee. When wilt thou reign in Zion? Speedily, even in our days, do thou dwell there, and for ever. Mayest thou be magnified and sanctified in the midst of Jerusalem thy city throughout all generations and to all eternity. O let our eyes behold thy kingdom, according to the word that was spoken in the songs of thy might by David, thy righteous anointed:</p>  
<p><i>Cong</i>.&#8212;The Lord shall reign for ever, thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the Lord.</p>  
<p><i>Reader</i>.&#8212;Unto all generations we will declare thy greatness, and to all eternity we will proclaim thy holiness, and thy praise, O our God, shall not depart from our mouth for ever, for thou art a great and holy God and King. Blessed art thou, O Lord, the holy God.</p>  
<p>Thou hast chosen us from all peoples; thou hast loved us and taken pleasure in us, and hast exalted us above all tongues; thou hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and brought us near unto thy service, O our King, and hast called us by thy great and holy name.</p>

<p align="center"><i>On Saturday Night add the following:&#8212;</i></p>  
<p>Thou, O Lord our God, hast made known unto us the judgments of thy righteousness; thou hast taught us to perform the statutes of thy will; thou hast given us, O Lord our God, righteous judgments, true laws, good statutes and commandments. Thou hast also caused us to inherit seasons of joy, appointed times of holiness, and feasts of free will gifts, and hast given us as an heritage the holiness of the Sabbath, the glory of the appointed time, and the celebration of the festival. Thou hast made a distinction, O Lord our God, between holy and profane, between light and darkness, between Israel and other nations, between the seventh day and the six working days; thou hast made a distinction between the holiness of the Sabbath and that of the festival, and hast hallowed the seventh day above the six working days: thou hast distinguished and sanctified thy people Israel by thy holiness.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>On Sabbath add the words in brackets</i>.</p>

<p>which are in thy charge, and for thy miracles, which are daily with us, and for thy wonders and thy benefits, which are wrought at all times, evening, morn and noon. O thou who art all-good, whose mercies fail not; thou, merciful Being, whose lovingkindnesses never cease, we have ever hoped in thee.</p>  
<p>For all these things thy name, O our King, shall be continually blessed and exalted for ever and ever.</p>

<p>Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace.</p>  
<p>O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand and answer me. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.</p>  
<p>May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.</p>
