### MORNING PRAYER FOR YOUNG CHILDREN.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who removest
sleep from mine eyes, and slumber from mine eyelids.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast given
us the Law of truth, and hast planted everlasting life in our midst.

Moses commanded us the Law as an inheritance of the congregation of
Jacob.

Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One, Blessed be His name,
whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever.

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all
thy soul, and with all thy might.

And these words which I command thee this day shall be upon thine heart:
and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk
of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the
way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt
bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets
between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the doorposts of thy
house and upon thy gates.

O my God, guard my tongue from evil, and my lips from speaking guile.

Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments.

Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable
before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.
