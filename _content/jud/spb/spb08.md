*The Standard Prayer Book*, tr. by Simeon Singer, \[1915\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Kaddish to be said after reading Lessons from the Works of the
Rabbis:—*

*Reader*.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name In the world which
he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom
during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the
house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

*Cong. and Reader*.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all
eternity.

*Reader*.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored;
magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though
he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations,
which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.

Unto Israel, and unto the Rabbis, and unto their disciples, and unto all
the disciples of their disciples, and unto all who engage in the study
of the Law, in this or in any other place, unto them and unto you be
abundant peace, grace, lovingkindness, mercy, long life, ample
sustenance and salvation from the Father who is in heaven, and say ye,
Amen.

*Cong*.—Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for
evermore.

*Reader*.—May there be abundant peace from heaven, and a happy life for
us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.

*Cong*.—My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.

*Reader*.—He who maketh peace in his high places, may he in his mercy
make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.
