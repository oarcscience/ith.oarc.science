### KIDDUSH FOR SABBATH EVENING.

*The following is said in the Home by the Master of the House, previous
to partaking of the Sabbath Meal:—*

<span class="small">And it was evening and it was morning—the sixth
day.</span>

And the heaven and the earth were finished and all their host. And on
the seventh day God had finished his work which he had made; and he
rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made. And God
blessed the seventh day, and he hallowed it, because he rested thereon
from all his work which God had created and made.

<span class="small">Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the
universe, who createst the fruit of the vine.</span>

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast
sanctified us by thy commandments and hast taken pleasure in us, and in
love and favor hast given us thy holy Sabbath as an inheritance, a
memorial of the creation—that day being also the first of the holy
convocations, in remembrance of the departure from Egypt. For thou hast
chosen us and sanctified us above all nations, and in love and favor
hast given us thy holy Sabbath as an inheritance. Blessed art thou, O
Lord, who hallowest the Sabbath.

<span class="small">Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the
universe, who bringest forth bread from the earth.</span>
