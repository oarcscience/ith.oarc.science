<p><i>Reader</i>.&#8212;Magnified and sanctified be his great name In the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your life and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.</p>

<p><i>Reader</i>.&#8212;Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored; magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.</p>  
<p>Unto Israel, and unto the Rabbis, and unto their disciples, and unto all the disciples of their disciples, and unto all who engage in the study of the Law, in this or in any other place, unto them and unto you be abundant peace, grace, lovingkindness, mercy, long life, ample sustenance and salvation from the Father who is in heaven, and say ye, Amen.</p>  
<p><i>Cong</i>.&#8212;Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore.</p>  
<p><i>Reader</i>.&#8212;May there be abundant peace from heaven, and a happy life for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.</p>  
<p><i>Cong</i>.&#8212;My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>  
<p><i>Reader</i>.&#8212;He who maketh peace in his high places, may he in his mercy make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.</p>
