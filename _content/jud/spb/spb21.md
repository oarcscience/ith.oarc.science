### KIDDUSH FOR SABBATH MORNING.

Exodus xxxi. 16, 17.

And the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the
Sabbath throughout their generations, for an everlasting covenant. It is
a sign between me and the children of Israel for ever, that in six days
the Lord made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day he
rested, and ceased from his work.

Exod. xx. 8–11.

Remember the sabbath day to [keep](errata.htm#4) it holy. Six days shalt
thou labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is a sabbath unto
the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son,
nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle,
nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six days the Lord made
heaven and earth, the sea and all that is therein, and rested on the
seventh day; wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who createst the
fruit of the vine.

Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who bringest
forth bread from the earth.
