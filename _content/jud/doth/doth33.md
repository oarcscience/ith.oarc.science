### <span class="smallcaps">Where Humility is Sin</span>

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> matters of religion, justice, and of
right and wrong, however, the meek will be high-spirited and fearless,
punishing the wicked without fear or favour. He will never behave
oppressively out of fear lest he might suffer oppression; but he will
rescue the oppressed and help to bring him out of the power of the
oppressor; and he will teach men to do right, and warn them against
evil, to the utmost of his power.
