<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Humility</span> is profitable to man in this world, because it makes him rejoice in his lot. For the whole</p>  
<p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></A></p>  
<p>world, and all it contains, is insufficient to satisfy the ambition of him into whom pride and a sense of greatness have entered, and he will look with contempt on whatever share of it falls to his lot; whereas, the humble man assigns no special rank to himself, but is content with whatever comes to him, and finds it sufficient. And this induces restfulness of soul, and minimises anxiety. He will eat what comes his way, and dress in the raiment that is readily found; and a small share of the world satisfies him.</p>  
<p>The humble also bear troubles with greater fortitude than do the proud.</p>
