*The Duties of the Heart*, by Rabbi Bachye, tr. by Edwin Collins,
\[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### <span class="smallcaps">The Charity of the Meek</span>

<span class="smallcaps">He</span> who is humble before God will not only
do good to all men, but he will speak kindly to them and of them, and
will never relate anything shameful about them, and will forgive them
for any shameful things they may say about him, even if they are not
worthy of such treatment. It is related of one of the Chassideem, that
once when he was taking a walk with his disciples, they passed the
carcass of a dog in an advanced stage of decomposition. His disciples
exclaimed: "Oh, how this carcass stinks!" He replied: "Oh, how white its
teeth are!" so as to counteract their remark.

If it be wrong to speak disparagingly of a dead dog, how much more so,
of a living man; and if it be a merit to praise a dead dog for the
whiteness of its teeth, how much more is it a duty to find out, and
praise, the least merit in an intellectual human being? But it was also
the intention of this pious man to teach his pupils to habituate
themselves to speaking favourably, and to the avoidance of evil
speaking. For that to which one accustoms the tongue becomes its natural
speech.
