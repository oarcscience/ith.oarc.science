<P>
This slim volume translates from the Rabbi Bachye,
who wrote one of the first systematic treatments of philosophical Ethics
in 12th century Spain.
This was during a period of Jewish intellectual cross-fertilization
with Islamic culture.
Although Bachye was an orthodox Rabbi, he treats Ethics
(the Duties of the Heart, in his words) as a universal science,
derived from first principles such as the belief in God.
This short book also runs very deep.

<P>
According to the introduction to this book, this was the first text to be
published in the <A HREF="../../woe/index">Wisdom of the East</A> series.
So if you collect these you might want to be on the watch for
copies of this specific volume.
The particular edition we ended up using is a second printing, but there is
no reason to suggest that it had any differences with the first edition.
