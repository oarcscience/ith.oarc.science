*The Duties of the Heart*, by Rabbi Bachye, tr. by Edwin Collins,
\[1909\], at Intangible Textual Heritage

### <span class="smallcaps">The Ethics of the Body and the Ethics of the Soul</span>

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> wisdom of the *Torah* <span
id="fr_3"></span>[\*](doth05.htm#fn_2) is divided into two parts:

I. The wisdom of the visible, that enables us to know the duties of the
body and its members; and these include not only all the practical
obligations

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

both of ethics and religion, but also all the physical obligations and
restraints of a good and moral life.

II\. The Duties of the Heart and Mind; duties that concern thought and
feeling, and whose fulfilment is entirely in the hidden depths of the
human heart and soul, and this is the wisdom of the invisible.

The duties of the heart and mind have all of them their roots in human
reason, and, like some corporeal duties, would be recognised as binding
even without revelation.
