<p>Said Rabbi Simeon: "In these words are involved and contained great occult truths, even the greatest and most profound divine mysteries respecting the origin and creation of man, and so beyond human comprehension that they must remain subjects</p>

<p>of faith and not of knowledge. Of the creation of the world it is written, 'These are the generations of the heavens and the earth <i>be hibaram</i> (when they were created); but at the creation of<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">55b-56a</FONT></span> man, scripture states, 'God blessed them and called their name Adam, be yom hibaram' (in the day when they were created), From the terms male and female, we gather that every figure that does not bear the form of the male or female, is not in the image and likeness of Adam Kadmon, the primal ideal man of which we have formerly spoken. Observe that in any place of scripture where the male and female are not found united together, the Holy One is said not to dwell or be present with His blessing and the name Adam is only used when such is the case."</p>  
<p>Said Rabbi Jehuda: "Since the destruction of the temple, Israel no longer enjoys the blessings that descend from on high daily on the earth. Yea, one may say that they have become lost unto Israel, as it is written, 'The righteous perisheth and no man layeth to heart' (Is. lvii., 1). The word perisheth here denotes the blessings from on high, but which are now of no beneficial effect in the renovation of human nature, for as stated, 'Truth is perished' (Jer. vii., 28); the truth that brings with it light, frees the soul from its downward propensities and informs us whence all blessings descend and come to man, namely, from the Holy One of whom it is written, 'And He blessed them.' It was through Seth that have come forth all the generations of the righteous in the world."</p>
