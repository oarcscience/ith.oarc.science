</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">"SYMBOLISM OF THE COLORS OF THE BOW IN THE CLOUD."</h3>  
<p>Said Rabbi Eleazar: The three primal colors become differentiated into many shades and hues and, as such, are symbols of the divine life and its numerous descending grades of holiness that merge and blend imperceptibly into the evil, just as the animal glides into the vegetable rendering it difficult and almost impossible to distinguish where the one ends and the other begins. The colors of the rainbow have each of them twenty-seven<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">73b</FONT></span> different shades and similarly the principle of holiness has the same number of descending gradations until it disappears into that which is unholy and sinful, <A HREF="errata.htm#48">indiscernible</A> to the ordinary observer, but clearly perceived and distinctly cognized by those who have become recipients of divine wisdom. Blessed is the lot of the upright in heart, to whom the Holy One delights to impart it and entrust to them its secret teachings. It is of them the psalmist speaks, 'The secret of the Lord is with them that fear him and he will shew them his covenant' (Is. XXV. 1). Greatly obligatory upon everyone is it to meditate upon the glory of his creator, who hears and attends to the prayers of all such as worship and serve him in sincerity of heart, for then blessings are showered upon them from on high with increasing knowledge of the Holy One who glories in his servants, of whom it is written, 'Thou art my servant, oh Israel in whom I will he glorified.'" (Is. XLIX. 3).</p>
