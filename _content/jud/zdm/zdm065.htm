</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">"THE DIVINE LEHAEROT ON EZECHIEL'S VISIONS."</h3>  
<p>SAID Rabbi Hezekiah: "The title of one of the Psalms is thus, 'A psalm of David Maschil' (for understanding), 'Blessed is he whose transgression is lifted up and whose sin is covered' (Ps. XXXII. 1). This verse has already been commented on. There is however an occult meaning in the word maschil (understanding), and, having reference to divine wisdom, it requires explanation. We learn from tradition that King David in composing his hymns and songs of praise to the Holy One, made use of ten different meters (one of which is termed ("<i>maschil</i>") corresponding to the various progressive states in the divine life symbolized by the ten sephiroth of the tree of life. In order to attain to these, David prepared and disciplined himself, that he might become receptive of their respective states of inspiration and spiritual enlightenment and thus be able to compose his psalms. The meaning of the words, 'blessed is he whose transgression is raised on high' is this, when the Holy One places in the scales of his balance a man's merits and demerits it sometimes happens that the scale in which his sins are placed rises, being overbalanced by the scale containing his good deeds. Such is the meaning of these words. Happy they! whose transgression is forgiven, that is,--when the scale in which it is placed, ascends. The words 'whose sin is covered' refer to those whose sins the Holy One, when his judgments are abroad in the world, covers and hides from the view of the destroying angel, as was the case with Noah whom he saved from experiencing the effects and consequences of the sin that was prevalent in the world through</p>

<p>the fall of Adam. As long as sin and wrong-doing subsist on earth, man suffers, because not in his normal and primal sate of innocency. He trembles and flees from before wild and savage animals,<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">71a-71b</FONT></span> no longer subject to his will and control. When Noah came forth out of the ark, the world had become cleansed and purified and humanity entered on a new era of existence and therefore it is written, 'And Alhim blessed him and his sons and said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth.'"</p>  
<p>Said Rabbi Simeon: "Though in these words no mention or reference is made to his wife and his sons; wives, yet are they included in, the term 'vaathem' (and ye), as also in the word 'ath' before the name of Noah which includes both males and females, both being subjects and recipients of divine benedictions. Then was it the Holy One gave unto them the seven precepts to be observed as rules of life until Israel should stand before Mount Sinai and receive the full law."</p>
