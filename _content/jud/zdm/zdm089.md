### SECTION LEKH LEKHA OR THE CALL OF ABRAM.

NOW the Lord said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy<span
class="margnote">76b-77a</span> country and from thy kindred, and from
they father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee'." (Gen. XII,
1.)<span class="margnote">Start of Lekh Lekha, Gen. 12:1-12:27</span>

At a meeting of Rabbi Simeon's students, for meditation on the esoteric
meaning of this passage in scripture, Rabbi Abba said: "It is written,
'Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted that are far from righteousness.'
(Is. XLVI. 12.) By the phrase 'stout-hearted' is meant those hardened
souls who, though acquainted with and having some knowledge of the
secret doctrine, yet manifest no inclination nor desire to adapt their
lives to its teachings and principles and walk in accordance with the
precepts of the good law, and are therefore said to be 'far from
righteousness'."

Said Rabbi Hezekiah: "The meaning of these words is, that they are
altogether void of the divine life and so do not enjoy inward peace of
conscience, as it is written, 'There is no peace unto the wicked.' (Is.
XLV III. 22.) Observe, it was Abraham's desire to live the higher life,
and to him may he justly applied the words, "Thou hast loved
righteousness and hated wickedness, therefore Alhim, thy Alhim, hath
anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.' (Ps. XLI. 8.)
For this reason it is further written, 'Thou, seed of Abraham, my
friend.' (Is. XLI. 8.) Wherefore does the Holy One style Abraham 'my
friends?' It was because he loved righteousness, for of all who lived in
his day and generation he alone was faithful, upright and obedient to
the divine law."

Said Rabbi Jose: "It is written, 'How amiable are thy tabernacles; oh
Lord of Hosts.' (Ps. LVIII. 1.)<span class="margnote">Ps. 84:1</span>
How incumbent upon us it is to study the works of the Holy One, for our
knowledge of them is only small and limited. Men know not upon what the
world is founded and how it is sustained and upheld. Still less do they
know anything of its creation or

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

the composition of fire and water that, blending together, become
solidified under the action of the Holy Spirit, which,<span
class="margnote">77a-77b</span> when it is withdrawn, they revert back
to chaos, and attraction between their individual atoms then ceases, as
it is written, 'It is he who shaketh the earth out of her place and the
pillars thereof tremble.' (Job IX. 6.) Everything in the universe is
founded on and governed by law, and so long as there are students found
engaged in its study, so will the world endure. Observe at the hour of
midnight when the Holy One enters the garden of Eden on high, to
converse with the righteous, all the trees of it rejoice and chant forth
praises to the glory of his name, as [it](errata.htm#66) is written,
'Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of the Lord
because he cometh to judge the earth.' (Chron. XVI. 33.) When is heard a
great voice from on high saying, 'Who hath ears, let him hear, who hath
eyes let him behold, and who hath a heart to understand, let him listen
and attend to the words and teachings of the spirits of all spirits
respecting the tour quarters of parts of the world.'

"Woe unto those who sleep, who know not, and do not desire to learn what
will happen them when in the presence of the great judge they will have
to account for their deeds. When the body is defiled, the soul departing
out of it flees

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

to the pure atmosphere on high and goes hither and thither,<span
class="margnote">77b</span> but the gates of heaven remain unopened to
it. Like chaff by the wind, or a stone from out a sling so it becomes
cast about. Woe unto those who care nought for and live indifferent to
the joys on high that are the recompense of the just, for they fall into
the power of Duma and descend into a hell out of which they will never
again come forth. It is of them scripture saith, 'As a cloud that is
consumed and vanished away, so is he who goeth down into Sheol. He shall
come up no more.' (Job VII. 9.)

"As the voice ceased uttering these words a light flashed forth from the
north, illumining the whole world and falling on the wings of the cock
caused it to crow at midnight. At that time no one rises from his couch
save those lovers of truth whose chief delight is in the study of the
secret doctrine. Then the Holy One, surrounded by souls of the just made
perfect, in the garden of Eden listens and attends to the voices of
truth-seekers, as it is written, 'Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the
companions hearken to thy voice; cause one to hear'." (Cant. VIII. 13.)
