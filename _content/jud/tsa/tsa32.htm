<p><DIR><b>T</b>. XI. 10. He who pursues after his fellow (to kill him) may be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life. How do they do this? They wound one of his limbs; and if even so they cannot prevent him, they forthwith kill him.</p>  
<p>11. He who pursues after a male, whether it be in a house or the open field, may be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life; if it be after a betrothed damsel, whether in a house or the open field, he may be so killed. If it be a betrothed damsel or any of the prohibited degrees enjoined in the Law, he may be so killed; but if it be a divorced widow of a high-priest, or an ordinary priest's wife who had been subjected to the <i>&#7717;ali&#7779;a</i> ceremony, he may not be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life. R. Jehuda says: Also, should she say, "Let him alone!" he may not be so killed, even though by leaving him alone he commit a capital crime.</p>  
<p>R. Eleazar, the son of R. Zadok, says: He who commits idolatry may be saved (from sin) at the cost of his life.</DIR></p>
