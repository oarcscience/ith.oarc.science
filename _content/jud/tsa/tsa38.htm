The punishment is more severe in the case of individuals than in that of multitudes: for individuals are liable to stoning, so that their property is not confiscate; whereas multitudes suffer (only) from the sword, and therefore their property is confiscate.</p>

<p>Three places in Israel cannot at the same time be adjudged "beguiled cities," lest the land of Israel be destroyed; but only one or two (at one time). R. Shimeon says: Not even two (together), but only one in Jud&aelig;a and one in Galilee. On the frontier even a single town cannot be so condemned, lest the heathen break through and destroy the land of Israel.</p>  
<p>When the heavier penalty&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_448"></A><A HREF="#fn_442"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> falls on the men of a beguiled city, a lighter penalty falls on their property and the city; and when the lighter penalty falls on the men of a beguiled city, a heavier penalty falls on their property and the city.

<p>2. If a caravan of asses or camels, going from place to place, lodge in the midst of the town, and are beguiled together with it, they are to die by the sword, and their property and the city are to be destroyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_449"></A><A HREF="#fn_443"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> If they have not delayed thirty days, they are to be stoned&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_450"></A><A HREF="#fn_444"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and their property and the city are not to be destroyed. In every case, those who beguile the city are to be stoned,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_451"></A><A HREF="#fn_445"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and their property and the city are to be destroyed.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_452"></A><A HREF="#fn_446"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>  
<p>If women and not men, or minors and not those of full age have beguiled the city, can it be (properly) a beguiled city? Scripture says: THE INHABITANTS OF THEIR TOWN;--the matter deals with "the inhabitants" of their city, and not with any of these.</p>  
<p>3. Those under age, the children of the men of the beguiled city, who have been beguiled with it, are not to be slain; but R. Eliezer says that they are to be slain. R. Akiba said to him: I argue from: HE WILL SHOW THEE MERCY, AND HAVE COMPASSION UPON THEE AND MULTIPLY THEE.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_453"></A><A HREF="#fn_447"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> If to shew mercy to those who are of age it is said: THOU SHALT SURELY SMITE;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_454"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and if to show mercy to the beasts it is said, UTTERLY DESTROY IT AND ALL THAT IS THEREIN AND ITS BEASTS;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_455"></A><A HREF="#fn_448"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> I maintain that the words, AND HE WILL SHOW THEE MERCY, must refer to those in the city who are under age.</p>  
<p>R. Eliezer says: Even those who are of age are not slain except at the mouth of witnesses and</DIR></p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>T</b>.</FONT></span><DIR>after the legal warning. And I argue that the purpose of AND HE WILL SHOW THEE MERCY is lest the judges say, "If we adjudge this to be a beguiled city, to-morrow the brethren and the neighbours of those who have been condemned will preserve hatred in their hearts against us." But thus saith the Almighty: Behold, I will cause them to have mercy and to bear my love in their hearts, so that they shall say, "We have naught against you in our hearts, for ye have uttered a true judgment."</p>  
<p>And the friends of the dead do not make (open) lamentation: they mourn, but only in their hearts.</p>  
<p>4. The property of the righteous that is in the city is lost, but what is outside escapes; while that of the wicked both within and without is lost. R. Eliezer says, "This is illustrated by the instance of Lot. He was in Sodom only for the sake of his property, yet he left the town empty-handed, as it is written: ESCAPE THITHER IN HASTE,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_456"></A><A HREF="#fn_449"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as if to say " Let it suffice thee that thou escape with thy life." Said R. Shimeon: Why is it said, "The property of the righteous that is therein is lost "? Because it is the property of the righteous which makes them dwell among the ungodly. And is it not an example of the <i>a fortiori</i> argument? If mere property, which cannot hear or see or speak, is condemned by the Almighty to be burnt because it makes the righteous live among the ungodly, much more ought the man to be burnt who turns away his fellow from the way of life to the way of death.</DIR></p>

<p>AND THOU SHALT BURN THE WHOLE CITY AND ALL ITS SPOIL WITH FIRE; <i>its</i> spoil, but not spoil belonging to Heaven. Therefore the holy things in it are redeemed,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_458"></A><A HREF="#fn_451"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the heave-offerings allowed to rot, and the Second Tithe and the Scriptures stored away.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_459"></A><A HREF="#fn_452"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p><DIR><b>T</b>. XIV. 5. Offerings intended for the altar shall die, but those for the Temple repairs are to be redeemed. R. Shimeon says: <i>ITS</i> CATTLE excludes the firstborn of cattle, and the tithes; and <i>ITS</i> SPOIL excludes money belonging to the Temple or the money for the Second Tithe.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_460"></A><A HREF="#fn_453"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> What is immovable, whether holy or not holy, is not to be destroyed, for it is said, THOU SHALT GATHER, thus excluding what is immovable. But in the other city (<i>i.e.</i> Jericho)&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_461"></A><A HREF="#fn_454"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> everything, whether immovable or not, was destroyed.</DIR></p>  
<p>X. 6<i>b</i>. A WHOLE OFFERING TO THE LORD THY M. GOD; R. Shimeon said: ("It is as if God said:) When you exercise judgment in a beguiled city, I will consider it as though you offer me a whole offering." AND IT SHALL BE A PERPETUAL HEAP AND SHALL NEVER AGAIN BE BUILT UPON;--you may not even make gardens or parks,--so R. Jose the Galil&aelig;an; but R.

<p>THOU SHALT KEEP NAUGHT OF THE ACCURSED THING, THAT THE LORD MAY TURN FROM THE HEAT OF HIS WRATH AND SHOW THEE MERCY AND KINDNESS AND INCREASE THEE;--the whole time that the ungodly is in the world, the HEAT OF WRATH is in the world; when the ungodly is perished from the world, the HEAT OF WRATH is taken from the world.</p>

Meir says, "Where it is customary to destroy by shedding blood, you shed blood; where it is by burning, you burn; and where by hamstringing, you hamstring."</p>  
<p>A man is not put to death by means of arrows or spears, and not with the point of the sword but with its edge, as it is written: WITH THE EDGE OF THE SWORD.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_463"></A><A HREF="#fn_456"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

Jose the Galil&aelig;an; but R. Akiba says: IT SHALL NO MORE BE BUILT, that is, in the form that it was before it shall not be built up; but it may be made into gardens and parks.</p>  
<p>AND IT SHALL BE A PERPETUAL HEAP, as it was in the days of Joshua. R. Jose and R.
