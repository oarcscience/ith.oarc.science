They come to the court at the gate of the Temple Mount, and he (the accused elder) says, "Thus have I expounded, and thus have my colleagues expounded; such and such have I pleaded, and such and such have my colleagues pleaded." &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_485"></A><A HREF="#fn_478"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Then if they (of the</p>

If not, they come to the court which is at the gate of the Temple yard, and he (the aforesaid elder) says, "Thus have I expounded, and thus have my colleagues expounded; such and such have I pleaded, and such and such have my colleagues pleaded." Then if they (of the gate of the Temple yard) had any tradition, they told it. If not, both courts went to the Great Court in the Hewn Chamber, whence the Law goes out to all Israel, as it is written, FROM THAT PLACE WHICH THE LORD SHALL CHOOSE.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_486"></A><A HREF="#fn_479"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Then, if the accused elder return to his city, and expound and plead <A HREF="errata.htm#0">as</A> he was wont to teach,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_487"></A><A HREF="#fn_480"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> he is innocent; but if he direct the judgment to be carried out, he is guilty, for it is written, THE MAN THAT DOETH PRESUMPTUOUSLY,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_488"></A><A HREF="#fn_481"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> etc.;--he is not guilty until he direct the carrying out of the judgment. A mere disciple&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_489"></A><A HREF="#fn_482"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> who should direct the carrying out of the judgment is innocent; hence what appears to be severity against him is found to be leniency.</p>

<p>The defiant elder was not put to death by the court of his own city nor by that in Jabne, but was brought up to the Great Court in Jerusalem, kept in prison till a festival, and put to death on a festival, for it is written, ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL HEAR AND FEAR,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_493"></A><A HREF="#fn_486"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>--so R.
