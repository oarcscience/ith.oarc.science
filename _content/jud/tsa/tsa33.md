### B.--THOSE WHO ARE PUNISHABLE BY BURNING

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>IX. 1*a*. These are punishable by
burning: he who has criminal connexion with a woman and her
daughter, <span id="fr_371"></span>[1](#fn_367) and a priest's
daughter <span id="fr_372"></span>[2](#fn_368) (who has committed
adultery). The term "a woman and her daughter" includes a man's own
daughter, his daughter's or son's daughter, his wife's daughter, her
daughter's or son's daughter, his mother-in-law, the mother of his
father-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law.

**T**. XII. 1. These are they who are to be burnt he who has criminal
connexion with a woman and her daughter, and a priest's daughter who is
bound to a husband. Whether a man have criminal connexion with a woman
and afterwards with her daughter, or with a daughter first and
afterwards with her mother, he is alike guilty.

Although we have no express sanction from Scripture that he is to be
burnt who has criminal connexion with the daughter of one who is not his
legal wife--the passage in Scripture: AND THE MAN WHO SHALL TAKE (*i.e.*
"marry") A WOMAN AND HER MOTHER, IT IS LEWDNESS, <span
id="fr_373"></span>[3](#fn_369) dealing with actual marriage--Scripture
says: AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANY MAN (OR) PRIEST, <span
id="fr_374"></span>[4](#fn_370) to include every case.

2\. A betrothed damsel and a priest's daughter who has committed
adultery are to be stoned. R. Shimeon says that they are to be burnt.
