### 9. He who offers his Children to Moloch.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VII. 7*a*. He who offers one of his
children to Moloch <span id="fr_313"></span>[1](#fn_310) is not guilty
until he both delivers him over to Moloch and passes him through the
fire. If he deliver him over to Moloch and do not pass him through the
fire, or if he pass him through the fire but do not deliver him over to
Moloch, he is not guilty. (He is not guilty) until he both delivers him
over to Moloch and passes him through the fire.

**T**. X. 4. He who offers one of his children to Moloch is not guilty
until he delivers him over to Moloch and also passes him through the
fire. If he deliver him over to Moloch, and do not pass him through the
fire; or pass him through the fire, but do not deliver him over to
Moloch: he is not guilty. (He is not guilty) until he both delivers him
over to Moloch and passes him through the fire, in the way peculiar to
the Moloch worship. <span id="fr_314"></span>[2](#fn_311) If he pass him
through on his feet he is innocent, and he can only be guilty in the
case of his own offspring. 5. If he cause his father or mother or sister
to pass through, he is innocent. If he cause himself to pass through, he
is innocent; but R. Shimeon would condemn him. There is the same guilt
if the passing through be in the name of Moloch or of any other idol;
but R. Shimeon, the son of Eleazar, holds that it must be in the name of
Moloch only,

was that? Said Abayi: A row of bricks was arranged for the passage, and
on both sides fire was kindled. Rabba maintains that it was by jumping,
as children used to jump on Purim."
