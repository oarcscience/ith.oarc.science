### (3) The Elder who defies the Court.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>2. "The elder who defies the court:
"it is written, IF A MATTER BE TOO DIFFICULT FOR THEE TO JUDGE, BETWEEN
BLOOD AND BLOOD, AND BETWEEN PLEA AND PLEA, <span
id="fr_484"></span>[4](#fn_477) etc. There were three courts: one at the
gate of the Temple yard, one at the door of the Temple Mount, and one in
the Hewn Chamber. They come to the court at the gate of the Temple
Mount, and he (the accused elder) says, "Thus have I expounded, and thus
have my colleagues expounded; such and such have I pleaded, and such and
such have my colleagues pleaded."  <span id="fr_485"></span>[5](#fn_478)
Then if they (of the

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>court of the Temple Mount) had heard
any tradition (bearing on the point) they told it. If not, they come to
the court which is at the gate of the Temple yard, and he (the aforesaid
elder) says, "Thus have I expounded, and thus have my colleagues
expounded; such and such have I pleaded, and such and such have my
colleagues pleaded." Then if they (of the gate of the Temple yard) had
any tradition, they told it. If not, both courts went to the Great Court
in the Hewn Chamber, whence the Law goes out to all Israel, as it is
written, FROM THAT PLACE WHICH THE LORD SHALL CHOOSE. <span
id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_479) Then, if the accused elder return to his
city, and expound and plead [as](errata.htm#0) he was wont to
teach, <span id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_480) he is innocent; but if he
direct the judgment to be carried out, he is guilty, for it is written,
THE MAN THAT DOETH PRESUMPTUOUSLY, <span id="fr_488"></span>[3](#fn_481)
etc.;--he is not guilty until he direct the carrying out of the
judgment. A mere disciple <span id="fr_489"></span>[4](#fn_482) who
should direct the carrying out of the judgment is innocent; hence what
appears to be severity against him is found to be leniency.

3\. It is more serious to offend against decrees of the Scribes than
against decrees of the Law. <span id="fr_490"></span>[5](#fn_483) One

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>who says, "There should be no
phylacteries," thereby transgressing against the words of the Law, <span
id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_484) is innocent; but he who says, "There
should be five <span id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_485) passages of
Scripture in them," adding to what the Scribes ordain, is guilty.

The defiant elder was not put to death by the court of his own city nor
by that in Jabne, but was brought up to the Great Court in Jerusalem,
kept in prison till a festival, and put to death on a festival, for it
is written, ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL HEAR AND FEAR, <span
id="fr_493"></span>[3](#fn_486)--so R. Akiba; but R. Jehuda says, "His
case should not be delayed, <span id="fr_494"></span>[4](#fn_487) but he
should be put to death at once, while they write, despatching the news
everywhere: N. son of N. has been condemned to death by the Court."

**T**. XIV 12. The defiant elder who has taught, and practised according
to his teaching, is guilty. If he have taught and not practised he is
free. If he have taught with the intention of practising, even if he
have not actually practised his teaching, he is guilty.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_477"></span>[137:4](tsa42.htm#fr_484) Deut. 17. 8-13.

<span id="fn_478"></span>[137:5](tsa42.htm#fr_485) The whole of this
sentence has dropped out of C by error.

<span id="fn_479"></span>[138:1](tsa42.htm#fr_486) Deut. 17. 10.

<span id="fn_480"></span>[138:2](tsa42.htm#fr_487) Not in accordance
with the instructions of the supreme Sanhedrin. The mere teaching does
not carry with it criminal liability.

<span id="fn_481"></span>[138:3](tsa42.htm#fr_488) Deut. 17. 12.

<span id="fn_482"></span>[138:4](tsa42.htm#fr_489) One who has not been
co-opted to any court as judge, and has, therefore, no right to utter
decisions, much less to carry them into practice. Though this may be a
disability, the fact that he cannot suffer the penalty of the defiant
elder must be regarded as a counterbalancing gain.

<span id="fn_483"></span>[138:5](tsa42.htm#fr_490) Because, to decide a
matter in opposition to the written Law carries with it its own
condemnation; whereas, to oppose the oral <span id="page_139">p.
139</span> tradition (of equal authority with the Law of Moses; see
*Pirke Aboth* I. 1 ff.) does not, to the same degree, stand
self-condemned; and is, therefore, the more pernicious. Cf. Matt. 15. 6;
Mark 7. 8.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[139:1](tsa42.htm#fr_491) Deut. 6. 8.

<span id="fn_485"></span>[139:2](tsa42.htm#fr_492) The Scribes ordain
four; Exod. 13. 1-10; 11-16; Deut. 6. 4-9; 11. 13-21.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[139:3](tsa42.htm#fr_493) Deut. 17. 13.

<span id="fn_487"></span>[139:4](tsa42.htm#fr_494) For reasons which he
gives in Tosefta XI. 7.
