<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</FONT></span>IV. i. Non-capital and capital cases are identical with regard to examination and inquiry,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> as it is written; YE SHALL HAVE ONE MANNER OF LAW.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>What is the difference between capital and non-capital cases? Non-capital cases are tried by three, and capital by twenty-three judges. Non-capital cases may begin either with the argument for acquittal or the argument for conviction; while capital cases begin with the argument for acquittal and not with the argument for conviction. In non-capital cases the conviction or acquittal can depend on a majority of one; in capital cases the acquittal can depend on one, but the conviction must depend on a majority of two. In non-capital cases the judges may change their verdict either from conviction to acquittal, or from acquittal to conviction; but in capital cases they may change their verdict from conviction to acquittal but not from acquittal to conviction.</p>  
<p>In non-capital cases they may all plead either</p>  
<p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</FONT></span> in favour of conviction or of acquittal; but in capital cases they may all plead in favour of acquittal but not of conviction. In non-capital cases one who pleads in favour of conviction may subsequently plead in favour of acquittal, and one who pleads in favour of acquittal may subsequently plead in favour of conviction; but in capital cases one who pleads in favour of conviction may subsequently plead in favour of acquittal, but he who pleads in favour of acquittal cannot change and plead in favour of conviction.</p>  
<p>In non-capital cases the trial may take place in daytime and the verdict be given in the night; but in capital cases the trial takes place in daytime and the verdict is given in daytime. In non-capital cases a verdict of acquittal or of conviction may be reached the same day; while in capital cases a verdict of acquittal may be reached the same day, but a verdict of conviction not until the following day. Therefore such a case is not tried on the eve of a Sabbath or festival.</p>  
<p>2. In non-capital cases, and in cases of purity and impurity, the opinion of the eldest is asked first; in capital cases that of those sitting at the side.</p>  
<p>All are eligible to try non-capital cases; but capital--only priests, Levites, and Israelites who are eligible for marriage into the priestly families.</p>

In capital cases they begin not with the case for prosecution, but with the case for the defence, except only in the case of a beguiler to idolatry,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and, according to R. Jehoshua, the son of Karha, the case of one who leads a town astray.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>  
<p>3. In the case of those liable to the penalty of exile,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the court may change a verdict of conviction into a verdict of acquittal (but not one of acquittal into one of conviction), for it is written: YE SHALL TAKE NO RANSOM FOR THE LIFE OF A MAN-SLAYER WHICH IS GUILTY OF DEATH&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>; and also, AND THIS IS THE CASE OF THE MANSLAYER . . . WHOSO KILLETH HIS NEIGHBOUR UNAWARES.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> Since the term <i>manslayer</i> is thus used both of intentional and unintentional homicide, the trial of the latter is subject to the rules for trials in capital cases.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>  
<p>4. In the case of those liable to the penalty of scourging, the court may change a verdict of conviction into a verdict of acquittal (but not one of acquittal into one of conviction), for it is written: AND THEY SHALL JUSTIFY THE RIGHTEOUS AND CONDEMN THE GUILTY . . . . AND IF THE GUILTY MAN BE WORTHY TO BE BEATEN,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_240"></A><A HREF="#fn_238"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> etc. Since the term <i>guilty</i> is used both here, of the one liable to</DIR></p>

<p>5. The eunuch and such as have no children are eligible to try non-capital cases but not capital cases; and according to R. Jehuda, they also who are biased in the direction of severity or forbearance are subject to the same restriction.</p>  
<p>6. They may not argue a case afresh (after the vote has been taken), but R. Jehuda says they may.</p>  
<p>If there be two of whom one would prohibit and the other allow, or one who would declare unclean and the other clean, the one who prohibits or declares unclean must bring proof; all who tend to the harsher opinion must bring proof. And some say that the same applies to the one who would take a more lenient view.</p>  
<p>They may not give their attention to a case except in the place where they vote, nor indulge in too long a session. When a case has been dismissed it cannot be rediscussed. Why is this? Because of the rule that they cannot argue a case afresh.</p>  
<p>When (in a debate) the speaker has completed his statement, he cannot take back what he has said unless his opponent grant him the right. When the main subject of the case has been dealt with, secondary points become the main subject. A man may not answer his neighbour more than three times lest his mind become confused. One argues against two, or two against one, or two against three, or three against two; but never three against three, or greater numbers, lest the court get into confusion.</p>  
<p>7. In non-capital cases they may say "The matter is too obvious,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> but not in capital cases; and such a statement can only be made by the chief judge.</p>

<p>If one member put a question while another speaks not asking a question, attention is given to him who puts the question. If one ask for a precedent, he must say "I ask for a precedent." If one ask a relevant question and another ask an irrelevant question, they answer him who puts the relevant question. If one ask an irrelevant question he must say "My question is not relevant,"--so R. Meir; but the majority hold that the practice of the law need not be wholly bound up with what is relevant.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_240"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Attention is paid to what is relevant rather than to what is not relevant, to what is a precedent rather than to what is no precedent, to Halaka&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> rather than to Midrash,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_244"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to Midrash rather than to Haggada,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_245"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to the argument <i>from less to greater</i>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_246"></A><A HREF="#fn_244"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> rather than to Midrash, to the argument <i>from less to greater</i> rather than the argument from analogy,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_247"></A><A HREF="#fn_245"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> to a member of the court rather than to a disciple, and to a disciple rather than to an ignorant man. But when it is a case of deciding between two members of the court, or two disciples, or two ignorant men, or two <i>halakoth</i>, or two questions, or two answers, or two precedents, the authority for the decision at such a point lies with the speaker&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_248"></A><A HREF="#fn_246"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> of the court.</DIR></p>
