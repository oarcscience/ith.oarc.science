### The Duties and Restrictions relating to the High-Priest.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>II. I. The High-priest can judge and
be judged, can bear witness and be witnessed against; he may perform the
*ḥaliṣa* <span id="fr_137"></span>[1](#fn_136) ceremony and it may be
performed in the case of his wife; his brother may marry his wife if she
be childless, but he may not marry his brother's wife since he is
forbidden to marry a widow. <span id="fr_138"></span>[2](#fn_137)

If a death occur in his family he may not follow the bier, but may
follow the procession as far as the city gate, both he and the
procession remaining out of each other's sight--so R. Meir; but R.
Jehuda holds that he may not leave the temple, since it is
written: <span id="fr_139"></span>[3](#fn_138) AND FROM THE TEMPLE HE
SHALL NOT DEPART.

When he consoles others, it is usual for the people to pass along one
after the other, the Superintendent <span
id="fr_140"></span>[4](#fn_139) placing the high-priest between himself
and the people. When he is consoled by others, all the people say to
him: "May we make expiation for thee!" and he replies: "Be ye blessed of
Heaven!" When they hold the funeral meal, <span
id="fr_141"></span>[5](#fn_140)

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>all the people sit round on the
ground, while he sits on the raised seat.

**T**. IV. 1. A high-priest who has slain a man intentionally is to be
slain; if in error, he is to be an exile to the Cities of Refuge. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_141) If he have transgressed a positive or
negative command, or any other commandment, <span
id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_142) he is to be treated as a commoner in
every respect.

He does not perform the *ḥaliṣa* ceremony, nor is it performed in the
case of his wife. He does not marry his deceased brother's wife if she
be childless, nor does his brother marry his wife. (When, on the
occasion of a death, he is consoled by others) he takes his position in
the row, with the *sagan* at his right hand, and the head of his
father's house on his left. And all the people say to him; "May we make
expiation for thee!" and he says to them: "Be ye blessed of Heaven!"
When he consoles others, he stands in the row with the sagan and the
former high-priest on his right, and the mourner on his left. He may not
be seen naked, nor when he is having his hair cut, nor when he is in the
bath--as it is written: <span id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_143) AND HE
THAT IS THE HIGH-PRIEST AMONG HIS BRETHREN, etc., so that his brethren
the priests treat him with honour. But if he wish others to wash with
him, he has such authority. R. Jehuda says: If he wished to conduct
himself disgracefully, they must not listen to him, for it is
written: <span id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_144) AND THOU SHALT KEEP HIM
HOLY--even against his will.

They said to R. Jehuda: It is written, <span
id="fr_146"></span>[5](#fn_145) AND FROM THE TEMPLE HE SHALL NOT DEPART,
but this

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

refers only to the time when he is engaged in the temple worship. He may
go to hold the funeral meal with others, and others may go to hold the
funeral meal with him.
