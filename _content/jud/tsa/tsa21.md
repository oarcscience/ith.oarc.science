### 8. The Idolater.

6\. In a case of idolatry it is all one whether a man worship,
sacrifice, offer incense, or pour out

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>libations; or whether he bow himself
down, accept it as a god, or say to it "Thou art my God." But he who
puts his arm round it, kisses, sweeps, <span
id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_305) besprinkles, washes, anoints, clothes,
or shoes it breaks a negative commandment. <span
id="fr_309"></span>[2](#fn_306) He who makes a vow in its name, and
keeps it in its name, breaks a negative commandment; so also does he who
excretes <span id="fr_310"></span>[3](#fn_307) to *Ba’al Pe’or*--for
such is his cult, and he who tosses a stone on a *merkolis* <span
id="fr_311"></span>[4](#fn_308)--for such is its cult.

**T**. X. 3. In a case of idolatry it is all one whether a man worship,
sacrifice, offer incense, or pour out libations, or bow down and accept
it as a god and say to it, "Thou art my God, save me! " They are to be
stoned. He who makes an idol, carves it, or sets it up, speaks with it,
or wipes or scrapes it, transgresses a negative commandment; they are
not liable to stoning until there is in their action some similarity to
sacrificing, offering incense, pouring out libations, or bowing down. So
also he who embraces, kisses, sweeps, sprinkles, clothes, shoes, or
shrouds it, offends against a negative commandment. R. Jehuda says, "It
is written: AND I WILL LEAVE ME SEVEN THOUSAND IN ISRAEL, ALL THE KNEES
THAT HAVE NOT BOWED TO BAAL, AND EVERY MOUTH WHICH HATH NOT KISSED
HIM, <span id="fr_312"></span>[5](#fn_309)--comparing kissing with
kneeling. As kneeling incurs guilt, so

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

does kissing; and their death is left in the hands of Heaven."

<span id="fn_305"></span>[99:1](tsa21.htm#fr_308) C reads "sifts (?),
embraces."

<span id="fn_306"></span>[99:2](tsa21.htm#fr_309) Cf. Exod. 20.; 23. 24;
Deut. 5. 9.

<span id="fn_307"></span>[99:3](tsa21.htm#fr_310) Word-play on *Pe’or*.
Cf. Isa. 5. 14; Psalm 119. 131, for meaning of root.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[99:4](tsa21.htm#fr_311) Mercurius, Hermes. A
*merkolis* was a representation of the head of Hermes on the top of a
square-shaped pillar, placed in prominent positions at cross-roads or
boundaries. Passers-by signalized their homage to Hermes Enodios, the
patron deity of the wayfarer, by throwing stones at it, gradually
forming a cairn. Cf. Vulgate of Prov. 26. 8 and *Aboda Zara*, III. 7.
