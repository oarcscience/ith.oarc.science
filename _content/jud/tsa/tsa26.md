### 14. The Seducer of a Betrothed Damsel.

9\. He who has criminal connexion with a betrothed damsel <span
id="fr_326"></span>[4](#fn_323) is guilty only if she be a virgin,
betrothed, and in her father's house. If two have criminal connexion
with her, the first is to be stoned and the second strangled.

**T**. X. 8. He who has criminal connexion with a betrothed damsel is
guilty only if she be a damsel, a virgin, betrothed, and in her father's
house. If she be a betrothed damsel and in her husband's house, or a
betrothed woman of marriageable age <span
id="fr_327"></span>[5](#fn_324) in her father's house, (9) or a married
woman in

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

either her father's or her husband's house, whoever has criminal
connexion with her is to be strangled. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_325) If ten have had criminal connexion with
her at a time when she is still a virgin, all are to be stoned; if she
be not a virgin the first is to be stoned and the others strangled.

10\. If, however, she have received her husband in her father's house,
then, although she be still a virgin, one who has criminal connexion
with her is to be strangled. <span id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_325)

A betrothed damsel who has committed adultery is to be stoned at the
door of her father's house. If there is no door to her father's house,
she is to be stoned where she committed adultery. And if it be in a
heathen city, she is to be stoned at the door of the court.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_323"></span>[102:4](tsa26.htm#fr_326) Deut. 22. 23-34. The
description *na‘ara*, ''damsel," is, according to *Mishnah Niddin* V.
67, only applicable to one between the age of twelve years and a day and
twelve years and six months.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[102:5](tsa26.htm#fr_327) No longer a "damsel,"
but *bogereth*, "entering maturity," past the age of twelve years and
six months.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[103:1](tsa26.htm#fr_329) It comes within the
scope of adultery; *Mishnah* XI. 6*b*.
