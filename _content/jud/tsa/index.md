------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a translation of the Talmud tractate Sanhedrin, which deals with
judicial procedure, particularly relating to capital punishment. The
author is a Christian academic, and the translation includes the primary
text (Mishna) and the second-level commentary (Tosefta). This book is a
good supplement to the [Rodkinson translation](../t08/index) of the same
tractate, particularly because this version has extensive scholarly
apparatus lacking in the Rodkinson translation.
