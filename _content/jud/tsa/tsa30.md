### 18. The Stubborn and Rebellious Son.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 1. At what time can one be
deemed a "stubborn and rebellious son"? <span
id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_337) From the time that he can produce two
hairs until the lower beard is encompassed (not the upper one, for the
wise men spoke modestly), for it is written: WHEN A MAN HAS A SON; not a
daughter, but a son; neither must he be a man; whereas a minor is exempt
since he does not come within the scope of the commandments. <span
id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_338)

**T**. XI. 6a. "A stubborn and rebellious son "there never was and there
never will be such. Then why is it written? To teach, "Study and receive
the reward."

R. Shimeon, the son of Eleazar, says: It should

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

<span class="margnote">T.</span>

say "a daughter" and not "a son"; <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_339)
but the decree of the King <span id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_340) is: A
stubborn and rebellious son.

M. VIII. 2. When does he become guilty? When he eats a *tritimor* <span
id="fr_345"></span>[3](#fn_341) of flesh, and drinks a half *log* <span
id="fr_346"></span>[4](#fn_342) of Italian <span
id="fr_347"></span>[5](#fn_343) wine; or, according to R. Jose, a *manê*
of flesh and a *log* of wine. If he consumed it at a religious festival
or at the intercalation of the month; if he ate the Second Tithe at
Jerusalem; <span id="fr_348"></span>[6](#fn_344) or if he ate
carcases, <span id="fr_349"></span>[7](#fn_345) meat torn by
beasts, <span id="fr_350"></span>[8](#fn_346) things detestable <span
id="fr_351"></span>[9](#fn_347) or crawling; <span
id="fr_352"></span>[10](#fn_348) if he ate anything which was according
to the requirement of the Law, or anything which was a transgression of
the Law; if he ate food which was not flesh, or drank any drink but not
wine; he is not thereby a stubborn and rebellious son,--not until he eat
flesh and drink wine, for it is said: A GLUTTON (‏זולל‎) AND A
WINE-SWILLER (‏וסובא‎). <span id="fr_353"></span>[11](#fn_349) And
though there is no proof of the verbal dependence, it is suggested
in <span id="fr_354"></span>[12](#fn_350) BE NOT AMONG THOSE WHO SWILL
WINE (‏בסבאי יין‎) AND GLUT THEMSELVES WITH FLESH (‏בזללי בשר‎). <span
id="fr_355"></span>[13](#fn_351)

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

**T**. XI. 6b. Even one who furnishes his table as though it were a
banquet of Solomon, if it be at its proper season, is not adjudged a
stubborn and rebellious son; unless he put in his mouth the (forbidden)
amount, or do similarly at a public meal.

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>VIII. 3. If he steal aught from his
father and eat it in his father's domain; or anything from others and
eat it in his father's domain; or anything from others and eat it in the
others’ domain,--he is not a stubborn and rebellious son;--not until he
steals what belongs to his father and eats it in another's domain. R.
Jose, <span id="fr_356"></span>[1](#fn_352) the son of Jehuda, holds:
Not until he steals from his father and from his mother.

4\. If his father concur and not his mother, or his mother concur and
not his father, he is not a stubborn and rebellious son;--not until they
both concur in his condemnation. According to R. Jehuda, if his mother
be not suited <span id="fr_357"></span>[2](#fn_353) to his father he
cannot become a stubborn and rebellious son. If either of them be maimed
in the hands, lame, dumb, blind, or deaf, he cannot become a stubborn
and rebellious son, for it is written: THEY SHALL SEIZE HIM--so they
must not be maimed in the hands; AND MAKE HIM GO--so they must not be
lame; AND SAY--so they must not be dumb; THIS OUR SON--so they must not

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>be blind; DOES NOT HEAR OUR
VOICE--So they must not be deaf. <span id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_354)

VIII\. 4. If he has been warned in the presence of three witnesses and
beaten, and again becomes degenerate, he must be tried by twenty-three
judges; but he cannot be stoned unless the first three witnesses are
there, for it is written, THIS OUR SON, as if to say, "This is he who
was beaten in your presence."

If he escape away before his trial be completed and afterward the lower
beard become encompassed, he is free. But if he escape away after his
trial is completed and then the lower beard become encompassed, he is
liable to the penalty.

5\. A stubborn and rebellious son is condemned in view of what he might
afterwards become. Let him die innocent and let him not die guilty. For
the death of the ungodly is a benefit to them and a benefit to the whole
world; but that of the righteous is a misfortune to them and a
misfortune to the whole world. When the ungodly indulge in wine and
sleep, it is a benefit to them and a benefit to the whole world; but
when the righteous so indulge, it is a misfortune to them and a
misfortune to the whole world. The isolation of the ungodly is a benefit
to them and a benefit to the whole world, but in the case of the
righteous it is a misfortune to them and a misfortune to the whole
world. The assembling together of the ungodly is a misfortune to them
and a misfortune to the whole world; but in the

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="margnote">**M**.</span>case of the righteous it is a
benefit to them and a benefit to the whole world. Silence among the
ungodly is a misfortune to them and a misfortune to the whole world, but
in the case of the righteous it is a benefit to them and a benefit to
the whole world. <span id="fr_359"></span>[1](#fn_355)

**T**. XI. 7. A stubborn and rebellious son, a defiant elder, a beguiler
to idolatry, one who leads a town astray, a false prophet, and
perjurers, are not killed at once but brought up to the great court at
Jerusalem and kept in prison till a feast and killed at a feast, for it
is written: AND ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL HEAR AND FEAR, AND DO NO MORE
PRESUMPTUOUSLY, <span id="fr_360"></span>[2](#fn_356)--so R. Meir; but
R. Jehuda said to him: "Ought it not then to say, 'All the people shall
see and fear'? But it is not so written but 'ALL THE PEOPLE SHALL HEAR
AND FEAR.' Then why should they postpone such a one's death? Therefore
they kill him at once, and write and send everywhere, saying 'The trial
of N. has been completed in such and such a court, and N. and N. are his
witnesses; such and such has been done to him."

8\. R. Shimeon, the son of Jehuda, says in the name of Shimeon: Beauty
and power and wisdom and wealth and old age and glory and honour and
sons, are good for the righteous and good for the whole world; for it is
written, OLD AGE IS A CROWN OF GLORY, <span
id="fr_361"></span>[3](#fn_357) and CHILDREN'S CHILDREN ARE THE CROWN OF
OLD MEN, <span id="fr_362"></span>[4](#fn_358) and THE GLORY OF YOUNG
MEN IS THEIR STRENGTH, <span id="fr_363"></span>[5](#fn_359) and BEFORE
HIS ELDERS IS HONOUR. <span id="fr_364"></span>[6](#fn_360) R. Shimeon,
the son of

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Menasia, says,
"These seven qualities which the wise have counted among the virtues of
the righteous were all exemplified in Rabbi and his sons."
