<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN"><b>M</b>.</FONT></span>IX. 1<i>a</i>. These are punishable by burning: he who has criminal connexion with a woman and her daughter,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_371"></A><A HREF="#fn_367"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and a priest's daughter&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_372"></A><A HREF="#fn_368"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> (who has committed adultery). The term "a woman and her daughter" includes a man's own daughter, his daughter's or son's daughter, his wife's daughter, her daughter's or son's daughter, his mother-in-law, the mother of his father-in-law, and the mother of his mother-in-law.</p>  
<p><DIR><b>T</b>. XII. 1. These are they who are to be burnt he who has criminal connexion with a woman and her daughter, and a priest's daughter who is bound to a husband. Whether a man have criminal connexion with a woman and afterwards with her daughter, or with a daughter first and afterwards with her mother, he is alike guilty.</p>  
<p>Although we have no express sanction from Scripture that he is to be burnt who has criminal connexion with the daughter of one who is not his legal wife--the passage in Scripture: AND THE MAN WHO SHALL TAKE (<i>i.e.</i> "marry") A WOMAN AND HER MOTHER, IT IS LEWDNESS,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_373"></A><A HREF="#fn_369"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> dealing with actual marriage--Scripture says: AND THE DAUGHTER OF ANY MAN (OR) PRIEST,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_374"></A><A HREF="#fn_370"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> to include every case.</p>  
<p>2. A betrothed damsel and a priest's daughter who has committed adultery are to be stoned. R. Shimeon says that they are to be burnt.</DIR></p>
