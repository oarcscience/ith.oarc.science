### 1-6. Those Guilty of Incestuous and Unnatural Crimes.

\(1\) He who has criminal connexion with his mother <span
id="fr_297"></span>[2](#fn_294) is guilty both in respect of the law of
the mother and the law of the father's wife. R. Jehuda holds that he is
guilty in respect of the law of the mother only. (2) He who has criminal
connexion with his father's wife <span id="fr_298"></span>[3](#fn_295)
is thereby guilty both in respect of the law of the father's wife and
that of the married woman, whether before or after his father's death,
whether she be betrothed or actually married. (3) He who has criminal
connexion with his daughter-in-law <span id="fr_299"></span>[4](#fn_296)
is thereby guilty in respect both of the law of a man's daughter-in-law
and that of a married woman, whether it be before or after his son's
death, whether she be betrothed or actually married. (4-5) In the case
of one who has criminal connexion with a male <span
id="fr_300"></span>[5](#fn_297) or

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

a beast, <span id="fr_301"></span>[1](#fn_298) or (6) of the woman who
has criminal M. connexion with a beast, <span
id="fr_302"></span>[2](#fn_299) if the human being has sinned wherein
lies the sin of the beast? Since by its means an offence has happened to
a human being, Scripture says: LET IT BE STONED. <span
id="fr_303"></span>[3](#fn_300) Or, according to another explanation,
(it is put to death) lest the beast should go through the street and it
be said: This is the animal on account of which such a man was stoned.

X. 1. R. Jehuda said: He who has criminal connexion with his mother is
guilty only in respect of the law of the mother. R. Jehuda said: He who
has criminal connexion with his father's wife is guilty only in respect
of the law of the father's wife.

2\. He who has criminal connexion with his own mother who is the
divorced wife of a high-priest, or an ordinary priest's wife who has
been subjected to the *ḥaliṣa* ceremony, or an illegal wife of his
father, or one of the "nakednesses" of his father,--is liable to the
penalty of stoning.

He who has criminal connexion with his father's wife (not his own
mother) who is the divorced widow of a high-priest, or an ordinary
priest's wife who has been subjected to the *ḥaliṣa* ceremony,--is
liable to the penalty of stoning; but if (being neither of these two)
she is an illegal wife of his father, or one of the "nakednesses" of his
father,--he is not liable to the penalty of stoning.

He who has criminal connexion with his sister is guilty in respect of
the law of the sister and also of the law of the daughter of his
father's wife. R. Jose says: He is guilty only in respect of the law of
the

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

<span class="margnote">**T**.</span>

sister; and the same holds good for one who has criminal connexion with
his daughter-in-law.

One who has criminal connexion with a male, nine <span
id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_301) years and a day old; and one who has
criminal connexion with a beast in its way, and not in a woman's way;
and the woman who has criminal connexion with a beast, whether or not
according to its way,--are to be stoned.
