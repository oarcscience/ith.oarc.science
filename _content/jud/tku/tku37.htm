<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING THE HAIR OF MICROPROSOPUS.</H3>
<P>570. WE have learned that from the skull of His head (<I>i.e., of Microprosopus</I>) hang one thousand times a thousand myriad myriads of locks of black hair, and they are intertwined together each to the other, and they are mingled together.</P>
<P>571. But there is no classification made of the locks of hair separately, because pure and impure alike adhere to each other therein, and here (<I>the description above given</I>) mentions both pure and impure together.</P>
<P>572. In all those sides which are pure, and in all those which are impure, there are intricate and dense locks of hair, some of which are soft, some hard.</P>
<P>573. And in single locks doth the hair hang down, curls upon curls, which emit flames, and hang down in beautiful and strong array, like those of a brave hero victorious in war.</P>
<P>574. They are excellent as the great and foliated cedars. This is that which is written, Cant. v. 15: "Excellent as the cedars."</P>
<P>

<P>575. The curling locks are parted on this side and on that above the head.</P>
<P>576. Also we have learned that they remain in curls because they proceed from many fountains of the three canals of the brain.</P>
<P>577. For from the fountain of one cavity of the skull proceedeth the hair, and it becomes curls upon curls (formed), from the fountains proceeding from that cavity.</P>
<P>578. From the second cavity there go forth fifty fountains, and from those fountains the hair issueth, and it becometh curls upon curls, and they are mingled with the other locks.</P>
<P>579. From the third cavity there go forth a thousand times a thousand conclaves and assemblies, and from them all the hair issueth; and it becometh curls upon curls, and they are mingled with the other locks.</P>
<P>580. And therefore are those locks so curling, and all the progeny of them is produced from the three cavities of the brain of the skull.</P>
<P>58t. And all those curls hang down and are spread over the sides of the ears.</P>
<P>532. And therefore is it written, Dan. ix. 18: "Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear."</P>
<P>583. And in those curls there are found alike right and left,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_101"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> light and dark, mercy and judgment, and everything (<I>that hath in itself the qualities of</I>) right and left dependeth thence (<I>from Microprosopus</I>), and not from the Ancient One.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
<P>584. In the parting of the hair appeareth a certain slender path, which hath a certain connection with that path of the Ancient of Days, and from that path are divided six hundred and thirteen paths,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> which are</P>

<P>distributed among the paths of the precepts of the law.</P>
<P>585. Like as it is written, Ps. xxv. 6: "All the paths of Tetragrammaton are mercy and truth unto such as keep His covenant and His testimony."</P>
<P>586. We have learned that in the single locks a thousand times a thousand utterances of the speech of Tetragrammaton are found, which depend from the single locks.</P>
<P>587. Among them some are hard (<I>rigorous</I>) and some soft (<I>merciful</I>), as (<I>belonging unto</I>) the Lord of the equilibrium (or, the Lord of mercy, who is an equilibrium between these); and therefore is He (<I>Microprosopus</I>) said to include right and left.</P>
