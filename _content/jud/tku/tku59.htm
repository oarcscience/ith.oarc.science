<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING THE BEARD OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT ONE.</H3>
<P>150. From the Beard of the Most Holy Ancient One hangeth the whole ornament of all, and the Influence; for all things are called from that beard, Influence.</P>
<P>151. This is the Ornament of all Ornaments, and this influence do all the superiors and inferiors alike behold.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_275"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 275</FONT></A></P>
<P>152. From this Influence dependeth the life of all things.</P>
<P>153, From this Influence heavens and earth depend, the rains of grace, and the nourishment of all things.</P>
<P>154. From this Influence cometh the providence of all things. From this Influence depend all the superior and inferior hosts.</P>
<P>155. Thirteen fountains of excellent and precious oil depend from this beard of most glorious Influence, and they all flow down into Microprosopus.</P>
<P>156. Say not thou, however, that all do so, but nine of them are found (<I>in Microprosopus</I>) for the purpose of diverting the judgments.</P>
<P>157. And whensoever this Influence hangeth down in equilibrium even unto the heart, all the Holinesses of the Holinesses of Holiness depend from it.</P>
<P>158. In that Influence is extended an expansion of the Supernal Emanation,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which is the Head of all Heads, which is not known nor perfected, and which neither superiors nor inferiors have known, because from that Influence all things depend.</P>
<P>159. In this beard the Three Heads concerning which we have spoken are expanded, and all things are associated together in this Influence, and are found therein.</P>
<P>160. And therefore every ornament of ornaments dependeth from that Influence.</P>
<P>161. Those letters which depend from this Ancient One all hang in that beard, and are associated together in that Influence.</P>
<P>162. And they hang therein for the purpose of establishing the other letters.</P>
<P>163. For unless those letters could ascend into the Ancient One, those other letters could not be established.</P>
<P>164. And therefore Moses saith when necessary IHVH,</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_276"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 276</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> IHVH, twice; and so that an accent distinguishes the one from the other.</P>
<P>165. For assuredly from the Influence all things depend.</P>
<P>166. By that Influence are both superiors and inferiors brought into reverence, and are prostrate before It.</P>
<P>167. Blessed is he who attaineth hereunto.</P>
