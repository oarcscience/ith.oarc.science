<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING THE NOSE OF MICROPROSOPUS.</H3>
<P>661. WE have learned it in the "Book of Concealed Mystery." The nose of Microprosopus. From the nose is the countenance known. In this nose is diverse symbolism.</P>
<P>662. For it is written, Ps. xviii. 8: "There went up</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_193"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 193</FONT></A></P>
<P>a smoke out of His nose,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_116"></A><A HREF="#fn_115"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and fire out of His mouth devoured; coals were kindled by it."</P>
<P>663. "There went up a smoke out of His nose." In this smoke are included both the fire and the burning coals; for there is no smoke without fire, neither fire without smoke. Truly all things result (<I>herefrom</I>: otherwise, are kindled <I>herein</I>) and go forth from His nose.</P>
<P>664. Also we have learned that when these three things are associated together which are included in that smoke which issueth from the nose, the nose&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_117"></A><A HREF="#fn_116"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> is lengthened.</P>
<P>665. And therein are two colours, for the smoke bloweth and rusheth forth black and red; and they call it AP,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_118"></A><A HREF="#fn_117"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> <I>Aph</I>, wrath; and ChIMH, <I>Chimah</I>, fervour; and MShChITh, <I>Meshachith</I>, perdition.</P>
<P>666. And if thou sayest wrath and fervour, it is well, since it is written, Deut. ix. 19: "Since I have feared because of wrath and fervour." For these are the black and red smoke. But whence is added MShChITh, <I>Meshachith</I>, perdition?</P>
<P>667. Because it is written, Gen. xiii. 10: "Before that Tetragrammaton destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah." But the word ShChTh, <I>Shachith</I>, denoted perdition brought about by burning, kindled fire.</P>
<P>668. Also we have learned that there are five&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_119"></A><A HREF="#fn_118"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> GBVRAN, Geboran, severities in this conformation of Microprosopus, and they ascend in one thousand and four hundred severities, GBVRAN; and they are extended in</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> His nose, and in His mouth, and in His arms, and in His hands, and in His fingers.</P>
<P>669. And therefore is it written, Ps. cvi. 2: "Who can declare the GBVRVTh, <I>Geburoth</I>, powers of Tetragrammaton?"</P>
<P>670. Hence it is written, "powers" Geburoth (<I>in the plural number</I>); and it is written, 1 Chron. xxix. ii: "Thine! O Tetragrammaton, are Gedulah and Geburah,"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_120"></A><A HREF="#fn_119"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in the singular (<I>number</I>).</P>
<P>671. Assuredly thus have we learned. When all those severities are amalgamated into one, then are they called one Geburah, GBVRH.</P>
<P>672. And all those powers, Geboran, commence to descend from the nose. And from it depend a thousand times a thousand and four hundred myriads in their single (<I>form</I>).&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_121"></A><A HREF="#fn_120"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
<P>673. And from that smoke which issueth from his nose depend a thousand times a thousand myriads, and four hundred and five which belong to this (<I>idea of</I>) Severity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_122"></A><A HREF="#fn_121"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> For all the severities depend from this nose.</P>
<P>674. For it is written, Ps. cxlv. 4: "From generation unto generation shall they praise thy works, and announce thy GBVRVTh, <I>Geburoth</I>."</P>
<P>675. And when that GBVRH, <I>Geburah</I>, Strength, commenceth (<I>to be manifested</I>), all the severities radiate thence, and are sharpened, until they descend in the form of a swift, whirling fire-flaming sword (Gen. iii. 24.)</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_195"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 195</FONT></A></P>
<P>676. It is written, Gen. xix. 13: "For we will destroy this place." Also it is written, Gen. xiii. 10: "Before that Tetragrammaton destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah?" And again, Gen. xix. 24: "Tetragrammaton rained upon Sodom and <A HREF="errata.htm#5">Gomorrah</A>."</P>
<P>677. Assuredly thus have we learned: There is no judge over the wicked, but they themselves convert the measure of Mercy into a measure of judgment.</P>
<P>678. But how do they convert it thus? Also it is written, Mal. iii. 6: "I, Tetragrammaton, change not."</P>
<P>679. Assuredly as many times as the Ancient of the Ancient Ones and that White Head uncovereth the benevolence of benevolences, great mercies are found everywhere.</P>
<P>680. But when that is not uncovered, all the judgments of Microprosopus are prepared; and in this manner, if it be permitted us to say so, Mercy becometh judgment; that is, the most Ancient One of all.</P>
<P>681. We have learned in Barietha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_123"></A><A HREF="#fn_122"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>: "When the Ancient of the Ancient Ones uncovereth the benevolence of benevolences, all those lights which are called by a similar name shine, and Mercy is found in all things."</P>
<P>682. But when that Concealed One of the Concealed Ones is not uncovered, and those lights shine not, judgments are stirred up, and judgment is exercised.</P>
<P>683. Who therefore is the cause of that judgment? The benevolence of the benevolences, because it is not uncovered, and therefore do sinners change Mercy into judgment (<I>as regardeth themselves</I>).</P>
<P>684. But because this is said, Gen. xix. 24: "From Tetragrammaton out of heaven," it is said concerning Zauir Anpin, Microprosopus.</P>
<P>685. And whence is this obtained? Because it is written (<I>in the preceding passage</I>): MN HShMIM, <I>Men Ha-Shamayim</I>, out of heaven. (<I>But the word</P>
</I><P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_196"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 196</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> <I>HShMIM Ha-Shamayim, is equivalent to</I>) ASh VMIM,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_124"></A><A HREF="#fn_123"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <I>Ash Ve-Mim</I>, fire and water, Mercy and judgment, in the antithesis of that (condition) wherein no Judgment is found at all.</P>
<P>686. We have learned that this nose (<I>of Microprosopus</I>) is short,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_125"></A><A HREF="#fn_124"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and when the smoke commenceth to issue therefrom, it departeth thence swiftly, and judgment is exercised.</P>
<P>687. But what hindereth that nose that it may not produce smoke? The nose of the Ancient and Holy One; for He is also called before all others ARK APIM, <I>Arikh Aphim</I>, Long of Nose.</P>
<P>688. And this is the Arcanum which we have learned: Between the two words, IHVH, IHVH, Tetragrammaton, Tetragrammaton, an accent is interpolated&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_126"></A><A HREF="#fn_125"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> (<I>whensoever these two are found in juxtaposition in Scripture</I>).</P>
<P>689. For wheresoever an y name is repeated twice over, a distinction is made (<I>between them</I>), as when it is said, Gen. xxii. 11, "Abraham, Abraham;" also, Gen. xlvi. 2, "Jacob, Jacob;" also, 1 Sam. iii. 10, "Samuel, Samuel;" where, by the <I>Psiq</I> accent, these pairs of names are distinguished; excepting that place, Exod. iii. 4, "Moses, Moses," where no accent interveneth.</P>
<P>690. For what reason? "Abraham, Abraham," Gen. xxii. xx (<I>herein therefore is an accent introduced because</P>
</I><P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_197"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 197</FONT></A></P>
<P><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> <I>that</I>) the latter (<I>of these two names</I>) denoteth that which is perfect, but the former that which is not as yet perfect; for at this time he is perfected with ten temptations, and therefore is the (<I>Psiq</I>) accent interpolated, for. at this time he can hardly be said to be the same man as he was before.</P>
<P>691. (<I>When it is said</I>), "Jacob, Jacob" (Gen. xlvi. 2), the latter denoteth that which is perfect, the former that which is not as yet perfect; for now the messenger had come to him from his son Joseph, and over him was the Schechinah at rest.</P>
<P>692. Also, now at this time was perfected in the earth the holy tree, similar unto the Supernal One, in having twelve limitations and seventy branches,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_127"></A><A HREF="#fn_126"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which were not hitherto completed; and therefore the latter denoteth that which is perfect, and the former that which is not as yet perfect; whence the accent falleth between them.</P>
<P>693. In the passage, "Samuel, Samuel" (1 Sam. iii. 10), an accent is also interpolated: wherefore? The latter name denoteth that which is perfect; the former that which is not as yet perfect; for now he is a prophet, whereas before this he was not as yet a prophet.</P>
<P>694. But when it is said, Exod. iii. 4: "Moses, Moses," no accent is interpolated, because he was perfect from the very day of his birth, seeing it is written, Exod. ii. 2: "And she saw him, that he was good."</P>
<P>695. So also here between these two names of Tetragrammaton, Exod. xxxiv. 6, the <I>Psiq</I> accent is interpolated; for the first is indeed a perfect name, but the latter is thoroughly and completely perfect.</P>
<P>696. But Moses speaketh thus in the place of judgment, in order that for them he may cause Mercy to</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_198"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 198</FONT></A></P>
<P>descend upon Microprosopus from the Most Holy Ancient One.</P>
<P>697. For thus is the tradition. So great was the virtue of Moses that he could make the measures of Mercy descend.</P>
<P>698. And when the Ancient One is uncovered toward Microprosopus all things are beheld in the light of Mercy, and the nose is appeased, and fire and smoke issue not therefrom.</P>
<P>699. Like as it is written, Isa. xlviii. 9: "And with my praise will I defer mine anger for thee."</P>
<P>700. Also we have learned: The nose hath two nostrils. From the one issueth a flaming smoke, and it entereth into the opening of the Great Abyss.</P>
<P>701. And from the other nostril issueth afire which is kindled by its flame; and it floweth into four thousand worlds, which are upon His left side.</P>
<P>702. Truly, he who is the cause of war is called the fire of Tetragrammaton, the consuming fire, the fire which consumeth all other fires.</P>
<P>703. And that fire is not mitigated save by the fire of the altar.</P>
<P>704. And that smoke which issueth forth from the other nostril is not mitigated unless by the smoke of the sacrifice of the altar. But all things depend from the nose.</P>
<P>705. Therefore is it written, Gen. viii. 12: "And Tetragrammaton smelled a sweet savour." For all these are attributed unto the nose, to smell a savour, and to emit smoke and fire, and red colour, and therefore is it opposed unto the benevolence (<I>namely, the forehead</I>).</P>
<P>706. And for that cause is it written, Exod. iv. 14: "And the anger of Tetragrammaton was kindled." Deut. vii. 4: "And the anger of Tetragrammaton will be kindled." Exod. xxii. 24: "And My wrath is kindled." Deut. vi. 15: "Lest the wrath of Tetragrammaton be kindled." Which are all to be understood concerning Zauir Anpin, or Microprosopus.</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_115"></A><A HREF="tku40.htm#fr_116">193:1</A> The ordinary English version renders it "nostrils" and not "nose," but in the Hebrew the word is singular.</P>

ChTM, says the correct rendering is "for my name's sake will I lengthen my nose." Knorr de Rosenroth, in his Latin version of &#167; 664, renders it by, "corrugatur," which is hardly correct.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_117"></A><A HREF="tku40.htm#fr_118">193:3</A> The word AP, Ath, stands alike for the words "nose" and "anger."</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_118"></A><A HREF="tku40.htm#fr_119">193:4</A> if we carefully examine this obscure passage, I think we shall find that the number five is the key to unlock its symbolism; for five is the fifth Sephira, <I>Geburah</I>, GBVRH, Strength or Severity, which operates <A NAME="page_194"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 194</FONT></A> through judgment, and ultimately through the numbers and intelligences of the planet Mars. Now, the 1,400 severities are the fivefold form of RP, <I>Raph</I>, which = the idea of terror. and RP = 280, which x 5 = 1,400. And the least number of 1,400 is 1 + 4 + 0 + 0 = 5. Also 1,400 = ATh = chaos, or substance of anything. Finally, these are extended Into five parts of Macroprosopus--viz., nose, mouth, arms, hands, fingers. And the number 5 = H.</P>

It is represented by a vertical line placed between the two words to which it applies. An example of its use is to be found in Exod. xxxiv. 6: "Tetragrammaton, Tetragrammaton (<I>between these two words a Psiq accent is introduced</I>), merciful and gracious, longsuffering and abundant in goodness and truth." It is worthy of note that the word here translated "long-suffering" is ARK APIM, <I>Arikh Aphim</I>, Long of Nose.</P>
