<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING THE FOREHEAD OF THE MOST HOLY ANCIENT ONE.</H3>
<P>87. THE Forehead, which is uncovered in the Most Holy Ancient One, is called Grace.</P>
<P>88. For that Supernal Head concealed in the Higher, which no man hath known, expandeth a certain external manifestation, beautiful and gracious, which is comprehended in the Forehead.</P>
<P>89. And since He Himself is the grace of all graciousness; hence He assumeth the conformation of the Forehead, which is disclosed in the most intense light (otherwise, hath a formation in the figure of a leaf).</P>
<P>90. And when It is disclosed, the grace of all gracious. ness is found in all worlds.</P>
<P>91. And all the prayers of the Inferiors are accepted; and the countenance of Microprosopus is illuminated, and all things are found to exist in mercy.</P>
<P>92. And since (<I>through this</I>) all judgments are hidden</P>
<P></P>
<P>and subjected, hence in the Sabbath, in the time of the afternoon prayers, in which all judgments are excited, that Forehead is disclosed.</P>
<P>93. And all the judgments are turned aside, and mercies are found.</P>
<P>94. And therefore is the Sabbath found without judgment, as well that which is above as that which is below; also the fire of Gehenna is restrained in its place, and the transgressors are at rest.</P>
<P>95. And therefore is the Spirit, NShMTh, of joy added on the Sabbath.</P>
<P>96. And it behoveth man to rejoice with three feasts on the Sabbath; for all truth, and the whole system of truer faith, is found therein (<I>i.e., in the Sabbath</I>).</P>
<P>97. And it behoveth man to prepare the table, that he may eat in the three feasts of true faith, and rejoice in them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></P>
<P>98. Rabbi Schimeon said: "I attest concerning myself, before all these who are here present, that through all my days I have not omitted these three feasts, and that because of them I have not been compelled to fast on the Sabbath.</P>
<P>99. "Furthermore, also on other days I have not been compelled (<I>to fast</I>), much less on the Sabbath, for he who, rightly acteth concerning these (<I>feasts</I>) is the adept of perfect truth.</P>
<P>100. "The first feast is that of the Great Mother; the second that of the Holy King; and the third that of the Most Holy Ancient One, the Concealed with all Concealments.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
<P>101. "And in this world, who can thoroughly follow out, through them, those paths?</P>

<P>102. "If this RTzVN, <I>Ratzon</I>, Grace, be revealed, all those judgments are enlightened, and are diverted from their concentrated rigour.</P>
<P>103. "The conformation of Him, the Most Holy Ancient One, is instituted through one form, which is the ideal Syntagma of all forms.</P>
<P>104. "The same is the Concealed Supernal Wisdom, the synthesis of all the rest.</P>
<P>105. "And this is called ODN, <I>Eden</I>, or the supernal Paradise, concealed with all occultations.</P>
<P>106. "And it is the Brain of the Most Holy Ancient One, and that Brain is expanded on every side.</P>
<P>107. "Therefore is it extended into Eden, or another Paradise,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and from this is Eden or Paradise formed forth.</P>
<P>108. "And when this Head, which is concealed in the Head of the Ancient One, which is not known, extendeth a certain frontal formation, which is formed for brilliance, then flasheth forth the Lightning of His Brain.</P>
<P>109. And it is formed forth and illuminated with many Lights.</P>
<P>110. And it produceth and designeth (<I>a certain effect</I>) in this Light (otherwise, in this opening), in this Forehead, whereon is inscribed a certain Light, which is called RTzVN, <I>Ratzon</I>, Grace.</P>
<P>111. "And that Grace is extended backward into the beard, even unto that place where it can remain in the beard, and it is called the Supernal, ChSD, <I>Chesed</I>, Mercy.</P>
<P>112. "And when this Grace is uncovered, all the Lords of Judgment behold It, and are turned aside."</P>
