<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">CONCERNING THE THIRTEENTH PART OF THE BEARD OF MACROPROSOPUS.</H3>
<P>466. THE thirteenth conformation. The hairs which are beneath the beard hang down on this side and on that in beautiful and excellent dignity, and form a covering even unto the chest, and nothing is seen of the countenance and of the places of fragrance save those two brilliant and beautiful apples.</P>
<P>467. Rabbi Schimeon spake and said: "O how blessed is his portion who is found in this excellent holy assembly,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_72"></A><A HREF="#fn_71"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> wherein we are (assembled)! Blessed is his portion in this world and in the world to come.</P>
<P>468. "For we are seated in that excellent holiness which surroundeth us.</P>
<P>469. "And all those excellent conformations are coordinated, and crowned, and placed round about, each in its own (<I>proper</I>) position, in the holy form of the beard.</P>
<P>470. "And this thirteenth disposition is the beautiful disposition which exciteth in itself so great desire that the head&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_73"></A><A HREF="#fn_72"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> ariseth towards it.</P>
<P>471. "From it depend all those which are comprehended in Microprosopus; from it depend alike those which are supernal, those which are inferior.</P>
<P>472. "This is the form of perfection which consummateth</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_167"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 167</FONT></A></P>
<P>all the dispositions, and which perfecteth all things.</P>
<P>473. "We have learned by tradition. Those parts&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_74"></A><A HREF="#fn_73"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> are called QDM, <I>Qadam</I>,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_75"></A><A HREF="#fn_74"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> ancient days, days first of the first. But those which are found in Microprosopus are called OVLM, Olahm, everlasting days, or days of the ages.</P>
<P>474. "Also we have learned that those QDM, <I>Qadam</I>, ancient days, are all conformed in the conformations of the beard, wherein is composed the Ancient of the Ancient Ones, the Concealed of the Concealed Ones. But this thirteenth (<I>conformation</I>) comprehendeth them.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_76"></A><A HREF="#fn_75"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></P>
<P>475. "And all the concealed superiors and inferiors are concealed in it, and they are comprehended in that influx from which all things emanate; like as it is said:</P>
<P>476. "And that day is not comprehended in them, seeing it comprehendeth all things.</P>
<P>477. "And in that time wherein is stirred up the Ancient of Days in the superior conformations, that is called one day wherein He ariseth to magnify His beard.</P>
<P>478. "Which is intimated in those words, Zech. xiv. 7: 'One day which is known to the Lord.'</P>
<P>479. "That alone prevaileth over all, that includeth all things that is called by the known name.</P>
<P>480. "For thus we have learned. In that place where there is day there is also night, seeing that day cannot exist without night.</P>
<P>481. "But because in that time shall be the time of the dignity of the beard, that day is found alone.</P>
<P>482. "It is called neither day nor night, for it is not</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_168"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 168</FONT></A></P>
<P>called day except for our (<I>better understanding of the symbolism involved</I>), neither is it called night except for the same reason.</P>
<P>483. "And because that form includeth all things, hence nothing whatsoever is known or seen concerning it.</P>
<P>484. "And from it streameth down the oil of magnificence in thirteen directions, which flow down upon all the inferiors in order that they may shine forth.</P>
<P>485. "In that oil are consummated the thirteen parts of the holy and excellent beard.</P>
<P>486. "And those forms which are in that beard are disposed and descend in many directions, neither can it be seen how they are extended nor how they arise.</P>
<P>487. "They are hidden in all things, and they are concealed in all things; and no man knoweth their place, except Him, the Ancient One.</P>
<P>488. "In their expansion are they all included, like as it is said:</P>
<P>489. "He is known, and He is not known; He is concealed, and He is manifest.</P>
<P>490. "Concerning Him it is written. Isa. xlii. 8: 'ANI IHVH HVA&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_77"></A><A HREF="#fn_76"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, <I>Ani Tetragrammaton Hoa</I>, This is My name, and My glory I give not unto another.'</P>
<P>491. "Also it is written, Ps. c. 2: 'HVA, <I>Hoa</I>, He, hath made us, and not we ourselves.'</P>
<P>492. "Also it is written, Dan. vii. 9: 'The Ancient of Days did sit,' that is, He remained in His place, and Him hath no man known. He sitteth, but He is not found.</P>
<P>493. "Also it is written, Ps. cxxxix. 14: 'I will praise Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.'"</P>

<P><A NAME="fn_71"></A><A HREF="tku31.htm#fr_72">166:1</A> Because this assembly of ten Rabbis, as I have before remarked, was intended to typify the ten Sephiroth and their grouping.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_72"></A><A HREF="tku31.htm#fr_73">166:2</A> This somewhat obscure text means this: The number of the parts of the beard are 13, which are now completed in this disposition. But 13 = AChD, <I>Achad</I>, Unity, and also AHBH, <I>Ahebah</I>, Love. Hence love of unity ariseth when the 13 are complete. And the head of Macroprosopus ariseth, because that is Kether, the first Sephira, the number one, unity.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_73"></A><A HREF="tku31.htm#fr_74">167:1</A> That is, the thirteen conformations of the beard.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_74"></A><A HREF="tku31.htm#fr_75">167:2</A> And hence is Macroprosopus called the "Ancient of Days." Qadam also means the east, eastward. "Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a garden, MQDM, <I>Miqedem</I>, eastward (or of ancient time), in Eden." It is worthy of notice that the Gematria of QDM and OVLM are 144 and 146 respectively; the least numbers of which are 9 and 2--Yesod and Chokmah, foundation and wisdom.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_75"></A><A HREF="tku31.htm#fr_76">167:3</A> By way of synthesis, as if it were a repetition of the rest conjointly.</P>
<P><A NAME="fn_76"></A><A HREF="tku31.htm#fr_77">168:1</A> There are 10 letters in this phrase = 10 Sephiroth. "Ani Tetragrammaton Hoa, This is My name;" for in this are contained Macroprosopus, Microprosopus and the Tetragrammaton. ANI represents Microprosopus; HVA represents Macroprosopus and is also ABA the Father; and IHVH is between them. Ani is 61 and ABA is 4 which together give 65, which is ADNI, <I>Adonai</I>, Lord; and IHVH = 26, which added hereunto is 91 = AMN, <I>Amen</I>. Now, apart from the sacred ideas we attach to Amen, it is well to know that the ancient Egyptians called their greatest Deity <I>Amen</I>, AMN, Amen-Ra. and Ra = Light, AVR in Hebrew; Amen our Light, the light of the two countenances.</P>
