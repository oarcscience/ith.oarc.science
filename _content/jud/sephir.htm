 <CENTER><P>(Translated from the Hebrew by Wm. Wynn Westcott)</P></CENTER>
 
 <P>(NOTE: The <I>Sepher Yetzirah</I> is one of the most famous of the ancient
 Qabalistic texts. It was first put into writing around 200 C.E. Westcott's
 Translation of the Sepher Yetzirah was a primary source for the rituals
 and Knowledge Lectures of the Golden Dawn. This is the Third Edition of
 Westcott's translation, first published in 1887.</P>
 
 <HR>  
 <CENTER><P><B>INTRODUCTION</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>The &quot;Sepher Yetzirah,&quot; or &quot;Book of Formation,&quot; is
 perhaps the oldest Rabbinical treatise of Kabalistic philosophy which is
 still extant. The great interest which has been evinced of 1ate years in
 the Hebrew Kabalah, and the modes of thought and doctrine allied to it,
 has induced me to translate this tractate from the original Hebrew texts,
 and to collate with them the Latin versions of mediaeval authorities; and
 I have also published <I>An Introduction to the Kabalah</I> which may be
 found useful to students.</P>
 
 <P>Three important books of the &quot;Zohar,&quot; or &quot;Book of Splendour,&quot;
 which is a great storehouse of Kabalistic teaching, have been translated
 into English by S. L. MacGregor Mathers, and the &quot;Sepher Yetzirah&quot;
 in an English translation is almost a necessary companion to these abstruse
 disquisitions: the two books indeed mutually explain each other.</P>
 
 <P>The &quot;Sepher Yetzirah,&quot; although this name means &quot;The
 Book of Formation,&quot; is not in any sense a narrative of Creation, or
 a substitute Genesis, but is an ancient and instructive philosophical treatise
 upon one aspect of the origin of the universe and mankind; an aspect at
 once archaic and essentially Hebrew. The grouping of the processes of origin
 into an arrangement, at once alphabetic and numeral, is one only to be
 found in Semitic authors.</P>
 
 <P>Attention must be called to the essential peculiarity of the Hebrew
 language, the inextricable and necessary association of numbers and letters;
 every letter suggesting a number, and every group of letters having a numerical
 signification, as vital as its literal meaning.</P>
 
 <P>The Kabalistic principles involved in the reversal of Hebrew letters,
 and their substitution by others, on definite schemes, should also be studied
 and borne in mind.</P>
 
 <P>It is exactly on these principles that the &quot;ground-work idea&quot;
 'of this disquisition rests; and these principles may be traced throughout
 the Kabalistic tractates which have succeeded it in point of time and development,
 many of which are associated together in one volume known as the &quot;Zohar,&quot;
 which is in the main concerned with the essential dignities of the Godhead,
 with the Emanations which have sprung therefrom, with the doctrine of the
 Sephiroth, the ideals of Macroprosopus and Microprosopus, and the doctrine
 of Re-incarnation.</P>
 
 <P>The &quot;Sepher Yetzirah,&quot; on the other hand, is mainly concerned
 with our universe and with the Microcosm. The opinions of Hebrew Kabalistic
 Rabbis and of modern mystics may be fitly introduced here.</P>
 
 <P>The following interesting quotation is from Rabbi Moses Botarel, who
 wrote his famous Commentary in 1409:--&quot;It was Abraham our Father--blessed
 be he--who wrote this book to condemn the doctrine of the sages of his
 time, who were incredulous of the supreme dogma of the Unity. At least,
 this was the opinion of Rabbi Saadiah--blessed be he--as written in the
 first chapter of his book <I>The Philosopher's Stone</I>. These are his
 words: The sages of Babylon attacked Abraham on account of his faith; for
 they were all against him although themselves separable into three sects.
 The First thought that the Universe was subject to the control of two opposing
 forces, the one existing but to destroy the other, this is dualism; they
 held that there was nothing in common between the author of evil and the
 author of good. The Second sect admitted Three great Powers; two of them
 as in the first case, and a third Power whose function was to decide between
 the two others, a supreme arbitrator. The Third sect recognised no god
 beside the Sun, in which it recognised the sole principle of existence.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>Rabbi Judah Ha L&eacute;vi (who flourished about 1120), in his critical
 description of this treatise, wrote: &quot;The Sepher Yetzirah teaches
 us the existence of a Single Divine Power by shewing us that in the bosom
 of variety and multiplicity there is a Unity and Harmony, and that such
 universal concord could only arise from the rule of a Supreme Unity.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>According to Isaac Myer, in his <I>Quabbalah</I> (p. 159), the &quot;Sepher
 Yetzirah&quot; was referred to in the writings of Ibn Gebirol of Cordova,
 commonly called Avicebron, who died in A.D. 1070.</P>
 
 <P>Eliphas Levi, the famous French Occultist, thus wrote of the &quot;Sepher
 Yetzirah,&quot; in his <I>Histoire de la Magie</I>, p. 54: &quot;The Zohar
 is a Genesis of illumination, the Sepher Jezirah is a ladder formed of
 truths. Therein are explained the thirty-two absolute signs of sounds,
 numbers and letters: each letter reproduces a number, an idea and a form;
 so that mathematics are capable of application to ideas and to forms not
 less rigorously than to numbers, by exact proportion and perfect correspondence.
 By the science of the Sepher Jezirah the human spirit is fixed to truth,
 and in reason, and is able to take account of the possible development
 of intelligence by the evolutions of numbers. The Zohar represents absolute
 truth, and the Sepher Jezirah provides the means by which we may seize,
 appropriate and make use of it.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>Upon another page Eliphas L&eacute;vi writes: &quot;The Sepher Jezirah
 and the Apocalypse are the masterpieces of Occultism; they contain more
 wisdom than words; their expression is as figurative as poetry, and at
 the same time it is as exact as mathematics.</P>
 
 <P>In the volume entitled <I>La Kabbale</I> by the eminent French scholar,
 Adolphe Franck, there is a chapter on the &quot;Sepher Yetzirah.&quot;
 He writes as follows:--</P>
 
 <P>&quot;The Book of Formation contains, I will not say system of physics,
 but of cosmology such as could be conceived at an age and in a country
 where the habit of explaining all phenomena by the immediate action of
 the First Cause, tended to check the spirit of observation, and where in
 consequence certain general and superficial relations perceived in the
 natural world passed for the science of Nature.&quot;…&quot;Its form is
 simple and grave; there is nothing like a demonstration nor an argument;
 but it consists rather of a series of aphorisms, regularly grouped, and
 which have all the conciseness of the most ancient oracles.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>In his analysis of the &quot;Sepher Yetzirah,&quot; he adds:--&quot;The
 Book of Formation, even if it be not very voluminous, and if it do not
 altogether raise us to very elevated regions of thought, yet offers us
 at least a composition which is very homogeneous and of a rare originality.
 The clouds which the imagination of commentators have gathered around it,
 will be dissipated, if we look for, in it, not mysteries of ineffable wisdom,
 but an attempt at a reasonable doctrine, made when reason arose, an effort
 to grasp the plan of the universe, and to secure the link which binds to
 one common principle, all the elements which are around us.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>&quot;The last word of this system is the substitution of the absolute
 divine Unity for every idea of Dualism, for that pagan philosophy which
 saw in matter an eternal substance whose laws were not in accord with Divine
 Will; and for the Biblical doctrine, which by its idea of Creation, postulates
 two things, the Universe and God, as two substances absolutely distinct
 one from the other.</P>
 
 <P>&quot;In fact, in the 'Sepher Yetzirah,' God considered as the Infinite
 and consequently the indefinable Being, extended throughout all things
 by his power and existence, is while above, yet not outside of numbers,
 sounds and letters--the principles and general laws which we recognise.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>&quot;Every element has its source from a higher form, and all things
 have their common origin from the Word (<I>Logos</I>), the Holy Spirit….
 So God is at once, in the highest sense, both the matter and the form of
 the universe. Yet He is not <I>only</I> that form; for nothing can or does
 exist outside of Himself; His substance is the foundation of all, and all
 things bear His imprint and are symbols of His intelligence.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>Hebrew tradition assigns the doctrines of the oldest portions of the
 &quot;Zohar&quot; to a date antecedent to the building of the Second Temple,
 but Rabbi Simeon ben Jochai, who lived in the reign of the Emperor Titus,
 A.D. 70-80, is considered to have been the first to commit these to writing,
 and Rabbi Moses de Leon, of Guadalaxara, in Spain, who died in 1305, certainly
 reproduced and published the &quot;Zohar.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>Ginsburg, speaking of the Zoharic doctrines of the Ain Suph, says that
 they were unknown until the thirteenth century, but he does not deny the
 great antiquity of the &quot;Sepher Yetzirah,&quot; in which it will be
 noticed the &quot;Ain Suph Aur&quot; and &quot;Ain Suph&quot; are not mentioned.I
 suggest, however, that this omission is no proof that the doctrines of
 &quot;Ain Suph Aur&quot; and &quot;Ain Suph&quot; did not then exist, because
 it is a reasonable supposition that the &quot;Sepher Yetzirah&quot; was
 the volume assigned to the Yetziratic World, the third of the four Kabalistic
 Worlds of Emanation, while the &quot;Asch Metzareph&quot; is concerned
 with the Assiatic, fourth, or lowest World of Shells, and is on the face
 of it an alchemical treatise; and again the &quot;Siphra Dtzenioutha&quot;
 may be fittingly considered to be an Aziluthic work, treating of the Emanations
 of Deity alone; and there was doubtless a fourth work assigned to the World
 of Briah--the second type, but I have not been able to identify this treatise.
 Both the Babylonian and the Jerusalem Talmuds refer to the &quot;Sepher
 Yetzirah.&quot; Their treatise, named &quot;Sanhedrin,&quot; certainly
 mentions the &quot;Book of Formation,&quot; and another similar work; and
 Rashi in his commentary on the treatise &quot;Erubin,&quot; considers this
 a reliable historical notice.Other historical notices are those of Saadya
 Gaon, who died A.D. 940, and Judah Ha Levi, A.D. 1150; both these Hebrew
 classics speak of it as a very ancient work. Some modern critics have attributed
 the authorship to the Rabbi Akiba, who lived in the time of the Emperor
 Hadrian, A.D. 120, and lost his life in supporting the claims of Barchocheba,
 a false messiah: others suggest it was first written about A.D. 200.</P>
 
 <P>Graetz however assigns it to early Gnostic times, third or fourth century,
 and Zunz speaks of it as post Talmudical, and belonging to the Geonim period
 700-800 A.D.; Rubinsohn, in the <I>Bibliotheca Sacra</I>, speaks of this
 latter idea as having no real basis.</P>
 
 <P>The Talmuds were first collected into a concrete whole, and printed
 in Venice, 1520 A.D.</P>
 
 <P>The &quot;Zohar&quot; was first printed in Mantua in 1558; again in
 Cremona, 1560; and at Lublin, 1623; and a fourth edition by Knorr von Rosenroth,
 at Sulzbach in 1684. Some parts are not very ancient, because the Crusades
 are mentioned in one chapter. Six extant Hebrew editions of the &quot;Sepher
 Yetzirah&quot; were collected and printed at Lemberg in 1680. The oldest
 of these six recensions was that of Saadjah Gaon (by some critics called
 spurious).There are still extant three Latin versions, <I>viz</I>., that
 of Gulielmus Postellus; one by Johann Pistorius; and a third by Joannes
 Stephanus Rittangelius; this latter gives both Hebrew and Latin versions,
 and also &quot;The Thirty-Two Paths&quot; as a supplement.</P>
 
 <P>There is a German translation, by Johann Friedrich von Meyer, dated
 1830; a version by Isidor Kalisch, in which he has reproduced many of the
 valuable annotations of Meyer; an edition in French by Papus, 1888; an
 edition in French by Mayer Lambert, 1891, with the Arabic Commentary of
 Saadya Gaon; and an English edition by Peter Davidson, 1896, to which are
 added &quot;The Fifty Gates of Intelligence&quot; and &quot;The Thirty-Two
 Ways of Wisdom.&quot; The edition which I now offer is fundamentally that
 of the ancient Hebrew codices translated into English, and collated with
 the Latin versions of Pistorius, Postellus, and Rittangelius, following
 the latter, rather than the former commentators. As to the authenticity
 of &quot;The Sepher Yetzirah,&quot; students may refer to the <I>Bibliotheca
 magna Rabbinica</I> of Bartoloccio de Cellerio, Rome, 1678-1692; to Basnage,
 <I>History of the Jews</I>, 1708; and to <I>The Doctrine and Literature
 of the Kabalah</I>, by A. B. Waite, 1902.The following copies of the &quot;Sepher
 Yetzirah&quot; in Hebrew, I have also examined, but only in a superficial
 manner:--</P>
 
 <P>1. A Version by Saadiah, Ab. ben David, and three others, Mantua, 1562,
 4to.</P>
 
 <P>2. A Version with the commentary of Rabbi Abraham F. Dior, Amsterdam,
 1642, 4to.</P>
 
 <P>3. A Version with preface by M. ben J. Chagiz, Amsterdam, 1713, 16mo.4.
 A Version, Constantinople, 1719, 8vo.</P>
 
 <P>5. &quot; &quot; Zolkiew, 1745, 4to.</P>
 
 <P>6. &quot; &quot; by Moses ben Jacob, Zozec, 1779, 4to.</P>
 
 <P>7. &quot; &quot; Grodno, 1806, 4to.</P>
 
 <P>8. &quot; &quot; Dyhernfurth, 1812, 8vo.</P>
 
 <P>9. &quot; &quot; Salonica, 1831, 8vo.</P>
 
 <P>10. A MS. copy dated 1719, in the British Museum.</P>
 
 <P>I add here the full titles of the three Latin versions; they are all
 to be found in the British Museum Library.</P>
 
 <P>&quot;Abrahami Patriarchae Liber Jezirah sive Formationis Mundi, Patribus
 quidem Abrahami tempora praecedentibus revelatus, sed ab ipso etiam Abrahamo
 expositus Isaaco, et per pro prophetarum manus posteritati conservatus,
 ipsis autem 72 Mosis auditoribus in secundo divinae veritatis loco, hoc
 est in ratione, quoe est posterior authoritate, habitus.&quot; Parisiis,
 1552. Gulielmus Postellus.&quot;Id est Liber Jezirah, qui Abrahamo, Patriarchae
 adscribitur, una cum Commentario Rabbi Abraham F.D. super 32 semitis Sapientiae,
 a quibus Liber Jezirah incipit: Translatus et notis illustratus a Joanne
 Stephano Rittangelio, Ling. Orient. in Elect. Acad. Regiomontana Prof.
 Extraord,&quot; Amstelodami, 1642.In Tomas Primus of &quot;Artis Cabalisticae
 hoc est reconditae theologiae et philosophiae scriptorum.&quot; Basileae
 1587, is found &quot;Liber de Creatione Cabalistinis, Hebraice Sepher Jezira;
 Authore Abrahamo. Successive filiis ore traditus. Hinc jam rebus Israel
 inclinatis ne deficeret per sapientes Hierusalem arcanis et profundissimis
 sensibus literis commendatus.&quot; Johannes Pistorius.</P>
 
 <P>The &quot;Sepher Yetzirah&quot; consists of six chapters, having 33
 paragraphs distributed among them, in this manner: the first has 12, then
 follow 5, 5, 4, 3, and 4. </P>
 
 <P>Yet in some versions the paragraphs and subject-matter are found in
 a different arrangement. The oldest title has, as an addition, the words,
 &quot;The Letters of our Father Abraham&quot; or &quot;ascribed to the
 patriarch Abraham,&quot; and it is spoken of as such by many mediaeval
 authorities: but this origin is doubtless fabulous, although perhaps not
 more improbable than the supposed authorship of the &quot;Book of Enoch,&quot;
 mentioned by St. Jude, of which two MSS. copies in the Ethiopic language
 were rescued from the wilds of Abyssinia in 1773 by the great traveller
 James Bruce. In essence this work was, doubtless, the crystallisation of
 centuries of tradition, by one writer, and it has been added to from time
 to time, by later authors, who have also revised it. Some of the additions,
 which were rejected even by mediaeval students, I have not incorporated
 with the text at all, and I present in this volume only the undoubted kernel
 of this occult nut, upon which many great authorities, Hebrew, German,
 Jesuit and others, have written long Commentaries, and yet have failed
 to explain satisfactorily. I find Kalisch, speaking of these Commentaries,
 says, &quot;they contain nothing but a medley of arbitrary explanations,
 and sophistical distortions of scriptural verses, astrological notions,
 Oriental superstitions, a metaphysical jargon, a poor knowledge of physics,
 and not a correct elucidation of this ancient book.&quot; Kalisch, however,
 was not an occultist; these commentaries are, however, so extensive as
 to demand years of study, and I feel no hesitation in confessing that my
 researches into them have been but superficial. For convenience of study
 I have placed the Notes in a separate form at the end of the work, and
 I have made a short definition of the subject-matter of each chapter. The
 substance of this little volume was read as Lecture before &quot;The Hermetic
 Society of London,&quot; in the summer of 1886, Dr. Anna Kingsford, President,
 in the chair. Some of the Notes were the explanations given verbally, and
 subsequently in writing, to members of the Society who asked for information
 upon abstruse points in the &quot;Sepher,&quot; and for collateral doctrines;
 others, of later date, are answers which have been given to students of
 Theosophy and Hermetic philosophy, and to my pupils of the Study Groups
 of the Rosicrucian Society of England.</P>

 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER I</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>Section 1. In thirty-two <SUP>(1)</SUP> mysterious Paths of Wisdom did
 Jah, <SUP>(2)</SUP> the Jehovah of hosts,<SUP> (3)</SUP> the God of Israel,<SUP>
 (4)</SUP> the Living Elohim,<SUP> (5)</SUP> the King of ages, the merciful
 and gracious God,<SUP> (6)</SUP> the Exalted One, the Dweller in eternity,
 most high and holy--engrave his name by the three Sepharim<SUP> (7</SUP>)
 --Numbers, Letters, and Sounds.<SUP>(8)</SUP></P>
 
 <P>2. Ten are the ineffable Sephiroth.<SUP> (9)</SUP> Twenty-two are the
 Letters, the Foundation of all things; there are Three Mothers, Seven Double
 and Twelve <SUP>(10)</SUP> Simple letters.</P>
 
 <P>3. The ineffable Sephiroth are Ten, as are the Numbers; and as there
 are in man five fingers over against five, so over them is established
 a covenant of strength, by word of mouth, and by the circumcision of the
 flesh.<SUP> (11)</SUP> </P>
 
 <P>4. Ten is the number of the ineffable Sephiroth, ten and not nine, ten
 and not eleven. Understand this wisdom, and be wise by the perception.
 Search out concerning it, restore the Word to its creator, and replace
 Him who formed it upon his throne.<SUP> (12)</SUP></P>
 
 <P>5. The Ten ineffable Sephiroth have ten vast regions bound unto them;
 boundless in origin and having no ending; an abyss<SUP> (13) </SUP>of good
 and of ill; measureless height and depth; boundless to the East and the
 West; boundless to the North and South;<SUP> (14)</SUP> and the Lord the
 only God,<SUP> (15)</SUP> the Faithful King rules all these from his holy
 seat,<SUP> (16)</SUP> for ever and ever.</P>
 
 <P>6. The Ten ineffable Sephiroth have the appearance of the Lightning
 flash,<SUP> (17)</SUP> their origin is unseen and no end is perceived.
 The Word is in them as they rush forth and as they return, they speak as
 from the whirl-wind, and returning fall prostrate in adoration before the
 Throne.</P>
 
 <P>7. The Ten ineffable Sephiroth, whose ending is even as their origin,
 are like as a flame arising from a burning coal. For God<SUP> (18)</SUP>
 is superlative in his Unity, there is none equal unto Him: what number
 canst thou place before One.</P>
 
 <P>8. Ten are the ineffable Sephiroth; seal up thy lips lest thou speak
 of them, and guard thy heart as thou considerest them; and if thy mind
 escape from thee bring it back to thy control; even as it was said, &quot;running
 and returning&quot; (the living creatures ran and returned)<SUP> (19)</SUP>
 and hence was the Covenant made.</P>
 
 <P>9. The ineffable Sephiroth give forth the Ten numbers. First; the Spirit
 of the God of the living;<SUP> (20)</SUP> Blessed and more than blessed
 be the Living God<SUP> (21)</SUP> of ages. The Voice, the Spirit, and the
 Word,<SUP> (22)</SUP> these are the Holy Spirit.</P>
 
 <P>10. Second; from the Spirit He produced Air, and formed in it twenty-two
 sounds--the letters; three are mothers, seven are double, and twelve are
 simple; but the Spirit is first and above these. Third; from the Air He
 formed the Waters, and from the formless and void<SUP> (23)</SUP> made
 mire and clay, and designed surfaces upon them, and hewed recesses in them,
 and formed the strong material foundation. Fourth; from the Water He formed
 Fire <SUP>(24)</SUP> and made for Himself a Throne of Glory with Auphanim,
 Seraphim and Kerubim,<SUP> (25)</SUP> as his ministering angels; and with
 these three <SUP>(26)</SUP> he completed his dwelling, as it is written,
 &quot;Who maketh his angels spirits and his ministers a flaming fire.&quot;<SUP>
 (27)</SUP></P>
 
 <P>11. He selected three letters from among the simple ones and sealed
 them and formed them into a Great Name, I H V,<SUP> (28)</SUP> and with
 this He sealed the universe in six directions.</P>
 
 <P>Fifth; He looked above, and sealed the Height with I H V.</P>
 
 <P>Sixth; He looked below, and sealed the Depth with I V H.</P>
 
 <P>Seventh; He looked forward, and sealed the East with H I V.</P>
 
 <P>Eighth; He looked backward, and sealed the West with H V I.</P>
 
 <P>Ninth; He looked to the right, and sealed the South with V I H.</P>
 
 <P>Tenth; He looked to the left, and sealed the North with V H I.</P>
 
 <P>12. Behold! From the Ten ineffable Sephiroth do, proceed--the One Spirit
 of the Gods of the living, Air, Water, Fire; and also Height, Depth, East,
 West, South and North. <SUP>(29)</SUP></P>
 
 <CENTER><P>_______________________________________________________________________</P></CENTER>
 
 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER II</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>Section 1. The twenty-two sounds and letters are the Foundation of all
 things. Three mothers, seven doubles and twelve simples. The Three Mothers
 are Aleph, Mem and Shin, they are Air, Water and Fire Water is silent,
 Fire is sibilant, and Air derived from the Spirit is as the tongue of a
 balance standing between these contraries which are in equilibrium, reconciling
 and mediating between them.</P>
 
 <P>2. He hath formed, weighed, and composed with these twenty-two letters
 every created thing, and the form of everything which shall hereafter be.
 </P>
 
 <P>3. These twenty-two sounds or letters are formed by the voice, impressed
 on the air, and audibly modified in five places; in the throat, in the
 mouth, by the tongue, through the teeth, and by the lips.<SUP> (31)</SUP></P>
 
 <P>4. These twenty-two letters, which are the foundation of all things,
 He arranged as upon a sphere with two hundred and thirty-one gates, and
 the sphere may be rotated forward or backward, whether for good or for
 evil; from the good comes true pleasure, from evil nought but torment.</P>
 
 <P>5. For He shewed the combination of these letters, each with the other;
 Aleph with all, and all with Aleph; Beth with all, and all with Beth. Thus
 in combining all together in pairs are produced the two hundred and thirty-one
 gates of knowledge. <SUP>(32)</SUP></P>
 
 <P>6. And from the non-existent<SUP> (33) </SUP>He made Something; and
 all forms of speech and everything that has been produced; from the empty
 void He made the material world, and from the inert earth He brought forth
 everything that hath life. He hewed, as it were, vast columns out of the
 intangible air, and by the power of His Name made every creature and everything
 that is; and the production of all things from the twenty-two letters is
 the proof that they are all but parts of one living body.<SUP> (34)</SUP></P>

 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER III</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>Section 1. The Foundation of all the other sounds and letters is provided
 by the Three Mothers, Aleph, Mem and Shin; they resemble a Balance, on
 the one hand the guilty, on the other hand the purified, and Aleph the
 Air is like the Tongue of a Balance standing between them.<SUP> (35)</SUP></P>
 
 <P>2. The Three Mothers, Aleph, Mem and Shin, are a great Mystery, very
 admirable and most recondite, and sealed as with six rings; and from them
 proceed Air, Fire, and Water, which divide into active and passive forces.
 The Three Mothers, Aleph, Mem and Shin, are the Foundation, from them spring
 three Fathers, and from these have proceeded all things that are in the
 world.</P>
 
 <P>3. The Three Mothers in the world are Aleph, Mem and Shin: the heavens<SUP>
 (36)</SUP> were produced<SUP> (37)</SUP> from Fire; the earth from the
 Water; and the Air from the Spirit is as a reconciler between the Fire
 and the Water.</P>
 
 <P>4. The Three Mothers, Aleph, Mem and Shin, Fire, Water and Air, are
 shown in the Year: from the fire came heat, from the waters came cold,
 and from the air was produced the temperate state, again a mediator between
 them. The Three Mothers, Aleph, Mem and Shin, Fire, Water and Air, are
 found in Man: from the fire was formed the head; from the water the belly;
 and from the air was formed the chest, again placed as a mediator between
 the others.</P>
 
 <P>5. These Three Mothers did He produce and design, and combined them;
 and He sealed them as the three mothers in the Universe, in the Year and
 in Man--both male and female. He caused the letter Aleph to reign in Air
 and crowned it, and combining it with the others He sealed it, as Air in
 the World, as the temperate (climate) of the Year, and as the breath in
 the chest (the lungs for breathing air) in Man: the male with Aleph, Mem,
 Shin, the female with Shin, Mem, Aleph. He caused the letter Mem to reign
 in Water, crowned it, and combining it with the others formed the earth
 in the world, cold in the year, and the belly in man, male and female,
 the former with Mem, Aleph, Shin, the latter with Mem, Shin, Aleph. He
 caused Shin to reign in Fire, and crowned it, and combining it with the
 others sealed with it the heavens in the universe, heat in the year and
 the head in man, male and female.<SUP> (38)</SUP></P>

 <P>Section 1. The Seven double letters, Beth, Gimel, Daleth, Kaph, Peh,
 Resh, and Tau have each two sounds associated with them. They are referred
 to Life, Peace, Wisdom, Riches, Grace, Fertility and Power. The two sounds
 of each letter are the hard and the soft--the aspirated and the softened.
 They are called Double, because each letter presents a contrast or permutation;
 thus Life and Death; Peace and War; Wisdom and Folly; Riches and Poverty;
 Grace and Indignation; Fertility and Solitude; Power and Servitude.</P>
 
 <P>2. These Seven Double Letters point out seven localities; Above, Below,
 East, West, North, South, and the Palace of Holiness in the midst of them
 sustaining all things.</P>
 
 <P>3. These Seven Double Letters He designed, produced, and combined, and
 formed with them the Planets of this World, the Days of the Week, and the
 Gates of the soul (the orifices of perception) in Man. From these Seven
 He bath produced the Seven Heavens, the Seven Earths, the Seven Sabbaths:
 for this cause He has loved and blessed the number Seven more than all
 things under Heaven (His Throne).</P>
 
 <P>4. Two Letters produce two houses; three form six; four form twenty-four;
 five form one hundred and twenty; six form seven hundred and twenty; <SUP>(39)</SUP>
 seven form five thousand and forty; and beyond this their numbers increase
 so that the mouth can hardly utter them, nor the ear hear the number of
 them. So now, behold the Stars of our World, the Planets which are Seven;
 the Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon, Saturn, Jupiter and Mars. The Seven are
 also the Seven Days of Creation; and the Seven Gateways of the Soul of
 Man--the two eyes, the two ears, the mouth and the two nostrils. So with
 the Seven are formed the seven heavens,<SUP> (41)</SUP> the seven earths,
 and the seven periods of time; and so has He preferred the number Seven
 above all things under His Heaven.<SUP> (42)</SUP></P>

 earths, seven seas, seven rivers, seven deserts, seven days, seven weeks
 from Passover to Pentecost, and every seventh year a Jubilee.</P>

 Yod, Lamed, Nun, Samech, Oin, Tzaddi and Qoph; <SUP>(43)</SUP> they are
 the foundations of these twelve properties: Sight, Hearing, Smell, Speech,

 South-east, the East above, the East below, the North above, the North

 South above, and the South below; these diverge to infinity, and are as

 creatures:<SUP> (47)</SUP> the two hands, the two feet, the two kidneys,
 the spleen, the liver, the gall, private parts, stomach and intestines.

 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER VI</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>Section 1. Three Fathers and their generations, Seven conquerors and
 their armies, and Twelve bounds of the Universe. See now, of these words,
 the faithful witnesses are the Universe, the Year and Man. The dodecad,
 the heptad, and the triad with their provinces; above is the Celestial
 Dragon, T L I, <SUP>(49)</SUP> and below is the World, and lastly the heart
 of Man. The Three are Water, Air and Fire; Fire above, Water below, and
 Air conciliating between them; and the sign of these things is that the
 Fire sustains (volatilises) the waters; Mem is mute, Shin is sibilant,
 and Aleph is the Mediator and as it were a friend placed between them.</P>
 
 <P>2. The Celestial Dragon, T L I, is placed over the universe like a king
 upon the throne; the revolution of the year is as a king over his dominion;
 the heart of man is as a king in warfare. Moreover, He made all things
 one from the other; and the Elohim set good over against evil, and made
 good things from good, and evil things from evil: with the good tested
 He the evil, and with the evil did He try the good. Happiness <SUP>(50)</SUP>
 is reserved for the good, and misery <SUP>(51)</SUP> is kept for the wicked.</P>
 
 <P>3. The Three are One, and that One stands above. The Seven are divided;
 three are over against three, and one stands between the triads. The Twelve
 stand as in warfare; three are friends, three are enemies; three are life
 givers; three are destroyers. The three friends are the heart, the ears,
 and the mouth; the three enemies are the liver, the gall, and the tongue;<SUP>
 (52)</SUP> while God <SUP>(53)</SUP> the faithful king rules over all.
 One above Three, Three above Seven, and Seven above Twelve: and all are
 connected the one with the other.</P>
 
 <P>4. And after that our father Abraham had perceived and understood, and
 had taken down and engraved all these things, the Lord most high <SUP>(55)</SUP>
 revealed Himself, and called him His beloved, and made a Covenant with
 him and his seed; and Abraham believed on Him<SUP> (56)</SUP> and it was
 imputed unto him for righteousness. And He made this Covenant as between
 the ten toes of the feet--this is that of circumcision; and as between
 the ten fingers of the hands and this is that of the tongue.<SUP> (57)</SUP>
 And He formed the twenty-two letters into speech <SUP>(58)</SUP> and shewed
 him all the mysteries of them. <SUP>(59)</SUP> He drew them through the
 Waters; He burned them in the Fire; He vibrated them in the Air; Seven
 planets in the heavens, and Twelve celestial constellations of the stars
 of the Zodiac.</P>

 Hyle and the chaos. The Kabalists said that one must enter and pass up
 through the Gates to attain to the Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom; and that

 the fiftieth. See the <I>Oedipus Aegyptiacus</I> of Athanasius Kircher,

 <CENTER><P><B>THE THIRTY-TWO PATHS OF WISDOM</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P><I>Translated from the Hebrew Text of Joannes Stephanus Rittangelius,
 1642: which is also to be found in the &quot;Oedipus Aegyptiacus&quot;
 of Athanasius Kircher, 1653.</I></P>
 
 <P><I>(These paragraphs are very obscure in meaning, and the Hebrew text
 is probably very corrupt.)</I></P>
 
 <P>The First Path is called the Admirable or the Hidden Intelligence (the
 Highest Crown): for it is the Light giving the power of comprehension of
 that First Principle which has no beginning; and it is the Primal Glory,
 for no created being can attain to its essence.</P>
 
 <P>The Second Path is that of the Illuminating Intelligence: it is the
 Crown of Creation, the Splendour of the Unity, equalling it, and it is
 exalted above every head, and named by the Kabalists the Second Glory.</P>
 
 <P>The Third Path is the Sanctifying Intelligence, and is the foundation
 of Primordial wisdom, which is called the Creator of Faith, and its roots
 are AMN; and it is the parent of Faith, from which doth Faith emanate.</P>
 
 <P>The Fourth Path is named the Cohesive or Receptacular Intelligence;
 and is so called because it contains all the holy powers, and from it emanate
 all the spiritual virtues with the most exalted essences: they emanate
 one from the other by the power of the Primordial Emanation. The Highest
 Crown.) <SUP>(1)</SUP></P>
 
 <P>The Fifth Path is called the Radical Intelligence, because it resembles
 the Unity, uniting itself to the Binah, <SUP>(2)</SUP> or Intelligence
 which emanates from the Primordial depths of Wisdom or Chokmah. <SUP>(3)</SUP>
 </P>
 
 <P>The Sixth Path is called the Mediating Intelligence, because in it are
 multiplied the influxes of the emanations, for it causes that influence
 to flow into all the reservoirs of the Blessings, with which these themselves
 are united.</P>
 
 <P>The Seventh Path is the Occult Intelligence, because it is the Refulgent
 Splendour of all the Intellectual virtues which are perceived by the eyes
 of intellect, and by the contemplation of faith.</P>
 
 <P>The Eighth Path is called the Absolute or Perfect Intelligence, because
 it is the means of the primordial, which has no root by which it can cleave,
 nor rest, except in the hidden places of <I>Gedulah</I>, <SUP>(4)</SUP>
 Magnificence, from which emanates its own proper essence.</P>
 
 <P>The Ninth Path is the Pure Intelligence, so called because it purifies
 the Numerations, it proves and corrects the designing of their representation,
 and disposes their unity with which they are combined without diminution
 or division.</P>
 
 <P>The Tenth Path is the Resplendent Intelligence, because it is exalted
 above every head, and sits on the throne of <I>Binah (the Intelligence
 spoken of in the Third Path).</I> It illuminates the splendour of all the
 lights, and causes an influence to emanate from the Prince of countenances.
 <SUP>(5)</SUP> </P>
 
 <P>The Eleventh Path is the Scintillating Intelligence, because it is the
 essence of that curtain which is placed close to the order of the disposition,
 and this is a special dignity given to it that it may be able to stand
 before the Face of the Cause of Causes.</P>
 
 <P>The Twelfth Path is the Intelligence of Transparency, because it is
 that species of Magnificence called Chazchazit, <SUP>(6)</SUP> the place
 whence issues the vision of those seeing in apparitions. (That is the prophecies
 by seers in a vision.)</P>
 
 <P>The Thirteenth Path is named the Uniting Intelligence, and is so called
 because it is itself the Essence of Glory. It is the Consummation of the
 Truth of individual spiritual things.</P>
 
 <P>The Fourteenth Path is the Illuminating Intelligence and is so called
 because it is that <I>Chashmal</I> <SUP>(7)</SUP> which is the founder
 of the concealed and fundamental ideas of holiness and of their stages
 of preparation.</P>
 
 <P>The Fifteenth Path is the Constituting Intelligence, so called because
 it constitutes the substance of creation in pure darkness, and men have
 spoken of these contemplations; it is that darkness spoken of in Scripture,
 Job xxxviii. 9, &quot;and thick darkness a swaddling band for it.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>The Sixteenth Path is the Triumphal or Eternal Intelligence, so called
 because it is the pleasure of the Glory, beyond which is no other Glory
 like to it, and it is called also the Paradise prepared for the Righteous.</P>
 
 <P>The Seventeenth Path is the Disposing Intelligence, which provides Faith
 to the Righteous, and they are clothed with the Holy Spirit by it, and
 it is called the Foundation of Excellence in the state of higher things.</P>
 
 <P>The Eighteenth Path is called the Intelligence or House of Influence
 (by the greatness of whose abundance the influx of good things upon created
 beings is increased), and from its midst the arcana and hidden senses are
 drawn forth, which dwell in its shade and which cling to it, from the Cause
 of all causes.</P>
 
 <P>The Nineteenth Path is the Intelligence of the Secret of all the activities
 of the spiritual beings, and is so called because of the influence diffused
 by it from the most high and exalted sublime glory.</P>
 
 <P>The Twentieth Path is the Intelligence of Will, and is so called because
 it is the means of preparation of all and each created being, and by this
 intelligence the existence of the Primordial Wisdom becomes known.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-first Path is the Intelligence of Conciliation and Reward,
 and is so called because it receives the divine influence which flows into
 it from its benediction upon all and each existence.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-second Path is the Faithful Intelligence, and is so called
 because by it spiritual virtues are increased, and all dwellers on earth
 are nearly under its shadow.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-third Path is the Stable Intelligence, and it is so called
 because it has the virtue of consistency among all numerations.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-fourth Path is the Imaginative Intelligence, and it is so
 called because it gives a likeness to all the similitudes which are created
 in like manner similar to its harmonious elegancies.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-fifth Path is the Intelligence of Probation, or Temptation,
 and is so called because it is the primary temptation, by which the Creator
 trieth all righteous persons.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-sixth Path is called the Renewing Intelligence, because the
 Holy God renews by it all the changing things which are renewed by the
 creation of the world.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-seventh Path is the Active or Exciting Intelligence, and
 it is so called because through it every existent being receives its spirit
 and motion.</P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-eighth Path is called the Natural Intelligence; by it is
 completed and perfected the nature of all that exists beneath the Sun.</P>
 
 <P><I>(This Path is omitted by Rittangelius: I presume by inadvertence.)</I></P>
 
 <P>The Twenty-ninth Path is the Corporeal Intelligence, so called because
 it forms every body which is formed in all the worlds, and the reproduction
 of them.</P>
 
 <P>The Thirtieth Path is the Collective Intelligence, and Astrologers deduce
 from it the judgment of the Stars and celestial signs, and perfect their
 science, according to the rules of the motions of the stars.</P>
 
 <P>The Thirty-first Path is the Perpetual Intelligence; but why is it so
 called? Because it regulates the motions of the Sun and Moon in their proper
 order, each in an orbit convenient for it.</P>
 
 <P>The Thirty-second Path is the Administrative Intelligence, and it is
 so called because it directs and associates the motions of the seven planets,
 directing all of them in their own proper courses.</P>

 <CENTER><P><B>NOTES TO THE SEPHER YETZIRAH</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>It is of considerable importance to a clear understanding of this Occult
 treatise that the whole work be read through before comment is made, so
 that the general idea of the several chapters may become in the mind one
 concrete whole. A separate consideration of the several parts should follow
 this general grasp of the subject, else much confusion may result.</P>
 
 <P>This hook may be considered to he an Allegorical Parallel between the
 Idealism of Numbers and Letters and the various parts of the Universe,
 and it sheds much light on many mystic forms and ceremonies yet extant,
 notably upon Freemasonry, the Tarot, and the later Kabalah, and is a great
 aid to the comprehension of the Astro-Theosophic schemes of the Rosicrucians.
 To obtain the full value of this Treatise, it should he studied hand in
 hand with Hermetic attributions, the &quot;Isiac Tablet,&quot; and with
 a complete set of the designs, symbols and allocation of the Trump cards
 of the Tarot pack, for which see my translation of <I>The Sanctum Regnum
 of the Tarot</I>, by Eliphas Levi.</P>
 
 <P>Note that the oldest MSS. copies of the &quot;Sepher Yetzirah&quot;
 have no vowel points: the latest editions have them. The system of points
 in writing Hebrew was not perfected until the seventh century, and even
 then was not in constant use. Ginsburg asserts that the system of vowel
 pointing was invented by a Rabbi Mocha in Palestine about A.D. 570, who
 designed it to assist his pupils. But Isaac Myer states that there are
 undoubted traces of pointing in Hebrew MSS. of the second century. According
 to A. E. Waite there is no extant Hebrew MSS. with the vowel points older
 than the tenth century.</P>
 
 <P>The words &quot;Sepher Yetzirah&quot; are written in Hebrew from right
 to left, SPR YTzYRH, Samech Peh Resh, Yod Tzaddi Yod Resh Heh; modes of
 transliteration vary with different authors. Yod is variously written in
 English letters as I, Y, or J, or sometimes Ie. Tzaddi is property Tz;
 but some write Z only, which is misleading because the Hebrew has also
 a true Z, Zain.</P>
 
 <P>_______________________________________________________________________</P>
 
 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER I</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>The twelve sections of this chapter introduce this philosophic disquisition
 upon the Formation and Development of the Universe. Having specified the
 subdivision of the letters into three classes, the Triad, the Heptad, and
 the Dodecad, these are put aside for the time; and the Decad mainly considered
 as specially associated with the idea of Number, and as obviously composed
 of the Tetrad and the Hexad.</P>
 
 <P>1. <I>Thirty-two</I>. This is the number of the Paths or Ways of Wisdom,
 which are added as a supplement. 32 is written in Hebrew by LB, Lamed and
 Beth, and these are the last and first letters of the Pentateuch. The number
 32 is obtained thus--2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2=32. Laib, LB as a Hebrew word, means
 the Heart of Man.</P>
 
 <P><I>Paths</I>.The word here is NTIBUT, netibuth; NTIB meant primarily
 a pathway, or foot-made track; but is here used symbolically in the same
 sense as the Christian uses the word, <I>way</I>--the way of life: other
 meanings are--stage, power, form, effect; and later, a doctrinal formula,
 in Kabalistic writings. </P>
 
 <P>2. <I>Jah.</I> This divine name is found in Psalm lxviii. 4; it is translated
 into Greek as <I>kurios</I>, and into Latin as <I>dominus</I>, and commonly
 into the English word, <I>Lord</I>: it is really the first half of the
 word IHVH or Jehovah, or the Yahveh of modern scholars.</P>
 
 <P>3. <I>Jehovah Tzabaoth</I>. This divine name is printed in English Bibles
 as Jehovah Sabaoth, or as &quot;Lord of hosts&quot; as in Psalm xxiv. 10.
 TzBA is an <I>army</I>.</P>
 
 <P>4. <I>God of Israel</I>. Here the word God is ALHI, which in unpointed
 Hebrew might be God, or Gods, or My God.</P>
 
 <P>5. <I>The Elohim of the Living</I>. The words are ALHIM ChIIM. Alhim,
 often written in English letters as Elohim, or by Godftey Higgins as Aleim,
 seems to be a masculine plural of the feminine form Eloah, ALH, of the
 divine masculine name EL, AL; this is commonly translated God, and means
 strong, mighty, supreme. Chiim is the plural of Chi--<I>living</I>, or
 <I>life</I>. ChIH is <I>a living animal</I>, and so is ChIVA. ChII is also
 <I>life</I>. Frey in his dictionary gives ChIIM as the plural word <I>lives</I>,
 or vitae. The true adjective for <I>living</I> is ChIA. Elohim Chiim, then,
 apart from Jewish or Christian preconception, is &quot;the living Gods,&quot;
 or &quot;the Gods of the lives, <I>i.e.,</I> living ones.&quot; Rittangelius
 gives Dii viventes, &quot;The living Gods,&quot; both words in the plural.
 Pistorius omits both words. Postellus, the orthodox, gives Deus Vivus.
 The Elohim are the Seven Forces, proceeding from the One Divine, which
 control the &quot;terra viventium,&quot; the manifested world of life.</P>
 
 <P>6. <I>God</I>. In this case we have the simple form AL, EL.</P>
 
 <P>7. <I>Sepharim.</I> SPRIM, the plural masculine of SPR, commonly translated
 <I>book</I> or <I>letter</I>: the meaning here is plainly &quot;forms of
 expression.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>8. <I>Numbers, Letters and Sounds.</I> The three Hebrew words here given
 are, in unpointed Hebrew, SPR, SPR and SIPUR. Some late editors, to cover
 the difficulty of this passage, have given SPR, SPUR, SIPR, pointing them
 to read Separ, Seepur, Saypar. </P>
 
 <P>The sense of the whole volume appears to need their translation as Numbers,
 Letters and Sounds. Pistorius gave &quot;Scriptis, numeratis, pronunciatis.&quot;
 Postellus gave &quot;Numerans, numerus, numeratus,&quot; thus losing the
 contrasted meanings; and so did Rittangelius, who gave &quot;Numero, numerante,
 numerato.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>9. <I>The Ineffable Sephiroth</I>. The words are SPIRUT BLIMH, Sephiruth
 Belimah. The simplest translation is &quot;the voices from nothing.&quot;
 The Ten Sephiruth of the Kabalah are the &quot;Ten Primary Emanations from
 the Divine Source,&quot; which are the primal forces leading to all manifestation
 upon every plane in succession. Buxtorf gives for Sephiruth--predicationes
 logicae. The word seems to me clearly allied to the Latin spiritus--spirit,
 soul, wind; and is used by Quintilian as a sound, or noise. The meaning
 of <I>Belimah</I> is more doubtful. Rittangelius always gives &quot;praeter
 illud ineffabile.&quot; Pistorius gives &quot;praeter ineffabile.&quot;
 Postellus evades the difficulty and simply puts the word Belimah into his
 Latin translation. In Frey's Hebrew Dictionary BLIMH is translated as <I>nothing</I>,
 without any other suggestion; BLI is &quot;not,&quot; MR is &quot;anything.&quot;
 In Kabalistic writings the Sephiruth, the Divine Voices and Powers, are
 called &quot;ineffbilis,&quot; not to be spoken of, from their sacred nature.</P>
 
 <P>10. The classification of the Hebrew letters into a Triad, Heptad and
 Dodecad, runs through the whole philosophy of the Kabalah. Many ancient
 authors added intentional blinds, suds as forming the Triad of A.M.T.,
 Ameth, truth; and of AMN, Amen.</P>
 
 <P>11. The Two Covenants, by the Word or Spirit, and by the Flesh, made
 by Jehovah with Abraham, Genesis xvii. The Covenant of Circumcision was
 to be an outward and visible sign of the Divine promise made to Ahraham
 and his offspring. The Hebrew word for circumcision is Mulah, MULH: note
 that MLH is also synonymous with DBR, dabar,--verbum or word.</P>
 
 <P>12. Rittangelius gives &quot;replace the formative power upon his throne.&quot;
 Postellus gives restore the device to its place.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>13. <I>Abyss</I>; the word is OUMQ for OMQ, a depth, vastness, or valley.</P>
 
 <P>14. My Hermetic rituals explained this Yetziratic attribution.</P>
 
 <P>15. <I>The Lord the only God.</I> The words are ADUN IChID AL, or &quot;Adonai
 (as commonly written) the only El.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>16. <I>Seat.</I> The word is MOUN, dwelling, habitation, or throne.</P>
 
 <P>17. <I>Lightning flash.</I> In the early edition the words &quot;like
 scintillating flame&quot; are used: the Hebrew word is BRQ. Many Kabalists
 have shown how the Ten Sephiroth are symbolised by the zig-zag lightning
 flash.</P>
 
 <P>18. <I>God</I>; the Divine name here is Jehovah.</P>
 
 <P>19. The text gives only RTzUAV ShUB--&quot;currendo et redeundo,&quot;
 but the commentators have generally considered this to be a quotation from
 Ezekiel i. 14, referred to H ChIVT, the living creatures, kerubic forms.</P>
 
 <P>20. The Spirit of the Gods of the Living. RUCh ALHIM ChIIIM; or as R.
 gives it, &quot;spiritus Deorum Viventium.&quot; Orthodoxy would translate
 these words &quot;The spirit of the living God.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>21. AL ChI H OULMIM; &quot;the Living God of Ages&quot;; here the word
 God really is in the singular.</P>
 
 <P>22. The Voice, Spirit and Word are QUL, RUCh, DBR. A very notable Hebrew
 expression of Divinatory intuition was BATh QUL, the Daughter of the Voice.</P>
 
 <P>23. Formless and Void. THU and BHU; these two words occur in Genesis
 i. 2, and are translated &quot;waste and void.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>24. Note the order in which the primordial elements were produced. First,
 Spirit (query Akasa, Ether); then Air, Vayu; then Water, Apas, which condenses
 into solid elementary Earth, Prithivi; and lastly from the Water He formed
 Fire.</P>
 
 <P>25. The first name is often written Ophanim, the letters are AUPNIM;
 in the Vision of Ezekiel i. 16, the word occurs and is translated &quot;Wheels.&quot;
 ShRPIM are the mysterious beings of Isaiah vi. 2; the word otherwise is
 translated <I>Serpent</I>, and in Numbers xxi. 6, as &quot;fiery serpents&quot;:
 also in verse 8 as &quot;fiery serpent&quot; when Jehovah said &quot;Make
 thee a fiery serpent and set it upon a pole.&quot; Kerubim. The Hebrew
 words arc ChIVTh H QDSh, holy animals: I have ventured to put Kerubim,
 as the title of the other Biblical form of Holy mysterious animal, as given
 in 1 Kings vi. 23 and Exodus xxv. 18, and indeed Genesis iii. 24. Bible
 dictionaries generally give the word as Cherubim, but in Hebrew the initial
 letter is always K and not Ch.</P>
 
 <P>26. Three. In the first edition I overlooked this word <I>three</I>;
 and putting <I>and</I> for <I>as</I>, made four classes of serving beings.</P>
 
 <P>27. This is verse 4 of Psalm civ.</P>
 
 <P>28. Here follow the permutations of the name IHV, which is the Tetragrammaton--Jehovah,
 without the second or final Heh: IHV is a Tri-grammaton, and is more suitable
 to the third or Yetziratic plane. HVI is the imperative form of the verb
 <I>to be</I>, meaning <I>be thou</I>; HIV is the infinitive; and VIH is
 future. In IHV note that Yod corresponds to the Father; Heh to Binah, the
 Supernal Mother; and Vau to the Microprosopus--Son. </P>
 
 <P>29. Note the subdivision of the Decad into the Tetrad--four elements;
 and the Hexad--six dimensions of space.</P>
 
 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER 2</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>This chapter consists of philosophic remarks on the twenty-two sounds
 and letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and hence connected with the air by
 speech, and it points out the uses of those letters to form words--the
 signs of ideas, and the symbols of material substances.</P>
 
 <P>30. <I>Soul</I>; the word is NPSh, which is commonly translated <I>soul</I>,
 meaning the living personality of man, animal or existing thing: it corresponds
 almost to the Theosophic Prana <I>plus</I> the stimulus of Kama.</P>
 
 <P>31. This is the modern classification of the letters into guttural,
 palatal, lingual, dental and labial sounds.</P>
 
 <P>32. <I>The 231 Gates.</I> The number 242 is obtained by adding together
 all the numbers from 1 to 22. The Hebrew letters can he placed in pairs
 in 242 different positions: thus <I>ab, ag, ad</I>, up to <I>at</I>; then
 <I>ba, bb, bg, bd</I>, up to <I>bt</I>, and so on to <I>ts, tt</I>: this
 is in direct order only, without reversal. For the reason why eleven are
 deducted, and the number 231 specified, see the Table and Note 15 in the
 edition of Postellus. </P>
 
 <P>33. <I>Non-existent</I>; the word is AIN, nothingness. Ain precedes
 Ain Suph, boundlessness; and Ain Suph Aur, Boundless Light.</P>
 
 <P>34. <I>Body</I>; the word is GUP, usually applied to the animal material
 body, but here means &quot;one whole.&quot;</P>
 
 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER III</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>This chapter is especially concerned with the essence of the Triad,
 as represented by the Three Mothers, Aleph, Mem, and Shin. Their development
 in three directions is pointed out, namely in the Macrocosm or Universe;
 in the Year or in Time; and in the Microcosm or Man.</P>
 
 <P>35. The importance of equilibrium is constantly reiterated in the Kabalah.
 The &quot;Siphra Dtzeniouta,&quot; or &quot;Book of Mystery,&quot; opens
 with a reference to this Equilibrium as a fundamental necessity of stable
 existence.</P>
 
 <P>36. <I>Heavens.</I> The Hebrew word Heshamaim HShMIM, has in it the
 element of Aesh, fire, and Mim, water; and also Shem, name; <I>The </I>Name
 is IHVH, attributed to the elements. ShMA is in Chaldee a name for the
 Trinity (Parkhurst). ShMSh is the Sun, and Light, and a type of Christ,
 the Sun of Righteousness. Malachi iv. 2.</P>
 
 <P>37. <I>Were produced</I>. The Hebrew word BRA, is the root. Three Hebrew
 words are used in the Bible to represent the idea of making, producing
 or creating.</P>
 
 <P>BRIAH, Briah, giving shape, Genesis i. 1.</P>
 
 <P>OShIH, Ashiah, completing, Genesis i. 31.</P>
 
 <P>ITzIRH, Yetzirah, forming, Genesis ii. 7.</P>
 
 <P>To these the Kabalists add the word ATzLH, with the meaning of &quot;producing
 something manifest from the unmanifested.&quot;</P>

 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER IV</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>This is the special chapter of the Heptad, the powers and properties
 of the Seven. Here again we have the threefold attribution of the numbers
 and letters to the Universe, to the Year, and to Man. The supplemental
 paragraphs have been printed in modern form by Kalisch; they identify the
 several letters of the Heptad more definitely with the planets, days of
 the week, human attributes and organs of the senses. </P>
 
 <P>39. These numbers have been a source of difference between the editors
 and copyists, hardly any two editors concurring. I have given the numbers
 arising from continual multiplication of the product by each succeeding
 unit from one to seven. 2x1=2, 2x3=6, 6x4=24, 24x5=120, 120x6=720, 720x7=5040.</P>
 
 <P>40. In associating the particular letters to each planet the learned
 Jesuit Athanasius Kircher allots Beth to the Sun, Gimel to Venus, Daleth
 to Mercury, Kaph to Luna, Peh to Saturn, Resh to Jupiter, and Tau to Mars.
 Kalisch in the supplementary paragraphs gives a different attribution;
 both are wrong, according to clairvoyant investigation. Consult the Tarot
 symbolism given by Court de Gebelin, Eliphas Levi, and my notes to the
 <I>Isiaic Tablet of Bembo</I>. The true attribution is probably not anywhere
 printed. The planet names here given are Chaldee words. </P>
 
 <P>41. The Seven Heavens and the Seven Earths are printed with errors,
 and I believe intentional mistakes, in many occult ancient books. Some
 Hermetic MSS. have the correct names and spelling.</P>
 
 <P>42. On the further attribution of these Seven letters, note that Postellus
 gives: Vita--mors, Pax--afflictio, Sapientia--stultitia, Divitiae (Opus)--paupertas,
 Gratia--opprobrium, Proles--sterilitas, Imperium--servitus. Pistorius gives:
 Vita--mors, Pax--bellum, Scientia--ignorantia, Divitiae--paupertas, Gratia--abominatio,
 Semen (Proles)--sterilitas, Imperium (Dominatio)--servitus.</P>
 
 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER V</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>This chapter is specially concerned with the Dodecad; the number twelve
 is itself pointed out, and the characters of its component units, once
 more in the three zones of the universe, year and man; the last paragraph
 gives a recapitulation of the whole number of letters: the Supplement gives
 a form of allotment of the several letters. </P>
 
 <P>43. It is necessary to avoid confusion between these letters; different
 authors translate them in different manners. Heh or H&eacute; not be confused
 with Cheth, or Heth, Ch. Teth, Th also must be kept distinct from the final
 letter Tau, T, which is one of the double letters; the semi-English pronunciation
 of these two letters is much confused, each is at times both t and th;
 Yod is either I, Y, or J; Samech is simple S, and must not be confused
 with Shin, Sh, one of the mother letters; Oin is often written in English
 Hebrew grammars as Ayin, and Sometimes as Gnain; Tzaddi must not be confused
 with Zain, Z; and lastly Qoph, Q, is very often replaced by K, which is
 hardly defensible as there is a true K in addition.</P>
 
 <P>44. Postellus gives <I>suspicion</I> and Pistorius, <I>mind</I>.</P>
 
 <P>45. These letters are the initials of the 12 Zodiacal signs in Hebrew
 nomenclature. They are:</P>

 <P>46. The month Nisan begins about March 29th. Yiar is also written Iyar,
 and Aiar: the Hebrew letters are AIIR.</P>
 
 <P>47. The list of organs varies. All agree in two hands, two feet, two
 kidneys, liver, gall and spleen. Postellus then gives, intestina, vesica,
 arteriae,&quot; the intestines, bladder, and arteries; Rittangelius gives
 the same. Pistorius gives, &quot;colon, coagulum (spleen) et ventriculus,&quot;
 colon--the large intestine, coagulum and stomach. The chief difficulty
 is with the Hebrew word MSS, which is allied to two different roots, one
 meaning <I>private, concealed, hidden</I>; and the other meaning <I>liquefied.</I></P>
 
 <P>48. The Elohim--Divine powers--not IHVH the Tetragrammaton.</P>
 
 <CENTER><P><B>CHAPTER VI</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>This chapter is a <I>resum&eacute;</I> of the preceding five; it calls
 the universe and mankind to witness to the truth of the scheme of distribution
 of the powers of the numbers among created forms, and concludes with the
 narration that this philosophy was revealed by the Divine to Abraham, who
 received and faithfully accepted it, as a form of Wisdom under a Covenant.
 </P>
 
 <P>49. The Dragon, TLI, Theli. The Hebrew letters amount in numeration
 to 440, that is 400, 30 and 10. The best opinion is that Tali or Theli
 refers to the 12 Zodiacal constellations along the great circle of the
 Ecliptic; where it ends there it begins again, and so the ancient occultists
 drew the Dragon with its tail in its mouth. Some have thought that Tali
 referred to the constellation Draco, which meanders across the Northern
 polar sky; others have referred it to the Milky Way; others to an imaginary
 line joining Caput to Cauda Draconis, the upper and lower nodes of the
 Moon. Adolphe Franck says that Theli is an Arabic word. </P>
 
 <P>50. <I>Happiness</I>, or a <I>good end</I>, or simply <I>good</I>, TUBH.</P>
 
 <P>51. <I>Misery</I>, or an <I>evil end</I>, or simply <I>evil</I>, ROH.</P>
 
 <P>52. This Hebrew version omits the allotment of the remaining six. Mayer
 gives the paragraph thus:--The triad of amity is the heart and the two
 ears; the triad of enmity is the liver, gall, and the tongue; the three
 life-givers are the two nostrils and the spleen; the three death-dealing
 ones are the mouth and the two lower openings of the body.</P>
 
 <P>53. <I>God</I>. In this case the name is AL, EL.</P>
 
 <P>54. This last paragraph is generally considered to be less ancient than
 the remainder of the treatise, and by another author.</P>
 
 <P>55. The Lord most high. OLIU ADUN. Adun or Adon, or Adonai, ADNI, are
 commonly translated <I>Lord</I>; Eliun, OLIUN, is the more usual form of
 &quot;the most high one.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>56. <I>Him</I>. Rittangelius gives &quot;credidit in Tetragrammaton,&quot;
 but this word is not in the Hebrew.</P>
 
 <P>57. <I>Tongue.</I> The verbal covenant.</P>
 
 <P>58. <I>Speech</I>. The Hebrew has &quot;upon his tongue.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>59. The Hebrew version of Rabbi Judah Ha Levi concludes with the phrase,
 &quot;and said of him, Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee.&quot;
 Rabbi Luria gives the Hebrew version which I have translated. Postellus
 gives: &quot;He drew him into the water, He rose up in spirit, He inflamed
 him in seven suitable forms with twelve signs.&quot; Mayer gives: &quot;Er
 zog sie mit Wasser, zundet sie an mit Feuer; erregte sie mit Geist; verbannte
 sie mit sieben, goss sie aus mit den zwolf Gestirnen.&quot; &quot;He drew
 them with water, He kindled them with fire, He moved them with spirit,
 distributed them with seven, and sent them forth with twelve.&quot;</P>
 
 <CENTER><P><B>Notes to the Thirty-Two Paths of Wisdom</B></P></CENTER>
 
 <P>1. The Highest Crown is Kether, the First Sephira, the first emanation
 from the Ain Suph Aur, the Limit-less Light.</P>
 
 <P>2. Binah, or Understanding, is the Third Sephira.</P>
 
 <P>3. Chokmah, Wisdom, is the Second Sephira.</P>
 
 <P>4. Gedulah is a synonym of Chesed, Mercy, the Fourth Sephira.</P>
 
 <P>5. Metatron, the Intelligence of the First Sephira, and the reputed
 guide of Moses.</P>
 
 <P>6. This word is from ChZCh, a seer, seership. Chazuth is a vision.</P>
 
 <P>7. This word means &quot;scintillating flame.&quot;</P>
 
 <P>The &quot;Thirty-two Paths of Wisdom&quot; refer to the Ten Sephiroth
 and the Twenty-two letters, each supplying a type of divine power and attributes.
 In my <I>Introduction to the Kabalah</I> will be found a diagram showing
 how the Paths from Eleven to Thirty-two connect the several Sephiroth,
 and are deemed to transmit the divine influence. Some teachers of Occult
 Science also allot the Twenty-two Trumps of the Tarot Cards to the twenty-two
 Paths.</P>
