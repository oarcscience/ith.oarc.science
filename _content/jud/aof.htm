<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>No Fixed Dogmas</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the same sense as Christianity or Islam, Judaism can
not be credited with the possession of Articles of Faith. Many attempts
have indeed been made at systematizing and reducing to a fixed phraseology
and sequence the contents Of the Jewish religion. But these have always
lacked the one essential element: authoritative sanction on the part of
a supreme ecclesiastical body. And for this reason they have not been recognized
as final or regarded as of universally binding force. Though to a certain
extent incorporated in the liturgy and utilized for purposes of instruction,
these formulations of the cardinal tenets of Judaism car- ried no greater
weight than that imparted to them by the fame and scholarship of their.respective
authors. None of them had a character analogous to that given in the Church
to its three great formulas (the so-called Apostles' Creed, the Nicene
or Constantopolitan, and the Athanasian), or even to the Kalimat As-Shahadat
of the Mohammedans. The recital of this &quot;Kalimah&quot; is the first
of the five pillars of practical religion in Islam, and one converted to
Islam must repeat it verbatim; so that among the conditions required of
every believer with reference to confession is the duty to repeat it aloud
at least once in a lifetime. None of the many summaries from the pens of
Jewish philosophers) and rabbis has been invested with similar importance
and prominence. The reasons for this relative absence of official and obligatory
creeds are easily ascertained. </FONT><A NAME="no_need"></A></P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>No Need for Creeds in Judaism</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The remark of Leibnitz, in his preface to the &quot;Essais
de Theodicee,&quot; that the nations which filled the earth before the
establishment of Christianity had ceremonies of devotion, sacrifices, libations,
and a priesthood, but that they had no Articles of Fai th and no dogmatic
theology, applies with slight modification to the Jews. Originally race
-- or perhaps it is more correct to say nationality -- and religion were
coextensive. Birth, not profession, admitted to the religio-national fellowship.
As long as internal dissension or external attack did not necessitate for
purposes of defense the formulation of the peculiar. and differentiating
doctrines, the thought of paragraphing and fixing the contents of the religious
consciousness could not insinuate itse lf into the mind of even the most
faithful. Missionary or- proselytizing religions are driven to the definite
declaration of their teachings. The admission of the neophyte hinges upon
the profession and the acceptance of his part of the belief, and that t
here may be no uncertainty about what is essential and what non-essential,
it is incumbent on the proper authorities to determine and promulgate the
cardinal tenets in a form that will facilitate repetition and memorizing.
And the same necessity arises wh en the Church or religious fellowship
is torn by internal heresies. Under the necessity of combating heresies
of various degrees of perilousness and of stubborn insistence, the Church-
and Islam, were forced to define and officially limit their respective
) theological concepts. Both of these provocations to creed-building were
less intense in Judaism. The proselytizing zeal, though during certain
periods more active than at others, was, on the whole, neutralized, partly
by inherent disinclination and part ly by force of circumstances. Righteousness,
according- to Jewish belief, was not conditioned of the acceptance of the
Jewish religion. And the righteous among the nations that carried into
practise the seven fundamental laws of the covenant with Noah and his descendants
were declared to be participants in the felicity of the hereafter. This
interpretation of the status of non-Jews precluded the development of a
missionary attidude. Moreover, the regulations for the reception of proselytes,
as developed i n course of time, prove the eminently practical, that is,
the non-creedal character of Judaism. Compliance with certain rites --
baptism, circumcision, and sacrifice -- is the test of the would-be convert's
faith. He is instructed in the details of the le gal practise that manifests
the Jew's religiosity, while the profession of faith demanded is limited
to the acknowledgement of the nity of God and the rejection of idolatry
(Yorei De'ah, Gerim , 268, 2). Judah ha-Levi (&quot;Cuzari,&quot; i. 115)
puts the whole mat ter very strikingly when he says: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We are not putting on an equality with us a person
entering our religion through confession alone [Arabic original, <I>bikalamati</I>=by
word]. We require deeds, including in that term self-restraint, purity,
study of the Law, circuscision, and the performance of other duties demanded
by the Torah.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For the preparation of the convert, therefore, no other
method of instruction was employed than for the training of one born a
Jew. The aim of teaching was to convey a knowledge of he Law, obedience
to which manifested the acceptance of the underlying re ligious principes;
namely, the existence of God and the holiness of Israel as the people of
his covenant. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The controversy whether Judaism demands belief in dogma
or inculcates obedience to practical laws alone, aas enlisted many competent
scholars. Moses Mendelssohn, in his &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; defended the
non-dogmatic nature of Judaism, while Low, among others, (se e his &quot;Gesammelte
Schriften,&quot; i. 31-52, 433 et seq. 1871) took the opposite side. Low
made it clear that the Mendelssohnian theory had been carried beyond its
legitimate bounds. The meaning of the word for faithful and belief in Hebrew
[<I>emunah</I>] had undoubtedly been strained too far to substantiate the
Mendelssohnian thesis. Underlying the practise of the Law was assuredly
the recognition of certain fundamental and decisive religious principles
culminating in the belief in God and revelation, and li kewise in the doctrine
of retributive divine justice. </FONT><A NAME="evolution"></A></P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>Evolution of Judaism</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The modern critical view of the development of the Pentateuch
within the evolution of Israel's monotheism confirms this theory. The controversy
of the Prophets hinges on the adoption by the people of Israel of the religion
of YHVH, th at excluded froin the outset idolatry, or certainly the recognition
of any other deity than YHVH as the legitimate Lord of Israel; that, in
its progressive evolution, associated YHVH the concepts of holiness, ju
stice, and righteousness; and that which culminated in the teaching of
God's spirituality and universality. The historical books of the Bible,
as recast in accordance with these latter religious ideas evince the force
of a strong and clearly apprehended conviction concerning the providential
purpose in the destinies of earth's inhabitants, and more especially in
the guidance of Israel. </FONT><A NAME="discussion"></A></P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>Discussions and Dogmatism Disfavored</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Psalms and Wisdom books manifest the predominance,
of definite religious beliefs. To say that Judaism is a barren legalistic
convention, as Mendelssohn avers, is an unmistakable exaggeration. The
modicum of truth in his theory is that throughout Bi blical Judaism, as
in fact throught all later phases of Jewish religious thinking and practise,
this doctrinal element remains always in solution. It is not crystallized
into fixed phraseology or rigid dogma. And, moreover, the ethical and practical
impli cations of the religion are never obscured. This is evidenced by
the Biblical passages that, in the opinion of many, partake of the nature
of Articles of Faith, or are of great value as showing what, in the opinion
of their respective authors, constitutes the essence of religion. Among
these the most noteworthy are Deut. vi. 4; Isa., xlv. 5-7; Micah vi. 8;
Ps. xv. ; Isa. i. 16, 17; xxxiii. 15. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Whatever controversies may have agitated Israel during
the centuries of the Prophets and the earlier postexilic period, they were
not of a kind to induce the defining of Articles of Faith counteract the
influences of heretical teaching. Dogmatic influe nces manifest themselves
only after the Maccabean struggle for independence. But even these differences
were not far-reaching enough to overcome the inherent aversion to dogmatic
fixation of principles; for, with the Jews, acceptance of principles was
not so much a matter of theoretical assent as of practical conduct. Though
Josephus would have the divisions between the Pharisees and the Sadducees
hinge on the formal acceptance or rejection of certain points of doctrine
-- such as Providence, resurrectio n of the body, which for the Pharisees,
was identical with future retribution -- it is the consensus of opinion
among modern scholars that the differences between these two parties were
rooted in their respective political programs, and implied in their respectively
national and anti-national attitudes, rather than in their philosophical
or religious dogmas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If the words of Sirach (iii. 20-23) are to be taken as
a criterion, the intensely pious of his days did not incline to speculations
of what was beyond their powers to comprehend. They were content to perform
their, religious duties in simplicity of fai th. The Mishnah (Hag. 11.
1) indorsed this view of Sirach, and in some degree, discountenanced theosophy
and dogmatism. Among the recorded discussions in the schools of the Rabbis,
dogmatic problems commanded only a very inferior degree of attention ('Er.
13b: controversy concerning the, value of human life; Hag. 12a: concerning
the order of Creation). Nevertheless, in the earliest Mishnah is found
the citation of Abtalion against heresy and unbelief (Ab. i. 11 [12]);
and many a Baraita betrays the preva lence of religious differences (Ber.
12b; 'Ab. Zarah 17a). These controversies have left their impress upon
the prayer-book and the liturgy. This is shown by the prominence given
to the Shema'; to the Messianic predictions in the Shemoneh-'Esreh (the
&quot;Ei ghteen Benedictions&quot;), which emphasized the belief in the
Resurrection; and, finally, to the prominence given to the Decalogue --
though the latter was again omitted in order to counteract the belief that
it alone had been revealed (Tamid v. 1; Yer. Ber. 6b; Bab. Ber. 12a). These
expressions of belief are held to have originated in the desire to give
definite utterance and impressiveness to the corresponding doctrines that
were either rejected or attenuated by some of the heretical schools. But
while the se portions of the daily liturgy are expressive of the doctrinal
contents of the regnant party in the synagogue (see Landshuth, in Edelman's
&quot;Hegyon Leb&quot;; and L</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>ITURGY</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>),
they were not cast into the form of catalogued Articles of Faith. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The first to make the attempt to formulate them was <A NAME="philo"></A>Philo
of Alexandria. The influence of Greek thought induced among the Jews of
Egypt the reflective mood. Discussion was undoubtedly active on the unsettled
points of speculative be lief; and such discussion led, as it nearly always
does, to a stricter definition of the doctrines. In his work &quot;De Mundi
Opificio,&quot; lxi., Philo enumerates five articles as embracing the chief
tenets of Mosaism: </FONT><BR>
</P>

<OL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>God is and rules; </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>God is one; </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>the world was created; </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Creation is one; </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>God's providence rules Creation. </FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><BR>
<A NAME="talmudic"></A><FONT SIZE=+1>But among the Tannaim and Amoraim
this example of Philo found no followers, though many of their number were
drawn into controversies with both Jews and non-Jews, and had to fortify
their faith against the attacks of contemporaneous philosophy as well as
against rising Christianity. Only in a general way the Mishnah Sanh. xi.
1 excludes from the world to come the Epicureans and those who deny belief
in resurrection or in the divine origin of the Torah. R. Akiba would also
regard as heretical the readers o f <I>Sefarim Hetsonim</I> -- certain
extraneous writings (Apocrypha or Gospels) -- and such persons that would
heal through whispered formulas of magic. Abba Saul designated as under
suspicion of infidelity those that pronounce the ineffable name of the
D eity. By implication, the contrary doctrine and attitude may thus be
regarded as having been proclaimed as orthodox. On the other hand, Akiba
himself declares that the command to love one's neighbor the fundamental
the principle of the Law; while Ben Asa i assigns this distinction to the
Biblical verse, &quot;This is the book of the generations of man &quot;
(Gen. v. i.; Gen. R. xxiv). The definition of Hillel the Elder in his interview
with a would-be convert (Shab. 31a), embodies in the golden rule the one
fundam ental article of faith. A teacher of the third Christian century,
R. Simlai, traces the development of Jewish religious principles from Moses
with his 613 commands of prohibition and injunction, through David, who,
according to this rabbi, enumerates ele ven; through Isaiah, with six;
Micah, with three; to Habakkuk who simply but impressively sums up all
religious faith in the single phrase, &quot; The pious lives in his faith&quot;
(Mak., toward end). As the Halakhah enjoins that one should prefer death
to an act of idolatry, incest, unchastity, or murder, the inference is
plain that the corresponding positive principles were held to be fundamental
articles of Judaism. </FONT><A NAME="decalogue"></A></P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>The Decalogue as a Summary</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>From Philo down to late medieval and even modern writers,
the Decalogue has been held to be in some way a summary of both the articles
of the true faith and the duties derived from that faith. According to
the Alexandrian philosopher (see &quot;De Vita Mos is&quot;) the order
of the Ten Words is not accidental. They divide readily into two groups:
the first five summarizing man's relations to the Deity; the other five
specifying man's dutics to his fellows. Ibn Ezra virtually adopts this
view. He interprets the contents of the Decalogue, not merely in their
legal-ritual bearing but as expressive of ethico-religious principles.
But this view can be traced to other traditions. In Yer. Ber. 6b the Shema'
is declared to be only an epitome of the Decalogue. That in the poetry
of the synagogal ritual this thought often dominates is well known. No
less a thinker than Saadia Gaon composed a liturgical production of this
character (see A</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>ZHAROT</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>) and R.
Eliezer ben Nathan of Mayence enriched the pray er-book with a piyyut in
which the six hundred and thirteen commands are rubricated in the order
of and in connection with the Decalogue. The theory that the Decalogue
was the foundation of Judaism, its article of faith, was advocated Isaac
Abravanel (see his Commentary on Ex. xx. 1); and in recent years by Isaac
M. Wise of Cincinnati in his &quot;Catechism&quot; and other writings.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The only confession of faith, however, which, though not
so denominated, has found universal acceptance, forms a part of the daily
liturgy, contained in all Jewish prayer-books. ln its original form it
read somewhat as follows: </FONT></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;True and established is this word for us forever.
True it is that Thou art our God as Thou wast the God of our fathers; our
King as [Thou wast] the King of our fathers; our Redeemer and the Redeemer
of our fathers; our Creator and the Rock of our salvation; our Deliverer
and Savior -- from eternity is Thy name, and there is no God besides Thee.&quot;</FONT></P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This statement dates probably from the days of the Hasmoneans
(see Landshuth, in &quot;Hegyon Leb&quot;). </FONT><A NAME="saadia"></A></P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>Saadia's, Judah ha-Levi's and Bahya's Creed.</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the stricter sense of the term, specifications in connected
sequence, and rational analysis of Articles of Faith, did not find favor
with the teachers and the faithful before the Arabic period. The polemics
with the Karaites on the one hand, and, on the other, the necessity of
defending their religion against the attacks of the philosophies current
among both Mohammedans and Jews, induced the leading thinkers to define
and formulate their beliefs. Saadia's &quot;Emunot we-Deot&quot; is in
reality one long ex position of the main tenets of the faithful. The plan
of the book discloses a systematization of the different religious doctrines
that, in the estimation of the author, constitute the sum total of his
faith. They are, in the order of ther treatment by hi m, the following:

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Judah ha-Levi endeavored, in his &quot;Cuzari,&quot; to
determine the fundamentcals of Judaism on another basis. He rejects all
appeal to speculative reason, repudiating the method of the Motekallamin.
The miracles and traditions are, in their natural character, both the source
and the evidence of the true faith. With them Judaism stands and falls.
The book of Bahya ibn Pakuda (&quot;Hobot ha-Lebabot&quot;), while remarkable,
as it is, for endeavoring to give religion its true setting as a spiritual
force, contributed not hing of note to the exposition of the fundamental
articles. It goes without saying that the unity of God, His government
of the world,, the possibilities of leading a divine life -- which were
never forfeited by man -- are expounded as essentials of Judai sm. </FONT><A NAME="ibn_daud"></A></P>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>Ibn Daud and Hananel ben Hushiel</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More interesting on this point is the work of R. Abraham
ibn Daud (1120) entitled &quot; Emnah Ramah&quot; (The High Faithful).
In the second division of his treatise he discourses on the principles
of faith and the Law. These principles are: </FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1>Less well known is the scheme of an African rabbi, Hananel
b. Hushiel, about a century earlier, according to whom Judaism's fundamental
articles number four: </FONT><BR>

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>The Thirteen Articles of Maimonides</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The most widely spread and popular of all creeds is that
of Maimonides, embracing the thirteen articles. Why he chose this particular
number has been a subject of much discussion. Some have seen in the number
a reference to the thirteen attributes of God. Probably no meaning attaches
to the choice of the number. His articles are:</FONT><BR>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>Resurrection. </FONT></LI>
</OL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This creed Maimonides wrote while still a very young man;
it forms a part of his Mishnah Commentary, but he never referred to it
in his later works (See S/ Adler, &quot;Tenets of Faith and Their Authority
in the Talmud,&quot; in his &quot;Kobez 'al Yad,&quot; p. 92, wher e Yad
ha-Hazakah, Issure Biah, xiv, 2, is referred to as proof that Maimonides
in his advanced age regarded as fundamental of the faith only the unity
of God and the prohibition of idolatry). It did not meet universal acceptance;
but, as its phraseology is succinct, it has passed into the the prayer-book,
and is therefore familiar to almost all Jews of the Orthodox school. The
successors of Maimonides, from the thirteenth to the fifteeneth century
-- Nahmanides , Abba Mari ben Moses, Simon ben Zemah, Du ran, Albo, Isaac
Arama, and Joseph Jaabez -- reduced his thirteen articles to three: <BR>

Belief in </FONT></P>

<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>God; </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>in Creation (or revelation); and in </FONT></LI>

<LI><FONT SIZE=+1>providence (or retribution). </FONT></LI>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Others, like Crescas and David ben Samuel Estella, spoke
of seven fundmental articles, laying stress on free-will. On the other
hand, David ben Yom-Tob ibn Bilia, in his &quot;Yesodot ha- Maskil&quot;
(Fundamentals of the Thinking Man), adds to the thirteen of M aimonides
thirteen of his own -- a number which a contemporary of Albo (see &quot;'Ikkarim,&quot;
iii.) also chose for his fundamentals; while Jedaiah Penini, in the last
chapter of his &quot;Behinat ha-Dat,&quot; enumerated no less than thirty-five
cardinal principles (see Low, &quot;Judische Dogmen,&quot; in his &quot;Gesammelte
Werke,&quot; i. 156 <I>et seq.</I>; and Schechter, &quot;Dogmas of Judaism,&quot;
in &quot;Studies of Judaism,&quot; pp. 147-181). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the fourteenth century Asher ben Jehiel of Toledo raised
his voice against the Maimonidean Articles of Faith, declaring them to
be only temporary, and suggested that another be added to recognize that
the Exile is a punishment for the sins of Israel . Isaac Abravanel, his
&quot;Rosh Amanah,&quot; took the same attitude towards Maimonides' creed.
While defending Maimonides against Hasdai and Albo, he refused to accept
dogmatic articles for Judaism, holding, with all the cabalists, that the
613 commandments of t he Law are all tantamount to Articles of Faith. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In liturgical poetry the Articles of Faith as evolved
by philosophical speculation met with metrical presentation. The most noted
of such metrical and rimed elaborations are the &quot;Adon 'Olam,&quot;
by an anonymous writer -- now used as an introduction to the morning services
(by the Sephardim as the conclusion of the <I>musaf</I> or &quot;additional&quot;
service), and of comparatively recent date; and the other known as the
&quot;Yigdal,&quot; according to Luzzatto, by R. Daniel b. Judah Dayyan.

<H2><FONT SIZE=+1>Modern Catechisms</FONT></H2>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The modern catechisms abound in formulated Articles of
Faith. These are generally intended to be recited by the candidates for
confirmation, or to be used for the reception of proselytes (See Dr. Einhorn's
&quot;'Olat Tamid&quot;). The Central Conference of America n Rabbis, in
devising a formula for the admission of proselytes, elaborated a set of
Articles of Faith. These modern schemes have not met with general favor
-- their authors being in almost all cases the only ones that have had
recourse to them in practis e. The points of agreement in these recent
productions consist in </FONT><BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Karaites are not behind the Rabbinites in the elaboration
of Articles of Faith. The oldest instances of the existence of such articles

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The number ten here is not accidental. It is keeping with
the scheme of the Decalogue. Judah Hadassi acknowledges that he had predecessors
in this line, and mentions some of the works on which he bases his enumeration.
The most succinct cataloguing of the Karaite faith in articles is that
by Elijah Bashyatzi (died about 1490). His articles vary but little from
those by Hadassi, but they are put with greater philosophical precision
(see Jost, Geschichte des Judenthums,&quot; ii. 331). </FONT><A NAME="bibliography"></A></P>
