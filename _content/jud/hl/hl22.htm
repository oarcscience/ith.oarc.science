<P>Rabbi Yehudah says the early Pietists used to suffer some twenty days before death from diarrhœa, the effect of which was to purge and purify them for the world to come; for it is said, "As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold, so is a man to his praise" (Prov. xxvii. 21).</P>

<FONT SIZE=2><P>It may not be out of place to append two or three parallel passages here by way of illustration:--"Bodily suffering purges away sin" (<I>Berachoth</I>, fol. 5, col. 1). "He who suffers will not see hell" (<I>Eiruvin</I>, fol. 41, col. 2). "To die of diarrhœa is an augury for good, for most of the righteous die of that ailment" (<I>Kethuboth</I>, fol. 103, col. 2, and elsewhere).</P>
