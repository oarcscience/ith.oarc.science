# LXXII.

Ptolemy, the king (of Egypt), assembled seventy-two elders of Israel and
lodged them in seventy-two separate chambers, but did not tell them why
he did so. Then he visited. each one in turn and said, "Write out for me
the law of Moses your Rabbi." The Holy One--blessed be He!--went and
counseled the minds of everyone of them, so that they all agreed, and
wrote, "God created in the beginning," etc.

Meggillah, fol. 9, col. 1.

The Talmudic story of the origin of the Septuagint agrees in the main
with the account of Aristeas and Josephus, but Philo, gives the
different version. Many of the Christian fathers believed it to be the
work of inspiration.
