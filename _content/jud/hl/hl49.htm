<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">WITNESSES.</H1>
<P>An ignoramus is ineligible for a witness.</P>
<P>The following are ineligible as witnesses of the appearance of the new moon:--Dice-players, usurers, pigeon fliers, sellers of the produce of the year of release, and slaves. This is the general rule; in any case in which women are inadmissible as witnesses, they also are inadmissible here.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Rosh Hashanah</I>, fol. 22, col. 1.</P>
<P>Two disciples of the wise happened to be shipwrecked with Rabbi Yossi ben Simaii, and the Rabbi allowed their widows to re-marry on the testimony of women. Even the testimony of a hundred women is only equal to the evidence of one man (and that only in a case like the foregoing; it is inadmissible in any other matter).</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Yevamoth</I>, fol. 115, col. 1.</P>
<P>"Whosoever is not instructed in Scripture, in the Mishna, and in good manners," says Rabbi Yochanan, "is not qualified to act as a witness." "He who cats in the street," say the Rabbis, "is like a dog;" and some add that such a one is ineligible as a witness, and Rav Iddi bar Avin says the Halachah is as "some say."</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Kiddushin</I>, fol. 40, col. 2.</P>
<P>{p. 168}</P>
<P>Even when a witness is paid, his testimony is not thereby invalidated.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Kiddushin</I>, fol. 58, col. 2.</P>
<P>Testimony that is invalidated in part is invalidated entirely.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Bava Kama</I>, fol. 73, col. 1.</P>
<P>Let witnesses know with whom and before whom they bear testimony, and who will one day call them to account; for it is said (Deut. xix. 17), "Both the men between whom the controversy is shall stand before the Lord."</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Sanhedrin</I>, fol. 6, col. 2.</P>
<P>Those that eat another thing (<I>i. e.</I>, not pork, but those who receive charity from a Gentile.--Rashi and Tosefoth) are disqualified from being witnesses. When is this the case? When done publicly; but if in secret, not so.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Ibid.</I>, fol. 26, col. 2.</P>
<P>He who swears falsely in a capital case is unreliable as a witness in any other suit at law; but if he has perjured himself in a civil case only, his evidence may be relied upon in cases where life and death are concerned.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Ibid.</I>, fol. 27, col. 1.</P>
<P>He who disavows a loan is fit to be a witness; but he who disowns a deposit in trust is unfit.</P>
<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Shevuoth</I>, fol. 40, col. 2.</P>
<P>Shimon ben Shetach says, "Fully examine the witnesses; be careful with thy words, lest from them they learn to lie." Avoth, chap. I.</P>
