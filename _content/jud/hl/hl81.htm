<I><P ALIGN="RIGHT">Kiddushin</I>, fol. 30, col. 1.</P>
<FONT SIZE=2><P>The number of verses in the Pentateuch is usually stated at 5845, the mnemonic sign of which is a word in Isaiah XXX. 26, the letters of which stand for 5845. The verse reads, "Moreover, the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun." The Masorites tell us that the number of verses in the Psalms is 2527, and in the two Books of Chronicles 1656.</P>
