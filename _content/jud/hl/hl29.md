# XVIII.

On the twenty-eighth day of Adar there came good news to the Jews. The
Roman Government had passed a decree ordaining that they should neither
study the law, nor circumcise their children, nor observe the
Sabbath-days. Yehudah ben Shamua and his associates went to consult a
certain matron, whom all the magnates of Rome were in the habit of
visiting. She advised them to come at night and raise a loud outcry
against the decree they complained of. They did so, and cried, "O
heavens! are we not your brethren? are we not the children of one
mother?" (Alluding to Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.) "Wherein
are we worse than all other nations and tongues, that you should oppress
us with such harsh decrees?" Thereupon the decrees were revoked; to
commemorate which the Jews established a festival.

Rosh Hashanah, fol. 19, col. 1.
