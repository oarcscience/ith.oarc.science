<P>"And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death" (2 Chron. xxxii. 33). This is Hezekiah, king of Judah, at whose funeral thirty-six thousand people attended bare-shouldered, . . . and upon his bier was laid a roll of the law, and it was said, "This man has fulfilled what is written in this book."</P>
