<P>The world is to last six thousand years. Two thousand of these are termed the period of disorder, two thousand be long to the dispensation of the law, and two thousand are the days of the Messiah; but because of our iniquities a large fraction of the latter term is already passed and gone without the Messiah giving any sign of His appearing.</P>
