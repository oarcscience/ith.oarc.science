### THE FATHER'S VOICE

R. Joshua, the Cohen, <span id="fr_16"></span>[\*](#fn_15) son of
Nehemiah, says: At the time when the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed
Himself to Moses, it was only by the tyrannic compulsion of the spirit
of prophecy that Moses became a prophet. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[†](#fn_16)

The Holy One said: "If I reveal Myself to him in a great and mighty
voice, I shall cause him to tremble; if with a soft voice, he will doubt
whether he has heard anything, and treat the prophecy with contempt."
Therefore God revealed Himself to Moses in his father's voice. And Moses
said: "Here I am, father, what does my father want?" Then said the Holy
One: "I am not thy father, but the God of thy father."
