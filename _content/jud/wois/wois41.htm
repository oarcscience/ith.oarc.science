<p>When a rich man is asked by a poor man to give him charity, and he refuses, and says to him, "Why don't you go and work? Look at your strong arms and legs, and your stout body." Then the Holy One, blessed be He, says to that rich man: "Was it not enough that thou didst not give him anything of thine, that thou shouldst also cast an evil eye on him for what I have given him?"</p>
