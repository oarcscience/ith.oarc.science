<p>However much a man may heap up good works and pious actions, he can never satisfy his soul. Rabbi Levi says: "This may be likened in a parable to a simple citizen who married a princess of the royal blood. Even if he made her to eat all the delicacies in the world, and gave her every</p>

<P><A NAME="fn_14"></A><A HREF="wois35.htm#fr_15">54:*</A> The word here rendered "soul" is in this particular verse translated in the English Bible "appetite," though elsewhere in the English Bible it is often rendered "soul." The Rabbis, in this midrash, translate <i>nefesh</i> (soul) or "life principle" as if it were <i>neshammah</i> or <i>ruach</i>, the spiritual part of man. This is a good instance of the kind of agadic treatment of Scripture described by me in the Introduction.</P>
