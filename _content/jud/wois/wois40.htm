<p>It happened that a certain poor woman brought a handful of flour to the Temple as an offering, and the priest looked at it with contempt, and said: "What is this to bring as an offering? What is there in this to eat?"</p>  
<p>Then that priest was rebuked in a vision, and it was shown him that her offering was more acceptable to God than the sacrifices of the wealthy. The divine voice said to him: "Thou shalt not look with contempt upon her. It is as if she had offered her own life."</p>
