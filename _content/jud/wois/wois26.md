### MANY MANSIONS IN THE LIFE TO COME.

"And a man goeth to his everlasting home" (Eccles. xii. 5).

The preacher does not say to "*an* everlasting home," but "*his*
everlasting home," in order to teach that for every individual righteous
man there is a special home in the world to come.

This may be likened to a king who entered a district accompanied by the
governors of districts in his dominions, his counsellors, many high
officers of state, and a numerous retinue. They all entered by one gate,
but as soon as they were in the chief city, they were all led to
different quarters. Some were lodged in palaces and some in mansions,
and some in more humble quarters—each according to his rank and the
honour due to him. So it is with the righteous that enter the kingdom of
Heaven. All must enter through the one gate of death; but the lot of
each one is according to his merit. The degree of the repentant sinner
is higher than that of the righteous, for they have tasted the sweets of
sin, and virtue has been attained with greater sacrifice and effort.
