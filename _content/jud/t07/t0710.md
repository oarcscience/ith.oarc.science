APPENDIX TO MISHNA I, CHAP. III., PAGE [83](t0707.htm#page_83).

WE deem it necessary to call the attention of the reader to the fact
that the law of occupancy was chiefly taken from the ancient Roman
law <span id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60) about *usucapio* (occupancy),
which dictates that each *usucapio* without *titulius* (claim) is not
considered. The claims must be *pro emptore* (purchase) or *pro donato*
(gift), *pro legato*, *pro dote*, or *pro herede* (inheritance); and
with *usucapio*, which is based upon inheritance, no other claim was
necessary. The law applied even when it was known that the occupant
never had a deed to what he had occupied, and the reason was because the
plaintiff had time to protest three years, or at three harvestings, and
when he did not make any claim nor any protest, it was evident that the
occupant had a right to occupy, and no other evidence was needed. There
is also a difference between *præsentes* and *absentes* of the occupant.
However, concerning *servitutes* (service) there was also *usucapio*, in
the reverse; namely, *pro libertate* (liberty), which means that the
servant or bondsman had a right to free himself by *non usus*--namely,
when during three years he was never put to any work by his master he
became free. But there was no *usucapio* by using the bondsman, even if
for several years: property in him was not acquired if he had no other
evidence. (See Ltf. Schweppe, § 305.) According to this, Abraham
Krochmal, in his Scholia to the Babylonian Talmud (p. 278) maintains
that the term "to slaves" in the Mishna in question means that the law
of occupancy applies to these slaves themselves; viz., after three
years' rest from any service to their masters, the slaves become free,
but not, in accordance with the Gemara, conversely. And so he also
explains Resh Lakish's statement ([p. 96](t0707.htm#page_96)), "that the
law of hazakah does not apply to a living creature," as unchangeable,
and it seems to us that so it is.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_60"></span>[214:1](t0710.htm#fr_60) The law of occupancy
also existed in Persia, but it prescribed no less than twenty years. See
text, [p. 101](t0707.htm#page_101).
