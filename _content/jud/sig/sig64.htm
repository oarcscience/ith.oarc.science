<p>Who shall tell Thy praises?<br> For Thou madest the Moon the chief source whereby to calculate<br> Appointed times and seasons,<br> And cycles and signs for the days and the years. <A NAME="page_90"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 90</FONT></A><br> Her rule is in the night,<br> Until the coming of the fixed hour<br> When her brightness shall be darkened<br> And she shall clothe herself with the mantle of gloom.<br> For from the light of the Sun is her light,<br> And should it hap on the night of the fourteenth that both of them stand<br> On the line of the Dragon,<br> So that it cometh between them,<br> Then the Moon shall not convey her light,<br> And her illumination shall be extinguished,<br> To the end that all the peoples of the earth shall know<br> That they are the creatures of the Most High,<br> And however splendid they be<br> There is a Judge above them to humble and exalt.<br> Nathless she shall live again after her fall<br> And shall be resplendent again after her darkness,<br> And when she is in conjunction with the Sun at the end of the month,<br> If the Dragon shall be between them,<br> And both shall stand upon one line,<br> Then the Moon shall stand before the Sun like a projecting blackness<br> And shall hide the light thereof from the sight of all beholders,<br> In order that all who behold may know<br> That the sovereignty is not with the hosts and legions of heaven <A NAME="page_91"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 91</FONT></A><br> But that there is a Master over them,<br> Obscuring and irradiating,<br> For height behind height He keepeth, yea, and the heights beyond them,<br> And they that imagine the Sun is their god<br> At such time shall be ashamed of their imaginings,<br> For their words are then tested,<br> And they shall know &#146;tis the hand of the Lord hath done this<br> And that the Sun hath no power<br> And His alone is the rule who can darken its light,<br> Sending to it a slave of its slaves,<br> A beneficiary of its own kindly glow,<br> To becloud its radiance,<br> To cut off the abominable idolising thereof,<br> "And let the Sun be removed from sovereignty."</p>
