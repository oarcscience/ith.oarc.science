<p>Who can know Thy pathways?<br> For Thou hast made palaces for the seven planets<br> In the twelve constellations,<br> And to the Ram and the Bull Thou hast imparted Thy strength in uniting them,<br> And the third is the Twins, like two brothers in their unity<br> And their human likeness. <A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A><br> And the fourth is the Crab,<br> And on him, as on the Lion, hast Thou bestowed of Thy splendour,<br> And on his sister the Virgin, who is near unto him,<br> And on the Scales and the Scorpion placed by his side,<br> And on the ninth that was created in the form of a man of might, whose strength runs not dry,<br> For he is the Archer, mighty of the bow.<br> And thus too by Thy great power are created the Goat and the Water-Bearer,<br> While alone is the last constellation,<br> "For the Lord did appoint a great Fish."<br> And these are the constellations high and exalted in their degrees,<br> "Twelve princes according to the nations."</p>
