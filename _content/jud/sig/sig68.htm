<p>Who can grasp Thy greatness?<br> For Thou hast appointed the Sun for the computing<br> Of days and of years, and appointed periods,<br> And to make the fruit-tree to burgeon,<br> And, under the sweet influence of the Pleiades and the bands of Orion,<br> The green shoots luxuriant.<br> Six months he journeyeth towards the north to warm the air,<br> And the waters, the woods, and the rocks,<br> And as he draweth nigh to the north,<br> The days grow longer and the seasons wax,<br> Till there is found a place where the day is so lengthened<br> That it lasteth six months,<br> According to confirmed indications,<br> And six months he journeyeth towards the south<br> In his appointed courses<br> Till there is found a place where the night is so lengthened<br> That it lasteth six months,<br> According to the proof of searchers.<br> And from this may be known a fringe of the ways of the Creator,<br> A whisper of His mighty powers,<br> Of His strength and His wondrous works.<br> As from the greatness of servants<br> May the greatness of the master be known<br> By all men of understanding, <A NAME="page_95"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 95</FONT></A><br> So through the ministering Sun is revealed<br> The grandeur and glory of the Lord,<br> "For all the goods of his Master are delivered into his hands."</p>
