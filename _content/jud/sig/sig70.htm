<p>Who can know Thy wondrous works?<br> For Thou hast encompassed the sphere of the<br> Sun with a fifth sphere,<br> And therein Mars like a king in his palace,<br> And in eighteen months he completeth his circuit.<br> And his measure to the body of the earth<br> Is as one and five-eighths to one.<br> And this is the scope of his greatness,<br> That he is like a terror-striking warrior<br> Whose shield of red gives him might,<br> And who stirreth up wars,<br> And slaughter and destruction,<br> With men smitten of the sword<br> And consumed of flame,<br> Their sap burned to dryness;<br> And years of dearth<br> And fiery burnings and thunders and hailstones<br> And piercings and withdrawings of the sword in consonance with them,<br> "For their feet run swiftly to commit evil and hasten to shed blood."</p>
