#### XXXIV.

O my God, I know that my sins are too great to tell,  
And my trespasses too many to remember,  
Yet as a drop from the sea will I make mention of some,  
And make confession of them;  
Perhaps I shall silence the roar of their waves and their crashing,  
"And Thou wilt hear from heaven and forgive."  
I have trespassed against Thy law,  
I have despised Thy commandments,  
I have abhorred them in my heart,  
And with my mouth spoken slander.  
I have committed iniquity,  
And I have wrought evil,  
I have been presumptuous,  
I have done violence,  
I have plastered over falsehood,  
I have counselled evil, <span id="page_110">p. 110</span>  
I have lied, I have scoffed,  
I have revolted, I have blasphemed,  
I have been rebellious and perverse and sinful,  
I have stiffened my neck,  
I have loathed Thy rebukes and done wickedly,  
I have corrupted my ways,  
I have strayed from my paths,  
I have transgressed and turned away from Thy commandments.  
"But Thou art just in all that is come upon me  
For Thou hast dealt truly and I have dealt wickedly."
