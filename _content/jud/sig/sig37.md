### 34

### THE DAY OF JUDGMENT

Propound a mystery, O my tongue, and give praise to God,  
For He hath delivered me and exalted my horn.  
Awake, my heart, and turn to the Almighty,  
And in awe of His anger let my hand be lifted to Him.

Set the Most High before thee, and know that every thought  
And every hidden imagining are to Him not hidden.  
Dread the day of His wrath, and the dreadful position  
Wherein is help or refuge for no creature.

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

On the day He shall judge the peoples and destroy beings  
And wither all His adversaries as with the fiery blast of his nostrils  
And decree the fate of all potentates, officers and rulers,  
Nor pay regard to mighty princes.  
And destroy tyrants and cut off the scornful,  
The proud and presumptuous who rely on the  
preciousness of their palanquin;

Who have forgotten their Creator and put their trust in their riches  
And prided themselves above high God,  
Who humbleth and uplifteth,  
And have rebelled against their Master,  
With their host and their multitude,  
And the silver they have acquired, and the fine gold and sapphires,
<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>  
And have built structures, and carved out windows,  
And erected palaces, and battlements and chambers,  
Nor remember the Almighty,  
But wax fat in the abundance of power,  
And speak arrogantly to Him  
And roar like young lions.

But He is great and fearful,  
And girded about with might;  
He calleth the generations  
And from Him are the hill-tops.  
Doth He not regard the lowly,  
And abase every one that is proud?  
He will raise up the broken pauper  
And lift him from the dunghill.

Woe to them for this,  
When their Creator shall sit in judgment,  
To take vengeance on them, their grown and their little ones, <span
id="page_58">p. 58</span>  
And they shall fall into the net, weeping bitterly,  
And when quaffing the cup of foaming wine  
Shall drain only dregs,  
And shall be consumed in their iniquity,  
And their riches shall not profit them,  
And all they build shall be upset  
As though overthrown by strangers.

And the God of the ages will abhor the man of blood  
And will break the haughty  
Like a potter’s vessel,  
And will bring low their pride  
And silence their psaltery  
And make their voice sound  
Like a ghost from the dust,  
And demolish their battlements  
And their houses of pleasure,  
And make over their inheritance  
To strangers and aliens, <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>  
And the gadfly shall sting them  
To determined destruction,  
And they shall be trodden of passers-by  
Like a ground or a street.

Therefore turn ye from them and their counsels,  
Nor vie with them  
Lest your fate be as that of these arrogant.
