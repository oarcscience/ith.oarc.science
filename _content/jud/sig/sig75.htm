<p>O Lord, who shall search out Thy profundities?<br> For Thou hast set apart above the sphere of the constellations<br> The sphere that is ninth in order,<br> That encompasseth all the spheres and their creatures,<br> Wherein they are closed up,<br> Which driveth all the stars of heaven and their planets<br> From the east to the west in the might of its movement.<br> Once a day it bows down in the west to the King who enthroned it, <A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A><br> And all the creatures of the universe in its midst are as a grain of mustard in the vast ocean<br> From the mighty vastness of its breadth.<br> Yet all this and its greatness are accounted as nothing and naught<br> By the side of the greatness of its Creator and King,<br> And all its sublimities and grandeur<br> "Are vain and void in comparison with Him."</p>
