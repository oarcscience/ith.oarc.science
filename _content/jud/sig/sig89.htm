<p>May it please Thee, O Lord my God,<br> To subdue my fierce desire.<br> O hide Thy face from my sins and trespasses,<br> Do not carry me off in the midst of my days,<br> Until I shall have prepared what is needful for my way<br> And provender for the day of my journeying,<br> For if I go out of my world as I came,<br> And return to my place, naked as I came forth,<br> Wherefore was I created<br> And called to see sorrow?<br> Better were it I had remained where I was<br> Than to have come hither to increase and multiply sin. <A NAME="page_115"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 115</FONT></A><br> I beseech Thee, O God, judge me by Thine attribute of mercy,<br> And not by Thine anger lest Thou wither me.<br> For what is man that Thou shouldst judge him?<br> And how shalt Thou weigh a drifting vapour?<br> When Thou placest it in the balance,<br> It shall be neither heavy nor light,<br> And what shall it profit Thee to weigh the air?<br> From the day of his birth man is hard-pressed and harrowed,<br> "Stricken, smitten of God and afflicted."<br> His youth is chaff driven in the wind,<br> And his latter end is flying straw,<br> And his life withereth like a herb,<br> And God joineth in hunting him.<br> From the day he cometh forth from his mother&#146;s womb<br> His night is sorrow and his day is sighing.<br> If to-day he is exalted,<br> To-morrow he shall crawl with worms.<br> A grain of chaff putteth him to flight,<br> And a thorn woundeth him.<br> If he is sated, he waxeth wicked,<br> And if he is hungry, he sinneth for a loaf of bread.<br> His steps are swift to pursue riches,<br> But he forgetteth Death, who is after him.<br> At the time he is straitened, he multiplieth his promises,<br> And scattereth his words,<br> And is profuse in vows,<br> But when he is enlarged, <A NAME="page_116"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 116</FONT></A><br> He keepeth back his word and forgetteth his vows,<br> And strengtheneth the bars of his gates,<br> While Death is in his chambers,<br> And he increaseth guards in every quarter<br> While the foe lieth ambushed in his very apartment.<br> As for the wolf, the fence shall not restrain it<br> From coming to the flock.<br> Man entereth the world,<br> And knoweth not why,<br> And rejoiceth,<br> And knoweth not wherefore,<br> And liveth,<br> And knoweth not how long.<br> In his childhood he walketh in his own stubbornness,<br> And when the spirit of lust beginneth in its season<br> To stir him up to gather power and wealth,<br> Then he journeyeth from his place<br> To ride in ships<br> And to tread the deserts,<br> And to carry his life to dens of lions,<br> Adventuring it among wild beasts;<br> And when he imagineth that great is his glory<br> And that mighty is the spoil of his hand,<br> Quietly stealeth the spoiler upon him,<br> And his eyes are opened and there is naught.<br> At every moment he is destined to troubles,<br> That pass and return,<br> And at every hour evils,<br> And at every moment chances,<br> And on every day terrors. <A NAME="page_117"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 117</FONT></A><br> If for an instant he stand in security,<br> Suddenly disaster will come upon him,<br> Either war shall come and the sword will smite him,<br> Or the bow of brass transpierce him;<br> Or sorrows will overpower him,<br> Or the presumptuous billows flow over him,<br> Or sickness and steadfast evils shall find him,<br> Till he becometh a burden on his own soul,<br> And shall find the gall of serpents in his honey.<br> And when his pain increaseth<br> His glory decreaseth,<br> And youths make mock of him,<br> And infants rule him,<br> And he becometh a burden to the issue of his loins,<br> And all who know him become estranged from him.<br> And when his hour hath come, he passeth from<br> the courts of his house to the court of Death,<br> And from the shadow of his chambers to the shadow of Death.<br> And he shall strip off his broidery and his scarlet<br> And shall put on corruption and the worm,<br> And lie down in the dust<br> And return to the foundation from which he came.<br> And man, whom these things befall,<br> When shall he find a time for repentance<br> To scour away the rust of his perversion?<br> For the day is short and the work manifold,<br> And the task-masters irate,<br> Hurrying and scurrying, <A NAME="page_118"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 118</FONT></A><br> And Time laughs at him<br> And the Master of the House presses.<br> Therefore I beseech Thee, O my God,<br> Remember the distresses that come upon man,<br> And if I have done evil<br> Do Thou me good at my latter end,<br> Nor requite measure for measure<br> To man whose sins are measureless,<br> And whose death is a joyless departure.</p>
