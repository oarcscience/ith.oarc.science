<p>O Lord, who can unroll Thy mysteries?<br> For Thou hast made in the Height chambers and store-houses,<br> Some of them awesome to tell of, a tale of mighty doings,<br> And some treasuries of life for the pure and the clean.<br> For some are treasures of salvation to those who have returned from iniquity, <A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A><br> And some are treasures of fire,<br> And rivers of brimstone<br> For the breakers of the covenant.<br> And there is a provision of deep pits whose fire is never quenched.<br> "He that is abhorred of the Lord shall fall therein."<br> And there are caverns of storm-winds and tempests<br> And congelation and cold,<br> And treasures of hail and ice and snow and drought,<br> Also of heat and flowing channels<br> And of thick smoke and hoar-frost and of clouds and thick cloud,<br> And darkness and gloom.<br> The whole hast Thou prepared in its due season,<br> "Thou hast ordained it for mercy or judgment,<br> And established it, O Rock, for correction!"</p>
