<p>Who shall understand Thy mysteries?<br> For thou hast encompassed the second sphere with a third sphere,<br> And therein a brightness (Venus) like a queen amid her hosts,<br> And her garments adorned like a bride&#146;s,<br> And in eleven months she fulfilleth her circuit,<br> And her body to that of the earth is as one to thirty and seven,<br> To those who know her secret and understand her.<br> And she reneweth in the world, by the will of her Creator,<br> Peace and prosperity, dancing and delight,<br> And songs and shouts of joy,<br> And the love-cries of bride and bridegroom on their canopies.<br> And it is she conspireth the ripening of fruit<br> And other vegetation,<br> "From the precious things of the fruits of the sun,<br> And from the precious things of the yield of the moons."</p>
