<p><i>Lord, what is man but flesh and blood? O weep!<br> His days unconscious stray, like shadows sweep,<br> His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep</i>.</p>  
<p>Lord, what is man? A carcase fouled and trodden,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A noxious creature brimming with deceit,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A fading flow&#146;r that shrivels in the heat.<br> Wert Thou as stern as he with sin is sodden,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How could he face Thy wrath? Ah, see him creep:<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
<p>Lord, what is man? He rolls in mud and lies,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Insanely fouls the clean and spoils the fine.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Did but Thy justice follow his design,<br> Mown like the grass were he, or herb that dies.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In doom&#146;s dark hour be then Thy pity deep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_53"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 53</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Lord, what is man? Proud, born in sin, defiant,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His drink is violence and on wrong he feeds.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Sea-tossed and furnace-fierce, if judged by deeds<br> He would be crushed like weakling fighting giant.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thy mercy therefore let his prayer reap,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
<p>Lord, what is man? A trickster vile, abhorred.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;If Thou shouldst deal with him in equity,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;A mouldered robe, a scattered cloud were he.<br> Therefore forgiveness is his best award.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His base is dust, his form a clayey heap,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
<p>Lord, what is man? A tree despoiled, mere stubble<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Its only fruit. Didst Thou his sin repay,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;He like a snail or wax would melt away.<br> Therefore forgive, nor press him in his trouble.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Moth-like he rots, old joys he can but weep,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_54"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 54</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Lord, what is man? A lonely creature driven<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like fallen leaf, bemocked by empty words,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;As full of guile as basket is of birds.<br> His rottenness would swift as smoke be riven,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Didst Thou his measure, not Thy measure keep.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His stroke comes sudden and he falls on sleep.</p>
