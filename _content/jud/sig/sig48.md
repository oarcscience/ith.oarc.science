### 45

### MY HEART CLAMOURS

My heart craves to praise Thee,  
But I am unable.  
Would my understanding  
Were as spacious as Solomon’s.  
Without it my wisdom  
As yet ill suffices  
For expounding Thy wonders  
And Thy deeds of beneficence  
Wrought for me and all mankind.  
Without Thee all’s hopeless,  
And where is the rock  
Sustaining, suspending  
The weight of the world?  
I am as one orphaned;  
Nay, on Thee I am cast.  
What then can I do  
But look to Thee, wait on Thee,  
In whose hand is the spirit  
Of all that is living,  
In whose hand is the breath  
Of all the creation?
