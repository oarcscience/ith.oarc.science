#### XXXIX.

May it please Thee, O Lord my God,  
To return to me in mercy,  
And to bring me back to Thee in perfect repentance.  
O dispose my heart and turn Thine ear to supplication,  
And open my heart to Thy law,  
And plant in my thoughts the fear of Thee, <span id="page_121">p.

And decree for me good decrees,  
And annul the evil decrees against me,  
And lead me not into the power of temptation,  
Nor into the power of contempt,  
And from all evil chances deliver me,  
And hide me in Thy shadow until the havoc pass by,  
And be with my mouth in my meditation,  
And keep my ways from sin through my tongue,  
And remember me when Thou rememberest and favourest Thy people,  
And when Thou rebuildest Thy Temple,  
That I may behold the bliss of Thy chosen ones,  
And purify me to seek diligently Thy Sanctuary devastated and ruined,  
And to cherish its stones and its dust,  
And the clods of its desolation,  
And rebuild Thou its wastes!
