<p>O my God,<br> If my iniquity is too great to be borne,<br> What wilt Thou do for Thy great name&#146;s sake?<br> And if I do not wait on Thy mercies,<br> Who will have pity on me but Thee?<br> Therefore though Thou shouldst slay me, yet will I trust in Thee.<br> For if Thou shouldst pursue my iniquity,<br> I will flee from Thee to Thyself,<br> And I will shelter myself from Thy wrath in Thy shadow,<br> And to the skirts of Thy mercies I will lay hold until Thou hast had mercy on me,<br> And I will not let Thee go till Thou hast blessed me.<br> Remember, I pray Thee, that of slime Thou hast made me,<br> And by all these hardships tried me,<br> Therefore visit me not according to my wanton dealings,<br> Nor feed me on the fruit of my deeds, <A NAME="page_119"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 119</FONT></A><br> But prolong Thy patience, nor bring near my day,<br> Until I shall have prepared provision for returning to my eternal home,<br> Nor rage against me to send me hastily from the earth,<br> With my sins bound up in the kneading-trough on my shoulder.<br> And when Thou placest my sins in the balance<br> Place Thou in the other scale my sorrows,<br> And while recalling my depravity and frowardness,<br> Remember my affliction and my harrying,<br> And place these against the others.<br> And remember, I pray Thee, O my God,<br> That Thou hast driven me rolling and wandering like Cain,<br> And in the furnace of exile hast tried me,<br> And from the mass of my wickedness refined me,<br> And I know &#146;tis for my good Thou hast proved me,<br> And in faithfulness afflicted me,<br> And that it is to profit me at my latter end<br> That Thou hast brought me through this testing by troubles.<br> Therefore, O God, let Thy mercies be moved toward me,<br> And do not exhaust Thy wrath upon me,<br> Nor reward me according to my works,<br> But cry to the Destroying Angel:<br> Enough! <A NAME="page_120"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 120</FONT></A><br> For what height or advantage have I attained<br> That Thou shouldst pursue me for my iniquity,<br> And shouldst post a watch over me,<br> And trap me like an antelope in a snare?<br> Is not the bulk of my days past and vanished?<br> Shall the rest consume in their iniquity?<br> And if I am here to-day before Thee,<br> "To-morrow Thine eyes are upon me and I am not."<br> "And now wherefore should I die<br> And this Thy great fire devour me?"<br> O my God, turn Thine eyes favourably upon me<br> For the remainder of my brief days,<br> Pursue not their escaping survivors,<br> Nor let the remnant of the crops that the hail hath spared<br> Be finished off by the locust for my sins.<br> For am I not the creation of Thy hands,<br> And what shall it avail Thee<br> That the worm shall take me for its meal<br> And feed on the product of Thy hands?</p>
