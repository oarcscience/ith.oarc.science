<p>Thou art the God of Gods, and the Lord of Lords,<br> Ruler of beings celestial and terrestrial,<br> For all creatures are Thy witnesses<br> And by the glory of this Thy name, every creature is bound to Thy service.<br> Thou art God, and all things formed are Thy servants and worshippers.<br> Yet is not Thy glory diminished by reason of those that worship aught beside Thee,<br> For the yearning of them all is to draw nigh Thee, <A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A><br> But they are like the blind,<br> Setting their faces forward on the King&#146;s highway,<br> Yet still wandering from the path.<br> One sinketh into the well of a pit<br> And another falleth into a snare,<br> But all imagine they have reached their desire,<br> Albeit they have suffered in vain.<br> But Thy servants are as those walking clear-eyed in the straight path,<br> Turning neither to the right nor the left<br> Till they come to the court of the King&#146;s palace.<br> Thou art God, by Thy Godhead sustaining all that hath been formed,<br> And upholding in Thy Unity all creatures.<br> Thou art God, and there is no distinction &#146;twixt Thy Godhead and Thy Unity, Thy pre-existence and Thy existence,<br> For &#146;tis all one mystery.<br> And although the name of each be different,<br> "Yet they are all proceeding to one place."</p>
