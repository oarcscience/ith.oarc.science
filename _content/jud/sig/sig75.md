#### XXIII.

O Lord, who shall search out Thy profundities?  
For Thou hast set apart above the sphere of the constellations  
The sphere that is ninth in order,  
That encompasseth all the spheres and their creatures,  
Wherein they are closed up,  
Which driveth all the stars of heaven and their planets  
From the east to the west in the might of its movement.  
Once a day it bows down in the west to the King who enthroned it, <span

And all the creatures of the universe in its midst are as a grain of
mustard in the vast ocean  
From the mighty vastness of its breadth.  
Yet all this and its greatness are accounted as nothing and naught  
By the side of the greatness of its Creator and King,  
And all its sublimities and grandeur  
"Are vain and void in comparison with Him."
