<p>Who can grasp Thy wonders?<br> For Thou hast appointed him to furnish light to the stars<br> Of high or low degree,<br> And to the Moon,<br> "If that white bright spot stays in its place"<br> And according as she moves away to stand opposite the Sun,<br> She receiveth his shining<br> Until his light is at the full when she stands before him,<br> And it irradiates her whole face.<br> And when that she draws nigh in the latter half of the month,<br> And declineth from him<br> And is far from standing opposite him<br> And proceedeth to the side of him,<br> In that degree waneth her splendour,<br> Till the end of her month and her circuit,<br> And she declineth to her extreme rim.<br> And when she is in conjunction with him<br> She is hid in secret places<br> For a day and half an hour<br> And some numbered moments,<br> And after that she is renewed and returneth to her prior self<br> And "issueth forth as a bridegroom from his chamber."</p>
