<p>Unworthy am I of all the mercies and all the truth<br> Which Thou hast wrought for Thy servant.<br> Verily, O Lord my God, will I thank Thee<br> For that Thou hast given me a holy soul,<br> Though by my deeds I have defiled it,<br> Polluted and profaned it with my evil inclination.<br> But I know that if I wrought wickedly,<br> I harmed but myself, never Thee.<br> In sooth, at my right hand my fierce inclination<br> As an adversary standeth,<br> Allowing me no breathing-space to establish my tranquillity.<br> Oft have I purposed with double bridle to lead him,<br> From the sea of his lusts to dry land to restore him,<br> But I could not prevail.<br> My devices he baulked, made profanities flow from my lips.<br> I think thoughts of simplicity, he fabricates guile and iniquity,<br> I am for peace, and he is for war,<br> To the point that he made me his footstool,<br> And even in peace-time shed the blood of war.<br> How oft have I sallied forth to combat against him,<br> And set in battle-array<br> My camp of service and repentance,<br> And placed the host of Thy mercies beside me for auxiliary, <A NAME="page_114"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 114</FONT></A><br> For I said, if my evil inclination<br> Shall come to one camp and shall smite it,<br> Then the camp that is left shall escape.<br> As I thought, so it was.<br> For temptation has routed me and scattered my forces,<br> So that there is nothing left me but the camp of Thy mercies.<br> But yet I know that by these I shall overcome it,<br> And they shall be unto me better than a city of refuge.<br> Peradventure I shall prevail and smite it and drive it away.</p>
