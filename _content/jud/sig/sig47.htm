<p>Let earth and sea and the Temple&#146;s throng<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And every highway become exalted,<br> The world and all who therein do dwell,<br> And every creature of fen and fell,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In a melody nevermore halted,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With forest and meadow and all their yield,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruit of the woodland and fruit of the field,<br> Unite in an ecstasy deep and strong<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In a rapturous endeavour,<br> With a single mouth in a single song,<br> Their spheral symphony to prolong,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>  
<p>The pundits vainly enquire His source,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His secret, the wonder of His foundation.<br> Where is His throne, or His light, or His force,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And who in His council dares take a station?<br> Sublime and hidden beyond our quest,<br> His essence unfathomed and unexpressed,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Even in sacred song and story,<br> This to declare is our sole resource,<br> That all the earth in its daily course<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Overflows with its Maker&#146;s glory.<br> This is the reach of our poor endeavour,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Then who beside shall by man be blest?<br> For He is One on His throne above,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And His lonely sway shall be shaken never.<br> Then let all creatures in awe and love,<br> Man or insect, or serpent or dove,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Now bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>

<p>His bands of ministers gleam and flash<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Like living coals or with flames for features,<br> Squadrons of four-winged cherubim dash,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;By the steps of His throne are the mystic creatures<br> With their chariot-wheels, and at His behest,<br> They run in His service with holy zest,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;All united together run,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;One in song and in service one,<br> Every being of all the blest<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;In a loyalty naught can sever.<br> Wherefore sing to Him every breast,<br> Tranced in His adoration rest,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>  
<p>His domain is established, His Peace secure,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;On the beams of the earth and the clouds He rides,<br> The homesick exile he vows to cure,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Who now amid thistle and thorn resides,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And the day of redemption in trust abides.<br> Yea, the remnant shall yet as a people endure,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Regathered, forgiven, when He decides,<br> And live as a nation unique and pure,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For when it was chosen and glorified,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its mission it knew and its task descried,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;That the love of God be its high endeavour,<br> And its purpose His reverence to assure,<br> The world to His worship by faith allure,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And bless the Lord who is blessed forever.</p>
