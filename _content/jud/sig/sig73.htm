<p>Who shall attain to Thy exaltation?<br> For Thou hast encompassed the sphere of Saturn with an eighth sphere of encompassment,<br> And it is laden with the twelve constellations<br> On the line of the belt of its ephod,<br> And all the higher stars of cloudland<br> Fixed in its rigidity.<br> And every star of them compasseth its circuit in six and thirty thousand years,<br> From the greatness of its altitude;<br> And the body of each is a hundred and seven times that of the earth,<br> And this is the limit of its greatness.<br> And from the might of these stars<br> Is drawn the strength of all creatures below,<br> Each after its kind,<br> According to the will of the Creator who hath appointed them,<br> And set every one of them in its fit station,<br> And given it its name,<br> "Each man to his service and his station."</p>
