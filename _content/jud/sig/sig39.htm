<p>O habitants of homes of clay,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Why lift ye such a swelling eye,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Ye are but as the beasts that die,<br> What do ye boast of more than they?</p>  
<p>It is for us the wiser part<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To know ourselves for worms whose doom<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Is in the clay to find a tomb,<br> Nor, falsely proud, exalt our heart.</p>  
<p>What shall aught profit mortal man<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Whose latter end adjoins the grave?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Here were no change, though Nature gave<br> A thousand years to be his span.</p>  
<p>Should he as rebel walk, behold<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Earth opens hot to swallow up<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;His ashes in her flaming cup<br> And vain is all his might of gold.</p>  
<p>Unhappy man, with chastened soul,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And opened eyes, true vision win,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;To see thy lowly origin<br> And thy inevitable goal.</p>  
<p>To what may be compared thy lot?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art, O weak and wretched wight,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The gourd that shot up in the night<br> And in the morning it was not.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_62"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 62</FONT></A></p>  
<p>To be unborn were better worth<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Than thus to reap distress and pain,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For how essay great things to gain<br> When struggling in this snare of earth?</p>  
<p>A fallen creature from the womb,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou sinnest for a slice of bread,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And in a moment&#146;s wildered dread,<br> Can live through every plague and gloom</p>  
<p>While spirit with thy body links,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;With living light shall glow thy flesh,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But should the soul desert its mesh,<br> To mire and sliminess it sinks.</p>  
<p>Behold no jot with thee will stay<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the glory now so great,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers shall seize thy loved estate,<br> And empty thou shalt go away.</p>  
<p>Thy soul thou gavest o&#146;er to lust,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Nor pondered on this bitter truth.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;But if thou sinnest in thy youth,<br> What wilt thou do when thou art dust?</p>  
<p>O let the wicked turn aside,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;And take, O King, the path to Thee.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Perchance the Rock will heed the plea,<br> And from His wrath the sinner hide.</p>  
<p>O haughty-souled, come gather all,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Remember and stand fast and raise<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Your heart and hands in common praise<br> And thus to God in heaven call:</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_63"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 63</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"Woe to our souls, and wellaway<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;For all the sins that we have sinned,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Alas, we have pursued the wind<br> And like to sheep have gone astray.</p>  
<p>"What favour can we ask or grace?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The wave of sin has overflowed<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Our heads, and heavy is our load<br> Of guilt, how dare we lift our face?</p>  
<p>"Draw up Thy people from the pit,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou Ruler of the depth and height,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Stiff-necked were we in Thy despite,<br> Yet of Thy mercies bate no whit</p>  
<p>"But shed Thy sweet compassion o&#146;er<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;The people knocking at Thy gate,<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art the Master of our fate,<br> And unto Thee our eyes upsoar."</p>
