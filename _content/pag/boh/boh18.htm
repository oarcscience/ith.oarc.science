<P>Bring forth the raisins and the nuts--<BR>
To-night All Hallows' Spectre struts<BR>
Along the moonlit way.<BR>
No time is this for tear or sob,<BR>
Or other woes our joys to rob,<BR>
But time for Pippin and for Bob,<BR>
And Jack-o'-lantern gay.</P>
<P>Come forth, ye lass and trousered kid,<BR>
From prisoned mischief raise the lid,<BR>
And lift it good and high.<BR>
Leave grave old Wisdom in the lurch,<BR>
Set Folly on a lofty perch,<BR>
Nor fear the awesome rod of birch<BR>
When dawn illumes the sky.</P>
<P>'Tis night for revel, set apart<BR>
To reillume the darkened heart,<BR>
And rout the hosts of Dole.<BR>
'Tis night when Goblin, Elf, and Fay,<BR>
Come dancing in their best array<BR>
To prank and royster on the way,<BR>
And ease the troubled soul.</P>
<P>The ghosts of all things, past parade,<BR>
Emerging from the mist and shade<BR>
That hid them from our gaze,<BR>
And full of song and ringing mirth,<BR>
In one glad moment of rebirth,<BR>
Again they walk the ways of earth,<BR>
As in the ancient days.</P>
<P>The beason light shines on the hill,<BR>
The will-o'-wisps the forests fill<BR>
With flashes filched from noon;<BR>
And witches on thier broomsticks spry<BR>
Speed here and yonder in the sky,<BR>
And lift their strident voices high<BR>
Unto the Hunter's moon.</P>
<P>The air resounds with tuneful notes<BR>
From myriads of straining throats,<BR>
All hailing Folly Queen;<BR>
So join the swelling choral throng,<BR>
Forget your sorrow and your wrong,<BR>
In one glad hour of joyous song<BR>
To honor Hallowe'en.</P>

<P>Who's dat peekin' in de do'?<BR>
Set mah heart a-beatin'!<BR>
Thought I see' a spook for sho<BR>
On mah way to meetin'.<BR>
Heerd a rustlin' all aroun',<BR>
Trees all sort o' jiggled;<BR>
An' along de frosty groun'<BR>
Funny shadders wriggled.</P>
<P>Who's dat by de winder-sill?<BR>
Gittin' sort o' skeery;<BR>
Feets is feelin' kind o' chill,<BR>
Eyes is sort o' teary.<BR>
'Most as nervous as a coon<BR>
When de dawgs is barkin',<BR>
Er a widder when some spoon<BR>
Comes along a-sparkin'.</P>
<P>Whass dat creepin' up de road,<BR>
Quiet like a ferret,<BR>
Hoppin' sof'ly as a toad?<BR>
Maybe hit's a sperrit!<BR>
Lordy! hope dey ain't no ghos'<BR>
Come to tell me howdy.<BR>
I ain't got no use for those<BR>
Fantoms damp an' cloudy.</P>
<P>Whass dat standin' by de fence<BR>
Wid its eyes a-yearnin',<BR>
Drivin' out mah common-sense<BR>
Wid its glances burnin'?<BR>
Don't dass skeercely go to bed<BR>
Wid dem spookses roun' me.<BR>
Ain't no res' fo' dis yere head<BR>
When dem folks surroun' me.</P>
<P>Whass dat groanin' soun' I hear<BR>
Off dar by de gyardin?<BR>
Lordy! Lordy! Lordy dear,<BR>
Grant dis sinner pardon!<BR>
I won't nebber--I declar'<BR>
Ef it ain't my Sammy!<BR>
Sambo, what yo' doin' dar?<BR>
Yo' can't skeer yo' mammy!</P>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HALLOWE'EN</H3>
<P>Pixie, kobold, elf, and sprite<BR>
All are on their rounds to-night,--<BR>
In the wan moon's silver ray<BR>
Thrives their helter-skelter play.</P>
<P>Fond of cellar, barn, or stack<BR>
True unto the almanac,<BR>
They present to credulous eyes<BR>
Strange hobgoblin mysteries.</P>
<P>Cabbage-stumps--straws wet with dew--<BR>
Apple-skins, and chestnuts too,<BR>
And a mirror for some lass<BR>
Show what wonders come to pass.</P>
<P>Doors they move, and gates they hide<BR>
Mischiefs that on moonbeams ride<BR>
Are their deeds,--and, by their spells,<BR>
Love records its oracles.</P>
<P>Don't we all, of long ago<BR>
By the ruddy fireplace glow,<BR>
In the kitchen and the hall,<BR>
Those queer, coof-like pranks recall?</P>
<P>Eery shadows were they then--<BR>
But to-night they come again;<BR>
Were we once more but sixteen<BR>
Precious would be Hallowe'en.</P>
<P>--JOEL BENTON in Harper's Weekly, Oct. 31, 1896.</P>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">HALLOWE'EN</H3>
<P>A gypsy flame in on the hearth,<BR>
Sign of this carnival of mirth.<BR>
Through the dun fields and from the glade<BR>
Flash merry folk in masquerade--<BR>
It is the witching Hallowe'en.</P>
<P>Pale tapers glimmer in the sky,<BR>
The dead and dying leaves go by;<BR>
Dimly across the faded green<BR>
Strange shadows, stranger shades, are seen,--<BR>
It is the mystic Hallowe'en.</P>
<P>Soft gusts of love and memory<BR>
Beat at the heart reproachfully;<BR>
The lights that burn for those who die<BR>
Were flickering low, let them flare high--<BR>
It is the haunting Hallowe'en.</P>
<P>--A.F. MURRAY in Harper's Weekly, Oct. 30, 1909.</P>
