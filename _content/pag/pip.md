## Ancient Forms of {Pre-Islamic} Pagan Worship

pp. 1612-1623 of *The Holy Qur'an, Text, Translation and Commentary* by
Abdullah Yusuf Ali, \[1946\]

{Scanned at Intangible Textual Heritage, October, 2001. This is a short
excerpt from an appendix to an English translation of the Qur'an, which
describes the pagan beliefs in the Arabian peninsula prior to the rise
of Islam. It is written by a devout Muslim, so this point of view is
evident throughout.

This is one of the few treatments of this fascinating but
little-understood subject which I have found. I have appended the
translation and notes for the portion of the Qur'an (Surah lxxi.)
mentioned in the body of the appendix. This is also of interest because
it gives the Islamic take on the story of Noah. In verse 23 of this
Surah, five pre-Islamic pagan deities are mentioned by name: Wadd,
Suwâ\`, Yagûth, Ya\`ûq and Nasr. Believers in the existence of the
Necronomicon (itself purportedly a mediaeval Arabic document) will take
note of Yagûth in this list. In the appendix, Ali also describes a
trinity of pre-Islamic goddesses: Lât, \`Uzzâ, and Manât; this
information will be of interest to Wiccans.

Note that the appendix, from p. 1619-23 in the original book, is first
in this document, followed by the excerpt from the Qur'an, p. 1612-8, so
the page numbering below is out of order.--*jbh*}

{p. 1619}

### APPENDIX XIII.

From prehistoric times man has sought to worship powers of nature, or
symbols representing those powers, or idols representing those symbols.
In vulgar minds they become debased superstitions, and seem to come into
competition with the worship of the one True God.

2\. The five names mentioned in lxxi. 23 represent some of the oldest
Pagan cults, before the Flood as well as after the Flood, though the
names themselves are in the form in which they were worshipped by local
Arab tribes. The names of the tribes have been preserved to us by the
Commentators, but they are of no more than archæological interest to us
now. But the names of the false gods are interesting to us from the
point of view of comparative religion, as, under one form or another,
such cults still exist in countries which have not accepted the Gospel
of Unity, as they have always existed since man turned from his Maker
and Sustainer to the worship of created things or invented fancies.

3\. The names of the five false gods and the symbols under which they
were represented were as follows:--

It is not clear whether these names are to be connected with true Arabic
verbal roots or are merely Arabicised forms of names derived from
foreign cults, such as those of Babylonia or Assyria, the region of
Noah's Flood. The latter supposition is probable. Even in the case of
*Wadd* (Affection, Love) and *Nasr* (Eagle), which are good Arabic
words, it is doubtful whether they are not, in this connection,
translations or corruptions of words denoting foreign cults.

4\. In studying ancient comparative mythologies we must never forget the
following facts. (1) Men's ideas of God always tend to be
anthropomorphic. The qualities which they admire they transfer to their
godhead. (2) But fear in primitive man also leads to the transfer of
anything mysterious or imagined to be injurious, to the Pantheon. Such
things have to be placated in order that they may not injure man. Thus
in popular Hinduism the goddess of small-pox, which causes terror over
an ignorant countryside, has to be worshipped, placated, or appeased
with sacrifice. (3) This leads to the worship of animals noxious to man,
such as serpent-worship, which

{p. 1620}

has prevailed and still prevails in many primitive areas. In ancient
Egyptian mythology the Crocodile (so common in the Nile), the Dog, the
Bull, and the Ibis were worshipped both literally and symbolically. See
Appendix V, p. 409. (4) But as men's knowledge grows, and they observe
the wonderful heavenly bodies and their motions, they begin to feel
their sublimity, beauty and mystery, and they transfer their worship to
the heavenly bodies. The first great astronomers in the ancient world
were the Babylonians and Chaldæans. Among them was Abraham's homeland.
The allegory of Abraham (vi, 74-82 and notes) points to the importance
of the cult of the worship of heavenly bodies and the fallacy in them.
"It is those who believe, and confuse not their beliefs with wrong-that
are truly in security, for they are on right guidance" (vi. 82). The
Sabæan worship of heavenly bodies in Arabia had probably its source in
Chaldæa (see last paragraph of n. 76 to ii. 62). (5) A further refined
step in Paganism is to worship abstractions, to treat concrete things as
symbols of abstract qualities which they represent. For example, the
planet Saturn with its slow motion was treated as phlegmatic and evil.
The planet Mars with its fiery red light was treated as betokening war
and havoc and evil, and so on. Jupiter, with its magnificent golden
light, was treated as lucky and benignant to any who came tinder its
influence. Venus became the symbol and the goddess of carnal love. The
Pagan Arabs erected Time (*Dahr*) into a deity, existing from eternity
to eternity, and dispensing good and ill fortune to men. The ancient
Ægean religion treated the vital principle in the same way, as
spontaneous and eternal, and traces of this are found in many religions,
ancient and modern. (6) The next step was to reincarnate as it were
these qualities in beings of flesh and blood, with lives, feelings, and
passions like those of ordinary men and women, and to fill up a confused
Pantheon with gods and goddesses that quarrelled, hated, loved, were
jealous, and suffered or enjoyed life like human beings. In such a
Pantheon there was room for demi-gods and real human heroes that were
worshipped as gods. The Greek poets and artists were past masters in
carrying out this process, under cover of which they discussed profound
human problems, with great power. They made religion dramatic. While
they gained in humanism, they lost the purer spiritual conceptions which
lift the divine world far above the futilities and crimes of this life.
Hierarchical Christianity has suffered from this inheritance of the
Greek tradition. (7) Where there was a commingling of peoples and
cultures, several of these ideas and processes got mixed up together.
Gods and goddesses of different origins were identified one with
another, *e.g.* Artemis, the chaste virgin huntress goddess of the Greek
Pantheon, was identified with Diana of the Romans, Diana of the
Ephesians (representing the teeming life of nature), and Selene the cold
moon-goddess. Similarly Diana was identified with the Egyptian Isis, and
Diana's twin-brother Apollo (the sun) with the Egyptian Osiris. Forces
of nature, animals, trees, qualities, astronomical bodies, and various
other factors got mixed up together, and formed a shapeless medley of
superstitions, which are all condemned by Islam.

5\. To revert to the worship of the heavenly bodies. The countless fixed
stars in the firmament occupied always the same relative positions in
the heavens, and did not impress the imagination of the ancients like
the objects which stood out vividly with mysterious laws of relative
motion. A few individual stars did attract the worshippers' attention;
e.g. Sirius the Dog-star, the brightest fixed star in the heavens, with
a bluish tinge in its light, and Algol the variable star, being Beta of
the constellation

{p. 1621}

Perseus, whose variations can be perceived by the naked eye in two or
three nights, became connected with many legends, myths, and
superstitions. It is probably Sirius that is referred to as the fixed
star in the Parable of Abraham (vi. 76). With regard to the fixed stars
in their myriads, the astronomers turned their fancy to devising Groups
or Constellations. But the moving "stars", or planets, each with its own
individual laws of motion, stood out to them personified, each with a
motion and therefore will or influence of its own. As they knew and
understood them, they were seven in number, viz.: (1) and (2) the moon
and the Sun, the two objects which most closely and indubitably
influence the tides, the temperatures, and the life on our planet; (3)
and (4) the two inner planets, Mercury and Venus, which are morning and
evening stars, and never travel far from the sun; and (5), (6), and (7)
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, the outer planets, whose elongations from the
sun on the ecliptic can be as wide as possible. The number seven became
itself a mystic number, as explained in n. 5526 to lxv. 12.

6\. It will be noticed that the sun and the moon and the five planets
got identified each with a living deity, god or goddess, with
characteristics and qualities of its own. The solar myth was a myth of
very fruitful vitality, and got mixed up with many other myths and
ideas. In late Roman religion it appears in the story of Apollo, the
sun-god of light and learning and of manly beauty, twin brother to Diana
the moon. goddess. In ancient Egypt it appears in the myth of Horus, the
falcon-eyed, or of Ra or Rè, the Eye, which sees all things. Further,
the eagle, or falcon, or hawk, became itself identified with the sun,
with its piercing light. The sun myth mixes itself up with the myth of
the Nile and with the cycle of legends connected with Isis and Osiris,
who were subsequently identified with the moon and the sun divinities.
In Babylon the name Shamash (Arabic, *Shams*) proclaims the glory of the
sun-god corresponding to the old Sumerian Utu or Babbar, while the hymns
to Sûrya (the sun) in the Rig-Veda and the cult of Mithra in Persia
proclaim the dominance of sun-worship.

7\. Moon-worship was equally popular in various forms. I have already
referred to the classical legends of Apollo and Diana, twin brother and
sister, representing the sun and the moon. The Egyptian Khonsu,
traversing the sky in a boat, referred to the moon, and the moon legends
also got mixed up with those about the god of magic, Thoth, and the
Ibis. In the Vedic religion of India the moon-god was Soma, the lord of
the planets, and the name was also applied to the juice which was the
drink of the gods. It may be noted that the moon was a male divinity in
ancient India; it was also a male divinity in ancient Semitic religion,
and the Arabic word for the moon (*qamar*) is of the masculine gender.
On the other hand, the Arabic word for the sun (*shams*) is of the
feminine gender. The Pagan Arabs evidently looked upon the sun as a
goddess and the moon as a god.

8\. Of the five planets, perhaps Venus as the evening star and the
morning star alternately impressed itself most on the imagination of
astro-mythology. This planet was in different places considered both
male and female. In the Bible (Isaiah, xiv. 12), the words "How art thou
fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning!" are understood to refer to the
Morning Star in the first instance, and by analogy to the King of
Babylon. The Fathers of the Christian Church, on the other hand,
transferred the name Lucifer to Satan, the power of evil. Mercury is a
less conspicuous planet, and was looked upon as a child in the family,
the father and mother being the moon and the sun, or the sun

{p. 1621}

and the moon (according to the sex attributed to these divinities), or
else either the sun or the moon was the father and Venus the mother (the
sexes being inter-changeable in the myths). Of the three outer planets,
Jupiter is the most conspicuous: indeed, after the sun and the moon, it
is the most conspicuous object in the heavens, and was reputed to be
beneficent and to bestow good fortune. The sun and the moon being
considered in a class apart, Jupiter was considered the father of the
planets, and possibly his worship got occasionally mixed tip with that
of the sun. Mars and Saturn, as has already been stated, were considered
malevolent planets, to be feared for the mischief that they might do;
for the Pagan Pantheons worshipped powers both of good and evil.

9\. It is remarkable that the days of the week are named after the seven
planets of geocentric astronomy, and if we take them in alternate
sequence they indicate the order in which their heavens were arranged
with reference to proximity to the earth. The following table represents
this grouping:--

This alternate sequence is carried into a circle, as the total number is
seven, itself a mystic number.

10\. These cross-currents and mixtures of nature-worship,
astral-worship, hero-worship, worship of abstract qualities, etc.,
resulted in a medley of debasing superstitions which are summed up in
the five names, Wadd, Suwâ\`, Yagûth, Ya\`ûq, and Nasr, as noted in
paragraph 3 above. The time of Noah is taken to be the peak of
superstition and false worship, and the most ancient cults may thus be
symbolically brought under these heads. If Wadd and Suwâ\` represented
Man and Woman, they might well represent the astral-worship of the moon
and the sun, or the sun and the moon, or they might represent human
self-glorification, the worship of Self as against God, or they might
represent the worship of Manly Power and Female Beauty, or other
abstract qualities of that kind. On the other hand, it is possible that
the worship of Jupiter and Venus itself got mixed up with the worship of
the sun-moon pair. One pair being identified with another pair in a
Septet, the number seven was reduced to five, and the five (itself a
mystic number) might itself represent the seven planets as then
worshipped. Further, it may be that Nasr (the vulture, falcon, hawk, or
eagle, the Egyptian Horus) also represents a solar myth, mixed up with
the cult of the planets. These cross-currents of astro-mythological
mixtures of cults are well-known to students of ancient popular
religions. If the five names, from another angle of vision, represent
qualities, the Wadd-Suwâ\` pair (Sun-Moon, Jupiter-Venus) would
represent manly power and womanly beauty or mutability respectively, and
the three remaining ones (paragraph 3) might represent Brute Strength,
like that of a Bull or a Lion; Swiftness like that of a Horse or
sharpness (of sight or intelligence) like that of a vulture, hawk, or
eagle.

{p. 1623}

11\. It may be noted that the five names of deities mentioned here to
represent very ancient religious cults are well-chosen. They are not the
names of the deities best known in Mecca, but rather those which
survived as fragments of very ancient cults among the outlying tribes of
Arabia, which were influenced by the cults of Mesopotamia (Noah's
country). The Pagan deities best known in the Ka\`ba and round about
Mecca were Lât, \`Uzzâ, and Manât. (Manât was also known round
Ya<u>th</u>rib, which afterwards became Medina.) See liii. 19-20. They
were all female goddesses. Lât almost certainly represents another wave
of sun-worship: the sun being feminine in Arabic and in Semitic
languages generally. "Lât" may be the original of the Greek "Leto", the
mother of Apollo the sun-god (*Encyclopædia of Islam*, I., p. 380). If
so, the name was brought in prehistoric times from South Arabia by the
great Incense Route (n. 3816 to xxxiv. 18) to the Mediterranean. \`Uzzâ
probably represents the planet Venus. The origin of Manât is not quite
clear, but it would not be surprising if it also turned out to be
astral. The 360 idols established by the Pagans in the Ka\`ba probably
represented the 360 days of an inaccurate solar year. This was the
actual "modern" Pagan worship as known to the Quraish contemporary with
our Prophet. In sharp contrast to this is mentioned the ancient
antediluvian worship under five heads, of which fragments persisted in
outlying places, as they still persist in different forms and under
different names in all parts of the world where the pure worship of God
in unity and truth is not firmly established in the minds and hearts of
men.

References: The classical work on Arabian idol-worship is Ibn al-Kalbi's
*Kitrâb-ul-asnâm*, of the late second century of the Hijra. The book is
not easily accessible. Our doctors of religion have evinced no interest
in the study of ancient cults, or in comparative religion, and most of
them had not before them the results of modern archæology. But a modern
school of Egyptian archæologists is arising, which takes a great deal of
interest in the antiquities of their own country. For astral worship
consult Hastings' *Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics*, articles on
"Sun, Moon, and Stars," as worshipped in different countries. Consult
also Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, *Gods of the Egyptians*, London 1904; A. H.
Sayce, *Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia*, Gifford Lectures,
Edinburgh 1902; M. Jastrow, *Religion of Babylonia and Assyria*, Boston
1898; E. W. Hopkins, *Religions of India*, London 1896; G. A. Barton,
*Sketches of Semitic Origins*, New York 1902. Any Classical Dictionary
would give details of Greek and Roman Mythology. It is curious that the
Indus Civilization, which resembles the Second Pre-diluvian Culture of
Elam and Mesopotamia, does not clearly disclose any signs of astral
worship. But this study is still in its tentative stage. There is tree
and animal worship, phallic worship. and the worship of the great
Mother-goddess. Animal worship regards strength, courage, virility, or
swiftness, as in the Pagan Arabian deities we have been considering. See
Sir John Marshall, *Mohenjo Daro and the Indus Civilization*, 3 vols.
London 1931.

Sir J. G. Frazer, in his *Adonis, Attis, and Osiris* (4th ed., London
1914, Vol. I, pp. 8-9) refers to *Allatu* or Eresh-Kigal as "the stern
queen of the infernal regions" in Babylonian religion: she was the
goddess of the nether regions, of darkness and desolation, as her
counterpart Ishtar was the chief goddess of the upper regions, of
reproduction and fertility, associated with the planet Venus.

#### INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY: SÛRA LXXI (Nû<u>h</u>).

This is another early Meccan Sûra, of which the date has no
significance. The theme is that while Good must uphold the standard of
Truth and Righteousness, a stage is reached when it must definitely part
company with Evil, lest Evil should spread its corruption abroad. This
theme is embodied in the prayer of Noah just before the Flood. The story
of Noah's agony is almost a Parable for the holy Prophet's persecution
in the Meccan period.

C. 251. (lxxi. 1-28.).--

The Prophet's Message, as was that of Noah,  
Is a warning against sin, and the Good News of Mercy  
Through the door of Repentance: for God is loving  
And long-suffering, and His Signs are within us  
And around us. But the sinners are obstinate:  
They plot against Righteousness, and place their trust  
In futile falsehoods. They will be swept away,  
And the earth will be purged of Evil. Let us  
Pray for Mercy and Grace for ourselves,  
For those nearest and dearest to us,  
And for all who turn in faith to God,  
In all ages and all countries,  
And amongst all Peoples.

{p. 1613}

{footnotes p. 1613}

\[5705. Noah's mission is referred to in many places. See specially xl.
25-49 and notes. His contemporaries had completely abandoned the moral
law. A purge had. to be made, and the great Flood made it. This gives a
new starting point in history for Noah's People,--*i.e.* for the remnant
saved in the Ark.

5706\. His Warning was to be both clear (i.e. unambiguous) and open
(i.e. publicly proclaimed). Both these meanings are implied in Mubîn.
*Cf.* lxvii. 26. The meaning of the Warning was obviously that if they
had repented, they would have obtained mercy.

5707\. Three aspects of man's duty are emphasized: (1) true worship with
heart and soul; (2) God-fearing recognition that all evil must lead to
self-deterioration and judgment; (3) hence repentance and amendment of
life. and obedience to good men's counsels.

5708\. God gives respite freely; but it is for Him to give it. His
command is definite and final; neither man nor any other authority can
alter or in any way modify it. If we could only realise this to the full
in our inmost soul, it would be best for us and lead to our happiness.\]

{footnotes p. 1614}

\[5709. When convincing arguments and warnings are placed before
sinners, there are two kinds of reactions. Those who are wise receive
admonition, repent, and bring forth fruits of repentance, i.e. amend
their lives and turn to God. On the other hand, those who are callous to
any advice take it up as a reproach, fly farther and farther from
righteousness, and shut out more and more the channels through which
God's heating Grace can reach them and work for them.

5710\. The literal meaning would be that, just as they thrust their
fingers into their ears to prevent the voice of the admonisher reaching
them, so they covered their bodies with their garments that the light of
truth should not penetrate to them. and that they should not even be
seen by the Preacher. But there is a further symbolic meaning. "Their
garments" are the adornments of vanities, their evil habits, customs,
and traditions. and their ephemeral interests and standards. They drew
them closer round them to prevent the higher Light reaching them. They
grew obstinate and gave themselves up to the grossest form of selfish
arrogance.

5711\. Noah used all the resources of the earnest preacher: he dinned
the Message of God into their ears; he spoke in public places; and he
took individuals into his confidence, and appealed privately to them;
but all in vain.

5712\. They had perhaps been suffering from drought or famine. If they
had taken the message in the right way, the rain would have been a
blessing to them. They took it in the wrong way. and the rain was a
curse to them, for it flooded the country and drowned the wicked
generation. In the larger Plan, it was a blessing all the same; for it
purged the world, and gave it a new start, morally and spiritually.\]

\[5713. Each of these blessings--rain and crops, wealth and man-power.
flourishing gardens, and perennial streams--are indications of
prosperity, and have not only a material but also a spiritual meaning.
Note the last point, "rivers of flowing water". The perennial springs
make the prosperity as it were permanent: they indicate a settled
population, honest and contented, and enjoying their blessings here on
earth as the foretaste of the eternal joys of heaven.

5714\. *Cf.* xxii. 5, and notes 2773-2777; also xxiii. 12-17, and notes
2872-2875. The meaning here may be even wider. Man in his various states
exhibits various wonderful qualities or capacities. mental and
spiritual, that may be compared with the wonderful workings of nature on
the earth and in the heavens. Will he not then be grateful for these
Mercies and turn to God, Who created all these marvels?

5715\. See n. 5559 to lxvii. 3.

5716\. Cf. xxv. 61, where the sun is referred to as the glorious Lamp of
the heavens: "Blessed is He Who made the Constellations in the skies,
and placed therein a lamp, and a moon giving light."

5717\. Cf. iii. 37, where the growth of the child Mary the Mother of
Jesus is described by the same word *nabât*, ordinarily denoting the
growth of plants and trees. The simile is that of a seed sown, that
germinates, grows, and dies, and goes back to the earth. In man, there
is the further process of the Resurrection. Cf. also xx. 55.\]

{footnotes p. 1616}

\[5718. *Cf.* xx. 53,

5719\. *Fijâj* implies valley-roads or passes between mountains. Though
there are mountain chains on the earth, God's artistry has provided even
in such regions, valleys and channels by which men may go about.
Mountain roads usually follow the valleys.

5719-A. Sinners always resent it as a reproach that righteous men should
speak to them for their own good. They prefer smooth flatterers, and
they worship power even though the depositaries of power are selfish
men, who neither profit themselves nor profit others by the wealth and
man-power that they collect round themselves. They forget that mere
material things may be a delusion and a snare unless the moral and
spiritual factor behind them sanctifies them.

5720\. Having got material resources. the wicked devise plots to get rid
of the righteous whose presence is a reproach to them, For a time their
plots may seem tremendous and have the appearance of success, but they
can never defeat God's Purpose.

5721\. For an account of how these Pagan gods and superstitions
connected with them originated, and how they became adopted into the
Arabian Pagan Pantheon, see Appendix XIII at the end of this Sûra, pp.
1619.1623.\]

{footnotes p. 1617}

\[5722. Such Pagan superstitions and cults do not add to human knowledge
or human well-being. They only increase error and wrong-doing. For
example, how much lewdness resulted from the Greek and Roman Saturnalia!
And how much lewdness results from ribald Holt songs! This is the
natural result, and Noah in his bitterness of spirit prays that God's
grace may be cut off from men who hug them to their hearts. They mislead
others: let them miss their own mark! See also verse 28 below.

5723\. The Punishment of sin seizes the soul from every side and in
every form. Water (drowning) indicates death by suffocation, through the
nose, ears, eyes, mouth, throat, and lungs. Fire has the opposite
effects: it burns the skin, the limbs, the flesh, the brains, the bones,
and every part of the body. So the destruction wrought by sin is
complete from all points of view. And yet it is not death (xx. 74); for
death would be a merciful release from the Penalty, and the soul steeped
in sin has closed the gates of God's Mercy on itself. There they will
abide, unless and "except as God willeth" (vi. 128). For time and
eternity, as we conceive them now, have no meaning in the wholly new
world which the soul enters after death or judgment.

5724\. The Flood was sent in order to purge all sin. The prayer of Noah
is not vindictive. it simply means, "Cut off all the roots of sin ". See
next note.\]

{footnotes p. 1618}

\[5723. Indeed he prays for himself, his parents, his guests, and all
who in earnest faith turn to God, in all ages and in all places. Praying
for their forgiveness is also praying for the destruction of sin.

5726\. This is slightly different in form from verse 24 above, where see
n. 5722. See also last note.\]
