### THE SHAMROCK, AND OTHER SACRED PLANTS.

THE Shamrock is even more typical of Ireland than the Oak is of Britain,
and was the greater object of reverence and regard.

            "Chosen leaf  
              Of Bard and Chief,  
            Old Erin's native Shamrock!  
              Says Valour, 'See  
              They spring for me,  
            Those leafy gems of morning!'  
              Says Love, 'No, no,  
              For me they grow,  
            My fragrant path adorning!'  
              But Wit perceives  
              The triple leaves,  
            And cries,--'O do not sever  
              A type that blends  
              Three godlike friends,  
            Love, Valour, Wit, for ever!  
O! the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock!"

But Moore might have added the claims of Religion. Is it not a sacred
emblem of the Trinity? Does not the legend remind us of St Patrick
convincing his doubting hearers of the truth of the *Three in One*
doctrine, by holding up a piece of Shamrock? It is true that the
*Philosophical Magazine*, June 1830, throws some doubt on the story,
since the three-leaved white clover, now accepted as the symbol, was
hardly expanded so early in the year as St. Patrick's Day; and Irishmen
to this day do not agree which is the real Shamrock.

The trefoil that was sour was certainly eaten by primitive Irish, while
the white clover, not being sour, was not eaten. It may, therefore, have
been the Wood Sorrel, trefoil out in early spring. Spenser says--"If
they found a plot of watercresses or shamrocks, there they flocked as a
feast" Wyther wrote--"And feed on shamrooks as the

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

Irish doe." The word *Shamrock*, or *Shamrog*, is applied to various
trefoils, however, by Erse and Gaelic writers, though ancient herbalists
knew only the sour variety by that appellation. The Gaelic *seamarog* is
the little *seamar* trefoil. Dr. Moore of Glasnevin declares the *black
nonsuch* (Medicago lupulina) to be the true shamrock, though the white
clover is often sold for it.

The pious Angelico introduced the white clover in his sacred pictures,
like the Crucifixion, and as Ruskin thinks, "With a view to its chemical
property." Its antiquity is vouched for. Dr. Madden sings--

"'Tis the sunshine of Erin that glimmer'd of old  
On the banners of Green we have loved to behold,  
   On the Shamrock of Erin and the Emerald Isle."

Ancient bards declare that it was an object of worship with the remote
race of Tuath-de-Danaans. It was the emblem of the Vernal Equinox with
the Druids. Greek emblems of the Equinox were triform. As the *Seamrag*,
it was long used as an anodyne, being seen gathered for that purpose by
Scotch wives as late as 1794; it must, however, be gathered by the left
hand in silence, to preserve its virtues. The four-leaved shamrock is
called Mary's Shamrock. According to an engraving in Ledwich's
*Antiquities of Ireland*, the shamrock appears on the oldest Irish coin.
It is the badge of the Order of St. Patrick, founded in 1783, but the
national badge since 1801. Pale or Cambridge blue, not green, is the
true national colour of Ireland. But Ireland cannot claim sole
possession of it as a sacred symbol. It was the three-leaved wand of
Hermes, the triple oracle of the ancients. It was the three-leaved
sceptre of *Triphyllian Jove*. It was seen on the head of Isis, of
Osiris, and of a god of Mexico. It was recognized both on Persian and
Irish Crowns. We perceive upon a monument from Nineveh a

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

couple of sacred hares engaged in devouring it. The Berlin Museum has a
representation of some rude satyrs jestingly offering it to a woman.
Artists, in the Middle Ages, have shamelessly made it the plant
presented by the Angel to the Virgin Mary. The Bismarcks use the
shamrock with the motto "In trinitate robur." The sacred Palasa of India
has triple leaves. The French, like the Irish, retained it as a national
symbol. To this hour the *three-leaved*, or Fleur-de-lis plant is
preserved as a sacred, symbol in architecture, on altar-cloths, &c., the
emblem being now seen in Nonconformist churches as well as in the
Episcopalian.

It was the three-in-one mystery. "Adorning the head of Osiris, it fell
off at the moment of his death. As the trefoil symbolized generative
force in man, the loss of the garland was the deprivation of vigour in
the god, or, as some think, the suspension of animal strength. in
winter"

In the Dublin Museum is a beautiful copper vessel, or plate, with the
trefoil, from Japan. In the Mellor church of Derbyshire is a very
ancient font, with rude figures, horses, and men with Norman helmets.
The tails of the horses, after passing round the body, end in a rude
form of trefoil, which another horse, with open mouth, is prepare to
eat, while its own long tail is similarly presented to the open mouth of
its equine neighbour. The shamrock w mysteriously engraved on the neck
of the oriental crucified figure in the relic collection at Glendalough.

The OAK was also venerated by the early Irish. We read of *Kil-dair*,
the Druids' cell or church of the *Maig-adhair* or *Dearmhagh*, the
field of oaks; the *Daire-calgaich*, now Londonderry, the wood of
Calgac; *Dairbhre* (now Valentine, Isle of Kerry), the place producing
oaks Derrynane was *Doire-Fhionain*, the oak grove of Finian;
*Doire-maelain*, now Derryvullan, the grove of

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

Maelain; *Derrada-Doire-fhada*, the long oak grove; *Derrybeg*, little
oak; *Derry Duff*, black-oak wood. Derry is from *Doire* or *Dair*, oak.
Kildare was *Cill-dara*, the church of the oak. St. Bridgid of Kildare
built her cell, it is said, under a very high oak. Hanmer
wrote--"Bridget builded a cell for her abode under a goodly faire oke,
which afterwards grew to be a monasterie of virgins called *Cylldara*,
in Latin *Cella quercus*."

Druids were so named from *Dair, Doire, or* *Duir*--the oak. The Druids
were *Dairaoi*, or dwellers in oaks. There was the Gaulish *Drus* or
*Drys*, the Gaelic *Daru*, the Saxon *Dre* or *Dry*, the Breton *Derw*,
the Persian *Duracht*, the Sanscrit *Druh*.

The oak was thought sacred from its acorns being food for man in his
savage state. It was dedicated to Mars and Jupiter. Etrurian
inscriptions appear about the oak. The temple of the oracular Dodona was
in an oak forest We read that 456 B.C., a Roman Consul took an oak
solemnly to witness as a god. That tree was the symbol of the Gaulish
deity Hesus, as it was of the German Thor. The Dryades were priests of
the oak. It was associated with the *tau* or cross. "So far as I know,"
says Forlong, "the cutting of a live oak into a *tau*, or deity, is
unique on the part of the Druids." The stones in Sichem were placed
under an oak. The oak or terebinth of Mamre was worshipped as late as
the fourth century. The oak was sacred, as the acorn and its cup
represented the male and female principles.

The MISTLETOE had an early reputation as a guide to the other world.
Armed with that *golden branch*, one could pass to Pluto's realm:--

"Charon opposed--they showed the Branch.  
They show'd the bough that lay beneath the vest;  
At once his rising wrath was hush'd to rest."

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

Its connection with health, as the *All-heal*, is noted by the poet
Callimachus, under the appellation of panakea, sacred to Apollo:--

"Where'er the genial panakea falls,  
Health crowns the State, and safety guards the walls."

As the seat of the life of the Oak, as then believed, it had special
virtues as a healer. The Coel-Creni, or omen sticks, were made of it,
and also divining-rods. It had the merit of revealing treasure, and
repelling the unwelcome visits of evil spirits When cut upon St. John's
Eve, its, power for good was greatest "While the shamrock emblematic of
the equinox, the mistletoe is associated with the solstice," says St.
Clair.

The ancient Persians knew it as the healer. It told of the sun's return
to earth. Farmers in Britain used to give a sprig of mistletoe to the
first cow calving in the year. Forlong points out the recovery of old
heathen ideas; saying, "Christian priests forbade the mistletoe to enter
their churches, but yet it not only got in, but found a place over the
altars, and was held to betoken good will to all mankind." It was
mysteriously associated with the dove. The Irish called it the
*uil-iceach*: the Welsh *uchelwydd*. The *County Magazine* for 1792
remarked "A custom of kissing the women under the mistletoe-bush still
prevails in many places, and without doubt the sure way to prove
prolific." Pliny considered it good for sterility. It was the only thing
that could slay the gentle Baldur. In England there are some twenty
trees on which the mistletoe may grow.

Certain plants have at different times been objects special
consideration, and worshipped as having divine qualities, or being
possessed by a soul. Some were thought, to manifest sympathetic feeling
with the nation by which they were cherished. The fetish tree of
Coomassie fell

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

when Wolseley's ultimatum reached the King of Ashantee. The ruthless
cutting of trees was deemed cruel. Even if they had no living spirit of
their own, the souls of the dead might be there confined; but perhaps
Mr. Gladstone, the tree-feller, is no believer in that spiritual
doctrine.

In Germany one may still witness the marrying of trees on Christmas Eve
with straw-ropes, that they may yield well. Their forefathers' regard
for the *World-tree*, the ash Yggdrasill, may incline Germans to spare
trees, and raise them, as Bismarck loves to do. Women there, and
elsewhere, found consolation from moving round a sacred tree on the
approach of nature's trial. The oldest altars stood under trees, as by
sacred fountains or wells. But some had to be shunned as demoniac trees.

The Irish respected the *Cairthaim*, quicken-tree, quick-beam, rowan, or
mountain ash, which had magical qualities. In the story of the *Fairy
Palace of the Quicken-tree*, we read of Finn the Finian leader being
held in that tree by enchantment, as was Merlin by the fairy lady.
MacCuill, son of the hazel, one of the last Tuath kings, was so-called
because he worshipped the hazel. Fairies danced beneath the hawthorn.
Ogham tablets were of yew. Lady Wilde styled the elder a sacred tree;
and the blackthorn, to which the Irishman is said to be still devoted,
was a sacred tree.

Trees of Knowledge have been recognized east and west. That of India was
the *Kalpa*. The Celtic Tree of Life was not unlike that of Carthage.
The Persians, Assyrians, and American Indians had their Trees of Life.
One Egyptian holy tree had seven branches on each side. From the
Sycamore, the goddess Nou provided the liquor of life; from the Persea,
the goddess Hathor gave fruits of immortality. The Date-palm was sacred
to Osiris six thousand years ago. The Tree of Life was sometimes

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

depicted on coffins with human arms. The Lotus, essentially phallic,
self-produced, was an emblem of self-created deity, being worshipped as
such at least 3000 B.C. Homa was the Life-tree of Zoroaster. The bean
was thrown on tombs as a sign of immortality. The banyan and the onion
denote a new incarnation.

The Indian and Cingalese Bo or Asvattha, *Ficus religiosa*, sheltered
Gautama when he gained what is known as Entire Sanctification, or
Perfection. The sacred *Peepul* is the male fig, the female being *Ficus
Indica*. The fig entwines itself round the palm. The Toolsi, *Ocymum
Sanctum*, and the *Amrita* are also worshipped in India, so are the
*Lien-wha*, or Nelumbium, in China, the cypress in Mexico, and the aspen
in Kirghizland.

Trees and plants were devoted to gods as the oak, palm, and ash to
Jupiter, the rose, myrtle, and poppy to Venus; the pomegranate to
Proserpine; the pine-apple to Cybele; the orange to Diana, the white
violet to Vesta, the daisy to Alcestis; the wild thyme to the Muses; the
laurel to Apollo; the poplar to Hercules; the alder to Pan; the olive to
Minerva; the fig and vine to Bacchus; the lotus to Hermes. The leek of
Wales, like the shamrock of Ireland, was an object of worship in the
East, and as associated with Virgo. The *Hortus Kewensis* states that it
first came to Britain in 1562. The mandrake or Love-apple was also
sacred. Brinton gives a list of seven such sacred plants among the Creek
Indians. The Vervain, sacred to Druids, was gathered in Egypt at the
rise of Sirius the Dogstar.
