<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediate Effect of Christianity on Articles      of Popular Superstition -- Chaucer's Account of the Roman Catholic Priests      banishing the Fairies -- Bishop Corbett imputes the same Effect to the Reformation      -- His Verses on that Subject -- His Iter Septentrionale -- Robin Goodfellow      and other Superstitions mentioned by Reginald Scot -- Character of the English      Fairies -- The Tradition had become obsolete in that Author's Time -- That      of Witches remained in vigour -- But impugned by various Authors after the      Reformation, as Wierus, Naud&aelig;us, Scot, and others -- Demonology defended      by Bodinus, Remigius, &amp;c. -- Their mutual Abuse of each other -- Imperfection      of Physical Science at this Period, and the Predominance of Mysticism in that      Department. </blockquote> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALTHOUGH the influence of the Christian religion    was not introduced to the nations of Europe with such radiance as to dispel    at once those clouds of superstition which continued to obscure the understanding    of hasty and ill-instructed converts, there can be no doubt that its immediate    operation went to modify the erroneous and extravagant articles of credulity    which lingered behind the old pagan faith, and which gave way before it, in    proportion as its light became more pure and refined from the devices of men. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet Chaucer, indeed, pays the Church of    Rome, with its monks and preaching friars, the compliment of having, at an early    period, expelled from the land all spirits of an inferior and less holy character.    The verses are curious as well as picturesque, and may go some length to establish    the existence of doubts concerning the general belief in fairies among the well-instructed    in the time of Edward III. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fairies of whom the bard of Woodstock talks    are, it will be observed, the ancient Celtic breed, and he seems to  refer for the authorities of his tale to Bretagne,    or Armorica, genuine Celtic colony: --  <br> <br> "In old time of the King Artour, <br> Of which that Bretons speken great honour, <br> All was this land fulfilled of faerie; <br> The Elf queen, with her joly company, <br> Danced full oft in many a grene mead. <br> This was the old opinion, as I rede <br> I speake of many hundred years ago, <br> But now can no man see no elves mo. <br> For now the great charity and prayers <br> Of limitours,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">39</FONT></A> and other holy freres, <br> That searchen every land and every stream, <br> As thick as motes in the sunne-beam, <br> Blessing halls, chambers, kitchenes, and boures, <br> Cities and burghes, castles high and towers, <br> Thropes and barnes, sheep-pens and dairies, <br> This maketh that there ben no fairies. <br> For there as wont to walken was an elf, <br> There walketh now the limitour himself, <br> In under nichtes and in morwenings, <br> And saith his mattins; and his holy things, <br> As he goeth in his limitation. <br> Women may now go safely up and doun <br> In every bush, and under every tree, <br> There is no other incubus than he, <br> And he ne will don them no dishonour."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_39"></A><A HREF="#fn_39"><FONT SIZE="1">40</FONT></A>  <br> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we see the opinion which Chaucer has expressed    of the regular clergy of his time, in some of his other tales, we are tempted    to suspect some mixture of irony in the compliment which ascribes the exile    of the fairies, with which the land was "fulfilled" in King Arthur's time, to    the warmth and zeal of the devotion of the limitary friars. Individual instances    of scepticism there might exist among scholars, but a more modern poet, with    a vein of humour not unworthy of Geoffrey himself, has with greater probability    delayed the final banishment of the fairies from England, that is, from popular    faith, till the  reign of Queen Elizabeth, and has represented    their expulsion as a consequence of the change of religion. Two or three verses    of this lively satire may be very well worth the reader's notice, who must,    at the same time, be informed that the author, Dr. Corbett, was nothing less    than the Bishop of Oxford and Norwich in the beginning of the seventeenth century.    The poem is named "A proper new Ballad, entitled the Fairies' Farewell, to be    sung or whistle, to the tune of the Meadow Brow by the learned; by the unlearned    to the tune of Fortune:" --  <br> <br> Farewell, rewards and fairies, <br> Good housewives now may say, <br> For now foul slats in dairies <br> Do fare as well as they; <br> And though they sweep their hearths no less <br> Than maids were wont to do, <br> Yet who of late for cleanliness <br> Finds sixpence in her shoe? <br> <br> Lament, lament, old abbies, <br> The fairies' lost command; <br> They did but change priests' babies, <br> But some have changed your land <br> And all your children sprung from hence <br> Are now grown Puritans, <br> Who live as changelings ever since <br> For love of your domains. <br> <br> At morning and at evening both, <br> You merry were and glad, <br> So little care of sleep and sloth <br> Those pretty ladies had. <br> When Tom came home from labour, <br> Or Cis to milking rose, <br> Then merrily, merrily went their tabor, <br> And merrily went their toes. <br> <br> Witness those rings and roundelays <br> Of theirs, which yet remain, <br> Were footed, in Queen Mary's days, <br> On many a graspy plain; <br> But since of late Elizabeth, <br> And later James came in, <br> They never danced on any heath <br> As when the time hath bin. <br> <br> "By which we note, the fairies <br> Were of the old profession, <br> Their songs were Ave Maries, <br> Their dances were procession. <br> But now, alas ! they all are dead, <br> Or gone beyond the seas <br> Or farther for religion fled, <br> Or else they take their ease." <br> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining part of the poem is dedicated    to the praise d glory of old William Chourne of Staffordshire, who remained    a true and stanch evidence in behalf of the departed elves, and kept, much it    would seem to the amusement of the witty bishop, an inexhaustible record of    their pranks and feats, whence the concluding verse --  <br> <br> "To William all give audience, <br> And pray ye for his noddle, <br> For all the fairies' evidence <br> Were lost if that were addle."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_40"></A><A HREF="#fn_40"><FONT SIZE="1">41</FONT></A> <br> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This William Chourne appears to have attended    Dr. Corbett's party on the <i>iter septentrionale,</i> "two of which were, and    two desired to be, doctors;" but whether William was guide, friend, or domestic    seems uncertain. The travellers lose themselves in the mazes of Chorley Forest    on their way to Bosworth, and their route becomes so confused that they return    on their steps and labour --  <br> <br> As in a conjuror's circle -- William found <br> A mean for our deliverance, -- 'Turn your cloaks,' <br> Quoth he, 'for Puck is busy in these oaks; <br> If ever you at Bosworth would be found, <br> Then turn your cloaks, for this is fairy ground.' <br> But ere this witchcraft was performed, we meet <br> A very man who had no cloven feet. <br> Though William, still of little faith, has doubt, <br> 'Tis Robin, or some sprite that walks about. <br> 'Strike him,' quoth he, 'and it will turn to air -- <br> Cross yourselves thrice and strike it.' -- 'Strike that dare,' <br> Thought I, 'for sure this massy forester, <br> In strokes will prove the better conjuror.' <br> But 'twas a gentle keeper, one that knew <br> Humanity and manners, where they grew, <br> And rode along so far. tili he could say, <br> 'See, yonder Bosworth stands, and this your way."' &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_41"></A><A HREF="#fn_41"><FONT SIZE="1">42</FONT></A> <br> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this passage the bishop plainly shows the    fairies maintained their influence in William's imagination, since the courteous    keeper was mistaken by their associate champion for Puck or Robin Goodfellow.    The spells resorted to to get rid of his supposed delusions are alternative    that of turning the cloak -- (recommended in visions of the second-sight or    similar illusions as a means of obtaining a certainty concerning the being which    is before imperfectly seen &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_42"></A><A HREF="#fn_42"><FONT SIZE="1">43</FONT></A>)    -- and that of exorcising the spirit with a cudgel which last, Corbett prudently    thinks, ought not to be resorted to unless under an absolute conviction that    the exorcist is the stronger party. Chaucer, therefore, could not be serious    in averring that the fairy superstitions were obsolete in his day, since they    were found current three centuries afterwards. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not the less certain that, as knowledge    and religion became more widely and brightly displayed over any country, the    superstitious fancies of the people sunk gradually in esteem and influence ;    and in the time of Queen Elizabeth the unceasing labour of many and popular    preachers, who declaimed against the "splendid miracles" of the Church of Rome,    produced also its natural effect upon the other stock of superstitions. "Certainly,"    said Reginald Scot, talking of times before his own, "some one  knave in a white sheet hath cozened and abused    many thousands, specially when Robin Goodfellow kept such a coil in the country.    In our childhood our mothers' maids have so terrified us with an ugly devil    having horns on his head, fire in his mouth, and a tail at his breech ; eyes    like a basin, fangs like a dog, claws like a bear, a skin like a negro, and    a voice roaring like a lion, whereby we start and are afraid when we hear one    cry, Boh ! and they have so frayd us with bull-beggars, spirits, witches, urchins,    elves, hags, fairies, satyrs, Pans, faunes, sylvans, Kitt-with-the-candlestick,    tritons, centaurs, dwarfs, giants, imps, calcars, conjurers, nymphs, changelings,    incubus, Robin Goodfellow, the spoorn, the man-in-the-oak, the hellwain, the    fire-drake, the puckle, Tom Thumb, Hobgoblin, Tom Tumbler, Boneless, and such    other bugbears, that we are afraid of our own shadows, insomuch that some never    fear the devil but on a dark night ; and then a polled sheep is a perilous beast,    and many times is taken for our father's soul, specially in a churchyard, where    a right hardy man heretofore durst not to have passed by night but his hair    would stand upright. Well, thanks be to God, this wretched and cowardly infidelity,    since the preaching of the Gospel, is in part forgotten, and doubtless the rest    of these illusions will in a short time, by God's grace, be detected and vanish    away."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_43"></A><A HREF="#fn_43"><FONT SIZE="1">44</FONT></A> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It would require a better demonologist than    I am to explain the various obsolete superstitions which Reginald Scot has introduced    as articles of the old English faith, into the preceding passage. I might indeed    say the Phuca is a Celtic superstition, from which the word Pook or Puckle was    doubtless derived; and I might conjecture that the man-in-the-oak was the same    with the Erl-K&ouml;nig of the Germans; and that the hellwain were a kind of    wandering spirits, the descendants of a champion named Hellequin, who are introduced    into the romance of Richard sans Peur. But   most antiquaries will be at fault concerning    the spoorn, Kitt-with-the-candlestick, Boneless, and some others. The catalogue,    however, serves to show what progress the English have made in two centuries,    in forgetting the very names of objects which had been the sources of terror    to their ancestors of the Elizabethan age. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before leaving the subject of fairy superstition    in England we may remark that it was of a more playful and gentle, less wild    and necromantic character, than that received among the sister people. The amusements    of the southern, fairies were light and sportive; their resentments were satisfied    with pinching or scratching the objects of their displeasure ; their peculiar    sense of cleanliness rewarded the housewives with the silver token in the shoe;    their nicety was extreme concerning any coarseness or negligence which could    offend their delicacy; and I cannot discern, except, perhaps, from the insinuations    of some scrupulous divines, that they were vassals to or in close alliance with    the infernals, as there is too much reason to believe was the case with their    North British sisterhood.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_44"></A><A HREF="#fn_44"><FONT SIZE="1">45</FONT></A> The common nursery story cannot    be forgotten, how, shortly after the death of what is called a nice tidy housewife,    the Elfin band was shocked to see that a person of different character, with    whom the widower had filled his deserted arms, instead of the nicely arranged    little loaf of the whitest bread, and a basin of sweet cream, duly placed for    their refreshment by the deceased, had substituted a brown loaf and a cobb of    herrings. Incensed at such a coarse regale, the elves dragged the peccant housewife    out of bed, and pulled her down the wooden stairs by the heels, repeating, at    the same time, in scorn of her churlish hospitality --   But beyond such playful malice they had no desire    to extend their resentment. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The constant attendant upon the English Fairy    court was the celebrated Puck, or Robin Goodfellow, who to the elves acted in    some measure as the jester or clown of the company -- (a character then to be    found in the establishment of every person of quality) -- or to use a more modern    comparison, resembled the Pierrot of the pantomime. His jests were of the most    simple and at the same time the broadest comic character -- to mislead a clown    on his path homeward, to disguise himself like a stool, in order to induce an    old gossip to commit the egregious mistake of sitting down on the floor when    she expected to repose on a chair, were his special enjoyments. If he condescended    to do some work for the sleeping family, in which he had some resemblance to    the Scottish household spirit called a Brownie, the selfish Puck was far from    practising this labour on the disinterested principle of the northern goblin,    who, if raiment or food was left in his way and for his use, departed from the    family in displeasure. Robin Goodfellow, on the contrary, must have both his    food and his rest, as Milton informs us, amid his other notices of country superstitions,    in the poem of L'Allegro. And it is to be noticed that he represents these    tales of the fairies, told round the cottage hearth, as of a cheerful rather    than a serious cast ; which illustrates what I have said concerning the milder    character of the southern superstitions, as compared with those of the same    class in Scotland -- the stories of which are for the most part of a frightful    and not seldom of a disgusting quality. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Robin, however, between whom and King Oberon    Shakespeare contrives to keep a degree of distinct subordination, which for    a moment deceives us by its appearance of reality, notwithstanding his turn    for wit and humour, had been obscured by oblivion even in the days of Queen    Bess.  We have already seen, in a passage quoted from    Reginald Scot, that the belief was fallen into abeyance; that which follows    from the same author affirms more positively that Robin's date was over: --   
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Know ye this, by the way, that heretofore Robin    Goodfellow and Hobgoblin were as terrible, and also as credible, to the people    as hags and witches be now ; and in time to come a witch will be as much derided    and condemned, and as clearly perceived, as the illusion and knavery of Robin    Goodfellow, upon whom there have gone as many and as credible tales as witchcraft,    saving that it hath not pleased the translators of tile Bible to call spirits    by the name of Robin Goodfellow, as they have diviners, soothsayers, poisoners,    and cozeners by the name of witches."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_45"></A><A HREF="#fn_45"><FONT SIZE="1">46</FONT></A> In the same tone Reginald    Scot addresses the reader in the preface: -- "To make a solemn suit to you that    are partial readers to set aside partiality, to take in good part my writings,    and with indifferent eyes to look upon my book, were labour lost and time ill-employed;    for I should no more prevail herein than if, a hundred years since, I should    have entreated your predecessors to believe that Robin Goodfellow, that great    and ancient bull-beggar, had been but a cozening, merchant, and no devil indeed.    But Robin Goodfellow ceaseth now to be much feared, and Popery is sufficiently    discovered; nevertheless, witches' charms and conjurers' cozenage are yet effectual."    This passage seems clearly to prove that the belief in Robin Goodfellow and    his fairy companions was now out of date; while that as to witchcraft, as was    afterwards but too well shown, kept its ground against argument and controversy,    and survived "to shed more blood." 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are then to take leave of this fascinating    article of the popular creed, having in it so much of interest to the imagination    that we almost envy the credulity of those who, in the gentle moonlight of a    summer night in England, amid  the tangled glades of a deep forest, or the turfy    swell of her romantic commons, could fancy they saw the fairies tracing their    sportive ring. But it is in vain to regret illusions which, however engaging,    must of necessity yield their place before the increase of knowledge, like shadows    at the advance of morn. These superstitions have already survived their best    and most useful purpose, having been embalmed in the poetry of Milton and of    Shakespeare, as I well as writers only inferior to these great names. Of Spenser    we must say nothing, because in his "Faery Queen" the title is the only circumstance    which connects his splendid allegory with the popular superstition, and, as    he uses it, means nothing more than an Utopia or nameless country. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the fairy popular creed fell, doubtless,    many subordinate articles of credulity in England, but the belief in witches    kept its ground. It was rooted in the minds of the common people, as well by    the easy solution it afforded of much which they found otherwise bard to explain,    as in reverence to the Holy Scriptures, in which the word <i>witch</i>, being    used in several places, conveyed to those who did not trouble themselves about    the nicety of the translation from the Eastern tongues, the inference that the    same species of witches were meant as those against whom modern legislation    had, in most European nations, directed the 'punishment of death. These two    circumstances furnished the numerous believers in witchcraft with arguments    in divinity and law which they conceived irrefragable. They might say to the    theologist, Will you not believe in witches? the Scriptures aver their existence;    -- to the jurisconsult, Will you dispute the existence of a crime against which    our own statute-book, and the code of almost all civilized countries, have attested,    by laws upon which hundreds and thousands have been convicted, many or even    most of whom have, by their judicial confessions, acknowledged their guilt and    the justice of their punishment?  It is a strange scepticism, they might add, which    rejects the evidence of Scripture, of human legislature, and of the accused    persons themselves. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding these specious reasons, the    sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were periods when the revival o learning,    the invention of printing, the fearless investigations of the Reformers into    subjects thought formerly too sacred for consideration of any save the clergy,    had introduced a system of doubt, enquiry, disregard of authority, when unsupported    by argument, and unhesitating exercise of the private judgment, on subjects    which had occupied the bulls of popes and decrees of councils. In short, the    spirit of the age was little disposed to spare error, however venerable, or    countenance imposture, however sanctioned by length of time and universal acquiescence.    Learned writers arose in different countries to challenge the very existence    of this imaginary crime, to rescue the reputation of the great men whose knowledge,    superior to that of their age, had caused them to be suspected of magic, and    to put a stop to the horrid superstition whose victims were the aged, ignorant,    and defenceless, and which could only be compared to that which sent victims    of old through the fire to Moloch. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The courageous interposition of those philosophers    who opposed science and experience to the prejudices of superstition and ignorance,    and in doing so incurred much mis-representation, and perhaps no little ill-will,    in the cause of truth and humanity, claim for them some distinction in a work    on Demonology. The pursuers of exact science to its coy retreats, were sure    to be the first to discover that the most remarkable phenomena in Nature are    regulated by certain fixed laws, and cannot rationally be referred to supernatural    agency, the sufficing cause to which superstition attributes all that is beyond    her own narrow power of explanation. Each advance in natural knowledge teaches    us that it is the pleasure of 'the Creator to govern the world  by the laws which he has imposed, and which are    not in our times interrupted or suspended. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The learned Wier, or Wierus, was a man of great    research in physical science, and studied under the celebrated Cornelius Agrippa,    against whom the charge of sorcery was repeatedly alleged by Paulus Jovius and    other authors, while he suffered, on the other hand, from the persecution of    the inquisitors of the Church, whose accusation against this celebrated man    was, that he denied the existence of spirits, a charge very inconsistent with    that of sorcery, which consists in corresponding with them. Wierus, after taking    his degree as a doctor of medicine, became physician to the Duke of Cleves,    at whose court he practised for thirty years with the highest reputation. This    learned man, disregarding the scandal which, by so doing, he was likely to bring    upon himself, was one of the first who attacked the vulgar belief, and boldly    assailed, both by serious arguments and by ridicule, the vulgar credulity on    the subject of wizards and witches. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gabriel Naud&eacute;, or Naud&aelig;us, as he    termed himself, was a perfect scholar and man of letters, busied during his    whole life with assembling books together, and enjoying the office of librarian    to several persons of high rank, amongst others, to Queen Christina of Sweden.    He was, besides, a beneficed clergyman, leading a most unblemished life, and    so temperate as never to taste any liquor stronger than water; yet did he not    escape the scandal which is usually flung by their prejudiced contemporaries    upon those disputants whom it is found. more easy to defame than to answer.    He wrote an interesting work, entitled "Apologie pour les Grands Hommes Accus&eacute;s    de Magie;" and as he exhibited a good deal of vivacity of talent, and an earnestness    in pleading his cause, which did not always spare some of the superstitions    of Rome herself, he was charged by his contemporaries as guilty of heresy and    scepticism, when justice could only accuse him of an incautious eagerness to    make good his argument.   Among persons who, upon this subject, purged    their eye with rue and euphrasie, besides the Rev. Dr. Harsnet and many others    (who wrote rather on special cases of Demonology than on the general question),    Reginald Scot ought to be distinguished. Webster assures us that he was a "person    of competent learning, pious, and of a good family." He seems to have been a    zealous Protestant, and much his book, as well as that of Harsnet, is designed    to throw upon the Papists in particular those tricks in which, by confederacy    and imposture, the popular ideas concerning witchcraft, possession, and other    supernatural fancies, were maintained and kept in exercise; but he also writes    on the general question with some force and talent, considering that his subject    is incapable of being reduced into a regular form, and is of a nature particularly    seductive to an excursive tale He appears to have studied legerdemain for the    purpose of showing how much that is apparently unaccountable can nevertheless    be performed without the intervention of supernatural assistance, even when    it is impossible to persuade the vulgar that the devil has not been consulted    on the occasion. Scot also had intercourse with some of the celebrated fortune-tellers,    or Philomaths, of the time ; one of whom he brings forward to declare the vanity    of the science which he himself had once professed. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To defend the popular belief of witchcraft there    arose a number of advocates, of whom Bodin and some others neither wanted knowledge    nor powers of reasoning. They pressed the incredulous party with the charge    that they denied the existence of a crime against which the haw had denounced    a capital punishment. As that law was under he stood to emanate from James himself,    who Was reigning monarch during the hottest part of the controversy, the English    authors who defended the opposite side were obliged to entrench themselves under    an evasion, to avoid maintaining an argument unpalatable to a degree to those    in power, and which might perchance have proved unsafe to  those who used it. With a certain degree of sophistry    they answered that they did not doubt the possibility of witches, but only demurred    to what is their nature, and how they me to be such -- according to the scholastic    jargon, that e question in respect to witches was not <i>de existentia, </i>but    only<i> de modo existendi.</i> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By resorting to so subtle an argument those    who impugned the popular belief were obliged, with some inconsistency, to grant    that witchcraft had existed, and might exist, only insisting that it was a species    of witchcraft consisting of they knew not what, but certainly of something different    from that which legislators, judges, and juries had hitherto considered the    statute as designed to repress. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime (the rather that the debate    was on a subject particularly difficult of comprehension) the debating parties    grew warm, and began to call names. Bodin, a lively Frenchman of an irritable    habit, explained the zeal of Wierus to protect the tribe of sorcerers from punishment,    by stating that he himself was a conjurer and the scholar of Cornelius Agrippa,    and might therefore well desire to the lives of those accused of the same, league    with an. Hence they threw on their antagonists the offensive names of witch-patrons    and witch-advocates, as if it were impossible for any to hold the opinion of    Naud&aelig;us, Wierus, Scot, &amp;c., without patronizing the devil and the    witches against their brethren of mortality. Assailed by such heavy charges,    the philosophers themselves lost patience, and retorted abuse in their turn,    calling Bodin, Delrio, and others who used their arguments, witch-advocates,    and the like, as the affirming and defending the existence of the rime seemed    to increase the number of witches, and assuredly augmented the list of executions.    But for a certain time the preponderance of the argument lay on the side of    the Demonologists, and we may briefly observe the causes which gave their opinions,    for a period, greater influence than their opponents on the public mind.   It is first to be observed that Wierus, for    what reason cannot well be conjectured, except to show the extent of his cabalistical    knowledge, had introduced into his work against witchcraft the whole Stenographia    of Trithemius, which he had copied from the original in the library of Cornelius    Agrippa; and which, suspicious from the place where found it, and from the long    catalogue of fiends which it contained, with the charms for raising and for    binding to the service of mortals, was considered by Bodin as containing proof    that Wierus himself was a sorcerer; not one the wisest, certainly, since he    thus unnecessarily placed the disposal of any who might buy the book the whole    secrets which formed his stock-in-trade. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, we may notice that, from the state    of physic science at the period when Van Helmont, Paracelsus, an others began    to penetrate into its recesses it was an unknown, obscure, and ill-defined region,    and did not permit those who laboured in it to give that precise and accurate    account of their discoveries which the progress of reason experimentally and    from analysis has enabled the late discoverers to do with success. Natural magic    -- a phrase use to express those phenomena which could be produced knowledge    of the properties of matter -- had so much in it that was apparently uncombined    and uncertain, that the art of chemistry was accounted mystical, and an opinion    prevailed that the results now known to be the consequence their various laws    of matter, could not be traced through combinations even by those who knew the    effects them selves. Physical science, in a word, was cumbered by a number of    fanciful and incorrect opinions, chiefly of a mystical character. If, for instance,    it was observed that a flag and a fern never grew near each other, the circumstance,    was imputed to some antipathy between these vegetables nor was it for some time    resolved by the natural rule, that the flag has its nourishment in marshy ground,    whereas the fern loves a deep dryish soil. The attributes of the divining-rod  were fully credited; the discovery of the philosopher's    stone was daily hoped for; and electricity, magnetism, and their remarkable    and misconceived phenomena were appealed to as proof of the reasonableness of    their expectations. until such phenomena were traced to their sources, imaginary    often mystical causes were assigned to them, for the same reason that, in the    wilds of a partially discovered country, according to the satirist, <br> <br> "Geographers on pathless downs <br> Place elephants for want of towns." <br> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This substitution of mystical fancies for experimental    reasoning gave, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, a doubtful and twilight    appearance to the various branches physical philosophy. The learned and sensible    Dr.Webster, for instance, writing in detection of supposed witchcraft, assumes,    as a string of undeniable facts, opinions which our more experienced age would    reject as frivolous fancies; "for example, the effects of healing by the weapon-salve,    the sympathetic powder, the curing of various diseases by apprehensions, amulets,    or by transplantation." All of which undoubted wonders he accuses the age of    desiring to throw on the devil's back -- an unnecessary load certainly, since    such things do not exist, and it is therefore in vain to seek to account for    them. It followed that, while the opposers of the ordinary theory might have    struck the 'deepest blows at the witch hypothesis by an appeal to common sense,    they were themselves hampered by articles of philosophical belief which they    must have been sensible contained nearly as deep draughts upon human credulity    as were made by the Demonologists, against whose doctrine they protested. This    error had a doubly bad effect, both as degrading the immediate department in    which it occurred, and as affording a protection for falsehood in other branches    of science. The champions who, in their own province, were obliged by the imperfect    knowledge of the times to admit much that was mystical and inexplicable -- those    who  opined, with Bacon, that warts could be cured    by sympathy -- who thought, with Napier, that hidden treasures could be discovered    by the mathematics -- who salved the weapon instead of the wound, and detected    murders as well a springs of water by the divining-rod, could not consistently    use, to confute the believers in witches, an argument turning on the impossible    or the incredible. 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such were the obstacles arising from the vanity    of philosophers and the imperfection of their science, which suspended the strength    of their appeal to reason and common sense against the condemning of wretches    to a cruel death on account of crimes which the nature of things rendered in    modern times totally impossible We cannot doubt that they suffered considerably    in the contest, which was carried on with much anger and malevolence; but the    good seed which they had sown remained uncorrupted in the soil, to bear fruit    so soon as the circumstances should be altered which at first impeded its growth.    In the next letter I shall take a view of the causes which helped to remove    these impediments, in addition, it must always be remembered, to the general    increase of knowledge and improvement of experimental philosophy. <br> <br>
