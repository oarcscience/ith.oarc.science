# CHAPTER IX

### Tana and Endamone, or Diana and Endymion

"Hic ultra Endymionem indormit negligentiæ."

"Now it is fabled that Endymion, admitted to Olympus, whence he was
expelled for want of respect to Juno, was banished for thirty years to
earth. And having been allowed to sleep this time in a cave of Mount
Latmos, *Diana*, smitten with his beauty, visited him every night till
she had by him fifty daughters and one son. And after this Endymion was
recalled to Olympus."

--*Diz. Stor. Mitol.*                

The following legend and the spells were given under the name or title
of Tana. This was the old Etruscan name for *Diana*, which is still
preserved in the Romagna Toscana. In more than one Italian and French
work I have found some account or tale how a witch charmed a girl to
sleep for a lover, but this is the only explanation of the whole
ceremony known to me.

Tana.

Tana is a beautiful goddess, and she loved a marvelously handsome youth
named Endamone; but her love was crossed by a witch who was her rival,
although Endamone did not care for the latter.

But the witch resolved to win him, whether he

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

would or not, and with this intent she induced the servant of Endamone
to let her pass the night in the latter's room. And when there, she
assumed the appearance of Tana, whom he loved, so that he was delighted
to behold her, as he thought, and welcomed her with passionate embraces.
Yet this gave him into her power, for it enabled her to perform a
certain magic spell by clipping a lock of his hair. <span
id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17)

Then she went home, and taking a piece of sheep's intestine, formed of
it a purse, and in this she put that which she had taken, with a red and
a black ribbon bound together, with a feather, and pepper and salt, and
then sang a song. These were the words, a song of witchcraft of the very
old time.

Scongiurazione.

Ho formato questo sachetto a Endamone,  
E la mia vendetta per l'amore,  
Ch'io ti portavo, e non ero corrisposta,  
Una altra tu l'amavi:  
La bella dea Tana tu amavi,  
E tu non l'avrai: di passione  
Ti struggerai, volonta di fare,  
Di fare al amore tu avrai,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> E non la potrai
fare. Sempre addormentato resterai,  
Di un sonno che tutto sentirai,  
E la tua bella tu vedrai,  
Ma parlare non potrai  
Nel vedere la tua bella,  
Volontà di fare al amore  
Verra e non la potrai fare  
Come una candela ti struggera,  
Ti struggerai poco a poco,  
Come una candele a fuoco,  
Tu non potrai vivère  
Tu non potrai stare,  
Ti sentirai mancare,  
Che il tuo cuore ritto sempre possa stare  
E al amore più non potrai fare  
Per l'amore che io te ho portata vo,  
Sia convertito intanto odio  
Che questo Endamone e la mia vendetta,  
E cosi sono contenta.

The Spell.

This bag for Endamon' I wove,  
It is my vengeance for the love,  
For the deep love I had for thee,  
Which thou would'st not return to me,  
But bore it all to Tana's shrine.,  
And Tana never shall be thine!  
Now every night in agony  
By me thou shalt oppressed be! <span id="page_54">p. 54</span>  
From day to day, from hour to hour,  
I'll make thee feel the witch's power,  
With passion thou shalt be tormented,  
And yet with pleasure ne'er contented;  
Enwrapped in slumber thou shalt lie,  
To know that thy beloved is by,  
And, ever dying, never die,  
Without the power to speak a word,  
Nor shall her voice by thee be heard;  
Tormented by Love's agony,  
There shall be no relief for thee!  
For my strong spell thou canst not break,  
And from that sleep thou ne'er shalt wake:  
Little by little thou shalt waste,  
Like taper by the embers placed.  
Little by little thou shalt die,  
Yet, ever living, tortured lie,  
Strong in desire, yet ever weak,  
Without the power to move or speak,  
With all the love I had for thee  
Shalt thou thyself tormented be,  
Since all the love I felt of late  
I'll make thee feel in burning hate,  
For ever on thy torture bent,  
I am revenged, and now content.

But Tana, who was far more powerful than the witch, though not able to
break the spell by which he was compelled to sleep, took from him all
pain (he knew her in dreams), and embracing him, she sang this
counter-charm.

The Song of Diana.

Endamone, Endamone, Endamone!  
Per l'amore chi mi porti e che io pure,  
Ti porto tre croci su questo letto!  
Vengo a fare, e tre marroni d'India,  
Nel tuo letto vengo a posare,  
E questa finestra aperta che la Luna,  
Su il tuo letto risplende,  
Come risplende il nostro amore  
La, e la prego con gran calore,  
Che voglia dare sfogo a queste due cuore,  
Che tanto ci amiamo, e se questa grazia,  
Mi verrà fatta chiunque sia innamorata,  
Se mi scongiurera  
In suo aiuto correro!

Endamone, Endamone, Endamone!  
Sopra te io mi metto al lume,  
Il tuo (cuore) io dimeno,  
E mi dimeno io pure e cosi,  
E cosi tanto farò,  
Tanto farò e tanto faremmo,  
Che uniti ne veremmo.

The Counter-Charm.

Endamone, Endamone, Endamone!  
By the love I feel, which I  
Shall ever feel until I die, <span id="page_56">p. 56</span>  
Three crosses on thy bed I make,  
And then three wild horse-chestnuts take; <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18)  
In that bed the nuts I hide,  
And then the window open wide,  
That the full moon may cast her light  
Upon a love as fair and bright,  
And so I pray to her above  
To give wild rapture to our love,  
And cast her fire in either heart,  
Which wildly loves to never part;  
And one thing more I beg of thee!  
If any one enamoured be,  
And in my aid his love hath placed,  
Unto his call I'll come in haste.

So it came to pass that the fair goddess made love with Endamone as if
they had been awake (yet communing in dreams). And so it is to this day,
that who ever would make love with him or her who sleeps, should have
recourse to the beautiful *Tana*, and so doing there will be success.

This legend, while agreeing in many details with the classical myth, is
strangely intermingled with practices of witchcraft, but even these, if
investigated, would all prove to be as ancient as the rest of the text.
Thus the sheep's intestine used instead of the red woollen bag which is
employed in beneficent magic-the red and black

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

ribbon, which mingles threads of joy and woe--the (peacock's) feather or
*la penna maligna*--pepper and salt, occur in many other incantations,
but always to bring evil and cause suffering. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19)

I have never seen it observed, but it is true, that Keats in his
exquisite poem of *Endymion* completely departs from or ignores the
whole spirit and meaning of the ancient myth, while in this rude
witch-song it is minutely developed. The conception is that of a
beautiful youth furtively kissed in his slumber by *Dian* of reputed
chastity. The ancient myth is, to begin with, one of darkness and light,
or day and night, from which are born the fifty-one (now fifty-two)
weeks of the year. This is Diana, the night, and Apollo, the sun, or
light in another form. It is expressed as love-making during sleep,
which, when it occurs in real life, generally has for active agent some
one who, without being absolutely modest, wishes to preserve
appearances. The established character of *Diana* among the Initiated
(for which she was bitterly reviled by the Fathers of the Church) was
that of a beautiful hypocrite who pursued amours in silent secrecy.

"Thus as the moon Endymion lay with her,  
So did Hippolytus and Verbio."

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

(On which the reader may consult Tertullian, *De Falsa Religione*, lib.
ii. cap. 17, and Pico de Mirandula, *La Strega*.)

But there is an exquisitely subtle, delicately strange idea or ideal in
the conception of the apparently chaste "clear cold moon" casting her
living light by stealth into the hidden recesses of darkness and acting
in the occult mysteries of love or dreams. So it struck Byron <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20) as an original thought that the sun does
not shine on half the forbidden deeds which the moon witnesses, and this
is emphasised in the Italian witch-poem. In it the moon is distinctly
invoked as the protectress of a strange and secret amour, and as the
deity to be especially invoked for such love-making. The one invoking
says that the window is opened, that the moon may shine splendidly on
the bed, even as our love is bright and beautiful... and I pray her to
give great rapture--*sfogo*--to us.

The quivering, mysteriously beautiful light of the moon, which seems to
cast a spirit of intelligence or emotion over silent Nature, and dimly

half awaken it--raising shadows into thoughts and causing every tree and
rock to assume the semblance of a living form, but one which, while
shimmering and breathing, still sleeps in a dream--could not escape the
Greeks, and they expressed it as Diana embracing Endymion. But as night
is the time sacred to secrecy, and as the true Diana of the Mysteries
was the Queen of Night, who wore the crescent moon, and mistress of all
hidden things, including "sweet secret sins and loved iniquities," there
was attached to this myth far more than meets the eye. And Just in the
degree to which Diana was believed to be Queen of the emancipated
witches and of Night, or the nocturnal Venus-Astarte herself, so far
would the love for the sleeping Endymion be understood as sensual, yet
sacred and allegorical. and it is entirely in this sense that the
witches in Italy, who, may claim with some right to be its true
inheritors, have preserved and understood the myth.

It is a *realisation* of forbidden or secret love, with attraction to
the dimly seen beautiful--by moonlight, with the fairy or witch-like
charm of the supernatural--a *romance* all combined in a single strange
form--the spell of Night!

"There is a dangerous silence in that hour,  
A stillness which leaves room for the full soul  
To open all itself, without the power <span id="page_59">p. 59</span>  
Of calling wholly back its self-control;  
The silver light which, hallowing tree and tower,  
Sheds beauty and deep softness o'er the whole,  
Breathes also to the heart, and o'er it throws  
A loving languor which is not repose."

This is what is meant by the myth of Diana and Endymion. It is the
making divine or æsthetic (which to the Greeks was one and the same)
that which is impassioned, secret, and forbidden. It was the charm of
the stolen waters which are sweet, intensified to poetry. And it is
remarkable that it has been so strangely preserved in Italian witch
traditions.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_17"></span>[52:1](ara11.htm#fr_17) According to all evil
witchcraft in the world--especially among the black Voodoos--any
individual can be injured or killed if the magician can obtain any
portion of the person, however small, especially a lock of hair. This is
specially described in *Thiodolf the Islander*, a romance by La Motte
Fouqué. The exchange of locks by lovers is possibly connected with
magic.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[56:1](ara11.htm#fr_18) *Marroni d' India*. A
strong charm against evil, hence frequently carried against rheumatism,
&c. The three should come from one shell.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[57:1](ara11.htm#fr_19) The reader will find
them described in my *Etrusco-Roman Remains*.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[58:1](ara11.htm#fr_20) "The sun set and uprose
the yellow moon:  
The devil's in the moon for mischief; they  
Who called her chaste, methinks, began too soon  
Their nomenclature; there is not a day  
The longest, not the twenty-first of June,  
Sees half the business in a wicked way  
On which three single hours of moonshine smile."
