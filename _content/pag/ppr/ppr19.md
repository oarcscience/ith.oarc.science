### THE SALUTATION OF THE DAWN

(*Hindu*)

LISTEN to the exhortation of the Dawn!  
Look to this Day! For it is Life, The very Life of Life.  
In its brief course lie all the Varieties And Realities of your
Existence;  
  The Bliss of Growth,  
  The Glory of Action,  
  The Splendor of Beauty;  
For Yesterday is but a Dream,  
And To-morrow is only a Vision;  
But To-day well lived  
Makes every Yesterday a Dream of Happiness,  
And every To-morrow a Vision of Hope.  
Look well therefore to this Day!  
Such is the Salutation of the Dawn.
