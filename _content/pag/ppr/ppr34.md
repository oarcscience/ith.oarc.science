### AN INCA'S DEATH PRAYER

(*Peruvian*)

O CREATOR of men  
Thy servant speaks.  
Then look on him  
The king of Cusco.

Do not forget me  
O thou noble creator.  
O thou of my dreams.  
Dost thou forget  
And I on the point of death?  
Wilt thou ignore my prayer  
Or wilt thou make known  
Who thou art?  
Thou mayest be what I thought,  
Yet perchance thou art a phantom,  
A thing that causes fear.  
Oh, if I might know!  
Oh, if it could be revealed!  
Thou who made me out of earth,  
And of clay formed me.  
Oh look upon me!  
Who art thou, O Creator?  
Now I am very old.
