### PRAYER TO THE MEXICAN GOD OF FIRE

(*Mexican*)

(A victim is sacrificed for rain in the temple of the Earth Fire--a
crater of a volcano)

*Victim*

"TN THE Hall of Flame let me not put to shame my ancestors;
[descending](errata.htm#2) there let me not put you to shame!

"I fasten a rope to the sacred tree. I twist it in eight folds, that by
it, I, a magician, may descend to the magical house."

*Priests*

"Begin your song in the Hall of Flames! Begin your song in the Hall of
Flames!"

*Devotees*

"Why does not the magician come forth?

Why does he not rise up?"

*Priests*

"Let his subjects assist in the Hall of Flames!

He appears! He appears! Let his subjects assist!"

"Let his servants never cease the song of the Hall of Flames--let them
rejoice greatly--let them dance wonderfully!

(To the victim)

Call ye for the Woman with Abundant Hair, whose care is the Mist and the
Rain; call ye for Her!"
