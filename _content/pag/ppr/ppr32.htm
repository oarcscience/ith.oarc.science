</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">INVOCATION TO ORMAZD</h3>  
<p align="center">(<i>Persian</i>)</p>  
<p>IN THE name of God, the giver, forgiver, rich in love, praise be to the name of Ormazd, the God with the name who always was, always is, and always will be; the heavenly among the heavenly, with the name--"From whom alone is derived rule."</p>  
<p>With all strength bring I thanks.</p>  
<p>All good do I accept at thy command O God, and think, and speak, and do it. I believe in the pure law; by every good work seek I forgiveness for all sins. I keep pure the six powers--thought, speech, work, memory, mind and understanding. According to thy will am I able to accomplish. O accomplisher of good, thy honor, with good thoughts, good works.</p>  
<p>I enter on the shining way to Paradise; may the fearful terror of hell not overcome me! May I step over the bridge Chinevat. May I attain Paradise with much perfume, and all brightness.</p>  
<p>Praise be to the Overseer, the Lord, who rewards those who accomplish good deeds according to his own wish, and at last purifies even the wicked ones of hell.</p>
