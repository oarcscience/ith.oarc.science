Marah Ellis Ryan was a popular author, actress, and activist for Native
American rights at the turn of the 19th century. She wrote about twenty
books between 1889 and 1924, primarily sentimental novels. Her books are
today very much out of style; none of them has been reprinted in over
forty years.

By Pagan, Ryan means 'non-Christian'. Although the focus of this
collection is Native American traditions, it also includes Ancient Near
Eastern, Muslim, Hindu and other prayers. Ryan unknowingly anticipated
the tendency of neo-Paganism to accumulate rituals and liturgy from a
wide range of traditions. Many of the source books for Pagan Prayers are
at this site, e.g. [Rig Veda Americanus](../../nam/aztec/rva/index) and
[Rites and Laws of the Yncas](../../nam/inca/rly/index).

I'm still not sure about the details of Ryan's life or personal beliefs;
attempts to research her on the Internet didn't turn up much, for once.
Any information about her would be greatly appreciated.
