<p align="center">(<i>Mexican</i>)</p>  
<p align="center"><FONT SIZE="-1">(Cihua-coatl, mythic, mother of earth-born people)</FONT></p>  
<p>SERPENT Woman, plumed with eagle feathers, with the crest of eagles, comes, beating her drum, from the Place of the Old.</p>  
<p>She alone, who is our flesh, goddess of the fields and shrubs, is strong to support us.</p>  
<p>Our mother is as twelve eagles, goddess of drums calling the gods, filling the fields.</p>  
<p>She is our mother--a goddess of war, our mother, a companion from the Home of Ancestors.</p>  
<p>She comes forth, she appears when war is waged, she protects us in war that we be not destroyed--an example and companion from the Home of the Ancestors.</p>  
<p>She comes adorned in the ancient manner with the eagle's crest,--in the ancient manner with the eagle's crest!</p>
