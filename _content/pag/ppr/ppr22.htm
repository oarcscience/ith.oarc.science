</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PRAYER OF THE GAMBLER</h3>  
<p align="center">(<i>Hindu</i>)</p>  
<p>THESE dice that have grown in the air on the great Vibhidaka tree, drive me wild when they roll on the board! This Vibhidaka seems to me intoxicating like a draught of Soma that has grown on Mount Mugovat.</p>  
<p>When I think that I shall not play with them again, then am I left by my friends who go afar. But when the brown dice are thrown down and utter speech, then I rush to their rendezvous, like a love-sick maid.</p>  
<p>These dice hook, prick, undo, burn and inflame. After the gift of childish playthings they ruin the winner; yet to the gambler they are covered with honey.</p>  
<p>They do not bend before the anger of the mighty, even the king bends down before them.</p>  
<p>Though having no hands, they resist him who has hands. These playing coals, though cold, when thrown on the board, burn the heart through and through!</p>  
<p>Make other friends, O dice--have mercy on us! Do not bewitch us with powerful enchantment! May your wrath abate, and your enmity--let some one else be held in the power of the brown dice!</p>
