### BABYLONIAN PRAYER FOR HEALTH

(*Exorcism of Spirits of Disease*)

*Tablet I*

THE noxious god, the noxious spirit of the neck, the neck-spirit of the
desert, the neck-spirit of the mountains, the neck-spirit of the sea,
the neck-spirit of the morass, the noxious spirit of the city, this
noxious wind which seizes the body and the health of the body.

Spirit of Heaven, remember! Spirit of Earth, remember!

*Tablet V*

He who makes an image which injures the man, an evil face, an evil eye,
an evil mouth, an evil tongue, evil lips, an evil poison.

Spirit of Heaven, remember! Spirit of Earth, remember!

*Tablet VI*

The cruel spirit, the strong spirit of the head, the head-spirit that
departs not, the head-spirit that goes not forth, the head-spirit that
will not go, the noxious head spirit.

Spirit of Heaven, remember! Spirit of Earth, remember!

*Tablet VIII*

May Nin-cigal, the wife of Nin-a’su, turn her face toward an-other
place; may the noxious spirit go forth and seize another. May the
propitious spirit and the propitious genii settle upon his body.

Spirit of Heaven, remember! Spirit of Earth, remember!

*Tablet IX*

May Nebs, the great steward, the recliner supreme among the gods, like
the god who has begotten him, seize upon his head; against his life may
he not break forth.

Spirit of Heaven, remember! Spirit of Earth, remember!

*Tablet X*

On the sick man by the sacrifice of mercy may perfect health shine like
bronze; may the Sun-god give this man life; may Merodach, the eldest son
of the deep, give him strength, prosperity and health.

Spirit of Heaven, remember! Spirit of Earth, remember!

(Nin-cigal--The Goddess of the House of Death)
