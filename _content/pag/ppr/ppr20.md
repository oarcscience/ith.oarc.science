### PRAYER TO BUDDHA

([*Buddhist*](errata.htm#1))

THOU in whom innumerable creatures believe!  
Thou, Buddha, Victor over the hosts of evil!  
Thou, all-wise Being, come down to our world!  
Made perfect and glorified by in-numerable by-gone revolutions; always
pitiful, always gracious toward all creatures!  
Look down upon us; for the time has come to pour out blessings on all
creatures.  
Be gracious to us from thy throne built in thy heavenly world.  
Thou art the eternal redemption of all creatures, therefore bow down to
us with all thy unstained heavenly societies.
