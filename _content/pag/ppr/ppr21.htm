<p align="center">(<i>Hindu</i>)</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">(Agni, god of fire in every form, worshipped in every manifestation--sun, lightning, earth, fire--also adored as the spark of life in all of growth, is here invoked as both the sacred flame on the altar, and the highest priest officiating)</FONT></p>  
<p><DIR>I IMPLORE Agni, the chief priest, the divine minister of the sacrifice, the Hotri priest, the best giver of wealth.<br> Agni, worthy to be implored by former poets and by new, may he bring the gods hither!<br> Through Agni man gained wealth, satisfying even day by day, glorious wealth of vigorous kindred.<br> Agni, the offering which thou encirclest on all sides, that alone goes to the gods.<br> Agni, the Hotri priest, the wise counsellor, the truthful, the most glorious, may he, the God, come with the gods!<br> Whatever wealth thou, Agni, shalt bestow on the sacrificer, thine it will be, forsooth, Agni.<br> To thee, O Agni, we come day by day, bringing praise in mind, O Illuminator of Darkness!<br> To thee, the Lord of sacrifices, the bright Guarder of the Law, who art growing in thy own house.<br> Thou then, O Agni, be gracious to us like as a father to his son; stay with us for our welfare!</DIR></p>
