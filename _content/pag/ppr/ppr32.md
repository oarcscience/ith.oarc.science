### INVOCATION TO ORMAZD

(*Persian*)

IN THE name of God, the giver, forgiver, rich in love, praise be to the
name of Ormazd, the God with the name who always was, always is, and
always will be; the heavenly among the heavenly, with the name--"From
whom alone is derived rule."

With all strength bring I thanks.

All good do I accept at thy command O God, and think, and speak, and do
it. I believe in the pure law; by every good work seek I forgiveness for
all sins. I keep pure the six powers--thought, speech, work, memory,
mind and understanding. According to thy will am I able to accomplish. O
accomplisher of good, thy honor, with good thoughts, good works.

I enter on the shining way to Paradise; may the fearful terror of hell
not overcome me! May I step over the bridge Chinevat. May I attain
Paradise with much perfume, and all brightness.

Praise be to the Overseer, the Lord, who rewards those who accomplish
good deeds according to his own wish, and at last purifies even the
wicked ones of hell.
