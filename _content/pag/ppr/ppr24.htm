</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PRAYER OF THE SINGER</h3>  
<p align="center">(<i>Mexican</i>)</p>  
<p>IN THE place of tears, I, the singer, watch my flowers, they enthrall my spirit as I walk alone with them--My spirit sad amid the flowers.</p>  
<p>In this spot where the herbage is as sweet ointment, and green as the turquoise and emerald, I dream of a song of beauty while the blossoms of beauty are in my hand!</p>  
<p>Let us rejoice now, O friends! O children! For the life of the earth-born is not long upon earth.</p>  
<p>I now go forth in swiftness--to the sweet songs I go forth--to the flowers of fragrance, O friends! O children!</p>  
<p>O h&eacute;! I sang aloud, O h&eacute;! I rained song blossoms as I sped!</p>  
<p>Let us go forth to the four ways! I, the singer, shall find and bring forth the flowers. Let us be glad while we live--hark to my song of joy!</p>  
<p>I, the poet, cry out a song for a place of joy--a radiant song which descends to the Underworld, and there turns and echoes back to you!</p>  
<p>I seek neither vestments or riches, O friends! O children! but a song for a place of joy!</p>
