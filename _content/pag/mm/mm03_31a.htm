<H2>Question XXXI</H2>
<H3>Of One Taken and Convicted, but Denying Everything</H3></CENTER>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
THE twelfth method of finishing and concluding a process on 
behalf of the faith is used when the person accused of heresy, 
after a diligent examination of the merits of the process in 
consultation with skilled lawyers, is found to be convicted of 
heresy by the evidence of the facts or by the legitimate 
production of witnesses, but not by his own confession. That is 
to say, he may be convicted by the evidence of the facts, in that 
he has publicly practiced heresy; or by the evidence of witnesses 
against whom he can take no legitimate exception; yet, though so 
taken and convicted, he firmly and constantly denies the charge. 
See Henry of Segusio <I>On Heresy</I>, question 34.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The procedure in such a case is as follows. The accused must be 
kept in strong durance fettered and chained, and must often be 
visited by the officers, both in a body and severally, who will 
use their own best endeavours and those of others to induce him 
to discover the truth; telling him that if he refuses and 
persists in his denial, he will in the end be abandoned to the 
secular law, and will not be able to escape temporal death.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if he continues for a long time in his denials, the Bishop 
and his officers, now in a body and now severally, now personally 
and now with the assistance of other honest and upright men, 
shall summon before them now one witness, now another, and warm 
him to attend strictly to what he has deposed, and to be sure 
whether or not he has told the truth; that he should beware lest 
in damning another temporally he damn himself eternally; that if 
he be afraid, let him at least tell them the truth in secret, 
that the accused should not die unjustly. And let them be careful 
to talk to him in such a way that they may see clearly whether or 
not his depositions have been true.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if the witnesses, after this warning, adhere to their 
statements, and the accused maintains his denials, let not the 
Bishop and his officers on that account be in any haste to 
pronounce a definitive sentence and hand the prisoners over to 
secular law; but let them detain him still longer, now persuading 
him to confess, now yet again urging the witnesses (but one at a 
time) to examine their consciences as well. And let the Bishop 
and his officers pay particular attention to that witness who 
seems to be of the best conscience and the most disposed to good, 
and let them more insistently charge him on his conscience to 
speak the truth whether or not the matter was as he had deposed. 
And if they see any witness vacillate, or there are any other 
indications that he has given false evidence, let them attest him 
according to the counsel of learned men, and proceed as justice 
shall require.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For it is very often found that after a person so convicted by 
credible witnesses has long persisted in his denials, he has at 
length relented, especially on being truly informed that he will 
not be delivered to the secular Court, but be admitted to mercy 
if he confesses his sin, and he has then freely confessed the 
truth which he had so long denied. And it is often found that the 
witnesses, actuated by malice and overcome by enmity, have 
conspired together to accuse an innocent person of the sin of 
heresy; but afterwards, at the frequent entreaty of the Bishop 
and his officers, their consciences have been stricken with 
remorse and, by Divine inspiration, they have revoked their 
evidence and confessed that they have out of malice put that 
crime upon the accused. Therefore the prisoner in such a case is 
not to be sentenced hastily, but must be kept for a year or more 
before he is delivered up to the secular Court.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
When a sufficient time has elapsed, and after all possible care 
has been taken, if the accused who has been thus legally 
convicted has acknowledged his guilt and confessed in legal from 
that he hath been for the period stated ensnared in the crime of 
heresy, and has consented to abjure that and every heresy, and to 
perform such satisfaction as shall seem proper to the Bishop and 
Inquisitor for one convicted of heresy both by his own confession 
and the legitimate production of witnesses; then let him as a 
penitent heretic publicly abjure all heresy, in the manner which 
we have set down in the eighth method of concluding a process on 
behalf of the faith.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if he has confessed that he hath fallen into such heresy, but 
nevertheless obstinately adheres to it, he must be delivered to 
the secular Court as an impenitent, after the manner of the tenth 
method which we have explained above.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if the accused has remained firm and unmoved in his denial of 
the charges against him, but the witnesses have withdrawn their 
charges, revoking their evidence and acknowledging their guilt, 
confessing that they had put so great a crime upon an innocent 
man from motives of rancour and hatred, or had been suborned or 
bribed thereto; then the accused shall be freely discharged, but 
they shall be punished as false witnesses, accusers or informers. 
This made clear by Paul of Burgos in his comment on the Canon c. 
<I>multorum</I>. And sentence or penance shall be pronounced 
against them as shall seem proper to the Bishop and Judges; but 
in any case such false witnesses must be condemned to perpetual 
imprisonment on a diet of bread and water, and to do penance for 
all the days of their life, being made to stand upon the steps 
before the church door, etc. However, the Bishops have power to 
mitigate or even to increase the sentence after a year or some 
other period, in the usual manner.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if the accused, after a year or other longer period which has 
been deemed sufficient, continues to maintain his denials, and 
the legitimate witnesses abide by their evidence, the Bishop and 
Judges shall prepare to abandon him to the secular Court; sending 
to him certain honest men zealous for the faith, especially 
religious, to tell him that he cannot escape temporal death while 
he thus persists in his denial, but will be delivered up as an 
impenitent heretic to the power of the secular Court. And the 
Bishop and his officers shall give notice to the Bailiff or 
authority of the secular Court that on such a day at such an hour 
and in such a place (not inside a church) he should come with his 
attendants to receive an impenitent heretic whom they will 
deliver to him. And let him make public proclamation in the usual 
places that all should be present on such a day at such an hour 
and place to hear a sermon preached on behalf of the faith, and 
that the Bishop and his officer will hand over a certain 
obstinate heretic to the secular Court.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
On the appointed day for the pronouncement of sentence the Bishop 
and his officer shall be in the place aforesaid, and the prisoner 
shall be placed on high before the assembled clergy and people so 
that he may be seen by all, and the secular authorities shall be 
present before the prisoner. Then sentence shall be pronounced in 
the following manner:<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We, N., by the mercy of God Bishop of such city, or Judge in the 
territories of such Prince, seeing that you, N., of such a place 
in such a Diocese, have been accused before us of such heresy 
(naming it); and wishing to be more certainly informed whether 
the charges made against you were true, and whether you walked in 
darkness or in the light; we proceeded to inform ourselves by 
diligently examining the witnesses, by often summoning and 
questioning you on oath, and admitting an Advocate to plead in 
your defence, and by proceeding in every way as we were bound by 
the canonical decrees.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And wishing to conclude your trial in a manner beyond all doubt, 
we convened in solemn council men learned in the Theological 
faculty and in the Canon and Civil Laws. And having diligently 
examined and discussed each circumstance of the process and 
maturely and carefully considered with the said learned men 
everything which has been said and done in this present case, we 
find that you, N., have been legally convicted of having been 
infected with the sin of heresy for so long a time, and that you 
have said an done such and such (naming them) on account of which 
it manifestly appears that you are legitimately convicted of the 
said heresy.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But since we desired, and still desire, that you should confess 
the truth and renounce the said heresy, and be led back to the 
bosom of Holy Church and to the unity of the Holy Faith, that so 
you should save your soul and escape the destruction of both your 
body and soul in hell; we have by our own efforts and those of 
others, and by delaying your sentence for a long time, tried to 
induce you to repent; but you being obstinately given over to 
wickedness have scorned to agree to our wholesome advice, and 
have persisted and do persist with stubborn and defiant mind in 
your contumacious and dogged denials; and this we say with grief, 
and grieve and mourn in saying it. But since the Church of God 
has waited so long for you to repent and acknowledge your guilt, 
and you have refused and still refuse, her grace and mercy can go 
no farther.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Wherefore that you may be an example to others and that they may 
be kept from all such heresies, and that such crimes may not 
remain unpunished: We the Bishop and Judges named on behalf of 
the faith, sitting in tribunal as Judges judging, and having 
before us the Holy Gospels that our judgement may proceed as from 
the countenance of God and our eyes see with equity, and having 
before our eyes only God and the glory and honour of the Holy 
Faith, we judge, declare and pronounce sentence that you standing 
here in our presence on this day at the hour and place appointed 
for the hearing of your final sentence, are an impenitent 
heretic, and as such to be delivered or abandoned to secular 
justice; and as an obstinate and impenitent heretic we have by 
this sentence cast you off from the ecclesiastical Court and 
deliver and abandon you to secular justice and the power of the 
secular Court. And we pray that the said secular Court may 
moderate its sentence of death upon you. this sentence was given, 
etc.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The Bishop and Judges may, moreover, arrange that just men 
zealous for the faith, known to and in the confidence of the 
secular Court, shall have access to the prisoner while the 
secular Court is performing its office, in order to console him 
and even yet induce him to confess the truth, acknowledge his 
guilt, and renounce his errors.<BR> 

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if it should happen that after the sentence, and when the 
prisoner is already at the place where he is to be burned, he 
should say that he wishes to confess the truth and acknowledge 
his guilt, and does so; and if he should be willing to abjure 
that and every heresy; although it may be presumed that he does 
this rather from fear of death than for love of the truth, yet I 
should be of the opinion that he may in mercy be received as a 
penitent heretic and be imprisoned for life. See the gloss on the 
chapters <I>ad abolendam</I> and <I>excommunicamus</I>. 
Nevertheless, according to the rigour of the law, the Judges 
ought not to place much faith in a conversion of this sort; and 
furthermore, they can always punish him on account of the 
temporal injuries which he has committed.
