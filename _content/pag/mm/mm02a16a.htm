<H3>Of Three Ways in which Men and Women may be Discovered to be Addicted to Witchcraft: Divided into Three Heads: and First of the Witchcraft of Archers.</H3></CENTER>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For our present purpose the last class of witchcraft is that which is 
practised in three forms by men; and first we must consider the seven deadly 
and horrible crimes which are committed by wizards who are archers. For 
first, on the Sacred Day of the Passion of Our Lord, that is to say, on Good 
Friday, as it is called, during the solemnization of the Mass of the 
Presanctified they shoot with arrows, as at a target, at the most sacred 
image of the Crucifix. Oh, the cruelty and injury to the Saviour! Secondly, 
though there is some doubt whether they have to utter a verbal form of 
apostasy to the devil in addition to that apostasy of deed, yet whether it 
be so or not, no greater injury to the Faith can be done by a Christian. For 
it is certain that, if such things were done by an infidel, they would be of 
no efficacy; for no such easy method of gratifying their hostility to the 
Faith is granted to them. Therefore these wretches ought to consider the 
truth and power of the Catholic Faith, for the confirmation of which God 
justly permits such crimes.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Thirdly, such an archer has to shoot three or four arrows in this way, and 
as a consequence he is able to kill on any day just the same number of men. 
Fourthly, they have the following assurance from the devil; that though 
they must first actually set eyes on the man they wish to kill, and must 
bend their whole will on killing him, yet it matter not where the man may 
shut himself up, for he cannot be protected, but the arrows which have been 
shot will be carried and struck into him by the devil.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Fifthly, they can shoot an arrow with such 
precision as to shoot a penny from a person's head without hurting his head, 
and they can continue to do this indefinitely. Sixthly, in order to gain 
this power they have to offer homage of body and soul to the devil. We shall 
give some instances of this sort of practice.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For a certain prince of the Rhineland, named Eberhard Longbeard because he 
let his beard grow, had, before he was sixty years old, acquired for himself 
some of the Imperial territory, and was besieging a certain castle named 
Lendenbrunnen because of the raids which were made by the men of the castle. 
And he had in his company a wizard of this sort, named Puncker, who so 
molested the men of the castle that he killed them all in succession with 
his arrows, except one. And this is how he proceeded. Whenever he had looked 
at a man, it did not matter where that man went to or hid himself, he had 
only to loose an arrow and that man was mortally wounded and killed; and he 
was able to shoot three such arrows every day because he had shot three 
arrows at the image of the Saviour. It is probable that the devil favours 
the number three more than any other, because it represents an effective 
denial of the Holy Trinity. But after he had shot those three arrows, he 
could only shoot with the same uncertainty as other men. At last one of the 
men of the castle called out to him mockingly, &#0147;Puncker, will you not 
at least spare the ring which hangs in the gate?&#0148; And he answered from 
outside in the night, &#0147;No; I shall take it away on the day that the 
castle is captured.&#0148; And he fulfilled his promise: for when, as has 
been said, all were killed except one, and the castle had been taken, he 
took that ring and hung it in his own house at Rorbach in the diocese of 
Worms, where it can be seen hanging to this day. But afterwards he was one 
night killed with their spades by some peasants whom he had injured, and he 
perished in his sins.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It is told also of this man, that a very eminent person wished to have 
proof of his skill, and for a test placed his little son before the target 
with a penny on his cap, and ordered him to shoot the penny away without 
removing the cap. The wizard said that he would do it, but with reluctance, 
not being sure whether the devil was seducing him to his death. But, 
yielding to the persuasions of the prince, he placed one arrow in readiness 
in the cord which was slung over his should, fitted another to his bow, and 
shot the penny from the cap without hurting the boy. Seeing this, the prince 
asked him why he had placed the arrow in that cord; and he answered: &#0147;If 
I had been deceived by the devil and had killed my son, since I should have 
had to die I would quickly have shot you with the other arrow to avenge my 
death.&#0148;<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And though such wickedness is permitted by God for the proving and 
chastisement of the faithful, nevertheless more powerful miracles are 
performed by the Saviour's mercy for the strengthening and glory of the 
Faith.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For in the diocese of Constance, near the castle of Hohenzorn and a convent 
of nuns, there is a newly-built church where may be seen an image of Our 
Saviour pierced with an arrow and bleeding. And the truth of this miracle 
is shown as follows. A miserable wretch who wished to be assured by the 
devil of having three or four arrows with which he could, in the manner we 
have told, kill whom he pleased, shot and pierced with an arrow (just as it 
is still seen) a certain Crucifix at a crossroad; and when it miraculously 
began to bleed, the wretch was stuck motionless 
in his steps by Divine power. And when he was asked by a passer-by why he 
stood fixed there, he shook his head, and trembling in his arms and his 
hands, in which he held the bow, and all over his body, could answer nothing. 
So the other looked about him, and saw the Crucifix with the arrow and the 
blood, and said: &#0147;You villain, you have pierced the image of Our 
Lord!&#0148; And calling some others, he told them to see that he did not 
escape (although, as has been said, he could not move), and ran to the 
castle and told what had happened. And they came down and found the wretched 
man in the same place; and when they had questioned him, and he had 
confessed his crime, he was removed from that district by public justice, 
and suffered a miserable death in merited expiation of his deeds.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But, alas! how horrible it is to think that human perversity is not afraid 
to countenance such crimes. For it is said that in the halls of the great 
such men are maintained to glory in their crimes in open contempt of the 
Faith, to the heavy offence of the Divine Majesty, and in scorn of Our 
Redeemer; and are permitted to boast of their deeds.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Wherefore such protectors, defenders and patrons are to be judged not only 
heretics, but even apostates from the Faith, and are to be punished in the 
manner that will be told. And this is the seventh deadly sin of these 
wizards. For first they are by very law excommunicated; and if the patrons 
are clerics they are degraded and deprived of all office and benefit, nor 
can they be restored except by a special indulgence from the Apostolic See. 
Also, if after their proscription such protectors remain obstinate in their 
excommunication for the period of a year, they are to be condemned as 
heretics.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
This is in accordance with the Canon Law; for, in Book VI, it touches on the 
question of direct or indirect interference with the proceedings of 
Diocesans and Inquisitors in the cause of the Faith, and mentions the 
aforesaid punishment to be inflicted after a year. For it say: We forbid 
any interference from Potentates, temporal Lords and Rulers, and their 
Officials, etc. Anyone may refer to the chapter.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And further, that witches and their protectors are by very law to be 
excommunicated is shown in the Canon of the suppressing of the heresy of 
witchcraft; especially where it says: We excommunicate and anathematize all 
heretics, Catharists, Sectaries . . . and others, by whatever names they 
are known, etc. And with these it includes all their sympathizers and 
protectors, and others; saying later on: Also we excommunicate all followers, 
protectors, defenders and patrons of such heretics.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The Canon Law prescribes various penalties which are incurred within the 
space of a year by such heretics, whether laymen or clerics, where it says: 
We place under the ban of excommunication all their protectors, patrons and 
defenders, so that when any such has been so sentenced and has scorned to 
recant his heresy, within a year from that time he shall be considered an 
outlaw, and shall not be admitted to any office or council, nor be able to 
vote in the election of such officers, nor be allowed free opportunity of 
giving evidence; he shall not succeed to any inheritance, and no one shall 
be held responsible for any business transaction with him. If he be a judge, 
his judgement shall not stand, nor shall any case be brought to his hearing. 
If he be an advocate, he shall not be allowed to plead. If he be a notary, 
no instrument drawn up by him shall have any weight, but is to be condemned 
together with its condemned author; and similar penalties are decreed for 
the holders of other offices. But if he be a cleric, he is to be degraded 
from all office and benefice; for, his guilt being the greater, it is more 
heavily avenged. And if any such, after they have been marked down by the 
Church, contemptuously try to ignore their punishment, the sentence of 
excommunication is to be rigorously applied to them to the extreme limits of 
vengeance. And the clergy shall not administer the Sacraments of the Church 
to such heretics, nor presume to give them Christian burial, nor accept 
their alms and oblations, on pain of being deprived of their office, to 
which they can in no way be restored without a special indulgence from the 
Apostolic See.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
There are, finally, many other penalties incurred by such heretics even when 
they do not persist in their obstinacy for a year, and also by their 
children and grandchildren: for they can be degraded by a Bishop or by an 
Inquisitor, declared deprived of all titles, possessions, honours and 
ecclesiastical benefits, in fine of all public offices whatsoever. But this 
is only when they are persistently and obstinately impenitent. Also their 
sons to the second generation may be disqualified and unable to obtain 
either ecclesiastical preferment or public office; but this is to be 
understood only of the descendants on the father's side, and not on the 
mother's, and only of those who are impenitent. Also all their followers, 
protectors, fautors and patrons shall be denied all right of petition or 
appeal; and this is explained as meaning that, after a verdict has been 
returned that they are such heretics, then can they make no appeal before 
their sentence, however much they may have been in any respect ill-used or 
treated with undue severity. Much more could be adduced in support of our 
standpoint, but this is sufficient.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Now for the better understanding of what has been said, some few points are 
to be discussed. And first, if a prince or secular potentate employ such 
a wizard as we have described for the destruction of some castle in a just 
war, and with his help crushes the tyranny of wicked men; is his whole army 
to be considered as protectors and patrons of that wizard, and to be 
subjected to the penalties we have mentioned? The answer seems to be that 
the rigour of justice must be tempered on account of their numbers. For the 
leader, with his counsellors and advisers, must be considered to have aided 
and abetted such witchcraft, and they are by law implicated in the aforesaid 
penalties when, after being warned by their spiritual advisers, they have 
persisted in their bad course; and then they are to be judged protectors 
and patrons, and are to be punished. But the rest of the army, since they 
have no part in their leaders' council, but are simply prepared to risk 
their lives in defence of their country, although they may view with 
approval the feats of the wizard, nevertheless escape the sentence of 
excommunication; but they must in their confession acknowledge the guilt 
of the wizard, and in their absolution by the confessor must receive a 
solemn warning to hold all such practices for ever in detestation, and as 
far as they are able drive from their land all such wizards.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
It may be asked by whom such princes are to be absolved when they come to 
their senses, whether by their own spiritual advisers or by the Inquisitors? 
We answer that, if they repent, they may be absolved either by their 
spiritual advisers, or by the Inquisitors. This is provided in the Canon Law 
concerning the proceedings to be taken, in the fear of God and as a warning 
to men, against heretics, their followers, protectors, patrons and fautors, 
as also against those who are accused or suspected of heresy. But if any of 
the above, forswearing his former lapse into heresy, wish to return to the 
unity of the Church, he may receive the benefit of absolution provided by 
Holy Church.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
A prince, or any other, may be said to have returned to his senses when he 
has delivered up the wizard to be punished for his offences against the 
Creator; when he has banished from his dominions all who have been found 
guilty of witchcraft or heresy; when he is truly penitent for the past; and 
when, as becomes a Catholic prince, he is firmly determined in his mind not 
to show any favour to any other such wizard.
