<H2>Chapter II</H2>
<H3>Remedies prescribed for Those who are Bewitched by the Limitation of the Generative Power.</H3></CENTER>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Although far more women are witches than men, as was shown in the 
First Part of the work, yet men are more often bewitched than 
women. And the reason for this lies in the fact that God allows 
the devil more power over the venereal act, by which the original 
sin is handed down, than over other human actions. In the same 
way He allows more witchcraft to be performed by means of 
serpents, which are more subject to incantations than other 
animals, because that was the first instrument of the devil. And 
the venereal act can be more readily and easily bewitched in a 
man than in a woman, as has been clearly shown. For there are 
five ways in which the devil can impede the act of generation, 
and they are more easily operated against men.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
As far as possible we shall set out the remedies which can be 
applies in each separate kind of obstruction; and let him who is 
bewitched in this faculty take note to which class of obstruction 
he belongs. For there are five classes, according to Peter a 
Palude in his Fourth Book, dist. 34, of the trial of this sort of 
bewitchment.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
For the devil, being a spirit, has by his very nature power, with 
God's permission,  over a bodily creature, especially to promote 
or to prevent local motion. So by this power they can prevent the 
bodies of men and women from approaching each other; and this 
either directly or indirectly. Directly, when they remove one to 
a distance from another, and do not allow him to approach the 
other. Indirectly, when they cause some obstruction, or when they 
interpose themselves in an assumed body. So it happened that a 
young Pagan who had married an idol, but none the less contracted 
a marriage with a girl; but because of this he was unable to 
copulate with her, as has been shown above. 
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Secondly, the devil can inflame a man towards one woman and 
render him impotent towards another; and this he can secretly 
cause by the application of certain herbs or other matters of 
which he well knows the virtue for this purpose.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Thirdly, he can disturb the apperception of a man or a woman, so 
that he makes one appear hideous to the other; for, as has been 
shown, he can influence the imagination.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Fourthly, he can suppress the vigour of that member which is 
necessary for procreation; just as he can deprive any organ of 
the power of local motion.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Fifthly, he can prevent the flow of the semen to the members in 
which is the motive power, by as it were closing the seminal duct 
so that it does not descend to the genital vessels, or does not 
ascend again from them, or cannot come forth, or is spent vainly.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if a man should say: I do not know by which of these 
different methods I have been bewitched; all I know is that I 
cannot do anything with my wife: he should be answered in this 
way. If he is active and able with regard to other women, but not 
with his wife, then he is bewitched in the second way; for he can 
be certified as to the first way, that he is being deluded by 
Succubus or Incubus devils. Moreover, if he does not find his 
wife repellent, and yet cannot know her, but can know other 
women, then again it is the second way; but if he finds her 
repellent and cannot copulate with her, then it is the second and 
the third way. If he does not find her repellent and wishes to 
have connexion with her, but has no power in his member, then it 
is the fourth way. But if he has power in his member, yet cannot 
emit his semen, then it is the fifth way. The method of curing 
these will be shown where we consider whether those who live in 
grace and those who do not are equally liable to be bewitched in 
these manners; and we answer that they are not, with the 
exception of the fourth manner, and even then very rarely. For 
such an affliction can happen to a man living in grace and 
righteousness; but the reader must understand that in this case 
we speak of the conjugal act between married people; for in any 
other case they are all liable to bewitchment; for every venereal 
act outside wedlock is a mortal sin, and is only committed by 
those who are not in a state of grace.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
We have, indeed, the authority of the whole of Scriptural 
teaching that God allows the devil to afflict sinners more than 
the just. For although that most just man, Job, was stricken, yet 
he was not so particularly or directly in respect of the 
procreant function. And it may be said that, when a married 
couple are afflicted in this way, either both the parties or one 
of them is not living in a state of grace; and this opinion is 
substantiated in the Scriptures both by authority and by reason. 
For the Angel said to Tobias: The 
devil receives power against those who are given over to lust: 
and he proved it in the slaying of the seven husbands of the 
virgin Sara. 
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Cassian, in his <I>Collation of the Fathers</I>, quotes S. Antony as 
saying that the devil can in no way enter our mind or body unless 
he has first deprived it of all holy thoughts and made it empty 
and bare of spiritual contemplation. These words should not be 
applies to an evil affliction over the whole of the body, for 
when Job was so afflicted he was not denuded of Divine grace; but 
they have particular reference to a particular infirmity 
inflicted upon the body for some sin. And the infirmity we are 
considering can only be due to the sin of incontinence. For, as 
we have said, God allows the devil more power over that act than 
over other human acts, because of its natural nastiness, and 
because by it the first sin was handed down to posterity. 
Therefore when people joined in matrimony have for some sin been 
deprived of Divine help, God allows them to be bewitched chiefly 
in their procreant functions.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But if it is asked of what sort are those sins, it can be said, 
according to S. Jerome, that even in a state of matrimony it is 
possible to commit the sin of incontinence in various ways. See 
the text: He who loves his wife to excess is an adulterer. And 
they who love in this way are more liable to be bewitched after 
the manner we have said.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The remedies of the Church, then, are twofold: one applicable in 
the public court, the other in the tribunal of the confessional. 
As for the first, when it has been publicly found that the 
impotence is due to witchcraft, then it must be distinguished 
whether it is temporary or permanent. If it is only temporary, it 
does not annul the marriage. And it is assumed to be temporary 
if, within the space of three years, by using every possible 
expedient of the Sacraments of the Church and other remedies, a 
cure can be caused. But if, after that time, they cannot be cured 
by any remedy, then it is assumed to be permanent.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Now the disability either precedes both the contract and the 
consummation of marriage; and in this case it impedes the 
contract: or it follows the contract but precedes the 
consummation; and in this case it annuls the contract. For men 
are very often bewitched in this way because they have cast off 
their former mistresses, who, hoping that they were to be married 
and being disappointed, so bewitch the men that they cannot 
copulate with another woman. And in such a case, according to the 
opinion of many, the marriage already contracted is annulled, 
unless, like Our Blessed Lady and S. Joseph they are willing to 
live together in holy continence. This opinion is supported by 
the Canon where it says (23, q. I) that a marriage is confirmed 
by the carnal act. And a little later it says that impotence 
before such confirmation dissolves the ties of marriage. 
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Or else the disability follows the consummation of a marriage, 
and then it does not dissolve the bonds of matrimony. Much more 
to this effect is noted by the Doctors, where in various writings 
they treat of the obstruction due to witchcraft; but since it is 
not precisely relevant to the present inquiry, it is here 
omitted. 
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But some may find it difficult to understand how this function 
can be obstructed in respect of one woman but not of another. S. 
Bonaventura answers that this may be because some witch has 
persuaded the devil to effect this only with respect to one 
woman, or because God will not allow the obstruction to apply 
save to some particular woman. The judgement of God in this 
matter is a mystery, as in the case of the wife of Tobias. But 
how the devil procures this disability is plainly shown by what 
has already been said. And S. Bonaventura says that he obstructs 
the procreant function, not intrinsically by harming the organ, 
but extrinsically by impeding its use; and it is an artificial, 
not a natural impediment; and so he an cause it to apply to one 
woman and not to another. Or else he takes away all desire for 
one or another woman; and this he does by his own power, or else 
by means of some herb or stone or some occult creature. And in 
this he is in substantial agreement with Peter a Palude.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
The ecclesiastical remedy in the tribunal of God is set forth in 
the Canon where it says: If with the permission of the just and 
secret judgement of God, through the arts of sorceresses and 
witches and the preparation of the devil, men are bewitched in 
their procreant function, they are to be urged to make clean 
confession to God and His priest of all their sins with a 
contrite heart and a humble spirit; and to make satisfaction to 
God with many tears and large offerings and prayers and fasting.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
From these words it is clear that such afflictions are only on 
account of sin, and occur only to those who do not live in a 
state of grace. It proceeds to tell how the ministers of the 
Church can effect a cure by means of exorcisms and the other 
protections and cures provided by the Church. In this way, with 
the help of God, Abraham cured by his prayers 
Abimelech and his house.
<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
In conclusion we may say that there are five remedies which may 
lawfully be applied to those who are bewitched in this way: 
namely, a pilgrimage to some holy and venerable shrine; true 
confession of their sins with contrition; the plentiful use of 
the sign of the Cross and devout prayer; lawful exorcism by 
solemn words, the nature of which will be explained later; and 
lastly, a remedy can be effected by prudently approaching the 
witch, as was shown in the case of the Count who for three years 
was unable to cohabit carnally with a virgin whom he had married.
