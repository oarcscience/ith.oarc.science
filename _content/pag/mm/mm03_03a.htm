<H2>Question III</H2>
<H3>Of the Solemn Adjuration and Re-examination of Witnesses</H3></CENTER>


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
But it may be asked whether the Judge can compel witnesses to sweat an oath 
to tell the truth in a case concerning the Faith or witches, of if he can 
examine them many times. We answer that he can do so, especially an 
ecclesiastical Judge, and that in ecclesiastical cases witnesses can be 
compelled to speak the truth, and this on oath, since otherwise their 
evidence would not be valid. For the Canon Law says: The Archbishop or 
Bishop may make a circuit of the parish in which it is rumoured that there 
are heretics, and compel three or more men of good repute, or even, if it 
seems good to him, the whole neighbourhood, to give evidence. And if any 
through damnable obstinacy stubbornly refuse to take the oath, they shall 
on that account be considered as heretics.<BR>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
And that the witnesses can be examined several times is shown by the Canon, 
where it says that, when the witnesses have given their evidence in a 
confused manner, or appear to have withheld part of their knowledge for 
some reason, the Judge must take care to examine them afresh; for he may 
legally do so.
