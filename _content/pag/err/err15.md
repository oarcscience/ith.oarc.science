# CHAPTER II

### BIRDS AND TREASURES

No one knows better than a bird of the air  
Where treasures are concealed."  
                              ARISTOPHANES, *The Birds*

![](img/27001.jpg)IT was an ancient belief in many countries that the
birds knew all things, and, as OVID says, announce the will of the gods,
because they are near them; that is, they fly to heaven, or as SENECA
expresses it, "Birds are inspired by the divinities." And it was
especially an old Etrusco-Latin, as well as a Greek conviction, that
they knew where treasure was concealed. Thus ARISTOPHANES in The Birds
says, that--"When a man asks birds where precious metals are hidden,
they always indicate the richest mines."

In relation to this I have, from Rocca Casciano, the following, which
appears to be very old:--

 

When one would find a treasure, he must take the door of the house in
which he dwells, and carry it forth into the fields by night, till he
come under a tree.

"Then he must wait till many birds fly over him, and when they come he
must throw down the door, making a great noise. Then the birds in fear
will speak with a human voice--*colla una voce diranno dove e
nascosta*--and tell where a treasure is buried."

 

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

So far as the birds arc concerned this treasure-hunting is Etruscan and
Greek. The mysterious connection of the door with finding treasures
appears in other countries. Thus in GRIMM'S *Stories*, Stupid Catherine
carries away the door from her house, and by means of it--that is to
say, by throwing it down and thereby making a terrible noise--frightens
away a band of thieves, who leave behind them their treasure. The same
story is common in Italy, where it is told with very coarse incidents of
a stupid youth.

The reader will find by careful study and comparison of the whole which
I have given in this book, that these Romagnola traditions have a very
archaic stamp, and do not seem to have borrowed from other sources, but,
in perhaps all cases, to. have been original. I have been very much
astonished, indeed, to find how extremely ignorant my living authorities
were of the traditions, popular mythology, and folk-lore of Southern
Italy, as given in the collections of PITRÉ. There is no parallel case
in Europe of people, speaking almost the same language and belonging to
the same race, who have so little tradition in common as Tuscans and
Neapolitans, or Sicilians.

There is in the folk-lore of La Romagna, as in the language of the
people, something which is harsh, simple, and Northern--not exactly
German or Scandinavian--but with traces, as it were, of some strange
primeval race, like them and yet not the same. It may owe something to
the Lombard, and possibly to the Celt, but, after all, these traditions
and sorceries are neither Lombardic nor Celtic. What they seem to be by
every analogy is Etruscan, allied to Sabine.

This finding a treasure by means of birds agrees wonderfully, with the
very ancient Latin legend of the seer ATTA NAVIUS, who, when a child in
his Sabine home, kept swine. Once, while he slept, some of his herd
wandered away, and on awaking he could not find them. At first he wept
bitterly, being afraid of his father's anger, but, plucking up heart, he
went to the chapel of the Lares, in the next vineyard, and prayed the
guardian spirits that he might find his pigs, promising them if he did
so, to offer them the largest bunch of grapes in the place. He found the
pigs, but how was he to find the largest bunch of grapes? He watched for
a flock of birds, and they led him to it. Then his father, knowing this,
took him to town, and put him to school to the masters of divination and
other learning. If we substitute for the largest bunch of grapes, a
treasure, we have here the spirit or essence of the Tuscan tradition.
Divination not only by the flight, but by the voices of birds, formed
one of the most important elements of the old Etruscan soothsaying--the
*augurium ex avium volatu vel garritu* being the second of the five
principal classes.

The bird who specially indicates treasures by night in old Latin lore is
the

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

Picus Martins, or great woodpecker. "He always appears," says PRELLER
(*Myth*. p. 298), "as a wood-bird and digger in forests, where he lives
alone and digs and hews and knows all hidden secrets and treasures." His
Umbrian name was *peiqu*, at present in Romagnola it is *piga*. His
connection with the door appears to be this: ÆLIAN (*Hist. of An*., i.,
45) and PLINY (*Hist. Nat*., x., 20) mention that if the hole or door of
the woodpecker's nest in a tree be closed, the bird will bring an herb,
which at once removes the impediment. If this herb be secured it will
open any door. But I offer this only as a mere conjecture. In any case
the mere coincidence is worth noting.

As in very early times, therefore, the red-headed woodpecker was
regarded as a goblin, or a god, named Picus, who knew where treasures
were hidden, and sometimes revealed them. It is probable that from this
myth were derived the elves with red caps, who had the same attributes.

And if Picus was the origin of the red-cap goblin who is found all over
Europe, and even among the Eastern Algonkin Indians of America (as
Mikumwess), I also conjecture that research will yet show either that
all the Teutonic or Northern polytheism or fairy mythology is either
derived from an early Latin source, or else has common origin with it.
But as the Latins and Etruscans had attained great culture while the
Northern races were in a very barbarous state, I prefer the former
theory. It is indeed beginning to be admitted that the Scandinavian
mythology, far from being autochthonic, exhibits throughout traces of
Latin influence.

#### THE SPELL OF THE FALLING STAR

Such Meteors, or failing stars, which men of yore could not explain,
were held to be divine omens, or intimations of the desires of the gods,
and according to Homer that one signified to the other that there should
be war or peace."--FRIEDRICH ("Meteore"), *Symbolik der Natur*, p. 100.

All over the world people say in joke or earnest that if, when we see a
meteor, or "a falling star," dart across the sky, and can utter a wish
before it disappears, that wish will be granted. Among the old Norsemen
such a line of headlong fire in the heaven was believed to be caused by
a dragon flashing along afar, hence the frequent mention of the
appearance of such beings. In the Medicine of MARCELLUS the sight of
such a heavenly body is applied to working a celestial cure for
lippitude, or blear eyes, as follows:--

 

"Ut omnino non lippias, cum stellam cadere vel transcurre videris,
numera, et celeriter numera, donec se condat, tot enim annis, quot
numerabis, non lippies."

 

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

 

("That your sight may never be dim, when you see a star fall or fly
across the sky, count, and count quickly, ere it disappears, and so many
numbers as you count, so many years will you be clear-sighted.")

 

In Tuscany, when you see a star fall--*quando si vede una stella chi
cadde*--one should say:--

 

"Non casca la stella  
Ma casca l'amante mio  
Che venga o di giorno,  
O di notte,  
O al punto di mezza notte,  
O battere alle porte di casa mia  
Che non possa vivere,  
Non possa stare,  
Finche alla porta di casa mia  
Non viene appichiare

("It is not the star which falls  
But my lover: may he fall  
'Till he come by day or night,  
Or at midnight,  
To beat at my door.  
Nor may he live nor stand,  
Till he knocks at my door")

 

Or else this for an enemy:--

 

"Non casca la stella,  
Ma casca la maledizione  
Che di giorno e di notte  
Non faccio altro che maledire  
La maledizione che casca  
In nome di . . . "

'Tis not the star which falls,  
But my curse,  
That by night, or day,  
I do naught save curse,  
That the curse may fall  
On . . .") (Here the enemy is named.)

 

The conception that as a star falls from the sky, so may your enemy go
downward headlong with your curse pursuing him, is brilliant, original,
vindictive, and replete with "pure cussedness." I have no doubt that to
a true believer and a "good hater" it must be an immense relief. It is
suggestive of Lucifer, the Star of the Morning, plunging headlong to
hell from the height of heaven, while an Arab sees in it a daring
*djinn* who has attempted to scale the walls of paradise and been
repulsed by the angels.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

#### THE SPELL OF THE ACORNS

"'Men of yore devoured one another,' says Diodorus Siculus, 'but Jupiter
forbade this, giving them instead acorns.' Hence these are called the
daughters of the Oak, since they so resemble female heads with the hair
bound in ancient fashion."--PRELLER

There is given by MARCELLUS (GRIMM, p. 16; H., c. 15, p. III) a curious
forward and backward song and ceremony to cure soreness of the tonsils.
It is as follows:--

 

"Glandulas mane carminabis, si dies minuetur, si nox, ad vesperam, et
digito medicinali, ac pollice continens eas, dices:--

"Novem glandulæ sorores,  
Octo glandulæ sorores,  
Septem glandulæ sorores,  
Sex glandulæ sorores,  
Quinque glandulæ sorores,  
Quattuor glandulæ sorores,  
Tres glandulæ sorores,  
Duæ glandulæ sorores,  
    Una glandula soror.

Novem fiunt glandulæ,  
Octo fiunt glandulæ,  
Septem fiunt glandulæ,  
Sex fiunt glandulæ,  
Quinque fiunt glandulæ,  
Quattuor fiunt glandulæ,  
Tres fiunt glandulæ,  
Duæ fiunt glandulæ,  
Una fit glandulæ,  
    Nulla fit glandula."

 

This is preceded by another charm, to which reference is made. The whole
came to this, that the patient is to take nine acorns, either just
before sunrise or sunset, and holding them (I think he here means
counting them, one by one) with the middle finger and thumb, say:--

 

"Nine little acorn sisters (or girls),  
Eight little acorn sisters,  
Seven little acorn sisters,"

 

and so on, diminishing to

 

"One little acorn girl."

 

Then begin with "Nine little acorn sisters," and count back till you
come to "Nulla fit glandula"--"And then there was no little acorn girl."
I am sure that

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

in its original form this was *Ten* little acorn girls, following the
fingers. There is in America and England a child's "counting-out" song
for a game which runs from ten little Indian boys to one, and then
backwards.

This incantation is still used in Tuscany, though I could not learn that
it is specially applied to the cure of the tonsils. But it was not
limited even in the time of MARCELLUS to these. He himself gives (19,
20, GRIMM, p. 13) two other charms in which nine grains of barley are
counted in nearly the same manner. And also a word (21, *Ibid*) to stop
the flow of blood:--

 

"Si cycuma, cucuma, ucuma,  
        Cuma, ma, a.

 

Which is like another English nursery song:--

 

"Constantinople, stantinople, tinople, nople, ople, *pull*!  
Pull, ople, nople, tinople, stantinople, Constantinople."

 

In which we have the counting or addition and subtraction in a different
form. The spell or child's game as used in Tuscany is, however, applied
to good luck, and runs as follows: Taking ten acorns, the actor sings:--

 

"Tu lo sai la voglio fare,  
Per l'indietro io voglio mandare,  
La verita in mia mano la deve dare,  
Queste *diande* per l'indietro io contero  
Fino al uno io tornero.  
E se mai non sbagliero,  
La vittoria io la vincero.  
Adesso io incomincio  
Da uno, due, tre quattro,  
Cinque, sei, sette otto, nove e dieci  
Dieci, nove otto, sette,  
Sei, cinque, quattro, tre  
Due--uno!  
Senza mai sbagliare,  
La vittoria io la devo fare,  
E mai nel contare io sbagliero  
La vittoria io vincero."

 

Or in English:--

 

"You know what I want to do.  
I will work it back for you,  
The truth shall be at my command.  
I will count these acorns in my hand  
There shall no error be. <span id="page_276">p. 276</span>  
Thus I'll gain a victory,  
And so I now begin, you see:  
From one, two, three, four,  
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.  
Ten, nine, eight, seven,  
Six, five, four, three,  
Two--one.  
So without the least mistake  
Now the victory I take.  
I have counted well and true,  
To me the victory is due!"

 

I was at first disposed to regard this as a mere counting forwards and
backwards, or counting-out rhyme, as it is used, not having read it
carefully. But on discovering that the word *diande*, which I did not
know, was the Romagnola for *ghiande*, or acorns, I saw it was
essentially the same with the incantation of Marcellus. I then learned
that acorns were actually used in the count.

The idea which runs through the spells of Marcellus is that the success
of the cure depends on the counter not making a mistake, and, in the
modern Tuscan version, that if one undertakes anything, or wishes to
know if he will succeed, he is to infer the result in like manner. It is
very evident that, as the same principle was applied in different ways,
there must have also been some *Hauptpunkt*, or head-central invocation
by counting, to divine luck in general, and I hazard the conjecture that
we have this transferred to us in the modern Italian spell. That is to
say, that there was an Etruscan *chief* spell to divine whether good
fortune would result from an undertaking--which spell was modified to
apply to certain disorders, &c. And as divination as to the success of
undertakings was the very beginning and formed the bulk of all
Etrusco-Roman augury and rites, it would be very remarkable if this
Italian spell should be the chief one, or nucleus of the rest. This is
only conjecture, but I entertain no doubt that it is in any case as old
as the time of Marcellus, and therefore in all probability
Roman-Etruscan.

According to JOHANNES MEURSIUS (*De Ludis Græcorum*), there was among
the Greeks a game with acorns called *Tropa*. The description of it is
not given. But I conjecture that it was the same as that of the Italian
which is at once a spell for good luck and also a child's counting-out
game-the object being, as in "Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled
peppers," to repeat a difficult formula rapidly without an error.

There is yet another species of divination relating to this nut. Take as
many acorns as there are letters in any person's name, plant them, and
if they all come up or grow well, he or she will prosper, or you will
win his love.

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

The reader who is interested in counting-out rhymes will find much on
the subject in the work of Carrington Bolton; also in another recently
published by D. Nutt, London, and in the *English-Folk-Rhymes*, by G. F.
Northall (London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner, and Co.). A vast amount
of ancient erudition on the subject of divining by numbers and similar
matters, may be found in a very rare work, of which I possess a copy,
entitled, *Tractatus Philologicus de Sortitione Veterum, Hebræorum
inprimis ex S. Scriptura Talmude*, &c., by MARTIN MAURITIUS. Basle,
1692. It does not seem to have been observed that the Sortes Virgilianæ
were in the nature of, or allied to, counting-out rhymes. Mauritius
quotes from the work of Rabbi Ben Ezra a curious tale of how the lives
of certain men doomed to be cast into the sea were lost, and those of
certain *Talmidim* saved by judiciously managing a counting-out song.
There is a curious and rude old German version of this. The chapter is
in connection with the one *De Sortibus poeticis*. Only counting out by
numbers is described, but the counting by poetical lines is evident from
the context. And it is evident that such counting out to save lives
would be regarded as cabalistic or magical.

#### THE SPELL OF THE SWALLOW

"O rondinella bella, tu sei un' incantrice."  
                             

Canzoni Populari d'Agrumi

MARCELLUS of Bordeaux, in treating of disorders of the eyes, informs us
that by the aid of the *hirundo*, or swallow, all such trouble may be
effectually averted as follows:--

 

"Cum primum hirundinem audieris vel videris tacitus illieo ad fontem
decurres vel ad puteum, et inde aqua oculos fovebis et rogabis deum, et
eo anno non lippias, doloremque omnem oculorum tuorum hirundines
auferant."

 

Or in English:--

 

When you hear or see the first swallow, go, without speaking, to the
first well or fountain and there wash your eyes and pray God that that
year they may not be dimmed, and so the swallows will carry away all
trouble from them."

 

In Tuscany at the present day the sufferer does the same for sore eyes,
and then repeats the following:--

 

La prima rondinella di primaver' e arrivata  
La buona fortuna mi ha portata  
Ad una fonte sono andata  
E gli occhi mi sono lavata, <span id="page_278">p. 278</span>  
Che da tanto tempo ero amallata,  
E nessun medico mi e riuscito,  
Ma la prima rondinella che e arrivata  
Questa grazia me l'ha fatta  
Benedette siano, sempre le belle,  
Le beate rondinelle!

("The first spring swallow I have seen,  
A lucky thing it was, I ween.  
I ran to where the fountain flies,  
And in its water washed my eyes,  
Which were so long my pain and grief,  
Yet no physician brought relief;  
Yet the first swallow which I see  
Has caused a happy cure to me.  
Blest may the swallows ever be!")

 

It may be observed that this incantation contains *all* that is in the
Roman prescription, and, what is more, supplies the *spoken* spell which
is wanting in it. *Et rogabis Deum*--"And pray God"--is certainly an
early Christian interpolation. In the Italian the swallow itself is
invoked and thanked, which is in perfect keeping with the very ancient
hymns, Greek and Latin, in which it is mentioned.

Marcellus also teaches us again that though "the first swallow does not
make a summer" it rules the spring, whether it be of weather or water,
and may thereby prevent toothache. For when you see it--as before--hold
your tongue and "ad aquam nitidam accedes"--go to pure shining water,
and dip your middle finger of the right hand in it and say:--

 

"Hirundo tibi dico  
Quomodo hoc in rostro iterum non erit  
Sic mihi dentes non doleant toto anno."

("I say to thee, O swallow,  
As this will never be in thy beak,  
So may my teeth pain me no more for a year.")

 

"And by renewing this annually you may always have sound teeth." All of
which is essentially identical with the modern Tuscan spell.

It is believed in Tuscany that if swallows make nests in a house it
brings good fortune. *Ma guai a distruggerle--perche portarebbe motte
disgrazie*--but beware of disturbing them, for it brings many troubles.

MARCELLUS gives another prescription for the eyes, as follows (p. 11,
GRIMM):--

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

 

"Si muleris saliva, quæ pueros, non puellas ediderit, et abstinuerit se
pridie viro et cibis acrioribus, et imprimis si pura et nitida erit,
angulos oculorum tetigeris, omnem acritudinem lippitudinis lenies,
humoremque siccabis."

 

Which is, that if your eyes pain you, you must take the saliva of a
woman who has given birth only to boys, not girls. And she must have
abstained from sexual union and stimulating food for three days. Then if
her saliva be bright and clear anoint your eyes with it and they will be
cured.

In Italian the cure is as follows:--

 

"If a woman has given birth to a child of seven months, take her saliva
and milk mixed and anoint the eyes with them, saying

"'Bagno gli occhi  
A questa donna,  
Non ne lo bagno  
Col mio sputo,  
Ma lo bagno  
Coll' innocenza  
E la purita,  
Del mio bambino.'

("'I bathe my eyes  
From this woman  
Not with my saliva,  
But I bathe them  
With innocence,  
And the purity  
Of my child.')

"Then make a sign of the cross on the eyes, and say:--

"'Bendetta che tu sia  
Per l'innocenza  
Del mio bambino,  
In tre giorni,  
Possa guarire!'

("'Blest be thou  
By the innocence  
Of my child,  
In three days  
May I recover!')

"Then spit thrice behind you. And this must be repeated three mornings
fasting."

 

There is indeed some confusion in this, as I have given it. But it is
clearly on the whole identical with the spell of Marcellus. In another
prescription, (67, Grimm) Marcellus declares that " Mulier quæ geminos
peperit, renes

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

dolentes super calcet, continuo sanabit," if a woman who has borne twins
will step on the reins when they pain it will cure them." Also very
obscurely in what seems to be a detached fragment to cure the
gout"--Dices *illius* quem peperit *illa*.

 

"Venenum veneno vincitur  
Salva jejuna vinci non potest.

"You must say of that which she has brought forth:--

"'Poison is conquered by poison,  
Fasting spittle cannot be conquered.'

"Say this thrice and spit every time on your soles (footprints) or of
him who is to be cured."

 

Taking them altogether we may say the Roman and modern spells correspond
very generally if not exactly in every detail.

There is also another Tuscan spell for sore eyes, which is as follows:--

 

"Take elder (*zanbueo*, *i.e.*, *sambuco*) and boil it, and with it
bathe the eyes, making thrice the sign of the cross, and say:--

"'Santa Lucia, Santa Lucia,  
Il mal degli occhi  
Gli vada via!'

("'Santa Lucia, to you I pray,  
May the pain in my eyes  
Be driven away!')

"But this must be done by a man or woman who is a seven-months' child."

 

All of these cures for the eyes refer in some way to a woman who has
given birth to only boys or to a seven-months' child. There is yet
another Tuscan remedy allied to these. To cure a pain in the ear go to a
woman who is nursing a seven-months' child, and while the child sucks
thrice, one should put three drops of her milk into the ear of the
sufferer, and say:--

 

Le butto questo latte  
Perche il male del orecchia  
La possa passare!"

 

To return to the swallow in Tuscany, the feathers of this bird are an
amulet as follows --

Quando si vuole una grazia o una fortuna, sono portati, legati con un
nastro rosso--when one desires some favouring fortune they are bound up
with a red ribbon and carried. And for this purpose they are also put
into beds. There is

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

a Roman ballad (Agrumi, Ital. pop. songs) in which the swallow is
addressed as an enchantress.

 

"O rondinella bella  
Tu sei un' incantrice!"

 

The swallow is believed to be good for troubles of the eyes (as was the
lizard), because it is, like it, an emblem of light, or sight. As it was
the herald of spring and of sunshine it was naturally associated with
clear vision. So through all nature ran the golden chain connecting all
things in poetic vein.

#### MINOR CURES FROM MARCELLUS

(*With their modern parallels*)

MARCELLUS informs us (cap. I, p. 35, GRIMM, p. 10) as follows, regarding
headache:--

 

"Cum intrabis urbent quam libet, ante portam capillos qui in via
jacebunt quot volueris collige, dicens: tecum ipse ad capitis dolorem te
remedium tollere, et ex his unum capiti alligato, ceteros post tergum
jacta, nec retro respice."

("When you enter any city, collect before the gate as many hairs as you
will of any which may lie in the road, saying to yourself that you do
this to remove your headache, and bind one of the hairs to your head.
Throw the others away behind you and do not look back.")

 

On inquiry I was assured that this was known to-day in Tuscany, but I
did not find any special variation from it except that salt should be
thrown with the hair. And I incline to think that this was included in
the ancient charm, but was not known to MARCELLUS. Salt was an essential
part, of all ancient offerings and sacrifices (MARK ix. 49). It was
considered as binding and perfecting them.

Very much allied to this is the following, which is still in use:--

 

Whenever hairs are found they should be thrown into the fire, the one
who does this saying:--

"'Se sei anima buona  
Va in pace!  
Se sei una strega,  
Scoppia, che tuoi colpi  
Si sentono da lontano,  
E che il diavolo  
Si possa sentire  
Si possa scatenare  
Per venir' ti te appigliare!'

("'If thou art a good soul  
Go in peace!  
If thou art a witch  
May you burst so that the sound <span id="page_282">p. 282</span>  
May be heard afar!  
May the devil note it  
And burst loose,  
So as to come and catch you.'")

 

Of the use of human hair in spells to do harm I shall speak in another
chapter.

MARCELLUS gives us (cap. 8, 67) a cure for the eyes which is peculiarly
nasty though none the less curious for that:--

 

"Mel Atticum et stercus infantis, quod primum dimittit, statim ex lacte
mulieris, quæ puerum allactat, permiscebis, et sic inunges; sed prius
eum qui curandus est, erectum ad scalam alligabis, quia tanta vis
medicaminis est; ut eam nisi alligatus patienter ferre non possit, cujus
beneficium tam præsens est, ut tertio die, abstersa omni macula,
mirifice visum reddat incolumem."

("Take Attic honey and the first fæces of a babe, mix it with the
mother's milk and anoint (the eyes), but first tie the patient to the
stairs (or a ladder) which is of such medical power, that unless he be
so bound he cannot endure it, the benefit of which will be that on the
third day, all stain being wiped away, the sight will be perfect.")

 

The binding to the ladder or stair is found in the following Tuscan
spell:--

 

"If any one is bewitched, bind him, or his clothes (the latter are
preferred) on a *scala* (stairs or ladder)--but it, or they, must be of
wood; then take a knife, and, while sharpening it, say:--

"'Non lego questa robba  
Ma lego la strega  
Che non abbia più bene!'"

("'I do not bind these things,  
But I bind the witch  
That she may no more have good luck!'")

 

We have here only the binding to the ladder, but a part of one
prescription or charm is often found in another, in MARCELLUS, as well
as in the modern charms. In all these cures the ceremony and the
incantation form by far the most important part, or the *sine qua non
erit remedium*.

MARCELLUS (No. 30, cap. 14, p. 103) gives the following for the
throat:--

 

"Picem mollem cerebro ejus impone, qui uvam dolebit et præcipue ut super
limen stans superiori limiti ipsam picem capite suo adfigat."

("Put a piece of soft pitch on the head of him who suffers from a sore
throat, and especially see that he does this when standing on the outer
edge of the threshold.")

 

In Tuscany much taking of magical medicine is done on the threshold; it
also plays a part in other sorcery. This is because it is the line or
limit between the place inhabited and the outer life where spirits
freely roam, it being an understood law of demonology that they cannot
enter a room until called on. There are evidently, however, numerous
exceptions to the rule, else we should have no hauntings of houses.

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

In chapter 19, page 130, MARCELLUS tells us that--

 

"Serpentis senectus, id est exuviæ licio alligatæ et vulso circumdatæ
mire prosunt." That is, that "a serpent's skin bound to the girdle is of
great assistance."

 

In the Romagna Toscana it is believed that if any one finds a serpent's
skin he must say:--

 

"Ho trovato la pelle  
Di questo serpente,  
Che possa portare  
La fortuna a me;  
Non portero,  
La pelle di serpente,  
Ma portero la buona fortuna,  
Che sia sempre in casa mia."

("I have found the skin  
Of this serpent  
May it bring  
Good luck to me!  
I will not carry  
The skin of the snake,  
But I will bear the good luck  
That it may ever be in my home!")

 

Out of the immense amount of learning which has been collected on the
subject of serpent symbolism one thing is undeniable--that this creature
was, among the Etruscans, Greeks, and Romans, a type of health,
longevity, and fortune. And it is in this sense that it appears, both in
the work of MARCELLUS and in this Tuscan incantation, as a cure or
amulet. I conjecture that there was of yore an incantation pronounced on
finding the skin which was unknown to the Roman physician. For a careful
examination of all these prescriptions or charms, in any form, cannot
fail to convince any one that the *words* were always a *sine qua non*,
and in fact the most important part of all.

As a curious instance of serpent-lore still existing in the Romagna, I
may mention that the picture of a snake is painted on the wall for good
luck or to avert the *malocchio*, but it must always be with the head
down and tail up.

MARCELLUS gives the following:--

 

"Si arista vel quælibet sordicula oculum fuerit ingressa obcluso alio
oculo ipsoque qui dolet patefacto et digitis medicinali ac pollice
leviter pertracto, ter singula despuens dices: *Os Gorgonis basio*. Hoc
item carmen si ter novies dicatur etiam de faucibus hominis vel jumenti
os aut si quid aliud hæserit, potenter eximit.

 

That is, that if a grain or mote be in one eye, close the other one,
draw the middle finger over that which pains, and say, "*I kiss the
Gorgon's face*," Which is

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

repeated thrice, and the charm is so powerful that it will draw a bone
from the throat of a man or of a mare.

In Italian they say:--

 

If anything be in the eye or in the throat of man or beast spit thrice
and say:--

"'O grande Serpente  
Io ti baccio il volto!'

("'O great Serpent  
I kiss thy face!'")

 

To which my informant added, " But you must look on the ground when you
say this."

On referring to MARCELLUS afterwards I found that to remove a small
irritated spot from the eye (*varulus*) you perform a ceremony which
ends by touching the ground thrice and spitting. Of course touching the
ground implies looking at it.

MARCELLUS gives as a cure for sore eyes:--

 

Qui crebo lippitudinis vitio laborabit, millefolium herbam radicis
vellat, et ex ea circulum facit, ut per illum aspiciat, et dicat ter,
'*excicum acrisos*,' et totiens ad os sibi circulum illum admoveat et
per medium exspuat," &c.

 

Which is to the effect that the patient shall pull up a plant of
millefoil or yarrow, make a ring of it and spit thrice through this
ring. And further that the herb shall be planted again, and should it
grow, the patient will recover.

In Tuscany there is for the same complaint a remedy which is perfectly
in accordance with a portion of this. It is called *La Corona della
Ruta*, or the Crown of Rue.

 

"When one suffers with sore eyes take a branch--*coccha*--of rue and tie
it round in a wreath, *in forma di una corona*, with red ribbon. The
patient should be in bed and not see the garland made; it must be always
prepared by a woman in another room, and it must not be seen by children
or even by any animal, and she who binds it must say:--

"'Preparo questa corona  
Per metterla sopra agli occhi  
Di quella ammalata.  
(O ammalato, che sia)  
Che degli occhi possa guarire  
E mal d'occhi non gli possa ritornare.'

("'I prepare this wreath,  
To place it on the eyes  
Of that sufferer,  
That his sight I may restore,  
And he may never suffer more!')

 

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

 

And when she gives it to the invalid he must look through it three
times, and say

"'Santa Lucia, Santa Lucia, Santa Lucia!  
Del mal d'occhio fatemi guarire!'

Then he must spit through it three times."

 

Which is, on the whole, very much the same as the old Roman-Etruscan
formula.

Santa Lucia the modern Catholic saint of light, is probably the direct
descendant of the Etruscan Losna, goddess of the moon, also of the sun.
(*Vide* Losna.)

Our author recommends (cap, 14, p. 100; p. 14, GRIMM) that for the
toothache one should carry "salis granum, panis micam, carbonen mortuum
in phœnicio alligabis" ("A grain of salt, a crumb of bread, a dead coal
tied in red cloth"). In Tuscany quite the same is made up, and borne as
an amulet for health and good luck.

![](img/28500.jpg)  
LOSNA

MARCELLUS also prescribes the use of earthworms--*lumbrici,* or the
*vermis terrenus*--for local pains. In one of these he declares that the
worms are to be put into a bucket or receptacle of wood--if possible,
one hooped with iron--and water poured on them, which is to be drunk. In
Tuscany this is the remedy:--

 

"For one suffering headache take earthworms, also a *litre* of spirits,
and say:--

"'Lombrici che per la terra strisciate,  
Tutte le stregonerie le conoscete,  
Come pure conoscete  
Da me il buon piède;  
Vi prego il buon piède di raccatare  
E dentro allo spirito lo potrete lasciare!'

 

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

 

("'Earthworms who slip through earth below,  
Secrets of sorcery ye know,  
When *the good foot* doth o'er you tread,  
Or when it passes overhead,  
Transfer its power and its merit,  
Now I pray you to this spirit,  
To do such virtue as it may,  
And let this headache pass away!'")

 

(The allusion to the *good foot* is to that of the sorcerers, or persons
possessed of a peculiar power.)

 

"Then in the evening, before the patient goes to bed, he must bathe his
head with the spirit, and say:--

"'Mi bagno it capo  
Collo spirito di lombrici a fare  
Perche it mat di capo mi possa passare!'

"And the next morning the pain will have quite disappeared."

 

I nearly missed this, because my informant did not know the word
*lombrici*, or earthworms, since in Romagnola they are called
*ronbricati*. This very curious incantation explains what MARCELLUS does
not--why earthworms are used. As chthonic creatures, or of darkness,
they are supposed to be familiar with the secrets of the under-world.
The allusion to this, and to the foot of the sorcerer renders it certain
that this is an extremely ancient spell.

MARCELLUS also gives as a cure for headache:--"Hemicranium statem curant
vermes terreni pari numero sinistra manu lecti, cum terra de limine
eadem manu triti" ("Earthworms--an equal number gathered with the left
hand, powdered with earth from the threshold.") This also indicates
that, as in the modern recipe, the same remedy was used for the same
disorder.

I have already alluded to an amulet given by the same writer, consisting
of salt, bread, and a coal in a red bag, or cloth. In another (cap. 8,
p. 63), he speaks of the special virtue of a cure made of *four*
ingredients, "quia ex quatuor rebus constat ut quadriga equis constat,
et celeres effectus habet, barma dicitur." I suspect that his salt, &c.,
in a red bag is imperfect or wanting, because, when the following was
given to me in Italian, something was said about the value of *four*
articles in it.

#### LE QUATTRO COSE DELLA BUONA FORTUNA

"The four things of good fortune. Take a little red bag, and sew it with
red woollen thread-not with silk or cotton; the bag, too, must be of
woollen, and of coarse cloth, and while sewing it, sing:--

 

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

 

"'Chuco, questo sacchetino,  
Per la buona fortuna di me,  
E delta mia famiglia,  
E che ci tenga sempre lontano  
Dalle disgrazie come pure  
Dalle malattie!'"

Then take a crumb (*midolla*) of bread, and a little coarse salt, a
sprig of rue, and some cummin, and keep repeating, while making it up,
the same charm. And when made, the charm must always he borne on the
same person, by night as well as by day."

 

The translation of the incantation is as follows:--

 

"This bag I sew for luck to me,  
And also for my family;  
That it may keep by night or day,  
Troubles and illness far away!"

 

#### LA FORMICOLA    THE ANT

Once when I read a certain prescription from MARCELLUS to a *strega*,
she admired it very much, declaring that she had never heard it before,
or anything like it. It was the following:--

 

"Ad dolorem uvæ scribes in charta, et collo, laborantis in linteolo
suspendes:--

"'Formica sanguen non habet nec fel,  
Fuge uva ne cancer te comedat!'"

("For one suffering from sore throat write on paper the following, and
stick it on the ceiling:--

"'The ant has neither blood nor poison:  
Fly, O pain, lest the crab devour thee!'")

"But," my informant added, "I know of a cure for which ants are used."
It was as follows

When one spits blood, take ants and put them in some of the blood, and
let it stand all night, and say over it:--

"'Butto queste formicole  
Dentro a questo sangue;  
Che questo sangue  
Possano ripigliare.  
E a questo malatto  
La possano riportare,  
Che i suoi pulmoni  
Non si voglione guastare,  
E la ma malattia  
Avanti non possa più andare.'"

 

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

 

("'I put these ants into this blood  
That his may be both well and good  
That he his health may soon regain,  
And his lungs be sound and sain!  
May his trouble soon be o'er,  
And illness trouble him no more!'")

 

MARCELLUS remarks that the ant is a bloodless animal, therefore it is
used to stop bleeding according to a kind of rude and naïf homœopathy,
which continually occurs in magical medicine. As regards my very
indifferent translations into rhyme of these recipes, I beg leave to
inform the reader that though not very good poetry, they will answer
every whit as well as the originals to cure disorders if he wishes to
try them; yea, and that for this purpose they are just as effective as
if they had been made by Lord TENNYSON himself.

#### VERBENA

MARCELLUS recommends *verbena* as a magical cure for a tumour. An
authority in stregoneria hearing this, said: " I do not think it is used
in *medicine*--but," she added with animation, "it is admirable in , and
for a charm." Then she gave me the following, laying stress on the fact
that it must be carried on the person:--

 

"*Verbena* is an herb which brings great good luck, and it must always
be borne upon you. Especially note if an old woman wishes to sell you
some, when she offers it you must never refuse, else she might curse you
(*i.e.,* bewitch you). You must always buy some, and say:--

"'Non compro questa verbena perche e erba,  
Ma compro la fortuna che essa portal'"

("'I buy not this verbena as the herb which here I see,  
I buy it as the fortune which I trust 'twill prove to me!'")

 

My witch was quite in the right when she declared that, Verbena was
admirable in magic and for a charm. Had she known and read Latin she
might have supported her assertion with a great array of classical
authorities. However, she doubtless had a great many more ancestors than
I ever had who could talk Latin, and perhaps the tradition came down in
the family; since she says they were all *stregoni*, or wizards and
witches--always!

The Verbena was called *par éminence* the holy plant--*hiera botane*--by
the Greeks, and it was regarded as holiest of all in sacrifices, where
it was burned especially during invocations of spirits and predictions.
It was the plant of Venus: it gave, as was believed, great power of
procreation, and, above all others--as FRIEDRICH writes--drove away evil
spirits, and destroyed witchcraft and all

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

such influences. Ambassadors carried it as a symbol of peace. "*Semper e
legatis unus utique Verbenarius loquitur*" ("One of a band of legates
was called the Verbena-bearer") (PLINY, *Nat. History*, xxii., 3).

"For there dwelleth in the Verbene a certaine *fata*, or faery, who
bestoweth fortune on those invoking her." Think of this when you smell
Verbena! Also remember that if you take a bit of it from a church it
will bring you good luck: "Ex ara hinc sume verbenas tibi atque eas
substerne" (*Terentius, Andr.*, iv., 4).

Our author gives two remedies for *hordeolis oculorum*--"grains in the
eyes" for both of which he prescribes *nine grains of barley* to be
treated in a magical manner--such as nipping off the points, one by one,
and repeating a Greek incantation every time. In Tuscany I find the
following for the same trouble, or for the eyes":--

 

"Take nine grains of barley, and put them in a black pot with nine
flowers of elder and nine bits of rue. Boil them for a quarter of an
hour, then let it cool till it is tepid. Then dip into it a piece of
linen and lay it on the eyes of the patient, and then take the nine
grains of barley and the elder flower and the rue, and lay them all on
the cloth, and say:--

"'Tutto questo l'ho fatto bollire  
Per mettere sopra agli occhi  
Di questo malato che con la grazia  
Di Santa Lucia prima di tre giorni  
Possa guarire!'"

 

It is worth observing that the modern method is seriously a good remedy
(all except the nine grains of barley), while that of MARCELLUS is mere
rubbish. For a very immoral bewitchment--"Si quem coire noles, fieri que
cupies in usu venerio tardiorem--confestim enervabitur"--MARCELLUS
prescribes nine grains of wheat. I should add that the English version
of what may here be called the tin-pancation--as a black tin pan may be
used--is as follows:--

 

"All of this I have had boiled  
To put upon the eyes,  
Of this poor man--Saint Lucy aid  
And on the third day, by thy aid,  
He will in health arise!'

 

Santa Lucia is the saint of light, therefore of sight. The two were
identified in ancient Roman mythology.

There is a very great resemblance between the cat and the hare when
skinned, also between their skins. This being admitted, with the
addition that MARCELLUS gives several prescriptions in which cats, or
the skins of animals, are employed, we may infer that the following is
not without affinity to an Italian charm.

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

 

"Pellem leporis recentem in olla munda vel tegula ita cum lana sua
combures, ut in tenuissimum pulverem redigere possis, quem cribratum in
vaso nitido servabis inde cum opus fuerit tria cochlearia in potione
dabis bibenda, quæ res sinè calculos sinè vessicæ dolores continuo
compescit."

 

Which is, that for the stone or pains in the bladder you should burn the
fresh skin of a hare in a small pot or on a tile, so as to reduce it *to
the finest powder*, which, when pulverised, you must keep in a clear
(glass) vase, and give the patient three spoonfuls in a drink.

The Italian spell is to bewitch any one, or to do him harm:--

 

"When you would do evil to any one, kill a black cat, skin it and rub
the skin (by burning is, I suppose, understood) to a very, very fine
powder (*si trita fine fine*), and when it is triturated finely to a
powder, mix with it pulverised horse-scrapings and pepper and earth,
over which a toad has passed. And while taking this earth from under the
toad, say:--

"'O rospo, rospo, che siei composto  
Tutto di veleno, del tuo veleno  
Lasciane sparso un poco sopra,  
A questa terra che passo portarlo  
A casa mia.

("'Toad, all poison from thy birth!  
Shed thy poison on this earth!  
Give me of thy poison some,  
That I may bear it to my home.')

Then put all together in a small bag, and at the time of mixing say:--

"'Terra e polvere insieme  
Lo riunite, e polvere di gatto  
E la peggio, ma e la miglio,  
E per me perche mi deve vendicare,  
Polvere di pelle di gatto,  
Con polvere di cavallo,  
E pepe unito a terra di rospo,  
Terra avvelenata e tutto  
Un immischia che molte persone  
Voglio rovinare che non abbiano,  
Più pace e ne bene, fino che  
A me non si vengano  
A racommandare, ed anche all'ora  
Le concedero grazia se mi pare."'

("'Poisoned earth and powder fine  
To the powdered cat I join,  
'Tis the worst, and yet the best  
For my vengeance--for the rest <span id="page_291">p. 291</span>  
Cat skin powdered; naught is worse  
With the scraping of a horse,  
Pepper next, to make it good,  
Earth well poisoned by a toad  
'Tis a mixture which, when done,  
Will rack and ruin many a one,  
And they shall know no good or peace,  
Nor shall their sufferings ever cease,  
Until they humbly come to me  
And beg for mercy on their knees,  
Which I may grant--if I should please.'")

 

Se mi pare! This was chanted *crescendo*, and when the witch came to the
last word her face was infernal--not violent, but serpent-like;
horrible, yet cold. Does this remind the reader of a scene in
SHAKESPEARE'S "Macbeth"? Or is the incantation like his? Not to me, for
his was *poetry* written for the stage, and this was reality--the
witchcraft of old, old times--the spirit of the sorceress who would
kill, the life of necromancy which is death.

I say truly that if I could write all that I have seen in exploring this
Italian witchcraft, few indeed would believe me, and fewer still could
understand it. For it all belongs to a world and a life of which no
cultivated person, whom I ever met, has any comprehension, and for which
he can certainly have no sympathy. When I reflect that GOETHE and HEINE
and BYRON, and I know not how many more poets and great word-artists
have travelled over Italy grasping eagerly at every scrap of magic and
passion and human romance, I wonder *what* they would have thought or
written had they known what was *living* among these people, deep in
their hearts. We may read history for ever, but we can never learn from
it, or from literature--till we get the key to it--what a strange race
was this old Etrusco-Roman!

Under the ashes of Italy there is burning a fire of which only now and
then a spark is seen, but it has never been extinguished any more than
that of Vesuvius. Imagine an English or German peasant woman bursting
out into such spasms of sorcery and poetry--I have known one in Italy,
in reciting an incantation, to be seized with convulsions. And in all
the people, low or high, there is a something which seems to be
repressed--a genius as of stifled art, or magic power--a science which
will yet be manifested when the time comes.

There is a very remarkable prescription in MARCELLUS his book, for a hip
complaint.

It amounts to this: that the remedy must be given to the patient

super scabellum vel sellam ita ut pede uno quem dolet stans ad orientem
versus potionem bibat, et cum biberit saltu desiliat, et ter uno pede
saliat, et hoc per triduum faciat, confestim

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

remedio gratulabitur. That is--"Standing, on a little stool or chair, so
that, one foot being forward, the patient facing the East drinks his
medicine, and then jumps down, and hops three times on one foot, and so
he will be well in three days, time." In another he prescribes a potion
to be taken standing on one foot on the threshold. The chief elements of
this gymnastic performance appear in the following Tuscan spell:--

 

When one takes medicine, one should stand on a stool (*sgabello*), or on
the threshold of a door, and utter:--

"'Prendo questa medicina  
Perche sono ammalato,  
Ma non sono ammalato  
Di fisico, ma da morale,  
Percio prendo questa medicina  
Sopra a questo sgabello  
Che mi possa guarire di questa  
Malattia, e mi voglia  
Dare felicita e bene,  
Percio scendo da questo sgabello,  
E su questo piede sinistro,  
Sempre dallo sinistro piede,  
Per tre volte mi rigiro,  
E per tre volte io chiamo,  
Il gran Salvatore e se ne  
Non mi corrisponde allora,  
Mi rivolgero alle strege,  
Alle strege o ai stregoni.'"

("'I this medicine am taking  
For a sad and serious illness,  
Yet the illness which I suffer  
Is of mind more than of body,  
And I therefore take my physic  
Standing on this stool and hoping  
It may soon relieve my troubles,  
Therefore from this stool descending,  
Now I'm on my left foot standing,  
Ever standing on my left foot,  
And three times I turn upon it,  
Three times calling the great Saviour,  
But if He should give no answer,  
Then I'll turn me to the witches,  
To the witches and the wizards."')

 

Which last lines indicate that devotion to the principle of having two
strings to one's supernatural bow of faith which has enabled witchcraft
to hold its own so well, that it is possible that the *stregone* may
exist as long as the priest--which

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

will not be long, to judge by the spirit which is growing up among the
people. Once the *least* allusion reflecting on the clergy, within my
own memory, was promptly punished and without mercy. Now, as I write,
the last great caricature at every street-corner represents the
departure of the Pope for ever with a gang of disreputable-looking
attendants. It is accompanied with bitterest satire, and ends with the
words, "*A good riddance to bad rubbish!*" *Eppur si muove*. I think
that this incantation is essentially ancient, but very much modernised
in form. The remedy is Roman, but it seems to be in a new bottle.

It is said by MARCELLUS (cap. 28, p. 201) that "*Corregia canina medius
cingatur, qui dolebit ventrem, statimque remediabitur*" ("He who suffers
from a pain in the stomach will be relieved should he girdle himself
with a dog-leash") (that is, a strap of any kind). I rather wonder that
GRIMM should have regarded this as superstition since it is a well-known
fact that a girdle--*e.g.*, a Russian belt--really gives great relief
for such suffering. However, if it was to be done specially with a
dog's-leash, and no other, it was undoubtedly superstitious and that
this was the case may be inferred from the following Tuscan formula:--

 

Take a *funicella del cane*--a rope which binds a dog--and say

"'Prendo questa funicella,  
Che il mio cane legava,  
Attorno alla mia vita,  
Me la voglio passare  
Che il mio male di ventre  
Al cane se ne possa andare,  
Ed a me mai non possa ritomare."'

("'I take the rope which held my hound,  
Now round my life the cord is bound,  
May that which makes my agony  
Pass to the dog away from me,  
And I no more a sufferer be!'")

 

This is quite after the style of several of MARCELLUS'S own
prescriptions, in which he shows how a disorder can be transferred from
a human being to an animal. As in the following (cap. 27, p. 190):--

 

"Tormina patientibus multi ventrem viventis anatis adponunt ad
firmantes, transire morbum ad anatem, eamque mori."

("To those suffering from a colic. Let them fasten a live duck to their
stomachs, thus the disease will pass from the man to the duck, and the
duck will die.")

 

This is found in Tuscany with the invariable musical accompaniment of an
incantation:

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

 

"When one suffers from a pain in the stomach take a duck, and the body
of the bird must be placed against that of the invalid, and then say:--

"'Anatra! Anatra!  
Che il male mio tu possa  
Pigliare, e di questo male  
Io ne possa guarire;  
E tu di questa male  
Tu ne possa morire,  
Che a me questo male  
Non mi possa mai ritornare  
Fino che non torni  
Tu a risucitare!'"

("'Duck, duck, so may it be,  
That thou shalt take this pain from me  
That the ill depart, and!  
Shall get well, while thou must die  
And may I never feel the pain  
Till thou shalt have thy life again!'")

 

Which was bad for the duck. However, this went for very little with a
physician, one of whose most vaunted cures was to put a patient *in
balneo repleta a humano sanguine*--in a bath full of human blood. Such a
bath of the blood of young children was once ordered for the Emperor
Constantine, and because he, being moved by the cries and tears of their
mothers, resolved not to take it, his extraordinary humanity was
rewarded by a miraculous cure. As related by the early chroniclers, this
seems to have been regarded--even by Christians--as a great act of mercy
and magnanimity. It does not seem to be at all understood that for
several centuries after the decay of the Roman power the world relapsed
as regards barbarism and inhumanity, instead of advancing with
Christianity as is popularly believed.

MARCELLUS gives the following as means by which fidelity may be secured
in a woman:--

 

"Mulierum, quam tu habueris ut nunquam alius inire possit, facies hoc:
lacertæ viridis vivæ sinistra manu caudem curtabis eamque vivum
dimittes, caudem donec inmoriatur eadem palma clausam tenebis, et
mulierem, verendaque ejus dum cum ea cois, tange."

The Tuscan recipe, though very different in details, is quite the same
as regards the principal item, that is, the lizard caught with the left
hand:--

 

"When a man wishes his wife to be faithful, he should take *sperma
illius mulieris* and put it in a bottle, and then catch a lizard with
the left hand, and put it in the same bottle, and cork both up very
tightly, and say:--

 

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

 

"'Qui racchiudo la fedelta  
Di mia moglie che non possa  
Mai sfugirmi!'

("'Here I put the fidelity  
Of my wife, that she may be  
Ever, ever true to me!')

Then be careful not to lose the bottle, and always to keep it in the
house."

 

I do not clearly understand for what complaint MARCELLUS means the
following prescription--*nisi ad verrucas*--but I give it, according to
GRIMM:--

 

"De tribus tumulis terræ, quos talpæ hiciunt, ter sinistra manu quot
adprehenderis tolles, hoc est novem pugnos plenos, et aceto addito,
temperabis."

("Take from three mole-hills three handfuls of earth thrice, that is,
nine handfuls, and mix them with vinegar.")

 

The following is a Romagnola charm for bewitching or injuring any one:--

 

La Terra dei Mucchi delle Tarpe (Talpi).

"Take earth from three mole-hills and put it in a red bag, and while
removing the earth say:--

"'O terra che di terra vi racatto,  
Sopra tre mucchi che dalle tarpe siete stati ammuchiati,  
E come avete ammuchiato questa terra  
Ammuchiate i dispiacere di quella famiglia  
Che non abbiano bene e ni pace  
E tutte le sfortune piombino sopra al suo capo!

("'Earth, O Earth, who long hast laid  
On the hills which moles have made,  
As they heaped thee, may there be  
Evil heaped on this family  
And disaster fall like lead  
Evermore upon its head!'")

 

I could almost believe that MARCELLUS has misplaced this spell, in
applying it to a cure. For, as my authority explained, " the mole lives
in darkness, and, like the earthworm, is under the footprints of the
*stregone*, or wizards, which give it power for good or evil according
to their natures, but it is generally most powerful for bewitching." In
saying which she gave in a few words a great amount of classic folk-lore
unawares. FRIEDRICH (*Symbolik*, p. 386) writes on this as follows:--

"As the mole is subterranean he has a chthonic, demoniac reputation, as
of one hostile to man, which is to be found in such old Roman beliefs
as, 'If you

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

throw a mole into a house the grandmother will die.' To this might be
added several to the effect that by means of it disaster can be wrought
to a family, especially to its head." <span
id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36) It was of yore much used in sorcery. Thus,
according to PLINY (Hist. Nat., xxx., 7):--

 

"He who will swallow the heart of a mole, still quivering, will receive
the gift of prophecy; a mole, tooth pulled from the living animal cures
toothache, its blood cures weakly persons."

 

I was not aware of this when the Tuscan spell was given to me, but I can
now understand why so much stress was laid upon its force in magic. It
has its value as illustrating the recipe of MARCELLUS, but is much more
interesting as setting forth the old Roman superstitions regarding the
mole. The very ancient use of pitch in superstitious practices appears
in the following from MARCELLUS, which I here repeat for another
illustration:--

 

"Picem mollem cerebro ejus impone, qui uvam dolebit et præcipue ut super
limen stans superiori limiti ipsam picem capite suo adfigat."

("Stick a piece of soft pitch to the head of a man suffering with sore
throat, and this should by all means be done when he is standing on the
threshold.")

 

In a Tuscan incantation to break love, pitch appears in its very ancient
signification as an ingredient of witchcraft:--

 

"When you wish to prevent a young man from visiting a girl in any house,
take shoemaker's wax (*pece da calzolai*) and four nails. Make of these
a cross, and put such crosses under the seats whereon the lover and maid
sit. And the end will be that they will quarrel, and he will no more
come to the house."

 

The last spell, or recipe, Of MARCELLUS is to cure the gout:--

 

"Carmen idioticum, quod lenire podagram dicitur sic: In manus tuas
exspues, antequam a lecto terram contingas, et a summis talis et plantis
ad summos digitos manus duces et dices:--

"'Fuge, fuge, podagra, et omnibus nervorum dolor,  
De pedibus meis et omnibus membris meis!'

"Aut si alii præcantas, dices illius quem peperit illa:--

"'Venenum veneno vincitur  
Saliva jejuna vinci non potest.'

"Ter dices haec et ad singulas plantas tuas, vel illius, cui medebere,
spues."

 

This is, in brief, spit in your hands before rising in the morning, pass
your hands from your soles to the ends of your fingers, and say:--

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

 

"'Fly, fly, O gout, and all my nervous pains  
From both my feet, nor linger in my veins!'

"Or if you chant it for another, say of that which she bore:--

"'Poison by poison is conquered,  
Fasting spittle cannot be conquered.'

"Say this thrice and spit an your soles, or on those of the one whom you
would cure."

 

There is in Tuscany a very terrible illness, caused, as some say, by
eating bad maize-meal, others attribute it to bad living and malaria. It
is called *la pellagra*. As the name very much resembles *podagra*, or
gout, I was told that the following was a cure for *pellagra*, to which
my informant added, *anche per a gotta*--also for gout--which latter
complaint I need not say is not so common among temperate peasants. *La
pellagra* causes madness.

 

"Per guarire la gotta o la pellagra. To cure gout or *pellagra*. Take
for three mornings a small boy (*bambino*) while fasting, and make him
spit three times on the place where the gout shows itself, and while
doing this let him say:--

"'Gotta, o gotta! (*o pellagra*!)  
Va via dal mio piede,  
Il veleno vince il veleno,  
Come pure lo sputo  
Vince il veleno, e  
Lo sputo mio d'un bambino  
Innocente sara quello  
Che vincera la gotta maladetta,  
Che non torni mai più  
A fare capo sopra alla tua persona.'

("'Gout, O gout, to thee I say,  
Go thou from my foot away!  
As poison conquers poison, see  
This infant's spittle conquers thee!  
That thou shalt ne'er return again,  
And give me any further pain!')

Then the boy must spit behind him thrice, and repeat this for three
mornings."

 

Of the one hundred medical spells described by MARCELLUS, and commented
on by J. GRIMM, I have identified about fifty, with as many still in use
in Tuscany. And if we consider that in this collection of the Roman
physician there are a great many which run, so to speak, into one
another, and how much there is in them all which is to be found in many
of the modern Tuscan spells. such as the not looking behind, and
spitting thrice, and, in fact, the whole system, spirit, and method of
the cures, we should not be far from the truth in saying that probably

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

all are still in existence, and that, beyond all question, a very great
number, which were old in his day, are still extant. But a general
consideration and comparison of all the ancient and modern examples
given in this book will best enable the reader to judge of its value.

As a comment on this chapter Miss Mary A. Owen adds the following notes
drawn from American negro sorcery:--

 

"VOODOO

"Voodoos; warn against throwing hairs about, for if a bird gets a hair
and weaves it into a nest the owner of the hair will have frightful
headaches--nothing can cure until the hair is found and burned. Also, if
a person gets the hair of another and introduces it into a slit in the
bark of a growing tree, the unfortunate will go crazy as soon as the
bark grows together over the hair." \[Also Hungarian gypsy. C. G. L.\]

"You may call a friend to your presence from the ends of the earth by
putting four of your own hairs in a bottle of water, calling the bottle
by the name of the one you wish to see, and placing it in the door you
wish him to enter. Within four days (for in that time the hairs will
have swelled into snakes) he must start towards you.

"The skin of the serpent worn around the waist cures rheumatism. The
rattles worn in the hat cure headache and prevent sunstroke. The heart
swallowed whole cures consumption.

"To cure sore eyes, bathe them in water containing the gall of a duck
and a spoonful of syrup made of boiled water-melon juice.

"A black hen split open and placed on the body cures fevers and relieves
the pain of cancer.

"The right fore-foot of a mole is a good-luck charm. The brains of a
mole put in a black silk bag and tied round the neck of a babe will make
it cut its teeth without pain or fever. If the gums of a teething child
are rubbed with a mole's foot the teeth will at once appear.

"The brains of a rabbit tied in a black bag and rubbed on the child's
gums will bring the teeth through, so also will a necklace of elder
twigs.

"If a child under a year old is allowed to see itself in a
looking-glass, it will cut its teeth 'hard'; but this may be prevented
by tying a mole's foot above the glass."

 

#### THE THREE WISE MEN OF THE EAST AND THE WITCH MEDALS

"Die heil'gen drei Kön'ge aus Morgenland  
Sie frugen in jedem Städtchen;  
'Wo geht der Weg nach Bethlehem,  
Ihr lieben Buben und Mädchen?'"  
                                   HEINE,

Buch der Lieder

There appeared in the Gypsy-Lore journal of January, 1889, a very
interesting article by DAVID MACKITCHIE, in which he discussed an old
opinion that the Magi, or Three Kings of the East, were often held to
be, as LONGFELLOW describes them, "the three gypsy kings, Gaspar,
Melchoir, and Balthasar." This may have been a mere popular fancy; but
there is abundant evidence to prove that, whether

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

of Indian or other Eastern blood, there was in all probability a great
deal to connect them with gypsies as regards their lore.

If the three kings were Magi, or Wise Men from the East, we may conclude
that they were of the Chaldæan, or Persian, order, of which there were
many at a late date roaming about the Latin empire. They were all
soothsayers, or diviners, and it was in this capacity that they appear
in Bethlehem. That is, they were of the old Chaldæan-Accadian school of
sorcery, which I believe to have possibly had a common Turanian origin
with that of the Etruscans, which still survives but little changed in
the sorceries of the Tuscan Romagna; and both of these were the same
with the Shaman magic of the pre-Aryan dwellers in India. Reduced to
facts, it is more than merely possible that the "wisdom," or lore, of
the three kings was "Gypsy" (that is, Indian or Persian), or perhaps
Chaldee, in its origin, and that they were really itinerant diviners or
soothsayers.

This is not much more than conjecture-albeit there are "guesses good and
bad." But a very curious incident casts a strange side-light upon it. In
Hungary I have known gypsies, when a child was very ill, to seek to cure
it by hanging from its neck Maria Theresa dollars. In the Romagna of
Tuscany there is an ancient belief that certain old Roman coins are a
sure defence against witchcraft, especially for children. To combat this
the priests have made certain medals, which, like the older articles,
pass current under the name of witch-medals--"*medaglie delle streghe*."

I noted down in conversation the following remarks in relation to
them:--

 

"'Quando si ha una medaglia delle streghe, e si mette questa medaglia al
collo, con questa sara sempre libero delle streghe' ('When one has a
witch-medal, and wears it on the neck, one will be always free from
witches').

"These medals are put *chiefly on children*, but also on grown persons.
And when putting one on, one should say:--

"'*Metto questa medaglia per liberare liberamus delle streghe*' put on
this medal to free--*liberamus*--from witches')."

 

On asking if those who believed in " the old religion," or "witchcraft,"
put faith in the new witch-medals, I received an account which I did not
note down, but which was to the effect that the Catholics believed in
the old witch-coins, or in witchcraft--avendone avuto multe cose
giustificate--"as many things had proved it to them." And that the
believers in witchcraft accepted the new medals, exceptionally for
certain reasons, as agreeing with sorcery. For "*si portano queste
medaglie perche le tre rege sulla faccia erano stessi grande streghone*"
("They carried them because the three kings on them were themselves
great wizards").

I subsequently received some of these new medals, They are sold for a
soldo,

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

or halfpenny. are octagonal, and made of brass, and bear on one side the
three kings worshipping the infant Jesus, and on the other the following
inscription:--

 

![](img/30000.jpg)

 

The reputation of sorcery hung about the Magi, and the believers in
witchcraft accepted them as friends. It was a happy thought to put them
on the new witch-money--it was "acceptable to all parties." I have,
however, heard from a Catholic, that this compromise of saints with the
devil caused a scandal among true believers. It might be here remarked
that this mysterious group of the three magicians was by no means
unknown long before in different forms and under other names to both
Christians and heathens, and that in later lore the three fairies who
appear at the birth of a child not only present him with gifts but
predict his future. It is also noteworthy that *frankincense*, which
formed one of the gifts of the Magi, enters into the composition of all
the modern witch-charms or fetish-bags of the Romagna--I myself having
been presented with one containing some--that myrrh is also one of these
magic medicines, and that if the offering to the infant Jesus had any
meaning at all, it was magical, and intended to avert sorcery and evil
influences. It may be alleged that the Tuscans borrowed this use of
incense from the rites of the Roman Catholic Church; but even Cardinal
Newman himself would hardly have denied that incense was used in sacred
rites by the old Romans. And I am confident that a fair and full
examination of all that I shall give, as regards this Tuscan witch-lore,
will convince any unprejudiced reader that it is of very great
antiquity. For though superstitions spring up spontaneously and
simultaneously, everywhere and everywhen, yet this very fact, on due
reflection, does but go the further to prove, firstly, the vast probable
antiquity of all widely-spread beliefs or legends, and, secondly, the
likelihood that they were *transmitted* from man to man, since he who
has the innate impulse to create will be the readiest to receive--a
great truth much ignored by those who incline to one side or the other,
but especially by those who believe there has been little or no
"borrowing." If it be true that the use of frankincense as a
"devil-driver" would occur *per se* and naturally to an old Italian, or
to a Hindoo, so much the greater is the probability

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

that if one brought it to the other, the other would accept it
Therefore, while we admit that instances of spontaneous creation of
myths, legends, and customs, *may*, and do, take place, yet, when we
consider how extensively men have travelled, even in prehistoric
times--as is shown by jade relics--and with what incredible rapidity
even a rumour will spread over an empire, and, finally, what a
remarkably story-telling and myth-mongering creature man is, it becomes
evident that all conjectures as to simultaneous creation from concurrent
causes must be accepted with the greatest possible caution after the
severest scrutiny. At present the popular tendency is to accept as
self-evident--without proof--the slightest probability that a "use" (be
it in any form) sprung up of itself from "like influences," while
transmission is subjected to the severest criticism. Now, as
transmission may, in millions of cases, have been due to wandering
apostolic pilgrims, who took the whole world for a route, sailors,
strays, and cast-aways--such as the Huron woman who was said to have
been found in Tartary--it is a safe thing to challenge a proof which was
perhaps buried for ever in the grave of some old vagabond thousands of
years ago.

Myrrh, frankincense, and gold combined are an ancient and widely-spread
gift for children. They were magical and luck-bringing among the Romans;
and whatever was connected with superstition, luck, and divination among
them was of Etruscan origin, for their whole body of such beliefs had
been derived from the fabled Tages.

There is another kind of witch-money which is very mysterious indeed, It
is called La Sega delle Strege, or the Witches' Saw. I give a
description of it, as taken down *verbatim*:--

 

"The Sega della Strege is a small coin which witches have. They go with
this on Tuesdays or Fridays to the roads to cut or scrape the earth from
footprints of people. With the coin they remove the earth, and with it
they do great harm" (*i.e.*, to those people).

The spell against the Saw of the Witches--*Sega mulega*--is mentioned in
the song

"'Sega mulega stregone e strege di Gaeta,  
Che filano la seta.'

"*Mulega* is a witches' word. It means the earth which they take with it
from footprints. It signifies that it is not earth which they cut but a
piece of flesh which will disappear from the soles of their feet.

"If any one suspects that he has been thus bewitched, let him stand
quite naked and take a black or red ribbon. Then let him be measured
with the ribbon, firstly, the entire extent of his outstretched arms,
and then his height from head to foot.

 

This song of Sega mulega is a very common nursery rhyme, sung while
making the "cat's cradle " with a twine, which suggests the measurement
with the

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

ribbon. But it is also closely allied to witchcraft even in this; for as
the cord makes a coffin, or other figures, omens are drawn from it, as I
had fully illustrated to me by seeing it done. It is a nursery rhyme
now, but it was an incantation once; and a witch declared to me that, if
properly understood, it is one now, and must be sung while divining with
a cord. It is in full as follows:--

 

"Sega mûlega, stregoni e streghe di Gaeta!  
Che filano la seta  
La seta ed il bombaggio;  
Mi piace quel giovane  
Che sbatte le castagne  
L'isbatte tanto forte alle streghe,  
Fa tremare le porte;  
Le porte sono d'argento,  
Che pesano cinque cento  
Cinque cento, cinquanta,  
La mia gallina canta -----'  
'Non era gallina che canta.'  
'Ma e un gallo ------' 'Non e un gallo che canta,  
Ma una strega senza fallo.'  
'Se una strega é, una strega pur sia!  
Ma che il diavolo la porti via!"

("*Sega mulega*!  
Wizards and witches of Gaeta  
Ye who spin silk and cotton--see  
There is a youth who pleases me,  
He who is beating the chestnut tree:  
Beating the witches with terrible shocks,  
The gates are trembling at his knocks!  
The gates are of silver--five hundred they weigh,  
Five hundred------fifty--is it so?  
Five hundred and fifty------ I hear my hen crow------  
'But 'tis a cock!' 'No--a hen--without doubt,  
And, as surely, a witch, without.'  
'If she's a witch, a witch let her be  
But the devil may take her away for me!")

 

Whether this be a nursery song, or old incantation, there is certainly
in it a wild uncanny "Northern" spirit, far surpassing that of the
"*Ghurughiu*" witch-song which Goethe heard in Naples.
