<p align="CENTER">(1957)</p> 
<p>1. Meditation or concentration, actually by the firm knowledge that you can and will succeed -- forming a clear picture in your mind or your requirements.</p> 
<p>2. Trance states, Clairvoyance, Projection of the Astral etc.</p> 
<p>3. Drugs, Wine, Incense.</p> 
<p>4. Dance, Performing Rites with a purpose.</p> 
<p>5. Chants, Spells etc.</p> 
<p>6. Blood control (Cords etc), Breath control.</p> 
<p>7. Scourge</p> 
<p>8. The Great Rite</p> 
<p>N.B.</p> 
<p>The great thing is to combine as many of these paths into the one operation. No 1 must be in all -- for if you have no clear picture of what you wish and no certainty you will not succeed -- 'tis useless. No</p> 
<p>2 can be combined with this easily. Nos 3, 4, and 5 are all good preliminaries- also 6 and 7; but No 3 is dangerous and therefore if possible should be avoided, except for incense, which is harmless if too much is not used.</p> 
<p>The best combination is Nos. 1, 4, 5 and 7, for small purposes, with no 8 if great force is necessary. Also a combination of 1, 6 and 7 is good if more can not be done; this if properly performed leads to No. 2.</p>
