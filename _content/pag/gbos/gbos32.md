# The Eightfold Path or Ways.

\(1957\)

1\. Meditation or concentration, actually by the firm knowledge that you
can and will succeed -- forming a clear picture in your mind or your
requirements.

2\. Trance states, Clairvoyance, Projection of the Astral etc.

3\. Drugs, Wine, Incense.

4\. Dance, Performing Rites with a purpose.

5\. Chants, Spells etc.

6\. Blood control (Cords etc), Breath control.

7\. Scourge

8\. The Great Rite

N.B.

The great thing is to combine as many of these paths into the one
operation. No 1 must be in all -- for if you have no clear picture of
what you wish and no certainty you will not succeed -- 'tis useless. No

2 can be combined with this easily. Nos 3, 4, and 5 are all good
preliminaries- also 6 and 7; but No 3 is dangerous and therefore if
possible should be avoided, except for incense, which is harmless if too
much is not used.

The best combination is Nos. 1, 4, 5 and 7, for small purposes, with no
8 if great force is necessary. Also a combination of 1, 6 and 7 is good
if more can not be done; this if properly performed leads to No. 2.
