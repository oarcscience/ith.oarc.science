<p>ALL ARE PURIFIED</p> 
<p>[1] Magus consecrates salt and water.</p> 
<p>[2] High Priestess kneels at Altar, takes up Sword, says, "I conjure thee, O Sword of Steel, to serve me as a defence in all Magical Operations. Guard me at all times against mine enemies, both visible and invisible. Grant that I may obtain what I desire in all things wherein I may use Thee, Wherefore do I bless Thee and invoke Thee in the names of Aradia and Cernunnos." Gives Sword to Magus.</p> 
<p>[3] Magus kneeling hands her vessel of consecrated Water and Aspergillum. He Casts the Circle, three circles, on the lines marked out, starting at the East and returning to the East. High Priestess follows, Asperging Circle (sprinkling it to purify it) and all present and finally herself. Then she goes round again censing it. (Everyone in the circle must be sprinkled and censed.) She returns vessel, etc., to Magus, who places them on altar, or convenient place, and hands her Sword [handwritten].</p> 
<p>[4] She walks slowly round Circle, saying, "I conjure Thee, O Circle of Space, that thou be a Boundary and a Protection and a meeting place between the world of Men and that of the Dread Lords of the OUTER SPACES, that Thou be cleansed, Purified, and strengthened to be a</p> 
<p>Guardian and a Protection that shall preserve and contain THAT POWER which we so earnestly desire to raise within thy bounds this night, wherefore do I bless thee and entreat thee to aid me in the endeavor, in the names of Aradia and Cernun nos." Hands sword to Magus [handwritten].</p> 
<p>[5] Magus then summons the Mighty Ones as usual.</p> 
<p>[6] High Priestess stands in front of Altar (which may be pushed back for this). High Priestess assumes Goddess position (arms crossed). Magus kneeling in front of her, draws pentacle on her body with Phallus-headed Wand, Invokes (Drawing down the Moon), "I Invoke and beseech Thee, O mighty MOTHER of all life and fertility. 'By seed and root, by stem and bud, by leaf and flower and fruit, by Life and Love, do I invoke Thee' to descend into the body of thy servant and High Priestess (name)." (The Moon hav ing been drawn down, i.e., link established, Magus and all male officers give fivefold kiss; all others bow.)</p> 
<p>[7] High Priestess in Goddess position says, arms crossed,</p> 
<p>"Mother, Darksome and Divine,Mine the Scourge and Mine the Kiss,The Five-point Star of Love and Bliss; Here I charge ye in this Sign. (Opens out Arms to pentacle position)</p> 
<p>Bow before my Spirit bright (All bow) Aphrodite, Arianrhod,Lover of the Horned God, Queen of Witchery and Night.</p> 
<p>Diana, Brigid, Melusine, Am I named of old by men, Artemis and Cerridwen, Hell's dark mistress, Heaven's Queen.</p> 
<p>Ye who ask of me a boon, Meet ye in some hidden shade, Lead my dance in greenwood glade By the light of the full moon.</p> 
<p>Dance about mine altar stone, Work my holy magistry, Ye who are fain of sorcery, I bring ye secrets yet unknown.</p> 
<p>No more shall ye know slavery who tread my round the Sabbat night. Come ye all naked to the rite In sign that ye are truly free.</p> 
<p>Keep ye my mysteries in mirth, Heart joined to heart and lip to lip. Five are the points of fellowship That bring ye ecstasy on Earth.</p> 
<p>No other law but love I know; By naught but love may I be known, And all that liveth is my own: From me they come, to me they go.</p>
