<p>Magus kneels, fills Cup, offers to Witch [she is seated on the altar, holding her athame; Priest kneels before her, holding up the cup].</p> 
<p>Witch, holding Athame between palms, places point in cup.</p> 
<p>Magus: "As the Athame is the Male, so the Cup is the female; so, conjoined, they bring blessedness."</p> 
<p>Witch lays aside Athame, takes Cup in both hands, drinks and gives drink. Magus Holds Paten to Witch, who blesses with Athame, then eats and gives to Eat. It is said that in olden days ale or mead was often used instead of wine. It is said that spirits or anything can be used so long as it has life.</p>
