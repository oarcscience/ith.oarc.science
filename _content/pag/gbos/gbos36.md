# The Witches' Chant or Rune

\(1957\)

Darksome night and Shining Moon, East, then South, then West, then
North, Harken to the Witches Rune: Here come I to call thee forth.

Earth and Water, Air and Fire, Wand and Pentacle and Sword, Work ye unto
my desire, Harken ye unto my word.

Cords and Censer, Scourge and knife, Powers of the Witches Blade, Waken
all ye into life, Come ye as the Charm is made:

Queen of Heaven, Queen of Hell, Horned Hunter of the Night, Lend your
power unto the Spell, Work my will by Magic Rite.

If chant is used to reinforce a work already begun, end with this:

By all the power of land and sea, by all the might of moon and sun,

What is my will- "So mote it be,"What I do say- "It shall be done."
