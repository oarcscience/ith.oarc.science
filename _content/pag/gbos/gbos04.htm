<p>Magus binds Witch as before, but does not blindfold her, and circumambulates with her, proclaims to the four quarters, "Hear, ye Mighty Ones, (name), a duly consecrated Priestess and Witch, is now properly prepared to be made a High Priestess and Witch Queen." Magus now leads her thrice around the circle with the half-running, half-dancing step, halts south of the altar, has the Witch kneel, and ties her down to the altar as before.</p> 
<p>Magus: "To attain this sublime degree, it is necessary to suffer and be purified. Art ready to suffer to Learn?"</p> 
<p>Priestess Witch: "I am."</p> 
<p>Magus: "I prepare thee to take the great oath." </p> 
<p>He strikes three knells on the bell, and again gives the series of three, seven, nine, and 21 strokes with the scourge as before.</p> 
<p>Magus: "I now give thee a new name: _______. [kiss]</p> 
<p>Magus: "Repeat thy new name after me, I, (name), swear upon my mother's womb and by mine Honor among men and among my brothers and sisters of the Art, that I will never reveal to any at all any of the secrets of the Art, except it be to a worthy person, properly prepared, in the center of a Magic Circle, such as I am now in. This I swear by my hopes of Salvation, my past lives, and my hopes of future ones to come, and I devote myself to utter destruction if I break this my solemn oath."</p> 
<p>Magus kneels, placing left hand under her knees and right hand on her head, thus forming magic link.</p> 
<p>Magus: "I hereby will all my power into you." Wills.</p> 
<p>Magus now unties her feet, unties the Cable Tow from the altar, and helps the Witch to her feet.</p> 
<p>Magus: "I hereby sign and consecrate you with the great Magic Sign. Remember how it is formed and you will always recognize it. </p> 
<p>"I consecrate thee with oil." (He anoints her with oil on her womb, right breast, left hip, right hip, left breast, and womb again, thus tracing a point-down pentacle.)</p> 
<p>"I consecrate thee with wine." (He anoints her with wine in the same pattern.)</p> 
<p>"I consecrate thee with my lips" (he kisses her in the same pattern), "High Priestess and Witch Queen."</p> 
<p>Magus now unbinds Witch's hands and removes the cord, saying, "Newly made High Priestess and Witch Queen" [kiss] "you will now use the working tools in turn.</p> 
<p>First, the Magic Sword; with it you will scribe the Magic Circle [kiss]</p> 
<p>"Secondly, the Athame" (Form Circle) [kiss]</p> 
<p>"Thirdly, the White Handled Knife" (use) [kiss]</p> 
<p>"Fourthly, the Wand" (Wave to 4 Quarters) [kiss]</p> 
<p>"Fifthly, the Pentacle" (Show to 4 Quarters) [kiss]</p> 
<p>"Sixthly, the Censer of Incense" (Circle, cense) [kiss]</p> 
<p>"Seventhly, the cords; bind me as I bound you." Witch binds Magus and ties him to Altar.</p> 
<p>Magus: "Learn, in Witchcraft, thou must ever return triple. As I scourged thee, so thou must scourge me, but triple. So where you received 3, return 9; where you received 7, return 21; where you received 9, return 27; where you received 21, return 63." Witch scourges Magus as instructed, 120 strokes total.</p> 
<p>Magus: "Thou hast obeyed the Law. But mark well, when thou receivest good, so equally art bound to return good threefold."</p> 
<p>Witch now unbinds Magus and helps him to his feet. Magus, taking the new Initiate by the hand and holding the Athame in the other, passes once round the Circle, proclaiming at the Four Quarters, "Hear, Ye Mighty Ones, (name) hath been duly consecrated High Priestess and Witch Queen." (Note, if ceremony ends here, close circle with "Hail and farewell." If not go to next degree.)</p>
