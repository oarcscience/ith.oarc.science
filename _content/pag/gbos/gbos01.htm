<p align="CENTER">(1949)</p> 
<p>High Priestess stands in front of Altar, assumes Goddess position (arms crossed). Magus, kneeling in front of her, draws pentacle on her body with Phallus-headed Wand, invokes, "I Invoke and beseech Thee, O mighty Mother of all life and fertility. By seed and root, by stem and bud, by leaf and flower and fruit, by Life and Love, do I invoke Thee to descend into the body of thy servant and High Priestess [name]." The Moon having been drawn down, i.e., link established, Magus and other men give Fivefold Kiss:</p> 
<p>(kissing feet) "Blessed be thy feet, that have brought thee in these ways";</p> 
<p>(kissing knees) "Blessed be thy knees, that shall kneel at the sacred altar";</p> 
<p>(kissing womb) "Blessed be thy womb, without which we would not be";</p> 
<p>(kissing breasts) "Blessed be thy breasts, formed in beauty and in strength";</p> 
<p>(kissing lips) "Blessed be thy lips, that shall speak the sacred names."</p> 
<p>Women all bow.</p> 
<p>If there be an initiation, then at this time the Magus and the High Priestess in Goddess position (Arms Crossed) says the Charge while the Initiate stands outside the circle.</p>
