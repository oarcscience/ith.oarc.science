<p>For the Word of God, signifies that Divine truth may be received. This is evident from the signification of "the Word of God," as being Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4692, 5075, 9987). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="52.">52.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And for the testimony of Jesus Christ, signifies that the Lord's Divine Human may be acknowledged. This is evident from the signification of "testimony," as being acknowledgment in heart (see above, n. 10, 27); and from the signification of the names "Jesus" and "Christ," as being the Lord in respect to His Divine Human (see also above, n. 26). These things are said concerning the church of the Gentiles, which is about to receive Divine truth and acknowledge the Lord's Divine Human. (That these things are said of the church of the Gentiles, see just above, n. 50.) The Christian church indeed, acknowledges the Lord's Divine, but not His Divine Human; when, therefore, they think and speak about the Lord from doctrine, they separate His Human from the Divine, and make His Human like the human of another man; when yet the Divine is in His Human as the soul is in the body. This is why such as these can have no idea of the Divine; although it is the idea that conjoins, because thought conjoins; and moreover, without conjunction with the Divine through thought and affection, or what is the same, through faith and love, there is no salvation. It is said that conjunction through thought and affection is the same as conjunction through faith and love, since what I believe, that I think, and what I love, by that I am affected. To believe in the invisible is much the same as believing in the inmost of nature, an error to which the mind readily lapses when it indulges in its own phantasies. Yet there is implanted within everyone, from heaven, and this by continual influx therefrom, a desire to see what he regards as the Divine, and this, indeed, under the human form. [2] This desire is implanted in the simpleminded, and also with well-disposed Gentiles (see the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 82). All such therefore, if they have also lived a life of charity, are received by the Lord, and heaven is granted them. No others can be received, because they are not conjoined. (That all angels in heaven, also the most wise in ancient times, and all who have spiritual faith, that is, a living faith, both on this earth and on all the earths in the universe, see their Divine in thought, because they acknowledge the Divine Human, and are therefore accepted by the Lord, see Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 280-310; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 79-86, 316, 321; and in the small work on The Earths in the Universe, n. 7, 40, 41, 65, 68, 91, 98, 99, 107, 121, 141, 154, 158, 159, 169.) Because this implanted desire, which is in everyone from heaven, has been almost wholly rejected among the learned of the world, and access to the Divine thereby debarred, therefore, a new church is now being established by the Lord, among the Gentiles that have not extirpated that idea, and faith along with it. The extirpation from the Christian world of this implanted desire had its first beginning with the Babylonish body, which separated the Lord's Human from His Divine, in order that its chief might be acknowledged as the vicar of the Lord's Human, and might thus transfer to himself the Lord's Divine power, saying that the Lord received that power from the Father, when in fact it was from Himself, because it was from His Divine. Thus they are unwilling to hear anything about the Divine Human (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4738). But on this subject, as it is the chief thing of all things in the church, more will be said hereafter. </p>

<p>Verse 10. I was in the spirit, signifies a spiritual state when there is revelation. This is evident from the signification of "to be in the spirit," as being to be brought into the state in which spirits and angels are, which state is a spiritual state. Into this state a man is brought when he is let into the state of his spirit, for every man is a spirit as regards his interiors (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 432-444). When a man is in that state, the things that are in the spiritual world appear to him as clearly as objects appear in the natural world; but the things that appear, because they are of spiritual origin, are in themselves spiritual, and such things as are of heavenly wisdom are presented as it were in a natural image. In this way Divine things are presented before the eyes of spirits and angels in visible forms. From this it is that all things that are seen in heaven are representative and significative, as were also the things seen by John, as described in Revelation. (The character of such things can be further learned from what is said and shown concerning Representatives and Appearances in Heaven, in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 170-176.) [2] While man is in the body he does not see such things as are in heaven, unless the sight of his spirit is opened; when this is opened, then he sees. In this way John saw the things described in Revelation; and in like manner the prophets saw; and they were therefore called Seers, and were said to have their eyes opened. In this way also angels were seen in ancient times, and the Lord also was thus seen by the disciples after His resurrection. This sight is the sight of the spiritual man; and because in this state all things appear representatively, John was in it. He who knows nothing about this sight, believes that angels, when seen by men, have taken on a human form, and that when they vanished from their sight they laid it aside; but this is not so; angels then appeared in their own form, which is the human form, not before the sight of men's bodily eyes, but before the sight of their spirit, which sight was then opened. This is evident from the Lord's being seen by the disciples [after His resurrection], when He Himself showed to them that He was a man in a complete human form (Luke 24:39; John 20:20-28); and yet He became invisible. When they saw Him the eyes of their spirit were opened, but when He became invisible those eyes were closed. That man has such a sight is clear to me from much experience, for all things I have seen in the heavens have been seen by that sight. At such times I was in the same state of wakefulness as when they were not seen. But at the present time that sight is seldom opened to anyone by the Lord, and for many reasons. </p>

<p>On the Lord's day, signifies Divine influx then. This is evident from the signification of "the Lord's day," as being then the Lord is instructing man, thus when He is flowing in. The Lord's day is the day of the Sabbath, and the Sabbath in the ancient churches, which were representative churches, was the most holy thing of worship, because it signified the union of the Divine and the Human in the Lord, and thence also the conjunction of His Divine Human with heaven (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8494-8495, 10356, 10360, 10370, 10374, 10668). But when the Lord had united His Divine with His Human that holy representative ceased, and that day became a day of instruction (n. 10360). For this reason revelation was made to John on the Lord's day. Revelation here is instruction concerning the state of the church. </p>

<p>And I heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, signifies manifest perception of Divine truth about to be revealed from heaven. This is evident from the signification of "hearing," as being to perceive and obey (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2542, 3869, 4653, 5017, 7216, 8361, 8990, 9311, 9397); and from the signification of "behind me," as being manifestly (of which hereafter); and from the signification of "voice," when heard out of heaven, as being Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia n. 219-220, 3563, 6971, 8813, 8914); and from the signification of a "trumpet," as being truth to be revealed out of heaven (of which hereafter). "Behind me" signifies manifestly, because the things that flow in from heaven into man's affection flow in into the occipital region, and come thus into his manifest perception; for whatever enters into affection is manifestly perceived, for the whole life of perception is from affection; but whatever flows out of heaven immediately into the thought flows into the region above the forehead. (Concerning this influx, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 251.) From this it is clear what is signified by John's having heard "behind him," and by his afterwards "having turned to see the voice which spoke with him." A "trumpet" or "horn" signifies Divine truth about to be revealed out of heaven, because sometimes Divine truth is heard in this way when it flows down from the Lord through the heavens with man; for it is increased in coming down; and it thus flows in. But it is thus heard only in the beginning with those through whom Divine truth is to be revealed in the ultimate sense, which is representative of interior things. But afterwards it is heard as a human voice. From this it is evident why "the voice of a trumpet" or "horn" signifies Divine truth about to be revealed out of heaven. [2] He who is aware that "trumpet" or "horn," signifies Divine truth out of heaven can understand many passages in the Word where these are mentioned. As in Matthew:      He shall send forth His angel, with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the elect from the four winds (Matt. 24:31). In Isaiah:      All ye inhabitants of the world, and ye dwellers on the earth, when the sign of the mountains shall be lifted up, see ye; and when the trumpet is blown, hear ye (Isa. 18:3). In Jeremiah:      Proclaim with the trumpet in the land. Set up a standard towards Zion. How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? For my people are foolish, they are sottish sons, and they have no understanding (Jer. 4:5-6, 21-22). In the same:      I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. Therefore hear, ye nations (Jer. 6:17-18). In Ezekiel:      He heard the sound of the trumpet, and took not warning; his blood shall be upon him; whereas if he had taken warning he should have delivered his soul (Ezek. 33:5). In Hosea:      [Set] the trumpet to thy mouth, because they have transgressed My covenant, and trespassed against My law (Hos. 8:1). In Zechariah:      The Lord Jehovih shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with the whirlwinds of the south (Zech. 9:14). In David:      God is gone up with a shout, and Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet (Ps. 47:5). And also in Revelation (chap. 4:1; 8:2, 7-8, 13; 9:1, 13, 14; 10:7; 18:22). Because a "trumpet" signified Divine truth, therefore when Divine truth was first about to be revealed before the people of Israel:      Sounds of a trumpet were heard from Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:16). For this reason sounding the trumpet became representative with them:      When they were to assemble, and when they went forward, and also in their solemnities, at the beginnings of months, at burnt-offerings and eucharistic sacrifices (Num. 10:1-10).      They also sounded trumpets when they went forth to battle against the Midianites (Num. 31:6).      And when they took the city of Jericho (Josh. 6:4-20); for wars and battles signified spiritual combats, which are combats of truth against falsity, and of falsity against truth. </p>

<p>Verse 11. Saying, I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, signifies who governs all things from first principles through ultimates, and thus all things of heaven to eternity, as is evident from what is said and shown above (n. 41). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="57.">57.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And, what thou seest write in a book, signifies that the things revealed may be for posterity, as is clear without explanation. </p>

<p>And send to the churches which are in Asia, signifies and then to all who are in the light of intelligence. This is evident from the signification of "the seven churches," as being all who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity, thus who are of the church (see above, n. 20); and from the signification of "Asia," as being those who are in the light of intelligence (see also above, n. 21). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="59.">59.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Unto Ephesus, and Smyrna, and Pergamum, and Thyatira, and Sardis, and Philadelphia, and Laodicea, signifies in each case according to reception. This is evident from what follows, where these churches are treated of in detail. It is said according to reception, because the light of intelligence does not constitute the church with man, but the reception of light in heat, that is, the reception of truth in good. It is said the reception of light in heat, because spiritual light is Divine truth, and spiritual heat is Divine good, and these two in the spiritual world are as light and heat in the natural world; for insofar as spring or summer heat is added to the light, so far all things grow and germinate, but so far as that heat is not added to the light, so far all things become torpid and die. (That light in the spiritual world is Divine truth, and heat there is Divine good, and that they are as heat and light in the natural world, see the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126-140.) </p>

<p>Verses 12-16. And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me. And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle. And His head and hairs white as white wool, as snow; and His eyes as a flame of fire. And His feet like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace; and His voice as the voice of many waters. And having in His right hand seven stars; and out of His mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth; and His face as the sun shineth in his power. 12. "And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me" signifies the understanding illustrated (n. 61); "and having turned I saw seven golden lampstands," signifies a new heaven and a new church, which are in the good of love (n. 62). 13. "And in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man," signifies the Lord, from whom is the All of heaven and of the church (n. 63); "clothed with a garment down to the foot," signifies Divine truth proceeding from Him (n. 64); "and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle," signifies Divine good likewise (n. 65). 14. "And His head and hairs white," signifies His Divine in firsts and in ultimates (n. 66); "as white wool, as snow," signifies in respect to good and truth therein (n. 67); "and His eyes as a flame of fire," signifies Divine Providence from His Divine Love (n. 68). 15 "And His feet like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace, signifies the ultimate of Divine order, which is the natural [full of Divine Love] (n. 69, 70); "and His voice as the voice of many waters," signifies Divine truth in ultimates (n. 71). 16. "And having in His right hand seven stars," signifies all knowledges of good and truth from Him (n. 72); "and out of His mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth," signifies the dispersion of all falsities by the Word (n. 73); "and His face as the sun shineth in his power" signifies His Divine Love, from which are all things of heaven (n. 74). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="61.">61.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 12. And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me signifies the understanding illustrated. This is evident in some degree from what was said above (n. 55), in the explanation of what is signified by John's hearing a voice behind him. It is clear that in these words there is an arcanum that cannot be known unless it is known how the Divine flows in out of heaven with man; for it was from influx that John heard the voice behind him, and that afterwards, having turned to see the voice, he saw the things that follow. Divine influx out of heaven is into man's will, and through that, into his understanding. Influx into the will is into the occipital region, because into the cerebellum, and from this it passes towards the foreparts into the cerebrum, where the understanding is; and when it comes by that way into the understanding, then it comes also into the sight; for man sees from the understanding. That there is such influx it has been granted me to know by much experience. It is the same whether we say influx into the will, or into the love, since the will is the receptacle of love; and it is also the same whether we say influx into the understanding or into faith, since the understanding is the receptacle of faith (see what is adduced in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 28-35). But it is not permitted to adduce more on these subjects at present, because up to this time they have been unknown: only these few things have been said that it may be known what is involved in John's hearing a voice behind him, and his turning to see it; and why it is that this signifies the understanding illustrated; it is because what enters through the will into the understanding, or through love into faith, comes into illustration, since what man wills or loves, that he clearly perceives. It is otherwise if it enters by the way of the understanding alone. It is said "to see the voice," because by "seeing," when predicated of spiritual things, is signified understanding from illustration (as was shown above, n. 11); and unless "seeing" signified understanding it could not have been said "to see the voice." </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="62.">62.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands, signifies a new heaven and a new church, which are in the good of love. This is evident from the signification of "having turned to see," as being to understand from illustration (see just before, n. 61); and from the signification of "seven," as being what is full and all, and as being predicated where the holy things of heaven and the church are treated of (see above, n. 20, 24); and from the signification of "lampstands," as being the new heaven and the new church (as will be seen in what follows); and from the signification of "gold," as being the good of love (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 113, 1551-1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 9510, 9874, 9881). That "seven lampstands" signify heaven and the church is evident from the last verse of this chapter, where it is said, "The seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches." That "the seven churches" signify all who are of the church of the Lord, thus the church in general, may be seen above (n. 20); they also signify heaven, because heaven and the church make one; moreover, those that have the church in them have heaven in them; for the reason that the good of love and of faith makes the church with man, and makes heaven with him, as it does with angels; consequently, those that had the church, that is, the goods and truths of the church, in them in the world, come into heaven after death. (That this is so, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 12; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 57, 221-227.) The "seven lampstands" here mean the new heaven and the new church, for these are treated of at the end of Revelation (see chapter 21), and thus the conclusion of all things therein; and because that which is last is also first, the prediction respecting these is presented at the beginning. Moreover, it is also customary in the Word to mention in the beginning things that are to take place at the end, because intermediates are thus included; for, in the spiritual sense, the first is the end for the sake of which, as that is both first and last, and to it all other things look (see in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 98).  [2] That "lampstand" signifies heaven and the church is evident from the description of the lampstand which was in the tabernacle, for by the tabernacle the whole heaven in the complex was represented; and by the lampstand therein, the spiritual heaven, which is the second heaven (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3478, 9457, 9481, 9485, 9548-9577, 9783). That this is so is clearly evident from John's seeing "in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man;" "the Son of man" is the Lord in respect to His Divine Human, from which is Divine truth, which is the All in all things of heaven and the church. In the spiritual heaven also lampstands appear in much magnificence; by these that heaven is represented. These it has been given me to see. From this it can be seen what is meant in the Word, in the spiritual sense, by "lampstands" and by "lamps," in the following passages. In Revelation:      I will remove thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent (Rev. 2:5). "To remove thy lampstand" is to take away from them heaven or the church. In Zechariah:      The angel said to the prophet, What seest thou? And I said, I have seen, and behold a lampstand all of gold, its bowl on the top of it, and its seven lamps thereon, with seven pipes to the lamps (Zech. 4:2, 3). Here Zerubbabel is treated of, who was to lay the foundation of the house of God, and to finish it. By Zerubbabel is represented the Lord, that He was about to come and restore heaven and the church: these are the "lampstands" and the holy truths there are "the seven lamps." [3] Because a lampstand takes its representative meaning from the lamps, and the lamps from light, which in heaven is Divine truth, so the Lord is also called "a lamp," as in Revelation:      The holy Jerusalem hath no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it; the glory of God shall lighten&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">62-1</FONT></A> it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof (Rev. 21:23; 22:5). From this also it is that David, and the kings after him, are called:      Lamps of Israel (2 Sam. 21:17; 1 Kings 11:36; 15:4; 2 Kings 8:19); for the Lord in respect to His royalty was represented by David, likewise by the kings of Judah and Israel. (For the representation by "David," see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1888, 9954; and by "kings," n. 31, above.) The lampstands that were seen were of gold; because "gold" signifies the good of love, and all that proceeds from the Lord is from Divine love; consequently the Divine of the Lord in the heavens is love to Him and love towards the neighbor, which is charity (as may be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 13-19). This is why the lampstand here, as well as the lampstand in the tabernacle, was of gold. </p>


<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="63.">63.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 13. And in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man, signifies the Lord, from whom is the All of heaven and of the church. This is evident from the signification of "in the midst," as being in the inmost (see Arcana Coelestia., n. 1074, 2940, 2973); and as all things proceed from the inmost, as light proceeds from the center to the circumferences, so "in the midst" signifies from whom; also from the signification of "the seven lampstands," as being the new heaven and the new church (of which just above, n. 62); and from the signification of "the Son of man," as being the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, and also in respect to Divine truth, because Divine truth proceeds from His Divine Human. From this it can be seen why the Lord appeared "in the midst of seven lampstands," namely, because from Him the All of heaven and the church proceeds; for it is the good of love and of faith that makes heaven and the church, and that this good is from the Divine is known in the Christian world, and as it is from the Divine, it is from the Lord, for the Lord is the God of heaven, and the Divine of the Lord makes heaven (see the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 2-6,7-12; and that this is His Divine Human, see n. 78-86).  [2] That the Son of man is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, and also in respect to Divine truth, because Divine truth proceeds from His Divine Human, is evident from those passages in the Word where the Son of man is mentioned. Thus in John:      The multitude said to Jesus, How sayest Thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? Jesus answered thee, Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, lest darkness overtake you. While ye have the light believe in the light, that ye may be sons of light (John 12:34-36). From these words it is clear that "the Son of man" and "Light" have a like signification; for when the people asked, Who is the Son of man? the Lord answered that He was the Light in which they should believe. (That "light" is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine Human, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126-140; and in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 49; thus also the Son of man.)  [3] In Luke:      Blessed are ye when men shall hate you for the Son of man's sake (Luke 6:2). "For the Son of man's sake" is for the sake of Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord. Divine truth is the All of faith in and of love to the Lord. Because the evil deny these things, and those who deny also hate them, while the good acknowledge them, therefore it is said that the good are blessed. [4] In the same:      The days will come when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, but ye shall not see it. Then they shall say to you, Lo here, or Lo there. Go not away, nor pursue after (Luke 17:22-23). "To desire [to see] one of the days of the Son of man," is to desire Divine truth, which is genuine truth, as to something thereof; the end of the church is here meant, when there will no longer be any faith, because there will be no charity, at which time all Divine truth will perish; and because Divine truth is signified by "the Son of man," it is said, "Then shall they say, Lo here, or Lo there; pursue not after." [5] In the same:      When the Son of man cometh, shall He find faith upon the earth? (Luke 18:8); which means that when Divine truth shall be revealed out of heaven it will not be believed. Here also, "the Son of man" is the Lord in respect to Divine truth; the coming of the Lord is the revelation of Divine truth at the end of the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3900, 4060). [6] In Matthew:      As the lightning cometh forth from the east, and is seen even unto the west, so shall the coming of the Son of man be. Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven; and then shall all the tribes of the earth lament, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and glory (Matt. 24:27, 30). That by "the coming of the Lord in the clouds of heaven" is here signified the revelation of Divine truth at the end of the church, see above (n. 36). [7] In the same:      I say unto you, Henceforth ye shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven (Matt. 26:64). And in Luke:      From henceforth shall the Son of man be seated at the right hand of the power of God (Luke 22:69). "The Son of man" is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, and in respect to Divine truth proceeding from Him; "to sit at the right hand of power" means that He has omnipotence; its being said that they were now about to see this means that Divine truth was in its omnipotence when the Lord in the world had conquered the hells and reduced to order all things there and in the heavens, and that thus those who received Him in faith and love could be saved (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9715. That to "sit at the right hand" means omnipotence, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 8281, 9193; that all the power of good is by means of truth, n. 6344, 6423, 8304, 9327, 9410, 9639, 9643. That Divine power itself is by means of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine Human, see n. 6948; that the "clouds" in which the Son of man is to come are the Word in the letter, which is Divine truth in the ultimate of order, see the preface to chapter 18 of Genesis, n. 4060, 4391, 5922, 6343, 6752, 8443, 8781; and that "glory" is Divine truth itself, such as it is in the internal sense of the Word, see n. 4809, 5922, 8267, 9429). [8] From this it can now be seen what is signified by these words in Revelation:      I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on His head a golden crown (Rev. 14:14). And in Daniel:      I saw in the night visions, and behold, there came with the clouds of the heavens one like unto the Son of man (Dan. 7:13). Because all judgment is executed according to truth, therefore it is said, that it was given to the Lord:      To execute judgment, because He is the Son of man (John 5:27); and that:      The Son of man shall render unto every man according to his deeds (Matt. 16:27); and that:      When the Son of man shall come, He shall sit on the throne of His glory, and shall judge (Matt. 25:31). [9] In Matthew:      He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man, the field is the world, the seed are the sons of the kingdom, the tares are the sons of the evil one (Matt. 13:37-38). "Good seed" is Divine truth; it is therefore said that the Son of man soweth it; "the sons of the kingdom" are Divine truths in heaven and the church; for "son" is truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623), and, in the contrary sense, falsity, which also is "the son of the evil one." [10] In the same:      The Son of man hath not where to lay His head (Matt. 8:20); by which is meant that Divine truth had no place anywhere, that is, with any man at that time. That the Son of man was about to suffer and be put to death (Matt. 17:12, 22-23; 26:2, 24, 45; Mark 8:31; 9:12, 31) signifies that thus they were about to treat Divine truth, consequently the Lord, who was Divine truth itself. This He also teaches in Luke:      But first must the Son of man suffer, and be rejected of this generation (Luke 17:25). [11] In Jeremiah:      No man [vir] shall dwell there; neither shall a son of man [hominis] sojourn there (Jer. 49:18, 33). And in the same:      In the cities no man [vir] shall dwell, nor shall a son of man [hominis] pass through them (Jer. 51:43). He who does not know the spiritual sense of the Word believes that by "cities" here are meant cities, and that by "man," and "son of man," are meant a man and a son; and that the cities were to be so desolated that no one should be in them, but it is the state of the church in respect to the doctrine of truth that is described by these words; for "cities" are the doctrinals of the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 402, 2449, 3216, 4492, 4493); and "man" is its very truth conjoined with good (see n. 3134, 7716, 9007); therefore a "son of man" is truth. [12] As Divine truth proceeding from the Lord was signified by "the Son of man," therefore the prophets by whom it was revealed were called "sons of man" (as Daniel 8:17; and Ezekiel 2:1, 3, 6, 8; 3:1, 3-4, 10, 17, 25; 4:1, 16; 8:5-6, 8, 12, 15; 12:2, 3, 9, 18, 22, 27). As most things in the Word have also a contrary sense, so "son of man" has a contrary signification, which is the falsity opposite to truth. Thus in Isaiah:      What art thou, that thou art afraid of man, that dies; and of the son of man, who shall be as grass (Isa. 51:12). And in David:      Put not your trust in princes, in the son of man, with whom there is no salvation (Ps. 146:3). "Princes" are primary truths (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2089, 5044); so, in the contrary sense, primary falsities; and "the son of man" is falsity itself. </p>

<p>Clothed with a garment down to the foot, signifies Divine truth proceeding from Him. This is evident from the signification of "garments" as being truths that clothe good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1073, 2576, 5248, 5319, 5954, 9212, 9216, 9952, 10536). Here is only mentioned "a garment down to the foot," which is a general covering; by which, as the Lord is treated of, all Divine truth in general is meant. Since the Lord is here described in respect to the Divine Human, which is here the "Son of man seen in the midst of the lampstands," and it is said that He was "clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle," and afterwards that "His face shone as the sun in his power," I wish to give an explanation of what is said in the Evangelists about the Lord when He was transfigured, where some similar expressions are used; and afterwards of what is said about the soldiers dividing His garments, and casting the lot upon His tunic.  [2] Of the Lord's transfiguration it is thus written:      Jesus took Peter, James, and John, into a very high mountain, and He was transfigured before them; and His face did shine as the sun, and His garments became white as the light. And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah speaking with Him. And behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him (Matt. 17:1-6; Mark 9:2-8; Luke 9:28-36). The Lord took Peter, James, and John, because by them the church in respect to faith, charity, and the works of charity was represented; He took them "into a high mountain," because "mountain" signifies heaven; "His face did shine as the sun," because "face" signifies the interiors, and it did shine as the sun because His interiors were Divine, for the "sun" is Divine love; "His garments became white as the light," because "garments" signify Divine truth proceeding from Him; the like is signified by "light." "Moses and Elijah" appeared, because the two signify the Word, "Moses" the historical Word, and "Elijah" the prophetical Word; "a bright cloud overshadowed them," because "a bright cloud" signifies the Word in the letter within which is the internal sense; "a voice out of the cloud said, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him," because "a voice out of the cloud" signifies Divine truth out of the Word, and "beloved Son," the Lord's Divine Human. And because Divine truth is from Him, and thence all truth of the church, it was said out of the cloud, "in whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him."  [3] It was plainly the Divine Human of the Lord that was thus seen, for the Divine Itself cannot be seen by anyone, except through the Divine Human. This the Lord also teaches in John:      No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath brought Him forth to view (John 1:18). And in another place:      Ye have neither heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen His shape (John 5:37). (That such things are signified by these words in the Evangelists, can be seen in the Arcana Coelestia where the particulars are made known, namely, that by "Peter," "James," and "John," in the Word, are signified faith, charity, and the works of charity, n. 3750, and above, n. 8, 9; by "high mountain" is signified heaven, n. 8327, 8805, 9420, 9422, 9434, 10608; by "face," the interiors which are of the mind, n. 1999, 2434, 3527, 4066, 4796, 5102, 9306, 9546; and by "the face of the Lord," mercy, peace, and every good, n. 222, 223, 5585, 9306, 9546, 9888; by "the sun," Divine Love, n. 2495, 4060, 7083; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 116-125; by "garments," when the Lord is treated of, Divine truth, n. 9212, 9216; and the like by "light," n. 3195, 3222, 5400, 8644, 9399, 9548, 9684; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 126-140. That "Moses and Elias" signify the Word; "Moses," see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5922, 6723, 6752, 6771, 6827, 7010, 7014, 7089, 7382, 9372, 10234; and "Elias," see n. 2762, 5247. That "clouds" signify the Word in the letter, see above, n. 36; that "beloved Son" is the Divine Human of the Lord is evident.) From the fact that the "Lord's garments" signify Divine truth, it may be known what is signified by the soldiers dividing the garments of the Lord among them, and casting a lot upon His tunic, of which it is thus written in John:      The soldiers took His garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part, also the tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven from the top throughout. They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for whose it shall be; that the Scripture might be fulfilled which saith, They parted My garments among them, and upon My vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did (John 19:23-24). [4] He who is not aware that in every particular of the Word there is an internal sense which is spiritual, cannot see any arcanum in these things; he knows only that the soldiers divided the garments and not the tunic; and beyond this he knows nothing; when not only in this fact is there a Divine arcanum, but also in every particular of what is recorded concerning the passion of the Lord. The arcanum in this fact is that the garments of the Lord signified Divine truth, thus the Word, because the Word is Divine truth; the "garments" that they divided, the Word in the letter, and the "tunic" the Word in the internal sense to "divide them" signifies to disperse and falsify; and "the soldiers" signify those that are of the church, who should fight in behalf of Divine truth. This is why it is said, "These things therefore the soldiers did." From this it is clear that the meaning of these words in the spiritual sense is that the Jewish Church dispersed the Divine truth which is in the sense of the letter, but could not disperse the Divine truth which is in the internal sense. That the "garments of the Lord" signified Divine truth, thus the Word, was shown above; that His "tunic" signified Divine truth, or the Word, in the internal sense, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9826, 9942; that to "divide" is to disperse and separate from good and truth, thus to falsify, see n. 4424, 6360, 6361, 9094; that "the soldiers" signify those that are of the church, here of the Jewish church, who should fight in behalf of Divine truth, is clear from the spiritual sense of "warfare" and of "war;" that "war" signifies spiritual combats, which are of truth against falsity, see n. 1659, 1664, 8295, 10455; it is therefore said of the Levites, whose function pertained to such things as are of the church, that they were discharging military duty and were serving in war, when they were exercising their ministry in the tent of the assembly (Num. 4:23, 35, 39, 43, 47; 8:23, 24). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="65.">65.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And girt about at the paps with a golden girdle, signifies Divine good likewise. This is evident from the signification of "being girt about at the paps with a girdle," as being to be encompassed about the breast; "paps" and "girdle" are mentioned, because paps stand out from the breast, and a girdle encompasses. Divine good going forth from the Lord is here meant because this is signified by the "breast" in general and by the "paps" in particular. Good proceeding is meant because all garments signify things that proceed, for they are outside the body and clothe it; as things that proceed are also outside the body and encompass it. (That this is so can be seen from what is said in the work on Heaven and Hell, of The Garments with which Angels are Clothed, n. 177-182; namely, that everyone is clothed with garments according to his affection for becoming intelligent and wise, and this affection is what proceeds from them; for there is a sphere that proceeds from every angel and spirit, which is a sphere of affection, and is called the sphere of his life, and their garments are according to this sphere. That this is so does not appear before their eyes, but yet they know that it is so. Of this sphere, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2489, 4464, 5179, 7454, 8630.) [2] From this it can be seen that the "Lord's garments" signify the proceeding Divine, which is Divine truth united to Divine good, which fills the universal heaven and enters into the interiors of the mind, and gives to him who receives it intelligence and wisdom. This is meant by being "clothed with white garments." Because the proceeding Divine good is signified by "the girdle" with which the Lord was girded, therefore the girdle appeared golden, for "gold" signifies the good of love (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658, 6914, 6917, 9510, 9874, 9881). The "paps" are mentioned instead of the breast, which was girt with the girdle, because "paps" signify spiritual love, and "breast" signifies the good itself of that love. This love is signified by "paps" in Isaiah:      I will make thee a magnificence of eternity, the joy of generation and generation. Thou shalt suck the milk of the nations, and shalt suck the paps of kings (Isa. 60:15-16). "Kings" are truths out of good from the Lord (see above, n. 31); "paps" and "breast" are that good, which is the good of spiritual love. [3] That "breast" signifies the good of spiritual love is from correspondence with heaven; for the whole heaven corresponds to all things of man; the inmost or third heaven corresponding to the head; the middle or second to the breast; and the outmost or first to the feet. Because there is this correspondence, heaven is also called the Greatest Man. And as the inmost or third heaven corresponds to the head, by "head" is signified the good of celestial love, which is the good of love to the Lord; because that good rules and makes that heaven; and as the middle or second heaven corresponds to the breast, by "breast" is signified the good of spiritual love, which is the good of love to the neighbor, because that good rules and makes that heaven; and as the outmost or first heaven corresponds to the feet, by "feet" is signified the good of natural love from spiritual love, which is the good of faith; because that good rules and makes that heaven. From this it is clear why "paps" signify spiritual love, and the "breast" its good. (But these things may be better understood from what is shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, especially in the following chapters: On the Three Heavens, n. 29-39; That the Divine of the Lord in the Heavens is Love to Him and Charity towards the Neighbor, n. 13-19; That the Universal Heaven represents one Man, n. 59-67; That there is a Correspondence of Heaven with all things of Man, n. 87-102; and in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 4938, 4939, 10087. It may be permitted to cite from that work, by way of illustration, this further reason why the "breast" signifies the good of spiritual love, namely, that within the breast are the heart and lungs, and the "heart" from correspondence signifies celestial love, while the "lungs" signify spiritual love, but the lungs fill the breast. That there is this correspondence, see in the Arcana Coelestia, n. 3883-3896, 9280, 9300. What celestial love is, and what spiritual love, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 23.) </p>

<p>Verse 14. And His head and hairs white, signifies the Divine in firsts and in ultimates. This is evident from the signification of "head," when it refers to the Lord, of whom these things are said, as being the Divine in firsts (of which presently); and from the signification of "hairs," as being the Divine in ultimates (of which also presently); and from the signification of "white," as being what is pure. (That "white" [album] and "bright white" [candidum] mean what is pure, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319.) "Head," in reference to the Lord, is the Divine in firsts, because the head is the highest part of man, and in it are his firsts, which are called the beginnings, from which are derived all things that have place in the body; for in the head are the understanding and the will, from which, as from their firsts or beginnings, flow the remaining things that relate to man's outer life, such as speech and all actions. But "hairs," in reference to the Lord, mean the Divine in ultimates, because hairs are ultimate things, for they grow out of the outmost parts of man, and first things terminate in them; when, therefore, "head" and "hairs" are mentioned firsts and ultimates are meant. [2] Anyone who knows that in spiritual things also "head" signifies first things and "hairs" ultimates, and that first things and ultimates signify all things (as shown in n. 41), can know many arcana of the internal sense where "head" and "hairs" are mentioned; as that:      A Nazarite should not shave the hair of his head, for this, as it is said, was the Nazariteship of God upon his head, and when the days were accomplished, he was to shave it off and consecrate it (Num. 6:1-21); also that:      The strength of Samson was in his locks, and when they were shaven off he became weak, and when they grew again he came into his strength (Judg. 16:13 to the end); also that:      Forty-two children were torn in pieces by bears because they mocked Elisha, calling him bald-head (2 Kings 2:23-24); as also that:      Elijah was clothed with a garment of hair (2 Kings 1:8);      And John the Baptist with camel's hair (Mark 1:6); furthermore, what "head," "hairs," "beard," and "baldness" signify wherever they are mentioned in the Word. [3] That a Nazarite should not shave his hair, because this, as is said, was the Nazariteship of God upon his head; and that when the days were accomplished he should shave it off and consecrate it, was for the reason that the Nazarite represented the Lord in firsts and in ultimates, and His Divine in ultimates was His Human, which He made Divine even to the flesh and bones, which are ultimates. That He made it Divine even to the flesh and bones is evident from the fact that He left nothing in the sepulcher, and that:      He said to the disciples that He had flesh and bones, which a spirit hath not (Luke 24:39-40). And when the Divine Itself is Divine even in ultimates, then it governs all things from firsts by means of ultimates (as can be seen from what was shown above, n. 41; especially from what was cited from the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that interior things flow in successively into exterior things, even into what is extreme or outmost, and there have existence and subsistence, n. 634, 6239, 6465, 9215, 9216; that they not only flow in successively, but also form what is simultaneous in the ultimate, in what order see n. 5897, 6451, 8603, 10099; that therefore all interior things are held together in connection from the first by means of the ultimate, n. 9828, and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 297; that from this the ultimate is more holy than the interiors, n. 9824; and therefore in ultimates there is strength and power, n. 9836). These then are the reasons why the Nazariteship was instituted. The Nazarite was finally to consecrate his hair by putting it into the fire of the altar, because it represented the Divine holiness, and the "fire of the altar" signified that holiness (n. 934, 6314, 6832). [4] From this it can be seen, moreover, why the strength of Samson was in his hair (Judges 16:13 to the end), for it is said that:      He was a Nazarite from his mother's womb (Judg. 13:7; 16:17). Moreover, for the same reason:      It was not lawful for the high priest and his sons, nor for the Levites, to shave the head and make themselves bald (Lev. 10:6; 21:5, 10; Ezek. 44:20). Likewise:      With the Israelitish people to cut off the beard (which had a like signification) was disgraceful (2 Sam. 10:4, 5). The forty-two children were torn in pieces by the bears because they mocked Elisha, calling him bald-head, for the reason that Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord in respect to the Word, which is Divine truth, the sanctity and strength of which are in ultimates from firsts, as was said just above. Because "baldness" thus signified the deprivation of these, this took place. "Bears," moreover, signify truth in ultimates. (That Elijah and Elisha represented the Lord in respect to the Word, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2762, 5247.) From this it is clear also why Elijah had a hairy garment and John one of camel's hair; for John the Baptist, like Elijah, represented the Lord in respect to the Word; for this reason also he was called Elijah (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 7643, 9372). [5] When these things are understood, it can be known what is signified in the Word by "head," "hairs," "beard," and "baldness," as in Isaiah:      In that time shall the Lord shave by the king of Assyria, the head, and the hairs of the feet, He shall also consume the beard (Isa. 7:20). In the same prophet:      On all heads baldness, every beard cut off (Isa. 15:2). In Jeremiah:      Truth is perished, and is cut off from their mouth. Cut off thine hair and cast it away (Jer. 7:28-29). In Ezekiel:      Take a razor and pass it over the head and beard (Ezek. 5:1).      Shame shall be upon every face, and baldness upon all heads (Ezek. 7:18).      Every head was made bald (Ezek. 29:18). In Amos:      I will bring up baldness upon every head (Amos 8:10). In David:      God shall bruise the head of His enemies, the hairy scalp of him that goeth on in his guilt (Ps. 68:21). In these passages and in others, by "cutting off the hair of the head," "shaving the beard," and inducing baldness, is signified to deprive of all truth and good; since he that is deprived of ultimates is also deprived of things prior, for prior things have existence and subsistence in ultimates, as was said above. Moreover, in the world of spirits there are seen some that are bald, and I have been told that they are such as have abused the Word, and have applied the sense of the letter, which is Divine truth in ultimates, to wicked purposes, and therefore have been deprived of all truth. These are most malignant. Many of them are of the Babylonish body. Angels, on the contrary, appear with becoming hair. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="67.">67.</A></FONT></span>
<p>As white wool, as snow, signifies in respect to good and truth therein. This is evident from the signification of "white wool" as being good in ultimates (of which presently); and from the signification of "snow," as being truth in ultimates. "Snow" means truth in ultimates by reason of the water of which it is composed, and its whiteness and brightness. (That "water" signifies truth, see below, n, 71; and that "whiteness," and "brightness," signify truth from the transparency of light, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3301, 3993, 4007, 5319, 8459.) "White wool," signifies good in ultimates, because wool upon lambs and sheep has a signification like that of hair upon man; and "lambs," and "sheep" signify good, "lambs" celestial good (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3519, 3994, 10132), and "sheep" spiritual good (n. 4169, 4809). From this it is that the "hairs," by which Divine truth in ultimates is signified, are said to be "white as white wool, and as snow." So also of the Lord, when He was transfigured:      His garments became glistening, exceeding white as snow, so as no fuller on earth can whiten them (Mark 9:3); and of the "Ancient of Days" in Daniel:      I beheld till thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of Days did sit; His raiment was white as snow, and the hair of His head was white wool&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">67-1</FONT></A> (Dan. 7:9). "Raiment" signifies the Divine in ultimates (see above, n. 64); and "the Ancient of Days," the Lord from eternity. [2] Because "wool" signifies good in ultimates, good is sometimes described in the Word by "wool," and truth by "linen" and by "snow," as in Hosea:      She said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my waters, my wool and my flax. Therefore will I return and take my corn in the time thereof, and I will pluck away my wool and my flax (Hos. 2:5, 9). In Ezekiel:      Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool; ye slaughter that which is the best; ye feed not the flock (Ezek. 34:3). In David:      Jehovah will send&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">67-2</FONT></A> out His word upon the earth; He giveth snow like wool (Ps. 147:15-16). In Isaiah:      Though your sins be as scarlet they shall be white as snow; though they be red like purple they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18). "Snow" is predicated of sins that were as scarlet, and "wool" of sins that were red like purple, because "scarlet" signifies truth from good, and in a contrary sense, falsity from evil (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4922, 9468); and "red" and "purple" signify good, and in a contrary sense, evil of every kind (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3300, 9467, 9865). </p>




<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="68.">68.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And His eyes as a flame of fire, signifies Divine Providence from His Divine love. This is evident from the signification of "eyes," as being the understanding (see above, n. 37); and in reference to the Lord, as meaning presence, and thus providence (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3869, 10569) of which in what follows; also from the signification of "a flame of fire," as meaning, in reference to the Lord, Divine love. "A flame of fire" means Divine love because from heaven the Lord appears as a sun, and the Divine that proceeds from Him as light, flaming light in the inmost or third heaven, and bright white light in the middle or second heaven. The Divine love itself is what thus appears. From this it is that in the Word "fire" and "flame" signify love (as can be seen from what is shown in the Arcana Coelestia, namely, that in the Word "fire" signifies love in each sense, n. 934, 4906, 5215. That sacred and celestial fire is Divine love, and every affection which is of that love, see n. 934, 6314, 6832. That there are two origins of heat, one the sun of the world, from which all things vegetate upon the earth, the other the sun of heaven, which is the Lord, from which angels and men derive the all of life, see n. 3338, 5215, 7324. That love is the fire of life, and that life itself is actually therefrom, see n. 4906, 5071, 6032, 6314. That flame is truth from the good of the inmost heaven, and light truth from the good of the middle heaven, see n. 3222, 6832; the reason is, that light in the inmost heaven appears flaming, and in the middle heaven bright white, see n. 9570; and likewise in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 116-140). In reference to the Lord, "eyes" signify Divine Providence, because, in reference to man, they signify understanding; and the Divine understanding, because it is infinite, is Divine Providence. Nothing else is signified by the "eyes" of Jehovah in Isaiah:      Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; and open thine eyes, O Jehovah, and see (Isa. 37:17). In Jeremiah:      I will set Mine eye upon them for good, and I will bring them again to their land,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">68-1</FONT></A> and I will build them (Jer. 24:6). In David:      Behold the eye of Jehovah is upon them that fear Him (Ps. 33:18); and in the same:      Jehovah is in the temple of His holiness, His eyes behold, and His eyelids prove the sons of man (Ps. 11:4); and elsewhere. (What Divine Providence is, see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 267-279.) </p>

<p>Verse 15. And His feet like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace, signifies the ultimate of Divine order, which is the natural, full of Divine love. This is evident from the signification of "feet," as being the natural (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952); therefore, in reference to the Lord, as meaning the ultimate of Divine order, because that is the natural; also from the signification of "burnished brass," or brass polished, as being natural good (of which presently); and from the signification of "glowing," as being, in reference to the Lord, what is from Divine love (see n. 10055). It is said, "as if glowing in a furnace," in order that the Divine love in the greatest degree and in its fullness may be represented, for the Divine is in its fullness when it is in its ultimate, and the ultimate is the natural (see above, n. 66). From this it is clear that by "His feet like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace," is signified the ultimate of Divine order, which is the natural, full of Divine love. These things, as well as the preceding, are described by comparisons; as that "His head and His hairs were white as white wool, as snow," and that "His feet were like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace;" but it is to be noted, that all comparisons in the Word are significative, for they are from correspondences in like manner as the things themselves (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3579, 4599, 8989). [2] In reference to the Lord, "feet" signify the ultimate of Divine order, and this is the natural, because heaven is heaven from the Lord's Divine Human, and from this it is that heaven in the whole complex represents one man; and as there are three heavens, that the highest heaven represents the head, the middle heaven the body, and the lowest heaven the feet. The Divine that makes the highest heaven is called the celestial Divine, but the Divine that makes the middle heaven is called the spiritual Divine, and the Divine that makes the lowest heaven is called the natural Divine from the spiritual and celestial. This makes it evident why the Lord is here described in respect to His Divine Human, which is the Son of man seen in the midst of the lampstands, not only as regards His garments, but also as to His head, breast, and feet. (That the Son of man is the Lord as to His Divine Human, see above, n. 63; and that the "lampstands" are heaven, see n. 62. But since these things are arcana hitherto unknown in the world, and yet must be understood in order that the internal sense of this and the following parts of this prophetical book may be comprehended, the particulars have been explained specifically in the work on Heaven and Hell; as That the Divine Human of the Lord makes Heaven, n. 7-12, 78-86, seq.; That on this account Heaven in the whole Complex represents one Man, n. 59-77; That there are Three Heavens, and that the highest refers to the head, the middle to the body, and the lowest to the feet, n. 2940.) When this is understood it can be seen what is signified in the Word by "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord," namely, the ultimate of Divine order, or the natural; and since the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word is the ultimate of Divine order in the church, and is the natural, this is specifically signified by "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord." [3] Because of this signification of "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord," therefore when the Lord was seen as an Angel by the prophets elsewhere, He appeared in like manner. Thus by Daniel:      I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with gold of Uphaz; His body was like the tarshish stone, and His eyes as lamps of fire, and His arms and His feet like the brightness of polished brass (Dan. 10:5-6). In like manner the cherubs, by which is meant the Lord in respect to providence and protection (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9277, 9509, 9673), were seen by Ezekiel:      Their feet sparkled like the brightness of polished brass (Ezek. 1:7). The Lord was seen in like manner as an Angel as described further on in Revelation:      I saw an Angel coming down out of heaven, arrayed with a cloud, and a rainbow was about His head, and His face was as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire (Rev. 10:1). As the Lord appeared in this manner as to His feet, therefore under His feet there was seen by some of the sons of Israel: As it were a work of sapphire stone, and as it were the substance of heaven for clearness (Exod. 24:10). Their vision of the Lord was not as to the feet, but "under the feet," because they were not in, but under, the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word (see The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 248).  [4] Since "the feet of Jehovah" or "of the Lord" signify the ultimate of Divine order, and this specifically is the external of the church, of worship, and of the Word, therefore this external is called in the Word "His footstool," as in Isaiah:      The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, to beautify the place of My sanctuary; I will make the place of My feet honorable. And they shall bow themselves down at the soles of thy feet (Isa. 60:13-14). In the same:      Heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool (Isa. 66:1). In Jeremiah:      God doth not remember His footstool in the day of anger (Lam. 2:1). In      David: Worship Jehovah at His footstool (Ps. 99:5).      We will go into His tabernacles; we will worship at His footstool (Ps. 132:7). In Nahum:      Of Jehovah, the clouds are the dust of His feet (Nahum 1:3). "Cloud" is the external of the Word, or the Word in respect to the letter (see above, n. 36). Because "cloud" is the external of the Word, it is also the external of the church and of worship; for the church and worship are from the Word. "Clouds" are called "dust of His feet," because those things that are in the sense of the letter of the Word, which is natural, appear scattered. </p>

<p>The feet are said to be "like unto burnished brass," because burnished brass is polished brass, shining from something fiery; and "brass" in the Word signifies natural good. Metals are equally significative with the rest in the Word. "Gold" in the Word signifies celestial good, which is inmost good; "silver" signifies the truth thereof, which is spiritual good: "brass" natural good which is outmost good, and "iron" the truth thereof, which is natural truth.  Metals have such significations from correspondence; for in heaven many things are seen shining as if from gold and silver, and also many things as if from brass and iron; and it is there known that by these the goods and truths mentioned above are signified. It was from this that the ancients, who had a knowledge of correspondences, named the ages according to these metals; calling the first age the "golden," because innocence, love, and wisdom therefrom then ruled; but the second "silver," because truth from that good, or spiritual good, and intelligence therefrom then ruled; the third age "brazen" or "copper," because mere natural good, which is justness and sincerity of moral life, then ruled; but the last age they called "iron," because mere truth without good then ruled, and when that rules, falsity also rules. All this was from the spiritual signification of these metals. [2] From this it can be known what is signified by the image seen in a dream by Nebuchadnezzar:      The head of which was of gold, the breast and arms of silver, the belly and sides of brass, the legs of iron, and the feet partly of iron and partly of clay (Dan. 2:23, 33); namely, the state of the church in respect to good and truth, from its first time to its last; its last time was when the Lord came into the world. When it is known that "gold" signifies celestial good, "silver" spiritual good, "brass" natural good, and "iron" natural truth, many arcana in the Word, where these metals are mentioned, can be understood. Thus what is signified by these words in Isaiah:      For brass I will bring gold, for iron I will bring silver, and for wood brass, and for stones iron; I will also make thy government peace, and thine exactors justice (Isa. 60:17). [3] But as the signification of "brass," as meaning natural good, is here treated of, I will cite only a few passages where "brass" is mentioned, as signifying that good. Thus in Moses:      Asher acceptable unto his brethren, and dipping his foot in oil. Thy shoe iron and brass, and as thy days thy fame (Deut. 33:24-25). "Asher," as one of the tribes, signifies the blessedness of life, and the delight of affections (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3938-3939, 6408); "to dip the foot in oil" signifies natural delight, "oil" is delight (see n. 9954), "foot" the natural (see just above, n. 69); "the shoe iron and brass" signifies the lowest natural from truth and good, "the shoe" is the lowest natural (see n. 1748, 1860, 6844), "iron" is its truth, and "brass" its good (as above). In the same:      Jehovah thy God will bring thee into a wealthy land; a land out of whose stones thou mayest hew out iron, and out of its mountains brass (Deut. 8:7, 9). In Jeremiah:      I will give thee unto this people for a fortified wall of brass, that they may fight against thee and not prevail against thee (Jer. 15:20). And in Ezekiel:      Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were thy traffickers; with the soul of man and with vessels of brass they traded thy merchandise (Ezek. 27:13). In this chapter the traffickings of Tyre are treated of, by which are signified the knowledges of good and truth; by the names "Javan," "Tubal," and "Meshech," are signified such things as are of good and truth, of which knowledges treat; the "soul of man" is truth of life; "vessels of brass" are scientifics of natural good. (What is signified by "Tyre" may be seen in Arcana Coelestia, n. 1201; what by "traffickings," n. 2967, 4453; what by "Tubal and Meshech," n. 1151; what by "Javan," n. 1152, 1153, 1155; what by the "soul of man," n. 2930, 9050, 9281; what by "vessels," n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318.) In the same:      The feet of the cherubs sparkled like the appearance of polished brass (Ezek. 1:7). What "cherubs" and "feet" signify, see above (n. 69). [4] In the same:      I saw and behold there was a man, whose appearance was like the appearance of brass, and a line of flax was in his hand; and he was standing in the gate (Ezek. 40:3). It was because this angel measured the wall and the gates of the house of God, which signify the externals of the church, that his appearance was seen as the appearance of brass. He who knows that "brass" signifies the external of the church, which in itself is natural, can in some measure know why:      The altar of burnt-offering was overlaid with brass, and the grating about it was of brass, and the vessels of brass (Exod. 27:1-4); as also why:      The great vessel, which was called the sea, with the twelve oxen under it, and the ten lavers with the bases, and also all the vessels of the tabernacle for the house of God, were made by Solomon of polished brass (1 Kings 7:43-47). [5] He who knows what "brass" signifies may also enter into the arcanum why it was commanded that a serpent of brass be set up for the people to look at, of which it is thus written in Moses:      Jehovah sent serpents among the people, and they bit the people. And He said unto Moses, Make thee a serpent, and set it upon a standard, and it shall come to pass that everyone that is bitten, and looketh upon it, shall live. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it upon a standard; and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, and he looked unto the serpent of brass, he lived (Num. 21:6, 8-9). That this "serpent" signified the Lord, He Himself teaches in John:      As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have everlasting life (John 3:14-15). By the "serpent" is signified that which is the ultimate of life with man, and is called the external sensual, which is the natural. Because this ultimate in the Lord was Divine, a serpent of brass was made among the sons of Israel, with whom all things were representative; and this signified that if they would look to the Divine Human of the Lord they would live again, that is, if they would believe in Him they would have eternal life, as the Lord Himself also teaches. (That to "see" is in the spiritual sense to believe, see above, n. 37, 68; and that the "serpent" is the external sensual, which is the ultimate of man's life, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 195-197, 6398, 6949, 10313.) That "brass" and "iron" in the Word also signify what is hard (as in Isa. 48:4; Dan. 7:19; and elsewhere), will be seen in what follows. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="71.">71.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And His voice as the voice of many waters, signifies Divine truth in ultimates. This is evident from the signification of a "voice" when it is from the Lord, as being Divine truth (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 219, 220, 3563, 6971, 8813, 8914, and above, n. 55); and from the signification of "waters," as being the truths of faith, and also the knowledges of truth (of which see n. 2702, 3058, 5668, 8568, 10238); and since the knowledges of truths are in ultimates, "the voice as the voice of many waters," because it is said of the Lord, signifies Divine truth in ultimates. (That knowledges and scientifics are of the external or natural man, because they are in the light of the world, thus in ultimates, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5212, and in general, New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 51.) As it is not yet known that "waters" in the Word signify the truths of faith and the knowledges of truth, I would like, since this signification may possibly appear remote, to show here briefly that this is what is meant in the Word by "waters." This, moreover, is necessary, because without a knowledge of what "waters" signify, it cannot be known what baptism signifies, nor the "washings" in the Israelitish church so frequently referred to. "Waters" signify the truths of faith, as "bread" signifies the good of love. "Waters" and "bread" have this signification because things that pertain to spiritual nourishment are expressed in the sense of the letter by such things as belong to natural nourishment; for bread and water, which include in general all food and drink, nourish the body, while the truths of faith and the good of love nourish the soul. This also is from correspondence, for when "bread" and "water" are read of in the Word, angels, because they are spiritual, understand the things by which they are nourished, which are the goods of love and the truths of faith. [2] But I will cite some passages from which it may be known that "waters" signify the truths of faith, likewise the knowledges of truth. Thus in Isaiah:      The earth is full of the knowledge of Jehovah, as the waters cover the sea (Isa. 11:9). In the same:      Then with joy shall ye draw waters out of the fountains of salvation (Isa. 12:3). In the same:      He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly, bread shall be given him, and his waters shall be sure (Isa. 33:15-16). In the same:      The poor and the needy seek water, but there is none; their tongue faileth for thirst. I will open rivers upon the heights, and will place fountains in the midst of the valleys. I will make the wilderness into a pool of waters, and the dry land into a going forth of waters; that they may see, and know, and consider, and understand (Isa. 41:17, 18, 20). In the same:      I will pour waters upon him that is thirsty, and streams upon the dry ground; I will pour My spirit upon thy seed, and My blessing upon thine offspring (Isa. 44:3). In the same:      Thy light shall arise in the darkness, and thy thick darkness be as the noonday; that thou mayest be like a watered garden, and like a going forth of waters, whose waters shall not prove false (Isa. 58:10-11). In Jeremiah:      My people have committed two evils; they have forsaken Me, the fountain of living waters, to hew out for themselves pits that hold no water (Jer. 2:13). In the same:      Their nobles sent their little ones for water; they came to the pits and found no waters; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded (Jer. 14:3). In the same:      They have forsaken Jehovah, the fountain of living waters (Jer. 17:13). In the same:      They shall come with weeping,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">71-1</FONT></A> and with supplications will I lead them; I will lead them unto fountains of waters, in the way of right (Jer. 31:9). In Ezekiel:      I will break the staff of bread, and they shall eat bread by weight and with carefulness; and they shall drink water by measure and with astonishment; that they may want bread and water, and be desolated, a man and a brother, and pine away for their iniquities (Ezek. 4:16-17; 12:18-19; Isa. 51:14). In Amos:      Behold the days come, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing the Word of Jehovah. They shall wander from sea to sea, they shall run to and fro, to seek the Word of Jehovah, and shall not find it; in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst (Amos 8:11-13). In Zechariah:      In that day living waters shall go out from Jerusalem (Zech. 14:8). In David:      Jehovah is my Shepherd, I shall not want. He will lead me to the waters of rest (Ps. 23:1-2). In Isaiah:      They shall not thirst, He will cause waters to flow out of the rock for them, and He will cleave the rock, that the waters may flow out (Isa. 48:21). In David:      O God, early will I seek Thee; my soul thirsteth, I am weary without waters (Ps. 63:1). In the same:      Jehovah sendeth His word, He maketh the wind to blow, that the waters may flow (Ps. 147:18). In the same:      Praise Jehovah, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens (Ps. 148:4). In John:      When Jesus came to the fountain of Jacob, a woman of Samaria came to draw water; Jesus said to her, Give Me to drink. If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith unto thee, Give Me to drink, thou wouldest ask of Him, and He would give thee living water. The woman said unto Him, From whence hast Thou living water? Jesus said to her, Everyone that drinketh of this water shall thirst again; but whosoever shall drink of the water that I shall give him shall not thirst for ever; and the water that I shall give him shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up unto everlasting life (John 4:7-15). In the same:      Jesus said, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me and drink. He that believeth on Me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. (John 7:37-38). In Revelation:      I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely (Rev. 21:6). And in another place:      The angel showed unto him a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). And again:      The spirit and the bride say, Come. He that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that is athirst, let him come. And he that wisheth, let him take the water of life freely (Rev. 22:17). [3] These passages have been cited that it may be known that in the Word "waters" signify the truths of faith, consequently what is meant by the water of baptism, about which the Lord thus teaches in John:      Except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God (John 3:5). "Waters" here are the truths of faith, and "spirit" a life according to them (see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 202-209 seq.). Because it had not been known that "waters" signified the truths of faith, and that all things that were instituted among the sons of Israel were representative of spiritual things, it was believed that by the washings that were prescribed for them their sins were wiped away; yet this was not at all the case; those washings only represented purification from evils and falsities by means of the truths of faith and a life according to them (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3147, 5954, 10237, 10240). From this it is now clear that by "the voice," which was "as the voice of many waters," is meant Divine truth; as likewise in Ezekiel:      Behold the glory of the God of Israel came from the way of the east, and His voice was like the voice of many waters; and the earth was enlightened by His glory (Ezek. 43:2). And in David:      The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters, Jehovah upon many waters (Ps. 29:3). And in the following words in Revelation:      I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters (Rev. 14:2). [4] I know that some will wonder why "waters" are mentioned in the Word, and not the truths of faith, since the Word is to teach man about his spiritual life; and since, if the expression the truths of faith had been used, instead of "waters," man would have known that the waters of baptism and of washings contribute nothing to the purifying of man from evils and falsities. But it is to be known, that the Word in order to be Divine, and at the same time useful to heaven and the church, must be wholly natural in the letter, for if it were not natural in the letter there could be no conjunction of heaven with the church by means of it; for it would be like a house without a foundation, and like a soul without a body, for ultimates enclose all interiors, and are a foundation for them (see above, n. 41). Man also is in ultimates, and upon the church in him heaven has its foundations. For this reason the style of the Word is such as it is; and as a consequence, when man from the natural things that are in the sense of the letter of the Word thinks spiritually, he is conjoined with heaven, and in no other way could he be conjoined with it. </p>

<p>Verse 16. And having in His right hand seven stars, signifies all knowledges of good and truth from Him. This is evident from the signification of "having in His right hand," as being from Him; for "hand" signifies power, thus it signifies whatever pertains to one, and so also whatever is from him. It is said "right hand," because "right hand" signifies the power of god through truth. (That "hand" signifies power, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 875, 3091, 4931-4937, 6947, 10019; and consequently that it signifies whatever pertains to one, and so also whatever is from him, 9133, 10019, 10405; that the "right hand" signifies the power of good through truth, see n. 9604, 9736, 10061; and that "the right hand of Jehovah" signifies the Lord's Divine power, thus omnipotence, see n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 7673, 8281, 9133, 10019.) This is evident also from the signification of "stars," as being the knowledges of good and truth, of which more in what follows; and from the signification of "seven," as being all (see above, n. 20, 24). [2] That "stars" signify the knowledges of good and truth, thus goods and truths, is from the appearance in the spiritual world; for there the Lord appears as a sun, and angels from afar off as stars. Angels appear thus from their reception of light from the Lord as a sun, thus from their reception of Divine truth, which is from the Lord, for this is the light of heaven. From this it is that it is said in Daniel:      The intelligent shall shine as the brightness of the expanse; and they that justify many, as the stars for ever and ever (Dan. 12:3). The "intelligent" are they that are in truths, and "they that justify" are those that are in good (see the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 346-348). [3] When it is known to any that the "sun" signifies the Lord in respect to Divine love, thus also Divine love from the Lord, and that "stars" signify the truths of the church and knowledges thereof, these can also know what is signified in the Word where it is said that "the sun shall be darkened," and that "the stars shall not give light," also that they "shall fall from heaven;" and also what "stars" signify when mentioned elsewhere in the Word, as in the following passages. In Isaiah:      I will make the land a waste, and destroy the sinners thereof out of it; the stars of the heaven and the constellations thereof shall not shine forth with their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not make bright her light (Isa. 13:9-10). The vastation of the church is here treated of, which is when there is no good of love any more, nor any truths of faith. The "land" that shall be laid waste is the church; the "land" is the church (as may be seen above, n. 29). [4] In Ezekiel:      When I shall extinguish thee I will cover the heavens, and will make the stars dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not make her light to shine; all the luminaries of light will I make dark over thee, and I will set darkness upon the land (Ezek. 32:7-8). "Darkness upon the land" means falsities in the church. In Joel:      The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars withdraw their brightness (Joel 2:10-11; 3:15). In Matthew:      In the consummation of the age, after the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken (Matt. 24:29; Mark 13:24). In Daniel:      From one of the horns of the he-goat went forth a horn, a little one, and it waxed exceeding great towards the south, and towards the east, and towards splendor; and it waxed great towards the host of the heavens; and some of the host and of the stars it cast down and trampled upon them. Yea, it magnified itself even to the Prince of the host (Dan. 8:9-11). By the "host of the heavens" the goods and truths of the church in the complex are meant (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3448, 7236, 7988, 8019); in particular, such as combat against falsities (see n. 7277). From this Jehovah is called "Jehovah Zebaoth," that is, Jehovah of Hosts (see n. 3448, 7988). [5] In Revelation:      The dragon with his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven to the earth (Rev. 12:4). The "stars" here also are the goods and truths of the church, and the knowledges thereof; the "third part" is the greater part; but what is signified by the "dragon" will be told in what follows. In the same:      The stars of heaven fell unto the earth (Rev. 6:13). In the same:      A star from heaven is fallen unto the earth (Rev. 9:1). In the same:      There fell from heaven a great star burning as a torch; it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters (8:10). As "stars" signify the goods and truths of the church and the knowledges thereof, by their "falling from heaven" is signified that these perish. In David:      Jehovah telleth the number of the stars, He calleth them all by names (Ps. 147:4). In the same:      Praise ye Jehovah, sun and moon; praise Him, all ye stars of light (Ps. 148:3). In the book of Judges:      The kings came, they fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought (Judg. 5:19-20). Since the angels in the spiritual heaven shine as stars, and since all the truths and goods that are with the angels are from the Lord, therefore the Lord, as He is called an "Angel," is likewise called a "Star," as in Moses:      There shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall arise out of Israel (Num. 24:17). In Revelation:      Jesus, the bright and morning Star (Rev. 22:16). From this it can be seen:      Why the wise men from the east saw a star, and followed it, and why it stood where Jesus had been born (Matt. 2:1-2, 9). From this it can now be known what is signified by the "seven stars" that were in the right hand of the Son of man, who there is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human (see above, n. 63). </p>

<p>And out of His mouth a sharp two-edged sword going forth, signifies the dispersion of falsities by the Word. This is evident from the signification of "going forth out of the mouth," as being, in reference to the Lord, Divine truth, thus the Word, for the Word goes forth out of the Lord's mouth. This is evident also from the signification of "the long sword," or the "sword," as being truth combating; and as truth, when it combats, disperses falsities, therefore a "long sword" also signifies the dispersion of falsities. The long sword is called "two-edged and sharp," because truth completely disperses. (That "long sword" or "sword" signifies truth combating against falsities and destroying them, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2799, 6353, 8294.) As "the long sword" is frequently mentioned in the following pages (as in chap. 1:12, 16; 6:4, 8; 13:10, 14; 19:15, 21), passages from the Word illustrating and showing that it signifies truth combating and dispersing falsities, will here be omitted. This will be illustrated and shown in those places. </p>

<p>And His face as the sun shineth in his power, signifies His Divine love, from which are all things of heaven. This is evident from the signification of "face," as being, in reference to the Lord, Divine love, from which is all good, thus all things of heaven (Arcana Coelestia, n. 5585, 9306, 9546, 9888; and that the Lord in the Word in respect to the Divine Human is called "the face of Jehovah," see n. 10579. That the Lord from Divine love appears from heaven as a sun shining, and that from Him, as a sun, all things of heaven have existence and subsistence, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 116-125, and in what follows). </p>

<p>Verses 17-20. And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as dead. And He laid His right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the First and the Last; and the Living One; and I became dead; and behold I am alive unto the ages of the ages, amen: and I have the keys of hell and of death. Write the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which are to be hereafter. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, and the seven golden Lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches; and the seven Lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches. 17. "And when I saw Him," signifies the presence of the Divine majesty (n. 76); "I fell at His feet," signifies adoration from humiliation of heart in presence of the Divine (n. 77); "as dead," signifies failure of self-life (n. 78) "And He laid His right hand upon me," signifies life from Him (n. 79); "saying unto me, Fear not," signifies revival (n. 80); "I am the First and the Last," signifies who governs all things from firsts by means of ultimates, thus all things of heaven (n. 81). 18. "And the Living One," signifies who is from eternity (n. 82); "and I became dead," signifies that He was rejected (n. 83); "and behold I am alive unto the ages of the ages," signifies that eternal life is from Him (n. 84); "amen," signifies Divine confirmation (n. 85); "and I have the keys of hell and of death," signifies that He has power to save (n. 86). 19. "Write the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which are to be hereafter," signifies that all these things are for posterity, because Divine (n. 87). 20. "The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand," signifies revelation concerning goods and truths, which are all from Him (n. 88); "and the seven golden lampstands," signifies also concerning the things in the new heaven and new earth (n. 89); "the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches," signifies those who receive goods and truths from the Lord (n. 90); "and the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches," signifies that all such are in the new heaven and in the new church (n. 91). </p>

<p>Verse 17. And when I saw Him, signifies the presence of the Divine majesty. This is evident from the things that precede relating to the Son of man, all of which are of the Divine majesty, as is clear from the explanation of them in the internal sense; as that "He was clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about at the paps with a golden girdle," signifying that Divine truth and Divine good proceed from Him; that "His head and His hairs were white as white wool, as snow," signifying the Divine in firsts and in ultimates; that "His feet were like unto burnished brass, as if glowing in a furnace," signifying that His Human, even in ultimates, is full of Divine love; that "His voice was as the voice of many waters," signifying that all Divine truth is from Him; that "He had in His right hand seven stars," signifying that all goods and truths of heaven and the church are therefrom; that "out of His mouth a sharp two-edged sword went forth," signifying that by Him all falsities are dispersed; that "His face was as the sun shineth in his power," signifying that from His Divine love were all things of heaven. It is clear that these things are Divine, and that they appeared full of Divine majesty. That to "see" signifies here the presence, now most interior, of these things, is evident from this, that it was also said before that John saw them (verse 12), and according to that seeing also they were described; and now again it is said "I saw Him," and on account of this seeing he fell at His feet as dead; therefore it is that by "seeing" is here signified the presence of the Divine majesty. This presence came to John, when he saw "His face as the sun in his power," for from this he was illustrated and filled with awe, in the presence of the Divine; for all Divine light is from the Lord as a sun, and Divine light passes into the interiors; from this comes such presence and such filling with awe (as can be seen in the work on Heaven and Hell, on the Lord as a Sun, n. 116-125; on Light and Heat therefrom in Heaven, n. 126-140; and on Turning to Him, n. 17, 123, 144, 145, 151, 255, 272, 510, 548, 561). It is to be known, moreover, that man has two kinds of sight, one from cogitative faith, the other from love: when he has sight from cogitative faith only, his sight is unattended with awe before the Lord's Divine majesty; but when this sight is from love, it is attended with awe at the Divine majesty; this is because man is then turned to the Lord, for love turns him, but cogitative faith apart from love does not (as can be seen from the passages cited above from the work on Heaven and Hell, about turning). That this is so is well known in the spiritual world. It is clear, therefore, that by "I saw him," stated a second time, is signified the presence of the Divine majesty. </p>

<p>And I fell at His feet, signifies adoration from humiliation of heart in presence of the Divine. This is evident from the signification of "falling at the feet," as being adoration from humiliation. Humiliation of heart is meant, because humiliation that springs from the heart in presence of the Divine produces that prostration. All affections, whatsoever they are, have corresponding gestures in the body. Into these gestures the body is borne and falls as of itself, when man is interiorly in the affection. Humiliation before a man produces a bowing down, according to the estimation of him; but in presence of the Divine it produces total prostration, especially when man thinks that the Divine in respect to power and wisdom is everything, and man in comparison is nothing, or that from the Divine is all good and from man nothing but evil.  When man is in this acknowledgment from the heart he comes as it were out of himself, and thence falls upon his face, and when he is thus out of himself he also is removed from the proprium [what is his own], which in itself is wholly evil; when this is removed, the Divine fills him and raises him up; not that the Divine desires such humiliation on its account, but because evil is then removed, and so far as evil is removed with man so far the Divine flows in; for evil alone stands in the way. (An example of such humiliation may be seen in the little work on the Earths in the Universe, n. 91.) Man's state when the Divine presence with him removes proprium [what is his own], and afterwards infills him, is thus described in this verse: "When I saw Him I fell at His feet as dead; and He laid His right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not." This state is more fully described in Daniel:      I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold a Man clothed in linen, His face as the appearance of lightning, and His eyes as lamps of fire, and His feet like the splendor of burnished brass. I alone saw the vision; but the men that were with me saw it not; but great fear fell upon them, and they fled. And there remained no strength in me; and I came into a deep sleep, and my face upon the ground. But lo, a hand touched me, and set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands, and He said, Fear not (Dan. 10:5-12). This state is also described in Ezekiel, when he saw the cherubs, by which is signified the Lord in respect to Providence:      When I saw the glory of Jehovah, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of One that spoke. And He said unto me, son of man, stand upon thy feet, that I may speak to thee. And the spirit entered into me when He spoke unto me, and set me upon my feet, and I heard Him that spake unto me (Ezek. 1:28; 2:1-2; 3:24). Likewise also, when Jesus was transfigured before Peter, James, and John, of which it is thus written in Matthew:      While Peter was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them; and behold, a voice out of the cloud saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him. And when the disciples heard these things they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, be not afraid. And when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only (Matt. 17:5-8). From this it is apparent of what nature is the presence of the Divine Human of the Lord with man, when man is in a state of humiliation of heart, namely, that he falls upon his face, and by the touch of the Lord's hand is raised upon his feet. It was plainly the presence of the Lord in respect to the Divine Human; since it was the "Son of man" who was in the midst of the lampstands that appeared in this way before John; and the "Son of man" is the Lord as to the Divine Human, see above (n. 63). It was similar with the disciples when the Lord was transfigured; it is therefore also said that "when they lifted up their eyes they saw no one save Jesus only." That it was also the Lord as to the Divine Human who was seen by Daniel and Ezekiel, is evident from the words of the Lord himself, that:      No one hath heard the Father's voice at any time, nor seen His form (John 5:37; see also John 1:18). Moreover, that men worshiped the Lord when He was in the world, by falling upon the face at His feet, may be seen in Matt. 28:9; and in Mark 7:25-26; Luke 8:41; 17:15-16, 18; and in John 11:32. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="78.">78.</A></FONT></span>
<p>As dead, signifies failure of self-life. This is evident from the signification of "as dead," in reference to the Divine presence with man, as meaning the failure of self-life; for man's self-life is that into which he is born, which is in itself nothing but evil, for it is altogether inverted, for it has regard to itself and the world only, and therefore turns itself back away from God and from heaven. The life that is not man's self-life is that into which he is led when he is being regenerated by the Lord; and when he comes into that life he regards God and heaven in the first place, and self and the world in the second. That life flows in with man when the Lord is present; consequently so far as that life flows in, so far there is effected a turning of the life. This turning, when effected suddenly, causes man to appear to himself as dead; thence it is that by "as dead" is here signified the failure of self-life. But these two states of life cannot be so described as to be apprehended. Moreover, they are not the same with a man and with a spirit, and they are wholly different with the evil and with the good. Man cannot live with the body in the presence of the Divine; those who do live are encompassed by an angelic column, which moderates the Divine influx; for the body of every man is nonreceptive of the Divine, consequently it dies and is cast off. That man cannot live with the body in the presence of the Divine can be seen from the words of the Lord to Moses:      Thou canst not see My faces; for man shall not see Me and live (Exod. 33:20); Moses, therefore, because he desired to see, was placed in a cleft of a rock and was covered until the Lord had passed by. Furthermore, it was known to the ancients that man cannot see God and live, as is evident from the book of Judges:      Manoah said unto his wife, Dying we shall die, because we have seen God (Judg. 13:22); and this was also attested to the sons of Israel, when the Lord was seen from Mount Sinai, of which it is thus written in Moses:      Be ready against the third day; for the third day Jehovah will come down in the eyes of all the people, upon Mount Sinai. And thou shalt set bounds unto the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the extremity of it; whosoever toucheth the mount dying he shall die. And because terror seized upon them, they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us and we will hear; but let not God speak with us lest perchance we die (Exod. 19:11-12; 20:19). (That by "Mount Sinai" is signified heaven, where the Lord is, and that by "touching" is signified to communicate, to transfer, and to receive, and for this reason it was forbidden to touch the extremity of that mountain, see in the explanation of those chapters in the Arcana Coelestia.) Jehovah has been seen by many, as recorded in the Word, but this was because they were encompassed at the time by a column of spirits, and thus were preserved, as was said above. In this way the Lord has also been seen at different times by me. But the state of spirits in the Divine presence is different from the state of men; spirits cannot die, consequently if they are evil they die a spiritual death in the Divine presence, the nature of which will be spoken of presently; but those who are good are conveyed into societies, where the sphere of the Divine presence is tempered and accommodated to reception. On account of this there are three heavens, and in each heaven many societies, and those who are in the higher heavens are nearer to the Lord, and those who are in the lower are more remote from Him (see the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 20-28, 29-40, 41-50, 206-209). What the spiritual death is that evil spirits die in the Divine presence, shall be briefly stated. Spiritual death is a turning away and removal from the Lord. When evil spirits, however, who have not yet been vastated, that is, have not yet become fixed in their ruling love, enter any angelic society, then because the Divine of the Lord is there present they are direfully tormented, and not only turn away but even cast themselves down into the depths, where no light from heaven enters; some into dark caverns of rocks; in a word, into the hells (see what is shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 54, 400, 410, 510, 525, 527). This turning away and removal from the Lord is what is called spiritual death; and with such the spiritual of heaven is dead. </p>

<p>And He laid His right hand upon me, signifies life from Him. This is evident from the signification of "right hand," as being, in reference to the Lord, life from Him (see above, n. 72). It signifies life from Him, because it immediately follows the words, "I fell at His feet as dead;" and moreover, "to touch with the hand" signifies to communicate and transfer to another what pertains to oneself, and also to receive from another. To communicate and transfer to another what pertains to oneself, in reference to the Lord, as here, is to communicate and transfer life such as those have who are in a state of illumination and who see and hear such things as are in heaven. This also took place with John, for he was in such illumination when he saw and heard the things that are described in Revelation "To touch with the hand" is to communicate and transfer to another, because the whole power of man is transferred from the body into the hands; consequently what the mind wills that the body should do, that the arms and hands do (from this it is that by "arms" and "hands" in the Word is signified power, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 878, 3091, 4931-4937, 6947, 7673, 10019).  But this power is natural power, and communication thereby is an exertion of the bodily forces; but spiritual power is to will the good of another, and to will to convey to another as far as possible what is with oneself. This power is what "hand" in the spiritual sense signifies, and its communication and transference are signified by "touching with the hand." From this it can be seen what is signified by this, that the Lord, who is here called the "Son of man," laid His right hand upon John, when John lay as dead, namely, that He communicated and transferred to him life from Himself (see above). "To touch," and "to touch with the hand," has a similar signification in many passages in the Word, as in the following. In Daniel:      The Lord, who there appeared to him as a man clothed in linen, whose appearance was as the appearance of lightning, and His eyes as torches of fire, and His feet as the brightness of polished brass, touched him; and restored him to his standing; and lifted him upon his knees; and touched his lips, and opened his mouth; and still again touched him, and strengthened him (Dan. 10:4 to the end). In Jeremiah:      Jehovah put forth His hand, and touched my mouth, and said, I put My words into thy mouth (Jer. 1:9). And in Matthew:      Jesus stretching forth His hand to the leper, touched him, saying, I will; be thou made clean. And straightway his leprosy was cleansed (Matt. 8:3). In the same:      Jesus saw Peter's wife's mother sick of a fever, and he touched her hand, and the fever left her (Matt. 8:14-15). In the same:      Jesus touched the eyes of the two blind men, and their eyes were opened (Matt. 9:29-30). In the same:      When Peter was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed the disciples, and behold, a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye Him. And when the disciples heard these things they fell on their face, and were sore afraid. Then came Jesus and touched them, and said, Arise, be not afraid (Matt. 17:5-8). In Luke:      Jesus came and touched the bier of the dead, and said, Young man, I say unto thee, Arise. Then he that was dead sat up, and began to speak (Luke 7:14-15). In the same:      Jesus touched the ear of the deaf one,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">79-1</FONT></A> and healed him (Luke 22:51). In Mark:      And they brought [to Jesus] little children, that He should touch them; and He took them in His arms, put His hands upon them, and blessed them (Mark 10:13, 16). In the same:      They brought unto Jesus those that were ill, that they might touch if it were but the border of His garment; and as many as touched were made whole (Mark 6:56; Matt. 14:35, 36). In Luke:      A woman suffering from an issue of blood touched the border of His garment; and immediately the issue of her blood stanched. Jesus said, Who is it that touched Me? Some one did touch Me; I knew that power went forth from Me (Luke 8:43-46). Because "touching" and "laying on of hands" signify communicating and transferring to another what pertains to oneself, therefore it has been customary in the churches from ancient times to lay hands upon the head of those who are inaugurated and blessed:      This Moses also was commanded to do to Joshua (Num. 27:18-23; Deut. 34:9). As all things among the sons of Israel were representative and significative of spiritual things, so also was touch; wherefore those who touched what was holy were sanctified, and those who touched what was unclean were polluted; for "touch" signified communication and transference to another, and reception from another, as can be seen from the following passages in Moses:      Whosoever shall touch the tent of meeting; the ark of the Testimony; the table, and all the vessels thereof; the lampstand and the vessels thereof; the altar of incense; the altar of burnt-offering, and all the vessels thereof, and the laver and the base thereof, shall be holy (Exod. 30:26-29).      Whatsoever toucheth the altar shall be holy (Exod. 29:37).      Everything that toucheth the remainder of the meal-offering, and the remainder of the flesh from the sacrifice, shall be holy (Lev. 6:18, 27).      Whosoever toucheth the dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of Jehovah; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel. And whosoever in the open field toucheth one that is slain with a sword, or the bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. He that toucheth the waters of separation shall be unclean until even. And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall become unclean, and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even (Num. 19:11, 13, 16, 21-22).      He that toucheth unclean beasts and unclean reptiles shall be unclean. Everything upon which they shall fall shall be unclean, whether it be a vessel of wood, raiment, water, an earthen vessel, food, drink, an oven, (but not a fountain, pit, or receptacle of water) shall be unclean (Lev. 11:31-36, besides other places, as Lev. 5:2, 3; 7:21; 11:37, 38; 15:1 to the end; 22:4; Num. 16:26; Isa. 52:11; Lam. 4:14, 15; Hos. 4:2, 3; Hag. 2:12, 13, 14). </p>


<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="80.">80.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Saying unto me, Fear not, signifies renewal of life. This is evident from the series of things in the internal sense. For John lay as dead, and the Lord, seen as the Son of man, laid His right hand upon him, and said to him, "Fear not." His "lying as dead" signified failure of his self-life; the Lord's "laying His right hand upon him" signified life from Him; therefore His saying to him "Fear not" signified renewal of life; for all who come suddenly from self-life into any spiritual life are at first afraid, but their life is renewed by the Lord. This renewal is effected in this way that the Divine presence, and fear on account of it, are accommodated to reception. The Lord is present, indeed, with all in the universe, but more nearly or remotely according to the reception of good by means of truths with them from Him. For good is that in which the Lord is present with angel, spirit, and man; therefore the extent and quality of good from the Lord with them are what determine the extent and quality of His presence; if the presence goes beyond this, there is anguish and tremor; but by accommodation to reception there is renewal of life (as can be seen from what has just been said and shown above, n. 78). This renewal is what is signified by "Fear not;" also in other places, where it is said by the Lord or by the angel of the Lord when seen:      Fear not (Dan. 10:12, 19; Luke 1:12, 13; 2:8-10; Matt. 28:5, 9-10). Renewal of life, that comes by accommodation to reception, appears in the spiritual world, when it is presented to view, as a cloud. All societies there are encompassed by such a cloud, denser or rarer according to reception. (That angels are encompassed by a thin correspondent cloud, lest they should be hurt by a nearer influx of the Divine of the Lord, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6849. What "clouds" are in the spiritual world, and therefore in the spiritual sense, see above, n. 36.) </p>

<p>I am the First and the Last, signifies who governs all things from firsts by means of ultimates, thus all things of heaven. This is evident from the explanation given above (n. 41). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="82.">82.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 15. And the Living One, signifies who is from eternity. This is evident from this, that He who is from eternity is the only Living One, and that all others, who are not from eternity, have been created by Him, and thus made recipients of life from Him. Therefore He only who is from eternity has life in Himself, and no one besides Him. That the Lord, in respect both to the Divine and to the Human, has life in Himself, is evident from what is said in John:      In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us (John 1:2-4, 14). That the Lord is here meant by the "Word" is clear, for it is said, "the Word became flesh, and dwelt in us." In the same:      As the Father hath life in Himself, even so gave He to the Son to have life in Himself (John 5:26). In the same:      Jesus said, I am the resurrection and the life (John 11:25). And in the same:      Jesus said, I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6). It is believed in the world that man has life implanted in him, and that it does not therefore flow in unceasingly from Him who alone has life in Himself, and who thus alone is Life. But this belief is a belief in what is false (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 9). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="83.">83.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And I became dead, signifies that He was rejected. This is evident from this, that the Lord is said to be "dead" when faith in Him and love towards Him are no more; for with those who are in love towards Him and faith in Him the Lord lives, but with those who are not in love and in faith toward Him He does not live. With such He is said to be "dead" because He is rejected. This is what is here meant in the internal sense by the words "I became dead;" but in the sense of the letter it is meant that He was crucified. The Lord's being crucified has a like signification in the internal sense, namely, that He was rejected and treated thus by the Jews; for the Lord, when He was in the world, was Divine truth itself, and as Divine truth was altogether rejected by the Jews, therefore the Lord, who was Divine truth, suffered Himself to be crucified. Such things are signified by all that is related in the Evangelists concerning the Lord's passion; the particulars, even to every minutest particular, involve this. Whenever, therefore, the Lord speaks of His passion He calls Himself the Son of man, that is, Divine truth (see above, n. 63). That Divine truth was altogether rejected by the Jews is well known; for they accepted nothing that the Lord said, and not even that He was the Son of God. From this it may be known how those things that the Lord said to the disciples about the Jews' rejection of Him are to be understood. Thus in Luke:      The Son of man must suffer many things, and be repudiated by the elders and chief priests and scribes (Luke 9:22). In the same:      The Son of man must suffer many things, and be repudiated by this generation (Luke 17:25). In Mark:      It is written of the Son of man, that He should suffer many things and be set at naught (Mark 9:12). In Luke:      Jesus took unto Him the twelve, and said unto them, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are foretold through the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. For He shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and shamefully entreated, and spit upon; and after they have scourged Him, they shall put Him to death; but the third day He shall rise again (Luke 18:31-33). The way in which the Jews treated Divine truth, which was from the Word, is signified by these particulars. "Jerusalem" here is the Jewish Church; "to be delivered unto the Gentiles, to be mocked, to be shamefully entreated, to be spit upon, to be scourged, to be put to death," are the wicked ways in which the Jews treated Divine truth; and as the Lord was Divine truth itself, because He was the Word (John 1:14), and as it was foretold in the prophets that Divine truth would be so dealt with in the end of the church, therefore it is said, "that all things may be accomplished that have been foretold through the prophets concerning the Son of man." So elsewhere in the same Gospel:      These are the words which I spoke unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning Me (Luke 24:44). That all things were accomplished when Jesus was crucified He Himself said, when He was upon the cross:      Jesus, knowing that all things were accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst (John 19:28). He then said, "I thirst," because He longed for a new church that would acknowledge Him. (That to "thirst," in the spiritual sense, signifies to long for, and that it is predicated of the truths of the church, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 4958, 4976, 8568.) These are also the things that were predicted by Daniel concerning vastation and desolation:      After sixty and two weeks shall the Messiah be cut off, but not for Himself; then the people of the Prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary, so that its end shall be with a flood. At last upon the bird of abominations shall be desolation, and even to the consummation and decision it shall drop upon the devastation (Dan. 9:26-27). "Desolation" and "vastation" signify repudiation and rejection of Divine truth with those that are of the church (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 5360, 5376). That Divine truth, which is the Word, was so repudiated by the Jews, is also meant by these words in Matthew:      I say unto you that Elias is come already, and they have not acknowledged him, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Even so shall the Son of man suffer of them (Matt. 17:12). By "Elias" the Word is signified (see Arcana Coelestia, preface to chapter 18 of Genesis, and in n. 2762, 5247), and also by "John the Baptist;" therefore he was called "Elias" (n. 7643, 9372). From this it can be seen what is signified by "Elias has come," and that "they have done to him whatsoever they listed," and that "the Son of man is to suffer of them." How the Jews explained and thus rejected the Word is clear from many passages in the Gospels, where the Lord makes this manifest. From this it can now be seen that "I became dead," signifies that He was rejected. Moreover, that the Lord, by the passion of the cross, also glorified His Human, that is, made it Divine, see New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 294, 295, 302, 305. </p>

<p>And behold I am alive unto the ages of the ages, signifies that eternal life is from Him. This is evident from the signification of "I am alive," which means to be from eternity, and that in Him alone is life from Himself (on which see above, n. 82); but here as being life in others, and His life in others is eternal life. For it is said just before that He "became dead," which signifies that He was rejected, because not received in faith and love; here, therefore, "I am alive" signifies that He is received by those who are in His life, which life is in faith and love with man, and that life is eternal life. That "unto the ages of the ages" signifies to eternity, is clear without explanation. That the life of the Lord is a life of faith in Him and love to Him, and that this life is eternal life is evident from many passages in the Word, as the following from John:      As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but may have eternal life. He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that believeth not on the Son shall not see life (John 3:14-16, 36). In the same:      The water that I shall give shall become in him a fountain of water, springing up unto eternal life (John 4:10-11, 14). Water is the truth of faith (see above, n. 71). In the same:      Everyone that beholdeth the Son, and believeth on Him, hath eternal life. The words that I speak unto you are spirit and are life (John 66:40, 63). The "words" that the Lord speaks are also the truths of faith. In the same:      I am the resurrection and the life; he that believeth in Me, though he die, yet shall he live (John 11:25-26). In the same:      Work for the food which abideth unto eternal life, which the Son of man giveth (John 6:27). The "food" which the Lord gives is also the truth and good of faith, because spiritual food is meant (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 3114, 4459, 4792, 5147, 5293, 5340, 5342, 5410, 5426, 8562, 9003). It was said that the life of the Lord is in faith in Him and love to Him with man; this is because everything of faith and love is from Him, and that which is from Him is also Himself, for it is His proceeding Divine, which is called "the Spirit of Truth" and "the Holy Spirit;" and as the Lord is therein, and it is Himself, therefore it is said that they should abide in the Lord, which means in faith in Him and love to Him, from Him; as in John:      Jesus said, Abide in Me, and I in you. If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask whatever ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Abide in My love. If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye cannot do anything (John 15:4-10). From this it may be known what is meant by these words in John:      Ye see Me; because I live ye shall live also (John 14:19). (That to "see" the Lord is to believe in Him, see above, n. 14, 25, 37; and that "to have faith," or "to believe" in the Lord, is to be in love and charity, see the little work on The Last Judgment, n. 33-39; and New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 108-142.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="85.">85.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Amen, signifies Divine confirmation, as may be seen above (n. 34). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="86.">86.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And I have the keys of hell and of death, signifies that He has power to save. This is evident from the signification of "keys," as being the power to open and shut (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 9410); and from the signification of "hell," as being evils, for all evils are from hell and belong to hell; and from the signification of "death," as being damnation, which is also called spiritual death (see n. 5407, 6119, 9008). "To have the keys of hell and of death" means also the power to save, because the Lord alone removes the hells with man and thereby damnation; and when the hells are removed man is saved, for in their place heaven and eternal life flows in; for the Lord is constantly present with man, and desires to fill him with heaven, but evils stand in the way of its being received; so far, therefore, as the hells are removed, that is, so far as man refrains from evils, so far the Lord with heaven flows in.  The Lord here says that He "has the keys of hell and of death," because it is said immediately before that He is "alive unto the ages of the ages," by which is meant that from Him is eternal life; and so far as the Lord is received in faith and in love so far as He is in man, and so far as He is in man so far He removes evils, thus the hells and eternal death. This the Lord alone does, and for this reason He ought to be received, as is evident also from the passages from the Word cited just above (n. 83). By "hell" evils of every kind are signified, because all evils are from hell. Whatever man thinks and wills is either from hell or from heaven. If he thinks and wills evil it is from hell, but if he thinks and wills good it is from heaven. There is no thought and will in man from any other source. The man who supposes that he thinks and wills from himself is not aware of this; but I can assert from all experience on this subject that every thing that a man thinks and wills is either from one or the other of these sources. For this reason, moreover, the man who thinks and wills evil is actually in hell; and where one actually is while he lives in the world thither will he come after death.  He can come into no other place because man's spirit is formed and composed of those things that he thinks and wills. When, therefore, he thinks and wills evil, the whole man is formed and composed of evil, so that he is his own evil in form. From this it is that infernal spirits are altogether images of their own evil, and are monstrosities, horrible according to the kind of evil. Furthermore, the only means whereby a spirit can be formed and constituted for heaven is receiving the Lord in faith and love; for the Lord alone, by His presence in faith and love with man, removes evils, and forms man into an image of heaven, which is an angel. From this it can be seen what is signified by "having the keys of hell and of death." The word "keys" is used because all the hells are closed up, and are opened only when evil spirits are cast into them, and when any are taken out of them, which occurs when evils increase with men. The openings that are then made are called "gates," and as they are called "gates," so also "keys" are mentioned, and these signify the power to open and to shut, since the opening and shutting of gates is effected by means of keys.  The keys given to Peter (Matthew 16:18, 19) have a like signification; for by "Peter" is there signified truth from the good which is from the Lord, thus it is meant that the Lord alone, from whom is all the truth of faith and the good of love, has that power (see the little work on The Last Judgment, n. 57). </p>

<p>Verse 19. Write the things which thou sawest, and the things which are, and the things which are to be hereafter, signifies that all these things are for posterity, because Divine. This is evident from the signification of "writing," as being that it is for remembrance (see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8620), thus that these things are for posterity; and from the signification of "which thou sawest," and "which are," and "which are to be hereafter," as meaning all things; for the three times, namely, past, present, and future, signify all things; and since the things he was to write were from the Lord, therefore they signify things Divine, since nothing proceeds from the Lord except what is Divine. Moreover, every particular recorded in Revelation, as well as every particular in the prophetical parts of the Word elsewhere, has an internal sense, and the internal sense is in the light of heaven, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord. It is said here, "which thou sawest," and "which are," and "which are to be," because above it was said in respect to the Lord, "who is, and who was, and who is to come." What was there treated of was the Lord Himself; but here things Divine from the Lord with man are treated of, as can be seen from what precedes and from what follows in the series. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="88.">88.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse 20. The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, signifies revelation concerning goods and truths, which are all from Him. This is evident from the signification of "mystery," as being what lies concealed in the vision that John had, but here that vision revealed, since in what now follows it is told what is meant by the "seven stars" and by the "seven lampstands." This is evident also from the signification of the "seven stars," as being the knowledges of all things of good and truth, and thence all goods and truths (see above, n. 72); and from the signification of "in My right hand," as meaning, in reference to the Lord, what is from Him (see also, n. 72). From this it is clear that by "the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest" is signified the revelation of goods and truths, which are all from Him. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="89.">89.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the seven golden lampstands, signifies also concerning the things in the new heaven and in the new earth. This is evident from the signification of the seven "lampstands," as being the new heaven and the new church (see above, n. 62). They are the goods and truths for those who are in the new heaven and the new church, because in the internal sense they thus cohere with what immediately precedes; for things that appear disconnected in the sense of the letter, in the internal sense are continuous (see above, n. 17). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="90.">90.</A></FONT></span>
<p>The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, signifies those who receive goods and truths from the Lord. This is evident from the signification of the "seven stars," as being goods and truths, all from the Lord (see above, n. 72); also from the signification of "angels," as being those in the heavens who are in like correspondent good and truth with those in the church (of which more in what follows); also from the signification of "seven churches," as being all those who are in truths from good, or in faith from charity, thus all who are of the church (see above, n. 20). From this taken together, it follows as a conclusion that by "the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches" are signified all who receive goods and truths from the Lord.  By "angels" are here signified those who in heaven are in like correspondent good and truth with those in the church, because the universal heaven is divided into societies, and the societies are arranged according to the affections of good and truth in general and in particular. These societies correspond to those on earth who are in like affections of good and truth. All these societies are called "angels," and each one is called an "angel;" and a society also when viewed from a distance, and when so presented as to be seen as a one, appears as a single angel (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 62, 68-72). Moreover, there is a complete correspondence of heaven with the church, or of the angels of heaven with the men of the church; through this correspondence heaven makes a one with the church. From this it is clear what is here signified by the "angels of the seven churches," and in the following chapter by the "angel" of each church, where it is said, "Write to the angel of the Ephesian church," "to the angel of the church of the Smyrneans," "to the angel of the Pergmean church," "to the angel of the church of Thyatira," "to the angel of the church in Sardis," "to the angel of the Philadelphian church," and "to the angel of the Laodicean church;" the command evidently was to write, not to angels but to churches, that is, to those who are in such good and truth from the Lord and who are described by each church (of whom we shall treat in what follows). (That in the Word by "angel" nothing else is meant but good and truth which are from the Lord with angel and man, will be more fully shown in the following pages; in the meantime see what is shown concerning the heavens and the angelic societies in the work on Heaven and Hell, since without knowledge of these things from that source, what is said of angels in the following pages can be but little understood; for knowledge must precede if the understanding is to be illustrated.) </p>

<p>And the seven golden&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">91-1</FONT></A> lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches, signifies that all such are in the new heaven and in the new church. This is evident from the signification of the "seven lampstands," as being the new heaven and the new church (see above, n. 62); and also from the signification of the "seven churches," as being those who are in truths from good or in faith from charity (see also above, n. 20). From this it is clear that by the "seven lampstands are the seven churches" all who will be in the new heaven and in the new church are signified.  All things in Revelation have regard to that which is signified by the "seven golden lampstands," that is, to the new heaven and the new church, as to their end and conclusion; consequently, these are treated of in the final chapters. The remaining things that come between are such things as stand in the way, and are to be removed, as what is said of the "dragon" and of the "beasts of Babylon." When these no longer oppose, or when they are removed, the new heaven and the new church come forth and are manifest.             Revelation 2      1. To the angel of the Ephesian Church write: These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand; He that walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands;      2. I know thy works, and thy toil, and thy endurance, and that thou canst not bear the evil, and hast tried them that say that they are apostles, and they are not, and hast found them liars;      3. And hast borne and hast endurance, and for My name's sake hast toiled, and hast not failed.      4. But I have against thee, that thou hast left thy first charity.      5. Be mindful, therefore, of whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; but if not, I will come unto thee quickly, and will move thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent.      6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.      7. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.      8. And to the angel of the church of the Smyrneans write: These things saith the First and the Last, who was dead and is alive:      9. I know thy works, and affliction, and poverty, but thou art rich;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">91-2</FONT></A> and the blasphemy of them who say that they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.      10. Fear not the things which thou art to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have affliction ten days: be thou faithful even till death, and I will give thee the crown of life.      11. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. He that overcometh shall not be hurt by the second death.      12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These things saith He that hath the sharp two-edged sword,      13. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, where Satan's throne is; and thou holdest My name, and didst not deny My faith, even in the days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.      14. But I have against thee a few things: that thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol-sacrifices, and to commit whoredom.      15. So thou also hast then that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.      16. Repent; or else I will come to thee quickly, and will fight against thee with the sword or My mouth.      17. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh, to him will I give to eat of the hidden manna; and will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no one knoweth except he that receiveth.      18. And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, that hath His eyes as a flame of fire, and His feet like burnished brass.      19. I know thy works and charity, and ministry and faith, and thine endurance, and thy works, and the last to be more than the first.      20. But I have against thee a few things; that thou, sufferest the woman Jezebel, that calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce My servants to commit whoredom, and to eat idol-sacrifices.      21. And I gave her time that she might repent of her whoredom; and she repented not.      22. Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those that commit adultery with her into great affliction, except they repent of their works.      23. And her sons I will kill with death; and all the churches shall know that I am He that searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give to each one of you according to your works.      24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say; I put upon you no other burden.      25. Nevertheless, that which ye have, hold fast till I come.      26. And he that overcometh and keepeth My works unto the end, I will give him power over the nations.      27. And he shall rule them with an iron rod; as earthen vessels shall they be shivered, as I also have received from My Father.      28. And I will give him the morning star.      29. He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches. </p>

<p>In the preceding pages it has been told what is meant by the "seven churches" and by the "angels" thereof; namely, by the "seven churches" all who are in truths from good, and by the "seven angels" all in heaven that correspond to them (see n. 20, 90); and since heaven and the church make one by correspondence, it is said in what follows, "To the angel of the church, write," and not, Write to the church. It is so said for this reason also, that there must be correspondence in order that the church may be a church with man; if there were no correspondence, there would be no communication of heaven, thus no heaven, with man; and if heaven were not with him neither would the church be with him. (See The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 241-248. What the correspondence of the man of the church with heaven is, cannot be told in a few words, but whoever desires may be taught what it is in what is said and shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 87-115 and 291-310.) In a word, there is correspondence when man has becomes spiritual, and man becomes spiritual when he acknowledges the Divine and especially the Lord, and loves to live according to the precepts in the Word, for when he does this he is conjoined with heaven; and then the spiritual corresponds with the natural which is with him. I am aware that to many these things may seem to exceed their comprehension; but the reason is that it is not the delight of their love to know them; if it were the delight of their love, not only would they perceive them clearly, but they would also be eager to, know much more of such things; for a man desires what he loves, and what he loves is his delight; moreover, whatever is loved enters both with joy and with light into the idea of the mind. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="93.">93.</A></FONT></span>
<p>The angel of the Ephesian church is the first here written to; and by the angel of that church all those in the church are meant who are in the knowledges of truth and good, thus in the knowledges of such things as are of heaven and of the church, and who still are not, or not yet, in a life according to them. By these knowledges are especially meant doctrinals; but doctrinals alone, or the knowledges of truth and good alone, do not make a man spiritual, but a life according to them; for doctrinals or knowledges without a life according to them abide only in the memory and thence in the thought, and all things that abide there only, abide in the natural man; consequently a man does not become spiritual until these enter the life, and they enter the life when a man wills the things which he thinks, and consequently does them.  That this is so anyone can see from this alone, that if anyone knows all the laws of moral and civil life, and does not live according to them, he still is not a moral and civil man; he may indeed talk about them more learnedly than others, but still he is rejected. It is the same with one who knows the ten precepts of the Decalogue, so as to be able even to explain and discourse about them with intelligence, and yet does not live according to them. Those, therefore, within the church who are in the knowledges of such things as pertain to the church, that is, who are in knowledges of truth and good from the Word, but are not, or not yet, in a life according to them, are here first treated of, and these are described by the things written to the angel of the Ephesian church. </p>

<p>EXPOSITION.      Verses 1-7. To the angel of the Ephesian church write: These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand; He that walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands; I know thy works and thy toil, and thy endurance, and that thou canst not bear the evil, and hast tried them that say, that they are apostles and they are not, and hast found them liars: and hast borne and hast endurance, and for My name's sake hast toiled, and hast not failed. But I have against thee that thou hast left thy first charity. Be mindful therefore of whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works; but if not I will come unto thee quickly, and will move thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. He that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of God. 1. "To the angel of the Ephesian church write," signifies for remembrance to those within the church who are in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word (n. 95); "these things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand," signifies from whom are all the knowledges of good and truth (n. 96); "He that walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands," signifies from whom is life to all in the new heaven and the new church (n. 97). 2. "I know thy works, and thy toil, and thy endurance," signifies all things that they think, will, and do, thus all things of love and faith in the spiritual and in the natural man (n. 98); ["and that thou canst not bear the evil," signifies that they reject evils (n. 99)] and hast tried them that say they are apostles and they are not, and hast found them liars," signifies also falsities, so far as they are able to search them out (n. 100). 3. "And hast borne, and hast endurance," signifies resistance against those who assail the truths of faith, and diligence in instructing (n. 101); "and for My name's sake hast toiled," signifies acknowledgment of the Lord and of the knowledges of truth that have respect to Him (n. 102); "and hast not failed," signifies so far as they could (n. 103). 4. "But I have against thee that thou hast left thy first charity," signifies that they do not make such a life as those lived who were in the church at its beginning the essential of knowledges (n. 104). 5. "Be mindful therefore of whence thou hast fallen, and repent, and do the first works," signifies the remembrance of former things, and thus the remembrance of having deviated from the truth, and this in order that the good of life of the church at its beginning may come into mind (n. 105); "but if not I will come unto thee quickly, and will move thy lampstand out of its place, except thou repent," signifies that if not, it is certain that heaven cannot be given (n. 106). 6. "But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate," signifies an aversion, derived from the Divine, towards those who separate good from truth, or charity from faith, from which separation there is no life (n. 107). 7. "He that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches," signifies that he who understands should hearken to what Divine truth proceeding from the Lord teaches and says to those who are of His church (n. 108); "To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life," signifies that he who receives in the heart shall be filled with the good of love, and with heavenly joy therefrom (n. 109); "which is in the midst of the paradise of God," signifies that all knowledges of good and truth in heaven and in the church look thereto and proceed therefrom (n. 110). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="95.">95.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Verse l. To the angel of the Ephesian church write, signifies for remembrance to those within the church who are in knowledges of truth and good from the Word. This is evident from the signification of "writing," as being for remembrance (Arcana Coelestia n. 8620). It means to those within the church who are in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word, because these are meant by the "angel of the Ephesian church." That these are meant is evident from the things written to the angel of that church. What is meant by the angel of each church can be known only from the internal sense of the things written to each church. It is said, "from the internal sense," since all things in Revelation are prophetic, and things prophetic can be explained only by the internal sense. Who that reads the Prophets does not see that there are arcana therein that are more deeply hidden than the plain meaning of the letter? And since these arcana cannot be seen by the merely natural man, those who account the Word holy pass those things by that they do not understand, saying that there is a hidden meaning therein that is unknown to them, and that some call mystical. That this is the spiritual of the Word is known by some, because they think of the Word as being in its bosom spiritual for the reason that it is Divine. Nevertheless, it has been unknown heretofore that this is the spiritual sense of the Word, and that the Word is understood in this sense by angels, and that by means of this sense there is conjunction of heaven with the man of the church (see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 303-310). Those who are in the knowledges of truth and good from the Word are meant by the "angel of the Ephesian church," because by the knowledges of truth and good are meant the doctrinals of the church, and only from the Word can doctrinals be obtained. Why it is said, "To the angel of the church, write," and not, To the church, may be seen above (n. 92). </p>

<p>These things saith He that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand, signifies from whom are all the knowledges of good and truth. This is evident from the signification of "seven stars," as meaning all the knowledges of good and truth (see above, n. 72); and from the signification of "right hand," as being, in reference to the Lord, what is from Him (see above, n. 72, 79); therefore by these words, "that holdeth the seven stars in His right hand," is signified that from the Lord are all the knowledges of good and truth. It is said that He saith this "who holdeth the seven stars in His right hand, and walketh in the midst of the [seven] golden lampstands," because by "stars" are signified the knowledges of good and truth, and by "golden lampstands" the new heaven and the new church. There is thus prefixed to each description of a church a Divine characteristic that indicates the subject treated of (as to the descriptions of the churches that follow, verses 8, 12, 18; chap. 3:1, 7, 14). It is so prefixed because everything of the church is from the Lord. From this it is clear also why the Lord, in respect to His Divine Human, is described in the first chapter by the representatives that were seen by John, namely, that from these might be taken what was to be prefixed to the description of each church, for a testimony and a memorial that everything of the church is from the Lord, and indeed from His Divine Human; for from this all the good of love proceeds and every truth of faith, and these constitute the church. What immediately proceeds from His Divine Itself does not reach man, because His Divine Itself is invisible and therefore does not fall within the thought, and what does not fall within the thought does not fall within the faith; for everything that is of faith must be thought. That the Son of man, who is described (in chap. 1) by the representatives seen by John, is the Lord in respect to the Divine Human, and Divine truth proceeding therefrom, see above (n. 63). The knowledges of truth and good are here treated of first, because they are the first things of the church; for no one can be initiated into faith and charity, which constitute the church, except by means of knowledges from the Word that pertain to the church (see what is appended to n. 356 of the work on Heaven and Hell from the Arcana Coelestia). </p>

<p>He that walketh in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, signifies from whom is life to all in the new heaven and in the new church. This is evident from the signification of "walking" as being to live, and in reference to the Lord, Life itself (of which more will be said in what follows); and from the signification of "seven golden lampstands," as being all in the new heaven and in the new church (see above, n. 62). From this it is clear that the Lord was seen "in the midst of the lampstands," because "midst" signifies inmost; "lampstands" signify heaven and the church, and "walking" signifies life; and to be "in the midst" signifies, in reference to the Lord, to be in all that are round about Him. By this, therefore, it was represented that all the life of faith and of love in heaven and in the church is from Him (see above, n. 84). (That "midst" denotes the inmost and the center from which, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 1074, 2940, 2973, 7777.  That the Lord is the common center from whom is all direction and determination in heaven, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 123-124. That the extension of the light of heaven, which is Divine truth proceeding from the Lord, from which angels have intelligence and wisdom, is effected also from the midst into those who are round about, see the same, n. 43, 50, 189.) That "walking" signifies living, and in reference to the Lord, Life itself, is from appearances in the spiritual world, where all walk according to their life, the evil in no other ways than those that lead to hell, but the good in no other ways than those that lead to heaven; consequently all spirits are known there from the ways wherein they are walking. Moreover, ways actually appear there; but to the evil, the ways towards hell only, and to the good, the ways towards heaven only; and thus everyone is brought to his own society. From this it is that "walking" signifies living. (Of these ways, and walking therein, in the spiritual world, see what is shown in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 195, 479, 534, 590; and in the small work on The Last Judgment, n. 48.) That in the Word "ways" signify truths or falsities, and "walking" signifies living, may be seen from many passages therein; I will cite only a few here by way of confirmation. In Isaiah:      We have sinned against Jehovah; they would not walk in His ways, neither have they heard His law (Isa. 42:24). In Moses:      If ye shall keep the commandments, by loving Jehovah your God, by walking in all His ways (Deut. 11:22). In the same:      Thou shalt keep all this commandment to do it, by loving Jehovah thy God, and walking in His ways all the days (Deut. 19:9; 26:17). In the same:      I will set My tabernacle in the midst of them,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">97-1</FONT></A> and I will walk in the midst of you, and I will be to you for a God (Lev. 26:11, 12). In the same:      Jehovah thy God walketh in the midst of your camp, and therefore shall your&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">97-2</FONT></A> camp be holy (Deut. 23:14). In Isaiah:      Remember, O Jehovah, how I have walked before Thee in truth (Isa. 38:3). In the same:      He entereth into peace, walking in uprightness (Isa. 57:2). In Malachi:      He walked with Me in peace and in uprightness (Mal. 2:6). In David:      Thou hast delivered my feet from stumbling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living (Ps. 56:13). In John:      Jesus said, I am the light of the world; he that followeth Me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life (John 8:12). In the same:      Yet a little while is the light with you; walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not; and he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. While ye have the light believe on the light (John 12:35, 36). In Mark:      The Pharisees and Scribes ask Him, Why walk not Thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders? (Mark 7:5). In Moses:      If ye walk contrary to Me, and will not hearken to My voices, I will also walk contrary to you (Lev. 26:21, 23, 24, 27). In Isaiah:      This people that walk in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow, upon them hath the light shined (Isa. 9:2). In Micah:      All the peoples walk in the name of their god, and we will walk in the name of Jehovah our God (Micah 4:5). In Isaiah:      Who among you feareth Jehovah? He that walketh in darkness, who hath no brightness (Isa. 50:10); besides many other passages (as in Jer. 26:4; Ezek. 5:6; 20:13, 16; Zech. 10:12; Micah 4:5; Luke 1:6). From these passages it can be seen that "walking," in the spiritual sense, signifies living; and as it signifies living, so in reference to the Lord, as in this passage, it signifies Life itself, for the Lord is Life itself, and the rest are recipients of life from Him (see above, n. 82, 84). </p>

<p>Verse 2. I know thy works, and thy toil, and thy endurance, signifies all things that they will, think, and do, thus all things of love and faith in the spiritual and in the natural man. This is evident from the signification of "works," as being the things that are of the will and love (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "toil," as being the things that are of thought and faith (of which also in what follows); and from the signification of "endurance," as being the things done from will and thought, or the things that these do. But it can with difficulty be comprehended that this is the meaning of these words, unless it is known that all things done by man flow out from the interiors belonging to his mind, also that the mind is the all in everything that man does, and that the body is a mere obedience through which is exhibited, in a form visible before the eye, that which the mind wills and thinks. This is why those external things here mentioned, "works," "toil," and "endurance," signify wing, thinking, and consequent doing, or what is the same, loving, believing, and consequent presenting in act. But still these things are not comprehensible, unless it is also known that man has two faculties, called will and understanding, and that these two faculties are called by the one term "mind;" also that man has an internal and an external-an internal in the light of the spiritual world, and an external in the light of the natural world. (The Will and the Understanding are treated of in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, n. 28-35; and the Internal and the External Man, n. 36-52.) When this is understood, it may be known that by "works," in the spiritual sense, is meant everything that man wills and loves, and by "toil" everything that man thinks or believes, and by "endurance" everything that man does from these.  [2] But leaving these matters, as being, perhaps, too little known about and therefore too obscure to be clearly apprehended, let us advance to this point only, that by "works," in the spiritual sense, are meant all things that are of man's will or love; and this, for the reason that in what follows as to the seven churches, it is everywhere said first, "I know thy works;" as in these verses:      To the angel of the church of the Smyrneans write: These things saith the First and the Last, I know thy works, and affliction, and poverty (Rev. 2:8-9);      To the angel of the church in Pergamum write: These things saith He that hath the two-edged sword, I know thy works, and where thou dwellest (Rev. 2:12-13);      To the angel of the church in Thyatira write: These things saith the Son of God, I know thy works and charity (Rev. 2:18-19);      To the angel of the church in Sardis write: These things saith He that hath the seven spirits of God, I know thy works, that thou art said to live (Rev. 3:1);      To the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, I know thy works (Rev. 3:7-8);      To the angel of the Laodicean church write: These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, I know thy works (Rev. 3:14-5).  [3] As it is here said everywhere, "I know thy works," it is clear that "works" signify, in general, all things of the church; and as all things of the church have reference to love and faith, therefore these are what are meant in the spiritual sense by "works." These are meant in the spiritual sense by "works," because every work or deed or act, that to appearance is done from the body, is not done from the body, but is done by means of the body from man's will and thought, for not a particle of the body moves itself except from the will and thought. From this it is that "works" signify, not the things that appear in outward form, but the things of will and thought. That this is so is known to everyone who reflects. Who that is wise regards a man from his deeds alone, and not from his will? If the will is good he loves the deeds; but if the will is evil he does not love the deeds. He sees the deeds also, but interprets them according to the intention of the will. He who is spiritual attends still less to the deeds, but explores the will; for the reason already given, that deeds in themselves are nothing, but all that they are is from the will, for deeds are the will in act. It is said "will," but in the spiritual sense love is meant, for a man wills what he loves, and he loves what he wills. Man's will is only the receptacle of his love. (See what is said and shown in The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem, on that faculty of man, n. 28-35; and in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 358, 470-484.)  [4] Because "works" or deeds in the Word signify specifically the things that proceed from man's love or will, it is often said in the Word that a man shall be judged and it shall be rendered unto him according to his works; and the meaning is according to works in the internal form, not in the external; as in the following passages:      The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father with His angels, and then shall He render unto everyone according to his works (Matt. 16:27).      Blessed are the dead that die in the Lord: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; their works do follow them (Rev. 14:13).      I will give unto each one of you according to his works (Rev. 2:23).  I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and the dead were judged out of the things which were written in the books, according to their works. The sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell gave up those that were in them; and they were judged everyone according to their works (Rev. 20:12, 13).      Behold I come, and My reward is with Me, to render to each one according to his works (Rev. 22:12). In Jeremiah:      I will recompense them according to their work, and according to the doing of their hands (Jer. 25:14).      Jehovah, whose eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men, to give everyone according to his ways and according to the fruit of his works (Jer. 32:19). Elsewhere:      I will visit upon him his ways, and will render unto him for his works (Hosea 4:9).      According to our ways and according to our works Jehovah hath done with us (Zech. 1:6). Where the Lord prophesies respecting the Last Judgment He makes mention of works only, and declares that:      Those who have done good works shall enter into life eternal, and those who have done evil works into condemnation (Matt. 25:32-46). [5] That "works" signify the things that are of love and faith the Lord also shows in these words:      They said to Jesus, What shall we do that we may work the works of God? Jesus answered, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom [the Father] hath sent (John 6:28, 29).      The night cometh, when no man can work (John 9:4). "Night" signifies the last time of the church, when there is no faith, because there is no charity. (That "night" signifies this time, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2353, 6000.) "Works" are so frequently mentioned, because the sense of the letter of the Word is made up solely of things external, which are in nature and which appear before the eyes: and this in order that there may be a spiritual sense in each particular, as a soul in a body, for otherwise the Word would not be a means of communication with the angels, for it would be like a house without a foundation (see above, n. 8, 16).  From this also it is that when "works" are mentioned, angels, because they are spiritual, do not understand works, but the things from which works spring, which are, as was said above, the will or love, and thought therefrom which is of faith. (This subject you will find more clearly explained in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 470-483, where it is shown that man is after death such as his life was in the world.) "Toil," in the spiritual sense, means all things that man thinks, because spiritual toiling is thinking. And "endurance" signifies all things that man does, because "to endure" here means to be assiduous, and to put away the obstructions in the natural man that are continually rising up and hindering. </p>

<p>And that thou canst not bear the evil, signifies that they reject evils. This is evident from the signification of "canst not bear," as being to reject, for what a man cannot bear he rejects. "The evil" signify evils, because the thought of angels is abstracted from persons; when, therefore, in the sense of the letter of the Word "the evil" are mentioned, angels think of evils; for by "the evil," men who are evil, thus persons, are meant. The thought of angels is of this character because they are in heavenly wisdom, and that wisdom has extension into the universal heaven; if therefore they should think with thought determined to persons, that extension would perish, and their wisdom with it. In this way the spiritual differs from the natural. This is why "the evil" signify evils. (Of the wisdom of the angels, that it is extended into the universal heaven because their thought is abstracted from space, time, and matter, see in the work on Heaven and Hell, n. 169, 191-199, 265-275; and that their thought is abstracted from persons, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 8343, 8985, 9007.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="100.">100.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And hast tried them that say that they are apostles and they are not, and hast found them liars, signifies also falsities, so far as they are able to search them out. This is evident from the signification of "to try," as being to inquire into and search out; and from the signification of "apostles," as being those who teach the truths of the church, and in a sense abstracted from persons, the truths themselves that are taught (of which in what follows); also from the signification of "and are not, and are found liars," as being not truths but falsities; for a "lie" and a "liar" signify falsity (Arcana Coelestia, n. 8908, 9248). From this and what precedes it is evident that "I know that thou canst not bear the evil, and hast tried them that say they are apostles and they are not, and hast found them liars," signifies that they reject evils, and falsities also, so far as they are able to search them out. For in the things written to this church those who are in the knowledges of truth and good, thus in the knowledges of such things as are of heaven and of the church, are treated of (see above, n. 93); here, therefore, it is first said of them that they put away evils, and falsities also, so far as they are able to search them out; for those who are in the knowledges of the holy things of the church need first to know in general what good and truth are, also what evil and falsity are, for upon this knowledge all other knowledges are founded. (For this reason also The Doctrine of the New Jerusalem first of all treats of Good and Truth, n. 11-27, and from these it can also be seen what evil and falsity are.)  [2] By "apostles" those who teach the truths of the church are signified, because the apostles [those sent] were so called from their having been sent to teach and to preach the Gospel concerning the Lord and the drawing nigh of the kingdom of God through Him; thus to teach the truths of the church, by which the Lord is known and the kingdom of God is brought nigh. The kingdom of God on the earth is the church. From this it is evident what is meant by "apostles" in the spiritual sense of the Word, namely, not the twelve apostles who were sent by the Lord to teach concerning Him and His kingdom, but all who are in the truths of the church, and in a sense abstracted from persons, the truths themselves. For in the Word it is customary to speak of persons; but those who are in its spiritual sense, as angels are, do not think of persons at all, but their thought is abstracted from persons, and has respect therefore solely to things. The reason is, that it is material to think of persons, but spiritual to think apart from the idea of persons; for instance, where the "disciples" are mentioned in the Word, or "prophets," "priests," "kings," "Jews," "Israel," "the inhabitants of Zion," and of "Jerusalem," and so on. (Moreover, the very names of persons and places are changed with angels into things, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 768, 1224, 1264, 1876, 1888, 4310, 4442, 5095, 5225, 6516, 10216, 10282, 10329, 10432; and that the thought of angels is abstracted from persons, n. 8343, 8985, 9007.)  [3] That the disciples of the Lord were called apostles from their having been sent to teach concerning Him and His kingdom is clear in Luke:      Jesus sent His twelve disciples to preach the kingdom of God. And the apostles, when they were returned, declared unto Him what things they had done. And Jesus spake to them of the kingdom of God (Luke 9:1, 2, 10, 11). In the same:      When it was day, Jesus called His disciples; and He chose from the twelve, whom also He named apostles (Luke 6:13). In the same:      I will send unto them prophets and apostles, and some of them they shall kill and persecute (Luke 11:49). They are called "prophets and apostles," because by "prophets," as well as by "apostles," are meant those who were sent to teach truths; but by "prophets" those of the Old Testament, and by "apostles" those of the New. (That "prophets" in the Word signify those who teach truths and in a sense abstracted from persons the truths themselves, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 2534.) As the "twelve apostles" signify the truths themselves of the church, it is said in Revelation:      The wall of the New Jerusalem had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (Rev. 21:14). (That by the "New Jerusalem" is meant the church in respect to doctrine, see in The small work on The New Jerusalem and Its Heavenly Doctrine, n. 6; that by its "wall" are signified the truths of doctrine for defense, see Arcana Coelestia, n. 6419; by the "foundations of the wall" are signified the knowledges of the truth, on which doctrine is founded, n. 9643; by "twelve" are signified all truths in the complex, n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130, 3272, 3858, 3913. From this it is clear why it is said that in the foundations of the wall were the "names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.") </p>
