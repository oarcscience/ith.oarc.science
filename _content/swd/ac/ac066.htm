<p>And these are the days of the years of the lives of Abraham, which he lived. That this signifies a state representative by Abraham of the Lord as to the Divine Itself, is evident from the signification of "days" and "years," as being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788); and from the signification here of "lives," as also being states (n. 2904), here, states that were represented by Abraham; for all his life, as it is described in the Word, and the end of which is now treated of, was representative. That Abraham represented the Lord as to the Divine Itself, has been shown in the explications. In order that he might represent, he was called by the name Abraham, the letter "h" being inserted, which was taken from the name "Jehovah" (n. 2010). Abraham represented both the Divine Itself, which is called the "Father," and the Divine Human, which is called the "Son," thus he represented the Lord as to both the Divine Itself and the Divine Human, but that Divine Human which is from eternity, from which came forth and to which He reduced or brought the Human that was born in time, when He glorified it. This is the representation of the Lord by Abraham. </p>

<p>A hundred years, and seventy years, and five years. That this signifies the things that belong to this state, is evident from the fact that all numbers in the Word signify things (see n. 482, 487, 575, 647, 648, 1963, 1988, 2075, 2252); and therefore so does this number, which signifies the things that are of the state now treated of. While the mind dwells solely on what is historical, it appears as if numbers, such as these of the years of the age of Abraham, do not involve any interior sense; yet that they do involve such a sense is evident from all that has been shown above concerning numbers, and can be seen from the fact that in number simply as number there is nothing holy, and yet the least of all the things in the Word is holy. </p>

<p>And Abraham expired and died. That this signifies the end of the representation by Abraham, is evident from the signification of "expiring and dying," as being to cease or come to an end (n. 494); here, the end of the representation. For nothing of Abraham's life which is described in the Word has reference to Abraham, except merely in the historical sense; but everything has reference to the Lord and His kingdom; and therefore when it is said of Abraham that he "expired and died," it cannot signify in the Word (that is, in its genuine sense) anything else than that the state representative of the Lord by Abraham came to an end. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3254.">3254.</A></FONT></span>
<p>In a good old age, an old man and sated. That this signifies something new in the representation, is evident from the signification in the internal sense of "old age," as being to put off what is old and put on what is new (see n. 1854, 2198, 3016). The reason why what is new, or a new state, is signified in the internal sense by "old age," is that with the angels, for whom is the internal sense of the Word, there is no idea of time, thus no idea of such things as belong to time, as the ages of man-infancy, childhood, youth, adult age, and old age. But instead of all these they have an idea of states, thus instead of the time of infancy they have an idea of the state of innocence; instead of the time of childhood and youth they have an idea of the state of the affection of good and truth; instead of adult age they have an idea of the state of intelligence; and instead of old age an idea of the state of wisdom (n. 3183); and as at this time of life man passes from the things of time to those that are of a life without time, and thus puts on a new state, by "old age" is signified what is new, and in this case a new representative, because it is in relation to this with Abraham that "old age" is predicated, and also that he was "an old man and sated," as can be seen from what has just been said. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3255.">3255.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And was gathered to his peoples. That this signifies that these things were concerning Abraham, is evident from the signification of being "gathered to his peoples," as being to be no longer the subject; for to be gathered to his peoples is to go away from those among whom he has been hitherto, and pass to his own; thus in the present case to be no longer a representative. It was customary with the ancients when anyone died, to say that he was gathered to his fathers or to his peoples, and they understood by this form of expression that he actually went to his parents, relations, and kinsfolk in the other life. They derived this form of speech from the most ancient people, who were celestial men, for while living on earth these were at the same time with the angels in heaven, and thus knew how the case is, namely, that all who are in the same good meet and are together in the other life, and likewise all who are in the same truth. Of the former they said that they were "gathered to their fathers," but of the latter that they were "gathered to their peoples;" for with them "fathers" signified goods (n. 2803), and "peoples" signified truths (n. 1259, 1260). As the people of the Most Ancient Church were all in similar good, they dwell together in heaven (n. 1115); and the case is the same with many of the people of the Ancient Church, who were in similar truth (n. 1125, 1127). [2] Moreover while a man lives in the body he is always as to his soul in some society of spirits in the other life (n. 1277, 2379); the man who is evil is in a society of infernal spirits; and the man who is good is in a society of angels. Thus everyone is in a society of such spirits as he is in agreement with, either as to good and truth, or as to evil and falsity; and into this same society the man comes when he dies (n. 687). This is what among the ancients was signified by being "gathered to their fathers," or "to their peoples," as is here said of Abraham when he expired, and of Ishmael in this same chapter (Gen. 25:17); of Isaac (Gen. 35:29); of Jacob (Gen. 49:29, 33); of Aaron (Num. 20:24, 26); of Moses (Num. 27:13; 31:2; Deut. 32:50); and of the first generation that entered into the land of Canaan (Judges 2:10). But in the internal sense of the Word, when anyone's life is treated of representatively, by being "gathered to his peoples" is signified that he is no longer the subject, as before said. </p>

<p>And Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him. That this signifies that the representation of the Lord is now taken up by Isaac and Ishmael, can be seen from the signification of "burying." (That being "buried" denotes to be resuscitated and to rise again, was shown above, n. 2916.) As the representation of the Lord by Abraham is here treated of, as regards this state having come to an end, and that now the representation by Isaac and Ishmael begins, therefore by "burying" in this case is signified the resuscitation of this state; for the significations are determined in accordance with their application to the things of which they are predicated. The case with the representatives in the Word is that they are continuous, although they appear as if interrupted by the deaths of those who represent; their deaths however do not signify any interruption, but a continuation; and therefore their burials signify that the representative is resuscitated and continued in someone else. </p>

<p>In the cave of Machpelah. That this signifies resurrection as to truth, and that in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre, signifies resurrection as to good; and that these words also signify the spiritual, who receive truth and good from the Lord's Divine Human and are saved, as stated above; and also that the field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth, signifies the Lord's spiritual kingdom thence derived; and that there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife, signifies resuscitation, can be seen from what has been before stated and shown concerning the signification of all these expressions, in chapter 23 (n. 2913, 2928, 2968-2971, 2975, 2980); and from the signification of "being buried" (n. 2916, 2917). </p>

<p>Verse 11. And it came to pass after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac his son; and Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi. "And it came to pass after the death of Abraham," signifies after the state and time of the representation of the Lord by Abraham; "that God blessed Isaac his son," signifies the beginning of the representation of the Lord by Isaac; "and Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi," signifies the Lord's Divine rational in Divine light. </p>

<p>And it came to pass after the death of Abraham. That this signifies after the state and time of the representation of the Lord by Abraham, is evident from the signification of "dying," as being, when the representative life of anyone is treated of, the end of the representation (concerning which see above, n. 3253); hence, in this case, "after the death of Abraham" signifies after the state and time of the representation of the Lord by Abraham. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3260.">3260.</A></FONT></span>
<p>That God blessed Isaac his son. That this signifies the beginning of the representation by Isaac, may be seen from the signification of the expression, "God blessed." Among the ancients, when a work was to be commenced, it was customary to say, "May God bless it;" and by this was signified the same as is meant by the expression of the wish, "May it be prosperous and happy;" and thus in a more remote sense, by, "May God bless," as well as by, "May it be prosperous and happy," there is signified a beginning, here the beginning of the representation by Isaac, because this follows immediately after the end of the representation by Abraham, which is signified by his death. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3261.">3261.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Isaac dwelt at Beer-lahai-roi. That this signifies the Lord's Divine rational in Divine light, is evident from the signification of "dwelling," as being to live (see n. 1293); and from the signification of "Beer-lahai-roi" as being Divine good rational born from Divine truth itself (concerning which see n. 3194). Thus the proximate sense is that the Divine rational lived or was in the Divine good which was born from Divine truth itself; but it was not in it; and therefore it is not said "in Beer-lahai-roi," but "at [cum] Beer-lahai-roi," that is, when interpreted, "At the fountain of him that liveth and seeth me," which denotes with that Divine good. For Isaac dwelt in the land of the south, as stated in the foregoing chapter (Gen. 24:62), where we read "and Isaac came from coming to Beer-lahai-roi, and he dwelt in the land of the south;" and as by the "land of the south" in that place there is signified Divine light therefrom (n. 3195), therefore here also nothing else than this is signified. </p>

<p>Verse 12. And these are the births of Ishmael the son of Abraham, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham. "And these are the births of Ishmael the son of Abraham," signifies the derivations of the spiritual church represented by Ishmael; "whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham," signifies the birth of the spiritual man from Divine influx into the affection of memory-knowledges. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3263.">3263.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And these are the births of Ishmael the son of Abraham. That this signifies the derivations of the spiritual church represented by Ishmael, is evident from the signification of "births," as being the derivations of faith, thus of the church (see n. 1145, 1255, 1330); from the representation of Ishmael, as being those who are rational and who are of the Lord's spiritual church (see n. 2078, 2691, 2699); and from the signification of the "sons of Abraham," as being those who are in truth from the Lord; for by "sons" are signified truths (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623), and by Abraham is represented the Lord as to the Divine Human also (n. 3251), from whom the spiritual have truth and good (n. 2661, 2716, 2833, 2834).  [2] As regards the Lord's spiritual church, be it known that it exists throughout the universal world; for it is not confined to those who have the Word and thence know the Lord and some truths of faith; but it exists also with those who have not the Word and therefore are altogether ignorant of the Lord and consequently know no truths of faith (for all the truths of faith regard the Lord); that is to say, this church exists among the Gentiles who are remote from the church; for there are many among them who from rational light know that there is one God; that He has created all things and preserves all things; and also that from Him is all good, consequently all truth; and that likeness to Him makes man blessed; and moreover they live according to their religion, in love to that God and in love toward the neighbor; and from the affection of good they do works of charity, and from the affection of truth they worship the Supreme Being. The Gentiles who are of this character are they who belong to the Lord's spiritual church; and although while in this world they do not know the Lord, yet within themselves they have the worship and tacit acknowledgment of Him when they are in good, for in all good the Lord is present; and therefore in the other life they easily acknowledge Him, and receive the truths of faith in Him more readily than Christians do who are not in good in this way, as may be seen from what has been disclosed from experience concerning the state and lot in the other life of the nations and peoples out of the church (n. 2589-2604). The natural light which these have has in it what is spiritual, for without that which is spiritual from the Lord, such things cannot possibly be acknowledged. [3] From this it may now be seen what "Ishmael" signifies, and thereby who in the representative sense are the "Ishmaelites," namely those who are of the Lord's spiritual church, who as to life are in simple good, and therefore as to doctrine are in natural truth. Such also are signified by the "Ishmaelites" in the following passage concerning Joseph:      Behold, a travelling company of Ishmaelites came from Gilead, with their camels bearing wax, resin, and stacte, going to carry it down to Egypt (Gen. 37:25); where the Ishmaelites represent those who are in simple good, such as is that in which are the well-disposed Gentiles; "camels bearing wax, resin, and stacte," denote the interior goods of such people. The like is signified by the "Ishmaelites" in verse 28 of the same chapter, and in chapter 39, verse 1; and also in the book of Judges, where it is said that Gideon made a request:      That ye would give me every man the earrings of his spoil. For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites (Judg. 8:24); "golden earrings" signify the things of simple good (n. 3103). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3264.">3264.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham. That this signifies the birth of the spiritual man from Divine influx into the affection of memory-knowledges, is evident from the signification of "bearing," as being to come into existence (n. 2621, 2629); from the representation of "Hagar the Egyptian," as being the life of the exterior man (n. 1896, 1909); and from the signification of "handmaid," as being the affection of memory-knowledges and of knowledges that is of the exterior man (n. 1895, 2691). It is said "Sarah's handmaid," because by Sarah is represented the Lord's Divine truth, to which the affection of memory-knowledges and of the knowledges of truth is subordinate. As by Ishmael is represented the spiritual man, it is evident that by these words, "whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham," is signified the birth of the spiritual man from Divine influx into the affection of memory-knowledges. [2] That man's rational is born in this manner, see n. 1895, 1896, 1902, 1910, 2094, 2557, 3030, 3074; consequently the spiritual is thus born, for this is not possible except in the rational, wherefore the spiritual man and the rational man are almost the same, those who are spiritual differing among themselves merely according to the quality of the reason and the consequent quality of life that prevails among them. That their birth or regeneration is from Divine influx into the affection of knowledges may also be seen above (n. 1555, 1904, 2046, 2063, 2189, 2657, 2675, 2691, 2697, 2979). See also what has been stated and shown above concerning Ishmael; namely, that by him was represented the Lord's first rational, which was not yet Divine (n. 1893); that afterwards the truly rational or spiritual were represented (n. 2078, 2691), and thereby the Lord's spiritual church (n. 2699). </p>

<p>Verses 13-16. And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, in their names, according to their births: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam; and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, in their villages and in their castles; twelve princes of their peoples. "And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael," signifies the qualities of their doctrinal things; "in their names, according to their births," signifies interior qualities according to the derivations of faith; "the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam; and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah," signifies all things of the spiritual church, especially among the Gentiles; "these are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names," signifies doctrinal things and their quality; "in their villages," signifies the external things of the church; "and in their castles," signifies the internal things; "twelve princes of their peoples," signifies all the primary things of this Spiritual Church. </p>

<p>And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael. That this signifies the qualities of their doctrinal things, namely, of those who are spiritual, is evident from the signification of "name," as being quality (see n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 2009, 2724, 3006); from the signification of "sons," as being truths, and also doctrinal things (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623); and from the representation of Ishmael, as being those who are spiritual (n. 3263). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3267.">3267.</A></FONT></span>
<p>In their names, according to their births. That this signifies interior qualities according to the derivations of faith, is evident from the signification of "name," as being quality, or from the signification of "names," as being qualities (n. 3266), in this case interior qualities, because it is said, "these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, in their names," where "names" in the first place denote general qualities, and in the second place the qualities which are within the former, or which are interior in respect to those general qualities; and also because these qualities are according to the derivations of faith which are signified by "according to their births." (That "births" signify the derivations of faith, thus of the church, may be seen above, n. 1145, 1255, 1330, 3263.) [2] With the Lord's spiritual church the case is this: It is scattered throughout the whole world, and everywhere varies as to articles of belief, or the truths of faith; and these varieties are the derivations which are signified by the "births," and which come forth both at one and the same time and also one after another. It is the very same with the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens, in which there is variety as to the things of faith, and this to such a degree that there is not one society, nor even one person in a society, that in the things of the truth of faith has an idea altogether in agreement with the ideas of others (n. 3241) but nevertheless the Lord's spiritual kingdom in the heavens is a one; the reason of which is that with all there charity is the principal thing; for charity makes the spiritual church, and not faith, unless you call charity faith. [3] He who is in charity loves his neighbor, and when the neighbor differs from him in matters of belief, he excuses it provided that his neighbor lives in good and truth. He also does not condemn the well-disposed Gentiles, although they are ignorant of the Lord, and do not know anything of the faith. For he who is in charity, that is, who lives in good, receives from the Lord truths of such a quality as agree with his good, and Gentiles receive such truths as in the other life may be bent into truths of faith (n. 2599-2603). But he who is not in charity, that is, who does not live in good, can never receive any truth; he may indeed know truth, but it is not implanted in his life; thus he may indeed have it in his mouth, but not in his heart. For truth cannot be conjoined with evil, and therefore those who know the truths which are called the articles of belief, and do not live in charity or in good, although they are in the church because born in it, are yet not of the church, for there is nothing of the church in them, that is nothing of good with which truth may be conjoined. </p>

<p>The firstborn of Ishmael, Nebaioth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam; and Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa; Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. That these signify all things that belong to the spiritual church, especially among the Gentiles, is evident from the representation of those who are here named, some of whom are mentioned elsewhere in the Word, particularly in the prophetical books-as Nebaioth, Kedar, Dumah, and Tema-and who there signify such things as belong to the spiritual church, especially among the Gentiles; moreover the same is manifest from their being twelve, for "twelve" signifies all things of faith, thus of the church, as will be shown hereafter; and for this reason it is said in the sixteenth verse that they were "twelve princes of their peoples."      [2] That by Nebaioth and Kedar are represented the things that belong to the spiritual church, especially among the Gentiles, namely its goods and derivative truths, is evident in Isaiah:      The abundance of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come; they shall bring gold and frankincense, and they shall proclaim the praises of Jehovah. All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee, the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee they shall come up with acceptance on Mine altar (Isa. 60:6-7) which in the supreme sense is said of the Lord, and in the relative sense of His kingdom. The "flocks of Kedar" denote spiritual good (that a "flock" is spiritual good may be seen above, n. 343, 415, 2566); the "rams of Nebaioth" denote spiritual truth (that a "ram" is spiritual truth may be seen above, n. 2833). [3] That "Kedar" is Arabia is manifest from the following passages, and that Arabia was called "Kedar" from the son of Ishmael is evident from the fact that in both verses lands or nations are enumerated all of which are named from the sons and grandsons of Abraham-as Midian, Ephah, and Sheba (concerning which see above, verses 2-4); and here likewise Kedar and Nebaioth. [4] In Ezekiel:      Arabia, and all the princes of Kedar, these were the merchants of thy hand; in lambs, and rams, and he-goats, in these were they thy merchants (Ezek. 27:21); treating of Tyre, that is, of those who are in the knowledges of good and truth. (That "Tyre" has this signification may be seen above, n. 1201.) "Arabia" denotes spiritual good; the "princes of Kedar," spiritual truths; "lambs, rams, and he-goats" denote spiritual goods and truths. [5] In Jeremiah:      Arise ye, go up to Kedar, and lay waste the sons of the east. Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels (Jer. 49:28-29); where the subject is the vastation of the spiritual church, meant by "Kedar and the sons of the east." "Tents and flocks" denote the goods of this church; "curtains and vessels," its truths; the holy things of worship are what are signified by "tents and flocks," and by "curtains and vessels;" and all the holy things of worship relate to good and truth. [6] But those who are not in truth, because not in good, are those who are represented by the "Arabians and Kedarites in the wilderness" as in Isaiah:      Babylon shall not be inhabited forever, neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there (Isa. 13:19, 20). In the same:      Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up [their voice], the villages that Kedar doth inhabit (Isa. 42:11). In Jeremiah:      By the ways hast thou sat for them, as an Arabian in the wilderness (Jer. 3:2). In David:      Woe is me, that I sojourn in Meshech, that I dwell with the tents of Kedar (Ps. 120:5). [7] In Isaiah:      In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanites. Bring ye waters to meet him that is thirsty; ye inhabitants of the land of Tema forestall the fugitive with his bread. For they shall wander before the swords, from before the drawn sword, from before the bent bow, and from before the grievousness of war. For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Yet within a year, according to the years of a hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall be consumed; and the residue of the number of bows of the mighty men of the sons of Kedar (Isa. 21:13-17). To "lodge in the forest of Arabia" denotes vastation as to truth; "the travelling companies of Dedanites" denote those who are in knowledges (n. 3240, 3241); "the inhabitants of the land of Tema" denote those who are in simple good, such as is that of the well-disposed Gentiles. It is evident that these were called "Tema" from Ishmael's son. "Kedar" denotes those who are in simple truth; of whom it is said that they shall "wander from before swords, and from before the grievousness of war," by which is signified that they will not endure temptation combats, because they are no longer in good. [8] In Jeremiah:      Pass over to the isles of Kittim, and see; and send unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see whether there hath been done such a thing, whether a nation hath changed gods, which yet are no gods (Jer. 2:10-11); the "isles of Kittim" denote those who are more remote from worship, that is, Gentiles who are in simple good, and thereby in natural truth (n. 1156, 1158); that "Kedar" also denotes the same is manifest. [9] In the same:      Then took I the cup from the hand of Jehovah, and made all the nations to drink, unto whom Jehovah had sent me; Dedan, and Tema, and Buz, and all that are clipped at the corner [of the beard]; and all the kings of Arabia, and all the kings of the west, that dwell in the wilderness (Jer. 25:17, 23-24); where also the vastation of the spiritual church is treated of, and Tema and Arabia are named along with several others, from which it is manifest that by "Tema," as by "Arabia," those are signified who are of the spiritual church; but to Arabia are attributed kings and cities, while princes and villages are ascribed to Kedar. [10] Besides these, Dumah also is mentioned in Isaiah (21:11). The reason why by these nations are signified the things that belong to the spiritual church, is that the Ancient Church, which was spiritual, was also among them (n. 1238, 2385); their doctrinals and rituals differed, and yet they were one church because they did not make faith, but charity, essential. In course of time however, as charity ceased, even that which there was of the church with them was lost; yet there still remained a representative of the church by them, with variety according to what there had been of the church with them. Hence it is that wherever they are named in the Word, they themselves are not signified, but only that of the church in general which had been there. </p>

<p>These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names. That this signifies doctrinal things and their quality, is evident from the signification of "sons," as being truths, and also doctrinal things; and of "name," as being quality (see n. 3266). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3270.">3270.</A></FONT></span>
<p>In their villages. That this signifies the external things of the church, is evident from the signification of "villages," as being those things which are the externals of faith, thus of the church; the external things of the church are rituals, the internal things are doctrinal things, provided that these are not merely of memory-knowledge, but also of life. External things were represented by villages because these were outside of the cities; but internal things by the cities themselves. (That "cities" are doctrinal things may be seen above, n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3271.">3271.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And in their castles. That this signifies internal things, is evident from the signification of "castles," as being the internal things of faith; here, of the church, because they are especially predicated of the Gentiles, who had no truth of faith, but only rational and natural truth. These truths are called "castles" when the truths of faith are called "cities." In the original tongue the words that signify villages and castles also signify courts and palaces; and "courts" are similarly the external things of the church, and "palaces" the internal. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3272.">3272.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Twelve princes of their peoples. That this signifies all the primary things of this spiritual church, is evident from the signification of "twelve," as being all things of faith or of the church (n. 577, 2089, 2129, 2130); from the signification of "princes," as being things primary (n. 1482, 2089); and from the signification of "peoples," as being those who are in truths (n. 1259, 1260), thus those who are of the spiritual church, for these are said to be in truths.  That all numbers in the Word signify actual things, may be clearly seen from the number "twelve," which so often occurs. This number, wherever it occurs in the Word, signifies all; as for instance the "twelve tribes" in the Old Testament, and the "twelve apostles" in the New, signify all things of faith, and thus all things of the church. So here "twelve princes" signify all the primary things of this church, and these are represented by so many sons of Ishmael. [2] That "twelve" has this signification may be seen from the passages adduced in the sections above cited, as also from the following passages in the Word. In John:      I heard the number of those who were sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel. Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad were sealed twelve thousand (Rev. 7:4-5); and so on; where by "twelve thousand sealed out of every tribe" nothing else is signified than that all who are in faith, that is, who are in the good of faith, are saved. Again:      A woman encompassed with the sun, and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars (Rev. 12:1); the "woman" denotes the church (n. 252, 253); the "sun," celestial love; and the "moon," spiritual love (n. 30-38, 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495); the "twelve stars" denote all things of faith. (That "stars" are the knowledges of good and truth which are of faith, may be seen above, n. 2495, 2849.) [3] Again:      The holy city, New Jerusalem, had twelve gates, and upon the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. And he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. And he measured the wall thereof, a hundred and forty and four cubits (twelve times twelve), which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls (Rev. 21:2, 12, 14, 16-17, 21); here by the "holy city" nothing else is signified than the Lord's spiritual kingdom; and by "gates," "wall," "foundations" are signified the things of charity and faith; and by "twelve," so often mentioned, are signified all of these things; that neither twelve tribes nor twelve apostles are signified, must be evident to everyone. Again:      In the midst of the street of it, and on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, bearing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit every month (Rev. 22:2); the "twelve fruits" are all things of charity. [4] In Matthew:      Jesus said, Verily I say unto you, that ye who have followed Me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (Matt. 19:28); here apostles are not meant by "apostles," nor thrones by "thrones," nor tribes by "tribes," but all things that are of faith (n. 2129). Moreover in the Word of the Old Testament, where "twelve tribes" are mentioned, it is all things of the church that are signified; and the case is the same with the "twelve stones according to the names of the twelve tribes of Israel" in the Urim and Thummim (Exod. 28:21); and with the "twelve loaves" of the show bread set in order upon the table (Lev. 24:5-6); and so in other instances. That all things of faith are contained also in the very names of the twelve sons of Jacob or Israel, will be seen, of the Lord's Divine mercy in what follows in chapters 29 and 30. </p>

<p>Verses 17, 18. And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, a hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years; and he expired and died, and was gathered unto his peoples. And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria; he fell upon the faces of all his brethren. "And these are the years of the life of Ishmael," signifies a state representative by Ishmael of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; "a hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years," signifies the things of this state; "and he expired and died," signifies the end of the representation by Ishmael; "and was gathered unto his peoples," signifies that these things are concerning Ishmael; "and they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria," signifies the extension of intelligence; "he fell upon the faces of all his brethren," signifies contentions concerning truth, but that he was superior. </p>

<p>And these are the years of the life of Ishmael. That this signifies a state representative by Ishmael of the Lord's spiritual kingdom, is evident from the signification of "years" and of "lives," as here being representative states (n. 3251); and from the representation of Ishmael, as being the Lord's spiritual kingdom (n. 2699, 3263, 3268). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3275.">3275.</A></FONT></span>
<p>A hundred years, and thirty years, and seven years. That this signifies the things of this state, is evident from what was said above (n. 3252) concerning the age of Abraham. </p>

<p>And he expired and died. That this signifies the end of the representation by Ishmael, is evident also from what was said above (n. 3253), where the same words occur, with the same internal sense. In like manner, that he "was gathered unto his peoples" signifies that these things are concerning Ishmael, may also be seen above (n. 3255). </p>

<p>And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria.

<p>Verses 19, 20. And these are the births of Isaac, the son of Abraham: Abraham begat Isaac. And Isaac was a son of forty years when he took Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to himself for a woman. "And these are the births of Isaac, the son of Abraham," signifies the Lord's Divine rational from which is the Divine natural; "Abraham begat Isaac," signifies the Divine rational from the Divine Itself; "and Isaac was a son of forty years," signifies from His own power by temptation combats; "when he took Rebekah," signifies the conjunction of Divine truth; "the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to himself for a woman," signifies the quality and state. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3279.">3279.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And these are the births of Isaac, the son of Abraham. That this signifies the Lord's Divine rational, from which is the Divine natural, is evident from the signification of "births" as being derivations (n. 1145, 1255, 1330), namely, derivations of faith when faith is treated of, and derivations of the church when the church is treated of, just as above the derivations of the spiritual church were signified by the "births" of Ishmael (n. 3263). But here, since the "births" are predicated of the Lord, it is Divine births that are meant, namely, that from the Divine Itself is born the Divine rational, which is signified by Isaac being begotten by Abraham; and that from the Divine rational is the Divine natural, which is signified by Esau and Jacob being from Isaac; for by Esau and Jacob the Lord's Divine natural is represented-by Esau as to good, and by Jacob as to truth-as will be shown in what now follows. This is what is here signified by the "births." </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3280.">3280.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Abraham begat Isaac. That this signifies the Divine rational from the Divine Itself, is evident from the representation of Abraham, as being the Divine Itself; and from the representation of Isaac, as being the Divine rational, as already frequently explained. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3281.">3281.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Isaac was a son of forty years. That this signifies from His own power by temptation combats, is evident from the representation of Isaac, as being the Divine rational, as already frequently explained; from the signification of "forty," as being temptations (n. 730, 862); and from the signification of "years," as being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788). Hence the internal sense of these words is that the Lord made His rational Divine also as to truth, by temptation combats, thus by His own power. (That the Lord by His own power through temptations admitted into Himself made all the human in Himself Divine, was shown above, n. 1616, 1663, 1668, 1690, 1787, 2083, 2523, 2632, 2776, 3030, 3043, 3141.) </p>

<p>When he took Rebekah. That this signifies the conjunction of Divine truth, is evident from the representation of Rebekah, as being Divine truth adjoined to Divine good in the rational, the birth of which from the natural man was treated of in the preceding chapter. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3283.">3283.</A></FONT></span>
<p>The daughter of Bethuel the Aramean, of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean, to himself for a woman. That this signifies the quality and state, is evident from the representation of Bethuel and Laban, and from the signification of "Aram" and "Paddan-aram," as being those things which involve the origin as to quality and state of the Divine truth represented by Rebekah; but what is represented by each, namely, by Bethuel and by Laban, and what is signified by "Aram" or Syria, was explained in the preceding chapter. The reason why these things are again said, is that in the following sections the Lord's natural is treated of. The Lord's natural could not be made Divine until truth had been adjoined to His rational, and until this had been made Divine; for the influx into the natural must needs be from the Divine good of the rational through the Divine truth therein; seeing that all the life of the natural man, as regards knowing and acting intelligently, is therefrom; for the rational is that which ordinates all things in the natural, and according to the orderly arrangement of things therein has them conveniently in view; the rational being like a higher sight, which when it looks into the memory-knowledges of the natural man, looks upon a field as it were beneath itself. The light of this sight is the light of truth, but the origin of the light is from good in the rational. But more on this subject hereafter. </p>

<p>Verses 21-23. And Isaac entreated Jehovah for his woman, because she was barren, and Jehovah was entreated of him, and Rebekah his woman conceived. And the sons struggled together within her; and she said, If so, why am I thus? And she went to inquire of Jehovah. And Jehovah said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels, and the one people shall prevail over the other people, and the elder shall serve the younger. "And Isaac entreated Jehovah," signifies the communication of the Divine which was the Son with the Divine which was the Father; "for his woman, because she was barren," signifies that the Divine natural was not yet; "and Jehovah was entreated of him," signifies the effect; "and Rebekah his woman conceived," signifies that it was from Divine truth as a mother; "and the sons struggled together within her," signifies combat as to which; "and she said, If so, why am I thus?" signifies straitness; "and she went to inquire of Jehovah," signifies a state of communication; "and Jehovah said unto her," signifies perception from the Divine; "two nations are in thy womb," signifies the natural as to interior and exterior good, that there is conception; "and two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels" signifies that truth is thence derived; "and the one people shall prevail over the other people," signifies that at first truth will be superior to the good of truth; "and the elder shall serve the younger," signifies that for a time the good of truth will be inferior. </p>

<p>And Isaac entreated Jehovah. That this signifies the communication of the Divine which is the Son with the Divine which is the Father, is evident from the signification of "entreating," as being to communicate; for entreaty or prayer is nothing but communication; and from the representation of Isaac, as being the Divine rational; the Divine which is the Son is Isaac, that is, the rational when truth is conjoined with it; but the Divine which is the Father here is "Jehovah." This communication was in the Lord, for the Father was in the Son, and the Son in the Father (John 14:10-11). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3286.">3286.</A></FONT></span>
<p>For his woman, because she was barren. That this signifies that the Divine natural was not yet, is evident from the signification of a "woman," as being Divine truth conjoined with the good of the rational, which truth was in the preceding chapter shown to be represented by Rebekah; and from the signification of "barren," as being that the Divine natural was not yet. For the case herein is this: The Divine natural had its origin from the Divine good of the rational as a father, and from the Divine truth therein as a mother; and when the Divine natural is not yet, then the truth of the rational is said to be "barren," here a "barren woman." [2] As regards man, the case is that when he is being regenerated, good is insinuated by the Lord into his rational (that is, good will to the neighbor), to which will or good is adjoined truth from the natural man; but when this has been done, the natural is not yet regenerate, as may be known from the fact that the internal or rational man often fights with the external or natural man; and so long as there is combat the natural is not regenerate; and when this is not regenerate, the rational is barren as to truth. Such is the case in general; and in like manner in every particular in which the rational dissents from the natural, the rational is said in that particular to be barren as to truth.  [3] The work of regeneration is chiefly concerned in bringing about the correspondence of the natural man to the rational man, not only in general, but also in particular; and the natural man is reduced to correspondence by the Lord through the rational, in that good is insinuated into the rational, and in this good as in ground truths are implanted, and then by means of rational truths the natural is reduced to obedience; and when it obeys, then it corresponds; and insofar as it corresponds, so far is the man regenerate. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3287.">3287.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Jehovah was entreated of him. That this signifies the effect, is evident without explication, because when Jehovah has been entreated, the prayer then comes to pass, or is effected. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3288.">3288.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Rebekah his woman conceived. That this signifies from Divine truth as from a mother, is evident from the representation of Rebekah, as being the Divine truth of the rational, treated of in the preceding chapter; and from the signification of "conceiving," as being the first beginning of the Divine natural as from a mother; for, as just said, the Divine natural had its origin from the Divine good of the rational as a father, and from the Divine truth of the rational as a mother. That this is the case is known to scarcely anyone, and this ignorance is the greater because few are aware that the rational is distinct from the natural; for only those know this who are truly rational, and they alone are truly rational who have been regenerated by the Lord; whereas they who have not been regenerated do not comprehend this, for to them the rational is the same as the natural. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3289.">3289.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the sons struggled together within her. That this signifies combat as to which, is evident from the signification of "struggling," as being combat; and from the signification here of "sons," as being the natural as to good and as to truth; for that Esau and Jacob, who were the sons, represent the Lord's Divine natural, Esau the Divine natural as to good, and Jacob as to truth, will become evident from what follows. This struggling or combat is treated of in this chapter, being concerning the priority, as to whether good or truth is prior, or what is the same, whether charity which is of good, or truth which is of faith, is prior. From the earliest times there has been much contention in the spiritual church concerning this question; and because this priority is treated of in what follows, it is said that the "sons struggled within her," and by this is signified combat as to which. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3290.">3290.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And she said, If so, why am I thus? That this signifies straitness, is evident from the sense of these words, in that they are words of straitness, and indeed straitness on account of the struggle, that is, the combat between the brothers; "if so," signifies if they combated about this matter; "why thus," signifies that there ought not to be combat on this account; "I," or, "why am I," signifies that if they combated about this matter they would not receive influx from rational truth; and thereby would come straitness. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3291.">3291.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And she went to inquire of Jehovah. That this signifies a state of communication, is evident from the signification of "inquiring," as being when said of the Lord a communication; for it was Jehovah in Himself who was inquired of; in the historical sense, however, this communication is expressed by "praying" (n. 3285); and the state of communication by "inquiring." </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3292.">3292.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Jehovah said unto her. That this signifies perception from the Divine, is thence evident; and also from the signification of "saying," as being to perceive (n. 1791, 1815, 1819, 1822, 1898, 1919, 2080, 2506, 2515, 2552); thus "Jehovah saying," signifies to perceive from the Divine. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3293.">3293.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Two nations are in thy womb. That this signifies the natural as to interior and exterior good, that there is conception, is evident from the signification of "nations," as being goods, especially the goods of the church (see n. 1159, 1258, 1260, 1416, 1849); and that here the goods which are in the natural are signified, is evident from the fact that Esau and Jacob, who were then in the womb, represent the Lord's Divine natural, as will become very evident from what follows, where they are treated of. The natural, like the rational, consists of good and truth; the good in the natural is all that which is of natural affection, and is called delight; but the truth is all that which is of the memory, and is called memory-knowledge. These two must be in the natural for there to be any natural. By itself, memory-knowledge abstractedly from any delight which is of affection, is not anything; for the natural has its life from the delight within it; and from this derives its ability to know anything; whereas delight, which is the good of the natural, is something without memory-knowledge; but only such a vitality as infants have. In order therefore for the natural to be human it must consist of both, the one being perfected by the other; but it has its real life from good.  [2] As regards this good which is here treated of, it is twofold, interior and exterior; the interior good communicates with the interior man, that is, with the rational; while the exterior good communicates with the external man, that is, with the things of the body, and makes the life in the external senses, and also in the actions. Without this twofold communication, man cannot live either as to the reason or as to the body. It is the interior communication which abides with man after death, and then makes his natural life, for a spirit also has natural life, inasmuch as his spiritual life is terminated in the natural as in an ultimate plane; for immediately after death a man is not able to think spiritually, except from the things that belong to his natural. The exterior communication, however, is that which a man has while he lives in the body, but this ceases by the death of the body. All this shows what is signified by "two nations in the womb," namely the natural as to interior and exterior good. "In the womb," in the internal sense, signifies conception, therefore it is here said "that there is conception." </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3294.">3294.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels. That this signifies that truth is thence derived, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truth (see n. 1259, 1260); and from the signification of being "separated from the bowels," as being to originate thence. In the Word, where birth is treated of, when it is from the mother it is expressed as "coming forth from the womb" or "belly;" but when from the father, as being "separated from the bowels." For the womb and the loins are predicated of the things of love, that is, of good; but when the expression "separated from the bowels" is used, the origin of truth is signified; therefore here, when good is treated of, it is said that "two nations are from thy womb;" and when truth is treated of, that "two peoples shall be separated from thy bowels," whereby is signified, in the internal sense, the origin of truth from good.  "Two peoples" are spoken of, because as good is interior and exterior (n. 3293), so also is truth. Interior truth in the natural is that which is conjoined with the interior good of the natural; but exterior truth is that which is conjoined with the exterior good of the natural; the interior truth is called natural truth, but the exterior truth is called sensuous. But how the case is with these kinds of truths, will of the Lord's Divine mercy appear from what follows, where Jacob is treated of; for by Jacob is represented this truth as to both kinds. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3295.">3295.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the one people shall prevail over the other people. That this signifies that at first truth shall be superior to the good of truth, is evident from the signification of "people," as being truth (see just above, n. 3294); and from the signification of "prevailing over," as being superior. The "people" referred to in the first place signifies truth, but the "people" referred to in the second place, the good of truth; the good of truth being that good which comes forth from truth, and which in its first coming forth is truth, but is called good because it appears as good. Hence it is that by "people" is also signified this good, which in its first coming forth is called the good of truth. In order to have some idea of this good, we must know that before a man has been regenerated he does good from truth; but after he has been regenerated he does good from good; or more clearly, before a man has been regenerated he does good from the understanding; but after he has been regenerated, from the will. The good therefore that is from the understanding is not in itself good, but truth, whereas the good which is from the will is good. For example: one who does not honor his parents, but from the commandment of the Decalogue learns to honor them, when first he honors them, does it from the commandment; and as this honor is from the commandment it is not in itself good, because it is not from love, but is either from obedience to the law, or from fear of the law. Nevertheless it is called the good of truth, but in its first coming forth it is truth; for at that time the man does not do good, but truth; whereas when the man honors his parents from love, then it is good. The same is true in all other cases. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3296.">3296.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the elder shall serve the younger. That this signifies that for a time the good of truth should be inferior, is evident from the signification of the "elder," as being good; from the signification of "serving," as being inferior; and from the signification of the "younger," as being truth. How the case herein is may be seen from what follows, where it is described under the representation of Esau and Jacob; for as before said by Esau is represented good, and by Jacob, truth. That there was struggling or combat concerning priority and dominion, is described in the internal sense by Jacob's taking away from Esau the birthright, and also his blessing; yet that this was done only for a time is manifest from Isaac's prophecy concerning Esau. And upon thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck (Gen. 27:40). [2] That these things have an internal sense, and that what they signify cannot be known without the internal sense (namely, what is signified by two nations being in the womb, and by two peoples being separated from the bowels, and by one people prevailing over the other, and the elder serving the younger), is evident; and that they signify what has been said, is evident from what follows, where much will be said on this subject. Moreover it can with difficulty be believed that these expressions involve such things unless it is known how the case is with good and truth, and concerning the birth of the one from the other, and the change of state in man when he is being regenerated. In the internal sense indeed the Lord is treated of, and here how He made His natural Divine; nevertheless in the representative sense the regeneration of man is also treated of; for man's regeneration is an image of the Lord's glorification (n. 3043, 3138, 3212); that is, in regeneration as in a certain image it appears how the Lord glorified His Human, or what is the same, made it Divine. For as the Lord altogether changed His human state into the Divine, so also in man, when He regenerates him, the Lord utterly changes the man's state, for He makes his old man new. </p>

<p>Verses 24-26. And her days were fulfilled to bring forth, and behold twins were in her womb. And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment, and they called his name Esau. And after that came forth his brother, and his hand laid hold on Esau's heel, and he called his name Jacob: and Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bare them. "And her days were fulfilled to bring forth," signifies the first state of the effect; "and behold twins were in her womb," signifies that both were conceived together; "and the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment," signifies the natural good of the life of truth; "and they called his name Esau," signifies its quality; "and after that came forth his brother," signifies truth; "and his hand laid hold on Esau's heel," signifies the lowest of the good of the natural, to which it adhered with some power; "and he called his name Jacob," signifies the doctrine of truth of the natural; "and Isaac was a son of sixty years when she bare them," signifies the state of the Divine rational at that time. </p>

<p>And her days were fulfilled to bring forth. That this signifies the first state of the effect, is evident from the signification of "days," as being states (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788); that these were "fulfilled to bring forth" signifies the first state of the effect; for in the spiritual sense to "bring forth" has respect to good and truth, and in this sense means to come into existence (n. 2621, 2629). With good and truth the case is the same as with offspring, in that they are conceived, are in the womb, are born, and afterwards grow to maturity. After conception the efficient (that is, the conceived seed) begins to produce the effect, which takes place in the womb; when these states have been fulfilled, and the time for bringing forth is near, then the effect commences, and is called the first of the effect, for then the offspring begins to act as of itself, and to exert itself to attain that very state which is called the state of the effect. </p>

<p>And behold twins were in her womb. That this signifies that both were conceived together, is evident from the signification of "twins," as being both, namely good, which is represented by Esau, and truth, which is represented by Jacob; and from the signification of "in the womb," as being conception (see above, n. 3293). As to both the good and the truth of the natural being conceived together, the case is this: Whatever is born derives its being from a father and its manifestation from a mother; it must have both in order to become something. The natural as to good is conceived from the good of the rational as a father, and as to truth is conceived from the truth of the rational as a mother (n. 3286, 3288). It is good which gives life, but through truth. Both these are called soul, but still good is principally the soul, while truth clothes it as with a kind of tender vessel or body, so that the good is in the truth. This is what is signified by "twins being in her womb." </p>

<p>And the first came forth red all over like a hairy garment [tunica]. That this signifies the natural good of the life of truth, is evident from the signification of "coming forth," as being to be born; from the signification of "red," as being the good of life, as will be shown presently; and from the signification of a "hairy garment," as being the truth of the natural, which also will be shown presently. This being the "first" signifies that as to essence good is prior, as before said (n. 3299); and it is said "like a hairy garment" in order to signify that good is clothed with truth, as with a tender vessel or body, as also before said (n. 3299). In the internal sense of the Word a "garment" [tunica] signifies merely that which invests something else, wherefore also truths are compared to garments (n. 1073, 2576). [2] That "red," or "ruddy," signifies the good of life, is because all good is of love, and love itself is celestial and spiritual fire, and is also compared to fire and likewise is called "fire" (n. 933-936). So also is love compared to blood, and is called "blood" (n. 1001); and because they are both red, the good which is of love is signified by "red" or "ruddy," as may also be seen from the following passages in the Word. In the prophecy of Jacob, then Israel:      He shall wash his raiment in wine, and his vesture in the blood of grapes; his eyes are redder than wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk (Gen. 49:11-12); where Judah is treated of, by whom is there signified the Lord, as must be evident to everyone. "Raiment" and "vesture" in this passage signify the Lord's Divine natural; "wine" and "the blood of grapes" signify the Divine good and Divine truth of the natural. Of the former it is said that "his eyes are redder than wine;" of the latter that "his teeth are whiter than milk;" it is the conjunction of good and truth in the natural which is thus described. [3] In Isaiah:      Who is this that cometh from Edom? Wherefore art Thou red in Thine apparel? and Thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat? (Isa. 63:1-2); here "Edom" denotes the Divine good of the Lord's Divine natural, as will appear from what follows; "red in Thine apparel" denotes the good of truth; "garments like him that treadeth in the wine-vat," the truth of good. In Jeremiah:      Her Nazirites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk; they were more ruddy in bone than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire (Lam. 4:7). By the "Nazirites" was represented the Lord as to the Divine Human, especially as to the Divine natural; thus the good therein by their being "more ruddy in bone than rubies." [4] As "red" signified good, especially the good of the natural, therefore in the Jewish Church, in which each and all things were representative of the Lord, and thence of His kingdom (consequently of good and truth, because the Lord's kingdom is from these), it was commanded that the covering of the tent should be of the skins of red rams (Exod. 25:5; 26:14; 35:7, 23; 36:19); and also that the water of expiation should be made of the ashes of a red heifer burned (Num. 19:2, 9). Unless the color red had signified something celestial in the Lord's kingdom, it would never have been commanded that the rams should be red, and the heifer red. That holy things were thereby represented, everyone acknowledges who holds the Word to be holy. Inasmuch as the color red had such a signification, the coverings of the tent were interwoven and coupled together with threads of scarlet, crimson, and blue (Exod. 35:6). [5] As almost all things have also an opposite sense, as has before been frequently stated, "red" in like manner then signifies the evil which is of the love of self; and this because the cupidities of the love of self are compared to fire and are called "fire" (n. 934, 1297, 1527, 1528, 1861, 2446); and in like manner they are compared to blood and are called "blood" (n. 374, 954, 1005). Hence in the opposite sense "red" has this signification; as in Isaiah:      Jehovah said, Though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18). In Nahum:      The shield of the mighty men (of Belial) is made red, the valiant men are made crimson, in the fire of torches are the chariots in the day (Nahum 2:3). In John:      And there was seen another sign in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his heads seven diadems (Rev. 12:3). Again:      And I saw and behold a white horse, and he that sat thereon had a bow; and there was given unto him a crown; and he went forth conquering and to conquer. And another horse came forth that was red; and to him that sat thereon it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another; and there was given unto him a great sword. Afterwards there came forth a black horse; and at last a pale horse, whose name was death (Rev. 6:2, 4-5, 8). </p>
