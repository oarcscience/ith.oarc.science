<p>Thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk. That this signifies that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state, is evident from the signification of "to boil," as being to conjoin (see n. 8496); from the signification of "a kid," as being the good of innocence (n. 3519, 4871); and from the signification of "milk," as being the truth of innocence (n. 2184, 3183); thus the "mother's milk" denotes the truth of the first innocence. From all this it is evident that by "thou shalt not boil a kid in its mother's milk" is signified that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state. This is the heavenly secret from which this law emanates; for all the laws and judgments and statutes that were given to the sons of Israel, contain secrets of heaven, to which they also correspond. But how this secret is to be understood, namely, that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state, shall be briefly stated. The innocence of the former state is the innocence of infants and children; and the innocence of the after state is the innocence of adults and the aged who are in the good of love to the Lord. The innocence of infants and children is external, and dwells in dense ignorance; but the innocence of the aged is internal, and dwells in wisdom. (Concerning the difference between these two, see n. 2305, 2306, 3183, 3994, 4797.) [2] The innocence that dwells in wisdom consists in the man's knowing, acknowledging, and believing that he can understand nothing and will nothing from himself, and consequently in his not wishing to understand and will anything from himself, but only from the Lord; and also that whatever he supposes that he understands from himself is falsity; and whatever he supposes that he wills from himself is evil. This state of life is the state of innocence of the after state, in which are all who are in the third heaven, which is called "the heaven of innocence." Hence it is that such are in wisdom, because all they understand and will is from the Lord. But the innocence which dwells in ignorance, such as exists with infants and children, consists in believing that all they know and think, and also all they will is in themselves; and that all they speak and do from this thought and will is from themselves. That these are fallacies, they do not apprehend. The truths belonging to this innocence are for the most part founded upon the fallacies of the external senses; and these fallacies must be shaken off as the man advances toward wisdom. From these few words it can be seen that the good of innocence of the after state must not be conjoined with the truth of innocence of the former state. </p>

<p>Verses 20-30. Behold I send an angel before thee, to guard thee in the way, and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared. Take heed of his face, and hear his voice, lest thou provoke him; for he will not endure your transgression, because My name is in the midst of him. For if hearing thou shalt hear his voice, and do all that I speak, I will act as an enemy against thine enemies, and I will act as an adversary against thine adversaries. When Mine angel shall go before thee, and shall bring thee unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite; and I shall cut him off; thou shalt not bow down thyself to their gods, and shalt not serve them, and shalt not do after their works; for destroying thou shalt destroy them, and breaking shalt break in pieces their statues. And ye shall serve Jehovah your God, and He shall bless thy bread, and thy waters; and I will take away disease from the midst of thee. There shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in thy land; the number of thy days I will fulfill. I will send My terror before thee, and I will trouble all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will give to thee the neck of all thine enemies. And I will send the hornet before thee, and it shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. I will not drive him out from before thee in one year; lest perchance the land be desolate, and the wild beast of the field be multiplied upon thee. By little and little I will drive him out from before thee, until thou be fruitful, and inherit the land. "Behold I send an angel before thee," signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human; "to guard thee in the way," signifies His providence and guard from the falsities of evil; "and to bring thee to the place which I have prepared," signifies introduction by Him into heaven according to the good of life and of faith; "take heed of his face," signifies holy fear; "and hear his voice," signifies obedience to the commandments which are from Him; "lest thou provoke him," signifies a turning away from Him through falsities from evil; "for he will not endure your transgression," signifies because these are opposed to truths from good; "because My name is in the midst of him," signifies that from Him is all the good of love and truth of faith; "for if hearing thou shalt hear his voice," signifies instruction in the commandments of faith, and reception; "and do all that I speak," signifies compliance from faith and love; "I will act as an enemy against thine enemies," signifies that the Lord will avert all falsities derived from evil; "and I will act as an adversary against thine adversaries," signifies that He will avert all evils from which are falsities; "when Mine angel shall go before thee," signifies a life in accordance with the commandments of the Lord; "and shall bring thee unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I shall cut him off," signifies when the Lord has protected against the evils and falsities which infest the church, and has removed them; "thou shalt not bow down thyself to their gods," signifies that falsities of evil are not to be worshiped; "and shalt not serve them," signifies that neither are they to be obeyed; "and shalt not do after their works," signifies that evils of life are not to be followed after; "for destroying thou shalt destroy them," signifies that evils must be wholly removed; "and breaking shalt break in pieces their statues," signifies in like manner the falsities of worship; "and ye shall serve Jehovah your God," signifies the worship of the Lord alone; "and he shall bless thy bread, and thy waters," signifies the increase of the good of love and truth of faith; "and I will take away disease from the midst of thee," signifies protection from falsifications of truth and adulterations of good; "there shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in thy land," signifies that goods and truths will proceed in their order in continual progression; "the number of thy days I will fulfill," signifies even to a full state; "I will send My terror before thee," signifies the terror felt by those who are in the evils of falsity on account of the truths of good; "and I will trouble all the people," signifies the dismay of all falsities; "to whom thou shalt come," signifies at the presence of the Lord; "and I will give to thee the neck of all thine enemies," signifies the flight and damnation of falsities; "and I will send the hornet before thee," signifies the dread felt by those who are in falsities from evil; "and it shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee," signifies the flight of the falsities that are from evils; "I will not drive him out from before thee in one year," signifies no hasty flight or removal of them; "lest perchance the land be desolate," signifies a deficiency in that case, and but little spiritual life; "and the wild beast of the field be multiplied upon thee," signifies a flowing in of falsities from the delights of the loves of self and of the world; "by little and little I will drive him out from before thee," signifies removal by degrees according to order; "until thou be fruitful," signifies according to the increase of good; "and inherit the land," signifies until in good, and thus regenerate. </p>

<p>Behold I send an angel before thee. That this signifies the Lord as to the Divine Human, is evident from the signification of "sending," when said of the Lord, as being to proceed (see n. 6831), here to cause to proceed; and from the signification of "an angel," as being one who proceeds; for in the original tongue "angel" means one who is sent, which is the derivation of the word; and by "sent" is signified proceeding, as can be seen from the passages cited from the Word in n. 6831. From this it is evident that by "the angel of Jehovah" is meant the Lord as to the Divine Human; for this proceeds from Jehovah as the Father. Jehovah as the Father denotes the Divine good of the Divine love, which is Being itself (n. 3704); and that which proceeds from the Father is the Divine truth from that Divine good, thus the Divine Coming-forth from the Divine Being. This is here signified by the "angel." In like manner in the following passages:      The angel of His faces delivered them; in His love and in His pity He redeemed them; and He took them up, and carried them all the days of eternity (Isa. 63:9).      Behold the Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the angel of the covenant, whom ye desire (Mal. 3:1); "to the Lord's temple" denotes to His Human. That this is His "temple," the Lord Himself teaches (Matt. 26:61; John 2:19, 21-22). [2] It is said in the church that from the three who are called "Father, Son, and Holy Spirit," there comes forth one Divine, which is also called "one God;" and that from the Father proceeds the Son, and from the Father through the Son proceeds the Holy Spirit; but what this proceeding or going forth means, is as yet unknown. The ideas of the angels on this subject are quite different from those of the men of the church who have thought about it, for the reason that the ideas of the men of the church are founded upon three, but those of the angels upon one. That the ideas of the men of the church are founded upon three, is because they distinguish the Divine into three persons, and attribute to each one special and particular offices. Hence they can indeed say that God is one, but they cannot possibly think otherwise than that there are three, who, by a union which they call mystical, are one. In this way they may indeed be able to think that there is one Divine, but not that there is one God; for in their thought the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God. One Divine is one by agreement and thus unanimity; but one God is absolutely one. [3] The kind of idea or thought a man of the church has about the one God, is clearly manifest in the other life, for everyone carries with him the ideas of his thought. The idea or thought of such people is that there are three gods; yet they dare not say "gods," but "God." A few also make one out of three by union; for they think in one way of the Father, in another way of the Son, and in another way of the Holy Spirit. From this has clearly appeared the nature of the faith the church has about the most essential thing of all, which is the Divine Itself; and as in the other life all are conjoined or separated by the thoughts which are of faith, and the affections which are of love, therefore those who have been born outside the church, and have believed in one God, flee from those who are within the church, saying of them that they do not believe in one God, but in three gods; and that those who do not believe in one God under a human form do not believe in any God, because their thought pours itself forth into the universe, without determination, and thus falls down into nature; which they thus acknowledge in the place of God. When asked what they mean by "proceeding," in saying that the Son proceeds from the Father and that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father through the Son, they answer that "proceeding" is a term of union, and that it wraps up this mystery within it. But their idea of thought about this, when examined, has been found to be that of a mere word, devoid of reality. [4] But the ideas of the angels about the Divine, the Trinity, and Proceeding, are quite different from the ideas of the men of the church, for the reason, as said above, that the ideas of thought of the angels are founded upon one, whereas the ideas of thought of the men of the church are founded upon three. The angels think (and what they think they believe) that there is one God, and that He is the Lord; that His Human is the Divine Itself in a form; and that the holy proceeding from Him is the Holy Spirit; thus that there is a Trinity, but still it is One.  [5] A notion of this is obtained from the idea that exists about the angels in heaven. An angel appears there in the human form, but still there are three things in him that make a one. There is his internal, which does not appear before the eyes; there is the external, which does appear; and there is the sphere of life of his affections and thoughts, which pours out from him to a distance (see n. 1048, 1053, 1316, 1504-1519, 1695, 2489, 4464, 5179, 6206, 7454, 8063, 8630). These three make one angel. But the angels are finite and created, whereas the Lord is infinite and uncreated. And as no man, or even angel, can have any idea about the Infinite except from things finite, therefore such an example may be given in order to illustrate what the Trinity in One is; and that there is one God; and that He is the Lord, and no other. (See further what has been shown on this subject in the passages cited at n. 9194, 9199.) </p>

<p>To guard thee in the way. That this signifies His providence and guard from the falsities of evil, is evident from the signification of "guarding," when said of the Lord, as being providence; for providence consists in providing and foreseeing, thus in leading to good and guarding from evil; because good is provided by the Lord, and evil is foreseen by Him (see n. 6489); and because evil is foreseen, man is guarded from it, otherwise good cannot be provided. And from the signification of "the way," as being truth (n. 627, 2333, 3477); here as being falsity, because it is said "to guard thee;" for he who leads in truth likewise guards from falsity, because falsity infests and attacks truth. That falsity of evil is meant, is because this falsity infests and attacks; but not the falsity which is not of evil, such as is with those who are in good (of which falsity, and also of the falsity of evil, see n. 2243, 2408, 2863, 4736, 4822, 6359, 7272, 7437, 7574, 7577, 8051, 8137, 8149, 8298, 8311, 8318, 9258, 9298). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9305.">9305.</A></FONT></span>
<p>To bring thee to the place which I have prepared. That this signifies a bringing by Him into heaven according to the good of life and of faith, is evident from the signification of "bringing to the place," that is, into the land of Canaan, as being to bring into heaven, for by "the land of Canaan" is signified the church, and also heaven (see n. 1607, 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705, 4447, 5136, 6156); for by the bringing of the sons of Israel into that land was represented the bringing of the faithful into heaven; and from the signification of "preparing," when said of heaven, which is signified by "the land of Canaan," as being from mercy to bestow it upon those who are in the good of life and of faith; for heaven is said to be "prepared" for such; as in the following passages:      Then shall the King say unto them on His right hand, Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world (Matt. 25:34).      To sit on My right hand and on My left hand is not Mine to give; but it is for those for whom it hath been prepared (Mark 10:40).      I go to prepare a place for you; and if I go to prepare a place for you, I will come again, and will take you unto Myself; that where I am, ye may be (John 14:2, 3). For to prepare heaven is to prepare those who are to be brought into heaven, because heaven is given according to the preparation, that is, according to the reception of good. For heaven is in the man; and there is a place for him in heaven according to the state of life and of faith in which he is; because place there corresponds to the state of life; and therefore also place appears in the other life according to the state of life, and in itself is the state (n. 2625, 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9306.">9306.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Take heed of his face. That this signifies holy fear, is evident from the signification of "taking heed of the face," when said of the Lord, who is here meant by "the angel," as being to be afraid lest He be angry on account of evils, or lest He be provoked on account of transgressions; as follows. To fear these things is holy fear (concerning which see above, n. 2826, 3718, 3719, 5459, 5534, 7280, 7788, 8816, 8925). It is said "take heed of his face," because by the "face" is signified the interior things that belong to the life, thus those of the thought and affection, and especially those of the faith and the love. The reason is that the face has been formed according to the image of man's interior things, in order that those which are of the internal man may appear in the external man; thus that those which are of the spiritual world may appear before the sight in the natural world, and so affect the neighbor. That the face exhibits in a visible form, or as it were in a mirror, the things which the man thinks and loves, is known. (That such are the faces of the sincere, and especially of angels, see n. 1999, 2434, 3527, 3573, 4066, 4326, 4796-4799, 5102, 5695, 6604, 8248-8250.)  Wherefore in the original tongue "the face" is a general term employed to describe the affections which exist and appear in a man, such as gratitude, favor, benevolence, help, kindness; and also as unmercifulness, anger, revenge; consequently in that tongue "the face," taken with what it is joined to, means "near to," "with," "before," "for the sake of," and also "against;" thus whatever is in oneself, from oneself, for oneself, and against oneself; for as before said, the face is the man himself, or that which is in the man and shows itself. [2] From all this it can be known what is signified by the "face of Jehovah," or by the "face of the angel," by whom is here signified the Lord as to His Divine Human; namely, the Divine good of the Divine love, and the Divine truth from this Divine good; for these are in Jehovah or the Lord, and they are from Him; nay, they are Himself (n. 222, 223, 5585). From this it is evident what is signified by the "faces of Jehovah" in the benediction:      Jehovah make His faces to shine upon thee, and be merciful unto thee; Jehovah lift up His faces unto thee, and give thee peace (Num. 6:25, 26).      God be merciful unto us, and bless us, and cause His faces to shine upon us (Ps. 67:1).      In like manner in Ps. 80:3, 7, 19; 119:135; Dan. 9:17; and elsewhere. [3] Hence it is that the Lord as to the Divine Human is called "the angel of the faces of Jehovah" in Isaiah:      I will make mention of the mercies of Jehovah. He will recompense them according to His mercies, and according to the multitude of His mercies; and He became their Savior; and the angel of His faces saved them, because of His love, and because of His pity (Isa. 63:7-9). That the Lord as to the Divine Human is called "the angel of the faces of Jehovah" is because the Divine Human is the Divine Itself in face, that is, in form, as the Lord also teaches in John:      If ye had known Me, ye had known My Father also; and from henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him. Philip said, Show us the Father. Jesus said unto him, Am I so long time with you, and hast thou not known Me, Philip? He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father. I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:7-11). [4] By "the face of Jehovah" or the Lord is also signified anger, vengeance, punishment, and evil, for the reason that from the common idea that all things are from God the simple believe that evil also is from Him, especially the evil of punishment; and therefore in accordance with this common idea, and also according to the appearance, anger, vengeance, punishment, and evil are attributed to Jehovah or the Lord; when yet these are not from the Lord, but from man (on which subject see n. 1861, 2447, 5798, 6071, 6832, 6991, 6997, 7533, 7632, 7877, 7926, 8197, 8227, 8228, 8282, 8483, 8632, 8875, 9128). Such is the signification here of "take heed of his face, provoke him not, for he will not endure your transgression." And also in the following passages:      Whosoever shall eat any blood, I will set My faces against the soul that eateth blood, and will cut him off from the midst of his people (Lev. 17:10).      I have set my faces against the city for evil, and not for good (Jer. 21:10).      The face of Jehovah is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth (Ps. 34:16). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9307.">9307.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And hear his voice. That this signifies obedience to the commandments which are from Him, that is, from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "hearing," as being obedience (see n. 2542, 3869, 4652-4660, 7216, 8361); and from the signification of "the voice," when said of the Lord, as being truths Divine (n. 7573, 8813), thus the commandments which are from the Lord. Truths Divine, and the commandments which are from the Lord, are those which are in the Word. Hence also the Word, and doctrine from the Word, are "the voice of Jehovah" (n. 219, 220, 6971). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9308.">9308.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Lest thou provoke him. That this signifies a turning away from Him through falsities from evil, is evident from the signification of "provoking," or exciting anger, when said of the Lord, who is "the angel" here, as being a turning away through falsities from evil; for falsities from evil are turnings away from the Lord (see n. 4997, 5746, 5841). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9309.">9309.</A></FONT></span>
<p>For he will not endure your transgression. That this signifies because these are opposed to truths from good, is evident from the signification of "transgression," as being that which is contrary to the truths of faith (see n. 9156), thus opposed to truths from good, which are the truths of faith. That truths from good are the truths of faith is because faith is of good, insomuch that it is impossible except where there is good. Therefore by "not enduring your transgression" is signified not enduring falsities from evil, because they are opposed to truths from good. (Concerning this opposition see above, n. 9298.) The like is also meant in David:      Kiss the Son, lest He be angry, and ye perish in the way, because His anger will quickly burn. Blessed are all they that put their trust in Him (Ps. 2:12). The Lord is here called "the Son" from the truth of faith which is from Him. (That this is "the Son," see n. 1729, 1733, 2159, 2803, 2813, 3704.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9310.">9310.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Because My name is in the midst of him. That this signifies that from Him is all the good of love and truth of faith, is evident from the signification of the "name of Jehovah," as being all in one complex by which God is worshiped (see n. 2724, 3006), thus all the good of love and truth of faith (n. 6674); and from the signification of "in the midst of him," as being what is in Him, thus also what is from Him; for the good of love is of such a nature that what is in it, is also from it in others, because it has the power of communicating itself. For it is a characteristic of love that it wishes everything of its own to be out of itself in others; and as this is effected from the Divine Itself through and out of its Divine Human, therefore also the Lord as to the Divine Human is called "the name of Jehovah" (n. 6887, 8274).  [2] He who does not know what "name" signifies in the internal sense, may suppose that where the "name of Jehovah," and the "name of the Lord," are mentioned in the Word, the name alone is meant; when yet all the good of love and all the truth of faith which are from the Lord are meant thereby; as in the following passages:      If two of you shall agree in My name on earth as touching anything that they shall ask, it shall be done for them. Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them (Matt. 18:19, 20)      Everyone that hath left houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or fields, for My name's sake, shall receive a hundredfold, and shall inherit eternal life (Matt. 19:29).      As many as received Him, to them gave He power to be sons of God, even to them that believe in His name (John 1:12).      He that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only-begotten Son of God (John 3:18).      These things are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in His name (John 20:31). In these passages, and in very many others, by "the name of the Lord" is signified all the good of love and truth of faith in the complex by which He is worshiped.  [3] Again:      If ye abide in Me, and My words abide in you, ye shall ask whatsoever ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in My name, He will give it you (John 15:7, 16); "to ask of the Father in My name" denotes to ask the Lord, as He Himself teaches in the same Evangelist:      Whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do. If ye shall ask anything in My name, I will do it (John 14:13, 14); "asking in the name of the Lord" denotes asking the Lord, because no one comes unto the Father except through the Lord (John 14:6); and because the Lord as to the Divine Human is Jehovah or the Father in a visible form (as was shown above, n. 9303, 9306). Again:      The sheep hear His voice, and He calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth them out (John 10:3); "the sheep" denote those who are in the good of charity and of faith; "to hear His voice" denotes to obey His commandments; "to call by name, and lead them out" denotes to bestow heaven according to the good of love and of faith; for "the name, "when applied to persons, denotes their quality as to love and faith (n. 144, 145, 1754, 1896, 3421). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9311.">9311.</A></FONT></span>
<p>For in hearing thou shalt hear his voice. That this signifies instruction in the commandments of faith, and reception, is evident from the signification of "hearing," as being to be instructed and to receive (of which below); and from the signification of "his voice," as being the commandments of faith (see above, n. 9307). "To hear," in the Word, signifies not merely to hear in simplicity, but also to receive in the memory and to be instructed, likewise to receive in the understanding and to believe, and also to receive with obedience and to do. That these things are signified by "hearing," is because the speech which is heard presents itself before the internal sight, or understanding, and is thus inwardly received; and there, according to the cogency of the reasons given, or according to the powers of persuasion from some other source, what is heard is either retained, or believed, or obeyed. From this it is that in the spiritual world there is a correspondence of the ear and of hearing with such things (see n. 4652-4660, 5017, 7216, 8361, 8990). [2] That "to hear" denotes to receive in the memory and to be instructed, also to receive in the understanding and believe, likewise to receive in obedience and do, is plain also from the following passages. In Matthew:      I speak in parables; because seeing they see not, and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand; that in them may be fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, which saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive; the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest haply they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart. Blessed are your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear. Many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which ye see, but have not seen them; and to hear the things which ye hear, but have not heard them (Matt. 13:13-17); "to hear" is here used in every sense; in that of being instructed; in that of believing; and in that of obeying. "Hearing they hear not" denotes to be taught and yet not to believe; and also to be instructed and not to obey; "to have ears dull of hearing" denotes to refuse instruction, belief, and obedience; "the ears which are blessed because they hear" denote blessedness from the reception of the doctrine of faith concerning the Lord, and through the Word from the Lord. [3] In John:      He that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. The sheep hear his voice. Those who were before Me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. Other sheep I have which are not of this fold; them also I must bring, and they shall hear My voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me (John 10:2, 3, 8, 16, 27); "to hear the voice" denotes to be instructed in the commandments of faith, and to receive them with faith and obedience. The same is signified by what the Lord so often said:      He that hath an ear to hear, let him hear (Matt. 11:15; 13:9, 43; Mark 4:9, 23; 7:16; Luke 8:8; 14:35). [4] Similar things are signified also in these passages:      Behold a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is My beloved Son, hear ye Him (Matt. 17:5).      He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth with joy because of the bridegroom's voice (John 3:29).      Verily I say unto you, The hour cometh when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live (John 5:25); "the dead" denote those who as yet have no spiritual life, by reason of ignorance of the truth of faith; "to hear the voice of the Son of God" denotes to be instructed in the truths of faith, and to obey them; "to live" denotes to be endowed with spiritual life through these truths. [5] Again:      He that is of God heareth the words of God: for this cause ye hear not, because ye are not of God (John 8:47).      Jesus said, Everyone that is of the truth heareth My voice (John 18:37).      Abraham said to the rich man, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them (Luke 16:29).      They said of Jesus, He hath done all things well, for He maketh the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak (Mark 7:37);  "the deaf" denote those who do not know the truths of faith, and therefore cannot live according to them (n. 6989); "to hear" denotes to be instructed, to receive, and to obey. In John:      When the Holy Spirit is come, He shall lead you into all truth. He shall not speak from Himself; but what things soever He shall hear, these shall He speak. He shall take of Mine (John 16:13, 14); "what things soever he shall hear" denotes whatsoever he shall receive from the Lord. Again:      Everyone who heareth My words, and doeth them, I will liken him to a prudent man; but everyone that heareth these words of Mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man (Matt. 7:24, 26).      Everyone that cometh unto Me, and heareth My sayings, and doeth them, I will show you to whom he is like (Luke 6:47).  "To hear His words," or "sayings," denotes to learn and know the commandments of faith which are from the Lord; "to do them" denotes to live according to them. </p>

<p>And do all that I speak. That this signifies compliance from faith and love, is evident from the signification of "doing what I speak," as being to live in accordance with what the Lord has taught in the Word; for the things Jehovah speaks are those which the Word teaches, thus which the Lord teaches, who is the Word (John 1:1-2, 14). To live according to these things is to comply with them from faith and love. Compliance from faith and love is living compliance, because it has in it life from faith and love. The case with compliance is the same as with every deed of man. In the deed of a man there is nothing living except love and faith. All other things of life, have life from and according to these; for the life of love and faith is life from the Lord, who is life itself. This life is the life of heaven, and of all who become angels. It is the same with compliance. </p>

<p>I will act as an enemy against thine enemies. That this signifies that the Lord will avert all falsities derived from evil, is evident from the signification of "acting as an enemy," when said of Jehovah or the Lord, as being to avert (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "thine enemies," as being falsities derived from evil, for in the spiritual sense these are "enemies," because they continually infest, attack, and endeavor to destroy truths derived from good; for they are opposites. That "to act as an enemy," when said of Jehovah or the Lord, denotes to avert, namely, falsities derived from evil, is because the Lord never acts as an enemy; for He is mercy itself and good itself; and into mercy itself and into good itself enmity cannot enter, not even against falsity and evil. But falsity and evil act with enmity against good and truth; that is, those who are in falsity and evil are against those who are in truth and good; and it is because the former destroy themselves when they attempt to destroy the latter, that it appears as if the Lord acts as an enemy, when yet He only sets His own in safety. From this it is plain how it is to be understood that by "acting as an enemy," when said of the Lord, is signified to avert falsities derived from evil. (As further regards this secret, see what has been shown in n. 4299, 7643, 7679, 7710, 7926, 7989, 8137, 8146, 8197, 8265, 8946.) </p>

<p>And I will act as an adversary against thine adversaries. That this signifies that He will avert all evils from which are falsities, is evident from the signification of "acting as an adversary," when said of Jehovah or the Lord, as being to avert (of which just above, n. 9313); and from the signification of "adversaries," as being the evils from which are falsities, because in the spiritual sense these evils are adversaries against the goods from which are truths. That by "adversaries" are signified the evils from which are falsities, is because by "enemies" are signified falsities derived from evil. For wherever falsity is treated of in the Word, evil is also treated of, just as when truth is treated of, good also is treated of (n. 683, 793, 801, 2173, 2516, 2712, 3132, 4138, 5138, 5502, 6343, 7945, 8339). From this it is plain that one thing is signified by "acting as an enemy against enemies," and another by "acting as an adversary against adversaries;" and that this is not merely a repetition for the sake of emphasizing the matter. </p>

<p>When Mine angel shall go before thee. That this signifies a life in accordance with the commandments of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "going before thee," when said of the Lord, who is here the "angel of Jehovah," as being to teach the commandments of faith and of life, thus also a life in accordance with these commandments (that "to go," and "to journey," denote to live, see n. 1293, 3335, 4882, 5493, 5605, 8417, 8420, 8557, 8559); and from the signification of "the angel of Jehovah," as being the Lord as to the Divine Human (of which above, n. 9303, 9306). That the Lord as to the Divine Human is meant by the "angel," is because the many angels who appeared before the coming of the Lord into the world were Jehovah Himself in a human form, that is, in the form of an angel. This is very evident from the fact that the angels who appeared were called "Jehovah," as for instance those who appeared to Abraham and were called "Jehovah" (Gen. 18:1, 13, 14, 17, 20, 26, 33); also the angel who appeared to Gideon, of whom we read in Judges, and who also was called "Jehovah" (6:12, 14, 16, 22-24); besides others elsewhere. Jehovah Himself in the human form, or what is the same, in the form of an angel, was the Lord. [2] At that time His Divine Human appeared as an angel; of which the Lord Himself speaks in John:      Jesus said, Abraham rejoiced to see My day; and he saw it, and was glad. Verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am (John 8:56, 58).      Father, glorify Thou Me with Thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was (John 17:5). That Jehovah could not appear in any other way, is evident also from the words of the Lord in John:      Ye have not heard the voice of the Father at any time, nor seen His shape (John 5:37).      Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he who is with the Father, he hath seen the Father (John 6:46). From these passages it may be known what is meant by the Lord from eternity. [3] The reason why it pleased the Lord to be born a man, was that He might put on the Human actually, and make it Divine, in order to save the human race. Know therefore that the Lord is Jehovah Himself or the Father in a human form, which also the Lord Himself teaches in John:      I and the Father are one (John 10:30).      Jesus said, From henceforth ye have known and have seen the Father; He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father. Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:7, 9, 11).      All things that are Mine are Thine, and all Thine are Mine (John 17:10). [4] This great mystery is stated in John in these words:      In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. The same was in the beginning with God. All thing were made by Him; and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father. No man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 1:1-3, 14, 18); "the Word" denotes the Divine truth which has been revealed to men; and because this could not be revealed except by Jehovah as a Man, that is, except by Jehovah in a human form, thus by the Lord, therefore it is said, "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word." It is known in the church that by "the Word" is meant the Lord, because this is plainly said: "the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father." That the Divine truth could not be revealed to men except by Jehovah in a human form, is also clearly stated: "no man hath seen God at any time; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath set Him forth."  [5] From all this it is evident that the Lord from eternity was Jehovah, or the Father, in a human form; but not yet in the flesh, for an angel has no "flesh." And because Jehovah or the Father willed to put on the whole human, for the salvation of the human race, therefore He took on the flesh also. Wherefore it is said "God was the Word, and the Word was made flesh." And in Luke:      Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself; handle Me and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see Me have (Luke 24:39); by these words the Lord taught that He was no longer Jehovah under the form of an angel; but that He was Jehovah Man, which is also meant by these words of the Lord:      I came out from the Father, and am come into the world; again I leave the world, and go unto the Father (John 16:28). (That the Lord when in the world made His Human Divine, see n. 1616, 1725, 1813, 1921, 2025, 2026, 2033, 2034, 2083, 2523, 2751, 2798, 3038, 3043, 3212, 3241, 3318, 3637, 3737, 4065, 4180, 4211, 4237, 4286, 4585, 4687, 4692, 4724, 4738, 4766, 5005, 5045, 5078, 5110, 5256, 6373, 6700, 6716, 6849, 6864, 6872, 7014, 7211, 7499, 8547, 8864, 8865, 8878; also that He expelled all the human that was from the mother, until at last He was not the son of Mary, n. 2159, 2649, 2776, 4963, 5157; see especially n. 3704, 4727, 9303, 9306, and what has been shown about these things in the passages cited in n. 9194, 9199.) </p>

<p>And shall bring thee unto the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, and I shall cut him off. That this signifies when the Lord has protected against the evils and falsities which infest the church, and has removed them, is evident from the signification of the "angel" who shall bring unto the nations here named, as being the Lord (see n. 9303, 9315); and from the signification of "the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite," as being the evils and falsities which infest the church; but what evils and what falsities are specifically signified by each nation, may be seen above (n. 8054). For when the sons of Israel had been brought into the land of Canaan, a representative of the church and of heaven was instituted among them, and among the nations a representative of the evils and falsities which infest the church (see n. 3686, 4447, 6306, 6516, 8054, 8317). And from the signification of "to cut off," as being to protect, and thus to remove. (That hell is removed solely by means of the protection of heaven by the Lord; that is, that solely by the protection of those who are in good and truth are those who are in evil and falsity removed, see just above, n. 9313.) </p>

<p>Thou shalt not bow down thyself to their gods. That this signifies that falsities of evil are not to be worshiped, is evident from the signification of "bowing down oneself" as being adoration and worship (see n. 4689); and from the signification of the "gods of the nations," as being the falsities of evil (n. 4544, 7873, 8867, 9283). The falsities of evil are worshiped when worship is done according to a doctrine made up of falsified truths and adulterated goods. This is done when rule and profit are regarded as ends, and truths from the Word as means. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9318.">9318.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And shalt not serve them. That this signifies that neither are they to be obeyed, is evident from the signification of "serving," as being obedience (n. 8987, 8991); and also worship (n. 7934, 8057). </p>

<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9320.">9320.</A></FONT></span>
<p>For destroying thou shalt destroy them. That this signifies that evils must be wholly removed, is evident from the signification of "destroying," when said of the evils and falsities which are signified by the nations of the land of Canaan and by their gods, as being to remove. That "to destroy" denotes to remove, is because those who are in good and truth never destroy those who are in evil and falsity, but only remove them; for the reason that they act from good, and not from evil; and good is from the Lord, who never destroys anyone. But those who are in evil and from it in falsity endeavor to destroy, and as far as they are able do destroy, those who are in good, for the reason that they act from evil. But because they then run counter to the good which is from the Lord, thus counter to the Divine, they destroy themselves, that is, they cast themselves headlong into damnation and into hell. Such is the law of order, as may be seen above (n. 4299, 7643, 7679, 7710, 7926, 7989, 8137, 8146, 8265, 8945, 8946). [2] That the Israelites and the Jews destroyed the nations of the land of Canaan, was because the former represented spiritual and heavenly things, and the nations infernal and diabolical things, which cannot possibly be together; for they are opposites. The reason why the Israelites were permitted to destroy the nations, was that there was no church among the Israelites, but only the representative of a church, and consequently the Lord was not present with them except representatively (n. 4307); for they were in external things without anything internal; that is, they were in a worship representative of good and truth, but not in good and truth. Such people are permitted to destroy, to kill, to exterminate, and to devote to destruction; but this is not permitted to those who are in external things and at the same time in internal things, because these people must act from good, and good is from the Lord. [3] That the Jews and Israelites were of such a character is openly declared by Moses:      Speak not thou in thine heart, after that Jehovah thy God hath thrust the nations out from before thee, saying, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land. Not for thy righteousness, and for the uprightness of thine heart; for thou art a stiffnecked people (Deut. 9:4-6).      They are a nation ruined in counsels, neither is there any understanding in them. Their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of gall; their clusters of bitterness; their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel gall of asps. Is not this hidden away with Me, sealed up in My treasuries (Deut. 32:28, 32-34); in the internal sense "a vine" signifies the church (n. 1069, 5113, 6375, 6376, 9277); "grapes," and "clusters," signify the internal and external goods of that church (n. 1071, 5117, 6378); and "wine" signifies the internal truth of that church (n. 1071, 1798, 6377). From this it is plain what is signified by "their vine being of the vine of Sodom and of the fields of Gomorrah," "their grapes, grapes of gall, and their clusters of bitterness," and "their wine the poison of dragons and the cruel gall of asps." That these things are known to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord, is signified by its being "hidden away with Him, and sealed up in His treasuries."  [4] In John:      Jesus said to the Jews, Ye are of your father the devil, and the desire of your father ye will to do. He was a murderer from the beginning (John 8:44). Consequently they are called "a depraved and adulterous generation" (Matt. 12:39); and also "an offspring of vipers" (Matt. 3:7; 12:34; 23:33; Luke 3:7). That such was their nature was also described by the Lord in parables (Matt. 21:33-45; Mark 12:1-9; Luke 14:16-24; 20:9-19). (That that nation was the worst of all; that when in worship they were in external things without any internal; that there was no church among them, but only the representative of a church; and that nevertheless they could represent the internal things of the church, see n. 3398, 3479, 3480, 3732, 3881, 4208, 4281, 4288-4290, 4293, 4307, 4314, 4316, 4317, 4429, 4433, 4444, 4500, 4503, 4680, 4815, 4818, 4820, 4825, 4832, 4837, 4844, 4847, 4865, 4868, 4874, 4899, 4903, 4911-4913, 5057, 5998, 6304, 6832, 6877, 7048, 7051, 7248, 7401, 7439, 8301, 8588, 8788, 8806, 8814, 8819, 8871, 8882, 9284.) </p>

<p>And breaking shalt break in pieces their statues. That this signifies in like manner falsities of worship (that is, these must be removed), is evident from the signification of "breaking in pieces," when said of the falsities of worship which are signified by "statues," as being to remove (as above n. 9320); and from the signification of "statues," as being the falsities of worship (n. 3727, 4580). </p>

<p>And ye shall serve Jehovah your God. That this signifies the worship of the Lord alone, is evident from the signification of "serving," as being worship (see above, n. 9318). That it denotes the worship of the Lord, is because in the Word "Jehovah" denotes the Lord (n. 1343, 2921, 3035, 5663, 6280, 6281, 6303, 6945, 6956, 8864). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9323.">9323.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And He shall bless thy bread, and thy waters. That this signifies the increase of the good of love and truth of faith, is evident from the signification of "being blessed by Jehovah," as being to be made fruitful in goods, and multiplied in truths (see n. 2846, 3406, 4981, 6091, 6099, 8939), thus increase in such things as belong to love and faith; from the signification of "bread," as being the good of love (see n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3478, 3735, 3813, 4211, 4217, 4735, 4976, 6118, 8410); and from the signification of "water," as being the truth of faith (n. 680, 739, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 6346, 7307, 8568). As "bread" signified all the good of love, and "water" all the truth of faith, in the complex, and as "to be blessed of Jehovah" signifies all increase in these, therefore it was a customary devout wish in the Ancient Churches that Jehovah would "bless the bread and the water;" and it was also a common form of speaking to say "bread and water," to express all natural food and all natural drink, and to mean thereby all spiritual good and all spiritual truth; for these are what nourish the spiritual life, as bread and water nourish the natural life (see n. 4976). [2] Such is the signification of "bread and water" in the following passages. In Isaiah:      Behold Jehovah Zebaoth doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the whole staff of bread, and the whole staff of water (Isa. 3:1); "the staff of bread" denotes power and life from good; and "the staff of water," power and life from truth. In Ezekiel:      Behold, I break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; that they may eat bread by weight, and in disquiet; and drink water by measure, and with amazement; that they may be in want of bread and water, and be desolated a man and his brother, and pine away because of their iniquity (Ezek. 4:16, 17); that "to be in want of bread and water" denotes to be deprived of the good of love and truth of faith, is very evident; for it is said "that they may be desolated a man and his brother, and pine away because of iniquity." [3] In like manner in the following passages:      They shall eat their bread with disquiet, and drink their water with amazement, that the land may be laid waste from the fullness thereof, because of the violence of all them that dwell therein (Ezek. 12:19).      Behold the days come that I will send a famine in the land; not a famine for bread, nor a thirst for water; but for hearing the words of Jehovah (Amos 8:11).      The man of God said to Jeroboam, If thou wilt give me half thine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nor drink water in this place; for so Jehovah commanded, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that thou camest. But the prophet from Bethel told him that Jehovah had said that he should eat bread with him, and drink water, lying unto him. And he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house and drink water; wherefore he was torn in pieces by a lion (1 Kings 13:8, 9, 16-19, 24); that he "should not eat bread and drink water with Jeroboam" signified that he should abhor the good there, and also the truth, because these had been profaned; for Jeroboam profaned the altar and all the holy things of worship, as is plain from the historical narrative of the Word in that chapter. [4] The lack of spiritual good and truth was signified by rain not being given for three years and a half during the reign of Ahab, insomuch that bread and water failed; and then Elijah went to a widow in Sarepta and asked from her a little water to drink, and a morsel of bread to eat (1 Kings 17 and 18); for, as before said, by "bread" was signified all the good of the church, and by "water" all the truth of the church. As at that time such things were represented because the representative of a church existed among them, and because the Word, even the historical Word, was to be written by representatives, therefore the devastation of good and truth was represented by a lack of bread and water. As "bread" signified all the good of love in the complex, the sacrifices were called "bread" (n. 2165); and the Lord also calls Himself "the bread which came down from heaven" (John 6:48, 50, 51); for the Lord is the good of love itself. </p>

<p>And I will take away disease from the midst of thee. That this signifies protection from falsifications of truth and adulterations of good, is evident from the signification of "taking away from the midst of thee," when said of the falsified truths and adulterated goods which are signified by "disease," as being to protect, for when the Lord protects from these, He takes them away (see n. 9313); and from the signification of "disease," as being falsified truth and adulterated good. These are the diseases of the spiritual life; for the spiritual life comes forth and subsists through the truths which are of faith and the goods which are of love. When these are falsified and perverted the man sickens; but when they are denied at heart, he spiritually dies. (That "diseases" denote and correspond to such things, see n. 4958, 5711-5727, 8364, 9031.) </p>

<p>There shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in thy land. That this signifies that goods and truths will proceed in their order in continual progression, is evident from the signification of "not miscarrying, or being barren," as being the progress of regeneration in its order, consequently that goods and truths will proceed in their order in continual progression (of which below); and from the signification of "in the land," as being in the church (That "land" in the Word denotes the church, see n. 566, 662, 1066, 1067, 1262, 1413, 1607, 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 2571, 2928, 3355, 3368, 3379, 4447, 4535, 5577, 8011, 8732.) The reason why "the land" signifies the church, is that the land of Canaan is meant, where the church was, and where it had been from the most ancient times (n. 3686, 4447, 4454, 4516, 4517, 5136, 6516, 8317); and in the spiritual world when a land is mentioned, no land is perceived, but the quality of the nation therein in respect to religion. Therefore when "land" is mentioned in the Word, and the land of Canaan is meant, the church is perceived. From all this it can be seen what is meant in the prophetical parts of the Word by "a new heaven and a new land," namely, the church internal and external (n. 1850, 3355, 4535); for there are internal men and external men. [2] That by "there shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in the land" is signified that goods and truths proceed in their order in continual progression, is because by all things belonging to birth are meant in the internal sense of the Word such things as belong to spiritual birth, thus to regeneration (n. 2584, 3860, 3905, 3915). The things that belong to spiritual birth or regeneration are the truths of faith and the goods of charity, for by means of these a man is conceived and born anew. That such things are signified by "births," is plain from many passages in the Word, and openly from the words of the Lord to Nicodemus:      Jesus said to him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith, How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb, and be born? Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Nicodemus said, How can these things be? Jesus answered, Art thou a teacher in Israel, and knowest not these things? (John 3:3-6, 9, 10); "to be born of water and the spirit" denotes through the truths of faith and the good of love (see the passages cited in n. 9274). [3] That such things are signified in the Word by "births," is from the correspondence of marriages on earth with the heavenly marriage, which is the marriage of good and truth (of which correspondence see above, n. 2727-2759). But at the present day scarcely anyone knows, and perhaps scarcely anyone is willing to acknowledge, that love truly conjugial descends from thence, for the reason that earthly and bodily things are before the eyes, and these extinguish and suffocate all thought about such a correspondence. As love truly conjugial is from this source, therefore in the internal sense of the Word "births," and "generations," signify the things of the new birth and generation from the Lord. Hence also it is that "father," "mother," "sons," "daughters," "sons-in-law," "daughters-in-law," "grandsons," and many other relations derived from marriages, signify goods and truths and their derivations, as frequently shown in these explications. From all this it can now be seen that by "there shall not be one miscarrying, or barren, in the land" is signified that goods and truths shall proceed in their order in continual progression. [4] That "one miscarrying," and "one barren," signify what belongs to miscarriage and barrenness in a spiritual sense, namely, perversions of good and truth, and also vastations and denials of good and truth, is evident from the following passages:      Ephraim, when I have seen it even to Tyre, was planted in beauty; but Ephraim shall bring forth his sons to the slayer. Give them, O Jehovah, a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. Because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of My house (Hos. 9:13-15); unless it is known what is signified in the internal sense by "Ephraim," "Tyre," "a slayer," "sons," "a miscarrying womb," and "dry breasts," it cannot in the least be known what these prophetic words involve. That "Ephraim" denotes the intellect of the church, which is an intellect enlightened in respect to the goods and truths of faith derived from the Word, may be seen above (n. 3969, 5354, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267); and also that "Tyre" denotes the knowledges of truth and good (n. 1201). From this it is plain what is signified by "Ephraim, when I have seen it even to Tyre, was planted in beauty." That "a slayer" denotes one who deprives of spiritual life, that is, of the life from truth and good, may also be seen above (n. 3607, 6767, 8902); and that "sons" denote the truths of faith (n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257). From this it is plain what is signified by "Ephraim bringing forth his sons to the slayer." That "the breasts" denote the affections of good and truth, may also be seen (n. 6432); consequently "breasts that are dry" denote no affections; but in their place evil desires to pervert. From this it is plain what is meant by "a miscarrying womb," namely, the perversion of good and truth. That all these expressions signify things of spiritual life is evident, for it is declared, "because of the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of My house." "Out of the house of Jehovah" denotes out of the church and of heaven (n. 2233, 2234, 3720, 5640).  [5] In Malachi:      I will rebuke the devourer for you, that he may not spoil for you the fruit of the land; neither shall the vine in the field miscarry for you. All nations shall proclaim you blessed; and ye shall be a well-pleasing land (Mal. 3:11-12); by "the vine in the field not miscarrying" is signified that the truths and goods of faith with those who are in the church shall proceed in their order; for "the vine" denotes the truth and good of the spiritual church (n. 1069, 6375, 6376, 9277); and "the field" denotes the church (n. 2971, 3766, 7502, 9139, 9295). "A well-pleasing land" denotes a church that is pleasing to the Lord; for everyone within the church who has been regenerated through truth and good is a church; which shows what is meant by "ye shall be a well-pleasing land." (That "land" denotes the church, may be seen above.) [6] In Moses:      If ye hearken to My judgments to keep and do them, thou shalt be blessed above every people; there shall not be in thee, nor in thy beast, any male unfruitful, or any female barren. Jehovah will take away from thee all sickness, and all the evil diseases of Egypt (Deut. 7:12, 14, 15); that "there shall not be any male unfruitful, or any female barren" denotes not any without life from truth and good; thus that they shall be spiritually alive. As "barren" had this signification, the women in the ancient churches deemed themselves devoid of life when they were barren; as did Rachel, who thus spoke of herself to Jacob:      Rachel saw that she did not bear to Jacob, and she said to Jacob, Give me sons, and if not, I am dead (Gen. 30:1; n. 3908). [7] By "the barren" are also signified those who are not in good because not in truths, and yet long for truths that they may be in good; as is the case with upright nations outside the church; as in these passages:      Sing, O barren, that didst not bear; break forth into singing and shout for joy, that didst not bring forth; for more are the sons of her that is desolate than the sons of her that is married (Isa. 54:1).      Jehovah raiseth up the worn one out of the dust, He exalteth the needy one from the dunghill; to place him with the prince of his people. He maketh her that is barren to keep house, a glad mother of sons (Ps. 113:7-9). [8] In the prophecy of Hannah after she had borne Samuel:       The full have hired themselves out, and the hungry have ceased; until the barren one hath borne seven, and she that hath many children hath failed (1 Sam. 2:5). In the above passages by "the barren" are meant the Gentiles who are summoned to the church, and to whom the church is transferred when the old church ceases, that is, when those who before had been of the church are no longer in faith, because in no charity. This church is what is meant by "her that hath many children and hath failed," and also by "her that is married," in the passage from Isaiah. But the other church, that is, the new church of the Gentiles, is meant by the "barren one" and "her that is desolate" who shall have many sons, and also by "her that is barren keeping house, a glad mother of sons." "To bear seven" denotes to be regenerated to the full; for "seven" there does not mean seven, but to the full (see n. 9228). From all this it is evident what is meant by the following words of the Lord:      The days come in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not brought forth, and the breasts that have not given suck (Luke 23:29); where the subject treated of is the consummation of the age, which is the last time of the church. [9] In the second book of Kings:      The men of Jericho said unto Elisha, Behold the situation of this city is good; but the waters are evil, and the land is barren. Then Elisha said that they should put salt in a new cruse, and should cast the salt therefrom at the outlet of the waters; and the waters were healed, neither came there any more death or barrenness (2 Kings 2:19-21). No one can know what these words infold within them except from the internal sense; for all the miracles related in the Word infold within them such things as are in the Lord's kingdom, or in the church (n. 7337, 7465, 8364, 9086); and therefore it is necessary to know what was represented by Elisha, what was signified by the city of Jericho, what by the evil waters and the barren land, what by a new cruse and the salt in it, and also what by the outlet of the waters into which they were to cast the salt. That Elisha represented the Lord as to the Word, see n. 2762; that "waters" signify the truths of faith, n. 28, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 5668, 6346, 7307, 8137, 8138, 8568; thus "evil waters" signify truths without good, and "a barren land" signifies the good of the church consequently not alive; "a new cruse," that is, a new vessel, signifies knowledges of good and truth (n. 3068, 3079, 3316, 3318); "salt" signifies the longing of truth for good (n. 9207); "the outlet of the waters" signifies the natural of man which receives the knowledges of truth and good, and which is amended by the longing of truth for good. [10] From all this it is evident that this miracle infolded within it the amendment of the church and of the life by the Lord through the Word, and through the consequent longing of truth for good; which amendment is effected when from such a longing the man's natural receives truths from the Word. That this took place near the city of Jericho, was because this city was situated not far from the Jordan; and by "the Jordan" is signified that in the man of the church which first receives truths, thus the natural (n. 1585, 4255). That it is man's natural which first receives truths out of the Word from the Lord, and that it is the last to be regenerated, and that when it has been regenerated, the whole man is regenerated, was signified by the Lord's words to Peter, when He washed the disciples' feet:      Jesus said, He that is washed needeth not save to have his feet washed, and is clean every whit (John 13:10); (that the "feet" denote the things of the natural man, and in general the natural itself, see n. 2162, 3147, 3761, 3986, 4280, 4938-4952, 5327, 5328). (That for a man to be regenerated, the natural or external man must be in correspondence with the spiritual or internal man; thus that he is not regenerate until the natural has been regenerated, see n. 2850, 3167, 3286, 3321, 3470, 3493, 3508, 3509, 3518, 3573, 3576, 3579, 3620, 3623, 3671, 3882, 3969, 4353, 4588, 4612, 4618, 5168, 5326, 5373, 5651, 6299, 6454, 7442, 7443, 8742-8747, 9043, 9046, 9061.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9326.">9326.</A></FONT></span>
<p>The number of thy days I will fulfill. That this signifies even to a full state, is evident from the signification of "days," as being states of life (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462, 3785, 4850, 5672, 5962, 6110, 7680, 8426); here states of the new, or spiritual life, which is the life of one who has been regenerated; and from the signification of "fulfilling the number," as being to the full. "Even to a full state" means even until the man has been regenerated. That truths and goods will advance in a continual progression up to this point, is signified by the words, "there shall not be one miscarrying or barren in the land" (of which just above, n. 9325). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9327.">9327.</A></FONT></span>
<p>I will send My terror before thee. That this signifies the terror of those who are in the evils of falsity, on account of the truths of good, is evident from the signification of "terror," as being the terror of those who are in the evils of falsity; and from the signification of "the sons of Israel," before whom the terror was to be sent, as being those who are in spiritual good, that is, in the truth of good (see n. 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5820, 5833, 7957, 8234, 8805). (That the nations of the land of Canaan to whom terror was sent on account of the sons of Israel, signify the evils of falsity and the falsities of evil, see n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 1573, 1574, 1868, 4517, 6306, 8065, 8317.) Therefore by the words, "I will send My terror before thee" is signified the terror of those who are in the evils of falsity on account of the truths of good.  [2] The case herein is this. All power in the spiritual world is from the truths which are from good, thus from the truths which proceed from the Lord. This can be plainly seen from the fact that the Lord disposes all things in heaven, and all things in hell, and also all things in the world, by means of the truths which are from Himself; for the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is that very thing through which all things have come into existence, and through which all things subsist. That this is so is not comprehended by those who think solely from what is material, as those think who ascribe the origin and maintenance of all things to nature. These can have no idea about truths except that they are devoid of power, being matters of mere thought, concerning which they perceive nothing essential, and still less anything substantial; although they know that the thought directs the whole body, and excites its parts to motion, precisely in accordance with its own quality; likewise that there is nothing in the universe that does not bear relation to the truth which is from good. (That it is truth which has all power, and which is the veriest essential, see n. 8200.) From all this it is evident that the angels have power from the truth Divine which is from the Lord, and that from this they are called "powers." The nature of the power possessed by truths from good, that is, truths from the Lord, may be seen from the experience recorded concerning the arm, which corresponds to such truth, in n. 4932-4935. [3] Seeing that truth has all power, it follows that falsity from evil has no power whatever, because it is the privation of truth from good, thus the privation of power. Consequently they who are in hell-all there being in falsities from evil-have no power whatever; and therefore thousands of them can be driven away, cast down, and dispersed by one angel of heaven, much as a mote in the air is driven away by the breath of the mouth. From all this it can be seen why those who are in the evils of falsity feel terror on account of the truths of good. This terror is called "the terror of God" (Gen. 35:5; Job 13:21). And in these passages:      I will put My terror in the land of the living; when he shall be made to lie down in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all his multitude (Ezek. 32:32).      If he shall reject My statutes, and if your soul shall abhor My judgments, so that ye will not do all My commandments, I will send dismay into their hearts, that the sound of a driven leaf may chase them; and they may flee as one fleeth from the sword; and may fall when none pursueth (Lev. 26:15, 36); here is described the terror of those who are in the evils of falsity, and in the falsities of evil. It is said that "the sound of a leaf shall chase them, and they shall flee as one fleeth from the sword" because "leaf" signifies truth (n. 885), and "sword" signifies truth fighting against the falsity of evil (n. 2799, 6353, 8294). That such have no power whatever against truth, is signified by "they shall fall when none pursueth." </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9328.">9328.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And I will trouble all the people. That this signifies the dismay of all falsities, is evident from the signification of "troubling," as being dismay (of which below); and from the signification of "the people," as being those who are in truths, thus, speaking abstractedly, truths, and in the opposite sense falsities (n. 1259, 1260, 2928, 3295, 3581, 6232). The reason why "troubling" signifies dismay, is that those who are in dismay are so troubled in mind and heart that they become insane, and of themselves rush into destruction. That such dismay is signified by "troubling," is evident in Zechariah:      In that day there shall be a great troubling from Jehovah among those who fight against Jerusalem; and they shall lay hold every one of the hand of his companion, and his hand shall rise up upon the hand of his companion (Zech. 14:13); "to fight against Jerusalem" denotes against the church, thus against the truths and goods of faith that make the church; that the "great troubling" denotes dismay even to insanity, is evident. In Moses:      Jehovah thy God shall give up the nations before thee, and shall trouble them with a very great troubling, until they be destroyed (Deut. 7:23); "a great troubling" denotes dismay. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9329.">9329.</A></FONT></span>
<p>To whom thou shalt come. That this signifies at the presence of the Lord, is evident from the signification of "coming to" anyone, as being presence (see n. 5934, 6063, 6089, 7498, 7631). That the presence of the Lord is signified is because the subject treated of is the power of truth against evils and falsities; and all truth and its power are from the Lord. Moreover, "the sons of Israel," of whom this is said, signify the truths which are from the Lord, that is, spiritual truths (n. 5414, 5879, 5951, 7957, 8234, 8805). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9330.">9330.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And I will give to thee the neck of all thine enemies. That this signifies the flight and damnation of falsities, is evident from the signification of "enemies," as being falsities from evil (see n. 9313, 9314); and from the signification of "giving the neck," as being flight. That it signifies damnation also, is because when those who are in falsities from evil flee from truths from good, they cast themselves into hell, that is, into damnation. [2] The case herein is this. In the other life those who are in falsities from evil fight first against those who are in truths from good. The reason why they are permitted to fight is in order that good may come out of it. The good that comes out of it is that those who are in truths from good are thereby confirmed in truths against falsities, and that those who are in falsities from evil are confirmed in falsities, and devastate themselves; for in the other life falsities are removed from those who are in truths from good, and truths are removed from those who are in falsities from evil. In this way those who are in truths from good are raised into heaven, and those who are in falsities from evil sink down into hell; and when they are in hell, they are in terror and dismay because of truths from good, in which are the angels from the Lord. [3] That such a state awaits those who are in falsities from evil, and those who are in truths from good, the Lord teaches in these passages:      Whosoever hath, to him shall be given, that he may have more abundantly; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away (Matt. 13:12).      Take from him the pound, and give it to him that hath the ten pounds. They said, Lord, he hath ten pounds. I say unto you, that unto everyone that hath shall be given; but from him that hath not, even that which he hath shall be taken away from him (Luke 19:24-26). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9331.">9331.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And I will send the hornet before thee. That this signifies the dread felt by those who are in the falsities of evil, is evident from the signification of "hornets," as being stinging and deadly falsities, and hence such as excite dread. "Terror" is predicated of those who are in evils; and "dread" of those who are in falsities (as regards the terror of the former, see above, n. 9327). That "hornets" signify the dread felt by those who are in falsities, is because they are winged, and furnished with stings, with which they inflict poisoned wounds. For both the larger and the smaller animals signify such things as are of the affections, that is, which bear relation to the will; or else they signify such things as are of the thoughts, that is, which bear relation to the understanding. For all things whatsoever in man bear relation either to his will or to his understanding; and those things which bear no relation either to the one or to the other are not in the man, thus are not of the man. Those animals which walk, and also those which creep, signify the affections in both senses; thus goods or evils, for these are of the affections. But those animals which fly, and also winged insects, signify such things as are of the thoughts in both senses; thus truths or falsities, for these are of the thoughts. That "animals" signify goods, or evils, see n. 9280; that "creeping things" signify the same in the external sensuous, n. 746, 909, 994; that "flying things" signify truths or falsities, n. 40, 745, 776, 778, 866, 988, 3219, 5149, 7441; consequently winged insects signify the like things, but in man's extremes.  [2] But the falsities now treated of are of many kinds; there are falsities which do not injure, there are falsities which injure slightly, there are those which injure grievously, and there are also those which kill. Their kind is known from the evils they spring from; for every falsity that injures, or kills, springs from evil; because falsity from evil is evil appearing in a form. Moreover, in the other life, when such falsities are represented in a visible form, they appear as a swarm of insects and of unclean flying things, the appearance of which is terrible, according to the kind of evil from which they spring. From all this it is evident why "hornets" signify the dread felt by those who are in the falsities of evil. In like manner in Deuteronomy:      Jehovah thy God will send the hornet among them, until they that are left, and those hidden before thee, perish (Deut. 7:20). [3] In the Word throughout mention is made of insects of various kinds, and they everywhere signify falsities or evils in the extremes (that is, in man's external sensuous), which are evils and falsities arising from the fallacies of the senses, and from various pleasures and appetites in the body, which seduce by their allurements and their appearances, and cause the rational to assent, and thus to be immersed in falsities from evil. (That falsities of this kind are signified by the "noisome flies" of Egypt, see n. 7441; likewise by the "locusts" there, n. 7643; and that by the "frogs" of Egypt are signified reasonings from falsities, n. 7351, 7352, 7384; by the "lice" there, evils of the same kind, n. 7419; and that by "worms" are signified falsities which consume and torment, n. 8481). [4] Such evils and falsities are also signified by insects of various kinds in the following passages. In Isaiah:      It shall come to pass in that day that Jehovah shall hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. And they shall all come and rest in the river of desolations and in the clefts of the rocks, and in all shrubs (Isa. 7:18, 19); the subject here treated of is the coming of the Lord, and the state of the church at that time. "The fly in the uttermost part of the rivers of Egypt" denotes falsity in the extremes, that is, in man's external sensuous (n. 7441); "the bee in the land of Assyria" denotes the falsity which perverts the reasonings of the mind, for "Assyria" denotes reasoning (n. 1186); "the river of desolations" denotes falsity reigning everywhere; "the clefts of the rock" denote the truths of faith in obscurity, because removed from the light of heaven (see n. 8581); the "shrubs" denote nascent truths of a similar kind (n. 2682). [5] Again:      I have smitten you with blasting and mildew; your many gardens, and your vineyards, and your fig-trees, and your olive-trees, hath the caterpillar devoured (Amos 4:9).      That which the caterpillar hath left shall the locust eat; and that which the locust hath left shall the cankerworm eat; and that which the cankerworm hath left shall the bruchus eat. Awake, ye drunkards; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the must which is cut off from your mouth (Joel 1:4-5).      The floors are full of clean grain, the presses overflow with must and oil. And I will compensate to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the bruchus, and the caterpillar, My great army which I have sent among you (Joel 2:24, 25). That falsities and evils in the extremes-that is, in the external sensuous of the man of the church-are signified by the kinds of insects here mentioned, is evident from these various expressions, for the subject treated of is the perversion of the truth and good of the church. (What is signified by the "locust" and the "bruchus," see n. 7643; and that by "gardens," "vineyards," "fig-trees," "olive-trees," "wine," and "must," which are destroyed by such insects, are signified the goods and truths of the church in general, has often been shown in these explications.) [6] In David:      He made frogs to creep forth in their land, in the chambers of their kings. He said that there should come filthy swarms, lice in all their border (Ps. 105:30, 31); speaking of Egypt (what is meant by the "frogs" there, see n. 7351, 7352, 7384; and what by the "lice," n. 7419). In Moses:      Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but thou shalt not drink the wine, nor gather, for the worm shall eat it (Deut. 28:39); "the worm" denotes all such falsity and evil in general. [7] In Isaiah:      Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye dismayed at their revilings; for the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the blatta shall eat them like wool (Isa. 51:7, 8); "the moth" denotes the falsities in man's extremes; and "the blatta," the evils therein; for "the garment which the moth shall eat" signifies the lower or more external truths which belong to the sensuous of man (see n. 2576, 5248, 6377, 6918, 9158, 9212), and "the wool which the blatta shall eat" signifies the lower or more external goods which belong to the sensuous of man, as is evident from many passages, and also from the signification of "a sheep," from which wool comes, as being the good of charity (see n. 4169). (What, and of what quality, are the extremes of the natural man, which are called his sensuous things, see n. 4009, 5077, 5081, 5089, 5094, 5125, 5128, 5580, 5767, 5774, 6183, 6201, 6310-6318, 6564, 6598, 6612, 6614, 6622, 6624, 6844, 6845, 6948, 6949, 7442, 7645, 7693, 9212, 9216.) </p>

<p>And it shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before thee. That this signifies the flight of the falsities that are from evils, is evident from the signification of "driving out," as being to put to flight, thus flight; and from the signification of "the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite," as being falsities from evils-"the Hivite," falsity from a lighter evil (n. 6860); "the Canaanite," falsity from a more grievous evil (n. 4818, 8054); and "the Hittite," falsity from the most grievous evil (n. 2913, 6858). (That by the nations in the land of Canaan are signified all falsities and evils in the complex, see the passages cited in n. 9327.) </p>

<p>I will not drive him out from before thee in one year. That this signifies no hasty flight or removal of them, namely, of the falsities and evils which are signified by the nations in the land of Canaan, is evident from the signification of "driving out," as being flight, for in the other life those who are in evils and falsities are not driven out, but flee of themselves (that removal also is signified will be seen below); and from the signification of "in one year," as being what is hasty; for the words follow, "by little and little I will drive him out from before thee," by which is signified removal by degrees according to order.  [2] That when predicated of evils and falsities, "to drive out" denotes removal, is because falsities and evils are not driven out from a man, but are removed. He who does not know how the case is with man's liberation from evils and falsities, or with the forgiveness of his sins, may believe that sins are wiped away when they are said to be forgiven. This belief comes from the literal sense of the Word, where such an expression is sometimes used, giving rise in the minds of many to the error that after they have received absolution they are righteous and pure. But these people know nothing whatever about the way in which sins are forgiven; namely, that a man is not purified from them; but is withheld from them by the Lord when he is of such a character that he can be kept in good and truth; and that he can be kept in good and truth when he has been regenerated; for he has then acquired a life of the good of charity and the truth of faith. For whatever a man, from his earliest infancy, thinks, wills, speaks, and does, is added to his life and makes it. These things cannot be exterminated, but only removed, and when they are removed, the man appears as if he were devoid of sins, because they have been removed (n. 8393, 8988, 9014). In accordance with the appearance that man thinks and does what is good and true from himself, when yet it is not from himself but from the Lord, it has been said in the Word that he is "clean" from sins, and also "righteous;" as in Isaiah:      Though your sins have been as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they have been red like crimson, they shall be as wool (Isa. 1:18); and in many other passages. [3] That such is the case has been granted me to know from the state of souls in the other life. Everyone brings with him there from the world all things of his life, that is, whatsoever he has thought, wished, spoken, and done; and even whatever he has seen and heard from his infancy down to the end of his life in the world, insomuch that there is not even the smallest thing lacking (n. 2474). Those who in the world have lived a life of faith and charity, can then be withheld from evils and kept in good, and thus be raised into heaven. But those who in the world have not led a life of faith and charity, but a life of the love of self and of the love of the world, sink down into hell, because they cannot be withheld from evils and kept in good. From all this it is evident why, when "driving out" is said in relation to falsities and evils, it denotes removal. In this verse and the next this removal is treated of in the internal sense, and its arcana are there disclosed. </p>

<p>Lest perchance the land be desolate. That this signifies a deficiency in that case, and but little spiritual life-namely, if the removal should be hasty-is evident from the signification of "the land," as being the church in general and also in particular. The church in particular is the man who becomes a church; for the church is in man, and is the regenerated man. (That "the land" denotes the church in general, see n. 9325; and that it denotes the church in particular, or the regenerated man, n. 82, 620, 636, 913, 1411, 1733, 2117, 2118e, 2571, 3368, 3379.) A regenerate man is called "a land" also in Malachi:      All nations shall proclaim you blessed, for ye shall be a well-pleasing land (Mal. 3:12). And from the signification of "desolate," as being a deficiency and but little of spiritual life; for by "desolate," when said of the church in man, is signified a lack of truth and of good, thus also a lack of spiritual life; for spiritual life is thence derived. [2] In regard to there being a deficiency and but little of spiritual life if falsities and evils were hastily removed, the case is this. When a man is being regenerated, which is effected by the implanting of spiritual truth and good, and by the removal at the same time of falsity and evil, he is not regenerated hastily, but slowly. The reason is that all things the man, from his infancy, has thought, intended, and done, have added themselves to his life, and have made it, and likewise have formed such a connection among themselves that no one thing can be taken away unless all are taken away at the same time. For an evil man is an image of hell, and a good man is an image of heaven; and the evils and falsities with an evil man have such a connection among themselves as there is among the infernal societies, of which he is a part; and the goods and truths with a good man have such a connection among themselves as there is among the heavenly societies, of which he is a part. From this it is evident that the evils and falsities with an evil man cannot be removed from their place suddenly; but only in proportion as goods and truths are implanted in their order, and interiorly; for heaven in a man removes hell from him. If this were done suddenly, the man would fail; for each and all things that are in connection and form would be disturbed, and would take away his life. [3] (That regeneration, or the implanting of the life of heaven in man, begins from his infancy and continues even to the last of his life in the world, and that after his life in the world it is perfected to eternity, see n. 2679, 3203, 3584, 3665, 3690, 3701, 4377, 4551, 4552, 5126, 6751, 9103, 9296, 9297; especially n. 5122, 5398, 5912, 9258.) Moreover-and this is a secret-man's regeneration in the world is only a plane for the perfecting of his life to eternity. (That a man who has lived in good is perfected in the other life, may be seen from what has been shown concerning infants, n. 2289-2309; and concerning the state and lot of the Gentiles in that life, n. 2589-2604.) </p>

<p>And the wild beast of the field be multiplied upon thee. That this signifies a flowing in of falsities from the delights of the loves of self and of the world, is evident from the signification of "being multiplied," when said of the hasty removal of evils and falsities, as being a flowing in; and from the signification of "the wild beast of the field," as being falsities from the delights of the loves of self and of the world. By "beasts" of various kinds mentioned in the Word are signified good and evil affections (see n. 9280); consequently by "wild beasts" are signified the affections of falsity that arise from the delights of the loves of self and of the world. Moreover, these affections are represented in the other life by wild beasts, as by panthers, tigers, wild boars, wolves, and bears. They are also like wild beasts, for those who are in these loves are in evils of every kind and in the derivative falsities, and like wild beasts do they look at and act toward their associates. (That all evils and falsities spring from these loves, see n. 2041, 2045, 2057, 2363, 2364, 2444, 4750, 4776, 6667, 7178, 7255, 7364, 7366-7377, 7488, 7490-7494, 7643, 8318, 8487, 8678.)  [2] That through the hasty removal of evils and falsities, the falsities from these loves would flow in, is because goods and truths must remove the evils and falsities by being successively implanted; for falsities can only be removed by truths; and evils can only be removed by goods. If this is not done successively and according to order, the falsities which favor these loves will flow in; for before he has been regenerated these loves reign in every man, and when falsities flow in, truths are no longer acknowledged. Moreover, the man who is being regenerated is kept in the affection of truth, and while he is in this affection he seeks on all sides for truths among the memory-knowledges in the natural; and the fallacies of the external senses then present themselves there - for they are very abundant there - and when the delights of the loves of self and of the world breathe on the man, he infers from these fallacies nothing but falsities, which follow on, and fill the mind, if the falsities of evil are suddenly removed. These are the things which are meant in the internal sense by "I will not drive him out from before thee in one year, lest the land be desolate, and the wild beast of the field multiply upon thee; by little and little I will drive him out from before thee, until thou be fruitful and inherit the land." [3] That "a wild beast" denotes falsity and evil springing from the loves of self and of the world, is plain from the passages in the Word where it is mentioned; as in the following:      A path shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called the way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass through it, nor shall any ravenous wild beast go up thereon (Isa. 35:8, 9).       I will send upon thee famine, and an evil wild beast, and they shall bereave thee (Ezek. 5:17).      When I cause the evil wild beast to pass through the land, and it bereave it, and it become a desolation, so that no one passeth through because of the beast (Ezek. 14:15).      Thou shalt fall upon the faces of the field; I will give thee for food to the wild beast of the earth, and to the bird of the heaven (Ezek. 29:5).      Then I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will make the evil wild beast to cease out of the land; that they may dwell securely in the wilderness. They shall no more be a prey to the nations, and the wild beast of the field shall no longer devour them (Ezek. 34:25, 28).      [4] I will lay waste her vine and her fig-tree, and I will make them into a forest, and the wild beast of the field shall devour them (Hos. 2:12).      The land shall mourn, and everyone that dwelleth therein shall waste away, because of the wild beast of the field, and because of the bird of the heavens (Hos. 4:3).      The boar out of the wood doth trample it, and the wild beast of the fields doth consume it. Turn again, O God Zebaoth, and visit Thy vine (Ps. 80:13, 14).      Thou makest darkness that it may be night; wherein every wild beast of the forest doth come forth (Ps. 104:20).      If ye shall walk in My statutes, and keep My commandments, and do them, I will cause the evil wild beast to cease out of the land. But if ye shall reject My statutes, I will send against you the wild beast of the field, which shall lay you waste (Lev. 26:3, 6, 15, 22).      Jehovah thy God will drive out those nations before thee by little and little, lest perchance the wild beast of the field multiply against thee (Deut. 7:22). In these passages "the wild beast of the field," "the wild beast of the earth," and "the wild beast of the forest" denote the falsities and evils which are of the loves of self and of the world. [5] As by "a wild beast" is signified falsity, and falsity is from a double origin, namely, from what is evil, and from what is upright (n. 9258), therefore by "wild beasts" in the Word are also signified the upright Gentiles, who although in falsity, are yet in uprightness of life. In this sense the term "wild animal"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_196"></A><A HREF="#fn_196"><FONT SIZE="1">9335-1</FONT></A> is used in the following passages:      Every wild animal of the forest is Mine, and the beasts upon a thousand mountains. I know every bird of the mountains; and the wild animal of My fields is with Me (Ps. 50:10, 11). Praise ye Jehovah, ye wild animal, and every beast (Ps. 148:7, 10). Every wild animal of My fields, come ye to devour, every wild animal in the forest (Isa. 56:9).      All the birds of the heavens made their nests in the branches of the cedar, which is Asshur, and under his branches every wild animal of the field brought forth, and in his shadow dwelt all great nations (Ezek. 31:6). </p>

<p>By little and little I will drive him out from before thee. That this signifies a removal by degrees according to order, is evident from the signification of "by little and little," as being by degrees, thus slowly; from the signification of "driving out," when said of the falsities and evils which are signified by the nations of the land of Canaan, as being removal (of which just above, n. 9333). It is said "by degrees according to order," because with the man who is being regenerated all things are disposed according to the order of heaven; for the regenerate man is a heaven in the least form, and therefore there is in him an order like that which is in heaven. [2] When a man is born, in respect to hereditary evils he is a hell in the least form; and he also becomes a hell insofar as he takes the hereditary evils to himself, and adds to them things which are his own. Hence it is that both from birth and from actual life the order of his life is opposite to the order of heaven; for from his own a man loves himself more than the Lord, and the world more than heaven; when yet the life of heaven consists in loving the Lord above all things and the neighbor as oneself. From this it is evident that the former life, which is of hell, must be utterly destroyed (that is to say, the evils and falsities must be removed), in order that the new life, which is the life of heaven, may be implanted (see n. 4551, 4552, 4839, 6068). This cannot possibly be done hastily; for every evil that is rooted in with its falsities has a connection with all evils and their falsities; and such evils and falsities are innumerable, and their connection is so complex that it cannot be comprehended, not even by the angels, but only by the Lord. From this it is evident that the life of hell with a man cannot be destroyed suddenly; for if it were, he would straightway expire; and neither can the life of heaven be implanted suddenly, for if it were, he would also expire.  [3] There are thousands and thousands of arcana, of which scarcely a single one is known to man, whereby a man is led by the Lord out of the life of hell into the life of heaven. That this is so, has been given me to know from heaven, and it has likewise been confirmed by many things which have come to my notice. As man knows scarcely anything of these matters, many have fallen into errors about the liberation of man from evils and falsities (that is, the forgiveness of sins), believing that through mercy the life of hell in a man can be instantly turned into the life of heaven in him; when yet the whole act of regeneration is mercy, and none are regenerated except those who receive the mercy of the Lord in faith and life while in the world; according to the Lord's words in John:      As many as received, to them gave He the power to be sons of God, even to them that believe in His name; who were born, not of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God (John 1:12, 13); what is meant by "bloods," by "the will of the flesh," and "the will of man," also by being "born of God," may be seen above (n. 5826).  [4] What is properly meant by removal from evils and falsities by degrees according to order, shall also be briefly stated. The Divine truth which proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord disposes all things into order in heaven; and therefore this Divine truth, in which there is good from the Lord, is order itself (n. 1728, 1919, 2258, 2447, 5703, 6338, 8700, 8988). According to this order all things in heaven come forth, and according to the same order they subsist; for to subsist is perpetually to come forth. In order therefore that heaven may come forth in a man it is necessary that he receive Divine truth in the good proceeding from the Lord. This can only be done by degrees according to an order similar to that by which the Lord sets heaven in order; for the case with a thing of the same nature is the same in what is small as in what is great. This successive setting in order is what is here meant by "order according to degrees." From all this it is also evident that the case with the new creation of man-which is his regeneration-is the same as with the creation of heaven and earth. Wherefore also in the Word by "a new heaven and a new earth" is meant a new church (n. 1733, 1850, 2117, 2118, 3355, 4535); and also by the creation of heaven and earth in the first chapter of Genesis is meant the new creation of the celestial church, which is called "Man" (of which see in the explications there). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9337.">9337.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Until thou be fruitful. That this signifies according to the increase of good, is evident from the signification of "being fruitful," as being the increase of good (see n. 43, 55, 913, 983, 2846, 2847). That removal from evils and falsities is effected according to the increase of good, is evident from what has been frequently shown above; for the Lord flows into man by means of good, and by means of it He disposes truth into order; but not the converse; and insofar as truths are disposed into order by means of good, so far evils and falsities are removed. In the Word throughout man is likened to a tree, and his truths of faith are signified by the leaves (n. 885), and his goods of love by the fruits (n. 3146, 7690). From this it is plain not only that "to be fruitful" denotes an increase of good; but also that good is man's chief thing, even as the fruit is the chief thing of a tree. The leaves are indeed put forth first, but for the sake of the fruit as the end. That which is the end is not only the last, but it is also the first thing, because it is the one and only thing regarded in the means, thus it is everything. The case is similar with the good of love relatively to the truths of faith. [2] Such was the signification of "a fig-tree," of which we read in the following passages:      As Jesus returned to the city, He hungered. And seeing a fig-tree in the way, He came to it, but found nothing thereon, except leaves only; and He said unto it, Let no fruit grow from thee henceforward forever; whereupon the fig-tree withered away (Matt. 21:18, 19).      A certain man had a fig-tree planted in his vineyard; he came therefore seeking fruit thereon, but found none; he said therefore unto the vinedresser, Behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig-tree, but find none: cut it down; why rendereth it the land unfruitful? (Luke 13:6, 7).      Every tree is known by its fruit. Of thorns men do not gather figs, nor of a bramble bush gather they grapes. The good man out of the good treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good; but the evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil. Why call ye Me, Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? (Luke 6:44-46.) From all this it is evident that the fruit of faith, as it is called, is the primary thing of faith; and that faith without fruit, that is, without the good of life, is only a leaf; and thus that when a man (here meant by "the tree") abounds in leaves without fruit, he is the fig-tree which withers away and is cut down. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9338.">9338.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And inherit the land. That this signifies until in good, and thus regenerate, is evident from the signification of "inheriting," as being to receive as an heir (of which in what follows); and from the signification of "the land," here the land of Canaan, as being the kingdom of the Lord, thus heaven (see n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705, 4240, 4447). Therefore by "inheriting the land" is signified receiving heaven as an heir. By "an heir," when said of heaven, is especially meant a man who has the Lord's life (n. 2658, 2851, 3672, 7212), thus one who is in good from the Lord, and consequently who is regenerate. (That when a man is in good from the Lord, he is in heaven, thus regenerate, see n. 9274, and the passages there cited.) [2] That this is signified by "inheriting," when said of heaven, is plain in Matthew:      Then shall the King say to those on His right hand, Come ye blessed of My Father, possess as an inheritance the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry, and ye gave Me to eat; I was thirsty, and ye gave Me to drink. Inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me (Matt. 25:34, 35, 40); here "to possess as an inheritance the kingdom of the Lord," that is, heaven, is said of those who are in good; the very goods of charity are also enumerated in their order; and finally it is said, "inasmuch as ye did it unto one of the least of these My brethren, ye did it unto Me." Those are called the Lord's "brethren" who are in good (n. 6756); thus also those who do what is good, for good is the Lord with man. Therefore it is said, "inasmuch as ye did it unto one of these brethren;" but not "to one of the brethren." [3] In Revelation:      He that overcometh shall receive by inheritance all things; and I will be his God, and be shall be My son (Rev. 21:7); speaking of those who overcome it is said they "shall receive by inheritance all things," and they are called "sons," because heirs; "to overcome" denotes to fight from good and truth; for evil is overcome by means of good; and falsity by means of truth. [4] In David:      God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah; and they shall dwell there, and possess it by inheritance. The seed also of His servants shall inherit it; and they that love His name shall dwell therein (Ps. 69:35, 36); where "to possess by inheritance" is predicated of those who are in celestial good; and "to inherit" of those who are in spiritual good. Celestial good is the good of love to the Lord, and spiritual good is the good of charity toward the neighbor (n. 9277). In Isaiah:      He that confideth in Me shall inherit the land, and shall possess by inheritance the mountain of My holiness (Isa. 57:13). [5] From all this it is evident what is signified by the land of Canaan being distributed into twelve inheritances for the twelve tribes of Israel (Josh. 14 to 19; and Ezek. 47:13-22; also Ezek. 48); for by "the land of Canaan" was signified the kingdom of the Lord, or heaven (n. 1413, 1437, 1607, 1866, 3038, 3481, 3686, 3705, 4240, 4447); by the "twelve tribes" were signified all goods and truths in general and in particular (n. 3858, 3862, 3926, 3939, 4060, 6335, 6337, 6397, 6640); thus by the twelve inheritances was signified heaven with all the heavens and the societies therein, distinct in respect to the goods of love and the derivative truths of faith (n. 7836, 7891, 7996); thus in the abstract sense the goods themselves which are from the Lord, consequently which are the Lord in heaven. [6] For heaven is nothing else than the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord's Divine good. The angels of heaven are recipients of truth in good; and insofar as they receive this, so far they make heaven. And-this is a secret-the Lord does not dwell with an angel except in His own with him. In like manner He dwells with a man; for the Divine must be in what is Divine, and not in what belongs to any man. This is meant by the words of the Lord concerning the union of Himself with those who are in the good of love, in John:      In that day ye shall know that I am in the Father, and ye in Me, and I in you. He that loveth Me keepeth My word, and We will come unto him, and make our abode with him (John 14:20, 23).      The glory which Thou hast given Me I have given them; that they may be one; as We are one; that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them (John 17:22, 26). </p>

<p>Verses 31-33. And I will set thy border from the sea Suph, and even unto the sea of the Philistines; and from the wilderness even unto the river; for I will give into your hand the inhabitants of the land, and I will drive them out from before thee. Thou shalt not make a covenant with them, and with their gods. They shall not dwell in thy land, lest perchance they make thee sin against Me, when thou shalt serve their gods, because it will be a snare to thee. "And I will set thy border from the sea Suph, and even unto the sea of the Philistines," signifies extension from memory-truths to the interior truths of faith; "and from the wilderness even unto the river," signifies from the delight of what is sensuous, even to the good and truth of the rational; "for I will give into your hand the inhabitants of the land," signifies command over evils; "and I will drive them out from before thee," signifies their removal; "thou shalt not make a covenant with them, and with their gods," signifies no communication with evils and falsities; "they shall not dwell in thy land," signifies that evils shall not be together with the goods of the church; "lest perchance they make thee sin against Me," signifies lest evils turn away the goods that are from the Lord; "when thou shalt serve their gods," signifies if there be worship from falsities; "because it will be a snare to thee," signifies by reason of the allurement and deception of evils. </p>

That this signifies extension from memory-truths to the interior truths of faith, is evident from the signification of "setting a border" from one place to another, when said of spiritual truths, as being extension; from the signification of "the sea Suph," as being sensuous and memory-truths, which are the ultimates with man, for the sea Suph was the ultimate border of the land of Egypt, and by "Egypt" is signified memory-knowledge in both senses, true and false (see n. 1164, 1165, 1186, 1462, 2588, 4749, 4964, 4966, 5700, 6004, 6015, 6125, 6651, 6679, 6683, 6692, 6750, 7779, 7926, 8146, 8148), here memory-truth, because the subject treated of is the extension of the spiritual things of faith with the sons of Israel, by whom was represented the spiritual church (see n. 4286, 4598, 6426, 6637, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223, 8805); and from the signification of "the sea of the Philistines," as being the interior truths of faith. The reason why these truths are signified by "the sea of the Philistines" is that the sea where Tyre and Zidon were situated was the border of the land of Philistia, and by "Tyre and Zidon" are signified the knowledges of truth and good (n. 1201); and by "the land of Philistia" the knowledge of the interior things of faith (n. 1197, 2504, 2726, 3463). [2] As the land of Canaan represented the Lord's kingdom, thus heaven and the church, therefore all the places therein signified such things as are of the Lord's kingdom, that is, of heaven and the church, which are called celestial and spiritual things, and bear relation to the good of love to the Lord and to the truths of faith in Him. Consequently the seas and rivers which were the borders signified the ultimate things therein; and accordingly "from sea to sea" and "from river to river" signified their extension. (That this is so, see n. 1585, 1866, 4116, 4240, 6516.) From this it can be seen that by "the border from the sea Suph and even unto the sea of the Philistines" is signified the extension of the spiritual things of truth from external things to internal, thus from memory-truths to the interior truths of faith. But the extension of celestial things, which are of the good of love, is described immediately after by "from the wilderness even unto the river." (That the places of the land of Canaan, and also the seas and rivers, have such a signification in the Word, has been shown throughout in the explications.) [3] It shall be briefly stated what is meant by "extension from memory-truths to the interior truths of faith." Truths in the external man are called "memory-truths;" and truths in the internal man are called "interior truths of faith." Memory-truths are in man's memory, and when they are drawn out from it, they come to his notice. But the interior truths of faith are the truths of the very life, inscribed on the internal man, and of which but little appears in the memory; but on this subject, of the Lord's Divine mercy, a fuller statement shall be made elsewhere. Memory-truths and the interior truths of faith were signified by "the waters under the expanse, and the waters above the expanse" (Gen. 1:6, 7; n. 24), for the subject treated of in the first chapter of Genesis in the internal sense is the new creation, that is, the regeneration, of the man of the celestial church.  [4] The reason why "Philistia," which bordered on the land of Canaan even unto Tyre and Zidon, signified the interior truths of faith, was that the representative Ancient Church had been there, as is evident from the remains of Divine worship among its inhabitants, and referred to in the historic and prophetic books of the Word that treat of the Philistines and the land of Philistia; as in the prophecies of Jeremiah 25:20; 47; Ezekiel 16:27, 57; 25:15-16; Amos 1:8; Zephaniah 2:5; Zechariah 9:6; and Psalm 56, title; 60:8; 83:7; 108:9. The case with the Philistines was the same as with all the nations in the land of Canaan, in that they represented the goods and truths of the church, and also evils and falsities. For while the representative Ancient Church was among them, they represented the celestial things which are of good and the spiritual things which are of truth; but when they turned aside from genuine representative worship, they then began to represent the diabolical things which are of evil and the infernal things which are of falsity. Hence it is that by "Philistia," as by the other nations of the land of Canaan, are signified in the Word both goods and truths, and evils and falsities. [5] That by the "Philistines" are signified the interior truths of faith, is evident in David:      Glorious things shall be preached in thee, O city of God. I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon among those who know Me; and also of Philistia and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there (Ps. 87:3, 4); the "city of God" denotes the doctrine of the truth of faith from the Word (n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2712, 2943, 3216, 4492, 4493, 5297); "Tyre," the knowledges of truth and good (n. 1201); in like manner "Ethiopia" (n. 116, 117). From this it is evident that "Philistia" denotes the knowledge of the truths of faith. [6] In Amos:      Are ye not as the sons of the Ethiopians unto Me, O sons of Israel? Have not I made Israel to come up out of the land of Egypt, and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the Syrians from Kir? (Amos 9:7); the perversion and destruction of the church after it had been set up is here treated of; "the sons of the Ethiopians" here denote those who are in the knowledges of good and truth, but who apply them to confirm evils and falsities (n. 1163, 1164); "the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt" denote those who have been initiated into spiritual truths and goods by means of memory-truths. (That "the sons of Israel" denote those who are in spiritual truths and good, thus in the abstract sense spiritual truths and goods, see n. 5414, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, 5879, 5951, 7957, 8234; and that "the land of Egypt" denotes memory-truth, has been shown above.) The like is signified by "the Philistines from Caphtor," and by "the Syrians from Kir," to whom they are therefore likened. "The Philistines from Caphtor" denote those who have been initiated into interior truths by means of exterior, but who have perverted them and applied them to confirm falsities and evils (n. 1197, 1198, 3412, 3413, 3762, 8093, 8096, 8099, 8313); and "the Syrians from Kir" denote those who are in the knowledges of good and truth, which also they have perverted (n. 1232, 1234, 3051, 3249, 3664, 3680, 4112). [7] In Jeremiah:      Because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Zidon all the residue that helpeth; for Jehovah layeth waste the Philistines, the remains of the isle of Caphtor (Jer. 47:4); in this chapter the subject treated of is the vastation of the church in respect to the truths of faith; the interior truths of faith are "the Philistines;" and the exterior truths are "the remains of the isle of Caphtor." [8] In Joel:      What have you to do with Me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all the borders of Philistia? Speedily will I return your retribution on your head, forasmuch as ye have taken My silver and My gold, and have carried into your temples My desirable good things (Joel 3:4-5); "all the borders of Philistia" denote all the interior and exterior truths of faith; "to carry silver and gold and desirable good things into their temples" denotes to pervert truths and goods, and profane them by application to evils and falsities. (That "silver and gold" denote truths and goods, see n. 1551, 2954, 5658, 6112, 6914, 6917, 8932.) [9] In Obadiah:      Then they of the South shall be heirs of the mount of Esau, and of the plain of the Philistines; and they shall become heirs of the field of Ephraim; but Benjamin, of Gilead (Obad. 1:19); the setting up of the church is here treated of; but real things are infolded in the names; "they of the South" denote those who are in the light of truth (n. 1458, 3195, 3708, 5672, 5962); "the mount of Esau" denotes the good of love (n. 3300, 3322, 3494, 3504, 3576); "the plain of the Philistines" denotes the truth of faith; "a plain" also denotes the doctrine of faith (n. 2418); "Ephraim" denotes the intellectual of the church (n. 3969, 5354, 6222, 6234, 6238, 6267); "Benjamin," the spiritual  celestial truth of the church (n. 3969, 4592, 5686, 5689, 6440); and "Gilead," the corresponding exterior good (n. 4117, 4124, 4747). [10] In Isaiah:      He shall assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the dispersed of Judah from the four wings of the earth. They shall fly upon the shoulder of the Philistines toward the sea; together shall they spoil the sons of the east (Isa. 11:12, 14); here by "Israel" and "Judah" are not meant Israel and Judah, but by "Israel" those who are in the good of faith, and by "Judah" those who are in the good of love; "to fly upon the shoulder of the Philistines" denotes to receive and take into possession the interior truths of faith; "to spoil the sons of the east" denotes to receive and take into possession the interior goods of faith; for "the sons of the east" denote those who are in the goods of faith, and in the knowledges of good (n. 3249, 3762). That "to spoil" denotes to receive and take into possession, may be seen from what has been already shown concerning the spoiling of the Egyptians by the sons of Israel (n. 6914, 6917). [11] As by "the land of Philistia" was signified the knowledge of the interior truths of faith, and by Abraham and Isaac was represented the Lord, and by their sojourning the instruction of the Lord in the truths and goods of faith and of love, which are of Divine wisdom, therefore for the sake of prefiguring this process, Abraham was bidden to sojourn in Philistia (see Gen. 20), and also Isaac (Gen. 26:1-24); and accordingly Abimelech, king of the Philistines, made a covenant with Abraham (Gen. 21:22, to the end), and also with Isaac (Gen. 26:26, to the end); on which subject may be seen the explications given at these chapters. </p>

<p>And from the wilderness even unto the river. That this signifies from the delight of what is sensuous even to the good and truth of the rational, is evident from the signification of "setting a border," as being extension (as just above, n. 9340); from the signification of "a wilderness," as being a place uninhabited and not cultivated; thus in application to the spiritual things of faith and to the celestial things of love, "a wilderness" denotes where there is no good and no truth, as is the case with what is sensuous (that the sensuous of man is of this character, see n. 9331). As the sensuous has no celestial good and no spiritual truth, but has delight and pleasure from the body and the world, therefore by "a wilderness" is signified this outermost in the man of the church. And from the signification of "the Euphrates," which is here "the river," as being the good and truth of the rational. That "the Euphrates" has this signification is because Assyria was there, and by "Assyria," or "Asshur," is signified the rational (n. 119, 1186). [2] This is meant by "the Euphrates" where it is said, "from the wilderness to the Euphrates," and "from the river of Egypt to the Euphrates;" as in the following passages:      From the wilderness, and Lebanon, even unto the great river, the river Euphrates, the whole land of the Hittites, and even unto the great sea toward the setting of the sun, shall be your border (Josh. 1:4).      To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt even unto the great river, the river Euphrates (Gen. 15:18).      Thou madest a vine to journey out of Egypt. Thou hast sent out its shoots even unto the sea, and its twigs unto the river (Ps. 80:8, 11); "a vine out of Egypt" denotes the spiritual church represented by the sons of Israel; "unto the sea," and "unto the river," denote to interior truths and goods. In like manner in Micah:      They shall come unto thee from Assyria and from the cities of Egypt, and thence from Egypt even unto the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain (Micah 7:12). [3] But something else is signified by "the Euphrates" when it is looked at from the middle of the land of Canaan as its extreme limit on one side, or as what closes it in on one side; in this case by that river is signified that which is the ultimate of the Lord's kingdom, that is, which is the ultimate of heaven and the church, in respect to rational good and truth. (That the borders of the land of Canaan, which were rivers and seas, signified the ultimates in the Lord's kingdom, see n. 1585,1866, 4116, 4240, 6516.) "The Euphrates" therefore signified such truths and such goods as belong to the sensuous mind, and correspond to the truths and goods of the rational. But as the sensuous of man stands forth nearest to the world and the earth, and receives its objects therefrom (n. 9331), it therefore acknowledges nothing else as good than that which delights the body; and nothing else as truth than that which favors this delight. By "the river Euphrates" therefore in this sense is signified the pleasure arising from the loves of self and of the world; and the falsity which confirms it by reasonings from the fallacies of the senses. [4] This is what is meant by "the river Euphrates" in Revelation:      A voice said to the sixth angel, Loose the four angels which are bound at the great river Euphrates. They were loosed, and they killed the third part of men (Rev. 9:14, 15); "the angels bound at the Euphrates" denote the falsities originating through reasonings from the fallacies of the senses, which falsities favor the delights of the loves of self and of the world. Again:      The sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings who are from the sun rising might be prepared (Rev. 16:12); "the Euphrates" here denotes falsities from a like origin; "the water dried up" denotes these falsities removed by the Lord; "the way of the kings from the east" denotes that then the truths of faith are seen by and revealed to those who are in love to the Lord. (That "waters" denote truths, and in the opposite sense falsities, see n. 705, 739, 756, 790, 839, 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 7307, 8137, 8138, 8568, 9323; that "a way" denotes truth seen and revealed, n. 627, 2333, 3477; that "kings" denote those who are in truths, n. 1672, 2015, 2069, 3009, 4575, 4581, 4966, 5044, 5068, 6148; that "the east" denotes the Lord, and also love from Him and to Him, n. 101, 1250, 3708; and in like manner "the sun," n. 1529, 1530, 2441, 2495, 3636, 3643, 4060, 4696, 5377, 7078, 7083, 7171, 7173, 8644, 8812.) [5] In Jeremiah:      Thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, when He led thee into the way. And now what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor? Or what hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? (Jer. 2:17, 18); "to lead into the way" denotes to teach truth; "what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Shihor?" denotes what hast thou to do with falsities which have been occasioned by memory-knowledges wrongly applied? "What hast thou to do with the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river?" denotes what hast thou to do with the falsities which have arisen through reasonings from the fallacies of the senses in favor of the delights of the loves of self and of the world? [6] In the same:      Jehovah said unto the prophet, Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. So I went and hid it at the Euphrates. Afterward it came to pass at the end of many days, that Jehovah said, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence. Wherefore he went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where he had hidden it; but behold the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing (Jer. 13:3-7); "the girdle of the loins" denotes the external bond containing all things of love and thence of faith; "to be hidden in a hole of the rock by the Euphrates" denotes where faith is in obscurity and has become no faith, through falsities from reasonings; "the girdle marred so that it was profitable for nothing" denotes that all things of love and of faith are then dissolved and dispersed. [7] That Jeremiah was to tie a stone to the book written by him, and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates (Jer. 51:63); signified that the prophetic Word would perish through like things. In the same:      Let not the swift flee away, nor the strong one escape; toward the north near the shore of the river Euphrates they have stumbled and fallen. But Jehovah Zebaoth taketh vengeance on His adversaries. The Lord Jehovih Zebaoth hath a sacrifice in the land of the north by the river Euphrates (Jer. 46:6, 10); where also "the river Euphrates" denotes truths falsified, and goods adulterated, through reasonings from fallacies and the derivative memory-knowledges which favor the loves of self and of the world. </p>

<p>For I will give into your hand the inhabitants of the land. That this signifies command over evils, is evident from the signification of "giving into the hand," as being to conquer and command; and from the signification of "the inhabitants of the land," as being the evils of the church; for by "inhabitants" are signified goods (see n. 2268, 2451, 2712, 3613), consequently in the opposite sense, evils; because by the nations of the land of Canaan were signified the evils and falsities which infest and destroy the goods and truths of the church (n. 9327). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9343.">9343.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And I will drive them out from before thee. That this signifies their removal, is evident from the signification of "driving out," when said of evils, as being removal (see n. 9333). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9344.">9344.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Thou shalt not make a covenant with them, and with their gods. That this signifies no communication with evils and falsities, is evident from the signification of "making a covenant," as being to be conjoined (see n. 665, 666, 1023, 1038, 1864, 1996, 2003, 2021, 6804, 8767, 8778), thus also to be communicated, for they who communicate together are conjoined; from the signification of "the inhabitants of the land," who in this case are those with whom they were not to make a covenant, as being evils (of which just above, n. 9342); and from the signification of "gods," as being falsities (n. 4402, 4544, 7873, 8867, 8941). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9345.">9345.</A></FONT></span>
<p>They shall not dwell in thy land. That this signifies that evils shall not be together with the goods of the church, is evident from the signification of "the inhabitants," of whom it is said "they shall not dwell in thy land," as being evils (see above, n. 9342); from the signification of "dwelling," as being to live (n. 1293, 3384, 3613); and of "dwelling with" anyone, as being to live or be together (n. 4451); and from the signification of "the land," as being the church in respect to good, thus also the good of the church (n. 9325). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9346.">9346.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Lest perchance they make thee sin against Me. That this signifies lest evils turn away the goods that are from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "the inhabitants of the land," of whom it is said "lest perchance they make thee sin," as being evils (as above); from the signification of "to sin," as being to turn away (n. 5474, 5841, 7589); and from the signification of "thee against Me," as being the goods that are from the Lord; for by "the sons of Israel," who are here meant by "thee," are signified those who are in good, thus goods (n. 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5826, 5833, 9340); and by "Jehovah," who is here meant by "Me," is meant the Lord (n. 9199, 9315). That evils turn away the goods that are from the Lord, is because evils and goods are opposites or contraries, and two opposites or contraries cannot be together, for they turn away from each other, and are in conflict. This can be plainly seen from the fact that evils are from hell, and goods from heaven; and that hell is as far as possible from heaven - not in respect to distance, because in the other life there is no distance - but in respect to state. Therefore they who are in the state of hell cannot be transferred into the state of heaven, for the evils in the former reject the goods in the latter. This is meant by the words of Abraham to the rich man:      Between us and you there is a great gulf fixed, so that they who would pass from hence to you cannot, neither can those who are there pass over to us (Luke 16:26); "the great gulf" denotes the opposition and contrariety of the states of life. From all this it is evident how it is to be understood that evils turn away the goods that are from the Lord; namely, that those who are in evils not only do not receive the goods which continually flow into everyone from the Lord; but also absolutely turn them away. And therefore a man cannot possibly receive the good of heaven until he abstains from evils. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9347.">9347.</A></FONT></span>
<p>When thou shalt serve their gods. That this signifies if there be worship from falsities, is evident from the signification of "serving," as being worship (see n. 7934, 8057); and from the signification of "gods," as being falsities (n. 4544, 7873, 8867, 8941). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="9348.">9348.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Because it will be a snare to thee. That this signifies by reason of the allurement and deception of evils, is evident from the signification of "a snare," when said of evils, as being allurement and deception. That evils allure and deceive, is because all evils spring from the loves of self and of the world (see n. 9335), and the loves of self and of the world are born with man, and from this he feels the delight of his life from the moment of his birth; nay, from this he has life. Wherefore these loves, like the unseen currents of a river, continually draw the thought and the will of man away from the Lord to self, and away from heaven to the world, thus away from the truths and goods of faith to falsities and evils. Reasonings from the fallacies of the senses are then of especial force, and also the literal sense of the Word wrongly explained and applied. [2] These two sources of error, and also those previously mentioned, are what are meant in the spiritual sense of the Word by "snares," "nooses," "pits," "nets," "ropes," "gins," and also by "frauds" and "deceits;" as in these passages:      Dread, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of the earth; whence it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the voice of the dread shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for the floodgates from on high are opened, and the foundations of the earth have been shaken (Isa. 24:17, 18).      Fear, the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab. He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare (Jer. 48:43, 44). "Dread" and "fear" denote a disturbance and commotion of the mind when it hesitates between evils and goods, consequently between falsities and truths; "the pit" denotes falsity brought in through reasonings from the fallacies of the senses to favor the delights of the loves of self and of the world; "the snare" denotes the allurement and deception of evil thence derived. [3] In Isaiah:      They shall go, and stumble backward, and be broken, and ensnared, and taken (Isa. 28:13); "to stumble backward" denotes to turn themselves away from good and truth; "to be broken" denotes to dissipate truths and goods; "to be ensnared" denotes to be allured by the evils of the loves of self and of the world; "to be taken" denotes to be carried away by them. [4] In Ezekiel:      The mother of the princes of Israel is a lioness; one of her whelps learned to seize the prey, he devoured men; the nations heard of him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks into the land of Egypt. Afterward he ravished widows, and laid waste cities; the land was desolate, and the fullness thereof, by the voice of His roaring. Therefore the nations lay in wait for him round about from the provinces; and they spread their net over him; he was caught in their pit. They put him in a cage with hooks, and brought him unto the king of Babel in nets, that His voice should no more be heard on the mountains of Israel (Ezek. 19:1-4, 7-9); the successive profanation of truth through the allurements of falsities from evils is here described; "the mother of the princes of Israel" denotes the church where are primary truths (that "mother" denotes the church, see n. 298, 2691, 2717, 4257, 5581, 8897; and that "the princes of Israel" denote primary truths, n. 1482, 2089, 5044); a "lioness" denotes falsity from evil perverting the truths of the church; "a lion's whelp" denotes evil in its power (n. 6367); "to seize the prey and devour men" denotes to destroy truths and goods, for "man" denotes the good of the church (n. 4287, 7424, 7523); "nations" denote evils (see n. 1259, 1260, 1849, 2588, 4444, 6306); "the pit in which he was caught by the nations" denotes the falsity of evil (n. 4728, 4744, 5038, 9086); "the land of Egypt into which he was brought with hooks" denotes the memory-knowledge through which is falsity (n. 9340); "to ravish widows" denotes to pervert the goods which long for truth (that "to ravish" denotes to pervert, see n. 2466, 2729, 4865, 8904; and that "widows" denote goods that long for truth, n. 9198, 9200); "to lay waste cities" denotes to destroy the doctrinal things of the truth of the church (n. 402, 2268, 2449, 2943, 3216, 4478, 4492, 4493); "to desolate the land and the fullness thereof" denotes to destroy all things of the church (n. 9325); "the voice of roaring of the lion" denotes falsity; "to spread the net over him" denotes to allure by the delights of earthly loves and by reasonings from them; "to bring to the king of Babel" denotes the profanation of truth (n. 1182, 1283, 1295, 1304, 1307, 1308, 1321, 1322, 1326). [5] That such things do not come to pass when a man does not love himself and the world above all things, is thus described in Amos:      Will a lion roar in the forest if he hath no prey? Will a bird fall upon a snare of the earth if there is no noose for him? Shall a snare spring up from the earth if taking it hath taken nothing (Amos 3:4-6)? [6] That in the spiritual sense "a snare" denotes allurement and deception through the delights of the loves of self and of the world, thus the allurement and deception of evils, and this through reasonings from the fallacies of the senses which favor these delights, is plain to everyone; for ensnarings and entrappings are from no other source. Neither do the diabolical crew assail anything in a man except these his loves, which they delight in every possible way until he is caught, and when he has been caught the man reasons from falsities against truths, and from evils against goods. Nor is he then content with this, but also takes delight in ensnaring and alluring others to falsities and evils. The reason why he also takes delight in this, is that he is then one of the diabolical crew. [7] As "snare," "noose," and "net," signify such things, they also signify the destruction of the spiritual life, and thus perdition; for the delights of these loves are what destroy and lead into perdition, because, as before said, all evils spring from these loves. For from the love of self springs contempt for others in comparison with self, next derision and abuse, afterward enmity if they do not favor, and finally the delight of hatred, the delight of revenge, thus the delight of violence, nay, of cruelty. In the other life this love climbs so high, that unless the Lord favors those who have it, and gives them dominion over others, they not only despise Him, but also deride the Word which treats of Him, and finally they act against Him from hatred and revenge; and insofar as they cannot do anything against Him, they practice such things with violence and cruelty against all who profess Him. From this it is plain whence it comes that there is such a diabolical crew, namely, from the love of self. And therefore as "a snare" signifies the delight of the love of self and of the world, it also signifies the destruction of spiritual life, and perdition; for everything of faith and love to the Lord, and everything of love toward the neighbor, are destroyed by the delight of the love of self and of the world wherever it has dominion (see what was cited in n. 9335). [8] That these loves are the origins of all evils, and that hell is from them and in them, and that these loves are the fires there, is at this day unknown in the world; when yet it might be known from the fact that these loves are opposite to love toward the neighbor and love to God, and that they are opposite to humility of heart, and that from them alone arise all contempt, all hatred, all revenge, and all violence and cruelty, as anyone may know who reflects. [9] That "a snare" therefore signifies the destruction of spiritual life, and perdition, is plain from the following passages. In David:      Upon the wicked, Jehovah shall rain snares, fire and sulphur (Ps. 11:6); where "fire and sulphur" denote the evils of the love of self and of the world. (That "fire" has this signification, see n. 1297, 1861, 5071, 5215, 6314, 6832, 7324, 7575, 9144; and also "sulphur," n. 2446.) Hence it is plain what is meant by "snares." In Luke:      Lest that day come upon you suddenly; for as a snare shall it come upon all who dwell upon the face of the whole earth (Luke 21:34, 35); where the subject treated of is the last time of the church, when there is no faith because no charity, for the loves of self and of the world will then reign, and from these loves comes perdition, which is the "snare." Again:      Among My people are found the wicked; they watch, as fowlers stretch nets; they set a trap that they may catch men (Jer. 5:26).      They that seek after my soul stretch snares; and they that seek mine evil speak perditions, and meditate deceits all the day long (Ps. 38:12).      Guard me from the hands of the noose they have laid for me, and from the snares of the workers of iniquity. Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass over (Ps 141:9, 10)      He shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a snare and for a noose to the inhabitant of Jerusalem. Many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken (Isa. 8:14, 15); the Lord is here treated of. "A stone of stumbling and a rock of offense" denote the giving of offense; "a snare" and "a noose" denote perdition, namely, that of those who attack and endeavor to destroy the truths and goods of faith in the Lord through falsities which favor the loves of self and of the world; for all the proud are not only offended, but are also ensnared by the fact that the Divine has appeared in a human form, and this not in royal majesty, but in a despised shape. From all this it is now evident that by "it will be a snare," is signified the allurement and deception of evils, and the consequent perdition; as also elsewhere in Moses:      Make not a covenant with the inhabitant of the land upon which thou shalt come, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee (Exod. 34:12).      Thou shalt not serve their gods; for this will be a snare to thee (Deut. 7:16).      Take heed to thyself that thou be not ensnared after the nations, and that perchance thou seek their gods (Deut. 12:30); "the nations" denote evils, and the falsities thence derived.  </p>

<p>In chapters 20-23, the laws, judgments, and statutes, that were promulgated from Mount Sinai, have been treated of, and it has been shown what they contain in the internal sense, thus how they are perceived in heaven; namely, not according to the literal sense, but according to the spiritual sense, which is not apparent in the letter, but still is within it. One who does not know how this is, may indeed suppose that the Word as to its literal sense is thus annihilated, because in heaven no attention is paid to it. But be it known that the literal sense of the Word is by no means thereby annihilated; but is indeed rather confirmed; and that each word has weight, and is holy, from the spiritual sense which is within; because the literal sense is the basis and support on which the spiritual sense rests, and with which it coheres in the closest conjunction, insomuch that there is not even a jot or point, or a little horn, in the letter of the Word, which does not contain within it the holy Divine; according to the words of the Lord in these passages:      Verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one little horn shall not pass away from the law, till all things be done (Matt. 5:18);      It is easier for heaven and earth to pass away than for one point in the law to fail (Luke 16:17). (That "the law" denotes the Word, see n. 6752, 7463.) [2] Therefore also it has come to pass through the Divine providence of the Lord, that the Word, especially the Word of the Old Testament, has been preserved in respect to every jot and point from the time when it was written. It has also been shown from heaven, that in the Word not only every expression, but also every syllable, and what seems incredible, every little horn of a syllable in the original tongue infolds in it something holy, which becomes perceptible to the angels of the inmost heaven. That this is the case I am able to affirm; but I know that it transcends belief. From this it is evident that the outward rituals of the church, which represented the Lord and the internal things of heaven and the church that are from the Lord, and which are treated of in the Word of the Old Testament, have indeed been for the most part abrogated, but that the Word nevertheless remains in its Divine sanctity; because, as before said, each and all things therein still infold holy Divine things, which are perceived in heaven while the Word is being read; for in every detail there is a holy internal which is its internal sense; that is, its heavenly and Divine sense. This sense is the soul of the Word, and it is truth Divine itself proceeding from the Lord; thus it is the Lord Himself. [3] From all this it can be seen how the case is with the laws, judgments, and statutes promulgated by the Lord from Mount Sinai, and which are contained in chapters 20-23, which have been explained; namely, that each and all things therein are holy because they are holy in their internal form; but that nevertheless some of them have been abrogated in respect to present use where the church is, which is an internal church. Some of them however are of such a nature that they may serve a use if one so pleases; and some of them are to be altogether observed and done. And yet those which have been abrogated in respect to use where the church is, and those which may serve a use if one so pleases, and also those which are to be altogether observed and done, are equally holy in their holy internal; for in its bosom the whole Word is Divine. This holy internal is that which the internal sense teaches, and is the same as the internal things of the Christian Church, which the doctrine of charity and faith teaches. [4] In order that what has been said may be placed within the apprehension, let us take for illustration the laws, judgments, and statutes treated of in the aforesaid chapters. Those which are to be altogether observed and done are those contained in Exod. 20:3-5, 7, 8, 12-17, 23; in Exod. 21:12, 14, 15, 20; in Exod. 22:18-20, 28; and in Exod. 23:1-3, 6-8, 24-25, 32. Those which may serve a use if one so pleases, are such as are contained in Exod. 20:10; in Exod. 21:18, 19, 22-25, 33-36; in Exod. 22:1-14, 17, 21-23, 25-27, 31; and in Exod. 23:4, 5, 9, 12-16, 33. And those which have been abrogated in respect to present use where the church is, are contained in Exod. 20:24-26; 21:2-11, 16, 21, 26-29, 31, 32; in Exod. 22:15, 29, 30; and in Exod. 23:10, 11, 17-19. But, as before said, both the latter and the former are equally holy, that is, are equally the Divine Word. </p>
