<p>And put them upon its pieces and upon its head. That this signifies the setting in order of exterior things under interior and inmost ones, is evident from the signification of the "pieces," as being interior things (see above, n. 10048); from the signification of the "head" as being the inmost (n. 5328, 6436, 9656, 9913, 9914); and from the signification of the "intestines and legs" which were to be put upon them, as being things outermost and outer (that the "intestines" denote things outermost or lowest, see n. 10030; and that the "legs" denote outer or exterior things, n. 10050); and from the signification of "putting the latter upon the former," as being to set in order. That it denotes to set in order exterior things under interior ones, and not "upon" them according to the sense of the letter, is because the altar and the fire upon the altar denote things highest or inmost; for the altar represented the Divine Human of the Lord as to Divine good, and the fire the Divine love itself; and therefore those parts from the ram and the burnt-offering that were nearest to the fire of the altar, were higher or interior; and those which had a place above them, being more remote from the fire of the altar, were lower or exterior. For in the internal sense those things are regarded as higher or interior which are nearest to the highest, and those as lower or exterior which are more remote from it, differently than in the sense of the letter. Whether we speak of things higher and lower, or of things interior and exterior, it is the same, for that which is higher is interior, and that which is lower is exterior (n. 2148, 3084, 4599, 5146, 8325). From this it is now plain that by "putting the intestines and the legs upon the pieces and upon the head" is signified that things outermost and outer were to be set in order under things interior and inmost. (That the altar was representative of the Lord's Divine Human as to Divine good, see n. 921, 2777, 2811, 9388, 9389, 9714, 9964; and that the fire of the altar denotes His Divine love, see n. 6832.) </p>

<p>And thou shalt burn with the whole ram upon the altar. That this signifies the internal of the Lord's Divine Human united to the Divine good of His Divine love which was in Himself, is evident from the signification of "burning," as being to unite to the Divine good of the Divine love (of which below); from the signification of "the ram," as being the internal in man, thus in the supreme sense the internal of the Lord's Divine Human (n. 10042); and from the signification of "the altar," as being the principal representative of the Lord's Divine Human as to His Divine good (of which just above, n. 10051 at the end). [2] Be it known that in every man there is an internal and an external, which are called his internal and external man, and that when a man is being regenerated, he is regenerated as to both the internal and the external, and that regeneration is the conjunction of good and truth in each. So was it in the Lord as to His Human; yet concerning His Human it cannot be said that it was regenerated, but that it was glorified, for His inmost, which with man is called the soul from the father, was the Divine Itself, as He was conceived of Jehovah. The Divine Itself is the Divine good of the Divine love; and as the Lord united His Human with this, and thus made His Human also Divine, therefore it cannot be said that His Human was regenerated, but glorified, for "to glorify" is to make Divine (see just below, n. 10053). The glorification of His internal man, or of His internal Human, is described by representatives in the burnt-offerings from rams and from lambs.  [3] That "to burn upon the altar with the whole ram" denotes to unite the Divine good of the Divine love with the internal of His Human, is because the altar was representative of the Lord's Divine Human, and the fire upon the altar, with which the burnt-offering was burnt, signified the Divine good of the Divine love (as can be seen from the places cited just above, n. 10051 at the end); and because the ram which was the burnt-offering and was burned, signifies the internal with man, thus the internal of the Lord's Human (n. 10042). From all this it is evident that by "burning upon the altar with the whole ram for a burnt-offering," is signified the internal of the Lord's Human united to the Divine good of His Divine love which was in Himself. </p>

<p>This is a burnt-offering unto Jehovah. That this signifies the glorification of the Lord's Human, is evident from the representation of a burnt-offering, as being the glorification of the Lord's Human. Among the Jewish nation there were sacrifices and burnt-offerings; the "sacrifices" signified purification from evils and falsities, and the implantation of truth, but the "burnt-offerings" signified the conjunction of truth with good, thus full and complete regeneration. In the supreme sense however, which treats of the Lord, the "sacrifices" signified the casting out of evils and falsities from His Human that was from the mother, and the implantation of Divine truth from the Divine good which was in Him; and the "burnt-offerings" signified the unition of the Divine truth with the Divine good, which unition is what is meant by "glorification." For when the Lord was in the world He made His Human Divine truth, and successively also by unition with the Divine good which was in Him and was the being of His life, He made His Human Divine good, thus one with Jehovah. The being of His life was that which with man is called the soul from the father, and this was the Divine good itself or the Divine love. (But on these things see what was shown in the places cited in n. 9194, 9315, 9528; and that the Lord expelled all the human that was from the mother, until at last He was not her son, n. 9315; and that the "Son of man," as the Lord called Himself, is not the son of Mary but the Divine truth, n. 9807.)  [2] That where the Lord is treated of "glorification" denotes the unition of His Human with the Divine Itself which was in Him, thus with Jehovah His Father, by which unition He made His Human also the Divine good, is manifest from the passages in the Word where mention is made of "glory," and "glorification," when spoken of Jehovah or the Lord, as in these passages:      The glory of Jehovah shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it (Isa. 40:5).      I Jehovah have called thee in righteousness, to open the blind eyes, to bring forth from the prison him that is bound; I am Jehovah; this is My name, and My glory will I not give to another (Isa. 42:6-8).      Jehovah shall arise upon thee, and His glory shall be seen upon thee; the nations shall walk to thy light (Isa. 60:2, 3). These passages treat of the Lord, and by "the glory of Jehovah" is meant the Lord as to Divine truth, for the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord is the "glory of Jehovah" (n. 9429). That Divine truth is from no other source, the Lord teaches in John:      Ye have neither ever heard the voice of the Father, nor seen His shape (John 5:37). And as it is the Lord that is treated of, it is Jehovah Himself, for He says, "I am Jehovah, this is My name, and My glory will I not give to another." [3] Hence also it is that the Lord is called the "King of glory," as in David:      Lift up your heads, O ye gates, and be ye lifted up, ye doors of the world, and the King of glory shall come in. Who is this King of glory? Jehovah strong and a Hero, Jehovah a Hero of war (Ps. 24:7-10). The Lord is here called the "King of glory" from the Divine truth from which He fought, conquered, and subdued the hells; that this was done from His Human when He was in the world, see n. 9715, 9809, 10019; hence it is that He is called "Jehovah strong and a Hero of war," and a "Hero" also in Isaiah:      Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and His name is God, Hero, the Father of Eternity (Isa. 9:6). [4] That "the glory of Jehovah" denotes the Lord as to the Divine truth proceeding from His Divine good, which is Jehovah or the Father, the Lord Himself teaches in John:      The Word was made flesh, and we saw His glory, as of the glory of the only-begotten of the Father (John 1:14); that the Lord is here meant by the "Word which was made flesh," is manifest; "the Word" denotes the Divine truth, and so also does "glory." Again:      The Son of man shall come in the glory of His Father (Matt. 16:27).      Jesus said to the disciples, Ought not the Christ to suffer this, and to enter into His glory? (Luke 24:26); "to enter into His glory" denotes to be united to the Divine good which was in Him, thus to Jehovah or His Father. [5] From this is plain what is meant by "being glorified" in the following passages:      The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39).      These things knew not the disciples of Jesus; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered. Jesus said, The hour is come that the Son of man should be glorified. And He said, Father, glorify Thy name. There came forth a voice from heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again (John 12:16, 23, 27, 28).      After Judas was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him; and God shall glorify Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him (John 13:31-32). From this it is evident that the unition of the Lord as to the Human with the Divine Itself that was in Him and is called Jehovah the Father, is "glorification," for it is said that "God will glorify Him in Himself." It is also plain that this unition was fully accomplished by the passion of the cross, which was the last of the temptations. (That through combats with the hells, which are temptations, the Lord glorified His Human, see the places cited in n. 9528, 9937.) [6] That since the Lord was glorified the Divine truth proceeds from Him, He Himself teaches in these passages:      The Holy Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified (John 7:39).      The Paraclete, the Spirit of truth, whom I will send to you, shall not speak from Himself. He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine, and shall declare it unto you. All things whatsoever the Father hath, are Mine (John 13-15, 28); "the Spirit of truth" denotes the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord (n. 9818); the unition of the Human with the Divine in Him is also here described by its being said that "all things which the Father Hath are His;" and in another place, that "the Father and He are one;" and that "the Father is in Him, and He in the Father" (John 10:30; 14:10, 11; n. 3704); thus that the glorification or unition was reciprocal, which also the Lord teaches in John:      Father, glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee (John 17:1); "the Father" denotes the Divine Itself that was in Him, and "the Son" denotes the Divine Human. (That "the Father" denotes the Divine good that was in the Lord, see n. 3704, 7499; also that "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord, n. 2921, 6303, 8865; and that the Lord is the Divine Itself or Jehovah under a human form, see the places cited in n. 9315.) </p>

<p>It is an odor of rest. That this signifies perceptivity of peace, is evident from the signification of "odor," as being perceptivity (see n. 3577, 4624-4634, 4748); and from the signification of "rest," as being peace. (What Divine peace is in the heavens, see n. 92, 93, 2780, 5662, 8455, 8665, 8722; also that in the supreme sense "peace" denotes the Lord, and the Divine proceeding from Him affecting with good in the heavens from the inmost, n. 3780, 8517.) The burnt-offering is called "an odor of rest to Jehovah," because by the burnt offering was represented the unition of the Divine Human of the Lord with the Divine Itself (see above n. 10053); and through this unition peace was acquired in the heavens; for all the hells were subjugated by the Lord when He was in the world, and all the heavens were reduced into order (n. 9715, 9809, 9937, 10019). From this it is plain whence it is that the burnt-offering is called "an odor of rest to Jehovah," as in many other places where the burnt-offerings and the meat-offerings are treated of (Lev. 1:9, 13, 17; 2:2, 9, 12; 3:5; 4:31; 6:6, 15; 8:28; 23:13, 18; Num. 15:3, 7, 13; 28:6, 8, 13; 29:2, 6, 13). </p>

<p>An offering made by fire to Jehovah is this. That this signifies all things from the Divine love, is evident from the signification of "an offering by fire to Jehovah," as being that it is from the Divine love, for "fire" in the Word signifies love in both senses, and when said of Jehovah or the Lord, it signifies the Divine love. (That "fire" denotes love in both senses, see n. 4906, 5215, 6314, 7324; and that in the supreme sense, in which it relates to Jehovah or the Lord, it denotes the Divine love, n. 6832, 6834, 6849.) The burnt-offering is called "an offering by fire to Jehovah" because the Divine assumed the Human, and from the Human fought against the hells and subjugated them, and at the same time united it to the Divine, to save the human race, from pure love; and that this unition is signified by the burnt-offering, see n. 10042, 10053. </p>

<p>Verses 19-35. And thou shalt take the second ram; and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. And thou shalt slay the ram, and shalt take of its blood, and shalt put it upon the lap of the ear of Aaron, and upon the lap of the right ear of his sons, and upon the thumb of their right hand, and upon the great toe of their right foot, and thou shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar, and of the oil of anointing, and shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him; and he shall be holy, and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. And thou shalt take of the ram the fat, and the tail, and the fat that covereth the intestines, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right hind quarter; because a ram of fillings is he; and one loaf of bread, and one cake of bread with oil, and one wafer, out of the basket of unleavened things that is before Jehovah; and thou shalt put the whole upon the palms of Aaron, and upon the palms of his sons; and shalt wave them a wave-offering before Jehovah. And thou shalt take them from their hand, and shalt burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering for an odor of rest before Jehovah; an offering by fire is this to Jehovah. And thou shalt take the breast from the ram of fillings, which is for Aaron, and shalt wave it a wave-offering before Jehovah; and it shall be to thee for a portion. And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the waving, and the hind quarter of the uplifting, which is waved, and which is uplifted, from the ram of fillings, of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons; and it shall be to Aaron and his sons for a statute of an age from among the sons of Israel; for this is an uplifting; and it shall be an uplifting from among the sons of Israel of their peace sacrifices, their uplifting to Jehovah. And the garments of holiness which are for Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed in them, and to fill in them their hand. Seven days shall the priest after him of his sons put them on, who shall enter into the Tent of meeting to minister in the holy. And thou shalt take the ram of fillings, and boil its flesh in a holy place. And Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread that is in the basket, at the door of the Tent of meeting. And they shall eat those things wherein expiation was made, to fill their hand, to sanctify them; and a stranger shall not eat, because they are holy. And if there be anything left of the flesh of fillings, and of the bread, unto the morning, thou shalt burn what is left with fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy. And thus shalt thou do to Aaron and to his sons, according to all that I have commanded thee; seven days shalt thou fill their hand. "And thou shalt take the second ram," signifies the following state, which is of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens; "and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram" signifies the communication of power with the whole;

"and thou shalt take of the ram the fat" signifies good in the heavens; "and the tail" signifies all truth there; "and the fat that covereth the intestines" signifies good in ultimates; "and the caul of the liver" signifies the interior good of the natural man purified; "and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them" signifies the interior truth of the natural man purified, and its good; "and the right hind quarter" signifies inmost good; "because a ram of fillings is he" signifies a representative of the Divine power of the Lord in the heavens through the Divine truth from his Divine good; "and one loaf of bread" signifies inmost celestial good from the Lord; "and one cake of bread with oil" signifies middle celestial good; "and one wafer" signifies ultimate celestial good; "out of the basket of unleavened things" signifies which are together in the sensuous; "that is before Jehovah" signifies from the Divine good of the Lord; "and thou shalt put all upon the palms of Aaron, and upon the palms of his sons" signifies the acknowledgment in the heavens that these things are of the Lord and from the Lord; "and shalt wave them a wave-offering before Jehovah" signifies the consequent Divine life; "and thou shalt take them from their hand, and shalt burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering" signifies unition with the Divine good of the Divine love;

"and the hind quarter of the uplifting" signifies the Divine celestial, that belongs to the Lord alone, perceived in heaven and in the church; "which is waved, and which is uplifted" signifies which is acknowledged and perceived; "from the ram of fillings, of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons" signifies a representative of the Divine power of the Lord in the heavens through Divine truth from Divine good; "and it shall be to Aaron and his sons for a statute of an age from among the sons of Israel" signifies a law of order in the representative church in respect to the Divine good of the Lord and the Divine truth thence proceeding;

<p>And thou shalt take the second ram. That this signifies the following state, which is of Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens, is evident from what goes before and what follows; in what goes before, the subject treated of was the sacrifices from the bullock, and the burnt-offering from the first ram; in what follows, the subject treated of is the second ram, and the filling of the hand by it; and lastly the sacrifice from the bullock, and the daily burnt-offering from lambs. Who cannot see, if he thinks from reason in some measure enlightened, that arcana of heaven lie concealed in these details? For otherwise to what purpose would have been the sacrifices and burnt-offerings with so many rituals; as that the altar should be drenched with blood, and that blood should be put upon the lap of the ear, the thumb of the hand, and the great toe of the foot, of Aaron and of his sons, and also upon their garments; and that in the sacrifice the fat of the intestines, of the liver, and of the kidneys, together with the kidneys themselves, should be burned upon the altar, and the rest should be burned with fire outside the camp, or should be eaten; and in the burnt-offering, that the intestines and the legs placed on the pieces and the head should be burned; also that the parts of the second ram should first be waved on the palms of Aaron and his sons, and that some parts of it should be eaten. Let anyone who wishes, consider whether such things would not have been merely earthily and of no account if they had not involved holy arcana; and if they involve holy arcana, these must of necessity be such as belong to heaven and the church, and in the supreme sense to the Lord, for these alone are holy, because Divine. If there be faith that the Word is holy and inspired by the Divine in respect to each and all things, there must also be faith that each and all things that were instituted concerning the sacrifices and burnt-offerings comprehend and contain within them such arcana. But what they comprehend and contain within them cannot possibly be known on earth, unless it is known what is signified by such things in the heavens; and what is signified the internal sense of the Word alone teaches, because this sense unfolds the correspondences. For all things in the natural world correspond to those in the spiritual world, for the reason that the former world comes forth and subsists from the latter. [2] But what the sacrifices and burnt-offerings described in this chapter involve, will be told in a series by unfolding the correspondences by means of the internal sense. In the supreme sense, in which all holy things are Divine, the glorification of the Lord's Human is treated of, and in the representative sense the regeneration of man. The very process of the glorification of the Lord's Human, and of the regeneration of man, is fully described by the things commanded concerning the sacrifices and burnt-offerings; and in order that this process may be apprehended, I may set it forth by means of such things as can fall into the understanding. It is known that what is seen with the eyes and heard with the ears is perceived inwardly with man, and as it were passes out of the world through the eyes or ears into the thought, thus into the understanding, for the thought is of the understanding; and if they are such things as are loved, they pass from this into the will, and from the will by way of the understanding into the speech of the mouth, and also into the act of the body. Such is the circle of things out of the world through the natural man into his spiritual man, and from this again into the world. But be it known that this circle is instituted from the will, which is the inmost of man's life, and that it begins there, and is from this accomplished; and the will of a man who is in good is directed from heaven by the Lord, though it appears otherwise. For there is an influx from the spiritual world into the natural, thus through the internal man into his external, but not the reverse; for the internal man is in heaven, but the external in the world.  [3] As this circle is the circle of man's life, therefore during man's regeneration he is regenerated according to the same, and when he has been regenerated, he lives and acts in accordance with it. Therefore during man's regeneration the truths which are to be of faith are insinuated through the hearing and sight, and these truths are implanted in the memory of his natural man. From this memory they are withdrawn into the thought that belongs to the understanding, and those which are loved become of the will; and insofar as they become of the will, they become of the life, for the will of man is his very life; and insofar as they become of the life, they become of his affection, thus of charity in the will and of faith in the understanding. Afterward the man speaks and acts from this life, which is the life of charity and of faith; from charity which is of the will goes forth the speech of the mouth and also the act of the body, both by way of the understanding, thus by the way of faith. From all this it is evident that the circle of the regeneration of man is like the circle of his life in general; and that it is in like manner instituted in the will by means of an influx out of heaven from the Lord. [4] Hence also it is plain that there are two states in the man who is being regenerated, the first when the truths of faith are being implanted and conjoined with the good of charity, the second when he speaks from the good of charity by means of the truths of faith, and acts according to these; thus that the first state is from the world through the natural man into the spiritual, thus into heaven; and the second is from heaven through the spiritual man into the natural, thus into the world. As said above, the spiritual or internal man is in heaven, and the natural or external man is in the world. This circle is the circle of the regeneration of man, and consequently is the circle of his spiritual life (concerning this twofold state of the man who is being regenerated, see the places cited in n. 9274).  [5] From what has been said, some idea may be formed of the glorification of the Lord's Human; for as the Lord glorified His Human, so He regenerates man, and therefore, as already often said, the regeneration of man is an image of the glorification of the Lord. From this it is evident that the first state of His glorification was to make His Human Divine truth, and to unite it with the Divine good that was in Him; and that the second state was to act from Divine good through Divine truth. For heaven and the church are founded through the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good; and through this are regenerated all who are in the church. These are the things described by the sacrifices and burnt-offerings, and their rituals, that are treated of in this chapter. By the sacrifice from the bullock and by the burnt-offering from the first ram is described the first state; and by the fillings of the hand from the second ram is described the second state; and finally by the sacrifice from the bullock, and by the burnt-offerings, is signified the continuance of this. [6] Be it known that with a man who is being regenerated, purification from evils and their falsities goes on continually, for insofar as a man is purified from evils and falsities, so far are implanted the truths which are of faith, and these are conjoined with the good which is of charity, and insofar the man afterward acts from the good of charity. Purification from evils and falsities with man is not liberation from them, but is their removal (see n. 868, 887, 894, 929, 1581, 2269, 2406, 4564, 8206, 8393, 8988, 9014, 9333, 9446-9451, 9938). But with the Lord there was not removal, but casting out of those things which He derived from the mother, thus full and complete liberation from them, insomuch that He was no longer the Son of Mary (see the places cited in n. 9315, at the end). All this has been premised in order that it may be known what is signified by the filling of the hand from the second ram, of which in what now follows. </p>

<p>And Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon the head of the ram. That this signifies the communication of power with the whole, is evident from the signification of "laying on hands," as being the communication, transfer, and reception of power (see n. 10023); and from the signification of "the head," as being the whole together with the parts (n. 10011), thus each and all things that were represented by this second ram. </p>

<p>And thou shalt slay the ram. That this signifies preparation, is evident from the signification of "slaying," when said of the sacrifice and burnt-offering, as being preparation (see n. 10024). </p>

<p>And shalt take of its blood. That this signifies the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens, is evident from the signification of "blood," when said of the sacrifice and burnt-offering, as being Divine truth (see above, n. 10026, 10033); here the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good of the Lord's Divine Human communicated and received in the heavens, for this is the subject treated of in what now follows. It was said above (see n. 10057), that there are two states in the man who is being regenerated, the first when truth is being implanted, and this is being conjoined with good, the second when the man is in good, and acts from good. When he is in this latter state, then the truths with him proceed from good, for he regards them, speaks them, and acts them from good. Then good is in every detail, just as the soul is in man, or as the heart is in the body, which is also perceived by a wise person from the words and acts of those who are in good. From this idea of the regeneration of man something can be thought about the glorification of the Lord's Human, for the Lord regenerates man after the manner in which He glorified His Human (n. 3138, 3212, 3296, 3490, 4402, 5688). For the first state of the glorification of His Human was the implantation of Divine truth, and its unition with Divine good; consequently when the Lord was in the world He made His Human Divine truth, and also by unition with the Divine good which was in Him, He made it Divine good (see the places cited in n. 9199, 9315). The second state of His glorification is that from the Divine good proceeds the Divine truth, which is His Divine in the heavens. The first state of the glorification of the Lord's Human is described in the internal sense by what is said of the sacrifice from the bullock, and the burnt-offering from the first ram, from the tenth to the eighteenth verse of this chapter; but the second state is described by what now follows about the second ram, which is called "the ram of fillings." From this it is evident that by "blood" is here signified the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good communicated and received in the heavens. </p>

<p>And shalt put it upon the lap of the ear of Aaron, and upon the lap of the right ear of his sons. That this signifies all perceptivity of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens, is evident from the signification of the "blood" that was put upon the lap of the ear, as being the Divine truth in the heavens and in the church that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good (see just above, n. 10060); from the signification of "the ear," as being perceptivity (n. 9397), here perceptivity of Divine truth in the heavens and in the church, for all perceptivity therein is from this source. There is here specifically meant the perceptivity in the celestial kingdom, for truth is there perceived from good (see the places cited in n. 9277); from the signification of the "earlap," which is the outermost of the ear, as being all or the whole, for as by what is first or highest is signified all or the whole, so also this is signified by what is last or outermost (see n. 10044); and from the signification of "the right ear," as being perceptivity of truth from good. The "right ear" has this signification for the reason that those things which are on the right side of man correspond to the good from which are truths, and those which are on the left correspond to the truths through which is good (n. 9604, 9736). So it is in the brain, so in the face, and the organs of sense there, so in the breast, so in the loins, and so in the feet. [2] He who does not know this secret cannot possibly know why it was commanded that the blood should be put upon the lap of the right ear, upon the thumb of the right hand, and upon the great toe of the right foot, of Aaron and his sons; and that of this ram, besides the fat, the right hind quarter should be burned upon the altar (of which below in this chapter, verses 22, 25); and in like manner that the blood of the sacrifice should be put upon the lap of the right ear of him that was to be cleansed from leprosy, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot; and that the priest should pour from the log of oil upon his left palm, and should dip his right finger in the oil which was upon his left palm, and should sprinkle it with his right finger seven times before Jehovah (Lev. 14:14-18, 25-28). Nor can he know what is signified by what the Lord said to the disciples when they were fishing-that they should cast the net on the right side of the ship, and that when they cast they took so many that they were not able to draw the net by reason of the multitude of fishes (John 21:6).  By this was represented that to act and teach from good is to conclude innumerable things that belong to truth; but not the converse. Moreover, they who are in truths from good are meant by the sheep on the right hand, but they who are in truths not from good are meant by the goats on the left hand (Matt. 25:32). [3] By the "right hand" are also meant those who are in the light of truth from good, in David:      The heavens are Thine, the earth also is Thine; the world and the fullness thereof Thou hast founded; the north and the right hand Thou hast created (Ps. 89:11, 12); where by "the heavens," "the earth," and "the world," is signified the church (see n. 9325); by "fullness," all truth and good, which make the church; by "the north," those therein who are in an obscure state as to truth (n. 3708); and by "the right hand," those who are in the light of truth from good; thus the same as by "the south" (n. 9642). From this it can be seen what is signified by "sitting on the right hand of God," when said of the Lord (Ps. 110:1, 5; Matt. 26:63, 64; Mark 12:36; 14:61, 62; Luke 20:42, 43; 22:69), namely, Divine power through the Divine truth proceeding from His Divine good (n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 8281, 9133). [4] As most things in the Word have also an opposite sense, so also have the right and the left, and in this sense "the right" signifies the evil from which is falsity, and "the left" the falsity through which is evil, as in Zechariah:      Woe to the worthless shepherd that deserteth the flock! The sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye; his arm withering shall wither, and his right eye darkening shall be darkened (Zech. 11:17); here "arm" denotes the power of truth applied to confirm evil, of which power, as it is worthless, it is said that "withering it shall wither;" and the "right eye" denotes the memory-knowledge of good applied to confirm falsity, of which knowledge, as it is worthless, it is said that "darkening it shall be darkened;" a "shepherd" denotes one who teaches truths, and by means of these leads to good (n. 343, 3795, 6044); hence a "worthless shepherd" denotes one who teaches and leads to evil; "arm" denotes the power of truth from good (n. 4931-4937, 7205); but the "arm of a worthless shepherd" denotes no power; the "eye" denotes the understanding and perception of truth (n. 4403-4421, 4523-4534, 9051); but the "right eye of a worthless shepherd" denotes the memory-knowledge of good without the understanding and perception of it, because it is applied to falsity; "thick darkness" denotes the falsity that is from evil (n. 7711). [5] Matthew:      Jesus said, If thy right eye hath caused thee to stumble, pluck it out, and cast it from thee. And if thy right hand hath caused thee to stumble, cut it off, and cast it from thee; it is better for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not thy whole body be cast into Gehenna (Matt. 5:29, 30); where the "right eye" denotes the understanding and faith of falsity from evil, and the "right hand," the falsity itself from evil. Everyone is able to know that by "eye" is not here meant the eye, nor by "right hand" the right hand; and that the eye that causeth to stumble is not to be plucked out, nor the hand that causeth to stumble to be cut off; for from this there would be nothing of salvation for man. In John:      The beast gave all a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads (Rev. 13:16); where the "right hand" denotes falsity from evil, and the "forehead" the love of evil from which is falsity (that the "forehead" denotes heavenly love, and hence in the opposite sense infernal love, see n. 9936). </p>

<p>And upon the thumb of their right hand. That this signifies the understanding thence derived in the middle heaven, is evident from the signification of "the thumb of the hand," as being the power of good through truth, or truth in its power from good, and the understanding thence derived (of which below). That it denotes the understanding in the middle heaven is because by the "blood" which was put on the thumb of the hand, is signified the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens (see above n. 10060), here therefore the understanding thence derived; for by the "blood on the lap of the right ear" is signified the perceptivity in the inmost heaven; consequently by the "blood on the thumb of the right hand" is signified the understanding in the middle heaven; and by the "great toe of the right foot" is signified the understanding in the ultimate heaven; for the things that belong to the inmost heaven are signified by the head, and by the things of the head, here therefore its perceptivity, by the "right ear," for this belongs to the head; and the things that belong to the middle heaven are signified by the body, and by the things of the body, here therefore the understanding, by the "right hand;" and the things that belong to the ultimate heaven are signified by the feet, and by the things of the feet. (That such is the correspondence of the heavens with man, see above, n. 10030, and in the places there cited.) Moreover, in the inmost heaven there is perceptivity of truth from good; but in the middle heaven there is no perceptivity of truth, but understanding of it, and so in the ultimate heaven (see the places cited in n. 9277, 9596, 9684). [2] As to the thumb of the right hand signifying truth from good in its power and the consequent understanding in the middle heaven, this does indeed appear too low a thing and not of sufficient importance to signify heaven, for it may be thought, whence has the thumb such and so important a signification? But be it known that the ultimate or extreme part of any member signifies the same as the whole member, and the "hand" the whole power of the body, for the body has power by means of the arms and hands (that the ultimate or extreme part signifies all and the whole, in like manner as does what is first and highest, see n. 10044). [3] (That the "hands" signify power, and that all power is of truth from good, see the places cited in n. 10019; and that the "right hand" signifies the power of truth from good, and the "left hand," the truth through which is good, n. 10061.) The understanding is meant because all the understanding is formed from truths, and all the will from goods; for all things in the world and in heaven bear relation to truth and to good, and the understanding of man was given for truths, and the will for goods; therefore as by the "hand" is signified truth in its power, the understanding is also signified. [4] As the "thumb of the hand," in like manner as the "hand," signified the power which truth has from good, therefore in ancient times among the nations, and also with the Israelitish people, it was usual to cut off the thumbs of the hands and the great toes of the feet of their enemies (Judges 1:6, 7), by which was represented taking away all power; in the thumb also is the primary power of the hand, for when that is cut off, the hand is no longer of any avail in war. [5] Like the thumb, the "fingers" also signify power, as in these passages:      Jehovah teacheth my hands fighting, and my fingers war (Ps. 144:1).      When I view the heavens, the work of Thy fingers (Ps. 8:3).      Jesus said, If I by the finger of God cast out demons, then is the kingdom of God come unto you (Luke 11:20). </p>

<p>And upon the great toe of their right foot. That this signifies the understanding in the ultimate heaven, is evident from what has been said and shown just above (see n. 10062). </p>

<p>And thou shalt sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about. That this signifies the unition of Divine truth with Divine good, is evident from the signification of "blood," when said of the sacrifice and burnt-offering, as being Divine truth (see above, n. 10026, 10033); and from the signification of "the altar," as being a representative of the Lord as to Divine good (n. 9964). When Divine good is mentioned, Divine love is also meant, because all good is of love, for whatever is loved is perceived as good, and consequently is also called good. But all truth is of faith; for whatever is believed is perceived as truth, and is also so called. From this it follows that those things which form the understanding of man are of faith, and those which form the will are of love, for the understanding of man has been set apart to receive the truths of faith, and his will to receive the goods of love. The understanding of man is therefore such as are the truths which form it, and such as is the faith of these truths; and the will of man is such as are the goods which make it, and such as is the love of these goods. In the opposite sense there are the love of evil and the faith of falsity, and from these also a will and understanding; but the understanding is such as is the falsity which forms it, and as is the faith of the falsity; and the will is such as is the evil which makes it, and as is the love of the evil. That the will of evil and the understanding of falsity are from hell, and that they are hell with man, is evident, because they are opposite to the understanding of truth and the will of good, which are from heaven from the Lord, and thus make heaven with man. </p>

<p>And thou shalt take of the blood that is upon the altar. That this signifies Divine truth united to Divine good in the Lord, is evident from the signification of "the blood on the altar," as being Divine truth united to Divine good (of which just above, n. 10064). How the case herein is will be told in what presently follows. </p>

<p>And of the oil of anointing. That this signifies the Divine good of the Divine love which is in the Lord, is evident from the signification of "the oil of anointing," as being a representative of the Divine good of the Divine love which is in the Lord (see n. 9954, 10019). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10067.">10067.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And shalt sprinkle it upon Aaron, and upon his garments. That this signifies the reciprocal unition of Divine good and Divine truth in the higher heavens, is evident from the representation of Aaron, as being the Lord as to Divine good (see n. 9806), which is the Divine good of the Lord in the celestial kingdom (see n. 9946), or what is the same, in the higher heavens; and from the signification of the "garments of Aaron," as being a representative of the spiritual kingdom of the Lord adjoined to His celestial kingdom (n. 9814); and from the signification of "sprinkling" upon them, as being to unite, for that which was sprinkled and poured upon anyone represented unition (as also above, in that the blood was to be sprinkled upon the altar round about, n. 10064). [2] That the Divine Human of the Lord in the heavens is meant, is because in this passage and in what now follows the subject treated of is the Divine of the Lord in the heavens, and His unition with the angels there, thus the second state of the glorification of the Lord's Human (n. 10057). Therefore here by Aaron is represented the Lord as to Divine good in the celestial kingdom; and by his garments, as to Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom adjoined to the celestial kingdom; thus as to both in the higher heavens. That it is the Divine Human from which these things are, is because no other Divine is acknowledged and worshiped in the heavens than the Divine Human of the Lord; for the Divine which the Lord called His "Father," was the Divine in Him. That in the heavens no other Divine is acknowledged and worshiped than the Lord as to the Divine Human, can be seen from many of the Lord's words in the Evangelists as from these:      All things are delivered unto Me by the Father (Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22).      The Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son (John 3:34, 35).      The Father hath given to the Son power over all flesh (John 17:2).      Without Me ye can do nothing (John 15:5).      Father, all Mine are Thine, and all Thine are Mine (John 17:10).      All power hath been given unto Me in the heavens and on earth (Matt. 28:18).      Jesus said to Peter, I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in the heavens; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (Matt. 16:19). [3] That this is so is also plain from the fact that no one can be conjoined by faith and love with the Divine Itself without the Divine Human; for the Divine Itself, which is called the "Father," cannot be thought of, because it is incomprehensible, and what cannot be thought of cannot become a matter of faith, nor therefore an object of love; when yet the chief of all worship is to believe in God, and to love Him above all things. That the Divine Itself, which is the "Father," is incomprehensible, the Lord also teaches in John:      No man hath ever seen God; the only-begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath set Him forth (John 1:18).      Ye have neither ever heard the voice of the Father, nor seen His shape (John 5:37). [4] And that the Divine Itself, which is the "Father," is comprehensible in the Lord through His Divine Human, He again teaches in these passages:      He that seeth Me, seeth Him who sent Me (12:45).      If ye have known Me, ye have known My Father also; and henceforth ye have known Him, and have seen Him. He that seeth Me, seeth the Father (John 14:6-11).      All things have been delivered unto Me of My Father; and no one knoweth the Son, save the Father; neither doth anyone know the Father save the Son, and he to whom the Son shall be willing to reveal Him (Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22). That it is also said, "no one knoweth the Son but the Father," is because by the "Son" is meant the Divine truth, and by the "Father," the Divine good, both in the Lord; and the one cannot be known except from the other; and therefore the Lord first says that all things have been delivered to Him by the Father, and then that he knoweth Him to whom the Son willeth to reveal Him. (That the "Son" denotes the Divine truth, and the "Father," the Divine good, both of the Lord, see n. 2803, 2813, 3704, 7499, 8328, 8897, 9807.) From all this it is now evident that the Divine in the heavens is the Divine Human of the Lord. [5] What was represented by the blood of the second ram being sprinkled upon the altar round about, and by taking of this blood, and of the oil of anointing, and sprinkling upon Aaron and upon his garments, shall now be told. That these things signified the unition of Divine truth with Divine good, and of Divine good with Divine truth, in the Lord's Divine Human, is plain from what has been already said and shown (n. 10064-10067). But the secret which lies within has not yet been disclosed. This secret is that there was a reciprocal unition of Divine good and Divine truth, thus of the Divine Itself which is called the "Father," and of the Divine truth which is called the "Son." The unition of Divine truth with Divine good is signified by the sprinkling of the blood upon the altar (n. 10064); these united are signified by the blood upon the altar, from which it was to be taken (n. 10065), and by the oil of the anointing, by which was signified the Divine good (see n. 10066); consequently the reciprocal unition of Divine truth and Divine good in the Lord's Divine Human is signified by the sprinkling of this blood, and at the same time of the oil of anointing, upon Aaron and upon his garments (see just above). [6] That the unition was reciprocal is very evident from the words of the Lord in the following passages:      The Father and I are one; though ye believe not Me, believe the works; that ye may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in the Father (John 10:30, 38).      Believest thou not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me? Believe Me, that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me (John 14:10-11).      Jesus said, Father, the hour is come; glorify Thy Son, that Thy Son also may glorify Thee. All things that are Mine are Thine, and all Thine are Mine (John 17:1, 10).      Now hath the Son of man been glorified; and God hath been glorified in Him; and God shall glorify Him in Himself (John 13:31-32). From these passages it can be seen that the Divine good of the Divine love, which is the "Father," was united to the Divine truth, which is the "Son," reciprocally in the Lord; and hence that His Human itself is Divine good. The like is also signified by His "coming forth from the Father, and coming into the world, and going to the Father" (John 16:27-29); and by "all things of the Father being His" (John 16:15); and by "the Father and He being one" (John 10:30). [7] But these things can be better apprehended from the reciprocal conjunction of good and truth in the man who is being regenerated by the Lord, for as before said the Lord regenerates man as He glorified His Human (n. 10057). When the Lord is regenerating man, He insinuates the truth which is to be of faith in the man's understanding, and the good which is to be of love in his will, and therein conjoins them; and when they have been conjoined, then the truth which is of faith has its life from the good which is of love, and the good which is of love has the quality of its life from the truth which is of faith. This conjunction is reciprocally accomplished by means of good, and is called the heavenly marriage, and is heaven with man. In this heaven the Lord dwells as in His own, for all the good of love is from Him, and also all the conjunction of truth with good. The Lord cannot dwell in anything of man's own, because it is evil. [8] This reciprocal conjunction is what is meant by the words of the Lord in John:      In that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and ye in Me, and I in you (John 14:20).      All thing of Mine are Thine, and Thine are Mine, but I have been glorified in them. That they all may be one, as Thou Father art in Me, and I in them, and that they may be one in us (John 17:10, 21, 22). Reciprocal conjunction is thus described; but still it is not meant that man conjoins himself with the Lord, but that the Lord conjoins with Himself the man who desists from evils; for to desist from evils has been left to the man's decision, and when he desists, then is effected the reciprocal conjunction of the truth which is of faith and of the good which is of love from the Lord, and not at all from man; for that from himself man can do nothing of good, and thus can receive nothing of truth in good, has been known in the church; and this also the Lord confirms in John:      Abide in Me, and I In you. He that abideth in Me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit; for without Me ye can do nothing (John 15:4, 6). [9] This reciprocal conjunction can be illustrated from the conjunction of the understanding and will in man; his understanding is formed from truths, and his will from goods; and truths are of faith with him, and goods are of love. Man imbibes truths from hearing, through the sense of hearing; and from reading through the sight; and stores them up in his memory. These truths relate either to the civil state, or to the moral state, and are called memory-knowledges. The love of man which is of his will through the understanding looks into these things in the memory, and from it chooses those which are in agreement with the love; and those which it chooses, it summons to itself, and conjoins with itself, and by means of them strengthens itself from day to day. Truths thus vivified by love make the man's understanding, and the goods themselves which are of the love make his will. The goods of love are also like fires there, and truths in the circumferences round about, vivified by the love, are like the light from this fire. By degrees, as the truths are kindled by this fire, there is kindled in them a desire to conjoin themselves reciprocally. From this comes a reciprocal conjunction, which is permanent. [10] From all this it is evident that the good of love is really that which conjoins, and not the truth of faith, except insofar as this has the good of love within it. Whether you say love, or good, it is the same, for all good is of love, and that which is of love is called good; and also whether you say love, or the will, it is likewise the same, for that which a man loves he wills. [11] Be it known that the things which are of the civil or moral state, just now spoken of, conjoin themselves in the external man; but those which are of the spiritual state, before spoken of, conjoin themselves in the internal man, and then through the internal in the external. For the things of the spiritual state, which are truths of faith and goods of love to the Lord, and which look to eternal life, communicate with the heavens, and open the internal man, and they open it insofar and in such a way as the truths of faith are received in the good of love to the Lord and toward the neighbor, from the Lord. From this it is evident that those are only external men who do not at the same time imbue themselves with those things which are of the spiritual state; and that those are merely sensuous men who deny these things, however intelligently they may seem to talk. </p>

<p>And upon his sons, and upon the garments of his sons with him. That this signifies the reciprocal unition of Divine good and Divine truth from the Divine Human of the Lord in the lower heavens, is evident from the fact that when by the sprinkling of the blood from the altar, and of the oil of anointing, upon Aaron, is signified the reciprocal unition of Divine good and Divine truth from the Lord's Divine Human in the higher heavens (see n. 10067), by the like upon the sons of Aaron and their garments is signified such a unition in the lower heavens. For the Divine of the Lord in the lower heavens is represented by the sons of Aaron, when the Divine of the Lord in the higher heavens is represented by Aaron himself; which is because the lower heavens are born from the higher, as sons from a father (n. 7004, 9468, 9473, 9680, 9683, 9780). Be it known that by the higher heavens is meant the celestial kingdom of the Lord, and by the lower heavens His spiritual kingdom. (That the heavens are distinguished into two kingdoms has been frequently said and shown.) In both kingdoms the Divine of the Lord is similar, but is dissimilar in respect to the reception by the angels in them. </p>

<p>And he shall be holy, and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him. That this signifies so with all Divine things in the heavens, is evident from the signification of "holy," as being that which proceeds from the Lord, because He alone is holy (see n. 9229, 9479, 9680, 9818, 9820, 9956, 9988), thus what is Divine; and because by Aaron and his garments, and by his sons and their garments, were represented holy or Divine things in the heavens (n. 10067, 10068), therefore by them are signified all Divine things in the heavens. That Aaron, his sons, and their garments, were called "holy," because they represented holy Divine things, is evident; for everyone who duly considers may know that neither the blood of a ram nor the oil of anointing can sanctify anyone; for blood and oil are dead things, and thus cannot affect the interiors of man; man's interiors themselves are affected solely by the truths of faith and the good of love from the Lord to the Lord, thus by things Divine, and these sanctify because they alone are holy. </p>

<p>And thou shalt take of the ram the fat. That this signifies good in the heavens, is evident from the signification of "fat," as being good (see n. 10033); that it denotes in the heavens, is because by the filling of the hand from the second ram is signified the Divine that proceeds from the Lord in the heavens (n. 10057). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10071.">10071.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the tail. That this signifies all truth there, is evident from the signification of "the tail of the ram," as being truth. That "the tail" denotes truth is because it is the ultimate thing, and truth is in the ultimates (see n. 6952). Moreover, the tail is the ultimate of the cerebrum and cerebellum, for these are continued into the spinal marrow, and this also terminates in the tail, which thus is their ultimate appendix. Therefore it is said that in the sacrifices the tail was to be removed hard by the backbone (Lev. 3:9). That "the tail" signifies truth in ultimates, and in the opposite sense falsity, is evident from the following passages. In Isaiah:      Jehovah shall cut off from Israel head and tail. The old man and the honored is the head, and the prophet, the teacher of a lie, is the tail (Isa. 9:13, 14); in the spiritual sense to "cut off the head and the tail" denotes to cut off good and truth, for the subject treated of is the church, on the devastation of which, the "head" signifies evil, and the "tail" falsity. (That the "head" denotes good, see n. 4938, 4939, 5328, 9913, 9914; in like manner an "old man," n. 6524, 9404; that a "prophet" denotes one who teaches truth, thus abstractedly truth, n. 2534, 7269.) In the opposite sense therefore the "head" denotes evil, in like manner the "old man" and the "honored" who do this; and the "tail" denotes falsity, in like manner the "prophet," whence he is called "the prophet of a lie," for a "lie" denotes falsity. In the same:      There shall not be work for Egypt, which may make head and tail (Isa. 19:15); "Egypt" denotes those who by reasonings from memory-knowledges wish to enter into the truths and goods of faith, and not from what is revealed, thus not from faith in what is revealed (n. 1164, 1165, 1186); that there is "no work which makes the head and the tail," denotes that they have neither good nor truth. That the "tail" denotes truth in ultimates is plain from its signification in the opposite sense, in which the "tail" denotes falsity, as in John:      The locusts had tails like unto scorpions, and stings were in their tails, and their power was to hurt men (Rev. 9:10); "tails like scorpions, and stings in the tails," denote cunning reasonings from falsities by which they persuade, and thereby do injury, and therefore it is said that "their power is to hurt men" (that a "locust" also denotes falsity in the extremes, see n. 7643). In the same:      The tails of the horses were like serpents, having heads, and with them they do hurt (Rev. 9:19); "tails like serpents" here also denote reasonings from falsities, whereby injury is done. In the same:      The tail of the dragon drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and cast them to the earth (Rev. 12:4); "the tail of the dragon" denotes truths falsified, especially by application to evils; the "stars" denote the knowledges of truth and good falsified; "to cast to the earth" denotes to destroy. </p>

<p>And the fat that covereth the intestines. That this signifies good in ultimates, is evident from the signification of "fat," as being good (see n. 10033); and from the signification of "the intestines," as being the ultimate and lowest things (see n. 10030, 10049). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10073.">10073.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the caul of the liver. That this signifies the interior good of the natural man purified, is evident from the signification of "the caul of the liver," as being the interior good of the external or natural man (see n. 10031). That it denotes good purified is because the liver is a purifying organ (n. 10031); and as by the "kidneys" is signified truth purified (n. 10032), hence also it is said that this caul near the kidneys shall be removed (Lev. 3:4, 10, 15). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10074.">10074.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them. That this signifies the interior truth of the natural man purified, and its good, is evident from the signification of "the kidneys," as being the interior truth of the external or natural man; and from the signification of "the fat that is upon them," as being the good of this (see n. 10032). That it is truth purified which is signified by "the kidneys," is because the kidneys are organs which purify the blood (n. 10032); and the "blood" denotes truth (n. 9393, 10026). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10075.">10075.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the right hind quarter. That this signifies inmost good, is evident from the signification of "the right hind quarter," as being inmost good. That "the right hind quarter" denotes inmost good is because the hind quarters of animals signify the same as the loins and thighs with man, and the loins and thighs with man signify conjugial love, and from this the good of celestial love, which good is the good of the inmost heaven (see n. 3021, 4277, 4280, 4575, 5050-5062, 9961), and the right loin and thigh signify the inmost good there; for the things which are on man's right signify by correspondence the good from which is truth, and those which are on his left the truth through which is good; and consequently those which are in the middle signify the conjunction of both, that is, of good and truth. From this it can also be seen that the hind quarters are the hinder parts of the animal, where its genitals are, and not the fore parts, for these are called the "breast." As the right hind quarter signifies inmost or celestial good, therefore when it was taken from the sacrifice and given to Aaron, it was called his "anointing." In Moses:      The right hind quarter shall ye give an uplifting to the priest from your eucharistic sacrifices. The breast of waving and the hind quarter of uplifting have I taken from among the sons of Israel of their eucharistic sacrifices, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons for a statute forever. This is the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons from the fire-offerings of Jehovah (Lev. 7:32, 34, 35). The breast and the hind quarter are called the "anointing" by reason of the representation of spiritual and celestial good; for from correspondence the "breast" signifies spiritual good, which is the good of the middle or second heaven; and the "right hind quarter," celestial good, which is the good of the inmost or third heaven; and the "anointing" denotes the representation of the Lord as to Divine good (n. 9954, 10019). Moreover, the breast and right hind quarter were given to Aaron from the sacrifices of the firstborn of an ox, a sheep, and a goat. That the "right hind quarter" signifies inmost good, is evident also from the fact that it is mentioned last; for the tail and the intestines are mentioned first, afterward the caul of the liver and the kidneys, and lastly the right hind quarter. The things which are mentioned first are the most external, those mentioned second are interior, and that which is mentioned last is inmost. </p>

<p>Because a ram of fillings is he. That this signifies a representative of the Divine power of the Lord in the heavens through the Divine truth from the Divine good, and its capability of communication and reception there, is evident from the signification of a "ram," as being the internal of man in respect to the good of innocence and of charity (see above, n. 9991); for all beasts signify something of affection or of inclination with man (see n. 9280); hence it is that they who are in charity and innocence are called "sheep" and "lambs." The "ram," therefore, which is the male of sheep, signifies the good of charity and of innocence in the internal man, and in the supreme sense the same in the internal of the Lord's Human; for that which in the internal sense signifies something of man, thus something of the church or of heaven with man, in the supreme sense signifies in an eminent manner a similar thing with the Lord when He was in the world. Moreover, in the inmost sense all things of the Word treat of the Lord, whence comes the holiness of the Word. And from the signification of the "fillings of the hand," as being a representative of Divine truth from the Divine good of the Lord in the heavens, and its capability of communication with the angels there, and of its reception by them; for as before shown, with the man who is being regenerated there are two states, the first when the truths which are of faith are being implanted in the good which is of love and are being conjoined, and the second when the man acts from the good of love. The like was eminently the case in the Lord; the first state of the glorification of His Human was to make it Divine truth, and to conjoin it with the Divine good which was in Him and is called the "Father," and thereby to become the Divine good of the Divine love, which is Jehovah. The second state of His glorification was to act from the Divine good of the Divine love, which is effected by means of the Divine truth that proceeds from this good.  [2] As regards man, in the first state he is imbued with those things which must be of faith, and according as he is imbued with them from good, that is, through good from the Lord, so is his understanding formed. When those truths that belong to the understanding have been implanted in and conjoined with good, he then comes into the second state, which consists in acting from good by means of truths. From this it is plain what is the quality of the second state of the man who is being regenerated, in that it is to think and act from good, or what is the same, from love, or what is also the same, from the will; for that which a man wills he loves; and that which he loves, he calls good. But the man for the first time comes into the second state when he is wholly from head to heels such as his love is, thus such as his will is and the understanding thence derived. Who can possibly believe that the whole man is an image of his will and of his understanding thence derived, consequently an image of his good and the truth thence derived, or an image of his evil and the falsity thence derived? For good or evil forms the will, and truth or falsity forms the understanding. This secret is known to all the angels in the heavens; but the reason why man does not know it is that he has no knowledge of his soul, consequently no knowledge that the body is formed after the likeness of the soul, and hence that the whole man is such as his soul is. That this is so, is clearly seen from the spirits and angels in the other life; for all of them are human forms, and such forms as their affections are, which are of love and faith; and this to such a degree that they who are in the good of love and charity may be said to be loves and charities in form; and on the other hand that those who are in evils from the loves of self and the world, thus in hatreds and the like, are hatreds in form.  [3] That this is so can also be seen from these three things which in universal nature follow in order; namely effect, cause, and end. The effect has its all from the cause; for an effect is nothing else than the cause in outward form, because when a cause becomes an effect it clothes itself with such things as are without, in order that it may appear in a lower sphere, which is the sphere of effects. The case is similar with the cause of the cause, which in the higher sphere is called the final cause, or the end. This end is the all in the cause, in order that it may be a cause for the sake of something; for a cause which is not for the sake of something cannot be called a cause, for to what purpose would it then be? The end is for the sake of something, and the end is the first in the cause, and is also its last. Hence it is plain that the end is as it were the soul of the cause, and is as it were its life, consequently is also the soul and life of the effect. For if there is not something in the cause and in the effect that brings forth the end, all this is not anything, because it is not for the sake of anything; thus it is like a dead thing without soul or life, and such a thing perishes as does the body when the soul departs from it. [4] The case is similar with man: his very soul is his will; the proximate cause by which the will produces the effect, is his understanding; and the effect which is brought forth is in the body, thus is of the body. That this is so is very manifest from the fact that what a man wills and thence thinks presents itself in a suitable manner in an effect in the body, both when he speaks and when he acts. From this it is again evident that such as is a man's will, such is the whole man. Whether you say the will, or the end, or the love, or the good, it is the same, for everything that a man wills is regarded as an end, and is loved, and is called good. In like manner whether you say the understanding, or the cause of an end, or faith, or truth, it is also the same; for that which a man understands or thinks from his will, he holds as a cause, and believes, and calls truth. When these things are apprehended, it can be known what is the quality, in the first state, of a man who is being regenerated, and what it is in the second.  [5] From all this some idea can be had how it is understood that when the Lord was in the world and glorified His Human, He first made it Divine truth, and by degrees the Divine good of the Divine love; and that thereafter from the Divine good of the Divine love He operates in heaven and in the world, and gives life to angels and men; which is effected by means of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good of the Divine love of His Divine Human; for from this the heavens have come forth, and from it they perpetually come forth, that is, subsist; or what is the same, from it the heavens have been created and from it they are perpetually being created, that is, preserved; for preservation is perpetual creation, as subsistence is perpetual coming-forth. [6] Such things are also involved by these words in John:      In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. And the Word was made flesh (John 1:1, 3, 14); "the Word" denotes the Divine truth; the first state is described by "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word;" and the second state by "all things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made." It was the same when the Lord came into the world and reduced the heavens into order, and as it were created them anew. That the Lord is there meant by "the Word," is evident, for it is said that "the Word was made flesh." The capability of the communication and perception of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Divine good of the Divine love of His Divine Human, is what is meant by the "filling of the hand," and is described by representatives in this passage concerning the second ram.  [7] As the Lord in respect to Divine good is represented by Aaron (n. 9806), therefore the glorification of the Lord as to His Human is representatively described in the process of the inauguration of Aaron and his sons. The first state of glorification is described by what is said concerning the sacrifice from the bullock and the burnt-offering from the first ram; and the second state of glorification by what is said concerning the second ram, which is called "the ram of fillings." The first state is called the "anointing," and the second is called the "filling of the hand;" consequently when Aaron and his sons were inaugurated into the priesthood by anointing and by the filling of the hand, they were said to be "anointed" and "those whose hand he hath filled," as in Moses:      The high priest, upon whose head the anointing oil is poured and who hath filled his hand to put on the garments, shall not shave his head, nor rip open his clothes (Lev. 21:10). From all this it is also plain that the filling of the hand is a representative of the communication and reception of the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good in the heavens; for it is said, "he hath filled his hand," and not "he is filled in the hand," and also "he hath filled his hand to put on the garments." For by Aaron and by his anointing is represented the Lord as to Divine good, and by his garments the like as by the filling of the hand, namely, the Divine truth that proceeds from the Lord's Divine good. (That this is represented by the garments, see n. 9814.) Its dissipation is signified by "ripping them open;" and the dispersion of Divine good in the heavens by "shaving the head." [8] As the influx and communication of Divine truth from the Lord, and its reception in the heavens, is signified by the "filling of the hand," therefore by it is also signified purification from evils and falsities; for insofar as a man or angel is purified from these, so far he receives Divine truth from the Lord. In this sense "filling the hand" is understood by these words in Moses:      The sons of Levi smote of the people three thousand men. And Moses said, Fill your hand to-day to Jehovah, that He may bestow upon you a blessing this day (Exod. 32:28-29); In the spiritual sense "to receive a blessing" denotes to be endowed with the good of love and of faith, thus to receive the Divine that proceeds from the Lord (n. 2846, 3017, 3406, 4981, 6091, 6099, 8939). We read also of "filling after Jehovah," and by this is signified doing according to Divine truth; thus also by it is signified the receptivity of it; in Moses:      Another spirit was with Caleb, and he hath filled after Jehovah (Num. 14:24; Deut. 1:36).      Jehovah sware, saying, Surely none of the men, from a son of twenty years and upward, shall see the land of which I sware unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly filled after Me, save Caleb and Joshua, who have filled after Jehovah (Num. 32:11, 12). </p>

<p>And one loaf of bread. That this signifies inmost celestial good from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "bread," as being celestial good (see n. 2165, 2177, 3478, 9545). Celestial good is the good of love to the Lord. This good, being the good of the celestial kingdom, is for this reason called celestial good. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10078.">10078.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And one cake of bread with oil. That this signifies middle celestial good, is evident from the signification of a "cake of bread with oil," as being middle celestial good (n. 9993). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10079.">10079.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And one wafer. That this signifies ultimate celestial good, is evident from the signification of a "wafer," as being celestial good in the external man (see n. 9994), thus ultimate. In the heavens there are two distinct kingdoms, of which one is called the celestial kingdom, and the other the spiritual kingdom. Each kingdom is threefold, having its inmost, its middle, and its ultimate. The inmost good of the celestial kingdom is signified by "bread," the middle good by "cakes," and the ultimate good by "wafers" (see above n. 9993). It is said that they should take one loaf of bread, and one cake, and one wafer, and that after these had been waved, they should be burnt upon the burnt-offering, and that Aaron and his sons should eat the rest of the bread in the basket at the door of the Tent of meeting. By these things were signified the capability of the communication of the good of love from the Lord, and of its reception in the higher heavens, or in the celestial kingdom, the capability of the communication, by these breads which after they had been waved were burnt on the burnt-offering; and the capability of its reception, by the breads which were eaten. It is said "one loaf of bread, one cake, and one wafer," because in itself the Divine good is one. [2] It shall now also be told why it was decreed that not only the fat of the ram and its right hind quarter were to be burnt upon the altar, but also the breads that were called the meat-offering; when yet by the "fat" and by the "hind quarter" is signified good, equally as by the "breads" or meat-offerings, for unless the reason is known why it was so done, it might seem to be like something superfluous. But the reason was that the sacrifices and burnt-offerings were not commanded, but permitted, and therefore there was nothing in them well-pleasing in the heavens. For this reason meat-offerings-which were breads-were also employed, and likewise drink-offerings of wine, in which there was something well-pleasing; for "bread" signifies all celestial good, and "wine" all its truth. It was also from this that the sacrifices and burnt-offerings were called "bread," and also the meat-offerings or gifts, for in the original tongue "meat-offerings" are "gifts." [3] But see what has already been shown on these subjects; namely: that sacrifices and burnt-offerings were first instituted by Eber, and thence spread to the descendants of Jacob (n. 1128, 1343, 2818, 4574, 5702); that sacrifices and burnt-offerings were not commanded, but permitted (n. 2180); that sacrifices and burnt-offerings were called "bread" (n. 2165); that "bread" denotes celestial good, and "wine" the truth of this (n. 276, 680, 2165, 2177, 3735, 4217, 4735, 4976, 5915, 6118, 6377, 8410, 9323, 9545). In like manner the meat-offering and the drink-offering (n. 4581). From this it is evident that for this reason also burnt-offerings and sacrifices were abrogated by the Lord, and bread and wine were retained. But be it known that the flesh of the sacrifice and of the burnt-offering specifically signified spiritual good, whereas the bread of the meat-offering signified celestial good, and that for this reason not only flesh but also bread was offered. </p>

<p>Out of the basket of unleavened things. That this signifies which are together in the sensuous, is evident from the signification of "the basket" in which were the breads, by which are signified goods, as being the external sensuous, in which these things are together (see n. 9996); and from the signification of "unleavened things," as being things that are purified (n. 9992). </p>

<p>That is before Jehovah. That this signifies from the Divine good of the Lord, is evident from the fact that "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord, who is called "Jehovah" from Divine good, and "God" from Divine truth. That all those things which are here said of the second ram, and are called "fillings of the hand," signify the Divine of the Lord in the heavens proceeding from the Divine good of His Divine love, is plain from what has been shown above. (That "Jehovah" in the Word denotes the Lord, see the places cited in n. 9373; and that the Lord is called "Jehovah" where the Divine good is treated of, and "God" where the Divine truth is treated of, see n. 2769, 2807, 2822, 4402, 6303, 9167.) </p>

<p>And thou shalt put all upon the palms of Aaron, and upon the palms of his sons. That this signifies the acknowledgment in the heavens that these things are of the Lord and from the Lord, is evident from the signification of "all" that was from the ram, as the fat, the kidneys, and the right hind quarter, and of "all" that was in the basket, as the bread, the cake, and the wafer, as being the Divine goods and Divine truths which are of the Lord because from the Lord (on which see n. 10070-10080); and from the signification of "the palms," as being those things which are from one's own power, thus one's own (of which below); and from the representation of Aaron and his sons, as being the Lord as to Divine good and the Divine truth thence proceeding (n. 9806, 9807, 10017). That "the palms" denote those things which are from one's own power, and hence that to be "put upon the palms" denotes the acknowledgment that all these things are of the Lord and from the Lord, is because the palms belong to the hands, and by the "hands" is signified power, and "to put upon them" denotes to ascribe, thus to acknowledge; for it is said that they were to be "waved upon them," by which is signified life thence from the Divine, and life from the Divine is given through faith, the first of which is acknowledgment. As by the "hands" is signified power, it follows that by the "palms of the hands" is signified full power, because the palms grasp fully; hence when the palms are predicated of the Lord, and of the Divine truth proceeding from His Divine good, as here, omnipotence is signified. From this it is plain that by "putting upon the palms of Aaron and his sons" is signified the acknowledgment of the Lord's omnipotence, thus that all things are His, because all things in the heavens are from Him. (That the "hands" denote power, see n. 4931-4937, 5327, 5328, 6947, 7188, 7189, 7518; that "hand" and "right hand," when said of the Lord, denote omnipotence, n. 3387, 4592, 4933, 7518, 7673, 8050, 8153, 8281, 9133; and that the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord's Divine good has all power, n. 6948, 8200, 9327, 9410, 9639, 10019.) </p>

<p>And shalt wave them a wave-offering before Jehovah. That this signifies the consequent Divine life, is evident from the signification of "waving a wave-offering," as being to vivify, thus life; and because it is said "before Jehovah," Divine life is signified. That "to wave a wave-offering" denotes to vivify, that is, to give Divine life, is evident from the passages in the Word where "waving a wave-offering" is mentioned, as in Moses:      When ye shall bring the sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest, he shall wave the sheaf before Jehovah to make you well pleasing; on the morrow of the Sabbath the priest shall wave it (Lev. 23:10, 11). by the "harvest" is signified the state of the truth of faith from good, thus the state of good (see n. 9295); by "the sheaf of the firstfruits" is signified its state collectively; hence by "being waved by the priest" is signified being vivified to receive a blessing; for every blessing, in order to be a blessing, must have life in it from the Divine. [2] Again:      Aaron shall wave the Levites a wave-offering before Jehovah from among the sons of Israel, that they may be for ministering the ministry to Jehovah. Thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and shalt wave them a wave-offering to Jehovah. Afterward shall the Levites come to minister in the Tent of meeting; and thou shalt purify them, and shalt wave them a wave-offering. And when the Levites were purified, and Aaron waved them a wave-offering before Jehovah; and expiated them to purify them (Num. 8:11, 13, 15, 21). From all this it can be seen what is meant by "waving a wave offering," namely, that it denotes to vivify by acknowledgment, which is the first of life from the Divine with man. Knowledge does indeed precede acknowledgment, but there is nothing of Divine life in knowledge until it becomes acknowledgment, and then faith. The Levites represented truths ministering to good, and Aaron represented the good to which they ministered; therefore the Levites were "waved," that is, were vivified; and therefore it is also said that they were to be "purified," for life from the Divine must be in truths in order that they may minister to good, and this life first flows in by means of acknowledgment. [3] The like is signified by the "waving of gold" in Moses:      The men came with the women, and brought a clasp, a nose-ring, gold, a girdle, all vessels of gold, every man who waved a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah (Exod. 35:22); "to wave a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah" denotes to vivify by the acknowledgment that it was Jehovah's, that is, the Lord's. That "to wave a wave-offering" has such a signification is from correspondence, for all motion corresponds to a state of thought; hence progressions, journeyings, and the like, which belong to motion, in the Word signify states of life (n. 3335, 4882, 5493, 5605, 8103, 8417, 8420, 8557). [4] In John:      At the pool of Bethesda lay a great multitude of them that were sick. And at a certain time an angel went down unto the pool, and troubled the water; whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole, with whatever disease he was holden (John 5:2-7). By "troubling the water" was here likewise signified vivification through acknowledgment and faith, thus also purification through truths. (That motion signifies states of life, see n. 2837, 3356, 3387, 4321, 4882, 5605, 7381, 9440, 9967; and that "waters" denote the truths of faith, n. 2702, 3058, 3424, 4976, 8568, 9323; that all purifications are effected through the truths of faith, n. 2799, 5954, 7044, 7918, 9088; and that healings represented restorations of spiritual life, n. 8365, 9031.) [5] As by the "waving upon the palms of Aaron" is signified vivification through the acknowledgment of the Lord, and that all things are from Him, therefore a few words shall be said about this acknowledgment and the faith thence derived. It was often said by the Lord, when the sick were healed, that they should "have faith," and that it would be done to them "according to their faith" (as Matt. 8:10-13; 9:2, 22, 27-29; 13:57, 58; 15:28; 21:21, 22, 31, 32; Mark 5:34, 36; 10:49, 52; Luke 7:9, 48-50; 8:48; 17:19; 18:42, 43). The reason was that the first of all is to acknowledge that the Lord is the Savior of the world, for without this acknowledgment no one can receive anything of truth and good from heaven, thus no faith; and because this is the first and most essential of all, therefore in order that the Lord might be acknowledged when He came into the world, in healing the sick He questioned them concerning their faith, and those who had faith were healed. The faith was that He was the Son of God who was to come into the world, and that He had power to heal and to save. Moreover, all the healings of diseases by the Lord, when He was in the world, signified healings of the spiritual life, thus the things that belong to salvation (n. 8364, 9031, 9086). [6] Because the acknowledgment of the Lord is the first of all things of spiritual life, and the most essential thing of the church, and because without it no one can receive from heaven anything of the truth of faith and the good of love, therefore the Lord often says that he who "believeth in Him hath eternal life," that he who "doth not believe hath not life" (as John 1:1, 4, 12, 13; 3:14-16, 36; 5:39, 40; 6:28-30, 34, 35, 40, 47, 48; 7:37, 38; 8:24; 11:25, 26; 20:30 ,31); but he also teaches at the same time that those have faith in Him who "live according to His precepts," so that the consequent life may enter into the faith. All this has been said to illustrate and confirm the fact, that the acknowledgment of the Lord, and that from Him is all salvation, is the first of life from the Divine with man. This first of life is signified by the "wavings upon the palms of Aaron." </p>

<p>And thou shalt take them from their hand, and shalt burn them on the altar upon the burnt-offering. That this signifies unition with the Divine good of the Divine love, is evident from the signification of "taking from their hand," as being the state after acknowledgment; for when by the "waving on the palms of Aaron and his sons" is signified the acknowledgment whereby there is Divine life, by "taking those things from their hand" is signified the state after acknowledgment, which is a state of conjunction with good, and which is signified by "burning on the altar upon the burnt-offering." For by "burning on the altar" is signified to be conjoined with good (see n. 10052); and by the "burn-offering" is signified and described the conjunction itself. </p>

<p>And thou shalt take the breast. That this signifies the Divine spiritual in the heavens, and its appropriation there, is evident from the signification of "the breast," as being the good of charity, and in the supreme sense the Divine spiritual (of which in what follows); that the appropriation of it in the heavens is meant, is because in what now follows the subject treated of is the flesh of the ram and the bread from the basket, which were not burned on the altar, but were granted to Moses, to Aaron, and to his sons, for a portion, and were "eaten," whereby is signified appropriation, the process of which is now to be described. That by "the breast" is signified the good of charity, and in the supreme sense the Divine spiritual, is from correspondence; for the head with man corresponds to the good of love to the Lord, which is the good of the inmost heaven, and is called the Divine celestial; but the breast corresponds to the good of charity, which is the good of the middle or second heaven, and is called the Divine spiritual; and the feet correspond to the good of faith, thus to the good of obedience, which is the good of the ultimate heaven, and is called the Divine natural (concerning which correspondence see what has been shown above, n. 10030). [2] As the "breast" from correspondence denotes the good of charity, and the good of charity is to do what is good from willing it, therefore John, who represented this good, lay on the breast or in the bosom of the Lord (John 13:23, 25); by which is signified that this good was loved by the Lord; for "to lie on the breast and in the bosom" denotes to love. He who knows this is also able to know what is signified by these words of the Lord to Peter and to John:      Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My lambs. He saith to him again, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? He saith, Yea, Lord, Thou knowest that I love Thee. He saith unto him, Feed My sheep. He said to him the third time, Simon, Son of Jonas, lovest thou Me? Peter was grieved, therefore he said, Lord Thou knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love Thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed My sheep. Verily I say unto thee, When thou wast younger, thou girdedst thyself and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hand, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not. When He had said this, He said to him, Follow Me. Peter turning about saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also lay on His breast at supper. Peter seeing him saith, Lord, what about this man? Jesus said to him, If I will that he abide till I come, what is that to thee? Follow thou Me (John 21:15-21);  no one can know what these words signify except by the internal sense, which teaches that the twelve disciples of the Lord represented all things of faith and of love in the complex, as did the twelve tribes of Israel; and that Peter represented faith, James charity, and John the works or goods of charity. (That the twelve disciples of the Lord represented all things of faith and love in the complex, see n. 3488, 3858, 6397; and likewise the twelve tribes of Israel, n. 3858, 3926, 4060, 6335, 6640. That Peter represented faith, James charity, and John the works of charity, see the preface to the eighteenth and twenty-second chapters of Genesis, n. 3750, 4738, 6344; and that the "Rock," as Peter is also called, denotes the Lord as to faith, n. 8581.) [3] As faith without charity does not love the Lord, and yet can teach such things as belong to faith and love, and to the Lord, therefore the Lord said three times, "Lovest thou Me," "Feed My lambs," and "Feed My sheep," and for this reason the Lord says, "When thou wast younger, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest; but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee and lead thee whither thou wouldest not," by which is signified that the faith of the church in its rising is in the good of innocence like an infant; but that when it is in its setting, which is in the end of the church, faith would be no longer in this good, nor in the good of charity; and that then evil and falsity would lead, which are signified by "when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wouldest not;" thus from being free it would become enslaved. "To gird" denotes to know and perceive truths in light from good, n. 9952; "to walk" denotes to live according to these truths, n. 8417, 8420; hence "to gird himself and walk whither he would," denotes to act from freedom, and to act from freedom is to act from the affection of truth from good, n. 2870-2893, 9585-9591; and is to be led by the Lord, n. 9096, 9586, 9589-9591; but "to be girded by another, and to be led whither he would not," denotes to be a slave, and to be a slave is to act from evil, thus to be led by hell, n. 9096, 9586, 9589-9591. That "lambs," of which the Lord first speaks, denote those who are in the good of innocence, see n. 3994; and that "sheep," of which the Lord speaks in the second and third place, denote those who are in the good of charity and from this in faith, n. 4169, 4809; and that "three" denotes a whole period from beginning to end, n. 2788, 4495, 7715, 9198. Therefore, as the Lord spoke to Peter concerning the church from its rising to its setting, He said three times, "Lovest thou Me?" [4] But by "John following the Lord" was signified that they who are in the goods of charity follow the Lord and are loved by the Lord, neither do they draw back; while they who are in faith separate not only do not follow the Lord, but are also indignant about it, like Peter at that time-not to mention more arcana which are contained in the above words. From all this it is also plain that to "lie on the breast and in the bosom of the Lord" denotes to be loved by Him, and that this is said of those who are in the goods of charity, like what is said of His "carrying them in His bosom" (Isa. 40:10, 11), and of "lying in the bosom" (2 Sam. 12:3). </p>

<p>From the ram of fillings, which is for Aaron. That this signifies a representative of the Divine power of the Lord in the heavens through the Divine truth from His Divine good, and its capability of communication and reception in the heavens, may be seen above (n. 10076). </p>

<p>And shalt wave it a wave-offering before Jehovah. That this signifies vivification, is evident from the signification of "waving a wave-offering before Jehovah," as being vivification through the acknowledgment of the Lord, and that He has all power in the heavens and on earth (see above, n. 10083). It is known that the first of the church is to acknowledge the Lord; for the doctrine of the church teaches that without the Lord there is no salvation. That He has all power, the Word teaches in many passages, and the Lord Himself in these which follow:      All things have been delivered unto Me by the Father (Matt. 11:27; Luke 10:22).      The Father hath given all things into the hand of the Son (John 3:34, 35). The Father hath given to the Son power over all flesh (John 17:2).      Without Me ye cannot do anything (John 15:5).      All power hath been given unto Me in heaven and on earth (Matt. 28:18).      Jesus said to Peter, Thou art a rock, and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in the heavens, and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in the heavens (Matt. 16:18, 19); (that by "Peter" in this passage is meant faith from the Lord, thus the Lord as to faith, which has this power, see the preface to Genesis 22, n. 4738, 6344; and that a "rock," as he is there called, denotes the Lord in respect to faith, n. 8581). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10090.">10090.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And it shall be to thee for a portion. That this signifies communication with those who are in truths Divine, is evident from the representation of Moses, who was to have the breast for a portion, as being the Lord as to Divine truth, thus the Divine truth which is from the Lord (see n. 6752, 7010, 7014, 9372); and from the signification of being "for a portion," as being communication; for that which was given from the sacrifices to Moses, to Aaron, his sons, and the people, signified the communication of the holy Divine with them; and all communication is effected according to the quality of him who receives, thus according to the quality of the representation with those who received.  [2] The breast was given to Moses for a portion, and the hind quarter to Aaron (of which below), because the subject here treated of is the communication and appropriation of Divine truth and Divine good from the Lord in heaven and in the church; and there are two things which are received there, namely, Divine truth and Divine good, both from the Lord; Divine truth by those who are in the Lord's spiritual kingdom, and Divine good by those who are in the celestial kingdom (see the places cited in n. 9277, 9684). Therefore the breast was given to Moses for a portion, and the hind quarter to Aaron, for by the "breast" is signified Divine truth in the Lord's spiritual kingdom (n. 10087), and by the "hind quarter," Divine good in the celestial kingdom (n. 10075); as also by the "breads in the basket," which likewise were given to Aaron (see n. 10077). 10077). [3] That Moses represented the Lord as to Divine truth, has been shown above; and that Aaron when inaugurated into the priesthood represented the Lord as to Divine good (n. 9806). That the breast was granted to Moses for a portion is evident in Leviticus, where also the inauguration of Aaron and his sons into the priesthood is treated of:      Moses took the breast, and waved it a wave-offering before Jehovah, of the ram of fillings, and it was to Moses for a portion, as Jehovah commanded Moses (Lev. 8:29). </p>

<p>And thou shalt sanctify the breast of the waving. That this signifies the Divine spiritual acknowledged in heaven and in the church, is evident from the signification of "sanctifying," as being to represent the Lord and the holy things which are from Him (see n. 9956, 9988); from the signification of "the breast," as being the Divine spiritual in heaven (n. 10087); and from the signification of "the waving," as being vivification through acknowledgment (see n. 10083, 10089). The Divine spiritual is Divine truth in the middle or second heaven, which heaven is also called the spiritual kingdom. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10092.">10092.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And the hind quarter of the uplifting. That this signifies the Divine celestial that belongs to the Lord alone, perceived in heaven and the church, is evident from the signification of "the hind quarter," as being the Divine celestial in heaven and in the church (see n. 10075); and from the signification of "the uplifting," as being that which is given and received (of which in what follows). The Divine celestial is the Divine good from the Lord received in the inmost heaven, which heaven is also called the celestial kingdom; hence the Divine good received in the inmost heaven is called celestial good. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10093.">10093.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Which is waved, and which is uplifted. That this signifies which is acknowledged and perceived, is evident from the signification of being "waved," when said of the breast, as being that which is vivified by acknowledgment (see above, n. 10091); and from the signification of "uplifted," as being the Divine celestial, which is of the Lord alone, perceived in heaven and in the church (of which below). How the case herein is shall be briefly told. There are two kingdoms from which are the heavens, the celestial and the spiritual. Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom is acknowledged, but in the celestial kingdom it is perceived. The reason of this is that Divine truth in the spiritual kingdom is received in the intellectual part, but in the celestial kingdom in the will part. That which is received in the intellectual part is said to be acknowledged, but that which is received in the will part is said to be perceived. (That the former have only an acknowledgment of Divine truth, but the latter a perception of it, see what has been abundantly shown above concerning these two kingdoms in the places cited in n. 9277, 9596, 9684.) [2] As regards uplifting, that is called an "uplifting"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">10093-1</FONT></A> which was Jehovah's or the Lord's, and it was given to Aaron for the sake of the representation; and as Aaron represented the Lord as to Divine good (n. 9806), therefore that which was uplifted from the sacrifices and given to Aaron represented the Divine of the Lord, and is also called "the anointing" in Moses.      The breast of the waving and the hind quarter of the uplifting have I taken from among the sons of Israel of the sacrifices of the eucharistic things, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons for a statute of eternity from among the sons of Israel; this is the anointing of Aaron and the anointing of his sons from the fire-offerings of Jehovah, on the day in which I made them draw near to minister in the priest's office to Jehovah (Lev. 7:34, 35). It is called "the anointing" because "anointing" denotes inauguration to represent the Lord as to Divine good (see n. 9954, 10019). Elsewhere also in the same:      Jehovah spoke unto Aaron, Behold, I have given thee the charge of Mine upliftings, in respect to all the holy things of the sons of Israel, unto thee I have given them for an anointing, and to thy sons. To thee have I given the uplifting in respect to all the waving of the sons of Israel, all the fat of the pure oil, and all the fat of the new wine and of the grain of the firstfruits; and in respect to all the firstfruits which they shall give to Jehovah, they shall be thine; in respect to everything devoted, everything that openeth the womb of all flesh which they shall bring to Jehovah of the firstlings of an ox, of a sheep, and of a goat, the flesh shall be thine, as the breast of waving and as the right hind quarter; every uplifting of the holy things. Thou shalt not have part nor inheritance in the land, because Jehovah is thy part and inheritance; and also every uplifting from the tithes and from the gifts, which have been given to the Levites (Num. 18:8, 11-20, 28, 29). From all this it is evident what the "upliftings" were, namely, that all things were so called which belong to Jehovah, that is, to the Lord. [3] And as the Levites represented Divine truths in heaven and the church that are of service to Divine good, they were also given to Aaron in the place of all the firstborn, which were Jehovah's, that is, the Lord's, concerning which it is thus written in Moses:      I have taken the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, in the place of every firstborn that openeth the womb from the sons of Israel, that the Levites may be Mine, for every firstborn is Mine; and because the Levites were given to Me, I have given them as gifts to Aaron and his sons (Num. 3:12, 13; 8:16-19); the upliftings are called "gifts given to Jehovah," that is, to the Lord, from among the sons of Israel; but it is meant that they do not belong to Jehovah from any gift, but from possession, because everything holy or Divine with man is not man's, but is the Lord's with him. That everything good and true, thus every holy Divine thing, is from the Lord God, and nothing from man, has been known in the church, whence it is plain that it is from appearance that it is called a gift from man. And therefore also in what presently follows it is said, "for this is an uplifting, and it shall be an uplifting from among the sons of Israel, this is an uplifting of Jehovah;" by which is signified that the uplifting from the sons of Israel is Jehovah's uplifting, thus that a gift from them is a gift from the Lord. From this it is evident what an "uplifting" is. </p>

<p>From the ram of fillings, of that which is for Aaron, and of that which is for his sons. That this signifies a representative of the Divine power of the Lord in the heavens through Divine truth from Divine good, is evident from what was shown above (n. 10076). </p>

<p>And it shall be to Aaron and his sons for a statute of an age from among the sons of Israel. That this signifies a law of order in the representative church in respect to the Divine good of the Lord and the Divine truth thence proceeding, is evident from the representation of Aaron and his sons, as being the Lord as to Divine good and the Divine truth thence proceeding (see n. 9806, 9807, 10068); from the signification of "a statute of an age," as being a law of Divine order (see n. 7884, 7995, 8357); and from the representation of the sons of Israel, as being the church (n. 4286, 6426, 6637, 9340). That it denotes the representative church is because this church had been instituted with the sons of Israel (see the places cited in n. 9320). </p>

<p>And it shall be an uplifting from among the sons of Israel of their peace sacrifices, this is an uplifting to Jehovah. That this signifies reception in the heavens and in the church, and acknowledgment that it is of the Lord alone, is evident also from what was shown above (n. 10093). It is said "from the peace sacrifices," because by these is signified worship which is from freedom; for the peace or eucharistic sacrifices were voluntary sacrifices, and those things which are voluntary are from man's freedom. That is called free which is done from love, thus which is from the will, for that which a man loves, he wills. The Lord flows in with man into his love, thus into his will, and causes that what a man receives he receives in freedom; and that which is received in freedom, also becomes free, and is loved by him, consequently it becomes of his life. Hence it is plain what is meant by worship from freedom, which is signified by the peace or voluntary sacrifices; thus also what is meant by the "uplifting" from them, namely, that which is of the Lord alone. (That the sacrifices signify all worship in general, see n. 6905, 8936, 10042; and that the freedom of man is that which is of his love, n. 2870-2893, 3158, 4031, 7439, 9096, 9585-9591.) </p>

<p>And the garments of holiness which are for Aaron. That this signifies the Divine spiritual which proceeds immediately from the Divine celestial, is evident from the signification of "the garments of Aaron," as being a representative of the spiritual kingdom of the Lord adjoined to His celestial kingdom (see n. 9814); thus also the Divine spiritual, for the spiritual kingdom of the Lord comes forth from His Divine there, which is called the Divine spiritual. Nor is the universal heaven anything else than the Divine of the Lord; for the angels who are there know, acknowledge, believe, and perceive, that all the good of faith and the good of love which make heaven, are from the Lord, and nothing from themselves. These garments are called "garments of holiness," because they represented holy Divine things which are from the Lord. (That the Lord alone is holy, and that every holy thing is from Him, and that all sanctification represented Him, see n. 9229, 9680, 9818, 9820, 9956, 9988; and that from this, heaven is called the "sanctuary," n. 9479.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="10099.">10099.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Shall be for his sons after him. That this signifies in the natural successively, is evident from the signification of the "sons of Aaron," as being the things that proceed from Divine good as from a father (see n. 9807, 10068); and from the signification of "after him," as being successively, or in successive order; and as this is said of the garments of Aaron, by which was represented the Divine spiritual (n. 10098), therefore by being "for his sons after him" is signified the Divine spiritual in the natural successively. For there are three things which succeed one another in heaven, and which, in order that they may be conceived distinctly, are to be called by their names, which are "celestial," "spiritual," and "natural." These three proceed there in order, one from another, and by the influx of one into the next successively they are connected together, and thereby make a one. The Divine of the Lord in the heavens, from the difference of its reception, is called by these names.  [2] As the subject here treated of is the second ram, which is called "the ram of fillings," and by the "filling of the hand" is signified inauguration to represent the Divine of the Lord in the heavens, and its capability of communication and reception there (see n. 10019); therefore in order that its reception in the natural may likewise be described, the successive putting on of the garments of Aaron by his sons after him is here treated of, whereby is meant what is successive of that thing in the heavens which is signified by "the filling of the hand." Hence it is plain that in the internal sense these things cohere in an unbroken succession, although in the sense of the letter the series of the things concerning the ram here appears to be broken asunder. As the successives in heaven are here treated of, it shall be told what is meant by "successive." Most of the learned at this day have no other idea of successives, than as of what is continuous, or as of that which coheres by continuity. As they have this idea of the succession of things, they cannot conceive the nature of the distinction between the exteriors and interiors of man, nor consequently between the body and the spirit of man; and therefore when they think about them from these ideas, they cannot possibly understand that after the dispersion or death of the body, the spirit also is able to live under a human form.  [3] But successives are not connected continuously, but discretely, that is, distinctly according to degrees; for interior things are wholly distinct from exterior, insomuch that exterior things can be separated, and yet the interior things still continue in their life. This is the reason why man can be withdrawn from the body and think in his spirit; or according to the form of speaking used by the ancients, can be withdrawn from sensuous, and raised toward interior things. The ancients also knew that when man is withdrawn from the sensuous things that belong to the body, he is withdrawn or raised into the light of his spirit, thus into the light of heaven. Hence also the learned ancients knew that when the body was dispersed, they would live an interior life which they called their spirit; and as they regarded that life as the very human life itself, they also knew from this that they should live under the human form. Such was the idea which they had of the soul of man; and as that life was akin to life Divine, they hence perceived that their soul was immortal; for they knew that that part of man which was akin to life Divine, and thus conjoined with it, could not possibly die. [4] But after those ancient times this idea of the soul and of the spirit of man disappeared, by reason, as said above, of the want of a just idea of successives. Hence also it is, that they who think from modern learning do not know that there is what is spiritual, and that this is distinct from what is natural. For they who have an idea of successives as of what is continuous, cannot conceive of the spiritual otherwise than as of a purer natural, when yet they are as distinct from each other as are the prior and the posterior, thus as that which begets and that which is begotten. From this it is that the distinction between the internal or spiritual man, and the external or natural, thus between man's internal thought and will, and his external thought and will, is not apprehended by such learned men. Hence neither can they comprehend anything of faith and love, of heaven and hell, and of the life of man after death.  [5] But they who have a just and distinct idea of successives are able in some degree to comprehend that with a man who is being regenerated the interiors are successively opened, and that as they are opened they are also raised into interior light and life, and nearer to the Divine; and that this opening and consequent elevation is effected by means of truths Divine, which are vessels recipient of the good of love from the Divine. The good of love is that which immediately conjoins man with the Divine, for love is spiritual conjunction. Hence it follows that man can thus be more and more interiorly opened and raised in proportion as he is in the good of love from the Divine; and that conversely there is no opening and consequent elevation with the man who does not receive truths Divine; as is the case if a man is in evil. But of this  successive order and its arcana, of the Lord's Divine mercy more fully elsewhere. </p>

<p>To be anointed in them. That this signifies to represent the Lord as to Divine good, is evident from the signification of "anointing," as being inauguration to represent the Lord as to Divine good (see n. 9954, 10019); here by those who receive the Divine of the Lord in the natural; for by the garments of Aaron being for his sons after him is signified the Divine spiritual of the Lord in the natural (n. 10098, 10099). </p>
