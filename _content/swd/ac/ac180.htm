<p>There are some also on that earth who call their light at night, which is great, the Lord; but these are separated from the rest, and are not tolerated among them. This nocturnal light is shed from the great belt which encompasses that earth at a distance, and from the moons which are called the satellites of Saturn. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8952.">8952.</A></FONT></span>
<p>They were asked about that great belt, which appears from our earth to be elevated above the horizon of that planet, and to vary its positions. They said that it does not appear to them as a belt, but only as a snowy light in the heavens in various directions. </p>

<p>The inhabitants and spirits of that earth bear relation to that in man which is in the middle between spiritual sense and natural sense; but they withdraw from the natural and draw near to the spiritual. Therefore it is that these spirits often seem to themselves to be carried away, or caught up, into heaven, and afterward to be let back, thus alternately. For whatever is of spiritual sense is in heaven; but whatever is of natural sense is beneath heaven. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8954.">8954.</A></FONT></span>
<p>There are no cities there, nor kingdoms, but they live distinguished into families, each family apart from others, thus man and wife together with their children. When the children marry, they are separated from the house of their parents, and have no more concern about it. Wherefore the spirits from that earth are seen two and two. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8955.">8955.</A></FONT></span>
<p>All on that earth, otherwise than on ours, know that they shall live after death; and therefore they make no account of their bodies, except insofar as may be necessary for the life, which they say is to remain and serve the Lord. For this reason also they do not bury the bodies of the dead, but cast them forth and cover them with branches of trees from the forest. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8956.">8956.</A></FONT></span>
<p>They have also little solicitude about food and clothing. They live on fruits and vegetables of various kinds which their earth produces. And they are but scantily clothed, for they are encompassed with a thick skin or coat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_185"></A><A HREF="#fn_185"><FONT SIZE="1">8956-1</FONT></A> which wards off the cold. </p>

<p>CHAPTER 21  THE DOCTRINE OF CHARITY They who are being regenerated undergo Temptations. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8959.">8959.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Temptations are spiritual combats in man. For they are combats between the evil that is in him from hell, and the good that is in him from the Lord. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8960.">8960.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Temptation is induced by evil spirits who dwell with man in his evils and falsities; these spirits excite his evils, and accuse him. But angels from the Lord, who dwell in his goods and truths, call forth the truths of faith which are with him, and defend him. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8961.">8961.</A></FONT></span>
<p>That which is dealt with in Temptations relates to the dominion of the evil that is with the man from hell, and of the good that is with him from the Lord. The evil that wishes to have dominion is in the natural or external man, but the good is in the spiritual or internal man; hence it is that in Temptations that which is dealt with also relates to the dominion of the one over the other; if evil conquers, the natural man has dominion over the spiritual; if good conquers, the spiritual man has dominion over the natural. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8962.">8962.</A></FONT></span>
<p>These combats are carried on by means of truths of faith which are from the Word. The man must fight against evils and falsities from these; if he fights from anything else, he does not conquer, because the Lord is not in anything else. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8963.">8963.</A></FONT></span>
<p>As the combat is carried on by means of truths of faith which are from the Word, the man is not admitted into combat until he is in the knowledges of truth and of good, and has obtained therefrom some spiritual life; and therefore these combats do not arise with man until he has come to years of maturity. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8964.">8964.</A></FONT></span>
<p>He who has not with him truths of faith from the Word by which he may fight, thus who has not any spiritual life in himself from these, is not admitted into any combat, because he yields; and if a man yields, his state after Temptation becomes worse than his state before Temptation, for evil has then acquired to itself power over good, and falsity over truth. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8965.">8965.</A></FONT></span>
<p>As at this day faith is rare, for the church is at its end, therefore at this day few undergo any spiritual Temptations. Hence it is that it is scarcely known what they are, and to what they conduce. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8966.">8966.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Temptations conduce to the confirmation of the truths of faith, also to the implantation of them, and the insinuation of them into the will, that they may become goods of charity. For, as before said, man fights from the truths of faith against evils and falsities; and because his mind is then in truths, when he conquers he confirms himself in them and implants them; and also accounts as an enemy, and rejects from himself, the evils and falsities which have assailed him. Moreover through Temptations the concupiscences which are of the loves of self and of the world are subdued, and the man becomes humble. Thus he is rendered fit to receive the life of heaven from the Lord, which life is the new life, such as belongs to the regenerated man. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8967.">8967.</A></FONT></span>
<p>As through temptations the truths of faith are confirmed, and the goods of charity implanted, and also the concupiscences of evil are subdued, it follows that through Temptations the spiritual or internal man acquires dominion over the natural or external man, thus the good which is of charity and faith over the evil which is of the love of self and of the world. When this is effected, the man has enlightenment, and perception of what is true and what is good, and also of what is evil and false; and consequently he has intelligence and wisdom, which afterward increase day by day. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8968.">8968.</A></FONT></span>
<p>When a man is being introduced through the truths of faith to the good of charity, he undergoes Temptations; but when he is in the good of charity, Temptations cease, for he is then in heaven. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8969.">8969.</A></FONT></span>
<p>In Temptations man ought to fight against evils and falsities as from himself, but still believe that he does so from the Lord. If during the Temptation itself he does not believe this, because he is then in obscurity, still he should believe it after the Temptation. If after Temptation the man does not believe that the Lord alone has fought for him and conquered for him, he has undergone only external Temptation, which Temptation does not penetrate deeply, nor cause anything of faith and of charity to take root.            EXODUS 21      1. And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them.      2. When thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing.      3. If in his body he shall come in, in his body he shall go out; if he is master of a woman, then his woman shall go out with him.      4. If his master shall give him a woman, and she bear him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall be his master's, and he shall go out in his body.      5. And if saying the servant shall say, I love my master, my woman, and my children; I will not go out free:      6. Then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore through his ear with his awl; and he shall serve him forever.      7. And when a man shall sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out according to the going out of the menservants.      8. If she be evil in the eyes of her master, so that he will not betroth her, then she shall be redeemed: to sell her unto a strange people he shall have no power, in his acting treacherously against her.      9. And if he shall betroth her to his son, he shall do to her according to the judgment of daughters.      10. If he shall take him another; her food, her covering, and her conjugial due, he shall not diminish.      11. And if he shall not do these three to her, then she shall go out free with no silver.      12. He that smiteth a man, and he die, dying he shall die.      13. And he that hath not lain in wait, and God caused it to happen to his hand; then I will appoint thee a place whither he shall flee.      14. And when a man shall act of set purpose against his companion, to kill him with deceit; thou shalt take him from Mine altar that he may die.      15. And he that smiteth his father and his mother, dying he shall die.      16. And he that stealeth a man, and selleth him, and if he shall be found in his hand, dying he shall die.      17. And he that curseth his father and his mother, dying he shall die.      18. And when men shall dispute, and a man shall smite his companion with a stone, or with his fist, and he dieth not, and lieth down in bed:      19. If he rise and walk abroad upon his staff, the smiter shall be guiltless; only he shall give his cessation, and healing shall heal him.      20. And when a man shall smite his manservant, or his maidservant, with a rod, and he die under his hand; in being avenged he shall be avenged.      21. Nevertheless if he shall stand for a day or two, he shall not be avenged, because he is his silver.      22. And when men shall quarrel, and shall strike a pregnant woman, and her births go forth, and harm is not done, with fining he shall be fined, as the woman's master shall lay upon him; and he shall give according to the judges.      23. And if harm is done, then thou shalt give soul for soul,      24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,       25. Burning for burning, wound for wound, blow for blow.      26. And when a man shall smite the eye of his manservant, or the eye of his maidservant, and shall destroy it; he shall let him go free for his eye.      27. And if he shall knock out his manservant's tooth, or his maidservant's tooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth.      28. And when an ox shall strike with the horn a man or a woman, and he dieth, with stoning the ox shall be stoned, and his flesh shall not be eaten; and the master of the ox shall be guiltless.      29. But if the ox were wont to strike with his horn from yesterday the day before yesterday, and it hath been attested to his master, and he hath not watched him, and he hath killed a man or a woman; the ox shall be stoned, and his master also shall die.      30. If expiation be laid on him, then he shall give the redemption of his soul according to all that is laid upon him.      31. Whether he have struck with the horn a son, or struck with the horn a daughter, according to this judgment shall it be done to him.      32. If the ox shall strike with the horn a manservant, or a maidservant; he shall give unto their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.      33. And when a man shall open a pit, or when a man shall dig a pit and not cover it, and an ox or an ass shall fall in there:      34. The master of the pit shall repay; he shall pay silver to its master, and the dead one shall be his.      35. And when a man's ox shall strike the ox of his companion, and he die; then they shall sell the living ox, and shall divide the silver of it; and the dead one also they shall divide.      36. Or if it be known that the ox was wont to strike with the horn from yesterday the day before yesterday, and his master hath not watched him; repaying he shall repay ox for ox, and the dead one shall be his.      37.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_186"></A><A HREF="#fn_186"><FONT SIZE="1">8969-1</FONT></A> When a man shall steal an ox, or one of the flock, and shall kill it, or sell it, he shall repay five oxen for an ox, and four of the small cattle for one of the small cattle.  </p>

<p>THE CONTENTS.       In this chapter in the internal sense the subject treated of is those who injure or destroy, in themselves or in others, the truth of faith or the good of charity; what is the penalty; and what the restoration. Such things are here involved in the judgments or laws relating to servants, to the death or injury occasioned to companions or to servants, also relating to oxen that strike with the horn, and to a pit. </p>

<p>THE INTERNAL SENSE That the Word is holy, nay, most holy, is known to everyone within the church. This is not only acknowledged, but is also perceived, by those who are in the truths of faith and in a life according to them, for when reading the Word they are continually kept in the idea of what is holy. But those who are not in the truths of faith and in a life according to them do not acknowledge, still less perceive, anything of holiness in the Word. When these persons read the Word, they do not see anything higher in it than in any other writing. And they who in their hearts deny the holiness of the Word also say to themselves when they read it, that the writings of men are finer, because insofar as regards the literal sense they are composed in a finer style. This has been shown me by living experience with regard to those in the other life who in their hearts have denied that the Word has been inspired by the Divine. But when they were told that the Word is holy and Divine as to every jot and smallest point in it, they stood amazed, and marveled whence this could be. And when they were told further, and also shown to the life, that all things which are in the Word contain in them a spiritual sense which does not appear in the letter, and that this sense of the Word is with the angels in heaven when the Word is being read by man, they then acknowledged it because it was shown; but they said that they did not know this in the world, and that because they did not know it, they are free from blame. But when these same persons were examined, it was observed that they had lived just as they liked, without any restraints from conscience, and had therefore at heart denied the Divine, heaven and hell, the life after death, and all other matters of faith, and that this was the cause of their not having acknowledged the holiness of the Word. And it was further shown that all those who have been in the truths of faith and in a life according to them, have held the Word to be holy, and have also while reading it perceived in themselves that it is so. From this they were convinced that the cause was not in the Word, but in themselves. For with those who are in a life of good the interiors are open into heaven, whence the holiness of the Word flows in from the angels; whereas with those who are in a life of evil the interiors are closed toward heaven, but are open into hell, whence there flows in the contrary. [2] Take for example the judgments or laws in this chapter about menservants, maidservants, and oxen. They who deny the holiness of the Word, because they are in a life of evil, will say that in these judgments or laws they do not see anything Divine-as when it is said that a manservant who does not desire to go away free should be brought to a door or a doorpost, and his master should bore through his ear with an awl, and accordingly he should serve forever; also that if a manservant who is smitten shall live a day or two, his master who smote him shall not be punished, because he is his silver; as also that a manservant should be free for the loss of an eye or a tooth; and that an ox striking with the horn should be stoned, besides the other things there mentioned. They who in their hearts deny the holiness of the Word regard these things as not worthy of the Word, and still less worthy to be dictated by Jehovah Himself on Mount Sinai; in like manner do they regard all other things that are in the Word, whether historical or prophetical. But the reason why they so regard them is that heaven is closed to them on account of their life of evil, consequently they have a contrary perception. The case is quite different with those who are in a life of good. [3] Whence comes the holiness of the Word which flows in from heaven, is evident from all that has hitherto been said and shown about the internal sense of the Word; namely, that the Word alone has an internal sense, and that this sense treats of such things as belong to heaven, which are the things of eternal life, and that inmostly it treats of the Lord alone, thus of holy things, nay, of Divine things themselves which are most holy; and that this sense is for the angels who are with man while the Word is being read, consequently that there is from this source an influx of holiness, and a perception of it, with those who are in the life of faith and charity. As regards the judgments or laws in this chapter about menservants, maidservants, and oxen, these contain in the internal sense such things as are of Divine order with respect to those who are in the truth of faith, and also with respect to those who injure or destroy the things which belong to faith and charity, and those which belong to love to the Lord; and in the inmost sense, those things which would injure or destroy the Lord Himself. From this everyone can see how holy in themselves these judgments are, however little they appear so in the letter. </p>

<p>Verse 1. And these are the judgments which thou shalt set before them, signifies exterior truths, such as there must be in the civil state where there is a representative church, and which flow from the internal truths which are of order in the heavens. That these things are signified by "the judgments which were to be set before the sons of Israel" is evident from the signification of "judgments," as being truths (see n. 2235, 6397, 7206, 8685, 8695). The reason why "judgments" denote truths is that all judgment is effected by means of truths; consequently by "doing judgment" in the Word is signified doing truth, that is, judging according to truths. But by "judgments," in the plural, are signified civil laws, thus exterior truths such as are in the civil state. It is said "where there is a representative church," for the reason that interiorly they contain and involve in them those truths which are of order in the heavens, as can be seen from their internal sense. [2] The laws which were enacted and commanded the sons of Israel by the Lord were distinguished into "commandments," "judgments," and "statutes." Those were called "commandments" which belonged to life; those "judgments" which belonged to the civil state; and those "statutes" which belonged to worship. As regards "judgments" specifically, they are such things as are contained in this chapter, and also in several chapters that follow. They served for laws in a church wherein the internal things which are of heaven and the church were represented by external things. But they do not serve for laws in a church wherein internal things are no longer represented by external, as in the Christian Church. The reason is that to the man of this Church internal things have been revealed, and therefore communication with heaven is effected by means of internal things, and not by means of external things, as before. This is the reason why the man of the Christian Church is not bound to observe in their external form those things which are called "judgments" and "statutes," but in their internal form. Nevertheless holiness abides in them, because they contain holy things within them, as do also all and each of the things commanded in the Word about sacrifices. Although these things have been abrogated, they nevertheless are holy things of the Word by reason of the Divine things which are in them, and which they represented. For when they are read by a Christian man, the Divine things that are within them, and that were represented, are perceived in the heavens, and fill the angels with that which is holy, and at the same time by influx from the angels they fill the man who reads, especially if he himself then thinks of the Divine things that are within them. From this it is plain that the Word even of the Old Testament is most holy. [3] That the laws enacted by the Lord and commanded the sons of Israel were distinguished into "commandments" which relate to life, into "judgments" which relate to the civil state, and into "statutes" which relate to worship, is plain in the following passages:      Jehovah said unto Moses, Go, say to them, return ye into your tents. But as for thee, stand thou here with Me, and I will speak unto thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them (Deut. 5:28, 30, 31).      Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which Jehovah your God commanded to teach you (Deut. 6:1).      Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them (Deut. 7:11).      If his sons forsake My law, and walk not In My judgments; if they profane My statutes, and keep not My commandments; I will visit their transgression with the rod (Ps. 89:30-32). [4] Moreover all the laws, insofar as they belonged to the representative church, were in general called "judgments" and "statutes," as in Moses:      Now, therefore, O Israel, hear the statutes and the judgments which I will teach you, that ye may do them. What great nation is there that hath statutes and judgments so just as all this law, which I will give before you this day? (Deut. 4:1, 8; 5:1).      Jerusalem hath changed My judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and My statutes more than the lands that are round about her; for they have rejected My judgments, and have not walked in My statutes (Ezek. 5:6, 7).      Let them walk in My statutes, and keep My judgments, to do the truth (Ezek. 18:9). Besides many other places (as Lev. 18:5; 19:37; 20:22; 25:18; 26:15; Deut. 26:17; Ezek. 11:12, 20; 20:11, 13, 25; 37:24). </p>

<p>Verses 2-6. When thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve; and in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing. If in his body he shall come in, in his body he shall go out; if he is master of a woman, then his woman shall go out with him. If his master shall give him a woman, and she shall bear him sons or daughters, the woman and her children shall be his master's, and he shall go out in his body. And if saying the servant shall say, I love my master, my woman, and my children; I will not go out free; then his master shall bring him unto God, and shall bring him unto the door, or unto the door-post; and his master shall bore through his ear with his awl; and he shall serve him forever. "When thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant," signifies those within the church who are in the truths of doctrine and not in good according to them; "six years he shall serve," signifies a state of labor and of some combat and of the consequent confirmation of truth; "and in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing," signifies a state of truth confirmed without exertion on his part; "if in his body he shall come in," signifies truth without delight; "in his body he shall go out," signifies a state of truth without delight also after combat; "if he is master of a woman," signifies truth with delight adjoined; "then his woman shall go out with him," signifies a state of truth with delight conjoined also after combat; "if his master shall give him a woman," signifies good from the spiritual adjoined to truth while in combat; "and she bear him sons or daughters," signifies the truths and goods thence derived; "the woman and her children shall be his master's," signifies that good adjoined to truth by the spiritual, together with the goods and truths thence derived, shall not be appropriated to truth; "and he shall go out in his body," signifies the state after combat, which is merely one of confirmed and implanted truth; "and if saying the servant shall say," signifies thought then from the implanted truth; "I love my master, my woman, and my children," signifies the delight of the remembrance of spiritual goods; "I will not go out free," signifies the delight of obedience; "then his master shall bring him unto God," signifies a state into which he then enters according to Divine order; "and shall bring him to the door, or unto the door-post," signifies a state of communication of truth confirmed and implanted with spiritual good; "and his master shall bore through his ear with his awl," signifies a representative of obedience; "and he shall serve him forever," signifies to eternity. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8974.">8974.</A></FONT></span>
<p>When thou shalt buy a Hebrew servant. That this signifies those within the church who are in the truths of doctrine and not in good according to them, is evident from the signification of "buying," as being to procure and appropriate to oneself (see n. 4397, 5374, 5397, 5406, 5410, 5426, 7999); and from the signification of "a Hebrew servant," as being those within the church who are in the truths of doctrine and not in good of life according to them; for "servant" is predicated of those who are in truth and not in the corresponding good, and in general, of truth relatively to good (n. 3409), and "Hebrew" is predicated of those things which are of the church, and of those things which are of some service (that it is predicated of those things which are of the church, see n. 5136, 5236, 6675, 6684; also that it is predicated of those things which are of some service, n. 1703, 1741, 5013). As in what now follows, the menservants and maidservants of the sons of Israel are treated of, it must be told what the statutes concerning them involve in the internal sense. Everyone can see that the statutes contain within them secret things of heaven, because they were spoken and commanded orally by Jehovah to Moses on Mount Sinai, and because they follow immediately after the words of the Decalogue. Apart from such secret things they would be merely civil and public laws like the laws of other nations on earth, in which there is no secret thing of heaven. But the secret things here contained are not manifest except to the angels in the heavens, consequently not to men except by the internal sense; for this teaches how the angels perceive the Word, consequently it teaches the secret things that are within the Word. What and of what quality these secret things are, will be plain in the following explication of each particular. [2] That a general idea may be had, it shall be briefly told what is specifically meant by "Hebrew servants" in the internal sense. In the spiritual church, which the sons of Israel represented, there are two kinds of men: there are those who are in the truth of faith and not in the corresponding good of life, and there are those who are in the good of charity and in the corresponding truth of faith. They who are in the good of charity and in the corresponding truth of faith are they who constitute the very church itself, and are men of the internal church. In the internal sense of the Word these are they who are called the "sons of Israel." These are of themselves free, because they are in good; for they who are led by the Lord by means of good are free (n. 892, 905, 2870-2893). But they who are in the truth of faith and not in the corresponding good of life are men of the external spiritual church. These are they who in the internal sense of the Word are meant by the "Hebrew servants." They are represented by servants because those things which are of the external church are relatively nothing else than things of service. The case is similar also with the truth of faith relatively to the good of charity; for the truth of faith serves for introducing the man of the church into the good of charity. [3] Be it known moreover that he who makes everything of the church, thus everything of salvation, to consist in the truth of faith and not in the good of charity, and who also does good from obedience only and not from the affection which is of the love, cannot be regenerated, as can those who are in the good of charity, that is, who do what is good from the affection of love. They can indeed be reformed, but not regenerated. Their reformation is here treated of in the internal sense in the laws concerning menservants and concerning maidservants. The secret things of this reformation are not at this day known to anyone, for the reason that an almost total ignorance prevails within the church of what the truth of faith effects toward salvation, and what the good of charity effects. Nay, it is not known what charity is, or that charity and faith must marry together for anything of the church to exist in man; for the marriage of good and truth is the church itself, because it is heaven in man (n. 2173, 2618, 2728, 2729, 2803, 3132, 3155, 4434, 4823, 5194, 5502, 6179). </p>

<p>Six years he shall serve. That this signifies a state of labor and of some combat and of the consequent confirmation of truth, is evident from the signification of "six years," as being states of labor and combat (that "six" signifies labor and combat see n. 737, 900, 8888; and that "years" signify states, n. 487, 488, 493, 893, 7839). That the confirmation of truth is also signified, is because spiritual truth, which is called the truth of faith, is confirmed by labor and combat. It is said "somewhat of combat," because they who are in the truth of faith and not in the corresponding good of life are not admitted into any grievous combat, that is, into temptation, because they would yield. For the Lord cannot flow in with them by means of good, and thus defend them against the evils and falsities which assail in temptations. They are only external men, and whatever flows in from the Lord must flow in through the internal man into the external. When men are not in the good of charity, the internal man is not open, for good is that which opens the internal man, and which dwells there. </p>

<p>And in the seventh year he shall go out free for nothing. That this signifies a state of truth confirmed without exertion on his part, is evident from the signification of "the seventh year," as being a state of the conjunction of good and truth; for by "the seventh year" is signified the like as by "the seventh day," or "the Sabbath" (that by this is signified the conjunction of good and truth, or the heavenly marriage, thus the state of peace which succeeds after a state of servitude, see n. 8494, 8495, 8510, 8888, 8890, 8893). But here, as those who are in truth and not in the corresponding good of life are treated of, by "the seventh year" is signified a state of confirmed truth. The reason is that with such there is no conjunction of truth and good, as there is with those who are in the good of charity, and who are understood in the representative sense by the sons of Israel; but instead of this conjunction there is the confirmation of truth. And from the signification of "for nothing" [gratis], as being without exertion on their part; for when they are in labor and in some combat the truth of faith with them is confirmed by the Lord without any exertion of theirs. The like is signified by "for nothing," or "freely," in these passages:      I will give unto him that is athirst from the fountain of the water of life freely (Rev. 21:6.)      He that heareth, let him say, Come; and he that is athirst, let him come; and he that will, let him take the water of life freely (Rev. 22:17).      Everyone that thirsteth, go ye to the water, and he that hath no silver; go ye, buy and eat; go ye, I say, buy wine and milk without silver and without price (Isa. 55:1). "The waters" denote truths from the Word; "wine," the truth of good therefrom; and "milk," the good of truth. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8977.">8977.</A></FONT></span>
<p>If in his body he shall come in. That this signifies truth without delight, is evident from the signification of "body," as being truth alone, thus truth without its delight; for by "body" is meant the manservant alone without a woman, thus without delight, for the "woman" of a manservant denotes delight conjoined with truth, as will be plain from what follows. With regard to this secret the case is this. The men of the external church, who were represented by the Hebrew servants, are they who learn truth from no delight, but solely for the reason that it is the truth of the church, by means of which they believe that they can be saved. It is this necessity which enjoins them to learn and to know it. These are they who in the internal sense are meant by "menservants who come in their body and go out in their body." With these, truth is merely confirmed. In the other life such persons are in the entrance to heaven, and not in heaven itself; they are called "the cuticulars," because in the Grand Man they correspond to the skin (see n. 5553-5559). [2] But they who are in truth to which delight is adjoined are they who in the internal sense are here meant by the menservants who come with a woman, for "the woman" signifies good, when "the man" signifies truth; but here "woman" signifies delight, for in the man of the external church this takes the place of good. The good in which this man is, is not from a spiritual origin, but from a natural origin, for it has its relish from the delight of living and of teaching truth for the sake of gain or for the sake of honor, consequently for the sake of self. This is the reason why it is called "delight," but not "good." In the external form it does indeed appear as good, but because it is natural good, that is, because it has its origin from the world, and not from heaven, it is called delight. [3] But good from a spiritual origin is meant in the internal sense by the woman whom the master gives his servant; but this cannot be conjoined; and therefore it was decreed that when the manservant should go forth, the woman should be the master's, and also her sons and daughters. For spiritual good is good not for the sake of gain, or for the sake of honor; but for the sake of the church, and for the sake of the salvation of the neighbor. Such good cannot be conjoined with those who are in the externals of the church, for it is the very good of charity, and it springs from the affection which is of love. For they who are in the externals of the church cannot be affected by the truths of faith in any other way than chiefly for the sake of themselves, and secondarily for the sake of the church; and they who are of such a character can indeed act according to truths, thus can do what is good, not from affection, but from obedience. These are they who in the internal sense are meant by those who desire to serve forever. [4] These are the arcana which in the internal sense are contained in these statutes concerning menservants, and which can in no wise be apprehended except by those who are in the good of charity; but not by those who are in the truths of faith without this good. The reason is that they who are in the good of charity are in the light of heaven, and from this light they see the things which are in the light of the world; whereas they who are in the truth of faith, and not in the good of charity, are in the light of the world, from which light the things which are in heaven cannot be seen. For the light of heaven is above, that is, within; but the light of the world is beneath or without, and lower or exterior things can be seen from higher or interior ones, but not the reverse; for heaven can flow into the world, but not the world into heaven (n. 3721, 5119, 5259, 5779, 6322). </p>

<p>In his body he shall go out. That this signifies a state of truth without delight also after combat, is evident from the signification of "body," as being truth without delight (of which just above, n. 8977); and from the signification of "going out," as being after he has served six years, thus a state after combat; for by the service of six years is signified a state of labor and of combat (n. 8975). (How this is, is plain from what has just been said above, n. 8977.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8979.">8979.</A></FONT></span>
<p>If he is master&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_187"></A><A HREF="#fn_187"><FONT SIZE="1">8979-1</FONT></A> of a woman. That this signifies truth with delight conjoined, is evident from the signification of "master," as being truth (of which below) and from the signification of "a woman," as being good, but here delight (of which also below). That "a master" denotes truth, is because by "master" is here meant the manservant as the woman's man, and in the internal sense by a "manservant," as also by a woman's "man," is signified truth. (That truth is signified by "a manservant," see n. 8974; also that it is signified by "a man," n. 3134, 3309, 3459, 7716.) That "a woman" denotes delight is because by the woman of a man is signified in the internal sense good (n. 915, 2517, 4823, 6014, 8337). But as by a manservant from the Israelitish people is represented a man of the external church, who indeed has truth of doctrine, but not the corresponding good (n. 8974), because he does not do truth for the sake of truth, nor good for the sake of good, but that he may be recompensed; therefore in the truth and good which he does, there is the idea of self, and this idea does not belong to good, but to delight; for in the spiritual sense nothing is called "good" except that which belongs to love to the Lord and to love toward the neighbor. This good does indeed appear also as delight in the natural man; but it is the spiritual that is within it that makes it to be good. [2] That it may be further known how the case is in regard to this, it is to be borne in mind that the man of the internal church acts from charity, thus from the affection which is of love toward the neighbor; whereas the man of the external church does not act from the good of charity, but from the truth of faith; thus not from the affection which is of love toward the neighbor, but from obedience, because it has been so commanded. It flows from this that the man of the internal church is free, but the man of the external church is relatively a servant; for he who acts from the affection which is of love, acts from freedom (n. 2870-2893); but he who acts from obedience does not act from freedom, for to obey is not freedom. This is the reason why he who acts from the good of charity is a true man of the spiritual church, and therefore in the Word is represented by Israel, whereas he who does not act from the good of charity, but from the truth of faith, is not a true man of the spiritual church, but is relatively his servant; and he was therefore represented by the manservant who was called a "Hebrew servant," because bought from the sons of Israel. </p>


<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8980.">8980.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Then his woman shall go out with him. That this signifies a state of truth with delight also conjoined after combat, is evident from the signification of "going out," namely, from service, as being the state after combat (see n. 8975); and from the signification of "a woman," as being the conjoined delight (of which just above, n. 8979). From all this it is evident who were here represented by menservants, namely, they who are in the faith of the doctrinal things of their church, and not in the corresponding good, but in a delight which counterfeits the corresponding good. Their service with their master signifies their state before they can be admitted into heaven, and their going out from service signifies their state when they are received into heaven. But as they are merely in the faith of the doctrinal things of their church, and not in the corresponding good, thus not in the truth of good, that is, in the faith of charity, therefore they cannot be admitted further into heaven than to the entrance of it. For they who are in the entrance to heaven communicate by the truth which is of faith with those who are in heaven, and by delight conjoined with truth with those who are outside of heaven-no otherwise than as do the skins or coats which encompass the body, which by the sense of touch communicate with the world, and by a fibrous connection, with the life of the soul in the body. From this it is that they who are in the entrance to heaven, and are represented by the Hebrew servants, are called "the cuticulars" in the Grand Man (n. 5552-5559). But such are of as many genera and species as are the cuticles or coats in the body; for there are those which encompass the whole body; there are those which encompass the interiors in general, as the peritoneum, the pleura, the pericardium; and there are those which specifically encompass each of the viscera therein. All are relatively things of service. </p>

<p>If his master shall give him a woman. That this signifies good from the spiritual adjoined to truth while in combat, is evident from the signification of "master," as here being the spiritual; for by "master" is here meant someone of the sons of Israel, and by the "sons of Israel" are signified those who are true men of the spiritual church, that is, who do what is good from the affection which is of love, or what is the same, from charity. (That "the sons of Israel" denote the men of the spiritual church, see n. 6426, 6862, 6868, 7035, 7062, 7198, 7201, 7215, 7223, 7957, 8234, 8805; consequently by the same in the abstract sense are signified spiritual truths and goods, n. 5414, 5801, 5803, 5806, 5812, 5817, 5819, 5833, 5879.) From this it is that by "master" is here signified the spiritual. And from the signification of "giving him a woman," as being to adjoin good to truth; for "to give," when said of a woman, denotes to adjoin, and "a manservant" denotes one who is in the truth of doctrine and not in the corresponding good (n. 8974); and "a woman" denotes delight (n. 8980), but here good, because it is given (that is, adjoined) from the spiritual; for all that which comes from the spiritual is called "good," because the spiritual itself is the good of charity (that "a woman" denotes good, see n. 915, 2517, 4823, 6014, 8337). The reason why it denotes in combat, is that it is said that if his master have given him a woman, at the end of his service the woman should be the master's. From this it is evident that the woman was the manservant's while he was in service, and not afterward; thus while in combat, and not after combat; for by the service of six years is signified labor and combat (n. 8975). [2] Who cannot see that in this statute there is a secret which cannot be known except by him to whom it has been revealed? For in the external form it appears contrary to Divine justice that a woman given to a manservant should remain the master's when the servant went out from service, seeing that a woman ought to be her man's forever. Of the same character are also many other things that were commanded the sons of Israel by Jehovah, as that they should ask of the Egyptians vessels of gold and of silver, and garments, and thus should spoil them; besides other things of a similar nature spoken of in their places. But although, as has been said, in the outward form these things appear contrary to Divine justice, they nevertheless are not so, for they flow from the laws of Divine order in the heavens, which laws are the very laws themselves of justice; but these laws are not clear unless they are unfolded from the sense of the letter by means of the internal sense. The law from which this statute flows is that spiritual good cannot be conjoined with those who are in the externals of the church from infancy, but can only be adjoined to them so long as they are in combat, and that after combat it recedes. [3] That it may be clear how the case herein is (for it is a secret), it shall be briefly explained. They who from infancy have thought little about eternal life, thus about the salvation of their soul, but only of worldly life and its prosperity, and yet have lived a good moral life, and have also believed in the truths of the doctrine of their church, when they come to more adult age, cannot be reformed otherwise than by the adjoining of spiritual good when they are in combat; but still they do not retain this good, but only confirm the truths of their doctrine by means of it. The reason why they are of this character is that in their past life they have indulged worldly loves; and when these loves have been rooted in, they do not suffer spiritual good to be conjoined with truth, because these loves are altogether repugnant to that good. Nevertheless spiritual good can take possession of the thought when these loves become inactive, as is the case when they are in anxiety, in misfortunes, and in sicknesses, and the like. Then the affection of well-doing from charity flows in, but this affection serves only for confirming and rooting in more deeply the truths of doctrine; but it cannot be conjoined with truth. The reason is that this influent affection of charity fills only the intellectual part of the mind, but does not enter into its will part, and that which does not enter into the will part is not appropriated, thus is not conjoined, because the conjunction of good and truth with man is effected when truth enters the will; consequently when the man wills truth, and from willing does it. Then for the first time truth becomes good, or what is the same, faith becomes charity. [4] This cannot be effected with those who from infancy have indulged the loves of the world, and yet are in the truth of the doctrine of their church; for their will part is possessed by these loves, which are wholly in opposition to and reject spiritual good. They merely admit this into the intellectual part of the mind, that is, into the thought, when these loves are dormant, which is the case, as said above, in a state of sickness or of misfortune, or in anxiety, consequently in labor, and in some combat. This is the secret which lies hidden in this statute. And as this statute was thus representative of the law of Divine order with respect to those who are in the truth of doctrine and not in the corresponding good, therefore in the representative church it was in agreement with Divine justice, even in the external form. </p>

<p>And she bear him sons or daughters. That this signifies the truths and goods thence derived, is evident from the signification of "sons," as being truths (see n. 489, 491, 535, 1147, 2803, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257); and from the signification of "daughters," as being goods (n. 489-491, 2362, 3024). That derived truths and goods are signified is plain, because by the woman who is the mother of whom they are born, is signified spiritual good (n. 8981), and in the internal sense by "births" are signified derivations (n. 1330, 3263, 3279). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8983.">8983.</A></FONT></span>
<p>The woman and her children shall be his master's. That this signifies that good adjoined to truth by the spiritual, together with the truths and goods thence derived, shall not be appropriated to truth, is evident from the signification of "the woman," as being spiritual good adjoined to truth when in combat (of which above, n. 8981); from the signification of "children," as being derived truths and goods (of which just above, n. 8982); and from the signification of "shall be his master's," as being that they shall belong to the spiritual from which they are, and not to truth (for "the master" denotes the spiritual, n. 8981, and "the manservant," truth without the corresponding good, n. 8974; consequently that they shall not be appropriated to this truth). For in the internal sense by "man and woman" is signified the conjunction of truth and good, because marriage on earth represents the heavenly marriage which is that of good and truth; and moreover conjugial love corresponds to this marriage (n. 2727-2759, 2803). [2] But between a manservant and a woman given him by his master there is no marriage, but only a coupling like that of a concubine with a man, which coupling does not correspond to the heavenly marriage; and therefore it is dissolved when the manservant goes forth, for then the woman together with the children become the master's. The reason why such a coupling takes place, is that the truth which is represented by the manservant is in the external man, and the good which is represented by the woman is in the internal man; and the good of the internal man cannot be conjoined with the truth of the external unless conjunction has been previously effected in the internal man. This cannot be done, because the manservant represents the merely external man who has not the corresponding good, and to whom it cannot be appropriated. That the good of the internal man cannot be conjoined with the truth of the external unless conjunction has been first effected in the internal man, can be seen from what has been already said about the regeneration of man (n. 3321, 3469, 3493, 3573, 3616, 3882, 4353); for regeneration is the conjunction of good and truth. </p>

<p>And he shall go out in his body. That this signifies the state after combat, which is merely one of confirmed and implanted truth, is evident from the signification of "going out," namely, from service, as being the state after combat (see above, n. 8980); and from the signification of "in his body," as being with truth without good (n. 8977, 8978). The reason why it denotes a state of confirmed and implanted truth, is that this is signified by "going out in the seventh year" (n. 8976), and here that spiritual good, which is represented by the woman, had served to confirm that truth, and also to implant new truth (n. 8981). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8985.">8985.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And if saying the servant shall say. That this signifies thought then from the implanted truth, is evident from the signification of "saying," as being thought (see n. 7094, 7107, 7244); and from the signification of "manservant," as being truth without the corresponding good (n. 8974); here, this truth confirmed and implanted, because it is said of that servant when he was about to go forth (n. 8984). It is said that "manservant" denotes truth, but there is meant the man who is in truth without the corresponding good. The reason why truth is called a "manservant," and not the man who is in such truth, is that abstract speech, that is, speech separate from man, is angelic speech. For in heaven they think about a thing apart from the person, because when the person also is there thought of, the society which is in the thing in question is excited, and thus the thought is determined thither, and is fixed. For in heaven where the thought is, there the presence is; and presence would bend to itself the thoughts of those who are in the society, and would thus disturb the influx from the Divine there. It is otherwise when they think abstractedly about a thing; in this case the thought diffuses itself in every direction according to the heavenly form which the influx proceeding from the Divine produces, and this without the disturbance of any society. For it insinuates itself into the general spheres of the societies, and in this case does not touch or move anyone in the society; thus does not divert anyone from the freedom of thinking according to the influx from the Divine. In a word, abstracted thought can pervade the whole heaven without stopping anywhere; but thought determined to person, or to place, is fixed and stays. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8986.">8986.</A></FONT></span>
<p>I love my master, my woman, and my children. That this signifies the delight of the remembrance of spiritual goods, is evident from the signification of "loving," as here being the delight of remembrance (of which below); from the signification of "master," as being the spiritual good which is the source (see above, n. 8981); from the signification of "woman," as being the good that is adjoined from the spiritual (n. 8981); and from the signification of "children," as being the goods and truths thence derived (see n. 8982); consequently by "master, woman, and children," taken together, are signified spiritual goods. That the delight of the remembrance of such goods is signified by "loving," is because they who were represented by the Hebrew menservants are those who within the church are in truths of doctrine and not in good in accordance with these truths (see n. 8974, 8976). Such cannot be affected with truth for the sake of good, but for the sake of delight; and therefore by "loving," here, because it is said of such, is signified the delight of remembrance. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8987.">8987.</A></FONT></span>
<p>I will not go out free. That this signifies the delight of obedience, is evident from the signification of "going out free," as being the state after combat, which is merely a state of confirmed and implanted truth (of which above, n. 8976, 8980, 8984); for the service, which was of six years, and is called "a week" in Genesis 29:27, 28, signifies labor or some combat, such as those have who are in truths and not in the corresponding good, and who in the spiritual sense are meant by the "Hebrew menservants." These are of such a nature that they cannot be regenerated, but only reformed. For to be regenerated is said of those who suffer themselves to be brought by the Lord, by means of the truths called the truths of faith, to the good of spiritual life; but to be reformed is said of those who cannot be brought to the good of spiritual life by means of the truths which are of faith; but only to the delight of natural life. [2] They who suffer themselves to be regenerated, act from affection according to the precepts of faith; but they who do not suffer themselves to be regenerated, but only to be reformed, do not act from affection, but from obedience. The difference is this. They who act from affection, act from the heart, and thus from freedom, and they also do truth for the sake of truth, and good for the sake of good, and thus they exercise charity for the sake of the neighbor; but they who act from obedience do not thus act from the heart, consequently not from freedom. If they seem to themselves to act from the heart and from freedom, it is for the sake of something of self-glory which causes it to be so perceived; and they do not do truth for the sake of truth, nor good for the sake of good, but for the sake of the delight arising from this glory. Thus they do not practice charity toward the neighbor for the sake of the neighbor, but in order to be seen, and in order to be recompensed. From this it is evident who and of what quality are they who are represented by the sons of Israel, and who and of what quality are they who are represented by the Hebrew menservants. [3] But within the church at this day the knowledge of this distinction has been lost. The reason is that the church at this day is proclaimed and said to be from faith and not from charity; and few know what faith is; most persons believing that faith consists in knowing those things which the doctrine of the church teaches, and in being persuaded that they are true; but not that it consists in living according to them. Life according to them they call "moral life," which they separate from the doctrine of the church, and entitle it Moral Theology. But the learned believe that faith is confidence or trust that they are saved by the Lord's having suffered for them, and redeemed them from hell; and they say that those are saved who have this confidence; thus by faith alone. But such persons do not consider that there cannot be the confidence of faith, except with those who live a life of charity. [4] These are the reasons why knowledge has been lost concerning the difference between those who are in truths of faith and not in the corresponding good of life, and those who are in good of life corresponding with the truths of faith; and because this knowledge has been lost, what has now been said about those who are in truths and not in good, who are signified by "the Hebrew menservants," cannot but appear strange. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="8988.">8988.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Then his master shall bring him unto God. That this signifies a state into which he then enters according to Divine order, is evident from the signification of "bringing unto God," when those are treated of who are in truths and cannot be in good, as being to cause them to enter into a state according to Divine order; for by "bringing unto" is signified to enter; and by "God" is signified Divine order (of which in what follows). That these things are signified is plain from what follows in this verse, in which is described the state of those who are in truths and not in the corresponding good, namely, that it is a state of perpetual obedience. For they who are in this state are in servitude relatively to those who are in good that corresponds with truths; because as these latter act from good, they act from affection; and they who act from affection, act from the will, thus of themselves; for whatsoever is of the will with man is his own, seeing that the being of man's life is his will. But they who act merely from obedience do not act from their will, but from the will of their master; thus not from themselves, but from another; and therefore they are relatively in servitude. To act from truths, and not from good, is to act solely from the intellectual part; for truths bear relation to the intellectual part, and goods to the will part; and to act from the intellectual part, and not from the will part, is to act from that which stands without and serves, because the understanding has been given to man to receive truths, and to introduce them into the will, that they may become goods; for truths are called goods when they become of the will. [2] But to serve the Lord, by doing according to His commandments, and thus by obeying Him, is not to be a servant, but is to be free, for the veriest freedom of man consists in being led of the Lord (n. 892, 905, 2870, 2872), because the Lord inspires into the very will of man the good from which he is to act, and though it is from the Lord, still it is perceived as if it were from self, thus from freedom. This freedom is possessed by all who are in the Lord, and it is conjoined with inexpressible happiness. [3] The term "God" here denotes Divine order, because in the Word "God" is named where truth is treated of, and "Jehovah" where good is treated of (n. 2769, 2807, 2822, 3921, 4402, 7010, 7268, 8867); and therefore in the supreme sense the Divine truth proceeding from the Divine good of the Lord is "God," and His Divine good from which the Divine truth proceeds is "Jehovah." The reason is that the Divine good is Being itself, and the Divine truth is the derivative Coming-forth; for that which proceeds comes forth by so doing. The case is similar with good and truth in heaven, or with the angels, and also in the church with men. The good there is being itself, and the truth is the derivative coming-forth; or what is the same, love to the Lord and love toward the neighbor are the very being of heaven and of the church, but faith is the derivative coming-forth. From this it is clear whence it is that "God" denotes also Divine order, for it is the Divine truth proceeding from the Lord which makes order in heaven, insomuch that Divine truth is order itself. (That Divine truth is order, see n. 1728, 1919, 7995, 8700.) And therefore when a man or an angel receives Divine truth from the Lord in good, there is with him the order which is in the heavens, consequently he is a heaven or kingdom of the Lord in particular; and this in the degree in which he is in good from truths, and afterward in the degree in which he is in truths from good; and-what is a secret-the angels themselves appear in a human form in the heavens absolutely according to the truths which pertain to them in good, with a beauty and brightness according to the quality of the good from truths. As to their souls so also do the men of the church appear in heaven. It is the Divine truth itself proceeding from the Lord that leads to this, as can be seen from what has been shown about heaven as the Grand Man, and about its correspondence with everything in man, at the end of many chapters. [4] This secret is what is meant by these words of John in Revelation:      He measured the wall of the holy Jerusalem, a hundred and forty and four cubits, which is the measure of a man, that is, of an angel (Rev. 21:17). Who can possibly understand these words that does not know what is signified by "the holy Jerusalem;" what by "the wall" thereof; what by a "measure;" what by "the number one hundred and forty and four;" and thus what by "a man, that is, an angel?" By "the new and holy Jerusalem" is signified the New Church of the Lord which is at this day about to succeed the Christian Church (n. 2117); by "the wall" are signified the truths of faith which will defend that church (n. 6419); by "measuring" and "the measure" is signified its state as to truth (n. 3104); by the number "one hundred and forty and four" is signified the like as by "twelve," for one hundred and forty-four is a number compounded of twelve multiplied into twelve. (That by these numbers are signified all truths in the complex, see n. 7973). From this it is clear what is signified by "the measure of a man, that is, of an angel," namely, truth itself proceeding from the Lord in its own form, which as before said is the form of an angel man in heaven. All this makes clear the secret involved in the above words, namely, that by them are described the truths of that Church which is to succeed the Christian Church existing at this day. [5] That these are truths from good is described in the next following verse in these words:      The building of the wall thereof was jasper; and the city was pure gold, like to pure glass (Rev. 21:18). By "jasper" is signified truth such as will be the truth of that church, for by stones in general are signified truths (n. 1298, 3720, 6426), and by "precious stones," truths which are from the Lord (n. 643); by "gold" is signified the good of love and of wisdom (n. 113, 1551, 1552, 5658). Who could ever foresee that such things are involved in the above words? and who cannot see from this that innumerable arcana lie hidden in the Word, which in no wise appear to anyone except through the internal sense? and that by this sense, as by a key, are opened truths Divine such as are in heaven, consequently heaven and the Lord Himself, who, in the inmost sense, is the all in all of the Word. </p>

<p>And he shall bring him to the door, or unto the door post. That this signifies a state of communication of truth confirmed and implanted with spiritual good, is evident from the signification of a "door," as being the introduction of truth to good (see n. 2356, 2385), here of truth confirmed and implanted, which is signified by a Hebrew manservant after a service of six years (n. 8976, 8984), and as "a door" denotes introduction, it also denotes communication, for one room communicates with another by means of a door; and from the signification of "door-post," as being the conjunction of such truth with good, for a door-post stands between two rooms and joins them together. Who cannot see that this ritual for the menservants who remain contains in it some secret, and indeed a Divine one? for it was dictated and commanded by Jehovah from Mount Sinai. They who do not believe that there is anything more holy and Divine in the Word than that which appears in the letter, must needs wonder that these and many other things contained in this chapter and in the following chapters were dictated by Jehovah in a living voice; for in the letter they appear to be such things as are contained in the laws of nations-as this concerning menservants-that one who did not wish to go forth from service should be brought to a door or to a door-post, and should have his ear bored through with an awl by his master. In the sense of the letter this does not savor of anything Divine; nevertheless it is most Divine; but this does not appear except through the internal sense. The internal sense is that they who are in mere truths and not in the corresponding good, but yet are in the delight of the remembrance of spiritual goods (n. 8986, 8987), have some communication and conjunction with spiritual good. [2] This was represented by the ear of the servant being bored through at a door or at a door-post by his master; for "a door" denotes communication, and "a door-post" conjunction; the "ear" denotes obedience; and boring it through with an awl is representative of the state in which he would remain. Thus do the angels perceive these things who are with a man who is reading this word. For the angels do not think of a door or of a door-post, nor of an ear and its boring, nor even of a manservant; but instead thereof they think of the aforesaid communication and conjunction. For the angels are in the understanding of such things, because they are in light; and the things presented to them are spiritual and heavenly, not natural and worldly as are the things contained in the sense of the letter of the Word; for the sense of the letter of the Word is natural and worldly, but its internal sense is spiritual and heavenly; the literal sense is for men, the internal sense is for the angels, consequently there is a communication and conjunction of heaven with man by means of the Word. [3] In order that the arcana which are contained in this procedure with menservants that remain with their master may be opened still further, it must be told whence it is that "a door" and "a door-post" signify communication and conjunction. Angels and spirits have habitations which appear quite like those which are in the world (see n. 1116, 1626-1628, 1631, 4622), and-what is a secret-each and all things that appear in their habitations are significative of spiritual things; for they flow forth from the spiritual things which are in heaven, and which are consequently in their minds. Communications of truth with good are there presented to view by means of doors, and conjunctions by means of door-posts, and other things by the rooms themselves, by the courts, by the windows, and by the various adornments. That this is so, a man at this day, especially one who is merely natural, cannot believe, because such things are not manifest to the senses of the body. Nevertheless that such things were seen by the prophets when their interiors had been opened into heaven, is evident from the Word. They have also been perceived and seen by me a thousand times. I have moreover frequently heard them say, when their thoughts were in communication with me, that "the doors of their rooms were opened," and when they did not communicate, that they "were closed." [4] From this it is that mention is made of "doors" in the Word, where communication is treated of, as in Isaiah:      Go, My people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy door after thee; hide thyself as for a little moment, until the anger be overpast (Isa. 26:20). "To shut the door after oneself until the anger be overpast" denotes no communication with evils, which are "the anger" (see n. 3614, 5034, 5798, 6358, 6359, 6997, 8284, 8483). In Malachi:      Shall He receive faces from you? said Jehovah Zebaoth. Who is there even among you that would rather shut the doors? and not kindle a light upon Mine altar in vain (Mal. 1:9, 10). "To shut the doors" denotes not to communicate with holy or Divine things. In Zechariah:      Open thy doors O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy cedars (Zech. 11:1). "To open the doors" denotes to afford a passage or communication. [5] In David:      He commanded the skies from above; He set open the doors of the heavens (Ps. 78:23). "To set open the doors of the heavens" denotes to give communication with the truths and goods which are from the Lord in the heavens. Again:      I have chosen to stand at the door in the house of my God, rather than dwell in the tents of wickedness (Ps. 84:10). "To stand at the door" denotes to communicate abroad with good, which is "the house of God" (n. 3720). Again:      Lift up your heads, O ye gates; be ye lifted up, ye doors of the world; that the King of glory may come in (Ps. 24:7, 9). "The doors of the world being lifted up" denotes the opening and elevation of hearts to the Lord, who is "the King of glory," and so to give communication, that is, that He may flow in with the good of charity and with the truth of faith. The Lord is called "the King of glory" from the truth which is from good. [6] In Isaiah:      Jehovah said to His anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him, and I will loose the loins of kings: to open the doors before him, and the gates shall not be shut; I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight. And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I Jehovah, who have called thee by thy name, am the God of Israel (Isa. 45:1-3); speaking of the Lord as to His Human, who in the representative sense is "Cyrus;" to "open the doors before him" denotes to give entrance to the Divine Itself. Hence it is that even as to His Human He is called "God," here "the God of Israel." [7] In John:      Behold I have set before thee an open door, which no one can shut; for thou hast a little power, and hast kept My word (Rev. 3:8). "To set an open door" denotes communication with heaven. In the same:      After these things I saw, and behold a door opened In heaven. I heard, Come up hither, that I may show thee the things which must come to pass hereafter (Rev. 4:1). Here "a door" plainly denotes communication, because it is said of the revelation which he was about to receive from heaven. From this also it is plain that communication is there represented by a door, as was said above. In the same:      Behold I stand at the door, and knock; if anyone hear My voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with Me (Rev. 3:20). Here also "a door" plainly denotes entrance and communication with heaven, where the Lord is, and thus with the Lord. [8] In like manner in Matthew:      The bridegroom came, and the virgins went in to the wedding, and the door was shut. At last came the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us. But He answering said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not (Matt. 25:10-12). What these words signify in the internal sense, see at n. 4635-4638, namely, that "the virgins" denote those who are within the church; "to have oil in their lamps" denotes the good of charity in the truths of faith; and "not to have oil in their lamps" denotes to have the truths of faith, and no good of charity therein; to these latter the door is said to be "shut," because they do not communicate with heaven, that is, through heaven with the Lord. Communication with heaven, and through heaven, is effected by means of the good of charity and of love, but not truths, which are called the truths of faith, without good therein; and therefore these latter are called "foolish virgins," but the former "prudent virgins." [9] So in Luke:      Many shall seek to enter, but shall not be able. From the time when the master of the house is risen up, and hath shut to the door, then shall ye begin to stand without, and to knock at the door, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us; but He answering will say to you, I know you not whence ye are. Then shall ye begin to say, We have eaten and drunk in Thy presence, and Thou hast taught in our streets. But He shall say to you, I know you not whence ye are; depart from Me all ye workers of iniquity (Luke 13:24-27). Here also "a door" plainly denotes entrance and communication, as above. That they to whom the door is shut and who knock thereat and are not let in, are those who are in truths of faith from the Word and not in the good of charity, is signified by "eating and drinking in the presence of the Lord and hearing the Lord teach in the streets," and yet not living the life of faith; for they who do not live this life are "workers of iniquity." [10] In John:      Verily, verily, I say into you, he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. I am the door; by Me if anyone shall enter in, he shall be saved (John 10:1, 2, 9). "To enter in by the door" denotes by the truth which is of faith to the good of charity and of love, thus to the Lord, for the Lord is good itself; He is also the truth which introduces, thus likewise the "door," for faith is from Him. [11] That by "a door" is signified communication, appears like a metaphorical way of speaking, or like a comparison; but in the Word there are no metaphorical expressions or comparisons, but real correspondences. Even the comparisons therein are made by such things as correspond, as can be seen from what has been said about a door, namely, that doors actually appear in heaven with angels and spirits, and that their opening and shutting are according to the communications. And so in everything else. </p>

<p>And his master shall bore through his ear with his awl. That this signifies a representative of obedience, is evident from the signification of "the ear," as being obedience (see n. 2542, 3869, 4551, 4652-4660); and from the signification of "boring through with an awl," namely, to the door, or to the door-post, as being to affix; here, as obedience is treated of, as being to assign; and therefore it follows that "he shall serve him forever," that is, shall be obedient. From this it is plain that the boring through of the ear with an awl to the door or to the door-post by his master is representative of obedience. [2] How the case herein is, can be seen from what precedes, namely, that they who are in truths alone, and not in the corresponding good, that is, who are in faith and not in charity, are not free, but are servants. For they who act from good, or charity, are free, because they act from themselves; for to act from good, or charity, is to act from the heart, that is, from the will, thus from what is one's own; for that which is of the will belongs to the man, and that which is done from the will is said to go forth from the heart. But they who are only in the truths of faith and not in the good of charity, are relatively servants, for they do not act from themselves, because they have no good in themselves from which to act; but it is outside of themselves, and they act from it as often as they remember it. They who are of this character even to the end of life, remain after death in this state; and they cannot be brought to a state so as to act from the affection of charity, thus from good, but only from obedience. In the Grand Man, which is heaven, these persons constitute those things which serve the interiors, such as the membranes and skins (n. 8977, 8980). [3] From all this it can be seen how the case is with faith alone, thus with those who from doctrine set faith in the first place, and the good of charity in the second place, and even in the last place. They who actually, that is, in the life itself, so regard faith, are Hebrew servants in the representative sense. From all this it may also be concluded how the case is with those who make everything of salvation to consist in the truths of faith, and nothing in the good of charity; namely, that actually, or in the life itself, they cannot enter into heaven; for good reigns in heaven, and not truth without good; neither is truth truth, nor faith faith, except with those who are in good. [4] That the boring through of the ear with an awl by his master is representative of obedience, is plain also from the fact that to affix the ear to the door is to cause attention to be given to those things which his master, who is in the room, commands; thus it is to hear continually, and consequently to obey; here in the spiritual sense the things which good wills and commands, for by the master of the servant is represented spiritual good (n. 8981, 8986). As "the ear" signifies the hearing which is of obedience, therefore by virtue of an origin coming from the spiritual world there has flowed into human speech the expression, "to pinch the ear," meaning to cause a person to be attentive, and to remember; in like manner the expressions "to hear," and "to hearken to," anyone, meaning to obey. For the interior sense of very many expressions has flowed from the spiritual world by virtue of correspondences; in like manner as when we speak of "spiritual light," and the consequent "sight," as denoting what is of faith; also of "spiritual fire," and the consequent "life," as denoting what is of love. [5] The reason why the boring through of the ear was to be done with an awl, was because by an "awl" is signified the like as by a "peg," or a "nail," namely, an affixing or joining to, and in the spiritual sense an assignment to anything; but the awl was an instrument of service, and therefore serves to represent assignment to perpetual obedience on the part of the servant. That "pegs" or "nails" signify an affixing, or adjoining to, is evident from the passages where they are mentioned; as in Isa. 22:23; 33:20; 41:7; 54:2; Jer. 10:4; Exod. 27:19; 38:31; Num. 3:37; 4:32. </p>

<p>And he shall serve him forever. That this signifies to eternity, is evident from the signification of "serving," as being to obey, for servants are they who obey, and masters are they who command; that those who were represented by the menservants denote those who have done what is good from obedience, but not from the affection of charity, is evident from what precedes; and from the signification of "forever," as being to eternity. In the sense of the letter "forever" here signifies service with his master even to the end of his life; but in the internal or spiritual sense it signifies what is eternal, because it signifies the state after death. It is said "to eternity," because they who do what is good from the obedience of faith, and not from the affection of charity, who are represented by the menservants, in the other life can never be brought to a state of good, that is, to act from good; because everyone's life remains after death. Such as a man is when he dies, such he remains; according to the common saying, "as the tree falls so it lies;" not that he is such as he is near the hours of death, but such as from the whole course of his life he is when he dies. And therefore they who during their life in the world have become habituated to doing what is good from obedience only, and not from charity, remain such to eternity. They are indeed perfected in respect to obedience; but they do not attain to anything of charity. </p>

<p>Verses 7-11. And when a man shall sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out according to the going out of the menservants. If she be evil in the eyes of her master, so that he will not betroth her, then he shall let her be redeemed: to sell her to a strange people he shall have no power in his acting treacherously against her. And if he shall betroth her to his son, he shall do to her according to the judgment of daughters. If he shall take him another; her food, her covering, and her conjugial due, he shall not diminish. And if he shall not do these three to her, then she shall go out free with no silver. "And when a man shall sell his daughter to be a maidservant," signifies the affection of truth from natural delight; "she shall not go out according to the going out of the menservants," signifies a state not like truth without affection; "if she be evil in the eyes of her master," signifies if the affection of truth from natural delight does not agree with spiritual truth; "so that he will not betroth her," signifies so that it cannot be conjoined; "then he shall let her be redeemed," signifies alienation from these truths; "to sell her to a strange people he shall have no power," signifies not to those who are not of the faith of the church; "in his acting treacherously against her," signifies this being contrary to the laws of Divine order; "and if he shall betroth her to his son," signifies if it agrees with any derived truth so that it can be conjoined therewith; "he shall do to her according to the judgment of daughters," signifies that it shall be as is the genuine affection of truth; "if he shall take him another," signifies conjunction with the affection of truth from another stock; "her food, her clothing, and her conjugial due he shall not diminish," signifies no deprivation of the interior life which is "food," nor of the exterior life which is "clothing," thus no deprivation of conjunction which is the "conjugial due;" "and if he shall not do these three to her," signifies the deprivation of these; "she shall go out free with no silver," signifies alienation therefrom without truth conjoined with it. </p>

<p>And when a man shall sell his daughter to be a maid-servant. That this signifies the affection of truth from natural delight, is evident from the signification of "a man's daughter," as being the affection of truth, for by "a daughter" is signified affection (see n. 2362, 3963), and by "man," truth (n. 3134), as also by "an Israelite," who is here meant by "a man" (n. 5414, 5879, 5951, 7957, 8234); and from the signification of "a maidservant," as being external or natural affection (n. 2567, 3835, 3849); consequently by "a man's daughter being sold for a maidservant" is signified the affection of truth from the delight of natural affection. [2] By natural delight is meant the delight that flows forth from the love of self and the love of the world. They who are in the affection of truth from this, are they who learn the doctrinal things of the church, which are called the truths of faith, either for the sake of gain, or for the sake of honors, and not for the sake of life. Such affections of truth, which do not flow forth from spiritual good, but from natural delight, are represented by the daughter of an Israelitish man sold to be a handmaid or maidservant; for everything which has its origin from the love of self, or from love of the world, is not free; but servile (what is meant by "free," and what by "servile," see n. 892, 905, 1947, 2870-2893, 6205). How the case is with the affections of truth that originate from these loves, is described in the internal sense in what now follows. [3] Bear in mind that the genuine affection of truth is willing and longs to know the veriest truths of faith for the sake of good use as the end, and for the sake of life; but the affection of truth that is not genuine desires and longs for truths for the sake of self, thus for seeking honors, and for hunting gains. They who are in the affection of truth from this origin do not care whether the truths they know are genuine, provided they are such as they can pass off as truths; and therefore they stick in the mere confirmation of the doctrinal things of the church in which they were born, whether these be true or not true. They are also in darkness in respect to truths themselves, for worldly ends which are gains, and bodily ends which are honors, completely blindfold them. [4] But they who are in the genuine affection of truth, that is, who long to know truths for the sake of good use, and for the sake of life, also abide in the doctrinal things of the church until they arrive at the age when they begin to think for themselves; then they search the Scriptures and supplicate the Lord for enlightenment, and when they are enlightened they rejoice from the heart. For they know that if they had been born where there is another doctrine of the church, nay, the greatest heresy, without searching the Scriptures from the genuine affection of truth, they would have remained in that doctrine; as for example, if they had been born Jews, or if they had been born Socinians. From this it is plain who and of what quality they are who are in the genuine affection of truth, and who and of what quality they are who are in an affection of truth that is not genuine. They who are in the genuine affection of truth are in the representative sense the daughters of Israelitish men; but they who are in an affection of truth that is not genuine are in the representative sense maidservants from the daughters of Israel. </p>

<p>She shall not go out according to the going out of the menservants. That this signifies a state not like truth without affection, is evident from the signification of "going out," namely, from service, as being the state after combat, or labor (see above, n. 8980, 8984); and from the signification of "menservants," as being those who are in truths and not in the corresponding good (n. 8974), thus who are in truth without affection. From this it is plain that by "she shall not go out according to the going out of the menservants" is signified a state not like truth without affection. [2] How this is shall be briefly told. There are some who are in truth and not in the affection of it; and there are some who are in this affection. The former were represented by the menservants from the sons of Israel; but the latter by the maidservants also from the sons of Israel. By the maidservants however were not represented those who are in the genuine affection of truth; but those who are in an affection not genuine (as can be seen from what has been shown just above, n. 8993). [3] The difference between those who are in truth without affection, who were represented by the menservants, and those who are in the affection of truth, who were represented by the maidservants, is such as there is between knowing truth, and willing truth. To know truth belongs solely to the intellectual part, but to will truth to the will part; and thus the difference is such as is that between knowledge and affection. They who are in the knowledge of truth and good, and who in the representative sense are "menservants," or "men," are not affected with truth and good, but only with the knowledge thereof; consequently they are delighted with truths for the sake of knowledge. But they who are in the affection of truth and of good, and who in the representative sense are "maidservants," or "women," are not affected with knowledge, but with the truths and goods themselves when they hear them, and perceive them in others. Such affection is common with good women, but the affection of the knowledge of truth is common with men. [4] From this it is that they who are in spiritual perception love women who are affected with truths, but do not love women who are in knowledges; for it is according to Divine order that men should be in knowledges, but women solely in affections; and thus that women should not love themselves from knowledges, but should love men; whence comes the conjugial. From this also it is that it was said by the ancients that women should be silent in the church. This being the case, knowledges are represented by men, but affections by women; here the affections of truth which spring from the delights of natural loves, by the maidservants; and as these are of a totally different nature from those who are affected with knowledges, therefore the case with maidservants is quite different from what it is with menservants. This then is what is signified by the statute that the maidservant shall not go out according to the going out of the menservants. But be it known that the case is so with those who are of the Lord's spiritual kingdom; but the other way about with those who are of His celestial kingdom. In the latter kingdom husbands are in affection, but wives in the knowledges of good and truth. From this comes the conjugial with these. </p>

<p>If she be evil in the eyes of her master. That this signifies if the affection of truth from natural delight does not agree with spiritual truth, is evident from the signification of "a maidservant," of whom it is said that she is "evil," as being affection from natural delight (see n. 8993, 8994); from the signification of "evil," when said of this affection relatively to spiritual truth, as being not to agree therewith (of which below); from the signification of "in the eyes," as being in the perception (see n. 2829, 3529, 4083, 4339); and from the signification of "master," as being spiritual truth (n. 8981). [2] How the case herein is must be told. That "a maidservant" denotes the affection of truth from the delights of the love of self or of the love of the world was said above (n. 8993, 8994); and that this affection can be conjoined with spiritual truth can be seen from the fact that the affection of spiritual truth is an internal affection, or is in the interior man; whereas the affection of truth from natural delight is in the external man. The internal affection which is of the spiritual man is constantly conjoined with the external affection which is of the natural man, but still in such a way that the internal affection of truth is the ruling affection, and the external affection is subservient; for it is according to Divine order that the spiritual man should rule over the natural (n. 8961, 8967). Moreover when the spiritual man rules, the man looks upward, which is represented by having the head in heaven; but when the natural man rules, the man looks downward, which is represented by having the head in hell. [3] To throw more light on this subject something further shall be said. Most men by the truths which they learn, and the goods which they do, do indeed think of a consequent advantage, or of honor in their country; but if these things are regarded as the end, the natural man rules and the spiritual serves; if however they are not regarded as the end, but only as means to the end, the spiritual man rules and the natural man serves, according to what has been already said (n. 7819, 7820). For when gain or honor is regarded as a means to an end, and not as the end, the gain or honor is not regarded, but the end, which is use. As for example he who desires and procures for himself riches for the sake of use, which he loves above all things, is not in this case delighted with riches for the sake of riches, but for the sake of uses. Moreover the very uses make the spiritual life with men, and riches merely serve as means (see n. 6933-6938). From this it can be seen what must be the quality of the natural man in order that it may be conjoined with the spiritual, namely, that it must regard gains and honors, thus riches and dignities, as means, and not as the end; for that which is regarded by a man as the end makes his veriest life, because he loves it above all things, for that which is loved is regarded as the end. [4] He who does not know that the end, or what is the same, the love, makes the spiritual life of a man, consequently that a man is where his love is, in heaven if the love is heavenly, in hell if the love is infernal, cannot comprehend how the case is in regard to this. He may suppose that the delight of natural loves, which are the love of self and the love of the world, cannot agree with spiritual truth and good; for he does not know that in the course of regeneration a man must be wholly inverted, and that when he has been inverted he has his head in heaven, but that before he has been inverted he has his head in hell. He has his head in hell when he regards the delights of the love of self or of the love of the world as the end; but he has his head in heaven when these delights are as means to the end. For the end, which is the love, is the only thing with man that is alive; the means to the end are of themselves not alive, but they receive life from the end. Consequently the means from the ultimate end are called mediate ends; and these, insofar as they regard the ultimate end which is the principal end, are so far alive. From this it is that when a man has been regenerated, consequently when he has as the end to love the neighbor and to love the Lord, he then has as means the loving of himself and the world. When man is of this character, then when he looks to the Lord he accounts himself as nothing, and also the world; and if he regards himself as anything, it is that he may be able to serve the Lord. But previously the contrary had been the case; for when he looked to himself, he had accounted the Lord as nothing, or if as anything, it was that thereby he might have gain and honor. [5] From all this it can be seen what is the nature of the secret that lies hidden in these statutes concerning the maidservants from the daughters of Israel, namely, that though they were servants, still, if they were good, they were betrothed to the master by whom they were bought, or to his son; but if evil, they were not betrothed, but were either redeemed, or sold; according to what is contained in these verses. Moreover to betroth maidservants, or to have them for concubines, was permitted in the representative church, especially in the Jewish and Israelitish church, for the reason that a wife represented the affection of spiritual truth, but a maidservant the affection of natural truth; thus the former represented the internal of the church with man, but the latter the external. This was represented by Hagar, who was betrothed to Abraham; and also by the two handmaids who were betrothed to Jacob. From all this it is now evident what is meant in the internal representative sense by a maidservant not being able to be betrothed if she was evil; namely, if the affection from natural delight (which is "a maidservant") does not agree with the spiritual, which chiefly happens owing to the fact that it wishes to rule, and that it is of such a disposition and heart that it cannot be bent to love the Lord. Moreover the agreement or disagreement with the spiritual of the affection from natural delight is according to the quality of each; but to divide these into their categories would be too tedious. (That "a maidservant" also denotes an affirmative means that serves for the conjunction of the external and the internal man, see n. 3913, 3917, 3931.) </p>

<p>So that he will not betroth her. That this signifies that it cannot be conjoined, is evident from the signification of "to be betrothed," as being to be conjoined; for they who are betrothed are conjoined. In the internal sense by "to be betrothed" is properly signified the agreement of dispositions or of minds which precedes the conjunction of marriage; and as in the spiritual world agreement conjoins, and disagreement disjoins, therefore by "to be betrothed" is here signified to be conjoined. </p>

<p>Then he shall let her be redeemed. That this signifies alienation from these truths, is evident from the signification of "being redeemed" by him who sold her, or by another, thus of being sold by the master, as being alienation from that spiritual truth. (That "to be sold" denotes alienation, see n. 4098, 4752, 4758, 5886; also that "master" denotes spiritual truth, n. 8981, 8995.) </p>

<p>To sell her to a strange people he shall have no power. That this signifies not to those who are not of the faith of the church, is evident from the signification of "a strange people," as being those who are outside of the church, thus who are not of the faith of the church (see n. 2049, 2115, 7996); and from the signification of "selling," as being to alienate (of which just above, n. 8997). In regard to this, the case is that those who have been born within the church, and from infancy have been imbued with the principles of the truth of the church, ought not to contract marriages with those who are outside of the church, and have thus been imbued with such things as are not of the church. The reason is that there is no conjunction between them in the spiritual world, for everyone in that world is in consociation according to his good and the truth thence derived; and as there is no conjunction between such in the spiritual world, neither ought there to be any conjunction on earth. For regarded in themselves marriages are conjunctions of dispositions and of minds, the spiritual life of which is from the truths and goods of faith and of charity. On this account moreover marriages on earth between those who are of a different religion are accounted in heaven as heinous, and still more so marriages between those who are of the church and those who are outside of the church. This also was the reason why the Jewish and Israelitish nation was forbidden to contract matrimonies with the Gentiles (Deut. 7:3, 4), and why it was absolutely heinous to commit whoredom with them (Num. 25:1-9). [2] This appears still more evidently from the origin of conjugial love, which is from the marriage of good and truth (n. 2727-2759). When conjugial love descends from this source, it is heaven itself in man. This is destroyed when two consorts are of unlike heart from unlike faith. From this then it is that a maidservant from the daughters of Israel, that is, from those who are of the church, was not to be sold to a strange people, that is, to those who are outside of the church; for these would then betroth her, that is, would be conjoined with her, and would thus profane the things which are of the church; and therefore it is said that this is "to act treacherously." </p>

<p>In his acting treacherously against her. That this signifies that this is contrary to the laws of Divine order, is evident from the signification of "acting treacherously," as being contrary to truth Divine, or what is the same, contrary to the laws of Divine order; that this is signified by "acting treacherously" is plain from what was adduced just above (n. 8998). In heaven the laws of Divine order are truths, for Divine order is from the Divine truth which proceeds from the Lord (n. 8700, 8988). "To act treacherously" is a customary form of speaking in the Word, signifying in the internal sense to act contrary to the truth and good in heaven, or what is the same, contrary to Divine order; as in Isa. 21:2; 33:1; 48:8, and elsewhere; Jer. 3:20; 5:11; 12:1, 6; Hos. 5:7; 6:7; Mal. 2:10, 11, 14, 15; Ps. 78:57; 119:158. </p>

<p>And if he shall betroth her to his son. That this signifies if it agrees with any derived truth so that it can be conjoined therewith, is evident from the signification of "a son," as being truth (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623, 2803, 2813, 3373, 3704, 4257), here derived truth, because by the master who is the father is signified the principal truth from which the rest are derived (n. 8981); and from the signification of "betrothing," as being to be conjoined (of which above, n. 8996). </p>
