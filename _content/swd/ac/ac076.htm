<p>CHAPTER 29            By way of preface to the preceding chapter an explication was given of what the Lord foretold in Matthew 24:15-18 concerning the last time of the church. Following this order there are now to be unfolded-by way of preface to the present chapter-the contents of the succeeding verses (19 to 22); namely, the words:      But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days! And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath; for then shall be great affliction, such as was not since the beginning of the world even until now, neither shall be. And except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be preserved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened (Matt. 24:19-22). </p>

<p>No one can possibly comprehend the signification of these words unless he is enlightened by the internal sense. That they are not said concerning the destruction of Jerusalem appears from many things in the chapter, as from this:      Except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be preserved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened; and from the following:      After the affliction of those days the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man; and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and glory; and from other passages. That neither are the words now under consideration said concerning the destruction of the world, is also evident from many things contained in the same chapter; as from those which precede:      He that is on the housetop, let him not come down to take anything out of his house; and he who is in the field, let him not return back to take his garments; and also from these now brought under consideration:      Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath; and from the following:      Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left; two women shall be grinding at the mill, the one shall be taken, and the other left. But it is evident that the words in question are said concerning the last time of the church, that is, concerning its vastation; for the church is said to be vastated when there is no longer any charity. </p>

<p>Everyone who thinks about the Lord with reverence and who believes that the Divine was in Him, and that He spoke from the Divine, is able to know and believe that the above words, like the rest the Lord taught and spoke, were not spoken of one nation only, but of the universal human race; and not of its worldly, but of its spiritual state; and also that the Lord's words comprehended the things which are of His kingdom and of the church, for these are Divine and eternal. Whoever believes in this manner, concludes that these words: "Woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days," do not signify those who are with child and give suck; and that the words: "Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the Sabbath," do not signify any flight on account of worldly enemies; and so in regard to the rest. </p>

<p>In the preceding verses there were treated of three states of the perversion of good and truth in the church; and in the present verses a fourth state is treated of, which is also the last. Concerning the first state it was shown that it was that men began no longer to know what was good and true, but disputed among themselves concerning good and truth, whence came falsities (n. 3354). Concerning the second state, that it was that men began to despise good and truth, and also to hold them in aversion, and thus that faith in the Lord was about to expire, according to the degrees in which charity was about to cease (n. 3487, 3488). Concerning the third state, that it was a state of desolation of the church in respect to good and truth (n. 3651, 3652). Concerning the fourth state, we are now to show that it is that of the profanation of good and truth. That this state is here described, may be seen from all the particulars in the internal sense, which is as follows. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3755.">3755.</A></FONT></span>
<p>But woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days; signifies those who have been imbued with the good of love to the Lord and the good of innocence. "Woe" is a form of expression signifying the danger of eternal damnation; "to be with child" is to conceive the good of heavenly love; "to give suck" is also a state of innocence; "those days" denote the states in which the church then is.      [2] And pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath; signifies removal from those things, that it be not done precipitately, in a state of too much cold or of too much heat. "Flight" is removal from a state of the good of love and of innocence, just now spoken of; "flight in the winter" is removal therefrom in a state of too much cold; "cold" is when there is aversion to love and innocence, which is induced by the loves of self; "flight on the sabbath" is removal from them in a state of too much heat; "heat" is external sanctity, while within are the love of self and the love of the world.      [3] For then shall be great affliction, such as was not since the beginning of the world even until now, neither shall be; signifies the highest degree of the perversion and vastation of the church in respect to good and truth, which is profanation; for profanation of what is holy occasions death eternal and much more grievous than any other states of evil, and so much the more grievous in proportion as the goods and truths profaned are of a more interior kind; and inasmuch as such interior goods and truths are open and known in the Christian Church, and are profaned, it is said that "then shall be great affliction such as was not from the beginning of the world even until now, neither shall be."      [4] And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be preserved; but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened; signifies the removal of those who are of the church from interior goods and truths to exterior, so that those may still be saved who are in the life of good and truth; by the "days being shortened," is signified a state of removal; by "no flesh being preserved," is signified that otherwise none could be saved; by "the elect" are signified those who are in the life of good and truth. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3756.">3756.</A></FONT></span>
<p>That this is the internal sense of these words could be fully shown-as that by "those who are with child" are signified those who first become imbued with good; and that by "those who give suck" are signified those who become imbued with a state of innocence; that by "flight" is signified removal from good and innocence; by "winter," aversion to such goods through the love of self taking possession of the interiors; and by "flight on the sabbath," profanation, which takes place when there is holiness in externals, and the love of self and the world within. But as the same words and similar expressions occur throughout in what follows, of the Lord's Divine mercy their signification shall then be shown to be such as is here stated. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3757.">3757.</A></FONT></span>
<p>But as regards the profanation of what is holy, few know what it is; yet this can be seen from what has been already stated and shown concerning it, namely, that those are able to profane holy things who know, acknowledge, and become imbued with good and truth; but not those who do not acknowledge, and still less those who do not know them (see n. 593, 1008, 1010, 1059, 3398): Thus that they who are within the church can profane holy things, but not they who are without it (n. 2051): That they who are of the celestial church can profane holy goods, and that they who are of the spiritual church can profane holy truths (n. 3399): That therefore interior truths were not disclosed to the Jews, lest they should profane them (n. 3398): That the Gentiles can least of all profane (n. 2051): That profanation is a commingling and conjunction of good and evil, and also of truth and falsity (n. 1001, 1003, 2426): That this was signified by the eating of blood, which was so severely prohibited in the Jewish Church (n. 1003): That therefore insofar as possible men are withheld from the acknowledgment and faith of good and truth, unless they are able to remain therein (n. 3398, 3402); and that on this account they are kept in ignorance (n. 301-303); and that worship also becomes external (n. 1327, 1328): That internal truths are not revealed until the church has been vastated, because then good and truth can no longer be profaned (n. 3398, 3399): That this was the reason why the Lord then first came into the world (n. 3398): How great a danger there is from the profanation of what is holy and of the Word (n. 571, 582).            GENESIS 29      1. And Jacob lifted up his feet, and went to the land of the sons of the east.      2. And he saw, and behold a well in the field, and behold there three droves of the flock lying by it; for out of that well they watered the droves; and a great stone was upon the well's mouth.      3. And all the droves were gathered together thither; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock, and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth.      4. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren whence are ye? And they said, We are from Haran.      5. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him.      6. And he said unto them, Hath he peace? And they said, Peace; and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with the flock.      7. And he said, Behold as yet the day is great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together: water ye the flock, and go and feed them.      8. And they said, We cannot until all the droves are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then shall we water the flock.      9. While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with the flock which was her father's, for she was a shepherdess.      10. And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the flock of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.      11. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept.      12. And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.      13. And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and kissed him, and brought him to his house; and he told Laban all these things.      14. And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh. And he dwelt with him a month of days.      15. And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? Tell me, what shall be thy reward?      16. And Laban had two daughters, the name of the elder was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.      17. And Leah's eyes were weak, and Rachel was beautiful in form and beautiful in look.      18. And Jacob loved Rachel, and he said, I will serve thee seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter.      19. And Laban said, It is better that I should give her to thee than give her to another man; abide with me.      20. And Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they were in his eyes as a few days, for the love he had to her.      21. And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my woman, for my days are fulfilled, and I will come to her.      22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.      23. And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter, and brought her to him, and he came to her.      24. And Laban gave her Zilpah his handmaid, unto his daughter Leah for a handmaid.      25. And it came to pass in the morning that behold it was Leah; and he said unto Laban, What is this that thou hast done unto me? Did not I serve with thee for Rachel? And why hast thou defrauded me?      26. And Laban said, It is not so done in our place, to give the younger before the firstborn.      27. Fulfill this week, and we will give thee her also, for the service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.      28. And Jacob did so, and fulfilled this week, and he gave him Rachel his daughter for a woman.      29. And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to be to her for a handmaid.      30. And he came also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.      31. And Jehovah saw that Leah was hated, and He opened her womb, and Rachel was barren.      32. And Leah conceived and bare a son, and she called his name Reuben, for she said, Because Jehovah hath seen my affliction, for now my man will love me.      33. And she conceived again, and bare a son, and said, Because Jehovah hath heard that I was hated, and hath given me this one also; and she called his name Simeon.      34. And she conceived again, and bare a son, and said, Now this time will my man cleave to me, because I have borne him three sons; therefore she called his name Levi.      35. And she conceived again, and bare a son, and she said, This time I will confess Jehovah; therefore she called his name Judah; and she stood still from bearing. </p>

<p>THE CONTENTS.      In the internal sense of this chapter by "Jacob" is described the Lord's natural-how the good of truth therein was conjoined with kindred good from a Divine origin, which good is "Laban;" at first through the affection of external truth, which is "Leah;" and then through the affection of internal truth, which is "Rachel." </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3759.">3759.</A></FONT></span>
<p>Afterwards by the birth of the four sons of Jacob by Leah is described in the supreme sense the ascent from external truth to internal good; but in the representative sense the state of the church, which is such that it does not acknowledge and receive the internal truths that are in the Word, but external truths; and this being the case, it ascends to interior things according to this order, namely, that at first it has the truth which is said to be of faith; next, practice according to this truth; afterwards the consequent charity; and finally celestial love. These four degrees are signified by the four sons of Jacob borne of Leah, namely, Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah. </p>

<p>THE INTERNAL SENSE. Verse 1. And Jacob lifted up his feet, and went to the land of the sons of the east. "And Jacob lifted up his feet," signifies the elevation of the natural; "and went to the land of the sons of the east," signifies to the truths of love. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3761.">3761.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Jacob lifted up his feet. That this signifies the elevation of the natural, is evident from the signification of "lifting up," as being elevation; and from the signification of the "feet," as being the natural, concerning which in what follows. The elevation here signified is that treated of in this chapter, which is from external truth to internal good. In the supreme sense it is shown how the Lord elevated His natural even to the Divine, according to order, by ascending from external truth through the degrees to internal good; and in the representative sense, how the Lord makes new the natural of man when He regenerates him, according to a similar order. That the man who is being regenerated in adult age advances according to the order described in the internal sense in this and the following chapters, is known to few, for the reason that few reflect upon it, and also that few at this day can be regenerated. For these are the last times of the church, when there is no longer any charity, consequently not any faith; and this being the case, it is not even known what faith is, although it is on the lips of all that man is saved by faith. Still less is it known what charity is; and as these two are known merely as terms, and are unknown in respect to their essence, it is on this account said that few can reflect upon the order according to which man is made new, or is regenerated, and also that few can be regenerated.  [2] Because the natural is here treated of, and this is represented by Jacob, it is not said that he "arose," and went to the land of the sons of the east, but that he "lifted up his feet." Both expressions signify elevation (that "arising" has this signification may be seen above, n. 2401, 2785, 2912, 2927, 3171). But the reason why it is here said, "he lifted up his feet," is that this is said with respect to the natural; for "feet" signify the natural (n. 2162, 3147). That "feet" signify the natural, or natural things, comes from the correspondence with the Grand Man which has been spoken of at the close of the preceding chapters, in which Grand Man they who belong to the province of the feet are those who are in natural light and but little in spiritual; consequently the parts under the feet, as the soles and the heels, signify the lowest natural things (see n. 259); and hence the shoe, which is also occasionally mentioned in the Word, signifies the corporeal natural which is the ultimate (n. 1748). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3762.">3762.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And went to the land of the sons of the east. That this signifies to the truths of love (that is, elevation thereto) is evident from the signification of the "land of the sons of the east." That Aram, or Syria, was called the "land of the sons of the east," is evident, because it was thither that Jacob betook himself (see n. 3249). That by "Syria" in general are signified the knowledges of good, was shown above (n. 1232, 1234); but specifically, by "Aram-naharaim" (that is, "Syria of the rivers") are signified the knowledges of truth (n. 3051, 3664). In this case however it is not said that he went "to Aram," or "Syria," but "to the land of the sons of the east," in order to signify what is treated of in this chapter throughout, namely, an ascent to the truths of love. Those truths are called the truths of love which have been elsewhere termed celestial truths, for they are knowledges that relate to charity toward the neighbor and love to the Lord; in the supreme sense, in which the Lord is treated of, they are the truths of Divine love.  [2] These truths, that relate to charity toward the neighbor and to love to the Lord, must be learned before it is possible for a man to be regenerated; and must also be acknowledged and believed; and insofar as they are acknowledged, believed, and ingrafted in the life, so far the man is regenerated, and insofar they are at the same time implanted in the man's natural, in which they are as in their own ground. They are first implanted therein through instruction by parents and teachers; next from the Word of the Lord; and afterwards through the man's own reflection about them; but by these means they are merely stored up in the memory of the natural man, being classed among the knowledges therein, but still not acknowledged, believed, and ingrafted, unless the life is in accordance with them; for in this case the man comes into affection, and insofar as he comes into affection from life, so far these truths are implanted in his natural as in their ground. The truths which are not thus implanted are indeed with the man, but are merely in his memory as a matter of mere knowledge or history, which serves no other purpose than to be talked about and made the means of getting a reputation which is to serve for the acquisition of riches and honors. But in this case these truths are not implanted. [3] That by the "land of the sons of the east" are signified the truths of love, thus the knowledges of truth which tend to good, may be seen from the signification of "sons," as being truths (see n. 489, 491, 533, 1147, 2623); and from the signification of the "east," as being love (n. 101, 1250, 3249). Their "land" is the ground in which they are. That the "sons of the east" are those who are in the knowledges of truth and good, and consequently in the truths of love, may be seen also from other passages in the Word. As in the first book of Kings:      The wisdom of Solomon was multiplied more than the wisdom of all the sons of the east, and than all the wisdom of the Egyptians (1 Kings:4:30); where by the "wisdom of the sons of the east" are signified the interior knowledges of truth and good, thus those who are in them;" but by the "wisdom of the Egyptians" is signified the memory-knowledge of the same, which is in a lower degree. (That by the "Egyptians" are signified memory-knowledges in general, may be seen n. 1164, 1165, 1462.) [4] In Jeremiah:      Thus saith Jehovah, Arise ye, go up against Kedar, lay waste the sons of the east. Their tents and their flocks they shall take; they shall take their curtains, and all their vessels, and their camels (Jer. 49:28-29). That by the "sons of the east" are here meant those who are in the knowledges of good and truth, is evident from the fact that they were to take their tents and flocks, also their curtains and all their vessels, and likewise their camels; for by "tents" are signified the holy things of good (n. 414, 1102, 2145, 2152, 3312); by "flocks," the goods of charity (n. 343, 2566); by "curtains," holy truths (n. 2576, 3478); by "vessels," truths of faith and memory-knowledges (n. 3068, 3079); by "camels," memory-knowledges in general (n. 3048, 3071, 3143, 3145). Thus by the "sons of the east" are signified those who are in these things, that is, who are in the knowledges of good and truth. [5] That the wise men from the east who came to Jesus at His birth were of those who were called the "sons of the east," is evident from the fact that they were in the knowledge that the Lord was to be born, and that they knew of His advent by a star which appeared to them in the east, concerning which things we read in Matthew:      When Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, behold there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is He that is born King of the Jews? for we have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him (Matt. 2:1-2). That from ancient times such a prophetic knowledge had existed among the sons of the east, who were of Syria, is evident from Balaam's prophecy concerning the Lord's advent, in Moses:      I see Him, but not now; I behold Him, but not nigh there shall arise a star out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise up out of Israel (Num. 24:17). That Balaam was from the land of the sons of the east, that is, from Syria, is evident from these words:      Balaam uttered his enunciation and said, Balak hath brought me from Syria, out of the mountains of the east (Num. 23:7). Those wise men who came to Jesus at His birth are called magi,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_102"></A><A HREF="#fn_102"><FONT SIZE="1">3762-1</FONT></A> but wise men were so called at that time, as is evident from many passages; such as Gen. 41:8; Exod. 7:11; Dan. 2:27; 4:6, 7; 1 Kings 4:30; and from the Prophets throughout. [6] That in the opposite sense the "sons of the east" signify the knowledges of evil and falsity, thus those who are in them, is evident in Isaiah:      The envy of Ephraim shall depart, and the enemies of Judah shall be cut off; they shall fly on the shoulder of the Philistines toward the sea; and together shall they spoil the sons of the east (Isa. 11:13-14). In Ezekiel:      Against the sons of Ammon. Behold I have delivered thee to the sons of the east for a possession, and they shall set their ordinances in thee (Ezek. 25:3-4). And in the book of Judges:      When Israel sowed, Midian came up, and Amalek, and the sons of the east; they came up against him (Judg. 6:3). "Midian" denotes those who are in falsity because not in the good of life (n. 3242); "Amalek," those who are in falsities with which they assault truths (n. 1679); the "sons of the east," those who are in the knowledges of falsity. </p>

<p>Verses 2, 3. And he saw, and behold a well in the field, and behold there three droves of the flock lying by it; for out of that well they watered the droves, and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. And all the droves were gathered together thither; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock, and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth. "And he saw" signifies perception; "and behold a well" signifies the Word; "in the field," signifies for the churches; "and behold there three droves of the flock lying by it," signifies the holy things of churches and of doctrinal things; "for out of that well they watered the droves," signifies that the memory-knowledge is thence derived; "and a great stone was upon the well's mouth" signifies that it was closed; "and all the droves were gathered together thither," signifies that all churches and their doctrinal things were thence derived; "and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth," signifies that they opened it; "and watered the flock," signifies that thence came doctrine; "and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth," signifies that meanwhile it was closed. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3764.">3764.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And he saw. That this signifies perception, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as being to perceive, concerning which below, at verse 32, when treating of Reuben, who was so named from "seeing." </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3765.">3765.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And behold a well. That this signifies the Word, is evident from the signification of a "well," as being the Word, and also doctrine from the Word (n. 2702, 3096, 3424). The Word is here called a well," because the natural is treated of, which regarded in itself apprehends the Word solely as to the literal sense; whereas the Word is called a "fountain" when the rational is treated of, by which the Word can be perceived according to the internal sense. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3766.">3766.</A></FONT></span>
<p>In the field. That this signifies for the churches, is evident from the signification of a "field," as being the church as to good (n. 2971). In the Word the church is signified by "land," "ground," and "field," but with a difference. The reason why "field" signifies the church, is that the church as a field receives the seeds of good and truth; for the church has the Word, from which come these seeds; and this is the reason why everything in a field signifies that which is of the church, such as sowing, reaping, standing corn, wheat, barley, and other things, and this also with a difference. </p>

<p>And behold there three droves of the flock lying by it. That this signifies the holy things of churches and of doctrinal things, is evident from the signification of "three," as being that which is holy (n. 720, 901); and from the signification of "droves of the flock," as being those things which are of the church, thus doctrinal things; specifically, a "flock" signifies those who are within the church, and who learn and become imbued with the goods which are of charity, and the truths which are of faith; and in this case a "shepherd" signifies one who teaches these things; but in general a "flock" signifies all those who are in good, thus who belong to the Lord's church in the universal world; and inasmuch as all these are introduced into good and truth by means of doctrinal things, therefore by a "flock" are also signified doctrinal things. For in the internal sense the things which determine the quality of a man, and the man himself who is of such a quality, are meant by the same expression; for the subject, which is man, is understood from that by virtue of which he is man. [2] For this reason it has been repeatedly stated that names signify actual things, and also signify those to whom such things appertain-as that "Tyre" and "Zidon" signify the knowledges of good and truth, and also those who are in such knowledges; and that "Egypt" signifies memory-knowledge, and "Asshur" reasoning, yet there are also understood those who are in these; and so with every other name. But the speech in heaven among the angels is effected by means of actual things, without the idea of persons; thus by universals; and this for the reason that in this way they comprise countless things in their discourse; and especially is this the case because they attribute all good and truth to the Lord, and nothing to themselves; the result of which is that the ideas of their speech are not determined to any but the Lord alone. From all this we can now see whence it is that a "flock" is said to signify churches, and also doctrinal things. Droves of a flock are said to be "lying by the well," because the doctrinal things are from the Word. (That a "well" denotes the Word, has been stated just above, n. 3765.) </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3768.">3768.</A></FONT></span>
<p>For out of that well they watered the droves. That this signifies that the memory-knowledge is thence derived-that is, from the Word-is evident from the signification of a "well," as being the Word (n. 3765); and from the signification of "watering," or "giving to drink," as being to be instructed (n. 3069); and from the signification of "droves" as being the memory-knowledge of doctrinal things (see n. 3767). Hence it is evident that by "watering the droves out of the well" is signified that the memory-knowledge of the doctrinal things of good and truth is from the Word. In what now follows concerning Jacob, the Lord is treated of in the supreme sense-how He made His natural Divine, and in this chapter the initiation is treated of; and in the internal representative sense those who are being regenerated are treated of-how the Lord renews their natural man, and in this chapter the initiation is treated of; therefore the subject here treated of is the Word and the doctrine thence derived; for initiation and regeneration are effected by means of doctrine from the Word. And inasmuch as these things are signified by a "well" and by "three droves of the flock," therefore these are mentioned historically, which would have been of too trifling import to be mentioned in the Divine Word unless they had signified such things. What they enfold is evident, namely, that all the memory-knowledge and doctrine of good and truth are from the Word. [2] The natural man can indeed know, and also perceive, what good and truth are, but only natural and civic good and truth; but spiritual good and truth he cannot know, because this must come from revelation, thus from the Word. For example: a man may know from the rational that is possessed by everyone that his neighbor ought to be loved, and that God ought to be worshiped; but how the neighbor is to be loved, and how God is to be worshiped, thus what spiritual good and truth are, can be known only from the Word-as that good itself is the neighbor, consequently they who are in good, and this according to the good in which they are; and that good is the neighbor because the Lord is in good, and therefore in the love of good the Lord is loved.  [3] In like manner they who have not the Word cannot know that all good is from the Lord, and that it inflows with man, and causes the affection of good, and that this affection is called charity; neither can they who have not the Word know who is the God of the universe; and that He is the Lord is hidden from them; when yet the inmost of affection or of charity, consequently the inmost of good, must look to Him. From this it is evident what spiritual good is, and that this cannot be known except from the Word. With regard to the Gentiles, so long as they are in the world they indeed do not know this, nevertheless while they live in mutual charity with one another, they thence derive such a capacity that in the other life they can be instructed concerning such matters, and they also easily receive and become imbued therewith. (See n. 2589-2604.) </p>

<p>And a great stone was upon the well's mouth. That this signifies that the Word was closed, is evident without explication. The Word is said to be closed when it is understood solely as to the sense of the letter, and when all that is in this sense is taken for doctrine. And it is still more closed when those things are acknowledged as doctrinal things which favor the cupidities of the love of self and of the world; for these especially roll a great stone upon the mouth of the well, that is, close up the Word; and then mankind do not know, neither do they desire to know, that there is any interior sense in the Word, when yet they may see this from many passages where the sense of the letter is unfolded as to the interior sense; and also from the doctrinal things received in the church, to which by various explications they refer all the sense of the letter of the Word.  [2] What is meant by the Word being closed may be seen especially from the Jews, who explain each and all things according to the letter, and thence believe that they are chosen in preference to all nations on the face of the earth, and that the Messiah will come to bring them into the land of Canaan and exalt them above all nations and peoples of the earth; for they are immersed in earthly corporeal loves, which are such that they altogether close up the Word as to interior things. Therefore also they do not yet know whether there is any heavenly kingdom, whether they shall live after death, what the internal man is, nor even that there is anything spiritual; still less do they know that the Messiah has come to save souls. That the Word is closed with them, may be sufficiently evident also from the fact that although they live among Christians, they do not receive the least of their doctrinal things-according to the following words in Isaiah:      Say to this people, Hearing, hear ye, and do not understand; and seeing, see ye, and do not perceive. Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and blind their eyes. And I said, Lord, how long? And He said, Until the cities be waste without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the ground be wasted to a solitude (Isa. 6:9-11; Matt. 13:14-15; John 12:40-41). [3] For insofar as a man is immersed in loves of self and of the world, and in the cupidities of these loves, so far the Word is closed to him; for these loves have self as their end, which end kindles a natural lumen, but extinguishes heavenly light, so that men sharply see the things of self and the world, but not at all those of the Lord and His kingdom; and when this is the case, they may indeed read the Word, but it is with the end of acquiring honors and riches, or for the sake of appearance, or from the love and consequent habit of it, or from piety, and yet not from a purpose of amending the life. To such persons the Word is in various ways closed; to some so much that by no means are they willing to know anything but what their doctrinal things dictate, whatever these may be.  [4] For example: should anyone say that the power of opening and shutting heaven was not given to Peter, but to the faith of love, which faith is signified by Peter's keys, inasmuch as the love of self and of the world opposes this, they will by no means acknowledge it. And should anyone say that saints ought not to be worshiped, but the Lord alone, neither do they receive this. Or if anyone should say that by the bread and wine in the Holy Supper is meant the Lord's love toward the universal human race, and the reciprocal love of man to the Lord, this they do not believe. Or should anyone assert that faith is of no avail unless it is the good of faith, that is, charity, this they explain inversely; and so with everything else. They who are of this character cannot see one whit of the truth that is in the Word, nor are they willing to see it, but abide obstinately in their own dogma; and are not even willing to hear that there is an internal sense wherein is the sanctity and glory of the Word, and even when they are told that it is so, from their aversion thereto they loathe the bare mention of it. Thus has the Word been closed, when yet it is of such a nature as to lie open even into heaven, and through heaven to the Lord, and it is closed solely in relation to man, insofar as he is in the evils of the love of self and of the world in respect to his ends of life, and in the consequent principles of falsity. From this it is evident what is signified by a great stone being upon the well's mouth. </p>

<p>And all the droves were gathered together thither. That this signifies that all churches and their doctrinal things are thence derived, is evident from the signification of "droves," as being churches, and also the doctrinal things that belong to churches (concerning which see n. 3767, 3768). That these are from the Word is signified by the droves being gathered together thither. </p>

<p>And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth. That this signifies that they opened it, is evident from what has been said above (n. 3769) concerning the signification of a "great stone upon the well's mouth," as being that the Word was closed. Thus it is manifest that their rolling the stone from the well's mouth signifies that they opened it. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3772.">3772.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And watered the flock. That this signifies that the doctrine was thence derived, is evident from the signification of "watering," or of "giving to drink," as being to instruct (see n. 3069, 3768); and from the signification of a "flock," as being those who are in the goods and truths of faith (n. 343, 3767). Thus "to water the flock" is to instruct out of the Word, consequently it is doctrine. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3773.">3773.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth. That this signifies that meanwhile it was closed, is evident from what has been said (n. 3769, 3771) concerning the stone upon the well's mouth. As regards the Word being opened to the churches, and being afterwards closed, the case is this: in the beginning of the setting up of any church, the Word is at first closed to the men of it, and is afterwards opened, the Lord so providing; and thus they learn that all doctrine is founded on the two commandments-that the Lord is to be loved above all things, and the neighbor as themselves. When these two commandments are regarded as the end, the Word is opened; for all the Law and the Prophets, that is, the whole Word, so depend on these commandments that all things are derived from them and therefore all have reference to them. And whereas the men of the church are then in the principles of truth and good, they are enlightened in everything they see in the Word; for the Lord is then present with them by means of angels, and teaches them (although they are unaware of this), and also leads them into the life of truth and good.  [2] This may be seen also from the case of all churches, in that they were such in their infancy, and worshiped the Lord from love, and loved the neighbor from the heart. But in process of time churches withdraw from these two commandments, and turn aside from the good of love and charity to the so-called things of faith, thus from life to doctrine; and insofar as they do this, so far the Word is closed. This is what is signified in the internal sense by the words: "Behold a well in the field, and behold there three-droves of the flock lying by it; for out of that well they watered the droves; and a great stone was upon the well's mouth. And all the droves were gathered together thither; and they rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock, and they put the stone in its place again upon the well's mouth." </p>

<p>Verses 4-6. And Jacob said unto them, My brethren whence are ye? And they said, Of Haran are we. And he said unto them, Know ye Laban, the son of Nahor? And they said, We know him. And he said unto them, Hath he peace? And they said, Peace; and behold Rachel his daughter cometh with the flock. "And Jacob said unto them," signifies the truth of good; "My brethren whence are ye?" signifies what is the origin of the charity? "And they said, We are from Haran" signifies from the good of a common stock; and he said unto them, "Know ye Laban the son of Nahor?" signifies have they the good of this stock? "And they said, We know him," signifies affirmation; "and he said unto them, Hath he peace?" signifies, is not this good from the Lord's kingdom? "And they said, Peace," signifies affirmation; "and behold Rachel his daughter," signifies the affection of interior truth; "cometh with the flock," signifies interior doctrinal things. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3775.">3775.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Jacob said unto them. That this signifies the truth of good, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the Lord's Divine natural, concerning which see above. Inasmuch as all things in general and particular, wherever they may be, have relation to good and truth (see above, n. 3166, 3513, 3519), so also have those in the natural; and because during man's regeneration the good and truth in the natural are at first in a different state from what they are during the progress and at the end of it, therefore by Jacob is represented the natural as to truth and good according to the state at the time, here, in respect to the truth of good. But to explain in detail these various things in every case would be to render the subject obscure, especially with those who have not a distinct idea concerning truth and good, and still less concerning the truth through which is good, and the truth which is from good. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3776.">3776.</A></FONT></span>
<p>My brethren whence are ye? That this signifies, What is the origin of the charity? is evident from the signification of "brethren," as being those who are in good, and thence as being good itself, consequently charity (see n. 367, 2360, 3303, 3459); and from the signification of "whence are ye?" as being from what origin is it? All this shows that whatever in the sense of the letter involves a question and is determined to persons, in the internal sense falls into an idea undetermined to any person; for in heaven among the angels the historicals of the letter vanish when they leave man and enter heaven; so that Jacob's question to the men of Haran, "My brethren whence are ye?" signifies charity there, from what origin is it? [2] The case herein is as follows: The charity the external form of which appears as charity is not always charity in the internal form. Its quality and its source are known from its end. The charity that comes from a selfish or worldly end in its internal form is not charity, neither ought it to be called charity; but the charity that regards as its end the neighbor, the general good, heaven, and thus the Lord, is real charity, and has within it the affection of doing good from the heart, and the derivative delight of life which in the other life becomes bliss. It is of the utmost importance to know this, in order that man may know what the Lord's kingdom is in itself. Inquiry concerning this charity, or what is the same thing, concerning this good, is now treated of in these verses; and here it is first asked from what origin was the charity there; which is signified by, "My brethren whence are ye?" </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3777.">3777.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And they said, Of Haran are we. That this signifies from the good of a common stock, is evident from the signification of "Haran," as being the collateral good of a common stock (n. 3612). </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3778.">3778.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And he said unto them, Know ye Laban, the son of Nahor? That this signifies, Have they the good of this stock? is evident from the representation of Laban, as being the collateral good of a common stock (see n. 3612, 3665); and from the representation of Nahor, as being that common stock from which is the good represented by Laban; that "to know," in the internal sense signifies to be therefrom, is manifest from the series. How the case is with the representation of collateral good by Nahor, Bethuel, and Laban, shall be briefly stated. Terah, who was the father of three sons-Abram, Nahor, and Haran (Gen. 11:27), represents the common stock from which come churches. Terah himself was indeed an idolater, but representatives do not regard the person but the thing (n. 1361). And because the representative Jewish Church commenced in Abraham, and was renewed among his descendants from Jacob, therefore Terah and his three sons put on the representation of churches-Abram the representation of a genuine church, such as exists with those who have the Word; but Nahor his brother the representation of a church such as exists among the Gentiles who have not the Word. That the Lord's church is scattered throughout the universal earth, and that it exists among those Gentiles also who live in charity, is manifest from what has been shown here and there concerning the Gentiles.  [2] This therefore is the reason why by Nahor, his son Bethuel, and Bethuel's son Laban, there is represented the collateral good of a common stock, that is, the good in which they are who are of the Lord's church among the Gentiles. This good differs from the good of a common stock in the direct line of descent, in this respect-that the truths which are conjoined with their good are not genuine, but most of them are external appearances which are called fallacies of the senses; for these Gentiles have not the Word whereby they can be enlightened. In its essence indeed good is only one, but it receives its quality from the truths implanted in it, and thereby becomes various. The truths that to the Gentiles appear as truths are in general that they should worship some God from whom they seek their good and to whom they attribute it, and so long as they live in the world they do not know that this God is the Lord; also that they should adore their God under images, which they account holy; besides many other things. Nevertheless these things are no hindrance to their being saved equally with Christians, provided they live in love to their God and in love toward the neighbor; for thus in the other life they have a capacity to receive interior truths (see n. 932, 1032, 1059, 2049, 2051, 2284, 2589-2604, 2861, 2863, 3263). This shows what is here meant by the collateral good of a common stock. That by Nahor are represented those out of the church who are in brotherhood by virtue of good, may be seen above (n. 2863, 2866, 2868); that by Bethuel is represented the good of the Gentiles of the first class (n. 2865, 3665); and by Laban the affection of external or corporeal good, and properly the collateral good of a common stock (n. 3612, 3665). [3] With this good the case is that first of all it serves man as a means of procuring for himself spiritual good, for it is external corporeal, and is grounded in external appearances which in themselves are fallacies of the senses. In childhood man acknowledges nothing else as truth and good, and although he is taught what internal good and truth are, still he has no other idea concerning them than a corporeal one; and because such is the first idea, therefore such good and truth are the first means by which interior truths and goods are introduced. This is the arcanum which is here represented by Jacob and Laban. </p>

<p>And they said, We know him. That this signifies affirmation, may be seen without explication. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3780.">3780.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And he said into them, Hath he peace? That this signifies, Is not this good from the Lord's kingdom? is evident from the signification of "peace," concerning which in what follows. In the historical sense inquiry is made concerning Laban, as to whether he hath peace, but in the internal sense the inquiry is concerning the good which is represented by Laban. That Laban represents the collateral good of a common stock, that is, such good as exists among the Gentiles, who are in the general church, that is, in the Lord's kingdom, may be seen just above (n. 3778). From this it is evident what is signified by the words, "Is not this good from the Lord's kingdom?" [2] In regard to peace, in the supreme sense it signifies the Lord Himself, and hence in the internal sense His kingdom, and it is the Lord's Divine inmostly affecting the good in which are those who are therein. That these things are signified in the Word by "peace," is evident from many passages; as in Isaiah:      Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given and the government shall be upon His shoulder and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, God, Hero, Father of Eternity, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon His kingdom (Isa. 9:6-7); where the "Prince of Peace" manifestly denotes the Lord; and "the increase of His government and peace" denotes the things which are in His kingdom, thus His kingdom itself. Again:      The work of righteousness shall be peace, and the labor of righteousness quietness and security for ever; and My people shall dwell in a habitation of peace (Isa. 32:17-18); in which passage the Lord's kingdom is treated of, where peace, quietness, and security succeed each other; a "habitation of peace" denotes heaven. [3] Again:      The angels of peace weep bitterly; the paths are laid waste, the way- faring man hath ceased (Isa. 33:7-8);  "angels of peace" denote those who are in the Lord's kingdom, thus that kingdom itself, and in the supreme sense the Lord; the "paths being laid waste, and the wayfaring man ceasing," signifies that there is no longer truth anywhere. (That "paths" and "ways" are truths, see above, n. 627, 2333). Again:      How delightful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that saith unto Zion, Thy God&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_103"></A><A HREF="#fn_103"><FONT SIZE="1">3780-1</FONT></A> reigneth (Isa. 52:7); where "he that bringeth good tidings and publisheth peace" denotes the Lord's kingdom. Again:      The mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but My mercy shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of My peace be removed (Isa. 54:10). Again:      The way of peace have they not known; and there is no judgment in their tracks (Isa. 59:8). In Jeremiah:      I will take away My peace from this people, saith Jehovah, even compassion and mercy (Jer. 16:5). [4] Again:      The folds of peace are laid waste, because of the burning of the anger of Jehovah (Jer. 25:37). Again:      The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_104"></A><A HREF="#fn_104"><FONT SIZE="1">3780-2</FONT></A> shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that Jehovah hath sent him (Jer. 28:9). Again:      I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith Jehovah, thoughts of peace (Jer. 29:11). So in Haggai:      The glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former; for in this place will I give peace (Hag. 2:9). And in Zechariah:      They shall be a seed of peace; the vine shall give her fruit, and the earth shall give her increase, and the heavens shall give their dew (Zech. 8:12). In David:      Keep integrity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_105"></A><A HREF="#fn_105"><FONT SIZE="1">3780-3</FONT></A> and behold the upright, because the end for that man is peace (Ps. 37:37). In Luke:      Jesus saith to His disciples, Into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it; but if not, it shall turn to you again (Luke 10:5-6). In John:      Peace I leave with you, My peace I give unto you; not as the world giveth, give I unto you (John 14:27). Again:      Jesus said, These things have I spoken unto you that in Me ye may have peace (John 16:33). [5] In all these passages in the supreme sense "peace" signifies the Lord; and in the representative sense His kingdom, and good from the Lord therein, thus the Divine which flows into good, or into the affections of good, which also causes joy and happiness from the inmost. From this it is manifest what is meant by these words of the benediction:      Jehovah lift up His faces upon thee and give thee peace (Num. 6:26); and what by the salutation used of old, "Peace be unto you;" and the same addressed by the Lord to the apostles (John 20:19, 21, 26). See also what is said concerning peace elsewhere (n. 92, 93, 1726, 2780, 3170, 3696). </p>

<p>Verses 7, 8. And he said, Behold as yet the day is great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together: water ye the flock, and go and feed them. And they said, We cannot until all the droves are gathered together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth; then shall we water the flock. "And he said, Behold as yet the day is great," signifies that now the state was advancing; "it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together," signifies that the goods and truths of the churches and of doctrinal things could not as yet be gathered into a one; "water ye the flock and go and feed them," signifies instruction therefrom to a few; "and they said, We cannot until all the droves are gathered together," signifies that they ought to be together; "and they roll the stone from the well's mouth," signifies that thus the things of the Word are disclosed; "then shall we water the flock," signifies that then they are instructed. </p>

<p>And he said, Behold as yet the day is great. That this signifies that the state was now advancing, is evident from the signification of "day," as being state (n. 23, 487, 488, 493, 893, 2788, 3462); that "Behold as yet it is great," denotes that it is advancing, is manifest from the series. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3786.">3786.</A></FONT></span>
<p>It is not time for the cattle to be gathered together. That this signifies that the goods and truths of the churches and of doctrinal things could not yet be gathered into a one, is evident from the signification of "time," as being state in general (n. 2625, 2788, 2837, 3254, 3356); from the signification of "being gathered together," as being to be in a one; and from the signification of "cattle," as being in general the goods and truths of churches and of doctrinal things. That "cattle" in general have this signification, is because in the rituals of the representative church, and in the Word, animals signify the affections of good or of truth; as may be seen from what has been shown above (n. 45, 46, 142, 143, 246, 714, 715, 2679, 2697, 2979, 3203, 3502, 3508, 3510, 3665, 3699, 3701). [2] The case is the same in general with the church when it is being set up again-the doctrinal things of good and truth must be collected into a one, for it is on these that it is built. Moreover doctrinal things have a connection with and mutual respect to each other, and therefore unless they are first collected into a one, there will be a defect, and that which is lacking must be supplied by man's rational; and how blind and illusory this is in spiritual and Divine things, when its conclusions are from itself, has been abundantly shown above. For this reason there has been given to the church the Word, which contains all the doctrinal things of good and truth. In this regard, with a man who is being regenerated, the case is the same with the church in general as it is with the church in particular; for such a man is the church in particular. That the doctrinal things of good and truth which belong to the church must needs first be together in a man before he is regenerated has been shown above. This then is what is signified in the internal sense by "Behold as yet the day is great, it is not time for the cattle to be gathered together." </p>

<p>Water ye the flock, and go and feed them. That this signifies instruction therefrom to a few, is evident from the signification of "watering the flock," as being to instruct from the Word (n. 3772); and from the signification of the words, "go and feed them," as being the derivative life and doctrine. (That "to go" signifies life, see above, n. 3335, 3690; and that "to feed" signifies doctrine, see also above, n. 343, and in what follows.) The arcanum which here lies hidden is that there are few who ever arrive at a full state (concerning which state see above, n. 2636); thus who can be regenerated. </p>

<p>And they said, We cannot, until all the droves are gathered together. That this signifies that they ought to be together, is evident from the signification of "gathering," as being to be made into a one, that is, to be together, as above (n. 3786); and from the signification of "droves," as being doctrinal things (n. 3767, 3768). What these words imply may be seen from what was said above (n. 3786, 3787). </p>

<p>And they rolled the stone from the well's mouth. That this signifies that thus the things which are of the Word are disclosed, is evident from the signification of "rolling away the stone," as being to be disclosed (n. 3769, 3771, 3773); and from the signification of the "well," as being the Word (n. 3424, 3765). </p>

<p>Then shall we water the flock. That this signifies that in this case they are instructed, is evident from the signification of "watering the flock," as being to instruct (n. 3772, 3787). This is also manifest from what goes before. </p>

<p>Verses 9-11. While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with the flock which was her father's, for she was a shepherdess. And it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the flock of Laban his mother's brother, that Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother. And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice and wept. "While he was yet speaking with them," signifies thought on that occasion; "Rachel came with the flock," signifies the affection of the interior truth which is of the church and of doctrine; "which was her father's," signifies from good in respect to origin; "for she was a shepherdess," signifies that the affection of interior truth teaches what is in the Word; "and it came to pass when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother," signifies the acknowledgment of the affection of that truth in regard to its origin; "and the flock of Laban his mother's brother," signifies the church and the doctrine therefrom; "that Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth," signifies that the Lord from natural good has opened the Word as to its interiors; "and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother," signifies instruction; "and Jacob kissed Rachel," signifies love toward interior truths; "and lifted up his voice and wept," signifies the ardor of love. </p>

<p>While he was yet speaking with them. That this signifies thought on that occasion, is evident from the signification in the historicals of the Word of "to speak," as being to think (see n. 2271, 2287, 2619). That it signified thought on that occasion is manifest, because at the very time when he was speaking with them, or what is the same thing, "while he was yet speaking with them," Rachel came. </p>

<p>Rachel came with the flock. That this signifies the affection of the interior truth which is of the church and of doctrine, is evident from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior truth; and from the signification of a "flock," as being the church and also doctrine (n. 3767, 3768, 3783.) That it may be known how the case is with the representation of Rachel as being the affection of interior truth, and of Leah as being the affection of exterior truth, it shall be briefly stated that the natural which is represented by Jacob consists of good and truth, and that in this natural, as in all things of man and of universal nature in general and particular there must be the marriage of good and truth. Without this marriage nothing is produced-all production and all effect being therefrom. This marriage of good and truth, however, does not exist in man's natural when he is born, because man alone is not born into Divine order; he does indeed possess the good of innocence and of charity, which in his earliest infancy flows in from the Lord, but there is no truth with which this good may be coupled. As he advances in years, this good which in infancy had been insinuated into him by the Lord is drawn in toward the interiors, and is there kept by the Lord, in order that it may temper the states of life which he afterwards puts on. This is the reason why without the good of his infancy and first childhood man would be worse and more fierce than any wild beast. When this good of infancy is being drawn in, evil comes in its place and enters into man's natural, and with this evil falsity couples itself, and there takes place in the man the conjunction, and as it were the marriage, of evil and falsity. In order therefore that man may be saved, he must be regenerated, and evil must be removed, and good from the Lord insinuated, and according to the good which he receives, truth is insinuated into him, for the purpose of effecting the coupling, or as it were the marriage, of good and truth. [2] These are the things represented by Jacob, and by his two wives, Rachel and Leah. Jacob therefore now puts on the representation of the good of the natural, and Rachel the representation of truth; but as all the conjunction of truth with good is wrought by means of affection, it is the affection of truth to be coupled with good that is represented by Rachel. Moreover in the natural, as in the rational, there is an interior and an exterior; Rachel representing the affection of interior truth, and Leah the affection of exterior truth. Laban, who is their father, represents the good of a common stock, but the collateral good, as before stated; which good is that which in a collateral line corresponds to the truth of the rational, which is signified by "Rebekah" (see n. 3012, 3013, 3077). Hence the daughters from this good represent the affections in the natural, for these are as daughters from this good as from a father. And as these affections are to be coupled with natural good, they represent the affections of truth; the one the affection of interior truth, and the other the affection of exterior truth.  [3] As regards the regeneration of man in respect to his natural, the case is altogether the same as it is with Jacob and the two daughters of Laban, Rachel and Leah; and therefore whoever is able to see and apprehend the Word here according to its internal sense, sees this arcanum disclosed to him. But no one can see this except the man who is in good and truth. Whatever perception others may have of things therein relating to moral and civic life, and however intelligent they may thereby appear, still they can see nothing of this nature so as to acknowledge it; for they do not know what good and truth are, but suppose evil to be good and falsity to be truth; and therefore the moment that good is mentioned, the idea of evil is presented; and when truth is mentioned, the idea of falsity; consequently they perceive nothing of these contents of the internal sense, but as soon as they hear them darkness appears and extinguishes the light. </p>

<p>Which was her father's. That this signifies from good in respect to origin, is evident from the representation of Laban, who here is the "father," as being the collateral good of a common stock (see n. 3612, 3665, 3778); and also from the signification of "father," as being good (n. 3703). </p>

<p>For she was a shepherdess (or, "she was one who feeds.") That this signifies that the affection of interior truth teaches what is in the Word, is evident from the signification of a "shepherd," or one that feeds the flock, as being one who leads and teaches (n. 343); and from the representation of Rachel, who in the present case is "she," as being the affection of interior truth (concerning which just above, n. 3793). The reason this teaching is said to be from the Word is that she came to the well with the flock; and that the "well" signifies the Word may be seen above (n. 3765). Moreover it is the affection of interior truth which teaches; for from this affection the church is a church, and a shepherd or pastor is a pastor. The reason why in the Word a "shepherd," and "one that feeds" signifies those who lead and teach, is that a "flock" signifies those who are led and taught, consequently churches, and also doctrines of the church (n. 3767, 3768, 3783). That a "shepherd" and a "flock" have such a signification is well known in the Christian world, for so they who teach and they who learn are called, and therefore it is needless to confirm this from the Word. </p>

<p>And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother's brother. That this signifies the acknowledgment of the affection of that truth in regard to its origin, is evident from the signification of "seeing," as here being to acknowledge, as is evident from the series or connection; and from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior truth (see n. 3793). "The daughter of Laban, his mother's brother" implies its origin, namely, that it was from collateral good, which was joined in brotherhood with the rational truth represented by Rebekah, the mother of Jacob. [2] As regards the affections of truth and of good the case is this: The genuine affections of truth and of good which are perceived by man are all from a Divine origin, because from the Lord; but on the way, as they descend, they diverge into various and diverse streams, and there form for themselves new origins; for as they flow into affections not genuine but spurious, and into the affections of evil and falsity in the man, so are they varied. In the external form these affections often present themselves like the genuine ones; but in the internal form they are of this spurious character. The sole characteristic from which they are known is their end; if as regards their end they are for the sake of self or the world, then these affections are not genuine; but if as regards their end they are for the sake of the good of the neighbor, the good of societies, the good of our country, and especially if for the good of the church and the good of the Lord's kingdom, then they are genuine, because in this case they are for the sake of the Lord, inasmuch as the Lord is in these goods.  [3] It is therefore the part of a wise man to know the ends that are in him. Sometimes it appears as if his ends were for self when yet they are not so; for it is the nature of man to reflect upon himself in everything, and this from custom and habit. But if anyone desires to know the ends that are within him, let him merely pay attention to the delight he perceives in himself from the praise and glory of self, and to the delight he perceives from use separate from self; if he perceives this latter delight, he is in genuine affection. He must also pay attention to the various states in which he is, for the states themselves very much vary the perception. A man can explore these things in himself, but not in others; for the ends of each man's affection are known to the Lord alone. This is the reason why the Lord said:      Judge not, that ye be not judged; condemn not, that ye be not condemned (Luke 6:37); for a thousand persons may appear to be in a like affection in respect to truth and good, and yet every one of them be in an affection unlike in respect to origin, that is, in respect to end.  [4] That the end determines the quality of the affection, that is to say, whether it is genuine, spurious, or false, is because a man's end is his very life; for a man has that for his end which is of his life, or what is the same, of his love. When the good of his neighbor, the general good, the good of the church and of the Lord's kingdom, is the end, then as to his soul the man is in the Lord's kingdom, thus in the Lord; for the Lord's kingdom is nothing else than a kingdom of ends and uses for the good of the human race (see n. 3645). The angels themselves who are with man are solely in his ends. Insofar as a man is in such an end as that in which is the Lord's kingdom, so far the angels are delighted with him, and conjoin themselves with him as with a brother; but insofar as a man is in the end of self, so far the angels retire, and evil spirits from hell draw near, for there reigns in hell no other end than this; from all of which we can see how important it is to explore and know from what origin the affections are, and this can be known solely from the end. </p>

<p>And the flock of Laban, his mother's brother. That this signifies the church and the doctrine therefrom, is evident from the signification of a "flock," as being the church and doctrine (n. 3767, 3768, 3783). The reason why Laban is here called "his mother's brother," is that thereby is likewise signified an acknowledgment in respect to the origin, as stated just above. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3798.">3798.</A></FONT></span>
<p>That Jacob came near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth. That this signifies that the Lord from natural good uncovered the Word as to things interior, is evident from the representation of Jacob, as being the Lord's Divine natural, as before shown, here, in respect to the good therein; and from the signification of "rolling the stone from the well's mouth," as being to uncover the Word in respect to its interiors (n. 3769, 3771, 3773, 3789). The reason why the supreme internal sense here is that the Lord from natural good uncovered the Word as to its interiors, is that Jacob here represents good in the natural; for Jacob puts on the representation of good, because now truth was to be adjoined thereto by means of the affection which Rachel represents (see just above, n. 3775, 3793); and because it is from good that the Word is uncovered in respect to its interiors (n. 3773). That it is from good that the Word is uncovered is very manifest, because it is from the love in which each man is that he sees the things which are of that love, and that which he sees he calls truths, because they are in agreement with that love. There is in each man's love the light of his life, for love is like a flame from which light issues; such therefore as is the love or flame, such is the man's light of truth. They who are in the love of good can see that which is of this love, consequently the truths that are in the Word, and this in accordance with the amount and the quality of their love of good; for in this case light or intelligence flows in from heaven, that is, through heaven from the Lord. For this reason it is that as before said no one can see and acknowledge the interiors of the Word unless he is in good as to life. </p>

<p>And watered the flock of Laban, his mother's brother. That this signifies instruction, is evident from the signification of "watering the flock," as being instruction (concerning which see above, n. 3772). The reason why Laban is here a third time called "his mother's brother," is that the origin is pointed out from which came the flock and Rachel, that is to say, from which come the doctrine and the affection of interior truth. </p>
<span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><a name="3800.">3800.</A></FONT></span>
<p>And Jacob kissed Rachel. That this signifies love toward interior truths, is evident from the signification of "kissing," as being unition and conjunction from affection (concerning which see above, n. 3573, 3574), consequently love, because regarded in itself love is unition and conjunction from affection; and from the representation of Rachel, as being the affection of interior truth (n. 3793). Hence it is evident that by "Jacob kissed Rachel," is signified love toward interior truths. </p>
