### PART V.

BENEATH nature and the ideal world is placed the pyramid. Its corner
stone, placed on its summit, is the Creative Word of the universal Lord,
which, after Him, is the first Power, uncreate, infinite, begotten of
Him and antecedent to all His creations. He is the offspring of the Most
Perfect, the fruitful and true Son. The nature of this intelligent Word
is a generating and productive nature. Call it as thou wilt--generation,
or nature, or character. But think this only, that he is perfect in the
Perfect, and issued from the Perfect, that all his works are perfectly
good, and that he is the source of creation and of life. Since such is
his nature, he is well named.

.         .         .         .         .

But for the providence of the Lord of the universe Who causes me to
reveal these words, you would not have so great a desire to seek out
such matters. Now, therefore, hear the end of this discourse. This
Spirit of whom I have so often spoken is necessary to all; for he
maintains all, he gives life to all, he nourishes all. He outflows from
the holy Source, and without ceasing comes to the aid of spirits and to
all living creatures.
