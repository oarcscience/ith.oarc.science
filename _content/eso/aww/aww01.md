TO

MRS. G. H. LEWIS

*Dear Mrs. Lewis*,

*This little book were not worthy of being associated with your name,
did it not offer an ideal of life at once refined and practical,
cultured yet wisely energetic. Gracian points to noble aims, and
proposes, on the whole, no ignoble means of attaining to them. The
Spanish Jesuit sees clear, but he looks upward*.

*There is, however, one side of life to which he is entirely blind, as
was perhaps natural in an ecclesiastic writing before the Age of Salons.
He nowhere makes mention in his pages of the gracious influence of Woman
as Inspirer and Consoler in the Battle of Life. Permit me to repair this
omission by placing your name in the forefront of this English version
of his maxims. To those honoured with your friendship this will by
itself suffice to recall all the ennobling associations connected with
your sex*.

*Believe me, dear Mrs. Lewis*,

    *Yours most sincerely*,

        *JOSEPH JACOBS*.

 

KILBURN, 26*th* *October* 1892.
