<p align="center">i <i>Everything is at its Acme</i>;</p>  
<p>especially the art of making one's way in the world. There is more required nowadays to make a single wise man than formerly to make Seven Sages, and more is needed nowadays to deal with a single person than was required with a whole people in former times.</p>  
<p align="center">ii <i>Character and Intellect</i>:</p>  
<p>the two poles of our capacity; one without the other is but halfway to happiness. Intellect sufficeth not, character is also needed. On the other hand, it is the fool's misfortune, to fail in obtaining the position, the employment, the neighbourhood, and the circle of friends that suit him.</p>  
<p><a name="page_2"><font size="1" color="green">p. 2</font></A></p>  
<p align="center">iii <i>Keep Matters for a Time in Suspense</i>.</p>  
<p>Admiration at their novelty heightens the value of your achievements, It is both useless and insipid to play with the cards on the table. If you do not declare yourself immediately, you arouse expectation, especially when the importance of your position makes you the object of general attention. Mix a little mystery with everything, and the very mystery arouses veneration. And when you explain, be not too explicit, just as you do not expose your inmost thoughts in ordinary intercourse. Cautious silence is the holy of holies of worldly wisdom. A resolution declared is never highly thought of; it only leaves room for criticism. And if it happens to fail, you are doubly unfortunate. Besides you imitate the Divine way when you cause men to wonder and watch.</p>  
<p align="center">iv <i>Knowledge and Courage</i></p>  
<p>are the elements of Greatness. They give immortality, because they are immortal. Each is as much as he knows, and the wise can do anything. A man without knowledge, a world without light. Wisdom and strength, eyes and hands. Knowledge without courage is sterile.</p>  
<p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="green">p. 3</font></A></p>  
<p align="center">v <i>Create a Feeling of Dependence</i>.</p>  
<p>Not he that adorns but he that adores makes a divinity. The wise man would rather see men needing him than thanking him. To keep them on the threshold of hope is diplomatic, to trust to their gratitude boorish; hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one. More is to be got from dependence than from courtesy. He that has satisfied his thirst turns his back on the well, and the orange once sucked falls from the golden platter into the waste-basket. When dependence disappears, good behaviour goes with it as well as respect. Let it be one of the chief lessons of experience to keep hope alive without entirely satisfying it, by preserving it to make oneself always needed even by a patron on the throne. But let not silence be carried to excess lest you go wrong, nor let another's failing grow incurable for the sake of your own advantage.</p>  
<p align="center">vi <i>A Man at his Highest Point</i>.</p>  
<p>We are not born perfect: every day we develop in our personality and in our calling till we reach the highest point of our completed being, to the full round of our accomplishments, of our excellences. This is known by the</p>  
<p><a name="page_4"><font size="1" color="green">p. 4</font></A></p>  
<p>purity of our taste, the clearness of our thought, the maturity of our judgment, and the firmness of our will. Some never arrive at being complete; somewhat is always awanting: others ripen late. The complete man, wise in speech, prudent in act, is admitted to the familiar intimacy of discreet persons, is even sought for by them.</p>  
<p align="center">vii <i>Avoid Victories over Superiors</i>.</p>  
<p>All victories breed hate, and that over your superior is foolish or fatal. Superiority is always detested, <i>&agrave; fortiori</i> superiority over superiority. Caution can gloss over common advantages; for example, good looks may be cloaked by careless attire. There be some that will grant you precedence in good luck or good temper, but none in good sense, least of all a prince; for good sense is a royal prerogative, any claim to that is a case of <i>l&egrave;se majest&eacute;</i>. They are princes, and wish to be so in that most princely of qualities. They will allow a man to help them but not to surpass them, and will have any advice tendered them appear like a recollection of something they have forgotten rather than as a guide to something they cannot find. The stars teach us this finesse with happy tact; though they are his</p>  
<p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></A></p>  
<p>children and brilliant like him, they never rival the brilliancy of the sun.</p>  
<p align="center">viii <i>To be without Passions</i>.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis a privilege of the highest order of mind. Their very eminence redeems them from being affected by transient and low impulses. There is no higher rule than that over oneself, over one's impulses: there is the triumph of free will. While passion rules the character, no aiming at high office; the less the higher. It is the only refined way of avoiding scandals; nay, &#8217;tis the shortest way back to good repute.</p>  
<p align="center">ix <i>Avoid the Faults of your Nation</i>.</p>  
<p>Water shares the good or bad qualities of the strata through which it flows, and man those of the climate in which he is born. Some owe more than others to their native land, because there is a more favourable sky in the zenith. There is not a nation even among the most civilised that has not some fault peculiar to itself which other nations blame by way of boast or as a warning. &#8217;Tis a triumph of cleverness to correct in oneself such national failings, or even to hide them: you get great credit for being unique among your</p>  
<p><a name="page_6"><font size="1" color="green">p. 6</font></A></p>  
<p>fellows, and as it is less expected of you it is esteemed the more. There are also family failings as well as faults of position, of office or of age. If these all meet in one person and are not carefully guarded against, they make an intolerable monster.</p>  
<p align="center">x <i>Fortune and Fame</i>.</p>  
<p>Where the one is fickle the other is enduring. The first for life, the second afterwards; the one against envy, the other against oblivion. Fortune is desired, at times assisted: fame is earned. The desire for fame springs from man's best part. It was and is the sister of the giants; it always goes to extremes&#8212;horrible monsters or brilliant prodigies.</p>  
<p align="center">xi <i>Cultivate those who can teach you</i>.</p>  
<p>Let friendly intercourse be a school of knowledge, and culture be taught through conversation: thus you make your friends your teachers and mingle the pleasures of conversation with the advantages of instruction. Sensible persons thus enjoy alternating pleasures: they reap applause for what they say, and gain instruction from what they hear. We are always attracted to others by our own interest,</p>  
<p><a name="page_7"><font size="1" color="green">p. 7</font></A></p>  
<p>but in this case it is of a higher kind. Wise men frequent the houses of great noblemen not because they are temples of vanity, but as theatres of good breeding. There be gentlemen who have the credit of worldly wisdom, because they are not only themselves oracles of all nobleness by their example and their behaviour, but those who surround them form a well-bred academy of worldly wisdom of the best and noblest kind.</p>  
<p align="center">xii <i>Nature and Art</i>:</p>  
<p>material and workmanship. There is no beauty unadorned and no excellence that would not become barbaric if it were not supported by artifice: this remedies the evil and improves the good. Nature scarcely ever gives us the very best; for that we must have recourse to art. Without this the best of natural dispositions is uncultured, and half is lacking to any excellence if training is absent. Every one has something unpolished without artificial training, and every kind of excellence needs some polish.</p>  
<p align="center">xiii <i>Act sometimes on Second Thoughts, sometimes on First Impulse</i>.</p>  
<p>Man's life is a warfare against the malice of</p>  
<p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></A></p>  
<p>men. Sagacity fights with strategic changes of intention: it never does what it threatens, it aims only at escaping notice. It aims in the air with dexterity and strikes home in an unexpected direction, always seeking to conceal its game. It lets a purpose appear in order to attract the opponent's attention, but then turns round and conquers by the unexpected. But a penetrating intelligence anticipates this by watchfulness and lurks in ambush. It always understands the opposite of what the opponent wishes it to understand, and recognises every feint of guile. It lets the first impulse pass by and waits for the second, or even the third. Sagacity now rises to higher flights on seeing its artifice foreseen, and tries to deceive by truth itself, changes its game in order to change its deceit, and cheats by not cheating, and founds deception on the greatest candour. But the opposing intelligence is on guard with increased watchfulness, and discovers the darkness concealed by the light and deciphers every move, the more subtle because more simple. In this way the guile of the Python combats the far darting rays of Apollo.</p>  
<p align="center">xiv <i>The Thing Itself and the Way it is done</i>.</p>  
<p>"Substance" is not enough: "accident"</p>  
<p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></A></p>  
<p>is also required, as the scholastics say. A bad manner spoils everything, even reason and justice; a good one supplies everything, gilds a No, sweetens truth, and adds a touch of beauty to old age itself. The <i>how</i> plays a large part in affairs, a good manner steals into the affections. Fine behaviour is a joy in life, and a pleasant expression helps out of a difficulty in a remarkable way.</p>  
<p align="center">xv <i>Keep Ministering Spirit</i>s.</p>  
<p>It is a privilege of the mighty to surround themselves with the champions of intellect; these extricate them from every fear of ignorance, these worry out for them the moot points of every difficulty. &#8217;Tis a rare greatness to make use of the wise, and far exceeds the barbarous taste of Tigranes, who had a fancy for captive monarchs as his servants. It is a novel kind of supremacy, the best that life can offer, to have as servants by skill those who by nature are our masters. &#8217;Tis a great thing to know, little to live: no real life without knowledge. There is remarkable cleverness in studying without study, in getting much by means of many, and through them all to become wise. Afterwards you speak in the council chamber on behalf of many, and as many sages speak through your</p>  
<p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></A></p>  
<p>mouth as were consulted beforehand: you thus obtain the fame of an oracle by others' toil. Such ministering spirits distil the best books and serve up the quintessence of wisdom. But he that cannot have sages in service should have them for his friends.</p>  
<p align="center">xvi <i>Knowledge and Good Intentions</i></p>  
<p>together ensure continuance of success. A fine intellect wedded to a wicked will was always an unnatural monster. A wicked will envenoms all excellences: helped by knowledge it only ruins with greater subtlety. &#8217;Tis a miserable superiority that only results in ruin. Knowledge without sense is double folly.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center">xvii <i>Vary the Mode of Action</i>;</p>  
<p>not always the same way, so as to distract attention, especially if there be a rival. Not always from first impulse; they will soon recognise the uniformity, and by anticipating, frustrate your designs. It is easy to kill a bird on the wing that flies straight: not so one that twists. Nor always act on second thoughts: they can discern the plan the second time. The enemy is on the watch, great skill is required to circumvent him. The gamester</p>  
<p><a name="page_11"><font size="1" color="green">p. 11</font></A></p>  
<p>never plays the card the opponent expects, still less that which he wants.</p>  
<p align="center">xviii <i>Application and Ability</i>.</p>  
<p>There is no attaining eminence without both, and where they unite there is the greatest eminence. Mediocrity obtains more with application than superiority without it. Work is the price which is paid for reputation. What costs little is little worth. Even for the highest posts it is only in some cases application that is wanting, rarely the talent. To prefer moderate success in great things than eminence in a humble post has the excuse of a generous mind, but not so to be content with humble mediocrity when you could shine among the highest. Thus nature and art are both needed, and application sets on them the seal.</p>  
<p align="center">xix <i>Arouse no Exaggerated Expectations on entering</i>.</p>  
<p>It is the usual ill-luck of all celebrities not to fulfil afterwards the expectations beforehand formed of them. The real can never equal the imagined, for it is easy to form ideals but very difficult to realise them. Imagination</p>  
<p><a name="page_12"><font size="1" color="green">p. 12</font></A></p>  
<p>weds Hope and gives birth to much more than things are in themselves. However great the excellences, they never suffice to fulfil expectations, and as men find themselves disappointed with their exorbitant expectations they are more ready to be disillusionised than to admire. Hope is a great falsifier of truth; let skill guard against this by ensuring that fruition exceeds desire. A few creditable attempts at the beginning are sufficient to arouse curiosity without pledging one to the final object. It is better that reality should surpass the design and is better than was thought. This rule does not apply to the wicked, for the same exaggeration is a great aid to them; they are defeated amid general applause, and what seemed at first extreme ruin comes to be thought quite bearable.</p>  
<p align="center">xx <i>A Man of the Age</i>.</p>  
<p>The rarest individuals depend on their age. It is not every one that finds the age he deserves, and even when he finds it he does not always know how to utilise it. Some men have been worthy of a better century, for every species of good does not always triumph. Things have their period; even excellences are subject to fashion. The sage has one advantage: he is</p>  
<p><a name="page_13"><font size="1" color="green">p. 13</font></A></p>  
<p>immortal. If <i>this</i> is not his century many others will be.</p>  
<p align="center">xxi <i>The Art of being Lucky</i>.</p>  
<p>There are rules of luck: it is not all chance with the wise: it can be assisted by care. Some content themselves with placing them-selves confidently at the gate of Fortune, waiting till she opens it. Others do better, and press forward and profit by their clever boldness, reaching the goddess and winning her favour on the wings of their virtue and valour. But on a true philosophy there is no other umpire than virtue and insight; for there is no luck or ill-luck except wisdom and the reverse.</p>  
<p align="center">xxii <i>A Man of Knowledge to the Point</i>.</p>  
<p>Wise men arm themselves with tasteful and elegant erudition; a practical knowledge of what is going on not of a common kind but more like an expert. They possess a copious store of wise and witty sayings, and of noble deeds, and know how to employ them on fitting occasions. More is often taught by a jest than by the most serious teaching. Pat knowledge helps some more than the seven arts, be they ever so liberal.</p>  
<p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></A></p>  
<p align="center">xxiii <i>Be Spotless</i>:</p>  
<p>the indispensable condition of perfection. Few live without some weak point, either physical or moral, which they pamper because they could easily cure it. The keenness of others often regrets to see a slight defect attaching itself to a whole assembly of elevated qualities, and yet a single cloud can hide the whole of the sun. There are likewise patches on our reputation which ill-will soon finds out and is continually noticing. The highest skill is to transform them into ornament. So C&aelig;sar hid his natural defects with the laurel.</p>  
<p align="center">xxiv <i>Keep the Imagination under Control</i>;</p>  
<p>sometimes correcting, sometimes assisting it. For it is all-important for our happiness, and even sets the reason right. It can tyrannise, and is not content with looking on, but influences and even often dominates life, causing it to be happy or burdensome according to the folly to which it leads. For it makes us either contented or discontented with ourselves. Before some it continually holds up the penalties of action, and becomes the mortifying lash of these fools. To others it promises happiness and adventure with blissful</p>  
<p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></A></p>  
<p>delusion. It can do all this unless the most prudent self-control keeps it in subjection.</p>  
<p align="center">xxv <i>Know how to take a Hint</i>.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Twas once the art of arts to be able to discourse; now &#8217;tis no longer sufficient. We must know how to take a hint, especially in disabusing ourselves. He cannot make himself understood who does not himself easily understand. But on the other hand there are pretended diviners of the heart and lynxes of the intentions. The very truths which concern us most can only be half spoken, but with attention we can grasp the whole meaning. When you hear anything favourable keep a tight rein on your credulity; if unfavourable, give it the spur.</p>  
<p align="center">xxvi <i>Find out each Man's Thumbscrew</i>.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis the art of setting their wills in action. It needs more skill than resolution. You must know where to get at any one. Every volition has a special motive which varies according to taste. All men are idolaters, some of fame, others of self-interest, most of pleasure. Skill consists in knowing these idols in order to bring them into play. Knowing any man's mainspring</p>  
<p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></A></p>  
<p>of motive you have as it were the key to his will. Have resort to primary motors, which are not always the highest but more often the lowest part of his nature: there are more dispositions badly organised than well. First guess a man's ruling passion, appeal to it by a word, set it in motion by temptation, and you will infallibly give checkmate to his freedom of will.</p>  
<p align="center">xxvii <i>Prize Intensity more than Extent</i>.</p>  
<p>Excellence resides in quality not in quantity. The best is always few and rare: much lowers value. Even among men giants are commonly the real dwarfs. Some reckon books by the thickness, as if they were written to try the brawn more than the brain. Extent alone never rises above mediocrity: it is the misfortune of universal geniuses that in attempting to be at home everywhere, are so nowhere. Intensity gives eminence, and rises to the heroic in matters sublime.</p>  
<p align="center">xxviii <i>Common in Nothing</i>.</p>  
<p>First, not in taste. O great and wise, to be ill at ease when your deeds please the mob! The excesses of popular applause never satisfy</p>  
<p><a name="page_17"><font size="1" color="green">p. 17</font></A></p>  
<p>the sensible. Some there are such chameleons of popularity that they find enjoyment not in the sweet savours of Apollo but in the breath of the mob. Secondly, not in intelligence. Take no pleasure in the wonder of the mob, for ignorance never gets beyond wonder. While vulgar folly wonders wisdom watches for the trick.</p>  
<p align="center">xxix <i>A Man of Rectitude</i></p>  
<p>clings to the sect of right with such tenacity of purpose that neither the passions of the mob nor the violence of the tyrant can ever cause him to transgress the bounds of right. But who shall be such a Ph&#339;nix of equity? What a scanty following has rectitude! Many praise it indeed, but&#8212;for others. Others follow it till danger threatens; then the false deny it, the politic conceal it. For it cares not if it fights with friendship, power, or even self-interest: then comes the danger of desertion. Then astute men make plausible distinctions so as not to stand in the way of their superiors or of reasons of state. But the straightforward and constant regard dissimulation as a kind of treason, and set more store on tenacity than on sagacity. Such are always to be found on the side of truth, and if they desert a party, they do</p>  
<p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></A></p>  
<p>not change from fickleness, but because the others have first deserted truth.</p>  
<p align="center">xxx <i>Have naught to do with Occupations of Ill-repute</i>,</p>  
<p>still less with fads that bring more notoriety than repute. There are many fanciful sects, and from all the prudent man has to flee. There are bizarre tastes that always take to their heart all that wise men repudiate; they live in love with singularity. This may make them well known indeed, but more as objects of ridicule than of repute. A cautious man does not even make profession of his wisdom, still less of those matters that make their followers ridiculous. These need not be specified, for common contempt has sufficiently singled them out.</p>  
<p align="center">xxxi <i>Select the Lucky and avoid the Unlucky</i>.</p>  
<p>Ill-luck is generally the penalty of folly, and there is no disease so contagious to those who share in it. Never open the door to a lesser evil, for other and greater ones invariably slink in after it. The greatest skill at cards is to know when to discard; the smallest of current trumps is worth more than the ace of trumps of the last game. When in doubt, follow the</p>  
<p><a name="page_19"><font size="1" color="green">p. 19</font></A></p>  
<p>suit of the wise and prudent; sooner or later they will win the odd trick.</p>  
<p align="center">xxxii <i>Have the Reputation of being Gracious</i>.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis the chief glory of the high and mighty to be gracious, a prerogative of kings to conquer universal goodwill. That is the great advantage of a commanding position&#8212;to be able to do more good than others. Those make friends who do friendly acts. On the other hand, there are some who lay themselves out for not being gracious, not on account of the difficulty, but from a bad disposition. In all things they are the opposite of Divine grace.</p>  
<p align="center">xxxiii <i>Know how to Withdraw</i>.</p>  
<p>If it is a great lesson in life to know how to deny, it is a still greater to know how to deny oneself as regards both affairs and persons. There are extraneous occupations which eat away precious time. To be occupied in what does not concern you is worse than doing nothing. It is not enough for a careful man not to interfere with others, he must see that they do not interfere with him. One is not obliged to belong so much to all as not to belong at all to oneself. So with friends, their</p>  
<p><a name="page_20"><font size="1" color="green">p. 20</font></A></p>  
<p>help should not be abused or more demanded from them than they themselves will grant. All excess is a failing, but above all in personal intercourse. A wise moderation in this best preserves the goodwill and esteem of all, for by this means that precious boon of courtesy is not gradually worn away. Thus you preserve your genius free to select the elect, and never sin against the unwritten laws of good taste.</p>  
<p align="center">xxxiv <i>Know your strongest Point</i>&#8212;</p>  
<p>your pre-eminent gift; cultivate that and you will assist the rest. Every one would have excelled in something if he had known his strong point. Notice in what quality you surpass, and take charge of that. In some judgment excels, in others valour. Most do violence to their natural aptitude, and thus attain superiority in nothing. Time disillusionises us too late of what first flattered the passions.</p>  
<p align="center">xxv <i>Think over Things, most over the most Important</i>.</p>  
<p>All fools come to grief from want of thought. They never see even the half of things, and as they do not observe their own loss or gain, still</p>  
<p><a name="page_21"><font size="1" color="green">p. 21</font></A></p>  
<p>less do they apply any diligence to them. Some make much of what imports little and little of much, always weighing in the wrong scale. Many never lose their common sense, because they have none to lose. There are matters which should be observed with the closest attention of the mind, and thenceforth kept in its lowest depths. The wise man thinks over everything, but with a difference, most profoundly where there is some profound difficulty, and thinks that perhaps there is more in it than he thinks. Thus his comprehension extends as far as his apprehension.</p>  
<p align="center">xxxvi <i>In Acting or Refraining, weigh your Luck</i>.</p>  
<p>More depends on that than on noticing your temperament. If he is a fool who at forty applies to Hippocrates for health, still more is he one who then first applies to Seneca for wisdom. It is a great piece of skill to know how to guide your luck even while waiting for it. For something is to be done with it by waiting so as to use it at the proper moment, since it has periods and offers opportunities, though one cannot calculate its path, its steps are so irregular. When you find Fortune favourable, stride boldly forward, for she favours the bold and, being a woman, the young. But</p>  
<p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></A></p>  
<p>if you have bad luck, keep retired so as not to redouble the influence of your unlucky star.</p>  
<p align="center">xxxvii <i>Keep a Store of Sarcasms, and know how to use them</i>.</p>  
<p>This is the point of greatest tact in human intercourse. Such sarcasms are often thrown out to test men's moods, and by their means one often obtains the most subtle and penetrating touchstone of the heart. Other sarcasms are malicious, insolent, poisoned by envy or envenomed by passion, unexpected flashes which destroy at once all favour and esteem. Struck by the slightest word of this kind, many fall away from the closest intimacy with superiors or inferiors which could not be the slightest shaken by a whole conspiracy of popular insinuation or private malevolence. Other sarcasms, on the other hand, work favourably, confirming and assisting one's reputation. But the greater the skill with which they are launched, the greater the caution with which they should be received and the foresight with which they should he foreseen. For here a knowledge of the evil is in itself a means of defence, and a shot foreseen always misses its mark.</p>  
<p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></A></p>  
<p align="center">xxxviii <i>Leave your Luck while Winning</i>.</p>  
<p>All the best players do it. A fine retreat is as good as a gallant attack. Bring your exploits under cover when there are enough, or even when there are many of them. Luck long lasting was ever suspicious; interrupted seems safer, and is even sweeter to the taste for a little infusion of bitter-sweet. The higher the heap of luck, the greater the risk of a slip, and down comes all. Fortune pays you sometimes for the intensity of her favours by the shortness of their duration. She soon tires of carrying any one long on her shoulders.</p>  
<p align="center">xxxix <i>Recognise when Things are ripe, and then enjoy them</i>.</p>  
<p>The works of nature all reach a certain point of maturity; up to that they improve, after that they degenerate. Few works of art reach such a point that they cannot be improved. It is an especial privilege of good taste to enjoy everything at its ripest. Not all can do this, nor do all who can know this. There is a ripening point too for fruits of intellect; it is well to know this both for their value in use and for their value in exchange.</p>  
<p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></A></p>  
<p align="center">xl <i>The Goodwill of People</i>.</p>  
<p>&#8217;Tis much to gain universal admiration; more, universal love. Something depends on natural disposition, more on practice: the first founds, the second then builds on that foundation. Brilliant parts suffice not, though they are presupposed; win good opinion and &#8217;tis easy to win goodwill. Kindly acts besides are required to produce kindly feelings, doing good with both hands, good words and better deeds, loving so as to be loved. Courtesy is the politic witchery of great personages. First lay hand on deeds and then on pens; words follow swords; for there is goodwill to be won among writers, and it is eternal.</p>  
<p align="center">xli <i>Never Exaggerate</i>.</p>  
<p>It is an important object of attention not to talk in superlatives, so as neither to offend against truth nor to give a mean idea of one's understanding. Exaggeration is a prodigality of the judgment which shows the narrowness of one's knowledge or one's taste. Praise arouses lively curiosity, begets desire, and if afterwards the value does not correspond to the price, as generally happens, expectation revolts against</p>  
<p><a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="green">p. 25</font></A></p>  
<p>the deception, and revenges itself by under-estimating the thing recommended and the person recommending. A prudent man goes more cautiously to work, and prefers to err by omission than by commission. Extraordinary things are rare, therefore moderate ordinary valuation. Exaggeration is a branch of lying, and you lose by it the credit of good taste, which is much, and of good sense, which is more.</p>  
<p align="center">xlii <i>Born to Command</i>.</p>  
<p>It is a secret force of superiority not to have to get on by artful trickery but by an inborn power of rule. All submit to it without knowing why, recognising the secret vigour of connatural authority. Such magisterial spirits are kings by merit and lions by innate privilege. By the esteem which they inspire, they hold the hearts and minds of the rest. If their other qualities permit, such men are born to be the prime motors of the state. They per-form more by a gesture than others by a long harangue.</p>  
<p align="center">xliii <i>Think with the Few and speak with the Many</i>.</p>  
<p>By swimming against the stream it is impossible to remove error, easy to fall into</p>  
<p><a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="green">p. 26</font></A></p>  
<p>danger; only a Socrates can undertake it. To dissent from others' views is regarded as an insult, because it is their condemnation. Disgust is doubled on account of the thing blamed and of the person who praised it. Truth is for the few, error is both common and vulgar. The wise man is not known by what he says on the house-tops, for there he speaks not with his own voice but with that of common folly, however much his inmost thoughts may gainsay it. The prudent avoid being contradicted as much as contradicting: though they have their censure ready they are not ready to publish it. Thought is free, force cannot and should not be used to it. The wise man therefore retires into silence, and if he allows himself to come out of it, he does so in the shade and before few and fit persons.</p>  
<p align="center">xliv <i>Sympathy with great Minds</i>.</p>  
<p>It is an heroic quality to agree with heroes. &#8217;Tis like a miracle of nature for mystery and for use. There is a natural kinship of hearts and minds: its effects are such that vulgar ignorance scents witchcraft. Esteem established, goodwill follows, which at times reaches affection. It persuades without words and obtains without earning. This sympathy</p>  
<p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></A></p>  
<p>is sometimes active, sometimes passive, both alike felicific; the more so, the more sublime. &#8217;Tis a great art to recognise, to distinguish and to utilise this gift. No amount of energy suffices without that favour of nature.</p>  
<p align="center">xlv <i>Use, but do not abuse, Cunning</i>.</p>  
<p>One ought not to delight in it, still less to boast of it. Everything artificial should be concealed, most of all cunning, which is hated. Deceit is much in use; therefore our caution has to be redoubled, but not so as to show itself, for it arouses distrust, causes much annoy, awakens revenge, and gives rise to more ills than you would imagine. To go to work with caution is of great advantage in action, and there is no greater proof of wisdom. The greatest skill in any deed consists in the sure mastery with which it is executed.</p>  
<p align="center">xlvi <i>Master your Antipathies</i>.</p>  
<p>We often allow ourselves to take dislikes, and that before we know anything of a person. At times this innate yet vulgar aversion attaches Itself to eminent personalities. Good sense masters this feeling, for there is nothing more discreditable than to dislike those better than</p>  
<p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></A></p>  
<p>ourselves. As sympathy with great men en-nobles us, so dislike to them degrades us.</p>  
<p align="center">xlvii <i>Avoid "Affairs of Honour"</i></p>  
<p>&#8212;one of the chiefest aims of prudence. In men of great ability the extremes are kept far asunder, so that there is a long distance between them, and they always keep in the middle of their caution, so that they take time to break through it. It is easier to avoid such affairs than to come well out of them. They test our judgment; it is better to avoid them than to conquer in them. One affair of honour leads to another, and may lead to an affair of dishonour. There are men so constituted by nature or by nation that they easily enter upon such obligations. But for him that walks by the light of reason, such a matter requires long thinking over. There is more valour needed not to take up the affair than to conquer in it. When there is one fool ready for the occasion, one may excuse oneself from being the second.</p>  
<p align="center">xlviii <i>Be Thorough</i>.</p>  
<p>How much depends on the person. The interior must be at least as much as the exterior. There are natures all frontage, like houses that</p>  
<p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></A></p>  
<p>for want of means have the portico of a palace leading to the rooms of a cottage. It is no use boring into such persons, although they bore you, for conversation flags after the first salutation. They prance through the first compliments like Sicilian barbs, but silence soon succeeds, for the flow of words soon ceases where there is no spring of thoughts. Others may be taken in by them because they themselves have but a view of the surface, but not the prudent, who look within them and find nothing there except material for scorn.</p>  
<p align="center">xlix <i>Observation and Judgment</i>.</p>  
<p>A man with these rules things, not they him. He sounds at once the profoundest depths; he is a phrenologist by means of physiognomy. On seeing a person he understands him and judges of his inmost nature. From a few observations he deciphers the most hidden recesses of his nature. Keen observation, subtile insight, judicious inference: with these he discovers, notices, grasps, and comprehends everything.</p>
