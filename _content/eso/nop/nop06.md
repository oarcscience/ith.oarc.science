### PART III.

### THE KABALAH ON NUMBERS.

<span class="smallcaps">Many</span> nations of antiquity made use of the
letters of their alphabets as substitutes for any independent signs to
typify numerical conceptions. It is with the Hebrew letters as numerals
that we are chiefly concerned, and to a smaller extent with the Greek.
Ancient records show that the Greeks used their numbers almost
exclusively for everyday purposes; while the Jewish Rabbis added to
their practical value special peculiar purposes, and looked to them to
furnish deeper views of nature, existence and doctrine. No doubt can
exist that the ancient Egyptians were fully aware of the wondrous
mysteries which numbers are able to disclose, so, considering that
Greece, and neither Judea nor Babylon, succeeded to the empires of
ancient Egypt, it is a curious fact how little knowledge of the dogmas
of the Hierophants of Sais, Memphis and Thebes Greek literature has
transmitted to us.

The Jewish Rabbis discovered so much of interest and importance behind
the merely superficial value of numbers, and of words as their
representatives, that they gradually developed a complete science of
numerical conceptions apart from mathematics; this took the name of
Kabalah or Qabalah, Cabbala, or even Cabala, words variously misspelt
from <span class="smallcaps">Qblh</span>—the Received doctrine, from the
root <span class="smallcaps">Qbl</span>, meaning to Receive.

The Greeks as aforesaid did not develop nor use their letters as numbers
for mental conceptions, yet in the Middle

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ages we often find
Greek letters used to transliterate Hebrew similars, and so there was
formed a bastard Greek Kabalah on the Hebrew type.

It must be constantly borne in mind that all Hebrew words or numbers are
read from right to left, or the reverse of English words; but in their
English transliteration they are here in English order.

The corresponding numerals, Greek and Hebrew letters, are here given
with their English names, and the English synonymous letters are also
added.

Note that there were no proper Greek Letters for 6, 90, and 900, so they
used special symbols—*episemon* (vau, or bau, digamma) for 6; *koppa*
for 90; and *sanpi* for 900—ς ϙ Ϡ).

At some periods the five finals were not used for the hundreds, but
instead Tau was written for 400 and other hundreds added; thus 500 was
TQ. Another point of importance is that the Jews never write JH Jah for
15, because it is a Deity title, they use instead 9, 6 thus TV, teth
vau. The Kabalists used JH only when they desired to call attention to
the Holy Name in the number.

In certain Kabalistic numerical computations many Rabbis deemed it
permissible to add an Aleph, one, and this they called the Colel.

In some cases we find the Greeks to have used their letters in direct
order for purposes of numeration, as may be seen in some copies of very
old poems (the 24 books of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, for example), in
which the stanzas bear the letters consecutively, in a similar manner to
the Hebrew letters heading the portions of the 119th Psalm in our
Bibles.

The word Kabalah includes the Hebrew Doctrines of Cosmogony and Theology
as well as the Science of

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Numbers. The
former is specified as the Dogmatic Kabalah, the latter as the Literal
Kabalah.

By means of associating the ancient doctrines of Numbers with the
letters of the alphabet, the Planets, Stars, Zodiacal signs and other
astronomical terms, a form of divination became practised, by which the
professors attempted to foretell the future, life and death, good and
evil Fortune, detection of theft, etc., an ample explanation of which
may be studied by the curious in the "Holy Guide" of John Heydon.

With this system is associated the practice of pure Astrology, the
divination of Fate by means of the Heavenly bodies, especially the
formation of the so-called Horoscopes—schemes of the arrangement of the
Planets at the moment of Birth, from which all the important phases of
the life can be inferred—by some few persons. The Kabalah became a means
of handing down from one generation to another hidden truths, religious
notions, secrets of nature, ideas of Cosmogony, and facts of history, in
a form which was unintelligible to the uninitiated; and the revealing of
the secrets, and the methods of interpretation were veiled in mystery,
and only to be approached through Religion.

The more practical part of the system was involved in the three
processes of:—

<span class="smallcaps">Gematria</span>, <span
class="smallcaps">Notaricon</span>, and <span
class="smallcaps">Temura</span>.

*Gematria*, a method depending on the fact that each Hebrew letter had a
numerical value. When the sum of the numbers of the letters composing a
word was the same as the sum of the letters of another word, however
different, they perceived an analogy between them, and considered them
to have a necessary connection. Thus certain numbers got to be well
known as meaning certain things; and not words only, but sentences were
treated in this manner; thus, as an example referring to Genesis xviii.
v. 2, we find the words, "and lo, three men," Vehennah, shalisha, <span
class="smallcaps">Vhnh Shlshh</span>; this set down in numbers becomes
6, 5, 50, 5, 300, 30, 300, 5, which amount to 701: now the words, "these
are Michael, Gabriel, and Raphael,"

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Alu Mikhael
Gabriel ve Raphael," ALU MIKAL GBRIAL V RPAL converted are, 1, 30, 6,
40, 10, 20, 1, 30, 3, 2, 200, 10, 1, 30, 6, 200, 80, 1, 30, also
amounting to 701, and the Rabbis argued that these two sets of three
beings were identical. Some Christian Kabalists point out that in
Genesis xlix. v. 10 we find "Yebah Shiloh," YBA SHILH, "Shiloh shall
come," which amount to 358; and that the word "Messiah," MShVCh is 40,
300, to, 8, or 358; but so is also Nachash, the Serpent of Moses, NChSh,
50, 8, 300; and I must remark that the claim to translate ShILh, or, as
some ancient Hebrew MSS. write it, ShLh, by "Shiloh," in the sense of
Jesus Christ, is far-fetched. The word is simply "rest," or "peace," in
its simplest meaning, but also is the Scorpio of the Chaldean zodiac
(related to Nachash, serpent); and "Judah," of whom Jacob is talking in
the prophecy, is the sign of the zodiac; Leo for "Judah is a lion's
whelp" (the Chaldean zodiac has a lion couchant), "he crouches as a
lion." In this sense, then, "the sceptre shall not depart from Judah,"
*i.e.*, power shall not leave Leo, until Shelah, Shiloh or Scorpio shall
come up or rise. Astronomy teaches that as Leo passes away from the
meridian, Scorpio rises. The title "Comforter," "Menachem," MNChM, 40,
50, 8, 40, amounting to 138, and the title "The Branch," applied to the
Messiah in Zechariah iii. v. 8, namely, TzMCh, 90, 40, 8, also 138, are
of the same number. Metatron, the great angel MThRThN, and ShADDAI ShDI,
translated "Almighty," are both 314. The letter Shin, Sh, = 300, is used
as a glyph of "the spirit of the living gods," Ruach Elohim RUCh ALhIM,
which transmutes into 200, 6, 8, 1, 30, 5, 10, 40, or 300.

The Kabalists sometimes considered the units to refer to Divine Beings,
the tens to celestial bodies, hundreds to things of earth, and thousands
to future events.

*Notaricon*, a word derived from the Latin *notarius*, a shorthand
writer, means the construction of a word from the initial or final
letters of the several words of a sentence; or vice versa the
construction of a sentence of which each word

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

in order begins with the several letters composing a given word:
processes of contraction and expansion, therefore.

Refer to Deuteronomy xxx. V. 12, and find that Moses asks, "Who shall go
up for us to heaven?" the initials of the words of the sentence, MY YOLh
LNU HShMYMH, read "My yeolah lenu hashemimha," form the word MYLH or
"Mylah," which means "Circumcision," and the final letters form the word
Jehovah, YHUH or IHVH, suggesting that Jehovah pointed out the way, by
circumcision, to heaven. Again the first six letters of the book of
Genesis, BRAShIT, Berasit, translated "In the beginning," but more
properly "In wisdom," are the initials of the words BRAShIT RAH ALHIM
ShYQBLU IShRAL TURH, read "Berasit rauah Elohim shyequebelu Israel
torah," which mean "In the beginning, God saw that Israel would accept
the Law."

The famous Rabbinic name of power, "AGLA," is formed of the initials of
the sentence, "Tu potens in sæculum Domine," ATH GBUR LOULM ADNI, Ateh
gibur loulam Adonai. The word "Amen" is from AMN, the initials of
"Adonai melekh namen," ADNI MLK NAMN, meaning "The Lord and Faithful
King."

Temura means Permutation; sometimes the letters of a word are transposed
according to certain rules, and with certain limitations; at others each
letter of a word is replaced by another according to a definite scheme,
forming a new word, of which permutation there are many recognised
forms. For example, the alphabet of 22 letters is halved and the two
sets placed one over the other in reverse order, thus:—

<div align="center">

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| A   | B   | G   | D   | H   | V   | Z   | Ch  | Th  | Y   | K   |
| T   | Sh  | R   | Q   | Tz  | P   | O   | S   | N   | M   | L   |

</div>

then A is changed to T, and V to P, and so on; so Babel = BBL becomes
Sheshak, *i.e.*, ShShx used by Jeremiah xxv. v. 26. This form is called
Atbash or AT-BSh; it will be seen that there must be 21 other possible
forms, and these were named in order, thus, Albat, Agdat, etc.; the
complete set was called "the combinations of Tziruph." Other
Permutations were named Rational, Right, Averse

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

and Irregular; these are produced by forming a square and subdividing it
by 21 lines in each direction into 484 smaller squares, and then writing
in each square a letter in order successively from right to left, or
from above down, or the reverse. The most popular mode of permutation
has however been the form called "Kabalah of the Nine Chambers,"
produced by the intersection of two horizontal and two vertical lines,
forming nine spaces, a central square, and 4 three-sided figures, and 4
two-sided figures, to each of which are allotted certain letters; there
are several modes even of this arrangement, and there is a mystical mode
of allotting the Sephiroth to this figure, but this is a Rosicrucian
secret.

This method is used in a superficial manner in Mark Master Masonry.

A further development of the Numerical Kabalah consists of arithmetical
processes of Extension and Contraction; thus Tetragrammaton is
considered as Y 10, H 5, V 6, H 5, or 26, but also may be spelled in
full YVD 20, HA 6, VV 12, HA 6, or 44.

Again, the Kabalists extended a number by series. Zain Z or 7 becomes 1
and 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and 6 and 7, or 28. After another manner they
contracted, as 28 was equal to 2 and 8, or ro. Again, Tetragrammaton 26
became 2 and 6, or 8, so every number was reducible to a primary
numeral. In this manner, within certain restrictive laws, every word had
analogies with certain others; thus AB father 1 and 2 are 3, IHV Jehu 10
and 5 and 6 are 21, 2 and 1 are 3. AL ShDI, Al Shaddai, God Almighty, 1,
30, 300, 4, 10, or 345, becomes 12, and then 2 and 1 are 3; HVA or HOA
5, 6, 1, are 12, and then 3; and GDVLH Gedulah 3, 4, 6, 30, 5 are 48,
and are 12 and 3.

Another method of substitution leading to results of an opposite
character is the substitution in any word of similar letters of another
group, hard for soft, or sibilant for dental; thus in TM = perfect,
exchange Th for T, and obtain ThM, meaning defiled: ShAN, secure,
tranquil, becomes SAN, battle; ShKL, wisdom, becomes SKL, foolish. In
the word Shaddai, Sher, Almighty, with soft sibilant and soft

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

dental is Shiddah, a wife; if we replace with a hard dental, a partial
change of meaning is effected, ShThH, Sittah, an adulterous wife; both
letters hardened completely change the sense, STh, Seth, a fallen man, a
backslider; SThN, Satan, adversary.

I cannot, without Hebrew letters, explain well the change of sound in
the Shin SH, from SH to S, but it is marked by a dot over the right or
left tooth of the three teeth of the letter.

A deep mystery is concealed in the Genetic account of the conversion of
the names of Abram, ABRM, into Abraham, ABRHM, and that of his wife
Sarai, ShRI, into Sarah, SHRH, see Genesis xvii. v. 5–15, on the
occasion of the conception of Isaac, YTZChQ or YShChQ, from the root
ShChQ or TzChQ, "laugh," when Sarah was 90 and Abraham 100 years old.
This was on the occasion of the covenant made by Jehovah with Abram, and
the institution of circumcision of males in token thereof. Now here we
have the addition of an H or 5, the essentially Female Letter, to the
name of Abraham, and a conversion of a Yod into He, Y into H, in the
case of Sarah; and then their sterility is destroyed.

Some learned men consider Abraham to be a conversion of Brahma, the
Hindoo Deity. The name splits up curiously. AB is father, BR is son, AM
is like OM or AUM, a deific name of Power; RM meant "he is lifted up."
Blavatsky remarks that Abraham and Saturn were identical in
Astro-symbology; the Father of the Pharisees was Jehovah, and they were
of the seed of Abraham.

The number of ABRM is 1, 2, 200, 40 or 243, the number of the man
figure, Seir Anpin, representing Microprosopus.

Read Pistorius, "Ars Cabalistica," for the effect of adding H 5 to men's
names, see page 969; also Inman, "Ancient Faiths," article Abraham;
"Secret Doctrine," i. 578, ii. 77; also C. W. King, "The Gnostics."

The name Sarah also has a curious set of similars in Hebrew—SRH,
princess; SAR, flesh; SOR, gate; SChR, black; SUR, hairy seir; SRT,
incision; SR and SRR, navel;

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

and note the Sacti of Brahma is Sara-swati, watery; Sara refers to <span
class="smallcaps">Sri</span>, Lakhsmi, Aphrodite, and all are related to
Water and Luna, Vach, Sophia of the Gnostics, and the ideal Holy Ghost,
all feminine.

The 243 of Abram becomes 248 by adding H, and Sarai 510 becomes 505 by
taking 5 off, putting H for Y, and the total of the two names is
unaltered, being 753; 248 is the number of the members of Microprosopus
and of RChM, rechem or Mercy.

Before leaving this subject, a reference must be made to the Magic
Squares, of the Planets, etc.; to each planet belongs a special unit,
and secondarily other numbers.

Thus the Square of Saturn has three compartments each way, and in each
subdivision is a unit, 1 to 9, so arranged that the columns add up to 15
every way, the total being 45. The Square of Jupiter has a side of four
divisions, total 16; each line adds up to 34, and the total is 136.

The Square of Mars is given here as an example, each side 5, total
squares 25, each side counting 65, and total 325.

Similarly the four several numbers of Sol are 6, 36, 111, 666. Of Venus,
7, 49, 175, 1225. Of Mercury, 8, 64, 260, 2080.

Of Luna, 9, 81, 369, 3321. Each number then becomes a name. Take the
case of Mercury; 64 is alike DIN and DNI, Din and Doni; 260 is Tiriel,
TIRIAL; and 2080 is Taphthartharath, TPTRTRT.

Rawlinson, in his volumes on the Ancient Monarchies, states that the
Chaldeans associated mystic numbers with their Deities; thus to Anu,
Pluto, 60; Bel, Jupiter, 50; Hoa,

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Neptune, 40; Sin,
the Moon, 30; Shamash, the Sun, 20; Nergal (Mars), 12; and Beltis or
Mylitta, 15; and Nin is Saturn, 10.

It will be noticed that the great number of Sol is 666, called Sorath,
SURT, the number of the Beast, about which so much folly has been
written. One famous square of five times five divisions, amounting in
most directions to 666, is formed of the mystic words *sator*, *arepo*,
*tenet*, *opera*, *rotas*. Of these the first, third, and last number
666, but *opera* and its reverse number only 356. The number 608 is
notable, being in Coptic, PhRE, the sun 500, 100, 8; and in Greek we
find VHS, 400, 8, 200, which becomes IHS in Latin, for the Greek Upsilon
changes to Y and I in Latin, and so we obtain the anagram of "Iesus
hominum Salvator."

Kircher points out a Greek example of magic squares; the names Jesus and
Mary, and <span class="smallcaps">Iesous Maria</span> have a curious
relation. Iesous is 10, 8, 200, 70, 400, 200 = 888. Now take Maria, 40,
1, 100, 10, 1 = 152. Set 152 in a Magic Square of Three, *i.e.*, nine
compartments, thus, 1—5—2, 5—2—1, 2—1—5, then the totals are all 888.
The letters of Iesous also make a magic square of 36 divisions, adding
every way to 888. Consult the "Arithmologia" of Kircher.

Remember "*illius meminit Sybilla de nomina ejus vaticinando*," "*onoma
Sou monades, dekades, ekaton tades okto*," or "*nomen tuum* 8
*unitates,* 8 *denarii,* 8 *centenarii*."—See St. Augustine, *De
Civitate Dei*.

Note the mystic word Abraxas is 1, 2, 100, 1, 60, 1, 200 = 365 in Greek
letters.

As a curiosity, note that the Roman X for 10 is two V's, which are each
5; C, or, squarely drawn, <span id="img_03100"></span>
![](img/03100.jpg), for 100 consists of two L's which are each 50.
Priscian says I for 1 was taken from i in the middle of the Greek *mia*,
female of *eis*, 1, and V for 5 because it was the fifth vowel. To
remember Hebrew numerals note A, I, Q = 1, 10, 100; and in Greek A, I,
R, A= 1, 10, 100, 1,000.

According to "The Canon," of 1897, an anonymous work,

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

a Vesica piscis (the figure formed by the intersection of two equal
circles) whose dimensions are 26 and 15, is a symbol of the hidden rule
or canon by which Natural laws were represented to Initiates in the
secret wisdom of the Ancient Mysteries. The Greek gods Zeus, Jupiter and
Apollo, the Sun god, have the same numerical relation.
