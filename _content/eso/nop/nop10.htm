<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">W. F. Shaw</span> calls attention to the number 3&frac12; as being of mystical importance, as the half of seven, typifying present suffering as compared with future joy. The famine in the time of Elias, when Israel was persecuted by Ahab and Jezebel, lasted 3&frac12; years. Antiochus Epiphanes persecuted the church 3&frac12; years. Forty-two months, or 3&frac12; years, are symbolical of times of trouble. Jesus preached 3&frac12; years.</p>  
<p>In the Revelations, the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, suffers 1260 days in the wilderness, being a time, times, and a half, Rev. xii. 6&#8211;14. Again the Holy City is said to be trodden under foot forty-two months, or 3&frac12; years. The two witnesses testify 3&frac12; years, and their dead bodies remain unburied 3&frac12; days: so also the scattering of the holy people as mentioned in Daniel xii. 7 is for three times and a half, by which we were to understand a period of suffering.</p>
