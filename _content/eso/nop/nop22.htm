<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> 14 days of Burial, in the Master's degree: 14 parts into which the body of Osiris was divided: a type of Christ, sacrificed on the 14th day of the month: an amulet of 14 points has been used to cure the sick.</p>  
<p>There are 14 Books of the Apocrypha; they were written originally in <A HREF="errata.htm#1">Greek</A>, never in Hebrew. An Israelite had to partake of 14 meals in the Booth during the Feast of Tabernacles.</p>  
<p>The Israelites killed the Paschal Lamb on the 14th day of the Month Nisan.</p>  
<p>In Matthew, chap. i., we find the genealogy of Jesus recited in three series of 14 names, the first under Patriarchs and judges, the second under kings, and the third under priests and governors.</p>  
<p>The ancient physicians considered that the 14th day was the crisis of fevers.</p>  
<p>The Moon waxes and wanes, each for 14 days.</p>  
<p>15 was the number of Pairs of The &AElig;ons, or Holy Principles in the Gnostic scheme of Valentinus.</p>  
<p>15 is the number by Gematria of the 8th Sephira Hod, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hud</span>.</p>  
<p>There were 15 steps in the Temple between the ante-court of Israel and the Women's Court, and in these were sung the 15 Psalms of Degrees; Psalms cxx.&#8211;cxxxiv. 15 is the number of Jah, a name of God; so the Jews who wrote letters for numbers, never wrote JH, 10, 5, for 15, but TV, 9, 6 15.</p>  
<p>The great day of joyful recreation for Jewish Maidens</p>  
<p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="green">p. 112</font></A></p>  
<p>was the 15th day of the month Ab. The Deluge covered the hills to the depth of 15 cubits.</p>  
<p>A Jewish boy in the olden time was ordered to begin the study of the Gemara when 15 years of age.</p>  
<p>16 means Felicity; a square number. There are 16 Court Cards in a Tarot pack.</p>  
<p>17. In the treatise "De Iside et Osiride," Plutarch says Osiris was killed on the 17th day of the moon, and hence when the moon was at the full&#8212;and from that reason the Egyptians abominate the number 17, and so did the Pythagoreans&#8212;they called in Antiphraxis (obstruction), because it falls between the square number 16 and the oblong number 18.</p>  
<p>18 was deemed a protection against thieves.</p>  
<p>18. Isaiah made 18 denunciations against Israel. At 18 years of age a girl should go to the Nuptial Canopy. The Golden Candlestick of the Temple was 18 hands-breadths tall. There are 18 Blessings in the Hebrew Liturgy. There were only 18 High Priests during the existence of the First or Solomonic Temple at Jerusalem.</p>  
<p>19. The number 19 is famous as being the number of years in the Metonic Cycle; the cycle of the revolutions of the moon, after which she returns to have her changes on the same day of the solar year. Meto lived 433 B.C.; he was an Athenian; he published his discovery at the Olympic Games in the above year. The exact period is, however, 18 years and to days. The Calippic period of four cycles, or seventy-six years, was invented by Calippus, B.C. 330, to correct Meto. John Heydon says that the number 19 facilitates births and menses.</p>  
<p>20. The Kiddushin, 29. 2, says God may curse a man who does not marry at least when 20 years old, for his life is a constant transgression. A woman marrying before 20 may bear children up to sixty; at 20 until forty, and after forty will have none. Bava Bathra, 119. 2. To die after 20 days&#8217; diarrh&#339;a is to die pure.</p>  
<p>21. A hen sits 21 days, and the Almond is ripe 21 days after the flower falls.</p>  
<p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="green">p. 113</font></A></p>  
<p>22 Letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, used also as numerals. The realization of a good Dream may be deferred 22 years. Berachoth, 55. 2.</p>  
<p>From the Works of Hermes Trismegistus are abstracted 22 axioms on the Human Will; they can be found in Tukaram Tatya's "Guide to Theosophy," Bombay, 1887.</p>  
<p>There are 22 Trumps in a pack of ancient Tarot Cards, used for Divination; Eliphaz L&eacute;vi, in his "Clef des Myst&egrave;res," says that the numbers 1 to 19 refer to the Keys of Occult Science, and that numbers 19 to 22 are the Keys of Nature: the relation of letters to these are nowhere correctly printed in books.</p>  
<p>23. In the Sanhedrin 23 judges were required to try cases punishable by death.</p>  
<p>23. This day of September is notable because the moon which comes to the full within a fortnight of it is called the harvest moon, which rises three days in succession at the same time, instead of getting daily later.</p>  
<p>24 is an evil number, referring to Cain, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Qin</span>, but not of his numeration, which is 100 + 10 + 50 =160, or else 100 + 10 + 700 = 810.</p>  
<p>24. There are 24 birds unclean as food; 24 ribs both in man and woman.</p>  
<p>26. The number of Jehovah, IHVH, 10 + 5 + 6 + 5.</p>  
<p>26. In the English language, which uses 26 letters, it is found that the letters occur in very different proportions. In a fair example of modern English it has been calculated that the proportion between the frequency of the use of the letters was, of a, 85; b, 16; c, 30; d, 44; e, 120; f, 25; g, 17; h, 64; i, 80; j, 4; k, 8; 1, 40; m, 30; n, 80; o, 80; p, 17; q, 5; r, 62; s, 80; t, 90; u, 34; v, 12; w, 20; x, 4; y, 20; and z, 2.</p>  
<p>27. The number of the Izeds or Angels who ruled under the supervision of the Seven Amshaspands of the Zoroastrian theology.</p>  
<p>28. A division of the Zodiac into 28 mansions of the moon, was probably earlier than the solar division into 12</p>  
<p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="green">p. 114</font></A></p>  
<p>parts. The names and symbols can be obtained in Sanskrit and in Arabic. Proctor believes that Solar Astronomy of the 12 signs arose about 2170 B.C., in a country of about 36 degrees of north latitude, and at a period when Taurus was the first constellation of the Zodiac.</p>  
<p>29. The Rosh Hashanha says the period of the Moon's Revolution is 29 days and six hours and forty minutes.</p>  
<p>30. A meal of Lentils once in 30 days keeps off the Quinsy. At 30 years of age Jesus began his ministry; Joseph was 30 years old when he stood before Pharaoh; David was 30 years old when he began to reign; 30 pieces of silver was the price Judas received, and Jair had 30 sons.</p>  
<p>31. The number of El, God = <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Al</span>. 1 + 30.</p>

<p>36. Abaji said there are never less than 36 holy men of any generation upon whom the Shekinah does not rest.</p>  
<p>36. Plutarch, "De Iside et Osiride," calls the Tetractys the power of the number 36, and on this was the greatest oath of the Pythagoreans sworn; and it was denominated the World, in consequence of its being composed of the first four even and the first four odd numbers; for 1 and 3 and 5 and 7 are 16; add 2 and 4 and 6 and 8, and obtain 36.</p>  
<p>39. The number of Articles of the Protestant Christian Church belief.</p>  
<p>40. Up to 40 years of age eating is best for a man, after 40 drinking suits best. He who has passed 40 days without an affliction has had his reward in this life.</p>  
<p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="green">p. 115</font></A></p>

Moses was 40 years in Egypt, 40 in Midian, and 40 in the Wilderness. The Israelites were 40 years among the Philistines.</p>  
<p>42 is notable because of the 42-lettered name of God, taught by the Kabalists: there were 42 Judges in the Judgment Hall of Osiris. See Bettany, "The World's Religions," p. 166, on the events of the 42nd day after death.</p>  
<p>42. The Talmud of Babylon in Kiddushin 71, mentions the 42-lettered Name, and it is given by Ignatz Stern as composed of the Divine Names of the Bible; thus Eheieh asher eheieh, Al, Jah, Jehovah, Elohim, Jehovah Sabaoth, El Chai and Adonai. AHIH AShR AHIH; IH; IHVIH; AL; ALHIM; IHVH TzBAVT; AL ChI; ADNI, Or 4, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 5, 4, 5, 2, 2, 4 = 42.</p>  
<p>It is very curious that the Ten Sephiroth which denote the attributes of God will show, when these letters are added together, and a V added for <i>and</i> before the last one, this same number 42; if Chesed be called Gedulah, as was common among Kabalists.</p>  
<p>45. The number of Adam, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Adm</span>.</p>

<p>72. It is said that Ptolemy, King of Egypt, collected 72 Hebrew Rabbis and confined each in a separate room, and ordered each to write out the Mosaic Law, and that by the help of God each wrote out the same words. Megillah of the Talmud, 9. 1.</p>  
<p>This account is similar to that of Josephus and Arist&aelig;us, but different to that of Philo: hence the name Septuagint.</p>
