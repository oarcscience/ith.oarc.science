CHAOS MAGICK REVIEW: _Liber Null & Psychonaut_, by Peter Carroll

Excerpts by Elendraug i69!
__________________________________________________________________

[[Chaos (/Kia & Chaos Magic)//

* That which is responsible for the origin and continued action of events.

* ...the force which adds increasing complexity to the universe by spawning
structures which were not inherent to its component parts.

* ...the force which caused life to evolve itself out of the dust.

* ...is currently most concentrated in the human life force, or Kia, 
where it is... 

* ...the source of consciousness.
								28
* ...cannot be known directly.

* [gets its name]...from the bizarre and indeterminate nature of the
aetheric plane.

* [we are]...centers of Kia or Chaos.
								29
* All ones thoughts, obsessions, and demons must be reabsorbed before
Kia can become one with Chaos.
								40
* It is true that the mind must be finally surrendered as one enters
fully into Chaos, but a complete and balanced psychocosm is more
easily surrendered.
								41
* In beginning the great work of obtaining the knowledge and conversation
[of our Holy Guardian Angel or Augoeides], the magician vows 'to interpret
every manifestation of existence as a direct message from the infinite
Chaos to himself personally.'
								49
* Space, time, mass, and energy originate from Chaos, have their being
in Chaos, and through the agency of the aether are moved by Chaos in
the multiple forms of existence.
								52
* What is a god but man wielding the force of Chaos?  To him nothing
is true; everything is permitted.

* Yet the Great Goddess Chaos will lend some of Her power to those who
can become her favorites.
								52
* Chaos, the life force of the universe, is not human-hearted.  Therefore
the wizard cannot be human-hearted when he seeks to tap the force of the
universe.  He performs monstrous and arbitrary acts to loosen the hold of
human limitations upon himself.
								66
* ...out of Chaos arise the two prime forces of existence, the solve et
coagula of existence.  The Light power and the Dark.
								103
* It is impossible to understand Chaos, because the understanding
part of ourselves is built out of matter which mainly obeys the
statistical form of causality.  Indeed, all our rational thinking
is structured on the hypothesis that one causes another.
It follows then that our thinking will never be able to appreciate
the nature of consciousness of the universe as a whole because
these are spontaneous, magical, and chaotic by nature....  The
universe IS the thoughts of Chaos, if you like.  We may be able
to understand the thoughts, but not the Chaos from which they
arise.  Similarly, we may be accustomed to being conscious and
exerting our will, but we shall never be able to form ideas of
what these are.
								153-154
* The force which initiates and moves the universe [Chaos],
and the force which lies at the center of consciousness [Kia],
is whimsical and arbitrary, creating and destroying for no
purpose beyond amusing Itself.  There is nothing spiritual or
moralistic about Chaos or Kia.  We live in a universe where
nothing is true, although some information may be useful for
relative purposes.
								154
* ...the animating force of the entire vast universe is Chaos.  It is the
inexpressible pregnant Void from which manifest existence, order, and
form arise.  Being omnipresent and non-dualistic, it is virtually
imperceptible, inconceivable, and impossible to visualize...

* However we choose to see it, the ultimate ground of being is utterly
void to our understanding, impersonal and inhuman, whimsical and
capricious and far too infinite and incomprehensible to be much use
as a god to limited dualistic beings like ourselves.
								157-158
* The consciousness-force in us that appears as the root of
will and perception can be called Kia.  This Kia has no form.
Any form of innate divinely sanctioned motive that one may
seem to have found in it is illusion.  It is this void at the center
of one's being which is the real Holy Guardian Angel.  The psychic
censor, on the other hand, is a material thing which protects the
mind from magic and from being overwhelmed by the awesome
strangeness of the psychic dimension which appears to us as chaos.
								162
* We cannot perceive Chaos directly, for it simultaneously contains
the opposite to anything we might think it is.  We can, however,
occasionally glimpse and make use of partially formed matter
which has only probablistic and indeterministic existence.  This
stuff we can call the aethers.

* If it makes us feel any better we can call this Chaos, the Tao, or
God, and imagine it to be benevolent and human-hearted.  There are  
two schools of thought in magic.  One considers the formative agent
of the universe to be random and chaotic, and the other considers
that it is a force of spiritual consciousness.  As they have only
themselves on which to base their speculations, they are basically
saying that their own natures are either random and chaotic or
spiritually conscious.

|||Magic!!!

* [calling]... very unlikely coincidences or unexpected events into
existence by manipulating the aether.
                                                                31
* The magician can only change something if he can 'match' the Chaos
which is upholding the normal event.
                                                                55
* Thus does the magician turn that aspect of Chaos which manifests as
causality to his advantage, rather than oppose it.
                                                                56
* The adept magician however will have so strengthened his spirit by
magic that it is possible for him to carry [his personal Kia] over into
a new body.
                                                                103
* Magic is where science is actually heading.
                                                                111
* It is for wizards to determine how that new [alternative] spirituality
will manifest.

* The methods of magic are remarkably uniform throughout history and
across cultures.  It is time to unearth them and make them work.  Secondly,
it is essential that what might be called a spirituality of magic is evolved.
Magic must have its own flavor, its own worldview, and its own philosophy.
There has been a tendency to regard magic as an antique art.
                                                                114
* Magic is aligning itself against oppressive forms of order in many
fields.

* Magic is opposed to psychiatry and medicine designed to patch up the
damaged automaton and plug him back into the system.  Instead it would
rather that individuals learn to handle their own mental self-defense
and treat bodies with gentler remedies such as herbs.

* Magic rejects politics as no more than some people's perverse desire
to dominate others.  It does well to dissociate itself from this monkey
squabble and advocates instead personal enlightenment and emancipation,
which are the only real safeguards to freedom.

* Magic is anti-ideological because the main products of ideological
solutions are repression and corpses.

* Magic is profoundly opposed to religion.  Although a religion may appear
benign when it is in decline, at least half of the madness and violent
deaths of history have been caused by mindless adherence to religions.

* Magic is also opposed to the superstition that the world is wholly
material and that men's actions are not intimately interwoven with
the psychic sphere.

* Magic aligns itself to a vision of chaotic good [to oppose repressive
forms of order which often impose themselves by evil means].

* Magic's commitment to the good is reflected in its concern with
individual freedom and consciousness and its interest in all other
life forms on this planet.  At the highest level this manifests as
some unspecified feeling for the "vibes" generated by human thought
and action.

* The chaotic aspect of new aeon magic is psychological anarchy.
It is a species of operation mindfuck applied to ourselves as much
of the world.  The aim is to produce inspiration and enlightenment
through disordering our belief structures.  Humor, random belief,
counter-information and disinformation are its techniques.
                                                        113-115
                                                        New Aeon Magic
*Full rituals of the meditative or ecstatic variety
are usually directed towards one of the four objectives: 
Enchantment - making things happen directly by magic
Evocation - making things happen through the agency of various
        demons and elementals
Invocation - the summoning of various entities and thought forms
        for the inspiration of their knowledge and conversation
Divination - obtaining knowledge by direct magical means.

* The simplest way to orchestrate these rituals for group work
is for a presiding officer to perform the main ritual sequence and
have the participants deliver their visualizations, mantras,
ritual movements and invocations on certain pre-arranged cues.

* To be effective, the ritual must work like an automatic mechanism
in which power can manifest without distraction or hesitation.
A variety of trance states from mild suggestibility to deep hypnosis
can be used for group magical work.  One operator will persuade one
or more subjects into a receptive condition by suggestion or
invocation, the subject being in a relaxed or lightly drugged
condition.  The psychic censor is less active in the trance state
but often acts to block the awareness of magical events from
reaching other lovels.  When the trance state is controlled by
another person, this problem can be overcome.  The trance candidate
can be directed to seek information clairvoyantly and to relate it
to the operator.  Conversely, the subjects will can be directed to
perform a magical act that the censor would normally prohibit.

* One danger with trance experiments is that the operator's influence
over the subject may gradually extend itself to non-trance states
as well.  Another is that the memory and imagination can become very
active in trance states and begin to delude both operator and subject.
For these reasons trance experiments should be performed infrequently
and for objective results only.
                                                                118-119
                                                Group Magical Experiments
* Magical training is designed to open up the neglected dream
level, to provoke an examination of the contents of the robotic
level, and to add new programs to it.  It should also teach the
method of turning awareness on or off at will, and of entering
the gnostic level and acting within it.

* The normal human life is spent in oscillating between the unconscious
and robotic levels, punctuated by odd moments of dreaming and awareness.
The magician may well strive to establish a new oscillation between
dreaming and awareness with occasional excursions into the robotic
and gnostic levels for specific purposes.
                                                                123
* Magical attack takes two forms.  At long range, telepathic information
is sent which makes the target destroy itself.... At short range, it is
possible to injure or drain an adversary's energy field using one's own.
This demands close proximity, usually contact.  Magical close combat
of this type is not effected by mere will or visualization, but by
projecting a force that can actually be felt, usually through the hands.
More rarely the force can be projected through the voice or the eyes or
carried on the breath.  The force originates in the navel area and is
aroused by the disciplines of breath, concentration, visualization and
by sexual disciplines.  A part of this force is put into the enemy's body
to cause a disruption of the vital energies leading to disease and death....

* As with all things, constructive activities are a far greater challenge
to our skills than destructive ones.
                                                                125-127
                                                        Magical Combat
* Because consciousness does not fit into... mechanistic
schemes, [scientists] declare it illusory.  Magicians make exactly
the reverse argument.  Observing consciousness in themselves and
animals, they are magnanimous enough to extend it to all things to
some degree - trees, amulets, planetary bodies, and all.

* To explain their occult and mystical experiences, magicians are forced
to develop models beyond the scope of materialistic or religious
systems.  To the magician it is self-evident that there is some other
level of reality than the purely physical.  Medieval magicians thought
that their powers emanated from God or the Devil.  In fact, magic works
equally well in any god's name for good, evil, neutral or indifferent
motives.
                                                                151
                                                        Magical Perspectives
* Magic offers an alternative view [of the human experience,
than the radical stimulus-response behaviorists or the radical
god-puppets of the religious].  Consciousness occurs when the Kia
(which is equivalent to free will and perception, but is itself
formless) touches the materiality (the ego, mind, sensory and
extra-sensory information, etc.).  So we have both of these things,
but we are neither of them; we experience our being only at their
place of meeting.
                                                                152
* Occasionally consciousness is able to make things happen 
spontaneously outside the body when it performs magic.  Any act of 
will is magic.  Conversely, any act of conscious perception is also 
magic; an occurrence in nervous matter is spontaneously perceived in 
consciousness.  Sometimes that perception can occur directly 
without the use of senses, as in clairvoyance.

* Magic is not just confined to consciousness.  All events, including the
origin of the universe, happen basically by magic.  That is to say, they
arise spontaneously without a final prior cause.
                                                                153
* ...it is very difficult to imagine events arising spontaneously 
without prior cause even though this happens every time one exerts
one's will.  For this reason it has seemed preferrable to call this
root of phenomena Chaos.  
                                                                153
* Magical, mystical and religious enterprises seek to fulfill five
basic human needs, which can be identified as follows:

        To provide techniques of Emotional Engineering
        To give life a sense of Meaning
        To provide some means of Intercession and Intervention
        To supply an explanation of Death
        To formulate a Social Structure or Cult
                                                                179
* Private religion inevitably evolves into mysticism or magic, and
these have a tendency to devolve into new religions.
                                                                181
* [To the magician, spirit and matter] are both part of the same thing,
and he exalts neither above the other.  He rejects no part of his
experience.  The magician lives in a continuum beginning with the
sublime and ineffable Tao/God/Chaos through the mysterious and
subtle Aethers to the awesome and strange material world.  To the
magician, any piece of knowledge, any new power, any opportunity
for enlightenment is worth having for its own sake.  The only thing
abhorred in this incredible existence is failure to come to grips with
some part of it.  To be able to operate in all spheres, the magician
must master the art of either acting without belief or of being able
to invest belief temporarily in anything with which he is experimenting.
The magician should be equally at home with a crozier, a paintbrush,
a test tube, or a wand.  In all things he is seeking to bring his Kia
into manifestation; for him life is its own answer, and the way he lives
it in his spirituality.
                                                                181-182
* The magician should be capable of performing any ritual
on the astral, that is to say, by the power of imagination alone.
By strongly visualizing any of his weapons to the point where he
actually hallucinates their presence, he draws both the aetheric
form of the weapon and the associated powers within himself into
action.  Such empty-hand techniques are the mark of the adept.
                                                                189

$$Gnosis##

* [state of mind to be achieved/attained] 

* no-mind

* samadhi

* one-pointedness/one-pointed consciousness/single-pointed concentration

* stopping the inner dialogue

* passing through the eye of the needle

* ain or nothing

* It is an extension of the magical trance by other means.
                                                                31
* Certain forms of gnosis lend themselves more readily to some forms
of magic than others.

* ...the methods of exaltation.
                                                                35
* Gnosis is the mechanism by which Kia draws back from the flesh in
preparation for the mighty indulgences of magic.  A great saving to
accomplish a greater spending.
                                                                60
* Gnosis, the Alphabet of Desire, and other magical methods tend to
liberate.
                                                                90
* It is quite simple to state exactly what Gnosis is and how to reach
it.  Gnosis is intense consciousness of something, including the ideas
of self or nothingness.  Most extremes of emotionality (and not just
the nice emotions) can initiate it, and so can a profound act of single-
pointed concentration on something.  

*This intense consciousness leads mystics into three common errors.
It may create the illusion that oneself and the object of contemplation
are the same thing.  It may lead to the conviction that oneself no longer
exists, and it may lead to the obsession that the object of concentration
is the supreme thing in the universe.

* Magically, Gnosis is the state which most easily allows the will and
perception to reach out and touch realities beyond the mind.  The contents
of gnosis are far less interesting than what can be done with it.
                                                                122-123
