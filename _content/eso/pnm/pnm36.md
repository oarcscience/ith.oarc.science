### CHAPTER XXVII.

#### <span class="smallcaps">What Things Are Under the Power of Mars, and Are Called Martial</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">These</span> things are Martial: Amongst
Elements, fire, together with all adust and sharp things. Amongst
humors, choler; also bitter tastes, tart and burning the tongue, and
causing tears. Amongst metals, iron and red brass; and all fiery, red,
and sulphureous things. Amongst stones, the diamond, loadstone, the
bloodstone, the jasper, the stone that consists of divers kinds, and the
amethyst. Amongst plants and trees, hellebore, garlic, euphorbium,
castanea, ammoniac, radish, the laurel or sweet-bay, wolf's-bane,
scammony; and all such as are poisonous, by reason of too much heat, and
those which are beset, round about with prickles, or, by touching the
skin, burn it, prick it, or make it swell, as cardis, the nettle,
crow-foot and such as, being eaten, cause tears, as onions, ascolonia,
leeks, mustard-seed, and all thorny trees; and the dogwood-tree,

which is dedicated to Mars. And all such animals as are warlike,
ravenous, bold, and of clear fancy, as the horse, mule, goat, kid, wolf,
leopard, and wild ass. Serpents, also, and dragons, full of displeasure
and poison. Also all such as are offensive to men, as gnats, flies, and
the baboon, by reason of his anger. All birds that are ravenous, devour
flesh, and break bones, as the eagle, the falcon, the hawk, and the
vulture; and those which are called the fatal birds, as the horn-owl,
the screech-owl, castrels, and kites; and such as are hungry and
ravenous, and such as make a noise in their swallowing, as crows, daws,
and the pie, which, above all the rest, is dedicated to Mars. And
amongst fishes, the pike, the barbel, the fork-fish, the fish that hath
horns like a ram, the sturgeon, and the glacus, all which are great
devourers and ravenous.
