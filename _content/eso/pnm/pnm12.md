### CHAPTER III.

#### <span class="smallcaps">Of the Four Elements, Their Qualities, and Mutual Mixtions</span>.

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> are four Elements, and original
grounds of all corporeal things—Fire, Earth, Water, Air—of which all
elemented inferior bodies are compounded; not by way of heaping them up
together; but by transmutation and union; and when they are destroyed
they are resolved into Elements. For there is none of the sensible
Elements that is pure, but they are more or less mixed, and apt to be
changed one into the other: Even as Earth becoming dirty, and being
dissolved, becomes Water, and the same being made thick and hard,
becometh Earth again; but being evaporated through heat, passeth into
Air, and that being kindled, passeth into Fire; and this being
extinguished, returns back again into Air; but being cooled again after
its burning, becomes Earth, or Stone, or Sulphur, and this is manifested
by Lightning. Plato also was of that opinion, that Earth was wholly
changeable, and that the rest of the Elements are changed, as into this,
so into one another successively. But it is the opinion of the subtler
sort of Philosophers, that Earth is not changed, but relented and mixed
with other Elements, which do dissolve it, and that it returns back into
itself again. <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2) Now, every one of the
Elements hath two specifical qualities—the former whereof it

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

retains as proper to itself; in the other, as a mean, it agrees with
that which comes next after it. For Fire is hot and dry, the Earth dry
and cold, the Water cold and moist, the Air moist and hot. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[\*](#fn_3) And so after this manner the Elements,
according to two contrary qualities, are contrary one to the other, as
Fire to Water, and Earth to Air. Moreover, the Elements are upon another
account opposite one to the other: For some are heavy, as Earth and
Water, and others are light, as Air and Fire. Wherefore the Stoics
called the former *passives*, but the latter *actives*. And yet once
again, Plato distinguisheth them after another manner, and assigns to
every one of them three qualities, viz., to the Fire brightness,
thinness and motion, but to the Earth darkness, thickness and quietness.
And according to these qualities the Elements of Fire and Earth are
contrary. But the other Elements borrow their qualities from these, so
that the Air receives two qualities of the Fire, thinness and motion,
and one of the Earth, viz., darkness. In like manner Water receives two
qualities of the Earth, darkness and thickness, and one of Fire, viz.,
motion. But Fire is twice more thin than Air, thrice more movable, and
four times more bright; and the Air is twice more bright, thrice more
thin, and four times more movable than Water. Wherefore Water is twice
more bright than Earth, thrice more thin, and four times more
movable. <span id="fr_4"></span>[†](#fn_4) As therefore the Fire is to
the Air,

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

so Air is to the Water, and Water to the Earth; and again, as the Earth
is to the Water, so is the Water to the Air, and the Air to the Fire.
And this is the root and foundation of all bodies, natures, virtues and
wonderful works; and he which shall know these qualities of the
Elements, and their mixtions, shall easily bring to pass such things
that are wonderful, and astonishing, and shall be perfect in Magic.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_2"></span>[42:\*](pnm12.htm#fr_2) Agrippa teaches here and
in the chapter following that matter, or substance, however much its
elementary forms may change, is <span class="smallcaps">eternal</span>,
thus denying the dogma that God "created" all things "out of nothing."

<span id="fn_3"></span>[43:\*](pnm12.htm#fr_3) Tabularly stated:

As to these qualities—Fire is contrary to Water, and Earth to Air. This
exposition of the "qualities" astrologers should note, for while the
books give the same matter the "proper" and "mean" qualities are not
given.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[43:†](pnm12.htm#fr_4) The unity of the contrasts
between the four elements is here shown.
