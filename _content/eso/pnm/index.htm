<P>
This is an early 20th century edition of Agrippa's Philosophy of Natural
Magic, along with a wealth of background material.
Originally published in 1531-3, <CITE>De occulta philosophia libri tres</CITE>,
(Three books of Occult Philosophy) proposed that magic existed, and it
could be studied and used by devout Christians, as it was derived
from God, not the Devil.
Agrippa had a huge influence on Renaissance esoteric
philosophers, particularly Giordano Bruno.
</P>
<P>
While this is not a specialist edition, it will suffice
for the casual reader who doesn't want to wade through
Elizabethan typography and spelling, just enough of which
is preserved here for flavor.
A more comprehensive transcription is located
<A HREF="https://www.esotericarchives.com/agrippa/">here</a>.
This edition is a pastiche of a portion of a translation of Agrippas'
<CITE>libri tres</CITE> by an unidentified translator,
excerpts from a book on Agrippa by Henry Morley with extensive background,
and some self-promotional material by the publisher, de Lawrence, who
was a notorious pirate publisher.
This end material is of interest because it is a
good example of early 20th century American occult publishing.
