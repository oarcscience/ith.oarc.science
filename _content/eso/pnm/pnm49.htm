<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">We</span> have spoken concerning the virtues and wonderful efficacy of natural things. It remains now that we understand a thing of great wonderment&#8212;and it is a binding of men into love or hatred, sickness</p>

<p>or health, or such like. Also the binding of thieves and robbers, that they cannot steal in any place; the binding of merchants, that they cannot buy or sell in any place; the binding of an army, that they cannot pass over any bound; the binding of ships, that no winds, though never so strong, shall be able to carry them out of the haven. Also the binding of a mill, that it can by no force whatsoever be turned round; the binding of a cistern or fountain, that the water cannot be drawn up out of them; the binding of the ground, that it cannot bring forth fruit; the binding of any place, that nothing can be built upon it; the binding of fire, that though it be never so strong, can burn no combustible thing that is put to it. Also the bindings of lightnings and tempests, that they shall do no hurt; the binding of dogs, that they cannot bark; the binding of birds and wild beasts, that they shall not be able to fly or run away. And such like as these, which are scarce credible, yet often known by experience. Now, there are such kind of bindings as these made by sorceries, collyries, unguents, and love potions; by binding to or hanging up of things; by rings, by charms, by strong imaginations and passions, by images and characters, by enchantments and imprecations, by lights, by numbers, by, sounds, by words, and names, invocations, and sacrifices; by swearing, conjuring, consecrations, devotions, and by divers superstitions, and observations, and such like.</p>
