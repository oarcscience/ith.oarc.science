<p><small>Verily, in whom unwisdom is destroyed by the wisdom of the Self, in them, Wisdom, shining as the Sun, reveals the Supreme.&#151;<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bhagavad Gita</span>.</small></p>  
<p>Yoga is a subject which has enthralled the attention of the world from time out of mind. No one has hitherto done justice to such a grand system though there have been, now and then, innumerable attempts.</p>  
<p>The present author, my esteemed friend, Swami Mukerji, a Yogi who comes out of a successive generation of Yogis, is a fit and proper instrument to handle the subject. He, in these lessons prepares the layman for an understanding of the Yoga and, through a series of wise and masterful sayings, impresses on the mind of the reader the necessity for rising above materialism, nay, solves the very problem "What am I?"</p>  
<p>Every line is pregnant with mature thoughts and rivets one's attention, and makes him think, think, think.</p>  
<p>This is not a work for which an introduction, briefly setting forth the contents, could be written.</p>  
<p>I can but ask you to read, digest and improve.</p>
