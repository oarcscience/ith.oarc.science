### CHAPTER 33.

*Horace Traubel*.

<span class="smallcaps">Was</span> born December 19, 1858, and was
therefore in his thirty-first year at time of his first illumination.
His experience is here given in his own words. It is all of it full of
interest, but perhaps the most significant thing about it is the manner
the intelligence of it was received by Walt Whitman, whose matter of
fact, simple words, "I knew it would come to you," carry a depth of
meaning quite out of the common. H. T. tells the story of his awakening
in this colloquial and direct way, in answer to the inquiries of the
editor:

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

You are quite familiar with the path of my spiritual development—with
the course taken by my mental self in arriving at its present state. You
know I have come to my own, whatever that may be, mostly by immediate
contact with experience rather than through books, though I have read in
books of the most miscellaneous character and at one period in appalling
numbers. But, somehow, the scholar in me never seems to have obscured
the man. I suppose my intenser early reading was in Emerson, Carlyle,
Hugo and whatever else I could get hold of having to do with the world
of myth and the ante-Christian Scriptures of the race. I do not seem to
have known a time when I have not read "Leaves of Grass." But previous
to May, 1889, I do not seem to have got that (in a sense) final grasp of
its mystery which now imparts to it its primary and supernatural
significance. May, 1889. Then, again, two years later, 1891. A third
time, 1893 or 4, on the historic night (historic to me).

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

when circumstance made me the spokesman of the dissentient group of
Ethicist in Philadelphia, on the occasion of the split of the Ethical
Society there. May, 1889. That overwhelming night, as I leaned over the
railing of the ferryboat, lost this world for another, and in the
anguish and joy of a few minutes saw things heretofore withheld from me
revealed. Those who have had such an encounter will understand what this
means, others will not, or will perhaps only realize it by intimation. I
could not separate the physical and spiritual of that moment. My
physical body went through the experience of a disappearance in
spiritual light. All severe lines in the front of phenomena relaxed. I
was one with God, Love, the Universe, arrived at last face to face with
myself. I was sensible of peculiar moral and mental disturbances and
readjustments. There was an immediateness to it all—an indissoluble
unity of the several energies of my being in one force. I was no more
boating it on a river than winging it in space or taking star leaps, a
traveler from one to another on the peopled orbs. While I stood there
the boat had got into the slip and was almost ready to go out again. A
deckhand who knew me came up and tapped me on the shoulder. "Don't you
intend going off the boat?" he asked. And he added when I faced him and
said "Yes:" "You look wonderfully well and happy to-night, Mr. Traubel."
I did not see Walt till the next day, evening. In the meantime I had
lived through twenty-four hours of ecstasy mixed with some doubts as to
whether I had not had a crack in the skull and gone mad rather than
fallen under some light and made a discovery. But the first words Walt
addressed to me when I sallied into his room were reassuring: "Horace,
you have the look of great happiness on your face to-night. Have you had
a run of good luck?" I sat down and tried in a few words to indicate
that I had had a run of good luck, though not perhaps the good luck he
had in mind for me at the moment. He did not seem at all surprised at
what I told him, merely remarking, as he put his hand on my shoulder and
looked into my eyes: "I knew it would come to you." I suggested: "I have
been wondering all day if I am not crazy." He laughed gravely: "No,
sane. Now at last you are sane."

It was a month before the immediate effect of this experience wore off.
The reflex effect was of course fixed. I can say now (writing 1901) that
from that day to this I have never known one moment of despair
concerning my spiritual relations to man and the universe. I have my
earth troubles and my earth foibles. But the essential faith is
adamantine. I have never had any suspicion of immortality. The glimpse
of that minute—and of the repeated experiences on the two after
occasions mentioned above—into the eternal law left no blot or
qualification. I had often said before, in speaking of Whitman (making
in a way a true guess): "Whitman's notion of immortality is not one of
logic but is pictorial. He does not believe in immortality. He *sees*
it." Many times Whitman had said to me regarding that explanation: "It
is every word true. You hit the nail on the head." Now I knew better
than I had before—not only better but in a way I could not have known
before—what I myself meant when I used the expression: "Whitman *sees*."
I see around and through phenomena. Phenomena is never a wall or a veil.
I have been

</div>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

able to do my work as never before. It has brought me friends and the
cheer of sympathetic greetings from all parts of the world. One feature
of my writing I ought to mention. I think I told you long ago that I
become in effect automatic when I am engaged in any serious composition.
I do not seem to write. The writing seems done through me. I take up my
pen and hardly know what I write. After I have written I am often
surprised at the things I have said. They are as new to me as to any
reader. All the writing which has brought me any
returns—congratulations—has been done in that mood.

On the night of the Ethical split I was in a position which forced me to
be the main spokesman of the party of freedom. I made a speech upon
which my enemies even more than my friends congratulated me. Yet when I
got on my feet on the floor and plunged into talk I was instantly
immersed in the strange light which had visited me on the first
experience and simply uttered without thought or reason, formally
speaking, the words of the mightier power that possessed me. I have
found since that on occasions of crisis I have merely to throw myself
back again on this resource to discover that every strength—spiritually
speaking—it imparted once it imparts again. In my very busy life, which
has its temporal distresses, this is more than a balance in bank and
contributes more than any ephemera of material prosperity could towards
my victories: in fact is the first and last letter of my power. When the
little affairs of every day seem most mixed up, most to be past
solution, I am sure finally to make my escape by the avenue of these
ameliorating revelations. Not once has the spirit deserted me—not once
has the light, in some degree of its radiance, not always of course in
full power, failed to appear. The difference it makes in one's life is
the difference between preparation and consummation. On the occasion of
my second experience (April, 1891), which was not outwardly momentous, I
found that my initial self suspicion—my question, Am I unbuilt or
built?—did not reappear.

If you take my verse "Illumination" \[and a great deal of H. T.'s verse
and prose written since that year\], and try to get it statistically
languaged, you will find that I have expressed a series of experiences
of profound significance to all who have been similarly blessed. I find
that my members are no longer at war with each other. When I was a
youngster I read my way vigorously and sympathetically back especially
into Oriental literature of the religious class blazed a path for the
spirit. After 1889 (a hiatus in such reading having intervened) I found
myself driven into that old world again, to review these my original
impressions. The new light had made my voyage easier and more richly
endowed its fruits. Once I felt that religions were all of them
religions of despair: now I saw that no religion despairs—that all
religion before it becomes and as soon as it ceases to be an affair of
institutions resolves itself essentially into light and immortality.

I should perhaps say that it has invariably happened that someone—and
sometimes many persons—have commented to me, and felicitated me, upon my
appearance, upon the occasions of my direct contact with what I have
grown to call my subliminal self. This may mean much or nothing. But no
one could

</div>

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

live through what I do at such periods and not in some way outwardly
give it witness.

You have said to me: "State this thing in plain prose." But how can I? I
could never state it in the prose that would be understood by one who
has not shared my sensations. I could never state it in words which
would not make it, if you please, prose to those who can enter
collaterally into the channels of its august revelation. After asking
you: How can I? I have shown you how I could.

Some things I have said may seem to savor of egotism. But they are
simply candid. I am not measuring myself as a genius or an idiot, but as
a simple third person whose word and career must be to himself absolute
law. I have written you this memorandum impulsively, with no attempt to
dress it up, if, indeed, until now it is done, and now I have read it,
with any actual understanding of what my pen would commit me to or
confess.

The following poem was written by Horace Traubel shortly after his
illumination and of course strictly belongs here:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<div style="margin-left: 32px;font-size:90%;color: blue;">

The nights, the days, hold me in thrall,  
Toils of men and women drag my faith to the earth—  
Furrowed with pain, the casual cares,  
I long—I look—I reach forth to life.

Release! Escape!  
Shall I speak of the door swung wide, of the unbarred gates?

After the vigil I step across the border-line,  
I take my place with the pioneers.

Have I met the hour patiently, without fear, at the portal?  
Now is my name called, now the lip of my love has spoken:  
Do I mistake you, O divine Signaler? is it after all some other soul
that is hailed?  
My self is my answer:  
There's that in my heart responds, meeting the call with equal voice,
establishing forever the unspeakable bond!

Bond that does not bind—bond that frees—bond that discovers and bestows.

Look! I am flushed with inexhaustible possessions!  
The old measures vanish, I am expanded to infinite sweep.

O world! Not dead to you—only seeing you, knowing you, at last,  
Mixed with countless worlds, knowing with you your companions also:

O year! Not dead to you—only seeing you, knowing you, at last,  
Mixed with all time, untangling the knotted thread: <span
id="page_349">p. 349</span>

O world! O year!—  
Before birth seeing birth, after life seeing life!

The infinite blue, heaven's fond eye, opens upon me.

O voice, mastering me, making me too master—  
My ear is close, I hear the syllables fall,  
Waves on shores of the farther worlds, waves on shores of the day.

The clouds part: O face—O face—O face!—  
Face smiling upon me—smiling me wings, buoyant beyond the discarded
cheapened present.

(You, too, O present, still remaining,  
Duly visiting my heart, not forbidden,  
Yet yielding the place supreme).

I am all eye—O God! you are all speech:  
Melody celestial—sight and voice, color and tone, warring no more,  
In the boundless blue uplifted.

Whose hand touches me?—my brow—my breast—my own unasking hand—  
Leading me out of self to self?

Divine form—mother, father—sex only now standing revealed, the union
irreversible:  
Divine form, I made whole in you,  
The elements diverse here blended.

This minute grown infinite, the far worlds spread before me,  
The endless drift of soul, the long stretch of faces, all lit by the
divine sun—  
Or swift or slow or early or late the line not anywhere broken,  
All—all—equally sustained, swept in the same destiny, on sea and land of
life,  
The peak lit for all, the triumph inevitable.

O my soul! look yet again:  
There too are you, a figure in the panorama,  
On your brow the dawn has set its beauteous beam,  
Here with me—there not with me.

Death fills me with its abundance.  
What is this flood, overcoming body and sense?  
I feel the walls of my skull crack, the barriers part, the sun-flood
enter—  
Love, lore, not lost, only magnified, floating eternal seas of
essence—  
Before and behind births and deaths, spiritual gravitation, the
emergence ever-more expanding. <span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

O soul, have I lost you or found you?  
Found! the faultless circle born at last to you,  
After the waiting years.

Far eras behind, far eras ahead, the simple few years I finger,  
Shafts from the central sun,  
Speeding for fuller fruition the orbs of space.

Back to the first word of speech,  
On to the last utterance of seers,  
My soul, knowing its own, wrapt in its protean habit, catches the
perfect song.

God! I am circled—I am drunk with the influx of life—  
Wheeled in your orbit—given the word I would speak yet must withhold—  
Leaving you, O my brother, each one, to say it for yourself.

Brothers, worlds, I greet you!  
The wheel turns, the boundless prospect opens:  
All, all complicate—the light bearing limitlessly the burdens of all.  
Do you think that you are missed, that the large heart beats not for
you?  
That somewhere on the road you must faint and die?  
Strength will be given for all your need,  
And the weakest, when the night comes which is the day,  
Will greet the king, a giant in stature and grace.

Now the immortal years, the ceaseless round realized—  
The doubts shorn of wing and foot,  
The farthest league nearest, and the multiplied infinities choking here
in my breast.

O my questioner! you do not suspect me—you suspect yourself:  
To-morrow, seeing yourself, you will see me,  
And the illumined spirit, passing the portal,  
God-grown, will hail me proudly \[60a:40\].

Had we no other writings by this man, these lines alone to all who can
understand them—and they are as clear as day from the point of view of
this volume—would be proof of illumination. But we have much else. A
series of writings in prose and verse extending over the last ten years
gives us more evidence than is needed.

Then there is something else to say. Horace Traubel (as he intimates
himself in his own words, above) belongs with Blake, Yepes, Behmen,
Swedenborg and others, in the class of what may

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

be called automatic writers. These men give their inspiration free
way—they drop the reins on his neck and let the horse go. What they
write under the divine impulse, for those who can follow their thought,
is divine, but to those who can not, is, as Paul says, juit in this
connection, "foolishness."

Perhaps all these men write automatically, but, in the case of some of
them, the expression as it flows from the Cosmic Sense, or as afterwards
modified by the self conscious intellect, is more intelligible to the
"natural man" than in the case of others. In not one of them does the
meaning lie on the surface—they all call for and demand long continued
and thoughtful reading. Whitman and Paul are just as unintelligible as
Behmen or Swedenborg, until the right point of view is reached, although
Whitman (for his part) wrought his whole life, "returning upon (his)
poems, lingering long," in order to render them absorbable by the race.

Horace Traubel has not escaped the curse of his tribe—unintelligibility.
But in spite of it he has produced his effect. And this is the strangest
thing of all—that it should be possible for a man to speak or write what
cannot be understood, but to do it in such a divine way that his words
shall be revered and remembered through the ages. The "Shakespeare"
Sonnets have never been understood, and are yet accepted for what they
really are—a revelation.

Horace Traubel has many readers who understand him, and even those who
do not comprehend him fully are impressed by his personality, through
which streams unmistakably the divine light.
