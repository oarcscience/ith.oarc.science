#### Directions for Ordering

Write name of Books desired, plainly and fully.

Write plainly your name, street address (if in city); town or city; and
state. Don't forget the state, as there are many towns of the same name
in the country—yours is only one of many.

Send money by Post Office Money Order, or Express Money Order, or
Registered Letter. This is the only Safe Way. If Personal Checks are
sent add 10c extra for exchange.

Write your own name and address on the upper left hand corner of the
envelope (this saves many lost letters).
