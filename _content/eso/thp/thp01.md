The Hidden Power, by Thomas Troward \[1921\], at Intangible Textual
Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PUBLISHER'S NOTE

The material comprised in this volume has been selected from unpublished
manuscripts and magazine articles by Judge Troward, and "The Hidden
Power" is, it is believed, the last book which will be published under
his name. Only an insignificant portion of his work has been deemed
unworthy of permanent preservation. Whenever possible, dates have been
affixed to these papers. Those published in 1902 appeared originally in
"EXPRESSION; A Journal of Mind and Thought," in London, and to some of
these have been added notes made later by the author.

The Publishers wish to acknowledge their indebtedness to Mr. Daniel M.
Murphy of New York for his services in the selection and arrangement of
the material.
