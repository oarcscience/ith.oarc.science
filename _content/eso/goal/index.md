Hiram Butler, a 19th Century American occultist best known (if at all)
for the book [Solar Biology](../../astro/sb/index), started the Esoteric
Society in Boston in the late 1880s. He fled Boston in 1891 after a
murky dispute with the better-known Theosophical Society. He ended up in
Applegate, California, a small town on the outskirts of Auburn in the
Sierra foothills. The Esoteric Society was set up on land purchased from
Leland Stanford in 1892, and Butler and a handful of disciples lived
there. Later the Society had to change names to the Esoteric Fraternity
for legal reasons.

This book is Butler's description of the entire spiritual evolution of
humanity. Based on a mystical vision of Christianity, Butler thought
that an invisible 'Order of Melchisedek,' 288,000 strong (144,000
male-female couples) would eventually be able to transcend the
limitations of physical reality and become as 'Elohim,' the plural
components of God. He also brings into the mix other parts of his
world-view, including his simplified version of Astrology, and many
ideas similar to those promoted by [New Thought](../../nth/index).

Butler is practically unknown today but he had a huge influence on
vernacular occult writing in America, particularly the popular Yogi
Publication Society (YPS) books authored by William Atkinson, who was
known to quote Butler on occasion.<span class="small">--J.B. Hare, May
