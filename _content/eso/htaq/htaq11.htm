<p>The secret Brotherhoods which formed the splendour of Egypt taught that   life itself is the great Initiator, and the Qabalah, from which the Wisdom of   the Egyptian Hierophants was derived, enjoined upon its students to   "store the melody of life in their hearts" and to learn from it all   that is needful.</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>  </div>

<p>The Light Eternal comes from the bosom of God and shines in the eyes of every good man. It illuminates the face and lends a gentle touch to its expression and features. It is wholly absent in the countenance of the ungodly and no effort of theirs will imitate it. It is a gift from the good God to the children of light, and he bestows it upon them as a mark of his special affection.</p>  
<p>Blessed be the man in whom this light has been lighted, for he will never lack anything needful, and even the wrath of his enemies will work goad for him. It is the light which the Prophets spoke of, and the Patriarchs desired so very much. It is the priceless pearl which it is well worth while to search after. Seek it, O Man! but not outside thee.</p>
