### REGENERATION ACCORDING TO THE QABALAH

There is a beautiful passage in the Qabalah which explains the process
of regeneration in nature. I cannot quote it verbatim, but it is to the
effect that whenever any substance in Nature is to be renewed and
regenerated, the negative or chemical force of light assumes the reins
and increases the force of repulsion within the atom so that it subdues
its opponent—attraction, and the atom is repelled and separated from its
neighbour atoms.

When the positive or polar forces of light again asserts its power and
increases the attraction, the atom acquires new affinities, and a new
substance is formed. This happens to physical-plane atoms and to
spiritual-plane ones as well. The thoughtful student will grasp the
analogy between the two realms of nature and understand many things
suggested so forcibly by this illustration.

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

Is it not the same with the individual soul when the time arrives for it
to renew its substance and to be regenerated? Is not the passionate,
impulsive nature, the lustful flesh, wishing to do the things that
grieve the Spirit, the very principle of repulsion broken loose and
overbalancing the attractive power of the spiritual atom?

What a lesson for us to be kind and patient and forgiving to those in
whom sin and sense are still ruling! How it teaches us to see in those
who have fallen only our younger brothers and sisters in whom a natural
process is going on; yea, sometimes they may he our elders upon whom
nature is just putting the finishing touch. As soon as the centripetal
power of attraction again asserts itself in them, they may become the
Helpers of their kind, Leaders and Benefactors of the race, using their
experiences for the good of their unfortunate fellow-brothers and
fellow-sisters.
