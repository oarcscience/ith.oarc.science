### FOREWORD

This is the first attempt ever made to present the teachings of the
great Tibetan sage, Tilak.

The teachings of Tilak find their source in the Ancient Wisdom—teachings
that are ever passed from mentor to pupil.

On parchment leaves Tilak inscribed his occult experiences, and relates
his remarkable association with the Invisible Hierarchy.

Tilak's great writings will be a revelation to all seeking light on
life's enigma during these turbulent times.
