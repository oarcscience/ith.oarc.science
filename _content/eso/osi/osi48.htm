<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> conclusion, we can only repeat the words of our preface:</p>  
<p>"It is not our office to decide, either for or against, the belief in spirits, whether <i>mediating</i> or <i>inspiring</i>."</p>  
<p>Our aim is merely to give an account of the philosophical and spiritualistic tenets of the Brahmins, as well as of the external phenomena and manifestations which are, according to them, the means whereby the Pitris, or ancestral shades, demonstrate their existence and communicate with men.</p>  
<p>All ancient religions, and even Christianity itself, acknowledge the existence of extraordinary beings, who have a special part to perform in the continuous movement of creation. All teach that man, upon laying aside his present earthly envelope, enters the superior world in the state of a spirit.</p>  
<p>The constant perfectibility of the soul, and the spiritual life&#151;that is their common philosophical idea.</p>  
<p>As for the phenomena and manifestations, which are claimed to be supernatural, we also find them to be an outgrowth of this belief, both in the temples of India, Chaldea, and Egypt, and in the catacombs to which the early Christians fled for shelter.</p>  
<p>We refrain from making any positive statement as to the possibility or not of the extraordinary phenomena performed by the Fakirs, as we have described them, which some attribute to the adroitest imposture and others to occult intervention, but leave the reader to judge for himself.</p>
