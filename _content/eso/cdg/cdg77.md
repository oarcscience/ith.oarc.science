### FIFTH PROPHECY.

### ELDER EDDA

### PROPHECY OF WORLD PEACE AND RETURN OF THE ANCIENT WISDOM.

"The bond shall be broken, the Wolf <span
id="fr_227"></span>[1](#fn_227) run free; hidden things I know; still
onward I see the great Doom of the Powers, the gods of war.

I see uprising a second time earth from the ocean, green anew; the
waters fall, on high the eagle flies o’er the fell and catches fish.

The gods are gathered on the Fields of Labour; they speak concerning the
great World Serpent, <span id="fr_228"></span>[2](#fn_228) and remember
there things of former fame and the Mightiest God's old mysteries. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[3](#fn_229)

Then shall be found the wondrous-seeming golden tables hid in the grass,
those they had used in days of yore. <span
id="fr_230"></span>[4](#fn_230)

And there unsown shall the fields bring forth; all harm shall be healed;
Baldr <span id="fr_231"></span>[5](#fn_231) (the Saviour) will come--Höd
(the Adversary) and Baldr shall dwell in Val-hall, at peace the war
gods.--Would ye know further, and what? . . . Comes from on high to the
great Assembly the Mighty Ruler <span id="fr_232"></span>[6](#fn_236)
who orders all. Fares from beneath a dim dragon flying, a glistening
snake from the Moonless Fells.

### INTERPRETATION ELDER EDDA PROPHECY.

THE WOLF.--"Fenrir or Fenrisúlfer. The monster-wolf. The gods put him in
chains, where he remains until Ragnarok (the last day). In Ragnarok he
gets loose, *and* swallows the sun . . . " <span
id="fr_233"></span>[\*](#fn_232) The Fenris Wolf symbolises the Super
Solar Force operative for the regeneration of mankind when the Sun
behind the Sun <span id="fr_234"></span>[†](#fn_233) is in conjunction
at the end of the age with the Sun of our own Solar system. Hence the
Wolf is said to run free in the last day, and to swallow the Sun.

<span id="fn_228"></span>[319:2](cdg77.htm#fr_228) THE GREAT WORLD
SERPENT.--All-Father "threw the serpent into that deep ocean by which
the earth is encircled. But the monster has grown to such an enormous
size, that holding his tail in his mouth he engirdles the whole
earth." <span id="fr_235"></span>[‡](#fn_234) The serpent is the Solar
Force <span id="fr_236"></span>[§](#fn_235) manifesting ungoverned in
the unpurified lower nature of man during the present cycle of
evolution.

<span id="fn_229"></span>[319:3](cdg77.htm#fr_229) THE MIGHTIEST GOD'S
OLD MYSTERIES.--The ancient Wisdom shall be given anew to the world by
those who guide its evolution.

<span id="fn_230"></span>[319:4](cdg77.htm#fr_230) GOLDEN TABLES HID IN
THE GRASS.--The Solar Flame or Spirit evolving in man shall bring back
to his consciousness the books of his lost remembrance.

<span id="fn_231"></span>[319:5](cdg77.htm#fr_231) BALDR.--"Balder,
again, the White God, the beautiful, the just and benignant (whom the
early Christian Missionaries found to resemble Christ)."

THE MIGHTY RULER.--The Christ Ray or Paraclete of which Baldr is the
supreme manifestation on earth, and the Fenris Wolf or regenerative
force its cosmic expression. This is a ray of the Divine Consciousness
operative on this planet when the Sun behind the Sun is in conjunction
with the Sun of our Solar System. At this time the vital energy or Solar
Force tends to be balanced by Spiritual energy or Super Solar Force, and
the spirit of man seeks anew its Divine Source.
