### FOURTH PROPHECY.

### MICAH'S PROPHECY OF WORLD PEACE AND FREEDOM OF RELIGION.

But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the
house of the Lord shall be established in the top of the mountains, and
it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it.

And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up to the
mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will
teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall
go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.

And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar
off; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears
into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up a sword against nation,
neither shall they learn war any more.

But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and
none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath
spoken it.

*For all people will walk every one in the name of his god*, and we walk
in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. <span
