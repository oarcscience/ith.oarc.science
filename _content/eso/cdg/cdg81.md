### JUSTICE.

### ISRAELS' PROPHECY OF JUSTICE.

Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before
me: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even
the messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in: behold, he shall
come, saith the Lord of hosts.

But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand when he
appeareth? for *he is like a refiner's fire*, and like fullers' soap:

And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he shall
purify the sons of Levi, <span id="fr_265"></span>[\*](#fn_264) and
purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an
offering in justice. <span id="fr_266"></span>[†](#fn_265)

Then shall the offerings of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the
Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.

And I will come near to you to judgement; . . . .

But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of Justice t arise with
healing in his wings;-<span class="small">MALACHI iii, 1-5, iv,
