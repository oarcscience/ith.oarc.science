### MASTER DEFINED.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_UU">UU</span></span>A Master is an
evolved being who has perfected a mental body <span
id="fr_216"></span>[†](#fn_216) in which he can function consciously
while out of his physical vehicle. A Master, through that degree of
Divine Force <span id="fr_217"></span>[\*](#fn_217) which his
rapidly-evolving Solar Body enables him to contact, has power to
understand and to apply many of the laws governing the so-called
phenomena of Nature.

Dante Alighieri makes mention of his first meeting with his Master in
these words, "for there appeared to be in my room a mist of the colour
of fire, within the which I discerned the figure of a lord of terrible
aspect to such as should gaze upon him, but who seemed therewithal to
rejoice inwardly that it was a marvel to see. Speaking he said many
things, among the which I could understand but few; and of these, this:
*Ego dominus tuus* (I am thy Master)." <span class="small">LA VITA
NUOVA. TRANSLATED BY DANTE GABRIEL ROSSETTI.</span>
