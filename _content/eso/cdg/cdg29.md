### KING SAUL.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_S">S</span></span>Now Samuel was
dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in
his own city. Then said Saul unto his servants, "Seek me a woman that
hath a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her." And
his servants said to him, "Behold, there is a woman that hath a familiar
spirit at En-dor." And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment,
and he went. Then said the woman, "Whom shall I bring up unto thee?" And
he said, "Bring me up Samuel." And Samuel said to Saul, "Why hast thou
disquieted me, to bring me up?" And Saul answered, "I am sore
distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed
from me, and answereth me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:
therefore I have called thee, that thou mayest make known unto me what I
shall do." Then said Samuel, "Wherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing
the Lord is departed from thee, and is become thine enemy? Moreover the
Lord will also deliver Israel with thee into the hand of the
Philistines: and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me: the Lord
also shall deliver the host of Israel into the hand of the Philistines."
