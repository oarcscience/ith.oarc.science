In the third place, contact is necessary, according to which we touch the divine essence with the summit of our soul, and verge to a union with it. But there is yet farther required, an approximating adhesion: for thus the oracle calls it, when it says, <i>the mortal approximating to fire will possess a light from the Gods</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> For this imparts to us a greater communion with, and a more manifest participation of the light of the Gods.</p>

And this is the best end of true prayer, in order that the conversion of the soul may be conjoined with its permanency, and that everything which proceeds from <i>the one</i> of the Gods, may again be established in <i>the one</i>, and the light which is in us may be comprehended in the light of the Gods. Prayer therefore, is no small part of the</p>

<p>All nations likewise, that have excelled in wisdom, have diligently applied themselves to prayer."</p>
