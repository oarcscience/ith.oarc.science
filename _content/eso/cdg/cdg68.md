### ZEDEKIAS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_EEE">EEE</span></span>A Jewish
physician who lived in the ninth century. He was greatly in favour with
the Emperor Charles the Bald, whose medical attendant he had been. He is
said, further more, to have been so great a wizard that once in the
presence of the court he ate a whole load of hay, together with the
driver and the horses; that at other times he flew around in the air and
played other such juggling tricks. <span class="small">TRANSLATED FROM
ZEDLER, UNIVERSAL LEXICON.</span>
