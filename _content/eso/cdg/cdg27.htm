<p><span class="margnote"><FONT COLOR="GREEN" SIZE="-1"><A NAME="an_Q">Q</A></FONT></span>"Now that <i>Osiris</i> is really the same with Bacchus, nobody can be supposed to know better than you, <i>O Clea</i>, not only as you are chief of his priestesses at <i>Delphi</i>, but moreover as you are initiated, in right of both your parents, into the service and religion of <i>Osiris</i>--As others, however, may not be so well satisfied in this point; to omit the evidence which may be brought in proof of it from those more secret rites which are not to be divulged, do not those very cere- monies, which the priests perform in public, when</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A></p>  
<p>they carry the <i>Apis</i> on a raft to his funeral, correspond entirely with what we see done in the festivals of <i>Bacchus?</i> They hang round them the skins of hinds, they carry javelins in their hands crowned with ivy, make the same sort of howlings, and use the same kind of gesticulations as the votaries of <i>Bacchus</i> are wont to do, whilst they are celebrating the orgies of their God. Hence likewise is it, that so many of the Greeks, in their statues of <i>Bacchus</i>, have given him <i>the visage of an ox;</i> that the women of <i>Elis</i> in their prayers to him, call upon the <i>God with the oxe's feet</i> to come unto them; and that the people of <i>Argos</i> not only give him the appellation of <i>Ox-begotten</i>, but likewise invoke him, and endeavour to raise him from his watry dwelling by the sound of the trumpet, throwing at the same time a lamb into the deep, as a kind of fee to the porter, who keeps the door of the infernal regions for letting him pass: these trumpets are concealed by them under boughs of ivy, as <i>Socrates</i> relates in his treatise concerning the <i>Delphic Hosii</i>--So again, the histories upon which the most solemn feasts of <i>Bacchus</i>, the <i>Titania</i> and <i>Nuktelia</i>, are founded, do they not exa&amp;ly correspond with what we are told of the cutting in pieces of <i>Osiris</i>, of his rising again, and of his new life? Nor does what relates to his burial any way contradict this notion; for whilst the Egyptians, as has been already observed, show many places as the sepulchres of their <i>Osiris</i>, the <i>Delphians</i> pretend that</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_235"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 235</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the relics of <i>Bacchus</i> are deposited with them, and that they lye near the oracle.: and in consequence of this opinion, the <i>Hosii</i>, or priests appointed for that purpose, perform a secret sacrifice in the temple of <i>Apollo</i>, whilst at the same time the <i>Thyades</i>, or priestesses of <i>Bacchus</i>, with their hymns endeavour to raise their God, whom they at that time distinguish by the name of the <i>Winnower</i>. Now that the Greeks themselves do not look upon <i>Bacchus</i> as the Lord or President of wine only, but of all kind of humidity in general, may be sufficiently proved from the testimony of <i>Pindar</i>, where he says "may bountiful <i>Bacchus</i>, the bright glory of the year, make all my trees fruitful;" thus likewise the votaries of <i>Osiris</i> are expressly forbidden to destroy any fruit-tree, or to mar any springs of water.</p>  
<p>But to resume a while our former argument concerning the identity of <i>Bacchus</i> and <i>Osiris;</i> as a farther proof of this point, we may mention the <i>Ivy</i>, which as it is esteemed by the Greeks sacred to <i>Bacchus</i>, so is it likewise stiled by the Egyptians, in their language, <i>Chenosiris</i>, that is, as some interpret it, <i>the plant of Osiris</i>. In like manner <i>Aristo</i>, who wrote a treatise of the Athenian Colonies, tells us, he somewhere met with an epistle of <i>Alexarchus</i>, wherein <i>Bacchus</i> was expressly said to have been the son of Isis, and to heve been named by the Egyptians not <i>Osiris</i>, but <i>Asiris</i>, with an A; a word, in the language of that country, signifying <i>strong and mighty:</i> and this is farther</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_236"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 236</FONT></A></p>  
<p>confirmed by the testimony . of <i>Hermaeus</i>, who, in his first book concerning the Egyptians, gives us a similar explication of the name <i>Osiris</i> himself. . . . there is no need of any other evidence than that I have formerly made use of, drawn from the similarity, which may be observed, between the festivals and. sacred rites of these two Gods, a proof much more strong and convincing than any authorities whatever can be."</p>
