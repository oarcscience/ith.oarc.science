### LORD OF BAVARIA.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_CCC">CCC</span></span>"Sabine in his
comment on the I oth of Ovid's Metamorphoses, at the tale of Orpheus,
telleth us of a gentleman of Bavaria, that for many months together
bewailed the loss of his dear wife; at length the Devil in her habit
came and comforted him, and told him, because he was so importunate for
her, that she would come and live with him again, on that condition he
would be new married, never swear and blaspheme as he used formerly to
do; for if he did, she should be gone: he vowed it, married, and lived
with her, she brought him children, and governed his house, but was
still pale and sad, and so continued, till one day falling out with him,
he fell a swearing; she vanished thereupon, and was never after seen.
This I have heard, saith Sabine, from persons of good credit, which told
me that the Duke of Bavaria did tell it for a certainty to the Duke of
Saxony."
