### THIRD PROPHECY.

### ENOCH'S PROPHECY OF WORLD PEACE AND THE GIVING FORTH OF BOOKS.

"And now I know this mystery, that sinners will alter and pervert the
words of righteousness in many ways, and will speak wicked words, and
lie, and practise great deceits, <span id="fr_224"></span>[\*](#fn_224)
and write books concerning their words. <span
id="fr_225"></span>[†](#fn_225)

But when they write down truthfully all my words in their languages, and
do not change or minish ought from my words but write them all down
truthfully--all that I first testified concerning them,

Then, I know another mystery, that books shall be given to the righteous
and the wise to become a cause of joy and uprightness and much wisdom.

And to them shall the books be given, and they shall believe in them and
rejoice over them, and then shall all the righteous who have learnt
therefrom all the paths of righteousness be recompensed.

In those days the Lord bade (them) to.summon and testify to the children
of earth concerning their wisdom: Show (it) unto them; for ye are their
guides, and a recompense over the whole earth.

For I and My Son will be united with them for ever in the paths of
uprightness in their lives; and ye shall have peace: rejoice, ye
children of uprightness. <span id="fr_226"></span>[‡](#fn_226) Amen."
