### SAMBETHE, DAUGHTER OF NOAH.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_W">W</span></span>The theologian's
opinion that the most ancient of the Sibyls was the daughter of Noah is
based upon the following internal evidence of the Sibylline Books. "'O
the great Joy that I had when I escap’d the great Destruction, when my
Husband with me, and his Brothers, and Father, and Mother, and their
Daughters-in-law, suffer’d much by being long toss’d by the Flood!'"
(BOOK I.) <span id="fr_177"></span>[\*](#fn_177) and "'for when the
World was drowned, and only one Man of worth was left in his wooden
House, swimming on the Waters with the wild and tame Beasts, that the
World might replenish again by them; I was his Daughter-in-Law, and of
his Blood.'" (BOOK III.) <span id="fr_178"></span>[†](#fn_178) SIR JOHN
FLOYER, KNIGHT, "THE SIBYLLINE ORACLES." LONDON, 1713.
