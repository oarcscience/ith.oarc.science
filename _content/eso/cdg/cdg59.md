### ROMAN WORSHIP OF A SUPREME DEITY WITHOUT IMAGE OR STATUE.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_VV">VV</span></span>"Numa forbade
the Romans to represent the Deity in the form either of man or beast.
Nor was there among them formerly any image or statue of the Divine
Being; during the first hundred and seventy years they built temples,
indeed, and other sacred domes, but placed in them no figure of any
kind: persuaded that it is impious to represent things divine by what is
perishable, and that we can have no conception of God but by the
understanding." <span class="small">PLUTARCH, LIFE OF NUMA.</span>
