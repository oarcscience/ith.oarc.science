### DIVINE POWER OF LETTERS.

<span class="margnote"><span id="an_U">U</span></span>The sacred
significance of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet is paralleled by that
attached to those of the Sanskrit alphabet as used in the Sacred
Writings of India.

"The god said--'Out of the will-power of the Supreme Being there
originated a force whose exponents are the fifteen letters of the
alphabet and from whom the universe has subsequently emanated. By
worshipping that force, O goddess, I have come to know of all the
knowables and I shall presently discuss the congery of Mantras that have
arisen out of the five principal ones composed of the above said
letters. These Mantras, O goddess, are the life and soul of all other
Mantras. They form the back bone as it were, of the Vedas, Rik, Sam,
Yajur, and the Arthava. The Mantras known as the Sadyajatas, etc., are
but the different combinations of the abovesaid forms revealed in the
phonetic energy of the abovesaid five letters (Mantras). Through them
the gods such as Brahma, Vishnu, and Rudra, etc., have come into being.
They are identical with the gods called Isha, Saptashikha,

etc. The vowels A.E.I.O.U. are but the five phases of the supreme god
head (Brahma). . . . . Oh Brahman, as fire potentially lying in the
bosom of firewood remains invisible unless kindled in the proper way, so
the divine energy (Shiva-Shakti) lies latent in the body of a man quite
in the dark about its very existence even." "THE WEALTH OF INDIA," VOL.
