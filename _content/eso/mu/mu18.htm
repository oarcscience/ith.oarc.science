<p>During the 30-day program of revelations and recommendations prepared by The International Institute of Universal Research and Administration, each of the Research Department's discoveries and perfected inventions,&#151;to which we have made reference in this bulletin,&#151;will not only be fully described, but will also be offered without cost to those of the human race who associate with The Universal Service Corporation and who will thereby consent to their "equal use," and to the equal unprejudiced distribution of the products and benefits of these numerous discoveries and inventions. An equality which must be subject only to the length of time it will take to teach backward people how to read and write, and how to appreciate and constructively use the world's modern inventions.</p>  
<p><b>THE INSTITUTE'S DISCOVERIES MUST BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF EVERY LAND, NO MATTER HOW "BACKWARD" CERTAIN OF SUCH PEOPLE MAY SEEM TO BE BEFORE THEY ARE TAUGHT THE TRUE VALUE OF "UNITED EFFORT" AND "BROTHERLY LOVE."</b></p>

<p>Only upon the unequivocal acceptance of such conditions will the inventions and discoveries through which to provide financial independence to the human race be given to the two hundred million (200,000,000) people who will comprise our international audience. Only upon the signed agreement by each of them, that they will permit the products of their "equally-owned" Universal Service Corporation (which they will at that time be helped to form) to be distributed "equally" to the people of every land, irrespective of race, religion, color, class, education, training or ability&#151;subject only to the consent of each new member owner to the same by-laws of brotherly love which will constitute the eternal and unalterable charter of this great Service Corporation&#151;will our Research Department release its revolutionary discoveries into the hands of the Corporation's internationally elected Board of Directors.</p>  
<p><b>THESE DISCOVERIES WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO STAND AS A MONUMENT TO THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF SOME PERSON, OR GROUP OF PERSONS,&#151;(IN ORDER THAT SAID PERSONS MAY BE GLORIFIED OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO THEIR REAL IMPORTANCE IN THE UNIVERSAL SCHEME OF THINGS),&#151;NOR AS A MONUMENT TO ANY ONE RELIGION, ANY ONE NATION, ANY ONE CLASS, OR ANY ONE PROFESSION; FOR NEVER WILL THOSE WHO REVEALED THEM&#151;AND WHO CONSTITUTE OUR SPONSORS&#151;BE KNOWN TO THE HUMAN RACE; AND THEREFORE, NEVER WILL RELIGIOUS, RACIAL, CLASS, OR PROFESSIONAL RIVALRY</b></p>

<p>Not only will the immediate abundance of the necessities and luxuries of life, to which we have herein referred, start flowing to the human race within a period of months but, with the aid of the world's numerous mechanical inventions and of our Research Department's revolutionary discoveries, they will be produced without the necessity of any of The Corporation's employees ever being obliged&#151;after the first 12 months of its program&#151;to work more than 4 hours per day, 4 days each week, or over 8 months in any one year. This ruling will apply both to "skilled" and "unskilled" labor, as well as to office workers and officials. All employees of said corporation will also receive three (3) days each week and four (4) entire months each year of vacation periods with pay.</p>

<p>To those who will get out their pencil and paper and, within a few minutes of figuring, calculate that there isn't that much money in the entire world,&#151;(nor in fact enough at thirty thousand ($30,000.00) dollars per year&#151;for each one of the earth's hundreds of millions of adult inhabitants&#151;with which to pay them that salary for even the period of one month),&#151;we beg to remind them that people do not eat either gold or silver. <b>DOLLARS ARE ONLY "SYMBOLS" OF VALUE.</b></p>

<p>If the world's present number of factories produce&#151;let us say&#151;an average of three hundred ($300.00) dollars worth of necessities and luxuries of life for each of the worlds inhabitants, and such production having proven to be inadequate, mankind votes a salary check of three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars per year for food, clothes, homes, etc., to each man and woman employee and equal co-owner of The Universal Service Corporation,&#151;all that it will be necessary for them to do then, is not to produce more gold or silver&#151;or to print more money&#151;but merely to build more "factories" and "machinery" and produce more food, clothes, homes, etc. When mankind decide that each man or woman should have thirty thousand ($30,000.00) dollars instead of three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars per year, they will again increase the number of their factories, and continue to do so until the desired quantities of necessities and luxuries which they may choose to use, are finally being produced.</p>  
<p>The Research Department of The International Institute of Universal Research and Administration will, during its 30-day program of proclamations, "irrefutably" prove to even the most skeptical of men and women, that</p>

Our Research Department will at that time also prove that the productive capacity of said corporation will exceed an average of thirty thousand ($30,000.00) dollars per year&#151;of the necessities and luxuries of life&#151;per man or woman, within less than ten (10) years from the date of its formation.</p>

<p>Tens of millions of unemployed men and women throughout the major nations of the world, have been forced into idleness and hardships by the manipulations of the "Money Changers," not only for reasons which have been described in the previous pages hereof, but most particularly for the purpose of causing resentment, bitterness and hate in their hearts against their present governments, in order that they might thereby more readily be influenced into drastically altering their various governmental structures and accepting dictatorships in their stead or, if sufficiently embittered, be influenced into joining the ranks of the Communists and&#151;(through a carefully staged revolution, planned and financed by the Money Changers)&#151;bring about the complete overthrow of their former governments and appoint Communist dictators as their leaders and governors.</p>  
<p>All well-informed people are fully aware of the fact that these plans to cause discontent and bitterness in the hearts of millions of people have already reached the point where there are some millions of Communists and Fascists in France, other millions in England, and over ten million (10,000,000) members of these various radical groups even in the "United States of America," which already provides its people with greater liberty and freedom than have ever before been enjoyed by the citizens of any nation.</p>

WITH MILLIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS DYING OF STARVATION EVERY MONTH, SURELY A FEW OF THE UNEMPLOYED COULD BE PUT TO WORK, WITHIN A MATTER OF WEEKS, AND BE GRADUALLY TAUGHT HOW TO PROVIDE FOOD FOR THEMSELVES AS WELL AS FOR THESE STARVING MILLIONS.</b></p>  
<p>The completion of great flood-control and reforestation projects, harbors, highways and air ports; the development of national parks; draining of swamps; and the building of gigantic irrigation systems to take water into the deserts that they might be converted into useful and beautiful spots for the profit and enjoyment of the human race, Would provide work for "hundreds of millions" of men and women for a period of "generations" yet to come. If you should doubt these statements, all that it is necessary? for you to do is to take the time to investigate the thousands of completed engineering plans of projects which are greatly needed by mankind and which&#151;if undertaken&#151;would provide permanent and constructive activity and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_216"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 216</FONT></A></p>  
<p>employment during the entire lifetime of millions who are now looking forward to hopeless and endless years of idleness and unemployment.</p>  
<p>Instead these idle millions are filled&#151;(as it has been planned that they should be)&#151;with such "bitterness and hate" that, with but slight additional provocation, they may soon bring about revolutions which will make the "bloody years" of the French Revolution seem like a "children's fight at a Sunday-school picnic" in comparison. For such are the upheavals which are planned as a prologue to the war which is intended to result in the extermination of the world's educated and religious inhabitants, including also those who have been stirred to revolt, and who are to be merely a part of the "cannon fodder" they will be inflamed into creating out of the educated and religious peoples of our earth.</p>  
<p>The oft-repeated excuse that no great numbers of unemployed can ever be quickly placed in positions because of the fact that it would take months or years to plan and prepare the engineering studies, blue prints, and specifications for projects with which to keep them engaged, would be quickly dissipated if one were to take the time to glance over the "dust-covered" files of every city, state, and national government throughout the civilized world. Such files&#151;"at this time"&#151;contain completed engineering studies together with blue prints and fully checked specifications, of thousands of thoroughly practical and desirable projects; and most of which are greatly needed by the residents of the respective communities in which they are located.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_217"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 217</FONT></A></p>  
<p>These various engineering studies have been completed&#151;year after year&#151;at a cost (calculated on a worldwide basis) of "thousands of millions of dollars" of taxpayers&#146; money,&#151;by the duly elected or politically appointed representatives of the people, during periods of their respective administrations. However, before they could establish the necessary budgets with which to buy materials and hire men for the purposes of actual construction&#151;(as they have invariably told us)&#151;these representatives have been voted out of office and new ones, with an entirely "different" group of constituents to please, have started new engineering studies for "entirely different projects" in accordance with promises made to the voters who placed them in office.</p>  
<p>The principal reason that these countless thousands of projects have never gotten past the <b>"blue print and specification stage,"</b> is traceable to the fact that the majority of the people's political representatives <b>"never actually intended to complete them at all,"</b> but only <b>"promised"</b> to do so in order that they might thereby win the necessary votes to put themselves into office. Nevertheless, these completed engineering studies are "instantly available" at any time the public demands their use.</p>  
<p><b>WHENEVER THE "INTELLIGENT" MEN AND WOMEN WHO CONSTITUTE THE WILLING WORKERS AND CONSTRUCTIVE THINKERS OF THE WORLD, "DEMAND" THAT ALL ABLE-BODIED UNEMPLOYED ADULTS BE IMMEDIATELY PROVIDED WITH PERMANENT POSITIONS,</b></p>

<p>During one of our Research Department's extensive investigations in China, Japan, and certain countries in Europe, it was discovered that a force of over one hundred million (100,000,000) gardeners,&#151;(whose ancestry comes from those who have for centuries lived close to the soil and know and love plant life),&#151;could&#151;within a period of a matter of weeks&#151;be formed into an organization whose members would consent to live in any part of the world or travel to any point to which they might be sent, and who would gladly spend the remaining years of their lives working as gardeners in exchange for no other salary or remuneration than that consisting of the coarsest kinds of food, and the plainest, roughest kind of clothing. And the only homes they ask for are tents or plain board huts. <b>IF ANYONE WOULD GUARANTEE TO FEED THESE PEOPLE AND CONSEQUENTLY QUIET THEIR FEAR OF "STARVATION," THEY WOULD WILLINGLY WORK 16 TO 18 HOURS PER DAY, AND FOR NO MORE REMUNERATION THAN JUST BARELY ENOUGH TO EAT.

<p><A NAME="page_219"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 219</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In fact, we could almost wish that each of our readers had experienced just a few days of "hopeless poverty" and "ceaseless hunger," in order that each one who reads this statement might thereby be capable of fully appreciating the tragedy of a condition of thought which would cause human beings to offer to "sell" themselves as slaves&#151;(for the duration of their lifetime here on earth)&#151;to anyone who would guarantee them just enough food to keep from "starving to death."</p>  
<p>Can you picture the endless miles of beautiful parks and tree-lined highways; the thousands of little artificial lakes and man-made streams&#151;in otherwise arid sections; the playgrounds, athletic fields and recreation centers, which would provide opportunity for the constructive and happy use of leisure hours, if all of the world's "hungry" people were employed for the purpose of producing such results? These advantages could be made readily available for the people of every land, through the activities of a permanent force of one hundred million (100,000,000) men and women trained to design, develop, and permanently maintain thousands of great parks and recreation centers as a protection against the ugliness and lack of beauty which now exist in so many of the world's great cities. The drab and frequently filthy&#151;as well as colorless&#151;immediate environment and surroundings endured by the majority of the earth's inhabitants, have done much throughout the centuries to warp and distort the minds of men.</p>

<p><b>Knowing the readiness with which our planet could be made to produce an abundance of food for all mankind, our Sponsors have planned&#151;and will recommend to the Universal Service Corporation&#151;that a standing force of not less than one hundred million (100,000,000) men and women landscape architects and gardeners be maintained as a permanent branch of said corporation's activities.</b> Knowing that such workers will receive the same educational benefits and compensation as any other group of employees, and that they will not be required to work any more than the usual 4 hours per day, 4 days a week or over 8 months each year, is it not indeed an inspiring vision&#151;"and an ambition worthy of intelligent creatures"&#151;to contemplate providing such employment for the tens of millions of broken-spirited, fear-filled human beings who now ask no more from life than merely "enough food" to keep from dying?</p>

<p>Yes; our Research Department is well prepared to prove to the clear-thinking men and women of our generation, that every unemployed human being in every civilized nation on our earth, can be placed in permanent positions "at any time" within a period of but a few months&#151;and at the rate of over two million (2,000,000) people per week&#151;starting one month after The Universal Service Corporation has been voted into existence.</p>  
<p>When the members of our audience of two hundred million (200,000,000) people have agreed to unite and direct their buying power through what will then be their own mutually and equally owned business facilities, they will have a combined influence of over <b>"one thousand million ($1000,000,000) dollars" per day</b> with which to back up their united demand that "permanent" positions be "immediately" provided for all unemployed. <b>THERE WILL BE NO OCCASION FOR THEM HESITATING TO TAKE SUCH ACTION, INASMUCH AS THEY WILL ALL RECEIVE "EQUAL" BENEFITS THEREFROM.</b></p>

THERE WILL BE NO VOTES BY "PROXY" AND THEREFORE NO OPPORTUNITY FOR ANY "INDIVIDUAL" OR "MINORITY GROUP" TO USE THE BUSINESS FACILITIES OF THE CORPORATION FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH ENDS.</b></p>  
<p>Although the majority of the citizens of many countries regularly vote on the various political issues presented to them, the fact still remains that they are seldom allowed to "actually understand" the issues upon which they vote; and not "one" out of ten thousand of them&#151;at any time&#151;"really knows" what is "actually taking place" on the inside of the world's constantly changing political administrations. The public is therefore readily "duped" into supporting many projects which have been cunningly conceived for purposes directly the reverse of those for which people thought they were voting.</p>  
<p>Compulsory attendance at the respective local branch-business meetings of The Universal Service Corporation will be for the purpose of permanently preventing its owners from "unknowingly" consenting to activities of which they may not approve. In due course of time,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_223"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 223</FONT></A></p>  
<p>through the avenues of radio and television equipment placed in each home throughout the world, such business meetings will be conducted from one central point, and each owner of The Universal Service Corporation will be able to vote his acceptance or rejection of the various measures presented to him, right from his own home . . . Through mechanical facilities&#151;which have already been perfected&#151;he will be able to vote by writing his signature and membership number with the use of an electrical device which will enable such information to be instantly recorded in the statistical department of the Corporation's International Headquarters. In other words, at that time it will no longer be necessary for a member to leave his home in order to attend the Corporation's business meetings, or act upon the various measures requiring his vote. Such measures will be described a number of times during each twenty-four hours, until all of the members have had an opportunity to cast their votes.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> The "universal language"&#151;which will be internationally understood by the world's intelligent and educated citizens within less than twelve months after the formation of The Universal Service Corporation&#151;will greatly simplify such activities. Within less than ten years, said "universal language" will be understood and readily used by every civilized man and woman on our earth, for even at this time its principal features are regularly used by well over three hundred million (300,000,000) educated people.</p>

<p>percentage of the world-wide membership of the Corporation will be given the opportunity of occupying various official positions at the Corporation's International Headquarters and consequently&#151;from first hand observation&#151;will be well qualified to vote intelligently upon matters requiring an expression of their judgment.</p>  
<p><b>IN ORDER THAT "TRUE EQUALITY" AND "JUSTICE" MAY PREVAIL,&#151;"ROTATION IN OFFICE" WILL CONSTITUTE THE PERMANENT AND UNALTERABLE POLICY OF THIS GREAT CO-OPERATIVELY OWNED SERVICE CORPORATION.</b> Its charter will contain specific provisions prohibiting any one, either now or ever in the future, from owning more than one share of its value&#151;from having more than one vote in its management&#151;or from holding an office or occupying any "one" position for a period of over "one" year without the written consent of 80% of the employees directly under such a one's supervision, and in no event, nor under any circumstances whatsoever, over three years.</p>  
<p>An executive who is not capable of training his immediate assistant to assume higher responsibilities within not to exceed a three-year period&#151;in order that he himself may be free to advance into broader fields of activity&#151;will not possess the qualifications which our charter will require of its executives.</p>  
<p>No employee will be permitted to occupy a position without first agreeing to strive to advance in accordance with such a one's proven qualifications. When one has proven that he possesses the qualifications and the necessary</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_225"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 225</FONT></A></p>  
<p>proficiency to occupy an advanced position over the one he is already filling,&#151;and has assisted his immediate understudy to gain the necessary training for the position he desires to leave,&#151;an opportunity for such advancement will constantly be made available in periods of from one to not over three years&#146; time.</p>  
<p>In other words all employees, from those occupying the most lowly positions to those who will constitute The Universal Service Corporation's Executive Board, will each be helped to progress in accordance with such employee's respective abilities, and without having to wait for some one in an advanced position either to die&#151;or voluntarily retire&#151;after possibly having obstructed the progress and deserved advancement of numerous other worthy employees for fifteen or twenty years, as they now do under our present economic ("lack of") system.</p>  
<p>Unlimited opportunities for study and self-improvement will be made available to all employees, and there will be no need for anyone being obliged to engage in activities for which one may possess neither the natural aptitude nor the potential qualifications. When it is discovered that an employee seems incapable of advancing in a department, in which said employee may be active, immediate and highly specialized assistance will be provided to enable such a "misfit"&#151;or dissatisfied employee&#151;to find the type of work for which he or she may possess the requisite qualifications.</p>  
<p>The "Personnel" department of the Corporation will be so conducted that neither the factors of favoritism nor family relationship will enter into the selection of employees</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_226"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 226</FONT></A></p>

Civil Service examinations and numerous practical tests&#151;conducted by recognized authorities and qualified experts&#151;will be made available for those desiring positions with The Universal Service Corporation.</p>  
<p><b>A SUITABLE AND DESIRABLE POSITION WILL BE GUARANTEED TO EVERY ABLE-BODIED MAN OR WOMAN IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD, IRRESPECTIVE OF RACE, COLOR, CLASS, RELIGION, EDUCATION, TRAINING OR ABILITY.</b></p>  
<p>Although the standard wage scale for all workers, from the lowest to the highest positions, will be calculated at three thousand ($3,000.00) dollars per year each&#151;during the initial stage of the Corporation's existence&#151;it will&#151;however&#151;be gradually increased until within a period of approximately ten years, the Corporation's productive capacity will enable it to distribute approximately thirty thousand ($30,000.00) dollars per year, of the various necessities and luxuries of human life, to every man or woman throughout the world.</p>  
<p>Under the proposed new economic system there will be neither creditors nor debtors to keep human beings in bondage to one another, nor to despoil one's life of the natural heritage of freedom and peace. The temptation to endanger one's future happiness by overdrawing one's credit will be prevented, not only through the adoption of a type of currency which only the individual earning or directly receiving it from the Corporation can spend or use, but also through a provision of the Corporation's charter which will prevent any of its employees and owners</p>

<p>from ever exceeding their respective allotments of its products. Inasmuch as The Universal Service Corporation will be the only producing and distributing business establishment with which the public will finally be dealing, the exact amounts of credit due each of the earth's inhabitants will always be readily available. Instead of having to refer to the books of many smaller business establishments, in order to determine the amount of unused credit, there will be but "one" bookkeeping account to be taken into consideration and, therefore, but slight opportunity of anyone ever misusing or overdrawing credit.</p>

The only arbitrary work requirement, applying to all employees, will consist of a minimum working schedule of not less than 4 hours a day, 4 days each week, during 8 months of each year. At the conclusion of twenty (20) years an employee will be privileged to permanently retire from routine duties if he so desires and yet will receive his or her share of the Corporation's products, services, and benefits for the duration of his or her lifetime. However, all employees will be privileged to earn retirement within a period of only ten (10) years, provided they are willing to work 8 hours a day, 4 days</p>

<p>Previous to this simultaneous destruction of the world's entire armaments and munitions of warfare, and the disbanding of its armies and navies, the Corporation's owners&#151;together with the citizens of the various nations&#151;will have voted the establishment of a world-wide militia with which to maintain law and order, and with which to permanently prevent either revolutions or wars from ever again occurring on our earth.

These "world rulers" have stood idly by, with no other feelings than those of contemptuous amusement or an inflated concept of their own egotistical superiority, while tens of millions of other human beings die from starvation each year, and a majority of the remainder of the human race eke out an existence of privation and fear-filled years, century after century.</p>  
<p>The second group,&#151;which has occasionally throughout the past few thousand years succeeded in getting possession of the key&#151;("Ownership")&#151;to the earth's raw materials and resources,&#151;has been, (not some branch of the "fabulously wealthy class") but instead, those of the world's most downtrodden and poverty-stricken "lower classes," who have become so filled with bitterness and hate over their needless privations, that they have risen</p>

Through this neglect&#151;of their own basic best interests&#151;the <b>"middle class"</b> inhabitants of our earth have repeatedly permitted the fruitage of their centuries of tireless efforts to be destroyed through revolutions and wars planned for the profit or advancement of either one or the other of the afore-mentioned "wealthy" or "poverty-stricken" groups.</p>
