<p>This book has been published and copyrighted in the United States of America,&#151;not because there is no other country which grants its people the privilege of free speech or assembly, nor because of the fact that the world's subversive influences are any less aggressive here than in any other liberty-loving nation, nor because the people of America are any more "enlightened" or any less "bigoted" than the citizens of any other country,&#151;but solely because of the fact that, throughout recent generations, millions of people from all of the world's great nations have settled in America. <b>Therefore, our message can be quickly placed in the hands of millions of men and women who not only understand the world's various major languages, but also understand the customs of its many classes of inhabitants, and consequently through them it will quickly spread to all parts of the civilized world.</b></p>  
<p>Here in America, the Sponsors of The International Institute of Universal Research and Administration have</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_282"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 282</FONT></A></p>  
<p>found millions of right-thinking, clean-living, high-principled men and women of each of the great nations;&#151;men and women whom they are now inviting to participate in the establishment of an economic system based upon "Practical Idealism," instead of the "Jungle Law" of selfishness and "brute force."</p>  
<p><b>CHRIST JESUS TAUGHT THAT "THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN"&#151;THE PROMISED LAND&#151;WAS "HERE AT HAND," AND READY TO BE FULLY ENJOYED ANY TIME THAT MEN WERE WILLING TO LIVE IN OBEDIENCE TO HIS TEACHINGS AND PRECEPTS. "CHRISTIANS OF THE WORLD!"&#151;ARE YOU READY TO START "LIVING" AS WELL AS "PREACHING" THOSE PRECEPTS? ARE YOU WILLING "TO LIVE AND TO LET LIVE" AND NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT???</b></p>  
<p>The Universal Service Corporation&#151;the formation of which will be brought to pass during our Research Department's 30-day program&#151;will constitute a sturdy beginning towards the building of a great and beautiful world-wide estate and universal home for all mankind, with spacious living quarters, delightful gardens, security, opportunity, leisure, smiles, laughter and limitless happiness, to be equally shared and enjoyed in a great and true brotherhood of man: <b>A brotherhood not in name alone, nor as an insidious and subtly planned ensnaring counterfeit&#151;such as</b></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_283"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 283</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>is now being offered to the world under the names of "Communism" and "Dictatorships"&#151;but instead, the highest human concept of the divine idea of "the brotherhood of man," a brotherhood built upon the solid foundation of Christ Jesus&#146; "Golden Rule;"&#151;"ABSOLUTE ECONOMIC EQUALITY" IN "FACT" AS WELL AS IN "THEORY."</b></p>  
<p><b>Again we remind you, that it has been most truly stated:&#151;"There is a principle which is a bar against all information, which is proof against all argument, and which cannot fail to keep man in ever-lasting ignorance; THIS PRINCIPLE IS 'CONTEMPT' PRIOR TO EXAMINATION."</b>&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Inasmuch as the only favor we ask of the world's un-bigoted and enlightened men and women, is that they will assist us in forming our audience&#151;(through the circulation of this book)&#151;in order that the Research Department of The International Institute of Universal Research and Administration may safely present its proofs,&#151;and since our requisite audience of 200,000,000 people can readily be formed within a matter of but a few months&#151;(if those of you who constitute the world's "independent," "right-thinking inhabitants" will help us to accomplish this result)&#151;we feel justified in inviting your co-operation.</p>  
<p><b>In order that the oft-repeated statement&#151;"it can't be done"&#151;may be refuted, we have prepared a chart to indicate just how readily&#151;"it could be done"&#151;if each one who</b></p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_284"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 284</FONT></A></p>  
<p><b>hears of our movement, will spend just a few minutes to "pass the word along," by placing as many copies of this book in circulation as his time will permit.</b></p>  
<p>Recognizing the fact that many human beings are largely controlled by habits of apathy and procrastination, we cannot logically expect more than a moderate percentage of the result indicated on said chart, and therefore those of you who have recognized the importance of this movement, must work just so much more zealously if the formation of our audience is to be quickly brought to pass. <b>HOWEVER, THE CHART IRREFUTABLY PROVES THAT "IT CAN BE DONE."</b></p>  
<p>The following chart will indicate to you the possible far-reaching effect of your influence provided that&#151;when you have finished reading "Mankind United"&#151;you will then order "four" copies of this book and&#151;within 24 hours after their receipt&#151;invite "four" of your acquaintances to read them, and request that they mail an acknowledgment of having done so&#151;"together with their respective orders for 'four' copies thereof"&#151;in accordance with the instructions on the last page of this volume. If they in turn invite "four" of their acquaintances&#151;within not to exceed "three" days thereafter&#151;to similarly co-operate, and each group does likewise, you will observe from the chart the possible far-reaching effect of the influence of just&#151;"one"&#151;person constructively directed in such a manner:</p>

<p><b>IF ALL WHO READ THIS BOOK WOULD COOPERATE TO THE EXTENT OF PLACING JUST "FOUR" COPIES THEREOF IN CIRCULATION, NO ONE WOULD NEED TO DO MORE THAN THIS, AND YET A WORLD-WIDE ORGANIZATION SUFFICIENTLY POWERFUL TO ACCOMPLISH THE RESULTS WE HAVE DESCRIBED HEREIN, COULD THEN BE FORMED WITHIN LESS THAN FOUR (4) MONTHS' TIME.</b></p>  
<p>Estimating "one" week for mailing&#151;or other losses of time&#151;to enable each one who reads "Mankind United" to order "four" copies thereof and place them in circulation by lending them to "four" of his acquaintances, we will now assume that "two" weeks have elapsed since you obtained your first four copies and invited four of your acquaintances to do likewise. You will have thereby made it possible for a total of twenty (20) people to read "Mankind United" and to place their orders for copies thereof&#151;within a period of only "two" weeks&#151;as the direct result of the "four" books you generously took time to place in circulation. <b>FROM THIS LOWLY BEGINNING, THE CHART ON THE NEXT PAGE WILL PARTLY ILLUSTRATE THE POSSIBLE INFLUENCE OF YOUR GRACIOUS ACCEPTANCE OF OUR INVITATION UPON THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF SUCH "UNSELFISHLY" MOTIVATED "UNITED EFFORT."</b></p>

<p><b>In answer to those who may believe that it would take years to form a world-wide organization two hundred million (200,000,000) strong, we beg to call their attention to the fact that with present day methods of intercommunication&#151;rapid transportation&#151;telephones&#151;radios&#151;automobiles&#151;airmail, etc., etc., such an organization could readily be formed within less than "four months&#146;" time,&#151;and yet not even "one" of the 200,000,000 people we seek, would be required to place more than four (4) copies of this book in circulation, nor spend more than a few hours of time in order to accomplish such a result,&#151;provided that "each" of those who read "Mankind United," will make it his or her business to immediately obtain not less than "four (4) copies" thereof, and place them in circulation.

<p><b>In fact, when only eight million (8,000,000) of the world's right-thinking inhabitants have each formed a Branch of our International 4-4-8-3-4 Club, (previously described,) it will require less than "one month" thereafter, to complete our audience of 200,000,000 people. Within thirty days from the date that this result has been brought to pass, The Universal Service Corporation can be formed, and within less than one month from that date, the world's unemployed men and women will be going back to work at the rate of over two million (2,000,000) people per week!!!</b></p>
