<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The</span> world declares, oh, Death, that thou art cruel and relentless. That thy mission is to shatter and destroy all that it holds of the beautiful.</p>  
<p>That thou lovest to wound the mother-heart, and to rock and sway the proud father-heart with grief that will not be assuaged.</p>  
<p>That thou bringest to one common level those whom the world respects and loves and those whom the world styles its outcasts.</p>  
<p>That all hearts are vulnerable to thine arrows, and each form matter assumes must bow before thy stern decree.</p>  
<p>Speaketh the world wisely?</p>  
<p>Thy vision must be obscured and all thy spiritual faculties blunted, or thou wouldst not speak as thou hast spoken.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_98"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 98</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Thou art neither cruel nor relentless, oh, Death, for thy mission is one of love and not of anger.</p>  
<p>Thou art, indeed, the most beautiful of all the messengers of Omn!</p>  
<p>Thou art not as poets and artists have pictured thee: old, haggard and terrible.</p>  
<p>Thy cheeks have stolen the roseate tints of the morn; thou art as graceful in all thy movements as the fawns, and thy features reflect nothing more terrible than peace and love!</p>  
<p>Thy mission is not that of destruction more than it is that of re-creation.</p>  
<p>The golden bowl that held the prize of life is broken only that the spirit might find elsewhere a more glorious setting.</p>  
<p>The temple that had grown too small to hold longer its proud inmate has fallen&#151;but there are other temples more spacious and beautiful awaiting the advent of the soul.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_99"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 99</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Oh, Death, thou hast given a broader liberty, a more glorious freedom to the soul.</p>  
<p>Thy door swings inward, noiselessly opening upon enchanted chambers radiant with unwonted light and glory such as earth hath never known.</p>  
<p>Thou kissest down the eyelids in sleep, oh, Death, and imprinteth upon the lips the seal of immortality.</p>  
<p>Beautiful, indeed, at thy gentle touch bath been the awakening into newer experiences.</p>  
<p>Not, as some have said, into a new life, for it is the same old life that has unfalteringly kept its march through the ages, but thou hast simply brought it a little nearer to its ideals.</p>  
<p>Behold the great company with which the soul now stands! For the call of the spirit has been answered, and its own have come at its bidding.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_100"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 100</FONT></A></p>  
<p>New fields lie open before thee, loftier heights than e&#146;er thy feet have scaled stretch on and on before thee, oh, soul.</p>  
<p>Death hath not robbed thee of thy treasures, oh, soul. All the good that thou hast done, all the noble thoughts thou hast expressed, live and are with thee still.</p>  
<p>Instead of Death thou shouldst be called Life, for thou holdest within thy hands the keys that unlock the doors of space and time.</p>
