<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Let</span> no sound of martial strain be heard throughout thy world, oh, soul! March not forth with banners flying and trumpets echoing afar.</p>  
<p>Let not, oh, soul, thy path be strewn with human wrecks and tortured forms.</p>  
<p>Let not thy way be o&#146;er earthly battlefields gory with human blood.</p>  
<p>Let not thy onward course be paved with hopes and aspirations lost.</p>  
<p>Let not splendor of outward expression dim the inner light and glory.</p>  
<p>Strike, then, the grandest note of all, of peace and love to all mankind.</p>  
<p>Over all the strife and discord of the world then let this thought prevail&#151;</p>  
<p>Peace, soft, sweet, like fleecy night-clouds.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_126"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 126</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Enfolding and enwrapping all in folds of perfect trust and love!</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>Light ineffable, glorious, all-potent, yet soft and silent as that of distant star, slowly, yet surely, lifting every soul out of the dark and dismal earthly hells.</p>  
<p>Angels, not blaming earth's wayward ones, but with tender, loving arms encircling all, rescuing from maelstroms of anger and passion; supporting tottering footsteps along life's wearisome way, until, at last, the soul is quickened, and the master spirit asserts itself.</p>  
<p>Not the assertion of self in the merely outward expression of things through martial power, brutal strength, and accumulation of worldly goods.</p>  
<p>But that only real and true assertion of self that is forgetful of all outward expressions,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_127"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 127</FONT></A></p>  
<p>resultants of power, strength, and worldly goods, save as they lead to the higher interests and greater benefits of the many.</p>  
<p>Light, dispelling clouds of ignorance, removing obstacles, overcoming difficulties, making smooth the path where human feet needs must press;</p>  
<p>Light, revealing unto enraptured vision new earths and new heavens, homes of contented and happy beings;</p>  
<p>Light, making plain that which before perplexed and troubled;</p>  
<p>Light, servant of spirits, angels and archangels, mighty and all-potent for human good when wisely directed;</p>  
<p>Lead thou our spirits on,</p>  
<p>From night unto day,</p>  
<p>From discord and strife unto peace,</p>  
<p>From selfishness unto that true love of self that can bide no ill unto others.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_128"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 128</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Lead thou our spirits on,</p>  
<p>Away from charnel-houses of sin and death,</p>  
<p>From battlefields and dismal prison cells,</p>  
<p>From anger and hate's accursed fires,</p>  
<p>Unto that love knowing no my nor mine save only that which leads to good of all.</p>  
<p>Lead thou our spirits on,</p>  
<p>Oh, light, messenger of Th&#257; and Omn,</p>  
<p>Through all the devious paths of life,</p>  
<p>Thick-strewn with many a fret and care,</p>  
<p>Until all clouds are gone, all strifes are gone,</p>  
<p>And burn forever upon the altar of human hearts the fires of love and peace.</p>
