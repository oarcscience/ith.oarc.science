    INTRODUCTION 
  </CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
In thee five yeras since thee first edition ov this booklet was published thee 
Temple has grown immeasurably through thee l-ov-e, trust and dedication ov those 
who care. Thee aim ov this extensively revised edition is to bring this energy 
we have gained, this l-ov-e we know, this magickal journey we share, to a new 
and wider circle. We know that those in contact with thee Temple are dedicated 
to a vision ov a fiercely Individual mode ov life, and it is our deepest desire 
that this dedication be given every opportunity to find expression in thee face 
ov thee cynical and reactionary hand ov Control. Thee method could not be simpler, 
and its potency cannot be denied. Thee Temple seeks to return to thee Individual 
all that is truly theirs, to awaken thee reality ov dreams, and to crush thee 
imposed con-ditioning ov a society scared to look itself in thee mirror, scared 
to place life ahead ov death.<BR>
<BR>
No matter what difficulties we face from those who would deny us our way, thee 
Temple will continue to use every means at its disposal to ensure that we are 
not thwarted. And thee most powerful weapon we have is thee Sigil, thee magickal 
process by which we charge our dreams and desires, and make manifest their living 
beauty. It is to thee Sigil that this book is dedicated, and to all those who 
know.<BR>
<BR>
Everyone who is active in thee Temple, who has freely given their coumitment to 
its aims, realises that this is no part-time easy answer that we give. It is a 
case ov total coumitment; butter there is also no-one in thee Temple who has not 
found that through this coumitment coums a new and vital energy that makes thee 
sacrifice an act ov L-ov-e, a way ov living that brings its own reward through 
thee development ov strength, purpose, and ov freedom from all that denies us 
our Destiny.<BR>
<BR>
Thee TOPY network spans thee western hemisphere, its aim to create an alternative 
system ov Information Exchange to counter thee spread ov lies disseminated by 
thee mass media and thee governments ov Control. And thee growth ov thee network, 
thee continual development ov new Access Points in thee U.K., Europe and America 
is proof that we are winning. Lines ov coummunication grow stronger daily as we 
share with each other thee experiences we have gained, thee lessons we have learnt, 
thee l-ov-e and anger we feel. So it is with thee Sigil. Just as we work to share 
all that is important to us with you, so by sharing your experiences with us we 
can all move ahead together as Individuals; not as sheep who follow unthinkingly.<BR>
<BR>
It is always a question ov independence. We are not here to convince thee doubters, 
to dominate thee weak, to act as crutch or place ov refuge. We are not saviours 
or dogmatists. Everything that is gained is from within thee Individual, only 
it was previously asleep. We simply help to awaken thee truth ov desire, and by 
thee development ov individual thought and responsibility show how it is possible 
to act on that knowledge.<BR>
<BR>
Our system is functional: that is, it works. And thee result ov this is that we 
each find our own way, not dictated to by others. We remain linked by friendship, 
not by need; a friendship born ov true understanding and not simply thee freak 
ov circumstance.<BR>
<BR>
Thee Temple ov Psychick Youth is a network ov Individuals. That is how it should 
be, and that is thee only requirement.<BR>
