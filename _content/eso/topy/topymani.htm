<center>THOSE WHO DO NOT REMEMBER THEE PAST
<br>ARE CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT</center>

<center>
<h2>
An Introduction to thee Temple ov Psychick Youth</h2></center>
Thee Temple strives to end personal laziness and engender discipline.
<p>To focus thee Will on one's true desires, in thee belief, gathered from
experience that this maximises and makes happen all those things that one
wants in every area ov life.
<p>Explore daily your deepest desires, fantasies and motives, gradually
focusing on what you would like to happen in a perfect world, a perfect
situation, taking away all restrictions and practical considerations, what
you would <i>really</i> want.
<p>Then decide to try and do it.
<p>Thee mere visualisation ov that true goal begins thee process that makes
it happen.
<p>Clean out thee trappings and debris ov compromise, ov what you have
been told is <i>reasonable</i> for a person in your circumstances.
<p>Be clear in admitting your real desires. Discard all irrelevancies.
Ask yourself who you want as friends, if you need or want to work, what
you want to eat. Check and re-check everything deeper and deeper, more
and more precisely to get closer and ultimately integrate with your <i>real</i>
Self.
<p>Once you are focused on yourself internally, thee external aspects ov
your life will fall into place. They have to.
<p>Sceptics will say they simply don't believe this Psychick process works,
but it does.
<p>It is thee Key to thee Temple.&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
THEE OBLIVION OV THEE OBVIOUS</h3></center>
To say in day-to-day life that something is 'obvious' means, more often
than not, that one concedes a note ov truth in exchange for a tolerance
ov thee usual hypocrisy and conditioning. You can, for example, make your
opposite <i>admit</i> as being obvious that there is no such thing as a
theory that is absolutely true; that will not stop them in any way from
continuing to brandish their 'Truths' as before.
<p>Their momentary concession passes by a sordid business in which they
buy their future peace ov mind. A life without questions.
<p>Hence, there is no higher aim than thee OBVIOUS. It is to approach thee
closest to a Truth which we know to be inaccessible but whose gleam we
can see.
<p>Thee Obvious is a protection. Not only does it make people run away,
but it also deceives by its rapid commonness, and by thee fact that in
Flat people's minds, whatever is simple cannot be serious.&nbsp;
<hr>It would be an illusion to think that thee Individual can hide all
thee clues to his Oneness. His task is therefore to see to it that all
thee clues are wrongly interpreted. Thus it is that they may SEEM to indicate
a lack ov individuality and create a feeling ov disappointment rather than
curiosity. This tactic gives us space and protection in thee traps ov time.
<p>An Individual has many personalities or characters at thee same time
or alternately. (Recent cognitive brain theory supports this.) Most people
little by little eliminate thee personalities considered to be dangerous
by their peer group or societal unit and finally keep only one: thee social
personality - one dimensional 'flat' people.
<p>But other people, called paradoxically 'Individuals', are always trying
to develop all their personalities, even if there is an internal conflict
between them. So we can clearly see that thee Individualist person logically
must use 'WE' to name himself, whilst thee person who belongs to thee masses
must use thee 'I'. Thee first is multi-dimensional, thee second is uni-dimensional.
<p>One ov thee Temple functions is to encourage and support thee development
ov multi-dimensional individuals. Hence our use ov 'WE' in our texts.&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
DISCIPLINE</h3></center>
Our stress on self discipline is important, it links thee internal methods
ov ritual to our approval and suggestion ov other forms ov physical discipline
to compliment thee mental/sexual ones. Hence you will often find that Initiates
ov thee Temple will be engaged in such outside activities as Marksmanship,
Martial Arts, Swimming and so on as an extension ov thee theory ov maintaining
and improving ones Focus and abilities.
<p>Thee point is not thee skill in itself, though we appreciate thee practical
nature, in a society such as ours, ov an ability to defend oneself and
be fit, but thee application, thee discipline itself. So one may be poor
in terms ov results, but excellent in terms ov your genuine application
to a skill that requires thought, co-ordination and a degree ov dedication.
A synthesis ov physical action, thought, reflex and an analysis ov both
yourself and a target (real and metaphorical).&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
INTENT</h3></center>
We attempt to commune with spirits, to be friends with thee Human Spirit.
<p>We care for thee infinite significance ov thee individual spirit and
personal moral responsibility and its development through experience.
<p>We believe in thee total significance ov thee individual discovered
though familiarity with thee deepest instincts and explorations ov destiny
outside thee traps ov time.
<p>We intend to engender moral freedom, spiritual freedom, sexual freedom,
and personal independence, to insist upon personal choose in all things.
<p>We accept responsibility gladly, with excitement and deliberate ignorance
ov thee outcoum.
<p>We revel in mystery and surprise.
<p>We bury our selves in challenge and dreams.
<p>We embrace all possibilities and impossibilities with joy and excitement.
<p>We accept thee true nature ov life, thee way thee world is. Flexible
and shifting, in flux every moment, shaped by parallel levels that accept
contradiction and inconsistency as inviolate qualities that generate mystery
and mastery.
<p>We direct ourselves wherever we chose to go with joy and abandon.
<p>A New Era ov thee Magickal interpretation ov thee World and existing
in it is couming. An interpretation in terms ov Will and Imagination fuelled
by contact with intuition and instinct.&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
RESPONSIBILITY</h3></center>
Do you want to be part ov a world ov sleeping people?
<br>Do you want to imbibe thee drug ov thee commonplace?
<br>Will you be forever addicted to self-restriction?
<p>Established orthodoxies and dogmas, conditioned interpretations ov living,
regard thee material world as reality whilst pretending to deal with thee
spirit or existence. They conceive and propagate evolution and thinking
as purely physical, their control ov our lives and visions as sacrosanct.
<p>Religion has privately altered to work from a position that accepts
itself as totally discredited by science. All establishment modes ov control
and affiliation, both religious and political, rely upon and revolve around
unquestioning faith and dogma, unquestioning acceptance ov their inalienable
right to assume professional responsibility for our actions upon their
shoulders.
<p>We are told we are weak, incapable ov grasping scale, afraid ov ourselves
and desperate to push responsibility for all events in our lives onto them.
<br>We are consistently trained to accept our corporeal existence as hopeless
in itself, to becoum subservient to thee greater good.
<br>We are perpetually conditioned, encouraged, and blackmailed into self-restriction
into narrower and narrower perceptions ov ourselves, our own importance,
our own potential and our own experience. We are trained to ignore thee
evidence ov our senses and experience and to feel guilt when we glimpse
sense derived visions ov ourselves as free spirits.
<p>Thee voluntary relinquishing ov responsibility for our lives and actions
is one ov thee greatest enemies ov our time.
<p>Our enemies are flat.
<br>Our enemies are three-dimensional.
<br>Our enemies are continuity and coherence.
<br>Our enemies are restriction and confinement.
<br>Our enemies are guilt and fear.
<br>Our enemies are material.
<br>Our enemies are direction and fact.
<br>Our enemies are Because.
<p>We are not seeking followers, we are seeking collaborators, Individuals
for a visionary Psychick alliance.&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
FOCUSING THEE WILL</h3></center>
What we suggest next is not instruction. It is method. A method which can
be used by anyone, alone or with friends, regardless ov any material or
social circumstances. A method to be used by thee individual to break through
to their deeper consciousness, where fantasies ambitions and real wishes
reside, thee place where all dreams meet.
<p>People can most readily identify and relate to dreams that are sexual,
and that is thee primary reason for our choice ov sex as a vehicle for
this method to begin with. Our interest is therefore practical.
<p>In our experience, although they might deny it, most people never ask
themselves what they really want, or simply say they don't know. But it
is only once a person has learned to identify their true desires in an
imaginary perfect world, where guilt and retribution are suspended, that
they can hope to reach them.&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
SEX</h3></center>
Ov all thee things that people do, at home and in private, usually with
close friends, sex alone is subject to extraordinary interference and control
from outside forces. This is no accident. They recognise its power. Even
if only for a few moments, Individuals can release a power and energy from
within that renders any system ov society, or regime, meaningless. It is
a liberator. Even an individual in solitary confinement can indulge in
it and in their fantasies travel into any situation and possibility unfettered,
and, at thee moment ov orgasm itself, be both blissfully vulnerable and
undeniably free, elsewhere, filled with energy.
<p>Accordingly from thee moment ov birth, pressure is exerted upon everyone
to limit their release and enjoyment ov this power. To limit and restrict
thee immense potential all ov us were born with, into narrow and non-threatening
forms ov behaviour, sexual and otherwise.
<p>Ov course thee nature ov this pressure varies by place and era. When
specific laws becoum unenforceable for a time, more subtle methods are
used; social attitudes, anxiety, guilt, fear ov ridicule and failure are
all exploited, and diseases that attack only those who indulge in specific
sexual activities are introduced. Most give in to this pressure in one
way or another, permanently crippling their individual growth.
<p>We believe that it is essential, if we are to survive and progress,
that we first recognise, accept and ultimately reach our true sexual desires.
This not only satisfies thee body and consolidates thee spirit, but acts
as an example for all our goals in every area ov life, and attacks at thee
root ov control. Control begins with sexuality, so it seems crucial to
begin at this universally applicable point and develop our awareness from
there.
<p>In our culture people have internalised alienating stereotypes which
dictate their sexual and social interactions. This makes men agreeable
to orders ov authority figures and keeps women in line with accepted notions
ov propriety and authority and binds up their sexual desire so that they
will accept a generally subordinate role to men. Thee latter is propagated
by those who are empowered by thee patriarchal lineage which has been handed
down through thee ages, whose fear ov thee unknown, - in this case women
and feminine characteristics, has been countered by a bulwark ov dogma
which aims at controlling and/or degrading all those forces which they
see as a threat to their reign.
<p>By studying thee oppression ov women through thee ages we can see in
a nutshell thee nature, methods and manifestations ov oppressions it is
used in any society in any age against those who are pro-life and expanding.
<p>But on a broad scale encompassing both sexes, thee repression ov sexual
instincts functions to make people submissive and inclined to irrational
behaviour and thus paralyses their rebellious potential. On a deeply personal
level where we enter thee domain ov such energies which might be called
'magickal', thee effect ov such conditioning is no less significant. Psychick
energy and sexual energy are different names for thee same force: by ridding
ourselves ov restrictions and thee forms ov control which have been imposed
on us we can coum into our own on more planes than one.
<p>Most initiates ov thee Temple believe there is a power and effect released
by an orgasm, focused through Will, that enhances not only thee chances
ov Self-fulfilment and contentment but also thee achievement ov creative
goals: that thee strength ov this process forces thee hand ov chance and
brings closer thee object ov your desire.&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
RITUAL</h3></center>
Throughout history man has used ritual to achieve spiritual results from
simple physical actions. Recently its use has been limited to established
religious dogmas, and since many if not all ov these have fallen into disrepute
or have coum to be seen as irrelevant, so too has thee use ov ritual, but
its use is far older and far more universal than any organised church.
<p>Any ritual is a way ov concentrating and focusing those taking part
on a particular aim or idea. It is essential only that thee techniques
employed have meaning and vitality for thee participants. Seen without
this belief, as many recorded rituals ov thee past are now, thee process
can seem simply ridiculous, and thee mechanical repetition ov them certainly
would be.
<p>Initiates ov thee Temple ov Psychick Youth have developed personal methods
or rituals, not only to strengthen and refine their inner objectives, both
sexual and practical, but also to provide a fertile basis for those objectives
to grow and becoum real.
<p>Although we have no vested interest in others following this example,
or contacting thee Temple, it is possible that some people may wish to
do so. Below are instructions on how to do this. Many people feel unwilling
or unable to put our suggestions into practice, due to thee effectiveness
ov social conditioning. Thee Temple will only draw initiates from those
who can demonstrate in thee manner indicated their resistance to this conditioning,
and their commitment to thee ideas ov thee Temple.&nbsp;
<hr>
<center>
<h3>
THEE SIGIL OV 3 LIQUIDS</h3></center>
This ritual should be performed alone, on thee 23rd ov thee month, beginning
at 2300 hours, in a place where you will have no interruptions or distractions.
Within thee limits ov what is practical, you should arrange thee environment
and atmosphere to be as conducive as possible to thee execution ov this
Sigil for yourself.
<p>If at all possible a candle should be thee only source ov light.
<br>This Sigil must be performed naked.
<p>One ov thee aims ov thee ritual is to concentrate your attention and
energy on your most intense sexual fantasy. To do this you must first decide
what it is and write it down on a piece ov paper. It should be what you
think would generate in you thee maximum possible excitement, pleasure
and fulfilment, regardless ov thee identity, sex or age ov those who take
part with you, alive and guiltless. It is essential to be completely honest
with yourself, and not write something because you think it might satisfy
other people - remember thee purpose ov thee Sigil is to really make these
things happen.
<p>Once you have written thee fantasy on thee piece ov paper, you have
to make thee paper special. To do this it must be touched by thee three
liquids ov thee body. That is, spit, blood, and OV, which is thee Temple
name for thee fluids obtained by masturbation - semen from thee male and
lubrication from thee female.
<p>For example, first let a few drops ov spit fall onto thee page, next
a few drops ov blood. You must use some kind ov sharp and clean instrument
to do this. Remember only a small quantity is required and you should use
your common sense in terms ov thee method employed and ov hygiene both
before and afterwards.
<p>Lastly, and in any way that is most pleasurable to you, bring yourself
to orgasm and allow thee OV to touch thee paper. While you are doing this
concentrate not only on thee inscribed fantasy but also on thee idea ov
thee Temple and that fact that doing this sigil is inevitably bringing
you closer to what you really want. You must then attach a lock ov hair
from your head and also some ov your pubic hair to thee paper. Remember
these 2 hair types and 3 liquids may be incorporated on thee Sigil Paper
in any manner that feels appropriate to thee thoughts thereon described.
Thee basic actions outlined above should not be seen as a limitation.
<p>Leave thee Sigil Paper overnight to dry in a safe place. On thee next
day send it to thee Station. You do not have to attach your name to thee
Sigil Paper if you don't want to. All submission to thee Temple will remain
at all times absolutely confidential, and will be stored in a locked vault.
Sigils must be sent in a plastic baggie or wrapper. Completion ov 23 such
monthly rituals qualifies one as a full initiate ov thee Temple. Applicants
must also fill out and submit thee <a href="https://www.topy.net/topy/consent.html">Consent&nbsp;

any related matters. Thee Sigil can only be recommended to those who have
reached thee legal age ov consent in thee country in which they live.]&nbsp;

<h3>
THEE PROCESS IS THEE PRODUCT</h3></center>
Thee Sigil ov three liquids encoumpasses thee essence ov thee practical
methods we employ; but it should be remembered that everything we say is
only a guide to further experimentation and not a dictate to be followed
blindly in faith. Thee Temple is not about instruction, thee giving ov
set patterns and modes ov behaviour to follow, for that way no one learns
anything, there is no progress, no interchange ov ideas and l-ov-e.
<p>To slavishly follow ideas set out on a plate is to abdicate responsibility,
to lose one's individuality in favour ov an easy, but doubtful answer.
This may seem hard to those who feel uneasy about how to proceed, who are
used to doing just what they are told and no more, but that is thee point.
<p>Thee Temple is about getting rid ov those attitudes which ultimately
lead to indifference, getting rid ov thee fear ov experimentation and genuine
exploration; instead our methods create in thee individual a precise knowledge
ov their own existence, desires, and capabilities in thee most creative
and positive light possible. And they force thee acceptance of an attitude
ov living that will reflect that knowledge in a directly practical way.
<p>It is only by embracing their individuality that thee Individual can
truly coum to thee understanding and fulfilment ov their goals. Anything
else is pointless, a waste ov energy, a misdirection ov purpose. So what
we are saying is that while thee basic format is one that can be used by
anyone, it is also one that requires absolutely thee direct and personal
input ov thee Individual to be wholly and perfectly effective. Specific
details should and can only be arrived at by you. And they can include
or exclude anything that we have said: intent is all; and an ability to
focus on thee goal.
<p>Sigils serve as a direct means to make what you want to happen more
likely
to happen. But they are quite different from systems based on faith and
false promises. They cannot guarantee anything; they can only help release
thee potential that already exists within. And as it is a system for thee
Individual there is no right or wrong way: what is right for one person
may be entirely inappropriate for another. Therefore thee method is one
that must be developed personally, so that thee Sigil as performed by you
is something wholly ov your own making, reflecting your own personalities
and experiences.
<p>We offer only guidance and encouragement, not instructions and rules
to obey. We leave those to thee Controllers, thee ones who seek to generate
uniformity ov thought, and who strive to create a passive and compliant
populace thinking along rigid and conditioned lines, unable to take responsibility
for their own lives and actions.
<p>We are sickened by thee negative attitudes ov right and wrong that are
promulgated in thee mass media: that if you do this you cannot do that;
if you think this, you cannot think that. It is a system that destroys
thee Individual; destroys thee ability to think, to question, to force
thee hand ov chance; destroys thee will to live according to who you really
are and not according to who they say you are.
<br>Sigils break down this conditioning, awakening thee possibility ov
change and experimentation, giving back thee joy ov a life rich in experience
and challenge. Sigils are as much about learning as anything else. Not
only learning thee method that works for you, but also learning who it
is you really are, what it is you really want. A result ov this is that
it may take some time before you discover thee method ov working that is
best for you, and you may find that thee results ov your Sigils are not
as expected. This is not thee result ov getting it wrong, it is thee natural
response caused by thee first steps on a road ov discovery.
<p>For example, things may not happen in thee order you had expected, or
they may take a different form. Thee identity ov thee people involved may
be unexpected. But if you examine thee results ov your work closely and
honestly you will find that these differences, these moves away from thee
preconceived, reflect thee true aim hidden within thee Sigil, thee underlying
qualities ov it.
<p>Thee reason for this is that your conscious image is not thee real object
ov your desire; thee conscious wish, after all, being subject to thee conditioned
responses thee Sigil is designed to break down. Thee results are often
more expansive than you could have dreamed, more radical than you would
have consciously dared hope. Put simply, what you expect is not always
what you really want. And what you think you want is not always what your
really want.
<p>Our concern is with thee Individual in thee modern world. Accordingly
our methods are designed to meet thee circumstances that prevail today.
They are not Occult in thee way that word is usually understood, only thee
intuitive use ov that which we already know directed with purpose. It is
a maximisation ov thee powers ov thee brain, a joining together ov conscious
and subconscious will so that through thee use ov Sigils thee Individual
can move towards a desired goal free from thee constraint ov confused ideals
and personal contradictions.
<p>Unlike much that is called Occult we do not rely on dogma, mystification,
references to orthodoxy, or thee mimicking ov previously effective but
now redundant ritual rules. We believe that thee strength needed is already
living in each ov us. It is simply that we need to see clearly and act
on that vision. Naturally, this vision will be fiercely personal, not thee
dictate ov some other who tries to impose their will on thee Individual,
who leaves nothing to chance and tells us that dissent from thee common
ground is a sin.
<p>A great deal ov energy is wasted on arguing over thee validity ov much
that falls under thee general heading ov "Occult", whether things are real
or imagined. Much ov thee evidence to date is confusing, partial or fabricated
to meet a given need. It is better by far to accept "occult" experiences
as they occur, to recognise and interpret them personally without trying
to fit them into a pre-defined system.
<p>Thee Sigil strengthens basic human skills, reawakens thee intuitive
understanding ov thee relationships between events, breaks down linear
modes ov thought that offer only tunnel vision and answers that are defined
in thee question itself. Thee Temple believes that thee best judge ov truth
is experience, combined with an attitude that engenders a discriminating
eye hampered neither by prejudice nor fear.
<p>Thee Sigil is thee internal working ov thee brain, externalised; thee
manifestation ov inclusive will directed outward to positive action.
<ul>
<li>
Thee moment ov orgasm is central to thee process. It is special and all
should be done to make it so. Thus we decorate thee moment as we would
a jewel, with all manner ov objects and actions that are precious and personal.
Like gifts to a Lover, we consecrate thee moment in L-ov-e.</li>

<li>
We say to make thee room or space ov work special. We say likewise ov thee
interior mood, for so thee one is physical, so thee other is psychick and
our aim is to join thee two to a single purpose.</li>

<li>
In sex, physical self-consciousness is abandoned in favour ov intensified
sensual pleasure. In sleep, everyday consciousness is abandoned in favour
ov thee subconscious thee world ov dreams. In Sigils, thee two states meet
in a single act; and so, there is released a special and potent energy,
a fertile power ov harmony transcending thee barriers ov thee conscious/subconscious
divide.</li>

<li>
Intuition and instinct are thee only pointers in everyday consciousness
to thee objects and methods from which to construct a potent Sigil. Thee
future is entirely ours to construct as we will.</li>

<li>
All must coum from experience, and all experience is ov value. It is simply
a question ov observation; seeing thee links, and drawing all without exception
into thee universe ov magickal intent and action.</li>

<li>
Sex is thee medium for thee magickal act, enacted physically and with direct
control ov thee Individual. It generated thee greatest power which, when
released, is diverted from its ordinary object and thrust with thee intense
force ov will towards thee fulfilment ov desire.</li>

<li>
All must becoum focused to thee single purpose in hand. It is a case ov
giving up all preconceptions, all inhibitions and preferences, for thee
work involves a totality and anything that gets in thee way ov coumpleteness
is as a vestige ov thee past which will remain to trick and trouble thee
matter to its detriment. Relinquish all control and prejudice in order
to reclaim and master it, redefined and in thee train ov informed desire.</li>

<li>
Sigilisation leads to thee realisation ov personal truth, and provides
thee means with which to express that truth in life.</li>

<li>
"E know what E will, and E will what E desire."</li>

<li>
Sigils are thee unity and integration ov Will, Desire and Knowledge. They
are thee process by which dreams becoum reality.</li>

<li>
It is certain to us that Sigils, enacted with true determination, and filled
with thee perfect strength ov a sincere desire, generate ov their own thee
necessary will for success. It is simply a matter ov intent and intensity;
thee practice in thee sure knowledge and acceptance ov result.</li>

<li>
Sigils are thee art ov transforming former belief into current knowledge
ov thee way ahead. Sigils are thee revealers ov truths, be they hidden
or put aside through fear or expedience.</li>

<li>
Thee Sigil is thee declaration ov intent. It awakens thee Individual magickally
to thee circumstances ov their life and in this way makes thee focused
desire more likely to happen. Sigils are not a way to guarantee success,
they can only open thee door for your own action. A Sigil might ensure
that an opportunity for what you desire becoums apparent to you, but you
must still act upon that knowledge for thee desire to be fulfilled.</li>

<li>
Without thee physical response thee psychick work is pointless. Be awake
not asleep to action.</li>

<li>
Thee more Sigils you perform, thee greater thee clarity ov aim you will
find within. A cumulative power ov activated will develops, and thee Sigils
becoum intensified in direction and effect.</li>

<li>
Thee rite ov thee Sigil should be enacted to produce an experience ov utmost
intensity. At thee moment when thee rising flux becoums ungovernable, when
thee whole ov physical and mental consciousness undergoes a spasm that
takes it beyond thee point ov return, at that moment all must be focused
upon thee Sigil.</li>

<li>
A Sigil can be designed to answer any desire, without limitation or constraint.
Thee aim need in no way be sexual. Thee Sigil encompasses all possibility.</li>

<li>
Thee result ov thee Sigil becoums a part ov thee life process. Thus it
may not bring obvious results immediately, but however long it takes you
can be certain that if thee desire was true, and thee intent pure, you
will be moving towards achieving thee desired goal; preparing and passing
through all thee necessary stages so that when thee moment is right you
will be ready and alive to it.</li>

<li>
As we have said before, thee methods described by thee Temple are guides
to Individual action. As long as thee Sigil contains thee basic element
ov focused will, all other details can be varied. Indeed it is essential
that thee rite be one that is reflective ov who you are, and so should
be thee result ov personal input intuitively arrived at.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
FAITH IS FEAR</h3></center>
Thee first lesson from which all other grow is thee simplest. We are mortal.
We all die. This is not a morbid wallowing in hopelessness. It is thee
ability to genuinely coum to terms with our physical transience that liberates
us all. Many visionary philosophical systems include 'The Small Death'
in their ideas under one name or another.
<p>We all die. This realisation truly assimilated can be turned to positive
use, in that it spurs one into action aware at all time is limited and
no life span is certain. Every second counts and must count. This realisation
can also be used unproductively, crippling an individual man or woman's
search for fulfilment ov all their needs and preventing for all their life
a complete integration ov every aspect ov their character and thoughts.
<p>Thee inevitability ov death can be used by outside forces as a weapon
to create fear. Religions use this weapon more blatantly than any other
suppressive social regulation systems. They use fear ov death to justify
Faith. Those who escape thee traps ov Religion through a first stage cynical
knowledge ov thee hypocrisy ov modern society and thee emasculation ov
their individual power to change anything often seek oblivion form this
knowledge, and so they use various drugs (tobacco, alcohol, tranquillisers
and opiates like heroin) as a substitute for Faith. They want to kill time.
Religion wants to side-step time. Both are actions based on Fear.
<p>Mankind spends a constant amount ov energy in self-preservation. Thee
very phrase 'self-preservation' implies a threat ov annihilation and is
triggered by fear ov death. So in a very real sense fear ov death is present
behind all normal functioning, it resides permanently in thee subconscious,
moulding our image ov ourselves in relation to an inevitable, inexorable
crisis ov death. But fear ov death could not be constantly present in our
day to day conscious mental functioning, this would be an intolerable burden,
as things are, but to behave 'normally' thee biological organism, thee
animal man represses its knowledge ov death to acquire comfort.
<p>As things are, so must they change. So we are all socially and biologically
conditioned to put away our fear ov death yet in a real paradox we becoum
too efficiently oblivious to this fear in our conscious life. Thee Temple
tries to reconcile all our consciousness. To do this embraces thee knowledge
ov our own inevitable death with courage and uses it to justify action
and thee proper use ov time.
<p>In actual fact, none ov us know how much time we have, when we do die
it ought to be with Zero Regret. Zero regret is thee magickal state ov
inner balance and calm acceptance ov thee mortality ov individuals and
thee use ov Zero Regret to channel all future action. Thee prefect state
is to be sure that no time is wasted, no energy repressed and no fear hidden.
In old language, we must experience thee small death ov literally facing
ourselves and thee reality ov a temporary metabolism, a limit on time.
Time can be a tool, a liberator, or an oppressor. When we claim time back
for ourselves we are at last learning to be free and effective. Control
needs time like a junkie needs junk. To escape control we must re-embrace
our given time.
<p>Initially thee human being has no apparent alternative but to succumb
to a negative appreciation ov death. To feel fear. Thee brain is genetically
programmed to survival and will not allow itself to believe that it shall
cease to exist. Thus, as we have already seen, thee subconscious mind will
seduce thee intellect into ignoring logic and fact, a condition bordering
upon hopelessness. It will ignore thee lessons ov experience and observation
in favour ov an inherited image ov existence and thee affect ov fear will
be repressed. He will immediately becoum vulnerable to a desire for Hope
that bypasses confronting his subconscious knowledge. Religion thrives
upon this. It requires only an act ov blind faith in exchange for guaranteed
Hope and salvation. It denies death and avoids thee facts.
<p>In short, Religion turns away from thee truth, thee Temple turns towards
it. If you face yourself, you face death and in this way only can you re-integrate
your entire character and all ov its levels ov consciousness and perception.
This cannot be stressed too much or too often. So in Religions all practical
thought must be swept aside in a flood ov faith. Answers becoum word, and
facts becoum sins.
<p>This thing Faith is thee foundation ov all Religious thought. So powerful,
yet fragile that Faith must be protected. Protected from doubt, protected
from questions, it is seen as a constant that will not even tolerate thought.
It causes, its real essence, death, are so entrenched in everyone's mind
that it has becoum thee basis ov every society, and so every society has
developed a system to protect it. Dogma.
<p>Thee equation, simplified, goes something like this: Dogma negates thought.
Thought is thee enemy ov Faith (therefor thee enemy ov Society). Individual
thought patterns are discouraged in order to preserve Faith inviolate,
to thus preserve Society, to preserve thee status quo and thee vested interests
ov thee keepers ov Faith and Dogma. It is in this web that Religion meets
Politics and they reinforce each other in a web ov deceit. Those in Power
have a personal interest in channelling individual thought down safe unthreatening
avenues geared to thee production ov materials and services that are to
thee 'benefit' ov society, ov a 'Greater Good'.
<p>In other words you sacrifice your time and your time is your most precious
commodity. When you take yourself back it becoums priceless. People are
deflected from thee theft ov their Time and trained to produce and consume
instead ov how to be engaged in their habitat and ideas. Politics organises,
Religion directs.
<center><i>"From a child ov five to an adult is a short step.</i>
<br><i>From a new-born baby to a child ov five is an appalling distance."</i>
<br>(Tolstoy)</center>

<p>Religion invades thee child's world. A child without guilt is thus given
guilt. A child without fear is thus given fear. Thee only salvation offered
is through Faith. Faith, it is suggested, ends death. Thee price ov cheating
death through Faith is, ov course, submission.
<p>People who are not satisfied with this situation, people who want proofs,
who wish to develop a system without guilt and fear that absorbs and uses
death as a positive and liberating knowledge are discouraged, ridiculed,
treated with suspicion and often deliberately misrepresented in thee media.
They are after all, a threat to Society to some degree, they strike at
thee core ov thee trick that controls us and so in a real sense they are
dangerous.
<p>Thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth is dedicated to thee re-acquisition by
individuals ov their allotted time. It encourages, it does not discourage,
it stands as an example ov what is possible. To be involved is to becoum
very special. With thee passage ov history, Society's control over Individuals
is so subtle it becoums imperceptible, perhaps even genetically inherited.
Its very power lies in thee face that even its figureheads and leaders
do not realise its processes. Control is invisible. Time is invisible.
Control is so able to shroud an individual's perception ov reality in trivia
as to becoum a uniform reality in itself. A reality that cannot ask itself
questions. That cannot even formulate a language capable ov setting questions
that might reveal thee truth.
<p>In an age ov collapse and transition we must find a language. A way
out ov thee corner donated to us by history. Thee human brain must develop,
becoum thee next step in evolution. It is simply; develop our latent neurological
power or truly die as a species. It is a war for survival.
<p>Through experiment, through exploration ov these latent powers, by visionary
use ov science and technology, and by thee integration ov experience, observation
and expression we must revere ourselves.
<p>A reality that cannot face itself becoums an illusion. Cannot be real.
We must reject totally thee concept and use ov Faith, that sham. We must
emasculate Religion. Thee 'Universe ov Magick' is within thee mind ov mankind,
thee setting is but an illusion even to thee thinker.
<p>Thee Temple is committed to building a modern network where people are
given back pride in themselves, where destruction becoums a laughable absurdity
to a brain aware ov its infinite and immeasurable potential.
<p>Thee Temple is committed to triggering thee next evolutionary cycle
in order to save this flawed but loveable animal man.
<p>Thee Temple is committed to developing a modern functional and inspiring
magickal structure engendering at long last thee completely integrated
and effective individual. And this network ov individuals is in turn inevitably
faced with a task ov action to communicate survival and social evolution
to others.
<p>We are thee first truly non-aligned and non-mystical philosophy.
<p>Fear breeds Faith. Faith uses Fear. Reject Faith, reject Fear, reject
Religions and reject Dogma.
<p>Learn to cherish yourself, appreciate intuition and instinct, Learn
to love your questions. Value your Time. Use mortality to motivate action
and a caring, compassionate and concentrated life.&nbsp;

ACTION</h3></center>
Involvement in thee Temple Ov Psychick Youth requires an active individual,
dedicated towards thee establishment ov a functional system ov magick and
a modern pagan philosophy without recourse to mystification, gods or demons;
but recognising thee implicit powers ov thee human brain (neuromancy) linked
with guiltless sexuality focused through Will Structure (Sigils).
<p>Magick empowers thee individual to embrace and realise their dreams
and maximise their natural potential. It is for those with thee courage
to touch themselves. It integrates all levels ov thought in thee first
steps towards final negation ov control and fear.

<h3>
WARNING:</h3></center>
Thee Temple has noticed various assertions and misleading claims appearing
in fanzines and thee press, made by certain personalities, designed to
imply a false interpretation ov our motives, intentions and internal affairs.
These people often feel a need for self-justification and are motivated
by concern with their own self esteem and self-image. Equally beware ov
these people's attempts to ingratiate themselves and appear friendly. Whilst
thee Temple attempts never to enter into a public discussion ov its policies
and decisions, and indeed tries to allow thee maximum retaining ov pride
and saving ov face by any Individuals expelled, nevertheless thee Temple
has in its files documentation to back up its own version ov any such actions,
should thee need arise. We try to be fair, we try to leave people self-respect,
we try to make it easy for Them to adjust to being expelled. If our silence
and our fairness are seen a weakness and abused, or exploited to damage
us all, then we will change our passive tactics to those ov protection
through active truth.
