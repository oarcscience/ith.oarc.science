### FREEDOM

**FREEDOM**

Yes, I know that the Truth has freed me from the bonds of fear.  
I am not afraid. I adore thee, Most High within me; I trust in Thee and
abide in that hope that knows no fear; I am Free Spirit and cannot be
bound.  
The One Life flowing through me is Perfect and Complete. I am not apart
from It. I am One with It in Marvelous Unity and Freedom; One with the
Complete Whole.  
I was born free and must always remain free. The realization of freedom
permeates my whole being and sinks into the innermost parts of me.  
I love it, adore it, I accept it.

*I am free*.

 

**FREEDOM FROM SIN**

I am free from belief in sin; there is neither sin nor sinner.  
There is no judgment against any one.  
God does not condemn, and man cannot.  
All fear of sin is removed from me; all theological belief in punishment
is gone from me.  
I do not allow myself to receive such suggestions, for I perceive that
they are lies.  
I am free from all lies and from all liars.  
I live by the One Power, and no thought can enter to disturb me.

*There is neither sin nor sinner*.

**FREE FROM SENSITIVENESS**

My feelings cannot be hurt.  
No one wishes to harm me, and there is nothing in me that can believe in
any separation from the All Good.  
I perceive that I am free from all people, and I cannot be harmed nor
mistreated.  
I have such a sense of unity with all that the circle is complete and
perfect.  
I love my friends and they love me, and that love is in, and of, God,
and cannot be marred nor hindered.

*I am filled with joy and love, forever*.

 

**I KEEP THE PROMISE**

I shall keep the promise that I have made to myself.  
I shall never again tell myself that I am poor, sick, weak, nor
unhappy.  
I shall not lie to myself any more, but shall daily speak the truth to
my inner Soul, telling It that It is wonderful and marvelous; that It is
One with the Great Cause of all Life, Truth, Power and Action.

I shall whisper these things into my Soul until it breaks forth into
songs of joy with the realization of Its Limitless possibilities.

*I shall assure my Soul*.

 

**LOVE GLEAMS THROUGH THE MIST**

Through the mist of human fear love gleams and points the way to
freedom.  
I now decree and declare that I am free from all sense of bondage.

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

I am made perfect and whole through knowledge of the Real Life within
me.  
No illusions can enter my thought.  
I know that there is One Power, and I know that this Power now protects
me from all harm.  
As Perfect Love casts out all fear, so my fear flees before the
knowledge of Truth.

*I am not afraid*.

 

**NO BONDAGE**

There is no bondage nor limitation.  
Every part of me moves in perfect harmony and freedom.  
I cannot be tied, bound nor made inactive, for  
I am Free Spirit, and the Power of my Life is from on High.  
There is no inaction nor false action,  
And I am now completely Free.

*I am free*.

 

**NO CONDEMNATION**

There is no condemnation in me nor operating through me.  
I am free from the belief or thought of men.  
I walk my own way, immune to all suggestion of condemnation.  
Only those thoughts can enter my mentality which I allow to enter.  
I do not, and cannot, receive adverse thoughts.  
Only those thoughts which are helpful and life-giving can find entrance
to my house.

*There is no condemnation*.

 

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

**NO FALSE HABIT**

There are no vicious nor false habits.  
Ever desire of my thought and heart is satisfied in the Truth.  
I do not long for anything nor feel the lack of anything.  
I am complete within myself; I am perfect within myself; I am happy and
satisfied within myself.  
I am One with All Life within me.

*I am free*.

 

**NO HYPNOTISM NOR FALSE SUGGESTION**

There is no hypnotism nor false suggestion.  
I represent the One Mind which cannot act against Itself nor can It act
against me.  
I am immune to all suggestion and cannot receive false thoughts, nor
harbor them.  
I am surrounded with a circle of Love and Protection.  
Asleep or awake, I am free from false thoughts.  
I see the nothingness of all belief in, or fear of, otherness; and I
know that The One and Only Mind, alone, can act.

*Only the Good can enter*.

 

**NO MISTAKES**

There are no mistakes; none have ever been made and none ever will be
made.  
Nothing ever happened in the past to hinder or hurt.  
There is no past, and I know, and can see, that there is no belief in
any past to rise against me.  
I live in the Now, free from any yesterdays or to-morrows.  
Now, I am Happy, Free and Complete.

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

My Word erases any and all beliefs in mistakes and sets me free.  
I Am Free!

*I am free from any beliefs in the past*.

 

**THERE ARE NO RESPONSIBILITIES**

The Spirit has no responsibilities.  
Its work is already accomplished and Its purposes are already
fulfilled.  
The Spirit knows no want nor fear.  
It is complete within Itself and lives by virtue of Its own Being.  
I am Spirit and cannot take on the fears of the world.  
My work is accomplished and my ways are made straight before me.  
The pathway of Life is an endless road of Eternal Satisfaction and
Perfect Joy.  
My Life within me is Complete and Perfect, and has no cares nor
burdens.  
It is Free Spirit and cannot be bound.  
I rejoice in that Freedom.

*I rejoice in freedom*.

 

**THE TIME HAS COME**

The time has come, the hour has struck.  
The power from within has come forth and is expressing through my
word.  
I do not have to wait; to-day is the time.  
To-day I enter into all Truth; to-day I am completely saved and healed
and made happy.  
To-day I enter into my inheritance.

*To-day the Truth has made me free*.

**WITHIN THY LAW IS FREEDOM**

Within Thy Law is freedom to all who will believe.  
I believe in Thy Law and I love Thy precepts.  
I know that Thy Law is perfect and It is a delight to my Soul, for It is
illumined with Thy Words of Power.  
Thy Law is complete freedom to me, and to all for whom it shall be
spoken.  
I speak the Word of freedom to all, and all shall receive it.

*I am free in Thy Law*.
