### IMMANENT POWER

**AS LOVE ENTERS, FEAR DEPARTS**

As Love enters, fear vanishes.  
I am so filled with Love that no fear can enter my thought.  
I am not afraid, for I know that a Perfect Intelligence guards and
governs my every act.  
Perfect Love casteth out all fear.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

I am unafraid and strong in my faith in Him Who keeps me from all harm.

*Perfect Love casteth out all fear*.

 

**HE WILL KEEP THEE**

The Inner Spirit of man is God, and my Inner Spirit is the Realization
of my Life.  
I know that my Inner Spirit will keep me from all harm, and will not let
destruction come near me.  
I am unafraid in the midst of confusion, and unmoved in the face of
calamity.  
I am confident in the presence of seeming danger, and fearless before
any sense of trouble.

*He will keep me*.

 

**INFINITE LIFE WITHIN**

Infinite Life within me, which is God, guard Thou my feet and keep Thou
my way.  
Let me not stray from Thee, but compel me to do Thy will.  
I am guarded and governed by an Infinite Intelligence and an Omnipotent
Power.  
No mistakes can be made and none ever have been made.  
An unerring judgement operates through me and I am lead by the Spirit of
Truth into all Good and into all Peace and Happiness.

*Infinite Life within me*.

 

**MY FEET SHALL NOT FALTER**

My feet shall not falter, for they are kept upon the path of Life
through the Power of the Eternal Spirit.

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

Guide Thou my feet; compel my way; direct my paths and keep me in Thy
Presence.  
My feet are guarded, and I am guided into the All Good.

*He guides my feet*.

 

**NO HARM SHALL BEFALL THEE**

No harm shall befall you, my friend, for a Divine Presence attends your
way and guards you into The All Good.  
Loving kindness awaits you at every turn of Life's road.  
Guidance is yours along the pathway of experience,  
And an Infallible Power protects you.  
God, Himself, and no other is your Keeper.

*I proclaim this for you*.

 

**POWER TO LIVE**

I have the power to live the life of good.  
My power is from On High; it cannot be taken from me.  
It will not leave me desolate.  
Power flows through me and is in me, and  
I can now feel and sense it.  
The Power to live is in me and I cannot desert me.  
It is my power and is continually present.

*I am the power to live*.

 

**THE CIRCLE OF LOVE**

A circle of love is drawn around me and mine, and all.  
No harm can enter that Sacred Circle, for it is the Love of God.

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

It is a complete protection from all evil.  
"I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me."  
There is no evil and no harm.  
I am free from all sense of fear.

*Love surrounds and protects me*.

 

**THE CIRCLE OF PROTECTION**

I draw around me a circle of love and protection.  
No harm can enter nor find place within that charmed circle of life and
love, for it represents God's Loving Care and Eternal Watchfulness.  
I will rest within me now, and I will speak comfort to my Soul and tell
It of all the wonders of its life, safe from the din of strife and fear.

*I am protected from On High*.

 

**THE POWER WITHIN BLESSES ALL**

The Power within me is blessing all mankind, and is forever healing all
with whom I come in contact.  
The Power within me is God, and It must bless and help and heal all who
come near It.  
Silently the work goes on, and silently all are being helped by this
Inner Power which is operating through me.  
I will give thanks that my Power within is silently blessing and helping
everyone to whom my thought reaches.

*The Life within me blesses all mankind*.

 

**THE QUICK ANSWER**

My answer comes quickly and surely back to me from On High.

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

My answer will not fail me, for the Law of the Universe is the Power
through which it comes.  
I shall not doubt nor fear, for the answer is swift and certain.

*My answer comes*.
