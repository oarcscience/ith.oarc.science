### THE POWER OF THE WORD

**I CONTROL MY MENTAL HOUSEHOLD** **AND** **CONQUER ALL FEAR AND DOUBT**

I conquer my mental household and cast out all fear and doubt.  
Let my Word cast out all sense of fear and doubt and let my thoughts be
lifted unto Him Who lives Within.  
My Word has dissolved all fear within me, and has cast out all doubt.

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

My Word shall guard my thought and make me receive only that which is
Good and Perfect.

*I control my life*.

 

**MY WORD COMES BACK TO ME**

My word comes back to me laden with the fruits of its own speech.  
My Word is the Law unto my Life, and the Law unto everything that I
speak.  
O Word, go forth and heal and bless all humanity.  
Tell them of their Divine Birthright.  
Tell the stranger that he is not alone, but that One goes with him Who
knows and cares.  
Tell the sick that they are healed and the poor that they cannot want.  
Tell the unhappy of the joy of the Soul, and break the bonds of those
who are in prison.

My Word shall come back to me blessed of God and man*.*

 

**MY WORD SHALL BEAR FRUIT**

The Word of my mouth shall bear fruit.  
It shall accomplish and prosper, and shall not return unto me void.  
My Word is the law unto the thing whereunto it is sent, and it cannot
come back empty-handed.  
I send out my Word, and it is law unto my life.

*My Word is Power*.

 

**NOTHING CAN HINDER**

Nothing can hinder my Word from working;  
It will work, and nothing can stop it.

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

My word is the Law unto that thing whereunto it is spoken, and will
become fulfilled in the right way and at the right time.  
My Word is complete and perfect, and is the presence and the  
Power of the One Mind that is in and through all.  
I speak that Word and know that it will accomplish.  
I wait in perfect confidence for the Word to fulfill itself in my life.

*My Word is law*.

 

**O MAN, SPEAK FORTH THY WORD**

O man, speak forth thy word and be not afraid.  
Did you not know; have you not heard?  
His Divinity is planted within thee, and thy word is one with all
power.  
The Spirit of the Most High is thy Spirit, and the word of God is thy
word.  
Thy freedom is hid within thee, and thy inner light shall illumine they
way.  
Speak, man, and be free! Announce and proclaim thy works!  
Let thy word go forth with power, and thy Spirit shall conquer all.

*Spirit within me, speak*.

 

**THE POWER OF THE WORD**

The Word is a might Power, and that Word is in me and through me now.  
My Word is one with the All Good and cannot fail to accomplish the
desired ends.  
My Word goes forth with Power unto everything that I do, say or think.  
The Word is my Power by day and by night.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

I will speak the Word and trust in the great Law of Life to fulfill it.

*I speak the word in full confidence*.

 

**THE WORD OF POWER**

My Word is a Word of Power, for I know that it is the Word of the Great
God within me.  
My Word shall accomplish and prosper, and shall do good unto all who
call upon my name.  
My Word is a tower of strength and cannot be denied.  
It is complete and perfect here and now.  
My Word is the Word of God.

*My word is the word of God*.

 

**THE UNASSAILABLE TRUTH** **AND** **THE IRRESISTIBLE WORD**

The Truth within me is unassailable, and the Power of the Word is
irresistible.  
I can even now feel that my Word has gone forth with Power and Reality,
and that it will accomplish that purpose for which it was created.  
Limitless is its Power and wonderful are its works.  
It can be nothing less than the Almighty working in and through me.  
I will let this Word of the Spirit go forth from my mouth, and heal and
bless the world.  
It shall be as a strong tower unto all who call upon it.  
The Truth is Complete and Perfect, and is within me now.

*My Word is complete and perfect, now*.

**I BEHOLD IN THEE HIS IMAGE**

I behold in thee His Image.  
In thee, my friend, I see God and through you I feel His presence.  
I see in the hand that gives, His hand;  
And in the voice that speaks of Love, I hear Him speak.  
For His lines have gone out into all places,  
And from the highest to the lowest, all, all partake of His nature.  
"For He is all in all, over all and through all."

*I perceive that God is in all people*.
