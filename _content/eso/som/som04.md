### YOURSELF

Oh, weary heart, laden with earth's weight and care,  
Oh, feet, stumbling on the way, bleeding and bare,  
Oh, arms outstretched, and hands upheld in prayer,  
Oh, back, which so oft has felt the lash and rod,  
Oh, soul, which cries aloud for the living God,  
Oh, life, struggling to free itself from the clod;  
Know this: there is no power from without,  
Yourself must answer every fear and meet all doubt  
With some divine, indwelling power  
Which you yourself, upon yourself, shall shower;  
And giving, take, and taking, give  
Unto that life which you, yourself, shall live.
