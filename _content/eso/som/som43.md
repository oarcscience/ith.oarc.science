### THE PERSONALITY OF GOD

In our metaphysical abstractions we have come to the conclusion that
God, or First Cause, must be Infinite; and it is difficult to perceive
how a power which is Infinite can, at the same time, be personal. Yet
the soul longs for a responsive universe; and the heart yearns for a God
Who responds to the human desire.

To take from the individual his idea of God as a personally responsive
Intelligence, and leave him only a cold, unresponsive Law, is to rob the
individual of his greatest birthright and to throw him, naked and bare,
into the midst of an Eternity which holds no attraction.

To think of the Universe in terms of Law only, is to make of God only an
Infinite It, a cold an bitter Principle, lacking that warmth and color
which the soul craves.

This difficulty is removed when we realize that the Law of Mind is like
any other law; it is a natural force, and, like all law, should be
thought of from this angle. But back of, and working in and through the
Law, there is a responsive Intelligence

and a knowing Spirit, Which is God, the Father of all; and Who responds
to all.

We will think of Mind, then, as Law, and of God as Love; we will use the
Law and love the Spirit back of, and through, the Law. In this way, we
will be robbed of nothing, but will see that the way to freedom is
through Love and by Law.
