<p>Note: It is well for the student to carefully read and study the following articles, as they have a distinct bearing on the preceding lessons.</p>  
<p align="center"><b>ABSOLUTENESS AND RELATIVITY</b></p>  
<p>Absolute is defined as, "Free from restrictions, unlimited, unconditioned." "The Unlimited and Perfect Being, God."</p>  
<p>Relativity is defined as, "Existence only as an object of, or in relation to, a thinking mind." "A condition of dependence."</p>  
<p>The Absolute, being Unconditioned, is Infinite and All; It is that Which Is, or the Truth. It is axiomatic that the Truth, being All, cannot be separated, limited nor divided; It must be Changeless, Complete, Perfect and Uncreated.</p>  
<p>Relativity is that which depends upon something else; and if there be such a thing as relativity, it is not a thing of itself, but only that which functions within the Absolute and depends on It.</p>  
<p>We wish to affirm relativity without destroying Absoluteness. This can be done only by realizing that the relative is not a thing apart from, but is an experience in, the All-Comprehending Mind. The relative does not contradict the Absolute, but affirms It; and the relative alone guarantees that there is an Absolute.</p>  
<p>The Absolute is Cause, the relative is effect; the Absolute depends upon Itself, being Self-Existent; the relative must depend upon the Absolute.</p>  
<p>We should be careful not to deny the relative, simply because it is not absolute. To suppose that there could be an Absolute without a relative, would be to suppose that there could be an unexpressed God or First Cause; this is unthinkable</p>

<p>and impossible. The Consciousness of God must be expressed, hence the relative. The relative is not apart from, but is in the Absolute; and, as such, it is perfectly good and necessary. Time, space, outline, form, change, movement, action and reaction, manifestation and creation, all are relative; but all are real.</p>  
<p>Relativity subsists within existence and inherent Life is potential and latent with limitless possibilities.</p>  
<p>The relative and the Absolute do not contradict each other.</p>
