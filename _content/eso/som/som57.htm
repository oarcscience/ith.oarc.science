<p align="center"><b>A MARVELOUS SENSE</b></p>  
<p>A marvelous sense steals over him who waits on Good, and in patience bides his time.<br> A feeling of some Unseen Presence silently creeps over the waiting thought, and the Voice of God speaks through the mist and says: "Be not afraid."<br> It is all for a purpose; and when you cannot trace, you must trust. This is not an illusion, but a reality; for time proves all things, and he who will wait for his time to come shall be rewarded; and Good shall come to him, for God Himself shall be his Companion and Champion.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I wait on Thee</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>COMPLETE CONFIDENCE</b></p>  
<p>My confidence in The All Good is complete.<br> My faith in the Power of Spirit is supreme.<br> I have no doubts nor uncertainties.<br> I know that my Good is at hand, and<br> I realize that no fear can hinder<br> That Good from making Its appearance in my life and affairs.<br> I know that my Life and Good are complete.<br> Evil cannot touch nor hinder my work.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_352"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 352</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I rest in security, for</p>  
<p>THE ONE MIND IS MY COMPLETE REFUGE AND STRENGTH.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am serene and confident</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>DRAWING THE GOOD</b></p>  
<p>I draw my Good to me as I travel along the Way of Life, and nothing can keep It from me.<br> My Good will always follow me.<br> I accept the Good and rejoice that it is with me.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I accept the Good</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>I FEAR NO EVIL</b></p>  
<p>"I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me."<br> I will not be afraid, for the All Good is constantly with me and is always near at hand to guide and comfort.<br> There is no evil in the Truth, and no power of darkness to hinder the Light from shining.<br> I will not be afraid, for there is One within Who protects and keeps me from all harm.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I fear no evil</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>I HAVE KNOWN, ALWAYS</b></p>  
<p>I have always known the Truth, and no fear can keep my inner knowledge from me.<br> My wisdom from within comes forth into daily expression.<br> Knowledge from On High is given to me, and I shall always be led of the Spirit.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I know the Truth</i>.</p>

<p align="center"><b>I MEET MY GOOD</b></p>  
<p>To-day I meet my Good; it knows me and will not let me depart from it.<br> My Good is at hand, and I cannot be robbed of it.<br> Good is forever expressing itself to me and mine.<br> I can even now see and hear and feel the All Good in and around me.<br> It presses itself against me, and fills me with a great surge of Life.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>My Good is at hand</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>MY ATMOSPHERE</b></p>  
<p>My atmosphere is attracting the Good; it is constantly on the alert to see and know the Good, and to bring it into my experience.<br> There is that within me that calls forth abundance and happiness from Life. I am surrounded with an atmosphere of Peace, Poise and Power.<br> All who come in contact with that great Calm of my Life are made strong and confident, are healed and blessed.<br> "Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bless His Holy Name."</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am hid with Christ in God</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>MY GOOD IS COMPLETE</b></p>  
<p>My Good is complete; it is finished; it is now here and is conscious of me and of mine.<br> I do not have to wait for my Good; it is at hand and ever ready to spring forth and express itself to me.<br> I accept my Good and gladly acknowledge it to be my daily companion.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_354"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 354</FONT></A></p>  
<p>My Good is mine now, and I can see it and feel it and know it.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>To-day I claim my Good</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>MY OWN SHALL COME TO ME</b></p>  
<p>From far and near my own shall come to me. Even now it is coming to me, and I receive it.<br> My own is now manifesting itself to me, and I see and know its presence. My own shall know and respond to me.<br> The drawing power of that inner Spirit within me is now attracting and drawing into my experience all that is good and perfect. There is nothing within me to hinder nor to delay it.<br> My own cannot be kept from me, neither can I keep my good away from me. I receive it now.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I now receive my good</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>MY OWN SHALL FIND ME</b></p>  
<p>My Own shall find me; no matter where I go, It will follow and claim me.<br> I cannot hide myself from my Own.<br> My Own shall come to me, even though I deny it; for there is nothing in me that can hinder it from entering and taking possession of my Soul.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>My own is now expressed</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>MY SOUL REFLECTS THY LIFE</b></p>  
<p>My Soul reflects Thy Life and rejoices in the happy thought that it looks on Thee alone.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_355"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 355</FONT></A></p>  
<p>O Soul of mine, look out and up and on; and reflect to me the wondrous Life of the All Good.<br> Look thou upon The One, and be saved.<br> Behold thou His Face forevermore.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>My Soul reflects Thy Life</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>OUT OF THE DEPTHS OF LIFE</b></p>  
<p>Out of the deep places of life my Soul has cried unto Thee and Thou hast made answer.<br> Out of the turmoil and struggle and strife I have come unto Thee, and Thou hast heard me and understood.<br> I shall nevermore be sad, for I have found what the Soul craves--the Inner Life and Love of the All Good.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Thou hast heard</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>SORROW FLEES FROM ME</b></p>  
<p>As the Great Joy of Life comes into my Soul, flooding me with its wondrous light, all sorrow and sadness flee from me.<br> I shall not grieve, for nothing is lost nor gone from me.<br> My own cannot be kept from me.<br> My own knows me and will follow me wherever I go.<br> I am filled with the Joy of living and the Great Peace that comes to all who believe.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am made glad forevermore</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>SUBSTANCE AND SUPPLY</b></p>  
<p>The Substance of the Spirit is my Daily Supply.<br> I cannot be without my Good.<br> I can see that the constant stream of Life flowing to me brings</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_356"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 356</FONT></A></p>  
<p>into my experience all that makes Life happy and worthwhile.<br> I rest in security, knowing that Infinite Good is within and is expressing through me.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I receive my good</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>THE EVER AND THE ALL</b></p>  
<p>Life always was and evermore shall be, "World without end."<br> All the Power there is, is mine now.<br> All the Life, Truth and Love of the Universe is now and forever<br> Flowing through my Soul.<br> The All Good cannot change.<br> I shall always have access to my Eternal God within me.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am Changeless Life within me</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>THE HOUSE OF LOVE</b></p>  
<p>I dwell in the house of Love;<br> "A house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."<br> My dwelling place is filled with peace and eternal calm.<br> Love attends me in my home of the Soul, and<br> Joy awaits upon me in the "Secret Place of the Most High."<br> My house is built for me by the hand of Love, and<br> I shall never leave this Home of the Spirit, for it is always present.<br> I shall abide in this home forevermore.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>My house is a house of love</i>.</p>
