<p>The upper section represents the Conscious Mind, the Self-Knowing Mind, which we call Spirit. The middle section represents the Psychic Sea, that is, the Subjective World; this is the world of thought forms and mental pictures. This has been called "The illusion of Mind," because it contains many pictures, which are pictures only, and have no real form behind them. As a picture that is hung on the wall is not really a person--but is simply a picture--so the Psychic Sea may contain pictures which, while they are real as pictures, are not real from any other sense. It does not follow that everything in the psychic world is an illusion, for it contains much that is true. We should be very careful to distinguish the false from the true.</p>  
<p>The lower section of the chart represents the objective world. This world also reflects many false forms, such as disease and limitation. They are not things of themselves, but are the results of wrong mental pictures in the Subjective World.</p>  
<p>Neither the psychic pictures nor the world of forms are self-creative; both are effects.</p>

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">This is the psychic's chart and should be carefully considered, as it shows that the Spirit, or Conscious Mind, operates through a mental field, or law, which is a world of reflections. Thought is first reflected into Mind and then into matter. Read again the meaning of the conscious and the subconscious aspects of being. The world of Subjectivity is the Psychic Sea and the Medium of all subjective action. From the standpoint of man's thoughts it may be false or true, according to the way in which he thinks. It is the picture gallery of the soul, both from the universal and the individual sense. The illusion of matter means that the false mental pictures will produce a false form in the world of objectivity. Mind is not an illusion, but might contain false pictures which would be illusions; matter is not an illusion but may take on false conditions. We must learn to separate the false from the true.</FONT></p>
