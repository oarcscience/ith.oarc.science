The Science of Mind, by Ernest Shurtleff Holmes \[1926\], at Intangible
Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THE SEQUENCE OF THE CREATIVE ORDER

In the creation of any form it is necessary for its image to exist in
Mind before it can come into realization in the external. The Law, being
only a neutral force, cannot initiate anything, and cannot, of Itself,
choose to create anything. It is a Doer only, not a Knower. The Word
alone knows; so we may assume that each word is a law unto itself,
through the One great Law of all Life.
