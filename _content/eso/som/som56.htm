<p align="center"><b>A SONG OF JOY</b></p>  
<p>There is a Song upon my lips to-day; it sings of the glad heart and the happy ways of Life.<br> I will listen to my song, for it carols to me the glad tidings of Great Joy, of Love and Life.</p>  
<p>It tells me of the Wondrous Journey of the Soul and the Boundless Life in which my life is hid.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am filled with joy</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>BORN OF ETERNAL DAY</b></p>  
<p>Child of All Good, you are born of Eternal Day.<br> There is no evening of the Soul, for it shall live forever.<br> It is Deathless and Perfect, Complete and One with the Everlasting.<br> No thought of to-morrow can disturb the calm of him who knows that Life is one Eternal Day.<br> No fear can enter where Love reigns, and Reason keeps faith with Hope.<br> The thoughts of the to-morrows and the yesterdays are swallowed up in the great realization of the Perfect Here and the Complete Now.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>To-day I completely accept my wholeness</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>I ARISE AND GO FORTH</b></p>  
<p>I arise and go forth into the Dawn of the New Day, filled with faith and assurance in the All Good.<br> I arise, I arise, I sing with joy!<br> I proclaim the One Life: "In all and through all."<br> I arise, I arise, I shout with gladness that is within me.<br> I declare this day to be Complete, Perfect and Eternal.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I respond to Life</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>INSPIRATION</b></p>  
<p>Come, Thou Great and Infinite Mind and inspire me to do great deeds.<br> Acquaint me with Thy knowledge and in Thy wisdom make me wise.<br> I would be taught of Thee, Inner Light, and inspired by Thy presence.<br> I will listen for Thy Voice and it will tell me of great things to be done.<br> I will walk in Thy Paths and they will lead me into All Good.<br> I will be inspired from On High.<br> O Wonderful Presence, flooding me, filling me with Thy Light,<br> Thou dost inspire me!</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I feel the inspiration of Spirit</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>THE DAWN HAS COME</b></p>  
<p>Out of the darkness of the long night the Dawn has come.<br> I rise to meet the new day, filled with confidence and strength.<br> I arise and go forth into the dawn, inspired and refreshed by the Living Spirit within me.<br> O Day, you shall never die; the sun shall never set upon your perfect glory.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_350"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 350</FONT></A></p>  
<p>For the Lamp of the Soul has been re-kindled with the oil of Faith,<br> And Love has cleansed the windows of Life with the spirit of gladness.<br> They shall nevermore grow dim with fear, for Perfect Love casteth out all fear.<br> I am renewed in strength through knowing Good.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>My light has come</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>I AM COMPLETE IN THEE</b></p>  
<p>Almighty God, Everlasting Good, Eternal Spirit, Maker of all things and Keeper of my Life, Thou art All.<br> Infinite Presence within, in Whom all live; Joy Supreme, flooding all with gladness, I adore Thee.<br> Eternal Peace, undisturbed and quiet, I feel Thy calm.<br> O Thou Who dost inhabit Eternity and dost dwell within all Creation, Who Dost live through all things and in all people, hear Thou my prayer.<br> I would enter Thy gates with joy and live at peace in Thy House.<br> I would find a resting place in Thee, and in Thy presence live.<br> Make me to do Thy will and from Thy wisdom teach me the ways of Truth.<br> Compel me to follow Thee and let me not pursue the paths of my own counsel.<br> O Eternal and Blessed Presence, illumine my mind and command my will that my Soul may be refreshed and that my live may be renewed.<br> As deep cries unto deep, so my thought cries unto Thee and Thou dost answer.<br> I am renewed and refreshed; my whole being responds to Thy love, and I am complete in Thee.<br> All my ways are guarded and guided, and I shall live with Thee eternally.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_351"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 351</FONT></A></p>  
<p>O Lover of my Soul and Keeper of my Spirit, none can separate us, for we are One.<br> So shall Thy Wisdom guide me, Thy Presence dwell within me, Thy Love keep me and Thy life envelop me now and forevermore.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I rest in Thee</i>.</p>
