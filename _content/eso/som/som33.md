### THE PERFECT UNIVERSE

We must realize the Perfect Universe if we wish to embody the greatest
good. If the Universe were not Perfect It could not exist for a single
moment. It is self-evident that we live in a Perfect Universe; and, if
so, then everything in It must also be perfect.

The Truth is Indivisible and Whole. God is Complete and Perfect. A
Perfect Cause must produce a Perfect Effect. Disregarding all evidence
to the contrary, the student of Truth will maintain that he lives in a
Perfect Universe and among

perfect people; he will regulate his thinking to meet this necessity and
will refuse to believe in its opposite. At first he may appear to be
weak; but as time goes on, he will prove to Itself that his position is
a correct one; for that which appears imperfect will begin to slip from
his experience.

To daily meditate on the Perfect Life and to daily embody the Great
Ideal is the way to sure salvation; this is a royal road to freedom and
is happiness to the soul of man. We cannot afford to believe in
imperfection for a single instant. Let us learn to look as God must
look, with a Perfect Vision; let us seek the Good and the True and
believe in them with our whole heart; let us say daily to our inner
selves: "Perfect God within me; Perfect Life within me, Which is God;
Perfect Being within me, Which is God, come forth into expression
through me and become that which I am; lead me into the paths of
perfection and cause me to see only the Good."

By this practice, the soul will become illumined and will acquaint
itself with God and be at peace. "Be ye therefore perfect, even as your
Father Which is in heaven is Perfect." <span
