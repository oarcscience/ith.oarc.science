### JESUS AS A SAVIOUR

Jesus stands forth from the pages of human history as the greatest
Figure of all time. His teachings contain the greatest lesson ever given
to the human race; and His life and works, while on earth, provide the
grandest example that was ever given to man.

In the Higher Thought no attempt is made to rob Jesus of His greatness
or to refute His teachings; indeed, the Higher Thought Movement is based
upon the words and the works of this, the most remarkable Personality
that ever graced our planet with His presence; and, until a greater
figure appears, Jesus will still remain the great Wayshower to mankind,
the great Saviour of the race.

Let us not waste time, then, in theological discussions which lead
nowhere; but, following the example set before us, let us also do the
works which He did. "The works that I do, shall he do also; and greater
works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father." <span
