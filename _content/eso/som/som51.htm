<p align="center"><b>HAPPINESS AND COMPLETION</b></p>  
<p>I am happy and complete to-day and forever.<br> Within me is that which is Perfect and Complete.<br> It is The Spirit of all Life, Truth, and Action.<br> I am happy in the sure knowledge of the Inner Light.<br> I cannot be sad nor sorry, but must radiate Joy and Life,<br> For Life is within me now.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am happy and complete</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>HERE AND NOW</b></p>  
<p>Perfection is already accomplished.<br> I do not have to wait for the Perfect Life.<br> I am that Perfect Life here and now.<br> To-day I express the Limitless Life of the All Good.<br> To-day I manifest my Completion in every part of me.<br> To-day I am saved.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Here and now I am healed</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>MAJESTIC CALM</b></p>  
<p>The Inner Mind is still.<br> The Soul reflects the Most High.<br> The Spirit of man is God.<br> In the great calm of the All Good,<br> I rest in peace and security.<br> My life is now reflecting the Perfect Whole.<br> I am Peace; I am Calm.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_324"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 324</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I am security and complete satisfaction.<br> I am One with God.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am filled with peace</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>NO LOSS</b></p>  
<p>There is no loss.<br> Nothing can be lost, misplaced nor forgotten.<br> There was never any loss nor confusion.<br> Creation is Perfect and Complete, and within the One are all things, and are all known to the One.<br> I am now in complete harmony with the Whole and I cannot lose nor misplace anything.<br> I am constantly finding more and more Good.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I know that there is no loss</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>OH, FOR A TONGUE TO EXPRESS</b></p>  
<p>Oh, for a tongue to express the Wonders which the Thought reveals!<br> Oh, for some Word to comprehend the boundless idea!<br> Would that some Voice were sweet enough to sound the harmony of Life.<br> But Within, in that vast realm of thought where the Soul meets God, the Spirit knows.<br> I will listen for that Voice and It will tell me of Life, of Love and Unity.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Speak to me, Spirit</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>O SOUL OF MINE, LOOK OUT AND SEE</b></p>  
<p>O Soul of mine, look out and see; look up and know Thy freedom.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_325"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 325</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Be not cast down nor dismayed; be uplifted within me and exult, for Thy Salvation has come.<br> Behold the wonders of the Great Whole and the marvels of the Universe.<br> Look out and see Thy good. It is not afar off, but is at hand.<br> Prepare Thyself to accept and believe; to know and live.<br> Let Life enter and live through Thee, Soul of mine, and rejoice that Thou hast vision so fair and so complete.<br> Rejoice that the Perfect Whole is so completely reflected through Thee.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>My light has come</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>SEEING THE PERFECT</b></p>  
<p>My eyes behold the complete and perfect in all Creation,<br> "In all, over all and through all."<br> I see the perfect; there is nothing else to see, and no suggestion of otherness can enter my thought.<br> I know only the perfect and the complete.<br> I am perfect and whole, now.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I see the Good</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>THE CIRCLE IS COMPLETE</b></p>  
<p>The Circle of Love is complete.<br> It comprehends all, includes all, and binds all together with cords of Everlasting Unity.<br> I cannot depart from Its Presence nor wander from Its care.<br> My Love is complete within me.<br> The Love of God binds me to Itself, and will not let me go.<br> I shall make a home for you, O my wonderful Love, and we shall journey through life hand in hand.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_326"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 326</FONT></A></p>  
<p>I shall sit in your Presence and learn the wondrous things You will tell me;<br> For You are God.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Love sits within me</i>.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p align="center"><b>THE THINGS THAT ARE</b></p>  
<p>The things that are, were and evermore shall be.<br> Time, Chance and change begone from my thought!<br> The Changeless is here to stay, and the Timeless cannot cease from Being.<br> The things that are shall remain, though heaven and earth should pass away.<br> I rest secure and safe within the Life of Endless Perfection and Completion.<br> My whole Being responds to the Realization of the Complete Whole.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>I am that which Is</i>.</p>
