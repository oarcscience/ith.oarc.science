<P>The height of heaven and the stars [thereof] are obedient unto thee, and thou makest to be opened the great gates [of the sky].

<P>Those who are among the holy ones are in terror of him, and the Two Lands, all of them, make acclamations to him when they meet His Majesty. Thou art a shining Noble at the head of the nobles, permanent in [thy] high rank, stablished in [thy] sovereignty, the beneficent Power of the Company of the Gods. Well-pleasing [is thy] face, <B>8</B> and thou art beloved by him that seeth thee. Thou settest the fear of thee in all lands, and because of their love for thee [men] hold thy name to be pre-eminent. Every man maketh offerings unto thee, and thou art the Lord who is commemorated in heaven and upon earth. Manifold are the cries of acclamation to thee in the Uak&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_141"></A><A HREF="#fn_140"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> festival, and the <B>9</B> Two Lands shout joyously to thee with one accord. Thou art the eldest, the first of thy brethren, the Prince of the Company of the Gods, and the stablisher of Truth throughout the Two Lands. Thou settest [thy] son upon the great throne of his father Keb. Thou art the beloved one of thy mother Nut, whose valour is most mighty [when] thou overthrowest the Seba Fiend. <B>10</B>. Thou hast slaughtered thy enemy, and hast put the fear of thee into thy Adversary.</P>
<P>Thou art the bringer in of the remotest boundaries, and art stable of heart, and thy two feet are lifted up (?); thou art the heir of Keb and of the sovereignty of the Two Lands, and he (i.e., Keb) hath seen thy</P>

<P>Thou hast made this earth with thy hand, the waters thereof, the winds thereof, the trees and herbs thereof, the cattle thereof of every kind, the birds thereof of every kind, the fish thereof of every kind, the creeping things thereof, and the four-footed beasts thereof. The land of the desert&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_142"></A><A HREF="#fn_141"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> belongeth by right to <B>12</B> the son of Nut, and the Two Lands have contentment in making him to rise&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_143"></A><A HREF="#fn_142"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> upon the throne of his father like Ra.</P>
<P>Thou rollest up into the horizon, thou settest the light above the darkness, thou illuminest [the Two Lands] with the light from thy two plumes, thou floodest the Two Lands like the <B>13</B> Disk at the beginning of the dawn. Thy White Crown pierceth the height of heaven saluting the stars,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_144"></A><A HREF="#fn_143"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> thou art the guide of every god. Thou art perfect&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_145"></A><A HREF="#fn_144"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> in command and word. Thou art the favoured one of the Great Company of the Gods, and thou art the beloved one of the Little Company of the Gods.</P>
<P>Thy sister [Isis] acted as a protectress to thee. She drove [thy] enemies away, <B>14</B> she averted seasons [of calamity from thee], she recited the word (or, formula) with the magical power of her mouth, [being] skilled of tongue and never halting for a word, being perfect in command and word. Isis the magician avenged her brother. She went about seeking for him untiringly.</P>

She made to rise up the helpless members of him whose heart was at rest, she drew from him his essence, and she made therefrom an heir. She suckled the child in solitariness and none knew where his. place was, and he grew in strength. His hand is mighty (or, victorious) within the house <B>17</B> of Keb, and the Company of the Gods rejoice greatly at the coming of Horus, the son of Osiris, whose heart is firmly stablished, the triumphant one, the son of Isis, the flesh and bone of Osiris.
