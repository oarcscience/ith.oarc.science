<B><P>48</B>. I am Isis, [and] I have come forth from the dwelling (or, prison) wherein my brother Set placed me. <B>49</B>. Behold the god Thoth, the great god, the Chief of Maat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_204"></A><A HREF="#fn_202"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [both] in heaven and on the earth, said unto me, "Come now, O Isis, thou goddess, moreover it is a good thing to hearken,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_205"></A><A HREF="#fn_203"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> [for there is] life to one who shall be guided [by the advice] of another. Hide thou thyself with [thy] son the child, <B>50</B> and there shall come unto him these things. His members shall grow,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_206"></A><A HREF="#fn_204"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> and two-fold strength of every kind shall spring up [in him]. [And he] shall be made to take his seat upon the throne of his father, [whom] he shall avenge,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_207"></A><A HREF="#fn_205"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> [and he shall take possession of] the exalted position of Heq&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_208"></A><A HREF="#fn_206"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> of the Two Lands."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_209"></A><A HREF="#fn_207"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></P>
<P>I came forth [from the dwelling] at the time of evening, and there came forth the Seven Scorpions <B>51</B> which were to accompany me and to strike(?) for me with [their] stings. Two scorpions, Tefen and Befen, were behind me, two scorpions, Mestet and Mestetef, were by my side, and three scorpions, Petet, Thetet, and Maatet (or, Martet), were for preparing the road for me. I charged them very strictly (or, in a loud voice), <B>52</B> and my words penetrated into their ears: "Have no knowledge of [any], make no cry to the Tesheru beings, and pay no attention to the 'son of a man' (i.e., anyone) who belongeth to a man of no account," [and I said,] "Let your faces be turned</P>

<P>towards the ground [that ye may show me] the way." So the guardian of the company brought me to the boundaries of the city of <B>53</B> Pa-Sui,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_210"></A><A HREF="#fn_208"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the city of the goddesses of the Divine Sandals, [which was situated] in front of the Papyrus Swamps.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_211"></A><A HREF="#fn_209"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></P>
<P>When I had arrived at the place where the people lived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_212"></A><A HREF="#fn_210"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> I came to the houses wherein dwelt the wives [and] husbands. And a certain woman of quality spied me as I was journeying along the road, and she shut <B>54</B> her doors on me. Now she was sick at heart by reason of those [scorpions] which were with me. Then [the Seven Scorpions] took counsel concerning her, and they all at one time shot out their venom on the tail of the scorpion Tefen; as for me, the woman Taha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_213"></A><A HREF="#fn_211"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> opened her door, and I entered into the house of the miserable lady.</P>
<B><P>55</B>. Then the scorpion Tefen entered in under the leaves of the door and smote (i.e., stung) the son of Usert, and a fire broke out in the house of Usert, and there was no water there to extinguish it; [but] the sky rained upon the house of Usert, though it was not the season for rain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_214"></A><A HREF="#fn_212"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></P>
<B><P>56</B>. Behold, the heart of her who had not opened her door to me was grievously sad, for she knew not whether he (i.e., her son) would live [or not], and although she went round about through her town uttering cries [for help], there was none who came at [the sound of] her voice. Now mine own heart was grievously sad for the sake of the child, and [I wished]</P>

<P>to make to live [again] him that was free from fault. <B>57</B>. [Thereupon] I cried out to the noble lady, "Come to me. Come to me. Verily my mouth (?) possesseth life. I am a daughter [well] known in her town, [and I] can destroy the demon of death by the spell (or, utterance) which my father taught me to know. "I am his daughter, <B>58</B> the beloved [offspring] of his body."</P>
<P>Then Isis placed her two hands on the child in order to make to live him whose throat was stopped, [and she said],</P>
<P>"O poison of the scorpion Tefent, come forth and appear on the ground! Thou shalt neither enter nor penetrate [further into the body of the child]. O poison of the scorpion Befent, come forth and appear on the ground! <B>59</B>. I am Isis, the goddess, the lady (or, mistress) of words of power, and I am the maker of words of power (i.e., spells), and I know how to utter words with magical effect.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_215"></A><A HREF="#fn_213"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Hearken ye unto me, O every reptile which possesseth the power to bite (i.e., to sting), and fall headlong to the ground! O poison of the scorpion Mestet, make no advance [into his body]. O poison of the scorpion Mestetef, rise not up [in his body]. O poison of the scorpions Petet and Thetet, penetrate not [into his body]. [O <B>60</B> poison of] the scorpion Maatet (or, Martet), fall down on the ground."</P>
<P>[Here follows the] "Chapter of the stinging [of scorpions]."</P>

<P><A NAME="page_162"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 162</FONT></A>&nbsp;<A NAME="page_163"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 163</FONT></A></P>
<P>And Isis, the goddess, the great mistress of spells (or, words of power), she who is at the head of the gods, unto whom the god Keb gave his own <B>61</B> magical spells for the driving away of poison at noon-day (?), and for making poison to go back, and retreat, and withdraw, and go backward, spake, saying, "Ascend not into heaven, through the command <B>62</B> of the beloved one of Ra, the egg of the Smen goose which cometh forth from the sycamore. Verily my words are made to command the uttermost limit <B>63</B> of the night. I speak unto you, [O scorpions] I am alone and in sorrow because our names will suffer disgrace throughout the nomes. <B>64</B>. Do not make love, do not cry out to the Tesheru fiends, and cast no glances upon the noble ladies in their houses. Turn your faces towards the earth and [find out] the road, <B>65</B> so that we may arrive at the hidden places in the town of Khebt.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_216"></A><A HREF="#fn_214"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Oh the child shall live and the poison die! Ra liveth and the poison dieth! Verily Horus shall be in good case (or, healthy) <B>66</B> for his mother Isis. Verily he who is stricken shall be in good case likewise."</P>
<P>And the fire [which was in the house of Usert] was extinguished, and heaven was satisfied <B>67</B> with the utterance of Isis, the goddess.</P>
<P>Then the lady Usert came, and she brought unto me her possessions, and she filled the house of the woman Tah (?), for the KA of Tah (?), <B>68</B> because [she] had opened to me her door. Now the lady Usert suffered</P>
<P>

<P><A NAME="page_164"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 164</FONT></A>&nbsp;<A NAME="page_165"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 165</FONT></A></P>
<P>pain and anguish the whole night, and her mouth tasted (i.e., felt) the sting <B>69</B> [which] her son [had suffered]. And she brought her possessions as the penalty for not having opened the door to me. Oh the child shall live and the poison die! Verily Horus shall be in good case <B>70</B> for his mother Isis. Verily everyone who is stricken shall be in good case likewise.</P>
<P>Lo, a bread-cake [made] of barley meal shall drive out (or, destroy) the poison, <B>71</B> and natron shall make it to withdraw, and the fire [made] of <I>hetchet</I>-plant shall drive out (or, destroy) fever-heat from the limbs.</P>
<P>"O Isis, O Isis, come thou to thy <B>72</B> Horus, O thou woman of the wise mouth! Come to thy son"--thus cried the gods who dwelt in her quarter of the town--"for he is as one <B>73</B> whom a scorpion hath stung, and like one whom the scorpion Uhat, which the animal Antesh drove away, hath wounded."</P>
<B><P>74</B>. [Then] Isis ran out like one who had a knife [stuck] in her body, and she opened her arms wide, [saying] "Behold me, behold me, my son <B>75</B> Horus, have no fear, have no fear, O son my glory! No evil thing of any kind whatsoever shall happen unto thee, [for] there is in thee the essence (or, fluid) which made the things which exist. <B>76</B>. Thou art the son from the country of Mesqet,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_217"></A><A HREF="#fn_215"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [thou hast] come forth from the celestial waters Nu, and thou shalt not die by the heat of the poison. <B>77</B>.

<P>balsam-trees&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_219"></A><A HREF="#fn_217"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> which are in the House of the Aged One in Anu (Heliopolis). Thou <B>78</B> art the brother of the Abtu Fish,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_218"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> who orderest what is to be, and art the nursling of the Cat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_219"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who dwelleth in <B>79</B> the House of Neith. The goddess Reret,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> the goddess <U>H</U>at, and the god Bes protect thy members. Thy head shall not fall to the Tchat fiend <B>80</B> that attacketh thee. Thy members shall not receive the fire of that which is thy poison. Thou shalt not go backwards on the land, and thou shalt not be brought low <B>81</B> on the water. No reptile which biteth (or, stingeth) shall gain the mastery over thee, and no lion shall subdue thee or have dominion over thee. Thou art the son of the sublime god <B>82</B> who proceeded from Keb. Thou art Horus, and the poison shall not gain the mastery over thy members. Thou art the son of the sublime god who proceeded from Keb, and thus likewise shall it be with those who are under the knife. And the four <B>83</B> august goddesses shall protect thy members."</P>
<P>[Here the narrative is interrupted by the following texts:]</P>
<P>[I am] he who rolleth up into the sky, and who goeth down (i.e., setteth) in the Tuat, whose form is in the House of height, through whom when he openeth his Eye the light cometh into being, and when he closeth</P>

<P>his Eye it becometh night. [I am] the Water-god Het when he giveth <B>84</B> commands, whose name is unknown to the gods. I illumine the Two Lands, night betaketh itself to flight, and I shine by day and by night.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I am the Bull of Bakha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, and the Lion of Manu&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>. I am he who traverseth the heavens by day and by night without being repulsed. I have come <B>85</B> by reason of the voice (or, cry) of the son of Isis. Verily the blind serpent Na hath bitten the Bull. O thou poison which floweth through every member of him that is under the knife, come forth, I charge thee, upon the ground. Behold, he that is under the knife shall not be bitten. <B>86</B>. Thou art Menu, the Lord of Coptos, the child of the White Shat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> which is in Anu (Heliopolis), which was bitten [by a reptile]. O Menu, Lord of Coptos, give thou air unto him that is under the knife; and air shall be given to thee. <B>87</B>. Hail, divine father and minister of the god Nebun, [called] Mer-Tem, son of the divine father and minister of the god Nebun, scribe of the Water-god Het, [called] Ankh-Semptek (<I>sic</I>), son of the lady of the house Tent-Het-nub! He restored this inscription after he had found it in a ruined state in the Temple of Osiris-Mnevis, because he wished to make to live <B>88</B> her name . . . . . . . . . . and to give air unto him that is under [the knife], and to give life unto the ancestors of all the gods. And his Lord Osiris-Mnevis shall make long his life with happiness</P>

<P>of heart, [and shall give him] a beautiful burial after [attaining to] an old age, because of what he hath done for the Temple of Osiris-Mnevis.</P>
<B><P>89</B>. Horus was bitten (i.e., stung) in Sekhet-An, to the north of <B>90</B> Hetep-hemt, whilst his mother Isis was in the celestial houses making a libation <B>91</B> for her brother Osiris. And Horus sent forth his cry into <B>92</B> the horizon, and it was heard by those who were in . . . . . . Thereupon the keepers of the doors <B>93</B> who were in the [temple of] the holy Acacia Tree started up at the voice of Horus. <B>94</B>. And one sent forth a cry of lamentation, and Heaven gave the order that Horus was to be healed. <B>95</B>. And [the gods] took counsel [together] concerning the life [of Horus, saying,] <B>96</B> "O goddess Pai(?), O god Asten, <B>97</B> who dwellest in Aat-Khus(?) . . . . . .&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> thy . . . . . . enter in <B>98</B> . . . . . lord of sleep . . . . . . the child Horus.

<B><P>101</B>. A HYMN OF PRAISE TO HORUS TO GLORIFY HIM, WHICH IS TO BE SAID <B>102</B> OVER THE WATERS AND OVER THE LAND. Thoth speaketh and this god reciteth [the following]:--</P>
<P>"<B>103</B>. Homage to thee, god, son of a god. Homage to thee, heir, son of an heir. <B>104</B>. Homage to thee, bull, son of a bull, who wast brought <B>105</B> forth by a</P>

<P>holy goddess. Homage to thee, Horus, who comest forth from <B>106</B> Osiris, and wast brought forth by the goddess Isis. I recite thy <B>107</B> words of power, I speak with thy magical utterance. <B>108</B>. I pronounce a spell in thine own words, which <B>109</B> thy heart hath created, and all the spells and incantations which have come forth from thy mouth, <B>110</B> which thy father Keb commanded thee [to recite], and thy mother <B>111</B> Nut gave to thee, and the majesty of the Governor of Sekhem taught thee to make use of for thy protection, <B>112</B> in order to double (or, repeat) thy protective formulae, to shut the mouth of <B>113</B> every reptile which is in heaven, and on the earth, and in <B>114</B> the waters, to make men and women to live, to make the gods to be at peace [with thee], and to make Ra to employ his magical spells <B>115</B> through thy chants of praise. Come to me this day, quickly, quickly, <B>116</B> as thou workest the paddle of the Boat of the god. Drive thou away from me every lion <B>117</B> on the plain, and every crocodile in the waters, and all mouths which bite (or, sting) in their holes. <B>118</B>. Make thou them before me like the stone of the mountain, like a broken pot <B>119</B> lying about in a quarter of the town. Dig thou out from me the poison which riseth and <B>120</B> is in every member of him that is under the knife. Keep thou watch over him . . . . . . <B>121</B> by means of thy words. Verily let thy name be invoked this day. Let thy power (<I>qefau</I>) come into being <B>122</B> in him. Exalt thou thy magical powers. Make me to</P>

He is Urmer (Mnevis) who approacheth every man <B>129</B> and every beast. He is like the god Sep who is in Anu (Heliopolis). <B>130</B>. He is the Scorpion-[god] who is in the Great House (Het-ur). Bite him not, for he is <B>131</B> Ra. Sting him not, for he is Thoth. Shoot ye not <B>132</B> your poison over him, for he is Nefer-Tem. O every male serpent, <B>133</B> O every female serpent, O every <I>antesh</I> (scorpion?) which bite with your mouths, <B>134</B> and sting with your tails, bite <B>135</B> ye him not with your mouths, and sting ye him not with your tails. <B>136</B>. Get ye afar off from him, make ye not your fire to be against him, for he is the son of Osiris. <B>137</B>. Vomit ye. [Say] four times:--</P>

<P>[The narrative of the stinging of Horus by a scorpion is continued thus]:</P>
<P>"I am Isis, who conceived a child by her husband, and she became heavy with Horus, the divine [child]. I gave birth to Horus, the son of Osiris, in a nest of papyrus plants.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> I rejoiced exceedingly over this, because <B>169</B> I saw [in him one] who would make answer for his father.

<P>for the child, [and] on returning to take Horus into my arms I found him, Horus, the beautiful one <B>170</B> of gold, the boy, the child, without [life]. He had bedewed the ground with the water of his eye, and with foam from his lips. His body was motionless, his heart was powerless to move, and the sinews (or, muscles) of his members were [helpless]. I sent forth a cry, [saying]:</P>

<P>with me the greatness of my affliction. <B>180</B>. There was no man there who set restraint (?) on his mouth, every person among them lamented <B>181</B> with great lamentation. There was none there who knew how to make [my child] to live.</P>
<P>"And there came forth unto me a woman who was [well] known <B>182</B> in her city, a lady who was mistress of her [own] estate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_236"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> She came forth to me. Her mouth possessed <B>183</B> life, and her heart was filled with the matter which was therein, [and she said,] 'Fear not, fear not, O son Horus! <B>184</B>. Be not cast down, be not cast down, O mother of the god. The child of the Olive-tree is by the mountain of his brother, 185 the bush is hidden, and no enemy shall enter therein. The word of power of Tem, the Father of the gods, <B>186</B> who is in heaven, maketh to live. Set shall not enter into this region, he shall not go round about it. <B>187</B>.

<P>Then Isis placed her nose in his mouth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> so that she might know whether he who was in <B>191</B> his coffin breathed, and she examined the wound&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_238"></A><A HREF="#fn_236"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of the heir of the god, and she found that there was poison <B>192</B> in it.

<P>leaped about with him like fish when they are laid <B>193</B> upon the hot coals, [saying]:</P>
<P>"Horus is bitten, O Ra. Thy son is bitten, [O Osiris]. <B>194</B>. Horus is bitten, the flesh and blood of the Heir, the Lord of the diadems (?) of the kingdoms of Shu. <B>195</B>.

<P>Then came Nephthys <B>203</B> shedding tears and uttering cries of lamentation, and going round about through the papyrus swamps.
