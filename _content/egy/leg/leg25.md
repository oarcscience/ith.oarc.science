### THE LEGEND OF THE DEATH OF HORUS THROUGH THE STING OF A SCORPION AND OF HIS RESURRECTION THROUGH THOTH, AND OTHER MAGICAL TEXTS.

### I.--INCANTATIONS AGAINST REPTILES AND NOXIOUS CREATURES IN GENERAL.

1\. Get thee back, Apep, thou enemy of Ra, thou winding serpent in the
form of an intestine, without arms \[and\] without legs. Thy body cannot
stand upright so that thou mayest have therein being, long is thy <span
id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_198) tail in front of thy <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_198) den, thou enemy; retreat before **2**
Ra. Thy head shall be cut off, and the slaughter of thee shall be
carried out. Thou shalt not lift up thy face, for his (i.e., Ra's) flame
is in thy accursed soul. The odour which is in his chamber of slaughter
is in thy members, and thy form shall be overthrown by the slaughtering
knife of **3** the great god. The spell of the Scorpion-goddess Serq
driveth back thy might. Stand still, stand still, and retreat through
her spell.

Be vomited, O poison, I adjure thee to come forth on the earth. Horus
uttereth a spell over thee, Horus hacketh **4** thee in pieces, he
spitteth upon thee; thou shalt not rise up towards heaven, but shalt

downwards, O feeble one, without strength, cowardly, unable to fight,
blind, without eyes, and with thine head turned upside down. Lift not up
thy face. Get thee back quickly, and find **5** not the way. Lie down in
despair, rejoice not, retreat speedily, and show not thy face because of
the speech of Horus, who is perfect in words of power. The poison
rejoiced, \[but\] the heart\[s\] of many were very sad thereat. **6**.
Horus hath smitten it with his magical spells, and he who was in sorrow
is \[now\] in joy. Stand still then, O thou who art in sorrow, \[for\]
Horus hath been endowed with life. **7**. He coineth charged, appearing
himself to overthrow the Sebiu fiends which bite. All men when they see
Ra praise the son of Osiris. Get thee back, Worm, **8** and draw out thy
poison which is in all the members of him that is under the knife.
Verily the might of the word of power of Horus is against thee. Vomit
thou, O Enemy, get thee back, O poison.
