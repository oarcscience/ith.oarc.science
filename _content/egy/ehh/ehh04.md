# CHAPTER II.

### THE EARLIEST EGYPTIAN CONCEPTION OF THE OTHER WORLD.

HAVING briefly referred to the origin and development of the magical,
religious, and purely funeral texts which, sometimes with and sometimes
without illustrations, formed the "Guides" to the Ancient Egyptian
Underworld, the form of the conceptions concerning the place of departed
spirits as it appears in the Recensions of the XVIIIth and XIXth
Dynasties must now be considered. To reconstruct the form which they
took in the Predynastic Period is impossible, for no materials exist,
and the documents of the Early Empire are concerned chiefly with
providing the deceased with an abundance of meat, drink, and other
material comforts, and numbers of wives and concubines, and a place in
Sekhet-Aaru, a division of Sekhet-hetepet, to which the name "Elysian
Fields" has not inaptly been given. In later times Sekhet-Aaru, or
Sekhet-Aanru, comprised all Sekhet-hetepet. Of Sekhet-hetepet as a whole
the earliest known pictures are those which are painted on the coffins
of

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

Al-Barsha, and of no portion of this region have we any detailed
illustrations of the occupations of its inhabitants older than the
XVIIIth Dynasty. To the consideration of Sekhet-Aaru, which was the true
heaven of every faithful worshipper of Osiris, from the time when he
became the judge and benevolent god and friend of the dead down to the,
Ptolemaïc Period, that is to say, for a period of four thousand years at
least, the scribes and artists of the XVIIIth Dynasty devoted much
attention, and the results of their views are set forth in the copies of
PER-EM-HRU, or the Theban Book of the Dead, which have come down to us.

In one of the oldest copies of PER-EM-HRU, i.e., in the Papyrus of
Nu, <span id="fr_8"></span>[1](#fn_8) is a vignette of the Seven
*Arits*, or divisions of Sekhet-Aaru; the portion shown of each *Arit*
is the door, or gate, which is guarded by a gatekeeper, by a watcher,
who reports the arrival of every comer, and by a herald, who receives
and announces his name. All these beings save two have the head of an
animal, or bird, on a human body, a fact which indicates the great
antiquity of the ideas that underlie this vignette. Their names are:--

Arit I. *Gatekeeper*. SEKHET-HRA-ASHT-ARU.

Watcher. SEMETU.

Herald. HU-KHERU.

From another place in the same papyrus, <span

"Secret Gates of the House of Osiris in Sekhet-Aaru" were twenty-one in
number; the Chapter (CXLVI.) gives the name of each Gate, and also that
of each Gatekeeper up to No. X., thus:--

I. *Gate*.

From the above lists, and from copies of them which are found in the
Papyrus of Ani, and other

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

finely illustrated Books of the Dead, it is quite clear that, according
to one view, Sekhet-Aaru, the land of the blessed, was divided into
seven sections, each of which was entered through a Gate having three
attendants, and that, according to other traditions, it had sections
varying in number from ten to twenty-one, for each of the Gates
mentioned above must have been intended to protect a division. It will
be noted that the names of the Ten Gates are in reality long sentences,
which make sense and can be translated, but there is little doubt that
under the XVIIIth Dynasty these sentences were used as purely magical
formulae, or words of power, which, provided the deceased knew how to
pronounce them, there was no great need to understand. In other words,
it was not any goodness or virtue of his own which would enable him to
pass through the Gates of Sekhet-Aaru, and disarm the opposition of
their warders, but the knowledge of certain formulæ, or words of power,
and magical names. We are thus taken back to a very remote period by
these ideas, and to a time when the conceptions as to the abode of the
blessed were of a purely magical character; the addition of pictures to
the formulae, or names, belongs to a later period, when it was thought
right to strengthen them by illustrations. The deceased, who not only
possessed the secret name of a god or demon, but also a picture of him
whereby he could easily recognize him when he met him, was doubly armed
against danger.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

In addition to the Seven Arits, and the Ten, Fourteen, or Twenty-one
Gates (according to the manuscript authority followed), the
Sekhet-Hetepet possessed Fourteen or Fifteen Aats, or Regions, each of
which was presided over by a god. Their names, as given in the Papyrus
of Nu, <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11) are as follows:--

Aat I. AMENTET wherein a man lived on cakes and ale; its god was
AMSU-QET, or MENU-QET.

Aat II. SEKHET-AARU. Its walls are of iron. The wheat here is five
cubits high, the barley

is seven cubits high, and the Spirits who reap them are nine cubits
high. The god of this Aat is RA-HERUKHUTI.

Aat III. AATENKHU. Its god was OSIRIS or RA.

Aat IV. TUI-QAUI-AAUI. Its god was SATI-TEMUI.

Aat V. AATENKHU. The Spirits here live upon the inert and feeble. Its
god was probably OSIRIS.

Aat V.

 

Aat VI. AMMEHET, which is presided over either by SEKHER-AT or
SEKHER-REMUS. This was sacred to the gods, the Spirits could not find it
out, and it was accursed for the dead.

Aat VII. ASES, a region of burning, fiery flame, wherein the serpent
REREK lives.

Aat VIII. HA-HETEP, a region containing roaring torrents of water, and
ruled over by a god called QA-HA-HETEP. A variant gives the name of this
Aat as HA-SERT, and that of its god as FA-PET.

Aat X.

 

Aat IX. AKESI, a region which is unknown even to the gods; its god was
MAA-THETEF, and its only inhabitant is the "god who dwelleth in his
egg."

Aat X. NUT-ENT-QAHU, i.e., the city of Qahu. It was also known by the
name APT-ENT-QAHU. The gods of this region appear to have been NAU,
KAPET, and NEHEB-KAU.

Aat XI. ATU, the god of which was SEPT (Sothis).

Aat XII. UNT, the god of which was HETEMET-BAIU; also called
ASTCHETET-EM-AMENT.

Aat XII.

 

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

Aat XIII. UART-ENT-MU: its deity was the hippopotamus-god called
HEBT-RE-F.

Aat XIV. The mountainous region of KHER-AHA, the god of which was HAP,
the Nile.

A brief examination of this list of Aats, or Regions, suggests that the
divisions of Sekhet-hetepet given in it are arranged in order from south
to north, for it is well known that Amentet, the first Aat, was entered
from the neighbourbood of Thebes, and that the last-mentioned Aat, i.e.,
Kher-aha, represents a region quite

 

<span id="img_04100"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

Aat XIII.

<span id="img_04101"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

Aat XIV.

 

close to Heliopolis; if this be so, Sekhet-Aaru was probably situated at
no great distance from Abydos, near which was the famous "Gap" in the
mountains, whereby the spirits of the dead entered the abode set apart
for them. We see from this list also that the heaven provided for the
blessed was one such as an agricultural population would expect to have,
and a nation of farmers would revel in the idea of living among fields
of wheat and barley, the former being

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

between seven and eight feet, and the latter between nine and ten feet
high. The spirits who reaped this grain are said to have been nine
cubits, i.e., over thirteen feet, in height, a statement which seems to
indicate that a belief in the existence of men of exceptional height in
very ancient days was extant in Egypt traditionally.

Other facts to be gleaned from the list of Aats concerning Sekhet-Aaru
are that:--1. One section at least was filled with fire. 2. Another was
filled with rushing, roaring waters, which swept everything away before
them. 3. In another the serpent Rerek lived. 4. In another the Spirits
lived upon the inert and the feeble. 5. In another lived the "Destroyer
of Souls." 6. The great antiquity of the ideas about the Aats is proved
by the appearance of the names of Hap, the Nile-god, Sept, or Sothis,
and the Hippopotamus-goddess, Hebt-re-f, in connection with them.

The qualification for entering the Aats was not so much the living of a
good life upon earth as a knowledge of the magical figures which
represented them, and their names; these are given twice in the Papyrus
of Nu, and as they are of great importance for the study of magical
pictures they have been reproduced above.

Of the general form and the divisions of Sekhet-Aaru, or the "Field of
Reeds," and Sekhet-hetepet, or the "Field of Peace," thanks to the
funeral papyri of the XVIIIth Dynasty, much is known, and they

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

may now be briefly described. From the Papyrus of Nebseni <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12) we learn that Sekhet-hetep was rectangular
in shape, and that it was intersected by canals, supplied from the
stream by which the whole region was enclosed. In one division were
three pools of water,

 

<span id="img_04300"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/04300.jpg)  
Sekhet-Hetepet (Papyrus of Nebseni, British Museum, No. 9900, sheet 17).

 

in another four pools, and in a third two pools; a place specially set
apart was known as the "birthplace of the god of the region," and the
"great company of the

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

gods in Sekhet-hetep" occupied another section of it. At the end of a
short canal was moored a boat, provided with eight oars or paddles, and
each end of it terminated in a serpent's head; in it was a flight of
steps. The deceased, as we see, also possessed a boat wherein he sailed
about at will, but its form is different from that of the boat moored at
the end of the canal. The operations of ploughing, and of seed-time and
harvest, are all represented. As to the deceased himself, we see him in
the act of offering incense to the "great company of the gods," and he
addresses a bearded figure, which is intended probably to represent his
father, or some near relation; we see him paddling in a boat, and also
sitting on a chair of state smelling a flower, with a table of offerings
before him. None of the inscriptions mentions Sekhet-Aaru, but it is
distinctly said that the reaping of the grain by the deceased is taking
place in Sekhet-hetep, or Sekhet-hetepet.

In chronological order the next picture of Sekhet-hetepet to be
considered is that from the Papyrus of Ani, and it will be seen at a
glance that in details it differs from that already described. Ani
adores the gods in the first division, but he burns no incense; the boat
in which he paddles is loaded with offerings, and he is seen dedicating
an offering to the bearded figure. The legend reads, "Living in peace in
Sekhet--winds for the nostrils." The second division contains scenes

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

 

<span id="img_04500"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/04500.jpg)  
Sekhet-Hetepet (Papyrus of Ani, British Museum, No. 10,740, sheet 32).

 

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

of' reaping and treading out of corn, but only three pools of water
instead of four. In the third division we see An! ploughing the land by
the side of a stream of untold length and breadth, which is said to
contain neither fish nor worms. It is important to note that this
division is described as SEKHET-AANRU. The eyot which represents the
birthplace of the god of the city has no title, and the larger island,
which is separated from it by a very narrow strip of ground, contains a
flight of steps, but no gods. In the left-hand corner is a place which
is described as "the seat of the Spirits, who are seven cubits in
height"; the "grain is three cubits high, and it is the perfect Spirits
who reap it." In the other portion of this section are two boats instead
of one as in the Papyrus of Nebseni.

In connection with the two pictures of Sekhet-hetepet described above,
it is important to consider the text which accompanies the older of
them, i.e., that of the Papyrus of Nebseni. The deceased is made to say
that he sails over the Lake of Hetep (i.e., Peace) in a boat which he
brought from the house of Shu, and that he has come to the city of Hetep
under the favour of the god of the region, who is also called Hetep. He
says, "My mouth is strong, I am equipped \[with words of power to use as
weapons\] against the Spirits let them not have dominion over me. Let me
be rewarded with thy fields, O thou god Hetep. That

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

which is thy wish do, O lord of the winds. May I become a spirit
therein, may I eat therein, may I drink therein, may I plough therein,
may I reap therein, may I fight therein, may I make love therein, may my
words be powerful therein, may I never be in a state of servitude
therein, and may I be in authority therein . . . . . . \[Let me\] live
with the god Hetep, clothed, and not despoiled by the 'lords of the
north,' <span id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13) and may the lords of divine
things bring food unto me. May he make me to go forward and may I come
forth; may he bring my power to me there, may I receive it, and may my
equipment be from the god Hetep. May I gain dominion over the great and
mighty word which is in my body in this my place, and by it I shall have
memory and not forget." The pools and places in Sekhet-hetepet which the
deceased mentions as having a desire to visit are UNEN-EM-HETEP, the
first large division of the region; NEBT-TAUI, a pool in the second
division; NUT-URT, a pool in the first division; UAKH, a pool in the
second division, where the *kau*, or "doubles," dwell; TCHEFET, a
portion of the third division, wherein the deceased arrays himself in
the apparel of Ra; UNEN-EM-HETEP, the birthplace of the Great God;
QENQENTET, a pool in the first division, where he sees his father, and

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

looks upon his mother, and has intercourse with his wife, and where he
catches worms and serpents and frees himself from them; the Lake of
TCHESERT, wherein he plunges, and so cleanses himself from all
impurities; HAST, where the god ARI-EN-AB-F binds on his head for him;
USERT, a pool in the first division, and SMAM, a pool in the third
division of Sekhet-hetepet. Having visited all these places, and recited
all the words of power with which he was provided, and ascribed praises
to the gods, the deceased brings his boat to anchor, and, presumably,
takes up his abode in the Field of Peace for ever.

From the extract from the Chapter of Sekhet-Aaru and Sekhet-hetepet
given above, it is quite clear that the followers of Osiris hoped and
expected to do in the next world exactly what they had done in this, and
that they believed they would obtain and continue to live their life in
the world to come by means of a word of power; and that they prayed to
the god Hetep for dominion over it, so that they might keep it firmly in
their memories, and not forget it. This is another proof that in the
earliest times men relied in their hope of a future life more on the
learning and remembering of a potent name or formula than on the merits
of their moral and religious excellences. From first to last throughout
the chapter there is no mention of the god Osiris, unless he be the
"Great God" whose birthplace is said to be in the region Unen-em-hetep,
and nowhere in it is there any suggestion that the

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

permission or favour of Osiris is necessary for those who would enter
either Sekhet-Aaru or Sekhet-hetep. This seems to indicate that the
conceptions about the Other World, at least so far as the "realms of the
blest" were concerned, were evolved in the minds of Egyptian theologians
before Osiris attained to the high position which he occupied in the
Dynastic Period. On the other hand, the evidence on this point which is
to be deduced from the Papyrus of Ani must be taken into account.

At the beginning of this Papyrus we have first of all Hymns to Ra and
Osiris, and the famous Judgment Scene which is familiar to all. We see
the heart of Ani being weighed in the Balance against the symbol of
righteousness in the presence of the Great Company of the Gods, and the
weighing takes place at one end of the house of Osiris, whilst Osiris
sits in his shrine at the other. The "guardian of the Balance" is
Anubis, and the registrar is Thoth, the scribe of the gods, who is seen
noting the result of the weighing. In the picture the beam of the
Balance is quite level, which shows that the heart of Ani exactly
counterbalances the symbol of righteousness. This result Thoth announces
to the gods in the following words, "In very truth the heart of Osiris
hath been weighed, and his soul hath stood as a witness for him; its
case is right (i.e., it hath been found true by trial) in the Great
Balance. No wickedness hath been found in him, he hath not purloined the
offerings in the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

temples, <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14) and he hath done no evil by
deed or word whilst he was upon earth." The gods in their reply accept
Thoth's report, and declare that, so far as they are concerned, Ani has
committed neither sin nor evil. Further, they go on to say that he shall
not be delivered over to the monster Amemet, and they order that he
shall have offerings, that he shall have the power to go into the
presence of Osiris, and that he shall have a homestead, or allotment, in
Sekhet-hetepet for ever. We next see Ani being led into the presence of
Osiris by Horus, the son of Isis, who reports that the heart of Ani hath
sinned against no god or goddess; as it hath also been found just and
righteous according to the written laws of the gods, he asks that Ani
may have cakes and ale given to him, and the power to appear before
Osiris, and that he may take his place among the "Followers of Horus,"
and be like them for ever.

Now from this evidence it is clear that Ani was considered to have
merited his reward in Sekhet-hetepet by the righteousness and integrity
of his life upon earth as regards his fellow-man, and by the reverence
and worship which he paid to every god and every goddess; in other
words, it is made to appear that he had earned his reward, or had
justified himself by his works. Because his heart had emerged

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

triumphantly from its trial the gods decreed for him the right to appear
in the presence of the god Osiris, and ordered him to be provided with a
homestead in Sekhet-hetep. There is no mention of any repentance on
Ani's part for wrong done; indeed, he says definitely, "There is no sin
in my body. I have not uttered wittingly that which is untrue, and I
have committed no act having a double motive \[in my mind\]." As he was
troubled by no remembrance of sin, his conscience was clear, and he
expected to receive his reward, not as an act of mercy on the part of
the gods, but as an act of justice. Thus it would seem that repentance
played no part in the religion of the primitive inhabitants of Egypt,
and that a man atoned for his misdeeds by the giving of offerings, by
sacrifice, and by worship. On the other hand, Nebseni is made to say to
the god of Sekhet-hetep, "Let me be rewarded with thy fields, O Hetep;
but do thou according to thy will, O lord of the winds." This petition
reveals a frame of mind which recognizes submissively the omnipotence of
the god's will, and the words "do thou according to thy will" are no
doubt the equivalent of those which men of all nations and in every age
have prayed--"Thy will be done."

The descriptions of the pictures of Sekhet-hetep given above make it
evident that the views expressed in the Papyrus of Nebseni differ in
some important details from those which we find in the Papyrus of Ani,
but whether this difference is due to some general

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

development in religious thought, which took place in the interval
between the periods when the papyri were written, cannot be said. There
is abundant evidence in the Papyrus of Ani that Ani himself was a very
religious man, and we are not assuming too much when we say that he was
the type of a devout worshipper of Osiris, whose beliefs, though in some
respects of a highly spiritual character, were influenced by the magic
and gross material views which seem to have been inseparable from the
religion of every Egyptian. Though intensely logical in some of their
views about the Other World, the Egyptians were very illogical in
others, and they appear to have seen neither difficulty nor absurdity in
holding at the same time beliefs which were inconsistent and
contradictory. It must, however, in fairness be said that this
characteristic was due partly to their innate conservatism in religious
matters, and their respect for the written word, and partly to their
fear that they might prejudice their interests in the future life if
they rejected any scripture or picture which antiquity, or religious
custom, or tradition had sanctioned.

Certain examples, however, prove that the Egyptians of one period were
not afraid to modify or develop ideas which had come down to them from
another, as may be seen from the accompanying illustration. The picture
which is reproduced on [p. 53](#page_53) is intended to represent
Sekhet-hetepet, and is taken from the inner coffin of Kua-Tep, which was
found at Al-Barsha, and is now

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

in the British Museum (No. 30,840); it dates front the period of the
XIth Dynasty. From this we see that the country of the blessed was
rectangular in shape, and surrounded by water, and intersected by
streams, and that, in addition to large tracts of land, there were
numbers of eyots belonging to it. In many pictures these eyots are
confounded with lakes, but it is pretty clear that the "Islands of the
Blessed" were either fertile eyots, or oases which appeared to be green
islands in a sea of sand. Near the first section were three, near the
second four, near the third four, three, being oval, and one triangular;
the fourth section was divided into three parts by means of a canal with
two arms, and contained the birthplace of the god, and near it were
seven eyots; the fifth is the smallest division of all, and has only one
eyot near it. Each eyot has a name which accorded with its chief
characteristic; the dimensions of three of the streams or divisions are
given, the region where ploughing takes place is indicated, and the
positions of the staircase and the mystic boat are clearly shown. The
name of the god Hetep occurs twice, and that of Osiris once.

If now we compare this picture with that front the Papyrus of Nebseni we
shall find that the actual operations of ploughing, reaping, and
treading out of the corn are depicted on the Papyrus, and that several
figures of gods and the deceased have been added. The text speaks of
offerings made by the deceased, and of his sailing in a boat, &c.,
therefore the artist

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

added scenes in which he is depicted doing these things; and the lower
part of the picture in the Papyrus has been modified considerably. In
the second division it may be noted that Nebseni is seen laying both
hands on the back of the Bennu bird; there is no authority for this in
the older copy of the picture. In the illustration on [p. 55](#page_55),
which is reproduced from the coffin of Sen, in the British Museum (No.
30,841), a still simpler form of Sekhet-hetepet is seen; here we have
only nine eyots, which are grouped together, and no inscription of any
kind.

Still further modifications were introduced into the pictures of
Sekhet-hetepet drawn in later times, and, in order that the reader may
be enabled to trace some of the most striking of these, copies of
Sekhet-hetepet from the Papyrus of Anhai (about B.C. 1040), and from
that of Auf-ankh (Ptolemaïc Period), are reproduced on pp.
[59](#page_59) and [61](#page_61).
