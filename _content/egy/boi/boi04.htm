<P>Behold now, Isis speaketh,--<BR>
Come to thy temple, come to thy temple, oh An!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_3"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Come to thy temple, for thine enemies are not<BR>
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer--come to thy temple!<BR>
Lo I, thy sister, love thee--do not thou depart from me!<BR>
Behold Hunnu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_4"></A><A HREF="#fn_4"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the beautiful one<BR>
Come to thy temple immediately--come to thy temple immediately! Behold thou my heart, which grieveth for thee;<BR>
Behold me seeking for thee--I am searching for thee to behold thee!<BR>
Lo, I am prevented from beholding thee--<BR>
I am prevented from beholding thee, oh An!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_5"></A><A HREF="#fn_3"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
It is blessed to behold thee--come to the one who loveth thee!<BR>
Come to the one who loveth thee, oh thou who art beautiful, Un-Nofer,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_6"></A><A HREF="#fn_5"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> deceased.<BR>
Come to thy sister--come to thy wife--<BR>
Come to thy wife, oh thou who makest the heart to rest.<BR>
I, thy sister, born of thy mother, go about to every temple of thine,<BR>
Yet thou comest not forth to me<BR>
Gods, and men before the face of the gods, are weeping for thee at the same time, when they behold me!</P>
<P>

<P><A NAME="page_22"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 22</FONT></A></P>
<P>Lo, I invoke thee with wailing that reacheth high as heaven,--<BR>
Yet thou hearest not my voice. Lo I, thy sister, I love thee more than all the earth--<BR>
And thou lovest not another as thou dost thy sister--<BR>
Surely thou lovest not another as thou dost thy sister!</P>
<P>Behold now, Nephthys speaketh,--<BR>
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple!<BR>
Cause thy heart to rejoice, for thy enemies are not!<BR>
All thy sister-goddesses are at thy side and behind thy couch,<BR>
Calling upon thee with weeping--yet thou art prostrate upon thy bed!<BR>
Hearken unto the beautiful words uttered by us and by every noble one among us!<BR>
Subdue thou every sorrow which is in the hearts of us thy sisters,<BR>
Oh thou strong one among the gods,--strong among men who behold thee!<BR>
We come before thee, oh prince, our lord<BR>
Live before us, desiring to behold thee<BR>
Turn not thou away thy face before us<BR>
Sweeten our hearts when we behold thee, oh prince!<BR>
Beautify our hearts when we behold thee<BR>
I, Nephthys, thy sister, I love thee:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_23"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 23</FONT></A></P>
<P>Thy foes are subdued, there is not one remaining.<BR>
Lo, I am with thee; I shall protect thy limbs for ever, eternally.</P>
<P>Behold now, Isis speaketh,--<BR>
Praised be An&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_7"></A><A HREF="#fn_6"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> thou shinest upon us from heav'n every day,<BR>
Yet can we not behold thy beams.<BR>
Tehuti&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_8"></A><A HREF="#fn_7"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> protecteth thee, he causeth thy soul to be established within the Maadet boat,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_8"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> by<BR>
the power of thy name of "Iah"!<BR>
Come to me; for I would behold thee and thy beauties by means of the Uazit eye,--&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A><BR>
By the power of thy name of "Lord of the six festivals"!<BR>
Thy royal attendants are by thy side, nor go they forth from thee;<BR>
Thou takest possession of heaven by the greatness of thy terrors, and by the power of thy name of "Prince of the fifteen festivals"!<BR>
Thou shinest upon us like Ra, the lord--<BR>
Glow thou above us like Tum.<BR>
Gods and men live when beholding thee-shine thou upon us;<BR>
Brighten thou the two lands;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_11"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A><BR>
The two horizons are fitted for thy pathways.</P>

<P>Gods together with men are with thee;<BR>
No harm cometh unto them from thy shining,<BR>
Nor from thy journeying in the celestial boat&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_12"></A><A HREF="#fn_11"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> above.<BR>
Thy enemies have ceased to be, for I am protecting thee, oh Ra, lord!<BR>
Come thou to us as a babe, thou first great Sun god.<BR>
Depart not from us who behold thee<BR>
There proceedeth from thee the strong Orion in heaven at evening, at the resting of every day!<BR>
Lo, it is I, at the approach of the Sothis period, who doth watch for him,<BR>
Nor will I leave off watching for him; for that which proceedeth from thee is revered.<BR>
An emanation from thee causeth life to gods and men, reptiles and animals, and they live by means thereof.<BR>
Come thou to us from thy chamber, in the day when thy soul begetteth emanations,--<BR>
The day when offerings upon offerings are made to thy spirit, which causeth the gods and men likewise to live.<BR>
Praise be to the Lord, for there is no god like unto thee, oh Tum!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_13"></A><A HREF="#fn_12"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Thy soul possesseth the earth, and thy likenesses the underworld;</P>

<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_25"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 25</FONT></A></P>
<P>Lo, it is prepared for and containeth thy hidden shrine.<BR>
Thy wife is ready to protect thee, and thy son Horus also, as prince of the lands.</P>
<P>Behold now, Nephthys speaketh,--<BR>
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple, Un-Nofer, deceased,--come to Deddu!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_14"></A><A HREF="#fn_13"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A><BR>
Behold the bull, the begotten one!<BR>
Come thou to Anep (Mendes), the beloved enclosure!<BR>
Come to Khar! Come to the two Deddus (Mendes and Busiris), the place which thy soul loveth, and the souls of thy fathers likewise!<BR>
Thy son, thy child Horus, born of thy sister-goddesses, is before thy face.<BR>
It is I who doth illuminate and protect thee every day--<BR>
I will not depart from thee for ever<BR>
Oh, An, come thou to Sais, for thy name is "Sau" (protector)!&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_15"></A><A HREF="#fn_14"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A><BR>
Come to Aper! Behold thou thy mother, Nut, oh thou lovely child!<BR>
Depart thou not from her! Come to her breasts; abundance is therein!<BR>
Thy sister, too, is beautiful, depart thou not from her, oh son!</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_26"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 26</FONT></A></P>
<P>Come to Sais, oh Osiris, and to Tarud,<BR>
She who is called also Nisep, born of Pelses, deceased!<BR>
Come to Aper, thy city, thy seat, and to the temple of Deb!<BR>
Thou shalt rest beside thy mother eternally<BR>
She preserveth thy limbs and procureth terror among thy enemies, for she protecteth thy members for ever.<BR>
Behold the excellent sistrum-bearer! Come to thy temple!<BR>
Come, behold thou thy son Horus as prince of gods and men;<BR>
He taketh possession of the cities and the nomes by the magnitude of his terrors;<BR>
Heaven and earth are filled with fear of him,<BR>
And the barbarians are submissive under his terrors. Thy children are among gods and men,<BR>
And the eastern and western horizons are among the attributes of thy producing;<BR>
Thy two sisters are at thy side, purifying thy soul,<BR>
And thy son Horus admitteth thine attributes. There cometh forth funereal and other offerings--beer, bulls and geese--for thee:<BR>
Tehuti proclaimeth thy Heb-festival, and invoketh thee with his protecting formulae;<BR>
Horus covereth thy limbs with his protections<BR>
Every day thy son Horus glorifieth thy spirit,</P>
<P><A NAME="page_27"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 27</FONT></A></P>
<P>And he avengeth thy name by offerings for thy soul placed at thy secret shrine.<BR>
As for the gods, their arms bear libation vases for the purifying of thy spirit.<BR>
Come to thy children, oh prince, our lord, nor depart thou from them.</P><DIR>

<P>Lo! he comes!</P>
