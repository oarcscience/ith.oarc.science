<P>Let there be given for them cool water, and incense as to the excellent kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, who are existent in the underworld. Let them be permitted to go out and come in among those praised of Osiris, who is the breath of those in the underworld. Let it be caused that the beams of Aten&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_54"></A><A HREF="#fn_49"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> may fall upon their bodies every day.</P>
