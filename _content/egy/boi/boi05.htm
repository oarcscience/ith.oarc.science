<P>BEGINNING in front of the temples, during the Heb-festivals of Isis and Nephthys, and performed before the shrine of Osiris, Khent-Amentit,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_16"></A><A HREF="#fn_15"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the great God, lord of Abydos, in the 4th month of Inundation, on the 22nd day and continued to the 26th day. Purify all that which appertains to the temple; bring forth the utensils of the priestesses, who have performed the ablutions, their arms not being bared, their hair flowing over their shoulders and their heads crowned with woollen scarves; a musical instrument in their arms, and their names inscribed upon their shoulders, dedicated to the service of Isis and Nephthys. Let them utter praises in the temples according to this writing, before this God. Let them say,--</P>
<P>Behold the lord Osiris! (Repeat four times the formula.)</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_29"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 29</FONT></A></P>
<P>Is not his Kher-Heb priest&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_17"></A><A HREF="#fn_16"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> held in awe in this temple--great in heaven and great on earth? (Repeat four times the formula.)<BR>
Are not the two impersonators of the goddesses, and Hunnu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_18"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the beautiful, approaching to thy shrine at this moment? (Repeat twice.)<BR>
Do we not behold the excellent sistrum-bearer approaching to thy temple and drawing nigh, though thou hast departed from us?<BR>
Lo, Hunnu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_19"></A><A HREF="#fn_17"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the beautiful, passeth over the land hourly and yearly, at his proper-season;<BR>
He, the purified image of his father Tenen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_20"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> the essence of deep mysteries:<BR>
He proceedeth from Tum, the most excellent lord:<BR>
Perfect is he, like his father, the eldest god born of the body of his mother!<BR>
Come thou to us with thy attributes<BR>
Let those among us who travel not thy path be embraced by thee:<BR>
Beautiful of face and greatly beloved is the image of Tenen,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_21"></A><A HREF="#fn_18"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> male lord of love, adored when he exhibiteth himself.<BR>
His limbs fail from his being bound;--<BR>

</P>
<P><A NAME="page_30"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 30</FONT></A></P>
<P>Afflictions and evils exist not for thy members, for they are not of thy creation.<BR>
Oh thou, our chief, turn again thy face toward us,--thou mighty one, great one among the gods!<BR>
The path that is visible to thee is one that cannot be described, oh thou child Hunnu,<BR>
For it doth remain, though thou goest forth through heaven and earth with thy attributes!<BR>
Lo, thou art as the Bull of the two goddesses--come thou, child growing in peace, our lord!<BR>
Behold us! Thy essence existeth with us like as the essence of Tebba&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> existeth in the place of his destruction.<BR>
Come thou in peace, oh great child of his father Mentu!<BR>
Within thy temple fear thou not:<BR>
Thy son Horus avengeth thee, and he woundeth and carrieth away him who lurked in his den,<BR>
He whose name a daily flame destroyeth from among the gods--Tebha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_19"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> perisheth as waste matter.<BR>
As for thee, thou hast thy temple<BR>
Therein fear thou not Set, nor every calamity done by him or brought about by him.<BR>
Nut&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_20"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> proceedeth forth, and embraceth thee with joyfulness;</P>

<P>Travel thou through the land among us, odorous at thy coming forth.<BR>
Rebels behold us gazing upon thy face, glowing in its marvellousness.<BR>
Behold! our lord is upon our left hand, and behold the beautiful face of the beloved lord turned toward us!<BR>
Lo! the Bull, begotten of the two cows Isis and Nephthys!<BR>
Lo! there cometh the bearer of the bronze-coloured sistrum, as the praises increase;<BR>
Beautiful when he beholdeth him, the lord, among the seated ones,--<BR>
He, the progeny of the two cows Isis and Nephthys, the child surpassingly beautiful!<BR>
He appeareth unto us in thy image, like the one beloved.<BR>
Behold thou me, thy sister Isis, loved of thy heart, loved by thy body;<BR>
Loved art thou, because of the inundation of the land this day.<BR>
Travel thou among us, oh thou praised one,--<BR>
Raise us living in place of what thou hast made empty.<BR>
Come thou in peace, oh our lord, whom we behold; our prince!<BR>
Approach in peace; drive away tempest from before our temple;<BR>
Send thy protection over us like a male protector (Repeat.)</P>
<P><A NAME="page_32"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 32</FONT></A></P>
<P>Lo! the two goddesses! Behold Osiris, bull of Amentit, who is alone established!<BR>
Very great is he among the gods; the virile infant, the great heir of Sab,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_25"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> born the image of the God of Gods!<BR>
Come thou to the two widowed goddesses<BR>
There goeth about thee the whole, circle of the gods, and they meet with thee!<BR>
Behold, Set&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_26"></A><A HREF="#fn_22"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> cometh--grievous is his name when uttered near thy shrine, in presence of thy father, oh Ra;--<BR>
He is cast forth to contend with opponents<BR>
Come surely to thy priests, striving and grieving before thy temple;<BR>
Come surely to thy priests, in none other than thine own image!<BR>
Our lord sitteth down in his temple in peace alone; the great conqueror is his name.<BR>
After his long suffering he resteth, taking dangerous council against his enemies<BR>
He smiteth the land in his designs.<BR>
Go forth, great one with the gods;<BR>
And with thee the circle of the gods in front, with the instrument-for-opening-the-mouth,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that it may equal thy perfection before the gods.<BR>
Walk through the land entirely, great one which art a body, with the royal Uraeus upon his forehead.</P>

<P>He is carried within his heart;<BR>
At his coming, the whole speech of the god loved alone is found; his soul is exceedingly beloved.<BR>
Live thou in repeated union with the two goddesses;<BR>
Thy arms shall attain their desire now as formerly;<BR>
Thou hast proclaimed thyself under thy signet as a king of the circle of the gods--the lord!<BR>
Thy priests surely come; thy father Ra smiteth that which hath evil designs.<BR>
The circle of the gods surroundeth thy pathway, and they meet with thee:<BR>
Destroy thou the evil ones and the great calamity which has fallen upon the two counterparts, Isis and Nephthys:<BR>
Thy house is holding festival for the calamity (of evil-doers).<BR>
His enemies are cut off by disaster from him, when they behold him:<BR>
He overfloweth the land as is his custom.<BR>
He hath driven away disaster from Nut; the surface, of the earth hath he laid bare, and carried it away in his chariot:<BR>
He hath carried away and smitten the enemies of thy father, oh Ra, to justify himself. Thy son Horus is fettered so that he may not answer to thee:</P>
<P><A NAME="page_34"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 34</FONT></A></P>
<P>Traverse thou the land in thy manifestations, stride thou like Nut over the four quarters of the world.<BR>
Thou passest over the land, above the godly temples of the two goddesses, Isis and Nephthys:<BR>
At thy proceeding thou art exalted twice over.<BR>
Behold, Set in his chariot--thy enemies are not his enemies!<BR>
Come thou into thy temple, oh Osiris, and seek for thy place;<BR>
Behold thou, and hearken to the speech of Horus, lying in the arms of his mother, Isis:<BR>
Overcome thou indeed in the two lands, oh lord!<BR>
Carry out thy word, preserve it in the temple, inscribe thou it, oh great God;<BR>
Restrain with thy manifestations, in thy going forth from thy temple, oh Osiris!<BR>
Come thou in peace to thy seat, oh lord, Conqueror!<BR>
Show us the great Bull, the lovable lord, as he shall become!<BR>
Thy duck, thy sister, Isis, produceth the sweet odours belonging to thee and with thee,<BR>
Yet thy way doth not tend toward us, oh our lord!<BR>
Give thou life from the beginning unto believers!</P>
<P><A NAME="page_35"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 35</FONT></A></P>
<P>Hail! Guard thou the inundation in the land of Tesdu,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_28"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> like as thou hast never done before!<BR>
Thy sister cometh to thee; she openeth for thee her arms, oh great god, living, great, beloved!<BR>
She dandleth thy son in front of thee, at the head of the south and the north!<BR>
The lord of ornamentation, the great male one in the heaven of the gods, is decorated!<BR>
Thou camest from thy mother, Nut; she spread herself out before thee at thy coming forth from her;<BR>
She protected thy limbs from all evil; she followed thee as her babe.<BR>
She drove away every danger from thy limbs, chiefly that which was harmful to thee, thou child, the lord.<BR>
He goeth forth from Nut; he gazeth upon this land as its head, he the only lord, the child!<BR>
Thou goest forth from this cow which conceiveth from the gods, oh thou opener of the underworld in its time!<BR>
Lo! the child followeth; thy father Ra remains not;<BR>
Thy son Horus shall take vengeance for thee upon the enemy for every calamity brought about by him.</P>

<P><A NAME="page_36"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 36</FONT></A></P>
<P>Come thou to thy temple, and fear thou not!<BR>
Come thou to thy temple, and fear thou not!<BR>
Behold the two impersonators of the goddesses behold the excellent sistrum-bearers!<BR>
Approach to thy temple! Be thou exalted twice over in thy temple!<BR>
Lo, the gods are in their places! I am the glorious sister of her elder brother!<BR>
Thy wife, the elder of thy mother!<BR>
Come thou to me, running after my heart, which would look upon thee;<BR>
Thy back hath never been beheld by me-make clear the way to us, before me.<BR>
Behold Ra in heaven! Protect, oh Nut, the land!<BR>
Make a shadow in the land as doth Ra: inflame the heart, that thou mayest escape evil:<BR>
Inflame the heart, to cause thee to come after me!<BR>
Lo! thou canst not prevent it from turning me toward thee.<BR>
Firm are the dwellings of Osiris returning on his paths!<BR>
I am seeking after love: behold me existing in the city, great are its walls,<BR>
I grieve for thy love toward me-come thou only, now that thou hast departed!<BR>
Behold thy son, who causeth Tebha&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_29"></A><A HREF="#fn_25"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to retreat from destruction!</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><A NAME="page_37"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 37</FONT></A></P>
<P>Hidden am I among the plants, and concealed is thy son that he cannot answer to thee, while this great calamity remaineth!<BR>
Yet concerning thee, there is no likeness of thy flesh left:<BR>
I follow thee alone and surround the plants, each of which holdeth danger for thy son,--<BR>
Lo, I, a woman, in front of all!<BR>
Behold this male child! Lo, I know, I and the Opener-of-Ways, Osiris.<BR>
I go about thy ways, I turn back towards my elder brother, escaping from danger.<BR>
I inflame the hearts of hundreds of thousands, and ponder greatly upon the gods.<BR>

My arms are raised for thy protection; love thou me!<BR>
Love thou me in the two orbits of the Realms of Osiris, full of my pondering about thee!<BR>
There thou dost receive a fillet for the hair among them who dwell therein;<BR>
Breezes blow for thee with perfume, oh husband, elder, lord beloved!<BR>

Break open before us as the only Egg, oh strong one, valorous son!<BR>
Lo, this one is the opener-of-the-body, the masterful one--the god Seb is before his mother.<BR>
Great are my adornings, for that done in Amentit is beloved:<BR>
He hath vanquished disaster, he is lord of the dead, the Bull of Amentit, born of Horus-Ra of the two horizons, the child lovely to the one beholding him.<BR>
Come thou to us in peace twice renewed--remove thou thy penalties;<BR>
Drive away the evil moment, oh our lord!<BR>
Come thou to us in peace twice renewed! Praise the child!<BR>
