### VERSO COL. XVI.

(A row of figures, viz. 3 scarabs, 3 hawks, and 3 goats.)

\(1\) 'Armioout (otherwise Armiouth), Sithani, Outhani, (2) Aryamnoi,
Sobrtat, Birbat, Misirythat, (3) Amsietharmithat: bring N. daughter of
N. out of her abodes (4) in which she is, to any house and any place
which N. son of N. is in; she loving him and craving for him, (5) she
making the gift of his desire(?) at every moment.' You write this in
myrrh ink on a strip (6) of clean fine linen, and you put it in a clean
new lamp, which is filled with genuine oil, (7) in your house from
evening till morning. If you find a hair of the woman to put in the
wick, it is excellent.
