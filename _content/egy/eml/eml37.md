# CHAPTER XXVI

### The Religious Revolt of the Poet King

The Shelley of Egypt--King as a Prophet--The Need of the
Empire--Disturbing Race Movements--Fall of Cretan Kingdom--Hittites
press Southward--Khabri advance on Palestine--Akhenaton's War on
Amon--The New Capital--A Poet's Dream--Empire going to Ruin--Aton the
"First Cause"--A Grand Theology--Origin of the New Deity--Shu in the
Sun--The Soul in the Egg--The Air of Life--A Jealous God--The Future
Life--Paradise or Transmigration of Souls--Death of Akhenaton--Close of
a Brilliant Dynasty.

HERODOTUS was informed by the sages of Egypt that the Souls of the dead
passed through "every species of terrestrial, aquatic, and winged
creatures", and, after a lapse of about three thousand years, "entered a
second time into human bodies". If that belief were as prevalent at
present in these islands as it was in early Celtic times, we might be at
pains to convince the world that Shelley was a reincarnation of
Akhenaton. The English poet was born about 3150 years after the death of
Egypt's "heretic King", and both men had much in common; they were
idealists and reformers at war with the world, and "beautiful but
ineffectual angels". With equal force these lines by William Watson may
be applied to the one as to the other:--

Impatient of the world's fixed way,  
He ne'er could suffer God's delay,  
But all the future in a day  
Would build divine. . . .

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

Shelley's reference to himself in "Adonais" is admirably suited for
Akhenaton.

Mid others of less note, came one frail form,  
A phantom among men; companionless  
As the last cloud of an expiring storm,  
Whose thunder is its knell; he, as I guess,  
Had gazed on Nature's naked loveliness,  
Actæon-like, and now he fled astray  
With feeble steps o'er the world's wilderness.

A pard-like spirit beautiful and swift--  
A Love in desolation masked;--a Power  
Girt round with weakness; it can scarce uplift  
The weight of the superincumbent hour;  
It is a dying lamp, a failing shower,  
A breaking billow;-even whilst we speak  
Is it not broken? . . .

Like Shelley, too, Akhenaton appears to have resolved, while yet a boy,
to fight against "the selfish and the strong", whom he identified
particularly with the priests of Amon, for these were prone indeed to
"tyrannize without reproach and check". The Egyptian prince, like the
young English gentleman, began to "heap knowledge from forbidden mines
of lore", and "from that secret store wrought linked armour for his
soul"; he embraced and developed the theological beliefs of the obscure
Aton cult, and set forth to convince an unheeding world that--

The One remains, the many change and pass,  
Heaven's light forever shines, Earth's shadows fly.

From the point of view of the Egyptian Imperialists the reign of
Akhenaton, like that of Queen Hatshepsut, was a distinct misfortune. As
it happened, the dreamer king ascended the throne with the noble desire
to make all men "wise, and just, and free, and mild", just when

AMENHOTEP IV (AKHENATON)

From the statuette in the Louvre, Paris

the Empire was in need of another ruler like Thothmes III to conduct
strenuous military campaigns against hordes of invaders and accomplish
the subjection of the rebellious Syrian princes. Once again, as in the
Twelfth Dynasty, the civilized world was being disturbed by the
outpourings from mountainous districts of pastoral peoples in quest of
"fresh woods and pastures new". Crete had been invaded during the reign
of Amenhotep III; the "sack of Knossos" was already a thing of the past;
the great civilization of the island kingdom had received its
extinguishing blow, and thousands of the "Kheftiu" were seeking
permanent homes in the Ægean, Asia Minor, Phœnicia, and Egypt. Ere
Akhenaton's father had died, Thebes received ominous intelligence of the
southward pressure of the Hittites and also of the advance on Palestine
of the Khabri (? Hebrews)--the first "wave" of the third great Semitic
migration from eastern Arabia, known as the "Aramæan". The days of the
half-Iranian, half-Egyptian Tushratta were numbered; the civilization of
Mitanni was doomed to vanish like that of Crete.

Akhenaton began to reign as Amenhotep IV. With purpose, apparently, to
effect the immediate conversion of Thebes, he began the erection of a
temple to Aton (or Aten) in close proximity to that of Amon. Ere long an
open rupture between the priesthood and the Pharaoh became the chief
topic of political interest. Amon's high priests had been wont to occupy
high and influential positions at Court; under Amenhotep III one had
been chief treasurer and another grand vizier. Akhenaton was threatening
the cult with complete political extinction. Then something was done, or
attempted to be done, by the priestly party, which roused the ire of the
strong-minded young king, for he suddenly commenced to wage

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

a war of bitter persecution against Amon. Everywhere the god's name was
chipped from the monuments; the tombs were entered, and the young
Pharaoh did not spare even the name of his father. It was at this time
that he himself became known officially as Akhen-aton, "the spirit of
Aton" <span id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142)--the human incarnation of
the strange god. Then he decided to desert Thebes, and at
Tell-el-Amarna, about 300 miles farther south, he caused to be laid out
a "garden city", in which were built a gorgeous palace which surpassed
that of his father, and a great temple dedicated to "the one and only
god". Aton temples were also erected in Nubia, near the third cataract,
and in Syria at a point which has not beet, located.

When he entered his new capital, which was called "Horizon of Aton", the
young king resolved never to leave it again. There, dwelling apart from
the unconverted world, and associating with believers only, he dedicated
his life to the service of Aton, and the propagation of those beliefs
which, he was convinced, would make the world a Paradise if, and when,
mankind accepted them.

Meanwhile more and more alarming news poured in from Syria. "Let not the
king overlook the killing of a deputy", wrote one subject prince . . . .
.. If help does not come, Bikhura will be unable to hold Kumidi." \* \*
\* In a later communication the same prince "begs for troops"; but he
begged in vain. "If the king does not send troops," he next informed
Akhenaton, "all the king's lands, as far as Egypt, will fall into the
hands of the Khabri." Another faithful ally wrote: "Let troops be sent,
for the king has no longer any territory; the Khabri have wasted all".
To this communication was

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

added a footnote addressed to the royal scribe, which reads: "Bring
aloud before my lord, the king, the words, '*The whole territory of my
lord, the king, is going to ruin*'." <span
id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143)

In the stately temple at Tell-el-Amarna, made beautiful by sculptor and
painter, and strewn daily with bright and perfumed flowers, the dreamer
king, oblivious to approaching disaster, continued to adore Aton with
all the abandon and sustaining faith of a cloistered medieval monk.

"*Thou hast made me wise in thy designs and by thy might*", he prayed to
the god . . . . . "*The world is in thy hand*."

Akhenaton accounted it sinful to shed blood or to take away the life
which Aton gave. No sacrifices were offered up in his temple; the fruits
of the earth alone were laid on the altars. He had already beaten the
sword into a ploughshare. When his allies and his garrison commanders in
Syria appealed for troops, he had little else to send them but a
religious poem or a prayer addressed to Aton.

Hard things are often said about Akhenaton. One writer dismisses him as
an "æsthetic trifler", others regard him as "a half-mad king"; but we
must recognize that he was a profoundly serious man with a great
mission, a high-souled prophet if an impractical Pharaoh. He preached
the gospel of culture and universal brotherhood, and his message to
mankind is the only vital thing which survives to us in Egypt amidst the
relics of the past.

'T is naught  
That ages, empires, and religions there  
Lie buried in the ravage they have wrought;  
For such as he can lend,--they borrow not

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

Glory from those who made the world their prey;  
And he is gathered to the kings of thought  
Who waged contention with their time's decay,  
And of the past are all that cannot pass away.

He remains to us as one of "the inheritors of unfulfilled renown",

Whose names on earth are dark  
But whose transmitted effluence cannot die  
So long as fire outlives the parent spark. . . .

He believed in the "one and only god", Aton, whose power was manifested
in the beneficent sun; the great deity was Father of all mankind, and
provided for their needs and fixed the length of their days. Aton was
revealed in beauty, and his worshippers were required to live beautiful
lives--the cultured mind abhorred all that was evil, and sought after
"the things which are most excellent"; it shrank from the shedding of
blood; it promoted the idea of universal brotherhood, and conceived of a
beautiful world pervaded by universal peace.

No statues of Aton were ever made; Akhenaton forbade idolatrous customs.
Although Aton was a sun god, he was not the material sun; he was the
First Cause manifested by the sun, "from which all things came, and from
which ever issued forth the life-giving and life-sustaining influence
symbolized by rays ending in hands that support and nourish human
beings". "No such grand theology had ever appeared in the world before,
so far as we know," says Professor Flinders Petrie, "and it is the
forerunner of the later monotheist religions, while it is even more
abstract and impersonal, and may well rank as scientific theism." <span
id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144) The same writer says: "If this were a
new religion, invented to satisfy our modern

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

scientific conceptions, we could not find a flaw in the correctness of
its view of the energy of the solar system. How much Akhenaton
understood we cannot say, but he had certainly bounded forward in his
views and symbolism to a position which we cannot logically improve upon
at the present day. No rag of superstition or of falsity can be found
clinging to this new worship evolved out of the old Aton of Heliopolis,
the sole lord or Adon of the Universe". <span
id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145)

The chief source of our knowledge of Akhenaton's religion is his great
hymn, one of the finest surviving versions of which has been found in
the tomb of a royal official at Tell-el-Amarna. It was first published
by Bouriant, and has since been edited by Breasted, whose version is the
recognized standard for all translations. <span
id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146)

The development of Aton religion may have been advanced by Yuaa, Queen
Tiy's father, during the reign of Amenhotep III, when it appears to have
been introduced in Court circles, but it reached its ultimate splendour
as a result of the philosophical teachings of the young genius
Akhenaton. It has its crude beginnings in the mythological beliefs of
those nature worshippers of Egypt and other countries who conceived that
life and the universe were of male origin. We can trace it back even to
the tribal conception that the soul of the world-shaping giant was in
the chaos egg. In the Theban Recension of the *Book of the Dead* Ra is
addressed:

O thou art in thine Egg, who shinest from thy Aton.

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

O thou beautiful being, thou dost renew thyself, and make thyself young
again under the form of Aton. . . .

Hail Aton, thou lord of beams of light; thou shinest and all faces (i.e.
everybody) live. <span id="fr_147"></span>[1](#fn_147)

There was an Aton cult at Heliopolis which taught that the creator Ra
was "Shu in his Aton". Aton is the solar disk and Shu is the air god,
the source of "the air of life". the Great Father who is the soul of the
universe. Like "the Baal", Shu is also associated with the sun; the
atmospheric god is manifested by lightning and fire as well as by
tempest. Shu is thus not only "air which is in the sun", but also,
according to Akhenaton's religion, "heat which is in Aton". In the
Tell-el-Amarna poem, Aton, who creates all things, "makest the son to
live in the body of his mother". Then follows a reference to "the egg":

When the chick is in the egg and is making a sound within the shell,  
Thou givest it air inside it so that it may keep alive.

Budge's trans.

The small bird in the egg, sounding within the shell,  
Thou givest to it breath within the egg  
To give life to that which thou makest.

Griffith's trans.

When the chicklet crieth in the egg-shell,  
Thou givest him *breath* therein, to preserve him alive. <span
id="fr_148"></span>[2](#fn_148)

--Breasted's trans.

When Akhenaton and his queen were depicted worshipping Aton, the rays
which stretched out from the sun and ended in hands not only supported
their bodies

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

but pressed towards their nostrils and lips the "ankh", the "symbol of
life". The air of life was the sun-heated air; life was warmth and
breath. <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149) Why the "ankh" touched the
lips is clearly indicated in the great hymn. When the child is born,
Aton--

Openest his mouth that he may speak.

Aton was thus, like certain other Egyptian gods, "the opener", <span
id="fr_150"></span>[2](#fn_150) who gave power of speech and life to a
child at birth or to the mummy of the dead. In this connection Wiedemann
says that Ptah "bore a name which is probably derived from the root
*pth*, "to open", especially as used in the ritual term "opening of the
mouth". Porphyrius, <span id="fr_151"></span>[3](#fn_151) "who was well
informed in Egyptian matters", tells us that the god (Ptah) came forth
from an egg which had issued from the mouth of Kneph (a word signifying
"air breath", and "spirit Kneph is Khnûmû in his character as an
atmosphere god.

Some authorities identify Aton with the old Syrian god Adon. The root
"ad" or "dad" signifies "father". As "ad" becomes at "in" Attis it may
be that, as a result of habitual phonetic conditions, Adon became Aton.
But Akhenaton's Aton was a greater conception than Adon.

The marked difference between the various Egyptian and Asiatic "Great
Fathers" and the god of Akhenaton consists in this--Aton was not the
chief of a Pantheon: he was the one and only god. "The Aton", says
Professor Petrie, "was the only instance of a 'jealous god' in

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egypt, and this
worship was exclusive of all others, and claims universality." <span
id="fr_152"></span>[1](#fn_152) Had Akhenaton's religion been the same
as that of the Aton cult at Heliopolis we might expect to find him
receiving direct support from that quarter. To the priests of Ra he was
as great a "heretic" as he was to the priests of Amon, or Amon-Ra, at
Thebes.

Akhenaton's conception of the material universe did not differ from that
which generally obtained in. his day in Egypt. There was a Nile in
heaven and a Nile in the underworld. In rainless Upper Egypt he believed
that--

The Nile in heaven is for the strange people. . . .  
Thou (Aton) placest a Nile in heaven that it may rain upon them.

Griffiths.

The Nile of the underworld was "for the land of Egypt".

When thou hast made the Nile beneath the earth  
Thou bringest it according to thy will to make the people live. . . .  
That it may nourish every field.

Griffiths.

Aton also made the firmament in which to rise:

Rising in thy forms as the living Aton,  
Shining afar off and returning . . .  
All eyes see thee before them.

Griffiths.

We do not obtain from the hymn any clear idea of Akhenaton's conception
of evil. There is no reference to the devil serpent, or to the war waged
against the sun god in Heliopolitan myth. But it appears that as light
was associated with life, goodness, and beauty, darkness was similarly
filled with death and evil. At night men lie down to sleep and "their
nostrils are stopped", or

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

"their breath is shut up". Then creatures of evil are abroad; "every
lion cometh from his den and serpents of every kind bite" (Budge). Nor
is there any reference to the after life. "When thou (Aton) settest in
the western horizon the earth is in darkness, and is like a being that
is dead" (Budge) or "like the dead" (Breasted and Griffiths). Akhenaton
appears to have believed in the immortality of the soul-the bodies of
Queen Tiy, his mother, and of his daughter and himself were
embalmed--but it is not certain whether he thought that souls passed to
Paradise, to which there is no reference in the poem, or passed from
egg, or flower, to trees, animals, &c., until they once again entered
human bodies, as in the Anpu-Bata story and others resembling it which
survive in the folktales of various ages and various countries.

Akhenaton's hymn to Aton is believed to have been his own composition.
Its beauty is indicated in the following extracts from Prof. Breasted's
poetic translation:--

When thou risest in the eastern horizon of heaven,  
Thou fillest every land with thy beauty.

When thou settest in the western horizon of heaven,  
The world is in darkness like the dead.

Bright is the earth when thou risest in the horizon,  
When thou shinest as Aton by day.  
The darkness is banished, when thou sendest forth thy rays.

How manifold are all thy works,  
They are hidden from before us,  
O thou sole god, whose powers no other possesseth,  
Thou didst create the earth according to thy desire  
While thou wast alone.

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

The world is in thy hand,  
Even as thou hast made them.  
When thou hast risen, they live.  
When thou settest, they die.  
For thou art duration, beyond thy mere limbs.  
By thee man liveth,  
And their eyes look upon thy beauty  
Until thou settest.

Thou makest the beauty of form. . . .  
Thou art in my heart.

The revolution in art which was inaugurated under Amenhotep III is a
marked feature of Akhenaton's reign. When sculptors and painters
depicted the king he posed naturally, leaning on his staff with crossed
legs, or accompanied by his queen and children. Some of the decorative
work at Tell-el-Amarna will stand comparison with the finest productions
of to-day.

The records which survive to us of the Akhenaton period are very scanty,
for when the priests of the old faith again came to power they were at
pains to obliterate them. Queen Tiy does not appear to have taken a
prominent part in the new movement, which had developed beyond her
expectations; and although she occasionally visited the city of Aton,
her preference for Thebes, the scene of her social triumphs, remained to
the end. Akhenaton's wife was a queen consort, as Tiy had been, and the
royal couple delighted to appear among the people accompanied by their
children.

The fall of the Amon party was complete. For several years the eight
temples of Amon at Thebes lay empty and silent; their endowments had
been confiscated for Aton, to whom new temples were erected in the Fayum
and at Memphis, Heliopolis, Hermonthis, and Hermopolis.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

An endeavour was made to enforce the worship of Aton by royal decree all
over Egypt, with the result that the great mass of the people, who
appear to have shown little concern regarding the fall of the tyrannical
Amon party, were aroused to oppose with feelings of resentment an
uncalled-for interference with the immemorial folk customs and beliefs
which were so closely associated with their habits of life. But still
the power of the "heretic king" remained supreme. The army remained
loyal, although it had shrunk to an insignificant force, and when
Akhenaton placed in command Horemheb it appears to have effectively
controlled the disturbed areas.

Akhenaton died while still a young man, and left no son to succeed him.
Semenkh-ka-ra, who had married a princess, became the next Pharaoh, but
he appears to have been deposed by another son-in-law of the "heretic",
named Tutenk-aton, who returned to Thebes, allied himself with the
priests, and called himself Tutenkamon, "Image of Amon". He was followed
in turn by Ai (Eye), who called himself "Divine Father" and then a
military revolt, instigated by the priests, brought to the throne, after
a brief period of anarchy, Horemheb, who secured his position by
marrying a princess of the royal line. He popularized himself with the
worshippers of the ancient cults by ruthlessly persecuting the adherents
of the religion of Akhenaton, erasing the name of Aton everywhere. He
appears to have re-established the power of Egypt over a part of
Palestine, and he restored order in the kingdom. So the Eighteenth
Dynasty came to an end about two and a half centuries after the
expulsion of the Hyksos.
