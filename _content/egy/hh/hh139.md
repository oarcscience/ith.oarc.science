### LXVI. HOW A MAN WHO HAS BEEN SUCCEEDED IN HIS PROPERTY BY A SON WHOM HE HATED.

<span id="img_12601"></span> ![](img/12601.jpg)

When they would symbolise a *man who has been succeeded* 

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

*in his property by a son whom he hated*, they depict AN APE WITH A
YOUNG APE BEHIND IT, For the ape begets two young apes, one of which he
loves extravagantly, and the other he hates: and the one which he loves
he keeps before him and kills with fondling; but the one which he hates
he keeps behind him and brings up.
