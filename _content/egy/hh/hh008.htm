<p>When they would signify <i>God</i>, or <i>height</i>, or <i>lowness</i>, or <i>excellence</i>, or <i>blood</i>, or <i>victory</i>, (or <i>Ares</i>, or <i>Aphrodite</i>,) [Hor or Hathor]&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_22"></A><A HREF="#fn_21"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, they delineate a HAWK.

And they use it to denote <i>excellence</i>, because it appears to excel all birds&#8212;and for <i>blood</i>, because they say that this animal does not drink water, but blood&#8212;and for <i>victory</i>, because it shews itself capable of overcoming every winged creature; for when pressed by some more powerful bird, it directly turns itself in the air upon its</p>
