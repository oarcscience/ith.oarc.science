<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>HAVING passed through the Tenth Division of the Tuat, the boat of the sun arrives at the gateway SHETAT-BESU, which leads to the Eleventh Division, or, as the opening text reads: "This [great] god cometh forth to this gate, this great god entereth through it, and the gods who are therein acclaim the great god." The gateway is like that through which the god passed into the previous Division; at the entrance to the crate proper stands a bearded, mummied form called METES, and at its exit stands a similar form called SHETAU. The corridor is swept by flames of fire, which proceed from the mouths of two uraei, as before. In the space which is usually guarded by a number</P>
<P><A NAME="page_280"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 280</FONT></A></P>
<P>of gods stand two sceptres, each of which is surmounted by a White Crown; the one on the right is the symbol of OSIRIS, (SAR), and the other of HORUS. Between the sceptres is a line of text, which reads:--"They say to Ra, '[Come] in peace! [Come] in peace! [Come] in peace! [Come] in peace! O thou whose transformations are manifold, thy soul is in heaven, thy body is in the earth. It is thine own command, O great one." The monster serpent which stands on his tail and guards the door is called AM-NETU-F, and the two lines of text which refer to his admission of Ra read:--"He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SAU saith to AM-NETU-F, 'Open thy gate to Ra, unfold thy portal to KHUTI, so that he may illumine the thick darkness, and may send light into the hidden abode.' This gate closeth after the great god hath passed through it, and the gods who are on the battlements wail when they hear it closing upon them."</P>

<P><A NAME="page_284"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 284</FONT></A></P>

<P>Of the gods of the Tuat who tow the boat of Ra it is said&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_27"></A><A HREF="#fn_26"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>:--</P>
<P>"The gods of the Tuat say, Behold the coming forth [of Ra] from Ament, and [his] taking up [his] place in the two divisions of Nu, and [his] performance of [his] transformations on the two hands of Nu. This god doth not enter into the height of heaven,</P>

Now, what openeth the Tuat into Nut (i.e., the sky) are the two hands of AMEN-REN-F (i.e., he whose name is hidden). He existeth in the thick darkness, and light appeareth [there] from the starry night.'"</P>
<P>Of the nine gods with knives and sceptres it is said:--</P>
<P>"Those who are in this scene [with] their weapons in their hand take their knives and hack [with them] at Apep; they make gashes in him and slaughter him, and they drive stakes whereby to fetter him in the regions which are in the upper height. The fetters of the REBEL are in the hands of the Children of Horus, who stand threateningly by this god with their chains between their fingers. This god reckoneth up his members after he whose arms are hidden hath opened [the door] to make a way for Ra."</P>
<P>Of the serpent Apep it is-said:--</P>
<P>"The Children of Horus grasp firmly this serpent which is in this picture, and in this picture they rest in Nut (i.e., the sky). They heap their fetters upon him, and whilst his folds (?) are in the sky his poison drops down from him into Amentet."</P>
<P>Of the four apes holding hands it is said:--</P>
<P>"It is those who are in this picture who make ready for Ra, a way into the eastern horizon of heaven,, and they lead the way for the god who hath created them with their hands, [standing] two on the right hand</P>
<P><A NAME="page_287"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 287</FONT></A></P>
