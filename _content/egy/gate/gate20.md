# CHAPTER VI.

## THE GATE OF TEKA-HRA.

### THE FIFTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

THE boat of the sun having passed through the Fourth Division of the
Tuat arrives at the gateway which leads to the FIFTH DIVISION. This
gateway is similar to that which guards the Fourth Division, and is
guarded by nine gods, who are described as the "Fourth company;" at the
entrance to the corridor and at its exit stands a jackal-headed god, the
former being called AAU, and the latter TEKMI, each is said to "extend
his arms and hands to Ra." The corridor is swept by flames of fire, as
before. The gateway is called ARIT, and the text says, "This great god
cometh to this gateway, and entereth in through it, and the gods who are
therein acclaim him," The nine gods say to

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Ra, "RA-HERU-KHUTI unfoldeth our doors, and
openeth our gateways. Hail, Ra, come thou to us, O great god, lord of
hidden nature." The monster serpent which stands on his tail and guards
the gateway is called TEKA-HRA, and the two lines of text which refer to
his admission of Ra read:--"He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SA
saith to TEKA-HRA:--'Open thy gate to Ra, unfold thy doors to KHUTI,
that he may send light into the thick darkness, and may make his
radiance illumine the hidden habitation.' This door is shut after the
great god hath passed through it, and there is lamentation to those who
are in this gateway when they hear this door close upon them." As the
hieroglyphic text is identical with that given above on [p.
120](gate19.htm#page_120) it is not repeated here.

In the middle of this Division we see the boat of Ra being towed on its
way by four gods of the Tuat; the god is in the same form as before, and
stands in a shrine enveloped by MEHEN. SA stands in the bows, and HEKA
at the stern. In front of those who tow the boat are nine shrouded gods,
with projecting elbows; each of these holds in his hands a part of the
body of a long, slender serpent, and the group is called "those who hold
ENNUTCHI." In front of these are

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

twelve bearded beings, who are advancing towards a god, who is styled
\[the god\] "of his angle;" the twelve gods are described as BAIU
RETH-AMMU-TUAT, i.e., "the souls of the men who are in the Tuat," The
texts read:--

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

"The gods of the Tuat draw along this great god, and he journeyeth
through the hidden place. \[Ra saith:--\] 'Draw ye me along, O ye gods
of the Tuat, and sing praises unto me, O ye who are at the head of the
stars; let your cords be strong (or, vigorous), and draw ye me along by
means of them, and let your hands and arms be steady, let there be speed
in your legs, let there be strong intent in our souls, and let your
hearts be glad. Open ye a prosperous way into the chambers (*qerti*) of
hidden things."'

The Nine Gods who hold Ennutchi.

 

The text relating to the bearers of the serpent reads:--

"Those who are in this scene carry this serpent. Ra striketh them and
advanceth towards them to make himself to rest in \[the gateway called\]
NEBT-AHAU. This serpent travelleth as far as it (i.e., this (gateway),
but he passeth not beyond it. Ra saith unto them:--'Strike ye the
serpent ENNUTCHI there, give him no way \[whereby to escape\], so that I
may pass by you. Hide your arms, destroy that which

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

you guard, protect that which cometh into being from my forms, and tie
ye up (or, fetter) that which cometh into being from my strength.' Their
food consisteth of the hearing of the word of this god, and offerings
are made to them from the hearing of the word of Ra in the Tuat."

"Unto those who have spoken what is right and true upon earth, and who
have magnified the forms of the god, Ra saith:--'Praises shall be
\[sung\] to

 

<span id="img_14500"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

your souls, and there shall be breath to your nostrils, and there shall
be to you joints in SEKHET-ARU. That which shall be indeed yours is what
belongeth to the MAATI GODS. The habitations which shall be yours shall
be (or, are) at the corner where \[live\] those who are with me who
weigh words for them.' Their food is of bread-cakes, and their drink of
tchesert drink, and their libations are of cool water. Offerings are
made unto them upon earth as to the

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

god HETEPI, according to what should be offered unto them."

Ra saith unto this god:--"Let him that is over his Corner
(HERI-QENBET-F) cry out to those souls who are right, and true, and
divine, and make them to sit at peace in their habitations at the Corner
of those who are with myself."

On the right hand of the path of Ra in the Fifth Division of the Tuat
are:--1. Twelve male beings bowing in adoration; they are described as
"those who make adorations in the Tuat." 2. Twelve male beings who bear
in their hands a cord for measuring plots of ground and estates; these
are called "Holders of the cord in the Tuat." Four gods, standing
upright, each holding the symbol of life in his right hand, and a
sceptre in the left.

The Twelve Gods who make adoration in the Tuat.

 

The passage in the text which refers to the adorers reads:--

"\[These are\] they who make songs to Ra in Amentet and exalt
Heru-khuti. \[These are they who\] knew Ra upon earth, and who made
offerings unto him. Their offerings are in their place, and their glory

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

is in the holy place of Ament. They say unto Ra:--'Come thou, O Ra,
progress through the Tuat. Praise be to thee! Enter thou among the holy
\[places\] with the serpent Mehen.' Ra saith unto them:--'There are
offerings for you, O ye who made offerings. I am content with what ye
did for me, both when I used to shine in the eastern part of heaven, and
when I was sinking to rest in the chamber of my Eye.' Their food is of
the bread-cakes

of Ra, and their drink is of his *tcheser* drink, and their libations
are made of cool water, and offerings are made unto them on the earth in
\[return\] for the praisings which they make unto Ra in Ament."

The passage in the text which refers to the holders of the measuring
cord reads:--

"\[These are they who\] hold the measuring cord in Ament, and they go
over therewith the fields of the KHU (i.e., the beatified spirits). \[Ra
saith to

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

them\]:--'Take ye the cord, draw it tight, and mark out the limit (or,
passage) of the fields of Amentet, the KHU whereof are in your abodes,
and the gods whereof are on your thrones.' The KHU of NETERTI are in the
Field of Peace, \[and\] each KHU hath been judged by him that is in the
cord. Righteousness is to those who are (i.e., who exist), and
unrighteousness to those who are not. Ra saith unto them:--'What is
right is the cord in Ament, and Ra is content with the stretching (or,
drawing) of the same. Your possessions are yours, O ye gods, your
homesteads are yours, O ye KHU. Behold ye, Ra maketh (or, worketh) your
fields, and he commandeth on your behalf that there may be sand (?) with
you."

The Four Henbi Gods.

 

"Hail, journey on, O KHUTI, for verily the gods are content with that
which they possess, and the KHU are content with their homesteads. Their
food \[cometh\] from Sekhet-Aru, and their offerings from that which
springeth up therein. Offerings are made unto them upon earth from the
estate of Sekhet-Aru."

To the four bearded gods Ra saith:--"Holy are ye, O HENBI gods, ye
overseers of the cords in Amentet. \[O stablish ye fields and give
\[them\] to the gods and to the KHU (i.e., spirits) \[after\] they have
been

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

measured in Sekhet-Aaru. Let them give fields and sand to the gods and
to the souls who are in the Tuat. Their food shall be from Sekhet-Aaru,
and their offerings from the things which spring forth therein\]."

On the left of the path of the boat of Ra are:--1. A hawk-headed god,
leaning upon a staff; he is called Horus. 2. Four groups, each group
containing four men. The first are RETH, the second are AAMU, the third
axe NEHESU, and the fourth are THEMEHU. The RETH are Egyptians, the AAMU
are dwellers in the deserts to the east and north-east of Egypt, the
NEHESU are the black races and NEGROES, and the THEMEHU are the
fair-skinned Libyans. 3. Twelve bearded beings, each of whom grasps with
both hands the body of a long serpent; these are called the "Holders of
the period of time in Ament." 4. Eight bearded gods, who are called the
"Sovereign chiefs of the Tuat." The hieroglyphic text which relates to
these groups reads:--

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

The passage which refers to the four groups, each containing four men,
reads:--

Horus saith unto the creatures of Ra who dwell in the Black Land (Qemt,
i.e., Egypt) and in the Red Land (i.e., the deserts which lie on each
side of the Black Land formed of the mud of the Nile):--"Magical
protection be unto you, O ye creatures of Ra, who have come into being
from the Great One who is at the head of heaven! Let there be breath to
your nostrils, and let your linen swathings be unloosed! Ye are the
tears <span id="fr_11"></span>[1](#fn_11) of the eye of my splendour in
your name of RETH (i.e., men). Mighty of issue (AA-MU) ye have come into
being in your name of AAMU; Sekhet hath created them, and it is she who
delivereth (or, avengeth) their souls. I masturbated \[to produce you\],
and I was content with the hundreds of thousands \[of beings\] who came
forth from me in your

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

name of NEHESU (i.e., Negroes); Horus made them to come into being, and
it is he who avengeth their souls. I sought out mine Eye, and ye came
into being in your name of THEMEHU; Sekhet hath created them, and she
avengeth their souls."

The passage which refers to the gods who make stable the period of life
(KHERU-AHAU-EM-AMENT) reads:--

Those who make firm (or, permanent) the duration

 

<span id="img_15500"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)  
Click to view](img/15500.jpg)  
The Twelve Gods of Life in Ament.

 

of life stablish the days of the souls \[in\] Amenti and possess the
word (or, command) of the place of destruction. Ra saith unto
them:--"Inasmuch as ye are the gods who dwell in the Tuat, and who have
possession of \[the serpent\] METERUI, by means of whom ye mete out the
duration of life of the souls who are in Amenti who are condemned to
destruction, destroy ye the souls of the enemies according

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

to the place of destruction which ye are commanded to appoint, and let
them not see the hidden place."

The passage in the text which refers to the divine sovereign chiefs
reads:--

"\[Here are\] the divine sovereign chiefs who shall destroy the enemies.
They shall have their offerings

by means of the word \[which becometh\] Maat; they shall have their
oblations upon earth by means of the word \[which becometh\] Maat, and
it is they who destroy and who pass the edict concerning (literally,
write) the duration of the, life of the souls who dwell in Amenti. The
destruction which is yours shall be \[directed\] against the enemies,
and the power to write

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

which ye possess shall be for the place of destruction. I have come,
even I the great one Horus, that I may make a reckoning with my body,
and that I may shoot forth evils against my enemies. Their food is
bread, and their drink is the *tchesert* wine, and they have cool water
wherewith to refresh (or, bathe) themselves. \[Offerings are made to
them upon earth. One doth not enter into the place of
destruction.\] <span id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12)
