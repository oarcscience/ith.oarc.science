# CHAPTER XIII.

## THE GATE OF AM-NETU-F.

### THE ELEVENTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

HAVING passed through the Tenth Division of the Tuat, the boat of the
sun arrives at the gateway SHETAT-BESU, which leads to the Eleventh
Division, or, as the opening text reads: "This \[great\] god cometh
forth to this gate, this great god entereth through it, and the gods who
are therein acclaim the great god." The gateway is like that through
which the god passed into the previous Division; at the entrance to the
crate proper stands a bearded, mummied form called METES, and at its
exit stands a similar form called SHETAU. The corridor is swept by
flames of fire, which proceed from the mouths of two uraei, as before.
In the space which is usually guarded by a number

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

of gods stand two sceptres, each of which is surmounted by a White
Crown; the one on the right is the symbol of OSIRIS, (SAR), and the
other of HORUS. Between the sceptres is a line of text, which
reads:--"They say to Ra, '\[Come\] in peace! \[Come\] in peace! \[Come\]
in peace! \[Come\] in peace! O thou whose transformations are manifold,
thy soul is in heaven, thy body is in the earth. It is thine own
command, O great one." The monster serpent which stands on his tail and
guards the door is called AM-NETU-F, and the two lines of text which
refer to his admission of Ra read:--"He who is over this door openeth to
Ra. SAU saith to AM-NETU-F, 'Open thy gate to Ra, unfold thy portal to
KHUTI, so that he may illumine the thick darkness, and may send light
into the hidden abode.' This gate closeth after the great god hath
passed through it, and the gods who are on the battlements wail when
they hear it closing upon them."

In the middle of this Division we see the boat of the sun being towed on
its way by four gods of the Tuat; the god is in the same form as before,
and his

The Boat of Af-Ra in the Eleventh Division of the Tuat.

 

boat is piloted by SA, who commands, and by HEKA, who steers according
to his directions.

The procession in front of the boat of the sun consists of:--

1\. A company of nine gods, each holding a huge knife in his right hand,
and a sceptre in his left; the first four have jackal heads, and the
last five heads of bearded men. These nine beings represent the

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

\[paragraph continues\] "company of the gods who slay APEP."

2\. The serpent APEP, fettered by five chains which enter the ground;
the fetters are further strengthened by small chains, which are linked
to the larger ones, and are fastened to the ground by means of pegs with
a hook at the top. In an earlier picture we have

seen APEP fettered by Seb, Mest, Hapi, Tuamutef, and Qebhsennuf, who
were represented by five gods, but here the figures of the gods are
wanting, and it is only the legend "Children of Horus," that tells us
the chains represent the gods.

3\. Four Apes, each holding up a huge hand and wrist.

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

4\. The goddess of Upper Egypt, wearing the White Crown, and styled
AMENTI.

5\. The goddess of Lower Egypt, wearing the Red Crown, and called HERIT.

6\. The bearded god SEBEKHTI, who holds the emblem of "life" in his
right hand, and a sceptre in his left.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

Of the gods of the Tuat who tow the boat of Ra it is said <span
id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_26):--

"The gods of the Tuat say, Behold the coming forth \[of Ra\] from Ament,
and \[his\] taking up \[his\] place in the two divisions of Nu, and
\[his\] performance of \[his\] transformations on the two hands of Nu.
This god doth not enter into the height of heaven,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

\[paragraph continues\] \[but\] he openeth \[a way through\] the Tuat
into the height of heaven by his transformations which are in Nu. Now,
what openeth the Tuat into Nut (i.e., the sky) are the two hands of
AMEN-REN-F (i.e., he whose name is hidden). He existeth in the thick
darkness, and light appeareth \[there\] from the starry night.'"

Of the nine gods with knives and sceptres it is said:--

"Those who are in this scene \[with\] their weapons in their hand take
their knives and hack \[with them\] at Apep; they make gashes in him and
slaughter him, and they drive stakes whereby to fetter him in the
regions which are in the upper height. The fetters of the REBEL are in
the hands of the Children of Horus, who stand threateningly by this god
with their chains between their fingers. This god reckoneth up his
members after he whose arms are hidden hath opened \[the door\] to make
a way for Ra."

Of the serpent Apep it is-said:--

"The Children of Horus grasp firmly this serpent which is in this
picture, and in this picture they rest in Nut (i.e., the sky). They heap
their fetters upon him, and whilst his folds (?) are in the sky his
poison drops down from him into Amentet."

Of the four apes holding hands it is said:--

"It is those who are in this picture who make ready for Ra, a way into
the eastern horizon of heaven,, and they lead the way for the god who
hath created them with their hands, \[standing\] two on the right hand

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

and two on the left in the double *atert* of this god; then they come
forth after him, and sing praises to his soul when it looketh upon them,
and they stablish his Disk."

Of the three remaining deities it is said:--

"Those who are in this picture turn away SET from this Gate \[of the god
TUATI. They open its cavern,

and stablish the hidden pylons, and their souls remain in the following
of Ra\]."

who hold light-giving disks."

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

2\. Four gods, each holding a star in his right hand; these are "they

his left hand; their names are BA, KHNEMU, PENTER, and TENT.

5\. Four hawk-headed gods, each holding a sceptre in his left hand;
these are called HORUS, ASHEMTH, SEPT, and AMMI-UAA-F.

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

6\. Eight female figures, each seated on a seat formed by a uraeus with
its body coiled up, and holding a star in her left hand; these are
called "the protecting hours."

7\. A crocodile-headed god called SEBEK-RA, who grasps a fold of a
serpent that stands on its tail in his right hand, and a sceptre in his
left.

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

Of the four gods bearing disks it is said:--

"Those who are in this picture carry the disk of Ra, and it is they who
make a way through the Tuat and the height of heaven by means of this
image which is in their hands. They utter words to the Pylon of Akert so
that Ra may set himself in the body of Nut (i.e., the sky)."

"Those who are in this picture carry stars, and when the two arms of Nu
embrace Ra they and their stars shout hymns of praise, and they journey
on with him to the height of heaven, and they take up their places in
the body of Nut."

Of the four gods bearing sceptres it is said:--

"Those who are in this picture \[having\] their sceptres in their hands,
are they who stablish the

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

domains of this god in the sky, and they have their thrones in
accordance with the command of Ra."

Of the four ram-headed gods it is said:--

"Those who are in this picture \[having\] their sceptres in their hands,
are they who decree \[the making ready\] of the offerings of the gods
\[from\] the bread of heaven, and it is they who make to come forth
celestial water when as yet Ra hath not emerged in Nu."

Of the four hawk-headed gods it is said:--

"Those who are in this picture \[having\] their sceptres in their hands,
are they who stablish the shrine \[in the boat of Ra\], and they lay
their hands (on the body of the double boat of the god after it hath
appeared from out of the gate of Sma, and they place the paddles \[of
the boat\] in Nut, when the Hour which presideth over it (i.e., the
boat) cometh into being, and the Hour \[which hath guided it\] goeth to
rest."

Of the goddesses who are seated on uraei it is said:--

"Those who are in this picture with their serpents under them, and their
hands holding stars, come forth from the two ATERT of this great god,
four to the East and four to the West; it is they who call 'the Spirits
of the East, and they sing hymns to this god, and they praise him after
his appearance, and SETTI cometh forth in his forms. It is they who

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

guide and transport those who are in the boat of this great god."

There is no description of the crocodile-headed god Sebek-Ra in the
text.

of the South in chief."
