The gods NU and AMMUI, and HEH and HEH[UT] are in this Circle at the birth of this great god, when he maketh his appearance from the Tuat, and taketh up his place in the Matet Boat, and riseth from between the thighs of the goddess Nut.</P>

<P>Whosoever shall make [a copy] of these [representations] according to the figures which are depicted on the east [wall] of the palace of Ament of the Tuat, they shall be magical protectors to him that knoweth them upon earth, both in heaven and on earth.</P>
<P>At this point the light beginneth [to come], and it is the end of the thick darkness which Ra travelleth through in Amentet, and of the secret matters which this great god performed therein. He who hath no knowledge of the whole (?) or part (?) of the secret</P>

<P>Whosoever shall make [a copy] of these [representations] according to this copy of what is in the Ament of the Tuat, [which] cannot be looked at or seen, and whosoever shall know these secret images shall be in the condition of the spirit who is equipped [for journeying], and shall come forth [from] and shall descend into the Tuat, and shall hold converse with the men and women who live [there] regularly and unfailingly, millions of times.</P>
