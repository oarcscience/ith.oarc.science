# CHAPTER XI.

## THE GATE OF AB-TA.

### THE NINTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT.

HAVING passed through the Eighth Division of the Tuat, the boat of the
sun arrives at the gateway called AAT-SHEFSHEFT, which leads to the
NINTH DIVISION, or, as the opening text reads: "This great god cometh to
this gate, and entereth through it, and the gods who are therein acclaim
this great god." The gateway is like that through which the god passed
into the previous Division, and its outwork is guarded by nine gods in
the form of mummies, who are described as the PAUT, i.e., the company of
the nine gods. At the entrance to the gate proper stands a bearded,
mummied form, with his hands folded on his breast, called ANHEFTA, and
at its exit stands a similar form

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

called ERMEN-TA, each of these is said to extend his arms and hands to
Ra. The corridor is swept by flames of fire, which proceed from the
mouths of two uraei, as before. The company of the gods who guard the
outwork address Ra, and say, "Come thou to us, O thou who art the head
of the horizon, O thou great god who openest the secret places, open for
thyself the holy pylons, and unfold for thyself the holy doors thereof."
The monster serpent which stands on his tail and guards the door is
called AB-TA, and the two lines of text which refer to his admission of
Ra read, "He who is over this door openeth to Ra. SA saith unto AB-TA,
'Open thy gate to Ra, unfold thy portal to KHUTI, so that he may
illumine the thick darkness, and may send light into the hidden abode.'
This gate closeth after this god hath passed through it, and the souls
who are on the other side of it wail when they hear this door closing
upon them."

In the middle of the Division we see the boat of Ra being towed on its
way by four gods of the Tuat; the god is in the same form as before,

and SA stands on the look-out, and HEKA obeys his instructions as to
steering. The procession which marches in front of the boat consists
of:--

1\. Six bearded male figures, standing upright, who hold in their hands
the ends of a rod, or rope, which is bent in the shape of a bow over
their heads; these are described as "those who are over the words of
magical power."

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

2\. Four dog-headed apes, which hold a rod bent as already described;
these are described as "those who work magic by means of knots for Ra."

Four women, who stand upright, and hold a bent

rod, or rope, over their heads like the four apes and the six male
figures; they are described as "those who work magic by means of knots
for Ra."

4\. Three male figures, each holding a harpoon in

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

his right hand, and a cord in his left; they are called "spearmen."
Immediately in front of these is a bearded male figure, who has been
lying prostrate on his face; he has upon his head a small solar disk and
a pair of ass's ears, and his name is AAI, i.e., the Ass. In his hands
he grasps a rope, which passes over his head and along his back, and is
held by each of the three spearmen in his left hand; from the knees
upwards his body is raised in a diagonal position, and this attitude
suggests that he has either raised himself by means of the rope, or has
been pulled into this position by the spearmen. Facing the Ass are:--1.
The monster serpent APEP, and 2. The crocodile SHESSHES, with a tail
ending in the head of a serpent.

The text, which refers to the whole of this section, reads:--

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

"This great god is towed along by the gods of the Tuat, and those who
tow Ra along say:--'The god

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

cometh to his body, and the god is towed along to his shadow. O be thou
at peace with thy body, and we will tow thee along in thy integrity into
thy (literally, his) secret place. Come thou, O Ra, and be thou at peace
with thy body, for thou shalt be protected by those who are over the
curved ropes(?).'"

The text which refers to the six men, four apes, and four women, with
nets over their heads, reads:--

"Those who are in this picture march before Ra, and they utter words of
power against APEP, and \[then\] return to the Arit (or, Hall) of the
horizon. They journey onwards with him into the height of heaven, and
they come into being for him in the ATERTI (i.e., the two portions of
the sky in which Ra rises and sets), and they cause him to rise in NUT.
And they say their words of power which are these:--'Out upon thee, O
thou Rebel Serpent! Out upon thee, thou monster that destroyest, thou
Apep that sendest forth thy evil emanations (or, deeds)! Thy face shall
be destroyed, O APEP. Thou shalt advance to the block of execution. The
NEMU are against thee, and they shall hack thee in pieces. The AAIU are
against thee, and they shall destroy thee. The ABEBUITI (i.e., the three
spearmen) shall drive \[their harpoons\] into thee, and they shall
enchant thee by means of their Hail! Thou art destroyed, dashed in
pieces, and stabbed to death, O serpent SESSI.'"

"Those who are in this scene, and who have their

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

spears, keep ward over the rope of AI, and they do not permit this Worm
to approach the boat of the great god. They pass behind this god
upwards. These gods who do battle on behalf of this god in heaven
say":--(The speech is wanting).

Gods of the South raising the Standard of the South.

 

In the upper register are the following:--

1\. Four gods, who in the place of heads have each a crown of the South,
to which is affixed a uraeus, upon his body, and who, aided by a bearded
male figure, are engaged in raising up from the ground, by means of a
rope, a pole or staff, which is surmounted by a bearded

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

human head wearing a crown of the South; the gods are called "gods of
the South," and the bearded male figure "he who is over the front end."

2\. Four gods, who in the place of heads have each a

Gods of the North raising the Standard of the North.

 

crown of the North, to which is affixed a uraeus, upon his body, and
who, aided by a bearded male figure, are engaged in raising up from the
ground, by means of a rope, a pole or staff, which is surmounted by a
bearded human head wearing a crown of the North; the gods

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

are called "gods of the North," and the bearded male figure is "he who
is over the hind part."

3\. Between the two groups described above is the hawk-headed sphinx
which typifies "Horus in the Boat." Above its hindquarters spring the
head and shoulders of a bearded human figure called ANA, and on the head
of the hawk and that of And is a crown of the South. Standing on the
back of the sphinx is the figure of HORUS-SET with characteristic heads,
with his arms outstretched, and with each hand laid upon the upper part
of the crowns of the South. The hawk head of this figure faces the back
of the hawk head of the sphinx, and the animal's head, which is
characteristic of Set, faces the back of the human head of And. It is
thus quite clear that

 

<span id="img_24700"></span> [![](tn/generic.jpg)

Heru-am-uaa with Set-Horus on his back.

 

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Horus was regarded as a form of the Sun-god of
the South, and Set as a form of the Sun-god of the North.

4\. The serpent SHEMTI, which has four heads and necks at each end of
its body, and each head and neck are supported on a pair of legs. A male
figure called APU stands and grasps the middle of the body of the
serpent with both hands.

5\. The serpent BATA, with a bearded head at each end of his body; each
head wears a crown of the South. Above the back of this serpent is
another serpent, from each end of the body of which spring the upper
portions of the bodies and heads of four bearded male figures; the first
figure of each group has a pair of hands and arms which are raised in
adoration, and each figure of the two groups has a pair of legs, which
rest on the back of the serpent BATA. A male figure called ABETH stands
and grasps the middle of the body of the serpent TEPI with both hands.

6\. Two male beings, swinging over their heads a net, wherewith they are
going to attack the serpent, or to resist him.

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

The passage which refers to the gods of the South reads:--

"Those who are in this scene rise up for Ra, who

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

saith unto them:--'Receive ye your heads, O ye gods, and draw tightly
the front end of your rope. Hail, O ye gods, come into being! Hail,
possess ye the power of light, O ye gods, and come ye into being, O ye
gods. Possess ye the power of light, O ye gods, by

my coming into being in the secret place, and by my power of light in
the hidden place (Ament), in the chambers of things.'"

The passage which refers to Horus-Set reads:--

"Ra maketh to arise this god. This god with his two faces goeth in after
Ra hath passed by him."

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

The passage which refers to the gods of the North reads:--

"Ra saith unto them:--'Let your heads be to you, O ye gods! Receive ye
your crowns of the North, and pull ye tightly at the hinder end of the
boat of him that cometh into being from me. Behold now Horus of the
handsome Face!'"

The passage which refers to the serpent SHEMTI reads:--

"He who is in this picture strideth through the secret place, and he
withdraweth to QA-TEMT, the Hall (or, Court) of Ament. Those who are in
it are the heads which have been devoured, and they breathe the odour of
SHEMTI, of which Apu is the warder."

The passage which refers to the serpent BATA reads:--

"He who is in this picture maketh his rising up for SAR, and he keepeth
count of the souls which are doomed in the Tuat. He strideth through the
secret place, and he withdraweth to TESERT-BAIU, to the Hall (or, Court)
of Ament; then TEPI entereth into BATA. Those who are in it are they
whose heads have been devoured. They breathe the odour of BATA, of which
ABETH is the guardian."

The passage which refers to the two gods with nets reads:--

"These are the gods who make use of words of power for Horus-Ra in
Ament. \[They have power\]

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

over the net, and they make use of words of power on those who are in
the net\[s\] which are in their hands."

In the lower register are:--

1\. Sixteen gods, who stand at one end of the scene, and grasp a rope
with both hands. The first four are bearded, man-headed beings, and are
said to be "the souls of Ament," the second four are ibis-headed, and
are "the followers of Thoth," the third four are hawk-headed, and are
"the followers of Horus," and the last four are ram-headed, and are the
followers of Ra."

2\. Eight bearded, man-headed beings, who stand at the other end of the
scene in two groups of four, and

who are described as "Powers,"

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

each grasps a rope with both hands. The rope which is held by these
groups of beings is attached to the legs of the enormous serpent KHEPRI.
This serpent has a head at each end of its body, the foremost part of
which is supported on a pair of human legs; from each end of that
portion of its body which lies flat on the ground springs a uraeus. On
the centre fold of the body is seated a hawk, which wears on its head
the double crown, This hawk is the symbol of "Horus of the Tuat."

The text which refers to this section of the scene reads:--

"Those who are in this scene have the rope in their hands, and it is
fastened to the leg\[s\] of KHEPRI, who moveth backwards to the Hall of
their horizon. They draw this rope with the god into their horizon, and
they tow him along in the sky (NUT). They live upon the, things of the
South, and their sustenance is from the things of the North, \[and they
exist\] on that which

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

cometh forth from the mouth of Ra. The voice of this serpent KHEPRI
goeth round about and travelleth into the secret place after Ra hath
entered into the height of heaven."

The four groups, each containing four beings, "say unto Ra:--'Come, O
come, after thy transformations! Come, O Ra, after thy transformations!
Appear,

appear, after thy transformations! Appear, O Ra, after thy
transformations in heaven, in the great heaven! Hail! We decree for thee
thy habitations by the excellence which is in the words of the Mighty
One of Forms in the secret (or, hidden) place.'"

The passage which refers to Horus reads:--

"He who is in this scene is HERU TUATI (i.e., Horus

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

of the Tuat). The head cometh forth from him, and the forms \[in which
he appeareth\] from the coiled \[serpent\]. Ra crieth unto this god to
whom the two divine URAEI unite themselves; he entereth in upon the way
into KHEPRI, Who listeneth when Ra crieth to him."

The two groups, each containing four beings, "have

in their hands the rope which is fastened to the foot of KHEPRI, and
they say to Ra:--'The ways of the hidden place are open to thee, and
\[the portals\] which are in the earth are unfolded for thee, the SOUL
which Nut loveth, and we will guide thy wings to the mountain. Hail!
Enter thou into the East, and make thou thy passage from between the
thighs of thy mother.'"
