# THE FOURTH HOUR.

The majesty of this great god, having been towed along, afterwards
taketh up his position in the secret Circle of AMENTET, and he
performeth the affairs of the gods of the Tuat who are therein by means
of his voice, but he seeth them not.

ANKH-KHEPERU is the name of the gate of this Circle.

AMENT-SETHAU is the name of this Circle.

Whosoever knoweth this representation of the hidden roads of RE-STATET,
and the holy paths of the AMMEHET, and the secret doors which are in the
Land Of SEKER, the god who is upon his sand, shall be in the condition
of him that eateth the bread-cakes which are \[made\] for the mouth of
the LIVING gods in the Temple of Tem.

Whosoever knoweth this shall be in the condition of him that is *maat*
on the ways, and he shall journey

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

over the roads of RE-SETHAU, and he shall see the representations of the
AMMEHET.

URT-EM-SEKHEMU-SET is the name of the hour of the night which guideth
this great god.
