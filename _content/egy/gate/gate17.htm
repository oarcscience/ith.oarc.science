<H2 ALIGN="CENTER">THE GATE OF SAA-SET</H2>
<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">THE SECOND DIVISION OF THE TUAT.</H3>
<FONT FACE="Times Roman,Times New Roman"><P>THE boat of Ra, having passed between the two halves of the horizon of the West, now approaches a gateway, the door of which is closed before him; the door of the second division of the Tuat is different from the doors of the other divisions, for it consists of a single leaf which turns upon a pivot working in holes in the top and bottom of the framework of the door. This door is guarded by a serpent called SAA-SET, which stands upon its tail. The text referring to this serpent reads:--</P>
<P><A NAME="page_87"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 87</FONT></A></P>
<P>"He who is over (i.e., has the mastery over) this door openeth to Ra. <A NAME="img_08700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/08700.jpg" ALIGN="RIGHT"> SA saith unto SAT-SET, 'Open thy door to Ra, throw wide open thy door to KHUTI. The hidden abode is in darkness, so that the transformations of this god may take place.' This portal is closed after this god hath entered in through it, and there is lamentation on the part of those who are in their mountain when they hear this door shut."</P>
<P>In the centre of the scene we see the boat of Ra being towed along by four gods standing, each of whom grasps the tow-line with both hands. The god is now in the form of a ram-headed man, who holds the sceptre in his right hand, and has the solar disk above his horns. He stands within a shrine which is enveloped in the voluminous folds of the serpent Mehen, a serpent also stands on his tall before him. In front of the shrine stands SA, and behind it HEKAU. The gods who tow the boat are called TUAIU.</P>
<P><A NAME="page_88"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 88</FONT></A></P>
<P>The sun's boat is met in this section by a company of thirteen gods, who are under the direction of a god who holds a staff in his hand. The names of the first seven gods are:--NEPEMEH&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_9"></A><A HREF="#fn_9"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>, NENHA, &nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>, BA, HERU, BEHA-AB, KHNEMU, and SETCHET; the third has the head of a ram, and the fourth that of a hawk.

This god is drawn by the gods of the Tuat (in order to make divisions (or, distinctions) in the earth, and to work out [his] designs therein, to weigh words and deeds in Ament, to magnify the great god above the little god among the gods. who are in the Tuat, to place the KHU (i.e., the blessed dead) upon, their thrones, and the damned [in the place] to which they have been condemned in the judgment, and to destroy their bodies by an evil death. Ra saith:--'O grant ye to me that I may restore the tiara, and that I may have possession of [my] shrine which is in the earth. Let SA and HEKA unite themselves to me for the working out of plans for you, and for making to come into being their attributes (or, forms) ye [have] (what is yours. Isis hath made to be at peace the wind, and offerings are there. None shutteth [the door] against you, and the damned do not enter in after you. That which belongeth to you is to you, O gods.' These gods say unto Ra, 'There is darkness on the road of the Tuat, therefore let the doors which are closed be unfolded, let the earth open, so that the gods may draw along him that hath created them.' Their food [i.e., the food of these gods] is of the funeral offerings, and their drink is from their cool waters, and their hands are on meat offerings among the Akert regions of Ament."</P>
<P>On the right of the boat are twenty-four gods, the first twelve of whom are described as "those</P>
<P><A NAME="page_92"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 92</FONT></A></P>
<P>who are at peace, the worshippers of Ra," and the second twelve as "the righteous who are in the Tuat." These beings are thus described by the accompanying text:--</P>

<P>"These [are they who] have worshipped (or, praised) Ra upon earth, who uttered words of power against Apep, who made their offerings unto him, and who burnt (<I>literally</I>, made) incense to their gods on their own behalf, after their offerings.

<P>The above passage refers to the "righteous who are in the Tuat."</P>
<P>On the left side of the boat of Ra are: 1. The god TEM, who is depicted in the form of an aged man, leaning heavily on a stick which he grasps in his right hand. 2. Four male beings who are lying prostrate on their backs. 3. Twenty male beings, with their backs bowed, and their arms tied together at their elbows behind their backs. The our beings are described as "the inert," and the twenty as "the apostates of the Hall of Ra, who have blasphemed Ra upon earth, who have invoked evils upon him that is in the Egg, who have thrust aside the right, and have spoken words against KHUTI."</P>
