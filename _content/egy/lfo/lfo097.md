### THE NINETY-EIGHTH CEREMONY.

Two vessels of Amt (?) wine, or wine of Pelusium, with the formula:--

"Osiris Unas, the child which is in the Eye of Horus hath been presented
unto thee, and thy mouth hath been opened thereby."

The Sem priest presenting two vessels of Amt wine.

 

By the words "child which is in the Eye," we are to understand "pupil of
the eye," or "apple of the eye," i.e., that which is guarded as the most
precious thing. The same idea exists in Hebrew, compare אִשׁו{! 0x5e ^
!}^ן, the "little man" of the eye (Deut. xxxii. 10; Proverbs vii. 2),
and in Arabic <span id="img_13601"></span> ![](img/13601.jpg). We have
also "daughter of the eye," בַּת-עַיַן in Psalm xvii. 8, in Arabic <span
id="img_13602"></span> ![](img/13602.jpg), and in Ethiopic <span
id="img_13603"></span> ![](img/13603.jpg) = Greek κόρη (Deut. xxxii, 10
Psalm xvi. 9; Proverbs vii. 2).
