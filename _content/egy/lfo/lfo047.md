The Sem priest presenting a bread cake and a vessel of beer.

 

"Osiris Unas, the Eye of Horus hath been presented unto thee, and it
hath been lifted up for thee to thy face. There shall be lifting up to
thy face, there shall be lifting up to thy face, O Osiris. Hail, Unas!

intently upon that which cometh forth from thee. That which was
corruptible in thee

hath been washed away, O Unas, and thy mouth hath been made holy for
thee by the Eye of Horus."
