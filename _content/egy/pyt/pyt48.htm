<p>1719d. as the jackal (god), nome-governor (of the Bows), the Two Enneads,</p>

<p>1719e. as Horus who presides over his, abode (or thigh-offering).</p>

<p>1719f. He appoints thee as the morning star (lit. god of the morning) in the

<p>1720d. in this, thy dignity issuing from the mouth of R&#275;&#145;.</p>

<p>1721a. Thou sittest upon this thy firm throne, like the Great One who is in Heliopolis;</p>

<p>1723c. The <i>&#146;im&#541;</i>-trees serve thee,

thee.</p>
