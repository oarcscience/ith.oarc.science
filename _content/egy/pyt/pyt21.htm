offered to thee by Horus,</p>

<p>765b. in thy name of "He who is come from the cataract"; take to
thyself thy natron that thou mayest be divine.</p>

<p>768a. To say: O N., this thy going, these thy goings;</p>

<p>768b. is that going of Horus, by this his going, by these his goings,</p>

<p>769a. as his runners hastened, so his envoys rushed on behind,</p>

<p>769b. so that they might announce him to him who lifts up the arm in the
East.</p>

<p>769c. Rejoice, N.,</p>

Ennead, who are in Heliopolis.</p>

<p>771a. O N., <i>M&#7723;nti-n-&#146;irti</i>
protects thee,</p>

<p>771b. thy herdsman, who is behind thy calves.</p>

<p>771c. O N., <i>&#145;r</i>--- protects thee
against the spirits.</p>

<p>772a. O N., know</p>

<p>772b. that thou shalt take for thyself this thy divine offering, that thou
mayest be satisfied with it every day:</p>

<p>773a. thousands of loaves of bread, thousands of mugs of beer, thousands of
heads of oxen, thousands of geese,</p>

<p>773b. thousands of all sweet things, thousands of all textures.</p>

<p>7 74a. O N., thy water belongs to thee, thy abundance belongs to thee,</p>

<p>774b. thy natron belongs to thee, (all) which is brought to thee by thy
brother, <i>N&#7723;&#7723;</i>.</p>
