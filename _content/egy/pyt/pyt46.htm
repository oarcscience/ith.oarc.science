HEAVEN, UTTERANCE 606.</h3>

<p align="center"><i>Utterance
606</i>.</p>

<p>1683a. To say: Arise for me, father; stand up for me, Osiris N.</p>

<p>1683b. It is I; I am thy son; I am Horus.</p>

<p>1684a. I have come to thee, that I may purify thee, that I may cleanse thee,</p>

<p>1684b. that I may revivify thee, that I may assemble for thee thy bones,</p>

<p>1684c. that I may collect for thee thy flesh, that I may assemble for thee
thy dismembered limbs,</p>

<p>1685a. for I am as Horus his avenger, I have smitten for thee him who smote
thee;</p>

<p>1685b. I have avenged thee, father Osiris N., on him who did thee evil.</p>

<p>1686a. I have come to thee by order of <i>&#7716;rw</i>;</p>

<p><A NAME="page_258"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 258</FONT></A></p>

<p>1686b. (for) he has appointed thee, father Osiris N., (to be) upon the
throne of R&#275;&#145;-Atum,</p>

<p>1686c. that thou mayest lead the blessed dead(?).</p>

<p>1687a. Thou shalt embark into the boat of R&#275;&#145;, in which the gods love to ascend,</p>

<p>1687b. in which the gods love to descend, in which R&#275;&#145; is rowed to the
horizon;</p>

<p>1687c. N. shall embark into it, like R&#275;&#145;.</p>

<p>1688a. Thou shalt seat thyself upon this throne of R&#275;&#145;, that thou mayest
command the gods,</p>

<p>1688b. for thou art indeed R&#275;&#145;, who comes forth from Nut, who gives birth
to R&#275;&#145; every day.</p>

<p>1688c. N. is born every day like R&#275;&#145;.</p>

<p>1689a. Take to thyself the heritage of thy father Geb before the corporation
of the Ennead in Heliopolis.</p>

<p>1689b. "Who is equal to him?",</p>

<p>1689c. say the Two great and mighty Enneads who are at the head of the Souls
of Heliopolis.</p>

<p>1690a. These two great and mighty gods have appointed thee</p>

<p>1690b. --those who are chiefs of the Marsh of Reeds--upon the throne of <i>&#7716;rw</i>,</p>

<p>1690c. as their eldest son;</p>

<p>1691a. they placed Shu at thy left (east side), Tefnut at thy right (west
side),</p>

<p>1691b. Nun before thee (at thy south side), <i>Nnt</i> behind thee (at thy north side);</p>

<p>1692a. they lead thee to these their places, beautiful and pure,</p>

<p>1692b. which they made for R&#275;&#145; when they placed him upon their thrones (his
throne).</p>

<p>1693a. N., they make thee live,</p>

<p>1693b. so that thou mayest surpass the years of Horus of the horizon,</p>

<p>1693c. when they make thy (for "his") name, "Withdraw not
thyself from the gods."</p>

<p>1694a. They recite for thee this chapter, which they recited for R&#275;&#145;-Atum
who shines every day;</p>

<p>1694b. they have appointed N. to their thrones (his throne)</p>

<p>1694c. at the head of every Ennead, as R&#275;&#145; and as his deputy.</p>

<p>1695a. They cause N. to come into being as R&#275;&#145;, in this, his name of
"Khepri."</p>

<p><A NAME="page_259"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 259</FONT></A></p>

<p>1695b. Thou mountest to them as R&#275;&#145;, in this his name of "R&#275;&#145;";</p>

<p>1695c. thou turnest back again from their face as R&#275;&#145;, in this his name of
"Atum."</p>

<p>1696a. The Two Enneads shall rejoice, O father;</p>

<p>1696b. when thou approachest, O father, Osiris N., they say:</p>

<p>1696c. "Our; brother is come to us."</p>

<p>1696d. The Two Enneads say to Osiris N.: "King, Osiris N.,</p>

<p>1697a. one of us is come to us."</p>

<p>1697b. The Two Enneads say to thee: "King, Osiris N.,</p>

<p>1698a. the eldest son of his father is come to us."</p>

<p>1698b. The Two Enneads say to thee: "King, Osiris N.,</p>

<p>1698c. he is the eldest son of his mother."</p>

<p>1698d. The Two Enneads say to thee: "King, Osiris N.,</p>

<p>1699a. he to whom evil was done by his brother Set comes to us."</p>

<p>1699b. The Two Enneads say:</p>

<p>1699c. "And we shall not permit that Set be delivered from carrying
thee for ever, king, Osiris N."</p>

<p>1699d. The Two Enneads say to thee: "King, Osiris N.,</p>

<p>1700. raise thyself up, king, Osiris N.; thou livest."</p>
