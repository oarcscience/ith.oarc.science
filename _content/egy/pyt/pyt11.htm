<h3 align="center">8. THE DECEASED KING TRIUMPHS OVER HIS ENEMIES AND IS RECOGNIZED BY THE
GODS, UTTERANCES 260-262.</h3>

<p align="center"><i>Utterance
260</i>.</p>

<p>316a. To say: O Geb, bull of Nut, N. is a Horus, heir of his father.</p>

<p>316b. N. is the goer, the comer, the fourth of these four gods,</p>

<p>316c. who have brought water (and) made themselves clean, who rejoice over
the "power" of their fathers.</p>

<p>316d. He desires that he be justified by that which he has done.</p>

<p>317a. Since <i>Tfn</i> and Tefnut have
judged N.; since the Two Truths have heard (him);</p>

<p>317b. since Shu has been advocate (tongue); since the Two Truths have given
verdict;</p>

<p>317c. he has encompassed the thrones of Geb, he has raised himself to that
which he wished.</p>

<p>318a. (So now that) his limbs are united, which were hidden (in the grave),</p>

<p>318b. he unites himself with those who are in Nun. He puts an end to his
words in Heliopolis,</p>

<p><A NAME="page_84"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 84</FONT></A></p>

<p>318c. as N. goes forth on that day in the true form of an <i>&#541;&#7723;</i>.</p>

<p>319a. N. destroys battle; he punishes revolt.</p>

<p>319b. N. goes forth (as) the protector of truth; he brings her, for she is
with him.</p>

<p>319c. Those who were furious, (now) busy themselves for him; those who are
in Nun, (now) give life over to him.</p>

<p>320a. The refuge of N. is in his eye; the protection of N. is in his eye;</p>

<p>320b. the power of N. is in his eye; the strength of N. is in his eye.</p>

<p>321a. O gods of South, North, West, East, respect N., fear him;</p>

<p>321b. he has sat in the <i>&#7717;t&#541;</i> of
the two courts.</p>

<p>321c. That uraeus-serpent <i><u>d</u>nn-wt.t</i>
might have burned you, for she attained your heart,</p>

<p>322a. you (they) who might have come to N. as an adversary; come to him (as
a friend), come to him.</p>

<p>322b. N. is the <i><u>d</u>&#347;<u>d</u>&#347;</i> of his
father, the <i>n&#7723;b</i> of his mother.</p>

<p>323a. The abomination of N. is to walk in darkness,</p>

<p>323b. lest he see those who are upside down.</p>

<p>323c. N. will come forth in this day; he will bring truth with him.</p>

<p>323d. N. will not be delivered up to your flame, O gods.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Utterance
261</i>.</p>

<p>324a. To say: N. is a heart-beat, son of the heart of Shu,</p>

<p>324b. wide-outstretched, a blinding light.</p>

<p>324c. It is N. who is a flame (moving) before the wind to the ends of heaven
and to the end of the earth,</p>

<p>324d. as soon as the arms of the lightning are emptied of N.</p>

<p>325a. He travels through Shu and strides through <i>&#541;kr</i>;</p>

<p>325b. he kisses the red crown, the divinely created.</p>

<p>326a. Those who are in the arbour (heaven?) open for him their arms.</p>

<p>326b. N. stands on the eastern side of heaven;</p>

<p>326c. (where) there is brought to him that which ascends to heaven.</p>

<p>326d. N. makes a separation of the tempest.</p>

<p align="center"><i>Utterance
262</i>.</p>

<p>327a. To say: Disown not N., O god; for thou knowest him and he knows thee.</p>

<p>327b. Disown not N., O god; for he knows thee.</p>

<p><A NAME="page_85"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 85</FONT></A></p>

<p>327c. To (thee) it is said: "The transitory."</p>

<p>328a. Disown not N., O R&#275;&#145;; for thou knowest him and he knows thee.</p>

<p>328b. Disown not N., O R&#275;&#145;; for he knows thee.</p>

<p>328c. To thee it is said: "The Great (One) is altogether
destroyed."</p>

<p>329a. Disown not N., O Thot; for thou knowest him and he knows thee.</p>

<p>329b. Disown not N., O Thot; for he knows thee.</p>

<p>329c. To thee it is said: "He rests, the solitary."</p>

<p>330a. Disown not N., O Horus, the pre-eminent (pointed); for thou knowest
him and he knows thee.</p>

<p>330b. Disown not N., O Horus, the pre-eminent (pointed); for he knows thee.</p>

<p>330c. To thee it is said: "The unfortunate."</p>

<p>331a. Disown not N., O thou who art in the <i>D&#541;.t</i>; for thou knowest him and he knows thee.</p>

<p>336. Disown not N., O thou who art in the <i>D&#541;.t</i>; for he knows thee.</p>

<p>331c. To thee it is said: "The damaged."</p>

<p>332a. Disown not N., O bull of heaven; for thou knowest him and he knows
thee.</p>

<p>332b. Disown not N., O bull of heaven; for he knows thee.</p>

<p>332c. To thee it is said: "This <i>n&#7723;&#7723;</i>-star."</p>

<p>333a. Behold, N. comes; behold, N. comes; behold, N. is ascended.</p>

<p>333b. N. is not come of himself.</p>

<p>333c. It is a messenger who is come to him; it is a divine word which will
cause him to arise.</p>

<p>334a. N. has passed by his broad-house; the fury of the great sea has
avoided him.</p>

<p>334b. His fare is not accepted in the great ship;</p>

<p>334c. the palace of the Great cannot ward him off from the way of the <i>&#347;&#7717;d.w</i>-stars.</p>

<p>335a. Behold, therefore, N. has attained the heights of heaven.</p>

<p>335b. He has seen his uraeus-serpent in the boat of the evening sun; it is
N. who has journeyed in it.</p>

<p>335c. He has recognized (his) uraeus-serpent in the boat of the morning sun,
it is N. who has bailed it out.</p>

<p>336a. The blessed dead (?) have witnessed to him;</p>

<p>336b. the hail-storm of heaven has taken him away, it (lit. they cause)
causes N. to approach to R&#275;&#145;.</p>
