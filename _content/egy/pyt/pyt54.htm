<p>1975a. They say to thee, Osiris N., "thou art gone, thou art come;</p>

<p>1975b. thou art asleep, [thou art awake]; thou art [dead (lit. thou

<p>1976a. Stand up, see that which thy son has done for thee;</p>

<p>1976b. awake, hear [that which] Horus [has done for] thee.</p>

<p>1977a. He has beaten for thee him who beats thee, li[ke an ox];</p>

<p>1977b. he has killed for thee him who kills thee, like a wild-bull;</p>

<p>1977c. he has bound for thee him who binds thee;</p>

<p>1977d. he has put him under thy great daughter who is in <i>&#7730;dm</i>,</p>

<p>1978b. Osiris speaks to Horus:</p>

<p>1978c. After he had exterminated the evil [which was in N. on] his fourth

<p>1979c. when he has given to thee the gods, thine enemies, and Thot has
brought them to thee.</p>

<p>1980a. How beautiful indeed is the sight, how agreeable is the view, the
sight of Horus,</p>

<p>1980c. before the gods of the west!</p>

<p>1981a. Thy libation is poured by Isis,
[Nephthys has purified thee]--</p>

<p>1981b. [thy two sisters] great and powerful, who collected thy flesh,</p>

face--</p>

<p>1982b. Atum has given to thee, and the Two Enneads have made for thee.</p>

<p>1983c. who made for thee [their] names [into <i>tt.wi</i>],</p>

<p>1983d. [who washed thy face], [who dried] thy tears,</p>

<p>1983e. who opened thy mouth with their copper (or, iron) fingers.</p>

<p>1984a. Thou mountest, thou mountest towards the broad-hall of Atum;</p>

<p>1984b. thou marchest towards the Marsh of Reeds;</p>

<p>1984c. thou voyagest over the places of the great god.</p>

<p>1985a. To thee heaven is given, to thee the earth is given, to thee the
