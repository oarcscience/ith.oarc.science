### LECTURE VIII

#### POPULARIZATION OF THE OLD ROYAL HEREAFTER—TRIUMPH OF OSIRIS—CONSCIENCE AND THE BOOK OF THE DEAD—MAGIC AND MORALS

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> scepticism toward preparations for
the hereafter involving a massive tomb and elaborate mortuary furniture,
the pessimistic recognition of the futility of material equipment for
the dead, pronounced as we have seen these tendencies to be in the
Feudal Age, were, nevertheless, but an eddy in the broad current of
Egyptian life. These tendencies were undoubtedly the accompaniment of
unrelieved pessimism and hopelessness, on the one hand, as well as of a
growing belief in the necessity of moral worthiness in the hereafter, on
the other; they were revolutionary views which did not carry with them
any large body of the Egyptian people. As the felicity of the departed
was democratized, the common people took up and continued the old
mortuary usages, and the development and elaboration of such customs
went on without heeding the eloquent silence and desolation that reigned
on the pyramid plateau and in the cemeteries of the fathers. Even Ipuwer
had said to the king: "It is, moreover, good when the hands of men build
pyramids, lakes are dug, and groves of sycomores of the gods are
planted." <span id="fr_702"></span>[1](#fn_702) In the opinion of the
prosperous official class the loss of the tomb was the direst possible
consequence of unfaithfulness to the king, and a wise man said to his
children:

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"There is no tomb for one hostile to his majesty;  
 But his body shall be thrown to the waters." <span
id="fr_703"></span>[1](#fn_703)</span>

</div>

By the many, tomb-building was resumed and carried on as of old. To be
sure, the kings no longer held such absolute control of the state that
they could make it but a highly organized agency for the construction of
the gigantic royal tomb; but the official class in charge of such work
did not hesitate to compare it with Gizeh itself. Meri, an architect of
Sesostris I, displays noticeable satisfaction in recording that he was
commissioned by the king "to execute for him an eternal seat, greater in
name than Rosta (Gizeh) and more excellent in appointments than any
place, the excellent district of the gods. Its columns pierced heaven;
the lake which was dug reached the river, the gates, towering
heavenward, were of limestone of Troja. Osiris, First of the Westerners,
rejoiced over all the monuments of my lord (the king). I myself rejoiced
and my heart was glad at that which I had executed." <span
id="fr_704"></span>[2](#fn_704) The "eternal seat" is the king's tomb,
including, as the description shows, also the chapel or mortuary temple
in front.

While the tombs of the feudal nobles not grouped about the royal
pyramid, as had been those of the administrative nobles of the Pyramid
Age, were now scattered in the baronies throughout the land, they
continued to enjoy to some extent the mortuary *largesses* of the royal
treasury. The familiar formula, "an offering which the king gives,"

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

so common in the tombs about the pyramids, is still frequent in the
tombs of the nobles. It is, however, no longer confined to such tombs.
With the wide popularization of the highly developed mortuary faith of
the upper classes it had become conventional custom for every man to
pray for a share in royal mortuary bounty, and all classes of society,
down to the humblest craftsman buried in the Abydos cemetery, pray for
"an offering which the king gives," although it was out of the question
that the masses of the population should enjoy any such privilege.

It is not until this Feudal Age that we gain any full impression of the
picturesque customs connected with the dead, the observance of which was
now so deeply rooted in the life of the people. The tombs still
surviving in the baronies of Upper Egypt have preserved some memorials
of the daily and customary, as well as of the ceremonial and festival,
usages with which the people thought to brighten and render more
attractive the life of those who had passed on. We find the same
precautions taken by the nobles which we observed in the Pyramid Age.

The rich noble Hepzefi of Siut, who flourished in the twentieth century
before Christ, had before death erected a statue of himself in both the
leading temples of his city, that is, *one* in the temple of Upwawet, an
ancient Wolf-god of the place, from which it later received its name,
Lycopolis, at the hands of the Greeks, and the *other* in the temple of
Anubis, a well-known Dog- or Jackal-god, once one of the mortuary rivals
of Osiris. The temple of Upwawet was in the midst of the town, while
that of Anubis was farther out on the outskirts of the necropolis, at
the foot of the cliff, some distance up the face of which Hepzefi had
excavated his imposing cliff tomb. In this

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

tomb likewise he had placed a third statue of himself, under charge of
his mortuary priest. He had but one priest for the care of his tomb and
the ceremonies which he wished to have celebrated on his behalf; but he
had secured assistance for this man by calling in the occasional
services of the priesthoods of both temples, and certain of the
necropolis officials, with all of whom he had made contracts, as well as
with his mortuary priest, stipulating exactly what they were to do, and
what they were to receive from the noble's revenues in payment for their
services or their oblations, regularly and periodically, after the
noble's death.

These contracts, ten in number, were placed by the noble in bold
inscriptions on the inner wall of his tomb-chapel, and they furnish
to-day a very suggestive picture of the calendar of feasts celebrated in
this provincial city of which Hepzefi was lord—feasts in all of which
living and dead alike participated. The bald data from these contracts
will be found in a table below (pp. [268](#page_268)–9), and on the
basis of these the following imaginative reconstruction endeavors to
correlate them with the life which they suggest. The most important
celebrations were those which took place in connection with the new
year, before its advent, as well as at and after its arrival. They began
five days before the end of the old year, on the first of the five
intercalary days with which the year ended. On this day we might have
seen the priests of Upwawet in procession winding through the streets
and bazaars of Siut, and issuing at last back of the town as they
conducted their god to the temple of Anubis at the foot of the cemetery
cliff. Here a bull was slaughtered for the visiting deity. Each of the
priests carried in his hand a large conical white loaf of bread, and as
they

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

entered the court of the Anubis temple, each deposited his loaf at the
base of Hepzefi's statue. <span id="fr_705"></span>[1](#fn_705)

Five days later, as the day declined, the overseer of the necropolis,
followed by the nine men of his staff, climbed down from the cliffs,
past many an open tomb-door which it was the duty of these men to guard,
and entered the shades of the town below, now quite dark as it lay in
the shadow of the lofty cliffs that overhung it. It is New Year's Eve,
and in the twilight here and there the lights of the festival
illumination begin to appear in doors and windows. As the men push on
through the narrow streets in the outskirts of the town, they are
suddenly confronted by the high enclosure wall of the temple of Anubis.
Entering at the tall gate they inquire for the "great priest," who
presently delivers to them a bale of torches. With these they return,
slowly rising above the town as they climb the cliff again. As they look
out over the dark roofs shrouded in deep shadows, they discover two
isolated clusters of lights, one just below them, the other far out in
the town, like two twinkling islands of radiance in a sea of blackness
which stretches away at their feet. They are the courts of the two
temples, where the illumination is now in full progress. Hepzefi, their
ancient lord, sleeping high above them in his cliff tomb, is,
nevertheless, present yonder in the midst of the joy and festivity which
fill the temple courts. Through the eyes of his statue rising above the
multitude which now throngs those courts, he rejoices in the beauty of
the bright colonnades, he revels, like his friends below, in the sense
of prodigal plenty spread out before him, as he beholds the offering
loaves arrayed at his feet, where we saw the priests depositing them;
and his ears are filled with the

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

roar of a thousand voices as the rejoicings of the assembled city,
gathered in their temples to watch the old year die and to hail the new
year, swell like the sound of the sea far over the dark roofs, till its
dying tide reaches the ears of our group of cemetery guards high up in
the darkness of the cliffs as they stand silently looking out over the
town.

Just above is the great façade of the tomb where their departed lord,
Hepzefi, lies. The older men of the party remember him well, and recall
the generosity which they often enjoyed at his hands; but their juniors,
to whom he is but an empty name, respond but slowly and reluctantly to
the admonitions of the gray-beards to hasten with the illumination of
the tomb, as they hear the voice of Hepzefi's priest calling upon them
from above to delay no longer. The sparks flash from the "friction
lighter" for an instant and then the first torch blazes up, from which
the others are quickly kindled. The procession passes out around a vast
promontory of the cliff and then turns in again to the tall tomb door,
where Hepzefi's priest stands awaiting them, and without more delay they
enter the great chapel. The flickering light of the torches falls
fitfully upon the wall, where gigantic figures of the dead lord rise so
high from the floor that his head is lost in the gloom far above the
waning light of the torches. He seems to admonish them to punctilious
fulfilment of their duties toward him, as prescribed in the ten
contracts recorded on the same wall. He is clad in splendid raiment, and
he leans at ease upon his staff. Many a time the older men of the group
have seen him standing so, delivering judgment as the culprits were
dragged through the door of his busy bureau between a double line of
obsequious bailiffs; or again watching the progress

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

of an important irrigation canal which was to open some new field to
cultivation. Involuntarily they drop in obeisance before his imposing
figure, like the scribes and artisans, craftsmen and peasants who fill
the walls before him, in gayly colored reliefs vividly portraying all
the industries and pastimes of Hepzefi's great estates and forming a
miniature world, where the departed noble, entering his chapel, beholds
himself again moving among the scenes and pleasures of the provincial
life in which he was so great a figure. To him the walls seem suddenly
to have expanded to include harvest-field and busy bazaar, workshop and
ship-yard, the hunting-marshes and the banquet-hall, with all of which
the sculptor and the painter have peopled these walls till they are
indeed alive.

The torches are now planted around the offerings, thickly covering a
large stone offering-table, behind which sits Hepzefi's statue in a
niche in the wall; and then the little group slowly withdraws, casting
many a furtive glance at a false door in the rear wall of the chapel,
through which they know Hepzefi may at any moment issue from the shadow
world behind it, to re-enter this world and to celebrate with his
surviving friends the festivities of New Year's Eve. <span
id="fr_706"></span>[1](#fn_706)

The next day, the first day of the new year, is the greatest feast-day
in the calendar. There is joyful exchange of gifts, and the people of
the estate appear with presents for the lord of the manor. Hepzefi's
descendants are much absorbed in their own pleasure, but his cautious
contracts, as still recorded in the town archives, ensure him from
neglect. While the peasants and the leaseholders of the barony are
crowding the gates of the manor-house,

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

bringing in their gifts to their living lord and thinking little, if at
all, of his departed predecessor, we discover the little knot of ten
necropolis guards, headed by their chief, again entering the outskirts
of the town and proceeding to one of the treasuries of the estate where
they are entitled to draw supplies. Presently they march away again,
bearing five hundred and fifty flat cakes, fifty-five white loaves, and
eleven jars of beer. Pushing their way slowly through the holiday crowds
they retrace their steps to the entrance of the cemetery at the foot of
the cliffs, where they find a large crowd already gathered, every one
among them similarly laden. Amid much shouting and merry-making, amid
innumerable picturesque scenes of Oriental folk-life, such as are still
common in the Mohammedan cemeteries of Egypt at the Feast of Bairam, the
good towns-people of Siut carry their gifts of food and drink up the
cliff to the numerous doors which honeycomb its face, that their dead
may share the joyous feast with them. It is, indeed, the earliest Feast
of All-Souls. The necropolis guards hasten up to Hepzefi's chapel with
their supplies, which they quickly deliver to his priest, and are off
again to preserve order among the merry crowds now everywhere pushing up
the cliff. <span id="fr_707"></span>[1](#fn_707)

As the day wears on there are busy preparations for the evening
celebration, for the illumination, and the "glorification of the
blessed," who are the dead. The necropolis guards, weary with a long day
of arduous duty in the crowded cemetery, descend for the second time
into the town to the temple of Upwawet. Here they find the entire
priesthood of the temple waiting to receive them. At the head of the
line the "great priest"

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

delivers to the ten guards of the necropolis the torches for Hepzefi's
"illumination." These are quickly kindled from those which the priests
already carry, and the procession of guards and priests together moves
slowly out of the temple court and across the sacred enclosure "to the
northern corner of the temple," as the contract with Hepzefi prescribes,
chanting the "glorification" of Hepzefi. <span
id="fr_708"></span>[1](#fn_708) As they go the priests carry each a
large conical loaf of white bread, such as they had laid before the
statue of Hepzefi in the temple of Anubis five days before. Arrived at
the "northern corner of the temple," the priests turn back to their
duties in the crowded sanctuary, doubtless handing over their loaves to
the necropolis guards, for, as stipulated, these loaves were destined
for the statue of Hepzefi in his tomb. Threading the brightly lighted
streets of the town, the little procession of ten guards pushes its way
with considerable difficulty through the throngs, passing at length the
gate of the Anubis temple, where the illumination is in full progress,
and the statue of Hepzefi is not forgotten. As they emerge from the town
again, still much hampered by the crowds likewise making their way in
the same direction, the dark face of the cliff rising high above them is
dotted here and there with tiny beacons moving slowly upward. These are
the torches of the earlier townspeople,

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

who have already reached the cemetery to plant them before the statues
and burial-places of their dead. The guards climb to Hepzefi's tomb as
they had done the night before and deliver torches and white bread to
Hepzefi's waiting priest. Thus the dead noble shares in the festivities
of the New Year's celebration as his children and former subjects were
doing. <span id="fr_709"></span>[1](#fn_709)

Seventeen days later, on the eve of the Wag-feast, the "great priest of
Anubis" brought forth a bale of torches, and, heading his colleagues,
they "illuminated" the statue of Hepzefi in the temple court, while each
one of them at the same time laid a large white loaf at the feet of the
statue. The procession then passed out of the temple enclosure and wound
through the streets chanting the "glorification" of Hepzefi till they
reached another statue of him which stood at the foot of the stairs
leading up the cliff to his tomb. Here they found the chief of the
desert patrol, or "overseer of the highland," where the necropolis was,
just returning from the magazines in the town, having brought a jar of
beer, a large loaf, five hundred flat cakes, and ten white loaves to be
delivered to Hepzefi's priest at the tomb above. <span
id="fr_710"></span>[2](#fn_710) The next day, the eighteenth of the
first month, the day of the Wag-feast, the priests of Upwawet in the
town each presented the usual large white loaf at Hepzefi's statue in
their temple, followed by an "illumination" and "glorification" as they
marched in procession around the temple court. <span
id="fr_711"></span>[3](#fn_711)

Besides these great feasts which were thus enjoyed by the dead lord, he
was not forgotten on any of the periodic minor feasts which fell on the
first of every month and

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

half-month, or on any "day of a procession." On these days he received a
certain proportion of the meat and beer offered in the temple of
Upwawet. <span id="fr_712"></span>[1](#fn_712) His daily needs were met
by the laymen serving in successive shifts in the temple of Anubis. As
this sanctuary was near the cemetery, these men, after completing their
duties in the temple, went out every day with a portion of bread and a
jar of beer, which they deposited before the statue of Hepzefi "which is
on the lower stairs of his tomb." <span id="fr_713"></span>[2](#fn_713)
There was, therefore, not a day in the year when Hepzefi failed to
receive the food and drink necessary for his maintenance. <span
id="fr_714"></span>[3](#fn_714)

Khnumhotep, the powerful baron of Benihasan, tells us more briefly of
similar precautions which he took before his death. "I adorned the
houses of the kas and the dwelling thereof; I followed my statues to the
temple; I devoted for them their offerings: the bread, beer, water,
wine, incense, and joints of beef credited to the mortuary priest. I
endowed him with fields and peasants; I commanded the mortuary offering
of bread, beer, oxen, and geese at every feast of the necropolis: at the
Feast of the First of the Year, of New Year's Day, of the Great Year, of
the Little Year, of the Last of the Year, the Great Feast, at the Great
Rekeh, at the Little Rekeh, at the Feast of the Five (intercalary) Days
on the Year, at ⌈. . .⌉ the Twelve Monthly Feasts, at the Twelve
Mid-monthly

<span class="smallcaps">Note</span>.—The "bale of torches" above
enumerated is an interpretation of the word "gmḥt," which I rendered

person who shall disturb them, he shall not survive, his son shall not
survive in his place." <span id="fr_716"></span>[2](#fn_716) The
apprehension of the noble is evident, and such apprehensions are common
in documents of this nature. We have seen Hepzefi equally apprehensive.

That these gifts to the dead noble should continue indefinitely was, of
course, quite impossible. We of to-day have little piety for the grave
of a departed grandfather; few of us even know where our
great-grandfathers are interred. The priests of Anubis and Upwawet and
the necropolis guards at Siut will have continued their duties only so
long as Hepzefi's mortuary priest received his income and was true to
his obligations in reminding them of theirs, and in seeing to it that
these obligations were met. We find such an endowment surviving a change
of dynasty (from the Fourth to the Fifth), and lasting at least some
thirty or forty years, in the middle of the twenty-eighth century before
[Christ](errata.htm#6). <span id="fr_717"></span>[3](#fn_717) In the
Twelfth Dynasty, too, there was in Upper Egypt great respect for the
ancestors of the Old Kingdom. The nomarchs of El-Bersheh, in the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries before Christ, repaired the tombs of
their ancestors of the Pyramid Age, tombs then over six hundred years
old, and therefore in a state of ruin. The pious nomarch used to record
his restoration in these words: "He (the nomarch) made (it) as his
monument for his fathers, who are in the necropolis, the lords of this
promontory; restoring what was found

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

in ruin and renewing what was found decayed, the ancestors who were
before not having done it." We find the nobles of this province using
this formula five times in the tombs of their ancestors. <span
id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_718) In the same way, Intef, a baron of
Hermonthis, says: "I found the chapel of the prince Nekhtyoker fallen to
ruin, its walls were old, its statues were shattered, there was no one
who cared for them. It was built up anew, its plan was extended, its
statues were made anew, its doors were built of stone, that its place
might excel beyond that of other august princes." <span
id="fr_719"></span>[2](#fn_719) Such piety toward the departed fathers,
however, was very rare, and even when shown could not do more than
postpone the evil day. The marvel is that with their ancestors’ ruined
tombs before them they nevertheless still went on to build for
themselves sepulchres which were inevitably to meet the same fate. The
tomb of Khnumhotep, the greatest of those left us by the Benihasan lords
of four thousand years ago, bears on its walls, among the beautiful
paintings which adorn them, the scribblings of a hundred and twenty
generations in Egyptian, Coptic, Greek, Arabic, French, Italian, and
English. The earliest of these scrawls is that of an Egyptian scribe who
entered the tomb-chapel over three thousand years ago and wrote with
reed pen and ink upon the wall these words: "The scribe Amenmose came to
see the temple of Khufu and found it like the heavens when the sun rises
therein." <span id="fr_720"></span>[3](#fn_720) The chapel was some
seven hundred years old when this scribe entered it, and its owner,
although one of the greatest lords of his time, was so completely
forgotten that the visitor, finding the name of Khufu in a casual
geographical reference among the inscriptions on the wall, mistook the

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

place for a chapel of Khufu, the builder of the Great Pyramid. All
knowledge of the noble and of the endowments which were to support him
in the hereafter had disappeared in spite of the precautions which we
have read above. How vain and futile now appear the imprecations on
these time-stained walls!

But the Egyptian was not wholly without remedy even in the face of this
dire contingency. He endeavored to meet the difficulty by engraving on
the front of his tomb, prayers believed to be efficacious in supplying
all the needs of the dead in the hereafter. All passers-by were solemnly
adjured to utter these prayers on behalf of the dead.

The belief in the effectiveness of the uttered word on behalf of the
dead had developed enormously since the Old Kingdom. This is a
development which accompanies the popularization of the mortuary customs
of the upper classes. In the Pyramid Age, as we have seen, such
utterances were confined to the later pyramids. These concern
exclusively the destiny of the Pharaoh in the hereafter. They were now
largely appropriated by the middle and the official class. At the same
time there emerge similar utterances, identical in function but
evidently more suited to the needs of common mortals. These represent,
then, a body of similar mortuary literature among the people of the
Feudal Age, some fragments of which are much older than this age. Later
the Book of the Dead was made up of selections from this humbler and
more popular mortuary literature. Copious extracts from both the Pyramid
Texts and these forerunners of the Book of the Dead, about half from
each of the two sources, were now written on the inner surfaces of the
heavy cedar coffins, in which the better burials of this age

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

are found. The number of such mortuary texts is still constantly
increasing as additional coffins from this age are found. Every local
coffin-maker was furnished by the priests of his town with copies of
these utterances. Before the coffins were put together, the scribes in
the maker's employ filled the inner surfaces with pen-and-ink copies of
such texts as he had available. It was all done with great carelessness
and inaccuracy, the effort being to fill up the planks as fast as
possible. They often wrote the same chapter over twice or three times in
the same coffin, and in one instance a chapter is found no less than
five times in the same coffin. <span id="fr_721"></span>[1](#fn_721)

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

In so far as these Coffin Texts are identical with the Pyramid Texts we
are already familiar with their general function and content. <span
id="fr_722"></span>[1](#fn_722) The hereafter to which these citizens of
the Feudal Age looked forward was, therefore, still largely celestial
and Solar as in the Pyramid Age. But even these early chapters of the
Book of the Dead disclose a surprising predominance of the celestial
hereafter. There is the same identification with the Sun-god which we
found in the Pyramid Texts. There is a chapter of "Becoming
Re-Atum," <span id="fr_723"></span>[2](#fn_723) and several of "Becoming
a Falcon." <span id="fr_724"></span>[3](#fn_724) The deceased, now no
longer the king, as in the Pyramid Texts, says: "I am the soul of the
god, self-generator. . . . I have become he. I am he before whom the sky
is silent, I am he before whom the earth is ⌈. . . ⌉ . . . I have become
the limbs of the god, self-generator. He has made me into his heart
(understanding), he has fashioned me into his soul. I am one who has
⌈breathed⌉ the form of him who fashioned me, the august god,
self-generator, whose name the gods know not. . . . He has made me into
his heart, he has fashioned me into his soul, I was not born with a
birth." <span id="fr_725"></span>[4](#fn_725) This identification of the
deceased with the Sun-god alternates with old pictures of the Solar
destiny, involving only association with the Sun-god. There is a chapter
of "Ascending to the Sky to the Place where Re is," <span
id="fr_726"></span>[5](#fn_726) another of "Embarking in

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

the Ship of Re when he has Gone to his Ka; <span
id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_727) and a "Chapter of Entering Into the West
among the Followers of Re Every Day." <span
id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_728) When once there the dead man finds among
his resources a chapter of "Being the Scribe of Re." <span
id="fr_729"></span>[3](#fn_729) He also has a chapter of "Becoming One
Revered by the King," <span id="fr_730"></span>[4](#fn_730) presumably
meaning the Sun-god, as the chapter is a magical formulary for
accomplishing the ascent to the sky. In the same way he may become an
associate of the Sun-god by using a chapter of "Becoming One of ⌈the
Great⌉ of Heliopolis." <span id="fr_731"></span>[5](#fn_731)

The famous seventeenth chapter of the Book of the Dead was already a
favorite chapter in this age, and begins the texts on a number of
coffins. It is largely an identification of the deceased with the
Sun-god, although other gods also appear. The dead man says:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"I am Atum, I who was alone;  
 I am Re at his first appearance.  
 I am the Great God, self-generator,  
 Who fashioned his names, lord of gods,  
 Whom none approaches among the gods.  
 I was yesterday, I know to-morrow.  
 The battle-field of the gods was made when I spake.  
 I know the name of that Great God who is therein.  
 'Praise-of-Re' is his name.  
 I am that great Phœnix which is in Heliopolis."</span>

</div>

Just as in the Pyramid Texts, however, so in these early Texts of the
Book of the Dead, the Osirian theology has

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

intruded and has indeed taken possession of them. Already in the Feudal
Age this ancient Solar text had been supplied with an explanatory
commentary, which adds to the line, "I was yesterday, I know to-morrow,"
the words, "that is Osiris." The result of this Osirianization was the
intrusion of the Osirian *subterranean* hereafter, even in Solar and
celestial texts. Thus this seventeenth chapter was supplied with a title
reading, "Chapter of Ascending by Day from the Nether World." <span
id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_732) This title is not original, and is part
of the Osirian editing, which involuntarily places the sojourn of the
dead in the Nether World though it cannot eliminate all the old Solar
texts. The titles now commonly appended to these texts frequently
conclude with the words, "in the Nether World." We find a chapter for
"The Advancement of a Man in the Nether World," <span
id="fr_733"></span>[2](#fn_733) although it is devoted throughout to
Solar and celestial conceptions. In the Pyramid Texts, as we have seen,
the intrusion of Osiris did not result in altering the essentially
*celestial* character of the hereafter to which they are devoted. In the
Coffin Texts we have not only the commingling of Solar and Osirian
beliefs which now more completely coalesce than before, but the

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

result is that Re is intruded into the *subterranean* hereafter. The
course of events may be stated in somewhat exaggerated form if we say
that in the Pyramid Texts Osiris was lifted skyward, while in the Coffin
Texts and the Book of the Dead, Re is dragged earthward.

The resulting confusion is even worse than in the Pyramid Texts. We
shall shortly find Re appearing with subterranean functions on behalf of
the dead, functions entirely unknown in the Pyramid Texts. The old Solar
idea that the dead might become the scribe of Re, we have already found
in the Coffin Texts; but while the title is given as "Being the Scribe
of Re," the text begins, "I am Kerkeru, scribe of Osiris." <span
id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_734) We can hardly conceive a mass of
mortuary doctrine containing a "Chapter of Reaching Orion," <span
id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_735) a fragment of ancient celestial belief,
side by side with such chapters as "Burial in the West," <span
id="fr_736"></span>[3](#fn_736) "That the Beautiful West Rejoice at the
Approach of a Man," <span id="fr_737"></span>[4](#fn_737) "Chapter of
Becoming the Nile," <span id="fr_738"></span>[5](#fn_738) which is, of
course, a purely Osirian title although the text of the chapter is
Solar; or a chapter of "Becoming the Harvest-god (Neper)," in which the
deceased is identified with Osiris and with barley, as well as with
Neper, god of harvest and grain. <span id="fr_739"></span>[6](#fn_739)

The Coffin Texts already display the tendency, carried so much further
by the Book of the Dead, of enabling the deceased to transform himself
at will into various beings. It was this notion which led Herodotus to
conclude that the Egyptians believed in what we now call transmigration
of souls, but this is a mistaken impression on his part. Besides
identification with Re, Osiris, and other gods,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

which, of course, involved belief in a transformation, the Coffin Texts
also enable the deceased to "become the blazing Eye of Horus." <span
id="fr_740"></span>[1](#fn_740) By the aid of another chapter he can
accomplish the "transformation into an ekhet-bird" <span
id="fr_741"></span>[2](#fn_741) or "into the servant at the table of
Hathor." <span id="fr_742"></span>[3](#fn_742)

It is difficult to gain any coherent conception of the hereafter which
the men of this age thus hoped to attain. There are the composite
Solar-Osirian pictures which we have already found in the Pyramid Texts,
and in which the priests to whom we owe these Coffin Text compilations
allow their fancy to roam at will. The deceased citizen, now sharing the
destiny of Osiris and called such by Horus, hears himself receiving
words of homage and promises of felicity addressed to him by his divine
son:

"I come, I am Horus who opens thy mouth, together with Ptah who
glorifies thee, together with Thoth who gives to thee thy heart
(understanding); . . . that thou mayest remember what thou hadst
forgotten. I cause that thou eat bread at the desire of thy body. I
cause that thou remember what thou hast forgotten. I cause that thou eat
bread . . . more than thou didst on earth. I give to thee thy two feet
that thou mayest make the going and coming of thy two soles (or
sandals). I cause that thou shouldst carry out commissions with the
south wind and shouldst run with the north wind. . . . I cause that thou
shouldst ferry over ⌈Peterui⌉ and ferry over the lake of thy wandering
and the sea of (thy) sandal as thou didst on earth. Thou rulest the
streams and the Phœnix. . . . Thou leviest on the royal domains. Thou
repulsest the violent who comes in the night, the

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

robber of early morning. <span id="fr_743"></span>[1](#fn_743) . . .
Thou goest around the countries with Re; he lets thee see the pleasant
places, thou findest the valleys filled with water for washing thee and
for cooling thee, thou pluckest marsh-flowers and heni-blossoms, lilies
and lotus-flowers. The bird-pools come to thee by thousands, lying in
thy path; when thou hast hurled thy boomerang against them, it is a
thousand that fall at the sound of the wind thereof. They are ro-geese,
green-fronts, quails, and kunuset. <span id="fr_744"></span>[2](#fn_744)
I cause that there be brought to thee the young gazelles, ⌈bullocks⌉ of
white bulls; I cause that there be brought to thee males of goats and
grain-fed males of sheep. There is fastened for thee a ladder to the
sky. Nut gives to thee her two arms. Thou sailest in the Lily-lake. Thou
bearest the wind in an eight-ship. These two fathers (Re and Atum) of
the Imperishable Stars and of the Unweariable Stars sail thee. They
command thee, they tow thee through the district with their imperishable
ropes." <span id="fr_745"></span>[3](#fn_745)

In another Solar-Osirian chapter, after the deceased is crowned,
purified, and glorified, he enters upon the Solar voyage as in the
Pyramid Texts. It is then said of him: "Brought to thee are blocks of
silver and ⌈masses⌉ of malachite. Hathor, mistress of Byblos, she makes
the rudders of thy ship. . . . It is said to thee, 'Come into the
broad-hall,' by the Great who are in the temple. Bared to thee are the
Four Pillars of the Sky, thou seest the secrets that are therein, thou
stretchest out thy two legs upon the Pillars of the Sky and the wind is
sweet to thy nose." <span id="fr_746"></span>[4](#fn_746)

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

While the destiny, everywhere so evidently royal in the Pyramid Texts,
has thus become the portion of any one, the simpler life of the humbler
citizen which he longed to see continued in the hereafter is quite
discernible, also in these Coffin Texts. As he lay in his coffin he
could read a chapter which concerned "Building a house for a man in the
Nether World, digging a pool and planting fruit-trees." <span
id="fr_747"></span>[1](#fn_747) Once supplied with a house, surrounded
by a garden with its pool and its shade-trees, the dead man must be
assured that he shall be able to occupy it, and hence a "chapter of a
man's being in his house." <span id="fr_748"></span>[2](#fn_748) The
lonely sojourn there without the companionship of family and friends was
an intolerable thought, and hence a further chapter entitled "Sealing of
a Decree concerning the Household, to give the Household \[to a man\] in
the Nether World." In the text the details of the decree are five times
specified in different forms. "Geb, hereditary prince of the gods, has
decreed that there be given to me my household, my children, my
brothers, my father, my mother, my slaves, and all my establishment."
Lest they should be withheld by any malign influence the second
paragraph asserts that "Geb, hereditary prince of the gods, has said to
release for me my household, ⌈my⌉ children, my brothers and sisters, my
father, my mother, all my slaves, all my establishment at once, rescued
from every god, from every goddess, from every death (or dead
person)." <span id="fr_749"></span>[3](#fn_749) To assure the fulfilment
of this decree there was another chapter entitled "Uniting of the
Household of a Man with Him in the Nether World," which effected the
"union of the household, father, mother, children, friends,
⌈connections⌉, wives, concubines, slaves, servants,

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

everything belonging to a man, with him in the Nether World." <span
id="fr_750"></span>[1](#fn_750)

The rehabilitation of a man's home and household in the hereafter was a
thought involving, more inevitably even than formerly, the old-time
belief in the necessity of food. It reminds us of the Pyramid Texts when
we find a chapter of "Causing that X Raise Himself Upon his Right
Side." <span id="fr_751"></span>[2](#fn_751) The mummy lies upon the
left side, and he rises to the other side in order that he may partake
of food. Hence, another "Chapter of Eating Bread in the Nether
World," <span id="fr_752"></span>[3](#fn_752) or "Eating of Bread on the
Table of Re, Giving of Plenty in Heliopolis." <span
id="fr_753"></span>[4](#fn_753) The very next chapter shows us how "the
sitter sits to eat bread when Re sits to eat bread. . . . Give to me
bread when I am hungry. Give to me beer when I am thirsty." <span
id="fr_754"></span>[5](#fn_754)

A tendency which later came fully to its own in the Book of the Dead is
already the dominant tendency in these Coffin Texts. It regards the
hereafter as a place of innumerable dangers and ordeals, most of them of
a physical nature, although they sometimes concern also the intellectual
equipment of the deceased. The weapon to be employed and the surest
means of defence available to the deceased was some magical agency,
usually a charm to be pronounced at the critical moment. This tendency
then inclined to make the Coffin Texts, and ultimately the Book of the
Dead which grew out of them, more and more a collection of charms, which
were regarded as inevitably effective in protecting the dead or securing
for him any of the blessings which were desired in the life beyond the
grave. There was, therefore, a chapter of

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Becoming a
Magician," addressed to the august ones who are in the presence of Atum
the Sun-god. It is, of course, itself a charm and concludes with the
words, "I am a magician." <span id="fr_755"></span>[1](#fn_755) Lest the
dead man should lose his magic power, there was a ceremony involving the
"attachment of a charm so that the magical power of man may not be taken
away from him in the Nether World." <span
id="fr_756"></span>[2](#fn_756) The simplest of the dangers against
which these charms were supplied doubtless arose in the childish
imagination of the common folk. They are frequently grotesque in the
extreme. We find a chapter "preventing that the head of a man be taken
from him." <span id="fr_757"></span>[3](#fn_757) There is the old charm
found also in the Pyramid Texts to prevent a man from being obliged to
eat his own foulness. <span id="fr_758"></span>[4](#fn_758) He is not
safe from the decay of death; hence there are two chapters that "a man
may not decay in the Nether World." <span
id="fr_759"></span>[5](#fn_759) But the imagination of the priests, who
could only gain by the issuance of ever new chapters, undoubtedly
contributed much to heighten the popular dread of the dangers of the
hereafter and spread the belief in the usefulness of such means for
meeting them. We should doubtless recognize the work of the priests in
the figure of a mysterious scribe named Gebga, who is hostile to the
dead, so that a charm was specially devised to enable the dead man to
break the pens, smash the writing outfit, and tear up the rolls of the
malicious Gebga. <span id="fr_760"></span>[6](#fn_760) That menacing

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

danger which was also feared in the Pyramid Texts, the assaults of
venomous serpents, must likewise be met by the people of the Feudal Age.
The dead man, therefore, finds in his roll charms for "Repulsing Apophis
from the Barque of Re" and for "Repulsing the Serpent which ⌈Afflicts⌉
the Kas," <span id="fr_761"></span>[1](#fn_761) not to mention also one
for "Repulsing Serpents and Repulsing Crocodiles." <span
id="fr_762"></span>[2](#fn_762) The way of the departed was furthermore
beset with fire, and he would be lost without a charm for "Going Forth
from the Fire," <span id="fr_763"></span>[3](#fn_763) or of "Going Forth
from the Fire Behind the Great God." <span
id="fr_764"></span>[4](#fn_764) When he was actually obliged to enter
the fire he might do so with safety by means of a "Chapter of Entering
Into the Fire and of Coming Forth from the Fire Behind the Sky." <span
id="fr_765"></span>[5](#fn_765) Indeed, the priests had devised a chart
of the journey awaiting the dead, guiding him through the gate of fire
at the entrance and showing the two ways by which he might proceed, one
by land and the other by water, with a lake of fire between them. This
Book of the Two Ways, with its map of the journey, was likewise recorded
in the coffin. <span id="fr_766"></span>[6](#fn_766) In spite of such
guidance it might unluckily happen that the dead wander into the place
of execution of the gods; but from this he was saved by a chapter of
"Not Entering Into the Place of Execution of the Gods; <span
id="fr_767"></span>[7](#fn_767) and lest he should suddenly find himself
condemned to walk head downward, he

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

was supplied with a "Chapter of Not Walking Head Downward." <span
id="fr_768"></span>[1](#fn_768) These unhappy dead who were compelled to
go head downward were the most malicious enemies in the hereafter.
Protection against them was vitally necessary. It is said to the
deceased: "Life comes to thee, but death comes not to thee. . . . They
(Orion, Sothis, and the Morning Star) save thee from the wrath of the
dead who go head downward. Thou art not among them. . . . Rise up for
life, thou diest not; lift thee up for life, thou diest not." <span
id="fr_769"></span>[2](#fn_769) The malice of the dead was a danger
constantly threatening the newly arrived soul, who says: "He causes that
I gain the power over my enemies. I have expelled them from their tombs.
I have overthrown them in their (tomb-) chapels. I have expelled those
who were in their places. I have opened their mummies, destroyed their
kas. I have suppressed their souls. . . . An edict of the Self-Generator
has been issued against my enemies among the dead, among the living,
dwelling in sky and earth." <span id="fr_770"></span>[3](#fn_770) The
belief in the efficacy of magic as an infallible agent in the hand of
the dead man was thus steadily growing, and we shall see it ultimately
dominating the whole body of mortuary belief as it emerges a few
centuries later in the Book of the Dead. It cannot be doubted that the
popularity of the Osirian faith had much to do with this increase in the
use of mortuary magical agencies. The Osiris myth, now universally
current, made all classes familiar with the same agencies employed by
Isis in the raising of Osiris from the dead, while the same myth in its
various versions told the people how similar magical power had been
employed by Anubis, Thoth, and Horus on behalf of the dead and
persecuted Osiris.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

Powerful as the Osiris faith had been in the Pyramid Age, its wide
popularity now surpassed anything before known. We see in it the triumph
of folk-religion as opposed to or contrasted with a state cult like that
of Re. The supremacy of Re was a political triumph; that of Osiris,
while unquestionably fostered by an able priesthood probably practising
constant propaganda, was a triumph of popular faith among all classes of
society, a triumph which not even the court and the nobles were able to
resist. The blessings which the Osirian destiny in the hereafter offered
to all proved an attraction of universal power. If they had once been an
exclusively royal prerogative, as was the Solar destiny in the Pyramid
Texts, we have seen that even the royal Solar hereafter had now been
appropriated by all. One of the ancient tombs of the Thinite kings at
Abydos, a tomb now thirteen or fourteen hundred years old, had by this
time come to be regarded as the tomb of Osiris. It rapidly became the
Holy Sepulchre of Egypt, to which all classes pilgrimaged. The greatest
of all blessings was to be buried in the vicinity of this sacred tomb,
and more than one functionary took advantage of some official journey or
errand to erect a tomb there. <span id="fr_771"></span>[1](#fn_771) If a
real tomb was impossible, it was nevertheless beneficial to build at
least a false tomb there bearing one's name and the names of one's
family and relatives. Failing this, great numbers of pilgrims and
visiting officials each erected a memorial tablet or stela bearing
prayers to the great god on behalf of the visitor and his family. Thus
an official of Amenemhet II, who was sent by the king on a journey of
inspection among the temples of the South, says on his stela found at
Abydos: "I fixed my name at the place where

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

is the god Osiris, First of the Westerners, Lord of Eternity, Ruler of
the West, (the place) to which all that is flees, for the sake of the
benefit therein, in the midst of the followers of the Lord of Life, that
I might eat his loaf and 'ascend by day'; that my soul might enjoy the
ceremonies of people kind in heart toward my tomb and in hand toward my
stela." <span id="fr_772"></span>[1](#fn_772) Another under Sesostris I
says: "I have made this tomb at the stairway of the Great God, in order
that I may be among his followers, while the soldiers who follow his
majesty give to my ka of his bread and his ⌈provision⌉, just as every
royal messenger does who comes inspecting the boundaries of his
majesty." <span id="fr_773"></span>[2](#fn_773) The enclosure and the
approach to the temple of Osiris were filled with these memorials, which
as they survive to-day form an important part of our documentary
material for the history of this age. The body of a powerful baron might
even be brought to Abydos to undergo certain ceremonies there, and to
bring back certain things to his tomb at home, as the Arab brings back
water from the well of Zemzem, or as Roman ladies brought back sacred
water from the sanctuary of Isis at Philæ. Khnumhotep of Benihasan has
depicted on the walls of his tomb-chapel this voyage on the Nile,
showing his embalmed body resting on a funeral barge which is being
towed northward, accompanied by priests and lectors. The inscription
calls it the "voyage up-stream to know the things of Abydos." A pendent
scene showing a voyage down-stream is accompanied by the words, "the
return bringing the things of Abydos." <span
id="fr_774"></span>[3](#fn_774) Just what these sacred

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "things of Abydos"
may have been we have no means of knowing, <span
id="fr_775"></span>[1](#fn_775) but it is evident that on this visit to
the great god at Abydos, it was expected that the dead might personally
present himself and thus ensure himself the favor of the god in the
hereafter.

The visitors who thus came to Abydos, before or after death, brought so
many votive offerings that the modern excavators of the Osiris tomb
found it deeply buried under a vast accumulation of broken pots and
other gifts left there by the pilgrims of thousands of years. There must
eventually have been multitudes of such pilgrims at this Holy Sepulchre
of Egypt at all times, but especially at that season when in the
earliest known drama the incidents of the god's myth were dramatically
re-enacted in what may properly be called a "passion play." Although
this play is now completely lost, the memorial stone of Ikhernofret, an
officer of Sesostris III, who was sent by the king to undertake some
restorations in the Osiris temple at Abydos, a stone now preserved in
Berlin, furnishes an outline from which we may draw at least the titles
of the most important acts. These show us that the drama must have
continued for a number of days, and that each of the more important acts
probably lasted at least a day, the multitude participating in much that
was done. In the brief narrative of Ikhernofret we discern eight acts.

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The first
discloses the old mortuary god Upwawet issuing in procession that he may
scatter the enemies of Osiris and open the way for him. In the second
act Osiris himself appears in his sacred barque, into which ascend
certain of the pilgrims. Among these is Ikhernofret, as he proudly tells
in his inscription. There he aids in repelling the foes of Osiris who
beset the course of the barque, and there is undoubtedly a general
*melée* of the multitude, such as Herodotus saw at Papremis fifteen
hundred years later, some in the barque defending the god, and others,
proud to carry away a broken head on behalf of the celebration, acting
as his enemies in the crowd below. Ikhernofret, like Herodotus, passes
over the death of the god in silence. It was a thing too sacred to be
described. He only tells that he arranged the "Great Procession" of the
god, a triumphal celebration of some sort, when the god met his death.
This was the third act. In the fourth Thoth goes forth and doubtless
finds the body, though this is not stated. The fifth act is made up of
the sacred ceremonies by which the body of the god is prepared for
entombment, while in the sixth we behold the multitude moving out in a
vast throng to the Holy Sepulchre in the desert behind Abydos to lay
away the body of the dead god in his tomb. The seventh act must have
been an imposing spectacle. On the shore or water of Nedyt, near Abydos,
the enemies of Osiris, including of course Set and his companions, are
overthrown in a great battle by Horus, the son of Osiris. The raising of
the god from the dead is not mentioned by Ikhernofret, but in the eighth
and final act we behold Osiris, restored to life, entering the Abydos
temple in triumphal procession. It is thus evident that the drama
presented the chief incidents in the myth.

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

As narrated by Ikhernofret, the acts in which he participated were
these:

\(1\) "I celebrated the 'Procession of Upwawet' when he proceeded to
champion his father (Osiris)."

\(2\) "I repulsed those who were hostile to the Neshmet barque, and I
overthrew the enemies of Osiris."

\(3\) "I celebrated the 'Great Procession,' following the god in his
footsteps."

\(4\) "I sailed the divine barque, while Thoth . . . the voyage."

\(5\) "I equipped the barque (called) 'Shining in Truth,' of the Lord of
Abydos, with a chapel; I put on his beautiful regalia when he went forth
to the district of Peker."

\(6\) "I led the way of the god to his tomb in Peker."

\(7\) "I championed Wennofer (Osiris) on 'That Day of the Great Battle';
I overthrew all the enemies upon the shore of Nedyt."

\(8\) "I caused him to proceed into the barque (called) 'The Great'; it
bore his beauty; I gladdened the heart of the eastern highlands; I
\[put\] jubilation in the western highlands, when they saw the beauty of
the Neshmet barque. It landed at Abydos and they brought \[Osiris, First
of the Westerners, Lord\] of Abydos to his palace." <span
id="fr_776"></span>[1](#fn_776)

It is evident that such popular festivals as these gained a great place
in the affections of the people, and over and over again, on their
Abydos tablets, the pilgrims pray that after death they may be
privileged to participate in these celebrations, just as Hepzefi
arranged to do so in those at Siut. Thus presented in dramatic form the
incidents

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

of the Osiris myth made a powerful impression upon the people. The
"passion play" in one form or another caught the imagination of more
than one community, and just as Herodotus found it at Papremis, so now
it spread from town to town, to take the chief place in the calendar of
festivals. Osiris thus gained a place in the life and the hopes of the
common people held by no other god. The royal destiny of Osiris and his
triumph over death, thus vividly portrayed in dramatic form, rapidly
disseminated among the people the belief that this destiny, once
probably reserved for the king, might be shared by all. As we have said
before, it needed but the same magical agencies employed by Isis to
raise her dead consort, or by Horus, Anubis, and Thoth, as they wrought
on behalf of the slain Osiris, to bring to every man the blessed destiny
of the departed god. Such a development of popular mortuary belief, as
we have already seen, inevitably involved also a constantly growing
confidence in the efficiency of magic in the hereafter.

It is difficult for the modern mind to understand how completely the
belief in magic penetrated the whole substance of life, dominating
popular custom and constantly appearing in the simplest acts of the
daily household routine, as much a matter of course as sleep or the
preparation of food. It constituted the very atmosphere in which the men
of the early Oriental world lived. Without the saving and salutary
influence of such magical agencies constantly invoked, the life of an
ancient household in the East was unthinkable. The destructive powers
would otherwise have annihilated all. While it was especially against
disease that such means must be employed, the ordinary processes of
domestic and economic life were constantly placed under its protection.
The mother

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

never hushed her ailing babe and laid it to rest without invoking unseen
powers to free the child from the dark forms of evil, malice, and
disease that lurked in every shadowy corner, or, slinking in through the
open door as the gloom of night settled over the house, entered the tiny
form and racked it with fever. Such demons might even assume friendly
guise and approach under pretext of soothing and healing the little
sufferer. We can still hear the mother's voice as she leans over her
babe and casts furtive glances through the open door into the darkness
where the powers of evil dwell.

"Run out, thou who comest in darkness, who enterest in ⌈stealth⌉, his
nose behind him, his face turned backward, who loses that for which he
came."

"Run out, thou who comest in darkness, who enterest in ⌈stealth⌉, her
nose behind her, her face turned backward, who loses that for which she
came."

"Comest thou to kiss this child? I will not let thee kiss him."

"Comest thou to soothe (him)? I will not let thee soothe him.

"Comest thou to harm him? I will not let thee harm him.

"Comest thou to take him away? I will not let thee take him away from
me.

"I have made his protection against thee out of Efet-herb, it makes
pain; out of onions, which harm thee; out of honey which is sweet to
(living) men and bitter to those who are yonder (the dead); out of the
evil (parts) of the Ebdu-fish; out of the jaw of the meret; out of the
backbone of the perch." <span id="fr_777"></span>[1](#fn_777)

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

The apprehensive mother employs not only the uttered charm as an
exorcism, but adds a delectable mixture of herbs, honey, and fish to be
swallowed by the child, and designed to drive out the malignant demons,
male and female, which afflict the baby with disease or threaten to
carry it away. A hint as to the character of these demons is contained
in the description of honey as "sweet to men (meaning the living) and
bitter to those who are yonder (the dead)." It is evident that the
demons dreaded were some of them the disembodied dead. At this point the
life of the living throughout its course impinged upon that of the dead.
The malicious dead must be bridled and held in check. Charms and magical
devices which had proved efficacious against them during earthly life
might prove equally valuable in the hereafter. This charm which
prevented the carrying away of the child might also be employed to
prevent a man's heart from being taken away in the Nether World. The
dead man need only say: "Hast thou come to take away this my living
heart? This my living heart is not given to thee;" whereupon the demon
that would seize and flee with it must inevitably slink away. <span
id="fr_778"></span>[1](#fn_778)

Thus the magic of daily life was more and more brought to bear on the
hereafter and placed at the service of the dead. As the Empire rose in
the sixteenth century B.C., we find this folk-charm among the mortuary
texts inserted in the tomb. It is embodied in a charm now entitled
"Chapter of Not Permitting a Man's Heart to be Taken Away from Him in
the Nether World," <span id="fr_779"></span>[2](#fn_779) a chapter

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

which we found already in the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom. These
charms have now increased in number, and each has its title indicating
just what it is intended to accomplish for the deceased. Combined with
some of the old hymns of praise to Re and Osiris, some of which might be
recited at the funeral, <span id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_780) and
usually including also some account of the judgment, these mortuary
texts were now written on a roll of papyrus and deposited with the dead
in the tomb. It is these papyri which have now commonly come to be
called the Book of the Dead. As a matter of fact, there was in the
Empire no such book. <span id="fr_781"></span>[2](#fn_781) Each roll
contained a random collection of such mortuary texts as the scribal
copyist happened to have at hand, or those which he found enabled him
best to sell his rolls; that is, such as enjoyed the greatest
popularity. There were sumptuous and splendid rolls, sixty to eighty
feet long and containing from seventy-five to as many as a hundred and
twenty-five or thirty chapters. On the other hand, the scribes also
copied small and modest rolls but a few feet in length, bearing but a
meagre selection of the more important chapters. No two rolls exhibit
the same collection of charms and chapters throughout, and it was not
until the Ptolemaic period, some time after the fourth century B.C.,
that a more nearly canonical selection of chapters

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

was gradually introduced. It will be seen, then, as we have said, that,
properly speaking, there was in the Empire no *Book* of the Dead, but
only various groups of mortuary chapters filling the mortuary papyri of
the time. The entire body of chapters from which these rolls were made
up, were some two hundred in number, although even the largest rolls did
not contain them all. The independence or identity of each chapter is
now evident in the custom of prefixing to every chapter a title—a custom
which had begun in the case of many chapters in the Coffin Texts. Groups
of chapters forming the most common nucleus of the Book of the Dead were
frequently called "Chapters of Ascending by Day," a designation also in
use in the Coffin Texts (see [p. 276](#page_276)); but there was no
current title for a roll of the Book of the Dead as a whole.

While a few scanty fragments of the Pyramid Texts have survived in the
Book of the Dead, it may nevertheless be said that they have almost
disappeared. <span id="fr_782"></span>[1](#fn_782) The Coffin Texts
reappear, however, in increasing numbers and contribute largely to the
various collections which make up the Book of the Dead. An innovation of
which only indications are found in the Coffin Texts is the insertion in
the Empire rolls of gorgeous vignettes illustrating the career of the
deceased in the next world. Great confidence was placed in their
efficacy, especially, as we shall see, in the scene of the judgment,
which was now elaborately illustrated. It may be said that these
illustrations in the Book of the Dead are another example of the
elaboration of magical devices designed to ameliorate the life beyond
the grave. Indeed, the Book of the Dead itself, as a whole, is but a
far-reaching and complex illustration of the increasing dependence on
magic in the hereafter.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

The benefits to be obtained in this way were unlimited, and it is
evident that the ingenuity of a mercenary priesthood now played a large
part in the development which followed. To the luxurious nobles of the
Empire, the old peasant vision of the hereafter where the dead man might
plough and sow and reap in the happy fields, and where the grain grew to
be seven cubits (about twelve feet) high, <span
id="fr_783"></span>[1](#fn_783) did not appear an attractive prospect.
To be levied for labor and to be obliged to go forth and toil, even in
the fields of the blessed, no longer appealed to the pampered grandees
of an age of wealth and luxury. Already in the Middle Kingdom wooden
figures of the servants of the dead were placed in the tomb, that they
might labor for him in death as they had done in life. This idea was now
carried somewhat further. Statuettes of the dead man bearing sack and
hoe were fashioned, and a cunning charm was devised and written upon the
breast of the figure: "O statuette, <span
id="fr_784"></span>[2](#fn_784) counted for X (name of deceased), if I
am called, if I am counted to do any work that is done in the Nether
World, . . . thou shalt count thyself for me at all times, to cultivate
the fields, to water the shores, to transport sand of the east to the
west, and say, 'Here am I." This charm was placed among those in the
roll, with the title, "Chapter of Causing that the Statuette Do the Work
of a Man in the Nether World." <span id="fr_785"></span>[3](#fn_785) The
device was further elaborated by finally placing one such little figure
of the dead in the tomb for each day in the year, and they have been
found in the Egyptian cemeteries in such numbers that museums

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

and private collections all over the world, as has been well said, are
"populated" with them.

With such means of gain so easily available, we cannot wonder that the
priests and scribes of this age took advantage of the opportunity. The
dangers of the hereafter were now greatly multiplied, and for every
critical situation the priest was able to furnish the dead with an
effective charm which would infallibly save him. Besides many charms
which enabled the dead to reach the world of the hereafter, there were
those which prevented him from losing his mouth, his head, his heart,
others which enabled him to remember his name, to breathe, eat, drink,
avoid eating his own foulness, to prevent his drinking-water from
turning into flame, to turn darkness into light, to ward off all
serpents and other hostile monsters, and many others. The desirable
transformations, too, had now increased, and a short chapter might in
each case enable the dead man to assume the form of a falcon of gold, a
divine falcon, a lily, a Phœnix, a heron, a swallow, a serpent called
"son of earth," a crocodile, a god, and, best of all, there was a
chapter so potent that by its use a man might assume any form that he
desired.

It is such productions as these which form by far the larger proportion
of the mass of texts which we term the Book of the Dead. To call it the
Bible of the Egyptians, then, is quite to mistake the function and
content of these rolls. <span id="fr_786"></span>[1](#fn_786) The
tendency which brought forth this mass of "chapters" is also
characteristically evident in two other books each of which was in
itself a coherent and

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

connected composition. The Book of the Two Ways, as old, we remember, as
the Middle Kingdom, <span id="fr_787"></span>[1](#fn_787) had already
contributed much to the Book of the Dead regarding the fiery gates
through which the dead gained entrance to the world beyond and to the
two ways by which he was to make his journey. <span
id="fr_788"></span>[2](#fn_788) On the basis of such fancies as these,
the imagination of the priests now put forth a "Book of Him Who is in
the Nether World," describing the subterranean journey of the sun during
the night as he passed through twelve long cavernous galleries beneath
the earth, each one representing a journey of an hour, the twelve
caverns leading the sun at last to the point in the east where he
rises. <span id="fr_789"></span>[3](#fn_789) The other book, commonly
called the "Book of the Gates, "represents each of the twelve caverns as
entered by a gate and concerns itself with the passage of these gates.
While these compositions never gained the popularity enjoyed by the Book
of the Dead, they are magical guide-books devised for gain, just as was
much of the material which made up the Book of the Dead.

That which saves the Book of the Dead itself from being exclusively a
magical *vade mecum* for use in the hereafter is its elaboration of the
ancient idea of the moral judgment, and its evident appreciation of the
burden of conscience. The relation with God had become something more
than merely the faithful observance of external rites. It had become to
some extent a matter of the heart and of character. Already in the
Middle Kingdom the wise man had discerned the responsibility of the
inner man, of the heart or understanding. The

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

man of ripe and morally sane understanding is his ideal, and his counsel
is to be followed. "A hearkener (to good counsel) is one whom the god
loves. Who hearkens not is one whom the god hates. It is the heart
(understanding) which makes its possessor a hearkener or one not
hearkening. The life, prosperity, and health of a man is in his
heart." <span id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_790) A court herald of Thutmose
III in recounting his services likewise says: "It was my heart which
caused that I should do them (his services for the king), by its
guidance of my affairs. It was . . . as an excellent witness. I did not
disregard its speech, I feared to transgress its guidance. I prospered
thereby greatly, I was successful by reason of that which it caused me
to do, I was distinguished by its guidance. 'Lo, . . . ,' said the
people, 'it is an oracle of God in every body. <span
id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_791) Prosperous is he whom it has guided to
the good way of achievement, 'Lo, thus I was." <span
id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_792) The relatives of Paheri, a prince of El
Kab, addressing him after his death, pray, "Mayest thou spend eternity
in gladness of heart, in the favor of the god that is in thee," <span
id="fr_793"></span>[4](#fn_793) and another dead man similarly declares,
"The heart of a man is his own god, and my heart was satisfied with my
deeds." <span id="fr_794"></span>[5](#fn_794) To this inner voice of the
heart, which with surprising insight was even termed a man's god, the
Egyptian was now more sensitive than ever before during the long course
of the ethical evolution which we have been following. This

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

sensitiveness finds very full expression in the most important if not
the longest section of the Book of the Dead. Whereas the judgment
hereafter is mentioned as far back as the Pyramid Age, we now find a
full account and description of it in the Book of the Dead. <span
id="fr_795"></span>[1](#fn_795) Notwithstanding the prominence of the
intruding Osiris in the judgment we shall clearly discern its Solar
origin and character even as recounted in the Book of the Dead. Three
different versions of the judgment, doubtless originally independent,
have been combined in the fullest and best rolls. The first is entitled,
"Chapter of Entering Into the Hall of Truth (or Righteousness)," <span
id="fr_796"></span>[2](#fn_796) and it contains "that which is said on
reaching the Hall of Truth, when X (the deceased's name) is purged from
all evil that he has done, and he beholds the face of the god. 'Hail to
thee, great god, lord of Truth. <span id="fr_797"></span>[3](#fn_797) I
have come to thee, my lord, and I am led (thither) in order to see thy
beauty. I know thy name, I know the names of the forty-two gods who are
with thee in the Hall of Truth, who live on evil-doers and devour their
blood, on that day of reckoning character before Wennofer
(Osiris). <span id="fr_798"></span>[4](#fn_798) Behold, I come to thee,
I bring to thee righteousness and I expel for thee sin. I have committed
no sin against people. . . . I have not done evil in the place of truth.
I knew no wrong. I did no evil thing. . . . I did not do that which the
god abominates.

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I did not report
evil of a servant to his master. I allowed no one to hunger. I caused no
one to weep. I did not murder. I did not command to murder. I caused no
man misery. I did not diminish food in the temples. I did not decrease
the offerings of the gods. I did not take away the food-offerings of the
dead (literally "glorious"). I did not commit adultery. I did not commit
self-pollution in the pure precinct of my city-god. I did not diminish
the grain measure. I did not diminish the span. <span
id="fr_799"></span>[1](#fn_799) I did not diminish the land measure. I
did not load the weight of the balances. I did not deflect the index of
the scales. I did not take milk from the mouth of the child. I did not
drive away the cattle from their pasturage. I did not snare the fowl of
the gods. I did not catch the fish in their pools. I did not hold back
the water in its time. I did not dam the running water. <span
id="fr_800"></span>[2](#fn_800) I did not quench the fire in its
time. <span id="fr_801"></span>[3](#fn_801) I did not withhold the herds
of the temple endowments. I did not interfere with the god in his
payments. I am purified four times, I am pure as that great Phœnix is
pure which is in Heracleopolis. For I am that nose of the Lord of Breath
who keeps alive all the people.'" <span id="fr_802"></span>[4](#fn_802)
The address of the deceased now merges into obscure mythological
allusions, and he concludes with the statement, "There arises no evil
thing against me in this land, in the Hall of Truth, because I know the
names of these gods who are therein, the followers of the Great God."

A second scene of judgment is now enacted. The

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

judge Osiris is assisted by forty-two gods who sit with him in judgment
on the dead. They are terrifying demons, each bearing a grotesque and
horrible name, which the deceased claims that he knows. He therefore
addresses them one after the other by name. They are such names as
these: "Broad-Stride-that-Came-out-of-Heliopolis,"
"Flame-Hugger-that-Came-out-of-Troja,"
"Nosey-that-Came-out-of-Hermopolis,"
"Shadow-Eater-that-Came-out-of-the-Cave,"
"Turn-Face-that-Came-out-of-Rosta,"
"Two-Eyes-of-Flame-that-Came-out-of-Letopolis,"
"Bone-Breaker-that-Came-out-of-Heracleopolis,"
"White-Teeth-that-Came-out-of -the-Secret-Land,"
"Blood-Eater-that-Came-out-of-the-Place-of-Execution,"
"Eater-of-Entrails-that-Came-out-of-Mebit." These and other equally
edifying creations of priestly imagination the deceased calls upon,
addressing to each in turn a declaration of innocence of some particular
sin.

This section of the Book of the Dead is commonly called the
"Confession." It would be difficult to devise a term more opposed to the
real character of the dead man's statement, which as a declaration of
innocence is, of course, the reverse of a confession. The ineptitude of
the designation has become so evident that some editors have added the
word negative, and thus call it the "negative confession," which means
nothing at all. The Egyptian does not confess at this judgment, and this
is a fact of the utmost importance in his religious development, as we
shall see. To mistake this section of the Book of the Dead for
"confession" is totally to misunderstand the development which was now
slowly carrying him toward that complete acknowledgment and humble
disclosure of his sin which is nowhere found in the Book of the Dead.

It is evident that the forty-two gods are an artificial

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

creation. As was long ago noticed, they represent the forty or more
nomes, or administrative districts, of Egypt. The priests doubtless
built up this court of forty-two judges in order to control the
character of the dead from all quarters of the country. The deceased
would find himself confronted by one judge at least who was acquainted
with his local reputation, and who could not be deceived. The forty-two
declarations addressed to this court cover much the same ground as those
we have already rendered in the first address. The editors had some
difficulty in finding enough sins to make up a list of forty-two, and
there are several verbal repetitions, not to mention essential
repetitions with slight changes in the wording. The crimes which may be
called those of violence are these: "I did not slay men (5), I did not
rob (2), I did not steal (4), I did not rob one crying for his
possessions (18), <span id="fr_803"></span>[1](#fn_803) my fortune was
not great but by my (own) property (41), I did not take away food (10),
I did not stir up fear (21), I did not stir up strife (25)."
Deceitfulness and other undesirable qualities of character are also
disavowed:

"I did not speak lies (9), I did not make falsehood in the place of
truth (40), I was not deaf to truthful words (24), I did not diminish
the grain-measure (6), I was not avaricious (3), my heart devoured not
(coveted not?) (28), my heart was not hasty (31), I did not multiply
words in speaking (33), my voice was not over loud (37), my mouth did
not wag (lit. go) (17), I did not wax hot (in temper) (23), I did not
revile (29), I was not an eavesdropper (16), I was not puffed up (39)."
The dead man is free from sexual immorality: "I did not commit adultery
with a

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

woman (19), I did not commit self-pollution (20, 27);" and ceremonial
transgressions are also denied: "I did not revile the king (35), I did
not blaspheme the god (38), I did not slay the divine bull (13), I did
not steal temple endowment (8), I did not diminish food in the temple
(15), I did not do an abomination of the gods (42)." These, with several
repetitions and some that are unintelligible, make up the declaration of
innocence. <span id="fr_804"></span>[1](#fn_804)

Having thus vindicated himself before the entire great court, the
deceased confidently addresses them: "Hail to you, ye gods! I know you,
I know your names. I fall not before your blades. Report not evil of me
to this god whom ye follow. My case does not come before you. Speak ye
the truth concerning me before the All-Lord; because I did the truth (or
righteousness) in the land of Egypt. I did not revile the god. My case
did not come before the king then reigning. Hail to you, ye gods who are
in the Hall of Truth, in whose bodies are neither sin nor falsehood, who
live on truth in Heliopolis . . . before Horus dwelling in his
sun-disk. <span id="fr_805"></span>[2](#fn_805) Save ye me from
Babi, <span id="fr_806"></span>[3](#fn_806) who lives on the entrails of
the great, on that day of the great reckoning. Behold, I come to you
without sin, without evil, without wrong. . . . I live on righteousness,
I feed on the righteousness of my heart. I have done that which men say,
and that wherewith the gods are content. I. have satisfied the god with
that which he desires. I gave bread to the hungry, water to the thirsty,
clothing to the naked, and a ferry to him who was without a boat. I made
divine offerings for the gods and food-offerings for

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

the dead. Save ye me; protect ye me. Enter no complaint against me
before the Great God. For I am one of pure mouth and pure hands, to whom
was said 'Welcome, welcome' by those who saw him." <span
id="fr_807"></span>[1](#fn_807) With these words the claims of the
deceased to moral worthiness merge into affirmations that he has
observed all ceremonial requirements of the Osirian faith, and these
form more than half of this concluding address to the gods of the court.

The third record of the judgment was doubtless the version which made
the deepest impression upon the Egyptian. Like the drama of Osiris at
Abydos, it is graphic and depicts the judgment as effected by the
balances. In the sumptuously illustrated papyrus of Ani <span
id="fr_808"></span>[2](#fn_808) we see Osiris sitting enthroned at one
end of the judgment hall, with Isis and Nephthys standing behind him.
Along one side of the hall are ranged the nine gods of the Heliopolitan
Ennead, headed by the Sun-god. <span id="fr_809"></span>[3](#fn_809)
*They* afterward announce the verdict, showing the originally Solar
origin of this third scene of judgment, in which Osiris has now assumed
the chief place. In the midst stand "the balances of Re wherewith he
weighs truth," as we have seen them called in the Feudal Age; <span
id="fr_810"></span>[4](#fn_810) but the judgment in which they figure
has now become Osirianized. The balances are manipulated by the ancient
mortuary god Anubis, behind whom stands the divine scribe Thoth, who
presides over the weighing, pen and writing palette

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

in hand, that he may record the result. Behind him crouches a grotesque
monster called the "Devouress," with the head of a crocodile, fore
quarters of a lion and hind quarters of a hippopotamus, waiting to
devour the unjust soul. Beside the balances in subtle suggestiveness
stands the figure of "Destiny" accompanied by Renenet and Meskhenet, the
two goddesses of birth, about to contemplate the fate of the soul at
whose coming into this world they had once presided. Behind the
enthroned divinities sit the gods "Taste" and "Intelligence." In other
rolls we not infrequently find standing at the entrance the goddess
"Truth, daughter of Re," who ushers into the hall of judgment the newly
arrived soul. Ani and his wife, with bowed heads and deprecatory
gestures, enter the fateful hall, and Anubis at once calls for the heart
of Ani. In the form of a tiny vase, which is in Egyptian writing the
hieroglyph for heart, one side of the balances bears the heart of Ani,
while in the other side appears a feather, the symbol and hieroglyph for
Truth or Righteousness. At the critical moment Ani addresses his own
heart: "O my heart that came from my mother! O my heart belonging to my
being! Rise not up against me as a witness. Oppose me not in the council
(court of justice). Be not hostile to me before the master of the
balances. Thou art my ka that is in my body. . . . Let not my name be of
evil odor with the court, speak no lie against me in the presence of the
god."

Evidently this appeal has proven effective, for Thoth, "envoy of the
Great Ennead, that is in the presence of Osiris," at once says: "Hear ye
this word in truth. I have judged the heart of Osiris \[Ani\] <span
id="fr_811"></span>[1](#fn_811) His soul stands as a witness concerning
him, his character is just by the great

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

balances. No sin of his has been found." The Nine Gods of the Ennead at
once respond: "⌈How good⌉ it is, this which comes forth from thy just
mouth. Osiris Ani, the justified, witnesses. There is no sin of his,
there is no evil of his with us. The Devouress shall not be given power
over him. Let there be given to him the bread that cometh forth before
Osiris, the domain that abideth in the field of offerings, like the
Followers of Horus."

Having thus received a favorable verdict, the fortunate Ani is led
forward by "Horus, son of Isis," who presents him to Osiris, at the same
time saying: "I come to thee, Wennofer; I bring to thee Osiris Ani. His
righteous heart comes forth from the balances and he has no sin in the
sight of any god or goddess. Thoth has judged him in writing; the Nine
Gods have spoken concerning him a very just testimony. Let there be
given to him the bread and beer that come forth before Osiris-Wennofer
like the Followers of Horus." With his hand in that of Horus, Ani then
addresses Osiris: "Lo, I am before thee, Lord of the West. There is no
sin in my body. I have not spoken a lie knowingly nor (if so) was there
a second time. Let me be like the favorites who are in thy
following." <span id="fr_812"></span>[1](#fn_812) Thereupon he kneels
before the great god, and as he presents a table of offerings is
received into his kingdom.

These three accounts of the judgment, in spite of the grotesque
appurtenances with which the priests of the time have embellished them,
are not without impressiveness even to the modern beholder as he
contemplates these rolls of three thousand five hundred years ago, and
realizes that these scenes are the graphic expression of the same moral
consciousness, of the same admonishing voice within, to which we still
feel ourselves amenable. Ani

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

importunes his heart not to betray him, and his cry finds an echo down
all the ages in such words as those of Richard:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,  
 And every tongue brings in a several tale,  
 And every tale condemns me for a villain."</span>

</div>

The Egyptian heard the same voice, feared it, and endeavored to silence
it. He strove to still the voice of the heart; he did not yet confess,
but insistently maintained his innocence. The next step in his higher
development was humbly to disclose the consciousness of guilt to his
god. That step he later took. But another force intervened and greatly
hampered the complete emancipation of his conscience. There can be no
doubt that this Osirian judgment thus graphically portrayed and the
universal reverence for Osiris in the Empire had much to do with
spreading the belief in moral responsibility beyond the grave, and in
giving general currency to those ideas of the supreme value of moral
worthiness which we have seen among the moralists and social
philosophers of the Pharaoh's court several centuries earlier, in the
Feudal Age. The Osiris faith had thus become a great power for
righteousness *among the people*. While the Osirian destiny was open to
all, nevertheless all must prove themselves morally acceptable to him.

Had the priests left the matter thus, all would have been well.
Unhappily, however, the development of belief in the efficacy of magic
in the next world continued. All material blessings, as we have seen,
might infallibly be attained by the use of the proper charm. Even the
less tangible mental equipment, the "heart," meaning the understanding,
might also be restored by magical agencies.

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It was inevitable
that the priests should now take the momentous step of permitting such
agencies to enter also the world of moral values. Magic might become an
agent for moral ends. The Book of the Dead is chiefly a book of magical
charms, and the section pertaining to the judgment did not continue to
remain an exception. The poignant words addressed by Ani to his heart as
it was weighed in the balances, "O my heart, rise not up against me as a
witness," were now written upon a stone image of the sacred beetle, the
scarabeus, and placed over the heart as a mandate of magical potency
preventing the heart from betraying the character of the deceased. The
words of this charm became a chapter of the Book of the Dead, where they
bore the title, "Chapter of Preventing that the Heart of a Man Oppose
Him in the Nether World." <span id="fr_813"></span>[1](#fn_813) The
scenes of the judgment and the text of the Declaration of Innocence were
multiplied on rolls by the scribes and sold to all the people. In these
copies the places for the name of the deceased were left vacant, and the
purchaser filled in the blanks after he had secured the document. The
words of the verdict, declaring the deceased had successfully met the
judgment and acquitting him of evil, were not lacking in any of these
rolls. Any citizen whatever the character of his life might thus secure
from the scribes a certificate declaring that Blank was a righteous man
before it was known who Blank would be. He might even obtain a formulary
so mighty that the Sun-god, as the real power behind the judgment, would
be cast down from heaven into the Nile, if he did not bring forth the
deceased fully justified before his court. <span
id="fr_814"></span>[2](#fn_814) Thus the earliest moral development
which

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

we can trace in the ancient East was suddenly arrested, or at least
seriously checked, by the detestable devices of a corrupt priesthood
eager for gain.

It is needless to point out the confusion of distinctions involved in
this last application of magic. It is the old failure to perceive the
difference between that which goeth in and that which cometh out of the
man. A justification mechanically applied from without, and freeing the
man from punishments coming from without, cannot, of course, heal the
ravages that have taken place within. The voice within, to which the
Egyptian was more sensitive than any people of the earlier East, and to
which the whole idea of the moral ordeal in the hereafter was due, could
not be quieted by any such means. The general reliance upon such devices
for escaping ultimate responsibility for an unworthy life must have
seriously poisoned the life of the people. While the Book of the Dead
discloses to us more fully than ever before in the history of Egypt the
character of the moral judgment in the hereafter, and the reality with
which the Egyptian clothed his conception of moral responsibility, it is
likewise a revelation of ethical decadence. In so far as the Book of the
Dead had become a magical agency for securing moral vindication in the
hereafter, irrespective of character, it had become a positive force for
evil.

So strong was the moral sense of the Egyptian, now-ever, that he did not
limit the value of a worthy life to its availability in rendering him
acceptable to Osiris in the next life. Herein lies the limitation of the
Osirian ethics which bade a man think only of moral consequences beyond
the grave. After all, Osiris was a god of the dead. The old social
philosophers of the Feudal Age had preached the righteousness of Re, the
Sun-god, and

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

demanded social justice *here* because Re demanded it. They were not
without their descendants in the Empire—men who found in the Solar faith
an obligation to righteous living here and now, and who discerned
earthly rewards in so living. The Sun-god was not chiefly a god of the
dead. He reigned in the earthly affairs of men, and during the earthly
life men felt the moral obligation which he placed upon them hourly. One
of the architects of Amenhotep III, addressing a hymn of praise to the
Sun-god, says: "I was a valiant leader among thy monuments, doing
righteousness for thy heart. I know that thou art satisfied with
righteousness. Thou makest great him who doeth it on earth. I did it and
thou didst make me great." <span id="fr_815"></span>[1](#fn_815)
Similarly, when the Pharaoh made oath he swore, "As Re loves me, as my
father Amon (long since identified with Re) favors me;" <span
id="fr_816"></span>[2](#fn_816) and the conqueror Thutmose III in making
this oath to the truth of what he says, and affirming his respect for
the truth in the sight of his god, refers to the Sun-god's presence
thus: "For he knoweth heaven and he knoweth earth, he seeth the whole
earth hourly." <span id="fr_817"></span>[3](#fn_817) While it is true
that the subterranean hereafter of the Osiris faith depicts the Sun-god
as journeying from cavern to cavern beneath the earth, passing through
the realm of Osiris and bringing light and joy to the dead who dwell
there, this is a conception unknown to the early Solar theology as found
in the Pyramid Texts. <span id="fr_818"></span>[4](#fn_818) In the
Empire the Sun-god is preeminently a god of the world of living men, in
whose affairs

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

he is constantly present and active. Men feel their responsibility to
him here and now, and that dominion deepening constantly in the hearts
of men is now also to expand with the expanding horizon of the imperial
age until, for the first time in history, there dawns upon the eyes of
these early Nile-dwellers the vision of the world-god.

have been what its name technically defines it to have been. It means
"the act of making glorious," and, as we have seen above, one of the
epithets applied to the dead was "the glorious." It was therefore a
ceremony for accomplishing the transformation of the deceased into a
"glorious one," precisely as he was transformed also into a "soul" (ba)
by an analogous ceremony performed by the living, a ceremony indeed
which may have been much the same as that of glorification.

as a class are sometimes designated as the Book of the Dead. As about
half of them are taken from the Pyramid Texts, and the Pyramid Texts are
sharply distinguished from the Book of the Dead (the former for the use
of the king originally, the latter for universal use), it would seem not
only incorrect, but also the obliteration of a useful distinction to
term these Middle Kingdom texts the Book of the Dead. Hence I have for
convenience termed them Coffin Texts, a designation drawn from the place
in which they are found, and thus parallel with the Pyramid Texts. These
Coffin Texts have never been collected and published as a whole. A very
valuable collection taken from the coffins in the Cairo Museum has been
made and published by <span class="smallcaps">Lacau</span>, *Textes

published the material in the Berlin collection (<span

<span id="fn_732"></span>[276:1](rtae12.htm#fr_732) The word which I
have rendered "Ascending" is commonly rendered "going forth." A study of
the use of the word (pr·t) in mortuary texts shows clearly that it means
to ascend. The following are some decisive examples of its use in the
Pyramid Texts: of the rising of the sun (§§ 743 b, 800 a, 812 c, 919 a,
923 c, 971 e); of the rising of a star (§§ 871 b, 877 c) (compare the
"Rising of Sothis"); of the ascent of a bird to the sky (§ 913 a); with
the words "to the sky" added, not infrequently (*e.g.*, § 922 a); on a
ladder (§§ 974–5); in opposed parallelism with "descend" (§§ 821 b–c,
867 a, 922 a, 927 b). There is indeed in the Coffin Texts a "Chapter of
Ascending (pr·t) to the Sky to the Place where Re is" (*Rec*. 26, 225).
These examples might be increased *ad infinitum*, and there can be no
question regarding the rendering "Ascending."

class="smallcaps">Lepsius</span>, *Denkmaeler*, II, 126–7; <span
class="smallcaps">Newberry</span>, *Benihasan*, I, pl. xxix, also p. 68,
where both scenes are stated to depict the voyage *to* Abydos. It is
clear, both from the inscriptions ("voyage up-stream" and return") and
from the scenes themselves, that the voyage *to* <span id="page_287">p.
287</span> *Abydos and return* are depicted. The vessel going up-stream
shows canvas set as it should for sailing up-stream, while the other
(the "return") shows the mast unstepped, as customary in coming
downstream at the present day. *Moreover, both boats actually face to
and from Abydos as they now stand on the tomb wall*. This device is not
unknown elsewhere, *e.g.*, the ships of Hatshepsut, on the walls of the
Der el-Bahri temple, face to and from Punt (BAR, II, 251 and p. 105).

<span id="fn_775"></span>[287:1](rtae12.htm#fr_775) The word employed
(ḫr·t) is one of the widest latitude in meaning. Its original meaning is
"that which belongs to" (a thing or person), then his "being, state,
concerns, needs," and the like.

carefully by <span class="smallcaps">Schaefer</span>, *Die Mysterien des

<span id="fn_777"></span>[291:1](rtae12.htm#fr_777) Berlin Papyrus, P

Empire, about the sixteenth or <span id="page_292">p. 292</span>
seventeenth century B.C. Published by <span

Papyrus of Ani, pl. xv, chap. XXIX.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[293:1](rtae12.htm#fr_780) See Papyrus of Ani.,
pl. v, ll. 2–3, where the title of the section includes the words,
"things said on the day of burial."

<span id="fn_781"></span>[293:2](rtae12.htm#fr_781) The designation was
first employed by <span class="smallcaps">Lepsius</span>, who, however,
realized that these rolls were not fixed and constant in content. See
his *Todtenbuch* (p. 4), which was the earliest publication of so large
a roll. The Theban Book of the Dead has been published by <span
class="smallcaps">Naville</span>, *Das aegyptische Todtenbuch*, Berlin,
1886. Many individual rolls are now accessible in published form,
notably that of Ani (see below, p. 304). No translation fully
representing modern knowledge of the language exists. The best are those
of <span class="smallcaps">Budge</span> and of <span
class="smallcaps">Le Page-Renouf</span>, continued by <span
class="smallcaps">Naville</span>.

<span id="fn_782"></span>[294:1](rtae12.htm#fr_782) Later, especially in
the Saitic Age, they were revived.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[295:1](rtae12.htm#fr_783) Book of the Dead,
chap. CIX.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[295:2](rtae12.htm#fr_784) The word used is
that commonly rendered "Ushebti," and translated "respondent." It is,
however, of very obscure origin and of uncertain meaning.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[295:3](rtae12.htm#fr_785) Book of the Dead,
chap. VI.

<span id="fn_786"></span>[296:1](rtae12.htm#fr_786) The designation
"Bible of the old Egyptians" is at least as old as the report of the
Committee of the Oriental Congress, which sat in London in 1874 and
arranged for publishing the Book of the Dead. See <span
class="smallcaps">Naville</span>, *Todtenbuch*, Einleitung, p. 5.

the seat of the mind.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[299:1](rtae12.htm#fr_795) It is commonly known
as chap. CXXV.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[299:2](rtae12.htm#fr_796) The word "truth"
here is commonly written in the dual, which grammatically equals "the
two truths." This strange usage is perhaps merely an idiom of
intensification, as "morning" is written in the dual for "early
morning."

<span id="fn_797"></span>[299:3](rtae12.htm#fr_797) I the dual as above,
and for the most part throughout this chapter.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[299:4](rtae12.htm#fr_798) An important variant
has, "Who live on righteousness (truth) and abominate sin." Some texts
also insert here the name of Osiris, "Lo, the 'two beloved daughters,
his two eyes of Truth' is thy name."

<span id="fn_799"></span>[300:1](rtae12.htm#fr_799) A measure of length.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[300:2](rtae12.htm#fr_800) This refers to
diverting the waters of the irrigation canals at time of inundation at
the expense of neighbors, still one of the commonest forms of corruption
in Egypt.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[300:3](rtae12.htm#fr_801) The text is clear,
but the meaning is quite obscure.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[302:1](rtae12.htm#fr_803) The variants
indicate "I did not ⌈take possession⌉ of my (own) property," or "I did
not take ⌈possession⌉ except of just (or true) possessions."

<span id="fn_805"></span>[303:2](rtae12.htm#fr_805) It should be noted
that this is another evidence of the Solar origin of this court.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[303:3](rtae12.htm#fr_806) A hostile demon of

<span id="fn_809"></span>[304:3](rtae12.htm#fr_809) The number has been

Nephthys are placed together and counted as one.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[310:4](rtae12.htm#fr_818) It is not likely
that the "caves" referred to in Pyr. § 852 have any connection with the
subterranean caverns of the Osirian faith.
