### LECTURE IX

#### THE IMPERIAL AGE—THE WORLD-STATE MAKES ITS IMPRESSION ON RELIGION—TRIUMPH OF RE—EARLIEST MONOTHEISM—IKHNATON (AMENHOTEP IV)

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the Feudal Age the *social* realm had
made its impression upon religion as in the Pyramid Age the Egyptian
state, the *political* realm had done. Both these were limited to the
territory of Egypt. The Pyramid Age had gained a dim vision of the vast
extent of the Sun-god's domain, and had once addressed him by the
sounding title "Limitless." <span id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_819) But
this remained, as it were, a momentary glimpse without effect upon the
Solar theology as a whole. The Sun-god ruled only Egypt, and in the
great Sun-hymn of the Pyramid Texts <span
id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_820) he stands guardian on the Egyptian
frontiers, where he builds the gates which restrain all outsiders from
entering his inviolable domain. In the Pyramid Age, too, the Sun-god had
already begun the process of absorbing the other gods of Egypt, a
process resulting even at so remote a date in a form of national
pantheism, in which all the gods ultimately coalesced into forms and
functions of one. But even this process, though it did not cease, had
left the supreme god's dominion still restricted to Egypt. He was very
far from being a world-god. The Egyptians indeed had not as yet gained
the world-idea, the world-empire over which they might install the
world-ruler. The influences of an environment restricted to the limits

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

of the Nile valley had now, however, gone as far as they could, when a
career of imposing foreign expansion of national power enlarged the
theatre of thought and action. The Solar theology had been sensitively
responsive to conditions in the Nile-valley world. It proved to be not
less sensitive to the larger world, to include which the Egyptian
horizon had now expanded.

Egypt's imperial expansion northward and southward until the Pharaoh's
power had united the contiguous regions of Asia and Africa into the
first stable Empire in history is the commanding fact in the history of
the East in the sixteenth century B.C. The consolidation of that power
by Thutmose III's twenty years’ campaigning in Asia is a stirring
chapter of military imperialism in which for the first time in the East
we can discern the skilfully organized and mobile forces of a great
state as they are brought to bear with incessant impact upon the nations
of western Asia, until the Egyptian supremacy is undisputed from the
Greek Islands, the coasts of Asia Minor, and the highlands of the Upper
Euphrates on the north to the Fourth Cataract of the Nile on the south.
This great military leader himself made the remark which we have quoted
above regarding his god: "He seeth the whole earth hourly." If this was
true it was because the sword of the Pharaoh had carried the power of
Egypt's god to the limit of Egypt's Empire. <span
id="fr_821"></span>[1](#fn_821) Fifty years earlier, indeed, Thutmose I
proclaimed his kingdom as far as "the circuit of the sun." <span
id="fr_822"></span>[2](#fn_822) In the Old Kingdom the Sun-god was
conceived as a Pharaoh, whose kingdom was Egypt. With the expansion of
the Egyptian kingdom into a world-empire it was inevitable that the
domain of the god

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

should likewise expand. As the kingdom had long since found expression
in religion, so now the Empire was a powerful influence upon religious
thought.

While this was a more or less mechanical and unconscious process, it was
accompanied by an intellectual awakening which shook the old Egyptian
traditions to the foundations and set the men of the age to thinking in
a larger world. Thutmose III was the first character of universal
aspects, the first world-hero. As such he made a profound impression
upon his age. The idea of universal power, of a world-empire, was
visibly and tangibly bodied forth in his career. There is a touch of
universalism now discernible in the theology of the Empire which is
directly due to such impressions as he and his successors made. Egypt is
forced out of the immemorial isolation of her narrow valley into
world-relations, with which the theology of the time must
reckon—relations with which the Sun-god, as we have seen, was
inextricably involved. Commercial connections, maintained from an
immemorially remote past, had not sufficed to bring the great world
without into the purview of Egyptian thinking. The limits of the
dominion of the Egyptian gods had been fixed as the outer fringes of the
Nile valley long before the outside world was familiar to the
Nile-dwellers; and merely commercial intercourse with a larger world had
not been able to shake the tradition. Many a merchant had seen a stone
fall in distant Babylon and in Thebes alike, but it had not occurred to
him, or to any man in that far-off age, that the same natural force
reigned in these widely separated countries. The world was far indeed
from the lad lying beneath the apple-tree and discovering a universal
force in the fall of an apple. Many a merchant of that day, too, had
seen the sun rise

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

behind the Babylonian ziggurats as it did among the clustered obelisks
of Thebes, but the thought of the age had not yet come to terms with
such far-reaching facts as these. It was universalism expressed in terms
of imperial power which first caught the imagination of the thinking men
of the Empire, and disclosed to them the universal sweep of the
Sun-god's dominion as a physical fact. Monotheism is but imperialism in
religion.

It is no accident, therefore, that about 1400 B.C., in the reign of
Amenhotep III, the most splendid of the Egyptian emperors, we find the
first of such impressions. Two architects, Suti and Hor, twin brothers,
whom Amenhotep III was employing at Thebes, have left us a Sun-hymn on a
stela now in the British Museum, <span id="fr_823"></span>[1](#fn_823)
which discloses the tendency of the age and the widening vision with
which these men of the Empire were looking out upon the world and
discerning the unlimited scope of the Sun-god's realm.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Cold when he desires.  
He makes the limbs to languish  
When he enfolds them,  
Every land is in rejoicing  
At his rising every day, in order to praise him."</span>

</div>

It is evident in such a hymn as this that the vast sweep of the
Sun-god's course over all the lands and peoples of the earth has at last
found consideration, and the logical conclusion has also followed. The
old stock phrases of the earlier hymns, the traditional references to
the falcon, and the mythological allusions involved have not wholly
disappeared, but the momentous step has been taken of extending the sway
of the Sun-god over all lands and peoples. No earlier document left us
by the thought of Egypt contains such unequivocal expression of this
thought as we find here:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Sole lord, taking captive all lands every day,  
 As one beholding them that walk therein."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is important to
observe also that this tendency is connected directly with the social
movement of the Feudal Age. Such epithets applied to the Sun-god as

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Valiant herdman who drives his cattle,  
 Their refuge and the giver of their sustenance,"</span>

</div>

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

of course carry us back to the address of Ipuwer and his "shepherd of
all men." <span id="fr_826"></span>[1](#fn_826) The other remarkable
epithet,

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"A mother, profitable to gods and men,"</span>

</div>

carries with it the idea of similar solicitude for mankind. The humane
aspects of the Sun-god's sway, to which the social thinkers of the
Feudal Age chiefly contributed, have not disappeared among the powerful
political motives of this new universalism.

This hymn of the two architects is, however, likewise a revelation of
one of the chief difficulties in the internal situation of the Pharaoh
at this time. The hymn bears the title: "Adoration of Amon when he rises
as Harakhte (Horus of the Horizon)"; that is to say, the hymn is
addressed to Amon as Sun-god. Amon, the old obscure local god of Thebes,
whose name is not to be found in the great religious documents of the
earlier age like the Pyramid Texts, <span
id="fr_827"></span>[2](#fn_827) had by this time gained the chief place
in the state theology, owing to the supreme position held by the ruling
family of his native town in the Empire. Theologically, he had long
succumbed to the ancient tendency which identified the old local gods
with the Sun-god, and he had long been called "Amon-Ile." His old local
characteristics, whatever they may have been, had been supplanted by
those of the Sun-god, and the ancient local Amon had been completely
Solarized. In this way it had been possible to raise him to the supreme
place in the pantheon. At the same time this supremacy was

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

not confined to theological theory. Economically and administratively,
Amon actually received the first place among the gods. For the first
time in the history of the country the great organizer, Thutmose III,
seems to have merged the priesthoods of all the temples of the land into
one great sacerdotal organization, at the head of which he placed the
High Priest of Amon. <span id="fr_828"></span>[1](#fn_828) This is the
earliest national priesthood as yet known in the early East, and the
first *pontifex maximus*. This Amonite papacy constituted a powerful
political obstacle in the way of realizing the supremacy of the ancient
Sun-god.

When Amenhotep III's son, Amenhotep IV, succeeded his father, about 1375
B.C., a keen struggle arose between the royal house, on the one hand,
and the sacerdotal organization dominated by Amon, on the other. It is
evident that the young king favored the claims of the old Sun-god as
opposed to those of Amon, but early in his reign we find him ardently
supporting a new form of the old Solar faith, which may have been the
result of a compromise between the two. At a time when the Asiatic
situation was exceedingly critical, and the Pharaoh's supremacy there
was threatened, he devoted himself with absorbing zeal to the new Solar
universalism which we have discerned under his father. The Sun-god was
given a designation which freed the new faith from the compromising
polytheistic tradition of the old Solar theology. He was now called
"Aton," an ancient name for the physical sun, and probably designating
his disk. It occurs

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

twice in the hymn of the two architects of Amenhotep III, translated
above, and it had already gained some favor under this king, who named
one of his royal barges "Aton-Gleams." <span
id="fr_829"></span>[1](#fn_829) There was an effort made to make the
name "Aton" equivalent in some of the old forms to the word "god"; thus
the traditional term "divine offering" (lit. "god's offering") was now
called "Aton offering." <span id="fr_830"></span>[2](#fn_830) Not only
did the Sun-god receive a new name, but the young king now gave him a
new symbol also. The most ancient symbol of the Sun-god, as we have
seen, was a pyramid, and as a falcon the figure of that bird was also
used to designate him. These, however, were intelligible only in Egypt,
and Amenhotep IV had a wider arena in view. The new symbol depicted the
sun as a disk from which diverging beams radiated downward, each ray
terminating in a human hand. It was a masterly symbol, suggesting a
power issuing from its celestial source, and putting its hand upon the
world and the affairs of men. As far back as the Pyramid Texts the rays
of the Sun-god had been likened to his arms and had been conceived as an
agency on earth: "The arm of the sunbeams is lifted with king
Unis," <span id="fr_831"></span>[3](#fn_831) raising him to the skies.
Such a symbol was suited to be understood throughout the world which the
Pharaoh controlled. There was also some effort to define the Solar power
thus symbolized. The full name of the Sun-god was "Harakhte
(Horizon-Horus), rejoicing in the horizon in his name 'Heat which is in
Aton.'" It was enclosed in two royal cartouches, like the double name of
the Pharaoh, a device suggested by the analogy of the Pharaoh's power,
and another clear evidence of the impression which the Empire as a state
had now made on

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

the Solar theology. But the name enclosed in the cartouches roughly
defined the actual physical force of the sun in the visible world, and
was no political figure. The word rendered "heat" sometimes also means
"light." It is evident that what the king was deifying was the force by
which the Sun made himself felt on earth. In harmony with this
conclusion are the numerous statements in the Aton hymns, which, as we
shall see, represent Aton as everywhere active on earth by means of his
"rays." While it is evident that the new faith drew its inspiration from
Heliopolis, so that the king assuming the office of High Priest of Aton
called himself "Great Seer," the title of the High Priest of Heliopolis,
nevertheless most of the old lumber which made up the externals of the
traditional theology was rejected. We look in vain for the sun-barques,
and in the same way also later accretions, like the voyage through the
subterranean caverns of the dead, are completely shorn away. <span
id="fr_832"></span>[1](#fn_832)

To introduce the Aton faith into Thebes, Amenhotep IV erected there a
sumptuous temple of the new god, which, of course, received liberal
endowments from the royal treasury. If the Aton movement was intended as
a compromise with the priests of Amon, it failed. The bitterest enmities
soon broke out, culminating finally in the determination on the king's
part to make Aton sole god of the Empire and to annihilate Amon. The
effort to obliterate all trace of the existence of the upstart Amon
resulted in the most extreme measures. The king changed his own name
from "Amenhotep" ("Amen rests" [or](errata.htm#7) "is satisfied")

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

to "Ikhnaton," which means "Aton is satisfied," and is a translation of
the king's old name into a corresponding idea in the Aton faith. <span
id="fr_833"></span>[1](#fn_833) The name of Amon, wherever it occurred
on the great monuments of Thebes, was expunged, and in doing so not even
the name of the king's father, Amenhotep III, was respected. These
erasures were not confined to the name of Amon. Even the word "gods" as
a compromising plural was expunged wherever found, and the names of the
other gods, too, were treated like that of Amon. <span
id="fr_834"></span>[2](#fn_834)

Finding Thebes embarrassed with too many theological traditions, in
spite of its prestige and its splendor, Ikhnaton forsook it and built a
new capital about midway between Thebes and the sea, at a place now
commonly known as Tell el-Amarna. He called it Akhetaton, "Horizon of
Aton." The name of the Sun-god is the only divine name found in the
place, and it was evidently intended as a centre for the dissemination
of Solar monotheism. Here several sanctuaries <span
id="fr_835"></span>[3](#fn_835) of Aton were erected, and in the
boundary landmarks, imposing stelæ which the king set up in the eastern
and western cliffs, the place was formally devoted to his exclusive
service. A similar Aton city was founded in Nubia, and in all likelihood
there was another in Asia. The three great portions of the Empire,
Egypt, Nubia, and Syria, were thus each given a centre

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

of the Aton faith. Besides these sanctuaries of Aton were also built at
various other places in Egypt. <span id="fr_836"></span>[1](#fn_836)

This was, of course, not accomplished without building up a powerful
court party, which the king could oppose, to the evicted priesthoods,
especially that of Amon. The resulting convulsion undoubtedly affected
seriously the power of the royal house. The life of this court party,
which now unfolded at Akhetaton, centred about the propagation of the
new faith, and as preserved to us in the wall reliefs which fill the
chapels of the cliff tombs, excavated by the king for his nobles in the
face of the low cliffs of the eastern plateau behind the new city, it
forms, perhaps, the most interesting and picturesque chapter in the
story of the early East. <span id="fr_837"></span>[2](#fn_837) It is to
the tombs of these partisans of the king that we owe our knowledge of
the content of the remarkable teaching which he was now propagating.
They contain a series of hymns in praise of the Sun-god, or of the
Sun-god and the king alternately, which afford us at least a glimpse
into the new world of thought, in which we behold this young king and
his

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

associates lifting up their eyes and endeavoring to discern God in the
illimitable sweep of his power—God no longer of the Nile valley only,
but of all men and of all the world. We can do no better at this
juncture than to let these hymns speak for themselves. The longest and
most important is as follows: <span id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_838)

This great royal hymn doubtless represents an excerpt, or a series of
fragments excerpted, from the ritual of Aton, as it was celebrated from
day to day in the Aton temple at Amarna. Unhappily, it was copied in the
cemetery in but one tomb, where about a third of it has perished by the
vandalism of the modern natives, leaving us for the lost portion only a
very inaccurate and hasty modern copy of thirty years ago (1883). The
other tombs were supplied, with their devotional inscriptions, from the
current paragraphs and stock phrases which made up the knowledge of the
Aton faith as understood by the scribes and painters who decorated these
tombs. It should not be forgotten, therefore, that the fragments of the
Aton faith which have survived to us in the Amarna cemetery, our chief
source, have thus filtered mechanically through the indifferent hands,
and the starved and listless minds of a few petty bureaucrats on the
outskirts of a great religious and intellectual movement. Apart from the
Royal Hymn, they were elsewhere content with bits and snatches copied in
some cases from the Royal Hymn itself, or other fragments patched
together in the form of a shorter hymn, which they then slavishly copied
in whole or in part from tomb to tomb. Where the materials are so
meagre, and the movement revealed so momentous, even the few new
contributions furnished by the short hymn are of great value. <span
id="fr_844"></span>[1](#fn_844) In four cases the hymn is attributed to
the king himself; that is, he is represented as reciting it to Aton. The
lines are as follows:

"Thy rising is beautiful, O living Aton, lord of Eternity;  
 Thou art shining, beautiful, strong;  
 Thy love is great and mighty,  
 Thy rays ⌈are cast⌉ into every face.

 When thou hast filled the Two Lands with thy love.  
 O God who himself fashioned himself, Maker of every land,  
 Creator of that which is upon it:  
 Men, all cattle large and small,

 They live when thou dawnest for them,  
 Thou art the mother and the father of all that thou hast made.  
 As for their eyes, when thou dawnest,

 And every heart rejoices because of seeing thee,  
 When thou dawnest as their lord.

"When thou settest in the western horizon of the sky,

 Their heads are wrapped up,  
 Their nostrils are stopped,  
 Until thy rising comes in the morning,

</div>

In these hymns there is an inspiring universalism not found before in
the religion of Egypt. It is world wide in its sweep. The king claims
that the recognition of the Sun-god's universal supremacy is also
universal, and that all men acknowledge his dominion. On the great
boundary stela likewise he says of them, that Aton made them "for his
own self; all lands, the Ægæans bear their dues, their tribute is upon
their backs, for him who made their life, him by whose rays men live and
breathe the air." <span id="fr_848"></span>[3](#fn_848)

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is clear that
he was projecting a world religion, and endeavoring to displace by it
the nationalism which had preceded it for twenty centuries.

Along with this universal power, Ikhnaton is also deeply impressed with
the eternal duration of his god; and although he himself calmly accepts
his own mortality and early in his career at Amarna makes public and
permanently records on the boundary stelæ instructions for his own
burial, nevertheless he relies upon his intimate relation with Aton to
insure him something of the Sun-god's duration. His official titulary
always contains the epithet after his name, "whose lifetime (or
duration) is long."

But in the beginning of all, Aton called himself forth out of the
eternal solitude, the author of his own being. The king calls him "My
rampart of a million cubits, my reminder of eternity, my witness of the
things of eternity, who himself fashioned himself with his own hands,
whom no artificer knew." <span id="fr_849"></span>[1](#fn_849) In
harmony with this idea, the hymns love to reiterate the fact that the
creation of the world which followed was done while the god was y*et
al*one. The words "while thou wert alone" are almost a refrain in these
hymns. He is the universal creator who brought forth all the races of
man and distinguished them in speech and in color of the skin. His
creative power still goes on calling forth life, even from the inanimate
egg. Nowhere do we find more marked the naïve wonder of the king at the
Sun-god's life-giving power than in this marvel, that within the
egg-shell, which the king calls the "stone" of the egg—within this
lifeless stone, the sounds of life respond to the command of Aton, and,
nourished by the breath which he gives, a living creature issues forth.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

This life-giving power is the constant source of life and sustenance,
and its immediate agency is the rays of the Sun. It is in these rays
that Aton is present on earth as a beneficent power. Thus manifested,
the hymns love to dwell upon his ever-present universal power. "Thou art
in the sky, but thy rays are on earth;" "Though thou art far away, thy
rays are on earth;" "Thy rays are in the midst of the great green sea;"
"Thy rays are on thy beloved son;" "He who makes whole the eyes by his
rays;" "It is the breath of life in the nostrils to behold thy rays;"
"Thy child (the king), who came forth from thy rays;" "Thou didst
fashion him (the king) out of thine own rays;" "Thy rays carry a million
royal jubilees;" "When thou sendest forth thy rays, the Two Lands are in
festivity;" "Thy rays embrace the lands, even all that thou hast
made;" <span id="fr_850"></span>[1](#fn_850) "Whether he is in the sky
or on earth, all eyes behold him without \[ceasing\]; he fills \[every
land\] with his rays, and makes all men to live; with beholding whom may
my eyes be satisfied daily, when he dawns in this house of Aton and
fills it with his own self by his beams, beauteous in love, and lays
them upon me in satisfying life for ever and ever." <span
id="fr_851"></span>[2](#fn_851) In these last words the king himself
expresses his own consciousness of the god's presence, especially in the
temple, by his rays. The obvious dependence of Egypt upon the Nile made
it impossible to ignore this agency of life, and there is nothing which
discloses more clearly the surprising rationalism of Ikhnaton than the
fact that he strips off without hesitation the venerable body of myth
and tradition which deified the Nile as Osiris, and attributes the
inundation to natural forces controlled by his god, who

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

in like solicitude for other lands has made a Nile for them in the sky.

It is this recognition of the fatherly solicitude of Aton for all
creatures which lifts the movement of Ikhnaton far above all that had
before been attained in the religion of Egypt or of the whole East
before this time. "Thou art the father and the mother of all that thou
hast made" is a thought which anticipates much of the later development
in religion even down to our own time. The picture of the lily-grown
marshes, where the flowers are "drunken" in the intoxicating radiance of
Aton, where the birds unfold their wings and lift them "in adoration of
the living Aton," where the cattle dance with delight in the sunshine,
and the fish in the river beyond leap up to greet the light, the
universal light whose beams are even "in the midst of the great green
sea"—all this discloses a discernment of the presence of God in nature,
and an appreciation of the revelation of God in the visible world such
as we find a thousand years later in the Hebrew psalms, and in our own
poets of nature since Wordsworth.

It is evident that, in spite of the political origin of this movement,
the deepest sources of power in this remarkable revolution lay in this
appeal to nature, in this admonition to "consider the lilies of the
field." Ikhnaton was a "God-intoxicated man," whose mind responded with
marvellous sensitiveness and discernment to the visible evidences of God
about him. He was fairly ecstatic in his sense of the beauty of the
eternal and universal light. Its beams enfold him on every monument of
his which has survived. He prays, "May my eyes be satisfied daily with
beholding him, when he dawns in this house of Aton and fills it with his
own self by his beams, beauteous in love, and lays them upon me in
satisfying

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

life for ever and ever." In this light—which more than once, as here, he
identifies with love, or again with beauty, as the visible evidence of
the presence of God—he revels with an intoxication rarely to be found,
and which may be properly compared to the ecstatic joy felt by such a
soul as Ruskin in the contemplation of light. Ruskin, as he sees it
playing over some lovely landscape, calls it "the breathing, animated,
exulting light, which feels and receives and rejoices and acts—which
chooses one thing and rejects another—which seeks and finds and loses
again—leaping from rock to rock, from leaf to leaf, from wave to wave,
glowing or flashing or scintillating according to what it strikes, or in
its holier moods absorbing and enfolding all things in the deep fulness
of its repose, and then again losing itself in bewilderment and doubt
and dimness, or perishing and passing away, entangled in drifting mist,
or melted into melancholy air, but still—kindling or declining,
sparkling or still—it is the living light, which breathes in its
deepest, most entranced rest, which sleeps but never dies." <span
id="fr_852"></span>[1](#fn_852) That is the loftiest modern
interpretation of light, a veritable gospel of the beauty of light, of
which the earliest disciple was this lonely idealist of the fourteenth
century before Christ. To Ikhnaton, too, the eternal light might sleep,
when he that made the world has "gone to rest in his horizon," but to
him also as with Ruskin it "sleeps but never dies."

In this aspect of Ikhnaton's movement, then, it is a gospel of the
beauty and beneficence of the natural order, a recognition of the
message of nature to the soul of man, which makes it the earliest of
those revivals which we call in the case of such artists as Millet and
the Barbizon school, or of Wordsworth and his successors, "a return to

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

nature." As the earliest of such movements known to us, however, we
cannot call it a "return." We should not forget also that this
intellectual attitude of the king was not confined to religion. The
breath of nature had also touched life and art at the same time, and
quickened them with a new vision as broad and untrammelled as that which
is unfolded in the hymns. The king's charmingly natural and unrestrained
relations with his family, depicted on public monuments without reserve,
is another example of his powerful individuality and his readiness to
throw off the shackles of tradition without hesitation in . the endeavor
to establish a world of things as they are, in wholesome naturalness.
The artists of the time, one of them indeed, as he says, under the
king's own instructions, put forth works dominated by the same spirit.
Especially do they reflect to us that joy in nature which breathes in
the religion of Ikhnaton. We have come to speak habitually of an Amarna
age, in religion, in life, in art, and this fact of itself is conclusive
evidence of the distinctive intellectual attitude of Ikhnaton.

It is remarkable that the hymns as an expression of religious aspiration
contain so little reference to character and to ethical matters. We have
seen that the Solar theology was closely identified from the beginning
with the development of the moral consciousness in Egypt. Recognizing as
it does more clearly than ever was done before the beneficent goodness
of the Sun-god's sway, it is inconceivable that the Amarna movement
should have rejected the highly developed ethics of Heliopolis. Its
close connection with the Heliopolitan theology is evident throughout.
The identification of the royal line with that of the Sun-god by the
Heliopolitan priests in the Pyramid Age had resulted, as we have seen,
in transferring

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

to Re the humane qualities of beneficent dominion with which the
Pharaohs of the Feudal Age were imbued. The Pharaoh was the "good
shepherd" or "good herdman," and this figure of the paternal and
protecting sovereign had been transferred to Re. Re had thus gained
wondrously in qualities of humane and paternal sympathy, as a result of
this development in the conception of the kingship in the Feudal Age.
The social forces which had contributed this high ideal of kingship were
thus the ultimate influences, which, through the kingship, enriched and
humanized the otherwise rather mechanical and perfunctory political
conception of Re's dominion. The human appeal which he now made was thus
akin to that of Osiris himself. This tendency of the Solar faith was
entirely in sympathy with the teaching of Ikhnaton. Under his father we
have found a Sun-hymn calling the Sun-god "the valiant herdman driving
his herds," a hint clearly connecting the Aton faith with the social and
moral movement of the Feudal Age, which we have just recalled.
Nevertheless it is evident that it was the beneficence and beauty rather
than the righteousness of the Sun-god, on which Ikhnaton loved to dwell,
in the hymns to his god. Outside of the hymns, however, there is a
marked prominence of the ancient word "truth," or, as we have observed
so often, "justice" or "righteousness." To the official name of the
king, there is regularly appended the epithet, "living in truth," <span
id="fr_853"></span>[1](#fn_853) and although it is difficult

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

to interpret the phrase exactly, it is evident that the conception of
Truth and Right, personified as a goddess, the daughter of the Sun-god
at a remote age, occupied a prominent place in the Aton movement, and
not least in the personal faith of the king. The new capital was called
the "seat of truth" in the short hymn, and we frequently find the men of
Ikhnaton's court glorifying truth. One of his leading partisans, Eye,
says: "He (the king) put truth in my body and my abomination is lying. I
know that Wanre (Ikhnaton) rejoices in it (truth)." <span
id="fr_854"></span>[1](#fn_854) The same man affirms that the Sun-god is
one "(whose) heart is satisfied with truth, whose abomination is
falsehood." <span id="fr_855"></span>[2](#fn_855) Another official
states in his Amarna tomb: "I will speak truth to his majesty, (for) I
know that he lives therein. . . . I do not that which his majesty hates,
(for) my abomination is lying in my body. . . . I have reported truth to
his majesty, (for) I know that he lives therein. Thou art Re, begetter
of truth. . . . I took not the reward of lying, nor expelled the truth
for the violent." <span id="fr_856"></span>[3](#fn_856) Re was still the
author of truth or righteousness at Amarna as before, and if we hear of
no judgment hereafter in the Amarna tombs, it was clearly only the
rejection of the cloud of gods and demi-gods, with Osiris at their head,
who had been involved in the judgment as we find it in the Book of the
Dead. These were now banished, and the dramatic scene of the judgment
seems to have disappeared with them, although it is clear that the
ethical requirements of the Solar faith, the faith in which they emerged
and developed, were not relaxed in Ikhnaton's

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

teaching. The sacerdotal invasion of the moral realm with mechanical
magical agencies for insuring justification was also evidently repelled
by Ikhnaton. The familiar heart scarab now no longer bears a charm to
still the accusing voice of conscience, but a simple prayer, in the name
of Aton, for long life, favor, and food. <span
id="fr_857"></span>[1](#fn_857)

Such fundamental changes as these, on a moment's reflection, suggest
what an overwhelming tide of inherited thought, custom, and tradition
had been diverted from its channel by the young king who was guiding
this revolution. It is only as this aspect of his movement is clearly
discerned that we begin to appreciate the power of his remarkable
personality. Before his time religious documents were usually attributed
to ancient kings and wise men, and the power of a belief lay chiefly in
its claim to remote antiquity and the sanctity of immemorial custom.
Even the social prophets of the Feudal Age attribute the maxims of
Ptahhotep to a vizier of the Old Kingdom, five or six centuries earlier.
Until Ikhnaton the history of the world had been but the irresistible
drift of tradition. All men had been but drops of water in the great
current. Ikhnaton was the first individual in history. Consciously and
deliberately, by intellectual process he gained his position, and then
placed himself squarely in the face of tradition and swept it aside. He
appeals to no myths, to no ancient and widely accepted versions of the
dominion of the gods, to no customs sanctified by centuries—he appeals
only to the present and visible evidences of his god's dominion,
evidences open to all, and as for tradition, wherever it had left
material manifestations of any sort in records which could be reached,
he endeavored to annihilate

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

it. The new faith has but one name at Amarna. It is frequently called
the "teaching," and this "teaching" is attributed solely to the king.
There is no reason to question this attribution. But we should realize
what this "teaching" meant in the life of the Egyptian people as a
whole.

Here had been a great people, the onward flow of whose life, in spite of
its almost irresistible momentum, had been suddenly arrested and then
diverted into a strange channel. Their holy places had been desecrated,
the shrines sacred with the memories of thousands of years had been
closed up, the priests driven away, the offerings and temple incomes
confiscated, and the old order blotted out. Everywhere whole
communities, moved by instincts flowing from untold centuries of habit
and custom, returned to their holy places to find them no more, and
stood dumfounded before the closed doors of the ancient sanctuaries. On
feast days, sanctified by memories of earliest childhood, venerable
halls that had resounded with the rejoicings of the multitudes, as we
have recalled them at Siut, now stood silent and empty; and every day as
the funeral processions wound across the desert margin and up the
plateau to the cemetery, the great comforter and friend, Osiris, the
champion of the dead in every danger, was banished, and no man dared so
much as utter his name. <span id="fr_858"></span>[1](#fn_858) Even in
their oaths, absorbed from childhood with their mothers' milk, the
involuntary names must not

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

be suffered to escape the lips; and in the presence of the magistrate at
court the ancient oath must now contain only the name of Aton. All this
to them was as if the modern man were asked to worship X and swear by Y.
Groups of muttering priests, nursing implacable hatred, must have
mingled their curses with the execration of whole communities of
discontented tradesmen—bakers who no longer drew a livelihood from the
sale of ceremonial cakes at the temple feasts; craftsmen who no longer
sold amulets of the old gods at the temple gateway; hack sculptors whose
statues of Osiris lay under piles of dust in many a tumble-down studio;
cemetery stone-cutters who found their tawdry tombstones with scenes
from the Book of the Dead banished from the cemetery; scribes whose
rolls of the same book, filled with the names of the old gods, or even
if they bore the word god in the plural, were anathema; actors and
priestly mimes who were driven away from the sacred groves by gendarmes
on the days when they should have presented to the people the "passion
play," and murmuring groups of pilgrims at Abydos who would have taken
part in this drama of the life and death and resurrection of Osiris;
physicians deprived of their whole stock in trade of exorcising
ceremonies, employed with success since the days of the earliest kings,
two thousand years before; shepherds who no longer dared to place a loaf
and a jar of water under yonder tree and thus to escape the anger of the
goddess who dwelt in it, and who might afflict the household with
sickness in her wrath; peasants who feared to erect a rude image of
Osiris in the field to drive away the typhonic demons of drought and
famine; mothers soothing their babes at twilight and fearing to utter
the old sacred names and prayers learned in childhood,

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

to drive away from their little ones the lurking demons of the dark. In
the midst of a whole land thus darkened by clouds of smouldering
discontent, this marvellous young king, and the group of sympathizers
who surrounded him, set up their tabernacle to the daily light, in
serene unconsciousness of the fatal darkness that enveloped all around
and grew daily darker and more threatening.

In placing the movement of Ikhnaton against a background of popular
discontent like this, and adding to the picture also the far more
immediately dangerous secret opposition of the ancient priesthoods, the
still unconquered party of Amon, and the powerful military group, who
were disaffected by the king's peace policy in Asia and his lack of
interest in imperial administration and maintenance, we begin to discern
something of the powerful individuality of this first intellectual
leader in history. His reign was the earliest age of the rule of ideas,
irrespective of the condition and willingness of the people upon whom
they were to be forced. As Matthew Arnold has so well said, in
commenting on the French Revolution: "But the mania for giving an
immediate political application to all these fine ideas of the reason
was fatal. . . . Ideas cannot be too much prized in and for themselves,
cannot be too much lived with; but to transfer them abruptly into the
world of politics and practice, violently to revolutionize the world at
their bidding—that is quite another thing." But Ikhnaton had no French
Revolution to look back upon. He was himself the world's first
revolutionist, and he was fully convinced that he might entirely recast
the world of religion, thought, art, and life by the invincible purpose
he held, to make his ideas at once practically effective. And so the
fair

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

city of the Amarna plain arose, a fatuous island of the blest in a sea
of discontent, a vision of fond hopes, born in a mind fatally forgetful
that the past cannot be annihilated. The marvel is that such a man
should have first arisen in the East, and especially in Egypt, where no
man except Ikhnaton possessed the ability to forget. Nor was the great
Mediterranean world which Egypt now dominated any better prepared for an
international religion than its Egyptian lords. The imperial imagination
of Ikhnaton reminds one of that of Alexander the Great, a thousand years
later, but it was many centuries in advance of his age.

We cannot wonder that when the storm broke it swept away almost all
traces of this earliest idealist. All that we have to tell us of him is
the wreck of his city, a lonely outpost of idealism, not to be overtaken
and passed till six centuries later those Bedouin hordes who were now
drifting into Ikhnaton's Palestinian provinces had coalesced into a
nation of social, moral, and religious aspirations, and had thus brought
forth the Hebrew prophets.

class="smallcaps">Davies</span>, *Amarna*, V, p. 30) is clearly a
compromise with the Heliopolitan priests, but of course does not mean
"animal worship."

<span id="fn_833"></span>[322:1](rtae13.htm#fr_833) See <span
class="smallcaps">Sethe</span>, *Zeitschr. für aegypt. Sprache*, 44,
116–118, where this new rendering of the name is demonstrated. The
rendering in the author's history, p. 364, is to be changed accordingly.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[322:2](rtae13.htm#fr_834) It has been widely
stated that the hostility of Ikhnaton did not extend beyond his erasure
of Amon; but this is an error. I found other gods expunged in Nubia. See
also my remarks in *Zeitschr. für aegypt. Sprache*, 40, 109–110.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[322:3](rtae13.htm#fr_835) There were at least
four. The earlier Boundary Stelæ give five (<span
class="smallcaps">Davies</span>, *Amarna*, V, p. 30), but one is
evidently a dittography of the preceding in the ancient scribes copy.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[323:1](rtae13.htm#fr_836) A list of the Aton
temples will be found in my essay in the *Zeitschr. für aegypt.
Sprache*, 40, 106–113. The Nubian city of Ikhnaton was found in 1907 by
the University of Chicago Expedition. See my *Monuments of Sudanese
Nubia*, pp. 51–82.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[323:2](rtae13.htm#fr_837) These tombs were
frequently visited and studied in the early days of Egyptology, and
fragmentarily published. No complete publication, however, was issued
until 1903–8, when <span class="smallcaps">N. de G. Davies</span>
published his valuable *Rock Tombs of El Amarna*, vols. I–VI, London,
1903–8, which includes everything at Amarna except the town site and the
tomb of the king. I copied the most important hymns there in 1895, and
these two sources are the bases of the renderings given above. For a
presentation of the Amarna situation, historically considered,
especially the life of the court in the new environment, the reader may
refer to the author's *History of Egypt*, pp. 358–378. A popular
discussion and description of the remarkable reliefs in the tombs will
be found in the author's *Two Thousand Miles Up the Nile*, soon to be
published.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[324:1](rtae13.htm#fr_838) The best text is
that of <span class="smallcaps">Davies</span>, *Amarna*, VI, pl. xxix.
Full commentary will be found in my *De hymnis in solem sub rege
Amenophide IV. conceptis*, Berlin, 1894, though unfortunately based on
the older text of Bouriant. Some changes in the above translation, as
compared with that in the author's *History*, are due to a few new
readings in <span class="smallcaps">Davies</span>'s text, as well as to
further study of the document also. The division into strophes is not in
the original, but is indicated here for the sake of clearness. The
titles of the strophes I have inserted to aid the modern reader.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[324:2](rtae13.htm#fr_839) There is a pun here
on the word Re, which is the same as the word used for "all."

<span id="fn_840"></span>[326:1](rtae13.htm#fr_840) The shorter hymns
follow the phrase "sole God," with the addition, "beside whom there is
no other" (see <span class="smallcaps">Davies</span>, *Amarna*, I,
XXXVI, l. 1, and III, XXIX, l. 1).

This use of the word sp for "quality" or "power" will be found also in
the hymn of Suti and Hor translated above (Brit. Mus. Stela 826, 1. 3);
Great Hymn to Amon (1, 5), and similarly on the late statue of Hor
(Louvre 88, <span class="smallcaps">Brugsch</span>, *Thes*., VI, 1251,
l. 1).

<span id="fn_841"></span>[326:2](rtae13.htm#fr_841) The word "heart" may
mean either "pleasure" or "understanding" here.

<span id="fn_842"></span>[327:1](rtae13.htm#fr_842) The word is one used
only of the people of Egypt.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[327:2](rtae13.htm#fr_843) The word used
implies the nourishment of a mother at the breast.

<span id="fn_844"></span>[329:1](rtae13.htm#fr_844) The short hymn was
put together in a composite text of all versions in the second
(unpublished) portion of my De hymnis in solem, and this was later
supplemented by my own copies. <span class="smallcaps">Davies</span> has
also put together a composite text from five tombs in his Amarna, IV,
pls. xxxii—xxxiii, The above translation is based on both sources.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[330:1](rtae13.htm#fr_845) See above, [p.
71](rtae07.htm#page_71).

<span id="fn_846"></span>[331:1](rtae13.htm#fr_846) Variant: "Breath, it
enters the nostrils when thou showest thyself to them."

<span id="fn_847"></span>[331:2](rtae13.htm#fr_847) The remainder of the
line is lost. Only one of the five texts Which exist from the beginning
goes as far as this point. It also stopped at this place, so that only
part of a line has been lost.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[331:3](rtae13.htm#fr_848) Stela K, <span
class="smallcaps">Davies</span>, *Amarna*, V, pl. xxix, l. 7.

<span id="fn_850"></span>[333:1](rtae13.htm#fr_850) See my *De hymnis in

<span id="fn_853"></span>[337:1](rtae13.htm#fr_853) It is difficult to
define the exact meaning of this phrase. The Sun-god was the father of
the goddess who personified Truth, and his close connection with truth
is evident throughout. In the sixty-fifth chapter of the Book of the
Dead, he lives "in truth" or "on truth," using the same words applied to
Ikhnaton. But the passage exhibits a very materialistic conception of
truth, for the Sun-god lives "on truth" as the Nile lives "on fish."
(See <span class="smallcaps">Grapow</span>, *Zeitschr.* <span
id="page_338">p. 338</span> *für aegypt. Sprache*, 49, 51.) The chapter
is a magical charm to force the Sun-god to justify the deceased. It was
doubtless such materialistic notions of ethical concepts which led the
priests to employ magic in the realm of ethics and ethical values.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[340:1](rtae13.htm#fr_858) In mortuary
doctrines this Amarna movement was unable wholly to eradicate the old
customs. The heart scarab is mentioned above; "ushebti" statuettes were
also known. There is one in Zurich, see <span
class="smallcaps">Wiedemann</span>, *Proceed. of the Soc. of Bib.
Arch.*, VII, 200–3; also one in Cairo, see <span
class="smallcaps">Maspero</span>, *Musée égyptien*, III, pl. xxiii, pp.
27–28. They contain prayers for sustenance at the tomb, in the name of
Aton. Osiris is not named.
