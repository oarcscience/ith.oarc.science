# CHAPTER IV.

### THE FOURTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED ANKHET-KHEPERU

IN the scene that illustrates the FOURTH DIVISION of the Tuat, which is
passed through by the Sun-god during the FOURTH HOUR Of the night, a
region which is entirely different from anything seen previously is
entered. We see that the general arrangement which makes each Division
to contain three sections has been followed, but the actual path of the
Boat of the Sun is different. Instead of passing along the middle
section as before, the god is obliged to pass over the region of the
kingdom of Seker. The course which was usually passed over by the dead
runs from one side of the section to the other diagonally, and it may be
thus described:--Starting from the upper side of the topmost division,
the corridor, which is called RE-STAU, slants across to the lower side;
at the point where it touches the line which divides the first and
second section is a door, which is thrown open.

The door is called MATES-SMA-TA. The corridor runs

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

parallel with the line which divides the first and second section for
some distance, and is described as the "road of the secret things of
Re-stau; the god doth not pass through the leaves of the door, but they
hear his voice." A sharp bend takes RE-STAU in a slanting direction
across the middle section of the scene, and at the bottom of it is
another door, which is called METES-MAU-AT, the corridor runs parallel
with the line which divides the second and third section for some
distance, when it crosses the section, again in a slanting direction,
and at the end of it is a third door, which is called METES-EN-NEHEH. In
the second slant of the corridor is an inscription which describes it as
the road by which entereth the body of SEKER, who is on his sand, the
image which is hidden, and is neither seen nor perceived,

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

\[paragraph continues\] As the further course of the corridor will be
described under the Fifth Hour we may pass on to consider the Boat of
the Sun, and the means by which the god makes his way onward.

Ra and the gods who formed his crew have left the boat in which they
travelled until now, and have betaken themselves to one, each end of
which terminates in the head of a serpent. This serpent-boat is drawn
along by four gods, who are called TUN-EN-MAA, HER-UARFU, AR-NEFERTU,
and SHETAI, Above the boat is written, "\[Whilst\] this great god
journeyeth over those who are in this scene the flames which the mouth
of his boat emit guide him through these pools; he seeth not their
forms, but he crieth to them and to their places, and they hear his
voice,

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

In front of those who tow the boat of Ra are:--

1\. A form of Osiris called EM-ANKHTI, (see [p. 71](#page_71)).

2\. The crook of Osiris (see [p. 75](#page_75)).

3, 4. Thoth, ibis-headed, and Horus, hawk-headed, standing facing each
other, with the UTCHAT, above their outstretched hands and arms; the
title of Thoth is UTHESU, i.e., "the Raiser," and that of Horus is AU-AU
or, "the wide of hands." The Utchat is called SEKRI.

5\. The god SETHEN-HAT, wearing the crown of the South.

6\. The god HER-TEBAT-F, i.e., "He who is over his place of burial,"
having in the place of a head two curved objects, which M. Maspero
identifies with mummy bandages (see, [p. 79](#page_79)).

7\. The god UATCH-HRA, i.e., "Green Face" (see [p. 79](#page_79)).

8\. The god HETEP, who carries the crook of Osiris mentioned above (No.
2) (see p. 79).

9-11. Three gods, each of whom carries an ankh in his

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

left hand, whose names are SEM-ANKH, AN-HER, and UT-MET, (see pp.
[79](#page_79), [83](#page_83)).

12\. The goddess NEBT-ANKH, (see [p. 80](#page_80)).

The text which refers to these beings reads:--

"Those who are in this picture, in their forms of their bodies, are the
hidden \[travellers\] upon the way of the holy country whose secret
things are hidden. They are the guardians of the way of the holy
\[land\] for those who enter into the hidden place of the Tuat, and they
keep ward over Anpu in his forms as he tows them along, when he entereth
in by them in the holy land."

In the upper register are:--

1\. A goddess, wearing the crown of the North, apparently a form of
Neith (see [p. 63](#page_63)).

2\. A serpent, with a human head, and two pairs of human feet and legs
(see [p. 63](#page_63)).

3-5. Three serpents, which move side by side along the ground "upon
their bellies". Of them it is said, "Those who are in this picture make
their passage to every place each day" (see [p. 67](#page_67)).

6\. The scorpion ANKHET, and a large uraeus. Of these it is said, "Those
who are in this picture stand in Re-stau at the head of the way \[to
guard it\]." Behind these stands a god, who appears to be making an
offering of two libation vases to the serpent. Of him it is said, "He
who is in this picture is the guide of the holy way" (see [p.
71](#page_71)).

7\. A three-headed serpent, with a pair of hawk's wings, and two pairs
of human legs, and of him it is said, "He who is in this picture in the
Tuat is the warder of this holy way of Re-stau; he liveth upon the
abundance \[which cometh\] from his wings, his body, \[and\] his heads,

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

\[paragraph continues\] (see pp. [71](#page_71), [75](#page_75)).

8\. The god AP-TUAT, who holds a sceptre, in his right hand, and stands
before the serpent NEHEB-KAU, which has two heads on one end of its
body, and one head, instead of a tail, at the other. Of the god AP-TUAT
it is said, "He who is in this picture is in the form which Horus made,
and he openeth \[the way\] for the two gods on this way." Of the serpent
NEHEB-KAU it is said, "He who is in this picture is at his place NET-MU,
by the holy way of passage of RE-STAU, and he journeyeth about to every
place each day, and he liveth upon the abundance of that which issueth
from his mouth," (see pp. [75](#page_75), [79](#page_79)).

9\. A god, who grasps the third head of NEHEB-KAU with his right hand,
and a staff with a curled end in the left; facing him is a headless god
called AB-TUAT (see pp. [79](#page_79), [83](#page_83)).

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

10\. A goddess of the South (NEKHEBET) and a goddess of the North. Of
the last group of figures it is said, "Those who are in this picture are
in the form wherein Horus hath made them; they are the warders of the
serpent NEHEPU, who guide him to the hidden thing which is on this
secret way," (see [p. 83](#page_83)).

In the lower register are:--

1\. A large boat, each end of which terminates in the head of a woman;
lying along the bottom of the boat is the serpent HETCH-NAU, (see pp.
[63](#page_63), [67](#page_67)). Concerning him it is said, "He <span
id="fr_2"></span>[1](#fn_2) who is in this picture . . . . in his boat
great, is the \[serpent\] which guardeth the AHETH chamber; he standeth
up at the mouth of the hidden passages of the AHET chamber, and he
liveth upon the two voices of the heads of the boat."

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Under the neck of this serpent is the emblem
"life," (an ankh).

2\. A woman called MUTHENITH, standing (see [p. 67](#page_67)).

3\. A woman called SHATHETH, standing (see [p. 67](#page_67)).

5\. A lion-headed goddess called HEN-KHERTH (?) (see [p. 71](#page_71)).

6\. A goddess, with a pair of horns on her head, in a sitting position,
but with no throne to sit upon; her name is THEST-APT, (see [p.
71](#page_71)). Of these beings it is said, "Those who are in this
picture are in the forms wherein Horus made them, and they stand on the
ground of Re-stau in the hidden place . . . . . . . ."

7\. The male serpent AMEN, (see pp. [75](#page_75), [77](#page_77)).

8\. The female serpent HEKENT, which has a human head growing out of its
body, a little distance from the tip of its tail; the human head faces
the serpent AMEN. Of the male serpent it is said, "He

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

who is in this picture is the guardian of the secret passages which lead
to the AHETH chamber; he journeyeth round to every place each day, and
he liveth on the words of the gods who guard this road." The meaning of
the legend which refers to the female serpent Hekent is not clear.

9\. The three-headed serpent (see [p. 79](#page_79)) MENMENUT, which is
described as the "hidden image of the AHETH chamber \[of Seker\], which
is illumined daily at the birth of KHEPERA by that which cometh forth
from the faces of \[the serpent\] MENMENT." Over the back of this
serpent are six stars and fourteen human heads, each of which is
surmounted by a disk. These fourteen heads represent, as M. Maspero has
well shown, the gods of the first fourteen days of the month, who are
being carried by the three-headed serpent to

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the Utchat, which Thoth and Horus are carrying to it; they appear again
in the next Division of the Tuat, where they are seen drawing along the
boat of the sun.

10\. The winged disk of the god KHEPERA, Beneath stands the "envoy of
heaven," with his right hand raised, and his left stretched out, and
behind him is the goddess MAAT (see [p. 83](#page_83)).
