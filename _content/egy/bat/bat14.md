\[paragraph continues\] "Those who are in this picture are in front of
this great god, and they carry the serpent Mehen-ta on their heads into
this City, and they travel onwards in the following of Ra into the
Eastern Horizon of the sky. This god crieth unto them by their names,
and he decreeth for them what they have to do. And Ra saith unto
them:--'O ye who keep ward over your serpent-figures with your two

firm, who perform the journeyings which ye are bound to make, who make
long your steps as ye go, unite ye yourselves to your offerings in the
Hall of the Eastern Horizon.' Their work is to make the serpent Mehen to
travel to the Eastern Hall of the Horizon, and they unite themselves to

this picture of \[this\] door \[are\] in the form which Horus made; when
this god crieth out to them by their names they spring into life at the
sound of his voice, and it is they who guard the holy gate of the city
of SAIT (Saïs), which is unknown, and cannot be seen, and cannot be
looked at." Above the upper register is a line of text, which reads

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

"\[This is\] the hidden Circle of the Tuat through which this god maketh
his journey so that he may come forth into the Eastern Horizon of the
sky; it swalloweth eternally its images (or, forms) in the presence of
the god REKH (?), who dwelleth in this City, and then it giveth them to
those who are born and come into being in the earth. Whosoever shall
make an exact copy of these forms according to the representations of

is in this picture, the form (or, image) of the god Tem proceedeth from
his back; but afterwards it swalloweth itself (i.e., disappeareth)." The
words \#\#\# may form the name of the winged serpent.

entreaty of the souls and shadows which have been placed in their pits
of fire."
