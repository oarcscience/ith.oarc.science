# CHAPTER VIII.

### THE EIGHTH DIVISION OF THE TUAT, WHICH IS CALLED TEBAT-NETERU-S.

THE scene that illustrates the EIGHTH DIVISION Of the Tuat, which is
passed through by the Sun-god during the EIGHTH HOUR of the night, is
introduced by four lines of text which read:--

"The Majesty of this great god taketh up its place in the Circles of the
hidden gods who are on their sand,

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

and he addresseth to them words in his boat whilst the gods tow him
along through this City by means of the magical powers of the serpent
MEHEN. The name of the gate of this City is AHA-AN-URT-NEF. The name of
this City is TEBAT-NETERU-S. The name of the Hour of the night which
guideth this great god is NEBT-USHA."

The Circles of this Division are thus described:--

"The hidden Circles of Ament which are passed through by the great god,
his boat being towed along by the gods who dwell in the Tuat; let them
be made according to the figures \[which are depicted\] on the north of
the hidden palace in the Tuat. Whosoever knoweth them by their names
shall be the possessor of swathings upon earth, and he shall not be
repulsed at the hidden gates, and he shall have offerings in very great
abundance regularly and perpetually."

In the middle register are:--

1\. The boat of the sun, in which the god stands

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

under a canopy formed by the body of the serpent Mehen, being towed
along by nine gods. His passage is thus described: "This god maketh his
way into this City, being towed along by the gods of the Tuat, in his
hidden form of MEHEN. This god sendeth forth a cry to the regions

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

of every Circle of this City, and also to the gods who are therein, and
it is the voice of them which this god heareth after he hath sent forth
a cry to them. The figures of their bodies remain always with their dead
bodies which are under their sand, and their gates open to the voice of
this god each day, and then they hide themselves after he hath passed by
them. Their work in the Tuat is to tow Ra along over the ways of this

\[paragraph continues\] City, and they rise up after they have towed him
along into this Hall, and they say unto him:--O thou god, come thou to
thine hidden image, O our god, and to all the sepulchres of
KHENTI-AMENTI, unite thyself strongly to it, and mayest thou be
entreated to lighten the darkness of those who are on their sands. We
beseech thee to come and to unite thyself, O Ra, to those who tow thee
along." The eight gods

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

who tow along the boat of Ra are thus described: "These are the gods of
the Tuat who tow alone, Ra in the place where the gods have their
sepulchres (TEBAT-NETERU-SET), and he is \[acclaimed\] by those who are
in this City. The images secret of TATHENEN, Of Horus (?), \[and of\]
the gods are with them."

2\. Nine large objects somewhat in the form of the hieroglyphic *shems*,
which has the meaning of "follower" or "servant"; unlike this sign,
however, each of the nine objects is provided with a huge knife, and
from the curved end of each is suspended a human head. M. Maspero is
undoubtedly correct in describing these as the servants of the god. The
names of the nine servants are:--

1\. HETEP-TA.

2\. AMEN.

3\. SESHETA-BAIU (?).

4\. SEKHEN-KHAIBIT.

5\. NEB-ER-TCHER.

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

Of these gods it is said:

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

picture are those who are on the path along which this god is towed, and
they have their swathings before them in the form in which the god
himself \[had them\]. This our great god crieth out unto those who have
their life in them, in \[their\] heads in their forms, and this god
crieth out to them by their names. Their work is \[to seize\] the
enemies of Ra everywhere throughout this City, and then to make their
heads to pass under their swords after this god hath passed them by."

3\. A ram, having the solar disk between his horns,

their swathings of linen in front of them, in the form in which the god
himself \[had them\], are they to whom he crieth out after he hath come
to the place where they are. And they on their part cry out to this god
with their voices which are joyful but hidden, and this god singeth a
song of joy at their voices. After \[this
