# The Book of Am-Tuat

## by E. A. Wallis Budge

#### \[1905\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This book is an Ancient Egyptian cosmological treatise which describes
the Tuat, the underworld that the boat of the Sun God, Ra, traverses
during the night hours. Each chapter deals with one of the twelve hours
of the night. A hallucinogenic travelogue of the netherworld, this
extensively illustrated book depicts hundreds of gods and goddesses that
appear nowhere else in the literature.
