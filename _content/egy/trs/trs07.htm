<p>11. &#8220;possessed a divine heart which was beneficent towards the gods; and he hath given gold in large quantities, and grain in large quantities to the temples and he hath given very many lavish gifts in order to make Ta-Mert [Egypt] prosperous, and to make stable [her] advancement;</p>  
<p>12. &#8220;and he hath given unto the soldiers who are in his august service . . . . . . according to their rank</p>

<p>14. &#8220;and he hath forgiven the prisoners who were in prison, and ordered that every one among them should be released from [the punishment] which he had to undergo. And His Majesty made an order saying:&#8212;In respect of the things [which are to be given to] the gods, and the money and the</p>  
<p>15. &#8220;grain which are to be given to the temples each year, and all the things [which are to be given to] the gods from the vineyards and from the corn-lands of the nome, all the things which were then due under the Majesty of his holy father</p>  
<p>16. &#8220;shall he allowed to remain [in their amounts] to them as they were then; and he hath ordered:&#8212;Behold, the treasury (?) shall not he made more full of contributions by the hands of the priests than it was up to the first year of the reign of His Majesty, his holy father; and His Majesty hath remitted</p>  
<p>17. &#8220;To the priests who minister in the temples in courses the journey which they had been accustomed to make by river in boats to the city of ALEXANDRIA at the beginning of each years and His Majesty commanded:&#8212;Behold, those who are boatmen [by trade] shall not be seized [and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_203"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 203</FONT></A></p>  
<p>made to serve in the Navy]; and in respect of the cloths of byssus [which are] made in the temples for the royal house,</p>  
<p>18. &#8220;he hath commanded that two-thirds of them shall be returned [to the priests]; similarly, His Majesty hath [re]-established all the things, the performance of which had been set aside, and hath restored them to their former condition, and he hath taken the greatest care to cause everything which ought to be done in the service of the gods to be done in the sane way in which it was done</p>  
<p>19. &#8220;in former [days]; similarly, he hath donc [all things] in a right and proper manner; and he hath taken care to administer justice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_78"></A><A HREF="#fn_78"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> <i>to the people, even like Thoth, the great, great [God]; and he hath, more over, ordered in respect of those of the troops who come back, and the other people also, who during the</i>&nbsp;</p>

<p>21. &#8220;Egypt by land as well as by sea; and he hath in consequence expended a very large amount of money and of grain on them in order to make prosperous the lands of Horus and Egypt.</p>

<p>23. &#8220;the rebels who were in it&#8212;now they had committed great acts of sacrilege in the land of Horus, and had done injury to those who dwelt in Egypt&#8212;His Majesty attacked them by making a road [to their town],</p>  
<p>24. &#8220;and he raised mounds (or walls) against them, and he dug trenches, and whatsoever would lead [him] against them that he made; <i>and he caused the canals which supplied the town with water to be blocked up, a thing which none of the kings who preceded him had ever been able to do before, and he expended a large amount of money on carrying out the work;</i>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>25. &#8220;and His Majesty stationed infantry at the mouths of the canals <i>in order to watch and to guard them against the extraordinary rise of the waters</i> [<i>of the Nile</i>], <i>which took place in the eighth year</i> [<i>of his reign</i>], <i>in the aforesaid canals which watered the fields, and were unusually deep</i>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>26. &#8220;in this spot; and His Majesty captured the town by assault in a very short time, and he cut to pieces the rebels who were therein, and he made an exceedingly great slaughter among them, even like unto that which THOTH&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_79"></A><A HREF="#fn_79"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and HORUS, the son of Isis and [the son of Osiris], made among those who rebelled against them&nbsp;</p>  
<p>27. &#8220;when they rebelled in this very place; and behold, those who had led on the soldiers and were at their head, and who had disturbed the borders [in the time of his father, and who had committed sacrilege in the temples, when His Majesty came to MEMPHIS to avenge his father</p>

<p>28. &#8220;and his own sovereignty he punished, according to their deserts, when he came there to celebrate] the festival of the receiving of the sovereignty from his father; and [besides this], he hath set aside [his claim to</p>  
<p>29. &#8220;the things which were due to His Majesty, and which were [then] in the temples, up to the eighth year [of his reign, which amounted to no small sum of] money and grain; and His Majesty hath also set aside [his claim] to the cloths of byssus which ought to have been given to the royal house and were [then] in the temples,</p>  
<p>30. &#8220;and also the tax which they (<i>i.e.</i> the priests) ought to have contributed for dividing the cloths into pieces, which was due up to this day; and he hath also remitted to the temples the grain which was usually levied as a tax on the corn-lands of the gods, and likewise the measure of wine which was clue as a tax on vineyards [of the gods];</p>  
<p>31. &#8220;and he hath done great things for APIS, and MNEVIS, and for every shrine which contained a sacred animal, and he expended upon them more than did his ancestors; and his heart hath entered into [the consideration of everything] which was right and proper for them</p>  
<p>32. &#8220;at every moment; and he hath given everything which was necessary for the embalming of their bodies, lavishly, and in magnificent abundance; and he hath undertaken the cost of their maintenance in their temples, and the cost of their great festivals, and of their burnt offerings, and sacrifices, and libations;</p>  
<p>33. &#8220;[and he hath respected the privileges of the temples, and of Egypt, and hath maintained them in a suitable</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_206"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 206</FONT></A></p>  
<p>manner according to what is customary and right; and he hath spent] both money and grain to no small amount;</p>  
<p>34. &#8220;and [hath provided] everything in great abundance for the house wherein dwelleth the LIVING APIS; and His Majesty hath decorated it with perfect and new ornamentations of the most beautiful character always; and he hath made the LIVING APIS to rise [like the sun], and hath founded temples, and shrines, and chapels [in his honour]; [and he hath repaired the shrines, which needed repairs, and in all matters appertaining to the service of the gods</p>  
<p>35. &#8220;he hath manifested the spirit of a beneficent god; and during his reign, having made careful inquiry, he hath restored the temples which were held in the greatest honour, as was right] and in return for these things the gods and goddesses have given him victory, and power, and life, and strength, and health, and every beautiful thing of every kind whatsoever, and</p>  
<p>36. &#8220;in respect of his exalted rank, it shall be established to him and to his children for ever and ever, with happy results (or life).&#8221;</p>  
<p>And it has entered into the heart(s) of the priests of the temples of the South and of the North, and of each and every temple [that all the honours which</p>  
<p>37. are paid] to the King of the South and North <b>Ptolemy, the ever-living, the beloved of Pta&#7717;</b>, the [God who maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are beautiful, and those which are paid to the Father-loving Gods who begot him, and to the Beneficent Gods who begot those who begot him, and to the Brother-Gods who begot the begetters of his begetters,]</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_207"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 207</FONT></A></p>  
<p>38. and to the Saviour-Gods, shall be [greatly increased]; and a statue of the King of the South and North, <b>Ptolemy, ever-living, beloved of Pta&#7717;</b>, the God who maketh himself manifest, the Lord of beauties, shall be set up [in every temple, in the most prominent place], and it shall be</p>  
<p>39, called by his name "<b>PTOLEMY</b>, the SAVIOUR of EGYPT," the interpretation (?) of which is "<b>PTOLEMY</b>, THE VICTORIOUS ONE." [And it shall stand side by side with a statue of the Lord of the gods (?), who giveth him the weapon of victory, and it shall be fashioned after the manner of the Egyptians, and a statue of this kind shall be set up in]</p>  
<p>40. all the temples which are called by his name. And adoration shall he paid unto these statues three times each day, and every rite and ceremony which it is proper to perform before them shall be performed, and whatsoever is prescribed, and is fitting for their DOUBLES, shall be performed, even as it is performed for the gods of the Nomes during the festivals and on every sacred day (?), on the day of [his] coronation, and on his name-day. And there shall likewise [be set up] a</p>  
<p>41. magnificent (?) statue of the King of the South and North <b>Ptolemy, ever-living beloved of Pta&#7717;</b>, the God who maketh himself manifest, whose deeds are beautiful, the son of <b>Ptolemy</b>, and <b>Arsino&euml;</b>, the Father-loving gods, and with the statue there shall be a magnificent shrine [made] of the finest copper and inlaid with real stones of every kind,</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_208"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 208</FONT></A></p>  
<p>42. in every temple which is called by his name; and this statue shall rest in the most holy place [in the temples] side by side with the shrines of the gods of the Nomes. And on the days of the great festivals, when the god [of the temple] cometh forth from his holy habitation, according to his day, the holy shrine of the God who maketh himself manifest, the lord of beauties, shall likewise be made to rise [like the Sun]</p>  
<p>43. with them. And in order to make this new shrine to be easily distinguishable [both at the present day, and in future times, they shall set] upon this shrine [ten royal double crowns, made of gold and upon [each of the double crowns there shall be placed the [serpent which it is right and proper to make for the [double crown of gold], instead of the two Uraei</p>  
<p>44. which are [placed] upon the tops of the shrines, and the SEKHENT CROWN shall be in the middle of them, because it was in the SEKHENT CROWN in which His Majesty shone in the house of the KA of PTA&#7716; (<i>i.e.</i>, Memphis)</p>  
<p>45. at the time when the king entered into the temple, and performed the ceremonies which it was meet and right for him to perform on receiving the exalted rank [of King].
