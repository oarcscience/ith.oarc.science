*John Heydon encounters the Spirit Euterpe*.

Walking upon the plains of Bulverton Hill to study numbers and the
nature of things one evening, I could see, between me and the light, a
most exquisite divine beauty, her frame neither long nor short, but a
main decent stature; attired she was in thin loose silks, but so green
that I never saw the like, for the colour was not earthly; in some
places it was fancied with gold and silver ribbands, which looked like
the sun and lyllies in the field of grass. Her head was overcast with a
thin floating tiffany, which she held up with one of her hands, and
looked, as it were, from under it. Her eyes were quick, fresh, and
celestial, but had something of a start, as if she had been puzzled with
a suddain occurrence. From her vaile did leer locks break out, like sun
beams from a mist; they ran disheveld to her brest, and then returned to
her cheeks in curls and rings of gold. Her hair behind her was rowled to
a curious globe, with a small short spire flowered with purple and
skie-colour knots. Her rings were pure intire emeralds, for she valued
no metal,. and her pendants of burning carbuncles. In brief, her whole
habit was youthful and flowery; it smelt like the East, and was
thoroughly ayrd with rich Arabian diapasms.

Whilst I admired her perfections, and prepared to make my addresses, she
prevents me with a voluntary approach. Here, indeed, I expected some
discourse from her, but she, looking very seriously and silently in my
face, takes me by the hand and softly whispers: "My love I freely give
you,

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

and with it these tokens--mystery and signet; the one opens, the other
shuts; be sure to use both with discretion. As for the mysteries of the
Rosie Cross, you have my Library to peruse them all. There is not
anything here but I will gladly reveal it unto you; I will teach you the
virtues of numbers, of names, of angels, and genii of men. I have one
precept to commend to you--you must be silent. You shall not in your
writings exceed my allowance; remember that I am your love, and you will
not make me a prostitute. But because I wish you serviceable to those of
your own disposition, I give you an emblematical type of my sanctuary,
namely, the Axiomata of the R. C., the secrets of numbers, with a full
priviledge to publish it. And now I am going to the invisible region,
amongst the ethereal goddesses. Let not that proverb take place with
you, Out of sight, out of mind. Remember me and be happy."

I asked her if she would favour me with her name. To this she replyed
very familiarly, as if she had known me long before:--"My dear friend
H., I have many names, but my best beloved is Euterpe. Observe in your
R. C. Axiomata that the genuine time of impression of characters, names,
angels, numbers, and genii of men, is when the principles are Spermade
and Callado; but being once coagulated to a perfect body, the time of
stellification is past. Now the R. C. in old time used strange
astrological lamps, images, rings, and plates, with the numbers and
names engraven, which at certain hours would produce incredible
extraordinary effects. The common astrologer he takes a piece of
metalls, another whining associate he helps him with a chrystal stone,
and these they figure with ridiculous characters, and then expose them
to the planets,

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

not in an Alkemust, but as they dream they know not what. When this is
done, all is to no purpose, but though they faile in their practice,
they yet believe they understand the Axiomata of numbers well enough.
Now, my beloved J. H., that you may know what to do, I will teach you by
example:--Take a ripe grain of corn that is hard and drye; expose it to
the sun beams in a glass or other vessell, and it will be a dry grain
for ever; but if you do bury it in the earth, that the nitrous saltish
moysture of the element may dissolve it, then the sun will work upon it
and make it sprout to a new body. It is just thus with the common
astrologer; he exposeth to the planets a perfect compacted body, and by
this meanes thinkes to perform the Rosie Crucian Gamaœa, and marry the
inferiour and superiour worlds.

"It must be a body reduced into sperme, that the heavenly feminine
moisture, which receives and retains the impress of the Astrall Agent;
may be at liberty, and immediately exposed to the masculine fire of
Nature. This is the ground of the Beril, but you must remember that
nothing can be stellified without the joynt magnetism of three
heavens--what they are you know already."

When she had thus said, she took out of her bosom two miraculous medalls
with numbers and names on them; they were not metalline, but such as I
had never seen, neither did I conceive there was in Nature such pure and
glorious substances. In my judgment, they were two magical Telesms, but
she called them Saphiricks of the sun and moon. These miracles Euterpe
commended to my perusal, and stopt in a mute ceremony. She lookt upon me
in silent smiles, mixt with a pretty kind of sadness, for we were
unwilling to part, but her hour of translation was

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

come, and, taking, as I thought, her last leave, she past before my eyes
into the ether of Nature, excusing herself as being sleepy--otherwise
she had expounded them to me. I lookt, admired, and wearied myself in
that contemplation; their complexion was so heavenly, their continuance
so mysterious, I did not well know what to make of them. I turned aside
to see if she was still asleep, but she was gone, and this did not a
little trouble me. I expected her return till the day was quite spent,
but she did not appear. At last, fixing my eyes on that place where she
sometimes rested, I discovered certain pieces of gold, full of numbers
and names, which she had left behinde her, and hard by a paper folded
like a letter. These I took up, and now the night approaching, the
evening star tinned in the West, when taking my last survey of her
flowery pillow, I parted from it in these verses--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Pretty green bank, farewel, and mayst thou wear  
Sun-beams, and rose, and lillies all the year;  
She slept on thee, but needed not to shed  
Her gold, ’twas joy enough to be her bed.  
Thy flowers are favourites, for this loved day  
They were my rivals, and with her did play;  
They found their heaven at hand, and in her eyes  
Enjoy’d a copy of their absent skies.  
Their weaker paint did with true glories trade,  
And mingl’d with her cheeks one posy made;  
And did not her soft skin confine their pride,  
And with a skreen of silk her flowers divide,  
They had suck’d life from thence, and from her heat  
Borrow’d a soul to make themselves compleat.  
  O happy pillow! though thou art laid even  
With dust, she made thee up almost a heaven;  
Her breath rain’d spices, and each amber ring  
Of her bright locks strew’d bracelets o’er thy spring.  
That earth’s not poor, did such a treasure hold,  
But thrice inrich’d with amber, spice, and gold."</span>

Thus much at this time and no more am I allowed by my

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

mistress Euterpe to publish. Be, therefore, gentle reader, admonished,
that with me you do earnestly pray to God, that it please Him to open
the hearts and ears of all ill-hearing people, and to grant unto them
His blessing, that they may be able to know Him in His omnipotency, with
admiring contemplation of Nature, to His honour and praise, and to the
love, help, comfort, and strengthening of our neighbours, and to the
restoring of all the diseased by the medecines above taught.

I had given you a more large account of the mysteries of Nature and the
Rosie Cross, but whilst I studyed medecines to cure others, my deare
sister Anne Heydon dyed, and I never heard she was sick (for she was one
hundred miles from mee), which puts an end to my writings, and thus I
take my leave of the world. I shall write no more; you know my books by
name, and this I write that none may abuse me by printing books in my
name, as Cole does Culpeper's. I return to my first happy solitudes.
