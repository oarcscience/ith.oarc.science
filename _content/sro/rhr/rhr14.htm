<p align="center"><i>The Sixth Day</i>.</p>  
<p>Next morning, after we had awaked another, we sate<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Define ort&aelig; dubi&aelig; opiniones.</FONT></span> together to discourse what might be the wont of things. Some were of opinion that the corps should all be inlivened again together. Others contradicted this, because the decease of the ancients was not only to restore life but increase too to the young ones. Some imagined that they were not put to death, but that others were beheaded in their stead. Having talked a pretty while, in comes the<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Custos.</FONT></span> old man, and first saluting us, looks about to see if all things were ready. We had herein so behaved ourselves<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Pyrotechnia hospitum laudatur.</FONT></span> that he had no fault to find with our diligence, whereupon he placed all the glasses together, and put them into a case. Presently come certain youths, bringing ladders, <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Pueri armiferi.</FONT></span> roapes, and large wings, which they laid before us and departed. Then the old man began thus:--"My dear Sons, one of these three things must each of you this day constantly bear about with him. It is free for you to make choice of one of them, or to cast lots." We replied that we would choose. "Nay," said he, "let it rather go by lot. Hereupon he made three little schedules, writing<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Sors.</FONT></span> on one Ladder, on the second Rope, on the third Wings. These he laid in an hat; each man must draw, and whatever he happened on was to be his. Those who got ropes imagined themselves in the best case; but I chanced on a ladder, which hugely afflicted me, for it was twelve-foot long, pretty weighty, and I must be forced to carry it, whereas the others could handsomely coyle their ropes about them, and as for the wings, the old man joyned them so neatly on to the third sort as if they had grown upon them. Hereupon he turned the cock, and the</p>  
<p><a name="page_172"><font size="1" color="green">p. 172</font></A></p>  
<p>fountain ran no longer, and we were fain to remove it out of the way. After all things were carried off, he, taking with him the casket and glasses, took leave, and locked the door after him, so we imagined that we had been <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Ascensus in 2 conclave.</FONT></span>imprisoned in this Tower; but it was hardly a quarter of an hour before a round hole above was uncovered, where we saw our Virgin, who bad us good morrow, desiring us to come up. They with the wings were instantly through the hole; only they with the ropes were in an evil plight, for as soon as ever one of us was up, he was commanded to <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Restis difficultas.</FONT></span>draw up the ladder to him. At last each man's rope was hanged on an iron hook, and he climbed up as well as he could, which indeed was not compassed without blisters. When we were all well up, the hole was again covered, and we were friendly received by the Virgin. This room was the whole breadth of the Tower itself, having six very stately vestries a little raised and reached by three steps. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Descriptio 2 conclav</FONT></span>In these we were distributed to pray for the life of the King and Queen. Meanwhile the Virgin went in and out at the little door <i>a</i> till we had done. As soon as our process was absolved, there was brought in through the little door by twelve persons, which were formerly our musitians, a wonderful thing of longish shape, which my companions took to be a fountain, and which was placed in the middle. I well observed that the corps lay in it, for the inner chest was of an oval figure, so large that six persons might well lie therein one by another. After this they again went forth, fetched their instruments, and conducted in our Virgin, with her she-attendants, to a most <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The little casket.</FONT></span>delicate voice of musick. The Virgin carried a little casket, the rest only branches, and small lamps or lighted</p>  
<p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></A></p>  
<p>torches, which last were immediately given into our hands, and we stood about the fountain in this order.</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_17300"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/17300.jpg"></p>  
<p>First stood the Virgin A, with her attendants in a ring<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Ordo chori</FONT></span> round about, with the lamps and branches <i>c</i>. Next stood we with our torches <i>b</i>, then the musitians in a long rank; last of all, the rest of the Virgins <i>d</i>, in another long rank. Whence the Virgins came, whether they dwelt in the<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Virgines unde.</FONT></span> Castle, or were brought in by night, I know not, for their faces were covered with delicate white linnen. The<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Quid in arcula.</FONT></span> Virgin opened the casket, in which was a round thing wrapped in a piece of green double taffata. This she laid in the uppermost kettle, and covered it with the lid, which was full of holes, and had besides a rim, on which she poured in some of the water which we had the day before prepared; the fountain began immediately began to run, and through four small pipes to drive into the little kettle. Beneath the undermost kettle were many sharp</p>  
<p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A></p>  
<p>points, on which the Virgins stuck their lamps, that the heat might come to the kettle and make the water seeth, which, when it began to simper, by many little holes at a, fell in upon the bodies, and was so hot that it dissolved them all, and turned them into liquor. What the above-said round wrapt-up thing was, my companions knew not, but I understood that it was the Moor's head, from which the water conceived so great heat. At <i>b</i>, round about the <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Rami laures.</FONT></span>great kettle, there were again many holes, in which they stuck their branches, but whether this was done of necessity or for ceremony I know not. However, these branches were continually sprinkled by the fountain, whence it afterwards dropt somewhat of a deeper yellow into the kettle. This lasted for near two hours, the fountain still running, but more faintly. Meantime the musitians went their way, and we walked up and down in the room, which <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Delici&aelig; in conclavi.</FONT></span>truly was so made that we had opportunity enough to pass away our time. There were images, paintings, clock-works, organs, springing fountains, and the like. When it was near the time that the fountain ceased, the Virgin commanded a golden globe to be brought. At the bottom of the fountain was a tap, by which she let out all the matter dissolved by those hot drops (whereof certain quarts were then very red) into the globe. The rest of the water above in the kettle was poured out, and so this fountain was again carried forth. Whether it was opened abroad, or whether anything of the bodies that was useful yet remained, I dare not certainly say, but the water emptied <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Gravitas aqu&aelig;.</FONT></span>into the globe was much heavier than six or more of us were able to bear, albeit for its bulk it should have seemed not too heavy for one man. This globe being with much ado gotten out of doors, we again sate alone, but I, perceiving</p>  
<p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A></p>  
<p>a trampling over head, had an eye to my ladder. After one quarter of an hour, the cover above was lifted, and we commanded to come up, which we did as before, with wings, ladders, and ropes, and it did not a little vex me that<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Ascensus in 3 conclave.</FONT></span> whereas the Virgins could go up another way, we were fain to take so much toil; yet I could judge there must be some special reason for it, and we must leave somewhat for the old man to do too. The hole being again shut fast, I saw the globe hanging by a strong chain in the middle of the room, in which there was nothing but windows, with a door between<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Descriptio conclavis.</FONT></span> every two, which was covered with a great polished looking-glass. These windows and looking-glasses were so optically opposed that although the sun, which now shined exceeding bright, beat only upon one door, yet (after the windows<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Artif. optica.</FONT></span> towards the sun were opened, and the doors before the looking-glasses drawn aside) in all quarters of the room there was nothing but suns, which by artificial refractions beat upon the whole golden globe hanging in the midst, which, being polished, gave such a lustre that none of us could open our eyes, but were forced to look out at windows till the globe was well heated, and brought to the<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Mirac. spec.</FONT></span> desired effect. In these mirrors I saw the most wonderful spectacles that ever nature brought to light, for there were suns in all places, and the globe in the middle shined brighter yet. At length the virgin commanded to shut up the looking-glasses and make fast the windows to let the globe cool a little, wherefore we thought good, since we might now have leisure, to refresh ourselves with a breakfast. This treatment was again right philosophical, and<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Prandium philosoph.</FONT></span> we had no need to be afraid of intemperance, though we had no want, while the hope of the future joy, with which the virgin continually comforted us, made us so jocond that</p>  
<p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A></p>  
<p>we regarded not any pains or inconvenience. I can truly say concerning my companions of high quality that their minds never ran after their kitchen or table, but their pleasure was only to attend on this adventurous physic, and hence to contemplate the Creator's wisdom and omnipotency. After our refection we settled ourselves to work, for the globe was sufficiently cooled, which with toil and labour we were to lift off the chain and set upon the floor. The dispute then was how we were to get the globe in sunder, for we were commanded to divide it in the midst. The conclusion was that a sharp-pointed diamond would be best to do it, and when we had thus opened the globe, there was no redness to be seen, but a lovely great snow-white egg, and it mightily rejoyced us that this was so well brought to pass, for the virgin was in perpetual care least the shell might still be too tender. We stood around about this egg as jocond as if we ourselves had laid it, but the Virgin made it presently be carried forth, and departed herself, locking the door behind her. What she did abroad with the egg, or whether it were privately handled, I know not, neither do I believe it. We were again to pause for one quarter of an hour, till the third hole opened, and we, by means of our instruments, came upon the fourth stone or floor. In this room we found a great copper kettle filled with silver sand, which was warmed with a gentle fire, and afterwards the egg was raked up in it, that it might therein come to perfect maturity. This kettle was exactly square. Upon one side stood these two verses writ in great letters--</p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> On the second side were these three words--</p>  
<p align="center">SANITAS. NIX. HASTA.</p>

<p align="center">F.I.A.T.</p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> But on the hindmost part stood an entire inscription, running thus--</p>

<p>Now, whether the sand or egg were hereby meant I leave the learned to dispute. Our egg, being ready, was taken out, but it needed no cracking, for the Bird soon freed himself, looking very jocond, though bloody and unshapen. We first set him on the warm sand, the Virgin commanding<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Pullus implumis.</FONT></span> that before we gave him anything to eat we should be sure to make him fast, otherwise he would give us all work enough. This being done, food was brought him, which<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Vincitur.</FONT></span> surely was nothing but the blood of the beheaded deluted<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Pascitur sanguine decallatorum</FONT></span> with prepared water, by which the Bird grew so fast under our eye that we well saw why the Virgin gave such warning of him. He bit and scratched so devilishly that, could he have had his will upon any of us, he would soon</p>  
<p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></A></p>  
<p>have dispatched him. Now he was wholly black and wild, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Sanguine alius Regis pascitur.</FONT></span>wherefore other meat was brought him, perhaps the blood of another of the Royal Persons, whereupon all his black feathers moulted and were replaced by snow-white ones. He was somewhat tamer too, and more tractable, though we did not yet trust him. At the third feeding his feathers began to be so curiously coloured that I never saw the like <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Iridescit.</FONT></span>for beauty. He was also exceedingly tame, and behaved himself so friendly with us that, the Virgin consenting, we <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Liberatur vinculis.</FONT></span>released him from captivity. "&#8217;Tis now reason," she began, "since by your diligence, and our old man's consent, the Bird has attained with his life and the highest perfection, that he be also joyfully consecrated by us." Herewith she commanded to bring in dinner, since the most troublesome part of our work was now over, and it was fit we should begin to enjoy our passed labours. We began to make merry together. Howbeit, we had still our mourning cloaths on, which seemed somewhat reproachful to our mirth. The Virgin was perpetually inquisitive, perhaps to <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Primus usus ejus.</FONT></span>find to which of us her future purpose might prove serviceable, but her discourse was, for the most part, about Melting, and it pleased her well when any one seemed <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">&#924;&#949;&#952;&#959;&#948;&#8055;&#945;.</FONT></span>expert in such compendious manuals as do peculiarly commend an artist. This dinner lasted not above three-quarters of an hour, which we yet, for the most part, spent with our Bird, whom we were fain constantly to feed with his meat, though he continued much at the same growth. After Dinner we were not long suffered to digest our food, for the Virgin, together with the Bird, departed from us, <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">5. Conclave.</FONT></span>and the fifth room was opened, which we reached after the former manner, and tendred our service. In this <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Avis balneum.</FONT></span>room a bath was prepared for our Bird, which was so</p>  
<p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 179</font></A></p>  
<p>coloured with a fine white powder that it had the appearance of milk. It was cool when the Bird was set into it, and he was mighty well pleased with it, drinking of it, and pleasantly sporting in it. But after it began to heat, by reason of the lamps placed under it, we had enough to do to keep him in the bath. We, therefore, clapt a cover on the kettle, and suffered him to thrust out his head through a hole, till he had lost all his feathers in this bath, and was as smooth as a new-born babe, yet the heat did him no further harm. In this bath the feathers were quite consumed, and the bath was thereby turned into blew. At length we gave the Bird air, who of himself sprung out of the kettle, and was so glitteringly smooth that it was a pleasure to behold him. But because he was still somewhat wild, we were fain to put a collar, with a chain, about his neck, and so led him up and down<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Vincitur.</FONT></span> the room. Meantime a strong fire was made under the kettle, and the bath sodden away till it all came to a blew stone, which we took out, and, having pounded it, we<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Balneum coquitur in lapidem.</FONT></span> ground it on a stone, and finally with this colour painted the Bird's whole skin over, who then looked much more strangely, for he was all blew except the head, which remained white. Herewith our work in this story was performed, and we, after the Virgin with her blew Bird was departed from us, were called up a hole to the sixth<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">6. Conclave.</FONT></span> story, where we were mightily troubled, for in the midst a little altar, every way like that in the King's hall, was placed. Upon it stood the six forementioned particulars, and he himself (the Bird) made the seventh. First of all the little fountain was set before him, out of which Ile drunk a good draught; afterwards he pecked upon the white serpent till she bled mightily. This blood we received</p>  
<p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 180</font></A></p>  
<p>in a golden cup, and poured down the Bird's throat, who was mighty averse from it; then we dipt the serpent's head in the fountain, upon which she again revived, and crept into her death's head, so that I saw her no more for a long time. Meanwhile the sphere turned constantly on until it made the desired conjunction. Immediately the watch struck one, upon which there was going another conjunction. Then the watch struck two. Finally, whilst we were observing the third conjunction, and the same was indicated by the watch, the poor Bird of himself submissively laid down his neck upon the book, and willingly <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Avis decollutur.</FONT></span>suffered his head to be smitten off by one of us, thereto chosen by lot. Howbeit he yielded not one drop of blood till he was opened on the breast, and then the blood spun out so fresh and clear as if it had been a fountain of rubies. His death went to the heart of us, yet we might well judge <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Avis combursitur.</FONT></span>that a naked bird would stand us in little stead. We removed the little altar, and assisted the Virgin to burn the body, together with the little tablet hanging by, to ashes, with fire kindled at the little taper, afterwards to cleanse the same several times, and to lay them in a box of cypress wood. Here I cannot conceal what a trick I, with <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jocus.</FONT></span>three more, was served. After we had diligently taken up the ashes, the Virgin began to speak thus:--"My Lords, we are here in the sixth room, and have only one more before us, in which our trouble will be at an end, and we shall return home to our castle to awaken our most gratious Lords and Ladies. Now albeit I could heartily wish that all of you had behaved yourselves in such sort that I might have given your commendations to our most renowned King and Queen, and you have obtained a suitable reward, yet because, contrary to my desire, I have found amongst you</p>  
<p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></A></p>  
<p>these four"--pointing at me and three others--"lazy and sluggish labourators, and yet according to my good-will to all, I am not willing to deliver them to condign punishment. However, that such negligence may not remain wholly unpunished, I purpose that they shall be excluded from the future seventh and most glorious action of all the rest, and so they shall incur no further blame from their Royal Majesties."</p>  
<p>In what a case we now were I leave others to consider, for the Virgin so well knew how to keep her countenance that the water soon ran over our baskets, and we esteemed ourselves the most unhappy of all men. The Virgin by one of her maids, whereof there were many always at hand, caused the musitians to be fetcht, who were with cornets to blow us out of doors with such scorn and derision that they themselves could hardly sound for laughing. But it did particularly afflict us that the Virgin vehemently laughed at our weeping, and that there might be some amongst our companions who were glad of our misfortune. But it proved otherwise, for as soon as we were come out at the<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Commodum ejoco.</FONT></span> door the musitians bid us be of good cheere, and follow them up the winding staires to the eighth floor under the<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">8. Conclave.</FONT></span> roof, where we found the old man standing upon a little round furnace. He received us friendly, and heartily congratulated us that we were hereto chosen by the Virgin; but after he had understood the fright we had conceived, his belly was ready to burst with laughing that we had taken such good fortune so hainously. "Hence," said he, "my dear sons, learn that man never knoweth how well God intendeth him." The Virgin also came running in, who, after she had sufficiently laughed at us, emptied her ashes into another vessel, filling hers again with other</p>  
<p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Virgo. lucif. ludit c&#339;teros.</FONT></span>matter, saying, she must now cast a mist before the other artist's eyes, that we in the mean time should obey the old lord, and not remit our former diligence. Herewith she <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">7. Conclave.</FONT></span>departed from us into the seventh room, whither she called our companions. What she first did with them I cannot tell, for they were not only most earnestly forbidden to speak of it, but we, by reason of our business, durst not <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Verus labor sub tecto.</FONT></span>peep on them through the cieling. Our work was to moisten the ashes with our fore-prepared water till they became like a very thin dough, after which we set the matter over the fire till it was well heated; then we cast it into two little forms or moulds, and so let it cool a little, when we had leisure to look on our companions through <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Labor spurius in 7 conclavi.</FONT></span>certain crevises in the floor. They were busie at a furnace, and each was himself fain to blow up the fire with a pipe, till he was ready to lose his breath. They imagined they were herein wonderfully preferred before us. This blowing lasted till our old man rouzed us to work again. We opened our little forms, and there appeared two bright and <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Homunculi duo.</FONT></span>almost transparent little images, a male and a female, the like to which man's eye never saw, each being but four inches long, and that which most mightily surprised me was that they were not hard, but limber and fleshy as other human bodies; yet had they no life, so that I assuredly believe that Lady Venus&#8217; image was made after some such way. These angelically fair babes we laid upon two little sattin cushonets, and beheld them till we were almost besotted upon so exquisite an object. The old lord warned us to forbear, and continually to instil the blood of the <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Pascuntur sanguine avis.</FONT></span>bird, which had been received in a little golden cup, drop after drop into the mouths of the little images, from whence they apparently encreased, becoming according to proportion</p>  
<p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></A></p>  
<p>much more beautiful. They grew so big that we lifted them from the little cushonets, and were fain to lay them upon a long table covered with white velvet. The old man commanded us to cover them up to the breast with a piece of fine white double taffata, which, because of<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Pulcherrimus.</FONT></span> their unspeakable beauty, almost went against us. Before we had in this manner quite spent the blood, they were in their perfect full growth, having gold-yellow curled hair, and the figure of Venus was nothing to them. But there was not yet any natural warmth or sensibility in them; they were dead figures, yet of a lively and natural colour; and since care was to be taken that they grew not too great, the old man would not permit anything more to be given them, but covered their faces too with the silk, and caused the table to be stuck round about with torches. Let the reader imagine not these lights to have been of necessity, for the old man's intent was that we should not observe when the Soul entred into them, as indeed we should not have taken notice of it, in case I had not twice before seen the flames. However, I permitted the other three to remain in their belief, neither did the old man know that I had seen anything more. Hereupon he bid us sit down on a bench over against the table. The Virgin came in with the musick and all furniture, and carried two curious white garments, the like to which I had never seen in the Castle. I thought no<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Vestiuntur.</FONT></span> other but that they were meer christal, but they were gentle and not transparent. These she laid upon a table, and after she had disposed her Virgins upon a bench round about, she and the old man began many <i>leger-de-main</i> tricks about the table, which were done only to blind. All this<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Spectatores luduntur.</FONT></span> was managed under the roof, which was wonderfully</p>  
<p><a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 184</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Descriptio tecti.</FONT></span>formed, for on the inside it was arched into seven hemispheres, of which the middlemost was somewhat the highest, and had at top a little round hole, which was shut and was observed by none but myself. After many ceremonies stept in six Virgins, each of which bare a large trumpet, rouled about with a green, glittering, and burning material like a wreath, one of which the old man took, and after he had removed some of the lights at top, and uncovered their faces, he placed one of the trumpets upon the mouth of one of the bodies in such manner that the upper and wider part <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Usus tubarum.</FONT></span>of it was directed towards the fore-mentioned hole. Here my companions always looked upon the images, but as soon as the foliage or wreath about the shank of the trumpet <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Forti ex c&#339;lo venions.</FONT></span>was kindled, I saw the hole at top open and a bright stream of fire shoot down the tube and pass into the body, whereupon the hole was again covered, and the trumpet removed. With this device my companions were deluded into imagining that life came to the image by the fire of the foliage, for as soon as he received his Soul he twinckled his eyes <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Homunculi animati alio transferuntur.</FONT></span>though scarcely stirring. The second time he placed another tube upon its mouth, kindled it again, and the Soul was let down through the tube. This was repeated upon each of them three times, after which all the lights were extinguished and carried away. The velvet carpets of the table were cast together over them, and immediately a travelling bed was unlocked and made ready, into which, thus wrapped up, they were born, and, after the carpets were taken off them, neatly laid by each other, where, with the curtains drawn before them, they slept a good while. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">De. 7 concl.</FONT></span>It was now time for the Virgin to see how the other artists behaved themselves; they were well pleased because they were to work in gold, which is indeed a piece of this art,</p>  
<p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></A></p>  
<p>but not the most principal, necessary, and best. They had too a part of these ashes, so that they imagined that the whole Bird was provided for the sake of gold, and that life must thereby be restored to the deceased. Mean time we sate very still, attending when our married couple would awake, and thus about half an hour was spent. Then the wanton Cupid presented himself, and, after he had saluted<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Homunculi excitantur a cupidine.</FONT></span> us all, flew to them behind the curtain, tormenting them till they waked. This happened to them with very great amazement, for they imagined that they had slept from the hour in which they were beheaded. Cupid, after he had<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Fuerunt illi qui decollabantur.</FONT></span> awaked them, and renewed their acquaintance one with another, stepped aside and permitted them to recruit their strength, mean time playing his tricks with us, and at length he would needs have the musick fetcht to be somewhat the merrier. Not long after the Virgin herself comes, and having most humbly saluted the young King and Queen, who found themselves somewhat faint, and having<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Conjuges induunt vestimenta ut se conspiciendos pr&aelig;beant.</FONT></span> kissed their hands, she brought them the two fore-mentioned curious garments, which they put on, and so stepped forth. There were already prepared two very curious chaires, wherein they placed themselves, and were by us with most profound reverence congratulated, for which the King in his own person most gratiously returned his thanks, and again re-assured us of all grace. It was already about five of clock, wherefore they could make no longer stay; but as soon as ever the chiefest of their furniture could be laden, we were to attend the young Royal Persons down the stairs, through all doors and watches unto the ship, in which they inbarqued, <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Conjuges vehuntur trans mare.</FONT></span> together with certain Virgins and Cupid, and sailed so swiftly that we soon lost sight of them, yet they were met, as I was informed, by certain stately ships, and in four</p>  
<p><a name="page_186"><font size="1" color="green">p. 186</font></A></p>  
<p>hours time had made many leagues out at sea. After five<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Musick.</FONT></span> of clock the musitians were charged to carry all things back to the ships, and to make themselves ready for the voyage, but because this was somewhat long a doing, the<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Custos senex</FONT></span> old lord commanded forth a party of his concealed soldiers, who had hitherto been planted in the wall so that we had<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Turris custodita a militibus.</FONT></span> taken no notice of any of them, whereby I observed that this tower was well guarded against opposition. These soldiers made quick work of our stuff, so that no more remained to be done but to go to supper. The table being compleatly furnished, the Virgin brings us again to our companions, where we were to carry ourselves as if we had truly been in a lamentable condition, while they were always smiling one upon another, though some of them too simpathized <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Custos est inspector.</FONT></span> with us. At this supper the old lord was with us, who was a most sharp inspector over us, for none could propound anything so discreetly but that he knew how to confute or amend it, or at least to give some good document upon it. <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Laus hujus senis.</FONT></span> I learned most by this lord, and it were good that each would apply himself to him, and take notice of his procedure, for then things would not so often and untowardly miscarry. After we had taken our nocturnal refection, the <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">The old man's closets.</FONT></span> old lord led us into his closets of rarities, dispersed among the bulworks, where we saw such wonderful productions of nature, and other things which man's wit in imitation of nature had invented, that we needed a year sufficiently to survey them. Thus we spent a good part of the night by candle-light. At last, because we were more inclined to sleep then see many rarities, we were lodged in rooms in the wall, where we had not only costly good beds but extraordinary handsome chambers, which made us the more wonder why we were forced the day before to undergo</p>  
<p><a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></A></p>  
<p>so many hardships. In this chamber I had good rest, and, being for the most part without care, and weary with continual labour, the gentle rushing of the sea helped me to a sound and sweet sleep, for I continued in one dream from eleven of clock till eight in the morning. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Somnium prolixum.</FONT></span></p>
