*The Second Day*.

I was hardly got out of my cell into a forrest when methought the whole
heaven and all the elements had <span class="margnote">Tripudium
Creaturarum ob nuptias.</span>trimmed themselves against this wedding.
Even the birds chanted more pleasantly then before, and the young fawns
skipped so merrily that they rejoiced my old heart, and moved me also to
sing with such a loud voice throughout <span class="rmargnote">Per
Sylvam.</span>the whole forrest, that it resounded from all parts, the
hills repeating my last words, until at length I espyed a <span
class="margnote">In campam.</span>curious green heath, whither I betook
myself out of the <span class="rmargnote">3 Cedri.</span>forrest. Upon
this heath stood three tall cedars, which <span
class="margnote">3 Templa.</span>afforded an excellent shade, whereat I
greatly rejoyced, for, although I had not gone far, my earnest longing
made me <span class="rmargnote">Tabella mercurialis. 1.</span>faint. As
soon as I came somewhat nigh, I espyed a tablet fastened to one of them,
on which the following words were written in curious letters:--

<span id="img_10800"></span>

God save thee, Stranger! If thou hast heard anything concerning the
nuptials of the King, consider these words. By us doth the Bridegroom
offer thee a choice between foure ways, all of which, if thou dost not
sink down in the way, can bring thee to his royal court. <span
class="margnote">1.</span>The first is short but dangerous, and one
which will lead thee into rocky places, through which it will be
scarcely possible to pass. <span class="rmargnote">2.</span>The second
is longer, and takes thee circuitously; it is plain and easy, if by the
help of the Magnet, thou turnest neither to left nor right. <span
class="margnote">3.</span>The third is that truly royal way which
through various pleasures and pageants of our

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> King, affords thee
a joyful journey; but this so far has scarcely been allotted to one in a
thousand. <span class="margnote">4.</span> By the fourth shall no man
reach the place, because it is a consuming way, practicable onely for
incorruptible bodys. Choose now which thou wilt of the three, and
persevere constantly therein, for know whichsoever thou shalt enter,
that is the one destined for thee by immutable Fate, nor canst thou go
back therein save at great peril to life. These are the things which we
would have thee know, but, ho, beware! thou knowest not with how much
danger thou dost commit thyself to this way, for if thou knowest thyself
by the smallest fault to be obnoxious to the laws of our King, I beseech
thee, while it is still possible, to return swiftly to thy house by the
way which thou earnest.

As soon as I had read this writing all my joy vanished, and I, who
before sang merrily, began inwardly to lament. For although I saw all
three ways before me, and it was<span class="rmargnote">Via authoris
eligenda.</span> vouchsafed me to make choice of one, yet it troubled me
that in case I went the stony and rocky way, I might get a deadly fall;
or, taking the long one, I might wander through bye-ways and be detained
in the great journey. Neither durst I hope that I, amongst thousands,
should be the one who should choose the Royal way. I saw likewise the
fourth before me, but so invironed with fire and exhalation that I durst
not draw near it, and, therefore, again and again considered whether I
should turn back or take<span class="margnote">Dubium.</span> one of the
ways before me. I well weighed my own unworthiness, and though the
dream, that I was delivered out of the tower, still comforted me, yet I
durst not confidently<span class="rmargnote">Comfirmatio.</span> rely
upon it. I was so perplexed that, for great weariness, hunger and thirst
seized me, whereupon I drew out my bread, cut a slice of it, which a
snow-white dove, of whom

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="margnote">Columba alba arbori mercuriali insidens.</span>I was
not aware, sitting upon the tree, espyed and therewith came down,
betaking herself very familiarly to me, to whom I willingly imparted my
food, which she received, and with her prettiness did again a little
refresh me. But <span class="rmargnote">Corvus niger.</span>as soon as
her enemy, a most black Raven, perceived it, he straight darted down
upon the dove, and taking no notice of me, would needs force away her
meat, who could not otherwise guard herself but by flight. Whereupon,
both <span class="margnote">Versus Meridiem.</span>together flew toward
the South, at which I was so hugely incensed and grieved, that without
thinking, I made haste after the filthy Raven, and so, against my will,
ran into one of the fore-mentioned ways a whole field's length. The
Raven being thus chased away, and the Dove delivered, I first observed
what I had inconsiderately done, and that I was <span
class="rmargnote">Autor in cidit in 2 viam incogitanter</span>already
entered into a way, from which, under peril of punishment, I durst not
retire, and though I had still wherewith to comfort myself, yet that
which was worst of all was, that I had left my bag and bread at the
Tree, and could never retrieve them, for as soon as I turned myself
about, a contrary wind was so strong against me that it was ready to
fell me, but if I went forward, I perceived no hindrance, wherefore I
patiently took up my cross, got upon my feet, and resolved I would use
my utmost endeavour to get to my journey's end before night. Now,
although many apparent <span class="margnote">Compassus.</span>byways
showed themselves, I still proceeded with my compass, and would not
budge one step from the meridian line. Howbeit, the way was oftentimes
so rugged that I was in no little doubt of it. I constantly thought upon
the Dove and Raven, and yet could not search out the meaning, until
<span class="rmargnote">Diversorium.</span>upon a high hill afar off I
espyed a stately Portal, to which, <span
class="margnote">Occasus.</span>not regarding that it was distant from
the way I was in, I <span id="img_11000"></span>

|                    |

hasted, because the sun had already hid himself under the

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

hills, and I could elsewhere see no abiding place, which I verily
ascribe only to God, Who might have permitted me to go forward, and
withheld my eyes that so I might have gazed beside this gate, to which I
now made mighty haste, and reached it by so much daylight as to take a
competent view of it. It was an exceeding Royal, beautiful Portal,
whereon were carved a multitude of most noble figures and devices, every
one of which (as I afterwards learned) had its peculiar signification.
Above was fixed a pretty large Tablet, with these words, "*Procul hinc
procul ite profani*," and<span class="margnote">Tabula
inscriptionis.</span> more that I was forbidden to relate. As soon as I
was come unto the portal, there streight stepped forth one in a<span
class="rmargnote">Portitor.</span> sky-coloured habit, whom I saluted in
friendly manner. Though he thankfully returned my greeting, he instantly
demanded my Letter of Invitation. O how glad was I<span
class="margnote">Literæ convocationis.</span> that I had brought it with
me! How easily might I have forgotten it as chanced to others, as he
himself told me. I quickly presented it, wherewith he was not only
satisfied, but showed me abundance of respect, saying, "Come in, my
Brother, an acceptable guest you are to me," withal entreating me not to
withhold my name from him.

Having replied that I was a Brother of the RED ROSIE<span
class="rmargnote">Nomen authoris.</span> CROSS, he both wondred and
seemed to rejoyce at it, and then proceeded thus:--"My brother, have you
nothing about you wherewith to purchase a token?" I answered my ability
was small, but if he saw anything about me he had a mind to, it was at
his service. Having requested of me my bottle of<span
class="margnote">Emitur aqua Tessera.</span> water, and I granting it,
he gave me a golden token, whereon stood these letters, S.C., entreating
me that when it stood<span class="rmargnote">Sanctitati constantia
sponsus charus. Spes charitas.</span> me in good stead, I would remember
him. After which I asked him how many were got in before me, which he
also told me; and lastly, out of meer friendship, gave me a

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

<span class="margnote">Diploma.</span>sealed letter to the second
Porter. Having lingered some time with him, the night grew on, whereupon
a great beacon upon the gate was immediately fired, that if any were
still upon the way, he might make haste thither. The road where it
finished at the castle was enclosed with <span
class="rmargnote">Castillum.</span>walls, and planted with all sorts of
excellent fruit trees. On every third tree on each side lanterns were
hung up, wherein all the candles were lighted with a glorious torch
<span class="margnote">Virgo lucifera.</span>by a beautiful Virgin,
habited in skye-colour, which was so noble and majestic a spectacle that
I delayed longer then <span class="rmargnote">The Lady
Chamberlain</span>was requisite. At length, after an advantageous
instruction, I departed from the first porter, and so went on the way,
until I came to the second gate, which was adorned <span
class="margnote">Porta secunda.  
Tabella.</span>with images and mystick significations. In the affixed
Tablet stood--*Date et dabitur volis*. Under this gate lay a <span
class="rmargnote">Custos Leo.</span>terrible Lyon, chained, who, as soon
as he espied me, arose and made at me with great roaring, whereupon the
second <span class="margnote">2 Portitor.</span>porter, who lay upon a
stone of marble, awaked, and wishing me not to be troubled nor
affrighted, drove back the lyon, and having received the letter, which I
reached him with trembling hand, he read it, and with great respect
spake thus to me:--"Now well-come in God's name unto me the man whom of
long time I would gladly have seen!" Meanwhile, he also drew out a
token, and asked me whether <span class="rmargnote">Tessera empta
sale.</span>I could purchase it. But I, having nothing else left but my
salt, presented it to him, which he thankfully accepted. <span
class="margnote">Studio merentis  
Sal humor  
Sponso mittendus  
Sal mineralis  
Sal menstrualis.</span>Upon this token again stood two letters, namely,
S.M. Being just about to discourse with him, it began to ring in the
castle, whereupon the porter counselled me to run apace, or all the
paines I had taken would serve to no purpose, for the lights above began
already to be extinguished, whereupon I dispatched with much haste

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

that I heeded not the porter; the virgin, after whom all the lights were
put out, was at my heels, and I should never have found the way, had not
she with her torch afforded me some light. I was more-over constrained
to enter the<span class="margnote">Porta clauditur.</span> very next to
her, and the gates were so suddenly clapt to that a part of my coate was
locked out, which I was forced to leave behind me, for neither I nor
they who stood ready without and called at the gate could prevail with
the porter to open it again. He delivered the keys to the virgin, who
took them with her into the court. I again surveyed the gate, which now
appeared so rich that the world could not equal it. Just by the door
were two columns, on one of which<span class="rmargnote">Pyramides
portæ.</span> stood a pleasant figure with this inscription,
*Congratulor*. On the other side was a statue with countenance veiled,
and beneath was written, *Condoleo*. In brief, the inscriptions and
figures thereon were so dark and mysterious that the most dexterous man
could not have expounded them, yet all these I shall e’er long publish
and explain. Under<span class="margnote">Promissum authoris.</span> this
gate I was again to give my name, which was written down in a little
vellum-book, and immediately with the rest dispatched to the Lord
Bridegroom. Here I first received the true guest-token, which was
somewhat less than the former, but much heavier; upon this stood the
letters S. P. N. Besides this, a new pair of shoes were given. me, for
the floor of the castle was pure shining marble. My<span
class="rmargnote">Salus per naturam sponsi præ sentandus nuptiis.</span>
old ones I was to give to one of the poor who sate in throngs under the
gate. I bestowed them on an old man, after which two pages with as many
torches conducted me<span class="margnote">Comes puer.</span> into a
little room, where they willed me to sit down upon a form, and, sticking
their torches in two holes made in the pavement, they departed, and left
me sitting alone. Soon after I heard a noise but saw nothing; it proved
to be certain

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

men who stumbled in upon me, but since I could see nothing I was fain to
suffer and attend what they would do <span
class="margnote">Balneatores.</span>with me. Presently finding that they
were barbers I intreated them not to jostle me, for I was content to do
what they desired, whereupon one of them, whom I yet could not see,
gently cut away the hair from the crown of <span
class="rmargnote">Capillus detonsus asservatus.</span>my head, but on my
forehead, ears, and eyes he permitted my ice-grey locks to hang. In this
first encounter I was ready to despair, for, inasmuch as some of them
shoved me so forceably, and were still invisible, I could onely think
that God for my curiosity had suffered me to miscarry. The unseen
barbers carefully gathered up the hair which <span
class="margnote">Pueri bini.</span>was cut off, and carried it away.
Then the two pages reentered and heartily laughed at me for being so
terrified. They had scarce spoken a few words with me when again a
little bell began to ring, which (as the pages informed me) was to give
notice for assembling, whereupon they willed me to rise, and through
many walks, doors, and winding <span
class="rmargnote">Triclinium.</span>stairs lighted me into a spacious
hall, where there was a great multitude of guests--emperors, kings,
princes, and lords, noble and ignoble, rich and poor, and all sorts of
people, at which I hugely marvelled, and thought to myself, "Ah! how
gross a fool hast thou been to ingage upon this journey with so much
bitterness and toil, when here are fellows whom thou well knowest, and
yet hadst never any reason to esteem, while thou, with all thy prayers
and supplications, art hardly got in at last."

This and more the devil at that time injected. Meantime one or other of
my acquaintance spake to me:--"Oh! Brother Rosencreutz, art thou here
too?" "Yea, my brethren," I replied, "The grace of God hath helped me in
also," at which they raised a mighty laughter, looking upon

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

it as ridiculous that there should be need of God in so slight an
occasion. Having demanded each of them <span class="margnote">Impictas
hostum non recta via ingressorum.</span>concerning his way, and finding
most of them were forced to clamber over the rocks, certain invisible
trumpets began to sound to the table, whereupon all seated themselves,
every one as he judged himself above the rest, so that for me and some
other sorry fellows there was hardly a little nook left at the lowermost
table. Presently the two pages entred, and one of them said grace in so
handsom and excellent a manner as rejoyced the very heart in my body.
<span class="rmargnote">Quidam preces negligunt.</span> Howbeit, some
made but little reckoning of them, but fleired and winked one at
another, biting their lips within their hats, and using like unseemly
gestures. After this, meat was brought in, and, albeit none could be
seen, everything<span class="margnote">Commessatio.</span> was so
orderly managed that it seemed as if every guest had his proper
attendant. Now my Artists having<span class="rmargnote">Ministri
invisibles.</span> somewhat recruted themselves, and the wine having a
little removed shame from their hearts, they presently began to<span
class="margnote">Inebriatorum gloriatio vana</span> vaunt of their
abilities. One would prove this, another that, and commonly the most
sorry idiots made the loudest noise. When I call to mind what
preternatural and impossible enterprises I then heard, I am still ready
to vomit at it. In fine, they never kept in their order, but whenever
possible a rascal would insinuate himself among the nobles. Every man
had his own prate, and yet the great lords were so simple that they
believed their pretences, and the rogues became so audacious, that
although some of them were rapped .over the fingers with a knife, yet
they flinched not at it, but when any one perchance had filched a
gold-chain, then would all hazard for the like. I saw one who heard the
movements of the Heavens, the second could see Plato's Ideas, a third
could number the atoms of Democritus.

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> There were not a
few pretenders to perpetual motion. Many an one (in my opinion) had good
understanding, but assumed too much to himself to his own destruction.
Lastly, there was one who would needs persuade us that he saw the
servitors who attended, and would have pursued his contention, had not
one of those invisible <span class="margnote">Ministri
invisibles.</span>waiters reached him so handsom a cuff upon his lying
muzzle, that not only he, but many who were by him, became mute as mice.
It best of all pleased me that those of whom I had any esteem were very
quiet in their business, <span class="rmargnote">Modestia proborum
hospitum.</span>acknowledging themselves to be misunderstanding men for
whom the mysteries of nature were too high. In this tumult I had almost
cursed the day wherein I came hither, for I could not but with anguish
behold that those lewd people were above at the board, but I in my sorry
place could not even rest in quiet, one of these rascals scornfully
reproaching me for a motley fool. I dreamed not that there was one gate
behind through which we must pass, but imagined during the whole wedding
I was to continue in this scorn and indignity which I had at no time
deserved, either of the Lord Bride-groom or the Bride. And, therefore, I
opined he would have done well to seek <span
class="margnote">Impatientia ex iniquitate hominum.</span>some other
fool than me for his wedding. To such impatience doth the iniquity of
this world reduce simple hearts. But this was really one part of the
lameness whereof I had dreamed.

The longer all this clamour lasted, the more it increased. <span
class="rmargnote">Assessor modestus.</span>Howbeit, there sate by me a
very fine, quiet man, who discoursed of excellent matters, and at length
said:--"My Brother, if any one should come now who were willing to
instruct these blockish people in the right way, would he be heard?"
"No, verily," I replyed. "The world," said

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

he, "is now resolved to be cheated, and will give no ear to<span
class="margnote">Mundus valt decipi.</span> those who intend its good.
Seest thou that Cock's-comb, with what whimsical figures and foolish
conceits he allures others. There one makes mouths at the people with
unheard-of mysterious words. Yet the time is now coming when those
shameful vizards shall be plucked off, and the world shall know what
vagabond imposters were concealed behind them. Then perhaps that will be
valued which at present is not esteemed."

While he was thus speaking, and the clamour was still increasing, all on
a sudden there began in the hall such excellent and stately musick of
which, all the days of my life, I<span class="rmargnote">Musica.</span>
never heard the like. Every one held his peace, and attended what would
come of it. There were all stringed instruments imaginable, sounding
together in such harmony that I forgot myself, and sate so unmovably
that those by me were amazed. This lasted nearly half an hour, wherein
none of us spake one word, for as soon as anyone was about to open his
mouth, he got an unexpected blow. <span class="margnote">Mulctæ ab
attendentium</span> After that space this musick ceased suddenly, and
presently before the door of the hall began a great sounding and beating
of trumpets, shalms, and kettle-drums, all so master-like as if the
Emperor of Rome had been entring. The door opened of itself, and then
the noise of the trumpets was so loud that we were hardly able to indure
it. Meanwhile, many thousand small tapers came into the hall, <span
class="rmargnote">Faculæ ad lectum.</span> marching of themselves in so
exact an order as amazed us, till at last the two fore-mentioned pages
with bright torches entred lighting in a most beautiful Virgin,
drawn<span class="margnote">Virgo lucifera.</span> on a gloriously
gilded, triumphant self-moving throne. She seemed to me the same who on
the way kindled and<span class="rmargnote">The Lady Chamberlain</span>
put out the lights, and that these her attendants were the

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="margnote">Albedo.</span>very ones whom she formerly placed
at the trees. She was not now in skye-colour, but in a snow-white,
glittering robe, which sparkled of pure gold, and cast such a lustre
that we durst not steadily behold it. Both the pages were after the same
manner habited, albeit somewhat more slightly. As soon as they were come
into the middle of the hall, and were descended from the throne, all the
small tapers made obeisance, before her, whereupon we all stood up, and
she having to us, as we again to her, shewed all <span
class="rmargnote">Salutatoria hospitum.</span>respect and reverence, in
a most pleasant tone she began thus to speak:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"The King my Lord most gracious,  
Who now 's not very far from us,  
As also his most lovely Bride,  
To him in troth and honour tied,  
Already, with great joy indued,  
Have your arrival hither view’d;  
And do to every one and all  
Promise their grace in special;  
And from their very heart's desire  
You may the same in time acquire,  
That so their future nuptial joy  
May mixed he with none's annoy."</span>

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hereupon, with all
her small tapers, she again courteously bowed, and presently began
thus:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"In th’ Invitation writ you know<span
class="margnote">Propositio actionis.</span>  
That no man called was hereto  
Who of God's rarest gifts good store  
Had not received long before.  
Although we cannot well conceit  
That any man's so desperate,  
Under conditions so hard,  
Here to intrude without regard,  
Unless he have been first of all  
Prepared for this Nuptial,  
And, therefore, in good hopes do dwell  
That with all you it will be well; <span id="page_119">p. 119</span>  
Yet men are grown so bold and rude,  
Not weighing their ineptitude,  
As still to thrust themselves in place  
Whereto none of them called was.  
No cock's-comb here himself may sell,  
No rascal in with others steal,  
For we resolve without all let  
A Wedding pure to celebrate.  
So, then, the artists for to weigh,<span class="margnote">Probatio
artificum</span>  
Scales shall be fixt th’ ensuing day;  
Whereby each one may lightly find  
What he hath left at home behind.  
If here be any of that rout,  
Who have good cause themselves to doubt,  
Let him pack quickly hence aside,  
Because in case he longer bide,  
Of grace forelorn, and quite undone,  
Betimes he must the gantlet run.  
If any now his conscience gall,  
He shall to-night be left in th’ hall,  
And be again releast by morn,  
Yet so he hither ne’er return.  
If any man have confidence,  
He with his waiter may go hence,  
Who shall him to his chamber light,  
Where he may rest in peace to-night."</span>

</div>

As soon as she had done speaking, she again made reverence, and sprung
chearfully into her throne, after which the trumpets began again to
sound, and conducted her invisibly away, but the most part of the small
tapers remained, and still one of them accompanied each of us. In our
perturbation, ’tis scarcely possible to express what pensive thoughts
and gestures were amongst us, yet most part resolved to await the scale,
and in case things sorted not well to depart (as they hoped) in peace. I
had soon<span class="margnote">Autor humiliat se.</span> cast up my
reckoning, and seeing my conscience convinced me of all ignorance and
unworthiness, I purposed to stay with the rest in the hall, and chose
rather to content myself

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

with the meal I had taken than to run the risk of a future repulse.
After every one by his small taper had been severally conducted to a
chamber (each, as I since understood, into a peculiar one), there staid
nine of us, including he who discoursed with me at the table. Although
our small tapers left us not, yet within an hour's time one of the pages
came in, and, bringing a great bundle of cords with him, first demanded
whether we had concluded to stay there, which when we had with sighs
affirmed, he bound each of us in a several place, and so went away with
our tapers, leaving us poor wretches in darkness. Then first began some
to perceive the imminent danger, and myself could not refrain tears,
for, although we were not forbidden to speak, anguish and affliction
suffered none of us to utter one word. The cords were so wonderfully
made that none could cut them, much less get them off his feet, yet this
comforted me, that the future gain of many an one who had now betaken
himself to rest would prove little to his satisfaction, but we by one
night's pennance might expiate all our presumption. At length in my
sorrowful thoughts I fell asleep, during which I had a <span
class="margnote">Somnium typicum.</span>dream which I esteem not
impertinent to recount. Methought I was upon an high mountain, and saw
before me <span class="rmargnote">What will be the issue of the
probatory beam? He that climbs high hath a great fall.</span>a great
valley, wherein were gathered an unspeakable multitude, each of whom had
at his head a string by which he was hanging. Now one hung high, another
low, some stood even quite upon the earth. In the air there flew up and
down an ancient man, who had in his hand a pair of sheers, wherewith
here he cut one's and there another's thread. Now he that was nigh the
earth fell without noise, but when this happened to the high ones the
earth quaked at their fall. To some it came to pass that their thread

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

was so stretched they came to the earth before it was cut I took
pleasure at this tumbling, and it joyed me at the heart when he who had
over-exalted himself in the air, of his wedding, got so shameful a fall
that it carried even some of his neighbours along with him. In like
manner it rejoyced me that he who had kept so near the earth could come
down so gently that even his next men perceived it not. But in my
highest fit of jollity, I was unawares jogged by one of my
fellow-captives, upon which I<span class="margnote">Experget.</span>
waked and was much discontented with hint. Howbeit, I considered my
dream and recounted it to my brother, who lay by me on the other side,
and who hoped some comfort might thereby be intended. In such discourse
we spent the remaining part of the night, and with longing expected the
day.
