<p align="center"><i>The Seventh Day</i>.</p>  
<p>After eight of clock I awaked, and quickly made myself ready, being desirous to return again into the tower, but the dark passages in the wall were so many that I wandered a good while before I could find the way out. The same happened to the rest, till we all meet in the nethermost <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Hospites deponunt vestes lugubres.</FONT></span> vault, and habits intirely yellow were given us, together with our golden fleeces. At that time the Virgin declared o us that we were Knights of the <A NAME="img_18700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/18700.jpg" ALT="Golden Stone">, of which <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Salutantur equites.</FONT></span> we were before ignorant. After we had made ourselves ready, and taken our breakfast, the old man presented each <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Donantur a sene.</FONT></span> of us with a medal of gold. On the one side stood these words--</p>  
<p align="center">AR. NAT. MI.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Ars natur&aelig; ministra.</FONT></span></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> On the other these,</p>  
<p align="center">TEM. NA. F.<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Temporis natura filia.</FONT></span></p>  
<p>exhorting us to enterprize nothing beyond and against this token of remembrance. Herewith we went forth to the sea, where our ships lay so richly equipped that it was not well possible but that such brave things must first have been brought thither. The ships were twelve in number, six of ours and six of the old lord's, who caused his to be freighted with well-appointed soldiers. But he betook himself to us in our ship, where we were all together. In<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Navis, 1.</FONT></span> the first the musitians seated themselves, of which the old</p>  
<p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></A></p>  
<p>lord had also a great number. They sailed before us to <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Vexilla 12 sign. Navi autoris libra, Horolog.</FONT></span>shorten the time. Our flags were the twelve celestial signs, and we sate in Libra. Besids other things our ship had a noble and curious clock which showed us all the minutes. The sea was so calm that it was a singular pleasure to sail, but that which surpassed all was the old man's discourse, who so well knew how <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Facundia senis.</FONT></span>to pass away our time with wonderful histories that I could have been content to sail with him all my life long. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Obviatio ex arce.</FONT></span>The ships passed on, and before we had sailed two hours the mariner told us that he saw the whole lake almost covered with ships, by which we conjectured they were come out to meet us, which proved true, for as soon as we were gotten out of the sea into the lake of the forementioned <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">500 naves.</FONT></span>river, there stood in to us five hundred ships, one of which sparkled with gold and pretious stones, and in it sate the King and Queen, with lords, ladies, and virgins of high birth. As soon as they were well in ken of us the pieces were discharged on both sides, and there was such a din of <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Applansus.</FONT></span>trumpets, shalms, and kettle-drums, that all the ships upon the sea capered again. As soon as we came near, they brought about our ships together and so made a stand. <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Atlas oratione excipit hospices.</FONT></span>Old Atlas stepped forth on the King's behalf, making a short but handsom oration, wherein he wellcomed us, and demanded whether the royal Presents were in readiness. The rest of my companions were in an huge amazement whence this King should arise, for they imagined no other but that they must again awaken him. We suffered them to continue in their wonderment, and carried ourselves as <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Atlanti respondet senex.</FONT></span>if it seemed strange to us too. After Atlas' oration out steps our old man, making somewhat a larger reply, wherein he wished the King and Queen all happiness and increase,</p>  
<p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></A></p>  
<p>after which he delivered a curious small casket, but what was in it I know not. It was committed to the custody of<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Regiis conjugibus donum affect Cupido.</FONT></span> Cupid, who hovered between them both. After the oration they again let off a joyful volle of shot, and so we sailed on a good time together, till we arrived at another shore, near the first gate at which I first entred. At this place there attended a great multitude of the King's family, together with some hundreds of horses. As soon as we were come to shore and disembarqued, the King and Queen presented their hands to all of us, one with another, with singular kindness, and so we were to get up on horseback. Here I desire to have the reader friendly entreated not to interpret the following narration to any vain glory of mine, but to credit me that had there been not a special necessity in it, I could well have concealed the honour which was shewed me. We were all distributed amongst<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Honor delatus autori cum sene equitat juxta Regem.</FONT></span> the lords, but our old lord and I, most unworthy, were to ride even with the King, each of us bearing a snow-white ensign with a Red Cross. I indeed was made use of because of my age, for we both had long grey beards and hair. I had besides fastened my tokens round about my hat, of which the young King soon took notice, and demanded if I were he who could at the gate redeem these tokens. I answered yes in the most humble manner, but he laughed on me, saying there henceforth needed no ceremony, I was ms Father. Then he asked me wherewith<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Pater.</FONT></span> I had redeemed them. I answered, "With Water<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Tesseras solvit sale et aqua.</FONT></span> and Salt," whereupon he wondred who had made me so wise, upon which I grew somewhat more confident, and recounted how it had happened to me with my Bread, the Dove, and the Raven; he was pleased with it, and said expressly, that it must needs be that God had herein</p>  
<p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></A></p>  
<p>vouchsafed me a singular happiness. Herewith we came to the first gate, where the porter with the blew cloaths waited, bearing in his hand a supplication. As soon as he spied me even with the king, he delivered me the supplication, most humbly beseeching me to mention his ingenuity before me towards the King; so, in the first place, I <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Primus custos. Ob, visam venerem factus portitor.</FONT></span>demanded of his majesty what the condition of this porter was, who friendly answered me, that he was a very famous and rare astrologer, always in high regard with the Lord his Father, but having on a time committed a fault against Venus, and beheld her in her bed of rest, this punishment was imposed upon him, that he should so long wait at the gate till some one should release him from thence. I <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Autor ejusdem delicterus traditur &agrave; portitore.</FONT></span>replyed, "May he then be released?" "Yes," said the King, "if anyone can be Found that hath as highly transgressed as himself, he must stand in his stead, and the other shall be free. This word went to my heart; conscience convinced me that I was the offender, yet I held my peace and delivered the supplication. As soon as the King had read it, he was mightily terrified, so that the Queen, who, with our virgins and that other queen whom I mentioned at the hanging of the weights, rid behind us, asked him what the letter might signifie; but he, putting up the paper, began to discourse of other matters, till in about three hours we came quite to the Castle, where we alighted and waited upon the <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Actes in Arce.</FONT></span>King into his hall, who called immediately for the old Atlas to come to him in a little closet, and showed him the writing. Atlas made no long tarrying, but rid out to the porter to take better cognizance of the matter, after which the young King, with his spouse and other Lords, Ladies, and Virgins <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Virg. lucif.</FONT></span>sate down. Then began our Virgin highly to commend the diligence we had used, and the pains and labour we had undergone,</p>  
<p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></A></p>  
<p>requesting we might be royally rewarded, and that she henceforward might be permitted to enjoy the benefit of her commission. The old lord stood up too, and attested the truth of all that the Virgin had spoken, and that it was but equity that we should on both parts be contented. Hereupon we were to step out a little; it was concluded that each man should make some possible wish, and were to consider of it till after supper. Meantime the King and<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Ludus Regis um Regina.</FONT></span> Queen, for recreation's sake, began to play together. It looked not unlike chesse, only it had other laws, for it was the vertues and vices one against another, where it might be ingeniously observed with what plots the vices lay in wait for the vertues, and how to re encounter them again. This was so properly and artificially performed that it were<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Artificios.</FONT></span> to be wished that we had the like game too. During the game in comes Atlas again, and makes his report in private, yet I blushed all over, for my conscience gave me no rest. The King presented me the supplication to read, the contents<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Supplicatio portitoris traditum autori.</FONT></span> whereof were to this purpose: First, the writer wished the King prosperity and peace, and that his seed might be spread far and wide. Afterwards he remonstrated that the time was now come wherein, according to the royal promise, he ought to be released; because Yen us was already uncovered by one of his guests, for his observations could not lie <A HREF="errata.htm#1">to</A> him, and that if his Majesty would please to make strict and diligent enquiry, in case this should not prove to be, he would remain before the gate all the days of his life. Then he humbly sued that, upon peril of body and life, he might be present at this night's supper, being in good hopes to spye out the offender and obtain his wished freedom. This was handsomly indited, and I could well perceive his</p>  
<p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></A></p>  
<p>ingenuity, but it was too sharp for me, and I could well have endured never to have seen it. Casting in my mind whether he might perchance be helped through my wish, I asked the King whether he might not be released some other way, but he replyed no, because there was special consideration in the business, but for this night we might gratifie his desire, so he sent one forth to fetch him in. <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Triclinium preciosissimum.</FONT></span>Mean time the tables were prepared in a spatious room, in which we had never before been, which was so compleat that it is not possible for me to describe it. Into this we <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Cupido iratus ob venerem visam ab autore.</FONT></span>were conducted with singular ceremony. Cupid was not present, for the disgrace which had happened to his mother had somewhat angered him. In brieff, my offence, and the supplication which had been delivered, were the occasion of much sadness, for the King was in perplexity how to make <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Etiam Rex condolet.</FONT></span>inquisition amongst his guests. He caused the porter himself to make his strict surveigh, and showed himself as <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">L&aelig;titia discumbentium.</FONT></span>pleasant as he was able. Howbeit, at length they began again to be merry, and to bespeak one another with all sorts of recreative, profitable discourses. The treatment and other ceremonies then performed it is not necessary to declare, since it is neither the reader's concern nor serviceable to my design, but all exceeded more in invention than that we were overcharged with drinking. This was the last and noblest meal at which I was present. After the bancket the tables were suddainly taken away, and certain curious chairs placed round in circle, in which we, together with the King and Queen, both their old men, the Ladies and Virgins, were to sit. After this a very handsom Page <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Post c&#339;nam obligantur equites legibus suis.</FONT></span>opened the above mentioned glorious little book, when Atlas, immediately placing himself in the midst, bespoke</p>  
<p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></A></p>  
<p>us to the ensuing purpose:--That his Royal Majesty had not yet committed to oblivion the service we had done him, and therefore by way of retribution had elected each of us Knights of the Golden Stone. That it was, therefore, further necessary not only once again to, oblige ourselves towards his Royal Majesty, but to vow upon the following articles, and then His Royal Highness would likewise know how to behave himself towards his high people. Upon which he caused the Page to read over these articles:--</p>  
<p>I. You, my Lords the Knights, shall swear that you will at no time ascribe your order either unto any Devil or Spirit, but only to God, your Creator, and His hand-maid Nature.</p>  
<p>II. That you will abominate all whoredom, incontinency, and uncleanness, and not defile your order with such vices.</p>  
<p>III. That you, through your talents, will be ready to assist all that are worthy and have need of them.</p>  
<p>IV. That you desire not to employ this honour to worldly pride and high authority.</p>  
<p>V. That you shall not be willing to live longer than God will have you.</p>  
<p>At this last article we could not choose but laugh, and it may well have been placed there for a conceit. Now, being<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Privilegia.</FONT></span> sworn them all by the King's scepter, we were afterwards, with the usual ceremonies, installed Knights, and, amongst other privileges, set over ignorance, poverty, and sickness, to handle them at our pleasure. This was afterwards ratified in a little chappel, whither we were conducted in procession, and thanks returned to God for it. There I also at that time, to the honour of God, hung up my golden fleece</p>  
<p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></A></p>  
<p>and hat, and left them for an eternal memorial. And because every one was to write his name there, I writ thus:--</p>  
<p align="center"><i>Summa Scientia nihil Scire</i>,<br> <i>Fr</i>. CHRISTIANUS ROSENCREUTZ.<br> <i>Eques aurei Lapidis</i>.<br> <i>Anno</i>. 1459.</p>  
<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Jam postulantur depositiones optionum.</FONT></span><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Others writ differently, each as seemed him good; after which we were again brought into the hall, where, being sate down, we were admonished quickly to bethink ourselves what every one would wish. The King and his party retired into a little closet to give audience to our wishes. Each man was called in severally, so that I cannot speak of any man's proper wish; but I thought nothing could be more praiseworthy than, in honour of my order, to demonstrate some laudable vertue, and found that none at present could be more famous and cost me more trouble than gratitude; wherefore, not regarding that I <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Autor optat liberationem portitoris e gratitudine.</FONT></span>might well have wished somewhat more agreeable to myself, I vanquished myself, and concluded, even with my own peril, to free the porter, my benefactor. Being called in, I was first demanded whether, having read the supplication, I had suspected nothing concerning the offendor, upon which I began undauntedly to relate how all the business had passed, how, through ignorance, I fell into that mistake, and so offered myself to undergo all that I had <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Autor reus confitens.</FONT></span>thereby demerited. The King and the rest of the Lords wondred mightily at so un-hoped for confession, and wished me to step aside a little; and as soon as I was called in again, Atlas declared to me that, although it were grievous to the King's Majesty that I, whom he loved above others, was fallen into such a mischance, yet, because it was not</p>  
<p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></A></p>  
<p>possible for him to transgress his ancient usages, he knew not how else to absolve me but that the other must be at liberty and I placed in his stead; yet he would hope that some other would soon be apprehended, that so I might be able to go home again. However, no release was to be hoped for till the marriage feast of his future son. This<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Audit sententiam.</FONT></span> sentence near cost me my life, and I first hated myself and my twatling tongue in that I could not hold my peace; yet at last I took courage, and, because I considered there was no remedy, I related how this porter had bestowed a token on me and commended me to the other, by whose assistance I stood upon the scale, and so was made partaker of all the honour and joy already received. And therefore now it was equal that I should show<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Laus beneficii portitoris.</FONT></span> myself grateful to my benefactor, and was willing gently to sustain inconvenience for his sake, who had been helpful to me in coming to so high place; but if by my wish anything might be effected, I wished myself at home again, and that so he by me, as I by my wish, might be at liberty. Answer was made me, that the wishing stretched not so far, <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Laudatur &agrave; Rege</FONT></span> yet it was very pleasing to his Royal Majesty that I had behaved myself so generously, but he was affraid I might still be ignorant into what a miserable condition I had plunged myself through this curiosity. Hereupon the good man was pronounced free, and I, with a sad heart, was fain to step aside. The rest were called for after me, <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Reliqui l&aelig;ti evadunt.</FONT></span> and came jocundly out again, which was still more to my smart, for I imagined no other but that I must finish my life under the gate. I had also many pensive thoughts<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Autor melancholiat.</FONT></span> running in my head as to what I should yet undertake, and wherewith to spend the time. At length I considered that<span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Spes. Metus.</FONT></span> I was now old, and, according to the course of Nature, had</p>  
<p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></A></p>  
<p>few more years to live, that this anguish and melancholy life would easily dispatch me, and then my doorkeeping would be at an end, and that by a most happy sleep I <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Solatium.</FONT></span>might quickly bring myself into the grave. Sometimes it vexed me that I had seen such gallant things, and must be robbed of them; sometimes it rejoyced me that before my end I had been accepted to all joy, and should not be forced so shamefully to depart. Thus this was the last and worst shock that I sustained. During these my cogitations the rest were ready, wherefore, after they had received a good night from the King and Lords, each was conducted into his lodging, but I, most wretched man, had nobody to show me the way, and yet must suffer myself to be tormented. That I might be certain of my future function, I was fain to put on the Ring which the other had worn. Finally, <span class="rmargnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Autor accipit annulum.</FONT></span>the King exhorted me that, since this was the last time I was like to see him in this manner, I should behave myself according to my place, and not against the Order, upon which he took me in his arms and kissed me, all which I understood as if in the morning I must sit at my gate. After they had all spoken friendly to me, and at last presented their hands, committing me to the divine protection, I was by both the old men--the Lord of the Tower and <span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Auter dormit cum atlante &amp; sene custode Turris.</FONT></span>Atlas--conducted into a glorious lodging, in which stood three beds, and each of us lay in one of them, where we yet spent almost two, &amp;c.</p>  
<p><i>Here are wanting about two leaves in quarto, and he (the author hereof), whereas he imagined he must in the morning be door-keeper, returned home</i>.</p>
