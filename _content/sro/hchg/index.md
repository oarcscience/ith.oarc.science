In the 13th century, over a few decades, a huge literature emerged
around an unlikely tale. Survivors of the core of early Christianity
make a perilous journey to Western Europe. They begin a hidden
bloodline, preserve immensely powerful relics of the crucifixion, and
carry a secret which, if revealed, would turn the established church on
its head. If this seems like *déjà vu*, it is.

A.E. Waite gets to the core of the Grail legend, an interwoven mass of
narratives which started with seeds of pagan folklore and grew into a
massive allegorical Christian epic. This 700 page book will satisfy both
the academic reader who wants a survey of the Grail literature, and the
more mystically inclined who seek the Grail itself. Waite examines in
great detail every known source text for the Grail legend. His literate
style makes interesting reading for well-educated readers, despite the
repeating themes and story lines. Unlike some of the other writers on
this topic, Waite is organized, focused, and not hesitant to turn a
critical eye on half-baked theories.

In the last two hundred pages, he attempts to make some sense of it all.
He examines and dismisses 19th century theories which linked the Grail
to the Templars, or Masons, as well as the unorthodox Cathars,
Albigensians and Waldensians of Southern France. His conclusion is that
there is an 'inner church' in Christianity: not a conspiracy or a
subterranean sect, but a mystical core. Instead, Waite's concept of the
hidden church is based on a deep comprehension of the sacrament of
communion, and the Holy Grail is symbolic of this.

Waite published this *magnum opus* about the time that he (with Pamela
Smith) was putting the finishing touches on his [Tarot
deck](../../tarot/index). A close read of this book will illuminate much
of the Waite Tarot deck symbolism.
