<p>IN the mean time a third crusade had been preached in Europe. William, archbishop of Tyre, had proceeded to the courts of France and England, and had represented in glowing colours the miserable condition of Palestine, and the horrors and abominations which had been committed by the infidels in the holy city</p>

The English and French monarchs laid aside their private animosities, and agreed to fight under the same banner against the infidels, and towards the close of the month of May, in the second year of the siege of Acre, the royal fleets of Philip Augustus and Richard C&#339;ur de Lion floated in triumph in the bay of Acre. At the period of the arrival of king Richard the Templars had again lost their Grand Master, and Brother Robert de Sabl&eacute;, or Sabloil, a valiant knight of the order, who had commanded a division of the English fleet on the voyage out, was placed at the head of the fraternity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_220"></A><A HREF="#fn_220"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">ROBERT DE<br> SABL&Eacute;<br> A.D. 1191.</FONT></span> The proudest of the nobility, and the most valiant of the chivalry of Europe, on their arrival in Palestine, manifested an eager desire to fight under the banner of the Temple. Many secular knights were permitted by the Grand Master to take their station by the side of the military friars, and even to wear the red cross on their breasts whilst fighting in the ranks.</p>  
<p>The Templars performed prodigies of valour; "The name of their reputation, and the fame of their sanctity," says James of Vitry, bishop of Acre, "like a chamber of perfume sending forth a sweet odour, was diffused throughout the entire world, and all the congregation of the saints will recount their battles and glorious triumph over the enemies of Christ, knights indeed from all parts of the earth, dukes, and princes, after their example, casting off the shackles of the world, and renouncing the pomps and vanities of this life and all the lusts of the flesh for Christ's sake, hastened to join them, and to participate in their holy profession and religion."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_221"></A><A HREF="#fn_221"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>

The Templars took possession of three localities within the city by the side of the sea, where they established their famous Temple, which became from thenceforth the chief house of the order. Richard C&#339;ur de Lion, we are told, took up his abode with the Templars, whilst Philip resided in the citadel.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_222"></A><A HREF="#fn_222"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When the fiery monarch of England tore down the banner of the duke of Austria from its staff and threw it into the ditch, it was the Templars who, interposing between the indignant Germans and the haughty Britons, preserved the peace of the christian army.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_223"></A><A HREF="#fn_223"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>During his voyage from Messina to Acre, King Richard had revenged himself on Isaac Comnenus, the ruler of the island of Cyprus, for the insult offered to the beautiful Berengaria, princess of Navarre, his betrothed bride. The sovereign of England had disembarked his troops, stormed the town of Limisso, and conquered the whole island; and shortly after his arrival at Acre, he sold it to the Templars for three hundred thousand livres d&#8217;or.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_224"></A><A HREF="#fn_224"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>During the famous march of Richard C&#339;ur de Lion from Acre to Ascalon, the Templars generally led the van of the christian army, and the Hospitaliers brought up the rear.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_225"></A><A HREF="#fn_225"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A> Saladin, at</p>

On some occasions C&#339;ur de Lion himself, at the head of a chosen body of knights, led the van, and the Templars were formed into a rear-guard.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_226"></A><A HREF="#fn_226"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> They sustained immense loss, particularly in horses, which last calamity, we are told, rendered them nearly desperate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_227"></A><A HREF="#fn_227"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Moslem as well as the christian writers speak with admiration of the feats of heroism performed. "On the sixth day," says Bohadin, "the sultan rose at dawn as usual, and heard from his brother that the enemy were in motion. They had slept that night in suitable places about C&aelig;sarea, and were now dressing and taking their food. A second messenger announced that they had begun their march; our brazen drum was sounded, all were alert, the sultan came out, and I accompanied him: he surrounded them with chosen troops, and gave the signal for attack." . . . . . . "Their foot soldiers were covered with thick-strung pieces of cloth, fastened together with rings so as to resemble coats of mail. I saw with my own eyes several who had not one nor two but <i>ten darts sticking in their backs!</i> and yet marched on with a calm and cheerful step, without any trepidation!"&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_228"></A><A HREF="#fn_228"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Every exertion was made to sustain the courage and enthusiasm of the christian warriors. When the army halted for the night, and the soldiers were about to take their rest, a loud voice was heard from the midst of the camp, exclaiming, "ASSIST THE HOLY SEPULCHRE," which words were repeated by the leaders of the host, and were echoed and re-echoed along their extended lines.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_229"></A><A HREF="#fn_229"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A></p>

They frequently started off at midnight, swept the country with their turcopoles or light cavalry, and returned to the camp at morning's dawn with rich prizes of oxen, sheep, and provisions.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_230"></A><A HREF="#fn_230"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>In the great plain near Ramleh, when the Templars led the van of the christian army, Saladin made a last grand effort to arrest their progress, which was followed by one of the greatest battles of the age. Geoffrey de Vinisauf, the companion of King Richard on this expedition, gives a lively and enthusiastic description of the appearance of the Moslem array in the great plain around Jaffa and Ramleh. On all sides, far as the eye could reach, from the sea-shore to the mountains, nought was to be seen but a forest of spears, above which waved banners and standards innumerable. The wild Bedouins,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_231"></A><A HREF="#fn_231"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> the children of the desert, mounted on their fleet Arab mares, coursed with the rapidity of the lightning over the vast plain, and darkened the air with clouds of missiles. Furious and unrelenting, of a horrible aspect, with skins blacker than soot, they strove by rapid movement and continuous assaults to penetrate the well-ordered array of the christian warriors. They advanced to the attack with horrible screams and bellowings, which, with the deafening noise of the trumpets, horns, cymbals, and brazen kettle-drums,</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">ROBERT DE<br> SABL&Eacute;<br> A.D. 1191.</FONT></span>produced a clamour that resounded through the plain, and would have drowned even the thunder of heaven.</p>  
<p>The engagement commenced with the left wing of the Hospitallers, and the victory of the Christians was mainly owing to the personal prowess of King Richard. Amid the disorder of his troops, Saladin remained on the plain without lowering his standard or suspending the sound of his brazen kettle-drums, he rallied his forces, retired upon Ramleh, and prepared to defend the road leading to Jerusalem. The Templars and Hospitaliers, when the battle was over, went in search of Jacques d&#8217;Asvesnes, one of the most valiant of King Richard's knights, whose dead body, placed on their spears, they brought into the camp amid the tears and lamentations of their brethren.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_232"></A><A HREF="#fn_232"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The Templars, on one of their foraging expeditions, were surrounded by a superior force of four thousand Moslem cavalry; the Earl of Leicester, with a chosen body of English, was sent by C&#339;ur de Lion to their assistance, but the whole party was overpowered and in danger of being cut to pieces, when Richard himself hurried to the scene of action with his famous battle-axe, and rescued the Templars from their perilous situation.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_233"></A><A HREF="#fn_233"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> By the valour and exertions of the lion-hearted king, the city of Gaza, the ancient fortress of the order, which had been taken by Saladin soon after the battle of Tiberias, was recovered to the christian arms, the fortifications were repaired, and the place was restored to the Knights Templars, who again garrisoned it with their soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">ROBERT DE<br> SABL&Eacute;<br> A.D. 1192.</FONT></span>As the army advanced, Saladin fell back towards Jerusalem, and the vanguard of the Templars was pushed on to the small town of Ramleh.</p>  
<p>At midnight of the festival of the Holy Innocents, a party of them sallied out of the camp in company with some Hospitaliers on a foraging expedition; they scoured the mountains in the direction of Jerusalem, and at morning's dawn returned to Ramleh with more than two hundred oxen.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_234"></A><A HREF="#fn_234"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When the christian army went into winter quarters, the Templars established themselves at Gaza, and King Richard and his army were stationed in the neighbouring town of Ascalon, the walls and houses of which were rebuilt by the English monarch during the winter. Whilst the christian forces were reposing in winter quarters, an arrangement was made between the Templars, King Richard, and Guy de Lusignan, "the king without a kingdom," for the cession to the latter of the island of Cyprus, previously sold by Richard to the order of the Temple, by virtue of which arrangement, Guy de Lusignan took possession of the island and ruled the country by the magnificent title of emperor.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_235"></A><A HREF="#fn_235"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>When the winter rains had subsided, the christian forces were again put in motion, but both the Templars and Hospitallers strongly advised C&#339;ur de Lion not to march upon Jerusalem, and the latter appears to have had no strong inclination to undertake the siege of the holy city, having manifestly no chance of success. The English monarch declared that he would be guided by the advice of the Templars and Hospitallers, who were acquainted with the country, and were desirous of recovering their ancient inheritances. The army, however, advanced within a day's journey of the holy city, and then a council was called</p>

<p>The Templars took part in the attack upon the great Egyptian convoy, wherein four thousand and seventy camels, five hundred horses, provisions, tents, arms, and clothing, and a great quantity of gold and silver, were captured, and then fell back upon Acre; they were followed by Saladin, who immediately commenced offensive operations, and laid siege to Jaffa. The Templars marched by land to the relief of the place, and C&#339;ur de Lion hurried by sea. Many valiant exploits were performed, the town was relieved, and the campaign was concluded by the ratification of a treaty whereby the Christians were to enjoy the privilege of visiting Jerusalem as pilgrims. Tyre, Acre, and Jaffa, with all the sea-coast between them, were yielded to the Latins, but it was stipulated that the fortifications of Ascalon should be demolished.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_237"></A><A HREF="#fn_237"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>After the conclusion of this treaty, King Richard being anxious to take the shortest and speediest route to his dominions by traversing the continent of Europe, and to travel in disguise to avoid the malice of his enemies, made an arrangement with his friend Robert de Sabl&eacute;, the Grand Master of the Temple, whereby the latter undertook to place a galley of the order at the disposal of the king, and it was determined that whilst the royal fleet pursued its course with Queen Berengaria through the Straits of Gibraltar to Britain, C&#339;ur de Lion himself, disguised in the habit of a Knight Templar, should secretly embark and make for one</p>

<p>The lion-hearted monarch was one of the many benefactors to the order of the Temple. He granted to the fraternity his manor of Calow, with various powers and privileges.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_239"></A><A HREF="#fn_239"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>

The most famous of these was the Pilgrim's Castle,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_241"></A><A HREF="#fn_241"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A> which commanded the coast-road from Acre to Jerusalem. It derived its name from a solitary tower erected by the early Templars to protect the passage of the pilgrims through a dangerous pass in the mountains bordering the sea-coast, and was commenced shortly after the removal of the chief house of the order from Jerusalem to Acre. A small promontory which juts out into the sea a few miles below Mount Carmel, was converted into a fortified camp. Two gigantic towers, a hundred feet in height and seventy-four feet in width, were erected, together with enormous</p>

The vast inclosure contained a palace for the use of the Grand Master and knights, a magnificent church, houses and offices for the serving brethren and hired soldiers, together with pasturages, vineyards, gardens, orchards, and fishponds. On one side of the walls was the salt sea, and on the other, within the camp, delicious springs of fresh water. The garrison amounted to four thousand men in time of war.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_242"></A><A HREF="#fn_242"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> Considerable remains of this famous fortress are still visible on the coast, a few miles to the south of Acre. It is still called by the Levantines, <i>Castel Pellegrino</i>. Pococke describes it as "very magnificent, and so finely built, that it may be reckoned one of the things that are best worth seeing in these parts." "It is encompassed," says he, "with two walls fifteen feet thick, the inner wall on the east side cannot be less than forty feet high, and within it there appear to have been some very grand apartments. The offices of the fortress seem to have been at the west end, where I saw an oven fifteen feet in diameter. In the castle there are remains of a fine lofty church of ten sides, built in a light gothic taste: three chapels are built to the three eastern sides, each of which consists of five sides, excepting the opening to the church; in these it is probable the three chief altars stood."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_243"></A><A HREF="#fn_243"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> Irby and Mangles referring at a subsequent period to the ruins of the church, describe it as a double hexagon, and state that the half then standing had six sides. Below the cornice are human heads and heads of animals in alto relievo, and the walls are adorned with a double line of arches in the gothic style, the architecture light and elegant.</p>

<p>In all the conferences and negotiations between the mean-spirited king and the imperious and overbearing Roman pontiff, the Knights Templars took an active and distinguished part. Two brethren of the order were sent by Pandulph, the papal legate, to king John, to arrange that famous conference between them which ended in the complete submission of the latter to all the demands of the holy see. By the advice and persuasion of the Templars, king John repaired to the preceptory of Temple Ewell, near Dover, where he was met by the legate Pandulph, who crossed over from France to confer with him, and the mean-hearted king was there frightened into that celebrated resignation of the kingdoms of England and Ireland, "to God, to the holy apostles Peter and Paul, to the holy Roman church his mother, and to his lord, Pope Innocent the Third, and his catholic successors, for the remission of all his sins and the sins of all his people, as well the living as the dead."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_249"></A><A HREF="#fn_249"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> The following year the commands of king John for the extirpation of the heretics in Gascony, addressed to the seneschal of that province, were issued from the Temple at London,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_250"></A><A HREF="#fn_250"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> and about the same period the Templars were made the depositaries of various private and confidential matters pending between king John and his illustrious sister-in-law, "the royal, eloquent, and beauteous" Berengaria</p>

<p>John was resident at the Temple when he was compelled by the barons of England to sign MAGNA CHARTA.

Know that, at the period of the departure of these letters, an immense number of pilgrims, both knights and foot soldiers, marked with the emblem of the life-giving cross, arrived at Acre from Germany and other parts of Europe. Saphadin, the great sultan of Egypt, hath remained closely within the confines of his own dominions, not daring in any way to molest us. The arrival of the king of Hungary, and of the dukes of Austria and Moravia, together with the intelligence just received of the near approach of the fleet of the Friths, has not a little alarmed him. Never do we recollect the power of the Pagans so low as at the present time; and may the omnipotent God, O holy father, make it grow weaker and weaker day by day. But we must inform you that in these parts corn and barley, and all the necessaries of life, have become extraordinarily dear. This year the harvest has utterly disappointed the expectations of our husbandmen, and has almost totally failed. The natives, indeed, now depend for support altogether upon the corn imported from the West, but as yet very little foreign grain has been received; and to increase our uneasiness, nearly all our knights are dismounted, and we cannot procure horses to supply the places of those that have perished. It is therefore of the utmost importance, O holy father, to advertise all who design to assume the cross of the above scarcity, that they may furnish themselves with plentiful supplies of grain and horses.</p>  
<p>"Before the arrival of the king of Hungary and the duke of Austria, we had come to the determination of marching against the city of Naplous, and of bringing the Saracen chief Coradin to an engagement if he would have awaited our attack, but we have all now determined to undertake an expedition into Egypt</p>

<p>It was in the month of May, A.D. 1218, that the galleys of the Templars set sail from Acre on the above-mentioned memorable expedition into Egypt. They cast anchor in the mouth of the Nile, and, in conjunction with a powerful army of crusaders, laid siege to Damietta. A pestilence broke out shortly after their arrival, and hurried the Grand Master, William de Chartres, to his grave.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_256"></A><A HREF="#fn_256"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> He was succeeded by the veteran warrior, Brother PETER DE MONTAIGU, Grand Preceptor of Spain.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_257"></A><A HREF="#fn_257"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A><span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">PETER DE<br> MONTAIGU<br> A.D. 1218.</FONT></span></p>  
<p>James of Vitry, bishop of Acre, who accompanied the Templars on this expedition, gives an enthusiastic account of their famous exploits, and of the tremendous battles fought upon the Nile, in one of which a large vessel of the Templars was sunk, and every soul on board perished. He describes the great assault on their camp towards the middle of the year 1219, when the trenches were forced, and all the infantry put to flight. "The insulting shouts of the conquering Saracens," says he, "were heard on all sides, and a panic was rapidly spreading through the disordered ranks of the whole army of the cross, when the Grand Master and brethren of the Temple made a desperate charge, and bravely routed the first ranks of the infidels. The spirit of Gideon animated the Templars, and the rest of the army, stimulated by their example, bravely advanced to their support. . . . . Thus did the Lord on that day, through the valour of the Templars, save those who trusted in Him."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_258"></A><A HREF="#fn_258"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A> Immediately after the surrender of Damietta, the Grand Master of the Temple</p>

<p>"Brother Peter de Montaigu, Master of the Knights of the Temple, to the reverend brother in Christ, N., by the grace of God bishop of Ely, health. We proceed by these letters to inform your paternity how we have managed the affairs of our Lord Jesus Christ since the capture of Damietta and of the castle of Taphneos." The Grand Master describes various military operations, the great number of galleys fitted out by the Saracens to intercept the supplies and succour from Europe, and the arming of the galleys, galliots, and other vessels of the order of the Temple to oppose them, and clear the seas of the infidel flag. He states that the sultan of Damascus had invaded Palestine, had ravaged the country around Acre and Tyre, and had ventured to pitch his tents before the castle of the Pilgrims, and had taken possession of C&aelig;sarea. "If we are disappointed," says he, "of the succour we expect in the ensuing summer, all our newly-acquired conquests, as well as the places that we have held for ages past, will be left in a very doubtful condition. We ourselves, and others in these parts, are so impoverished by the heavy expenses we have incurred in prosecuting the affairs of Jesus Christ, that we shall be unable to contribute the necessary funds, unless we speedily receive succour and subsidies from the faithful. Given at Acre, xii. kal. October, A.D. 1222."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_259"></A><A HREF="#fn_259"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The troops of the sultan of Damascus were repulsed and driven beyond the frontier, and the Grand Master then returned to Damietta, to superintend the preparations for a march upon Cairo. The results of that disastrous campaign are detailed in the following letter to Brother Alan Marcel, Preceptor of England, and Master of the Temple at London.</p>

<p>"Hitherto we have had favourable information to communicate unto you touching our exertions in the cause of Jesus Christ; now, alas! such have been the reverses and disasters which our sins have brought upon us in the land of Egypt, that we have nothing but ill news to announce. After the capture of Damietta, our army remained for some time in a state of inaction, which brought upon us frequent complaints and reproaches from the eastern and the western Christians. At length, after the feast of the holy apostles, the legate of the holy pontiff, and all our soldiers of the cross, put themselves in march by land and by the Nile, and arrived in good order at the spot where the sultan was encamped, at the head of an immense number of the enemies of the cross. The river Taphneos, an arm of the great Nile, flowed between the camp of the sultan and our forces, and being unable to ford this river, we pitched our tents on its banks, and prepared bridges to enable us to force the passage. In the mean time, the annual inundation rapidly increased, and the sultan, passing his galleys and armed boats through an ancient canal, floated them into the Nile below our positions, and cut off our communications with Damietta." . . . . " Nothing now was to be done but to retrace our steps. The sultans of Aleppo and Damascus, the two brothers of the sultan, and many chieftains and kings of the pagans, with an immense multitude of infidels who had come to their assistance, attempted to cut off our retreat. At night we commenced our march, but the infidels cut through the embankments of the Nile, the water rushed along several unknown passages and ancient canals, and encompassed us on all sides. We lost all our provisions, many of our men were swept into the stream, and the further progress of our</p>

The waters continued to increase upon us, and in this terrible inundation we lost all our horses and saddles, our carriages, baggage, furniture, and moveables, and everything that we had. We ourselves could neither advance nor retreat, and knew not whither to turn. We could not attack the Egyptians on account of the great lake which extended itself between them and us; we were without food, and being caught and pent up like fish in a net, there was nothing left for us but to treat with the sultan.</p>  
<p>"We agreed to surrender Damietta, with all the prisoners which we had in Tyre and at Acre, on condition that the sultan restored to us the wood of the true cross and the prisoners that he detained at Cairo and Damascus. We, with some others, were deputed by the whole army to announce to the people of Damietta the terms that had been imposed upon us. These were very displeasing to the bishop of Acre,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_260"></A><A HREF="#fn_260"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> to the chancellor, and some others, who wished to defend the town, a measure which we should indeed have greatly approved of, had there been any reasonable chance of success; for we would rather have been thrust into perpetual imprisonment than have surrendered, to the shame of Christendom, this conquest to the infidels. But after having made a strict investigation into the means of defence, and finding neither men nor money wherewith to protect the place, we were obliged to submit to the conditions of the sultan, who, after having exacted from us an oath and hostages, accorded to us a truce of eight years. During the negotiations the sultan faithfully kept his word, and for the space of fifteen days furnished our soldiers with the bread and corn necessary for their subsistence.</p>

<p>Brother Alan Marcell, to whom the above letter is addressed, succeeded Amaric de St. Maur, and was at the head of the order in England for the space of sixteen years. He was employed by king Henry the Third in various important negotiations; and was Master of the Temple at London, when Reginald, king of the island of Man, by the advice and persuasion of the legate Pandulph, made a solemn surrender at that place of his island to the pope and his catholic successors, and consented to hold the same from thenceforth as the feudatory of the church of Rome.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_262"></A><A HREF="#fn_262"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>At the commencement of the reign of Henry the Third, the Templars in England appear to have been on bad terms with the king. The latter made heavy complaints against them to the pope, and the holy pontiff issued (A.D. 1223) the bull "DE INSOLENTIA TEMPLARIORUM REPRIMENDA," in which he states that his very dear son in Christ, Henry, the illustrious king of the English, had complained to him of the usurpations of the Templars on the royal domains; that they had placed their crosses upon houses that did not belong to them, and prevented the customary dues and services from being rendered to the crown; that they undutifully set at nought the customs of the king's manors, and involved the bailiffs and royal officers in lawsuits before certain judges of their own appointment. The pope directs two abbots to inquire into these matters, preparatory to further proceedings against the guilty parties;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_263"></A><A HREF="#fn_263"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> but the Templars soon became reconciled to their sovereign, and on the 28th of April of</p>

The king of England appears at that time to have been resident at the Temple, the letters of credence being made out at that place, in the presence of the archbishop of Canterbury, several bishops, and Hubert, the chief justiciary.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_264"></A><A HREF="#fn_264"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> The year after, the same Alan Marcell was sent into Germany, to negotiate a treaty of marriage between king Henry and the daughter of the duke of Austria.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_265"></A><A HREF="#fn_265"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>At this period, Brother Hugh de Stocton and Richard Ranger, knights of the convent of the New Temple at London, were the guardians of the royal treasure in the Tower, and the former was made the depositary, of the money paid annually by the king to the count of Flanders. He was also intrusted by Henry the Third with large sums of money, out of which he was commanded to pay ten thousand marks to the emperor of Constantinople.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_266"></A><A HREF="#fn_266"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Among the many illustrious benefactors to the order of the Temple at this period was Philip the Second, king of France, who bequeathed the sum of one hundred thousand pounds to the Grand Master of the Temple.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_267"></A><A HREF="#fn_267"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A></p>

He refused to retreat before a superior force, and was surrounded and overwhelmed; a hundred knights of the Temple and three hundred cross-bowmen were slain, together with many secular warriors, and a large number of foot soldiers. The <i>Balcanifer</i>, or standard-bearer, on this occasion, was an English Knight Templar, named Reginald d&#8217;Argenton, who performed prodigies of valour. He was disabled and covered with wounds, yet he unflinchingly bore the Beauseant, or war-banner, aloft with his bleeding arms into the thickest of the fight, until he at last fell dead upon a heap of his slaughtered comrades. The Preceptor of Antioch, before he was slain, "<i>sent sixteen infidels to hell</i>."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_269"></A><A HREF="#fn_269"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>As soon as the Templars in England heard of this disaster, they sent, in conjunction with the Hospitaliers, instant succour to their brethren. "The Templars and the Hospitaliers," says Matthew Paris, "eagerly prepared to avenge the blood of their brethren so gallantly poured forth in the cause of Christ. The Hospitaliers appointed Brother Theodore, their prior, a most valiant soldier, to lead a band of knights and of stipendiary troops, with an immense treasure, to the succour of the Holy Land. Having made their arrangements, they all started from the house of the Hospitaliers at Cleekenwell in London, and passed through the city with spears held aloft, shields displayed, and banners advanced. They marched in splendid pomp to the bridge, and sought a blessing from all who crowded to see them pass. The</p>

<p>Whilst the Knights Templars were thus valiantly sustaining the cause of the cross against the infidels in the East, one of the holy brethren of the order, the king's special counsellor, named Geoffrey, was signalising his zeal against infidels at home in England, (A.D. 1239,) by a fierce destruction and extermination of the Jews. According to Matthew Paris, he seized and incarcerated the unhappy Israelites, and extorted from them immense sums of money.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_271"></A><A HREF="#fn_271"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> Shortly afterwards, Brother Geoffrey fell into disgrace and was banished from court, and Brother Roger, another Templar, the king's almoner, shared the same fate, and was forbidden to approach the royal presence.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_272"></A><A HREF="#fn_272"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8225;</FONT></A> Some of the brethren of the order were always about the court, and when the English monarch crossed the seas, he generally wrote letters to the Master of the Temple at London, informing him of the state of the royal health.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_273"></A><A HREF="#fn_273"><FONT SIZE="1">&sect;</FONT></A></p>  
<p>It was at this period, (A.D. 1240,) that the oblong portion of the Temple church was completed and consecrated in the presence of King Henry the Third.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_274"></A><A HREF="#fn_274"><FONT SIZE="1">&brvbar;&brvbar;</FONT></A></p>

The patriarch returned thither with all his clergy, the churches were reconsecrated, and the Templars and Hospitaliers emptied their treasuries in rebuilding the walls.</p>  
<p>The following account of these gratifying events was transmitted by the Grand Master of the Temple to Robert de Sanford, Preceptor of England, and Master of the Temple at London.</p>

<p>"Since it is our duty, whenever an opportunity offers, to make known to the brotherhood, by letters or by messengers, the state and prospects of the Holy Land, we hasten to inform you, that after our great successes against the sultan of Egypt, and Nassr his supporter and abettor, the great persecutor of the Christians, they were reluctantly compelled to negotiate a truce, promising us to restore to the followers of Jesus Christ all the territory on this side Jordan. We despatched certain of our brethren, noble and discreet personages, to Cairo, to have an interview with the Sultan upon these matters. . . . . ."</p>  
<p>The Grand Master proceeds to relate the progress of the negotiations, and the surrender of the holy city and the greater part of Palestine to the soldiers of Christ. . . . "whence, to the joy of angels and of men," says he, "Jerusalem is now inhabited by Christians alone, all the Saracens being driven out. The holy places have been reconsecrated and purified by the prelates of the churches, and in those spots where the name of the Lord has not been invoked for fifty-six years, now, blessed be God, the divine mysteries are daily celebrated. To all the sacred places there is again free access to the faithful in Christ, nor is it to be doubted but that in this happy and prosperous condition</p>

But, alas! opposition and contradiction arising from envy and hatred have impeded our efforts in the promotion of these and other advantages for the land. With the exception of the prelates of the churches, and a few of the barons, who afford us all the assistance in their power, the entire burthen of its defence rests upon our house alone. . . . . . . . . . . . .</p>  
<p>"For the safeguard and preservation of the holy territory, we propose to erect a fortified castle near Jerusalem, which will enable us the more easily to retain possession of the country, and to protect it against all enemies. But indeed we can in nowise defend for any great length of time the places that we hold, against the sultan of Egypt, who is a most powerful and talented man, unless Christ and his faithful followers extend to us an efficacious support."&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_275"></A><A HREF="#fn_275"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>
