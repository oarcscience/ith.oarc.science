<p><i>April</i>, 1760.</p>  
<p>I have been told that Rhoon (Bentinck) had despicable relations with the English, amongst whom there was a certain Paymaster named Nugent, although the Comte de St. Germain, who is away at present, considered him well disposed towards France.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>May</i>, 1760.</p>  
<p>Doublet told me the following, declaring he had heard it from Hompesch: . . . "that Rhoon had several secret interviews with the so-called Comte de St. Germain, after which the Comte de St. Germain called on the French Ambassador telling him that Rhoon was not as friendly disposed towards England as was believed; that he (St. Germain) had written to France to this effect and that this being so, such an influential man should be made use of." D'Affry finally answered the repeated entreaties of the Comte de St. Germain by saying that he "knew the Sieur Rhoon well; who, being dependent on England as he was, could not render services of any value to France." He (d&#8217;Affry) consequently requested him (St. Germain) no longer to frequent his house.</p>  
<p><a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></A></p>  
<p>Upon this followed the demand of France for the arrest of the Comte de St. Germain. He was however warned and left . . . in a carriage with one of Rhoon's servants, armed with a passport which Rhoon had procured him, by the help of the Minister Yorke. The latter, however, would only give it in "blank," and Rhoon filled in the name himself, repeatedly saying that the move on the part of France was nothing but "Court intrigue."</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p><i>March</i> 10<i>th</i>, 1762.</p>  
<p>I have been told that the so-called Comte de St. Germain has now taken up his residence at UBBERGEN near NIMEGUE; that he also owns some landed property near Zutphen; that he has a huge laboratory in his house in which he shuts himself up for whole days at a time; that he knows how to bestow the most lovely colours imaginable on things, for instance on leather, etc.; that he is a great philosopher and lover of Nature; a fine conversationalist; that he seems to be virtuous; that he looks like a Spaniard of high birth; that he speaks with much feeling of Madame his late mother; that he sometimes signs himself "prince d&#8217;Es." . . .; that he is proud that he is desirous of encouraging Manufactures in the Republic, but that it is not his intention to favour any one town or Province, in spite of the fact that Amsterdam has already made advantageous offers to him on condition that other places should be excluded; that he has rendered great services to Gronsveld by helping him to prepare the colours for his China Factory in Weesp; that he is on the best of terms with Rhoon, on whom he often calls and with whom he corresponds; that he has besides an enormous correspondence with foreign countries; that he is known at every Court; that the late Prince of Wales (who was a despicable character) treated him very badly,</p>  
<p><a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></A></p>  
<p>but that he (St. Germain) being innocent was again set free and rehabilitated; that he corresponds with most important people in France; that he speaks very highly of Mme de Pompadour, etc. He often goes to Amsterdam, where he has called several times on G. Hasselaar; he possesses precious stones of singular beauty: rubies, sapphires, emeralds and diamonds. It is said that he knows how to impart the lustre of those of first water to all diamonds, and how to give the stones more brilliant colours. He is very generous, he owns large properties in the Palatinate and in other parts of Germany; in Amsterdam he takes up his quarters sometimes at other places, and he pays well everywhere.</p>
