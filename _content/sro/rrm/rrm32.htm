<p>The crescent moon and star is a Plantagenet badge. It is also the Badge of the Sultan of Turkey. Also, with a difference, it displays the insignia of Egypt.</p>  
<p>The flag of Egypt is the ensign of the sect of Ali (the second Mohammedan head of religion), which is 'Mars, a Crescent, Luna; within the horns of which is displayed an estoile of the second'--abandoning the vert, or green, of the 'Hadgi', or of Mecca, the site of the apotheosis of Mohammed. The Mohammedan believers of the sect of Ali rely on the 'masculine principle'--more closely, in this respect, assimilating with the Jews; and therefore their distinctive heraldic and theological colour is red, which is male, to the exclusion of the other Mohammedan colour,</p>

<p>The Hospital of St. Cross, near Winchester, abounds in the earliest Norman mouldings. The architecture of St. Cross presents numerous hermetic suggestions.</p>  
<p>The identity of Heathen and of Christian Symbols is displayed in all our old churches in degrees more or less conclusive.</p>

<p>The devices on most Roman Bronze Lamps present continual Gnostic ideas.</p>  
<p>The Temple Church, London, will be found to abound with Rosicrucian hieroglyphs and anagrammatical hints in all parts, if reference be made to it by an attentive inquirer--one accustomed to these abstruse studies.</p>

<p>There are two works which will assist in throwing light upon that mystic system of the ancients, probably originating in the dreaming East, that refers the production of music to architectural forms or geometric diagrams; as columns and entablatures, or upright lines and cross-lines, and mathematical arcs and diagonals, in their modifications and properties, of course are. These books, which will help to explain the passages of music given at <A HREF="#page_258">p. 258</A>, figs. 141, 142, are Hay's <i>Natural Principles and Analogy of the Harmony of Form</i>, and a very original and learned musical production, entitled <i>The Analogy of the Laws of Musical Temperament to the Natural Dissonance of Creation</i>, by M. Vernon, published in London in 1867. Through a strange theory, the music at <A HREF="#page_258">p. 258</A> of our book is taken as the expression of the geometrical fronts of the two great temples, the Parthenon at Athens and the Pantheon at Rome, which are supposed to have been built with perfect art. We have 'translated' these phantom &AElig;olian melodies played in the winds (so to express it), and fixed them in modern musical notation.</p>
