<p>WE have asserted, in an earlier part of our book, that the pyramidal or triangular form which fire assumes in its ascent to heaven was, in the monolithic typology, used to signify the Great Generative Power. The coarse sensuality which seems inseparable from modern ideas about the worship of the pillar or upright had no place really in the solemn ancient mind, in which ideas of religion largely and constantly mingled. We must not judge the ancients by too rigid an adherence to our own prepossessions--foolish and inveterately hardened as they continually are.</p>  
<p>The adoration paid to this image of the <i>phallus</i>, which has persisted as an object of worship through all the ages, in all countries, was only the acknowledgment, in the ancient mind, of wonder at the seemingly accidental and unlikely, but certainly most complete and effectual, means by which the continuation of the human race is secured. The cabalistic arguers contended that 'Man' was a phenomenon; that he did not, otherwise than in his presentment, seem intended; that there appeared nothing even in the stupendous chain of organisms that seemed specially to hint his approach, or to explain his appearance (strange as this seems), according to likelihood and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_234"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 234</FONT></A></p>  
<p>sequence; that between the highest of the animals and the being 'Man' there was a great gulf, and seemingly an impassable gulf; that some 'after-reason', to speak according to the means of the comprehension of man, induced his introduction into the Great Design; that, in short, 'Man' originally was not intended. There is a deep mystery underlying all these ideas, which we find differently accounted for in the various theologies.</p>  
<p>We are here only speaking some of the abstruse speculations of the old philosophers, whose, idea of creation, and of the nature of man and his destiny, differed most materially--if not wholly--from the acceptable ideas which they chose to inculcate, and which they wished to impress upon ordinary minds. Thus their deeper speculations were never committed to writing, because they did not admit of, interpretation in this way; and if so handed down or promulgated, they would have been sure to have been rejected and disbelieved, on account of the impossibility of their being believed. In indicating some of the strange notions propounded by the Sophists, and, if possible, still more remarkably by the early Christian Fathers, we desire to disclaim any participation with</p>

<p>them. Our personal belief of these theories must not be necessarily supposed from our seeming to advocate them. There is no doubt that they were very acute</p>

<p>The succeeding array of phallic figures will be found interesting, as tracing out to its progenitor or prototype that symbol which we call the 'upright'. This architectural descent we shall call the 'Genealogy of the Tower or Steeple'.</p>  
<p>The Architectural Genealogy of the 'Tower' or 'Steeple' (so to speak) is full of suggestion, and is closely connected with the story of the phallus.</p>  
<p>The insignia on the heads of the cobras in the friezes of the Egyptian Court in the Crystal Palace are coloured on the Right, <i>White</i>, on the Left, <i>Red</i>. These imply masculine and feminine ideas.</p>

<p>Fig. 42 is the Winged Human-headed Lion. It comes from the Nineveh Gallery. It may be recognized as the Winged Bull, and also as the Winged 'Lion of St Mark'.</p>  
<p>The 'Lion', 'Bull', 'Eagle', 'Man', are the symbols of the Evangelists; the 'Man', or 'Angel' standing for St. Matthew, the 'Lion' for St. Mark, the 'Bull' for St. Luke, and the 'Eagle' for St. John. In these strange aspects the Evangelists figured in many ancient churches, and on most fonts. These representative forms are also said to have been the 'Four Cherubim' of the Ark of the Hebrews. Hermetically they signify the <font size="-1" color="green">'</font>four elements', or the four corners or angle-points of the 'Lesser' or 'Manifested World', or the 'Microcosm' of the Cabalists.</p>

<p>Fig. 45 represents an Obelisk at Nineveh, now in the British Museum. Jacob's Pillar, the Sacred Stone in Westminster Abbey, 'Bethel', etc., 'Gilgal', have a mythic alliance with the obelisk.</p>  
<p>Regarding the pyramids the following may be advanced: Murphy, the delineator of the Alhambra, considered the Pointed Arch to be a system founded on the principle of the Pyramid. The pointed or vertical Saracenic or Gothic arch presents the form of the upper portion of the human &#0966;&#0945;&#0955;&#0955;&#0959;&#0962;. The Saracenic arch denotes the union of the Linga and Yoni.</p>  
<p>In fig. 56 we have the sun rising from between the horns of Eblis (here taken for the pyramids). This is a poetical superstition of the Arabians, who therefore turn to the <i>North</i> to pray it contradiction to</p>

<p>the practice of the Persians, who adore the rising sun. The Arabians avert in prayer from this malific sign of the 'horns', because the sun is seen rising from between them; and when disclosing from between these mythic pillars, the sun becomes a portent.</p>  
<p>Fig. 57 is an Egyptian seal, copied by Layard (<i>Nineveh and Babylon</i>, p. 156). Subject: the Egyptian god Harpocrates, seated on the mythic lotus, in adoration of the Yoni, or &#8207;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;&#8206;, or <i>havah</i>.</p>  
<p>The Druidical Circles, and single stones standing in solitary places, are all connected with the mystic speculations of the Rosicrucians.</p>  
<p>The eminences, St. Michael's Mount and Mont St.-Michel, were dedicated by the Ph&#339;nicians to the Sun-God (Hercules), as the 'Hydra' or 'Dragon-slayer'.</p>

<p>The Architectural Genealogy of the 'Tower' or 'Steeple' displays other phases of the alterations of the 'upright'.

<p>crescent, with its points in the curvilinear or serpentine form. The crescent moon of Egypt and that of Persia is the thin sickle of the new moon reclining on her back, and seemingly with the star <i>issuant</i> from between her horns; which is evidently an Egyptian hint coming from the old hieroglyphic times. This mysterious crescent and star is the badge of the sect of Ali among the Mohammedans, and it plays a most important part in augurial or religious heraldry. The standards of Egypt, Persia, and Arabia are <i>gules</i>, or Mars, or the fiery colour. It is </p>  
<p><A NAME="page_251"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 251</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the ardent, or masculine, or red colour of Ali. The colours of Turkey, on the other hand, are strictly those of Mohammed, and unconsciously honour the female element in displaying the green, or the <i>vert</i>, or the woman's colour, or Friday colour, that of the Mohammedan Sabbath. This green is the <i>vert</i>, or 'Venus', of Mecca (see page <A HREF="rrm43.htm#page_390">390</A>). The Turkish standard divides <i>party-per-pale</i> the masculine red of the sect of Ali with the green of the Hadgi; allotting to the former the place of honour, or the dexter side of the emblazonment.</p>  
<p>The Christian altar is divided, as a hieroglyphic, into two halves or sides, before which the representative priest extends his hands, standing before it with his right hand (meaning the 'Law') to the right, and his left hand (meaning the 'Prophets') to the left; the first of which signifies the masculine (Jewish), and the second the feminine (Christian--because the Saviour was 'born of a woman'), mystic celestial power.</p>  
<p>Some monograms or hieroglyphic expressions, meaning the 'Salvator Mundi,' show the Roman letter 'I' (Jesus) in front, in large size; the letter 'H' (which is feminine, and Greek in its origin, meaning here 'Man, <i>as born of Woman</i>') much smaller; and behind, interlacing and combining the first two letters, is the single curved or cursive 'S', which stands for 'S.S.', the Holy Spirit, or the Third Person of the Trinity. The whole, in another way, is 'Jesus Hominum Salvator'. Nearly all the sacred monograms, with the intention of making the letter denoting the 'Man' prominent, present the letter 'I' large; in the heraldic language <i>surtout</i>, or 'over all'. The monogram of the Saviour is sometimes seen in the 'Ark', or '<i>vesica piscis</i>,' which is a pointed oval figure, familiar in Gothic architecture,</p>

<p>and shaped like a boat or a shuttle, <i>counter-changing</i> the letters and the closing arcs, white and black--the black occupying the left or female side according to the ideas of the Templars. The standards of these soldier-monks were white and black, either oblong or forked.</p>  
<p>There are two columns of that heavy, severe order, however grand and impressive, which distinguishes the early Norman period of architecture in England, in regard to which, though abounding in far-off hermetic suggestions, we have seen no notice in antiquarian quarters. These two columns comprise a part of the colonnade in the White Tower, or central tower, of the Tower of London. The capital of the first column is square, but it is rounded at the angles by a cut to the <i>hypotrachelium</i>, or base-ring, of the <A HREF="errata.htm#6">capital</A>. The tops of these cuts are formed by volutes similar to the horns of the Corinthian and Ionic capitals. The male volute is to the right, and is a spiral volve, from which issues a dependent budding flower dropping seed. The volve to the left, which is a series of rings enclosing a point, is female. A twisted perpendicular, like a horn, projects from the base on this left side. The capital of the other column presents a not unusual Norman form of two truncated-tables or faces rounded below and divided in the middle. These we interpret as meaning the 'woman' and the 'man', side by side, and left and right. These glyphs in the two capitals of the columns signify 'Jachin' and 'Boaz', and stand for the 'First Man,<font size="-1" color="green">'</font> and the 'First Woman'. The mysterious letter 'Tau', which is the same as the Runic Hammer of Thor, and which in truth is a 'Cross,' occupies the centre-point, or, heraldically, the 'honour-point', of the first column to the right. The master-masons were celebrated in their art of concealing myths, or hinting them</p>

<p>The character of the 'Head' which the Templars were charged with having worshipped in their secret 'encampments', or 'mystic lodges', has been the subject of much dispute. Some say it was the head of Proserpine, or of Isis, or of the 'Mother of Nature' presented under certain strange aspects. Others assert that the figure was male, and that of Dis or Charon, according to the classic nomenclature. The object was reputed to be a talisman, and it is called by some the head of Medusa, or the snake-haired visage, dropping blood which turned to snakes, and transforming the beholder to stone. It was this head, or one of a similar description, which was supposed to serve as the talisman or recognitive mark of the secret fraternity or society, headed by Pichegru and others, which was suppressed by Napoleon, and the members of which were tried and condemned as aiming at revolutionary objects. Why Napoleon adopted this mysterious supposed magical head, as he is said to have done, on the suppression and destruction of this revolutionary body--to which we refer elsewhere--and why he chose to place his own head in the centre-place before occupied by this imagined awe-inspiring countenance, and adopted the whole as the star of his newly founded 'Legion of Honour', it is very difficult to say. In the East there is a tradition of this insupportable magic countenance, which the Orientals assign to a 'Veiled Prophet', similar to the mysterious personage in <i>Lalla Rookh</i>.</p>
