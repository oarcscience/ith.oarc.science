### CHAPTER THE SECOND

#### PRESENCE OF THE ROSICRUCIANS IN HEATHEN AND CHRISTIAN ARCHITECTURE

A QUESTION may here arise whether two corresponding pillars, or columns,
in the White Tower, London, do not very ingeniously conceal,
masonically, the mythic *formula* of the Mosaic Genesis, 'Male and
Female created He them', etc. Refer below to figs. 119, 120.

2\. Corinthian Volutes, or 'Ram's Horns'.

The crescent moon and star is a Plantagenet badge. It is also the Badge
of the Sultan of Turkey. Also, with a difference, it displays the
insignia of Egypt.

The flag of Egypt is the ensign of the sect of Ali (the second
Mohammedan head of religion), which is 'Mars, a Crescent, Luna; within
the horns of which is displayed an estoile of the second'--abandoning
the vert, or green, of the 'Hadgi', or of Mecca, the site of the
apotheosis of Mohammed. The Mohammedan believers of the sect of Ali rely
on the 'masculine principle'--more closely, in this respect,
assimilating with the Jews; and therefore their distinctive heraldic and
theological colour is red, which is male, to the exclusion of the other
Mohammedan colour,

titles of honour, and to their various ranks.

The Hospital of St. Cross, near Winchester, abounds in the earliest
Norman mouldings. The architecture of St. Cross presents numerous
hermetic suggestions.

The identity of Heathen and of Christian Symbols is displayed in all our
old churches in degrees more or less conclusive.

The 'Ten fingers' of the two hands (made up of each 'Table' of Five) are
called in old parlance, the ten commandments'. 'I will write the ten
commandments

in thy face' was spoken in fury, in the old-fashioned days, of an
intended assault. The hands explain the meaning of this proverbial
expression, interpreted astrologically. Palmistry is called Chiromancy,
because Apollo, mythologically, was taught 'letters' by Chiron, the
'Centaur'.

The devices on most Roman Bronze Lamps present continual Gnostic ideas.

The Temple Church, London, will be found to abound with Rosicrucian
hieroglyphs and anagrammatical hints in all parts, if reference be made
to it by an attentive inquirer--one accustomed to these abstruse
studies.

These designs supply a variety of Early Christian Symbols or
Hieroglyphs, drawn from Roman originals in all parts of the world.

The Æolian Harp, or Magic Harp, gave forth real strains in the wind.

be played from the frontispieces, as musical instruments, of two of the
most celebrated ancient religious structures. The Cabalists imagined
that the arrangements of the stars in the, sky, and particularly the
accidental circumvolvent varying speed of the planets of the solar
system, produced music--as men know music. The Sophists maintained that
architecture, in another sense, was harmonious communication,

addressed to a capable apprehension--when the architecture was true to

invocations, addressed by day and night, to the intelligent beings who
filled the air invisibly. They were played from the fronts

In fig. 153 we have a representation of Bersted Church, as seen
(magnified) from a rising hill, over a hop-garden, at about the distance
of half a mile. Bersted is a little village, about three miles from
Maidstone, Kent, on the Ashford road. In the chancel of Bersted Church,
Robert Fludd, or Flood ('Robertus de Fluctibus'), the head of the
Rosicrucians in England, lies buried. He died in 1637.

Each finger in fig. 162 is devoted to a separate planet. Refer to the
engraving of the hand.

Fig. 167, 'Hook of Saturn', 'Crook of Bishops'. 'By hook or crook',
meaning, 'By fair means or foul', is a proverbial expression,
continually heard.

There are two works which will assist in throwing light upon that mystic
system of the ancients, probably originating in the dreaming East, that
refers the production of music to architectural forms or geometric
diagrams; as columns and entablatures, or upright lines and cross-lines,
and mathematical arcs and diagonals, in their modifications and
properties, of course are. These books, which will help to explain the
passages of music given at [p. 258](#page_258), figs. 141, 142, are
Hay's *Natural Principles and Analogy of the Harmony of Form*, and a
very original and learned musical production, entitled *The Analogy of
the Laws of Musical Temperament to the Natural Dissonance of Creation*,
by M. Vernon, published in London in 1867. Through a strange theory, the
music at [p. 258](#page_258) of our book is taken as the expression of
the geometrical fronts of the two great temples, the Parthenon at Athens
and the Pantheon at Rome, which are supposed to have been built with
perfect art. We have 'translated' these phantom Æolian melodies played
in the winds (so to express it), and fixed them in modern musical
notation.
