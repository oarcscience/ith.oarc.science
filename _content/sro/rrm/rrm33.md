### CHAPTER THE THIRD

#### THE ROSICRUCIANS AMIDST ANCIENT MYSTERIES. THEIR TRACES DISCOVERABLE IN THE ORDERS OF KNIGHTHOOD

THE. 'Collar of Esses' is supposed always to be a part of the Order of
the Garter. The coupled 'S.S.' mean the 'Sanctus Spiritus', or 'Holy
Spirit', or the 'Third Person'. The 'Fleurs-de-Lis', or 'Lisses', or the
Lilies of the Field', invariably appear in close connexion with St.
John, or the 'Sanctus Spiritus', and also with the Blessed Virgin Mary,
in all Christian

*symbola* or *insignia*. The Prince of Wales's triple plume appears to
have the same mythic Egyptian and Babylonian origin, and to be
substantially the same symbol as the 'Fleur-de-Lis'. When arranged in
threes, the 'Fleurs-de-Lis' represent the triple powers of nature--the
'producer', the 'means of production', and 'that produced': The
'Fleur-de-Lis' is presented in a deep disguise in the 'Three Feathers',
which is the crest of the Prince of Wales;

in this form the Fleur-de-Lis is intended to elude ordinary recognition.
The reader will observe the hint of these significant 'Lisses' in the
triple scrolls or 'Esses' coiled around the bar in the reverse of the
Gnostic gem, the 'Chnuphis Serpent', elsewhere given. This amulet is a
fine opalescent chalcedony, very convex on both sides. It is the figure
of the 'Chnuphis Serpent' rearing himself aloft in act to dart, crowned
with the seven vowels, the cabalistic gift to Man in his Fall,
signifying 'speech'. The re verse presents the triple 'S.S.S.' coiled
around the 'Phallus'.

In fig. 170 we have the Prince of Wales's Feathers, from the Tomb of
Edward the Black Prince, in Canterbury Cathedral. This badge presents
the idea of the 'Fleur-de-Lis', 'Ich Dien!'--'I serve!'

Fig. 171 represents the Egyptian Triple Plumes, which are the same badge
as the 'Fleur-de-Lis' and the Prince of Wales's Feathers, meaning the
'Trinity'.

Fig. 172--also (*ante*) referred to as fig. 191--is a Gnostic Gem. It
represents the 'Chnuphis Serpent', spoken of above.

A famous inscription (Delphic E) was placed above the portal of the
Temple at Delphi. This, inscription

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

<span id="img_26500"></span>

[![Figs. 172, 173](tn/26500.jpg)

Figs. 172, 173  

was a single letter, namely, the letter E, the name of which in Greek
was E, 'which is the second person of the present of the indicative of
the verb ειμι, and signifies 'Thou art'; being as Plutarch has
interpreted it, the salutation bf the god by those who entered the
Temple. See Plutarch *de* E *apud Delph*. Lord Monboddo's *Origin and
Progress of Language* (1774), vol. ii. p. 85, refers to this letter E.

The Delphic 'E' means the number 'Five', or the half of the Cabalistic
Zodiac, or the Five Ascending Signs. This 'Delphic E' is also the
Seleucidan Anchor. It was adopted by the Gnostics to indicate the
'Saviour', and it is frequent in the talismans and amulets of the early
Christians. It is one of the principal gems of the Gnostics, and is a
cameo in flat relief.

One of the charges against the Knights Templars was as follows: 'That
they bound, or touched, the head of an idol with cords, wherewith they
bound themselves about their. shirts or next their skins'

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ('Processus contra
Templarios', Dugd. *Monast. Ang*. vol. vi. part ii. pp. 844-846, etc.).
There is something strange about these cords, cordons, ropes, belts,
bands, baldrics (also in the term 'belted earls'). These are always male
accessories; except the 'zones', sashes, or girdles, worn as the mark of
virgins, which cinctures may yet draw their symbolic meaning from this
same '*umbilicus*' in question. The reader will notice also the
connexion of these ideas and the practice in the Roman race of the
'Lupercal', at the February Roman religious solemnities (February of the
'Fishes'). At these it was the custom of the runners to flog bystanders,
*particularly women*, with thongs or cords; which were probably intended
to be the racers’ own girdles. Julius Cæsar, Mark Antony, and Calphurnia
form a group illustrative of this meaning. Thus Shakespeare:

               Our elders say,  
The barren, touched in this holy chase,  
Shake off the sterile curse.  
                       --Julius Cæsar, act is sc. 2.

Is this the origin of the custom of the people pelting or .flogging each
other at the Italian Carnivals? It seems highly probable. The Carnivals
occur at the same time as these Roman *Lupercalia*.

Many early Norman mouldings exhibit various examples of the cable.
Thongs, ties, and network are seen to bind all the significant figures
in the early English and Irish churches. Is there any connexion between
these bonds, or ties, or lacings, with the 'cable-tow' of the initiates
among the Masons? Perhaps the 'tow' in this 'cable-tow' means the 'Tau',
or stood for it originally. Reference may here be made to the snake
which forms the girdle of the Gnostic 'Good Shepherd' in the
illustration later in our book (fig. 252).

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

The cable-mouldings in Gothic architecture are intended to carry an
important meaning. They are found in the pointed or Christian
architecture in continual close connexion with the triplicated zigzag,
the vandykes, or '*aquarii*', as we designate them, because all these
architectural forms, which are hieroglyphs, mean the feminine or 'Second
Principle', and express the sign of Aquarius, with its watery or lunar
hints, its twin-fishes, and its Jonah-like anagrams of the 'Redeemer'.
Hence the boatlike, elongated, peculiar form called the *vesica piscis*,
which is the oblong shuttle-shaped frame continually set over doors and
windows and elsewhere in Gothic churches, to contain effigies of the
Saviour, or Virgin Mary, or groups from the New Testament in connexion
with these Two Sacred Persons. A doorway in Barfreston Church, Kent,
supplies an excellent example of the employment of this oblong figure;
which is also Babylonian, and means the female member as its
starting-point.

In a previous part of our book we give various figures of the prows or
cutwater-heads of gondolas, in which we clearly show the origin of their
peculiar form, which represents the *securis*, or 'sacrificial axe',
that crook originally expressed in the 'hook of Saturn'. The
'Bu-Centaur' indicates the fabulous being, the bicorporate 'ox' or
'horse' and 'Man', as will be found by a separation of the syllables
'Bu-Centaur'. It is the name of the state-galley of the Doge of Venice,
used on the occasion of his figurative stately marriage with, the
Adriatic, or espousal of the 'Virgin of the Sea', who was Cybele of the
'sacrificial hook'. The hatchet of Dis, the glaive, the halberd, the
reaping-hook of Ceres, the crescent moon, the 'Delphic E', are all the
same mystic figure. The prow of the gondola exhibits unmistakably the

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

*securis* and *fasces* conjointly, or the axe of the sacrifice and the
rods for the scourging of the victim first, if human, and afterwards for
his burning--the rods being the firewood. Lictors have their name
probably from '*Llec*'. From this peculiar cutwater arose the
Dragon-beak, the 'Prow', or 'Frow', the figurehead and fiddle-head. They
have all a feminine origin.

<span id="img_26800"></span> ![Fig. 174](img/26800.jpg)

Fig. 174 represents 'S. Johan' (St., John), from an early woodcut of the
Twelve Apostles: His right hand is raised in the act of the holy sign,
whilst hid left clasps the chalice of the 'S.S.', or Sacrament of Wine;
in the cup is a salamander, signifying the 'H. G'. This is St. John the
Apostle, the author of the 'Apocalypse'; or the 'Sanctus Spiritus', who
baptizes in the mystic Eucharist with the 'Holy Ghost and with Fire'.

The following are the names pf the angels of the planets, according to
the Gnostics. At the beginning of all things is Jehovah (Sabaoth),
Victory; at the end, the 'Old Serpent' (Ophis). Between these are the
Seraphim (Intelligences) and Cherubim (Benevolences), and their
representatives. Origen calls the Sun, Adonai; the Moon, Iao; Jupiter,
Eloi; Mars, Sabao; Orai, Venus; Astaphai; Mercury;

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ildabaoth, Saturn.
All this is Gnostic--highest mysticism therefore.

The name Tarasque is given for the Dragon of a Northern Nation. (Qy. the
'Hill of Tara', etc.?) Under the Roman Emperors, and under the Emperors
of Byzantium, every cohort or centurion bore a dragon as its ensign
(Modestus, *De Vocabul*. *Rei Milit*.; Flav. Veget. *De Re Militari*,
lib. ii. c. xiii.: Georget, *Insig. Europ*., *loc. cit.*) Matthew of
Westminster, speaking of the early battles of this country of England,
says: 'The King’s place was *between* the Dragon and the
Standard'--'Regius locus fuit inter draconem et standardum' (Lower's
*Curiosities of Heraldry*, p. 96). This is the undoubted origin of the
ensign’s 'pair of colours' in a battalion; viz. the first colour, or
'King’s Colour', whose place is to the right, is properly the standard;
and the second colour, or the 'regimental colour', to which is assigned
the left-hand, or female, or sinister place, is the 'Dragon'. The Dragon
was supposed to conduct to victory, because its figure was a most potent
charm. The standards and guidons of the cavalry follow the same magic
rule.

The planets are supposed by the astrologers and alchemists to exercise
dominion more particularly in the order following, and to produce
effects upon their own appropriate under-mentioned metals, on
planetarily corresponding days. These are Sol, for gold, on Sunday;
Luna, for silver, on Monday; Mars, for iron, on Tuesday; Mercury, for
quicksilver, on Wednesday; Jupiter, for tin, on Thursday; Venus, for
copper, on Friday; and Saturn, for lead, on Saturday (Lucas's *Travels*,
p. 79; Count Bernard of Treviso). The emblematical sculptures, in which
the whole enigma of the art of transmutation is supposed to be
contained, are those over the fourth arch of the

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cemetery of the
Innocents, at Paris, as you go through the great gate of St. Denis, on
the right-hand side. They were placed there by Nicholas Flamel.

The old traditions, from time immemorial, aver that it is neither proper
for sailors nor for servants of the sea to wear beards. That they have
never done so is true, except at those times when profound mythic
meanings were not understood or were neglected. This smoothness of a
sailor's face arises from the fact that the sea has always been
mythologically feminine, and that sailors and men or followers of the
sea are under the protection of the 'Queen of the Deep', or the 'Virgin
of the Sea'. Hence the figure of Britannia, with her sceptre of the sea
or trident, and not that of Neptune.

The Virgin Mary, the 'Star of the Sea', and Patroness of Sailors, rules
and governs the ocean, and her colours are the ultramarine of the
'Deep', and sea-green, when viewed in this phase of her divine
character. In all representations, ancient or modern, sailors have
beardless faces, unless they belong to the reprobate and barbarian
classes--such as pirates and outlaws, and men who have supposedly thrown
off devotional observance, and fallen into the rough recusancy of mere
nature.

Fig. 175 is a very curious design from Sylvanus Morgan, an old herald.
Above is the spade, signifying here the *phallus*; and below is the
distaff, or instrument of woman's work, meaning the answering member, or
*Yoni*; these are united by the snake. We here perceive the meaning of
the rhymed chorus sung by Wat Tyler's mob: 'When Adam delved' (with his
spade), 'and Eve span' (contributing her \[producing\] part of the
work), 'where was then the Gentleman?'--or what, under these ignoble
conditions, makes difference or degree? It is supposed

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

that Shakespeare plays upon this truth when he makes his clown in
*Hamlet* observe 'They' (i.e. Adam and Eve) 'were the first who ever
bore arms.' By a reference to the foot of the figure, we shall see what

<span id="img_27100"></span>

[![Fig. 175. a. 'Baron' b. 'Femme'](tn/27100.jpg)

these arms were, and discover male and female resemblances in the shape
of the man’s 'escutcheon' and the woman's diamond-shaped 'lozenge'. As
thus: *a* is the shield of arms, or 'spade', or 'spada', or 'male
implement', on man’s own side, or dexter side; *b* is the 'lozenge', or
distaff, or 'article representative of woman's work', on her proper
side, or the left or sinister side.

A chalice is, in general, the sign of the Priestly Order. The chalice on
the tombstone of a knight, or over the door of a castle, is a sign of
the Knights Templars, of whom St. John the Evangelist was the Patron
Saint. The 'cup' was forbidden to the laity, and was only received by
the Priests, in consequence of the decree of Pope Innocent III, A.D.
1215. It means the 'S.S.', or Holy Spirit, to which we have frequently
adverted.

We have carefully inspected that which has been designated the *crux
antiquariorum,* or the Puzzle of

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Antiquaries,
namely, the famous Font, which is of unknown and bewildering antiquity,
in the nave of Winchester Cathedral. Milner (a feeble narrator and
misty, unreliable historian), in his *History of Winchester*, has the
following superficial notice of this relic: 'The most distinguished
ornaments on the top are doves "*breathing*"' (they are not 'breathing',
they are drinking) 'into phials surmounted with crosses *fichée*. And on
the sides' (the north side, he should say, which is faced wrongly, and
ought properly to front the east) 'the doves are again depicted with a
*salamander*, emblematic of fire; in allusion to that passage of St.
Matthew: "He shall baptize you with the *Holy Ghost and with fire*".'

All the secrets of masonry are concealed in the Hebrew or Chaldee
language. In the First Chapter of the *Gospel according to St. John* is
contained the mythical outline of the Cabala, in its highest part.

'Les anciens astrologues, dit le plus savant les Juifs' (Maimonides),
'ayant consacré à chaque planète, une *couleur*, un *animal*, un *bois*,
un *métal*, un *fruit*, une *plante*, ils formaient de toutes ces choses
une *figure* ou réprésentation de l’astre, observant pour cet effet de
choisir un *instant approprié*, *un jour heureux*, tel que la
*conjonction*, ou tout autre aspect favorable. Par leurs cérémonies
(magiques) ils croyaient pouvoir faire passer dans ces figures ou idoles
les influences des êtres supérieurs (leurs modèles). C’étaient ces
idoles qu’adoraient les *Kaldéens-sabéens*. Les prêtres égyptiens,
indiens, perses--on les croyait lier les dieux à leurs idoles, les faire
descendre du ciel à leur gré. Ils menacent le soleil et la lune dé
révéler les secrets des mystères.'--Eusebius Iamblicus, *De Mysteriis
Egyptiorum*.

The mystic emblems of the religions of India, China, Greece, and Rome
are closely similar, and are

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

set forth in the ornaments on the friezes of the temples of all those
countries, explaining their general principles. 'Your popular societies
are an emanation from the lodges of the Freemasons; in like manner as
these proceeded from the funeral pile of the Templars' ('*Castle*' *of
the Tuileries*, year viii). Thus the 'egg-and-tongue moulding ('egg and
adder's tongue', for the egg and the serpent were two of the emblems of
the Egyptian and Greek mysteries), the griffin, the lion of St. Mark,
the honeysuckle-and-lotus ornament, the convolutions and volutes, the
horns as floriation springing from the lighted candelabra, the lotus and
tori of Egypt, and the Greek ornaments and Roman Templar ornaments, are
all related in their religious meanings.

The names of the 'Three Kings', or 'Shepherds'; who descried, the Star
of Annunciation in the East, are Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar.
Caspar, or Gaspar, is the 'White One'; Melchior is the 'King of Light';
Balthasar, the 'Lord of Treasures'. Balthasar, or Balthazar, is the
Septuagint spelling of Belshazzar.

*Linga* is the old name of an island near Iona, called the 'Dutchman's
Cap'. (Qy. the Phrygian cap?--also the first 'cocked hat', and its
recondite meaning?) *Gallus*, or the Cock, is sacred to Mars,
whose-colour is *red*. In this connexion, and as bespeaking Hermes or
Mercurius, the 'messenger of the dawn', may have arisen the use of the
'cock', as the emblem supposedly of the first descrier of the daily
light from the tops of the steeples. It probably signifies the phallic
myth. The grasshopper, dragon, arrow, and fox, as weathercocks, have
undoubtedly a remote reference to the same idea of symbolizing the
'Prince of the Powers of the Air'.

The form of the Pointed Arch reached the Orientals

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --as we see in
their Temples--in the shape of the Phrygian and Median Bonnet
(Lascelles, 1820). In these strange curves we have mingling the
*scarab*, scorpion, Σ, or (--).

Cocks crow at day-dawn. Weathercocks turn to the wind, and invite the
meteoric or elementary influences, the 'Powers of the Air'. The question
as to the mystic side of all this is very interesting and curious. The
fields of the air were supposed by the Rosicrucians to be filled with
spirits.

'Tous les Lamas portent la mitre, ou bonnet conique, qui était l’emblème
du soleil. Le Dalai-Lama, ou immense prêtre de La, est ce que nos
vieilles relations appelaient le prêtre Jean, par l’abus du mot persan
*Djehân*, qui veut dire le monde. Ainsi le prêtre Monde, le dieu Monde,
se tient parfaitement.'--Volney, *Ruines*, p. 251. (Qy. Prester-John?
Qy. also this verbal connexion with '*Saint* John', as if Prêtre John?)
In the old Norman-French *Maistre* is frequently met for *Maître*. This
Prestre, or Prester (Anglicized), or Prêtre John, is probably no other
than the Priest or High-Priest 'John', otherwise Saint John, or the
'Saint-Esprit'. The recognition of the + in the Great Llama, Al-Ama,
Ama, Anima (Soul, Spirit), Alma, El-Om, etc., meaning 'white', is very
curious. The antiquary Bryant is positively of opinion, from the very
names of Columbkil and Iona, that this island Iöna was anciently sacred
to the Arkite divinities. The great asylum of the Northern Druids was
the Island of Hu or Iona, Vs Colan, or Columba (*Mythology and Rites of
the British Druids*, by Edward Davies, 1809, p. 479).

The glories around sacred persons and objects, which have
straight-darting and curvilinear or wavy or serpentine rays alternately,
are continual in theological or heraldic illustration; which waved and
straight

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

rays alternately imply a deep mystery. They are constant symbols in the
sacred *nimbi*, and are found upon sacramental cups; they are set as the
symbolical *radii* around reliquaries, and they appear as the mystic
fiery circle of the Pyx. The *straight* spires and the brandished waved
flames, or cherubic (or rather *seraphic*) gladii, or crooked swords
guarding Paradise, imply two of the chief Christian mysteries. In the
curved spires of flame, alternating with the aureole or ring of glory,
there is possibly a remote hint of ♄, or the 'Reconciler of the Worlds
Visible and Invisible', or 'S.S.'.

To account for the universal deification of 'horns' in architecture all
over the world, as its symbolic keynote, as it were, which sigma has
been transmitted into modern emblematic science, and incorporated
unconsciously into the ornaments and elevated into the high places, over
and over again, even in Christian buildings, an old Talmudist--Simeon
Ben-Iochay by name--hazards the startling conjecture that this adoration
arose originally in the supernatural light of knowledge of the old day,
for the following reasons: the strange explanation which this mysterious
writer gives is, that the bovine animals would have themselves become
men in their future generations, but for that divine arrest which
interfered athwart as it were, and wasted the ruminative magnetic force;
which otherwise miraculously would have effected the transformation, by
urging the powers of the brain from the radix of the rudimentary templar
region into the enormous branching, tree-like, then improvised
appendages, where this possibility or extension of the nervous lines
became spoiled and attenuate, solidified and degraded. Growth and
development are assumed as taken from expansion and radiation off a
nervous sensitive centre, by election or affinity governed by an

invisible Power operating from without. It is to descend very deep into
cabalistic and Talmudical mysteries to gain comprehension of an idea
concerning-the origin of this absurd worship of animal horns.

The cabalist Simeon Ben-Iochay declares that it was in gratitude for
this changed intention, and because the creature man became 'Man', and
not the bovine creatures--a 'catastrophe which might have happened,
except for this diversion of the brain-power into horns' (mere fable or
dream as all this sounds!)--that the Egyptians set up the very 'horns,'
to worship as the real thing--the depository or 'ark'--into which the
supernatural 'rescue' was committed. Thus the horns of the animal--as
the idol standing for the means, equally as another representative
figure (the phallus), expressive of the mighty means to which man’s
existence and multiplication was entrusted--were exalted for adoration,
and placed as the trophies heroically '*won even out of the reluctance
and hostility of nature*',

and adored, not for themselves, but for that of which they spoke.

Shakspeare has several covert allusions to the dignity of the myth of
the 'Horns'. There is much more, probably, in these spoils of the
chase--the branching horns or the antlers--than is usually supposed.
They indicate infinitely greater things than when they are only seen
placed aloft as sylvan trophies. The crest of his late Royal Highness
Prince Albert displays the Runic horns, or the horns of the Northern
mythic hero. They were always a mark of princely and of conquering
eminence, and they are frequently observable in the crests and blazon of
the soldier-chiefs, the Princes of Germany. They come from the original
Taut, Tat, Thoth, Teat, whence 'Teuton' and 'Teutonic'. These names
derive from the mystic Mercurius

The 'horns' of the Talmud account for the mythological *Minotaur*, the
Bucen*taur*, Pan and Priapus, the 'Sagittary' or Centaur, the sign
'Sagittarius', and perhaps all bicorporate human and animal forms.

In the group of figures above, showing the various classical forms of
the volutes, or flourished horns, in the Corinthian, Ionic, and
Composite capitals, a close affinity will be remarked to examples of
capitals with horns or volutes from the temple of Ellora, in India, and
other Indian and Persian temples: placed under, for comparison, in the
illustration.

Various mouldings, both Gothic and Classic, present shapes drawn from
the astronomical sign 'Aquarius'. These signs, or ciphers, are
significant of the 'Sea' and of the 'Moon'. Glyphs resembling 'fishes'
mean Iona, or Jonah. They are also symbols of the 'Saviour', when they
occur amidst the relics left by the early Christians, and in forms of
the first Christian centuries.
