### CHAPTER THE FOURTH

#### ROSICRUCIANISM IN STRANGE SYMBOLS

IN the following part of our book we supply, in a series of figures, the
succession of changes to which the most ancient head-covering--in itself
a significant hieroglyph--the Phrygian cap, the classic Mithraic cap,
the sacrificial cap, or *bonnet conique*, all deducing from a common
symbolical ancestor, became subject, The Mithraic or Phrygian cap is the
origin of the priestly mitre in all faiths. It was worn by the priest in
sacrifice. When worn by a male, it had its crest, comb, or point, set
jutting forward; when worn by a female, it bore the same prominent part
of the cap in reverse, or on the nape of the neck, as in the instance of
the Amazon's helmet, displayed in all old sculptures, or that of
Pallas-Athene, as exhibited in the figures of Minerva. The peak, *pic*,
or point, of caps or hats (the term 'cocked hat' is a case .in point)
all refer to the same idea. This point had a sanctifying meaning
afterwards attributed to it, when it was called the *christa*, *crista*,
or crest, which signifies a triumphal top, or tuft. The 'Grenadier Cap',
and the loose black Hussar Cap, derive remotely from the same sacred,
Mithraic, or emblematical bonnet, or high pyramidal-cap. It, in this
instance, changes to black, because it is

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

devoted to the illustration of the 'fire-workers' (grenadiers), who,
among modern military, succeed the Vulcanists, *Cyclopes*, classic
'smiths', or servants of Vulcan, or Mulciber, the artful worker among
the metals in the fire, or amidst the forces of nature. This idea will
be found by a reference to the high cap among the Persians, or
Fire-Worshippers; and to the black cap among the Bohemians and in the
East. All travellers in Eastern lands will remember that the tops of the
minarets reminded them of the high-pointed black caps of the Persians.

The Phrygian Cap is a most recondite antiquarian form; the symbol comes
from the highest antiquity. It is displayed on the head of the figure
sacrificing in the celebrated sculpture, called the 'Mithraic Sacrifice'
(or the Mythical Sacrifice), in the British Museum. This loose cap, with
the point protruded, gives the original form from which all helmets or
defensive headpieces, whether Greek or Barbarian, deduce. As a Phrygian
Cap, or Symbolizing Cap, it is always *sanguine* in its colour. It then
stands as the 'Cap of Liberty', a revolutionary form; also, in another
way, it is even a civic or *incorporated* badge. It is always masculine
in its meaning. It marks the 'needle' of the obelisk, the crown or tip
of the *phallus*, whether 'human' or representative. It has its origin
in the rite of circumcision--unaccountable as are both the symbol and
the rite.

The real meaning of the *bonnet rouge*, or 'cap of liberty', has been
involved from time immemorial in deep obscurity, notwithstanding that it
has always been regarded as a most important hieroglyph or figure. It
signifies the supernatural simultaneous 'sacrifice' and 'triumph'. It
has descended from the time of Abraham, and it is supposed to emblem the
strange mythic rite of the '*circumcisio preputii*'. The loose

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Phrygian bonnet,
*bonnet conique*, or 'cap of liberty' may be accepted as figuring, or
standing for, that detached integument or husk, separated from a certain
point or knob, which has various names in different languages, and which
supplies the central idea of this 'sacrificial rite--the spoil or refuse
of which (absurd and unpleasant as it may seem) is borne aloft at once
as a 'trophy' and as the 'cap of liberty'. It is now a magic sign, and
becomes a talisman of supposedly inexpressible power--from what
particular dark reason it would be difficult to say. The whole is a sign
of 'initiation', and of baptism of a peculiar kind. The Phrygian cap,
ever after this first inauguration, has stood as the sign of the
'Enlightened'. The heroic figures in most Gnostic Gems, which we give in
our illustrations, have caps of this kind. The sacrificer in the
sculptured group of the 'Mithraic Sacrifice', among the marbles in the
British Museum, has a Phrygian cap on his head, whilst in the act of
striking the Bull with the poniard--meaning the office of the immolating
priest. The *bonnet conique* is the mitre of the Doge of Venice.

Besides the *bonnet rouge*, the Pope's mitre--nay, all mitres or conical
head-coverings--have their name from the terms 'Mithradic', or
'Mithraic'. The origin of this whole class of names is Mittra, or
Mithra. The cap of the grenadier, the shape of which is alike all over
Europe, is related to the Tartar lambskin caps, which are dyed black;
and it is black also from its association with Vulcan and the
'Fire-Worshippers' (Smiths). The Scotch Glengarry cap will prove on
examination to be only a 'cocked' Phrygian. All the black conical caps,
and the meaning of this strange symbol, came from the East. The loose
black fur caps derive from the Tartars.

The forms of Grenadier caps, and of those worn by Pioneers also, are
those of the head-covers of the Fire-workers or Fire-raisers
(Vulcanists) of an army. All the black fur caps--militarily called
busbies are Bohemian, Ishmaelitish, heathen, irregular; their origin
lies in the magic East.

Few would suspect the uniform of the Hussars to have had a religious
origin; both the flaps which depend from their bushy fur caps, and the
loose jacket or *dolman* which hangs from their left shoulder, are
mythic. 'The long triangular flaps, which hang down like a jelly-bag,
consist in a *double* slip of cloth, which,

whether the above-named *double* fly of the Hussar Cap be not the

original fur cap of Tubal-Cain, or the Smiths, or 'Artful Workers in
Nature'. The name Hussar is borrowed from the Oriental exclamation to
(or invocation of) 'Al *huza*', 'Al-husa', or Venus, or Aphrodite--the
original patroness of these Ishmaelitish irregular light troops. The
*dolman* or pelisse, properly worn on the left shoulder of the Hussar,
has its signification and origin in the following act related in
Scripture, which refers to a certain Rosicrucian myth: 'Shem and Japheth

piece of clothing), 'and laid it upon both their shoulders' (on the left
shoulder of each), 'and went backward, and covered their father Noah.'
It is astonishing how successfully this mythic act, with its original
strange Rosicrucian meaning, should have been hidden away in this
apparently little corresponding, trivial fact, of the wearing of the
Hussar loose cloak or pelisse (*pallium* or pall) on the left or
sinister shoulder; which is the shoulder nearest to the *woman:* because
the *Talmudists say that Man was Made from the left hand*.

Regarding the Templar *insignia*, we may make the following remarks. The
famous flag, or 'Beauséant', was their distinguishing symbol.
Beauséant--that is to say, in the Gallic tongue, *Bien-séant*; because
they are fair and honourable to the friends of Christ, but black and
terrible to His enemies: 'Vexillum bipartitum, ex Albo et Nigro, quod
nominant "Beau-séant", id est; Gallica lingua, "*Bien-séant*", eo quod
Christi amices candidi sunt et benigni, inimices vero terribiles atque
nigri' (Jac. de Vitr. *Hist. Hierosol*. apud *Gesta Dei*, cap. lxv).

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

The Cardinal de Vitry is totally uninformed as to the meaning and
purpose indicated in this mysterious banner. Its black and white was
originally derived from the Egyptian sacred 'black and white', and it
conveys the same significant meanings.

Now, in the heraldic sense--as we shall soon see--there is no colour
*white*. *Argent* is the silver of the moon's light, the light of the
'woman'; or it is light generally, in opposition to darkness, which is
the absence of all colour. White is the synthesis and identity of *all*
the colours--in other words, it is light. Thus white is blazoned, in the
correct heraldic sense, as also in reference to its humid, feminine
origin (for, as the old heralds say, 'light was begotten of darkness',
and its 'type, product, and representative, woman, also'), as the
melancholy or silver light of the moon, 'Argent'; also, in the higher
heraldic grade, 'Pearl', as signifying tears; lastly, 'Luna', whose
figure or mark is the crescent <span id="img_28600"></span>
![](img/28600.jpg), or <span id="img_28601"></span> ![](img/28601.jpg);
which is either the new moon (or the moon of hope), or the moon of the
Moslem (or 'horned moon resting on her back'). Black (or *sable*,
*sab*., *sabbat*, *Sat*., Saturn) is the absence of light, and is
blazoned 'sable', diamond (carbon, or the densest of matter), 'without
form and void', but cradle of possibilities, 'end' being taken as
synonymous with 'beginning'. It is *sab*., or Saturn, whose mark is ♄,
and who is both masculine and feminine--sex being indifferent to this
'Divine Abstraction, whose face is masked in Darkness.'

*Lykos*--'wolf', *lykê*--'light'; whence comes *Lux* (Volney, 1st
English edition, 1792, p. 378). 'Je' and 'V' are of Tartar origin. It is
probable that St. John's College at Cambridge is the *Domus Templi* of
the Round Church of the Templars there. The present St. John's is only
of modern foundation. There is annexed to, or connected with, this
church

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

an almshouse called 'Bede's House', the name of which has puzzled all
the antiquaries. There is little doubt that this was the original *Domus
Templi*, the house of Buddha, corrupted into Bede, and meaning 'wisdom'.

*A Discourse concerning the Tartars, proving (in all probability) that
they are the Israelites, or Ten Tribes which, being taken captive by
Salmaneser, were transplanted into Media. By Giles Fletcher, Doctor of
Both Laws, and sometime Ambassador from Elizabeth, Queen of England, to
the Emperor of Russia*. This was found in Sir Francis Nethersole's study
after his death (*Memoirs of the Life of William Whiston*, 1749)

Mr. Cavendish, an eminent chemist, 'had reason to be persuaded that the
*very water itself* consisted solely of inflammable air united to
dephlogisticated air.' This last conclusion has since been strengthened
very much by some subsequent experiments of Dr. Priestley’s (see p. 299
of *Morsels of Criticism, tending to illustrate some few passages in the
Holy Scriptures upon Philosophical Principles*. 2d. edition, 2 vols.
8vo. London: J Davis, Chancery Lane, 1800).

The jewel of the Rossi-crucians (Rosicrucians) is formed of a
transparent red stone, with a red *cross* on one side, and a red *rose*
on the other--thus, it is a *crucified rose*. The Rossi--or
Rosy--crucians' ideas concerning this emblematical red cross and red
rose probably came from the fable of Adonis--who was the sun whom we
have seen so often crucified--being changed into a red rose by Venus
(see Drummond's *Origines*, vol. iii. p. 121). *Rus* (which is *Ras* in
Chaldee) in Irish signifies 'tree', 'knowledge', 'science', magic',
'power'. This is the Hebrew *R--as*. Hence the Persian *Rustan* (*Val.
Col. Hib.* vol. iv: pt. i. p. 84). 'The ancient Sardica, in lat. 40°
50´, is now called "Sophia"'; the ancient Aquineum,

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

Buda, or Buddha. These were, I believe, old names restored' (*vide*
D’Anville's *Atlas*). The society bearing the name of the Rosicrucians
(or Rosicruxians) is closely allied with the Templars. Their emblem is a
monogram or jewel; or, as malicious And bigoted adversaries would say,
their 'object of adoration' is a 'red rose on a cross'. Thus:

<span id="img_28800"></span> ![Fig. 226](img/28800.jpg)  
Fig. 226

When it can be done, it is surrounded with a glory, and placed on a
Calvary. This is the Naurutz, Natsir, or Rose of Isuren, of Tamul, or
Sharon, or the Water-Rose, the Lily Padma, Pema, Lotus 'crucified' for
the salvation of man--crucified in the heavens at the Vernal Equinox. It
is celebrated at that time by the Persians in what they call their
Nou-Rose, i.e. Neros, or Naurutz (Malcolm's *History of Persia*, vol.
ii. p. 406). The Tudor Rose, or *Rose-en-Soleil* (the Rose of the Order
of the Garter), is the Rosicrucian 'Red Rose', crucified, with its rays
of glory, or golden sunbeams, or mythical thorns, *issuant* from its
white, immaculate 'centre-point', or 'lily-point'--all which have
further occult meanings lying hidden in theurgic mysticism. All these
are spoken in the famous 'Round Table' of the Prince (and Origin) of
Christian knighthood, King Arthur. His table is now hanging on the wall,
dusty and neglected, over the. 'King’s Seat or Bench' in the Court-House
on the Castle Hill of our ancient Winchester. But upon this abstruse
subject of

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

the Round Table we have spoken more fully in another place. See Elias
Ashmole.

Pope John XIV, about the year 970, issued a Bull for the baptizing of
bells 'To cleanse the air of devils'; with which it was imagined to be
full in the time of storms or of public commotion. To this end, the
kettledrums of the Lacedæmonians were also supposed to be used on all
extraordinarily harmful occasions. Pagodas are uprights and obelisks,
with the same meaning as other steeples, and their angles are set about
with bells, which are agitated in the wind, and are supposed to exercise
the same power of driving off evil spirits. Vesper bells secure
spiritual serenity. The bells of the churches are tolled in
thunderstorms still, in some parishes in England, supposedly to disperse
the clouds, and to open their rifts for the returning sunshine.

Edward the First of England was in every way an extraordinary man. There
are certain reasons for supposing that he was really initiated in
Eastern occult ideas. It is to be remembered that he made the Crusade to
Palestine. He invited to England, Guido dalla Colonna, the author of the
Troy-book *Tale of Troy*; and he also invited Raymond Lully into his
kingdom. Raymond Lully is affirmed to have supplied to Edward six
millions of money, to enable him to carry on war against the Turks. The
origin of the rose-nobles is from the Rosicrucians.

No. 1. Catherine-wheel window--12 columns. Query, the 12 signs, with the
Rose, Disc, or Lotus, in the centre? From a Saracenic fountain near the
Council-House, Jerusalem. This fountain seems to be built of fragments;
the proof of which is that this inscribed stone (No. 2) is placed over
half the *discus*. The whole structure, though Oriental or Saracenic,
abounds with Gothic or pointed features. Such are

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

the frets, the spandrel-work, the hood-moulding, etc.

No. 3. Query, 'Aquarii'? The *Aquarii* always indicate the Lunar
element, or the female. The Baptisteries dedicated to St. John, or to
the S.S., are eight-sided. The *Baptisteria* in Italy follow the same
emblematical rule. The sections into which the Order of the Knights of
Malta were divided were eight, answering to the eight points of the
cross, which was their emblem. The Order was composed of eight nations,
whereof the English, which was one, disappeared at the Reformation.

The colours of the monastic knightly orders were the following: The
Teutonic Knights wore white, with the eight-pointed black cross; the
Knights of Malta wore black, with the eight-pointed white cross. The

foregoing obtained their Black and White from the Egyptians. The Knights
Templars, or Red-Cross Knights, wore white, with the eight-pointed
Bhuddist red cross displayed on their mantles. The Guardian of the
Temple Chapel was called '*Custos Capellæ*, (*Capella*, a 'kid', 'star',
'she-goat', also 'chapel').

Attila, surnamed the Scourge of God', is represented as having worn a
'Teraphim', or head, on his breast--

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

a snaky-haired head, which purported to be that of Nimrod, whom he
claimed as his great progenitor. This same Medusa-like head was an
object of adoration to the heretical followers of Marcion, and was the
Palladium set up by Antiochus Epiphanes, at Antioch, though it has been
called the visage of Charon. This Charon may be 'Dis'--or the 'Severe',
or 'Dark', Deity.

The human head is a magnet, with a natural electric circle moving in the
path of the sun. The sign of this

ring is serpentine, and is Σ; each man being considered--as far as his
head is concerned--as magnetic. The positive pole of the magnet is the
*os frontis, sinciput, os sublime*. The negative pole is the *occiput*.

Tonsure of the head is considered as a sacred observance. Hair (*in se*)
is barbarous, and is the mark and investiture of the beasts. The
Cabalists abstained from wine and marriage. Tonsure means 'the sun's
disc' in the East. 'Les Arabes, dit Hérodote, lib. iii. se rasent la
tête en rond et autour des tempes, ainsi que se rasait, disent-ils,
Bacchus' (Volney, *Ruines*, p. 265). 'La touffe qui conservent les

Most of the Chapter-Houses of the Cathedrals are eight-sided. In this
they imitate the eight-sided or 'Bhuddist' cross of the Templars. This
is the crown, cap, capital, chapiter, tabernacle, mythic *domus templi*,
or *domus Dei*. They are miniature, mystical Round Churches, or 'Tors'.
The Chapter-Houses oblong in shape are imitative of the 'Ark' of the
Mosaical Covenant. All the Basilicas are of this figure. The symbol is a
parallelogram, or an oblong, when the shape adopted is that of the
temples. It then is the *navis*, 'nave', or ship--which is the 'Argo'.

and was often expressed by β or υ, and also γ. For this the figure of a
double Γ, or <span id="img_29301"></span> ![](img/29301.jpg), was
invented, whence the name Digamma; which was called Æolic, because the
Æolians, of all the tribes, retained the greatest traces of the original
language. Thus, the Æolians wrote or pronounced Fοίνος, Fελέα, *velia*.
The Latin language was derived from the Æolic dialect, and naturally
adopted the Digamma, which it generally
