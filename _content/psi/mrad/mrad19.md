### XVIII

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> casual reader may be bored by too
many of these drawings, but they are easy to skip, or to take in at a
glance, and there may be students who will want to examine them
carefully. So I will add a selection of the significant drawings, with
only brief remarks. I begin with what I have called partial successes,
and then add a few more of those I have called "complete."

Let us return to the early drawings, made by my secretary. On the
automobile ride to Pasadena, there was an ash-can ([fig.
100](#img_fig100)):

<span id="img_fig100"></span> ![Fig. 100](img/fig100.jpg)

For the above my wife wrote: "I see a chain dangling from
something—resembling little chimney pot on top of house."

And here is design for which the comment

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

was: "These somehow belong together but won't get together" ([figs. 101,
101a](#img_fig101)):

<span id="img_fig101"></span> ![Fig. 101, Fig. 101a](img/fig101.jpg)

Here is a fan, with comment: "Inside seems irregular, as if cloth draped
or crumpled" ([figs. 102, 102a](#img_fig102)):

<span id="img_fig102"></span> ![Fig. 102, Fig. 102a](img/fig102.jpg)

Here is a one-half success ([figs. 103, 103a](#img_fig103)):

<span id="img_fig103"></span> ![Fig. 103, Fig. 103a](img/fig103.jpg)

Here is a broom, drawn by my secretary ([fig. 104](#img_fig104)),

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

and several efforts to reproduce it ([figs. 104a, 104b](#img_fig104)):

<span id="img_fig104"></span> ![Fig. 104, Fig. 104a, Fig.
104b](img/fig104.jpg)

The comments accompanying these drawings read: "All I'm sure of is a
straight line with something curved at end of it; once it came" (here is
drawing of the flower). "Then it doubled, or reappeared, I don't know
which. (Am not sure of curly edges.) Then it was upside down."

The next drawing was a heart, and my wife got the upper half with what
are apparently blood-drops added ([figs. 105, 105a](#img_fig105)):

<span id="img_fig105"></span> ![Fig. 105, Fig. 105a](img/fig105.jpg)

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

The above is interesting, as suggesting that whatever agency furnished
the information knew more than it was telling. For if Craig's drawing, a
pair of curves, constituted a crude letter N, or had no significance,
why add the blood-drops, which were not in the original? On the other
hand, if her subconscious mind knew it was a heart, why not give her the
whole heart, and let her draw it?

So much for the drawings of my secretary; and now for my own early
drawings. When I was a school boy, we used to represent human figures in
this way; and, as you see, Craig got the essentials ([figs. 106,
106a](#img_fig106)):

<span id="img_fig106"></span> ![Fig. 106, Fig. 106a](img/fig106.jpg)

Several weeks later, I drew a pair of such figures in action and the
comment was: "It's a whirligig of some sort" ([figs. 107,
107a](#img_fig107)).

After the following drawing, Craig asked me not to do any more hands,
for the reason that she "got" this, but thought it was my own hand

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

<span id="img_fig107"></span> ![Fig. 107, Fig. 107a](img/fig107.jpg)

doing the drawing. She guessed something else, and wrote: "Turned into
pig's head, then rabbit's" ([figs. 108, 108a](#img_fig108)):

<span id="img_fig108"></span> ![Fig. 108, Fig. 108a](img/fig108.jpg)

Next, this bat, with very striking comment.

<span id="img_fig109"></span> ![Fig. 109, Fig. 109a](img/fig109.jpg)

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Looks like
ear-shaped something," and again: "Looks like calla lily" ([figs. 109,
109a](#img_fig109)):

A butterfly net ([fig. 110, 110a](#img_fig110)).

<span id="img_fig110"></span> ![Fig. 110, Fig. 110a](img/fig110.jpg)

A key ([figs. 111, 111a](#img_fig111)):

<span id="img_fig111"></span> ![Fig. 111, Fig. 111a](img/fig111.jpg)

This highly humorous sunrise ([figs. 112, 112a](#img_fig112)):

<span id="img_fig112"></span> ![Fig. 112, Fig. 112a](img/fig112.jpg)

A carnation which came after the preceding drawing, and apparently had
been anticipated in the "sunrise" ([figs. 113, 113a](#img_fig113)).

Note that this camp-stool, as I drew it, really

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span id="img_fig113"></span> ![Fig. 113, Fig. 113a](img/fig113.jpg)

does appear to be standing on water ([figs. 114, 114a](#img_fig114)):

<span id="img_fig114"></span> ![Fig. 114, Fig. 114a](img/fig114.jpg)

For this little waiter, who follows, no drawing was made by my wife. Her
written comment was: "I see at once the profile of human

<span id="img_fig115"></span> ![Fig. 115](img/fig115.jpg)

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

face. Am interrupted by radio tune. Something makes me think of a cow.
Now see two things sticking out like horns" ([figs. 115](#img_fig115)).

The following had no comment ([figs. 116, 116a](#img_fig116)):

<span id="img_fig116"></span> ![Fig. 116, Fig. 116a](img/fig116.jpg)

Nor the next one ([figs. 117, 117a](#img_fig117)):

<span id="img_fig117"></span> ![Fig. 117, Fig. 117a](img/fig117.jpg)

The comment on this caterpillar was: "Fork —then garden tool—lawn rake.
Leaf." I might add that we have a lawn-rake made of bristly bamboo,
which looks very much like my drawing ([figs. 118, 118a](#img_fig118)):

<span id="img_fig118"></span> ![Fig. 118, Fig. 118a](img/fig118.jpg)

In the following case I drew sixteen stars,

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

and you may count and see that Craig got twelve of them, and made up the
difference with a moon! ([figs. 119, 119a](#img_fig119)):

<span id="img_fig119"></span> ![Fig. 119, Fig. 119a](img/fig119.jpg)

Comment on the following: "Looks like a monkey wrench, but it may be a
yardstick" ([figs. 120, 120a](#img_fig120)):

<span id="img_fig120"></span> ![Fig. 120, Fig. 120a](img/fig120.jpg)

In the next one, the curve of the worm is amusingly reproduced by the
bird's neck. The comment added: "But it may be a snake." Craig says this
is an example of how one part of the drawing comes to her, and then, in
haste, her memory-trains and associations supply what they think should
be the rest ([figs. 121, 121a](#img_fig121)).

The umbrella brings up Craig's reptile "complex" again. I assure you
that in her garden, she turns sticks into snakes when they are far

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span id="img_fig121"></span> ![Fig. 121, Fig. 121a](img/fig121.jpg)

less snake-like than my drawing. Her comment was: "I feel that it is a
snake crawling out of something—vivid feeling of snake, but it looks
like a cat's tail" ([figs. 122, 122a](#img_fig122)):

<span id="img_fig122"></span> ![Fig. 122, Fig. 122a](img/fig122.jpg)

I drew a wall-hook to hang your coat on ([figs. 123,
123a](#img_fig123)):

<span id="img_fig123"></span> ![Fig. 123, Fig. 123a](img/fig123.jpg)

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

A design, evidently felt as a design, though not well got ([figs. 124,
124a](#img_fig124)):

<span id="img_fig124"></span> ![Fig. 124, Fig. 124a](img/fig124.jpg)

A screw, with comment: "light-house or tower. Too fat at base." If
Craig's drawing were made narrower at base, it would reproduce the screw
very well. Note that in the right-hand "tower" the screw-like effect of
the "set backs" is kept ([figs. 125, 125a](#img_fig125)):

<span id="img_fig125"></span> ![Fig. 125, Fig. 125a](img/fig125.jpg)  
Fig. 125, Fig. 125a

Here is a love story which seems to go wrong, the hearts being turned to
opposition ([figs. 126, 126a](#img_fig126)):

<span id="img_fig126"></span> ![Fig. 126, Fig. 126a](img/fig126.jpg)

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

Here is the flag, made simpler—"e pluribus unum!" ([figs. 127,
127a](#img_fig127)):

<span id="img_fig127"></span> ![Fig. 127, Fig. 127a](img/fig127.jpg)

Here is a cow, as seen by the cubists. Comment: "Something sending out
long lines from it" ([figs. 128, 128a](#img_fig128)):

<span id="img_fig128"></span> ![Fig. 128, Fig. 128a](img/fig128.jpg)

Telegraph wires, apparently seen as waves in the ether ([figs. 129,
129a](#img_fig129)):

<span id="img_fig129"></span> ![Fig. 129, Fig. 129a](img/fig129.jpg)

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

Comment on the following: "Horns. Can't see what they are attached to"
([figs. 130, 130a](#img_fig130)):

<span id="img_fig130"></span> ![Fig. 130, Fig. 130a](img/fig130.jpg)

And here is a parrot turned into a leaf, with comment. "See veins and
stem with sharp vivid bend in it"—which seems to indicate a sense of the
parrot's beak ([figs. 131, 131a](#img_fig131)):

<span id="img_fig131"></span> ![Fig. 131, Fig. 131a](img/fig131.jpg)
