<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">What</span> are the principles upon which I have classified the drawings, as between successes, partial successes, and failures? I will use this series, number eight, to illustrate. There are eight drawings, and I have set them down as one success, six partial successes, one failure. The success is the rooster (<A HREF="mrad15.htm#img_fig061">fig. 61</A>), called "a rooster," even though it "looks like a coffee pot." The partial successes are, first, an electric light bulb, very crudely imitated as to shape in three drawings. Perhaps this was hardly good enough to be counted; it was a border-line case, and probably the poorest that I admitted to the classification of "partial successes" (<A HREF="#img_fig063">fig. 63a</A>).</p>  
<p>Second, the ascending sky-rocket, already printed as <A HREF="mrad13.htm#img_fig038">fig. 38</A>, giving rise to six different drawings of whirligigs and light. Third, the following drawing, for which Craig wrote: "See spider, or some sort of legged pest. If this is</p>  
<p><a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="green">p. 122</font></A></p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig063"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig063.jpg" ALT="Fig. 63a"></p>  
<p>not a spider, there is a spider in the lot somewhere! This I know!" (<A HREF="#img_fig064">fig. 64</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig064"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig064.jpg" ALT="Fig. 64'"></p>  
<p>The fourth partial success was a drawn bow, with arrow fitted, ready to be launched. Craig</p>  
<p><a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="green">p. 123</font></A></p>  
<p>wrote as follows: "Picked this up and saw inside as it dropped on floor&#151;so did not try it. Suddenly recall I have already 'seen' it earlier." Before starting the tests, along with her written mention of "a rooster," she had drawn a bow and crude arrow, and the resemblance is so exact that it seems to me entitled to be called a partial success (<A HREF="#img_fig065">figs. 65, 65a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig065"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig065.jpg" ALT="Fig. 65, Fig. 65a"></p>  
<p>Fifth, the wagon hub (<A HREF="mrad15.htm#img_fig060">fig. 60</A>), which became the deer's muzzle. And finally the laced-up football (<A HREF="mrad07.htm#img_fig015">fig. 15</A>) which became a belly-band on a calf (<A HREF="mrad07.htm#img_fig015">fig. 15a</A>).</p>  
<p>As for the failure in this series, it is a cake of soap, which was called "whirls." There are a couple of other drawings in the series, marked: "Too tired to see it," and "Tired now and excited and keep seeing old things"&#151;meaning, of course, the preceding drawings.</p>  
<p><a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></A></p>  
<p>I tried to avoid drawing the same object more than once, but now and then I slipped up. In series eleven I drew another rooster, and there followed, not one "anticipation," but several. Drawing number one was a tooth; Craig wrote: "First see rooster. Then elephant." Drawing number two was an elephant; and Craig wrote: "Elephant came again. I try to suppress it, and see lines, and a spike sticking some way into something." She drew it, and it seems clear that the "spike" is the elephant's tusk, and the head of the "spike" is the elephant's eye (<A HREF="#img_fig066">figs. 66, 66a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig066"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig066.jpg" ALT="Fig. 66, Fig. 66a"></p>  
<p>Next, number three, was the rooster. But Craig had set "rooster" down in her mind as a blunder, so now she wrote: "I don't know what, see a bunch, or tuft clearly. Also a crooked arm</p>  
<p><a name="page_125"><font size="1" color="green">p. 125</font></A></p>  
<p>on a body. But don't feel that I'm right." Here are the drawings, and you can see that she was somewhat right (<A HREF="#img_fig067">figs. 67, 67a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig067"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig067.jpg" ALT="Fig. 67, Fig. 67a"></p>  
<p>This series eleven, containing fourteen drawings, is marked: "Did this lot rapidly, without holding (mind) blank. The chicken and elephant came <i>at once</i>, on a very earnest request to my mind to 'come across.'" I have classified in this series two successes, five partial, and five failures: throwing out numbers twelve and fourteen, because Craig wrote: "Nothing except all the preceding ones come&#151;too many at once&#151;all past ones crowding in memory"; and again, "Nothing but everything in the preceding. Too many of them in my mind."</p>  
<p>The anticipations run all through this series in a quite fascinating way. Thus, for number</p>  
<p><a name="page_126"><font size="1" color="green">p. 126</font></A></p>  
<p>four Craig wrote: "Flower. This is a very vivid one. Green spine&#151;leaves like century plant." She drew figure <A HREF="#img_fig068">68a</A>:</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig068"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig068.jpg" ALT="Fig. 68a"></p>  
<p>And then again, for drawing number seven, she did more flowers, with this comment: "This is a <i>real</i> flower, I've seen it before. It's vivid and returns. Century plant? Now it turns into candle stick. See a candle" (<A HREF="#img_fig069">fig. 69a</A>).</p>  
<p>All this was wrong&#151;so far. Number four was a table, and number seven was the rear half of a cow. But now we come to number eleven, the plant known as a "cat-tail," which seems to resemble rather surprisingly the lower of the two</p>  
<p><a name="page_127"><font size="1" color="green">p. 127</font></A></p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig069"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig069.jpg" ALT="Fig. 69a"></p>  
<p>drawings in figure <A HREF="#img_fig069">69a</A>. My drawing is given as figure <A HREF="#img_fig070">70</A>, and the one Craig made for it is given as <A HREF="#img_fig070">70a</A>.</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig070"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig070.jpg" ALT="Fig. 70, Fig. 70a"></p>  
<p>Comment on the above read: "Very pointed. Am not able to see what. Dog's head?"</p>  
<p>Drawing five was a large fish-hook; and this inspired the experimenter to a discourse, as follows:</p>  
<p><a name="page_128"><font size="1" color="green">p. 128</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "Dog wagging&#151;see tail in air busy wagging&#151;jolly doggie&#151;tail curled in air." And then: "Now I see a cow. I fear the elephant and chicken got me too sure of animals. But I see these."</p>  
<p>Now, a big fish-hook looks not unlike a "tail curled in air." But when we come to number seven, we discover what Craig was apparently anticipating. It is the drawing of what I have referred to as "the rear half of a cow." It is badly done, with a cow's hoof, but I forgot what a cow's tail is like, and this tail that I drew would fit much better on a "jolly doggy," you must admit (<A HREF="#img_fig071">fig. 71</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig071"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig071.jpg" ALT="Fig. 71"></p>  
<p>Drawing number six was a sun, as children draw it, a circle with rays going out all round. Craig wrote: "Setting sun and bird in sky. Big</p>  
<p><a name="page_129"><font size="1" color="green">p. 129</font></A></p>  
<p>bird on wing&#151;seagull or wild goose." This I called a partial success. Number nine was the muzzle end of an old-style cannon, already reported in figs. <A HREF="mrad14.htm#img_fig046">46, 46a</A>.</p>  
<p>I conclude the study of this particular series with drawing thirteen, to which was added the comment: "Think of a saucer, then of a cup. It's something in the kitchen. Too tired to see" (<A HREF="#img_fig072">figs. 72, 72a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig072"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig072.jpg" ALT="Fig. 72, Fig. 72a"></p>  
<p>In series fourteen, drawing three, Craig wrote: "Man running, can't draw it." She drew as follows (<A HREF="#img_fig073a">fig. 73a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig073a"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig073a.jpg" ALT="Fig. 73a"></p>  
<p><a name="page_130"><font size="1" color="green">p. 130</font></A></p>  
<p>Next came my drawing four, as follows (<A HREF="#img_fig073">fig. 73</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig073"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig073.jpg" ALT="Fig. 73"></p>  
<p>In series thirty-five I first drew a fire hydrant, and Craig wrote, "Peafowl," and added the following drawing, which certainly constitutes a partial success (<A HREF="#img_fig074">figs. 74, 74a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig074"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig074.jpg" ALT="Fig. 74, Fig. 74a"></p>  
<p>My next drawing was the peafowl, as you see. For this Craig wrote: "Peafowl again," and apparently</p>  
<p><a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="green">p. 131</font></A></p>  
<p>tried to draw the peafowl's neck, and a lot of those spots which I had forgotten are an appurtenance of peafowls (<A HREF="#img_fig075">figs. 75, 75a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig075"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig075.jpg" ALT="Fig. 75, Fig. 75a"></p>  
<p>In series twenty-nine I drew an elevated railway. If you turn it upside down, as I have done here, it looks like water and smoke-stacks. Anyhow, Craig drew a steamboat (<A HREF="#img_fig076">figs. 76, 76a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig076"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig076.jpg" ALT="Fig. 76, Fig. 76a"></p>  
<p><a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="green">p. 132</font></A></p>  
<p>And then came my next drawing&#151;a steamboat! Craig wrote: "Smoke again," and drew the smoke and the stack (<A HREF="#img_fig077">figs. 77, 77</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig077"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig077.jpg" ALT="Fig. 77, Fig. 77a"></p>  
<p>She added two more drawings, which appear to be the wheel of the boat in the water, and the smoke (<A HREF="#img_fig077b">figs. 77b, 77c</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig077b"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig077b.jpg" ALT="Fig. 77b, Fig. 77c"></p>  
<p><a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="green">p. 133</font></A></p>  
<p>In series thirty I drew a fish-hook with line, and you see it turned into a flower (<A HREF="#img_fig078">figs. 78, 78a</A>);</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig078"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig078.jpg" ALT="Fig. 78, Fig. 78a"></p>  
<p>Then came an obelisk, and Craig got it, but with novel effects, thus (<A HREF="#img_fig079">figs. 79, 79a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig079"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig079.jpg" ALT="Fig. 79, Fig. 79a"></p>  
<p>Now why should an obelisk go on a jag, and have little circles at its base? The answer appears to be: it inherited the curves from the previous fish-hook, and the little circles from the next drawing. You will see that, having used</p>  
<p><a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="green">p. 134</font></A></p>  
<p>up her supply of little circles, Craig did not get the next drawing so well (<A HREF="#img_fig080">figs. 80, 80a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig080"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig080.jpg" ALT="Fig. 80 Fig. 80a"></p>  
<p>In series twenty-two I first drew a bed, and Craig made two attempts to draw a potted plant. My second drawing was a maltese cross, and Craig turned it into a basket (<A HREF="#img_fig081">figs. 81, 81a</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig081"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig081.jpg" ALT="Fig. 81 Fig. 81a"></p>  
<p>But she could not give up her plant. She added: "There is a flower basket in this lot, or potted plant." The next drawing was a fleur-de-lys,</p>  
<p><a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="green">p. 135</font></A></p>  
<p>which looks not unlike a potted plant or hanging basket (<A HREF="#img_fig082">fig. 82</A>):</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_fig082"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/fig082.jpg" ALT="Fig. 82"></p>  
<p>In drawing four she got the elements of a door-knob pretty well, and added: "See head of bird, too&#151;eagle beak." Drawing seven was a crane, with beak open.</p>
