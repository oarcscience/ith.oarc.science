### CHAPTER 15

#### <span class="smallcaps">Summary and Concluding Remarks</span>

It seems likely that a table summarizing the general totals of those
chapters giving the main figures would be of some convenience to the
reader here. There are two columns showing X-values <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100) (anti-chance) for the results, the last
column giving that obtained by formula and the next to

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

the last, the X-value given by the pooled results. The formula method
is,

I believe, the more proper, but figures of both are so high as to leave
dispute pointless. Also there are included in these totals all the
results of all experiments, even those made with a view to reducing the
score-level (drug experiments, etc.). However, in the low-score work of
Stuart and Pearce in which they purposely reversed the calling, I change
the negative sign of deviation to positive in pooling these results with
the others. There were altogether 1,575 of these. The average successes
per 25 trials are given in column 4.

Several thousands of test data have accumulated as I have worked at this
manuscript but these cannot be included in the totals here without some
description of conditions; furthermore, it seems very doubtful if any
one can have the appetite for more of these figures. I need only say
that these data are in general in line with those already presented and
would alter no conclusion offered here, if fully incorporated.

#### MAJOR CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS

1\. It is independently established on the basis of this work alone that
Extra-Sensory Perception is an actual and demonstrable occurrence.

2\. E.S.P. is demonstrated to occur under P.C. or pure clairvoyance
conditions, with not only the sensory and rational functions, but
telepathic ability as well, excluded by the conditions.

3\. E.S.P. is also demonstrated to occur equally well under P.T. or pure
telepathy conditions, with clairvoyance excluded along with the sensory
and rational cognition.

4\. E.S.P. occurs equally well and at similar levels of scoring in both
P.C. and P.T., as shown by actual measurement, using equal probabilities
and similar general conditions. The reasons are many for believing that
in P.C. and P.T. the same general mental function is at work.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(a\) All major subjects, except one, <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101) have ability in both P.T. and P.C.

\(b\) Their results, individually and totally, are of nearly the same
scoring-level in both P.T. and P.C.

\(c\) Daily fluctuations in both take the same direction,
preponderantly.

\(d\) Both are affected in the same way and in approximately the same
degree by sodium amytal.

\(e\) Caffeine affects both in the same direction.

\(f\) Both function with considerable distances between percipient and
perceived (agent or object).

\(g\) Both show with distance, when the subject can work at all above
np, a rise in scoring-rate over that achieved in the same room.

</div>

These and other similarities all strongly favor the belief (though I do
not say they establish it) that in P.C. and P.T. we have to do with a
common underlying process, capable of functioning in the cognition of
two different perceptual units, mental activities (images in these
tests) and material objects (card figures). No differentiating
circumstance whatever has been discovered contrary to this belief.

5\. The Wave theory seems to be inapplicable to these results, in view
of the distance experiments and the absence of any decline of results
with distance. The assumption that the wave theorist must make—namely,
that the ink-figure would radiate the same waves as the active mind of
the agent—is fantastic. A further difficulty for wave theories is found
in the D.T. work, which ought, on that theory, to give a hopeless jumble
of waves. These and other difficulties compel the rejection of the
wave-theory—which is the only type that modern physics has yet to offer.

6\. Likewise it is shown that E.S.P. is not a sensory phenomenon. The
absence of any need of orientation, of any sensory localization, of any
recognized stimulating energy such as the senses receive and of any
awareness of reception all lead to the rejection of the sixth sense
hypothesis as well. E.S.P. shows also much greater need for integration
than does the sensory level of mental processes.

7\. At the same time, the definite volitional control over E.S.P. shown
by all the percipients, the large role of effort and voluntary attention
apparent in all, the retarding effect of dissociative drugs and other
factors all tend (first) to exclude the hypothesis that the percipient
is a mere passive receptor of an incorporeal agent's intruding action,
and (second) to make E.S.P. a part of the natural organization of the
species. E.S.P. is directed by the conation of the percipient, and
integrates naturally with the other cognitive and with the affective
processes of the percipient's mind.

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

#### SOME MINOR POINTS AND IMPRESSIONS

1\. Good abstraction is required for success in most percipients, along
with effort and attention to the task; in a word, "concentration".

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(a\) New changes in procedure may disturb this for a time.

\(b\) New visitors as witnesses are likely to do so for a time.

\(c\) Conflict of purposes (and, of course, emotions) spoil
concentration.

\(d\) Dissociation lowers, along with other functions, the capacity to
concentrate.

</div>

2\. Since E.S.P. harmonizes with the other mental processes and adds its
function as a less restricted mode of perception, it can conceivably
have great practical personal value.

3\. E.S.P. would seem to possess, potentially, a considerable biological
(species survival) value. It may be inferable from the drug data that it
is a later evolutionary acquisition, as evidenced by its higher
organization, which is in turn indicated by its easier disturbance by
amytal and fatigue. This chain of inference is none too strong and may
be put down, not as a "point" but as an "impression".

4\. It seems favorably suggested, at least, that E.S.P. may be heritable
or perhaps its more common inhibiting factors may be.

5\. The loss of E.S.P. ability with long use is the exception rather
than the rule. The ability may decline and return. It may also decline
with the daily run.

6\. E.S.P. may run consistently below chance expectation if there is
unconscious (and, of course, if there be conscious) negative tendency of
sufficient strength.

7\. The "curves of operation" found are probably motivational in origin.
There is evidence that interest, effort and attention vary, and cause
results to vary; there is no clear evidence yet that E.S.P. ability *per
se* varies.

8\. Improvement in E.S.P. is limited, usually to a short initial period;
and this may be purely a matter of learning to abstract and achieve good
concentration. There is no good evidence of improvement of the ability.
A level seems to be reached and not far exceeded. When it is exceeded
for particular runs it seems to be through special effort.

9\. Variation of the procedure, without introducing new changes, helps
to keep up the scoring level. Encouragement is usually helpful. Light
humors and moods are the best in which to work at E.S.P.

10\. There are many facts supporting a view that E.S.P. is easily
encroached upon by rational and sensory processes, and that the delicate
balance required for good E.S.P. may be concerned chiefly with the
maintenance of the field of attention free from these encroachments.
Perhaps

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

this is why improvement is shown so uniformly with distance (*i.e.*,
when complete failure does not attend it). Distance discourages sensory
attention and would aid abstraction.

11\. The following laws or relations seem to hold between agent and
percipient, but the evidential support is as yet not fully adequate,
particularly so for No. 3:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

\(1\) Good E.S.P. ability in both agent and percipient seems to give
highest results.

\(2\) Good E.S.P. ability in the percipient with poor ability in the
agent gives mediocre results.

\(3\) Poor E.S.P. ability in the percipient, regardless of what the
agent may be like, does not give results above chance.

</div>

12\. E.S.P. is not easily fatigued. In P.T. the agent tends to suffer
from fatigue, but the percipient does not.

13\. Loss of E.S.P. ability by an occasional subject may be due to
incapacitation for the necessary abstraction under the conditions,
rather than a loss of the E.S.P. function itself.

#### SOME HYPOTHESES OFFERED

1\. The general impression is given by the life histories of these major
subjects that there may be a general connection between E.S.P. and many
other parapsychological phenomena. This may at least, be offered as a
working hypothesis.

2\. The distance data, along with the general facts, suggest the freedom
of mind in E.S.P. from the common material relations of extension or
distance. This would mean the "de-materialization" of mind operating
under these conditions. This is psychologically important, as bearing
upon the question of the body-mind relation, upon personality-survival
and some of the other questions in the natural philosophy of mind.

3\. The large role of conation evidenced in E.S.P., the failure of the
radiation laws to apply to its phenomena and the fact that P.C. scoring
is as good as P.T., along with the accuracy attained in D.T. at short
distances and in B.T. at longer ones, all suggest the view that the
percipient's mind "goes out" to the object or mental act that is to be
perceived, and that this projection of mind is a peculiarly
non-mechanistic procedure, since by the latter theoretically there would
be no projection—simply radiation on a spherical front, with intensity
declining with the square of the distance.

4\. E.S.P. influences other processes that direct overt behavior and
hence it affects, however indirectly, the recognized doing of work. This
is itself doing work, however little it may be. It is thus inescapably
"energetic" (even as the physicist means the word—"capable of doing

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

work"). We have, then for physical science, a challenging need for the
discovery of the energy mode involved. Some type of energy is inferable
and none is known to be acceptable, since wave mechanics are
inapplicable to the case.

5\. Likewise, the challenge may be given to physiology that a new mode
of energy reception is required—reception of an unknown energy form by
an unknown mode of reception. It involves the nervous system quite as
much as does any other cognitive process, as judged by drug effects and
other physiological evidence.

6\. In psychology E.S.P. is a possible spurious factor in the
experimental laboratory, a possibly helpful one in hypnosis and in
therapy, a requisition for the expansion of our concepts of the place of
mind in nature and a lead to understanding the energetic principles of
general mental life. It may, too, be an innate ability, since certainly
there is no evidence of its being acquired; *i.e.*, no evidence of real
development.

7\. There seems to be in this work thus far a "species level" of E.S.P.
ability reached by most subjects and not much exceeded, on the average,
over large numbers of trials. The evolutionary origin and the biological
survival value of E.S.P. are problems at which we have only hinted
possible answers.

8\. One is tempted to point, as a final suggestion, to the analogies of
E.S.P. found in religions and mystic lore, and to refer to the apparent
applicability of the principles of E.S.P. to some religious
"experiences" and claims. Might we not find good E.S.P. subjects in the
medicine-man, the mystic and the prophet?
