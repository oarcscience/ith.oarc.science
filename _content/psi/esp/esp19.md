### CHAPTER 12

#### <span class="smallcaps">The Psychological Conditions and Bearings of the Results</span>

In the more restricted psychological field there has arisen as yet no
special hypothesis for the explanation of the E.S.P. type of phenomena,
excepting those already dealt with under other headings: hyperaesthesia
of the known senses, with involuntary whispering (for telepathy) and
unconscious reliance upon faint visual indications in the card-calling
clairvoyance, were discussed in Chapter 9 and were shown to be excluded
by the conditions; and the cryptesthesia or "sixth sense" hypothesis was
considered in the last chapter, and was shown to be opposed by a number
of damaging facts and to be supported by none. These hypotheses are all
psychological in part; but the first are primarily methodological and
the last physiological in bearing. I find no other definitely
psychological suggestion as to the nature of E.S.P. presented in the
literature. However, in the course of this chapter there will be
developed some more purely psychological suggestions, taking the form of
a partially explanatory hypothesis. But the main content of the chapter
will consist of the general mental conditions associated with E.S.P. and
their interpretation. Upon such facts must depend whatever advance in
the understanding of E.S.P. will ultimately be made.

The most important mental condition associated with success in E.S.P. is
one that the popular mind has long recognized in such connections,
though it needs some technical refinement for the purpose here in

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

mind; I refer to "concentration". It is not a technical term in
psychology, to my knowledge, but it refers to a mental condition that
most people fairly well understand and agree upon. Obviously,
concentration of attention is implied, and, if one is trying to perceive
by a non-sensory mode, concentration of attention would mean withdrawing
attention from the sensory fields and directing it into another route.
Hence we should have relaxation of all sensory functions and abstraction
from all sense-stimuli. This would necessarily accompany the
concentration of attention upon a special extra-sensory function.

Attention directed into extra-sensory routes would not be so readily
observable as sensorially guided attention. The straining of the eye,
the listening attitude and the like would be wanting; but we must not be
deceived by this appearance of passivity. We find it unmistakably
present, as logically it should be for any cognitive process. The
evidence of abstraction is itself confirmatory of attention, since
abstraction from sensory-stimuli is an evidence of at least some form of
non-sensory attention. Let us, then, consider first the facts of
abstraction in E.S.P.

Several subjects have described their E.S.P. experience as involving a
state of "detachment", "abstraction", "relaxation" and the like. And it
is rather apparent to the objective observer in many of them. Miss
Bailey practically goes into light trance with eyes closed. Pearce seems
to me to approximate light trance after he works steadily for some time.
In fact, his eyes almost close and the pupils turn somewhat upward.
Cooper, Zirkle and Miss Turner close their eyes when they do not have to
keep them open. This was not required of them. Both Linzmayer and Pearce
like to look off with a "far away look" much of the time. The former
especially was given to staring out of the window. He preferred this to
closing his eyes, saying that the images were uncontrolled with the eyes
closed. The fact that Miss Ownbey perceives the figures on the backs of
the cards and on the wall, by hallucination, suggests that she, too, has
achieved relatively good abstraction from sensory disturbances. (She,
like Miss Bailey, has the ability to go readily into trance by her own
volition.) <span id="fr_88"></span>[1](#fn_88)

In addition to the positive evidence of abstraction from the
surroundings in doing good E.S.P. work, there are on the negative side
the still more convincing facts of distraction and its damaging
influence upon this mode of perception. These will need only to be
mentioned here, since the details have been given before. There is, for
example, the temporary,

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

but decided distraction-effect of visitors upon the percipient, observed
in the case of Pearce (See [Table XIX](esp14.htm#an_tab19), Chapter 7);
Miss Ownbey, Linzmayer and Miss Weckesser show somewhat the same effect.
(Tischner's Mr. H. and Prof. G. Murray were affected similarly.)
Likewise, any change in procedure is likely to disturb Pearce's scoring
rate. Others, too, are somewhat affected but in most instances these
disturbances are only temporary, lasting merely until adaptation is
adequate to permit good abstraction. We have had also various minor
instances of other types of distraction, as, for instance, the
appearance on the scene of a girl with whom the percipient was
emotionally involved in an unsettled way and degree; and, in another
case, a disturbing telephone call came for the percipient and so
agitated him that he said he was sure he would fail to score. He got
only 3 in 25 immediately, but the score rose, as he recovered his poise,
to his usual level of approximately 8 in 25. This detrimental effect of
distracting factors only emphasizes the more strongly the importance of
abstraction in E.S.P., and of the advanced degree of abstraction
required. <span id="fr_89"></span>[1](#fn_89) We get the impression that
E.S.P. is a most delicate function, most easily disturbed and inhibited
by the more common and more stable processes. (One is reminded of Prof.
Gilbert Murray's comment on his own E.S.P. experiments with himself as
percipient, "The least disturbance of our customary method, change of
time or place, presence of strangers, controversy or especially noise is
apt to make things go wrong.")

When we turn from the abstraction phase of the "concentration" process
to attention itself, we find really the continuation of the abstraction
picture itself: the necessity of abstraction from other activation.
First, again, is the subjective testimony of the percipients themselves.
They agree pretty well that a state of alertness and freshness is best
for good E.S.P. work. And this is certainly my own conclusion from three
years of observation; it is, also, well supported by the results
obtained from the drug caffeine. This drug is recognized as
counteracting the effect of fatigue or drowsiness, and making the
individual more alert. We have found that it raises the scoring level of
the percipient if he has been running below his usual level. Alertness
of attention would seem to have been improved here, necessarily, and it
is likely the connection is causal. (Osty <span
id="fr_90"></span>[2](#fn_90) thinks the use of the "object of fixation"
in " psychometric" E.S.P. aids in attention. It is regarded by many as a
focus for concentration.) In watching the subjects work and in getting
their subjective observations from day to day, I have opportunity to
form "clinical

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

impressions" that are possibly of some value in interpretation. One such
impression is that attention is closely correlated with success and that
it varies widely without the subject's realizing it himself, very often
since it is not an overtly registered attention that is concerned. The
subject may think he is giving himself fully to the task but, if some
stimulating (but not distracting) factor comes into the situation, the
score may rise at once. On the day of Pearce's scoring 25 straight
successes, he did not want to work but consented to run a few. He began
rather indifferently and got no hits in the first 5. I urged him to try
harder and he got 3 in the next 5. Then I challenged him vigorously,
albeit good-humoredly, urging him more strongly than I have ever done
before or since, and he got 25 consecutive hits. The very strain he
showed at the end was evidence of strong effort to concentrate
attention. He said, "You'll never get me to do that again!" He could not
describe his feeling further, however. (And, to avoid developing
self-consciousness, I do not push introspective exploration.)

On the negative side, the role of attention, and effort which is
expressed as attention, is likewise well supported. Sleepiness and
fatigue, the states opposite to good attention, are demonstrably poor
conditions for E.S.P. Worst of all is the artificial sleepiness induced
by the dissociative drug sodium amytal. With the subjects under the
influence of this drug, there was noticeable difficulty in the capacity
to give attention, as evidenced in the appearance of struggle with the
task. Pearce got up and washed his face in cold water, he struggled with
himself, trying to fight off sleepiness and maintain better attention.
Zirkle succeeded in doing this to a great degree when we gave him
caffeine and then raised his score level at once from 6.2 to 9.5, making
another strong case for the role of attention. This does not exhaust the
evidence for the causal function of attention but there is no need to
elaborate further. Attention, as the expression of effort, which is in
turn guided by interest, is, I think, essential in E.S.P., as in any
other mode of cognition. It is probably required even to a greater
degree, judging by the apparent delicateness and instability of the
functioning E.S.P.

The connection of interest with E.S.P. is clear, then, also, for those
who recognize attention as a function of interest. We can see, then,
logical ground for the general belief that strong personal attachment
seems to enhance parapsychical relations between two individuals. It is
noteworthy in this connection that the best P.T. work we have,—best by a
good margin—was done by Zirkle with Miss Ownbey, his fiancee, as agent.
Their deep personal attachment and mutual understanding would most
probably facilitate parapsychic *rapport*. Personal interest strengthens
the effort to establish contact and this means stronger attention. If
attention

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

is not divided by self-consciousness or self-doubt, and does not
partially escape over the sensory routes, then the additional personal
interest is drawn into supporting the attention given through E.S.P. If
there is this strong effect of motivation upon the attention link and
this is so very influential, in turn, with the scoring level, it is very
easy to see how Linzmayer might have got his below-chance scoring when I
pushed him into working very much against his will, with a definite view
to testing whether he would go below significantly (see [Table
XI](esp12.htm#an_tab11), Chapter 5). Given his unconscious negativism,
he would have unconsciously opposed the work he was forced into and,
without realizing it, he probably responded negatively—actually
purposely calling the cards wrongly. Voluntarily and consciously, Pearce
and Stuart have called consistently below chance, showing that E.S.P.
can be directed by volitional preference in just the way suggested to
explain Linzmayer's lowered score test. Guidance and strengthening of
attention through changes in interest are the points here involved.

If this picture is correct as drawn, then, if interest should decline,
as it might well do in any such task, proper attention and abstraction
could not be attained, and the scores would drop to chance. Now, after
Stuart spent a year of monotonous work at B.T., alone, without the
stimulation even of an observer's presence, and without any special
recognition or encouragement (I regret now to have to confess), he
reported to me that his scoring had fallen off badly! I asked him (the
"leading" question) whether he had not gotten a bit tired of it. He
confessed that perhaps he had. When I discovered later the amount of
work he had done I felt pretty certain he must have grown weary and less
interested in the work. And his scoring rate had declined from the first
500 trials on. In these 500, he had averaged 9 in 25, but for the first
1,500 of the total of 7,500, he dropped to 7.1 in 25. The average per 25
for the 5 serial groups of 1,500 trials each are as follows: 7.1, 6.1,
5.7, 5.9, 5.4. The curve of decline is shown in [graph No.
7](esp21.htm#img_gr07), A in Chapter 14. I am fairly well convinced that
it is a curve of "decline of interest," especially by the facts of the
sequel. After a few months of "rest" for him, and after I had discovered
the excellence of his results, and given him proper recognition for his
huge undertaking and accomplishment, I urged him to try again. Certainly
he must have been more interested at this point. At any rate, the
scoring came back up to 7.3 for the first 400 trials, and then declined
again during 2,000 trials and declined by 400's as follows: 7.3, 7.3,
7.2, 6.9, 6.0. After discussing this work with him I became more certain
of the decline-of-interest explanation. This work was done by Stuart at
his home and was reported by correspondence. The latter part of it was
carried on under somewhat depressing and discouraging circumstances,
likely to contribute to a decline of interest.

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

Related to the curves described above as probably decline-of-interest
curves and giving some support to the view, are the "curves of
operation", better described perhaps as attention-curves. Just as we
should expect interest, and consequently attention, to decline under
some circumstances, so may we also expect greater attention to be given
to some calls in the runs of 5 or 25 than to others. With most subjects
the first call might be expected to be emphasized by greater effort and
perhaps next in rank would come the last call of the run. It would be
less likely if the middle call or another in the interior would be
especially emphasized. What do we find actually (among such of the data
as have been combed over for such internal relationships)? Linzmayer
gets the first card correct more often than any other, except when
forced into low-scoring, when he got it incorrect more than any other.
Pearce, Cooper, Stuart and Linzmayer, in their D.T. work, and Pearce in
his B.T.-25 (*i.e.*, run in 25's) all favor the two ends of the run and
slight the center. (See Chapter 10 with graphs Nos.
[1](esp17.htm#img_gr01) and [2](esp17.htm#img_gr02).) Miss Ownbey in her
D.T. does just the opposite, scoring highest in the center of the pack,
and lower toward the top and the bottom. Most striking of the operation
curves, however, is Pearce's B.T.-5 curve. These are run and checked by
5's, and they show a rate-of-scoring curve over the whole 25 of the pack
that consists of 5 similar units, one for each 5-card-run. That is,
there is shown a typical rate of scoring for 5-card-runs that is
strikingly regular for the whole 25. Invariably the 2nd call is the
highest and the order of the others is quite regular also. See Graphs
Nos. [3](#img_gr03) and [4](#img_gr03) that follow. In [Graph No.
3](#img_gr03), the number of successes divided by the chance expectation
is plotted against the order of the call in the runs through the pack of
25. The curve is broken after each 5 calls to remind the reader that the
calls were made in these short runs of 5 each. Each run of 5 is thus a
check on the others. In the case of [Graph 4](#img_gr04), these 5 runs
of 5 each in the pack are summated, keeping the serial order intact, as
if all had been merely 5-card-runs. First calls are totalled, 2nd calls,
3rd, etc. The curve of these total hits divided by chance expectation
(np) is plotted likewise against the order of the call in the run. This
gives the complete summarizing curve for the 2,250 trials.

The unquestionable order shown by these curves reveals a factor that has
become habitual for Pearce, varying regularly from call to call, giving
the same general pattern with each cross-section group of 5 calls. What
factor varies thus regularly, habitually? We would not expect ability to
vary; cognitive and perceptual abilities are not known to vary thus. We
look rather to the conative side, to variation in effort, again in the
form of attention, since this is a factor we would naturally expect to
find varying. Why attention should vary in just this pattern cannot be
said. Some rhythm of the mind, some odd habit, perhaps originating in

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

counting habits, or some earlier experience with the number 5 may be
responsible. More force of conation is put into call No. 2 than in the
others. And, as Dr. McDougall would say, more striving in perception
would mean increased attention. These are, then, curves of
attention-pattern peculiar to this percipient for these conditions.

Under other conditions the attention pattern changes. For instance, with
D.T. there is the U-curve given by the run of 25 as a whole but with

no rhythmic order by 5's such as is shown in [Graph No. 3](#img_gr03).
Here the "attention" decreases from the first call to the middle of the
run and increases from there to the end. On the last calls of 40 of
Pearce's D.T. runs studied, he got 33 of the 40 correct. He likewise
increases effort in concentration toward both ends of the run in his
B.T.-25. Of 60 runs studied under this heading, he got 52 of the last
calls correct. In fact, through the whole series he drops in the
interior of the run but rises at both ends, much more in the last 5, as
was the case in his D.T. Some of these totals may be of interest in
addition to the curves and will be given in [Table

five columns of results and they together will show in steps of 5 calls
the success of the subject in general over the run of 25 trials for the
pack. We can compare Pearce on B.T.-25, B.T.-5 and D.T. Note that on
B.T.-5

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

he runs rather evenly by 5's, though within each 5, as Graph No. 3 has
shown, there are wide variations on a regular pattern. But on B.T.-25,
while there is not such rhythm by 5's, the results would give a general
U-shaped curve, a bit W-shaped. But in D.T. his curve is markedly
U-shaped. Only the D.T. data have been assembled in this form for the
other subjects, due to time limitations and to the greater pressure of
other lines of the inquiry. Miss Ownbey's D.T. data are set off by
themselves because of their unique distribution and the large number of
trials.

Important as these curves (*i.e.* the data yielding them) are for their
evidence of order and lawfulness in these phenomena, it is difficult at
this stage to explain them all. Why, for instance, does Miss Ownbey get
better results in the center of the pack in D.T. work than she does with
the cards nearer the top and bottom? It is conceivable, perhaps, that
she may try harder, gives closer attention, as a consequence of
*expecting* it to be harder to score in the center, and that actually
there is no difference in ease of perception—top, center, or bottom. But
she herself does not realize any difference or think anything about it.
Naturally, since we think she can achieve better abstraction without a
close introspective analysis, we let it go at that for the time. The
problem is a real one, however, and is still entirely unsolved, except
that her results have eliminated any possible hypothesis, physical or
psychological, that assumes greater difficulty in the center than in the
other regions of the pack. The explanation of such features may well
take us back into complex personality factors not yet understood.

Among the other curves that I cannot explain, yet which show the working
of some principle of order, are two operation curves of decline. The
curves represent a decline in scoring rate during the run. The effect

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

is probably due in part to the length of run, which Prof. Richet said
many years ago would lower scoring in "cryptesthesia". These two groups
of data, too, are the only long-run data we have. We commonly stop at 25
trials per run, sometimes after each 5 and occasionally check after each
one. But in one of these series the runs were of 100 trials each, and in
the other of 50, in the latter case with a check-up only after 300
trials. It was certainly among the most monotonous and tedious work we
have yet inflicted on our subjects. Both curves are obtained by plotting
number of successes divided by chance expectation against cross-sections
of the number of trials. The first work, by Frick, described in Chapter
4, consists of 900 trials, run 100 per day at a single sitting. The
scores are totalled for the ordinal 20's, making 5 subdivisions of the
total, each representing the 20's in the run of 100. [Graph No.
5](#img_gr05), A shows that Frick's scoring fell off by steps of 20's
and actually went below chance expectation on the last two 20's. The
total gain above chance was very slight but the extremes of the curve
are significantly far apart, as they are also in Linzmayer's curve, to
follow in [Graph No. 5](#img_gr05), B. Linzmayer's data are taken from
B.T. work on 50 sealed envelopes which were called under conditions
described in Chapter 5. The 300 calls made in 6 runs over these
envelopes yielded no positive deviation, and yet the curve is internally
significant in its striking decline by 10's to a point below chance,
suggesting, as with Frick and as with Linzmayer himself in his low-score
test described in Chapter 5, that there may be an internal factor
conflicting with the effort to score. It is a curious fact that these
two men, Frick and Linzmayer, are the only two subjects who have ever
scored below chance to any noticeable extent and they have both done so
rather significantly, Linzmayer more definitely so than Frick. Now, both
these men have, in my judgment, rather definite negativistic tendencies
of which they are unconscious (although in neither is there to my
knowledge any slightest socially evident defect as a result). With
Linzmayer this has been demonstrated in hypnotic experiments; with Frick
it is a judgment based on acquaintance covering 4 or 5 years. He is
non-hypnotizable, too, which fact is in agreement. I venture the
suggestion, then, that there is a connection here between a negativistic
tendency, operative especially with relaxation, which, after the strain
of long, tedious runs, sets up a rebellion that leads to purposively
thwarting the scoring impulse, producing an effect of negative
hallucination in E.S.P. This is the view I have in mind as a possible
explanation of Linzmayer's drop below chance to 4.5 in 25 for 600 trials
in June, 1931, immediately following 600 trials at more than twice that
rate, 9.9. It is an hypothesis that can later be tested. There is
already one logical test that gives it a favorable decision: if this
unconscious negativism hypothesis is correct, we might expect, then,

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

that the longer the subject is urged thereafter to work, the more
conflict would develop—the more internal opposition there would be and
the more

decline. Both Frick and Linzmayer went on declining thereafter in their

We have mentioned the "fatigue curve" theory of Miss Jephson <span
id="fr_92"></span>[1](#fn_92) from time to time as evidence arose
touching on the problem. Our long

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

series of 900, 950 and 1,300 trials (700 for high, 600 for low) in one
day render the fatigue view inapplicable, especially since it was
proposed on the basis of data of only 5 calls each. If three of our
subjects get through 900 or more trials in one day without fatigue, it
is not likely that 5 calls would induce it. Rather is it likely that
Miss Jephson's interesting results represent an operation curve
revealing a decline of the requisite "concentration" condition; either
the strain is cumulative, rational factors come in, self-conscious
attention develops and disturbs, or the like. The first call is usually
made more naïvely; but 2 or 3 calls make it harder to keep the intellect
at rest, since one is given commonly to reasoning in such matters. The
imagination, too, may become too active. Or the curve may simply be a
curve of decline with rising excitement over the experiment's possible
outcome. Any of these several possibilities, but certainly not fatigue.

We have had decline-curves of several kinds, in the run, in the series,
for a season, and for years—but no ascending-curves. We have been
interested in learning and development curves too, but E.S.P. does not
appear to be a developmental matter, as our data reveal it. It is true
there are obstacles and inhibitions that have to be removed, such as
initial doubts, self-consciousness, strangeness, distracting
environmental conditions. But these might well inhibit the composition
of poetry, too, and we would not say that their removal would be
primarily learning to write poetry. There is in E.S.P. this secondary
learning, obvious in our work, but no adequate evidence of primary
improvement of the ability itself. Rather does it seem that we have here
a basic function that can easily be inhibited but not developed. It is
probably as innately given as is sensory perceptual capacity. This is,
however, a point for further inquiry!

The general psychological setting of E.S.P. is still very vague. The
experiments into this phase have scarcely begun as yet and the
subjective exploration has not been pushed; first, because it is
difficult to evaluate and, second, we must not, I think, start subjects
to thinking too much about how they do it, lest we unfit them for
successfully doing it by inducing self-consciousness, over-curiosity or
some other undesirable attitude. This has not been regarded as a
first-step, anyhow. With this as a preface, I will draw up a brief
summary of the mental outlines of E.S.P.

First, no one—not even a psychologist—can reasonably doubt that E.S.P.
*is* a mental process; and that there seems to be good ground for
regarding it as a natural part of the endowment of mind. It is a more
delicate mental process than most, suffering easily from dissociation or
distraction, and returning again with re-integration of effort and
improved attention. It is inhibited too by conflict, as in self-doubt
(Linzmayer), doubt as to the possibility or wisdom of a procedure
(Cooper and Pearce) or in conflict of desires (Linzmayer). It requires
with most subjects rather

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

good abstraction and close attention to the task in hand. It is less
resistant to dissociation than sensory perception or even than simple
reasoning. On the points so far mentioned, it is more like creative
intellectual or artistic synthesis; yet it is not so fatiguing as these;
and, unlike these, can be speeded up rapidly (faster than I can record);
and it is not learned or developed, as far as we know yet, as are these;
it is unanalyzable introspectively, as are these mostly. But it
substitutes for other forms of cognition, for visual or auditory
perception, rational judgment or recall. It inter-operates with them,
combines in any way and works from a wide range of motivation, for money
or for kindness, for play or for display, for science or for courtesy.
It is like the sensory functions rather than rational cognition in its
lack of development (if this is actually a fact, as it seems). But it is
not like them in localization, feeling of real contact experienced, need
of orientation to function, resistance to distraction and dissociation.
It is simple cognition, so far as subjective analysis goes as yet; but
it uses memory, visual or other imagination—in fact, all of mind that is
needed—in its functioning. It is normal, not related to mental weakness
or disease. In fact, physical disease, of some kinds, hinders it, and
weakening, dissociating mental disease would probably do so likewise.
There is no suggestion of incorporeal agencies in connection with
experiments. As to personality traits and E.S.P., there are some
suggestions or general impressions, as yet undeveloped; for example,
possible correlations between E.S.P. and a tendency to day-dreaming and
high imaginativeness. Stuart suggested a correlation between E.S.P. and
artistic interest and ability that seems promising. Hypnotizability,
too, is about on a par with these, in correlation with E.S.P.
Sociability has a chance, too, of being correlated. But our data are yet
too limited on this line of comparison. Relations of E.S.P. to age,
race, and other stages and conditions, too, are yet for the future.
This, then, is the tentative [psychological](errata.htm#8) sketch we
have so far achieved.

There is much indeed to be said about the bearing such facts as these of
E.S.P. may have on psychological theory. It is most obvious that some
very fundamental revolution is required in this field by this evidence
for E.S.P., quite as it is in Physics. Since there is no end to what
might be developed here, in a speculative way, the space must be limited
to only a few hypotheses that seem to be more clearly suggested by the
facts.

One of these is the hypothesis of the relatively independent agency of
mind under certain conditions of the material world. This is an
hypothesis, not a claim or conclusion; and I, for one, do not regard the
facts given here as compelling. The facts that suggest this hypothesis
are: first, the fact that distance, that basic feature of the material
universe, seems to mean nothing to E.S.P. Nothing else we know operates
in our material

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

world and eludes the space limitations as does this principle. Space
clearly does not limit it; it does not, therefore, function in it and we
have, then, non-spatial processes of mind. Not that mind is absolutely
space-free nor necessarily predominantly so. Its processes are brought
into space relationship by the motor nerve phenomena of response, if not
several steps before. The point of importance for the hypothesis is that
the mental system may elude the space-giving properties of the material
medium, escape from "inverse square" laws by an energy (or causal
principle) we do not yet know, and mentally telescope the material
universe into an extensionless immediacy, as naturally, perhaps, as a
slow-swimming bird may smoothly escape on the wing through a medium that
has (for it) less limiting laws. (A similar problem with the time
dimension lies just ahead in our experimental future.)

A second fact that suggested this hypothesis is the relative
indifference to the percipient's success, on the whole, as to whether it
is a card or a thought-image that is to be perceived. (The data for this
conclusion will be summarized in the next chapter and not repeated
here.) The diversity of the "stimulus objects" here is so great as to
suggest that the agency responsible is the percipient's mind—that his
mind, in effect, "goes out to" the object. Such different objects could
not be expected to give such similar stimulation. It is much more
reasonable to suppose that the percipient's mind can perceive in E.S.P.
fashion a wide enough range of "objects" to include thoughts and cards.
It is this "going out" to perceive that points in our present picture of
mind-body limitations to a relative independence of the material laws,
as known. A "going out" to great distances in defiance of "inverse
square" laws that all known matter-bound energies obey, as well as a
"going out" to a solid pack of cards and the selection of the right ones
in the right order; and, again, a "going-out" first to the right mind in
a heavily populated region 250 miles away and selecting its thoughts,
while evading doubtlessly similar thoughts originating nearer the
percipient (circle, star, plus, etc.), selecting from the chosen agent's
mind not the thoughts arising from her reading the book before her, but
the very images intended for the very moment when the call is made; and,
finally, a "going-out" of mind that selects one card on a table 250
yards away, when there are hundreds of similar cards in adjoining rooms
that are nearer the percipient, many others in his own room and in the
observer's room—such facts and conditions come close to persuasion of
the necessity for the active and selective agency of the percipient's
own mind, in escaping the limitations of its material nerves and sense
organs, penetrating stone walls and evading distance, and accurately
apprehending the desired "object" on a level or scale or condition that
is non-material and non-spatial.

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

The third fact suggesting this hypothesis of relative independence of
mind from material properties is rather a whole set of facts; namely,
those given in Chapter 8, showing that, in P.T. work with good E.S.P.
subjects for agents, better results were obtained than when poor ones
functioned, with the same percipients for both. This suggests, along
with the fact that even with poor E.S.P. subjects for agents a good
percipient could score in a mediocre way, that the "double agency" of
two good E.S.P. subjects means a capacity in both to "go out" to meet
each other beyond the material and sensory range. That is, the
demonstration of the greater advantage of having an agent who is gifted
with E.S.P. ability showed that there was a "going out" on her part, a
"meeting half way", or joint agency.

It would seem to me, therefore, that this
Capacity-to-Escape-Material-Conditions-Hypothesis might be regarded as
having at least a good beginning in plausibility, with no strong
competition; but, nevertheless, as resting on relative fragments of fact
and constituting only a "working direction" at present.

This general hypothesis embraces at least two more special ones, which,
I think, may be better stated independently. First, the agency <span
id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93) of the percipient's mind in "going out" to
the perceived object or image-source, instead of merely receiving
incoming energy patterns emanating from the card or the distant agent.
The facts suggesting this view have been given above. The second
hypothesis involved in the larger one is that of the relative or partial
freedom of mind from the limitations of material and its property,
space, as shown in the E.S.P. phenomena. Both these (the agency of the
percipient's mind in E.S.P. and the spatial freedom of mind) have been
involved as phases in the discussion above, and need here only be
mentioned as separable units that need to be criticized and tested, each
on its own merit. Together they harmoniously fit the facts in their
present incomplete state and give us the rational picture of the
purposive mind of the percipient operating between two energetic orders,
one related to the spatial world and another not directly related. There
is thus a perceptual interweaving between these realms of reality,
something like the clever play of the switch on a radio-victrola set can
interweave from two widely different energetic sources two musical
themes into one. So may (still hypothetically speaking) the E.S.P.
subject look at his watch (contact with the spatial world) and call the
card 250 yards away or get an image 250 miles away (thru a
hypothetically non-spatial world). I mention this speculation merely as
the play of the mind about and upon these interesting facts. It seems to
be the only rational line of treatment that fits the facts we have.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

In much less important, though more practical, ways these results bear
upon the techniques and theories of psychology. We have pretty good
ground in these results to suppose it possible that in hypnotic
suggestion there may well be an extra-sensory component of *rapport*
that satisfies, in some respects, the old "Mesmeric fluid" theory. It
would not, however, be correct to imply, even hypothetically, that some
extrasensory perception from hypnotic agent to subject is
required—merely that it is a possible factor that may hasten and aid
good trance and good response. As such it may play a minor but effective
role. It has already the support of Alrutz and Richet in the more modern
period of the history of hypnotism.

E.S.P. might well figure effectively, also, in the realm of
psychotherapy in general, as one may readily see. Though here, too, the
role may always be a minor one. Only in the establishment of splendid
*rapport* and in the development of delicate and difficult mental
attitudes, where every aid is needed and every shade of thought needs to
be caught, where mere words are often felt to be inadequate, can we see
a responsible part left for extrasensory perception in the
psycho-therapeutic field. What the actual facts are we, of course, do
not yet know. <span id="fr_94"></span>[1](#fn_94)

Again, we have the problem of E.S.P. as a possible spurious factor in
the experimental laboratory. If we can get such good responses to mere
thought-stimuli as 26 straight hits between Miss Ownbey and Zirkle, or
23 and 22 with two walls between them, what degree of safety is there in
most of the conclusions of much of the experimental evidence obtained in
situations where the observer, screened as he may be, is thinking of how
he would like the subject to respond? And, in view of the work of
Bechterew on dogs and of Rhine on the horse already referred to, what
shall we say even about animal studies?

Again we are asking questions in an hypothetical spirit. We cannot
answer them at present but the burden lies considerably on those who are
offering results exposed to the criticism of these merely hypothetical
questions. I am not, myself, disposed to question on this ground any
great amount of psychological experiment but it is, nevertheless, a
matter that we can ill afford to neglect.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_88"></span>[132:1](esp19.htm#fr_88) In *Mental Radio*,
already referred to, Mrs. Sinclair, the percipient, describes very fully
her introspections and her views as to the way "telepathy" occurs. She
emphasizes relaxation of body and "blankness" of mind as requirements;
these constitute the negative or abstraction phase of the
"concentration" required. Later she mentions the need for "training in
the art of concentration" and thus adds the positive effort phase. She,
like Osty, Tischner, Myers, etc., attributes the positive activity of
this mode of perception to the subconscious level of mind. Mrs. Sinclair
has also many excellent practical suggestions for the prospective E.S.P.
subject.

<span id="fn_89"></span>[133:1](esp19.htm#fr_89) I would predict that
with most E.S.P. subjects initial failure would be highly probable if
they were to be taken before a committee; failure would be practically
certain if the committee were made up of impressive people, or if its
members did anything to excite or distract the subject. To impose even
little precautions at the start is hazardous. Placing a small screen
over the cards that Pearce did not look at often anyway stopped his
E.S.P. for a time—until adjustment took place.
