The officers of a Commandery should wear black clothing, and during the
conferring of the Orders should be fully equipped as Knights Templar.
The Prelate should wear the regulation Robes during the entire
ceremonials.

The members of a Commandery should wear black clothing. Light clothing
is not in harmony with the Order of the Temple, nor is it becoming under
the regulation uniform.

The Guards must be fully equipped as Knights Templar, and never appear
on duty in fatigue uniform.

When the Guards put on dark robes over their Templar equipments, and
replace their chapeaux with soft hats, they become Hermits. The Hermits,
thus robed, should represent aged men.

When the Pilgrimage ends the Hermits doff their robes, and they are in
full Templar equipments as soon as they put on their chapeaux.
