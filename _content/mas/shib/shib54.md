### ASYLUM, AND PRELATE'S HALL.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> plate illustrates how a Commandery
that has only one large apartment can utilize the same for the Asylum
and Prelate's Hall, during the conferring of the Order of the Temple.

</span>

The same arrangement is available in the Red Cross. The Asylum becomes
the Audience Chamber, and the Prelate's Hall becomes the Council
Chamber. Of course the Standard Bearer removes his chair to allow the
entrance of the Candidate.

As a rule this arrangement is to be preferred except in Temples where
there is a large Prelate's Hall separate from the Asylum.
