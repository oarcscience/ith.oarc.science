<p>The following simple rules will be about all that Commanders will find necessary in conducting the business of the Conclaves:</p>  
<p>1. On the demand of a member, a motion must be reduced to writing.</p>  
<p>2. A motion, when stated by the Commander, can not be withdrawn without the consent of the Commandery.</p>  
<p>3. A motion to postpone to an indefinite time is debatable; a motion to postpone to a time definite is not debatable.</p>  
<p>4. No amendment beyond an amendment to an amendment can be entertained.</p>  
<p>5. A question will be divided on request of a member.</p>  
<p>6. A proposition to be referred to a committee <i>with instructions</i> is debatable; if <i>without instructions</i>, it is not debatable.</p>  
<p>7. A Frater voting in the majority may move to reconsider; such a motion is not debatable.</p>  
<p>8. When a proposition is reconsidered it is before the Commandery in the exact form it was in at the moment it was voted upon.</p>  
<p>9. Before a member is required to vote upon a paper he may require its reading.</p>  
<p>10. When the report of a Committee is read, or received, it is the property of the Commandery, and the Committee is discharged without a vote. It may be revived.</p>  
<p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></A></p>  
<p>11. When the Commander desires the debate to cease he arises, and proceeds to take the necessary steps.</p>  
<p>12. A proposition subject to debate is open to debate until the <i>negative</i> is put, unless the Commander decides the debate should cease.</p>  
<p>The following motions are not allowable in a Conclave of Knights Templar:</p>
