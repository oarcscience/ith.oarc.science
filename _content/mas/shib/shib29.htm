<p align="center">_______________________</p>  <h4 align="center">DRESS OF THE ANCIENT TEMPLARS.</h4>  
<p>The ancient Templars habitually wore a long, white Tunic, or Cassock, cut like that of the priests, with a red Cross before and behind. The Girdle was worn over the Shirt and under the Tunic. The serving brethren wore dark Kirtles to distinguish them from the Knights, all being clad in white. The white Mantle, with its red Cross on the left breast, and a Hood, was worn over all. The material was always light, because of the great heat of Palestine.</p>  
<p>In 1162 the Pope permitted the Templars to receive into their houses spiritual persons, not bound by any previous vow. After one year's novitiate these were initiated, as were the lay Knights. The habit of the Chaplain was a white Tunic and red Cross: but none under a Bishop could wear a white Mantle. The Chaplain wore the baret, or Cap.</p>  
<p>There is a dispute as to the form of the Red Cross of the Order. We favor the form given elsewhere, on the <i>Vexillum Belli</i>, as the one used by the ancient Templars, though some say the Cross on the left breast of the white Mantle was of "four arms, the under one being the longest."</p>  
<p>The arms of a Knight Templar were a Sword, Lance, Mace and Shield, and his head was covered by the Hood attached to his Mantle. He was allowed three horses and an esquire, who was a serving brother; or a hireling, who was a layman.</p>
