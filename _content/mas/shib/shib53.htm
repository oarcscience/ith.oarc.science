<p><i>Members</i>&#151;Sirs A. B., D. E., etc.</p>  
<p><i>Visitors</i>&#151;Sir X. Y., Mary Commandery, No. 4, Philadelphia, etc.</p>  
<p>It was announced that the Right Eminent Grand Commander had arrived, and desired to visit the Commandery officially. Whereupon, the Arch of Steel was formed, and the distinguished visitor was received with the honors befitting his rank.</p>  
<p>
</p>

<p>After a few pleasant remarks by the Right Eminent Grand Commander, the Lines were dismissed, and the business of the Commandery continued.</p>  
<p>Minutes of the preceding Conclave were read, and approved as correct.</p>  
<p>Petition from Companion &#151;, member of &#151; Lodge, No. &#151;, and of, Hamilton Chapter, No. &#151;, for the Orders of Knighthood, was read, and referred to the following</p>  
<p><i>Committee</i>&#151;Sirs A. B. C., X. Y. Z., and G. W. P.</p>  
<p>The following bills, approved by the Finance Committee, were read and ordered paid, viz.: [insert bills.]</p>  
<p>The committee on the petition of Companion &#151; reported, whereupon the ballot was spread, and he was declared duly elected to receive the Orders of Knighthood.</p>  
<p>The committee on the petition of Sir &#151;, for affiliation, reported, whereupon the ballot was spread, and he was declared rejected.</p>  
<p>Sir Knight &#151; offered the following, which was adopted:</p>  
<p><small><i>Resolved</i>, That, etc. [insert resolution.]</small></p>  
<p>The business of the Commandery was then suspended, and a</p>  
<p align="center"><small>COUNCIL OF THE RED CROSS</small></p>  
<p>was opened, the officers assuming the titles thereof.</p>  
<p>Companions A. B. C., G. F. S. and H. Y. T., who had been duly elected, were in waiting, and, there being no objection, were introduced and created and constituted Companions of the Illustrious Order of the Red Cross.</p>  
<p>The Council was then closed, and the business of the Commandery was resumed.</p>  
<p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></A></p>  
<p>Sir Knight &#151; petitioned for a demit, and he being clear of the books, the same was granted.</p>  
<p>The Commandery was then closed in due form.</p>  
<p>After closing the Commandery, the Right Eminent Grand Commander was escorted by the Fratres, without uniform, to the banquet hall.</p>  
<p><small>[Make the record of this as full as may be desired.]</small></p>  
<p align="right"><br> &#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;<br> <i>Commander</i>.</p>  
<p>&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;&#151;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Recorder</i>.</p>  
<p align="center">__________</p>  
<p><small>When the Minutes are approved they should be signed at once by the Commander and Recorder.</p>  
<p>The Minutes should not record the nature of the report of a Committee on Petitions. The above form is the correct one.</p>  
<p>The Records should he carefully paragraphed, written in a clear style of writing, as well as composition. Many Recorders crowd the records, thus making them indistinct.</p>  
<p>Use a Record Book that has a ruled margin, and give marginal notes.</p>  
<p>Prompt Recorders always have the "Rough Minutes" ready at the close of each Conclave. They can then be corrected by those who participated. The minutes are read to the next Conclave as information.</p>  
<p>Reports of Treasurer and Recorder are spread on the Minutes as <i>information</i>, and should not be voted upon, and never inserted as "adopted."</small></p>
