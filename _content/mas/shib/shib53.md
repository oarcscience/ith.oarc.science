*Members*—Sirs A. B., D. E., etc.

*Visitors*—Sir X. Y., Mary Commandery, No. 4, Philadelphia, etc.

It was announced that the Right Eminent Grand Commander had arrived, and
desired to visit the Commandery officially. Whereupon, the Arch of Steel
was formed, and the distinguished visitor was received with the honors
befitting his rank.

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

After a few pleasant remarks by the Right Eminent Grand Commander, the
Lines were dismissed, and the business of the Commandery continued.

Minutes of the preceding Conclave were read, and approved as correct.

Petition from Companion —, member of — Lodge, No. —, and of, Hamilton
Chapter, No. —, for the Orders of Knighthood, was read, and referred to
the following

*Committee*—Sirs A. B. C., X. Y. Z., and G. W. P.

The following bills, approved by the Finance Committee, were read and
ordered paid, viz.: \[insert bills.\]

The committee on the petition of Companion — reported, whereupon the
ballot was spread, and he was declared duly elected to receive the
Orders of Knighthood.

The committee on the petition of Sir —, for affiliation, reported,
whereupon the ballot was spread, and he was declared rejected.

Sir Knight — offered the following, which was adopted:

<span class="small">*Resolved*, That, etc. \[insert resolution.\]</span>

The business of the Commandery was then suspended, and a

<span class="small">COUNCIL OF THE RED CROSS</span>

was opened, the officers assuming the titles thereof.

Companions A. B. C., G. F. S. and H. Y. T., who had been duly elected,
were in waiting, and, there being no objection, were introduced and
created and constituted Companions of the Illustrious Order of the Red
Cross.

The Council was then closed, and the business of the Commandery was
resumed.

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

Sir Knight — petitioned for a demit, and he being clear of the books,
the same was granted.

The Commandery was then closed in due form.

After closing the Commandery, the Right Eminent Grand Commander was
escorted by the Fratres, without uniform, to the banquet hall.

<span class="small">\[Make the record of this as full as may be
desired.\]</span>

  
—————————  
*Commander*.

——————————  
                      *Recorder*.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

When the Minutes are approved they should be signed at once by the
Commander and Recorder.

The Minutes should not record the nature of the report of a Committee on
Petitions. The above form is the correct one.

The Records should he carefully paragraphed, written in a clear style of
writing, as well as composition. Many Recorders crowd the records, thus
making them indistinct.

Use a Record Book that has a ruled margin, and give marginal notes.

Prompt Recorders always have the "Rough Minutes" ready at the close of
each Conclave. They can then be corrected by those who participated. The
minutes are read to the next Conclave as information.

Reports of Treasurer and Recorder are spread on the Minutes as
*information*, and should not be voted upon, and never inserted as
"adopted."

business, save that specially permitted by law, can be transacted.
