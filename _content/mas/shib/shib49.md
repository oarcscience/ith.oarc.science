### RULES OF ORDER.

The following simple rules will be about all that Commanders will find
necessary in conducting the business of the Conclaves:

1\. On the demand of a member, a motion must be reduced to writing.

2\. A motion, when stated by the Commander, can not be withdrawn without
the consent of the Commandery.

3\. A motion to postpone to an indefinite time is debatable; a motion to
postpone to a time definite is not debatable.

4\. No amendment beyond an amendment to an amendment can be entertained.

5\. A question will be divided on request of a member.

6\. A proposition to be referred to a committee *with instructions* is
debatable; if *without instructions*, it is not debatable.

7\. A Frater voting in the majority may move to reconsider; such a
motion is not debatable.

8\. When a proposition is reconsidered it is before the Commandery in
the exact form it was in at the moment it was voted upon.

9\. Before a member is required to vote upon a paper he may require its
reading.

10\. When the report of a Committee is read, or received, it is the
property of the Commandery, and the Committee is discharged without a
vote. It may be revived.

11\. When the Commander desires the debate to cease he arises, and
proceeds to take the necessary steps.

12\. A proposition subject to debate is open to debate until the
*negative* is put, unless the Commander decides the debate should cease.
