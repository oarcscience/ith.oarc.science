### HISTORY OF THE ORDER IN THE UNITED STATES.

"It would be a matter of pride and gratification," said Past Grand
Master Hopkins, in his report to Grand Encampment, in 1889, "if we could
trace the genealogy of our Templar organizations, by clear and
unquestionable steps, back to a legitimate and respected parentage. But
as that can not be done—as the very baptismal record of our Grand
Encampment has been found to be erroneous—and so many subordinate bodies
were formed without formality and without legality, we can only admit
the established facts, and trust that the power, the purity, and the
renown of our maturer years may soften the disappointment occasioned by
the knowledge of an unfortunate origin."

The Grand Encampment was formed on the 10th of June, 1816, by delegates
from the Grand Commanderies (then called Encampments) of Massachusetts,
Rhode Island and New York.
