### HINTS ON TEMPLAR BANQUETS.

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> social features of the assemblies of
the Knights of the Temple will not be neglected by prudent Commanders. A
reception and Banquet, which include the ladies, and given at least
annually, is one of the very best investments a Commandery can make.

The management of the Reception need not be commented upon, but as a
Templar Banquet is somewhat unique, hints may be of value to many
Commanders.

De *not* form a Passion Cross with the tables. That cross is a sacred
symbol in the Order of the Temple, and is not associated with the
hilarity usual to a Banquet. The following form is suggested. It is very
desirable that the banqueters sit as compactly as possible, and close up
to the Commander, so as to be easily governed at proper intervals.

This form allows the waiters easy access, and permits all to see the
Commander, or Toastmaster.

The placing of the speakers at various points at the table is helpful to
the listeners. It will be wise to seat the speakers in the places
selected before the doors are thrown open.

Not more than five distinct courses, nor more than five speakers,
beginning at nine and closing not later than midnight, will make the
entertainment agreeable to most.

A few crisp remarks by the Commander, in introducing each speaker, may
add to the brilliancy of the toast and the response. Do not he personal
unless you know your speaker.

Never permit smoking when ladies are present.
