# CONSTITUTING A LODGE

The ceremony of installing the officers and putting the Lodge at work
under a Charter for the first time, is the same as the preceding, except
the preliminary steps, which are as follows:

The Installing Officer, who by the Constitution of the Grand Lodge of
Texas, must be the Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, one of the Grand
Wardens, or one of the District Deputy Grand Masters, or some Past
Master duly authorized by proxy by one of them, convenes the new Lodge
at the Lodge room, at such time as may suit the convenience of himself
and the brethren, opens the Lodge in the Master's degree, and informs
the brethren present of the object of the meeting; that meeting, be it
on whatever day it may, is a stated meeting.

He then calls upon the brethren to know if they are satisfied with the
officers named in the Charter. If they answer in the affirmative, he
asks the brethren named in the Charter to consult together and appoint
the other officers. And when that is done he names a Marshal for the
occasion, and directs him to present the officers for installation, or
he may call to refreshment and then install. If, in response to the
inquiry about the satisfaction, as to the officers named in the Charter,
the brethren should say they are not satisfied, he at once orders an
election and then installs the officers elected according to the
ceremony of installation, heretofore given for a subordinate Lodge.
