# APPROVAL OF REVISION

Under date of December 5th, 1907, the Grand Lodge of Texas adopted the
following report of Bro. E. E. Douglass for the Committee on Work:

### REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON WORK

To the M. W. Grand Lodge of Texas:

We, your Committee on Work, to whom was referred that part of the
revision of Taylor's Monitor by R. W. Bro. Sam R. Hamilton, P. G. M.,
which refers to the ritual, beg leave to report that we have carefully
examined this work, so faithfully and judiciously performed, and find
that Bro. Hamilton has revised, corrected, rearranged and harmonized the
Monitor with our authorized ritual, and that although our former Monitor
has served a useful purpose so long, we recognize in this revision quite
an improvement, and that it will prove of great practical utility.

Having as actual workers in Masonry long felt the necessity of a
thorough re-vision of our Monitor, we feel that Bro. Hamilton (himself
for many years an active worker), has in this revision rendered the
Craft a great service, and one that merits and should receive at our
hands our most greatful approval.

Fully approving this revision ourselves, we recommend the following for
adoption:

1\. Resolved, That the revision of Taylor's

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Monitor by Past Grand Master Sam R. Hamilton be,
and the same is hereby approved and recommended for use as the latest
and most approved monitorial textbook, but not to the exclusion of our
former Monitor being used by those now provided with them.

2\. Resolved, That this revised Monitor. shall be known as the
Taylor-Hamilton Monitor of Symbolic Masonry.

Fraternally submitted,

This report was referred to a Special Committee composed of Bros. W. S.
Fly, Anson Rainey, Geo. W. Tyler, J. Y. Hogsett, Friench Simpson and W.
L. Burdette, which committee made the following report, which was
adopted:

"We, your Special Committee, to whom was referred the matter of the
Taylor-Hamilton Monitor for publication, would report that it is
inexpedient for the Grand Lodge to publish same at this time, and
recommend that Bro. Hamilton shall publish same, if he so desires, and
preserve the copy plate of same, and he is hereby

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

authorized to preserve the copyrights of the same."

During the 1918 Communication of the Grand Lodge a resolution was
introduced and adopted, as appears on page 200 of the printed
proceedings, calling attention to the fact that the price of the
Taylor-Hamilton Monitor, under the then system of management, had
increased from fifty cents to one dollar and fifty cents per copy, and
requesting the Committee on Printing to secure the lowest bid from the
then publishers. The Grand Secretary, in his 1919 report, stated that he
had been unable to secure a satisfactory bid from the publishers who
were custodians of the copyright, but had received a satisfactory bid
from a concern which proposed to electrotype the plates, the same to be
the property of the Grand Lodge. (See P. P. 1919, page 138.) This report
was referred to the Committee on Grand Officers' Reports, which rendered
a detailed report

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

and introduced the following resolution, which was adopted. (See P. P.
1919, Page 314.)

"Your Committee is most thoroughly of the opinion that this Grand Lodge
should at once relieve itself of all such co-partnerships and entangling
financial alliances. We are fully competent, and every legitimate
interest demands, that we should provide our own authorized Monitor, and
own outright the copyright and plates for same, as well as for our laws.
To meet any existing or possible emergency, we know of no reason why
this Grand Lodge may not have published our old Taylor Monitor, which
our subordinates are already authorized to adopt and use. This would
give us a much smaller volume, and one which we could furnish to the
Craft at not to exceed one-third the present cost of the Taylor-Hamilton
Monitor. We therefore offer the following, viz:

"Resolved, That the Grand Master appoint a committee of three with our
Grand Secretary as its Chairman, whose duty it shall be to make all
necessary investigation and secure all needed bids, etc., and to report
at our next Annual Communication definite recommendations looking to the
securing and printing of a Monitor for this Grand Lodge; said contract
whenever made to provide for the copyright and plates to be vested in
and retained by this Grand Lodge, and further,

"Resolved, That if in the judgment of the above named Committee, the
emergency

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

should demand, they are hereby authorized and instructed to have a
sufficient number of the Taylor Monitor published to meet the urgent
demand, provided, however, same may be furnished to the purchaser at a
price not to exceed 50c per copy, and further that any and all such
contracts for printing shall be first approved by the Grand Master.

The Grand Master then appointed the following committee: M. W. W. B.
Pearson, Grand Secretary, Chairman; K. Robey and J. F. Scott.

This committee rendered a full and complete report on revision of the
Monitor, By-Laws and Forms at the 1920 Annual Communication of the Grand
Lodge, which was referred to the Jurisprudence Committee, as appears on
page 171 of the printed proceedings.

The Jurisprudence Committee approved

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the report of the Revision Committee at the 1921 Annual Communication,
and the report was finally approved and adopted on December 7th, 1921.

The By-Laws and Forms have been eliminated from the Monitor and will be
found with the Constitution and Digest.
