and having, according to the best of my ability, accomplished the task
assigned me, I now return my thanks for the honor of this appointment,
and beg leave to surrender up the implements which were committed to my
care, when the foundation of this fabric was laid, hoping the exertions
thus made will be crowned with your approbation and that of this Most
Worshipful Grand Lodge.

The Grand Master replies:

Brother Architect: The skill and fidelity displayed in the execution of
the trust reposed in you, have secured the entire approbation of the
