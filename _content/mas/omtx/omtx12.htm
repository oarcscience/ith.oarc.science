<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The Grand Master says:</FONT></p>  
<p>"R. W. G. S.

<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The Grand Master then says:</FONT></p>  
<p>"R. W. G. Treasurer: I now order you to deposit the corn, medals and papers in the place prepared for their reception."</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The principal Architect then presents the working tools to the G. Master, who directs the G. Marshal to present them to the Deputy G. Master and Grand Senior and Junior Wardens.</p>  
<p>The G. M., D. G. M., and G. Wardens then descend from the platform; the G. M. with the Trowel, the D. G. Master with the Square, the G. S. Warden with the Level, and the G. J. Warden With the Plumb--the G. M. standing at the East of the stone, his Deputy on his right, the G. S. Warden at the West and the G. J. Warden at the South side of the stone. The Grand Master then spreads the cement, and when done, directs the G. Marshal to order the Craftsmen to lower the stone by three motions.</p>  
<p>The Public Grand Honors are then given. The Square, Level and Plumb are then applied to the stone by the proper officers.</FONT></p>  
<p>G. M.--R. W. D. G. Master: What is the proper Jewel of your office?</p>  
<p>A.--The Square.</p>  
<p>G. M.--Have you applied the Square to those parts of the stone that should be squared?</p>

<p>G. M.--Having full confidence in your skill in the Royal Art, it remains with me to finish the work.</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The G. Master then gives three knocks upon the stone and says:</FONT></p>  
<p>"I find this foundation-stone well formed, true and trusty, and may this undertaking be conducted and completed by the Craftsmen, according to the Grand Plan, in Peace, Love, and Harmony."</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The D. G. M. then receives from the Grand Marshal the vessel containing Corn, and, spreading the corn upon the stone, says:</FONT></p>  
<p><A NAME="page_123"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 123</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"May the health of the workmen employed in this undertaking be preserved to them, and the Supreme Grand Architect bless and prosper their labors."</p>  
<p>Response: So mote it be.</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The G. S. Warden then receives from the Grand Marshal the vessel containing Wine, and, pouring it upon the stone, says:</FONT></p>  
<p>"May plenty be showered down upon the people of this State, and may the blessing of the bounteous Giver of all things attend their philanthropic undertakings."</p>  
<p>Response: So mote it be.</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The G. J. Warden then receives the vessel containing Oil, and pours it upon the stone, saying:</FONT></p>  
<p>"May the Supreme Ruler of the World preserve the people in peace, and vouchsafe to them the enjoyment of every blessing."</p>  
<p>G. M.--"May the Corn of nourishment, the Wine of refreshment, the Oil of joy, and all the necessaries of life abound among men throughout the world, and may the blessing of Almighty God be upon this undertaking, and may this structure here to be</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_124"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 124</FONT></A></p>  
<p>erected be preserved to the latest ages, in order that it may promote the useful purposes for which it is designed."</p>  
<p>Response: So mote it be.</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">The Grand Master then presents the implements to the Architect, saying:</FONT></p>  
<p>"To you, Brother Architect, are confided the implements of operative Masonry, with the fullest confidence that, by your skill and taste, a fabric shall arise which shall add new luster to your fame as a Master Builder; may it endure for many ages, a monument of the liberality and benevolence of its founders."</p>  
<p>Response: So mote it be.</p>  
<p><FONT SIZE="-1">An oration suitable to the occasion is then delivered. An ode sung, and a prayer concludes the ceremonies; when the Lodge returns, in the same form as above set out, to the place whence it came, and is closed in due form.</FONT></p>
