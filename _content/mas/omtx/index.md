# THE OFFICIAL MONITOR

##### of the

#### Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons

#### State of Texas

#### \[1922\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the 'Monitor' of the Texas Masons. It describes ceremonies,
including the those used for the three major initiations and the burial
rite. The Monitor has model speeches and prayers for various occasions,
and defines the order of Masonic processions. The Texas Monitor is
similar to the monitors of other states. Keep in mind that for copyright
purposes, the source text for this is an older version of the Texas
Monitor. The current Texas Monitor has undoubtedly changed slightly
since this edition was published.
