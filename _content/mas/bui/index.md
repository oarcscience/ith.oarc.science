This is a general survey of Masonic origins, history and philosophy. It
was at one time given to every new Mason in Iowa, probably a better
choice than [Morals and Dogma](../md/index), which is almost three times
as long and much more difficult reading. This is a scholarly but
approachable treatment of Masonry and will be enlightening both to
practicing Freemasons and a general audience.

Newton is a rationalist and deflates claims of an ancient origin for
Masonry *per se*; rather he illuminates the historical precedents of the
group. He starts with ancient Egypt, not because he believes that the
Egyptians had functioning Masonic lodges, but because that is where
monumental architecture began. He covers the ancient mystery religions,
and the true origin of Masonry in organizations of medieval
stone-masons. After a period of decline, a London meeting held in 1717
at the Goose and Gridiron Alehouse united the remaining four Lodges of
England, and started modern Freemasonry. The two-tier organization
proliferated into three, and then multiple degrees, during the 18th and
19th centuries, eventually resulting in modern Freemasonry.

Masonry, which had started as an underground association of building
trade workers, evolved into a fraternal group which included both
members of the English royal family and American revolutionaries.
Despite his rational stance, Newton is rhapsodic about the progressive
influence of the Masonic movement and philosophy, both for individuals
seeking 'the lost word', and for society as a whole. Newton claims that
the world has benefited greatly because of the Masonic ideals of
liberty, fraternity and equality. The Builders tells the Masonic side of
this story.
