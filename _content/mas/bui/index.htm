<P>This is a general survey of Masonic origins, history and philosophy.
It was at one time given to every new Mason in Iowa,
probably a better choice than <CITE><A HREF="../md/index.htm">Morals and Dogma</A></CITE>, which
is almost three times as long and much more difficult reading.
This is a scholarly but approachable treatment of Masonry and
will be enlightening both to practicing Freemasons and a general audience.
</P>

Newton is a rationalist and deflates claims of an ancient
origin for Masonry <I>per se</I>; rather he illuminates the
historical precedents of the group.
He starts with ancient Egypt, not because he believes that the
Egyptians had functioning Masonic lodges, but because
that is where monumental architecture began.
He covers the ancient mystery religions,
and the true origin of Masonry in organizations of medieval stone-masons.
After a period of decline, a London meeting held in 1717
at the Goose and Gridiron Alehouse
united the remaining four Lodges of England, and started modern Freemasonry.
The two-tier organization proliferated
into three, and then multiple degrees, during the 18th and 19th centuries,
eventually resulting in modern Freemasonry.

Masonry, which had started as an underground
association of building trade workers,
evolved into a fraternal group which included
both members of the English royal family and American revolutionaries.
Despite his rational stance, Newton is rhapsodic about the progressive
influence of the Masonic movement and philosophy, both for individuals seeking
'the lost word', and for society as a whole.
Newton claims that the world has benefited greatly because
of the Masonic ideals of liberty, fraternity and equality. 
<CITE>The Builders</CITE> tells the Masonic side of this story.
