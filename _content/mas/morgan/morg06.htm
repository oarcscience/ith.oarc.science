<p>Having described all the ceremonies and forms appertaining to the opening of a lodge of Entered Apprentice Masons, setting them to work, initiating a candidate, and closing the lodge, I will now proceed too give the lecture on this degree. It is divided into three sections. The lecture is nothing more or less than a recapitulation of the preceding ceremonies and forms, by way of question and answer, and fully explains the same. In fact, the ceremonies and forms (generally Masonically called <i>the work</i>) and lectures are so much the same that he who possesses a knowledge of the lectures cannot be destitute of a knowledge of what the ceremonies and forms are. As the ceremonies used in opening and closing are the same in all the degrees it is thought best to give the whole in one insertion; it being the sincere wish of the writer that every reader should perfectly understand all the formulas of the whole Masonic fabric, as he then will thereby be able to form correct opinions of the propriety or impropriety, advantages or disadvantages of the same.</p>  
<p align="center"><i>First Section of the Lecture on the First Degree of Masonry</i>.</p>  
<p>"From whence come you as an Entered Apprentice Mason?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "From the holy lodge of St. John, at Jerusalem." "What recommendations do you bring?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Recommendations from the Worshipful Master, Wardens and brethren of that right worshipful lodge, whom greet you."</p>  
<p>"What comest thou hither to do?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "To learn to subdue my passions, and improve myself in the secret arts and mysteries of ancient Freemasonry."</p>  
<p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="green">p. 34</font></A></p>  
<p>"You are a Mason, then I presume?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I am."</p>  
<p>"How shall I know you to be a Mason?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By certain signs and a token."</p>  
<p>"What are signs?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "All right angles, horizontals and perpendiculars."</p>  
<p>"What is a token?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "A certain friendly and brotherly grip, whereby one Mason may know another, in the dark as well as in the light."</p>  
<p>"Where were you first prepared to be made a Mason?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In my heart."</p>  
<p>"Where secondly?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In a room adjacent to the body of a just and lawfully constituted lodge of such."</p>  
<p>"How were you prepared?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By being divested of all metals, neither naked nor clothed, barefoot nor shod, hoodwinked, with a Cable Tow&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_0"></A><A HREF="#fn_0"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> about my neck, in which situation I was conducted to the door of the lodge."</p>  
<p>"You being hoodwinked how did you know it to be a door?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By first meeting with resistance, and afterwards gaining admission."</p>  
<p>"How did you gain admission?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By three distinct knocks from without, answered by the same within."</p>  
<p>"What was said to you from within?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Who comes there? Who comes there? Who comes there?</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "A poor blind candidate who has long been desirous of having and receiving a part of the rights and benefits of this worshipful lodge, dedicated to God, and held forth to the holy order of St. John, as all true fellows and brothers have done, who have gone this way before me."</p>  
<p>"What further was said to you from within?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was asked if it was of my own free will and accord I made this request, if I was duly and truly proposed, worthy and well qualified, all of which being answered in the affirmative, I was asked by what further rights I expected</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="green">p. 35</font></A></p>  
<p>to obtain so great a favor or benefit."</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By being a man, free born, of lawful age and well recommended."</p>  
<p>"What was then said to you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was bid to wait till the Worshipful Master in the east was made acquainted with my request and his answer returned."</p>  
<p>"After his answer returned what followed?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was caused to enter the lodge."</p>  
<p>"How?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "On the point of some sharp instrument pressing my naked left breast in the name of the Lord."</p>  
<p>"How were you then disposed of?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was conducted to the center of the lodge and there caused to kneel for the benefit of a prayer." [See page <A HREF="morg04.htm#page_19">19</A>.]</p>  
<p>"After prayer what was said to you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was asked in whom I put my trust."</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In God."</p>  
<p>"What followed?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Worshipful Master took me by the right hand and said, 'Since in God you put your trust, arise, and follow your leader, and fear no danger."'</p>  
<p>"How were you then disposed of?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was conducted three times regularly round the lodge and halted at the Junior Warden in the south, where the same questions were asked and answers returned as at the door."</p>  
<p>"How did the Junior Warden dispose of you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He ordered me to be conducted to the Senior Warden in the west; where the same questions were asked and answers returned as before."</p>  
<p>"How did the Senior Warden dispose of you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He ordered me to be conducted to the Worshipful Master in the east, where the same questions were asked and answers returned as before, who likewise demanded of me from whence I came and whither I was traveling."</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "From the west and traveling to the east."</p>  
<p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="green">p. 36</font></A></p>  
<p>"Why do you leave the west and travel to the east?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In search of light."</p>  
<p>"How did the Worshipful Master then dispose of you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He ordered me to be conducted back to the west, from whence I came, and put in the care of the Senior Warden, who taught me how to approach the east, the place of light, by advancing upon one upright regular step to the first step, my feet forming the right angle of an oblong square, my body erect at the altar before the Worshipful Master."</p>  
<p>"What did the Worshipful Master do with you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "He made an Entered Apprentice Mason of me."</p>  
<p>"How?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "In due form."</p>  
<p>"What was that due form?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "My left knee bare, bent, my right forming a square; my left hand supporting the Holy Bible, Square, and Compass, and my right covering the same; in which position I took upon me the solemn oath or obligation of an Entered Apprentice Mason. [See page <A HREF="morg04.htm#page_21">21</A>.]</p>  
<p>"After you had taken your obligation what was said to you?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was asked what I most desired."</p>  
<p>"Your answer?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Light."</p>  
<p>"Were you immediately brought to light?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was."</p>  
<p>"How?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "By the direction of the Master and assistance of the brethren."</p>  
<p>"What did you first discover after being brought to light?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Three great lights in Masonry, by the assistance of three lesser."</p>  
<p>"What were those three great lights in Masonry?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Holy Bible, Square and Compass."</p>  
<p>"How are they explained?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Holy Bible is given to us as a guide for our faith and practice; the Square to square our actions; and the Compass to keep us in due bounds with all mankind, but more especially with the brethren."</p>  
<p><font size="-1" color="green">[Gap in text]</font> may know another in the dark as well as the light."</p>  
<p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="green">p. 37</font></A></p>  
<p>"What were those three lesser lights?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Three burning tapers, or candle, on candle sticks."</p>  
<p>"What do they represent?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Sun, Moon, and Master of the lodge."</p>  
<p>"How are they explained?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "As the Sun rules the day, and the Moon governs the night, so ought the Worshipful Master to use his endeavors to rule and govern his lodge with equal regularity or cause the same to be done."</p>  
<p>"What did you next discover?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Worshipful Master approaching me from the east, under the sign and due-guard of an Entered Apprentice Mason, who presented me with his right hand in token of brotherly love and esteem, and proceeded to give me the grip and word of an Entered Apprentice Mason, and bid me arise and salute the Junior and Senior Wardens and convince them that I had been regularly initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason, and was in possession of the sign, grip and word."</p>  
<p>"What did you next discover?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Worshipful Master a second time approaching me from the east, who presented me with a lambskin or white apron, which he said was an emblem of innocence, and the badge of a Mason; that it had been worn by kings, princes and potentates of the earth who had never been ashamed to wear it; that it was more honorable than the diadems of kings or pearls of princesses, when worthily worn, and more ancient than the Golden Fleece, or Roman Eagle, more honorable than the Star or Garter, or any other order that could be conferred upon me at that time or any time thereafter, except it be in the body of a just and lawfully constituted lodge of Masons; and bid me carry it to the Senior Warden in the west, who taught me how to wear it as an Entered Apprentice Mason."</p>  
<p>"What were you next presented with?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The working tools of an Entered Apprentice Mason."</p>  
<p>"What were they?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "A twenty-four inch gauge and common gavel."</p>  
<p>"How were they explained?"</p>  
<p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="green">p. 38</font></A></p>  
<p>Ans. "The twenty-four inch gauge is an instrument made use of by operative masons to measure and lay out their work, but we as Free and Accepted Masons are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of dividing our time; the twenty-four inches on the gauge are emblematical of the twenty-four hours in the day, which we are taught to divide into three equal parts, whereby we find eight hours for the service of God and a worthy distressed brother, eight hours for our usual vocation, and eight hours for refreshment and sleep. The common gavel is an instrument made use of by operative masons to break off the corners of rough stones, the better to fit them for the builder's use, but we, as Free and Accepted Masons, are taught to make use of it for the more noble and glorious purpose of divesting our hearts and consciences of all the vices and superfluities of life, thereby fitting our minds as lively and living stones for that spiritual building, that House not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."</p>  
<p>"What were you next presented with?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "A new name."</p>  
<p>"What was that?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Caution."</p>  
<p>"What does it teach?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "It teaches me as I was barely instructed in the rudiments of Masonry, that I should be cautious over all my words and actions, especially when before its enemies."</p>  
<p>"What were you next presented with?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Three precious jewels."</p>  
<p>"What are they?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "A listening ear, a silent tongue, and a faithful heart."</p>  
<p>"What do they teach?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "A listening ear teaches me to listen to the instructions of the Worshipful Master, but more especially that I should listen to the calls and cries of a worthy distressed brother. A silent tongue teaches me to be silent in the lodge, that the peace and harmony thereof may not he disturbed; but more especially that I should be silent when before the enemies of Masonry. A faithful heart, that I should be faithful to the instructions of the Worshipful Master at all times, but more especially that I should be faithful</p>  
<p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="green">p. 39</font></A></p>  
<p>and keep and conceal the secrets of Masonry, and those of a brother, when given to me in charge as such, that they remain as secure and inviolable in my breast, as in his own before communicated to me."</p>  
<p>"What were you next presented with?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Check-words two."</p>  
<p>"What were they?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "Truth and Union."</p>  
<p>"How explained?"</p>  
<p>"Truth is a divine attribute, and the foundation of every virtue. To be good and true are the first lessons we are taught in Masonry. On this theme we contemplate, and by its dictates endeavor to regulate our conduct; hence, while influenced by this principle, hypocrisy and deceit are unknown amongst us; sincerity and plain dealing distinguishes us; and heart and tongue join in promoting each other's welfare, and rejoicing in each other's prosperity. Union is that kind of friendship that ought to appear conspicuous in the conduct of every Mason. It is so closely allied to the divine attribute, truth, that he who enjoys the one is seldom destitute of the other. Should interest, honor, prejudice, or human depravity ever influence you to violate any part of the sacred trust we now repose in you, let these two important words, at the earliest insinuation, teach you to put on the check-line of truth, which will infallibly direct you to pursue that strait and narrow path, which ends in the full enjoyment of the Grand Lodge above, where we shall all meet as Masons and members of one family; where all discord on account of religion, politics or private opinion shall be unknown and banished from within our walls."</p>  
<p>"What followed?"</p>  
<p>Ans. "The Worshipful Master in the east made a demand of me something of a <A HREF="errata.htm#2">metallic</A> kind, which he said was not so much on account of its intrinsic value, as that it might be deposited in the archives of the lodge, as a memorial that I had therein been made a Mason."</p>  
<p>"How did the Worshipful Master then dispose of you?"</p>  
<p>"He ordered me to be conducted out of the lodge and vested of what I had been divested, and returned for further instructions."</p>  
<p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="green">p. 40</font></A></p>  
<p>"After you returned how were you disposed of."</p>  
<p>Ans. "I was conducted to the northeast corner of the lodge, and there caused to stand upright like a man, my feet forming a square, and received a solemn injunction, ever to walk and act uprightly before God and man, and in addition thereto, received the following charge: [For this charge see page <A HREF="morg04.htm#page_27">27</A>.]</p>
