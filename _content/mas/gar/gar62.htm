<p>THE new Lodge having been Consecrated, Dedicated and Constituted, the officers are then to be installed.</p>  
<p>At every annual election in a warranted Lodge, it is necessary that the officers should be installed. This ceremony may be performed by any Past Master. At the Annual Installation, the Installing Officer appoints some Present or Past Master, or, if none be present, an old well-informed Master Mason, to act as Marshal, whose duties will be to present the officers elect severally in front of the altar for installation.</p>  
<p>The jewels of the several officers are collected, and laid in an orderly manner upon the altar, for convenient use.</p>  
<p>The Grand Master or Installing Officer then says:</p>  
<p>RIGHT WORSHIPFUL DEPUTY: Have you carefully examined the Master nominated in the warrant (or elect), and do you find him well-skilled in the noble science and the royal art?</p>  
<p>The Deputy replies:</p>  
<p>MOST WORSHIPFUL GRAND MASTER: I have carefully examined, and so find him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_34"></A><A HREF="#fn_34"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p><i>G. M.</i> You will then present him at the altar for installation.</p>  
<p>The Deputy, taking the Master elect, presents him at the altar, saying:</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="green">p. 241</font></A></p>  
<p>MOST WORSHIPFUL GRAND MASTER: I present my worthy Brother, A. B., to be installed Master of this [new] Lodge. I find him to be of good morals and of great skill, true and trusty; and as he is a lover of the Fraternity, I doubt not he will discharge his duties with fidelity and with honor.</p>  
<p>The Grand Master then addresses him:</p>  
<p>BROTHER: Previous to your investiture, it is necessary that you should signify your assent to those Ancient Charges and Regulations which point out the duty of a Master of a Lodge.</p>  
<p>The Grand Master then reads a summary of the Ancient Charges to the Master elect, as follows:</p>  
<p>I. You agree to be a good man and true, and strictly to obey the moral law?</p>  
<p><i>Ans</i>. I do.</p>

<p>XIII. You admit that no new Lodge shall be</p>  
<p><a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="green">p. 244</font></A></p>  
<p>formed without permission of the Grand Lodge; and that no countenance be given to any irregular Lodge, or to any person clandestinely initiated therein, being contrary to the Ancient Charges of the Order?</p>  
<p><i>Ans</i>. I do.</p>  
<p>XIV. You admit that no person can be regularly made a Mason in, or admitted a member of, any regular Lodge, without previous notice, and due inquiry into his character?</p>

<p><i>Ans</i>. I do.</p>  
<p>These are the Regulations of Free and Accepted Masons.</p>  
<p>The Grand Master then addresses the Master elect as follows:</p>  
<p>Do you submit to these Charges, and promise to support these Regulations, as Masters have done in all ages before you?</p>  
<p>The Master having signified his cordial submission, as before, the Grand Master thus addresses him;</p>  
<p><a name="page_245"><font size="1" color="green">p. 245</font></A></p>  
<p>BROTHER A. B.: In consequence of your conformity to the Charges and Regulations of the Order, you are now to be installed Master of this Lodge, in full confidence of your care, skill, and capacity to govern the same.</p>  
<p>The Master is then regularly invested with the insignia of his office, and the furniture and implements of his Lodge. The various implements of his profession are emblematical of our conduct in life, and upon this occasion are carefully enumerated.</p>  
<p>The <i>Holy Writings</i>, that great light in Masonry, will guide you to all truth; it will direct your paths to the temple of happiness, and point out to you the whole duty of man.</p>  
<p>The <i>Square</i> teaches us to regulate our actions by rule and line, and to harmonize our conduct by the principles of morality and virtue.</p>  
<p>The <i>Compasses</i> teach us to limit our desires in every station, that, rising to eminence by merit, we may live respected and die regretted.</p>  
<p>The <i>Rule</i> directs that we should punctually observe our duty; press forward in the path of virtue, and, neither inclining to the right nor to the left, in all our actions have eternity in view.</p>  
<p>The <i>Line</i> teaches us the criterion of moral</p>  
<p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></A></p>  
<p>rectitude, to avoid dissimulation in conversation and action, and to direct our steps to the path which leads to immortality.</p>  
<p>The <i>Book of Constitutions</i> you are to search at all times. Cause it to be read in your Lodge, that none may pretend ignorance of the excellent precepts it enjoins.</p>  
<p>You now receive in charge the <i>Charter</i>, by the authority of which this Lodge is held. You are carefully to preserve, and in no case should it ever be out of your immediate control, and duly transmit it to your successor in office.</p>  
<p>You will also receive in charge the <i>By-Laws</i> of your Lodge, which you are to see carefully and punctually executed.</p>  
<p>You will now be solemnly inducted into the oriental chair of King SOLOMON; during the performance of this ceremony it is requested that all but regularly-installed Masters of Lodges and Past Masters will retire.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_35"></A><A HREF="#fn_35"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></p>  
<p>All but actual Masters and Past Masters of Warranted Lodges&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_36"></A><A HREF="#fn_36"><FONT SIZE="1">&#8224;</FONT></A> are required to retire (or, if more convenient, are</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_247"><font size="1" color="green">p. 247</font></A></p>  
<p>requested to face to the West); the new Master is then invested with the mysteries of the Past Master's degree, and solemnly inducted into the oriental chair of SOLOMON. When the doors are opened, the brethren return (or are requested to face the East); and, forming an avenue on each side, from the West to the East, the new Master being in the chair, the Grand Master says:</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_24700"></A>
<IMG SRC="img/24700.jpg"></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Master, behold your brethren!</p>  
<p>Brethren, behold your Master!</div></p>  
<p>The grand honors are then given.</p>  
<p>When the grand honors are given, a procession is formed, and the brethren pass around the Lodge, signifying their respect and obedience by the usual <i>distinctive marks</i> in the different degrees; during which time the following Installation Ode may be sung:</p>  
<p><a name="page_248"><font size="1" color="green">p. 248</font></A></p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_24800"></A>
<span ALIGN="CENTER">
<A HREF="img/24800.jpg"><IMG SRC="tn/24800.jpg" ALT="Music&#8212;<i>Italian Hymn</i>."><BR><FONT SIZE=-3>Click to enlarge</A><BR>Music&#8212;<i>Italian Hymn</i>.</FONT><BR></span></p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Hail, Masonry divine,<br> Glory of ages, shine;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Long mayst thou reign!<br> Where&#8217;er thy Lodges stand,<br> May they have great command,<br> And always grace the land;<br> Thou art divine.</p>  
<p>Great fabrics still arise,<br> And grace the azure skies&#8212;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great are thy schemes;<br> Thy noble orders are<br> Matchless beyond compare; <a name="page_249"><font size="1" color="green">p. 249</font></A><br> No art with thee can share;<br> Thou art divine.</p>  
<p>HIRAM, the architect,<br> Did all the Craft direct<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;How they should build;<br> SOLOMON, great Israel's king,<br> Did mighty blessings bring,<br> And left us room to sing,<br> Hail, Royal Art!</small></div></p>  
<p>After the singing of the ode, the Master calls the Lodge to order, and the other officers are respectively presented in the same manner as the Master, by the Conductor, When the installing officer delivers to each a short Charge, as follows:</p>  <h4 align="center">THE SENIOR WARDEN.</h4>  
<p>BROTHER C. D.: You are appointed&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_37"></A><A HREF="#fn_37"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> Senior Warden of this Lodge, and are now invested with the insignia of your office.</p>  
<p>The <i>Level</i> demonstrates that we are descended from the same stock, partake of the same nature, and share the same hope; and though distinctions among men are necessary to preserve subordination, yet no eminence of station should make us forget that we are brethren; for he who is placed on the lowest spoke of Fortune's wheel may be entitled to our regard; because a time</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_250"><font size="1" color="green">p. 250</font></A></p>  
<p>will come, and the wisest knows not how soon, when all distinctions, but that of goodness, shall cease; and Death, the grand leveler of human greatness, reduce us to the same state.</p>  
<p>Your regular attendance on our stated meetings is essentially necessary. In the absence of the Master, you are to govern this Lodge; in his presence, you are to assist him in the government of it. I firmly rely on your knowledge of Masonry and attachment to the Lodge for the faithful discharge of the duties of this important trust. <i>Look well to the West</i>.</p>  
<p>He is conducted to his station in the Lodge.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE JUNIOR WARDEN.</h4>  
<p>BROTHER E. F: You are appointed Junior Warden of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office.</p>  
<p>The <i>Plumb</i> admonishes us to walk uprightly in our several stations; to hold the scales of Justice in equal poise; to observe the just medium between intemperance and pleasure; and to make our passions and prejudices coincide with the line of our duty. To you is committed the superintendence of the Craft during the hours</p>  
<p><a name="page_251"><font size="1" color="green">p. 251</font></A></p>  
<p>of refreshment: it is, therefore, indispensably necessary that you should not only be temperate and discreet in the indulgence of your own inclinations, but carefully observe that none of the Craft be suffered to convert the purposes of refreshment into intemperance and excess.&#8212;Your regular and punctual attendance is particularly requested, and I have no doubt that you will faithfully execute the duty which you owe to your present appointment.&#8212;<i>Look well to the South</i>.</p>  
<p>He is conducted to his station.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE TREASURER.</h4>  
<p>BROTHER G. H.: You are appointed Treasurer of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. It is your dirty to receive all moneys from the hands of the Secretary; keep just and regular accounts of the same, and pay them out by order of the Worshipful Master and the consent of the Lodge. I trust your regard for the Fraternity will prompt you to the faithful discharge of the duties of your office.</p>  
<p>He is conducted to his station.</p>  
<p><a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="green">p. 252</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">THE SECRETARY.</h4>  
<p>BROTHER I. K.: You are appointed Secretary of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. It is your duty to observe all the proceedings of the Lodge; make a fair record of all things proper to be written; receive all moneys due the Lodge, and pay them over to the Treasurer. Your good inclination to Masonry and this Lodge, I hope, will induce you to discharge the duties of your office with fidelity, and, by so doing, you will merit the esteem and applause of your brethren.</p>  
<p>He is conducted to his station.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE CHAPLAIN.</h4>  
<p>REV. BROTHER L. M.: You are appointed Chaplain of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. It is your duty to perform those solemn services which we should constantly render to our infinite Creator; and which, when offered by one whose holy profession is "to point to heaven, and lead the way," may, by refining our souls, strengthening our virtues, and purifying our minds, prepare us for admission into the society of those above, whose happiness will be as endless as it is perfect.</p>  
<p><a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="green">p. 253</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">THE SENIOR AND JUNIOR DEACONS.</h4>  
<p>BROTHERS L. M. AND N. O.: You are appointed Deacons of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. It is your province to attend on the Master and Wardens, and to act as their proxies in the active duties of the Lodge; such as in the reception of candidates into the different degrees of Masonry; the introduction and accommodation of visitors, and in the immediate practice of our rites. The Square and Compasses, as badges of your office, I intrust to your care, not doubting your vigilance and attention.</p>  
<p>They are conducted to their stations.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE STEWARDS, OR MASTERS OF CEREMONIES.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_38"></A><A HREF="#fn_38"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A></h4>  
<p>BROTHERS R. S. AND T. U.: You are appointed Stewards (Masters of Ceremonies) of this Lodge, and are now invested with the badge of your office. You are to assist the Deacons and other officers in performing their respective duties. Your regular and early attendance at our meetings will afford the best proof of your zeal and attachment to the Lodge.</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_254"><font size="1" color="green">p. 254</font></A></p>  <h4 align="center">THE TILER.</h4>  
<p>BROTHER V. W.: You are appointed Tiler of this Lodge, and I invest you with the implement of your office. As the sword is placed in the hands of the Tiler, to enable him effectually to guard against the approach of cowans and eavesdroppers, and suffer none to pass or repass but such as are duly qualified, so it should admonish us to set a guard over our thoughts, a watch at our lips, post a sentinel over our actions; thereby preventing the approach of every unworthy thought or deed, and preserving consciences void of offense toward GOD and toward man. Your early and punctual attendance will afford the best proof of your zeal for the institution.</p>  
<p>He is conducted to his station.</p>  <h4 align="center">CHARGES TO THE OFFICERS.</h4>  
<p>WORSHIPFUL MASTER: The Grand Lodge having committed to your care the superintendence and government of the brethren who are to compose this Lodge, you cannot be insensible of the obligations which devolve on you as their head, nor of your responsibility for the faithful discharge of the important duties annexed to</p>  
<p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="green">p. 255</font></A></p>  
<p>your appointment. The honor, reputation, and usefulness of your Lodge will materially depend on the skill and assiduity with which you manage its concerns; while the happiness of its members will be generally promoted, in proportion to the zeal and ability with which you propagate the genuine principles of our institution.</p>  
<p>For a pattern of imitation, consider the great luminary of Nature, which, rising in the <i>East</i>, regularly diffuses light and luster to all within the circle. In like manner, it is your province to spread and communicate light and instruction to the brethren of your Lodge. Forcibly impress upon them the dignity and high importance of Masonry; and seriously admonish them never to disgrace it. Charge them to practice <i>out</i> of the Lodge those duties which they have been taught in it; and by amiable, discreet, and virtuous conduct, to convince mankind of the goodness of the institution; so that when a person is said to be a member of it, the world may know that he is one to whom the burdened heart may pour out its sorrows; to whom distress may prefer its suit; whose hand is guided by justice, and whose heart is expanded by benevolence. In</p>  
<p><a name="page_256"><font size="1" color="green">p. 256</font></A></p>  
<p>short, by a diligent observance of the By-laws of your Lodge, the Constitutions of Masonry, and, above all, the Holy Scriptures, which are given as a rule and guide to your faith, you will be enabled to acquit yourself with honor and reputation, and lay up a <i>crown of rejoicing</i>, which shall continue when time shall be no more.</p>  
<p>&nbsp;</p>  
<p>BROTHER SENIOR AND JUNIOR WARDENS: You are too well acquainted with the principles of Masonry, to warrant any distrust that you will be found wanting in the discharge of your respective duties. Suffice it to say, that what you have seen praiseworthy in others, you should carefully imitate; and what in them may have appeared defective, you should in yourselves amend. You should be examples of good order and regularity; for it is only by a due regard to the laws, in your own conduct, that you can expect obedience to them from others. You are assiduously to assist the Master in the discharge of his trust; diffusing light and imparting knowledge to all whom he shall place under your care. In the absence of the Master, you will succeed to higher duties; your acquirements must, therefore, be such, as that the Craft may never suffer for want of</p>  
<p><a name="page_257"><font size="1" color="green">p. 257</font></A></p>  
<p>proper instruction. From the spirit which you have hitherto evinced, I entertain no doubt that your future conduct will be such as to merit the applause of your brethren and the testimony of a good conscience.</p>  
<p>The members of the Lodge then, all standing, the Grand Master delivers the following</p>  <h4 align="center">CHARGE TO THE BRETHREN OF THE LODGE.</h4>  
<p>Such is the nature of our constitution, that as some must of necessity rule and teach, so others must, of course, learn to submit and obey. Humility, in both, is an essential duty. The officers who are appointed to govern your Lodge are sufficiently conversant with the rules of propriety, and the laws of the institution, to avoid exceeding the powers with which they are intrusted; and you are of too generous dispositions to envy their preferment. I, therefore, trust that you will have but one aim, to please each other, and unite in the grand design of being happy and communicating happiness.</p>  
<p>Finally, my brethren, as this association has been formed and perfected in so much unanimity and concord, in which we greatly rejoice, so may it long continue. May you long enjoy every</p>  
<p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="green">p. 258</font></A></p>  
<p>satisfaction and delight, which disinterested friendship can afford. May kindness and brotherly affection distinguish your conduct, as men and as Masons. Within your peaceful walls, may your children's children celebrate with joy and gratitude the annual recurrence of this auspicious solemnity. And may the <i>tenets of our profession</i> be transmitted through your Lodge, pure and unimpaired, from generation to generation.</p>  
<p>The Grand Marshal then proclaims the new Lodge, as follows:</p>  
<p>In the name of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of the State of ........, I proclaim this new Lodge, by the name of ...... Lodge, No. ...., legally consecrated, dedicated, constituted, and the officers duly installed.</p>  
<p>The grand honors are then given.</p>  
<p>The following, or some other appropriate ODE may he sung:</p>  
<p align="center"><A NAME="img_25800"></A>

<p><a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="green">p. 260</font></A></p>  
<p>The new Master may return thanks.</p>  
<p>The Grand Chaplain then pronounces the following, or some other appropriate</p>  <h4 align="center">BENEDICTION.</h4>  
<p>ALMIGHTY and everlasting GOD, from whom cometh every good and perfect gift, send down upon thy servants here assembled the healthful spirit of thy grace, that they may truly please thee in all their doings. Grant, O LORD, power of mind and great understanding unto those whom we have this day clothed with authority to preside over and direct the affairs of this Lodge; and so replenish them with the truth of thy doctrine, and adorn them with humility of life, that, both by word and good example, they may faithfully serve thee, to the glory of thy holy name, and to the advancement, for all good purposes, of our beloved institution.&#8212;AMEN.</p>  
<p><i>Response</i>.&#8212;So mote it be.</p>  
<p>The Grand Lodge returns to its own hall, and closes.</p>
