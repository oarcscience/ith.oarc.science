#### REGULATIONS FOR PROCESSIONS.

When the Grand Master, Deputy Grand Master, or either of the Grand
Wardens, joins the procession of a private Lodge, proper respect is to
be paid to the rank of that officer. His position will be immediately
before the Master and Wardens of the Lodge, and two Deacons will be
appointed to attend him.

When the Grand or Deputy Grand Master is present, the Book of
Constitutions will be borne before him. The honor of carrying this book
belongs of right to the Master of the oldest Lodge in the jurisdiction,
whenever he is present. The Book of Constitutions must never be borne in
a procession unless the Grand or Deputy Grand Master be present.

In entering public buildings, the Bible, Square, and Compasses, and the
Book of Constitutions, are to be placed in front of the Grand Master,
and the Grand Marshal and Grand Deacons must keep near him.

When a procession faces inward, the Deacons and Stewards will cross
their rods, so as to form an arch for the brethren to pass beneath.

Marshals are to walk or ride on the left flank of a procession. The
appropriate costume of a Marshal is a cocked hat, sword and scarf, with
a baton in his hand. The color of the scarf must be blue in the
procession of a Subordinate Lodge, and purple in that of the Grand
Lodge.

All processions will return in the same order in which they set out.

The post of honor in a Masonic procession is always in the rear.
