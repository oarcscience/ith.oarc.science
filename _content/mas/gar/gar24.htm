<p>Lodge meetings, at the present day, are usually held in upper chambers&#8212;probably for the better security which such places afford. It may be, however, that the custom had its origin in a practice observed by the ancient Jews, of building their temples, schools, and synagogues on high hills,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_10"></A><A HREF="#fn_10"><FONT SIZE="1">*</FONT></A> a practice which seems to have met the approbation of the ALMIGHTY, who said unto the Prophet EZEKIEL, "Upon the top of the mountain, the whole limit thereof, round about shall be most holy."
