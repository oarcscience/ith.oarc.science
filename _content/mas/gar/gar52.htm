<p>In the old philosophies, the number 12 always concealed a mystical sense, and was considered a symbol of divine ideas. But here the twelve F. C. represent the companions of Isis, who assisted her in her long and wearisome search after the body of the slain OSIRIS.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE ACACIA-TREE.</h4>  
<p>The "sprig of acacia" has, in the Masonic system, a solemn importance. It is a handsome tree, noted for its remarkably graceful and flexible leaves, of yellowish green, which droop down, and wave in the breeze, like luxuriant locks of hair. It held a sacred place in the ancient initiations, and, like the weeping-willow, was the symbol of tender sympathy and undying affection. An emblem, too, of immortality, it was most fittingly employed to mark the last resting-place of the distinguished dead.</p>  <h4 align="center">THE LETTER G.</h4>  
<p>This letter is deservedly regarded as one of the most sacred of the Masonic emblems. Where it is used, however, as a symbol of Deity, it must be remembered that it is the Saxon representative of the Hebrew <i>Yod</i> and the Greek <i>Tau</i>&#8212;the initial letters of the Eternal in those languages.</p>  
<p>This symbol proves that Freemasonry always prosecuted its labors with reference to the grand ideas of Infinity and Eternity. By the letter <b>G</b>&#8212;which conveyed to the minds of the brethren, at the same time, the idea of GOD and that of Geometry&#8212;it bound heaven to earth, the divine to the human, and the infinite to the finite.</p>  
<p>Masons are taught to regard the Universe as the grandest of all symbols, revealing to men, in all ages, the ideas which are eternally revolving in the mind of the Divinity, and which it is their duty to reproduce in their own lives and in the world of art and industry. Thus GOD and Geometry, the material worlds and the spiritual spheres, were constantly united in the speculations of the ancient Masons. They, consequently, labored earnestly and unweariedly, not only to construct cities, and embellish them with magnificent</p>  
<p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></A></p>  
<p>edifices, but also to build up a temple of great and divine thoughts and of ever-growing virtues for the soul to dwell in.</p>  
<p>The symbolical letter G&#8212;</p>  
<p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;* "That Hieroglyphic bright,<br> Which none but Craftsmen ever saw,"</small></div></p>  
<p>and before which every true Mason reverently uncovers, and bows his head&#8212;is a perpetual condemnation of profanity, impiety, and vice. No brother who has bowed before that emblem, can be profane. He will never speak the name of the Grand Master of the Universe but with reverence, respect, and love. He will learn, by studying the mystic meaning of the letter G, to model his life after the divine plan; and, thus instructed, he will strive to be like GOD in the activity and earnestness of his benevolence, and the broadness and efficiency of his charity.</p>
