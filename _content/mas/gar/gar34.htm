<p>BROTHER: Our institution breathes a spirit of general philanthropy. Its benefits, in a social point of view, are extensive. In the most endearing ties, it unites all mankind. In every nation, wherever civilization extends&#8212;and not unfrequently among the wild savages of the forest&#8212;it opens an asylum to a</p>

<p>brother in distress, and grants hospitality to the necessitous and unfortunate. The sublime principles of universal goodness and love to all mankind, which are essential to it, cannot be lost in national distinctions, prejudices, and animosities. The rage of contest and the sanguinary conflict have, by its recognized principles, been abated, and the milder emotions of humanity substituted. It has often performed the part of the Angel of Goodness, in ministering to the wants of the sick, the wounded, and the unfortunate prisoner of war. It has even taught the pride of victory to give way to the dictates of an honorable connection.</p>  
<p>Pure patriotism will always animate you to every call of your country to repel an invading foreign foe, or in subduing the rebellious intentions of those within the limits of our own land who become faithless to the high duty of a citizen. But should you, while engaged in the service of your country, be made captive, you may find affectionate brethren where others would only find enemies.</p>  
<p>The institution also demands that you shall be a quiet and peaceable citizen, true to your government, and just to your country; yielding obedience to the laws which afford you protection.</p>  
<p>In whatever country you travel, when you meet a Mason, you will find a brother and a friend, who will do all in his power to serve you; and who will relieve you, should you be poor or in distress, to the utmost of his ability, and with a ready cheerfulness.</p>
