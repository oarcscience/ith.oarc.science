------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sacred Books of the East (SBE) series, comprising fifty volumes, was
issued by the Oxford University Press between 1879 and 1910. It has
translations of key sacred texts of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism,
Confucianism, Zoroastrianism, Jainism, and Islam. The series was edited
by the famous linguist and scholar of comparative religion, Max Müller.
He wrote three of the volumes, and collaborated on three others. The SBE
has been designated by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and
Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as part of the UNESCO Collection of
Representative Works.

This series was the one of the inspirations for the sacred-texts
website. As [most of the SBE texts are in the public domain worldwide
(and all of them in are public domain in the US)](#pubdomain), we have a
long term project of converting the entire series to etexts. This page
is a progress report on this project, and a way of centralizing known
bibliographic information on the SBE.

**NEW: The SBE is complete**

As of September 2008, we have now reached a key milestone, completing
and posting substantial etexts of all of the original 49 volumes of the
SBE. This has been a ten-year project. The first volumes, the Upanishads
(SBE 1 and 15), were originally scanned in 1997, two years before the
inception of sacred-texts. All of these etexts, with the exception of
volume 25, were prepared at sacred-texts, or by volunteers. At this
point, future work on this project will involve bringing the older
etexts up to current standards, and the completion of [SBE
50](sbe50/index), the General Index.

The difficulties of turning these books into etexts were enormous, and
required great care and diligence. These volumes represent some of the
most difficult work in the field of etext preparation. Two of the main
problems are the use of italics in transliteration and the extensive
footnotes. Optical character recognition (OCR) software can produce an
approximate transcript of this specialized typography, but stock HTML
cannot is not equipped to display it. We had to invent a software
technology (STML, Sacred Texts Markup Language) to produce the HTML
versions of these texts, in addition to proofing them.

The SBE texts suffer from the usual disease of Victorian scholarly
texts; they are replete with extensive (and often superfluous)
introductory matter and footnotes. The footnotes in a typical SBE volume
can comprise from one-half to two-thirds of the bulk of the text. The
scholarly apparatus is set in a smaller typeface and it proved very
difficult to OCR and proofread.

However, there are compelling reasons to revisit these books. In some
cases these are the only available translations of a particular text, or
the principal reference version, or sourced from a rare manuscript. Case
in point, nobody has attempted to retranslate the Satapatha Brahmana
since Eggeling's comprehensive five-part SBE translation.

The original Oxford University Press printing was of very high quality.
Not only is the typography exquisite, they were proofed to perfection;
some have zero typographical errors, after thorough proofing using
modern software.

Today these first editions are very rare. However, these books have been
reprinted most notably by Dover Publications, and the Indian firm of
Motilal Banarsidass.

A very few of the more important volumes have been reproduced by Dover
publications. The Dover versions are inexpensive but very high quality
trade paperbacks, with those almost indestructible Dover bindings.
Unfortunately, some of the SBE reprints in the Dover line are now out of
print; they are extensively available used, however.

[A list of available SBE reprints (mostly from Dover) is available
here.](#sbereprints)

The Indian publishing firm of [Motilal
Banarsidass](https://www.mlbd.com/) has reprinted the entire set in
hardcover (ISBN 8120801016). This is the version found at most large
public and academic libraries. These are printed on substandard paper
and the binding is often sloppy. Inverted signatures are not rare; and I
have one which was bound with the cover upside down! They are however,
cheap and available, particularly if purchased used.

The Banarsidass SBE lists for 9000 Rs or approximately US $200, with
separate volumes priced at 200 Rs, or about US $4.50. I was quoted US
$495.95 for the set if you order it direct from Motilal Banarsidass and
have it shipped to the US. So that might be your best bet if you want
the whole set. These are the prices listed on their website, and
presumably reflect the retail price in India.

Be prepared to pay a ***lot*** more if you order the Motilal Banarsidass
SBE set through a bookstore in the US. A US list price of US $2,250 is
not unheard of! The books are not available through normal channels and
must be shipped from India; the size of the set (as well as its
specialized nature) makes it unreasonable for American or European
distributors or bookstores to keep it in stock. Used sets have been
listed from US $600 to US $1,250. Individual used volumes can run
anywhere from US $10 up on the used book sites.

In spite of all these difficulties, the translations are uniformly of
high quality and are essential for scholars of religion. For this
reason, we feel that it is important that this material be published on
the Internet.

# <span id="sbeauthors">Index of Translators of the Sacred Books of the East</span>

## <span id="pubdomain">Notes on public domain status of the SBE</span>

All volumes of the SBE were originally published in the UK prior to the
1923 cutoff for the public domain in the US (by the 1998 US copyright
law). This means that **the SBE is in the public domain in the US in its
entirety**. Since sacred-texts is hosted in the United States by a US
citizen, this site follows US copyright law, and all of the SBE texts
are candiates for conversion to etext. If you are a US citizen, you can
use any of the works in the SBE freely, for any purpose, without asking
anyone's permission or paying anyone a fee.

The situation is a bit different in the UK and EU. UK and EU copyrights
last 70 years after the death of the author. This means that as of 2005,
works of authors who died prior to 1935 are now in the public domain. As
can be seen from the table below, this means that the vast majority of
the SBE texts are in the public domain (or will enter it in the next few
years) according to the stringent UK and EU copyright laws. The
remaining volumes not in the public domain in the UK and EU are those
authored by Herman Jacobi, deceased 1937 ([22](#sbe22) and
[45](#sbe45)), Junjiro Takakusu, deceased 1945 (co-author of
[49](#sbe49)) and Moriz Winternitz, deceased 1937 (vol. [50,](#sbe50)
the index).

Another point is that the Motilal Banarsidass reprints have always had a
formal copyright notice. Whether this is enforceable is dubious. The
Indian copyright term is 60 years, which means all of these texts will
be the public domain in India as of the end of 2005 (since the last SBE
author died in 1945).

Other countries typically use 50 to 100 years after the decease of the
author, Canada, Australia and others use a 50 year rule. Mexico gets the
award for the **worst public-domain-unfriendly copyright laws
worldwide**. Mexico recently extended its term to 100 years, which means
**over two-thirds of the SBE have a restored and enforcable copyright in
Mexico!** Most countries use a 70 year term. So depending on what
country you reside in, your rights to view some of these etexts may
vary.

# <span id="sbereprints">List of SBE reprints</span>

*[Click here to search for 'Sacred Books of the East' at
Amazon.com](../books/sbe)  
Note that this may or may not produce relevant results, nor the best
available deal on used copies.*

This is a list of editions of SBE texts currently in print and available
through Amazon.com. By purchasing a book through these links you can
help sacred-texts continue its work. Note that some of the Legge books
are reprints of a series of Chinese Classics which significantly overlap
the work he did for the SBE. Also, we have not actually seen some of the
versions below; they may be edited or abridged versions of the SBE
texts. All of the Dover versions, however, are exact reproductions of
the originals. Reprints of some other SBE volumes are available in out
of print Dover versions; they can often be found at used bookstores.
