### BASILIDES.

Hippolytus, in accordance with his theses that all these "heresies" were
mere plagiarisms from the more ancient philosophical systems, declares
that Basilides stole the entire of his scheme from Aristotle, and
proceeds to establish his charge by the following comparative analysis
of the two.

"Aristotle divides all substance into the *Genus*, the *Species*,

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

and the *Individual*. The Genus is, as it were, a heap composed of many
and different seeds, from which heap all the Species are taken; and the
genus is the sufficient cause to all things that exist. For example,
'Animal' is used absolutely, not signifying any particular animal.
'Animal' does not signify a horse, an ox, or a man, but simply 'animal.'
From this abstract 'animal' all the species of animals universally
derive their origin, and this 'animal' without species is the origin of
all animals generated according to their species, and not any one thing
of things generated. Thus, *Man* is an animal, deriving his origin from
the 'animal,' and *Horse* is an animal in the same manner. Similarly all
other animals are derived from that 'animal,' who yet in itself is none
of them. If therefore that 'animal' is none of these, then, according to
Aristotle, the substance of all things that are proceeds out of things
that are non-existent, inasmuch as the 'animal,' out of which they all
proceed individually, is not one thing (or 'is nothing at all'). And
this, being Nothing, is the origin of all that *be*.

"Now substance being divided into three classes--the genus, the species,
and the individual--we have defined the genus as 'animal,' 'man' as the
species picked out of the heap of animals, but as yet undiscriminated,
and not separated into the form of a particular being. But when I define
by a special name, like Socrates, or Diogenes, a man taken from the
species (missing word?--JBH) the genus, then that being is termed the
'individual.' Thus the genus is divided into species, the species into
individual.; but the individual once being defined by name cannot be
divided any further. This is what Aristotle calls justly and properly
'Substance,' that which cannot be predicated 'of the subject,' nor 'in
the subject.' By the term 'of the subject' he means such an idea as
'animal,' which can be predicated of all the subject animals
individually--as a horse, an ox, a man--all being called by the same
name, 'animal.' Hence, what can be predicated 'of the subject' is that
which applies to many and different species indiscriminately. 'In the
subject' means that which cannot be predicated without the previous
existence of something else wherein it may exist, as 'white,' 'black,'

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'just,' 'unjust;'
which are the 'accidents' to substance, and therefore called
'qualities,' because expressing *what sort* of thing each thing is. But
no one quality can exist in itself; there must be something else for it
to exist in. If, therefore, neither the genus 'animal,' which is
predicated *of* all animals existing individually, nor 'accident,' which
is only to be found in things that exist, can either of them exist by
themselves; and if individuals are made up of these two, namely genus
and accident, then it follows that *substance*, which is made up of
these three, and nothing besides, is made up of things that are
*non-existent*.

"If, therefore, what is properly and primarily termed 'substance' (the
*Individual*) is made up of these, it is, according to Aristotle, made
up of things non-existent.

"Besides the terms Genus, Species, Individual, Substance is further
designated as 'Matter' and 'Formation.' Upon this definition rests the
Basilidan theory of the Universe. The Universe Basilides divides into
several parts: That part which extends from the earth up to the moon is
destitute of *foresight* and of *conduct*, and is content with its own
nature. The part beyond the moon is constituted with foresight, reason,
and conduct, up to the surface of heaven. This 'surface' is a *fifth*
substance, free from all the elements out of which the world was
created; this, therefore, is the 'fifth and supra-mundane substance.'
These three divisions Aristotle has treated of in three separate works:
his 'Physics,' 'Metaphysics,' and 'On the Fifth Substance.' Not merely
his ideas, but his words and terminology have been borrowed by
Basilides, and applied to the Scriptures. How, then, can his disciples,
being in reality *heathens*, expect to be benefited by Christ?

"Basilides and his true son and disciple Isidorus, assert that Matthew
(the Evangelist) revealed to them certain secret doctrines which had
been specially communicated to himself by Christ. 'There was a time when
there was Nothing; nay, not even that "Nothing" was anything of *being*,
but barely and without reserve, and without any sophism, there was
altogether Nothing. When I use the term "was," I do not mean to imply
that this Nothing *was*, but in order to explain what I wish to set
forth, I employ the expression "there *was* absolutely

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nothing." Now that
which is called "Ineffable" is not absolutely ineffable, for we
ourselves give it that name of ineffable; whereas that which is *not
even* ineffable is not "ineffable," but infinitely above every name that
can be named. Even for the Visible world, so multifarious are its
divisions that we have not names enough; but we are reduced to conceive
many of its properties from the names of the properties already named,
these (other) properties being ineffable. For an identity of names
occasions a disorder and confusion of ideas in the mind of the learner.'
(This is a direct plagiarism from Aristotle's discussion of synonyms in
his book 'On the Categories.')

"When therefore Nothing *was*--no substance, no non-substance, no
simple, no compound, no incomprehensible, no sensible, no man, no angel,
no God--when there was nothing whatever of what is called by name,
perceived by sense, conceived by the mind, but all, and even in a more
refined sense than this, being put out of the question--then this
No-being God (Aristotle's 'thought of a thought,' which Basilides alters
into his 'No-being'), without thought, without purpose, without counsel,
without passion, without desire, willed to make the world. I use the
word 'willed' merely to express my meaning, it being without thought,
without sensation, without will, that this was done; and by 'world' I do
not mean that world created afterwards and divided by latitude and
longitude, but I understand by it 'the Seed of the World.' This 'Seed of
the World' contained the *All* within itself, just as the germ of the
mustard-seed contains the root, the stalk, the leaves, the grain, the
last containing again the rudiments of others innumerable. Thus the
No-being God created the No-being world out of No-being things, when he
deposited the seed containing within itself the complete seeds of the
universe. And to give an illustration of my meaning: the egg of any bird
of diversified plumage--the peacock, for example--although itself
single, yet includes within itself the many-coloured, multifarious forms
of multifarious substances; so, in like manner, did this seed of the
world deposited by the No-being God include within itself the multiform,
multifarious seeds of the universe.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

"This seed, then, contained all things that can be named; nay more, all
things that can not be named, as yet hidden in futurity, and to come
forth after their kind by accretion, and by growth, after the manner in
which we see the new-born infant acquire his teeth, his flesh, his
father's form, and all his understanding, and all such things that come
to the child as it grows up, not apparent in him at the beginning. Now,
inasmuch as it is impossible to use the term 'projection' of the
No-being God (in fact, Basilides is opposed to all schemes of creation
by means of a 'projection'), for we must not suppose *Matter* necessary
to his operations in the same way as her threads are to the spider, or
as timber and metal to man when he sets about any work; but 'He spake
and it was made'; and this is what Moses means by his 'Let there be
light, and there was light.' Whence, then, was this light? Moses saith
not *whence* it was, but that it was from the word of the speaker; but
neither He that spoke *was*, neither *was* that which was made. The seed
of the world was this word that was spoken, 'Let there be light.' And to
this the evangelist refers by his 'And that was the true Light which
enlighteneth every man coming into the world.' For man draws his
beginning out of that seed, and is illuminated thereby." (This "seed,"
therefore, divided into infinite other seeds, is nothing else than
Aristotle's "genus," which is divided into infinite other "species," as
"animal," the genus, itself non-existent, is divided into "species," as
ox, horse, man, &c.)

"Having, therefore, got this seed for his starting-point, Basilides goes
on thus: 'Whatever I speak of as made after this, there is no need of
inquiring *out of what* it was made, seeing that this seed comprehended
within itself the principles of the All. Now let us examine what came
out of this seed in the first, second, and third place. There was in the
seed a *Sonship*, triple, of the same substance with the No-being God,
and generated by him. In this triple Sonship one part was subtile,
another gross, the third needing purification. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[\*](#fn_25) Upon the first *projecting* (emitting.md) of
the seed, the subtile element disengaged itself, ascending aloft "like a
feather or a thought,"

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

and arrived at the No-being One. For Him all Nature desireth, by reason
of the super-eminence of his beauty and perfection. The gross part
endeavoured to imitate its example, but was weighed down by its coarser
nature, and detained within the seed. To assist it, therefore, the
Sonship equips it with a *wing*, such as Plato in his "Phaedrus" wings
the soul withal. Now this wing is the Holy Ghosts which the grosser part
putting on, is both advantaged itself, and advantages the other. For the
wings of a bird are not able to fly if severed from the bird, neither
can the soul fly if separated from her wings. Such, then, is the
relationship borne by the Sonship to the Holy Ghost, and also by the
Holy Ghost to the Sonship. Soaring aloft, therefore, upon its
wings--that is, upon the Holy Ghost, this Soul Part carried its wings,
the Holy Ghost, along with it up to the No-being God, and the Sensible
Sonship, but was unable to comprehend the latter, because its own nature
is not constituted of the same substance with Him. But in the same way
as dry and pure air is repugnant to the nature of fishes, so the place,
more ineffable than the Ineffable One, and more lofty than all names
that can be named, the seat of the No-being God and of the Subtile Part,
was contrary to the nature of the Holy Ghost. On this account, the
Sonship left it near to that place which cannot be conceived by mind,
nor described by words, though. not altogether abandoned by himself, but
retaining something of his power (or essence), just as a vessel once
filled with a precious perfume ever retains traces of that perfume,
however carefully it may have been emptied. And this is manifestly like
the ointment upon the head "which ran down to Aaron's beard"--that is,
the perfume of the Sonship, brought down by the Holy Ghost even into the
impurity and degradation of mortality, out of which itself at the
beginning had soared aloft, raised by the Sonship, as it were, on
eagle's wings, being itself fastened upon his back. For all things
struggle upwards from that which is below towards that which is above,
from the "worse towards the better," whereas nothing of those above in
the better place seeks to descend below.'

"The third part of the Sonship--namely, that requiring

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

purification, remained included within the infinite *head* (or sum) of
infinite seeds, both giving and receiving benefit, in the manner
hereafter to be explained. After the first and second ascensions of the
Sonship, the Holy Ghost, which had been left above, became the
'firmament' between the world and the upper world. For Basilides divides
all things that are into two great classes, the 'world' and the 'upper
world'; the Spirit, therefore, occupying the interval between the two
(namely, the Holy Ghost, which retains the odour of the Son-ship) he
terms the 'Boundary Spirit.' Now after this firmament above the world
had been constituted, there broke forth out of the Seed of the World the
'Great Archon,' the Head of the World, or beauty, strength, magnitude
indissoluble. More ineffable is he than the Ineffable, more powerful
than the Powerful, wiser than the Wise, more beautiful than any beauty
that can be named. As soon as he was born he soared upwards and reached
the firmament, but *that* was the limit of his flight; for he knew not
of the existence of anything *beyond* the firmament, and therefore he
remained more beautiful, more powerful, more wise than any of the things
subjacent, always excepting the Sonship--that is, the Third impurified
Person--who still lay enclosed within the immense universal seed.
Imagining himself, therefore, to be Lord and Ruler and *Intelligent
Architect*, he set about the creation of the world. In the first place,
not wishing to abide alone, he generated unto himself a son out of
things subjacent (*mundane elements*), far wiser and more beautiful than
himself, for *this* son was in truth the Third Person yet left enclosed
within the seed. This thing had been predestinated by the No-being God
from the beginning; as soon as he beheld this son he was enamoured of
his perfect beauty, and bade him to sit down on his right hand. This
they call the 'Ogdoad,' the abode of the Great Archon. The great and
wise Demiurgus then made the entire *ætherial* creation, being inspired
and empowered thereto by his own son, so far above himself in wisdom."
(This idea is copied from Aristotle's "Entelechia" of the natural
organic body; the *active soul* in the body being itself wiser,
stronger, and better than the body. The theory, therefore, propounded
originally by Aristotle concerning

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

the body and the soul, Basilides thus applies to the Great Archon and
the Son whom he had created; for as the Archon creates the Son, so does
Aristotle make the soul to be the work and effect of the natural organic
body.) "All things, therefore, are ruled by the providence of the Great
Archon" (or rather, by the "Entelechia" of himself and son)--"all
things, that is to say, which lie *below* the moon, and *within* the
æther--for the moon is the division between the æther and the air.

"The creation being finished, there arose out of the seed a 'Second
Archon,' but greatly inferior to the first, yet similarly *ineffable*.
This (Archon) is designated the 'Hebdomad.' He proceeded to create all
things *below* the æther of which he is the Demiurgus; and he, in his
turn, generated a son infinitely superior to himself. The intermediate
space between the regions Ogdoad and Hebdomad is occupied by the
universal seed, the heap of species, the particles whereof are guided by
the intelligence implanted in them by the First Creator as to the
*times*, the *natures*, and the *changes* in which they have to come
forth, and possess no other guide, guardian, or creator.

"The whole creation was in this way completed, of the world and of the
things above the world; but there was yet left within the seed the
'Third Sonship,' who, in his turn, had to be developed, revealed, and to
ascend beyond the Boundary Spirit up to the Subtile Sonship and the
No-being One. *This* is the interpretation (meaning) of the Scripture:
'The whole creation groaneth and is in labour, waiting for the
manifestation of the sons of God.' These 'sons' are the *Spiritual Men*
left here below to guide and to perfect the souls that from their nature
belong to this place. 'From Adam unto Moses sin reigned'--that is to
say, the Great Archon, who had dominion up to the firmament, and
imagined that he alone was God, and that there was none other above
him--for all above him was kept in the deepest silence. *This* is the
'mystery not revealed unto the Fathers'; the Great Archon, the Ogdoad,
was, as he supposed, the Lord and Ruler of the universe. But of the
'interval,' or middle space, the Hebdomad was the ruler; now the Ogdoad
is ineffable, but the [Hebdomad](errata.htm#3.md) may be uttered by speech.
This ruler of the Hebdomad was He who spake unto Moses, saying,

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 'I am the God of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the Name of God I have not revealed unto
them'--that is, He did not reveal to them the ineffable ruler of the
Ogdoad. All the prophets who were before the Saviour's coming spoke
through the inspiration of the Second Archon.

"When the time was come for the manifestation of the Sons of God, the
Gospel came, penetrating through every power, dominion, and name that
can be named, although the Sonship did not come down from his place upon
the right hand of the Incomprehensible No-being One. But, like as Indian
naphtha kindles at the mere sight of fire a long way off, so do powers
fly up out of the seed to the Sonship that is beyond the firmament. The
son of the Great Archon of the Ogdoad thus receives, like as naphtha
catches the distant flame, the emanations of the Sonship who is beyond
the firmament; and this last, the Boundary Spirit, serves for the
communication of the thoughts from the one to the other.

"The Gospel thus came to the Great Archon through his own son, and he
was converted, and troubled, and became wise, learning his own
*ignorance* (or want of knowledge); and this is the interpretation of
'The fear of the Lord is the beginning of *wisdom*.' For the Christ,
sitting by him, instructed him concerning the Ineffable No-being One,
concerning the Son who is beyond the firmament, and concerning the
creation of the universe. The Great Archon being thus instructed, was
filled with *fear*, and confessed the *sin* he had committed in
magnifying himself; and this is the meaning of 'I acknowledge my
transgression and I confess my sin.' When, therefore, the Great Archon
was enlightened, every creature of the Ogdoad was likewise enlightened,
and then came the time for the enlightenment and evangelising of the
ruler of the Hebdomad. For this end the son of the Great Archon
communicated to the son of the Second Archon the light which he himself
had received from above, and *he* communicated his instruction to his
Father, who in like manner was convinced of, and confessed *his* sin. By
this time every creature of the Hebdomad was enlightened, and had the
Gospel preached unto them. For in this division (the region below the
æther) also, there is an infinite creation

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

of powers, principalities, and dominions (concerning whom Basilides has
a lengthy dissertation; who moreover in this region places the 365
heavens, and their ruler ABRASAX, so called because his name contains
that sum, for which reason the year consists also of that number of
days).

"After all this it was necessary that the *Unformedness* (ἀμορφία)
existing in our region that is, the Sonship still lying enclosed in the
mass like an abortion--should be enlightened in the same manner with
those aforementioned. The Light therefore passed through the Hebdomad
upon the son of the Hebdomad--that is, upon *Jesus*, the son of Mary.
This is 'the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee,' namely, the
power of *unction*, descending from the Supreme through the Demiurgus
upon the Son.

"The present constitution of things will last until every particle of
the Sonship enveloped in the unformed mass shall be attracted into
Jesus, shall be disentangled and sublimated by him, and rendered capable
of ascending by itself to the first source of Light, to which it bears a
natural affinity.

"In this way the Three Persons of the Sonship being all united once more
above the firmament, then mercy shall be shown unto the creation, 'which
languishes and groans waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God';
for all men belonging to the Sonship shall ascend up unto Him. When this
is accomplished, He will bring upon the world a *deep ignorance*, so
that all things here below shall abide in their nature, and desire
nothing contrary to their nature. By this means the souls appointed to
abide here below will be destitute of even the slightest notion of
anything existing above them, lest they should be tormented by the
fruitless desire of ascending up into the same; like as though a *fish*
should desire to pasture with the flocks upon the hills, a wish which,
if gratified, would be its destruction. For all things are *eternal* so
long as they continue in their natural place, but become *mortal* when
they endeavour to escape beyond it. The same *ignorance* will envelop
the ruler of the Hebdomad, in order that sorrow and grief and confusion
may flee away from him; that he may no longer be troubled with the
desire of things above him and contrary to

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

his nature. This ignorance shall also come over the Great Archon of the
Ogdoad, and over all creatures subject unto him, and for the same
reason. This is the 'restoration of all things; enclosed from the
beginning within the seed, and disposed according to its season. This is
the Saviour's meaning in 'My hour is not yet come'; it is also signified
by the Magi beholding the star, inasmuch as His coming, proclaimed from
the beginning, was subject to the disposition of the stars. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[\*](#fn_26.md)

"The Gospel is the *Declaration* of supramundane things, which the Great
Archon knew not of. But when it was told him of the Sonship, of the
Boundary Spirit, and of the No-being God, he rejoiced with an exceeding
great joy. With respect to the birth of Jesus, all things came to pass
as they are written in the Gospels. For *He* was the firstfruits of the
division of the classes, previously all commingled here below. Now, as
the world is distributed into the Ogdoad, the head of the universe,
whose chief is the Great Archon, and into the Hebdomad, whose chief is
the Demiurgus, chief also of our degree where Frailty (liability to
error) subsists, it was necessary that this Confusion should be
distributed and set in order by Jesus. That part of hint, therefore,
which was of the 'Unformedness,' namely, his body suffered what it did
suffer and returned again into unformedness; that part which belonged to
the Hebdomad, namely, his soul, returned again into the Hebdomad after
his resurrection; the part belonging to the Ogdoad remained with the
Great Archon, and the part belonging to the Boundary Spirit was left
there in his ascension. But the third Sonship, thus purified in his
passage upwards, was reunited to the Blessed Sonship who is supreme
above. (In short, the whole theory of the religion consists in the
*Confusion* of the Seed-heap, its *Redistribution* into classes, and the
*Restoration* of all things to their natural places. This division of
the classes was made in the first instance by Jesus, and the sole object
of his passion was the restoration of the classes, which were mixed up
together, into their proper order. And for this reason Jesus himself was

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

*distributed* as we have shown, amongst the several classes. These then
are the things that Basilides fables, who taught in Egypt, and, having
learned his wisdom *from the Egyptians* brought forth such fruits as
these.)"

This concluding remark of Hippolytus deserves particular notice; it
shows that he regarded the Basilidan theory as the mere *adaptation* to
present requirements of an ancient esoteric doctrine belonging to the
Egyptian priesthood. That it was nothing more than a plagiarism from the
Aristotelian philosophy, as the learned Father labours to demonstrate
with so much ingenuity, appears to me by no means made out. But the
Basilidan theory has one striking feature that distinguishes it from
every other form of the Gnosis, in its entirely ignoring the existence
of an *Evil Principle*, or of malignity and rebellion against the
Supreme God. His two rulers of the upper and lower worlds, the Great
Archon of the Ogdoad, and the Demiurgus of the Hebdomad, so far from
opposing the Gospel receive it with joy, and humbly acknowledge their
inferiority to the sender. The Passion of Jesus is not due to the malice
of either of them, but is voluntary, and undertaken as the sole means of
restoring confused elements of the All to the *harmony* indispensable
for their *eternal* duration. Even the final withdrawing of the Divine
Light from the Ogdoad and Hebdomad is done for the same beneficent
purpose, in order that both they and their greatness may rest for ever
in blissful ignorance, each holding himself supreme in his own creation,
and knowing of nothing above it, may no longer be tormented by vain
aspirations after a state of perfection for which his nature is not
adapted. The benevolent spirit that pervades the whole theory strongly
supports the assertion of Hippolytus, and points out for its source the
Egyptian mythology, to which the notion of two principles, equal in
power but antagonistic in nature, would have been unutterably shocking.
