<p>1. Abraxas, represented here with the head of an <i>ass</i>, and thereby identified with Typhon, a singular perversion of ancient ideas. This gem is valuable as distinctly declaring its purpose by the legend on the</p>

<p>reverse, &#0934;&#0903;?Y&#0923;(&#0966;&#8059;&#0955;&#0945;&#0963;&#0963;&#0949;), "Defend me," addressed to the Power depicted upon it; and thus putting out of doubt the destruction of all the other specimens of its class.</p>  
<p>2. Abraxas, of neat work and early date, not later than the fourth century.</p>  
<p>3. The Giant Typhoeus defying Jove: his <i>serpent</i>-legs denote that he is the son of Mother Earth. This beautiful intaglio, which is of Italo-Greek workmanship, and found at Cum&aelig;, is introduced here merely to show the source whence the sectaries of the Decline borrowed the idea of similar combinations of discordant natures. (Burnt sard: New York.)</p>  
<p>4. Abraxas, with whip and shield, combining his influence with <i>Horus</i>, seated on the lotus, the regular personification of the Vernal Sun. The meaning of the type is set forth in the legend, which is the Greek transliteration of the Hebrew <i>Shemesh Ilam</i>, "Sun of the Universe." The union of the two types indicates that Abraxas is here to be understood in his original sense, the simple personification of the Solar Power.</p>
