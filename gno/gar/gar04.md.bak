# THE GNOSTICS AND THEIR REMAINS.

### GNOSTICISM AND ITS ORIGIN.

THE general name "Gnostics" is used to designate several widely
differing sects, which sprang up in the Eastern provinces of the Roman
Empire almost simultaneously with the first planting of Christianity.
That is to say, these sects then for the first time assumed a definite
form, and ranged themselves under different teachers, by whose names
they became known to the world, although in all probability their main
doctrines had made their appearance previously in many of the cities of
Asia Minor. There, it is probable, these sectaries first came into
definite existence under the title of "Mystae," upon the establishment
of a direct intercourse with India and her Buddhist philosophers, under
the Seleucidae and the Ptolemies.

The term "Gnosticism" is derived from the Greek, *Gnosis*, knowledge--a
word specially employed from the first dawn of religious inquiry to
designate the science of things divine. Thus Pythagoras, according to
Diogenes Laertius, called the transcendental portion of his philosophy,
Γνῶσις τῶν ὄντοων, "the knowledge of things that are." And in later
times Gnosis was the name given to what Porphyry calls the Antique or
Oriental philosophy, to distinguish it from the Grecian systems. But the
term was first used (as Matter on good grounds conjectures) in its
ultimate sense of supernal and celestial knowledge, by the Jewish
philosophers belonging to the celebrated school of that nation,
flourishing at Alexandria. These teachers, following the example of a
noted Rabbi, Aristobulus, surnamed the *Peripatician*, endeavoured to
make out that all the wisdom of the Greeks was derived immediately from
the Hebrew

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Scripture; and by
means of their well-known mode of allegorical interpretation, which
enabled them to elicit any sense desired out of any given passage of the
Old Testament, they sought, and often succeeded, in establishing their
theory. In this way they showed that Plato, during his sojourn in Egypt,
had been *their own* scholar; and still further to support these
pretensions, the indefatigable Aristobulus produced a string of poems in
the names of Linus, Orpheus, Homer, and Hesiod--all strongly impregnated
with the spirit of Judaism. But *his* Judaism was a very different thing
from the simplicity of the Pentateuch. A single, but very
characteristic, production, of this *Jewish* Gnosis has come down to our
times. This is the "Book of Enoch" (v. [p. 18](gar05.htm#page_18).md), of
which the main object is to *make known* the description of the heavenly
bodies and the *true names* of the same, as revealed to the Patriarch by
[the](errata.htm#1.md) angel Uriel. This profession betrays, of itself, the
Magian source whence its inspiration was derived. Many Jews,
nevertheless, accepted it as a divine revelation; even the Apostle Jude
scruples not to quote it as of genuine Scriptural authority. The
"Pistis-Sophia," attributed to the Alexandrian heresiarch Valentinus (so
important a guide in the following inquiry), perpetually refers to it
as: The highest source of knowledge, as being dictated by Christ
Himself, "speaking out of the Tree of Life unto ΙΕΟϒ, the Primal Man."
Another Jewish-Gnostic Scripture of even greater interest (inasmuch as
it is the "Bible" of the only professed Gnostic sect that has maintained
its existence to the present day, the Mandaites of Bassora) is their
textbook, the "Book of Adam." Its doctrines and singular application of
Zoroastrism to Jewish tenets, present frequent analogies to those of the
Pistis-Sophia, in its continual reference to the ideas of the "Religion
of Light," of which full particulars will be given when the latter
remarkable work comes to be considered (see [p. 14](gar05.htm#page_14).md).
"Gnosticism," therefore, cannot receive a better definition than in that
dictum of the sect first and specially calling itself "Gnostics," the
*Naaseni* (translated by the Greeks into "Ophites"), viz., "the
beginning of perfection is the knowledge of man, but absolute perfection
is the knowledge of God." And to give a general view of the nature of

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

the entire system, nothing that I can do will serve so well as to
transcribe the exact words of a learned and very acute writer upon the
subject of Gnosticism ("Christian Remembrancer," for 1866).

"Starting, then, from this point, we ask what Gnosticism is, and what it
professes to teach. What is the peculiar *Gnosis* that it claims to
itself? The answer is, the knowledge of God and of Man, of the Being and
Providence Of the former, and of the creation and destiny of the latter.
While the ignorant and superstitious were degrading the glory of the
incorruptible God into an image made with hands, and were changing 'the
truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather
than the Creator,' the ancient Gnostics held purer and truer ideas. And
when these corrupted and idolatrous forms of religion and worship became
established, and were popularly regarded as true and real in themselves,
the 'Gnostics' held and secretly taught an *esoteric* theology of which
the popular creed of multitudes of deities, with its whole ritual of
sacrifice and worship, was but the exoteric form. Hence all the
mysteries which almost, if not all, the heathen religions possessed.
Those initiated into these mysteries, whilst they carefully maintained
and encouraged the gorgeous worship, sacrifices and processions of the
national religion, and even openly taught polytheism and the efficacy of
the public rites, yet secretly held something very different--at the
first, probably, a purer creed, but in course of time, like the exoteric
form, degenerating. The progress of declination differed according to
race or habit of thought: in the East it tended to superstition, in the
West (as we learn from the writings of Cicero) to pure atheism, a denial
of Providence. This system was adopted likewise by the Jews, but with
this great difference, that it was superinduced upon and applied to a
pre-existent religion; whereas in the other Oriental religions, the
external was added to the esoteric, and developed out of it. In the
Oriental systems the external was the sensuous expression of a hidden
meaning; in the Jewish, the hidden meaning was drawn out of pre-existing
external laws and ritual; in the former the esoteric alone was claimed
as divine, in the latter it was the exoteric which was a matter

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

of revelation. To repair this seeming defect, the Kabbalists, or
teachers of the 'Hidden Doctrine,' invented the existence of a secret
tradition, orally handed down from the time of Moses. We may, of course,
reject this assertion, and affirm that the Jews learnt the idea of a
Hidden Wisdom, underlying the Mosaic Law, from their intercourse with
the Eastern nations during the Babylonian captivity; and we may further
be assured that the origin of this Secret Wisdom is Indian. Perhaps we
shall be more exact if we say that the Jews learnt from their
intercourse with Eastern nations to investigate the external Divine Law,
for the purpose of discovering its hidden meaning. The heathen Gnostics,
in fact, collected a Gnosis from every quarter, accepted all religious
systems as partly true, and extracted from each what harmonized with
their ideas. The Gospel, widely preached, accompanied by miracles,
having new doctrines and enunciating new truths, very naturally
attracted their attention. The Kabbalists, or Jewish Gnostics, like
Simon Magus, found a large portion of apostolic teaching in accordance
with their own, and easily grafted upon it so much as they liked. Again
the Divine power of working miracles possessed by the Apostles and their
successors naturally attracted the interest of those whose chief mystery
was the practice of magic. Simon the Magician was considered by the
Samaritans to be 'the great Power of God;' he was attracted by the
miracles wrought by the Apostles; and no doubt he sincerely 'believed,'
that is, after his own fashion. His notion of Holy Baptism was probably
an initiation into a new mystery with a higher Gnosis than he possessed
before, and by which he hoped to be endued with higher powers; and so
likewise many of those who were called Gnostic Heretics by the Christian
Fathers were not Christians at all, only they adopted so much of the
Christian doctrine as accorded with their system."

The consideration of the local and political circumstances of the grand
foci of Gnosticism will serve to explain much that is puzzling in the
origin and nature of the system itself. *Ephesus* was, after Alexandria,
the most important meeting-point of Grecian culture and Oriental
speculation. In regard to

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

commerce and riches, although she yielded to the Egyptian capital, yet
she rivalled Corinth in both, which city in truth she far surpassed in
her treasures of religion and science. Her richness in theosophic ideas
and rites had from time immemorial been manifested in her possession of
Diana, "whom all Asia and the world" worshipped--that pantheistic figure
so conformable to the genius of the furthest East; her College of
"Essenes" dedicated to the service of that goddess; and her "Megabyzae,"
whose name sufficiently declares their Magian institution. Hence, also,
was supplied the talisman of highest repute in the antique world, the
far-famed "Ephesian spell," those mystic words graven upon the zone and
feet of the "image that fell down from Jupiter;" and how zealously magic
was cultivated by her citizens is apparent from St. Luke's incidental
notice of the cost of the books belonging to those that used "curious
arts" (τὰ περίεργα, the regular name for sorcery and divination),
destroyed by their owners in the first transports of conversion to a new
faith. Such converts, indeed, after their early zeal had cooled down,
were not likely to resist the allurements of the endeavour to reconcile
their ancient, far-famed wisdom with the new revelation; in short, to
follow the plan invented not long before by the Alexandrian Jew, in his
reconciliation of Plato with Moses and the Prophets. "In Ephesus," says
Matter, "the speculations of the Jewish-Egyptian school, and the
Semi-Persian speculations of the Kabbala, had then recently come to
swell the vast conflux of Grecian and Asiatic doctrines; so there is no
wonder that teachers should have sprung up there, who strove to combine
the religion newly preached by the Apostle with the ideas so long
established in the place. As early as the year A.D. 58, St. Paul, in his
First Epistle to Timothy, enjoins him to warn certain persons to abstain
from teaching 'strange doctrines,' those myths and interminable
genealogies that only breed division. These same 'myths and genealogies'
apply, without any doubt, to the theory of the Emanation of the
Æons-Sephiroth, and to all the relations between the Good and Bad Angels
that the Kabbalists had borrowed from the religion of Zoroaster."

Again, after condemning certain doctrines concerning the

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

obligation to complete asceticism, adopted literally from the Essenes,
the Apostle adds, "Keep safe the precious charge entrusted to thee,
avoiding profane novelties and the antitheses of the *knowledge*,
falsely so-called, of which some making profession have gone astray from
the faith of Christ." It was assuredly *not* the mere fables by which
the new converts sought to enrich and complete the Christian doctrine
(such as we still have samples of in the childish, though pious fictions
of the Apocryphal Gospels), such things as these were certainly not the
"false knowledge," which set itself up against the "true knowledge,"
that is, Revelation itself, as something superior to that Revelation. It
must, on the contrary, have been a doctrine professing to make a
*science* out of the Christian faith, and that, too, a *science*
founding its principles upon *antitheses*. Now what are these
"antitheses" (or oppositions) but the teaching of the Zendavesta,
concerning the two Empires of Light and Darkness; the two grand classes
of Intelligences, the good and the evil spirits, and the perpetual
combat going on between them? Now these antitheses, or the principle of
Dualism, is that which forms the most conspicuous feature of the Gnostic
scheme; and in the Apostle's words we trace one of the most obvious ways
in which such doctrines were communicated, and how they insinuated
themselves into the infant Church.

In fact, the ancient commentators, Theodoret and Chrysostom, who were
thoroughly conversant with the Gnosticism of their own day, apply this
passage of St. Paul to that actual precursor of Gnosticism, his
indefatigable rival Simon Magus himself, whose curious tenets had by
that time been widely diffused throughout Asia Minor.

So deeply rooted were such speculations in the minds of many of the
Ephesians, that the Apostle, in his Second Epistle to Timothy, written
six years later, returns perpetually to the subject, whilst in his
Epistle to the Church at Ephesus he entreats his flock not to be seduced
by "vain discourses," or "new-coined appellations" (as one reading has
it, and which applies forcibly to the Gnostic nomenclature), nor by
human doctrines that have no more solidity in themselves than the

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

wind, whereof no one knows whence it cometh, or whither it goeth. Nay
more, he even employs the very terminology of Gnosticism, as when he
says, "Ye were dead in error and in sins: ye walked according to the
*Æon* of this world, according to the *Archon* who has the dominion of
the air," that is, the Demiurgus Ildabaoth. Here we have the Devs of
Zoroaster, whose hosts fill the air, deceive mankind, blind their
understandings, and lead them into temptation. Again when he adds, "We
war not against flesh and blood, but against the *Dominions*, the
*Powers*, the *Lords* of the *Darkness*, the malevolence of the
*Spirits* in the upper regions"--all these are regular Gnostic epithets,
having also their place in the Kabbalistic theology. The later
Gnosticism is, in fact, as Chiflet has well expressed it, "the spirit of
Asiatic antiquity seeking to assert its empire over the soul of Man by
insinuating itself into the Christian Church." The Ophites, even in the
early times of Hippolytus, boasted that they of all men were the only
real Christians, because they alone *comprehended* the *real* nature of
the Saviour. At the same time, they diligently attended the celebration
of all the ancient Mysteries, notably the Eleusinian and the Phrygian,
declaring that through their *knowledge* they had gotten the key to the
hidden meaning of the whole ceremonial, which by types and figures
foreshadowed the coming of the Christ. But indeed, Gnosticism, in its
primitive form, had almost supplanted, by spiritualizing it, the
beautiful materialism of the early Greek and Latin mythologies.
Catholicism, through its unity and greater simplicity, in the end
triumphed over the conflicting Gnostic philosophies, which became
extinct as a *professed* religion in the sixth century, so far as Europe
was concerned, and whose relics in Asia were at the same moment covered
over with impenetrable obscurity by the sudden deluge of the Mahommedan
conquest. Nevertheless, even in the first-named scene of its domination,
it was not to be eradicated without leaving behind it deep traces in the
writings and symbolisms of the magicians, astrologers, and seekers after
the *grand arcanum* throughout the whole course of the Middle Ages. Thus
there is a passage in Dante (Paradiso, xviii.) replete with the
profoundest symbolism, and which, of course, our Freemasons claim for
their

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

own, and *that* with all possible security, because the very nature of
the assumption exempts them from being called upon to publish the
interpretation of the mystery. The poet here tells how the *five* times
*seven* letters making up the *five* words "Diligite justitiam qui
judicatis terram" came forth in the star Jupiter, when the beatified
spirits of just princes hovered over the final M, forming their hosts
into the figure of an eagle. Certainly the importance given to the
numerals *five* and *seven* in this revelation savours much of Gnostic
phraseology, and reminds one of the thirty letters which make up the
quadrisyllabic Name of God, as made known by Truth unto the heresiarch
Marcus, the history of which shall be given in the fitting place. Dante
had before (Canto vi.) spoken of the "awe that overcomes him before the
B and I C E," evidently the initials of some mighty password, although
his commentators most prosaically interpret them as the mere diminutive
of the name of his lost love, Beatrice. It was to its connection with
Gnosticism that primitive Christianity owed the accusation of being a
*Magical* system--a superstition not only *nova* but *malefica*. There
is a curious passage in Dio Cassius, where, mentioning how the Christian
Legion in M. Aurelius’ Quadian War obtained rain from Heaven through
their prayers, he remarks, "The Christians can bring about anything they
desire through prayer." In later times the various factions within the
Church were fond of retorting upon each other this ancient aspersion of
the pagans: it was on the charge of magical practices, says Ammianus,
that the Arians managed to depose and exile the great Athanasius
himself.

The history of Gnosticism, written by its contemporaries, still forms a
copious library, despite the losses and damages it has sustained through
the injuries of time. In the carrying out of the chief object of the
present work--the elucidation of the *tangible* remains of the
Gnosis--no historical record has yielded me by any means so much service
as "The Refutation of all Heresies," composed by *Hippolytus*, bishop of
Ostia (Portus), early in the third century. Many points, hitherto
seeming hopelessly enveloped in darkness, have been made clear by the
careful perusal of his judicious summaries of the systems

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

of the different gnostic apostles. His views of their doctrines are
evidently drawn up with equal candour and intelligence, and fully bear
out his declaration, "that his design was not to vilify the holders of
such doctrines, but merely to make known the sources whence they had
really derived their pretended revelation." And he keeps his word
throughout, never once indulging, like the later controversialists, in
invectives against asserted *practices*, but exhibiting the tenets only
of his opponents, and, with much ingenuity, showing up their gross
plagiarism from Pagan philosophy. His eagerness for discovering the
latter source in the fount of every gnostic stream, sometimes leads him
to detect relationship that does not actually exist, and still oftener
to pronounce a recent *copy* of the other what was in reality drawn
directly from the same Oriental prototype--true origin of the old Greek
idea with which he identifies it. But this invaluable, as well as most
interesting, treatise breathes all through that spirit of charity and
forbearance that made a writer belonging to a still persecuted religion,
happy to be allowed to subsist through the tolerance of its neighbours.
The abuse and scurrilous tales in which the later Epiphanius revels
sufficiently indicate the writer belonging to an established Church,
able at length to call in the secular power to assist in convincing all
adversaries of their errors by the unanswerable arguments of rack, rope
and faggot.

*Irenaeus*, a Gaul by birth, and disciple of Polycarp, himself a
disciple of St. John, was elected Bishop of Lyon in the year 174. In
that city he composed his great treatise generally styled "Five Books
against Heresies," written in an easy and indeed elegant style, although
in one place he excuses its rudeness by the fact of his having been
forced during so many years to converse "in a barbarous language"--a
remark of interest as showing that *Celtic* still remained the vulgar
tongue in his diocese. He is supposed to have died soon after the year
A.D. 200; and therefore is somewhat earlier than Hippolytus, who was put
to death in A.D. 222, and whose "Refutation" was clearly written after
the death of Irenæus, for he quotes him occasionally by the title ὁ
μακάριος, "the deceased"; and has incorporated some entire chapters
respecting Marcus in his own work.

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

The great *Origen*, another contemporary, has given some important
details concerning the religious systems of the Ophites in his
celebrated "Reply to Celsus." Two centuries after him comes *Theodoret*,
Bishop of Cyrrhus, in Syria, during the second quarter of the fifth
century, who has left very full particulars respecting the great Gnostic
school flourishing in that region. The other Christian writers who have
treated upon the origin and nature of the same doctrines were nothing
more than ignorant churchmen, able to discern nothing in any religion
beyond its external forms, and which they construed in the darkest
possible sense, ever seeking for the worst interpretation of which these
external appearances were susceptible. At the head of this latter class
stands *Epiphanius*, author of the most detailed and, from its furious
partisanship, amusing account of the Gnostic sects that is extant--his
vast *Panarion*, "Breadbasket," or rather "Scrap-basket," a whimsical
title intended to express the motley nature of its contents, picked up
from all quarters. This immense folio (admirably translated into elegant
Latin by the learned Petavius) is of the highest interest, full of
pictures of the struggles of the human mind to devise for itself a
*revelation* that shall plausibly solve all the problems of Man's other
nature. Its compiler lived as Bishop of Salamis in Cyprus A.D. 367-403,
and displays great zeal in raking up all manner of scandalous stories
against the enemies of his adoptive Church. But there is one thing that
gives immense value to his labours, the minute account given of
Manichæism--that latest and grandest development of the Gnosis, which
had come into existence in the interval between Epiphanius and
Hippolytus.

The rule observed by all *these later* historians of Gnosticism is to
represent it as a mere spurious offshoot and corruption of Christianity;
invented, usually out of disappointed ambition, by apostates from the
true faith established by the several apostles in the Eastern provinces
of the Empire--a mode of representing the system than which nothing can
be more unfounded. For in its earliest shape, such as it shows itself in
the doctrine of Simon Magus, or of Basilides, the heaven-sent
*knowledge* merely added upon the old foundations such articles and
terms of the Christian faith as seemed capable of being

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

assimilated to and combined therewith, whilst on the other hand she
availed herself of the machinery of the older paganism to elucidate and
prove the mysteries of the new theosophy; and this was conspicuously the
character of the systems of Justinus and of the Peratae; as the very
curious extracts given by Hippolytus from their text-books exhibit to
the astonishment of the modern reader. That sagacious controversialist
was right in calling all these heresies nothing better than the old
philosophies disguised under new names; his only error lay in not going
back far enough to find their ultimate source. Basilides, for example,
never professed Christianity (in fact, Tertullian calls him a
Platonist), but he superadded upon the esoteric doctrines of the
Egyptian priesthood the newly-imported notions of Buddhism--that
probable source of so much that is strange in the Gnosis. The
introduction of the religion of Buddha into Egypt and Palestine, a fact
only recently discovered, yet substantiated by strong monumental
testimony, affords the best solution for innumerable difficulties in the
history of religion; but the circumstances relating to this very
important question must be reserved for a separate chapter.

As for the actual TEXT-BOOKS of the Gnostics, which in their day formed
so immense a library (every founder of a sect being, as if by
obligation, a most prolific writer, as Hippolytus shows by the number of
works he quotes), hunted up and carefully destroyed by the victorious
orthodox, never perpetuated by transcripts after the sectaries became
extinct, all have perished, leaving one sole specimen to attest their
nature. But this survivor is of a character so wild and wondrous, that
had fortune left it to our choice we could not have preserved a more
characteristic representative of its class. This is the *Pistis-Sophia*,
"Faith-Wisdom," a work to be perpetually quoted in the following pages,
as it throws more light upon the actual monuments of Gnosticism than
could hitherto be collected from all the other writers on the subject
put together. On this account a brief summary of its contents will be
the best introduction to our inquiry into the nature of the system.
