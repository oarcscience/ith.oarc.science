### Diffusion of Oriental Culture

The constant intercourse between Syria and Europe, maintained first by
the flocks of pilgrims perpetually crowding to Jerusalem, then by the
Crusades, and lastly by the establishment of the Frankish kingdom in
Palestine, and of the different principalities upon the coast, produced
vast effects, both apparent and concealed, upon the nations of Europe,
more especially those seated upon the Mediterranean. Arabian influence
brightly manifests itself in the poetry of the Troubadours,
half-amatory, half-mystical like its model, of a spirit differing as
widely from the materialism of classic elegiacs, as does the pointed
"Saracenic"

architecture, with all its forms suggested by the tentpole and curtain,
from the massive Romanesque which it so rapidly displaced. Of poetry and
architecture alike the germs had been carried into France by the causes
already noticed, and kept in full vigour by the permanent establishment
of the two great military orders having their headquarters in Jerusalem,
but looking principally to France for recruits and resources. For the
Crusades were eminently a French *idée*, and both leaders and soldiers
in the most important of them, were either actual Frenchmen or princes
holding territories in France--our Norman kings for example. How many
arts, the most admired in those ages, are direct importations from Syria
or Egypt! Glass-working in all its processes connected with the
manufacture of ornamental and coloured vessels, and painted windows,
enamelling, majolica, damascening on steel, the coinage of gold, the
cultivation of the silkworm. The Italian language has preserved this
history in the terms, purely Arabic, still designating things pertaining
to all such processes, as *zecca*, *tazza*, *cameo*, *mantece*, *rocca*,
*gala*, *pataca*, *ricamare*, &c. Italian Gothic, particularly its civil
branch, as exemplified in the buildings of the great maritime cities on
the Mediterranean (those on the Adriatic continued faithful to the
Byzantine taste), such as Genoa, Pisa, Florence, is a mere transcript of
Cairo and Rosetta; to the latest days of the style bearing no
resemblance to the Gothic then flourishing beyond the Alps.

This diffusion of Oriental ideas over Europe has a very important
bearing upon the present inquiry, for it explains the readiness with
which Manicheism was embraced in France during the two centuries
preceding the fall of the Templars. These very Templars are found during
their residence in Palestine exhibiting a tolerant spirit, utterly
inconsistent with the ostensible object of their institution; making
alliances with any of the neighbouring Emirs able to assist them in
holding their own against the common enemy, the Soldan of Egypt; amongst
whom figures conspicuously that arch-Gnostic, the redoubtable "Old Man
of the Mountain." <span id="fr_256"></span>[\*](#fn_254.md)

<span id="fn_254"></span>[418:\*](gar65.htm#fr_256.md) His practice of
intoxicating the neophyte with *hashish* (extract of hemp) before
admission into his terrestrial paradise, gave the sect the name,
afterwards accepted by the Italians in its present opprobrious sense.
