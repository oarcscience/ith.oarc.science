### THE CAUSE OF SIN.

(Pist.--Soph. 282). "And when the Saviour had spoken these things, he
continuing in his discourse said unto Mary: Now, therefore Mary, hear
concerning the thing whereof thou askest of me, Who is it that
constraineth man to commit sin?" Now therefore when (the parents) have
begotten the child, when there exists in him a small *power*, and a
small soul, and a small "counterfeit of the spirit" (conscience); <span
id="fr_206"></span>[\*](#fn_204.md) in a word, all the three in him being
small together. No one of them understandeth anything at all, whether it
be good or evil, by reason of the weight of the heavy oblivion (of the
former life) that holdeth them; the body likewise being small. And the
child eateth of the meats of the world of the Rulers. And the soul
gathereth to itself out of the portion of the soul that is concealed in
these meats, and the Counterfeit of the spirit gathereth to itself out
of the portion of evil that resideth in the meats and in the lusts
thereof; the body, likewise, gathereth the insensible *Matter* that is
in the meats. But the *Fate* herself taketh not out of the meats,
inasmuch as she is not mixed up with them, but in what shape she came
into the world, in the same she continueth. And little by little, the
power, the soul, and the counterpart of the spirit grow to their full
stature, and each one thereof is sensible after its own kind. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[†](#fn_205.md) The power is sensible to seek after the
Light above; the soul is sensible to seek after the place of
Righteousness of the mixture, which same is the place of

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

confusion; the counterfeit of the spirit also seeketh after all
wickedness and lusts and sins; and the body is sensible to nothing save
how it may draw strength out of Matter, thus the three are forthwith
sensible, each one according to its own nature, and the contentious ones
(ἐριδαῖοι) also send ministers who shall follow them in order to bear
witness against all the sins that they may commit, to regulate the
manner in which they shall punish them when they come up for judgment,
the counterfeit of the spirit also thinks upon and is sensible to all
the sins and the evils that come near to that soul, which proceedeth
from the Rulers of the Great Fate, and bringeth them into the
soul. <span id="fr_208"></span>[\*](#fn_206.md) But the inner power seeketh
after the Place of Light, and all the godhead, whilst the counterfeit of
the spirit turneth the soul awry, and constraineth it to work all its
own unlawful deeds, and all its passions, and all its wickedness
continually; and it abideth a different creature from the soul, and is
an enemy to the soul, and causeth it to commit all these sins and
wickednesses; and also stirreth up the ministers of contention, to bear
witness against the sins that it is about to cause the soul to commit.
And it cometh to pass that it resteth not day or night, and it troubleth
the soul in dreams and in the lusts of this world, and maketh it to lust
after all the things of this world; in a word, it urgeth the soul to do
all the things that the Rulers have laid before it, and it is at war
with the soul, contriving that it shall do the things it would not. Now
therefore *this* is the enemy of the soul and constraineth it to do all
kinds of sins; and when it comes to pass that the time of that man is
accomplished, then cometh his Fate, which driveth that man unto the
death appointed him by the Rulers, and by means of the bonds wherewith
men are tied by Destiny. Then come the contentious Receivers to conduct
that soul out of the body; and after that these Receivers go about with
the soul through all the regions shewing unto it the Æons of the
world, <span id="fr_209"></span>[†](#fn_207.md) whilst the counterfeit of
the spirit and fate follow after that soul: but the power 

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

that was in it goes up unto the Virgin of Light. And after those three
days the Receivers lead that soul down from above into the hell of
Chaos, they deliver it unto the tormentors (and. the Receivers return
again into their own places), who punish the same according to the
measure of its sins as ordained by the Archons for the discharge of
souls. And the counterfeit of the spirit becomes the guard over the
soul, appointed over it, convicting it, in one place of punishment after
the other, of the sins which it hath committed, and it leadeth the soul
into the region of the Archons of the Middle space. And when it hath
arrived in their presence, they lead it unto the Mysteries of Fate, and
if they find them not (sealed upon the soul), they seek after their own
share; and those Archons punish the soul according to its sins,
according to its deserts; of those punishments I will declare the form
unto you in the 'Emanation of the Universe.' But after it has come to
pass that the time of the soul's different punishments is accomplished
in the prisons of the Archons of the Middle-space, then the counterfeit
of the spirit leadeth the soul upwards out of all their regions, and
bringeth it before. the light of the Sun, according to the commandment
of the *Primal Man* <span id="fr_210"></span>[\*](#fn_208.md) <span
id="img_35100"></span> ![ΙΕΟΥ](img/35100.jpg.md), and bringeth it before
the judge, the Virgin of Light. And she trieth that soul; and in case
she shall find it to be sinful, she planteth within the same (a particle
of) the power of her own light, according unto its station in life, its
body, and its share of sensibility. Then the Virgin of Light putteth her
seal upon that soul and delivereth it unto one of her Receivers, who
will see that it be placed in a body befitting the sins that it hath
committed (in a former life). And verily I say unto you she shall not
let the soul be released from the changes of its bodies (various
metempsychoses), until it shall have accomplished its uttermost cycle in
the shapes whereof it may be deserving; of all which I will tell you the
form, and likewise the form of the several bodies into which they shall
place the souls, according to the sins of each.

"But if it be a soul that hath not obeyed the counterfeit of the spirit
in all its doings, but is righteous, and hath received the mysteries of
Light that be in the First Court, or those that be in the

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Second Court, or
those in the Third which is the innermost part (*adytum*)--when the time
of that soul in the body is accomplished, and when the counterfeit of
the spirit followeth after that soul, together with fate, whilst the
soul is on the road that leadeth on high, and before it is far distant
therefrom, it uttereth the mystery for the breaking <span
id="fr_211"></span>[\*](#fn_209.md) of all the *seals* and all the bonds of
the counterfeit of the spirit wherewith the Archons have bound it unto
the soul. And it having uttered those words, the bonds of the
counterfeit of the spirit are loosed so that it ceaseth to persecute
that soul, and lets it go according to the commandment given unto it by
the Archons of the Great Fate, who said unto it: Let not that soul go
free, unless it shall utter unto thee the mystery for the breaking of
the bonds wherewith we have bound thee unto it. Thereupon the soul, thus
set free, leaves fate behind unto the Archons of the way of the
Middle-space, and destroys the counterfeit of the spirit leaving it for
the Archons in the place wherein they had bound it (at first) unto the
soul; and in that moment it becometh a great flood of light, shining
exceedingly; and the Receivers who had fetched it out of the body are
afraid of that light, so that they fall down upon their faces, and the
soul is made as it were a *wing* <span id="fr_212"></span>[†](#fn_210.md)
*of light*, and passeth through all the regions of the Archons, and
through all the courses of the Light, until it entereth into the place
of its own kingdom for which it hath received the mystery.

"But if it be a soul that hath received the mystery in the First Court,
which is the outer part, and after receiving and performing the mystery
and being converted shall again have sinned, and when its time in the
body is accomplished, and the Receivers come to fetch it, and the
counterfeit of the spirit and fate pursue it by reason of the seals and
bonds wherewith it hath been bound together with them by the
Archons--then if the soul whilst yet in the way of its pursuers should
utter the mystery that breaketh those seals and bonds, forthwith they
are all loosed and the counterfeit of the spirit ceases to follow after
the

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

soul. And the soul leaves its pursuers behind, for none of them have
their own power, but the soul keeps its own power. Then the Receivers
that belong to the mystery which the soul hath received come and snatch
it away from the contentious Receivers, and these return to do the
business of the Archons in the occupation of fetching away souls. But
the Receivers of the soul, who pertain to the Light, themselves become a
wing of light to that soul, and a vesture of light unto it. And they
lead it not into Chaos, because it is not lawful to lead a soul, that
hath obtained the mysteries, into Chaos; but they bring it into the road
of the Archons of the Middle-space. And when they are come before the
Archons of the Middle-space, the Archons depart out of the way of that
soul, being in great fear, and in cruel burning, and in divers shapes,
in a word being in great fear unto which there is no measure. And in
that moment the soul utters the mystery of its defence before them; and
they fall upon their faces out of fear of the mystery and of the defence
which it hath uttered. And the soul leaves with them their *fate*, <span
id="fr_213"></span>[\*](#fn_211.md) saying unto them: Take to yourselves
your fate, I am not coming into your place from henceforth, I am made a
stranger unto you for ever, I am coming into the place of my own
inheritance. And after the soul hath said this, the Receivers of the
Light fly away with it on high, and bring it before the Æons of Destiny,
giving it the proper speech of defence for the place and the *seals*
thereof, and the soul shews to them the counterfeit of the spirit and
utters the mystery that sundereth the bonds wherewith they had bound
them both together, saying to them: Take to yourselves your counterfeit
of the spirit, henceforth I come not in your place, I am made a stranger
unto you for ever. And it shews them the *seal* of each and the form of
defence. Then the Receivers fly away with the soul and bring it through
all the Æons, she wing the seal, and the defence, in all the regions of
King Adamas, and of all the Rulers of the places of the left hand (which
defences and seals I will declare to you when I explain to you the
emanation of the mystery). Then they bring the soul before the Virgin of
Light, and it giveth to the Virgin her own seal, defence, and

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

the glory of hymns, and the Virgin of Light with the seven other Virgins
examine that soul--all of them, that they may all find their own marks,
their own seals, their own baptisms, and their own unctions upon it.
(292) Then the Virgin of Light sealeth that soul, and the Receivers of
Light baptize the same and give unto it the spiritual unction. And each
of the Virgins of Light sealeth it with her own seal. Furthermore the
Receivers deliver it over to the great Sabaoth, the Good One, who is
hard by the gate of Life in the region of those pertaining unto the
right hand, whom they call 'the Father'; and the soul rendereth unto him
the glory of his hymns, of his seals, and of his justification. Then the
great good Sabaoth sealeth it with his own seals, and the soul rendereth
the knowledge, and the glory of hymns, and the seals belonging to the
whole region of those that pertain unto the right hand. These also all
seal it with their own seal; and Melchisedek, the great gatherer of
Light--who is in the region of those pertaining to the right hand--also
sealeth that soul. Then Melchisedek's gatherers also seal it and lead it
into the Treasury of Light, and the soul rendereth glory and honour and
their proper seals in all the regions of Light. Then those pertaining to
all the regions of the Treasury of Light seal it with their own seals,
and so it entereth into the place of its inheritance."
