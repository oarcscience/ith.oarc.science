### PLATE J.

### SUBJECTS CONNECTED WITH THE MITHRAIC MYSTERIES.

1\. This pretty design may be tersely described in a line of Manilius--

"Quadrijugis et Phœbus equis et Delia bigis."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sol and Luna in
their appropriate equipages: a heathenish device enough, but the same
hand has backed their influence by the invocation, "Iao

Sabaoth, Abraxas;" He, *i.e.* the living God, protect Aparastathe, the
bearer of this talisman. Similar formulæ, always attached to women's
names, very frequently occur.

2\. The Zoroastrian *Dog*, of whom and whose office so much has been
said in the text. The ill-cut Bird is intended for the Raven, the usual
Mithraic attribute.

3\. The Lion of Baal, the Syrian Sun-god; below, the Scarabæus typifying
the Creative Power. The Phœnician inscription *Osan ēl*," God gives
strength," is the name of the owner of the signet.. Lévy quotes an agate
scarabæus at the British Museum exactly similar to this gem (a fine
sard), a proof of the popularity of both type and name.

4\. A unique talismanic device, converting a male Sphinx into a novel
bird, by the addition of the legs of a crane and the tail of a scorpion.
It is engraved in the Persian style: my motive for admitting it into the
present class.

5\. The Zodiacal Lion, guided by its astral Genius in its course through
the seven planets.

6\. The Sun-god, with radiated head, mounted upon a camel, typifying the
East. Below is set the fire-altar of Mithraic worship. He is followed by
Chanticleer, attribute of the god of Day, preceded by the Horse--his
peculiar sacrifice, as Ovid tells us:--

"Placat *equo* Persis radiis Hyperiona cinctum,  
 Ne detur Celeri victima tarda deo." (Fasti, I. 305-86.)
