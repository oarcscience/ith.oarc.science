### PLATE B.

1\. Abraxas, represented here with the head of an *ass*, and thereby
identified with Typhon, a singular perversion of ancient ideas. This gem
is valuable as distinctly declaring its purpose by the legend on the

<span id="page_436">p. 436</span>

reverse, Φ·?YΛ(φύλασσε), "Defend me," addressed to the Power depicted
upon it; and thus putting out of doubt the destruction of all the other
specimens of its class.

2\. Abraxas, of neat work and early date, not later than the fourth
century.

3\. The Giant Typhoeus defying Jove: his *serpent*-legs denote that he
is the son of Mother Earth. This beautiful intaglio, which is of
Italo-Greek workmanship, and found at Cumæ, is introduced here merely to
show the source whence the sectaries of the Decline borrowed the idea of
similar combinations of discordant natures. (Burnt sard: New York.)

4\. Abraxas, with whip and shield, combining his influence with *Horus*,
seated on the lotus, the regular personification of the Vernal Sun. The
meaning of the type is set forth in the legend, which is the Greek
transliteration of the Hebrew *Shemesh Ilam*, "Sun of the Universe." The
union of the two types indicates that Abraxas is here to be understood
in his original sense, the simple personification of the Solar Power.
