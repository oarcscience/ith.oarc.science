### WOODCUTS IN THE TEXT.

[Frontispiece](gar00.htm#img_front.md)<span id="an_front"></span>. Ceraunia
of green jade, converted into a Gnostic talisman described at [p.
197](gar30.htm#page_197.md). Presented to the Repository, Woolwich, by
General Lefroy.

[Title-page](gar00.htm#img_t00.md)<span id="an_t00"></span>. The Ophite
version of the "Good Shepherd," described at p. 230. Sard. (New York.)

[Agathodæmon Serpent](gar02.htm#img__01200.md)<span id="an__01200"></span>,
inscribed **ΙΘΙ** *With Me* \[thou shalt be safe\]. Remarkable
mineralogically, as being cut in a piece of true jade (Nephrite) (Lewis
Collection). P. [xii](gar02.htm#page_xii.md).

[No. 1](gar06.htm#img_fig01.md)<span id="an_fig01"></span>. The Gnostic
Gorgon, a late Byzantine amulet. The legend, full of blunders and
contractions, is **ΑΓΙΟCΑΓΙΟC ΚϒΡΙΟC CΑΒΑΩΘ ΕΝ ΤΟΙC ϒΨΙCΤΟΙC
ΕϒΛΟΓΗΜΕΝΟC**, "Holy, holy, Lord of hosts, in the highest, Blessed!"
Drawn to the actual size, from a cast, sent to me many years ago by the
late Mr. Albert Way. But by a singular chance, the gem itself (a green
jasper) two years back, came into the hands of Mr. W. Talbot Ready, who
supplied me with a drawing of it, from which it appears that its other
face represents Saint Anne, with the Infant Madonna in her arms, and her
name and title in the field, the legend around being **ϒCΤΕΡΑ ΜΕΛΑΙΝΗ
ΜΕΛΑΙΝΟΜΕΝΗ ΩC ΘΑΛΑΤΤΑΝ ΓΑΛΗΝΗ CΑΙΝΕΙ**, "O, womb, black, blackening, as
the calm soothes the sea \[be thou quiet\]. The gem is therefore a
talisman for the protection of women during pregnancy; a fact accounting
for its frequent occurrence; Chiflet figures another (the Gorgon side
only) in his "Apistopistus," No. 70. P. [20](gar06.htm#page_20.md).

[No. 2](gar10.htm#img_fig02.md)<span id="an_fig02"></span>. The
Abraxas-god, as he is usually represented, with shield and whip to scare
away all evil spirits. The reverse exhibits the Agathodæmon Serpent,
surrounded by triplets of the sacred animals of Egypt, all paying him
adoration. The legend in the field **ΕVΙΑ**, is Syriac for "Serpent,"
the rest remains unexplained. Drawn to the actual size, from a red
jasper, discovered at Bombay, to which place it had probably been
carried by the Persian refugees of the seventh century. (Lewis
Collection.) P. [41](gar10.htm#page_41.md).

[No. 3](gar12.htm#img_fig03.md)<span id="an_fig03"></span>. A circular
green jasper (of the size of the drawing) preserved from time immemorial
in Maestricht Cathedral, where it passes for the "Seal of Saint
Servatius," although in reality many centuries posterior to his date,
being a late mediæval work. The obverse represents the bust of some
saint; the reverse, the Gnostic Gorgon; around both rims a most
barbarous attempt at a common Byzantine spell; that is, of a few of the
first words only. The spell, in full, may be translated thus, "Death,
(Μοῖρα) black, blackening, as a serpent dost thou writhe, as a lion dost
thou roar; but as a lamb shalt thou lie down!" P.
[57](gar12.htm#page_57.md).

<span id="page_433">p. 433</span>

[No. 4](gar15.htm#img_fig04.md)<span id="an_fig04"></span>. The Abraxas-god
mounted in the chariot of the Sun. This design is unique in its kind,
and of great value, as proving the original identity of the Basilidan
deity with the Solar Power. He has, however, been adopted into the new
religion by the legend of the reverse, the "Great Names," *Iao* and
*Abraxas* placed within a coiled serpent, emblem of Eternity.
Green-jasper. (Bosanquet.) P. [103](gar15.htm#page_103.md).

[No. 5](gar21.htm#img_fig05.md)<span id="an_fig05"></span>. Horus, the
Vernal Sun, seated on the lotus, type of the world, and reviewing the
adoration of the Baboon, attribute of the moon. Jasper. (New York.) P.
[155](gar21.htm#page_155.md).

[No. 6](gar22.htm#img_fig06.md)<span id="an_fig06"></span>. The Sun in his
car, in his hand the orb; he is saluted in the legend as "Thou art our
Father!" and the word in the exergue Trallianus tells us is one of his
titles, and enters into a spell against gout. The reverse exhibits Luna
guiding her milk-white heifer, the Grecian substitute for the silver
*antelope* of the Hindoo Chandra Hæmatite. (New York.) P.
[157](gar22.htm#page_157.md).

[No. 7](gar25.htm#img_fig07.md)<span id="an_fig07"></span>. Isis, one lotus
on her brow, holding a sceptre. Sardonyx. (Muirhead.) P.
[175](gar25.htm#page_175.md).

[No. 8](gar26.htm#img_fig08.md)<span id="an_fig08"></span>. Caduceus,
within a myrtle wreath. On the reverse is beautifully engraved
**ΑΡΙΚΩΦΙ**, which is the exact transliteration of the Hebrew charm
against the special demon of the *latrina*, and which is found in the
Talmud, being consequently more ancient that the fourth century. The
meaning is "Upon the head of a lion." Sard. (New York.) P.
[178](gar26.htm#page_178.md).

[No. 9](gar28.htm#img_fig09.md)<span id="an_fig09"></span>. The Abraxas
god, engraved in so superior a style that the work must date from the
earliest period of the sect. Green jasper. (New York.) P.
[194](gar28.htm#page_194.md).

[No. 10](gar34.htm#img_fig10.md)<span id="an_fig10"></span>. The Abraxas
god, with the title "[Iao](errata.htm#29.md), Son of the Universe!" This is
a truer version of the Hebrew than the "Eternal Son," proposed by
Matter. Hæmatite. (New York.) P. [244](gar34.htm#page_244.md).

[No. 11](gar39.htm#img_fig11.md)<span id="an_fig11"></span>. Talisman
against the Evil Eye. The much-dreaded organ is shown encompassed by the
symbols of the deities presiding over the days of the week, as the
*Lion* for the Sun, the *Stag* for the Moon, the *Wolf* for Mars, &c.,
all combining to baffle the force of the stroke. This attribution of
days came from the Chaldæan astrologers: it is represented in a painting
at Herculaneum, but the earliest use of it to mark a date is found in
Dio Cassius, who observes that Jerusalem was taken "on Saturn's Day."
Sard. (New York.) P. [256](gar39.htm#page_256.md).

[No. 12](gar42.htm#img_fig12.md)<span id="an_fig12"></span>. Drawing rudely
scratched on the plaster of the wall of a guardroom, or the Palatine,
representing a man of the lower class *touncatus popellus*, or a slave,
making a gesture of adoration to a biform [deity](errata.htm#30.md)
elevated upon steps, with the explanatory inscription "Alexamenos,
worships (or is worshipping) God." It is disputed whether this be a
*bona fide* adoration of the jackal-headed Anubis; or the caricature by
some heathen scoffer of the convert, Alexamenos and his newly-found god,
depicted here in the shape described by Tertullian. See remarks at page
[230](gar33.htm#page_230). P. [279](gar42.htm#page_279.md).

<span id="page_434">p. 434</span>

[No. 13](gar43.htm#img_fig13.md)<span id="an_fig13"></span>. Bust of
Apollo, in the Greek style, interpolated by a later hand with a
talismanic legend, that would have defied all interpretation but for the
existence of another of the same nature, yet rather more explicit. This
is a portrait of Pescennius Niger (Paris), inscribed with an invocation
to the "Holy King, Apollo," to preserve the health of that Emperor,
expressed like the present one, chiefly by the initial letters. Ouri,
therefore, must be read Βασιλεὺς Ἀπόλλων Ἱερὸς Σεου(ηοον) \[σῶζε\] and,
in the same way, calls upon the God of Health to show this favour to
Pescennius’ rival, Severus. Sard. (New York.) P.
[302](gar43.htm#page_302.md).

[No. 14](gar46.htm#img_fig14.md)<span id="an_fig14"></span>. Talismanic
Ring of Bishop Seffrid, found in his tomb; now preserved in the
Cathedral Library, Chichester. P. 328.

[No. 15](gar47.htm#img_fig15.md)<span id="an_fig15"></span>. The
Agathodæmon, declaring by the legend "I am Chnumis, Sun of the Universe,
700." The Greek numeral must be the Number of a Name," just as 888 is
that of *Jesus*, but what that name was, I leave to deeper Kabbalists
than myself to discover. Calcedony. (British Museum.) P.
[340](gar47.htm#page_340.md).

[No. 16](gar52.htm#img_fig16.md)<span id="an_fig16"></span>. Serapis and
Agathodæmon combined in one body; enthroned and holding the Orb, as
being Lord of the Universe. He receives the adoration of the
Cynocephalus, attribute of the moon; whence, perhaps, it may be inferred
that Serapis is to be understood now in the more restricted sense of the
Solar Power. Green jasper. (New York.) P. [358](gar52.htm#page_358.md).

[No. 17](gar53.htm#img_fig17.md)<span id="an_fig17"></span>. SPHINX, emblem
of mystery, sporting with a *narthex*, the wand carried by the
candidates for initiation into the Dionysia. Campanian style, engraved
upon the base of a Sard. Scarabeus. (New York.) P.
[372](gar53.htm#page_372.md).

[No. 18](gar70.htm#img_fig18.md)<span id="an_fig18"></span>. The *golden*
Delphic **Ε**, surmounted by a fillet of roses. For the explanation of
the symbol, see p. 297. Cameo in agate-onyx. (New York.) P.
[431](gar70.htm#page_431.md).

[No. 19](gar88.htm#img_fig19.md)<span id="an_fig19"></span>. Vase, the
lower part modelled as a triple face of the boy Atys; at the base lie
the pastoral staff and pipes. Atys, in the Phrygian Mysteries, is
invoked as the "Shepherd of the white stars, and guiding them by the
sound of his piping," which Tatian (Hymn to the Mother of the Gods)
explains by identifying him with the power that governs the motions of
the heavens. Red jasper. (New York.) P. [466](gar88.htm#page_466.md).
