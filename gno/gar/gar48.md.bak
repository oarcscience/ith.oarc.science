### GNOSTIC THEOGONY.

The several grades in the Gnostic Theogony, through all of which the
soul had to pass before it could attain to supreme perfection, are
briefly set before us in this passage of the Pistis Sophia (247):--

"And when the Saviour had said all these things unto His disciples,
Andrew came forward and spoke: 'Lord, be not wroth with me, but have
compassion upon me and reveal the mystery of the word which I will ask
Thee, otherwise it is a hard thing in my sight and I understand it not.'
Then the Saviour answered and said unto him: 'Inquire what thou wouldst
inquire and I will declare the same unto thee, face to face, and without
a parable.' Then Andrew answered and said: 'Lord, I wonder and marvel
greatly how men that be in this world, when they are departed from out
of this body of *Matter*, and have gone out of the world, how shall they
pass through these [firmaments](errata.htm#23.md), and all these rulers,
and lords, and gods, and all these Great Invisible Ones, and all these
that belong to the Middle-space, and those that belong to the place of
them upon the right hand, and all the great emanations of the same, so
that they may come within (beyond) them all, so that they may inherit
the kingdom of Light? This business, therefore, Lord, is full of trouble
in my sight.' When Andrew had thus spoken, the spirit of the Saviour was
moved within Him, and he cried out and said: How long shall I bear with
you, how long shall I suffer you! Do you then not understand at all, and
are ye still ignorant? Know ye not and do ye not understand that ye are
all angels, and archangels, and rulers, and lords, and gods, and the
other Powers, and the glory thereof; you *from* yourselves and *in*
yourselves in turn, proceeding out of one mass, and one matter, and one
being, and all proceeding out of one *confusion*. <span

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And by the
commandment of the First Mystery this confusion must needs be, until the
great emanations of Light and the glory of the same shall have cleansed
it; and they shall cleanse it not of themselves, but through the
compulsion of the Great Ineffable One. And they have not received
torments, neither have they changed their places at all, neither have
they despoiled themselves, nor transformed themselves into various
figures, neither have they been in the last affliction. For this cause
chiefly ye are the dregs of the Treasury-house, and ye are the dregs of
them that pertain to the right hand, and ye are the dregs of the great
Invisible Ones, and of all the Rulers, and in a word ye are the dregs of
them all. And ye were in great sorrows, and afflictions, and
transformations, and in sundry shapes of this world; and by reason of
these sorrows, ye were in agony and fought with this world and all the
Matter that is therein, and ye did not slacken your hands in fighting
against it until ye had found out the mysteries of the kingdom of Light,
which rendered you, who fought, a pure Light, and ye were made the pure
Light.'"

All which implies the grand idea that Man, although made of inferior,
though cognate stuff, to the Angelic Powers, is susceptible, through the
attainment of *knowledge*, of a perfection superior to theirs.

mixture of the Light Divine with brute Matter, which it was the object
