### THE OPHITES.

The Ophites should hold by right the first place amongst the schools we
are considering, for that impartial and acute historian of the Gnosis,
Hippolytus, styles them, "The Naaseni who specially call themselves
'Gnostics.' But inasmuch as this deception of theirs is multiform and
has many heads (a play upon their name of serpent-followers), like the
Hydra of fable, if I smite all the heads at once with the wand of Truth,
I shall destroy the whole serpent, for all the other sects differ but
little from this one in essentials." He therefore commences his history
of the Gnostic heresies, properly so called, with a minute account of
this one, illustrated with copious extracts from their text-books; on
account of their antiquity and importance bestowing much more of his
space upon them than upon any other of their offshoots or competitors.

Their strange-sounding title "Naaseni"--"Followers of the Naas" (the
only way in which the Greek, from its want of aspirate letters, could
write the Hebrew Nachash, "Serpent")was literally rendered by "Ophites,"
the name which has ever since served to designate them. They first
assumed a definite existence about the same time as the Basilidans, in
the middle of the second century, although the elements of the doctrine
are derived from a source much more remote. That source was the secret
doctrines taught in the various Pagan Mysteries; and likewise certain
philosophic theories of the Greeks, although certainly not to the same
extent as the learned Hippolytus labours so ingeniously to demonstrate.

In support of this statement I shall proceed to quote from the same
Father some curious examples of the method in which the Naaseni
pretended to recognise their own "knowledge" in the esoteric religions
of antiquity. After quoting a long passage from Pindar about the
conflicting theories as to the creation of the First Man <span
id="fr_28"></span>[\*](#fn_27.md) and the names given to him by different
nations, the Ophite text-book continues:

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

"This was the Man brought forth by the Earth spontaneously; but he lay
without breath, without motion, without stirring, like a statue; being
made after the image of their Adamas above, the subject of their hymns,
through the agency of several Powers, concerning each one of whom they
narrate a long fable. But in order that the Man above might be obtained,
'from whom is every tribe upon the Earth, and likewise in the Heavens,'
there was given unto him a soul, that through this soul the image of the
Man above might suffer and be chastened in bondage. As to the nature and
source of this soul sent down to animate this image, the Ophite theory
is derived *not from Scripture, but from the doctrine of the Mysteries*.
'The Gospel according to the Egyptians' is their text-book on this
point. They premise that the nature of the soul is extremely difficult
to investigate by reason of its inherent changeableness, never abiding
fixedly in the same place, habits, or passion: and they adopt in this
particular the *notions of the Assyrian mystics*. It is a question with
them whether the soul comes from the 'Pre-existing,' or from the
'Self-begotten One,' or from the 'Effusion of Chaos.' They adopt the
*Assyrian* division of the soul as being both one and threefold! For all
Nature longs for a soul; the soul is the efficient cause of all things
that grow, are nourished and have action. For without a soul, growth and
nutrition are impossible; even stones have a soul, for they possess the
faculty of growth, and this faculty cannot exist without nutrition. All
things therefore in Heaven or Earth, and in the Abyss, are eager after a
soul. This *soul* the Assyrians call 'Adonis,' 'Endymion,' 'Attis'; and
hence arose the fable of the love of Venus for Adonis; Venus signifying
*generation*. The love of Proserpine for Adonis means that the soul is
mortal if separated from Venus; that is, from generation. When the Moon
is enamoured of Endymion, it is Nature herself desiring a more sublime
soul. When the Mother of the gods emasculates her lover, Attis, it
signifies the Power

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

above recalling into itself the male energy of the soul. For the Man
that is above is of both sexes." \[On this account they most vehemently
denounce all intercourse with women.\] "Attis was deprived of his
virility, that is, was divested of his lower, earthly, part, and then
translated to the Upper World, 'where is neither male nor female, but a
new creature,' the Man above, of two sexes. And to this truth not only
Rhea, but all creation, beareth testimony. And to this cloth Paul refer
in Romans (i. 20-27): (where they strangely pervert his expression
ἀσχημοσύνη, as signifying that heavenly, sublime, felicity, that
*absence of all form* which is the real source of every form). These
same verses of Paul, according to them, contain the key to their whole
system, and to their 'Mystery of Celestial Pleasure.' For the promise of
'Washing' applies to none save the man who is introduced into the
eternal pleasure, 'being washed with the True Water, and anointed with
the Unction that cannot be spoken.' The Phrygian Mysteries, equally with
the Assyrian, teach the same great truth, when they teach the blessed
nature of things past, present, and to come, hidden and yet manifested;
the 'true kingdom that is within you.' To the same effect they bring
forward the *Gospel of Thomas*, which has, 'He that seeketh shall find
me amongst children from seven years downwards, for in the fourteenth
generation, being hidden, I will manifest myself.' \[Although in reality
this is not a maxim of Christ's, but a maxim of Hippocrates. 'The boy at
seven years of age is the half of his father,'--in stature.\]

"The Egyptians were, after the Phrygians, the most ancient of mankind,
and the first establishers of mysteries. The Ophites explain as follows
the esoteric doctrine concerning Isis, and the genital member of Osiris,
lost, sought after, and enveloped by her seven times in a black (or dark
blue) <span id="fr_29"></span>[\*](#fn_28.md) vestment. Osiris is the
element *Water;* Nature seven times enveloped in an etherial robe, that
is, the seven planetary spheres, stands for Generation and Change, or
Creation transformed by the ineffable, formless, imageless,
incomprehensible Deity. The same is implied in the words of Scripture,
'The righteous man shall fall seven times, and shall rise again'--his

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

*all* signifying the revolutions of the planets put in motion by the
All-mover.

"They likewise discourse concerning the essence (or *existence*) of the
'Seed,' <span id="fr_30"></span>[\*](#fn_29.md) the final cause of all
things that exist, although itself none of them, and yet making and
generating all things; or, as they themselves express it, 'I become what
I will, and am what I am; therefore I say that moving all, I am myself
immovable.' For it continues what it is, making all things, although
itself is made nothing of all that exist. To this doctrine the Saviour's
words refer, 'Why callest thou me good? One only is good, my Father
which is in Heaven, who maketh the sun to shine upon the just and upon
the unjust, and sendeth His rain upon the sinners and upon the
righteous.' And this is the *great and unknown Mystery*, hidden amongst
the Egyptians and yet manifested, for Osiris standeth in his temple
before Isis, having his secret part exposed and pointed upwards, and
crowned with all the fruits of the creation. And for this cause, the
same member \[the Phallus\] holds the first position in the most sacred
places, being shown forth unto the world, 'like a light set upon a
candlestick': it is set up on the housetops, and in the streets, and for
landmarks. It is a blessing acknowledged and proclaimed by all, for they
call it the 'Bringer of Luck' (ἀγαθηφόρον),--not understanding what they
say. This mystery the Greeks *got from Egypt*, and observe unto this
day. For by this symbol they represent Hermes; and they entitle that god
'Logicos,' for he is the *interpreter* and Creator of things made, in
making, and to be made; and he is represented by this his proper symbol.
And that *this* is the Hermes, guide, companion, and author of souls,
Homer hath perceived, for he saith (Od. xxiv. 1-2)--

'Cyllenian Hermes summoned forth the souls of the bold suitors,'

not meaning those of Penelope's suitors, but of us the awakened and
admonished.

'From what vast happiness, what height of glory,'

we have fallen, namely, from the Primal Man, the *Adamas* 

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

that is above, into this vessel of clay, and become the servants of the
Demiurgus, of Ildabaoth, the God of Fire, the *Fourth* in number (for by
this name they call the creator of the 'World of Species,' κοσμὸς
ἰδικός).

"In his hand his wand Beauteous, all golden, by whose potency the eyes
of mortals he at pleasure lulls to sleep, or rouses others from their
slumber. For He is the sole author of life and death, therefore is it
written, 'Thou shalt rule them with a rod of iron.' But Homer wishing to
embellish the incomprehensible reality of the nature of the Logos, has
given to him a rod of *gold*, not of iron. Some He casts into slumber,
others he awakens, and makes them aware of their condition: 'Awake thou
that sleepest, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light.' For *this* is the Christ that is figured within all the sons of
men by the unfigured Logos. *This* is the great and profound mystery of
the Eleusinian rites, the cry, ϒΕ ΚϒΕ, *Rain! Conceive!* All things are
subject unto Him, for their sound is gone forth unto all lands.' And
again, *this* is the hidden sense of Homer's

'He waved his wand, they followed with shrill cry.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That is, the souls
in a continuous line, as the poet goes on to express by the simile--

'As in the furthest depths of some vast cave,  
Shrill cry the bats when one drops from their chain,  
Down from the rock where fast they cling together.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That is, the souls
fallen down from the Rock above, namely from the Adamas. *This* is the
Adamas, the chief corner-stone, 'which is made the head of the corner,'
because in the head is placed the formative substance, the brain, out of
which all generation proceeds. 'I will set the Adamant in the
foundations of Zion' is allegorical for setting the figure of the Man
(in the soul). And the text, 'This Adamas is firmly held by teeth in the
wall,' is the *Inner Man* that is signified, the stone cut without
hands,' which hath fallen down from the Adamas above into this earthly
potter's vessel, this figure of *forgetfulness*. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[\*](#fn_30.md)

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

"The souls follow Hermes, or the Logos.

'So moved they, crying, through the darksome paths;  
Hermes their guide, that god devoid of ill.'

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> That is, he leads
them to the everlasting places where no ill comes; for whither were they
going?

'They passed o’er Ocean's wave and Leucas’ rock,  
The Sun's bright portals, and the land of dreams.'

"This 'Ocean' signifies the generation of gods and the generation of
men, ever tossing in a perpetual flow and ebb. When it runs *downwards*
it is the generation of men; when it tosses itself *upwards* against its
boundary, <span id="fr_32"></span>[\*](#fn_31.md) the rock Leucas, it is
the generation of gods. 'For this cause,' saith the Wise One, 'I have
said ye are gods and the children of the Most Highest, when ye shall
make haste to flee out of Egypt, and shall come beyond the Red Sea into
the Wilderness'; that is, out of this earthly mixture (or confusion) up
to the Jerusalem above, which is the mother of the living. 'But if ye
return into Egypt (or, into this earthly nature) ye shall die.' 'Egypt'
being the prison of the body. *This* is the mighty Jordan which, flowing
downwards, hindered the flight of the Children of Israel; but which
Jesus (*i.e.* Joshua) turned, and made to flow upwards."

"Following guides like those just cited, these very strange fellows the
Gnostics (observes Hippolytus), the inventors of a new art of grammar
(or, criticism), extol beyond all expression their prophet Homer, who
hath foreshown these doctrines unto them: and, by seducing those
ignorant of the Holy Scriptures into such-like fancies, they make fools
of them in the manner described."

"Another of their maxims is that 'Whoso saith that the All cometh from
*One* is grossly deceived; but he that saith that the All cometh from
*Three*, hath the true key to the system of the universe. For there is
one nature of the Man that is above, Adamas; one mortal here below; one
without a king, the generation existing up above, where is Mariam the
Sought-After, and Jothor the great and wise, and Sephora, she that

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

seeth, and Moses, whose offspring is not in Egypt, for his sons were
born unto him in the land of Midian. Neither hath this truth escaped
Homer, for he sings--

"All things are parcelled into portions three,  
And to each portion its due honour falls."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For it is
necessary that the Great Ones (τὰ μεγέθη) should be expressed in words,
but in such wise that "hearing men may not hear, and seeing they may not
perceive." For if the Great Ones were not uttered, the world could not
exist. These three most sublime names are, KAVLACAV, SAVLASAV, ZEESAR.
*Kavlacav* is the name of the Adamas who is above; *Savlasav* of him who
is below, mortal; *Zeesar* of the Jordan that floweth upwards. *This* is
He that pervades all things, being at once male and female, named by the
Greeks Geryon, as having three bodies and flowing out of the Earth: whom
the Greeks also call "The Moon's celestial horn," because he has *mixed*
and *tempered* all things \[a play upon the similar sounding words κέρας
and κρᾶσις\]. "For all things were made through him, and without him
nothing was made, and what was made in him is Life." This Life is the
life unspeakable, the generation of the Perfect Man, unknown to former
ages. The "Nothing" that was made without him is the World of Species,
for *that* world was made without him by the *Third* and by the *Fourth*
One. <span id="fr_33"></span>[\*](#fn_32) *This* is the Cup (*condy*.md) of
Joseph, "out of which the king doth drink and use divination." Of this
also do the Greeks (Anacreon) sing in Bacchic frenzy,

"Bring me, boy, the draught divine;  
Bring me water, bring me wine;  
Make me drunk with quaffing deep,  
Lull my charmed soul to sleep;  
For my cup predicts to me  
Of what country I shall be."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Here Anacreon's
dumb cup utters the unspeakable mystery, for it tells him to *what
country* he shall belong, that is, whether to the *Spiritual* or to the
*Carnal* world. *This* also is the "Water changed into wine," at the
famous wedding at Cana, when Jesus manifested the kingdom of
Heaven--that kingdom which is

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

hidden within every man, like the leaven sufficient for the *three*
measures. Here likewise is the unspeakable secret of the *Samothracian
Mysteries*, which none but we the "Perfect" are able to understand, for
the Samothracians expressly mention the Adamas who is above--the Primal
Man. For in the Temple of the Samothracians stand two naked men, having
their hands and their genital members elevated towards heaven, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[\*](#fn_33.md) like the Hermes of Cyllene. These two
statues represent the Primal Man, and the Spiritual Man after he is
"born again, and made like unto Him every whit."'

"*This* is the true sense of the Saviour's words, 'Unless ye eat my
flesh and drink my blood, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven';
and 'Though ye shall drink of the cup that I drink of, whither I go ye
shall not be able to enter.' For He knew the *nature* of His disciples,
and that every one must abide in his own nature. For out of the Twelve
Tribes he chose the Twelve Disciples; for which cause not all who heard
their teaching received or understood the same; for that which is not
according to Nature is contrary to Nature. Him (Adamas) do the Phrygians
name 'Corybas,' for he descends from the Head (*cory*) who is above, the
Supernal Brain; and permeates the All in a manner incomprehensible. And,
as the Prophet hath it, 'Ye have heard his voice, but ye have not beheld
his form'; that is, the *Image* coming down from the Formless One above
no one knows, for it is hidden within an earthen vessel. *This* is as
the Psalmist hath it: 'The God dwelling in the great

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

flood, and crying aloud out of the waters of the sea'; that is, He cries
aloud out of the multiform *confusion* (or, medley) of things mortal
unto the Formless One who is above, 'Save my First-born from the lions.'
\[And in the same sense do they interpret all the similes concerning
'waterfloods,' and the promises of the Deity's never forgetting His
chosen people.\]

"The Ascension or Regeneration, that is, the conversion of the Carnal
Man into the Spiritual, is thus explained by means of a curious
perversion of words taken from different Psalms: 'Lift up your heads, ye
everlasting gates, that the King of Glory may come in. Who is this King
of Glory? The very scorn of men, and the outcast of the people, He is
the King of Glory, mighty in battle.' *Battle* signifies the war in your
members ever being waged within this earthly creature made up of
conflicting elements. *This* is the *gate* seen by Jacob as he was
journeying into Mesopotamia; that is, the young man growing up out of
the boy, and *Mesopotamia* signifies the stream of the Great Ocean which
flows out of the middle of the Perfect Man. The same deity is called by
the Phrygians PAPA, because He *appeased* the confusion and chaotic
tumult which prevailed before His coming. For this name is the unanimous
cry παῦε, παῦε, <span id="fr_35"></span>[\*](#fn_34.md) of all things in
Heaven, in Earth, and under the Earth, calling upon Him to *appease* the
discord, and to 'send peace to men that were afar off'--that is, to the
earthly and mortal--'and to them that were near' that is, to the
spiritual and perfect. He is likewise called 'dead' by the Phrygians,
inasmuch as he is *buried* within the tomb of the body; to which
circumstance also apply the words, 'Ye are whited sepulchres, full of
dead men's bones and all manner of uncleanness; because the Living Man
doth not dwell within you.'

"'The dead shall rise from their graves' signifies that the Earthly Man
shall be born again spiritual. Unless they pass

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

through this 'Gate' all continue dead, but him that hath passed through
the Phrygians call a *god*, for he becomes a god, having passed through
the Gate into Heaven. Paul means the same by his 'being caught up into
the third heaven, and hearing unutterable things.' Again, 'the publicans
and harlots shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven before you,' where
*publicans* means the Gentiles 'upon whom the *ends* of the world have
come'; <span id="fr_36"></span>[\*](#fn_35.md) where 'ends' are the seeds
of the universe scattered about by the Formless One, as is set forth by
the Saviour, 'He that hath ears to hear, let him hear,' declaring that
none but the perfect Gnostics can comprehend this mystery.

"Those beloved by the Formless One are Pearls in this vessel of clay;
and to them refers the precept, 'Cast not that which is holy to the
dogs; neither throw your pearls before swine;' meaning sexual
intercourse with women--an act fit only for dogs and swine. He is also
called Αἰπόλος by the Phrygians, not because he really kept flocks, as
the profane fancy, but because he is ὁ αἰεὶ πολῶν, 'he that ever turns'
the universe in its due revolutions, whence the phrase, the 'poles' of
heaven. And Homer (Od. iv. 384-85) says--

'Here *turns* about the truthful sea-god old,  
Immortal Proteus by the Egyptians called.'

"He is likewise styled 'Fruitful,' because 'the children of the widow
shall be more than those of her that hath a husband;' that is, the
*spiritual* who are born again, being immortal, are in number more
(though but few of them are born into this life) than the *carnal*, who,
in spite of their present multitude, do all perish utterly at last.

"The knowledge of the Perfect Man is very deep, and hard to be attained
to. 'The *beginning* of perfection is the knowledge of man, but
*absolute* perfection is the knowledge of God.' He (Adamas) is
designated by the Phrygians as, the 'Green Wheat-ear cut off'; on this
account, at the Eleusinian rites, the initiated hold up in silence to
the Directors the wondrous mystery, the green ear of wheat. This
wheat-ear is the Perfect Son descended from the Adamas above, the Great
Giver

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

of light, like the Hierophant himself. This latter is not actually
castrated like Attis, but emasculated by the use of hemlock, so that he
despises all carnal pleasure; and whilst celebrating the mysteries
amidst blazing torches, he cries aloud, 'The holy Brimo hath borne a
sacred son, Brimos'--alluding to the Spiritual Birth. The rites are
therefore named 'Eleusinian' and 'Anactorian,' from the Greek words
signifying *Coming* and *Ascending*. This is what the initiated
themselves declare concerning the mysteries of Proserpine; and of the
road leading the defunct down to her the poet (Amphis) hath--

'But underneath her lies a rugged path,  
Hollow and muddy, yet the best to lead  
Down to the lovely groves of precious Venus.'

"These are the Lesser Mysteries, of *earthly* origin, 'in which men
ought to rest themselves for a while, and then proceed to the Greater
Mysteries,' that is, to heavenly regeneration.

"The Father of the All is furthermore called by the Phrygians
'Amygdalus,' *the Almond Tree;* not meaning the natural tree, but the
Pre-existing One, who, having within himself the Perfect Fruit pulsating
and moving about in his depths, *tore open* (διήμυξε) his bosom, and
brought forth the Invisible, Ineffable Son, of whom we are
treating. <span id="fr_37"></span>[\*](#fn_36.md) He is moreover
denominated the 'Piper,' because that which is born is the harmonious
*Spirit* \[or, *breath*, the Greek affording no distinction between the
two senses of the word.\] The Spirit is likewise called the Father, and
the Son begotten by the Father; for the worship of the Perfect is not
carnal, but spiritual: therefore, 'Neither in Jerusalem nor in this
mountain shall ye worship any more.

"*This* is the mystery of the Incomprehensible One, *furnished with
innumerable eyes*, whom all Nature longeth after in different ways.
\[Perhaps an allusion to the Brahminical figure of Indra, god of the
heavens.\] This is the 'Word of God,' that is, the

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

word of the declaration of his great power: 'Wherefore it shall be
sealed up, and veiled, and hidden, lying in the dwelling-place, where is
established the Root of all the Æons, Powers, thoughts \[Platonic
*Ideas*\], gods, angels, spirit-messengers that are, that are not,
begotten, unbegotten, comprehensible, incomprehensible, of the years,
months, days, hours, moments, whence Time begins to grow and increase by
particles. For a moment (or geometrical *point*), itself being nothing,
made of nothing, indivisible, grows by accretion into a magnitude
incomprehensible.' This is the Kingdom of Heaven, the grain of mustard
seed, the Indivisible Point existing within every one, but only known
unto the Spiritual Man.

"'There is neither speech nor language, but their voices are heard
amongst them,' signifies that whatever men say or do, has all a
*spiritual meaning* to the Perfect; even the actors in the theatre utter
nothing without the intervention of the Deity. For when the audience are
seated, and the actor comes upon the stage, clad in a gorgeous robe and
twanging his lyre, he sings thus a great mystery without knowing what he
says--'Whether thou be the offspring of Saturn, or of blessed Jove, or
of the mighty Rhea, hail! *Thee* Assyrians call the thrice-desired
*Adamas*; whilst Egypt styles Thee *Osiris;* the Greeks in their wisdom
(esoteric knowledge) the *Moon's Holy Horn;* the Samothracians, the
venerable *Adamnas;* the Hæmonians, *Corybas;* the Phrygians, at one
time, Papa, the *Dead One;* at another, the *God*, or the *Barren One*,
or the *Green Wheat-ear* cut off; or him whom the fruitful *Almond Tree*
poses the man playing on the pipe.' He is the multiform *Attis*, whom
they thus describe in their hymns: 'I will sing of Attis, the favourite
of Rhea, with the clashing of cymbals, the bellowing of the Idæan pipe
of the Curetes, and will intermingle the sound of Phœbus’ lyre. Evoe!
Evau! Thou that art like unto Pan, unto Bacchus, thou Shepherd of the
white stars!'

"For these" (adds Hippolytus) "and other such like reasons, these
Ophites frequent the Mysteries of the Great Mother, fancying that by
means of what is done there they can see through the whole secret. But
in reality they have not the least advantage over other people, except
that they are not

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

emasculated, and yet they act as though they were. For they most
strictly forbid all intercourse with women, and in every other respect,
as we have fully described, they do the same things as the eunuchs, the
regular priests of Rhea."

After giving an account of their worship and glorification of the
Serpent (which I shall extract when treating of the Agathodæmon
religion) Hippolytus thus continues:--"The foregoing is a sample of the
insane, absurd, and interminable theories of the sect. But to show up,
as far as lies in our power, their *unknowing* 'knowledge,' the
following hymn <span id="fr_38"></span>[\*](#fn_37.md) is here inserted, as
containing a summary of the whole creed:--

"'The generative law of the All was the First Mind;  
But the Second was the effused chaos of the First:  
In the third place the Soul received a law, and began to operate. <span
id="fr_39"></span>[†](#fn_38.md)  
Whereupon She (the Soul) enveloped in the figure of a fawn,  
Struggles with Death, suffering a probationary penance.  
At one time, invested with royalty, she beholds the Light;  
At another, cast down into misery, she weeps.  
Now she weeps and rejoices;  
Now she weeps and is judged;  
Now she is judged and dies.  
When shall her deliverance be?  
The wretched one  
Hath entered, as she strayed, into an evil labyrinth.  
But Jesus said: Father, suffer me;  
She in quest of evil (or, the chased of evil ones) upon earth  
Wandereth about, destitute of Thy Spirit:  
She seeketh to escape from the bitter chaos,  
But knoweth not how to pass through.  
For this cause send me, O Father!  
I will go down holding the Seals,  
I will pass through all the Æons;  
I will reveal all the mysteries;  
I will manifest the forms of the gods; <span
id="fr_40"></span>[‡](#fn_39.md)  
And the hidden secrets of the holy way  
I will teach, giving unto them the name of **GNOSIS**.'

"This, therefore, is the system (or pretension) of the Naaseni, who
designate themselves 'the Gnostics.' But this

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

deception of theirs being multiform, and having many heads like the
Hydra of fable, if I smite all the heads at a single blow with the wand
of Truth, I shall destroy the whole serpent, for all the other sects
differ but little from this in essentials."

Hippolytus has not given a connected analysis of the Ophite system; he
probably deemed it superfluous labour, as having been already done with
much exactness by Irenæus in his great work, to which the former
occasionally refers as being then in everybody's hands. To the Bishop of
Lugdunum, therefore, we must apply for this information, which will be
found given at much length in Chapters xxxi.–xxxiii. of the First Book
of his History. He states that the Ophites, like other Gnostics,
rejected the Old Testament altogether as the work of a subordinate
divinity, and containing nothing of the revelations of their *Sophia*,
or Divine Wisdom; whilst they held that the New, although originally of
higher authority, had been so corrupted by the interpolations of the
Apostles as to have lost all value as a revelation of Divine truth. They
drew the chief supports of their tenets out of the various "Testaments"
and similar books then current, and ascribed to the Patriarchs and the
most ancient Prophets, for example, the book of Enoch.

The primary article of this doctrine was the Emanation of all things
from the One Supreme, long utterly unknown to mankind, and at last only
revealed to a very small number capable of receiving such enlightenment.
Hence he is named *Bythos*, "Profundity," to express his unfathomable,
inscrutable nature. Following the Zoroastrian and the Kabbalistic
nomenclature they also designated Him as the "Fountain of Light," and
"The Primal Man," giving for reason of the latter title that "Man was
created after the *image* of God," which proved the nature of the
prototype.

The *Beginning* of Creation, that is, the Primal *Idea*, or Emanation,
was the "thought," *Ennoia*, of Bythos, who bears also the significant
name of *Sige*, "Silence." This *Idea* being the first act of creation
of the Primal Man, is therefore properly denominated the "Second Man."
Ennoia is the consort (compare the Hindoo *Darga*) of Bythos, and she
produced *Pneuma*, "the

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Spirit," who,
being the source of all created things, is entitled "the Mother of all
living," and likewise *Sophia*, the wisdom from on high. As the mother
of all living, Sophia is the medium between the intellectual and
material worlds. In consequence of this, when Bythos and Ennoia, charmed
with her beauty, furnished her with the divine Light, Sophia produced
two new Emanations--the one perfect, *Christos*, the other imperfect,
*Sophia-Achamoth*. (This scheme resembles the Buddhistic; Bythos
answering to the First Buddha; Sige, Sophia, Christos, Achamoth,
Ildabaoth, to the successive other Five.)

Of these emanations Christos was designed for the guide of all who
proceed from God; Achamoth, for the guide of all proceeding out of
matter; nevertheless, the Perfect One was intended to assist and lead
upwards his imperfect sister.

Furthermore, the Spirit rests upon Chaos, or the *waters of Creation*,
which are Matter, Water, Darkness, the Abyss. This Chaos was devoid of
all *life*, for life proceeds ultimately from the Supreme, who has no
connection whatever with Matter. Neither could his purely intellectual
daughter, Sophia, act directly upon it; she therefore employed for agent
her own emanation, Achamoth, whose mixed imperfect nature fitted her for
that office.

This First Tetrad, Bythos, Ennoia, Sige, Sophia, were in the meantime
creating *Ecclesia*, the Idea of the Holy Church. But the imperfect
Achamoth upon descending into Chaos, lost her way there, and became
ambitious of creating a world entirely for herself. She floated about in
the Abyss, delighted at imparting life and motion to the inert elements,
until she became so hopelessly entangled in Matter as to be unable to
extricate herself from its trammels. In this condition she produced the
creator of the *material* world, the Demiurgus, Ildabaoth.

But after this event, Achamoth feeling the intolerable burden of her
material part, after long and repeated efforts, at length struggled
forth out of Chaos. She had never belonged to the Pleroma, but she
attained to the "Middle Space"; where she entirely shook off her
material part, and determined to erect a barrier between the World of
Intelligence and the World of

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Matter. Ildabaoth,
"Son of Darkness," creator and tyrant of the Lower World, followed the
example of Bythos in producing subordinate Emanations. First of all he
generated an Angel in his own likeness; this Angel a second; and so on
up to the number of six. These are all reflexions one of the other; but
they inhabit, with their father, Ildabaoth, seven different regions; to
which the Middle Space, dominion of their origin Achamoth, forms the
eighth. Their names are Iao, Sabaoth, Adonai, Eloi, Ouraios, Astaphaios.
They became the Genii of the seven worlds, or planetary spheres. The
first four names are the mystic titles of the God of the Jews--degraded
thus by the Ophites into appellations of the subordinates of the
Creator; the two last signify the forces of Fire and Water.

In this degradation of the names most sacred in the Jewish theology, is
clearly to be recognised, the very teaching of those "dreamers"
reprobated by Jude, v. 8 for despising "Dominion," and speaking evil of
"Dignities." For "Dominion" is the "Empire" in the Sephiroth (see page
[35](gar10.htm#page_35).md) to which the Kabbala assigned the title
*Adonai*. Now we find here the Ophites making Adonai the *third* son of
Ildabaoth, a malevolent Genius, and like his father and brethren, the
eternal adversary of the Christ. The "Dignities" mean the other
personages of the Sephiroth, similarly dishonoured by the new doctrine.
Jude shows plainly whom he had in view by contrasting in the next verse
the audacity of these "blasphemers" with the respect shown by the
Archanged Michael towards his opponent on account of his *angelic
nature*, however fallen from his high estate. By a most singular
coincidence (much too close to have been merely accidental), Jude's
censure, nay, his very expressions are repeated by Peter in his second
Epistle (ii. 10). If either of these Epistles were really written by the
Apostles whose names they bear, these passages bring to light the very
early existence of this school of Gnosticism, which indeed may have been
founded before the promulgation of Christianity. But to return to the
operations of Ildabaoth. Besides the Spirits above mentioned, he
generated Archangels, Angels, Virtues, and Powers presiding over all the
details of the creation. Ildabaoth was far from being a pure spirit;
ambition

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

and pride dominated in his composition. He therefore resolved to break
off all connection with his mother, Achamoth, and to create a world
entirely for himself. Aided by his own Six Spirits, he created Man,
intending him for the image of his power; but he failed utterly in his
work, his Man proving a vast, soulless monster, crawling upon the earth.
The Six Spirits were obliged to bring their work again before their
father, to be animated: he did so by communicating the ray of Divine
Light which he himself had inherited from Achamoth, who by this loss
punished him for his pride and self-sufficiency.

Man, thus favoured by Achamoth at the expense of her own son, followed
the impulse of the Divine Light that she had transferred to him,
collected a further supply out of the creation with which it was
intermingled, and began to present not the image of his creator
Ildabaoth, but rather that of the Supreme Being, the "Primal Man." At
this spectacle the Demiurgus was filled with rage and envy at having
produced a being so superior to himself. His looks, inspired by his
passions, were reflected in the Abyss, as in a mirror, the image became
instinct with life, and forth arose "Satan Serpent-formed,"
*Ophiomorphos*, the embodiment of envy and cunning. He is the
combination of all that is most base in matter with the hate, envy and
craft of Spiritual Intelligence. Out of their normal hatred for Judaism,
the Ophites gave this being the name of *Michael*, the guardian angel of
the Jewish nation according to Daniel (v. 21). But they also called him
*Samiel*, the Hebrew name of the Prince of the Devils.

In consequence of his spite at the creation of Man, Ildabaoth set to
work to create the three kingdoms of Nature, the Animal, the Vegetable,
and the Mineral; with all the defects and evils they now exhibit. Next,
in order to regain possession of the best of things, he resolved to
confine Man within his own exclusive domain. In order to detach him from
his protectress Achamoth, and from the celestial region, he forbade him
to eat of the Tree of Knowledge, which could reveal the mysteries and
confer on him the graces from above. But Achamoth, in order to defeat
his scheme, sent her own Genius, Ophis, in the form

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

of a serpent to induce him to transgress the commandment, and so to
break the Law of Jealousy. Though not so stated, it would appear that
the serpent-form was put on by Achamoth's minister in order to escape
the vigilance of Ildabaoth, under the disguise of his offspring Satan,
Ophiomorphos.

Enlightened by eating the forbidden fruit, Man became capable of
comprehending heavenly things. Nevertheless Ildabaoth was sufficiently
powerful to revenge himself, which he did by shutting up the First Pair
in the prison-house of Matter, that is, in the *body*, so unworthy of
his nature, wherein Man is still enthralled. Achamoth, however,
continued to protect him: she had extracted from his composition and
absorbed into herself the divine Spark of Light; and ceased not to
supply him therewith, and defend him in all his trials.

And of this there was full need. A new enemy had come into the field
against Man, the Genius Ophis whom Ildabaoth had seized, and punished
for his share in the affair of the Tree of Knowledge, by casting him
down into the Abyss; and who, contaminated by his immersion in Matter,
became converted into the exact image of his fellow-prisoner,
Ophiomorphos. The former was the type, the latter the antitype, and the
two are often confounded together. Thus we get a third dualism into the
scheme. Sophia and Sophia-Achamoth, Adam-Kadmon and Adam, Ophis and
Ophiomorphos. Ophis, at first Man's friend, now began to hate him as the
cause (though innocent) of his own degradation. With Ildabaoth, and his
Sons, he continually seeks to chain him to the body, by inspiring him
with all manner of corrupt desires, more especially earthly love and the
appetites. But Achamoth supplies Man with the divine Light, through
which he became sensible of his *Nakedness*, that is, of the misery of
his condition of imprisonment in this body of death, where his only
consolation is the hope of ultimate release.

But the seductions of Ildabaoth and his crew gained over all the
offspring of Adam, except Seth, the true type of the Spiritual Man: and
his posterity kept alive the seed of Light and the knowledge of divine
Truth throughout all the generations following. When they in the
Wilderness received

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

the commandments and institutions of Ildabaoth and his Sons, the
Planetary Genii, and afterwards the teaching of the Prophets, inspired
from the same source, Achamoth infused into their predictions something
higher, comprehended not even by their Lord, and made them preach the
advent of the Primal Man, the eternal Æon, the heavenly Christ. \[The
same notion was a favourite one with the Mediæval *Cathari*.\]

Achamoth was so afflicted at the condition of Man that she never rested
until she had prevailed on her mother, the celestial Sophia, to move
Bythos into sending down the Christ to the aid of the Spiritual Sons of
Seth. Ildabaoth himself had been caused to make ready the way for his
coming through his own minister, John the Baptist; in the belief that
the kingdom Christ came to establish was merely a *temporal* one: a
supposition fostered in him by the contrivance of Achamoth. Besides
inducing him to send the Precursor, she made him cause the birth of the
*Man* Jesus by the Virgin Mary; because the creation of a *material*
person could only be the work of the Demiurgus; not falling within the
province of a higher power. As soon as the Man Jesus was born, the
Christ, uniting himself with Sophia, descended through the seven
planetary regions, assuming in each an analogous form, thus concealing
his true nature from their presiding Genii, whilst he attracted into
himself the sparks of the divine Light they still retained in their
essence. \[These "analogous forms" are explained by the fact that the
Ophite Diagramma figured Michael as a *lion*, Suriel as a *bull*,
Raphael as a *serpent*, Gabriel as an *eagle*, Sabaoth as a *bear*,
Erataoth as a *dog*, Ouriel as an *ass*.\] In this manner the Christ
entered into the man Jesus at the moment of his baptism in the Jordan.
From this time forth Jesus began to work miracles; before that He had
been entirely ignorant of his own mission. But Ildabaoth at last
discovering that he was subverting his own kingdom upon earth, stirred
up the Jews against him, and caused him to be put to death. When he was
on the cross, the Christ and Sophia left his body, and returned to their
own place. Upon his death the Two took the Man Jesus, abandoned his
*Material* body to the earth, and gave him a new one made out of the
Æther. Thenceforth he consisted

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

merely of soul and spirit, which was the cause why the Disciples did not
recognise him after his resurrection. During his sojourn upon earth of
*eighteen* months after he had risen, he received from Sophia that
perfect knowledge, the true Gnosis, which he communicated to the small
portion of the Apostles who were capable of receiving the same. Thence,
ascending up into the Middle Space, he sat down upon the right hand of
Ildabaoth although unperceived by him, and there he is collecting all
souls that have been purified through the knowledge of Christ. When he
shall have collected all the Spiritual, all the Light, out of
Ildabaoth's empire, Redemption is accomplished and the end of the world
arrived: which means nothing else than the reabsorption of all Light
into the Pleroma from which it had originally descended.

The sect were divided in their opinions as to the nature of Ophis.
Although agreed that this genius was in the beginning the *minister* of
Achamoth, the Ophites of Theodoret's time held that he had been
converted into the enemy of Man; although by inducing him to break the
commandment of Ildabaoth he had proved the final cause of Man's
deliverance from his power. But all these nice distinctions, and
complicated machinery of Redemption were the invention of the later
schools: unknown to the sect described by Hippolytus. For the primitive
Ophites, retaining the Egyptian veneration for the Agathodæmon, regarded
their serpent, The Naas, as identical with either Sophia, or the Christ.
That writer says positively "the *Naas* (Hebrew, *Nachash*) is the
*only* thing they worship, whence they are denominated *Naaseni*. Even
two centuries later when Epiphanius wrote, they employed a living tame
serpent to encircle and consecrate the loaves that were to be eaten at
the Eucharistic supper. Again Tertullian has (In Præscript.) "Serpentem
magnificant in tantum ut etiam Christo præferant"--a passage that
suggests that their *ophis* was connected with the antique Solar Genius
of the Pharaonic religion. It was a peculiarity of the Egyptians that,
like the present Hindoos, they were divided, as it were, into sects,
each of which adopted some one deity out of the Pantheon for the
exclusive object of worship, paying no regard to all the

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

rest. As in modern Hindooism Vishnu and Siva have engrossed the religion
of the country, so in the Egypt of the first Christian century Anubis
and Cnuph had become the sole objects of Egyptian veneration, as the
monuments hereafter to be reviewed will abundantly evince.

To establish the identity of their Ophis with the Saviour, his followers
adduced the words of St. John, "For as Moses lifted up the serpent in
the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up." All this
proves that the section of the Ophites which regarded the serpent as
*evil* by its nature, had been led astray from the primitive doctrine of
their sect by the prevailing Zoroastrian and Jewish notions upon that
subject. The creed of the original Gnostics, the Naaseni, gave a very
different view of the nature of the serpent considered merely as a type;
a fact which shall be established in the section on the Agathodæmon
worship.

Epiphanius gives the following abstract of their doctrine to explain
their reverence for the serpent as the true author of divine
*knowledge*. "The Supreme Æon having produced other Æons, one of these,
a female, named Prunicos (*i.e.* *Concupiscence*), descended into the
waters of the abyss: whence, not being able to extricate herself, she
remained suspended in the Middle Space, being too much clogged by matter
to return above, and yet not sinking lower where there was nothing
cognate to her nature. In this condition she produced Ildabaoth, the God
of the Jews; and he in his turn seven Æons or Angels, who created the
seven heavens. From these seven Æons Ildabaoth shut up all that was
above, lest they should know of anything superior to himself. The seven
Æons then created Man in the image of their Father, but prone, and
crawling upon earth like a worm. But the Heavenly Mother, Prunicos,
wishing to deprive Ildabaoth of the power wherewith she had unadvisedly
invested him, infused into Man a celestial spark--the soul. Straightway
man rose up on his feet, soared in mind beyond the limits of the eight
spheres, and glorified the Supreme Father, Him who is above Ildabaoth.
Hence Ildabaoth, full of jealousy, cast down his eyes upon the lower
layer of Matter, and begat a Virtue, whom they call his Son. Eve,

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

listening to him as the Son of God, was easily persuaded to eat of the
Tree of Knowledge." Such is the brief summary of Ophite tenets, as given
by Epiphanius. The details of the elaborate system given in the
preceding pages are extracted from Theodoret who flourished half a
century later.
