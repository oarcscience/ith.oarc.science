### THE ABRAXAS RELIGION.

That most philosophic of the Fathers, Hippolytus, commences his account
of the systems of Basilides and his successors with this ingenious and
appropriate simile: "It behoves all their hearers, as they see that the
doctrines of these heretics are like unto a sea tossed into waves by the
fury of the winds, to sail by them without heeding them, and to look out
for the tranquil harbour for themselves. For that sea of theirs is both
full of monsters, and difficult to traverse, and may be likened unto the
Sicilian wherein are the fabled Cyclops, Charybdis and Scylla . . . and
the rock of the Syrens which the Grecian poets tell how Ulysses sailed
it past when he craftily baffled the cruelty of those inhospitable
monsters. For the Syrens singing clear and musically used to beguile all
sailing by, through the sweetness of their voice seducing them to cone
to land. Ulysses learning this is said io have stopped with wax the ears
of his crew, and having tied himself fast to the mast in this way sailed
past the Syrens and overheard all their song. Which same thing it is my
advice that all who fall in with these seducers should do, and either to
stop his ears, on account of his own weakness, so to sail by unheeded
the doctrines of heresies, without even listening to things too easily
capable of seducing him by their sweetness, like the melodious Syrens’
song, or else faithfully binding himself fast to the Tree of Christ to
listen to them without being shaken, putting his trust in that whereunto
he hath been tied, and stand fast without wavering."

The Abraxas Deity, his titles, nature and form already having been
discussed, it remains now to give a sketch of his great Apostle and his
doctrines. To begin with the earliest notice of them--

Clemens Alexandrinus lived in the same city, and in the same century,
with *Basilides*, the reputed founder of the Abraxas religion. During
some years of that period they were contemporaries, and it is more than
probable that Clemens was personally acquainted with Basilides--he being
a very remarkable personage of his times. On this account Clemens

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

testimony to the character of the Basilidan doctrine deserves infinitely
more reliance than the statements of the later Fathers; whilst at the
same time he passes a more judicious, and also a more favourable
judgment upon its nature. He describes the system as consisting in a
constant attention to the soul, and intercourse with the Deity
considered as the fountain of universal Love. In his own words, "The
Basilidan doctrine consists of *two* parts; the first part busies itself
with divine things, and considers what is the First Cause *through*
which all, and *without* which nothing is made; of what constitution are
the things that pervade, or include, each other: the forces which exist
in Nature, and unto what they tend. The other part relates to things
human, as to what is Man; what things be consistent or inconsistent with
his Nature, what he has to do and to suffer. In this department
Basilides includes Virtue and Vice; what is Good, what is Evil, and what
is Indifferent." In short we are here reminded of a description of a
Buddhist missionary. The amiable but fanciful Clemens, whose own
Christianity was no more than a graft upon the congenial stock of his
original Platonism, could see very little to blame in the transcendental
speculations of Basilides. In his eyes the latter was not a *heretic*,
that is, an innovator upon the accepted doctrines of the Catholic
Church, but only a theosophic speculator who sought to express old
truths by new formulæ, and perhaps to combine the same with the new
faith, the divine authority of which he was able to admit without
renouncing his own creed--precisely as is the case with the learned
Hindoos of our own day.

But far different is the picture of Basilides, as drawn by the pen of
bigoted orthodoxy in the two next centuries, after his doctrines had
been taken up and carried out to monstrous precision by the swarms of
semi-Christian sects that sprung up in the very bosom of the Church.
These notices are subjoined in chronological order, for they give in a
few words the grand features of the perfected system. Hippolytus has
left an excellent analysis of the Basilidan doctrine, well deserving of
[careful](errata.htm#15.md) study, although it is hard to see how it bears
out the assertion at the opening, that this *heretic* took his entire
system

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

ready made from Aristotle, with his *genus*, *species* and *individual*,
but pretended to have received the same from St. Matthew, who had
communicated to him the esoteric doctrines which he alone had received
from Christ when on earth. The philosophic Bishop, however, is mild in
censure; nay, seems rather captivated by the ingenuity of the
Alexandrine mystic. But Tertullian, with no sense of the beauty of a
clever piece of sophistry, launches out like a true African barrister:
"After this, Basilides the heretic broke loose. He asserted that there
was a Supreme God named Abraxas, by whom was created Mind whom the
Greeks call *Nous*. From Mind proceeded the Word, from the Word,
Providence; from Providence, Virtue and Wisdom; from these two again,
Virtues, Principalities and Powers were made; from these infinite
productions and emissions of Angels. By these Angels the 365 heavens
were created. Amongst the lowest Angels, indeed, and those who made this
world, he sets last of all the god of the Jews, whom he denies to be
God, affirming that he is one of the Angels." Similarly the still later
Jerome has (*Amos III.*): "So Basilides, who called Almighty God by the
portentous name of *Abraxas*, saying that the same word according to
Greek numeration, and the sum of his annual revolution, are contained in
the circle of the Sun, whom the heathen taking the same amount but
expressed in different numerical letters call *Mithras;* him whom the
simple Iberians worship under the names of *Balsamus* (*Baal-samen*,
"Lord of heaven") and *Barbelus* ("Son of Baal"). And that this wondrous
title *Abraxas* had long before been applied to the Sun-god in the
formulæ of The Mysteries may be inferred from various incidental
allusions of ancient writers. Thus Theosebius the philosopher (says
Photius, in his 'Life of Isidorus') drove a devil out of a woman by
merely invoking over her "the *Rays of the Sun*, and the Name of the God
of the Hebrews." The same explanation is much supported by the words of
Augustine: "Basilides asserted the number of heavens to be 365, the
number of the days in the year. For this reason he used to glorify a
*Holy Name*, as it were, that is the word Abraxas, the letters in which,
taken according to the Greek method of computation, make up this
number."

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

The Basilidan doctrine of "Emanation" was greatly refined upon by
Valentinus, whose muster-roll of the celestial hierarchy shall be given
in its proper place. Suffice it here to observe that the entire theory
resembles the Brahminical; for in that theogony each Manifestation of
the One Supreme Being, regarded by the vulgar as a separate
self-existing deity, has a *female partner* the exact counterpart of
himself, *through* whom, as through an instrument, he exerts his
power--to express which doctrine this other half is styled his *Durga*,
"Active Virtue." This last name, "Virtue," actually figures in all the
Gnostic lists of Emanations; and the great Æon, Pistis-Sophia, in her
second "Confession" perpetually upbraids herself for having quitted her
male Σύςυχος, *partner*, in her proper habitation, to go in quest of the
Supernal Light: whilst she equally reproaches *him* for not descending
into Chaos to her aid. The system of Dualism, in fact, pervades the
whole of that wondrous revelation.

Brahminical inspiration is possible in many other points of the doctrine
of Basilides, as will appear by the following extracts from
Irenæus--whose judgment was not warped, like that of Hippolytus, by the
mania for deriving his system from the Aristotelian. Basilides
(according to him) lived at Alexandria under Trajan and Hadrian (the
first half of the second century), and commenced life as a student of
the *Oriental Gnosis*--an epithet sufficiently indicating the source of
that philosophy. Being converted to Christianity he attempted, like many
others, to combine his new faith with his old, for the explanation of
things both spiritual and natural. To do this he invented a terminology
and symbolism of his own. In the promulgation of his peculiar notions
concerning God and the Divine attributes--the Word, the Creation, the
Emanation of spirits and worlds, the Architect of the universe, and the
multifarious forces of Nature--he took the same road with his
contemporary Saturninus in Syria. His system was a combination of
Christian, Jewish, Persian and Egyptian notions, but the entire
coin-position was moulded by the spirit of the Oriental Gnosis. These
tenets their author zealously promulgated. For many years he taught in
the school of Alexandria; he was also a most prolific writer. Clemens
says he published twenty-four

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

volumes of "Interpretations upon the Gospels," besides "Odes" and
"Spiritual Songs"; all of which have perished. The doctrines he thus
disseminated his contemporary Irenæus represents in the following
manner:--

"Basilides in order to invent something more refined and plausible in
the Gnostic speculative philosophy pushed his investigations even into
the Infinite. He asserted that God, the uncreated eternal Father, first
brought forth *Nous* or Mind; and Mind, the *Logos*, Word; this in turn,
*Phronesis*, Intelligence; whence came forth *Sophia*, Wisdom, and
*Dynamis*, Strength." Irenæus understands Basilides as making a
Quinternion of Beings or Personal Intelligences *external* to the
Godhead: but Bellermann with more reason takes them as signifying
personified *attributes* of the Supreme *forms* of his working
internally and externally. According to this explanation Basilides would
only have borrowed his system from the Kabbala; it is however equally
likely that he drew the whole from a much more distant source, and that
his "Untreated" and "Quinternion" stand in truth for the *First* Buddha
and the successive *Five*.

"When the uncreated eternal Father beheld the corruption of mankind, he
sent his Firstborn, Nous, into the world in the form of Christ, for the
redeeming of all that believe in him out of the power of those who
fabricated the world--namely, the Demiurgus and his Six sons, the
planetary Genii. Nous appeared amongst men as the Man Jesus, and wrought
miracles. This Christ did not die in person, but Simon the Cyrenian, to
whom he lent his bodily form, suffered in his stead; inasmuch as the
Divine Power, the Nous of the Eternal Father, is not corporeal, and
therefore cannot *die*. Whoso therefore maintains that Christ has died
is still the bondman of *Ignorance*, but whoso denies the same, he is a
freeman, and hath understood the purpose of the Father." From this tenet
the Basilidans got the opprobrious title of "Docetae" (*Illusionists*).
Similarly the pious Brahmins explain away all such of their legends as
are inconsistent with our notions of divine dignity by making them all
"Maya" (*illusion*). The same is also the doctrine of the Koran (Cap.
iv.) upon this point: "And for that they have not believed upon Jesus,
and have spoken against Mary a

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

grievous calumny, and have said, Verily we have slain Christ Jesus, the
Son of Mary, the apostle of God; yet they slew him not, neither
crucified him, but he was represented by one in his likeness; and verily
they were disagreed concerning him, were in a doubt as to this matter,
and had no true knowledge thereof, but followed only an uncertain
opinion. They did not really kill him, but God took him up unto himself,
and God is mighty and wise."

The system just described coincides to a remarkable degree with the
Brahminical, where the First Principle produces in succession the Five
Powers--Mahasiva, Sadasiva, Rudra, Vishnu and Brahma--who are held by
some for mere *attributes* of the Godhead; by others are taken in a
materialistic sense for Æther, Air, Fire, Water, Earth. But possibly, as
Mosheim so long ago maintained, the whole Gnostic system is derived, not
from the Kabbala, nor from the Greek philosophy, but from the theosophy
of the Brahmins.

Another circumstance in the Basilidan practice, mentioned by Irenaeus,
will receive abundant illustration from the study of these talismans.
"Furthermore the sect have invented *proper names* for these Angels, and
class them under the *first*, *second*, *third* heavens, and so on.
Besides this, they endeavour to explain the names, origin, powers, and
Æons of their pretended 365 heavens--similarly they give its own name to
the terrestrial sphere, which they say the saviour (whom they call
*Kavlacav*) has visited, and then abandoned. Who understands this
rightly and knows the Æons with their respective names, the same shall
be *invisible* unto, and beyond the power of, those Æons, in the same
manner as the Saviour Kavlacav himself was. As the Son of God remained
unknown in the World, so must also the disciple of Basilides remain
unknown to the rest of mankind, as they know all this, and nevertheless
must live amongst strangers, therefore must they conduct themselves
towards the rest of the world as beings invisible and unknown. Hence
their motto, 'Learn to know all, but keep thyself unknown,'--and for
this cause they are accustomed to deny the fact of their being
Basilidans. Neither can they be detected as Christian heretics, because
they assimilate themselves to all

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

sects. Their secret constitution however is known to but a few, perhaps
to one in a thousand or two in ten thousand. The local situation of
their 365 heavens they parcel out just like land-surveyors. Their
doctrine is contained in a sacred book, and likewise in *Symbolic
Figures*. The Supreme Lord, the Head of all things, they call *Abrasax*,
which name contains the number 365."

So much virtue being involved in a perfect knowledge of the names of the
Æons, it would be unpardonable not to subjoin them, as far as they can
possibly be procured at present and, the following may be taken for
their most authoritative roll-call, having been drawn up by Valentinus
himself, the profoundest doctor of the Gnosis, and who had elaborated to
the highest degree the system first sketched out by Basilides. He
arranges there in pairs, male and female, in the order of their
successive emanation from Bythos, the pre-existing, eternal Principle.
The number of pairs is *fifteen*, or the sacred number Five three times
repeated. Their names, it will be seen, are Hebrew words, the va
preceding some of the female powers being merely the copulative "and."
Matter supposes Valentinus to have been of Jewish origin, although born
at Alexandria. Tertullian states that he was first of all a Platonist,
then a convert to Christianity, but having been disappointed in his
aspirations to a bishopric he founded a religion of his own.

Epiphanius has evidently copied one pair (5) twice over,

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

misled by a slight difference of spelling, and thus adds one pair to the
proper fifteen.

It will be very instructive to compare this Valentinian system of
Emanation, which makes all to proceed in pairs, male and female, out of
the First Cause, with that Indian theosophy which this very feature
indicates as its real source, in the latter, every Principle is divided
into a male and female Energy, each exactly alike the other--"the same,
distinguished by their sex alone." Each deity exerts his power through
the agency of his female Principle or *Sacti*, which in turn possesses a
*Váhan* "vehicle," that is an instrument or attribute, which is fixed
and represented in a material form. Of the Persons in the Supreme Triad
the Sactis and their Váhans <span id="fr_148"></span>[\*](#fn_147.md)
are:--

1\. Of Brahma, Saraswati, goddess of harmony and the arts (the Jewish
*Wisdom*); her váhan is a swan, or goose. (Hence Juno's Capitoline bird,
afterwards explained by an historical fiction.)

2\. Of Vishnu, Lakshmi, goddess of Prosperity, she has the title of
Kamalá, "lotus-bearer;" her váhan is Garuda, the man-eagle. Vishnu in
one Avatár takes the name "Varáha," and his consort "Varáhi," in which
case her váhan is a buffalo.

3\. Of Siva, the Changer or Destroyer, the Sacti is Bhaváni, goddess of
*fecundity*, and consequently of *death*, for the first implies the
second "Nascentes morimur, finisque ab origine pendet."

Nothing perishes, things only take a new form called by the *ignorant*
Death. (Compare the title "Gods of death," which the Ophites were so
fond of giving to the "Gods of the Nativity," the astral genii ruling
the horoscope). Bhaváni's appropriate vehicles are the Bull, emblem of
generation, and the Tiger, of destruction.

And before going further I cannot resist observing how these names and
symbols manifest the far-spreading influence of the nations they embody.
The Sassanian queens in their gem

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

portraits generally bear the lotus in the hand, <span
id="fr_149"></span>[\*](#fn_148.md) "Varanes" is a common name for the
kings of that line, and the Brahminic Bull, the commonest of all signet
devices with their subjects. But as the dominions of the later Persian
kings extended as far as the Indus, Hindoo princesses doubtless entered
their harems and communicated their own religion to their children.

Again, many of these Sanscrit titles bear a resemblance, certainly not
accidental, to words frequently occurring in the Gnostic inscriptions.
Thus, "Sumitri," wife of Vishnu in his seventh Avatar may explain
Σουμαρτα; and "Nátha," a title of Vishnu and Crishna, the equally common
Ναυτιτα; "Isa," lord, feminine, "Isi," *lady*, is perhaps even the
origin of *Isis;* and "Nila," *dark-blue*, and epithet of Parvati, is
more appropriately transferred to Father Nilus. Vishnu in infancy as
Narayana floating in his "Vat," leaf boat over the face of the waters,
and coloured all over *blue*, may be compared to the child Horus wafted
in the *baris*. The most ancient of all creeds having, as above shown,
made the lotus the symbol of Plenty, the reason becomes obvious for the
introduction of its seed-vessels, always mistaken for poppyheads,
amongst the wheatears in the cornucopia of Ceres.

The above quoted Σουμαρτα seems to have been applied by the Gnostics to
the Sun-god, for Montfaucon gives (Pl. 157) a figure of Sol so
inscribed, with χεροῦβι on the reverse, a manifest invocation to all the
angelic host. And as the protection of this celestial hierarchy is so
perpetually sought by our talisman-makers in their "voluntary humility
and worshipping of angels," I subjoin the names of the Hindoo Guardians
of the "Jehabs," quarters of the world, which may perhaps lurk in their
Grecised form amongst these interminable strings of titles.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[264:\*](gar40.htm#fr_148.md) It might even be
suggested that Indian influence shines through the whole Apocalypse. The
Four Beasts (borrowed it is true from the First Vision of Ezekiel) are
these Whams, ministers of the Divine Will. Later times assigned each to
an evangelist. The Four-and-twenty Elders had their prototypes in the
Saints to the same number of the Buddhist theology; the "sea of glass or
crystal" is the vast crystal block suspended in the highest heaven, the
shrine of the Supreme Being; absorption into whom is the true object of
the believer.
