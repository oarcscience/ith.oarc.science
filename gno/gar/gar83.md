### PLATE L.

### MITHRAIC (*continued*).

1\. The Mithraic Lion, moving through the stars of heaven. The reverse
exhibits a complete assemblage of the *Siglæ* that are found, dispersed,
upon so many talismans. That they stand for the names of deities and
astral Powers may be guessed from the fact that Mohammedans still
express *Allah* by a circle filled up with diagonal lines.

2\. Lion-headed Man, doubtless a *Leonticus* (one of the grades in the
Mithraic Mysteries), uttering, with uplifted hand, the inexplicable
adjuration, "O, Centaur of God, Thou match for a hundred \[demons\]!"
Here ἑκατοντομάχος is formed after the analogy of μονομάχος, "a match
for one."

3\. A *Mobed* (Zoroastrian priest or *Magus*) performing his nocturnal
devotions before an altar, on which are set up various *sacra*, amongst
which may be recognised the regular insignia of his profession, the
Sword and the Divining-rods. Engraved upon the base of a calcedony cone,
an early form of the signet in Assyria.

4\. Horus, the Vernal Sun-god, making the gesture of adoration, his whip
resting upon his left arm. He is seated upon the seed-vessel of the
lotus, that aptest symbol of the Universe, in virtue of its, innumerable
contents. In the long, clearly-cut legend that fills the exergue, no
hitherto-explained formulæ are to be recognised.
