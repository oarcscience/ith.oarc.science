<p>Sabaoth, Abraxas;" He, <i>i.e.</i> the living God, protect Aparastathe, the bearer of this talisman. Similar formul&aelig;, always attached to women's names, very frequently occur.</p>  
<p>2. The Zoroastrian <i>Dog</i>, of whom and whose office so much has been said in the text. The ill-cut Bird is intended for the Raven, the usual Mithraic attribute.</p>  
<p>3. The Lion of Baal, the Syrian Sun-god; below, the Scarab&aelig;us typifying the Creative Power.

L&eacute;vy quotes an agate scarab&aelig;us at the British Museum exactly similar to this gem (a fine sard), a proof of the popularity of both type and name.</p>  
<p>4. A unique talismanic device, converting a male Sphinx into a novel bird, by the addition of the legs of a crane and the tail of a scorpion. It is engraved in the Persian style: my motive for admitting it into the present class.</p>

<p>6. The Sun-god, with radiated head, mounted upon a camel, typifying the East. Below is set the fire-altar of Mithraic worship. He is followed by Chanticleer, attribute of the god of Day, preceded by the Horse--his peculiar sacrifice, as Ovid tells us:--</p>
