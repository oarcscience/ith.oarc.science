### INDIAN SOURCES OF GNOSTICISM.--MANES.

The *Persian* origin of so considerable a portion of the Gnosis having
been set forth in the foregoing pages, it remains to show what portion
is due to a purely *Indian* source, and to indicate the channels through
which a direct intercourse was carried on between the farthest east and
the foci of Gnosticism, Alexandria and Ephesus. For the Christian Gnosis
was indirectly the daughter of the Hindoo Gnosis, such as it was taught
in the various mysteries; possibly in the Eleusinian and the Phrygian.
For universal tradition made the first founder of mysteries, Bacchus,
bring them direct from India; and Jove's μῆρος, the fabled birth-place
of the god, may have been no other than Mount *Meru*, the Olympus of the
Hindoo Pantheon. <span id="fr_8"></span>[\*](#fn_8.md)

Certain Gnostic tenets concerning the duality of the Divine emanations,
absorption into the god-head, asceticism, penance, and self-collection,
are identical with the Buddhistic teaching upon the same points; of
which agreement several remarkable examples will be adduced in their
fitting place. But we are not left to mere conjecture on this point, for
the actual circumstances of their importation from India are minutely
detailed, in one case that doubtless had many parallels, by the
laborious Epiphanius in his "Life of Manes," (Hæres. lxv.). <span
id="fr_9"></span>[†](#fn_9.md)

This celebrated heresiarch, equally abhorrent to Zoroastrian and
Christian orthodoxy, was by birth a Persian, named Cubricus; but who
upon commencing his mission assumed the title of *Manes*, signifying in
the Babylonian tongue "The Vessel," for the same reason, we may suppose,
that Dante gives to St. Paul the epithet "Vas Electionis." This Cubricus
had

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

been slave, and subsequently sole heir, to a certain wealthy widow who
had inherited all the effects belonging to one Terminthus, surnamed in
*Assyrian* "Buddas." This Terminthus had similarly been the slave of a
rich Saracen merchant, Scythicus, who had studied the Greek language and
literature in some place on the borders of Palestine (perhaps the school
of Palmyra), and who "had there attained to eminence in the empty
learning of this world." By constant journeys between his home and
*India*, this Scythicus had amassed a large fortune. With this he
settled down in Hypsele in the Thebaid, where he married a beautiful
courtezan, whom he had bought and emancipated. "Here, out of sheer
idleness and licentiousness, he set up to preach new doctrines, not
derived from Scripture but from mere human reason."

These doctrines, from the nature of the case, can hardly have been of
his own concoction, but, in all probability, things that he had picked
up in India, where all the ancient emporia lay on the Guzerat Coast, the
seat of the powerful Jaina (Buddhist) monarchy. A mere Eastern trader, a
common Arab merchant who, after making his fortune by long and dangerous
travels in the East, who could afterwards in advanced life set himself
down to study, nay more, to attain *proficiency* in the Greek
philosophy, must have been a man of no ordinary intellect. Assuredly it
was not the mere want of anything better to do, (as his malicious
biographer asserts), that made him turn preacher of a new religion. His
marriage with the enfranchised courtezan looks like a theological
addition, added to the portrait for the sake of so completing his
resemblance to Simon Magus. The nature of the doctrines he was likely to
imbibe in the great Indian marts, Baroche, Barcellore, Pultaneh, or in
the semi-Grecian cities of Bactria, is attested to this day by the
innumerable *Buddhist* temples and topes, with their deposit of relics
yet studding the provinces this side of the Indus; and whose contents
declare the flourishing state of that religion even when the country had
passed under the rule of the Sassanian Kings of Persia.

But to return to Scythicus in his retirement: "Taking Pythagoras for
guide, he composed four books, namely, 'The

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mysteries,' 'The
Summary,' 'The Gospel,' and 'The Treasuries.'" (Pythagoras was then
universally believed to have visited India, and there to have obtained
the elements of his philosophy, which has a certain Brahminical
character.) "After this, Scythicus made a journey to Jerusalem in the
very times of the Apostles, and held conferences with the elders of the
church upon the Origin of Evil, and such like points. But not being
satisfied by their explanations, he took to preaching magic, the
knowledge of which he had gotten along with his other wares from the
*Indians* and *Egyptians*. But as he was showing off a miracle upon the
roof of his house, he fell down and was killed. Upon this, his servant
and sole disciple, Terminthus, instead of returning to his mistress at
Hypsele, ran off with his money into Persia, where, in order to escape
detection, he assumed the name of *Buddas*, which signifies "Wise."
(This last fact proves incontestably the nature of the doctrines he and
his master had been gathering up in their Indian travels; and the truth
lying at the bottom of this story seems to be that he gave himself out
for a *fresh incarnation* of Buddha, of which there had been
*seven* <span id="fr_10"></span>[\*](#fn_10) before his date..md)

"This Terminthus was himself a man of learning and conversant with his
master's four treatises. He lodged in the house of a widow, where he
used to hold conferences with the priests of Mithras, especially with
two, Parcus and Labdacus, upon the Two Principles, and similar subjects.
He, too, having been killed by *accident*, like his master, his landlady
kept possession of all his baggage, religious books included; and in her
turn bequeathed them to her servant Cubricus, the afterwards so
celebrated Manes."

It is necessary here to point out a certain violent anachronism in the
story as told by Epiphanius. If Scythicus visited Jerusalem at all, he
must have done so *before* the year of its destruction, A.D. 70. His
disciple, Terminthus, could therefore not have survived far into the
second century. The landlady of the latter could for this reason have
hardly had for slave Manes, who flourished about two hundred years
later. It is,

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

however, possible that the works plagiarised by Manes had been preserved
in her *family* down to the period of his service in it.

In this history of Scythicus, however disguised by tradition, we have at
one view the complete history of the rise and progress of Gnosticism. We
find an Arab merchant of a subtle and inquiring mind, occupying himself
during his long and frequent sojourns at the Indian marts in studying
the philosophy of these prevailing religionists, the speculations of the
Buddhist monks, and equally investigating the secrets of the "wisdom of
Egypt," when detained at the other headquarters of the Eastern trade.
Then retiring from business, he goes to Palmyra for the purpose of
studying Grecian philosophy, as then taught in its school, which
philosophy would be no other than Neo-Platonism; thence returning home,
he occupies his leisure in reducing to one harmonious system the
numerous conflicting theories upon subjects too high for human
knowledge, which he had so laboriously collected from the three great
fountains of philosophy--India, Egypt, and Athens.

Finally attracted by the fame of a new religion that professed to throw
the clearest light upon all things relating to God and Man, being
preached at Jerusalem, he immediately starts for the *focus* of this new
light, leaving behind him wife and property, only accompanied by one
servant, himself an educated man, and his own treasured theological
speculations. On his arriving at the Holy City, we find him (as might be
expected from his previous training) grievously disappointed in his
hopes of at last obtaining the solution of all the problems that had so
long occupied his thoughts--for on subjects of that kind the Christian
Presbyters could tell no more than what he had learnt already from the
*Rabbis* of Alexandria, or the Jaina monks of Guzerat. Thus
disappointed, he appears to have set up himself for a teacher of a new
and higher doctrine, supporting his pretensions (after the customary
fashion of the times) by miracle-working; and as a matter of course
getting his career speedily cut short, for Jerusalem was not the place
where a new religion would be promulgated with impunity by a single
individual,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

and that too an *Arabian*. His disciple, Terminthus, taking warning by
his fate, resolves to try another school of profound wisdom, formed from
time immemorial, but as yet unvisited by his master, and proceeds to
hold discussion with the Wise Men of the East at their head college in
Babylon, seeking for the final solution of his difficulties in the
doctrine of Zoroaster. It is very probable that he, as the result of
this study, engrafted upon the system of Scythicus whatever features of
the Zendavesta appeared to him the most satisfactory, and consistent
best with his preconceived ideas of the truth. It would be interesting
to know whether he shaped all these fresh acquisitions into conformity
with the original Indian groundwork of his master's system. As already
observed, such appears to have been his course from the title that he
assumed, declaring himself an eighth "Buddha," successor to the famous
Guatama, founder of the religion, and like him commissioned to teach a
new way of salvation. Terminthus, like his master, came to an untimely
end. The Magi were not members of a powerful establishment who would
suffer themselves to be puzzled and confuted by an over-wise foreigner,
disputing so boldly--

"Of Providence, foreknowledge, will, and Fate,  
Fixed Fate, freewill, foreknowledge absolute,"

still less to allow him to go off exulting in his victory, as his
asserted follower Manes likewise found to his cost.

Manes himself appears to have belonged to the order of Magi (probably
being admitted after gaining his freedom and changing his name), for he
is reported to have been famous for his skill in astrology, medicine,
magic, and *painting!* This last is curious; it shows that the Magi,
like the mediæval monks, monopolised the arts as well as the sciences of
their times. Whether he conceived the scheme from the accidental
acquisition of the writings of Scythicus or not (M. Matter supposes him
to have got his first inspiration from some Egyptian Basilidan who had
found his way into Persia), certain it is that he first gave to these
notions a definite shape, and constructed his system with such skill
that it spread not merely all over the East but throughout Europe. In
the latter region its importance

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

is evinced by the fact (mentioned incidentally by Ammianus) that
Constantine himself, before finally changing his religion, following the
Apostolical precept "Try all things, hold fast that which is good,"
carefully studied the Manichæan system under the guidance of the learned
Musonianus, whom we must suppose to have been a great doctor of the
sect. <span id="fr_11"></span>[\*](#fn_11.md) Nay more, this religion,
after long seeming extinction from the pertinacious persecution of the
Byzantine emperors, again blazed forth with extraordinary lustre in the
Paulicianism of the Middle Ages.

The grand purpose of the scheme of Manes was the *reconcilement* of the
two religions, which had by that time come to dispute the empire of the
world--the flourishing, though still unrecognised Christianity of Rome,
and the equally vigorous but newly revived Zoroastrism of Sassanian
Persia. Calling himself the "Promised Paraclete," Manes accepted the
gospel, but only after purifying it from all taint of Judaism, whilst he
utterly rejected the Old Testament. But whilst Zoroaster makes all to
*begin* in the *harmony*, and to *end* in the mutual reconciliation of
the Two Principles, Manes declares these Two Principles immutable and
existent from all eternity as they shall continue for ever to exist. His
*Good* is Zoroaster's "Lord of Light"; but his *Bad* is Satan-Matter,
deliverance from whose bondage is to be obtained only through the
strictest asceticism. From the Christian Church he borrowed its
institution of presbyters and deacons, being sensible how greatly that
organisation had conduced to its rapid development, and in his own
enterprise it met with almost equal success. Manes was a genuine
Pantheist, teaching that God pervaded all things, even plants (of which
tenet I subjoin a singular illustration from his once ardent follower,
St. Augustine); he also adopted the entire theory of Emanations, exactly

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

as it was defined in the older Gnostic systems. St. Augustine's words
are ('Confessions' iii. 10): "And I, not understanding this, used to
mock at those holy servants and prophets of thine. <span
id="fr_12"></span>[\*](#fn_12.md) And what was I doing when I mocked at
them, except that I myself was mocked at by thee, being seduced gently
and by degrees into such absurdities as to believe that the fig weeps
when it is plucked, and likewise its parent tree, with tears of milk?
Which same fig, however, should any holy man eat, that is to say, after
it has been plucked through the *sin* of another, not by his own, he
would mingle with his bowels, and breathe out of it *angels*, nay more,
particles of God himself, in his sighs and eructations whilst praying,
which same particles of the Supreme and True God would have been bound
up in that fruit, had they not been set at liberty by the tooth and
stomach of the chosen saint; and I, like a wretch, believed that greater
compassion ought to be shown unto the fruits of the earth than to man,
for whose sake they were created. For if any one not a Manichæan, being
an hungered, should ask for the same, it would have been thought a
crime, worthy of capital punishment, if a single mouthful thereof were
given to him." Compare the following rule of the Buddhist priesthood:
"They will not kill any animal, neither root up nor cut any plant,
because they think it has life." ('Ayeen Akbari,' p. 435.)

Manes invented a theory of salvation, so very whimsical that it ought to
be inserted here, to recreate the wanderer in this dreary and dusky
theological labyrinth. "When the Son came into the world to effect the
redemption of mankind, he contrived a machine containing twelve bowls
(cadi), <span id="fr_13"></span>[†](#fn_13.md) which being made to revolve
by the motion of the spheres, attracts into itself the souls of the
dying. These the *Great Luminary* (the sun) takes and purifies with his
rays, and then transfers to the moon; and this is the method whereby the
*disk*, as we call it, of the moon is replenished." Epiphanius
triumphantly refutes this theory

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

by asking how the moon's disk was replenished during the nine hundred
years that elapsed after the Creation before any deaths took place?

But the career of this inventive heresiarch was speedily brought to a
close. The Persian king, Varanes I. (about the year 275), alarmed by the
rapid spread of these new doctrines, convoked a General Council of the
Magi to sit in judgment upon them; by whom the unlucky apostle was
pronounced a heretic, and a traitor to his own brethren, and sentenced
to be flayed alive.
