### THE SCHEME OF THE OPHITES.

Gnostic symbols, with their uses in this life and in that to come have
thus far been the subject of our investigation; which naturally leads us
to consider the ideas that their devisers entertained of the
constitution of the next world and of the nature of the soul itself. As
to the former of these deeply interesting questions, the Gnosis
specially laboured to afford the exactest information to its disciples;
and in this class the one preserved by Origen (in Celsum vi.), leaves
nothing to be desired in point of fulness, and may confidently be
accepted as the most authoritative of all such celestial *cartes de
route*.

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

This learned Father had, by some means or other, become possessed of a
parchment chart on which were depicted the successive stages of the
soul's heavenward journey, with the several *Powers* <span
id="fr_203"></span>[\*](#fn_201.md) it must encounter in its flight, and
the proper invocations (specimens of which I have already given) whereby
it should extort permission to traverse their dominions. This chart was
known to the faithful as the "Schema, or Diagramma, of the Ophites."
Amongst these invocations the one addressed to Iao, genius of the moon,
is peculiarly important as illustrating the use of the most numerous
class of the talismans we are considering. "O thou that presidest over
the mysteries of the Father and of the Son, Iao who shinest in the
night, who holdest the second place, the First Lord of Death, who makest
part of that which is without God! In presenting to thee thine own
*memorial* (or likeness) as a token (or passport) I swiftly traverse thy
domain after having conquered through the Word of Life that which was
born of Thee." The MSS. read τὸν ἰδίον ὑπὸ νοῦν σύμβολον, which has no
meaning, but can only be the corruption of τὴν ἰδίαν ὑπονοῖαν, a word
often used by Plutarch in the sense of symbol. Now what else could this
"memorial" of Iao be but his own image engraved in gems? This deity is
styled "Lord of Death," because the moon (Isis) presides over the birth,
development and change, of which death is the necessary consequence, of
things terrestrial.

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

Of the theory therein embodied, much was evidently derived from the same
source as the Neo-Platonic doctrine concerning the planetary origin of
the soul's faculties, which shall be related further on: The chart
itself was founded on that essential doctrine of Gnosticism, that the
soul, released from the body, mounted upwards, eager for absorption into
the Infinite Godhead, or "Boundless Light," that *summum bonum* of
Oriental aspiration (the Buddist Nirwana "perfect Repose, the Epicurean
*Indolentia*"); but on its way was obliged to traverse the successive
regions of the planets, each ruled by its presiding genius. These genii
were of a nature somewhat *material*, and therefore malignant, and in
this respect corresponding to the Seven Devs, Ahriman's ministers, who
according to Zoroaster are chained each to his own planet. To obtain the
indispensable permission of transit, a different adjuration to each
Power was required; all which have been already given from Origen's copy
of the Chart. Their *names* were put down therein, as Adonai, genius of
the Sun, Iao of the Moon, Eloi of Jupiter, Sabao of Mars, Orai of Venus,
Astaphai of Mercury, and Ildabaoth of Saturn. <span
id="fr_204"></span>[\*](#fn_202.md)

All these names are to be read, more or less commonly, upon our
talismans, although probably used there in a different sense from that
accepted by the author of the Diagramma. The Jewish angels Michael,
Gabriel, Surid, Raphael, Thantabaoth, and Erataoth, were likewise
inscribed as names of the genii presiding over the constellations, the
Bear, Serpent, Eagle, Lion, Dog, Bull. These notions are manifestly of
Magian root, acquired by the Jews during the long period that their
country was a province of the Persian Empire, and had grown into an
essential article of religion.

St. Paul found it needful to warn his flock against the "worshipping of
Angels;" nevertheless, the adoration and the multiplication of their
names went on augmenting to that pitch, that a Council held under Pope
Zachary reduced them, as objects of worship to three only, Michael,
Gabriel, Raphael.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This retrenchment
of the heavenly host was endorsed by a capitulary of Charlemagne's
issued from Aix-la-Chapelle. In the Diagram under consideration, Michael
was typified by a lion, Suriel by an ox, Raphael by a serpent, Gabriel
by an eagle, Thantabaoth by a bear, Onioth or Zartaoth by an ass.

The reward promised to the Angel of the Church at Thyatira (Rev. ii.
28), "And I will give him the Morning Star," seems to be connected with
the same belief in the Planetary Presidents. Dante, in his Paradiso,
going doubtless upon old tradition, makes Mercury the abode of spirits
moved to glorious deeds in life by the love of fame; Venus, of true
lovers; Luna, of theologians; Mars, of martyrs for the Faith; Jupiter of
good princes; Saturn of such as have led a contemplative and recluse
life.

The above-quoted names of the Planetary Genii were in the Jewish
religion either titles and attributes of the Most High, or else of his
chief ministering spirits; but in the Gnostic *Scheme* they had been
degraded from their high estate, and reduced into secondary deities of a
mixed nature, partaking of good as well as of evil, yet all equally
anxious to win souls from Abraxas, the proper lord and creator of the
universe. The only explanation for such a misapplication of the sacred
titles is a very brief one; these semi-Buddhist philosophers who found
the root of all evil in Matter, and consequently in the *material*
creation, employed these old hallowed names to denote the agents of the
Creator, who on account of this their office were regarded as mere
demons; and by an exactly similar process they are found
misappropriating the most sacred names of the Christian revelation. But
of this blasphemous perversion and wanton desecration of the ancient
terminology no trace is to be discovered upon our talismans, their
makers belonging to the Kabbalistic School of Alexandria, which
reconciling Moses with Zoroaster, continued to employ these appellations
in their primary time-honoured sense.

The source of this notion concerning the Planetary Rulers can be traced
very far back. The power of Ildabaoth, or Saturn, and his sons over the
soul, as well as the astrological notion about the influence of the
stars over man's destiny, are

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

clearly part and parcel of what the Alexandrian Platonists had taught
concerning the planetary origin of the soul and its faculties, thus
expounded by Macrobius (Som. Scip. i. 12): "The soul on its descent from
the One and Indivisible source of its being in order to be united to the
body, passes through the Milky Way into the Zodiac at their intersection
in Cancer and Capricorn, called the Gates of the Sun, because the two
solstices are placed in these signs. Through Cancer, the 'Gate of Man,'
the soul descends upon Earth, the which is *spiritual death*. Through
Capricorn, the 'Gate of the Gods,' it reascends up into heaven; its new
birth taking place upon its release from the body. So soon as the soul
has left Cancer and the Milky Way, it begins to lose its divine nature,
and arriving at Leo enters upon the first phase of its future condition
here below. During its downward progress, the soul, at first a *sphere*
in form, is elongated into a *cone*, and now begins to feel the
influence of Matter, so that on joining the body it is intoxicated and
stupefied by the novel draught. This condition is typified by the Crater
of Bacchus placed in the heavens between Cancer and Leo.

"The soul thus descending, as it passes through each sphere receives
successive *coatings*, as it were, of a luminous body, and is furnished
at the same time with the several faculties it has to exercise during
its probation upon Earth. Accordingly, in Saturn, it is supplied with
reason and intelligence; in Jupiter, with the power of action; in Mars,
with the irascible principle; in the Sun, with sensation and
speculation; in Venus, with the appetites; in Mercury, with the means of
declaring and expressing thoughts; in the Moon, with the faculty of
generating and augmenting the body." Hence, as the Planets contain all
the elements that, so to speak, make up the Inner Man, the genii, their
rulers ("Lords of Death," as Valentinus calls them), exercise their
tyranny over the soul through the medium of these faculties, so long as
the soul is *encrusted* with their contributions during its imprisonment
in the body.

It is curious to compare with this Grecian theory the "Doctrine of the
Servants of Saturn," dwellers in the farthest North (unmistakably a
fragment of Druidical lore), preserved to

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

us by Plutarch in his treatise 'On the Face in the Moon.' They taught
that in the generation of man, the Earth supplied the *body*, the Moon
ψυκή, the Sun the νοῦς. What the ψυκή is to the body, the same is the
νοῦς to the ψυκή. This composite nature undergoes a double death. In the
first, Demeter, whose companion is the Earthly, or Supernal, Hermes,
forcibly separates the ψυκή (animal soul) from the body. This soul,
after a certain penance in the Middle Sphere, in order to purify it from
the pollution of the flesh, is caught up into the Moon, and passes
through the Earth's shadow during an eclipse, after a probation
proportionate in length of time unto its deserts; whereas, the wicked,
if they try to enter before their purification be completed, are scared
away by the terrific *Face*. The good abide in the Moon, in the
enjoyment of perfect tranquillity, and becoming δαίμονες or *genii*,
busy themselves with the regulation of human affairs upon earth,
rendering oracles and similar services to mankind. But should these
beatified spirits misconduct themselves, they are put again into a human
body, and sent down to Earth. (This is the very doctrine of Manes, who
made the light of the Moon to depend upon the brightness of the blessed
one therein resident; a theory which Epiphanius triumphantly overthrows
by asking how the luminary was supplied during the eight centuries that
elapsed between the Creation and the death of Adam?)

But after a certain time, the νοῦς aspires to reascend to its fountain
head the Sun, whereupon Persephone, with her colleague the Celestial
Hermes, separates it with gentleness and by slow degrees from the
grosser ψυκή. This is the Second Death: the vows flying up to the Sun,
but the ψυκή remaining in the Moon in a dreamy sort of existence, until
gradually absorbed into her substance, exactly as the Earth gradually
absorbs into herself the remains of the body. Calm and philosophic souls
are easily absorbed; but active, passionate, erotic natures with great
difficulty; they wander about in midspace, divested of the νοῦς,
becoming *Tityi* and *Typhones;* <span id="fr_205"></span>[\*](#fn_203.md)
throwing confusion

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

into oracles, as the so-called Typhon does at Delphi, until in the end
they likewise are drawn back and attracted into the substance of the
Moon.

Justinus Kerner, in his treatise 'Die Seherin von Prevorst,' improving
upon the old notion, most ingeniously anatomises the Inner Man, and
makes him to consist of three members, *Seele*, *Nerven-Geist,* *Geist*.
The Nerven-Geist, or nervous energy, being of a grosser nature,
continues united with the Seele after its separation from the body,
rendering it capable of becoming *visible* to the living in the form of
an apparition, and enabling it in other ways to affect material objects,
to make noises, move about articles of furniture, in short, to commit
the various annoyances comprehended under the term "es spukt." And here
be it observed the commonness of such visitations in Germany is
amusingly exemplified by the necessity of having an impersonal verb to
express them; just as we say "it rains," "it blows," so do the more
sensitive Germans say "it ghosts." According to its previous training in
life, this composite being requires more or less time to dissolve, the
Seele alone being immortal; and consequently the Teutonic spectres
assume a more and more diminutive form as their time of probation wears
away. Analogous to this is Plato's explanation of the *acknowledged
facts* of spirits haunting tombs: having been immersed during her union
with the body in gross sensual pleasures, the soul becomes equally
unable and unwilling to abandon her old companion and dwelling-house
before the same be totally consumed.

To the above-quoted theories explaining the nature of the soul, and its
final destination, the recent discovery of that precious monument of
Gnosticism, the Pistis-Sophia enables us to add a third, infinitely more
complete in all its details. This last

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

revelation improves upon the Neo-Platonic doctrine by making the astral
genii "the Rulers of the Sphere" (Zodiac) *create* the soul from their
own substance "out of the tears of their eyes and the sweat of their
torment," animated with a spark of that Divine Light which has not yet
been totally extracted from their fuller nature. For these Zodiacal
Lords evidently answer to the rebellious Angels of the Jews, and the
Seven Devs of the Magi, in fact the whole treatise represents the
religious ideas of the latter, more closely than of any other system.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_201"></span>[343:\*](gar49.htm#fr_203.md) This was merely an
adaptation to the new notions of the sect of the old Egyptian ritual
always placed, entire or in part, within the mummy-case, and entitled,
"The Book of the Gates, concerning the manifestation unto the Light."
These *Gates*, leading to the palace of Osiris, were one-and-twenty in
number, and were guarded each by its particular deity, to be duly
addressed in his turn. The papyrus of Petamenoph, otherwise Ammonius (d.
under Hadrian), has been admirably explained and translated by
Champollion, and published in Caillaud's 'Voyage a Meroé,' iv. p. 22. Or
the belief may have had a Chaldæan origin, even more ancient than the
Egyptian. Lane-Fox and others have translated a tablet giving an account
of the descent of the goddess Ishtar into Hades, "the Land of no
Return." The Lord of Earth gives her a green bough of the If tree, and
she passes successively through the Seven Gates, surrendering at each in
order, her crown, ear-rings, head-jewels, front-lets, finger and
toe-rings, and necklace. The Lord of Hades gives her a cup of the Water
of Life, and she returns, receiving back her jewels in the same order in
which she gave them up.

<span id="fn_202"></span>[344:\*](gar49.htm#fr_204.md) The Ritual above
cited contains regularly *eight* invocations addressed to Thoth,
recommending the soul of the defunct to the guardians of the sane number
of regions over whom he is the president.

<span id="fn_203"></span>[347:\*](gar49.htm#fr_205.md) Names of the chief
giants who warred against Jupiter. The legend clearly comes from the
same source as that in the Book of Enoch: "And the Giants who were born
of the spirit and of flesh shall be called <span id="page_348">p.
348</span> *evil spirits* upon earth; and on earth shall be their
habitation. Evil spirits shall proceed from their flesh because they
were created from above; from the holy watchers was their beginning and
primary foundation. Evil spirits shall they be upon earth, and the
spirits of the wicked shall they be called. The habitation of the
spirits of heaven shall be in heaven, but upon earth shall be the
habitation of terrestrial spirits who are born on earth. The spirits of
the giants shall be like clouds which shall oppress, corrupt, fall,
contend, and bruise upon earth."--(xv. 8.)
