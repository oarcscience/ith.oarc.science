### PLATE A.

### VARIOUS TYPES OF THE GOD ABRAXAS.

1\. Abraxas brandishing a whip, to scare away malignant influences, his
shield emblazoned with some word of power. Reverse, the usual Greek
transliteration of the Hebrew name of God.

2\. Abraxas, armed with a sword; the exceptionally neat execution of the
intaglio bespeaks the first days of the religion.

3\. Abraxas, wielding a *mace*, a Persian weapon that betrays the
Asiatic origin of this particular design; the *thunderbolt* in the field
identifies this Power with the classic Jupiter. The reverse exhibits the
Triple Hecate, Queen of Hell, brandishing various weapons for the same
prophylactic purpose as the god himself. A unique combination of ideas,
engraved upon a circular copper plaque, found in the south of France.

4\. The Agathodæmon Serpent, with radiated head, identified by the
legend with the god Abraxas. One of the few types that can with
confidence be attributed to the sect of Ophites.

5\. Abraxas, of very debased and late execution. The title "*Sabaoth*"
on the reverse, properly signifying "of hosts," was mistaken by the
ignorant Hellenists for the actual *name* of a Power, by translating
"Lord of Hosts" as "the Lord Sabaoth." Under this title he figures
largely in the sigillum of the "Pistis-Sophia."
