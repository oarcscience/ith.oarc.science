### No Relation of Modern Masons to Mediæval Guilds

An interesting feature in the treatise is the fact of its ascribing
these same "Constitutions" to King Athelstan. There is very good reason
for accepting this statement as founded upon trustworthy tradition. The
Saxon Prince was the first British sovereign who possessed either wealth
or inclination for decorative architecture or building of any sort. His
father, Edward the Elder, and his aunt Ethelfleda "the Lady of Mercia,"
are recorded as the first of the Saxon line who built fortifications of
stone about their chief cities. Before this the Saxons, like all other
Teutons, had no other idea of building than of constructions in wood,
all stone-masons had to be brought over from France when wanted (as
numerous references, unnecessary here to quote, conclusively evince), in
which country architecture had kept up a feeble existence after the fall
of the Empire, its preservation being due to the patronage of the
Church, which kept growing in wealth and

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

power in proportion as the Roman authority died away. The simplicity of
the Constitutions in prescribing the convening of mere *craftsmen* under
the presidency of the sheriff and mayor, betokens a truly Saxon state of
society, and moreover a time when these masons were actually
working-men. Under the Normans, regular architects (in one sense) first
appear as the "Masters," who were almost invariably churchmen.
Furthermore, the prohibition against taking a "*bondman*" for prentice
unmistakably betokens the same early period, when domestic slavery, not
mere *villanage*, was recognised by law: the Norman legislation makes no
such distinction of bond and free.

Aubrey indeed quotes the authority of Dugdale that "the Fraternity of
Adopted Masons," having *signs* and *passwords* for the purpose of
mutual recognition, owed its origin to a company of Italian masons, who
in Henry III.’s time obtained a patent from the Pope to go about Europe,
building churches. But the absurdity of this statement is manifested by
a single fact: when the Italians of that period wished to erect any
important edifice, so far from being competent to do so for other
nations, they were forced to call in architects from Germany and France.
To give a few decisive examples, as regards the wealthiest and most
polished states of that country:--Pisa employed Guglielmo il *Tedesco*
to plan her celebrated Campanile; Florence, Lapo, *alias* Jacopo il
*Tedesco*, father of Arnolfo (who had already gained high reputation by
the triple church he had built at Assisi for the Franciscans), to
construct their bridge "Alla Carraia," the Bargello or Townhall, several
churches, and to drain the Piazza Grande. Even a century later the
Visconti were obliged to employ German architects to design the Duomo at
Milan. It is true Henry III. had in his pay one Peter "civis Romanus,"
but only in the capacity of a decorative artist, for the mosaic work at
the Westminster Shrine. But in truth, during the entire Gothic period,
architecture, as a national art, may be said to have been extinct in
Italy, the grand centre of the art then being established in the very
middle of France.

All this evidence goes to show that our Freemasons have no

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

relationship, either actual or traditional, with the mediæval guilds
bearing the same appellation, a pretence they so zealously maintain. The
latter were corporations of real workmen, in which each person, after
serving a regular apprenticeship, and, according to the custom still
kept up in some counties, producing a *trial-piece* to prove his
competency, was admitted "free" of the Guild, and "accepted" amongst the
members of the same. The compotations accompanying the ceremony are in
truth the sole point of resemblance between the ancient and the modern
Freemasons.

The 'Bulletin Monumental' for 1884, p. 34, contains a memoir, "Les
signes de Tacherons sur les remparts d’Avignon," which gives the fullest
collection (six pages) of these marks that has ever been published. They
can be here traced from Roman times where they appear as single letters
or as Trionian shorthand, down to the actual Masons’ Marks of mediæval
and modern times. Many clearly represent the tools used in building.
Some of these marks, and more of those from Avignon, are to be
recognised upon Lichfield's "Baphometic Tablet;" which may, after all,
be no modern forgery, but a genuine register of such segli of the
seventeenth century. <span id="fr_225"></span>[\*](#fn_223.md)

The mediæval guild of Masons, as we have seen, was no more a *secret
society* than were the guilds of Carpenters, Cordwainers or Tailors.
Every man indeed belonging to the first-named (and this is the only
thing belonging to the Craft, that really carries with it an air of
mysterious antiquity) had, upon admission, a *mark* (or cypher) assigned
him, which he was bound to put upon every stone he dressed (a rule still
observed) in order to distinguish his work from that of his fellows,
against the time when the materials should be examined by the
master-mason, who paid him for those approved, but stopped his wages for
those spoiled through his fault. Similarly every "Merchant of the
Staple" joined with his initials upon his seal, or trade mark, the
*mark* of the staple-town to which he belonged. This latter, though

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

much alike in outline, was variously modified so as to indicate each of
the fifteen towns in England, Ireland, and Wales, appointed by Edward
III. In all mediæval documents relating to building, the name
"Freemason" signifies merely the worker in hewn stone, the inferior
workman who ran up the body of the wall in rubble or ragstone being
called the "Rough-waller." Lastly, a very puzzling question presents
itself--if our Freemasons be the legitimate successors in an unbroken
line of the ancient lodges and guilds, how came it that all the
principles of Gothic architecture were utterly lost within less than a
century?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_223"></span>[385:\*](gar56.htm#fr_225.md) Most interesting of
all, on account of their early date, are the Masons’ Marks at
Westminster Hall, lately published by Dr. Freshfield, in the
Archæologia, Vol. 50, Part I.
