### THE CHNUPHIS SERPENT.

A Limoges enamelled plaque of the twelfth century (in the collection of
Mr. Octavius Morgan) represents on its one half "Moyses" lifting up the
Brazen Serpent to the "Filii Israel." On the other half, "similis Aaron"
is seen inscribing with a

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

reed pen the mystic Tau Cross upon the foreheads of the elect. The first
of these tableaux offers the most extraordinary feature in its
representation of the serpent, depicted here with *lion's head and
mane:* the veritable Agathodæmon Chnuphis of our Alexandrian talismans.
The preservation of this form to so late a period fills one with
surprise: it indicates a traditionary belief that the symbol was the
giver of life and health. The belief must have come down from the times
when the Egyptian talisman was commonly worn, in the way Galen mentions,
as a protection to the chest. The Brazen Serpent of Moses and the Plasma
Agathodæmon of King Nechepsos had in all probability one and the same
origin, giving currency to those little ingots which formed the sole
money of the Hindoos before the establishment of the Macedonians in
Bactria. But the most probable solution of the question is that the
symbol stealthily represents the serpent-entwined club of Aesculapius
(itself so hard to account for), or the wand similarly encircled, which
was the badge of Egyptian priesthood. And what renders this conjecture
of mine almost a certainty is an *as* of the gens Acilia, bearing for
obverse the head of Aesculapius, for reverse a *wand* (not the usual
club) placed vertically and encircled by his serpent in *three*
convolutions. This type, if slightly defaced by wear, would become
identical in appearance with the Chnuphis symbol. The spiral frequently
takes the form of the letters **S S S** disconnected, traversed by a
straight line. The curative virtue ascribed to the sigil, again, tends
to indicate its derivation from the proper badge of the god of the
healing art. For the eminent physician Marcellus Empiricus (who
flourished at Bordeaux in Theodosius' reign) promises wonderful effects
in the cure of pleurisy from the wearing of this very figure engraved
upon a cerulean Scythian jasper. Whether this promise be true or not,
marvellous has been the vitality of the symbol itself; for reduced to a
double **S S** upon a bar, it became a favourite device in the times of
chivalry, being taken as the rebus upon the word *Fermesse* <span
id="fr_130"></span>[\*](#fn_129) (SS *fermées*.md) and the emblem of
constancy. Hence comes it that this ancient Egyptian symbol now adorns

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

the Collar of the Garter, formerly known as the "Collars of SS."
Meyrick's derivation of the name from the initial of "Souver ayne,"
motto of Henry IV. when Earl of Derby (and on whose effigy the Collar
first appears), is of little weight; for that king was long posterior to
the institution of the Order and its insignia. Even more preposterous is
Camden's idea that the name originated in the initials of Sanctus Simo
Simplicius, a famous Roman lawyer; and therefore was taken for badge by
his profession--a theory which assuredly does not account for Henry's
queen, Joan of Navarre, being similarly decorated with her husband upon
their monument.

That the Agathodæmon sigil was not only pre-Christian, but ascended to
the remotest antiquity in its use as a talisman, plainly appears from
Galen's notice thereof (De Simp. Med. 6 ix.). "Some indeed assert that a
virtue of this kind is inherent in certain stones, such as *it is
certain* is possessed by the green jasper, which benefits the chest and
mouth of the stomach, when tied upon them. Some indeed set the stone in
a ring, and engrave upon it a serpent with head crowned with rays,
according to the directions of King Nechepsos in his thirteenth book. Of
this material I have had much experience, having made a necklace out of
stones of the kind, and hung it about the patient's neck, descending low
enough to touch the mouth of the stomach, and they proved to be of no
less benefit than if they had been engraved in the manner laid down by
King Nechepsos." This treatise by Nechepsos must have been a regular
Manual for the use of Magicians, for Ausonius mentions its author as

"Quique magos docuit mysteria vana Nechepsi."  
"Nechepsos, teacher of vain Magic's lore."

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The book, perhaps
the foundation of the pretended Evax, was the first source of the
notions concerning the virtues of sigils and gems preserved to us in the
mediæval "Lapidaria." Pliny (vii. 50) quotes him along with his
countryman Petosiris as an astrological authority, according to whose
rule of the "Tetartomorion" (or law deduced from the position of three
signs, *Trine*) the possible duration of human life in the region of
Italy extended to 124 years. And before dismissing Nechepsos and his
book it may be as well to add here--for the fact will be of service in a
further stage of this inquiry--that Pliny mentions (xxx. 2) a second
school of Magic, "but more recent by many thousand years" than
Zoroaster's, and founded by the *Jews*, Moses, Iannes and Jotapes. The
first of the trio may be the Talmudist to whose "secret volume" Juvenal
alludes--

"Tradidit arcane quacumque volumine Moses."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Although the
Apostle couples Iannes along with Iambres amongst the Egyptian opponents
of the Hebrew legislator, Juvenal also informs us that the nation
retained even in his times their ancient fame of veracious interpreters
of dreams; nay, more, grown "wiser than Daniel," they even *produced*
them to order--

"Qualiacunque voles Judæi somnia mittunt."

"The Jew, for money, sends what dreams you choose."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hippolytus in the
following century remarks that the "Samaritans," or "Simonians," founded
by the first preacher of the Gnosis, Simon Magus himself, availed
themselves of this power in order to plague their adversaries, "sending
the *dream-producing* demons to trouble whomsoever they please." The
mediæval name for engraved gems regarded as talismans, viz., "Pierres
d’Israel," is better founded than is generally supposed. The obvious
difficulty that graven figures--nay, more, idols--could not have been
the work of Jews, is answered by the Rabbinical gloss upon the Second
Commandment, which allows the wearing of any sort of design cut in
*intaglio*, though prohibiting anything of the sort in relief.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

The choice of the green *jasper* (now called *plasma* <span
id="fr_131"></span>[\*](#fn_130).md) for the Agathodæmon sigils was
probably dictated by the resemblance of its colour to that of the sacred
Asp--green banded with brown. As for the figure itself, a very ancient
testimony as to its nature and signification is afforded by the
tradition Eusebius has preserved (I. 7): "The serpent, unless injured by
violence, never dies naturally, for which reason the Phœnicians have
given it the name of the 'Good Genius,' *Agathodæmon*. For the same
cause the Egyptians have called it 'Cneph,' and given to it the head of
a hawk, because of the especial swiftness of that bird." The priest of
Epeae, entitled "Head-interpreter of sacred things and Scribe," had
expounded the allegory thus "The most divine Nature of all was one
Serpent having the face of a hawk, and most delightful in aspect, for
when he opened his eyes he filled all the places of his native region
with light; but when he closed them, darkness immediately ensued." The
serpent on our gems, however, does not appear invested with a hawk's
head, but with a *lion's;* for which reason this legend applies better
to the Abraxas-god, occasionally equipped with a hawk's or lion's head,
in place of his proper one, that of a cock. But the idea is certainly
embodied in that common design upon the Mithraic gems, a man grasping a
serpent, of which the radiated head points at his eyes and seems to
supply them with light. Furthermore, the meaning of the figure of the
Agathodæmon is clearly denoted by the Chaldee legend frequently
accompanying it. **CΕΜΕCΕΙΛΑΜ**, "The Everlasting Sun," which is
sometimes followed by **ΨΕ**, probably used as sacred numerals, for they
have the power in Greek arithmetic of 705. This same legend is attached
to a *classical* figure of Phœbus (such as he appears on the coins with
the legend **SOLI INVICTO COMITI**) engraved upon a yellow jasper in the
Marlborough Cabinet--a fact sufficiently attesting the accuracy of the
interpretation here given to the Chaldee inscription.

*Astrology* likewise lent its aid to accrediting the virtues of the

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

sigil. That great authority Hephaestion (quoted by Salmasius, *i.e.*)
observes that **ΧΝΟϒΜΙC** is the name of one of the *Decani*, or three
chief stars in Cancer; whilst another astrologer laid down that the star
so called was set in the breast of Leo, and *for that reason* was
efficacious for the cure of all diseases in the chest of man. And in
fact we find this latter dictum confirmed by the prayer **ΦϒΛΑCCΕ ϒΓΙΗ
CΤΟΜΑΧΟΝ ΠΡΟΚΛΟϒ**, "Keep in good health the chest of Proclus," engraved
upon the back of one of these very Chnuphis gems. Others of the same
kind are again surrounded by a long Coptic legend often arranged in the
outline of a serpent, varying in words, but always terminating in the
epithet **ΓΙΓΑΝΤUΡΗΚΤΑ** or **ΠΑΙΚΤΑ**, "Breaker" or "Mocker" of the
Giants--that is, of the evil and rebellious Angels; for the Grecian
fable of the War of the Giants against Jove had then revived, a
Zoroastrian interpretation being applied to the rebellion of Ahriman and
his demons against Ormuzd and the Ministers of Good.

The method of employing a talisman is thus prescribed in the Magic
Papyrus, § 9:--"A Spell of Alleius Cræonius, spoken to the Lamp,"
"Ωχμαρμαχω τοννουραι χρη μιλλον δερκυων να Ιαο σουμψηφισον σουμψηνις
σωσια σιαωι, Thou that shakest the world! Enter, and deliver an oracle
concerning such and such a matter. Θοιο κοτοθ φθουφνουν νουεβουη
επτασπαχατου. The engraved stone (λ.γ.) Serapis seated in front, having
the Egyptian crown (βασιλήῑον) ξξ, and upon his sceptre an ibis, on the
back of the stone the Name; and lock it up and keep it for use. Hold in
thy left hand the ring, and in thy right a branch of olive and of
bay-tree, waving them over the lamp, repeating all the while the spells
even times. And having drawn the ring upon the proper finger of thy left
hand, facing and being inwards (the engraving), stick the gem against
thy left ear, and go to sleep, without returning answer to any one." The
object of this charm was (although not so stated) to procure prophetic
dreams, which are actually enumerated amongst the effects to follow from
the use of the one that stands next in the MS.

Although the original intention of these Chnuphis sigils was
unquestionably the one pointed out in the preceding pages, yet

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

there is every probability from the nature of the case that the same
were adopted and interpreted in a *spiritual* sense by the numerous and
influential sect that first assumed the title of "Gnostics." They had an
all-sufficient reason for so doing, in the fundamental doctrine of their
creed. The well-informed and temperate Hippolytus, writing at the most
flourishing period of these transitional theosophies, thus opens his
actual 'Refutation of all Heresies' and his Fifth Book with the
description "of that sect which hath dared to boast the *Serpent* as the
author of their religion, as they prove by certain arguments wherewith
*he* hath inspired them. On this account the apostles and priests of
this creed have been styled 'Naaseni,' from 'Naas,' the Hebrew word for
*serpent:* but subsequently they entitled themselves 'The Gnostics,'
because they alone understood the deep things of religion. Out of this
sect sprung many other teachers, who by diversifying the original
doctrines through inventions of their own became the founders of new
systems." Further on he has a passage bearing immediately upon this
subject. "This *Naas* is the *only thing* they worship, for which reason
they are called 'Naaseni' (*i.e.* *Ophites*, or Serpent-worshippers).
From this same word *Naas* they pretend that all the temples (ναοί)
under Heaven derive the name. And unto this Naas are dedicated every
rite, ceremony, mystery, that is; in short, not one rite can be found
under Heaven into which this Naas doth not enter. For they say the
Serpent signifies the element Water; and with Thales of Miletus contend
that nothing in the Universe can subsist without it, whether of things
mortal or immortal, animate or inanimate. All things are subject unto
him; and he is good, and hath all good things within himself as in the
horn of a unicorn, so that he imparts beauty and perfection unto all
that is, inasmuch as he pervades all things, as flowing out of Eden, and
divided into four heads. . . . This Naas is the 'water above the
firmament,' and likewise the 'living water' spoken of by the Saviour.
Unto this *Water* all Nature is drawn, and attracts out of the same
whatever is analogous to its own nature, each thing after its own kind,
with more avidity than the loadstone draws the iron, the ray of the
sea-hawk gold, or amber straws. Then they go

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

on to boast: We are the *Spiritual*, who have drawn our own portion out
of the living water of the Euphrates that flows through the midst of
Babylon; and who have entered in through the True Gate, the which is
Jesus the Blessed. And we of all men are the *only Christians*, in the
Third Gate celebrating the Mystery, being anointed with the ineffable
ointment out of the *horn* like David, not out of the *earthen vessel*
like Saul who conversed with the Evil Spirit of carnal concupiscence."

Euphrates, a more recent teacher of the sect, who founded the branch
calling themselves "Peratai," or Fatalists, has a passage that indicates
the sense in which his followers may have accepted these Chnuphis gems.
"To them therefore of the Children of Israel who were bitten in the
Wilderness Moses showed the *True and Perfect Serpent;* in whom
whosoever trusteth he shall not be bitten by the serpents of the
Wilderness, that is, shall not be hurt by the *Powers*. No one therefore
is able to heal and to save them that be gone forth out of Egypt, that
is, out of the body and out of the world, save that Perfect, Full of all
fulness, Serpent. In Him whosoever putteth his trust, that man perisheth
not by the serpents of the Wilderness, that is, by the gods of the
nativity."

These last Powers, whom Euphrates (a pure astrologer) in another place
calls the "gods of death," are the stars of the horoscope, "which impose
upon all that be born the fatal yoke of the changeful nativity," that
is, the necessity of *death*, the necessary consequence of *birth*, a
doctrine that clearly leads to the efficacy of the Serpent sigil as a
talisman to protect the wearer against the malign influence of the
astral genii. The Ophites, in fact, were the legitimate descendants of
the Bacchic Mystae, whose religion during the two centuries preceding
our era must have been the predominant one in the great cities of Asia
Minor. An argument derived from Numismatics establishes the common
fact--the coinage of the chief cities, Ephesus, Apamea, Pergamus, was
issued chiefly in the form of *Cistophori*, having for obverse the
Bacchic Serpent raising himself out of the sacred coffer; for reverse,
two serpents entwined round torches.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[219:\*](gar32.htm#fr_130.md) This sigla in its
simplest form, <span id="img_21900"></span> ![](img/21900.jpg), makes
its appearance in profusion over all the buildings of Henri IV., where
it is popularly explained <span id="page_220">p. 220</span> as relating
to Gabrielle d’Estrées, a rebus in its sound, "S percé d’un trait." But
Longperier has shown that the same figure is to be found on the medals
of Henri's mother and sister, and even upon articles made for Anne of
Austria; and he acquiesces in the explanation given in the text, which
is taken from an old book, 'Les Bigarrures,' chap. "Des Rébus de la
Picardie," by Etienne Tabouret, Sieur des Accords--('Revue Numismatique'
for 1856, p. 276).

"Fermesse, dont l’Amour peint un Chiffre d’amour  
Commune en l’écriture, mais rare dans le coeur,  
Mais ainsi que la forme est d’un arc mis en deux  
Le désir inconstant froisse et brise tes nœuds,  
Ce pendant quo les mains ta *fermesse* figurent."  
        ’Lovs Papon,’ 16th century.

<span id="fn_130"></span>[222:\*](gar32.htm#fr_131.md) The green *jasper*
of the moderns was the molochites or molochas of the ancients, for Pliny
describes it as *opaque*, dark-green, and specially used for amulets.
