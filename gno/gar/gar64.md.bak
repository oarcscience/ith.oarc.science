### The Sufis

The influence of the Crusades and their results upon the mind and life
of mediæval Europe cannot possibly be exaggerated

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The true masters
of the Western barbarians in philosophy, science, and many of the arts,
were the Arabs, firstly, those of Syria, later, of Spain. Together with
their learning they communicated other ideas, far different from those
originally contemplated by their pupils. Nevertheless, the connection
between their science and their secret creed was so intimate that, in
reality, no other result was to be looked for. So much of primitive
Gnosticism, before its admixture with Christianity, was based upon
Magism, that is, upon astrological ideas, as to make it often difficult
to determine whether a Gnostic monument involves a religious notion, or
is merely a sidereal talisman. For example, the Decani of the Signs,
whose figures, according to Teucer, were commonly worn as amulets, are
often to be seen bearing the names inscribed of Michael and other Jewish
angels. In the flourishing times of Mahommedanism, before the spread of
universal ignorance had established everywhere the dull reign of
uninquiring orthodoxy, there existed at its very heart (probably
originating in Persia) an esoteric body, styling themselves *Sufi*, a
title evidently derived from the Greek Σοφοί, their predecessors. Now
this title appears assumed as equivalent to the previous Γνωστικοί,
although with far more arrogance, since these "wise" men claimed the
*possession* of that knowledge of things divine which the Gnostics by
their own designation were only "*desirous of knowing*." Meantime, the
tenets they held were precisely those of the old *Antitactae*,
"ordinance-haters," as to the indifference of all things pertaining to
the body, and the invalidity of the Jewish moral law (the mere
appointment of the Demiurgus), as regarded the regulation of the life of
the "Spiritual Man." Just as it is a constant charge of the Fathers
against the primitive Gnostics that they outwardly conformed without
scruple, in order to escape all annoyance, to the established religion
of whatever place they chanced to inhabit, it is equally probable that
the Manicheans and other sectaries of Asia, persecuted with like zeal by
orthodox Byzantine and Zoroastrian Persian, would gladly shelter
themselves under the easy cloak of the true religion of their Arab
conquerors, during the two centuries following Justinian's reign, and
either save

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

their liberty by *professing* Mahommedanism, or else continue, as
tributaries, in the unmolested exercise of their old faith, being
confounded by the uninquisitive conqueror under the general name of
*Infidels*. <span id="fr_254"></span>[\*](#fn_252.md) "The sects of Egypt
and Syria," says Gibbon, "enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of
the Arabian Caliphs," and therefore may reasonably be supposed to have
maintained their peculiar notions and observances down to the time of
the Crusades. Of such protracted existence we have the most convincing
proof at the present day in the numerous sect, the Mandaites, or
Nazarenes of the Shat-el-Arab, and Bassora; veritable Gnostics, holding
a creed, the true image of that of Manes, in their 'Book of Adam;' and
detested by their Christian and Moslem neighbours alike.

Now, inasmuch as these Sufi were composed exclusively of the learned
amongst the Persians and Syrians, at a time when *learning* signified
little else than proficiency in medicine and astrology (the two points
that brought the Eastern sages into amicable contact with their
barbarous invaders from the West), it is easy to see how the latter may
have imbibed the *esoteric* doctrines simultaneously with the other
teaching of those who were their sole instructors in all matters
pertaining to science and art. Now the Sufi doctrine was based on that
grand idea--one universal creed that could be secretly held under the
outward profession of any established religion--taking, in fact,
virtually the same view of all religious systems as that in which the
philosophers of old had regarded them. Such too had been a striking
feature in the Gnostic teaching: the *Naaseni*, or Ophites, says
Hippolytus, boasted in language truly Masonic, "We of all men are the
only Christians, standing in the *third gate*, and anointed with the
ineffable unction out of the *horn* like David, not out of the *earthen
vesse*l like Saul, who consorted with the evil spirit of carnal
concupiscence." These same *genuine* Christians at the same time
zealously celebrated all the Mysteries of Paganism, affirming that in
their higher *knowledge* they possessed the only key to the one truth
locked up under those superstitious ceremonies. And in our day the
acknowledgment

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

of one universal religion by the Freemasons, as expressed by their
requiring from the candidate for admission nothing more than the
declaration of his belief in one God, is denounced with pious horror by
the bigots of every variety of the Christian scheme.

This recognition of one universal religion in fact pervades all the
works of the lights of Mohammedan literature. In the *Makamat* of Hariri
the sermons preached by his hero the Dervish are full of a sentiment
more sublime when touching upon things pertaining unto God--a sentiment
harmonising infinitely more closely with those of enlightened religious
men of our times upon the same subject--in a word, these sermons breathe
a spirit in every respect more *Christian* (to use the modern phrase)
than characterises any writings of the actual Christian divines, the
contemporaries of the author. <span id="fr_255"></span>[\*](#fn_253.md) But
this is necessarily so, Hariri and Mohammedans like him being guided by
the traditions of the old philosophy still secretly maintained amongst
them, whilst the spirit of modern Christianity is strongly, though
unconsciously, directed by precisely the same influence revived, though
under a different name, and professedly contemning its real source.

Again, the greatest of all Mohammedan sovereigns, the Mogul Akbar, was a
true *Sufi;* equally so was his prime minister and historian, Abul
Farez. It would be difficult to find in a modern Christian prayer-book,
much less in any one composed in his age, an address to the Deity so
sublime, so consonant with our present notions, as the invocation
opening his *Ayeen-Akbari*. In all such outpourings of Oriental
adoration no allusion whatever to their special lawgiver is to be
detected, nothing to betray any distinctive sectarian prejudice; the
reader, if unacquainted with the history of the author, would admire,
but know not to what creed to adjudge the composition. Akbar, according
to his vizier, "made a point of never ridiculing or condemning any form
of religion." He had thus, perhaps without knowing it, reverted to the
grand and distinguishing feature of the religion of Greece and Rome in
their best times that discerned the same great truth, the real basis of
universal

<span id="page_417">p. 417</span>

toleration, that all religious systems were but expressions of the same
idea,

"By saint, by savage, or by sage."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Wherever, in
ancient times, the principle of toleration was apparently violated, it
was in cases where the rites, by their corruption, had become
prejudicial to public welfare, as when the Senate put down the
Bacchanalia, or Claudius the Druids in Gaul, on account of their human
sacrifices; exactly as hero of Syracuse had made it an article in his
treaty with the vanquished Carthaginians, that they should discontinue
their burnt-offerings of young children to Melcarth. Hesiod's maxim, Μὴ
ἀρρητοῖς μωμεύειν, was that of his race, as well as of the Roman, and
the same was the guiding principle of Akbar. From a hint dropped by his
panegyrist it would almost appear that the Emperor had imbibed some
slight tinge of Zoroastrian doctrine, for he remarks his particular
veneration for the element of fire; and again the significant
circumstance of his regulating his frequent daily prayers by the
position of the sun in the heavens; and, what bears directly upon our
subject, his favourite occupation was to converse with the *Sufi* and
the learned of all nations and religions. It sounds also very odd to
hear a Mohammedan grandee, like this writer, declaring that amongst the
Brahmins were to be found "the most virtuous men upon earth," those very
religionists in whom Akbar's successors, like Aurungzeb, could (quite
according to our own ideas of what necessarily should have been his
feeling) discern nothing but devil-worshippers, whom it was his bounden
duty either to convert or exterminate.
