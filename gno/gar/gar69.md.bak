### The Illuminati

As for the transmission of these symbols, the question would be at once
settled should we accept the bold declaration of Lessing, for which,
however, we have only his own authority (*Fortsetzung des Ernst.* p.
53): "The Lodges of the Templars were in the very highest repute during
the 12th and 13th centuries; and out of such a Templars’ Lodge which had
been *continually kept up* in the heart of London, was the Society of
Freemasons established in the 17th century by Sir Christopher Wren." But
this venerable tradition is directly contravened by the testimony of the
most unimpeachable of all witnesses, the grand *illuminato*, Spartacus
Weishaupt himself. At Munich, in the St. Theodosius Lodge (in 1777), he
received the first Masonic degrees, but was inexpressibly disappointed
on finding in Masonry nothing beyond "les jeux d’une fraternité
innocente!" Nevertheless he suspected that something deeper yet
remained; and soon his expectations were fulfilled. That same winter his
friend, Cato Zwack, had an interview at Augsburg with a certain Abbé
Marotti, who conferred upon him the highest degrees, even those of the
*Scottish* Lodges, and expounded to him all the mysteries, founded,
according to the

<span id="page_425">p. 425</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Abbé, upon the
religion and history of the Church. Zwack lost no time in communicating
his acquisitions to Weishaupt, who replies: "The important discovery you
have made at *Nicomedia*, in your interviews with Marotti, gives me
extreme pleasure; let us profit by the circumstance, and extract from it
all the advantages possible." Weishaupt had therefore been anticipated
by his explanation of their symbolism, which he himself adopted in the
new Mysteries he founded. Barruel adds (*Jacobinisme*, iv. 81) that the
charge of *illuminatism* does not apply to the first three degrees of
Masonry, neither to such as hold that these three degrees alone belong
to the real, ancient, fraternity. This would intimate that the
"Rosicrucian" had been later grafted upon the original number of
gradations in the Masonic hierarchy.

For the sake of comparison I shall give Barruel's account of the degrees
amongst the Illuminati, the predecessors of the Jacobins, viz.,

   I. Novices.

  II. Brethren of Minerva.

 III. Minor Illuminate.

  IV. Major Illuminate, or Scottish Novices.

   V. Scottish Knights.

  VI. The Lesser Mysteries: Epoptæ, or Illuminati Priests.

 VII. The Regent or Illuminato Prince.

VIII\. The Greater Mysteries; the Magus or King-Man

Like the Rosicrucians, each novice upon admission received his
*characteristic*, or mystic name, taken from Roman history: he then
studied the geography of the Order which classicised modern places after
a similar fashion: then he acquired the *cypher*, of which the simple
set was this

<div align="center">

|     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |     |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 12  | .   | 11  | .   | 10  | .   | 9   | .   | 8   | .   | 7   | .   | 6   | .   | 5   | .   | 4   | .   | 3   | .   | 2   | .   | 1   | .   |
| *a* | .   | *b* | .   | *c* | .   | *d* | .   | *e* | .   | *f* | .   | *g* | .   | *h* | .   | *i* | .   | *k* | .   | *l* | .   | *m* | .   |

</div>

The other, more abstruse, cypher consisted of *particular symbols*. The
Noviciate lasted from two three years, according to the age of the
Candidate. One of the things most strictly prohibited

<span id="page_426">p. 426</span>

was to ever write the *name* of either Order or Lodge; they must be
expressed by **Θ** and **Π** respectively. <span
id="fr_260"></span>[\*](#fn_258.md)

In the admission to his degrees Weishaupt adopted all the Masonic
ceremonial. For example, in making the "Scottish Knight," the "secret
conclave" was hung with green; the Prefect, booted and spurred, wearing
St. Andrew's Cross by a green ribbon tied *en saltire*, sat under a
green canopy, and received the candidate similarly equipped, holding a
mallet for sceptre. There was also the triple Benediction, and the
sacrament, to conclude, administered by the Chaplain. At the making of
the *Epoptas*, he was taken, blindfolded, by his sponsor in a perfectly
closed coach, by a circuitous route, into the hall now hung with *red;*
on a table covered with scarlet were laid the crown and sceptre, heaps
of gold mingled with chains. On a cushion lay a white robe and girdle.
The novice was told to choose: if he took the gold, he received a severe
reprimand, phrased with a lot of *humanitarian* cant too tedious to copy
here, and unnecessary besides--seeing that the same is perpetually
dinned into our ears at the present day. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[†](#fn_259.md)

At the end, the Hierophant delivered a long address upon natural liberty
and equality, and all the rest thereto pertaining. Weishaupt, a
professional *Atheist*, was both astonished and diverted at finding
eminent Protestant divines, after their initiation, declaring that all
these notions were the [genuine](errata.htm#28.md) doctrines of the Gospel:
which was certainly a very awkward truth to be held by the friends of
the established order of civilised society. It is not, however, less a
truth, if the same

<span id="page_427">p. 427</span>

doctrines be carried out to their logical consequences, instead of being
employed in defending ideas deduced in reality from a totally different
source. But Barruel, the refugee, who had just seen the doctrines of
liberty, equality and fraternity practically and naturally expounded by
means of the guillotine, reasonably enough puts down this declaration of
Weishaupt's as the most conclusive proof of his audacious impiety.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_258"></span>[426:\*](gar69.htm#fr_260.md) "'Brother A. B.,
*Write* upon this MS. of the R. S. of this Degree.' In his *attempt* to
do this he receives a severe and prudent C. by the J. D. placed behind
him for that purpose, by the C. T. united to his F. &c."--*Masonic
Ceremonial*.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[426:†](gar69.htm#fr_261.md) The popular notion of
the brand-mark received by Masons on initiation is derived front the
*stigmata* impressed upon the ancient mystæ at their admission. A
remarkable, example is that of Ptolemy Auletes, who was thus marked in
several parts of the body with the lotus, the colocynth-flower, and the
timbrel of Cybele (Plutarch, 'De dignoscendo adulatore'). The remarking
of the Mithraici has been noticed in the section devoted to that worship
(pp. [139](gar20.htm#page_139), [140](gar20.htm#page_140).md). Hence came
the mediæval belief in the secret mark impressed by the; Devil at the
*Sabbat* upon those who swore allegiance to him; and which mark could be
recognised by the witch-finders from its insensibility to pain.
