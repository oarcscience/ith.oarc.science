### DEATH, AS DEPICTED IN ANCIENT ART.

The King of the Shades has formed the subject of the preceding
investigation. The natural sequence of ideas requires us to consider by
what visible form ancient imagination expressed the direct agency of his
power, and represented to the eye the unwelcome apparition of the
"Satelles Orci."

Mingling among the Cupids, whether sculptured or glyptic, and easy to be
mistaken for one of the sportive group by the casual observer, comes the
most popular antique embodiment of what to our notions is the most
discordant of all ideas. He can only be distinguished from the God of
Love by observing his pensive attitude; his action of extinguishing his
torch either by striking the blazing end against the ground or by
trampling it out with the foot; otherwise he leans upon it inverted,
with folded wings, and arms and legs crossed in the attitude of profound
repose. At other times he is divested of wings, to typify the end of all
movement, and whilst he quenches his torch with one hand, he holds
*behind* him with the other the large hoop, *annus* (which the Grecian
Ενίαυτος carries *before* him), to signify that for his victim no more
shall the year roll on.

To understand how so charming a type came to be appropriated to such a
signification, it is necessary to cast off modern associations, and to
recollect that to the ancient mind, arguing merely from the analogy of
Nature, death presented itself as merely the necessary converse of
birth, and consequently carried no terror in the thought--"nullique ea
tristis imago," as Statius happily words it. For it implied nothing
worse than the return to the state of unconsciousness, such as was
before Being commenced; or, as Pliny clearly puts the case, "Unto all
the state of being after the *last* day as the same as it was before the
*first* day of life; neither is there any more sensation in

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

either body or soul after death than there was before life." On this
account the mere return, as Byron hath it--

"To be the nothing that I was,  
 Ere born to life and living woe,"

inspired no fears beyond those springing from the natural instinct of
self-preservation. Many carried this indifference to the opposite
extreme--exemplified in the trite story of the Thracians lamenting on
the occasion of a birth, and rejoicing on that of a death in the family.
Pliny boldly declares that the greatest favour Nature has bestowed on
man is the shortness of his span of life; whilst the later Platonists,
as seen in that curious chapter of Macrobius, "On the descent of the
Soul," termed the being born into this world "spiritual death," and
dying, "spiritual birth." But after the ancient order of ideas had been
totally revolutionised--when the death of the body came to be looked
upon as the punishment of Original Sin, and as the *infraction*, not the
*fulfilment* of a natural law--the notion necessarily assumed a more
horrific aspect; which again was exaggerated to the utmost of their
power by the new teachers, for it supplied them with the most potent of
all engines for the subjugation of the human soul--"Æternas quoniam
pœnas in morte timendum." The ancient type, therefore, which implied
nothing but peace and unbroken repose, was therefore at once discarded,
as totally inconsistent with the altered view of the reality. Add to
this the fact that everything in the shape of Cupid had been forcibly
enrolled amongst the Cherubim and Seraphim, and had thereby received a
character yet more foreign to that of the newly-created King of Terrors.

Hence the Christians were driven to seek in the ancient iconology for a
more fitting representation of the offspring and avenger of
transgression--something that should be equally ghastly and
terror-inspiring--and such a representative they found made to their
hand in the former way of picturing a *Larva*, or bad man's ghost. This
had always been depicted as a *skeleton*, and such a figure was
recommended by old association to their minds in the times when (as
Böttiger phrases it) "the Christians creeping forth out of their
catacombs

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

substituted for the Genius with inverted torch, the skulls and
mouldering bones of their own martyrs." And that the *larva* was
popularly imagined in a skeleton form, appears, amongst the rest, from
Ovid's line in his 'Ibis'--

"Insequar atque oculos *ossea* larva tuos."  
"Where’er thou turn’st my injured shade shall rise,  
 And flit, a fleshless ghost before thine eyes."

Seneca also laughs at the vulgar notion of "larva-forms, frames of bare
bones hanging together;" and Trimalchio, at his famous dinner, in order
to promote conviviality, throws down upon the table a silver larva, so
ingeniously made as to bound about on the board with every limb
quivering, whilst the host hiccups out the admonition--

"Heu, Heu, nos miseros, quam totus homuncio nil est,  
 Sic erimus cuncti, postquam nos auferet Orcus  
 Ergo vivamus dum licet esse bene."

Such a larva sometimes makes his appearance on the gem, introduced there
for the same purpose--to remind his wearer of the shortness of life, and
the wisdom of making the best use of the portion allotted to
him--speaking, mutely, the words of Virgil's 'Copa Syrisca'--

"Pone merum et talos, pereat qui crastina curat!  
 Mors aurem vellens; Vivite, ait, venio."

Thus upon one gem we behold him holding forth in his bony hand the
*lecythus* (long, pointed vase of oil), that regularly accompanied every
Greek interment, whilst he leans with his elbow against a huge *amphora*
of wine, as though recommending the enjoyment of its contents whilst yet
in one's power. <span id="fr_89"></span>[\*](#fn_88.md) Another, a more
fanciful composition, depicts Cupid casting the light of his torch into
the depths of an immense Corinthian *crater* out of which a skeleton is
throwing himself headlong, as though scared away by the hateful glare--a
design whose abstruse meaning may perhaps be interpreted by the
foregoing

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

remarks ('Impronte Gemmarie,' ii. 10, 11). <span
id="fr_90"></span>[\*](#fn_89.md) A skeleton, likewise, was often painted
on the wall of tombs; for example, in that pathetic scene at Pompeii,
where a mother is represented laying a mortuary fillet over the bones of
her child. In all these cases the form is merely intended to symbolise
the *condition* of death by placing before the eye the body as deserted
by life, reduced to the state most expressive of mortality and decay,
and which cannot be mistaken for one of sleep. But it is easy to
perceive how ready was the transition from the hieroglyph of mortality
regarded as a *state* (especially when to the popular mind the figure
also represented a restless and malignant spiritual being) to the
adoption of the same inauspicious shape for the embodiment of the idea
of the actual principle of destruction.

But to return to antique imagery of the same sense. The idea of death is
ingeniously and curiously expressed in a fresco decorating the lately
discovered vault of Vincentius and Vibia, in the Catacombs of
Prætextatus, Rome. In the scene labelled "abreptio Vibie et Discensio,"
the messenger of Fate, "Mercurius," appears placing one foot and leading
the way into a huge *urn* laid sideways on the ground. The allusion to
*Orcus* in the name of such a vessel, *orca*, is sufficiently obvious,
and in fact both may spring from the same root, ἕρκος, *inclosure*,
*prison*. But the most common type, perpetually repeated on sarcophagi
and tablets, is the *Horse*, significant of departure, looking in
through the window upon a party carousing--life's festive scene. Yet
more forcibly is the same notion carried out in an Etruscan sculpture
(figured in the Revue Archéologique, 1844), where the angel of death,
*Charun*, armed as usual with his ponderous mall, actually leads this
horse upon which sits the deceased with head muffled up, "capite
obnupto"--the established form in sentencing a criminal to execution.
The same reason, probably, made the horse's heal

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

so popular a subject for signet-gems; it served there for a
*memento-mori*, like the death's heads so much in vogue amongst the
jewels of the Cinque-cento time, although the antique symbol carried
with it a widely different admonition. The same notion may possibly lie
at the bottom of that immemorial custom in South Wales of the mummers
carrying the skull of a horse in their Christmas merry-makings.

Cognate to this is that most ancient representation of the conveyance of
the departed soul to the realms of bliss--imagined as some happy island
in the far West--upon a fantastic hippocampus, in figure like a winged
sea-serpent, and who later became the Roman Capricornus, "Ruler of the
Hesperian Wave:"--

"Thou, for thy rule, O Capricorn! hast won  
 All that extends beneath the setting sun,"

as Manilius defines the authority of that amphibious sign. But the
original conception is often engraved upon Phœnician scarabic; and no
doubt can remain as to its intention, since Caylus has published an
Etruscan vase (i. pl. 32) where this same monster is painted joyously
careering over the sea, whilst on its other side stands the mourner,
*præfica*, chaunting the funeral hymn over the corpse laid out upon its
bier of bronze.

To continue within the earliest portion of the subject, it must be
observed that in the most ancient monument of Greek sculpture whereof
any account remains--the Coffer of Cypselus (executed earlier than 600
B.C.)--*Night* was represented carrying in her arms two children, alike
in all respects save colour; the one white, the other black, having
their *legs crossed*: <span id="fr_91"></span>[\*](#fn_90.md) their names
being inscribed over them--*Sleep* and *Death*--for their mother was
hastening to the aid of the expiring Memnon. Thus it is manifest that
from the very dawn of pictorial art the crossed legs were the accepted
emblem of the most profound repose; whilst the sluggard's wish for "a
little more folding of

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

the hands in slumber" bears the same testimony to the import of the
*crossed arms* of the Roman Genius who leans on his inverted torch. In
that master-piece of Roman chasing, the Pompeian *discus*, "The Death of
Cleopatra," the object of the design is indicated with equal truth and
pathos by the placing of the beauteous infant genius at the knee of the
dying queen, on which he rests his elbow to form a support for his head
as though dropping off into a gentle slumber. The traditional
attitude <span id="fr_92"></span>[\*](#fn_91.md) retained its significancy
well understood far down into the Middle Ages: witness so many
cross-legged effigies of warriors resting from their toils--who for that
sole reason popularly pass for crusaders.

But in the whole long catalogue of emblems, not one expressed the
*abstract* idea so definitely as that most frequently employed in such
sense--the Gorgon's Head. Accepting the explanation already offered ([p.
167](gar24.htm#page_167).md), that at its origin this terrific visage was
designed for the "vera effigies" of the Queen of the dead, it was the
most speaking emblem of her office that could possibly be chosen. In the
Heroic ages it was universally *painted*, or embossed upon the warrior's
shield; and with the progress of art, cut in cameo, became the regular
decoration of the imperial breastplate; <span
id="fr_93"></span>[†](#fn_92.md) in which post it served, as Lucian remarks
('Philopatris'), "both to terrify enemies and to avert all danger from
the wearer," conveying to all beholders the menace of death exactly as
now by an un designed coincidence does the death's head and cross-bones
painted upon the pirate's flag. The Byzantines, in the true spirit of
their gloomy superstition, discarded the Præ-Italian type for whose
beauty they had lost all feeling, and reverted to the image invented by
the horror-loving genius of Pelasgic barbarism. They saw in it the most
faithful representation of their Μοῖρα, the destroying demon or *ghoul*,
still believed by the Greek peasant to haunt

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

ruins and desolate places. That the figure was received in such a sense
into Byzantine symbolism, the examples of amulets already quoted
convincingly declare. From Byzantine the Gorgon passed into Gothic art,
which ever revelling in grotesque horror, its inspiring genius being the
*skeleton* which intrudes his ghastliness into every mode of
ornamentation, even of a mirror-frame (Lucrezia Borgia's for example)
contrived to render the image yet more terrible by converting the face
into a fleshless skull, and substituting for the hawk's wings lent by
Hermes, which previously impelled its flight, the skinny pillions of her
own congenial and much-loved fowl, the sepulchre-haunting *bat*.

But of all these emblems, not one is so full of poetry and truth as the
device of the *Winged Foot* crushing the Butterfly, Life. The Foot,
chosen probably for the same reason as the Horse, as conveying most
speakingly the notion of *departure*, was equally accepted as the emblem
of death. Horace's simile must occur to every reader:--

"Pallida Mors æquo pulsat *pede* pauperum tabernas  
 Regumque turres."

On this account the Foot became the peculiar attribute of the infernal
deities; and the figure of one carved in stone was often dedicated in
the temple of Serapis <span id="fr_94"></span>[\*](#fn_93.md)--apparently
as an *ex voto* commemorating the donor's escape from the very threshold
of his dark domain. Singularly related to this custom is what Moor
notices of the pairs of feet carved in stone commonly seen in the
vicinity of Hindoo temples, traditionally said to be memorials of
*suttees*, marking the spot whence the devoted widow stepped from earth
upon the funeral pile, that is into the Gate of Heaven.

It has long been a question how the Grecian *Hades* ("The Invisible
One") and the Roman *Pluto* were depicted in a bodily form as they were
originally conceived--for their *Egyptian* equivalent, Serapis, figures
much more frequently in

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

monuments of Imperial date than either of his brethren, Jove or Neptune.
In the latter style he is regularly sculptured as *Plutus*, "Lord of
Riches," seated on a throne, holding a cornucopia, and extending with
his right hand a cluster of earth's choicest gifts. But under what form
the primitive Greeks had imagined their Aïdoneus, God of the Shades,
before Serapis was introduced into their mythology, is a question that
has never been satisfactorily answered. We should have found him on the
scarabeus of the Etruscans and early Italiotes, had not a long-enduring
respect for things divine (expressly enjoined by Pythagoras) prevented
their placing in their signets, used for everyday purposes, the actual
figures of the gods, whose absence they supplied by their well-known
attributes. For this reason a popular Etruscan seal-device is Cerberus,
represented sometimes as a man with three heads of a dog, but more
commonly in the shape so familiar to us from later arts. But the
Egyptians had contrived to make their Guardian of the Shades much more
formidable in aspect by equipping him with the heads of a lion,
crocodile, and hippopotamus. We are also certified in what shape the
Etruscans imaged their god of the lower world, *Mantus*; for he is
painted with serpent legs, like Typhon, wielding a huge butcher's
cleaver, and attended by Cerberus, enthroned upon the court placed below
the niche of interment, *loculus*, in the Campana tomb, Cervetri.

The "Helmet of Hades" is named by Homer (v. 845), which Pallas puts on
in order to render herself invisible to Ares which *helmet* the
scholiast explains by "cloud and invisibility"--whence it seems but
natural to infer that, as this deity was rendered *invisible* by his
very attribute, no attempt would be made to depict his personal
appearance. A figure of a god in long flowing robes, and wielding a
trident wanting one of its prongs, sometimes painted on the Nolan vases,
has been taken for an Aïdoneus, but on no sufficient grounds, there
being better reason to consider him a Poseidon in the archaic style. The
epithet "Renowned for horses" is given to the same god elsewhere by
Homer (v. 445), allusive doubtless to the *swiftness* of the Destroyer:
and in the same title may, perchance, lie the motive which made the
Greeks adopt the *horse*, as above noticed,

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

for the commonest symbol of his power. If we could meet with any genuine
antique and *early* representation of the Rape of Proserpine it would at
once decide the question by portraying the grim Ravisher himself; but
the inauspicious nature of the subject (so conspicuously set forth in
Suetonius’ anecdote of the ring with the story presented by Sporus to
Nero for a New Year's gift) has completely excluded it from the artist's
repertory, so far as anything now remaining informs us. Stosch's
Collection, amongst its immense [variety](errata.htm#10.md) of mythological
designs, contains nothing of the sort, whilst Raspe gives for its
representative only a single antique paste (and that, too, of very
dubious attribution) where a god with quiver on shoulder is carrying off
a Nymph in a car drawn by two swans--attributes properly bespeaking an
Apollo; and if really given here to Pluto, proving the work to belong to
those latter times of Paganism when Hades, Serapis, Phœbus, were equally
interpreted as mere titles of the Solar god.

As for the Roman Pluto, or, to give him his native name, *Dis* (*ditis*,
from the same root as *death*), there was the best of reasons for
excluding him from the province of art which admitted nought that was
hideous or of evil augury. For there can be no doubt, that, to the
popular imagination, he still continued the *Charun*, <span
id="fr_95"></span>[\*](#fn_94.md) whom we still behold lording it over the
sepulchres of their Etruscan teachers in the arts, a giant of horrid
aspect with pointed ears, and frisky grinning jaws, winged buskins on
legs, extending with one hand a hissing serpent, with the other wielding
a monstrous mall. It was probably the traditional influence of the idea
that caused the same instrument; *mazza*, to be retained at Rome for the
execution of peculiarly atrocious criminals down to the recent
introduction of the guillotine.

That Pluto was really so personified in the shows of the Amphitheatre,
as late as the third century, may be gathered from the remark of
Tertullian (Apol. xxv.), that, "amongst the other scenic cruelties of
the afternoon, the spectators laughed at the sight of Mercury raising
the dead with his *red-hot* wand \[applied doubtless to the feet of the
slaughtered gladiators to

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

ascertain if life still lingered within them\]; whilst the 'Brother of
Jupiter,' armed with his *mall*, escorted the dead bodies of the
combatant" \[for the purpose clearly of giving them the *coup de
grâce*\]. The primitive Etruscan image passed down into the belief of
their mediæval descendants, for Dante brings on the stage:--

"Charon, demonio con occhi di bragia."  
"*Charon, a devil with live-coals for eyes*."

It is time now to dismiss the Lord of the Shades, and to consider by
what *Emblem* ancient art sought to express the *Shade* itself, the
disembodied spirit. The Greeks of early times appropriately painted it
in the shape of a *bird* with a human head, as on that beautiful vase,
"The Death of Procris" (British Museum), where such a fowl is
conspicuously seen winging its flight from the month of the wounded
Nymph. The celebrated Orléans (now Russian) scarabeus, engraved with the
"Death of Achilles," has its back carved into the same creature, tearing
her breast in an agony of despair. This expressive type was not,
however, the birth of Grecian genius, but adopted, without alteration,
from the most ancient symbolism of Egypt. In the "Judgment of the body
and soul," regularly painted on the mummy-cases, the former, depicted as
a mummy, stands before Osiris, "Lord of the West," to answer for its
*actions;* whilst the soul, in shape of a hawk, with human head and
wings uplifted, is brought before the same god under another form, to
give an account of its *thoughts*. And the same soul, purified, and
admitted amongst the gods, appears as before, but tranquilly standing
with a golden disk, "a crown of glory," set upon her head: figures of
the last kind in bronze frequently occurring amongst Egyptian remains,
complimentary mementoes of deceased friends. Again, this same bird is
often found painted on the mummy-case right over the *heart* (named in
Coptic, "the abode of the soul"), a plain proof of what it signifies
there; although Father Kircher, with his wonted extravagance, chose to
explain it as figuring the *iynx*, the bird so renowned in the magical
operations of the Greeks. Again, the same notion is expressed by the
simple figure of a bird flying away, as often is done in Etruscan works,
where the subject represented is the

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

death of a hero. Latest of all, this somewhat grotesque Egyptian
conception was modified by Grecian culture into the graceful girl with
butterfly wings--the well-known Psyche--and such a form is seen seated
upon the summit of Achilles’ tomb, before which the sacrifice of
Polyxena is about to be offered. This ancient human-headed Bird, by a
natural transition of ideas, came ultimately to be applied to express a
widely different meaning. Instead of the *dead*, it was made to stand
for the *destroyer;* and the Syrens are always painted in this shape
whenever their interview with Ulysses becomes the theme of ancient art,
or when they engage in their unlucky contest with the Muses. But here,
for the sake of more grace, in the conformation of the monster, the
whole of the female bust is adapted to the body of the fowl. Despite
their beauty and melodiousness, the Syrens were considered as the most
malignant and destructive of beings, for which reason the *Harpies*
likewise were depicted in precisely the same figure. Although identical
at first, the more refining art of Roman times introduced a distinction
between them by giving to the Syrens the complete *bust*, to the Harpies
the *head* only of the woman. Inasmuch as the name signifies
"Snatcher-away," the Harpy was understood to embody the abstract idea of
death, which acceptation explains why she is often represented armed
with a sword, or carrying on her shoulder the funeral *lecythus*, and
torch. For the same reason the Harpy holds a conspicuous place in the
decorations of many ancient tombs, [unless](errata.htm#11.md), indeed, the
emblem may have been used there in its Egyptian sense.

In what shape Death was personified by Euripides, in his Alcestis,
cannot be made out from the insufficiency of data afforded by the lines
relating to his appearance on the stage. It is, however, plain that the
poet brought forward Θάνατος in a bodily form, perhaps considering him
the same with Aïdoneus, for he styles him "King of the Dead;" and
Macrobius, speaking of the same event, uses for his name the Roman
equivalent, "Orcus." All that can be gathered from the incidental
allusions of the other *dramatis personæ* to this apparition, is that he
was robed in *black*, and carried a *sword*, wherewith to sever a lock
from the head of his destined victim, and so devote it to

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

the subterranean gods. It is, however, possible that Euripides brought
on this Θάνατος in that harpy shape which sometimes is found in antique
art where the bust is that of a grim aged man, in place of the smiling
female's, and who, as badge of office, carries a naked *sword*. In such
a form the Destroyer must have flitted before the eyes of Statius, when
about to make prey of the young and beautiful Glaucius:--

                   "Subitas inimica levavit  
Parca manus; quo diva feros gravis exuis *ungues?*"

This last word can apply to nothing but the Harpy, of whom *claws* were
the distinctive attribute:--

"*Unguibus* ire parat nummos raptura Celæno." <span
id="fr_96"></span>[\*](#fn_95.md)

Nevertheless, a representation like this had in it nothing grotesque or
offensive to the Athenian eye. Far different was the Pelasgic Κῆρ,
likewise *robed in black* (according to Homer's normal epithet for her),
in the form which the archaic sculptor had given her upon the Coffer of
Cypselus, "having tusks as fierce as those of any wild beast." Such a
conception was eagerly embraced by the gloomy genius of the Etruscans,
ever delighting in the monstrous and the horrible. She therefore figures
on their signets in a form to be described in the very words of
Pausanias, having a huge Gorgonian head, grinning jaws, arms wreathed
with serpents, impelled by quadruple wings, like an Assyrian deity, and
her action that of furious haste. So, doubtless, appeared the Furies,
brought on the stage by Æschylus, when the horror of their strange
aspect struck the Athenian audience with such deadly fright. For his
purpose he must have revived a very ancient and *forgotten* type of the
idea, for the paintings on the vases of his epoch exhibit the Eumenides,
who persecute Orestes, under a no more terrific form than as shadowy old
women brandishing serpents and torches, as they chase their victim from
shrine to shrine.
