### TOMB-TREASURES.

Serapis, in his double character of God of Death and God of Riches, has
been the subject of preceding chapters; the present one shall be devoted
to the consideration of the most striking method by which human
superstition sought to turn to account the two ideas. To propitiate the
*Manes* by placing his most valuable or beloved effects in the sepulchre
of the defunct, dates probably from the very institution of interment;
but the account now to be cited is the most interesting of any on
record, owing to the circumstances of the time, person, and place. It is
literally translated from the description of an eye witness, the
earliest of Italian antiquaries, M. L. Fauno, given in his 'Antichita de
Roma,' p. 154, published 1553.

"In February, 1544, in the Chapel of the King of France, which is now
being built in St. Peter's, after the plan of Julius II., the workmen,
in excavating, came upon a marble coffin, which, from the things found
therein, was clearly known to be the tomb of Maria, wife of the Emperor
Honorius. Of the body, indeed, there was nothing left, except the teeth,
the hair, and the two leg-bones. From the robes which were interwoven
with gold, and from the head-tire, which was cloth of silk and gold,
there was extracted by smelting more than *forty* pounds weight of the
purest gold." \[Suecius says *thirty-six*, but makes the total of all
the gold found to amount to the above weight when they were melted down
by order of Paul III., to be applied to the building fund of the
Cathedral.\]

"Within the coffin lay a silver box, one and a half foot long by eight
inches deep, with many articles inside, the which we shall proceed
particularly to describe. There were vases and different things in rock
crystal, thirty in all, big and little; amongst which were two cups, as
it were, not very large, the one round, the other oval shaped, with most
beautiful figures in intaglio of middling depth (*mezzo-cavo*), and a
*snail-shell* (nautilus), likewise in crystal, fitted up for a lamp in
fine gold, with which in the first place the mouth of the shell is
overlaid, there being only left a hole for pouring in the oil; by the
side

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

of which hole is fixed a *fly* of gold upon a pivot, turning backwards
and forwards, for the purpose of closing the orifice. In the same way is
also made a nozzle with beak (*pippio*) for holding the wick, drawn out
long and sharpened with the greatest elegance, and so fastened to the
crystal that it appears all one piece naturally. The cover also is
equally well made. The shape of the shell is that of a great sea-shell,
encompassed all round with its points, which in this vessel are polished
and very smooth, so excellently wrought is the crystal. There were also
vases and various articles in agate, with certain little animals, eight
in all, and amongst them two very beautiful vases, one like the glass
*ampullae*, made big and squat for holding oil and such like liquids, so
worked, so beautiful, and thin that it is a wonder to behold. The other
is in the shape of those ladles with long handles used at Rome for
baling water out of cisterns, and is supposed to be a vessel used by the
ancients in their sacrifices \[a *lingula* for the purpose of ladling
the wine out of the great standing *crater*\]. Next came four little
vessels in gold of different kinds, and another little vessel of gold
with a cover set round with jewels. A little gold heart that had been a
pendant with jewels set in it; a buckle of gold with six gems of
different kinds set in it, also twenty-four other buckles of gold of
various patterns with little gems set in them; furthermore, forty-eight
rings and *hoops* <span id="fr_97"></span>[\*](#fn_96.md) of gold of
different shapes, one of them in red hone, and various gems. A mouse in
"chelidonia," a reddish quartz, is also specified by Suecius \[which
must be the next item\], also three little animals in *red bone*; also
two ear-drops in emerald or plasma with two jacinths; four small crosses
with red and green stones; a pendant in the form of a bunch of grapes,
made of purple stones; eight other little gold pendants of different
sorts with gems set in them. The remains of a string of *crepundia*, the
usual decoration of little children. \[Maria had died at the age of
*four*, being thus early betrothed to Honorius by his father the
all-powerful Stilicho\]. Three little gold crosses set with emeralds; a
piece of a small fine necklace with certain green

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

stones strung upon it. Another little gold necklace with twenty-four
beads of plasma. Another necklace with twelve heads of sapphire cut
almond shape. Another little necklace of gold wire folded up
(*raccolto*), but broken into four pieces. Two small buttons in gold;
fourteen little gold-wire rings like those of a coat of mail; three more
crosses with some emeralds, and a round gold plate 'like an Agnus
Dei, <span id="fr_98"></span>[\*](#fn_97.md) with these words upon it,
**STILICHO VIVAT**. Two bracelets (*maniche*) of gold, set with certain
red and green stones. Two large pins or *stiletti* for the hair, one in
gold nearly a palm (nine inches) long inscribed with these words,
**DOMINVS HONORIVS DOMINA MARIA:** the other in silver without
inscription. There were likewise many fragments of enamels and other
stones. Also silver nails \[their heads\] partly flat, partly in relief,
which had fastened down a cover of silver upon a little coffer. Also a
small plate of gold with these words written or rather *scratched* in
Greek, **MICHAEL • GABRIEL • RAPHAEL • VRIEL •**" \[Laurentius Surius
makes out *forty* gold rings set with precious stones, besides an
emerald set in gold, engraved with a head supposed to be that of
Honorius, which was valued at five hundred gold ducats\]. We have
particularly described all the above-named objects because Claudian, a
poet of those times, declares that to the Empress Maria were sent
similar rare presents from her betrothed; which perhaps may have formed
the greatest part of these things. The words of the poet are--

            "Jam munera nuptæ  
Præparat, et pulchros Mariæ sed luce minores  
Elicit ornatus: quidquid venerabilis olim  
Livia, divorumque nurus gessere superbæ." (x. 10-13.)

This account enables us to form some notion of the treasures deposited
to a greater or less degree in all the tombs of important personages,
but more especially in those sumptuous structures raised to the memory
of the dead throughout Asia Minor. The same fact sufficiently accounts
for the furious onslaught made upon the tombs all over the Roman world,
so soon as the change of religion had extinguished the old veneration
for the *Manes* and the things consecrated to them--a profanation, and a

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

destruction of works of art, which Gregorius Theologus, inspired by a
taste and good feeling very surprising in a Byzantine saint, has
attacked in one hundred and eighty-two very interesting and often
poetical epigrams.

The same custom was kept up (although we can hardly suppose with any
lingering belief in its ancient efficiency) by the Merovingian and
Carlovingian successors to the wealth of the Western Empire. The learned
Canon Chiflet has left in his interesting book, 'Anastasis Childerici
Regis,' a complete history of tomb-treasures, serving to illustrate his
account of that of Childeric the Frank, accidentally found in the
precincts of Tournay Cathedral, May 1654. The deposit, as far it could
be recovered from the first finders, consisted of the arms of the king,
the trappings of his horse (buried with him), all of gold encrusted with
garnets, his gold tablets and writing-stylus, abundance of golden-bees
originally stretched over his mantle (which gave that curious idea to
Napoleon I.), a bull's head for a pendant (the primitive Frankish badge
of sovereignty), and lastly, a *viaticum* in the shape of one hundred
Byzantine *solidi* of contemporary emperors, and as many denarii of
several and much earlier Cæsars. The canon, by zealous perquisitions,
succeeded in recovering all these articles, including the most important
of all, the royal signet ring of massy gold, engraved with the image and
superscription of Childeric, for his patron the Archduke Leopold, then
governor of the Low Countries. At some subsequent period the most
important of these relics passed into the collection of the Bibliothèque
Impériale, where they continued in all due honour until the disastrous
robbery of 1808, when it is supposed, with too much probability, that
they were melted down along with the rest of the booty!
