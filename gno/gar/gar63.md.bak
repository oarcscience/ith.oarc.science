### The Assassins

But Gnosticism in one shape or other, was still surviving in the very
head-quarters of the Order, amongst their closest allies or enemies, the
mountaineers of Syria. The Templar-Order had been modelled after an
original, the last to be looked for according to modern views, for Von
Hammer has here been successful in demonstrating that its constitution
is a servile copy of that of the detested "Assassins." The statutes of
the latter prove the fact beyond all gainsaying; they were found upon
the captives of their capital, Alamoot, by the Mogul, Halakoo, in the
year 1335, when by a most singular coincidence, Caliph and Pope were
busied in exterminating the model and the copy in the East and West, at
one and the same time. From these documents were verified the "Eight
Degrees" of initiation as established by Hassan, the first Grand Master
or "Prince of the Mountain." These degrees, probably suggested by the
ancient Mithraic tests, were:--

   I. The Trial of knowledge.

  II. The Trial of Persuasiveness; *i.e.*, the talent for proselytism.

 III. Denial of the truth of the Koran, and of all other sacred
scriptures.

  IV. The Trial of silent and perfect obedience.

   V. The Disclosure of the names of the Great Brothers of the Order,
royal, sacerdotal and patrician, *in all parts of the world*.

  VI. The Confirmation of all the preceding steps of knowledge.

 VII. The Allegorical interpretation of the Koran, and of all

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

other scriptures. In this lodge the divinity of all founders of
religious systems was alike denied. Religion was shown to be a mere step
to *knowledge*, its narratives to be merely allegorical and exhibiting
the progress of civil society: thus, *Man's Fall* signified political
slavery; *Redemption* his restoration to liberty and equality.

VIII\. That all actions were indifferent, provided only they were done
for the good of the Order; <span id="fr_252"></span>[\*](#fn_250.md) there
being no such thing, absolutely, as vice or virtue.

It will be seen that the principle running through these "Degrees" is
identical with that pervading the main counts in the Articles of
Accusation brought against the Templars.

The same author (*History of the Assassins*) shows that the organization
of the Templars was exactly modelled upon that of the Assassins, and
thus confronts the several degrees in each of the two orders.

*Of the Assassins*.

  I. The Grand Master, or Prince of the Mountain.

 II. The Dais-al-Kabir, or three great viceroys under him.

III\. The Dais, or provincial masters.

 IV. The Refek, or chaplains.

  V. The Lazik, or military body.

 VI. The Fedavee, or death-devoted.

VII\. The Batinee, or secret brethren, *i.e.*, those affiliated to the
order.

*Of the Templars*.

   I. The Grand Master.

  II. The three Grand Priors.

 III. The Provincial Prior.

  IV. The Chaplains.

   V. The Knights.

  VI. The Esquires.

 VII. The Serving-brethren.

VIII\. The Donati and Oblati.

  IX. The Affiliati. <span id="fr_253"></span>[†](#fn_251.md)

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

The "Donati" and "Oblati" were sworn, in return for the protection
afforded to them by the Order, to leave to it all their property at
their deaths, and consequently to refrain from having offspring, or even
to stand sponsors to the children of others. If married at the time of
joining the Order, they were bound to put away their wives. Infraction
of the vow was punished by perpetual imprisonment. The "Affiliati" had,
probably, nothing to do with the secrets of the Order; they merely, in
return for a certain sum paid down, received their daily maintenance
(their *commons*) out of the corporate fund; such an arrangement being a
simple anticipation of the principle of life annuities, and admirably
suited to the requirements of those barbarous times.

It is not a matter for surprise that the grand elements of ancient
Gnosticism should have thus been discovered lurking in the secret rules
of the Order of Assassins; when the origin of that order is
investigated, it proves to be only a branch of the Ismaelites, or those
Persians who supported the cause of the descendants of Ali. But
Abdallah, himself a *Magian*, had from the beginning founded in the
midst of these Ismaelites, a secret society composed of those Persians
who had, through Arab compulsion, embraced Mohammedanism only in name.
By inculcating those vital dogmas of the old Gnosis, that *knowledge*
was the real end of Religion, and that in all scriptures the
*allegorical* interpretation was the only true one, Abdallah united
under his teaching the remnants of all the older religions that still
lurked in Persia, in fact he did in Persia under the Caliph, what the
new Manichean Chrysocheir was doing at Tephrice under the Byzantine
emperor. The Ismaelites having gradually become absorbed into the new
sect, succeeded, in the tenth century, in placing a prince of Ali's line
upon the throne of Cairo, thus founding the Fatimite dynasty. After
this, Hassan, who had served with distinction under the Seljuk Sultans,
aided by his brethren to when he had returned, having captured the hill
fortress of Alamoot or 'The Vultures’ Nest' (1090 A.D.), set himself up
there as an independent prince, and established

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

his community as a *political body*, under the constitution already
described. In a short time these bold sectaries made themselves masters
of all the strong places of Lebanon, thereby securing their independence
of the Egyptian Caliph. The Druses are only the modern representatives
of the suppressed Assassins. Like them, they are Ismaelites, their
ostensible founder being Hakim, a Fatemite Caliph of Cairo, who
professed himself the new incarnation of the Godhead. Their notion that
the present seat of their ever absent Grand Master is *Europe*, tallies
curiously enough with Von Hammer's theory about the close relationship
that existed between the Templars and the actual progenitors of the
Druses. These same Druses may also possibly represent the 'polytheists
and Samaritans' who flourished so vigorously in the Lebanon as late as
the times of Justinian, to whose persecuting zeal Procopius ascribes the
extermination of a *million* inhabitants of that district alone. Of
their present creed, preserved in unviolated secrecy, nothing authentic
has ever come to light; popular belief amongst their neighbours makes
them adorers of an idol in the form of a calf, and to celebrate their
nocturnal assemblies, orgies like those laid to the charge of the
Ophites in Roman, of the Templars in mediæval, and of the Freemasons
(continental) in modern times. Their notion of their Head residing in
*Scotland* has an odd resemblance to the German appellation "Scottish
Brethren," given to our Masons. Some such association of ideas seems to
have led the Lessing to maintain that "Freemason," in German *Masson*,
has nothing whatever to do with the English meaning of the word, but
comes from *mass* only, the proper name for a Templar lodge, called also
a "Round Table." For this derivation he cites Agricola, an authority
removed by no more than 150 years from the date of the suppression of
the Order. On this account, he adds, the old Templar buildings in
Bologna and Milan still retain the title "de la magione," that is, "of
the *masson;*" although a less acute critic would, most assuredly, only
be able to discover here nothing deeper than an Italian corruption of
the French *maison* in its common sense.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_250"></span>[411:\*](gar63.htm#fr_252.md) The maxim of the
Jesuits "that implicit obedience includes the commission of a *mortal*
sin."

<span id="fn_251"></span>[411:†](gar63.htm#fr_253.md) The benefits of
affiliation were obtained at the small annual fee of two or three
*deniers*. One of the <span id="page_412">p. 412</span> chief causes of
Philippe le Bel's hatred against the order was their refusal, in the
early part of his reign to admit him into this class.
