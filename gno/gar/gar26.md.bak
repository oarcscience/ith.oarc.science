### THE *CADUCEUS*, AND ITS SYMBOLISM.

Macrobius seems to afford us some clue for solving this enigma by his
remarks upon the true universality of the sun-worship under different
names (Sat. i. 19). "That under the form of Mercury the *Sun* is really
worshipped is evident also from the *Caduceus* which the Egyptians have
fashioned in the shape of two dragons (asps), male and female joined
together, and consecrated to Mercury. These serpents in the middle parts
of their volume are tied together in the knot called the 'Knot of
Hercules;' whilst their upper parts bending backwards in a circle, by
pressing their mouths together as if kissing complete the circumference
of the circle; and their tails are carried back to touch the staff of
the Caduceus; and adorn the latter with wings springing out of the same
part of the staff. The meaning of the Caduceus with reference to the
nativity of man, technically termed his *genesis* (or horoscope), is
thus explained by the Egyptians: they teach that *four deities* preside
and attend at man's birth--the Daimon (his genius), Fortune, Love, and
Necessity. By the two first of these they hold that the Sun and the Moon
are meant; because the Sun, as the author of spirit, heat, and light, is
the producer and guardian of human life, and therefore is esteemed the
*Daimon* that is the *god* of the person born. The Moon is the
*Fortune*, because she is the president over our bodies which are the
sport of a variety of accidents. *Love* is signified by the kissing of
the serpents; *Necessity*, by the knot in which they are tied. The
reason for adding the *wings* has been fully discussed above. For a
symbol of this nature the convolution of the serpents has been selected
in preference to anything else, because of the *flexuosity* of the
course of both these luminaries. From this cause it comes, that the
serpent is attached to the figures both of Aesculapius and of Hygiea,
because these deities are explained as expressing the nature of the Sun
and the Moon. For Aesculapius is the health-giving influence proceeding
out of the substance of the

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sun, that benefits
the souls and bodies of mortals. <span id="fr_88"></span>[\*](#fn_87.md)
Hygieia again is the influence of the nature of the Moon, by which the
bodies of things animated are holpen, being strengthened by her
health-giving sway. For this reason, therefore, the figure of the
serpent is attached to the statues of both deities, because they bring
it about that our bodies strip off, as it were, the slough of their
maladies, and are restored to their pristine vigour, just as serpents
renew their youth every year, by casting off the slough of old age. And
the figure of the serpent is explained as an emblem of the Sun himself
for the reason that the Sun is perpetually returning out of, as it were,
the old age of his lowest setting, up to his full meridian height as if
to the vigour of youth. Moreover, that the dragon is one of the chiefest
emblems of the Sun, is manifest from the derivation of the name, it
being so called from δέρκειν, 'to see.' For they teach that this
serpent, by his extremely acute and never-sleeping sight, typifies the
nature of the luminary; and on this account the guardianship of temples,
shrines, oracles, and treasures is assigned to dragons. That Aesculapius
is the same with Apollo is further proved by this fact, not merely that
he is reputed the son of the latter, but because he also is invested
with the privilege of divination. For Apollodorus, in his Treatise on
Theology, lays down that Aesculapius presides over augury and oracles.
And no wonder; seeing that the sciences of medicine and of divination
are cognate sciences: for medicine predicts the changes for good or ill
about to succeed in the human body. As Hippocrates hath it, the
physician should be competent to predicate of his patient 'both his
present, his past and future condition,' which is the same thing as
divination which foreknows, as Homer says,

'The things that be, that shall be, and that were.'"

It has been already stated how, in the Mithraic worship, the image,
surrounded from foot to head by the spiral convolutions of the serpent,
had become the established emblem of the deity himself. The incidental
remark in the above citation, that the

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

flexuous motion of the reptile represented to the Egyptians, the annual
course of the sun, affords the sufficient reason why his image should be
thus encircled by so significant an attribute. Taking therefore into
account the fact that the disputed symbol we are considering was by its
nature primarily confined to talismans designed for medical agents,
there is at once sufficient reason to suppose it connected with the
worship of Aesculapius; and secondly, as it always appears in such cases
in company with the Agathodæmon, the undoubted emblem of the Solar god,
it may be inferred to be either a symbol or a hieroglyphical
representation in little of the same type. In other words, the *figure*
signifies nothing more than a serpent-entwined wand, and its *sense*
only contains an allusion to the principal visible manifestation of the
nature of the Sun. But this point must he left for fuller examination in
its connexion with the hitherto unexplained Sigil which invariably makes
its appearance on the reverse of the Chnuphis talismans, and which
therefore must have been regarded as an essential element in their
potency.
