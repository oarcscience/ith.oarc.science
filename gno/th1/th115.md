##### THE TRUE INITIATES OF ISIS

III\. 1. Yet many have set down that she is Hermes’ daughter, and many
\[that she is\] Prometheus’s,—I holding the latter as discoverer of
wisdom and foreknowledge, and Hermes of the art of letters and the
Muses’ art.

2\. Wherefore, in Hermes-city, they call the foremost of the Muses Isis,
as well as Righteousness, <span id="fr_793"></span>[4](#fn_794.md) in that
she’s

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

wise, <span id="fr_794"></span>[1](#fn_795.md) as has been said, <span
id="fr_795"></span>[2](#fn_796.md) and shows <span
id="fr_796"></span>[3](#fn_797.md) the mysteries of the Gods to those who
are with truth and justice called the Carriers of the holy \[symbols\]
and Wearers of the holy robes. <span id="fr_797"></span>[4](#fn_798.md)

3\. And these are they who carry the holy reason (*logos*) about the
Gods, purged of all superstition and superfluity, in their soul, as in a
chest, and cast robes round it <span id="fr_798"></span>[5](#fn_799.md)—in
secret disclosing such \[things\] of the opinion <span
id="fr_799"></span>[6](#fn_800.md) about the Gods as are black and shadowy,
and such as are clear and bright, just as they are suggested by the
\[sacred\] dress.

4\. Wherefore when the initiates of Isis at their “death” are adorned in
these \[robes\], it is a symbol that this Reason (*Logos*) is with them;
and with Him and naught else they go there. <span
id="fr_800"></span>[7](#fn_801.md)

5\. For it is not the growing beard and wearing cloak that makes
philosophers, O Klea, nor clothing in linen and shaving oneself that
makes initiates of Isis; but a true Isiac is one who, when he by
law <span id="fr_801"></span>[8](#fn_802.md) receives them, searches out by
reason (*logos*) the \[mysteries\] shown and

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

done concerning these Gods, and meditates upon the truth in them.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_794"></span>[263:4](th115.htm#fr_793.md) δικαιοσύνην, or
Justice (Maāt), that is, the “power of the Judge,” Hermes being Judge of
the Scales. The Nine are the Paut of Hermes, he being the tenth, the
mystery being here read differently from the Ogdoad point of view—that
is to say, macrocosmically instead of cosmically.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[264:1](th115.htm#fr_794.md) Or, perhaps, the
reading should be “Wisdom.”

<span id="fn_796"></span>[264:2](th115.htm#fr_795.md) *Cf.* ii. 1.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[264:3](th115.htm#fr_796.md) δεικνύουσαν—probably
a play on δικαιοσύνην.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[264:4](th115.htm#fr_797.md) ἱεροφόροις καὶ
ἱεροστόλοις. Plutarch by his “with truth and justice” warns the reader
against taking these words to mean simply the carriers of the sacred
vessels and instruments in the public processions, and the sacristans or
keepers of the sacred vestments.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[264:5](th115.htm#fr_798.md) περιστέλλοντες, which
also means *componere*—that is, to lay out a corpse and so to bury.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[264:6](th115.htm#fr_799.md) οἰήσεως = δόξης,
appearance, seeming—that is, the public myth; as opposed to λόγος =
ἐπιστήμη, knowledge or reality.

<span id="fn_801"></span>[264:7](th115.htm#fr_800.md) Or “walk there”—that
is, in “Hades.” Or, again, the “death” is the death unto sin when they
become Alive and walk among the “dead” or ordinary men.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[264:8](th115.htm#fr_801.md) That is, when the
initiation is a lawful one, or really takes effect; when a man’s karma
permits it, that is, after passing the proper tests.
