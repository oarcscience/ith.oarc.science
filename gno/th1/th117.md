##### OF THE REFRAINING FROM FLESH AND SALT AND SUPERFLUITIES

V. 1. And the priests handle so hardly <span
id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_811.md) the nature of superfluities, that they
not only deprecate the many kinds of pulse, and of meats the
sheep-flesh <span id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_812.md) kinds and swine-flesh
kinds, as making much superfluity, but also at their times of
purification they remove the salts from the grains, <span
id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_813.md) having other further reasons as well as
the fact that it makes the more thirsty and more hungry sharpen their
desire the more.

2\. For to argue that salts are not pure owing to the multitude of small
lives <span id="fr_813"></span>[4](#fn_814.md) that are caught <span
id="fr_814"></span>[5](#fn_815.md) and die in them when they solidify
themselves, as Aristagoras said, <span id="fr_815"></span>[6](#fn_816.md)
is naïve.

3\. They are, moreover, said to water the Apis also from a special well,
and by all means to keep him from the Nile,—not that they think
His <span id="fr_816"></span>[7](#fn_817.md) water stained with blood
because of the Crocodile, <span id="fr_817"></span>[8](#fn_818.md) as some
think (for nothing is so precious to Egyptians as the Nile),

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

but that the water of Nile’s superfluity <span
id="fr_818"></span>[1](#fn_819.md) on being drunk seems to make fat, nay,
rather to make much too much of flesh.

4\. And \[so\] they do not wish the Apis to be so nor yet themselves,
but \[wish\] to wear their bodies on their souls compact and light, and
neither to com-press nor op-press them by the mortal part prevailing and
its weighing down of the divine.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_811"></span>[267:1](th117.htm#fr_810.md) *Vulg.,* “endure with
such difficulty” or “feel such disgust at.”

<span id="fn_812"></span>[267:2](th117.htm#fr_811.md) Referring usually to
small animals of the sheep and goat kind, and more generally to all
sacrificial animals.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[267:3](th117.htm#fr_812.md) Or, perhaps, more
generally, “the salt from their food.” It more probably refers to
mineral and not to vegetable salts.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[267:4](th117.htm#fr_813.md) That is *animalculæ*.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[267:5](th117.htm#fr_814.md) ἁλισκόμενα—probably a
word-play on ἅλας (salts).

<span id="fn_816"></span>[267:6](th117.htm#fr_815.md) Müller, ii. 99.
Aristagoras was a Greek writer on Egypt, who flourished about the last
quarter of the 4th century B.C.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[267:7](th117.htm#fr_816.md) Namely the Nile, as
Osiris, or the Great Deep.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[267:8](th117.htm#fr_817.md) Mystically the
“Leviathan” (*e.g.* of the “Ophites”) who lived in the Great Deep. *Cf.*
also Ps. civ. 26, where, speaking of the Great Sea (25), it is written:
“There go the ships \[the *barides,* boats, or vehicles of souls\], and
there is that Leviathan \[LXX. Dragon\] whom thou hast fashioned to take
his pastime \[LXX. sport or mock\] therein.”

<span id="fn_819"></span>[268:1](th117.htm#fr_818.md) τὸ Νειλῷον ὕδωρ—τὰ
Νειλῷα was the Feast of the Overflowing of the Nile.
