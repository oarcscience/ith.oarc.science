### IV

#### THE POPULAR THEURGIC HERMES-CULT IN THE GREEK MAGIC PAPYRI

##### THE “RELIGION OF HERMES”

<span class="smallcaps">That</span> at one period the “Religion of
Hermes” was not only widely spread, but practically supreme, in popular
Hellenistic circles, may be seen from a study of the texts of the
numerous magic papyri which have been preserved, and made accessible to
us by the industry of such immensely laborious scholars as Leemans,
Dieterich, Wessely, and Kenyon.

The Greek Hermes prayers, as with many others of a similar nature, are
manifestly overworkings of more ancient types, and, as we might expect,
are of a strongly syncretistic nature. In them we can distinguish in
popular forms, based on the ancient traditions of Egyptian magic, most
interesting shadows of the philosophic and theosophic ideas which our
Trismegistic literature has set forth for us in the clear light of
dignified simplicity.

But just as we now know that the once so-called “Gnostic,” Abraxas and
Abraxoid amulets, gems, and rings pertained to the general popular
magical religion and had nothing to do with the Gnosis proper, so we may
be sure that the circles of high mysticism, who refused to offer to God
even so pure a sacrifice as

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

the burnt offering of incense, and deemed naught worthy of Him, short of
the “prayers and praises of the mind,” had nothing directly to do with
the popular Hermes prayers, least of all with the invocatory rites of
popular theurgy, and phylactery or amulet consecration.

Nevertheless, there is much of interest for us in these invocations, and
much that can throw side-lights on the higher teaching and practice
which transformed all external rites into the discipline of inner
spiritual experience.

The following prayers, which, as far as I know, have not been previously
translated, are rendered from the most recently revised texts of
Reitzenstein, who has omitted the magic names, and emended the previous
editions. I cannot but think, however, that these texts might be
submitted to a more searching analysis than has yet been accorded them.
They seem to present somewhat similar phenomena to the recensions of the
Book of the Dead; that is to say, fragments of material from the
tradition of a greater past have been adapted and overworked for the
needs of a lesser age. Indeed, the whole effort of the Trismegistic
schools seems to have been to restore the memory of that greater past;
it had been forgotten, and its dim record had become a superstition
instead of a living faith, a degenerate magic instead of a potent
theurgy. The theurgy of our prayers is that of dwarfs; the theurgy of
the past was believed to have been that of giants.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

wealth, good blend \[of nature\], <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134.md)
and good children, good fortune, and good burial. For thou art lord of

name; whom the eight Wardens guard,—thou the possessor of the
Truth <span id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135.md) pure of all lie!

9\. Thy Name and Spirit rest upon the good. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[3](#fn_136.md)

10\. O mayst thou come into my mind and heart for all the length of my
life’s days, and bring unto accomplishment all things my soul desires!

id="fr_137"></span>[4](#fn_137.md) Whate’er I speak, may it for ever be;

me in my heart. <span id="fr_139"></span>[6](#fn_139.md)

daimonial power, or any plague, or any of the evils in the Unseen
World; <span id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141.md) for that I have thy Name
within my soul.

13\. Thee I invoke; come unto me, Good, altogether good, \[come\] to the
good, <span id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_142.md)—thou whom no magic can
enchant, no magic can control, <span id="fr_143"></span>[4](#fn_143.md) who

good store, good fame, victory, \[and\] strength, and cheerful
countenance! <span id="fr_145"></span>[6](#fn_145.md)

2\. Come unto me, Lord Hermes, who dost collect the food of gods and

\[and\] food, \[and\] victory, \[and\] health and happiness, and
cheerful countenance, <span id="fr_149"></span>[1](#fn_149.md) beauty and

id="fr_151"></span>[3](#fn_151.md) I know thy wood <span

5\. I know thee, Hermes, who thou art, and whence thou art, and what thy
city is.

6\. I know thy names in the Egyptian tongue, <span
id="fr_153"></span>[5](#fn_153.md) and thy true name as it is written on
the holy tablet in the holy place at Hermes’ city, where thou dost have
thy birth.

thou art I. <span id="fr_154"></span>[6](#fn_154.md)

##### III. AN INVOCATION TO LORD HERMES

<span style="font-size: small">\[Revised and restored text, R. 21. It is
worked in with the preceding, but is of later date.\]</span>

1\. Come unto me, Lord Hermes, O thou of many names, who know’st the
secrets hidden both beneath the poles \[of heaven\] and underneath the
earth!

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

2\. Come unto me, Lord Hermes, thou benefactor, who doest good to all
the world!

3\. Give ear to me, \[and\] give me grace with all that are on earth;
open for me the hands of all that give like thee; <span
id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) \[and\] make them give me what their
hands contain!

4\. Even as Horus, <span id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_157.md) if e’er he
called on thee, O greatest of all gods, in every trial, in every space,
’gainst gods, and men, and daimones, and things that live in water and
on earth,—had grace and riches with gods, and men, and every living
thing beneath the earth;—so let me, too, who call on thee! So give me
grace, form, beauty!

6\. Hear me, O Hermes, doer of good deeds, thou the inventor of \[all\]
incantations, <span id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_158.md) speak me good
words! <span id="fr_159"></span>[4](#fn_159.md)

7\. Hear me, O Hermes, for I have done all things \[that I should do\]
for thy black dog-ape, <span id="fr_160"></span>[5](#fn_160.md) lord of the
nether ones!

8\. O, soften all \[towards me\], and give me might

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

\[and\] form, <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161.md) and let them give me
gold, and silver \[too\], and food of every kind continually.

9\. Preserve me evermore for the eternity from spells, deceits, and
witchery of every kind, from evil tongues, from every check and every
enmity of gods and men!

10\. Give unto me grace, victory, success, and satisfaction!

11\. For thou art I, and I am thou; thy Name is mine, and mine is thine;
for that I am thy likeness. <span id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_162.md)

12\. Whatever shall befall me in this year, or month, or day, or
hour,—it shall befall the Mighty God, whose symbol is upon the holy
vessel’s prow. <span id="fr_163"></span>[3](#fn_163.md)

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

##### IV. AN INVOCATION TO THOTH AS LOGOS

<span style="font-size: small">\[Revised text, R. 22. Leemans, *op.
cit.,* II. 103, 7; Dieterich, *op. cit.,* 189.\] </span>

1\. Thee I invoke alone, thou who alone in all the world imposest order
upon gods and men, <span id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) who dost
transform thyself in holy forms, <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165.md)
making to be from things that are not, and from the things that are
making the not to be.

2\. O holy Thoth, <span id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_166.md) the true sight
of whose face none of the gods endures!

3\. Make me to be in every creature’s name <span
id="fr_167"></span>[4](#fn_167.md)—wolf, dog, \[or\] lion, fire, tree,
\[or\] vulture, <span id="fr_168"></span>[5](#fn_168.md) wall, <span
id="fr_169"></span>[6](#fn_169.md) \[or\] water, <span
id="fr_170"></span>[7](#fn_170.md) or what thou will’st, for thou art able
\[so to do\].

##### V. AN INVOCATION TO HERMES AS THE SPIRITUAL LIGHT

<span style="font-size: small">\[Revised text R. 22, 23. Leemans,
*ibid.,* II. 87, 24; Dieterich, *ibid.,* 176, 1.\]</span>

1\. Thee I invoke who hast created all, who dost transcend the whole,
the self-begotten God, who seest all and hearest all, but who art seen
by none.

2\. For thou didst give the sun his glory and all might, the moon her
increase and her decrease, and \[unto both\] their ordained course.
Though thou didst not diminish aught the \[powers of\] darkness, the
still

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

more ancient \[than the sun and moon\], thou mad’st them equal \[with
it\]. <span id="fr_171"></span>[1](#fn_171.md)

3\. For when thou didst shine forth, Cosmos came into being, and light
appeared, and all things were dispensed through thee; wherefore they all
are under thee.

4\. O thou, whose actual form none of the gods can see, who dost
transform thyself into them all in visions \[that men see\], O thou
Eternity of the eternity. <span id="fr_172"></span>[2](#fn_172.md)

5\. Thee I invoke, O Lord, that thy true form may manifest to me, for
that I am in servitude below thy world, <span
id="fr_173"></span>[3](#fn_173.md) slave to thy angel and unto thy
fear. <span id="fr_174"></span>[4](#fn_174.md)

6\. Through thee the pole and earth are fixed.

7\. Thee I invoke, O Lord, e’en as the gods whom thou hast made to
shine, that they may have their power.

The above prayers afford us some striking examples of the popular
Hellenistic form of the Hermes religion, <span
id="fr_175"></span>[5](#fn_175.md)

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

in its theurgic phase. In it Hermes is regarded as the Mind <span
id="fr_176"></span>[1](#fn_176.md) or Logos. The Mind is invoked to enter
the mind and heart (I. 10). <span id="fr_177"></span>[2](#fn_177.md) With
the shining out of the Mind, the Spiritual or Intelligible Light shines
forth in the world and man (v. 3). The Mind is thus the guide of
souls. <span id="fr_178"></span>[3](#fn_178.md) He is also identified with
the Good Daimon (of whom Chnuphis or Horus are variants), with the Great
Ocean, the Heaven-Space or Celestial Nile, the Great Green, the Light,
the Æon.

In connection with the above invocations Reitzenstein gives the text of
a very interesting ritual of lower theurgy, or rite of the sacred flame,
which he characterises by the term “mystery of lychnomancy or
lamp-magic.” This is the lower side of such high vision as is referred
to in “The Shepherd of Men” treatise and in the rite described in the
following passage of the *Pistis Sophia,* 272, 373:

“Jesus said unto his disciples: Come unto me! And

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

they came unto him. He turned to the four quarters of the world, and
spake the Great Name over their heads, and blessed them, and breathed on
their eyes.

“Jesus said unto them: Look, see what ye may see!

“And lifting up their eyes they saw a great Light, exceeding vast, which
no dweller on earth could describe.

“He said to them again: Gaze into the Light, and see what ye may see!

“They said: We see fire and water, and wine and blood.”

##### VI. THE MYSTIC RITE OF THE FLAME

<span style="font-size: small">\[Revised text, R. 25-27. Wessely, *op.
cit.,* “Griechische zauberpapyrus von Paris und London” (Vienna, 1888),
68, 930 ff.\]</span>

(*a*) *Invocation to the Light* <span id="fr_179"></span>[1](#fn_179.md)

1\. I invoke thee, O God, the living one, <span
id="fr_180"></span>[2](#fn_180.md) who dost show forth thy splendour in the
fire, thou unseen Father of the Light! <span
id="fr_181"></span>[3](#fn_181.md) Pour forth thy strength; awake thy
daimon, and come down into this fire; inspire it with \[thy\] holy
spirit; show me thy might, and let the house of the almighty God, which
is within this light, be opened for me! Let there be light,—

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

\[thy\] breadth-depth-length-height-ray; <span
id="fr_182"></span>[1](#fn_182.md) and let the Lord, the \[God\] within,
shine forth!

(*b*) *A Stronger Form to be used if the Flame dies down*

2\. I adjure thee, O Light, holy ray, breadth-depth-length-height-ray,
by the holy names which I have uttered, <span
id="fr_183"></span>[2](#fn_183.md) and am now about to speak . . . abide
with me in this same hour, until I have besought thy God, and learnt
about the things that I desire!

(*c*) *The Theagogy or Invocation of the God proper*

3\. Thee I invoke, thou mightiest God and Master . . . thou who
enlightenest all and pour’st thy rays by means of thine own power on all
the world, O God of gods!

4\. O Word (*Logos*) that orderest night and day, who guid’st the
ship, <span id="fr_184"></span>[3](#fn_184.md) and hold’st the helm, thou
dragon-slayer, <span id="fr_185"></span>[4](#fn_185.md) Good Holy
Daimon . . . !

5\. To whom the East and West give praise as thou dost rise and set,
thou who art blest by all the gods, angels, and daimones!

6\. Come, show thyself to me, O God of gods . . . !

7\. Enter, make manifest thyself to me, O Lord; for I invoke as the
three apes invoke thee—who symbol-wise name forth thy holy Name.

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

8\. In thy ape-form <span id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md) enter, appear
to me, O Lord; for I name forth thy mightiest names!

9\. O thou who hast thy throne about the height of cosmos, <span
id="fr_187"></span>[2](#fn_187.md) and judgest all, encircled with the
sphere of Surety and Truth! <span id="fr_188"></span>[3](#fn_188.md)

10\. Enter, appear to me, O Lord, for that I was before the fire and
snow, and shall be after \[them\];

11\. I am the one who has been born from heaven. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[4](#fn_189.md)

12\. Enter, appear to me, O Lord of mighty names, whom all have in their
hearts, <span id="fr_190"></span>[5](#fn_190.md) who dost burst open
rocks, <span id="fr_191"></span>[6](#fn_191.md) and mak’st the names of
gods to move!

13\. Enter, appear to me, O Lord, who hast thy power and strength in
tire, who hast thy throne within the seven poles. <span
id="fr_192"></span>[7](#fn_192.md)

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

14\. And on thy head a golden crown, and in thy hand a staff . . . <span
id="fr_193"></span>[1](#fn_193.md) by which thou sendest forth the gods!

15\. Enter, O Lord, and give me answer with thy holy voice, that I may
clearly hear and truthfully about this thing!

(*d*) *A Stronger Form of Adjuration if* (*c*) *fails*

16\. He doth enjoin thee, He the great living God, who is for the
eternities of the eternities, the shaker and the thunderer, who doth
create each soul and every birth. Enter, appear to me, O Lord, joyous,
benignant, gentle, glorious, free from all wrath; for I adjure thee by
the Lord \[of all\]!

(*e*) *The Greeting when the Presence of the God is manifested*

17\. Hail Lord, O God of gods, thou benefactor . . . ! Hail to thy
glories <span id="fr_194"></span>[2](#fn_194.md) ever more, O Lord!

18\. I give thee thanks, O Lord. Depart, O Lord, to thine own heavens,
thine own realms, and thine own

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

course, preserving me in health, free from all harm, free from all fear
of any *ka,* <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195.md) free from all
stripes, and all dismay, hearkening to me for all the days of \[all\] my
life!

(*g*) *The Farewell to the Flame*

19\. Depart, O holy ray; depart, O fair and holy light of highest God!

In connection with the above, we may also take the following
ritual-prayer used in the consecration of an amulet ring.

##### VII. A PRAYER OF CONSECRATION

<span style="font-size: small">\[Revised text, R. 28, 29. Wessely,

\[God\] who doth come into sight each day.

10\. O thou who art above the world, and art beneath the world, O mighty
ruler of the sea, give ear unto my voice this day, this night, these
holy hours \[of thine\], and through this amulet let that be done for
which I consecrate it!

extra-canonical *logos*: “I stood on a lofty mountain and saw a gigantic
man, and another, a dwarf; and I heard as it were a voice of thunder,
and drew nigh for to hear; and He spake unto me and said: I am thou, and
thou art I; and wheresoever thou mayest be I am there. In all am I
scattered \[that is, the Logos as seed or “members”\], and whencesoever
thou wiliest, thou gatherest Me; and gathering Me, thou gatherest
Thyself.” (From the *Gospel of Eve,* quoted by Epiphanius, *Hæres*.,
xxvi. 3.) *Cf.* II. 7.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[85:5](th107.htm#fr_138.md) In the Egyptian
sense—that is, thy true “person” or “presence.” See R. 17, n. 6, for
many references to this fundamental concept of Egyptian religion.

<span id="fn_139"></span>[85:6](th107.htm#fr_139.md) φυλακτήριον—lit., as a
phylactery or amulet. See R. 18, n. 8, for Egyptian origin of Jewish
phylacteries.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[86:1](th107.htm#fr_140.md) δράξ—here the symbol
of any hostile elemental force. Compare *K. K.,*—Stob., 402, 22 (W.).

<span id="fn_141"></span>[86:2](th107.htm#fr_141.md) καθ’ Ἅιδου.

<span id="fn_142"></span>[86:3](th107.htm#fr_142.md) See 9 above.

<span id="fn_143"></span>[86:4](th107.htm#fr_143.md) ἀβάσκαντος,
ἀβάσκαντος.

<span id="fn_144"></span>[86:5](th107.htm#fr_144.md) σωτηρίαν, or
salvation.

<span id="fn_145"></span>[86:6](th107.htm#fr_145.md) See II. 2 below.

<span id="fn_146"></span>[86:7](th107.htm#fr_146.md) Compare with this
prayer for the descent of the Mind into the heart, the ascent of the man
into the Mind of *C. H.,* xiii. (xiii.) 3.

<span id="fn_147"></span>[86:8](th107.htm#fr_147.md) This is an echo of
spiritual rebirth or regeneration.

<span id="fn_148"></span>[86:9](th107.htm#fr_148.md) In its highest sense
the heavenly food, or wisdom, the “supersubstantial bread,” or “bread of
life.”

<span id="fn_149"></span>[87:1](th107.htm#fr_149.md) ἐπαφροδισίαν προσώπου.
See I. 13 above.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[87:2](th107.htm#fr_150.md) The symbols of which
are: the ibis in the east, ape in the west, the serpent in the north,
the wolf (or jackal) in the south. So says the overworking of the text;
but perhaps wolf should rather be dog.

<span id="fn_151"></span>[87:3](th107.htm#fr_151.md) The terebinth, or
turpentine palm. Compare this with the story of Terebinthus, from whose
*four* Books Manes is said, in the *Acta Archelai,* to have derived his
system.

<span id="fn_152"></span>[87:4](th107.htm#fr_152.md) The ebony; perhaps
symbolic of the “dark” wisdom, the initiation “in the black” of the *K.
K.* Fragments.

<span id="fn_153"></span>[87:5](th107.htm#fr_153.md) τὰ βαρβαρικὰ
ὀνόματα—lit., barbarous, that is, non-Greek.

<span id="fn_154"></span>[87:6](th107.htm#fr_154.md) *Cf.* I. 11.

<span id="fn_155"></span>[87:7](th107.htm#fr_155.md) Lit., with
Agathodaimon; compare σὺν θεῷ—“with God’s blessing.”

<span id="fn_156"></span>[88:1](th107.htm#fr_156.md) συνδωκόντων—a ἅπαξ
λεγόμενον—δώκω (δίδωμι) may be compared with στήκω (ἵστημι). The image
may be taken from the well-known symbolical representation of the sun
sending forth rays, each furnished with a hand for giving and blessing,
especially in the frescoes of the Atem-cult period. *Cf. K. K.,* 11 and
31.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[88:2](th107.htm#fr_157.md) In the mystery-myth.

<span id="fn_158"></span>[88:3](th107.htm#fr_158.md) Orig., medicines or
philtres.

<span id="fn_159"></span>[88:4](th107.htm#fr_159.md) εὐδιάλεκτος γενοῦ—a
unique and inelegant expression in Greek, and of uncertain translation
into English.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[88:5](th107.htm#fr_160.md) This appears here to
refer to Anubis, the “dog” of Hades, or the “death-genius,” the
attendant on Thoth. “Black” is lit. “Ethiopian.” But compare in *Pistis
Sophia,* 367, “Æthiopic Ariouth,” a ruler among the infernal daimonials,
who is “entirely black.” The Ethiopians were famous for their sorcery
and black magic. They were the traditional opponents of the “white
magicians” of Egypt. Compare “Hor, son of the Negress” in the “Second
Story of Khamuas,” in Griffith’s (F. Ll.) *Stories of the High Priests
of Memphis* (Oxford, 1900), pp. 51 ff.

<span id="fn_161"></span>[89:1](th107.htm#fr_161.md) This is not
necessarily a prayer for physical form and the rest, but a prayer that
the subtle *ka* of the man, the plastic soul-substance, may take a form
of power and beauty, in the unseen world.

<span id="fn_162"></span>[89:2](th107.htm#fr_162.md) εἴδωλον, or image or
double. The theurgist is endeavouring to identify his *ka* with that of
the god. It was with his *ka* also, presumably, that the consecrated
statue of the god was “animated.” Compare the exposition of this theory
as given in *P. S. A.,* and the “image” or “likeness of God” in
Lactantius, ii. 10. According to the Egyptians, man possessed: (1) a
physical body (*khat*); (2) a soul (*ba*); (3) a heart (*ȧb*); (4) a
double (*ka*); (5) an intelligence (*khu*); (6) a power (*sekhem*); (7)
a shadow (*khaibit*) (8) a spiritual body (*sȧḥ* \[*sic*\]); (9) a name
(*ren*). See Budge, *Gods of the Egyptians,* ii. 299, 300. These are, of
course, not arranged in any natural order or in a scientific
distribution. The precise meaning of most of these terms is not known.
Budge (*op. cit.,* i. 163, 164), however, writes: “Related intimately to
the body, but with undefined functions, as far as we can discover, was
the *sekhem,* a word which has been translated ‘power,’ and ‘form,’ and
even ‘vital force’; finally the glorified body, to which had been united
the soul, and spirit and power, and name of the deceased, had its abode
in heaven. This new body of the deceased in heaven was called *sāḥu*.”

<span id="fn_163"></span>[89:3](th107.htm#fr_163.md) Thoth and Maāt are
represented as sitting on either side of Rā in his boat.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[90:1](th107.htm#fr_164.md) That is, Hermes as the
cosmic Logos.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[90:2](th107.htm#fr_165.md) Thoth changes his form
in every heaven-space or sphere. Compare *C. H.,* i. 13; and also the
same idea in the descent of the Christos in a number of Gnostic systems,
where the Saviour and King conceals himself in the forms of his servants
in every phase of his descent. *Cf.* also *C. H.,* xi. (xii.) 16.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[90:3](th107.htm#fr_166.md) θαύθ.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[90:4](th107.htm#fr_167.md) That is, essence, or
may be type.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[90:5](th107.htm#fr_168.md) Presumably a symbol
for air.

<span id="fn_169"></span>[90:6](th107.htm#fr_169.md) Presumably a symbol
for earth.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[90:7](th107.htm#fr_170.md) Compare *C. H.,* xi.
(xii.) 20; and *P. S. A.,* vi.

<span id="fn_171"></span>[91:1](th107.htm#fr_171.md) With the Egyptians,
Darkness was the mystery of all mysteries. As Damascius (*On First
Principles*) says: “Of the first principle the Egyptians said nothing;
but characterised it as a darkness beyond all intellectual conception, a
thrice unknown Darkness” (σκότος ἄγνωστον τρὶς τοῦτο ἐπιφημίζοντες). See
my *Orpheus* (London, 1896), p. 93, and for “Night,” pp. 154 and 170 ff.
Perhaps this may again give some clue to the initiation “in the black”
of the *K. K.* excerpt. The “dark wisdom” was the hidden of the hidden.

<span id="fn_172"></span>[91:2](th107.htm#fr_172.md) αἰὼν αἰῶνος. In
another hymn, Hermes, as Logos, is called “Cosmos of cosmos” (R. 23, n.
1)—that is, the spiritual world or order.

<span id="fn_173"></span>[91:3](th107.htm#fr_173.md) That is the spiritual
cosmos, or cosmos of Mind.

<span id="fn_174"></span>[91:4](th107.htm#fr_174.md) Compare Isaiah xlv. 7:
“I form the light and create darkness: I make peace and create evil: I
the Lord do all these things.” *Cf. C. H.,* i. 23, “the avenging
daimon”; and *ibid.,* 15, “Within the Harmony he hath become a slave.”

<span id="fn_175"></span>[91:5](th107.htm#fr_175.md) Called in the
Trismegistic literature the “Religion of the Mind” (*Mentis religio*).
See *P. S. A.,* xxv.

<span id="fn_176"></span>[92:1](th107.htm#fr_176.md) Compare the cosmogony
in Dieterich, *Abraxas,* 17, 43: “Through the Bitterness of God, there
appeared Mind . . . that restrains the heart, and was called Hermes.”
With this peculiar phrase “Bitterness of God” compare the “Bitter Chaos”
of the hymn at the end of the J. source of the Naassene Document in “The
Myth of Man” chapter; also the “Bitter Water” or Chaos of the Sethian
System (Hipp., *Philos.,* v. 19); so also Julian, in *Oration V.,* who
writes: “The oracles of the gods declare that through purification not
only our soul but also our bodies are judged worthy of being greatly
helped and preserved, for it is said in them that ‘the mortal vesture of
bitter matter is preserved.’” Is it thus possible that the “Bitterness”
of Jacob Böhme may be a reminiscence of the ancient Gnosis?

<span id="fn_177"></span>[92:2](th107.htm#fr_177.md) For pure Egyptian
parallels see R. 24, n. 1.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[92:3](th107.htm#fr_178.md) See the theogony in
Dieterich, *op. cit.,* 18, 75: “And the soul came into being. And God
said: ‘Thou shalt move all things . . . Hermes guiding thee.’” Compare
*C. H.,* x. (xi.) 21: “But on the pious soul the Mind doth mount, and
guide it to the Gnosis’ light;” also xii. (xiii.) 12, ix. (x.) 10, iv.
(v.) 11, vii. (viii.) 2.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[93:1](th107.htm#fr_179.md) These rubrics I have
added, following the example of Reitzenstein, but not his wording.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[93:2](th107.htm#fr_180.md) Compare the expression
“Jesus the living \[one\]” found frequently in the Introduction to the
“First Book of Ieou” (Carl Schmidt, *Gnostische Schriften in koptischer
Sprache aus dem Codex Brucianus* (Leipzig, 1892), 142-145—reprinted with
his recent translation of the *Pistis Sophia* in Band I. of his
*Koptisch gnostische Schriften* (Leipzig, 1905); and also the Preface to
the newest found *logoi*: “These are the . . . words which Jesus, the
living \[one\], spake” (Grenfell and Hunt, *New Sayings of Jesus,*
London, 1904).

<span id="fn_181"></span>[93:3](th107.htm#fr_181.md) Compare in the same
writings the oft-repeated “Father of all fatherhood, Boundless Light.”

<span id="fn_182"></span>[94:1](th107.htm#fr_182.md) See Dieterich, *Jahrb.
f. Phil.,* Suppl., xvi. 802, 171, and 706. Compare also Ephes. iii. 18,
and the Valentinian interpretation of the terms in this text as given by
Hippolytus, *Philos.,* vi. 34 (Dunker and Schneidewin, p. 248); also the
interpretation of the Light Hymn in *Pistis Sophia,* 146, where the
“height” is identified with the “home” of the Light.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[94:2](th107.htm#fr_183.md) The magic names of
power are omitted, as in the other prayers.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[94:3](th107.htm#fr_184.md) Horus is often
represented as pilot of the sun-ship in its voyage across the ocean of
space, the “Great Green.”

<span id="fn_185"></span>[94:4](th107.htm#fr_185.md) The dragon here
undoubtedly meaning darkness. *Cf. C. H.,* i. 4.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[95:1](th107.htm#fr_186.md) ὡς κυνοκέφαλος. Can it
be possible that behind this strange symbolism there may once have been
some such idea as this—that as the ape is to man, so was this great
elemental to the God?

<span id="fn_187"></span>[95:2](th107.htm#fr_187.md) Lit., art seated on
the head of cosmos.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[95:3](th107.htm#fr_188.md) That is the Eternity
or Æon, called elsewhere the Pleroma or “fullness of grace,” and
identified with Agathodaimon (see prayer, R. 30). See also Wessely, *op.
cit.,* 185 (R. 362); and compare John i. 14, “full of grace and truth”;
and 16, “Of his fullness have we received, and grace for grace.”

<span id="fn_189"></span>[95:4](th107.htm#fr_189.md) The regenerate, or
spirit-born—that is of “virgin-birth” or the “birth of Horus.” But
compare the declaration of the soul on its entrance into the unseen
world after death, as given on an inscription found in the tomb of an
Orphic or Pythagorean initiate, at Petilia, in what was once Magna
Græcia: “Of Earth and starry Heaven child am I; my race is of the
Heavens!” (See *Inscr. Gr. Siciliæ et Italiæ,* 638; and my “Notes on the
Eleusinian Mysteries,” *Theosophical Review,* xxii. 317.)

<span id="fn_190"></span>[95:5](th107.htm#fr_190.md) These are the *logoi*
hidden in the hearts of all.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[95:6](th107.htm#fr_191.md) This may be merely a
figurative expression in praise of the might that can not only dissolve
the most stable things on earth, but also set in motion the centre of
stability of spiritual essences; or it may refer to the idea of the “God
born from the rock,” which is most familiar to us from the Mithriac
mystery-tradition, where the rock is said to symbolise in physics the
“firmament,” which was thought of as solid or rigid by the ancients.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[95:7](th107.htm#fr_192.md) That is, the seven
cosmic spheres.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[96:1](th107.htm#fr_193.md) μεμνοινην—an
untranslatable reading. Is it Egyptian?—or is it intended for
μεμνόνειαν? If the latter, it would presumably be connected with the
Egyptian myth and cult of Memnon (see Roscher’s *Lexikon,* coll. 2661
ff.). The Memnon cult was somehow connected with Hermes, for in the
ruins of the temple were still (at the beginning of the third century)
to be seen “statues of Hermes,” according to Philostratus (*Vit.
Apoll.,* vi. 4), who also (*Imag.,* i. 7) tells us that the Memnon
statue was as a lyre which was struck by the rod (πλῆκτρον), that is the
ray (ἡ ἀκτίς), of the sun. If so, “the rod \[of power\], by which thou
sendest forth the gods,” that is thy rays, each god being a ray of the
spiritual sun, might have the epithet Memnonian applied to it. But in
our present lack of information, this interpretation seems very
strained.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[96:2](th107.htm#fr_194.md) δόξαι—here meaning
powers.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[97:1](th107.htm#fr_195.md) ἀνειδωλόπληκτον.

<span id="fn_196"></span>[97:2](th107.htm#fr_196.md) κωμαστήριον. *Cf.* I.
5 above.

<span id="fn_197"></span>[98:1](th107.htm#fr_197.md) The serpent was a
symbol of the Logos, and this is the idea underlying the so-called
Ophite systems of the Gnosis.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[98:2](th107.htm#fr_198.md) This refers to the
first nome of Upper Egypt, whose metropolis, Elephantine, was once the
chief seat of the popular Agathodaimon cult (R. 29, n. 4). The “world”
was thus the Egyptian civilised world, beyond which was the darkness of
Ethiopia.
