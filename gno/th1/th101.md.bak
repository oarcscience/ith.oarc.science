### Preface

<span class="smallcaps">These</span> volumes, complete in themselves as
a series of studies in a definite body of tradition, are intended to
serve ultimately as a small contribution to the preparation of the way
leading towards a solution of the vast problems involved in the
scientific study of the Origins of the Christian Faith. They might thus
perhaps be described as the preparation of materials to serve for the
historic, mythic, and mystic consideration of the Origins of
Christianity,—where the term “mythic” is used in its true sense of
inner, typical, sacred and “logic,” as opposed to the external
processioning of physical events known as “historic,” and where the term
“mystic” is used as that which pertains to initiation and the mysteries.

The serious consideration of the matter contained in these pages will, I
hope, enable the attentive reader to outline in his mind, however
vaguely, some small portion of the environment of infant Christianity,
and allow him to move a few steps round the cradle of Christendom.

Though the material that we have collected, has, as to its externals,
been tested, as far as our hands are capable of the work, by the methods
of scholarship and criticism, it has nevertheless at the same time been
allowed ungrudgingly to show itself the outward

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

expression of a truly vital endeavour of immense interest and value to
all who are disposed to make friends with it. For along this ray of the
Trismegistic tradition we may allow ourselves to be drawn backwards in
time towards the holy of holies of the Wisdom of Ancient Egypt. The
sympathetic study of this material may well prove an initiatory process
towards an understanding of that Archaic Gnosis.

And, therefore, though these volumes are intended to show those
competent to judge that all has been set forth in decency according to
approved methods of modern research, they are also designed for those
who are not qualified to give an opinion on such matters, but who are
able to feel and think with the writers of these beautiful tractates.
