##### ON THE DRINKING OF WINE

VI\. 1. And as for wine, the servants of the God in Sun-city <span
id="fr_819"></span>[2](#fn_820.md) do not at all bring it into the sacred
place, as ’tis not right \[for them\] to drink by day while He, their
Lord and King, looks on.

2\. The rest \[of them <span id="fr_820"></span>[3](#fn_821.md)\] use it
indeed, but sparingly.

They have, however, many times of abstinence at which they drink no
wine, but spend them in the search for wisdom, learning and teaching the
\[truth\] about the Gods.

3\. The kings used to drink it, though in certain measure according to
the sacred writings, as Hecatæus has narrated, <span
id="fr_821"></span>[4](#fn_822.md) for they were priests \[as well\].

4\. They began to drink it, however, only from the time of
Psammetichus; <span id="fr_822"></span>[5](#fn_823.md) but before that they
used not to drink wine.

Nor did they make libation of it as a thing dear to the Gods, but as the
blood of those who fought against the Gods, <span
id="fr_823"></span>[6](#fn_824.md)—from whom, when they fell and mingled
with

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

the earth, they think the vines came, and that because of this
wine-drenching makes men to be out of their minds and struck
aside, <span id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_825.md) in that, forsooth, they are
full-filled with the forefathers of its <span
id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_826.md) blood. <span
id="fr_826"></span>[3](#fn_827.md)

5\. These things, at any rate Eudoxus says, in Book II. of his
*Circuit,* <span id="fr_827"></span>[4](#fn_828.md) are thus stated by the
priests.
