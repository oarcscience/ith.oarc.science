##### CONCERNING OSIRIS AND DIONYSUS

XXXV\. 1. That, however, he is the same as Dionysus—who should know
better than thou thyself, O Klea, who art Archi-charila <span
id="fr_1065"></span>[5](#fn_1066.md) of the Thyiades at Delphi,

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

and wast dedicated to the Osiriaca before thou wert born? <span
id="fr_1066"></span>[1](#fn_1067.md)

But if for the sake of others we must quote testimonies, let us leave
the things that must not be spoken of in their proper place.

2\. The rites, however, which the priests perform in burning the Apis,
when they transport its body on a raft, in no way fall short of a
Bacchic Orgy. For they put on fawn-skins and carry thyrsuses, <span
id="fr_1067"></span>[2](#fn_1068.md) and shout and dance just like those
inspired at celebrations of the Mysteries of Dionysus.

3\. Wherefore many of the Greeks make Dionysus also bull-formed; while
the women of the Eleians invoke him praying “the god with the bull’s
foot to come” to them.

4\. The Argives, moreover, give Dionysus the epithet of “bull-born,” and
they call him up out of the water with the sound of trumpets, casting a
lamb into the abyss for the Gate-keeper. <span
id="fr_1068"></span>[3](#fn_1069.md) The trumpets they hide in thyrsi, as
Socrates has said in his “\[Books\] on Rites.” <span
id="fr_1069"></span>[4](#fn_1070.md)

5\. The Titanic \[Passions\] also and the \[Dionysian\] Night-rites
agree with what we are told about the tearings-in-pieces and revivings
and *palingeneses* of Osiris; and similarly the \[stories\] of the
burials.

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

6\. For both Egyptians point to tombs of Osiris everywhere, as has been
said, <span id="fr_1070"></span>[1](#fn_1071.md) and \[also\] Delphians
believe the relics of Dionysus are deposited with them by the side of
the Oracle, and the Holy Ones offer an offering, of which we must not
speak, in the fane of Apollo, when the Thyiades awake “Him of the
winnowing fan.”

7\. And that Greeks consider Dionysus to be lord and prince not only of
wine, but of every moist nature, Pindar witnesses sufficiently when he
sings:

> <span style="font-size: small">May gladsome Dionysus make the
> pasturage of trees to grow—  
> Pure light of autumn. <span id="fr_1071"></span>[2](#fn_1072.md) </span>

8\. For which cause also they who give worship to Osiris are forbidden
to destroy a cultivated tree or to stop up a water-source.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1066"></span>[310:5](th132.htm#fr_1065.md) The text reads
ἀρχικλὰ—an apparently impossible collection of letters. As no one has so
far purged the reading, I would suggest χάριλαν or ἀρχι-χάριλαν.
Stending (in Roscher, *s.v.*) reminds us of the myth of the orphan maid
Charila, who during a famine begged alms at the gate of the palace of
the King of ancient Delphi; the King not only refused her, but drove her
away slapping her face with his shoe. Whereupon the little maid for
shame hanged herself. After the famine was over the Oracle decreed an
atonement for her death. And so every nine years an effigy made to
represent Charila was done to death, and then carried off by the leader
of the Thyiades (or priestesses of Bacchus), and buried, with a rope
round its neck, in a gorge. *Cf.* Harrison (Jane E.), *Prolegomena to
the Study of Greek Religion* (Cambridge, 1903), p. 106. As Klea was
leader of the Thyiades, this office fell to her; it may, therefore, even
be that her name is some play on Charila.

<span id="fn_1067"></span>[311:1](th132.htm#fr_1066.md) Lit., “from father
and mother.”

<span id="fn_1068"></span>[311:2](th132.htm#fr_1067.md) Symbolic wands,
generally cane-like or knotted like a bamboo, and sometimes wreathed in
ivy and vine leaves, with a pine-cone at top.

<span id="fn_1069"></span>[311:3](th132.htm#fr_1068.md) τῷ πυλαόχῳ.

<span id="fn_1070"></span>[311:4](th132.htm#fr_1069.md) Müller, iv. 498.
This was probably Socrates of Cos, who is known to have been the author
of a work entitled Ἐπικλήσεις θεῶν (*e.g.* Dion. Laërt., ii. 4), meaning
either “Prayers to the Gods,” or “Surnames of the Gods.”

<span id="fn_1071"></span>[312:1](th132.htm#fr_1070.md) *Cf.* xx. 5.

<span id="fn_1072"></span>[312:2](th132.htm#fr_1071.md) Bergk, i. 433.
