##### THE THEORY OF THE DAIMONES

XXV. <span id="fr_1011"></span>[1](#fn_1012) 1. They, therefore, \[do\]
better who believe that the things related about Typhon and Osiris and
Isis are passions neither of gods nor of men, but of mighty daimones,
who—as Plato and Pythagoras and Xenocrates and Chrysippus say, following
the theologers of bygone days—have been born more manful than men, far
surpassing us in the strength of their nature, yet not having the divine
unmixed and pure, but proportioned with the nature of soul and sense of
body, susceptible of pleasure and pain and all the passions, which as
innate to such metamorphoses trouble some \[of them\] more and others
less.

2\. For the Gigantic and Titanic \[Passions\] sung of among the Greeks,
and certain lawless deeds of Kronos and antagonisms of Pythōn against
Apollo, and fleeings of Dionysus, and wanderings of Demeter, in no way
fall behind the Osiric and Typhonic \[Passions\], and others which all
may hear unrestrainedly spoken of in myth.

And all these things which, under the veil of mystic

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

sacred rites and perfectionings, are carefully kept from being spoken of
to, or being allowed to be seen by, the multitude, have a similar reason
(*logos*). <span id="fr_1012"></span>[1](#fn_1013)

XXVI\. 1. Moreover, we hear Homer also on every occasion calling the
good variously “godlike” and “equal to gods,” and as “having
directions <span id="fr_1013"></span>[2](#fn_1014) from gods”; whereas
he employs epithets connected with the daimones to both worthy and
unworthy in common:

> <span style="font-size: small">Draw nigh them daimonian! Why so
> fearest the Argives? <span id="fr_1014"></span>[3](#fn_1015) </span>

And again:

> <span style="font-size: small">But when indeed for the fourth time he
> charged, a daimon’s equal. <span id="fr_1015"></span>[4](#fn_1016)
> </span>

And:

> <span style="font-size: small">O thou daimonian! what so great ills do
> Priam now  
> And Priam’s sons to thee, that thou dost hotly rage  
> Troy’s well-built town to rase? <span
> id="fr_1016"></span>[5](#fn_1017) </span>

—as though the daimones possessed a mixed and an unbalanced nature and
propensity.

2\. For which reason Plato <span id="fr_1017"></span>[6](#fn_1018)
refers unto the God upon Olympus’ height things “right” and “odd,” <span
id="fr_1018"></span>[7](#fn_1019) and to the daimones those that respond
to these. <span id="fr_1019"></span>[8](#fn_1020)

3\. Moreover, Xenocrates <span id="fr_1020"></span>[9](#fn_1021) thinks
that the nefast days, and all the holy days on which are strikings or
beatings or fastings or blasphemies or foul language, have nothing to do
with honours paid to gods or to beneficent daimones; but that there are
natures in

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

the circumambient, <span id="fr_1021"></span>[1](#fn_1022) mighty and
powerful indeed, but difficult to turn and sullen, who take pleasure in
such things, and when they get them turn to nothing worse.

4\. The beneficent and good ones, again, Hesiod also calls “holy
daimones” and “guardians of men”—“wealth-givers and possessors of this
sovereign prerogative.” <span id="fr_1022"></span>[2](#fn_1023)

5\. Plato <span id="fr_1023"></span>[3](#fn_1024) again gives to this
race the name of hermeneutic and of diaconic <span
id="fr_1024"></span>[4](#fn_1025) ’twixt Gods and men, speeding up
thitherwards men’s vows and prayers, and bringing thence prophetic
answers hitherwards and gifts of \[all\] good things.

6\. Whereas Empedocles <span id="fr_1025"></span>[5](#fn_1026) says that
the daimones have to amend whatever faults they make, or discords they
may strike:

“For æther’s rush doth chase them seawards; sea spews them on land’s
flat; and earth into the beams of tireless sun; and he casts \[them
again\] into the swirls of æther. One takes them from another, and all
abhor \[them\]” <span id="fr_1026"></span>[6](#fn_1027)—until after
being thus chastened and purified they regain their natural place and
rank.

XXVII\. 1. Born from the self-same womb as these and things like them,
they say, are the legends about Typhon: how that he wrought dire deeds
through envy and ill-will, and after throwing all things into confusion
and filling the whole earth and sea as well with ills, he afterwards did
make amends.

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

2\. But the sister-wife <span id="fr_1027"></span>[1](#fn_1028) of
Osiris who upheld his honour, after she had quenched and laid to rest
Typhon’s frenzy and fury, did not allow forgetfulness and silence to
overtake the struggles and trials he had endured, and her own wanderings
and many \[deeds\] of wisdom, and many \[feats\] of manliness; but
intermingling with the most chaste perfectionings images and
under-meanings and copies of the passion she then endured, she hallowed
at one and the same time a lesson of religion and a consolation to men
and women placed in like circumstances.

3\. And she and Osiris, being changed through virtue from good daimones
into gods <span id="fr_1028"></span>[2](#fn_1029)—as \[were\]
subsequently Heracles and Dionysus—possess the dignities of gods and
daimones at one and the same time, fitly combined everywhere indeed but
with the greatest power among those above earth and under earth.

Karsten, 16 ff.; Fairbanks, p. 204. The quotation appears to me
inapposite, for Empedocles seems to be speaking of “any who defile their
bodies sinfully” and not of daimones; but perhaps the “received”
recombination of the fragments is at fault.

<span id="fn_1028"></span>[301:1](th128.htm#fr_1027) See the note on
“sister-wife” in comment on Mariamnē (Hipp., *Philos*.—Introd.) in
chapter on “Myth of Man.”—Prolegg., p. 147, n. 7.

<span id="fn_1029"></span>[301:2](th128.htm#fr_1028) That is to say,
according to this theory the myth represented the degree of initiation
by which a man passed from the stage of daimon into the state of god, or
from super-man to christ.
