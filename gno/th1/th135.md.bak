##### THE THEORY OF THE DUALISTS

XLV\. 1. From \[all of\] which it seems not unreasonable to conclude
that no simple \[explanation\] by itself gives the right meaning, but
that they all collectively do so.

2\. For neither drought nor wind nor sea nor darkness is the essential
of Typhon, but the whole hurtful and destructive \[element\] which is in
nature.

3\. For we must neither place the principles of the whole in soulless
bodies, as \[do\] Democritus and Epicurus, nor yet assume one Reason
(*Logos*) \[only\] and one Providence that prevails over and masters all
things as demiurge \[or artificer\] of quality-less matter, as \[do\]
the Stoics.

4\. For it is impossible either that anything at all of no worth should
exist where God is cause of all, or of worth where \[He is cause\] of
nothing.

5\. For “reciprocal” \[is\] cosmos’ “harmony, as that of lyre or bow,”
according to Heracleitus, <span id="fr_1113"></span>[1](#fn_1114.md) and
according to Euripides:

> <span style="font-size: small">There could not be apart good things
> and bad,  
> But there’s a blend of both so as to make things fair. <span
> id="fr_1114"></span>[2](#fn_1115.md) </span>

6\. Wherefore this exceedingly ancient doctrine also comes down from the
theologers and law-givers to poets and philosophers—\[a doctrine\] that
has its origin set down to no man’s name, and yet possessed of credit,
strong and not so easy to efface, surviving in many places not in words
or voices <span id="fr_1115"></span>[3](#fn_1116.md) only, but also in
\[secret\]

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

perfectionings and \[public\] offerings, both non-Greek and Greek
\[ones\]—that neither does the universe mindless and reason-less and
guidance-less float in “That which acts of its own will,” nor is there
one Reason \[only\] that rules and guides, as though with rudder as it
were and bits obedient to the reins; but that \[the universe\] is many
things and these a blend of evil things and good.

7\. Or, rather, seeing that Nature produces nothing, generally speaking,
unmixed down here, it is not that from two jars a single mixer, like a
tavern-keeper, pouring things out like drinks, mixes them up for us, but
that from two opposite principles and two antagonistic powers—the one
leading \[things\] to the right and on the straight \[road\], the other
upsetting and undoing \[them\]—both life has been made mixed, and cosmos
(if not the whole, at anyrate this \[cosmos\] which surrounds the earth
and comes after the Moon) irregular and variable, and susceptible of
changes of every kind.

8\. For if nothing has been naturally brought into existence without a
cause, and Good cannot furnish cause of Bad, the nature of Bad as well
as Good must have a genesis and principle peculiar to itself.

XLVI. <span id="fr_1116"></span>[1](#fn_1117.md) 1. And this is the opinion
of most of the most wise.

2\. For some think there are two craft-rival Gods, as it were,—one the
artificer of good \[things\], the other of \[things\] worthless. Others
call the better “God” and the other “Daimon,” as Zoroaster the Mage,
who, they tell us, lived five thousand years before the Trojan War.

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

3\. Zoroaster, then, called the one Ōromazēs, and the other Areimanios,
and further announced that the one resembled light especially of things
sensible, and the other, contrariwise, darkness and ignorance, while
that between the two was Mithrēs; wherefore the Persians call Mithrēs
the Mediator.

4\. He taught them, moreover, to make offerings of gladsome prayers to
the one, and to the other of melancholy de-precations.

5\. For bruising a certain plant called “moly” <span
id="fr_1117"></span>[1](#fn_1118.md) in a mortar, they invoke Hades and
Darkness; then mixing it with the blood of a wolf whose throat has been
cut, they carry it away and cast it into a sunless spot.

6\. For they think that both of plants some are of the Good God and
others of the Evil Daimon; and of animals, dogs, for instance, and
birds <span id="fr_1118"></span>[2](#fn_1119.md) and hedgehogs of the Good,
and water-rats of the Bad; wherefore they consider fortunate the man who
kills the largest number \[of the last\].

XLVII\. 1. Not that they also do not tell many mythic stories about the
Gods; such as are, for example, the following:

Ōromazēs, born from the purest light, and Areimanios, of the nether
darkness, are at war with one another.

2\. And the former made six Gods: the first of good mind, the second of
truth, the third of good order, and of the rest, one of wisdom, one of
wealth, and the producer of things sweet following things fair; while
the latter \[made\] craft-rivals as it were to those equal in number.

3\. Then Ōromazēs having tripled himself, removed himself from the sun
so far as the sun is distant from the earth, and adorned the heaven with
stars; and he

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

established one star above all as warder and look-out, \[namely\]
Sirius.

4\. And having made four-and-twenty other gods, he put them into an egg.

Whereupon those that were made from Areimanios, just the same in number,
piercing through the egg . . . <span
id="fr_1119"></span>[1](#fn_1120.md)—whence the bad have been mingled with
the good.

5\. But a time appointed by Fate will come when Areimanios’s letting
loose of pestilence and famine must be utterly brought to an end, and
made to vanish by these \[good gods\], and the earth becoming plane and
level, there must ensue one mode of life and one way of government for
men, all being happy and one-tongued. <span
id="fr_1120"></span>[2](#fn_1121.md)

6\. Theopompus, however, says that, according to the Magi, for three
thousand years alternately one of the Gods conquers and the other is
conquered, and for yet another three thousand years they fight and war,
and each undoes the work of the other.

7\. But that in the end Hades fails, and men shall be happy, neither
requiring food nor casting shadow; <span
id="fr_1121"></span>[3](#fn_1122.md) while the God who has contrived these
things is still and at rest for a time—not otherwise long for a God, but
proportionate to a man’s sleeping.

8\. The style of myth among the Magi, then, is somewhat after this
manner.

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

XLVIII\. 1. Moreover, Chaldæans declare that of the planets—which they
call birth-presiding gods—two are good workers, two ill-doers, while
three are intermediates and common.

2\. As for the dogmas of the Greeks, they are, I take it, plain to all,
ascribing as they do the good allotment to Olympian Zeus, and that which
has to be averted to Hades.

3\. Moreover, they have a myth that Harmony is the child of Aphrodite
and Ares, the latter of whom is harsh and strife-loving, while the
former is gentle and a lover of love-striving.

4\. For Heracleitus plainly calls “War”—“father and king and lord of
all,” <span id="fr_1122"></span>[1](#fn_1123.md) and says that Homer, when
he prays “that strife and hatred cease from gods as well,” <span
id="fr_1123"></span>[2](#fn_1124.md) forgets that he is imprecating the
means of birth of all, in that they have their genesis from conflict and
antipathy; that:

> <span style="font-size: small">“Sun will not o’erstep his proper
> bounds, for if he do, Furies, Eight’s bodyguard, will find him
> out.” <span id="fr_1124"></span>[3](#fn_1125.md) </span>

5\. The Pythagorics \[also\], in a list of names, set down the
predicates of Good as—One, Finite, Abiding, Straight, Odd, Square,
Equal, Right, Light; and of Bad as—Two, Infinite, Moving, Curved, Even,
Oblong, Unequal, Left, Dark,—on the ground that these are the underlying
principles of genesis.

6\. Aristotle \[also predicates\] the former as Form and the latter as
Privation.

7\. While Plato, though in many passages disguising himself and hiding
his face, calls the former of the opposite principles Same and the
latter Other.

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

8\. But in his *Laws,* being now older, no longer in riddles and in
symbols, but with authentic names, he says <span
id="fr_1125"></span>[1](#fn_1126.md) cosmos is moved not by one soul, but
probably by several, in any case not less than two,—whereof the one is
good-doing, the other the opposite to this and maker of things opposite.

9\. He leaves out, however, a certain third intermediate nature, neither
soul-less nor reason-less nor motion-less of itself, as some
think, <span id="fr_1126"></span>[2](#fn_1127.md) but depending on both of
them, and for ever longing for and desiring and following after the
better, as the following \[passages\] of the argument (*logos*), <span
id="fr_1127"></span>[3](#fn_1128.md) combining as it does for the most part
the theology of the Egyptians with their philosophy, show.

XLIX\. 1. For though the genesis and composition of this cosmos has been
blended from opposing, though not equal-strengthed, powers, the lordship
is nevertheless that of the Better \[one\].

2\. Still it is impossible the Worse should be entirely destroyed, as it
is largely innate in the body and largely in the soul of the universe,
and ever in desperate conflict with the Better.

3\. In the Soul \[of cosmos\], then, Mind and Reason (*Logos*), the
guide and lord of all the best in it, is Osiris; and so in earth and air
and water and heaven and stars, that which is ordered and appointed and
in health, is the efflux of Osiris, reflected in seasons and
temperatures and periods.

4\. But Typhon is the passionate and titanic and reasonless and
impulsive \[aspect\] of the Soul, while of

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

its corporeal \[side he is\] the death-dealing and pestilent and
disturbing, with unseasonable times and intemperate atmospheres and
concealments of sun and moon,—as though they were the charges and
obliterations of Typhon.

5\. And the name is a predicate of Sēth, as they call Typhon; for
\[Sēth\] means “that which oppresses and constrains by force;” <span
id="fr_1128"></span>[1](#fn_1129.md) it means also, frequently, “turning
upside down,” and, again, “overleaping.”

6\. Some, moreover, say that one of the companions of Typhon was
Bebōn; <span id="fr_1129"></span>[2](#fn_1130.md) while Manethōs \[says\]
that Typhon himself was also called Bebōn, and that the name signifies
“holding back” or “hindering,” since the power of Typhon stands in the
way of things going on their way and moving towards what they have to.

L. 1. Wherefore also of domestic animals they apportion to him the least
tractable—the ass; while of wild ones, the most savage—the crocodile and
hippopotamus.

2\. As to the ass, we have already given some explanation. At
Hermes-city, however, as image of Typhon, they show us a hippopotamus on
which stands a hawk <span id="fr_1130"></span>[3](#fn_1131.md) fighting a
snake,—indicating by the hippopotamus Typhon, and by the hawk power and
rule, of which Typhon frequently possessing himself by force, ceases not
from being himself in and throwing \[others\] into a state of disorder
by means of evil.

3\. Wherefore also when they make offerings on the seventh of the month
Tybi, <span id="fr_1131"></span>[4](#fn_1132.md)—which \[day\] they call

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> “Arrival of Isis
from Phœnicia,” they mould on the cakes a bound hippopotamus. <span
id="fr_1132"></span>[1](#fn_1133.md)

4\. And at Apollo-city it is the custom for absolutely everyone to eat a
piece of crocodile. And on one \[particular\] day they hunt down and
kill as many \[of them\] as they possibly can, and throw them down right
in front of the temple, saying that Typhon escaped Horus by turning
himself into a crocodile,—considering as they do that all animals and
plants and experiences that are evil and harmful are Typhon’s works and
parts and movements.

LI\. 1. Osiris, again, on the other hand, they write with “eye” and
“sceptre,” <span id="fr_1133"></span>[2](#fn_1134.md) the former of which
\[they say\] shows his providence, and the latter his power; just as
Homer, when calling him who is ruler and king of all “Zeus supreme
counsellor,” <span id="fr_1134"></span>[3](#fn_1135.md) seems by “supreme”
to signify his supremacy, and by “counsellor” his good counsel and
providence.

2\. They frequently write this god with “hawk” <span
id="fr_1135"></span>[4](#fn_1136.md) as well; for it excels in tension of
sight and swiftness of flight, and can naturally support itself on the
smallest quantity of food.

3\. It is said, moreover, to hover over the bodies of the unburied dead
and to cast earth upon them. <span id="fr_1136"></span>[5](#fn_1137.md) And
when it drops down on the river to drink, it sets its wings upright, and
after drinking it lowers them again,—by which it is evident it saves
itself and escapes from the crocodile, for if it is caught its wings
remain fixed as they were set. <span id="fr_1137"></span>[6](#fn_1138.md)

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

4\. And everywhere they exhibit a man-shaped image of
Osiris,—ithyphallic, because of his generative and luxuriant \[nature\].

And they dress his statue in a flame-coloured robe,—since they consider
the sun as body of the power of the Good, as it were a visible \[sign\]
of an essence that mind only can conceive.

5\. Wherefore also we should pay no attention to those who assign the
sphere of the sun to Typhon, <span id="fr_1138"></span>[1](#fn_1139.md)—to
whom nothing light or salutary, neither order nor genesis, nor any
motion that has measure and reason, belongs, but \[rather\] their
contraries.

6\. And we should not set down drought which destroys many of the
animals and plants, as the sun’s work, but \[rather as that\] of the
breaths and waters in earth and air not being seasonably blended when
the principle of disorderly and unbounded power makes discord and
quenches the exhalations.

LII\. 1. And in the sacred hymns to Osiris, they invoke him who is
hidden in the Arms of the Sun; <span id="fr_1139"></span>[2](#fn_1140.md)
and on the thirteenth of the month of Epiphi <span
id="fr_1140"></span>[3](#fn_1141.md) they keep with feast the Birthday of
the Eye of Horus, when moon and sun are in the same straight line; as
they think that not only the moon but also the sun is eye and light of
Horus.

2\. And on the eighth of the waning \[half\] of Paōphi <span
id="fr_1141"></span>[4](#fn_1142.md) they keep the Birthday of the Sun’s
Staff, after the autumnal equinox,—signifying that he needs an
under-prop, as it were, and strengthening, deficient as he is

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

in heat and light, declining and moving obliquely from us.

3\. Moreover, just after the winter solstice they carry the Cow round
the shrine \[seven times\], and the circuit is called the Seeking for
Osiris, as in winter the Goddess longs for the “water” of the Sun.

4\. And she goes round this number of times, because he completes his
passing from the winter to the summer solstice in the seventh month.

5\. Moreover, Horus, son of Osiris, is said to have been the first of
all to make offerings to the Sun on the fourth of the waxing moon, as is
written in the \[books\] entitled *Birthdays of Horus*.

6\. Though indeed every day they offer incense to the Sun in three
kinds—resin at his rising, myrrh at mid-heaven, and what is called
“kuphi” at his setting; the reason for each of which I will explain
later on. <span id="fr_1142"></span>[1](#fn_1143.md) And with all these
they think to make the Sun propitious to them and to do him service.

7\. But what need is there to collect many such indications? For there
are those who say point-blank that Osiris is Sun and is called Sirius by
Greeks—though with Egyptians the addition of the article has caused the
name to be mistaken <span id="fr_1143"></span>[2](#fn_1144.md)—and who
declare Isis to be no other than Moon; whence also \[they say\] that the
horned ones of her statues are representations of her crescent, while by
the black-robed ones are signified the occultations and overshadowings
in which she follows Sun longing after him.

8\. Accordingly they invoke Moon for affairs of love; and Eudoxus <span
id="fr_1144"></span>[3](#fn_1145.md) says that Isis decides love-affairs.

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

9\. And these \[explanations\] have in a modified way some share of
plausibility; whereas it is not worth while even listening to those who
make the Sun Typhon.

10\. But let us ourselves again take up the proper reason (*logos*).

<span id="fn_1114"></span>[323:1](th135.htm#fr_1113.md) Mullach, i. 319;
Fairbanks (45), p. 37. The whole *logos* of Heracleitus runs: “They know
not how differing agrees with itself,—back-flying (παλίντονος) harmony
as though of lyre or bow.” That is, as a stretched string flies back
again to its original position.

<span id="fn_1115"></span>[323:2](th135.htm#fr_1114.md) Nauck, p. 294.

<span id="fn_1116"></span>[323:3](th135.htm#fr_1115.md) That is,
presumably, “in *logoi* and voices from heaven.”

<span id="fn_1118"></span>[325:1](th135.htm#fr_1117.md) Thought by some to

<span id="fn_1121"></span>[326:2](th135.htm#fr_1120.md) This may refer to
the consciousness of the spiritual life.

<span id="fn_1122"></span>[326:3](th135.htm#fr_1121.md) There are thus
three thousand years in which Ahura Mazda has the upper hand, three
thousand in which Ahriman is victorious, three thousand in which the
forces are balanced, and in the tenth thousand years comes the Day of
Light. *Cf. Pistis Sophia,* 243: “Jesus answered and said unto Mary: ‘A
Day of Light is a thousand years in the world, so that thirty-six
myriads of years and a half myriad of years of the world make a single
Year of Light.’” The not casting of a shadow was supposed to he a
characteristic of souls not attached to body; but it refers here rather
to those who are “straight” with the Spiritual Sun.
