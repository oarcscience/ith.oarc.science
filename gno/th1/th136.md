##### THE PROPER REASON ACCORDING TO PLUTARCH

LIII\. 1. For Isis is the feminine \[principle\] of Nature and that
which is capable of receiving the whole of genesis; in virtue of which
she has been called “Nurse” and “All-receiving” by Plato, <span
id="fr_1145"></span>[1](#fn_1146.md) and, by the multitude, “She of
ten-thousand names,” through her being transformed by Reason (*Logos*)
and receiving all forms and ideas \[or shapes\].

2\. And she hath an innate love of the First and Most Holy of all things
(which is identical with the Good), and longs after and pursues it. But
she flees from and repels the domain of the Bad, and though she is the
field and matter of them both, yet doth she ever incline to the Better
of herself, and offers \[herself\] for him to beget and sow into herself
emanations and likenesses, with which she joys and delights that she is
pregnant and big with their generations.

3\. For Generation is image of Essence in Matter and Becoming copy of
Being.

LIV\. 1. Hence not unreasonably do they say in the myth that \[while\]
the Soul of Osiris is eternal and indestructible, Typhon often tears his
Body in pieces and makes it disappear, and that Isis seeks it wandering
and puts it together again.

2\. For the Real and Conceivable-by-the-mind-alone and Good is superior
to destruction and change; but the images which the sensible and
corporeal imitates

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

from it, and the reasons (*logoi*) and forms and likenesses which it
receives, just as seal-impressions in wax, do not last for ever, but are
seized upon by the disorderly and turbulent \[elements\], expelled
hither from the field above, and fighting against the Horus whom Isis
brings forth as the sensible image of that cosmos which mind alone can
conceive.

3\. Wherefore also \[Horus\] is said to have a charge of bastardy
brought against him by Typhon—of not being pure and unalloyed like his
sire, Reason (*Logos*), itself by itself, unmixed and impassible, but
bastardized with matter on account of the corporeal \[element\]. <span
id="fr_1146"></span>[1](#fn_1147.md)

4\. Nevertheless, Horus gets the best of it and wins, through
Hermes—that is, the Reason (*Logos*) <span
id="fr_1147"></span>[2](#fn_1148.md)—bearing witness and showing that
Nature reflects the \[true\] Cosmos by changing her forms according to
That-which-mind-alone-can-conceive. <span
id="fr_1148"></span>[3](#fn_1149.md)

5\. For the genesis of Apollo <span id="fr_1149"></span>[4](#fn_1150.md)
from Isis and Osiris <span id="fr_1150"></span>[5](#fn_1151.md) that took
place while the Gods were still in the womb of Rhea, is an enigmatical
way of stating that before this \[sensible\] cosmos became manifest, and
Matter was perfected by Reason (*Logos*), Nature, proving herself
imperfect, of herself brought forth her first birth.

6\. Wherefore also they say that that God was lame <span
id="fr_1151"></span>[6](#fn_1152.md) in the dark, and call him Elder Horus;
for he was not cosmos, but a sort of image and phantasm of the world
which was to be. <span id="fr_1152"></span>[7](#fn_1153.md)

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

LV\. 1. But this Horus \[of ours\] is their Son, <span
id="fr_1153"></span>[1](#fn_1154.md) horizoned <span
id="fr_1154"></span>[2](#fn_1155.md) and perfect, who has not destroyed
Typhon utterly, but has brought over to his side his efficacy and
strength; hence they say it is that the statue of Horus at Coptos grasps
in one hand Typhon’s *virilia*.

2\. Moreover, they have a myth that Hermes cut out the sinews of Typhon
and used them for lyre strings,—\[thus\] teaching \[us\] how Reason
(*Logos*) brought the universe into harmony, and made it concordant out
of discordant elements. He did not destroy the destructive power but
lamed it.

3\. Hence while weak and ineffective up there, down here, by being
blinded and interwoven with the passible and changeable elements, it is
cause of shakings and tremors in earth, of droughts and tempests in air,
and again of lightnings and thunderings.

4\. Moreover, it infects waters and winds with pestilences, and shoots
up and rears itself as far as the moon, frequently blurring and
blackening its light, as Egyptians think.

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

5\. And they say that Typhon at one time strikes the Eye of Horus, and
at another takes it out and swallows it. By “striking” they refer
enigmatically to the monthly diminution of the moon, and by “blinding”
to its eclipse, which the sun remedies by immediately shining on it
after it has passed out of the shadow of the earth. <span
id="fr_1155"></span>[1](#fn_1156.md)

LVI\. 1. Now the better and diviner Nature is from these:—\[to wit\] the
Intelligible and Matter, and that from them which Greeks call Cosmos.

2\. Plato, <span id="fr_1156"></span>[2](#fn_1157.md) indeed, was wont to
call the Intelligible Idea and Model and Father; and Matter Mother and
Nurse—both place and ground of Genesis; and the offspring of both
Genesis.

3\. And one might conjecture that Egyptians \[also revered <span
id="fr_1157"></span>[3](#fn_1158.md)\] the fairest of the triangles,
likening the nature of the universe especially to this; for Plato also,
in his *Republic,* <span id="fr_1158"></span>[4](#fn_1159.md) seems to have
made additional use of this in drawing up his marriage scheme. <span
id="fr_1159"></span>[5](#fn_1160.md)

4\. And this triangle has its perpendicular \[side\] of “three,” its
base of “four,” and its hypotenuse of “five”; its square being equal to
the \[sum of the\] squares on the containing sides. <span
id="fr_1160"></span>[6](#fn_1161.md)

5\. We must, accordingly, compare its perpendicular to male, its base to
female, and its hypotenuse to the offspring of both; and \[conjecture\]
Osiris as source, Isis as receptacle, and Horus as result.

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

6\. For the “three” is the first “odd” <span
id="fr_1161"></span>[1](#fn_1162.md) and perfect; <span
id="fr_1162"></span>[2](#fn_1163.md) while the “four” \[is\] square from
side “even” two; <span id="fr_1163"></span>[3](#fn_1164.md) and the “five”
resembles partly its father and partly its mother, being composed of
“three” and “two.”

7\. And *panta* \[all\] is only a slight variant of *pente* \[five\];
and they call counting *pempasasthai* \[reckoning by fives\].

8\. And five makes a square equal to the number of letters among
Egyptians, <span id="fr_1164"></span>[4](#fn_1165.md) and a period of as
many years as the Apis lives.

9\. Thus they usually call Horus also Min <span
id="fr_1165"></span>[5](#fn_1166.md)—that is, “being seen”; for cosmos is a
sensible and see-able thing.

10\. And Isis is sometimes called Muth, <span
id="fr_1166"></span>[6](#fn_1167.md) and again Athyri <span
id="fr_1167"></span>[7](#fn_1168.md) and Methyer. And by the first of the
names they mean “Mother”; by the second, “Cosmic House” of Horus,—as
also Plato \[calls her\] “Ground of Genesis” and “She who receives”; and
the third is compounded from “Full” and “Cause,”—for Matter is full of

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cosmos, and
consorts with the Good and Pure and Ordered.

LVII\. 1. And Hesiod <span id="fr_1168"></span>[1](#fn_1169.md) also, when
he makes all the first \[elements to be\] Chaos and Earth and Tartarus
and Love, might be thought to assume no other principles than these,—if
at anyrate in substituting the names we assign to Isis that of Earth, to
Osiris that of Love, and to Typhon that of Tartarus; for his Chaos seems
to be subsumed as ground and place of the universe.

2\. Our data also in a way invite as witness Plato’s myth which Socrates
details in the *Symposium* <span id="fr_1169"></span>[2](#fn_1170.md) about
the Birth of Love,—telling \[us how\] that Poverty wanting children lay
down by the side of sleeping Means, and conceiving by him brought forth
Love of a mixed nature and capable of assuming every shape, in as much,
indeed, as he is the offspring of a good and wise father and one
sufficient for all, but of an incapable mother and one without
means, <span id="fr_1170"></span>[3](#fn_1171.md) who on account of her
need is ever clinging to some one else and importuning some one
else. <span id="fr_1171"></span>[4](#fn_1172.md)

3\. For his Means is no other than the First Beloved and Desirable and
Perfect and Sufficient; and he calls Matter Poverty,—who is herself of
herself deficient of the Good, but is ever being filled by Him and
longing for and sharing in \[Him\].

4\. And the Cosmos, that is Horus, is born from these; and Horus, though
neither eternal nor impassible nor indestructible, but ever-generable,
continues by means of the changes and periods of his passions to remain
ever young and ever to escape destruction.

LVIII\. 1. Now, we should make use of the myths not

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

as though they were altogether sacred sermons (*logoi*), but taking the
serviceable \[element\] of each according to its similitude \[to
reason\].

2\. When, then, we say Matter, we should not be swept into the opinions
of some philosophers, and suppose some body or other of itself soul-less
and quality-less, and inert and inefficient; for we call oil the
“matter” of a perfume, \[and\] gold that of a statue, though they are
not destitute of every quality.

3\. \[Nay,\] we submit the soul itself and \[even\] the thought of man
as the “matter” of knowledge and virtue to the reason (*logos*) to order
and bring into rhythm.

4\. Moreover, some have declared the mind \[to be\] “region of ideas,”
and, as it were, the “impressionable substance <span
id="fr_1172"></span>[1](#fn_1173.md) of the intelligibles.”

5\. And some think that the substance of the woman <span
id="fr_1173"></span>[2](#fn_1174.md) is neither power nor source, but
matter and nutriment of birth.

6\. If, then, we attach ourselves to these, we ought thus also to think
of this Goddess as having eternally her share in the First God, and
consorting \[with Him\] for love of the goodness and beauty that
surround Him, never opposed to Him, but, just as we say that a lawful
and righteous husband loves \[his wife\] righteously, and a good wife
though she has her husband and consorts with him, still desires \[him\],
so \[should we\] think of Her as clinging to Him, and importuning
Him, <span id="fr_1174"></span>[3](#fn_1175.md) though \[ever\] filled full
with His supremest and purest parts.

LIX\. 1. But where Typhon steals in, laying hold of the last \[parts, we
should think of Her as\] then seeming to wear a melancholy countenance,
and being said to

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

mourn, and to be seeking after certain relics and fragments of Osiris,
and enfolding them in her robes, receiving them when destroyed into
herself, and hiding them away, just as She also produces them again when
they are born, and sends them forth from herself.

2\. For while the reasons (*logoi*) and ideas and emanations of the God
in heaven and stars remain \[for ever\], those that are disseminated
into things passible—in earth and sea and plants and animals—being
dissolved and destroyed and buried, come to light over and over again
and reappear in their births.

3\. For which cause the myth says that Typhon lived with Nephthys, but
that Osiris had knowledge of her secretly.

4\. For the last parts of Matter, which they call Nephthys and End, are
mainly in possession of the destructive power; nevertheless the
Generative and Saving One distributes into them weak and faint seed
which is destroyed by Typhon, except so much as Isis by adoption saves
and nourishes and compacts together.

LX\. 1. But He is on the whole the Better one, as both Plato and
Aristotle suppose; and the generative and moving \[power\] of Nature
moves to Him and towards being, while the annihilating and destructive
\[moves\] from Him and towards non-being.

2\. Wherefore they derive the name Isis from hastening (ἵεσθαι) and
coursing with knowledge, since she is ensouled and prudent motion.

3\. For her name is not foreign; <span id="fr_1175"></span>[1](#fn_1176.md)
but just as all the Gods have a common name from two elements—“that
which can be seen” and “that which runs” <span
id="fr_1176"></span>[2](#fn_1177.md)—so *we*

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

call this Goddess “Isis” from “knowledge,” <span
id="fr_1177"></span>[1](#fn_1178.md) and Egyptians \[also\] call her
Isis. <span id="fr_1178"></span>[2](#fn_1179.md)

4\. And thus Plato also says the ancients signified the “Holy <span
id="fr_1179"></span>[3](#fn_1180.md) \[Lady\]” by calling her “Isia,”—and
so also “Mental Perception” and “Prudence,” in as much as she is \[the
very\] course and motion of Mind hastening <span
id="fr_1180"></span>[4](#fn_1181.md) and coursing, and that they placed
Understanding—in short, the Good and Virtue—in things that flow <span
id="fr_1181"></span>[5](#fn_1182.md) and run.

5\. Just as \[he says\] again, the Bad is railed at with corresponding
names, when they call that which hinders nature and binds it up and
holds it and prevents it from hastening and going, “badness,” <span
id="fr_1182"></span>[6](#fn_1183.md) “difficulty,” <span
id="fr_1183"></span>[7](#fn_1184.md) “cowardice” <span
id="fr_1184"></span>[8](#fn_1185.md) \[and\] “distress.”

LXI\. 1. And Osiris has had his name from a combination of ὅσιος (holy)
and ἱερός (sacred); for there is a common Reason (*Logos*) of things in
Heaven and of things in Hades,—the former of which the ancients were
accustomed to call sacred, and the latter holy.

2\. And the Reason that \[both\] brings \[down\] to light the heavenly
things and is \[also\] of things that are

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

mounting upwards, <span id="fr_1185"></span>[1](#fn_1186.md) is called
Anubis, and sometimes also Hermanubis, <span
id="fr_1186"></span>[2](#fn_1187.md) belonging in his former capacity to
things above and in his latter to things below \[them\].

3\. Wherefore also they offer him in his former capacity a white
cock, <span id="fr_1187"></span>[3](#fn_1188.md) and in his latter a
saffron-coloured one,—thinking that the former things are pure and the
latter mixed and manifold.

4\. Nor ought we to be surprised at the manipulation of the names back
into Greek. <span id="fr_1188"></span>[4](#fn_1189.md) For tens of
thousands of others that disappeared with those who emigrated from
Greece, continue unto this day and sojourn with foreigners; for
recalling some of which they blame the poets’ art as “barbarising,”—I
mean those who call such words “glosses.” <span
id="fr_1189"></span>[5](#fn_1190.md)

5\. Further, they relate that in what are called the “Books of Hermes,”
it is written that they call the Power that rules the ordained
revolution of the Sun, Horus, while the Greeks \[call it\] Apollo; and
the Power that rules the Breath \[or Spirit\], some \[call\] Osiris,
others Sarapis, and others Sōthis in Egyptian.

6\. The last means “conception” (κύησιν) or “conceiving” (τὸ
κύειν). <span id="fr_1190"></span>[6](#fn_1191.md) Wherefore also, by
inversion of the name, the star \[Sōthis\] which they consider the
special one of Isis, is called Dog (κύων) in Greek.

7\. We should, however, least of all be jealous about the names; still
if we were, I would sooner give up

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> “Sarapis” than
“Osiris”; for though I think the former is a foreign one and the latter
Greek, yet are they both \[names\] of One God and One Power.

LXIL 1. The Egyptian \[names\] also resemble these \[Greek ones\]. For
they often call Isis by the name of Athena, which expresses some such
meaning as “I have come from myself”—which is \[again\] indicative of
self-motive course.

2\. While “Typhon,” as has been said, <span
id="fr_1191"></span>[1](#fn_1192.md) is called Sēth and Bebōn and Smu,—the
names being intended to signify a certain forcible and preventative
checking, opposition or reversing.

3\. Moreover, they call the loadstone “Bone of Horus,” <span
id="fr_1192"></span>[2](#fn_1193.md) and iron “\[Bone\] of Typhon,” as
Manethōs relates; for just as iron often resembles that which is
attracted to and follows after the loadstone, and often is turned away
from it, and repelled to an opposite direction, so the saving and good
and reason-possessing motion of the Cosmos both turns towards itself and
makes more gentle by persuasion that harsh and typhonean \[motion\]; and
then again after raising it into itself, it reverses it and plunges it
into the infinitude.

4\. Moreover, Eudoxus <span id="fr_1193"></span>[3](#fn_1194.md) says that
the Egyptians tell a myth about Zeus that, as in consequence of his
having his legs grown together, <span id="fr_1194"></span>[4](#fn_1195.md)
he could not walk, for shame he lived in solitude; and so Isis, by
cutting in two and separating these limbs of his body, made his going
even-footed. <span id="fr_1195"></span>[5](#fn_1196.md)

5\. By those things, moreover, the myth enigmatically

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

hints that the Mind and Reason (*Logos*) of God after it had
progressed <span id="fr_1196"></span>[1](#fn_1197.md) in itself in the
invisible and unmanifest, came forth into genesis by means of motion.

<span id="fn_1153"></span>[334:7](th136.htm#fr_1152.md) These two
paragraphs are, in my opinion, of the utmost value for the critical
investigation of the sources of the famous Sophia mythus of Gnosticism.
The imperfect birth (Abortion) of the Sophia (Wisdom, Nature, Isis), as
the result of her effort to bring forth of herself, without her consort,
or syzygy, while still in the Plērōma (Womb of Rhea), paves the way for
the whole scheme of one of the main forms of Gnostic cosmology and
subsequent soteriology, the Creator Logos and Saviour having to perfect
the imperfect product of Nature. This is, I believe, the first time that
the above passage of Plutarch has been brought into connection with the
Sophia-mythus, and all previous translations with which I am acquainted
accordingly make havoc of the meaning. See *F. F. F.,* pp. 339 ff.; and
for the Pauline use of the technical term “Abortion,” *D. J. L.,* pp.
355 ff.; for “Balaam the Lame Man” (? a by-name for Jeschu-Horus), see
*ibid.,* p. 201. Reitzenstein (pp. 39, 40) quotes these two chapters,

on to say: “Ȧmsu is Horus, the avenger of his father, and his coming
forth is his birth. The plumes upon his head are Isis and Nephthys when
they go forth to set themselves there, even as his protectors, and they
provide that which his head lacketh; or (as others say), they are the

that the soul is bound with a strong chain (δεσμὸς), for λίαν means

with many characteristics of other gods. Thus with Ȧnpu or Anubis he
becomes Ḥeru-em-Ȧnpu, *i.e.* Horus as Anubis, and is said to dwell in
the “divine hall.” This is the Hermanubis of Plutarch. *Cf.* Budge, *op.
