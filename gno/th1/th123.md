##### ADVICE TO KLEA CONCERNING THE HIDDEN MEANING OF THE MYTHS

XI\. 1. When, therefore, thou hearest the myth-sayings of the Egyptians
concerning the Gods—wanderings and

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

dismemberings, and many such passions <span
id="fr_876"></span>[1](#fn_877)—thou shouldst remember what has been
said above, and think none of these things spoken as they \[really\] are
in state and action.

2\. For they do not call Hermes “Dog” as a proper name, but they
associate the watching and waking from sleep of the animal, <span
id="fr_877"></span>[2](#fn_878) who by knowing and not knowing
determines friend from foe (as Plato says <span
id="fr_878"></span>[3](#fn_879)), with the most Logos-like of the Gods.

3\. Nor do they think that the sun rises as a new-born babe from a
lotus, but so they *write* “sun-rise,” riddling the re-kindling of the
sun from moist \[elements\]. <span id="fr_879"></span>[4](#fn_880)

4\. Moreover, they called the most crude and awesome King of the
Persians (Ōchus) <span id="fr_880"></span>[5](#fn_881)—who killed many
and finally cut the throat of Apis and made a hearty meal off him with
his friends—“Knife,” <span id="fr_881"></span>[6](#fn_882) and they call
him so unto this day in the Catalogue <span
id="fr_882"></span>[7](#fn_883) of their kings,—not, of course,
signifying his essence by its proper name, <span
id="fr_883"></span>[8](#fn_884) but likening the hardness of his
mood <span id="fr_884"></span>[9](#fn_885) to an instrument of
slaughter.

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

5\. So too shalt thou, if thou hearest and receivest the \[mysteries\]
about the Gods from those who interpret the myth *purely and according
to the love of wisdom,* and if thou doest ever and keepest carefully the
customs observed by the priests, and if thou thinkest that thou wilt
offer neither sacrifice nor act more pleasing to the Gods than the
holding a true view concerning them,—thou shalt escape an ill no less
than being-without-the-gods, <span id="fr_885"></span>[1](#fn_886)
\[that is to say\] the fearing-of-the-daimones. <span
id="fr_886"></span>[2](#fn_887)

XII\. 1. The myth which is told is—in its very shortest possible
\[elements\], after the purely useless and superfluous have been
removed—as follows:

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_877"></span>[277:1](th123.htm#fr_876) παθήματα—the
technical mystery-term for such experiences, or sensible knowing.

<span id="fn_878"></span>[277:2](th123.htm#fr_877) Or “of the
Animal”—the Living One or Animal Itself or World Soul, if Dog is taken
to mean the genus or Great Dog.

<span id="fn_879"></span>[277:3](th123.htm#fr_878) *Rep.,* ii. 375 F.

<span id="fn_880"></span>[277:4](th123.htm#fr_879) That is, the ideogram
of a new-born child with its finger on its lips seated on the bosom of
the lotus signified “sun-rise,” and “sun-rise” within as well as
without. The “re-kindling” or “lighting up again” was presumably also a
symbol of the “new birth from above.”

<span id="fn_881"></span>[277:5](th123.htm#fr_880) Artaxerxes III.; the
priests, however, presumably used this incident to illustrate some more
general truth. A similar story is also related of Cambyses (xliv. 8);
they also called Ōchus “Ass” (xxxi. 4).

<span id="fn_882"></span>[277:6](th123.htm#fr_881) The sacrificial knife
again, as in x. 2.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[277:7](th123.htm#fr_882) *Cf.* xxxviii. 6.

<span id="fn_884"></span>[277:8](th123.htm#fr_883) Perhaps even meaning
by “his name of power.”

<span id="fn_885"></span>[277:9](th123.htm#fr_884) Or “of the turn,”
where it might refer to the turn of Egypt’s fate-wheel.

<span id="fn_886"></span>[278:1](th123.htm#fr_885) Or “atheism.”

<span id="fn_887"></span>[278:2](th123.htm#fr_886) Generally rendered
“superstition.”
