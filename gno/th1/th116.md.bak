##### WHY THE PRIESTS ARE SHAVEN AND WEAR LINEN

IV\. 1. Now, as far as the “many” are concerned, even this commonest and
smallest \[secret\] is hid from them,—namely, why the priests cut off
their hair, and wear linen robes; for some do not at all care to know
about these things, while others say that they abstain from \[the use
of\] the sheep’s wool, as they do from its flesh, because they hold it
sacred, and that they shave their heads through being in mourning, and
wear linen things on account of the colour which the flax in flower
sends forth, resembling the ætherial radiance <span
id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_803.md) that surrounds the cosmos.

2\. But the true cause, \[the\] one of all, is, as Plato says,
\[because\]: “It is not lawful for pure to touch not pure.” <span
id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_804.md)

Now, superfluity <span id="fr_804"></span>[3](#fn_805.md) of nourishment
and excretion is nothing chaste or pure; and it is from superfluities
that wool and fur and hair and nails spring up and grow.

3\. It would, thus, be laughable for them to cut off their own hair in
the purifications, shaving themselves, and making smooth their whole
body evenly, and \[then\] put on and wear the \[hair\] of animals. <span
id="fr_805"></span>[4](#fn_806.md)

4\. For indeed we should think that Hesiod, when he says:

> <span style="font-size: small">Nor from five-branched at fire-blooming
> of Gods  
> Cut dry from green with flashing blade <span
> id="fr_806"></span>[5](#fn_807.md)—</span>

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

teaches that \[men\] ought to keep holy day only when pure of such
\[superfluities\], and not at the sacred operations themselves have need
of purification and the removal of superfluities.

5\. Again, the flax grows out of the deathless earth, and yields a fruit
that man may eat, and offers him a smooth pure raiment that does not
weigh upon the watcher, <span id="fr_807"></span>[1](#fn_808.md) but is
well joined for every hour, <span id="fr_808"></span>[2](#fn_809.md) and is
the least cone-bearing, <span id="fr_809"></span>[3](#fn_810.md) as they
say,—concerning which things there is another reason (*logos*).

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_803"></span>[265:1](th116.htm#fr_802.md) χρόαν—also meaning
surface, skin, and tone in melody.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[265:2](th116.htm#fr_803.md) *Phæd.,* 67 B.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[265:3](th116.htm#fr_804.md) περίσσωμα—also
probably here a play on that which is “round the body” (περὶ
σῶμα)—namely, the hair.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[265:4](th116.htm#fr_805.md) θρεμμάτων—lit.,
“things nourished” (from τρέφω), presumably a play on the “nourishment”
(τροφή) above.

<span id="fn_807"></span>[265:5](th116.htm#fr_806.md) *Op. et Dies,* 741 f.
This scrap of ancient gnomic wisdom Hesiod has preserved, I believe,
from the “Orphic” fragments still in circulation in his day in Bœotia
among the people from an Older Greece. I have endeavoured to translate
it according to the most primitive meaning of the words. In later days
it was thought that “five-branched” was the hand, and that the couplet
referred to a prohibition against paring the nails at a feast of the
Gods! In this sense also Plutarch partly uses it. But if I am right in
my version, we have in the lines a link with that very early tradition
in Greece which in later times was revived by the Later Platonic School,
in a renewed contact with the ancient Chaldæan mystery-tradition of the
Fire. “Five-branched” would thus mean man, or rather purified man, and
the saying referred to the “pruning of this tree.” In it also we have an
example of a “Pythagorean symbol” three hundred years before Pythagoras.
Finally, I would remind the reader of the Saying which the Master is
said to have uttered as He passed to the Passion of the Crucifixion
(Luke xxiii. 31): “For if they do these things in the moist stock \[A.V.
green tree\], what shall be done in the dry?”—presumably the quotation
of an old gnomic saying or mystery *logos*. The “moist nature” is the
feminine side of the “fiery” or “dry.”

<span id="fn_808"></span>[266:1](th116.htm#fr_807.md) Reading σκοποῦντι for
σκέποντι—that is, the soul.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[266:2](th116.htm#fr_808.md) εὐάρμοστον δὲ πρὸς
πᾶσαν ὥραν—“well adapted for every season” is the common translation;
the “hour,” however, is a technical astrological term.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[266:3](th116.htm#fr_809.md) *Vulg.,*
“lice-producing”—but φθείρ also means a special kind of pine producing
small cones; and the great cone was a symbol of the Logos, and the small
cone of physical generation. It is also connected with φθείρω, meaning
to corrupt, and so to breed corruption.
