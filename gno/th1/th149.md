### XV

#### CONCERNING THE CRATER OR CUP

“<span class="smallcaps">He</span> filled a mighty Cup with it \[Mind\],
and sent it down, joining a Herald \[to it\], to whom He gave command to
make this proclamation to the hearts of men: Baptize thyself with this
Cup’s baptism,” etc.—*C. H.,* iv. (v.) 4.

##### THE CRATER IN PLATO

Whence came this idea of a Crater or Cup into our Trismegistic
literature? Most scholars will answer unhesitatingly: From Plato. The
Crater was the Cup in which the Creator mixed the Elements of the
World-Soul; for we read in *Timæus* (41 D), where Plato is treating of
the formation of human souls:

“Thus spake He, and once again into the Cup which He had used in
blending and mingling the Soul of the Universe, He poured the remains of
the Elements He had employed, and mingled them in much the same manner;
they were not, however, pure as before, but in the second and third
degree.”

I am, however, not inclined to attribute the origin of this symbolic
expression simply to the imagery of Plato’s poetic mind, but am far more
inclined to believe that Plato was using a familiar figure of “Orphic”
symbolism. The idea of not only an Ultimate Crater,

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

but of many subsidiary ones in the celestial and invisible realms, is
closely connected with the “Orphic” idea of a Vortex.

##### IN “ORPHEUS,” MACROBIUS, AND PROCLUS

Orpheus is said to have called the Æther the Mighty Whirlpool. <span
id="fr_1451"></span>[1](#fn_1452.md) This forms the Egg or Womb of Cosmos;
it is a modification of Chaos or Rhea, the Eternally-flowing, the Mother
of the Gods, the Great Container. Thus Proclus, in speaking of Chaos,
says:

“The last Infinity, by which also Matter (ὕλη) is circumscribed, is the
Container, the field and plane of ideas. About her is ‘neither limit,
nor foundation, nor seat, but excessive Darkness.’” <span
id="fr_1452"></span>[2](#fn_1453.md)

Plato, as we have seen, in his psychogony, speaks openly of this Cup or
Crater (Mixing Space, or Vortex) in two aspects; in it the Deity mixes
the All-Soul of universal nature from the purest Cosmic Elements, and
from it He also “ladles out” the souls of men, composed of a less pure
mixture of these Elements.

Further, Macrobius tells us that Plato elsewhere indirectly refers to
another aspect of this Cup.

“Plato speaks of this in the *Phædo,* and says that the soul is dragged
back into body, hurried on by new intoxication, desiring to taste a
fresh draught of the overflow of matter, <span
id="fr_1453"></span>[3](#fn_1454.md) whereby it is weighed down and brought
back \[to earth\]. The sidereal \[astral\] Crater of Father Liber
\[Dionysus, Bacchus\] is a symbol of this mystery; and this is what the
Ancients called the

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> River of Lethe,
the Orphics saying that Father Liber was Hylic Mind.” <span
id="fr_1454"></span>[1](#fn_1455.md)

We have here, therefore, a higher and lower Cup. Proclus, moreover,
speaks of several of such Craters, when he writes:

“Plato in the *Philebus* hands on the tradition of the Vulcanic
Crater . . . and Orpheus is acquainted with the Cup of Dionysus, and
ranges many such Cups round the Solar Table.” <span
id="fr_1455"></span>[2](#fn_1456.md)

Elsewhere, again, Proclus tells us that the Demiurge is said “to
constitute the psychical essences in conjunction with the Crater”; this
“Crater is the peculiar cause of souls, and is co-arranged with the
Demiurgus and filled from Him, but fills souls”; thus it is called the
Fountain of Souls. <span id="fr_1456"></span>[3](#fn_1457.md)

If with these indications before us we might venture to generalize, we
might say that, according to Orpheo-Pythagorean, Platonic, and Hermetic
ideas, the “matter” of every “plane” was thought of as proceeding from
such a Crater or Cup, from within without, and the elements thereof as
being refunded into such a Cup or Centre or Receptacle—that is, from a
more subtle, simpler, and inner phase to a more gross, complex, and
outer phase, and *vice versâ*. In other words, the Crater is the
“monadic” or “atomic” state of the matter of any given phase or state of
existence.

##### THE VISION OF ARIDÆUS

With the above *data* before us, it will also be instructive to turn to
the Vision of Aridæus (Thespesius)

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

as related by Plutarch, <span id="fr_1457"></span>[1](#fn_1458.md) a vision
that may be compared with profit with the Vision of Er as told by Plato.
Thespesius is being conducted through Hades, or the Invisible World in
contact with earth-life, by a kinsman who has “passed over,” as
Spiritists would say, and curiously enough he there comes across a Chasm
and a Crater—for part of the story runs:

“After these explanations he was conducted by his kinsman at great speed
across an immense space, as it seemed, nevertheless easily and directly
as though supported by wings of light-rays; until having arrived at a
Vast Vortex (χάσμα) extending downwards, he was abandoned by the power
that supported him.

“He observed also that the same thing happened to the rest of the souls
there, for checking their flight, like birds, and sinking down, they
fluttered round the Vortex in a circle, not daring to go straight
through it.

“Inside it seemed to be decked like Bacchic caves <span
id="fr_1458"></span>[2](#fn_1459.md) with trees and verdure and every kind
of foliage, while out of it came a soft and gentle air, laden with
marvellous sweet scents, making a blend like wine for topers, so that
the souls feasting on the fragrance were melted with delight in mutual
embraces, while the whole place was wrapt in revelry and laughter and
the spirit of sport and pleasure. <span
id="fr_1459"></span>[3](#fn_1460.md)

“Thespesius’ kinsman told him that this was the Way by which Dionysus
ascended to the Gods and

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

afterwards took up Semele; <span id="fr_1460"></span>[1](#fn_1461.md) it
was called the Place of Lēthē (Oblivion). <span
id="fr_1461"></span>[2](#fn_1462.md)

“Wherefore he would not suffer Thespesius to stay there, though he
wished to do so, but forcibly dragged him away, explaining how that the
rational part of the soul was melted and moistened <span
id="fr_1462"></span>[3](#fn_1463.md) by pleasure, while the irrational
part, and that which is of a corporeal nature, being then moistened and
made fleshly, awakens the memory of the body, and from this memory come
a yearning and a desire which drag down the soul into

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

generation . . . the soul being weighed down with moisture.

“Next Thespesius, after travelling another great distance, seemed to be
looking at a huge Cup, <span id="fr_1463"></span>[1](#fn_1464.md) with
streams flowing into it; one whiter than the foam of the sea or snow,
another like the purple which the rainbow sends forth, while from a
distance the others were tinged with other colours, each having its own
shade.

“But when he came closer, the Cup itself (into which they flowed)—the
surroundings disappearing, and the colours growing fainter—lost its
varied colouring and only retained a white brilliance.”

Compare also the Hellenist writer in the Naassene Document (§ 17 S.):
“The Greek theologi generally call Him \[the Logos\] the “Heavenly Horn
of Mēn,” because he has mixed and mingled all things with all.”

On this the Jewish Gnostic writer comments: “This is the Drinking
Vessel,—the Cup in which ‘the King drinketh and divineth.’”

It is, says the Hellenist commentator again, “the Cup (of Anacreon)
speaking forth speechlessly the Ineffable Mystery.”

The Jewish commentator was a contemporary of Philo’s, and the Hellenist
was prior to him; thus we see that the Cup symbol was used in precisely
the same significance as in our text in at least the first century B.C.,
and that the idea was referred to the Greek theologers—in other words,
the Orphics—and not to Plato.

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

##### THE ORIGIN OF THE SYMBOL TO BE SOUGHT IN ORPHIC TRADITION

With the above *data* before us, I think we may be persuaded without
difficulty that the idea of the Cup, or Mixing-Bowl, did not owe its
origin to any invention of Plato’s, but that the greatest of
philosophers, when he makes use of the symbol, does but employ a
familiar image well known to his audience—as, indeed, is very apparent
in the summary fashion in which he introduces the figure. In other
words, the symbol or image was a commonplace of the Orphic tradition,
and doubtless, therefore, familiar to every Pythagorean.

Now, in our treatise it is noticeable that this Cup-symbol is equated
with the Monad <span id="fr_1464"></span>[1](#fn_1465.md) or Oneness—a
technical Pythagorean term.

<span id="fn_1459"></span>[453:2](th149.htm#fr_1458.md) Were the Bacchic
Mysteries then celebrated in caves?

<span id="fn_1460"></span>[453:3](th149.htm#fr_1459.md) This is clearly in
correspondence with the “Astral Crater of Father Liber” of Macrobius.

<span id="fn_1461"></span>[454:1](th149.htm#fr_1460.md) His “mother,” from
the under-world; referring to the mysteries of generation and the
indestructibility of life. Semele in giving birth to Dionysus the Son of
Zeus (the Creative Power), is said to have been killed by the Power of
her Lord, but she was subsequently restored to life among the Gods by
the Power of her Son. In reincarnating, it is said that part of the soul
in giving birth to itself in this state “dies.” The “child” then born
may, in his turn, in the case of one perfect, become the saviour of his
“mother,” now become his spouse, and raise her, who is also himself, to
a higher state.

<span id="fn_1462"></span>[454:2](th149.htm#fr_1461.md) Compare *Pistis
Sophia* (336, 337), which tells us how certain kārmic agencies “give
unto the old soul \[prior to reincarnation\] a Draught of Oblivion
composed of the Seed of Iniquity, filled with all manner of desire and
all forgetfulness. And the moment that that soul drinketh of that
Draught, it forgetteth all the spaces \[or regions\] through which it
hath travelled, and all the chastisements through which it hath passed;
and that deadly Draught of Oblivion becometh a body external to the
soul, like unto the soul in every way, and its perfect resemblance, and
hence they call it the ‘counterfeit spirit.’”  
  
But in the case of the purified soul it is different; for a higher power
“bringeth a Cup full of intuition and wisdom, and also prudence, and
giveth it to the soul, and casteth the soul into a body which will not
be able to fall asleep or forget, because of the Cup of Prudence which
hath been given unto it, but will be ever pure in heart and seeking
after the Mysteries of Light, until it hath found them, by order of the
Virgin of Light, in order that \[that soul\] may inherit the Light for
ever.” (*Ibid.,* 392, “Books of the Saviour.”)

<span id="fn_1463"></span>[454:3](th149.htm#fr_1462.md) Compare the “Moist
Essence” of *C. H.,* i. 4, and iii. (iv.) 1.

<span id="fn_1464"></span>[455:1](th149.htm#fr_1463.md) κρατήρ—bowl or
basin.

<span id="fn_1465"></span>[456:1](th149.htm#fr_1464.md) It is of interest
to notice that one of the apocryphal *Books of Moses* was called *The
Monad,* and another *The Key*; this argues an early date and wide renown
for our two treatises so entitled. See R. 182, n. 3.
