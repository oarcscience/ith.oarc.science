##### THE THEORY OF THE PHYSICISTS

XXXII\. 1. <span id="fr_1058"></span>[4](#fn_1059) The above \[data\]
then afford \[us\] such and such suggestions. But from another start let
us consider the simplest of those who seem to give a more philosophical
explanation.

2\. These are those who say that, just as the Greeks allegorise time as
Kronos, and air as Hera, and the changes of air into fire as the
generation of Hephæstus, so, with the Egyptians, Osiris uniting with
Isis (earth) is Neilos, and Typhon is the sea, into which Neilos falling
vanishes and is dispersed, except such part \[of him\] as the earth
takes up and receives, and so becomes endowed with productiveness by
him.

3\. And there is a sacred dirge made on Kronos <span
id="fr_1059"></span>[5](#fn_1060)—and it laments “him who is born in the
left-hand and died in the right-hand parts.”

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

4\. For Egyptians think that the eastern \[parts\] of cosmos are “face,”
the northern “right hand,” and the southern “left hand.”

5\. The Nile, accordingly, since it flows from the southern \[parts\]
and is consumed by the sea in the northern, is naturally said to have
its birth in the left hand and its death in the right hand.

6\. Wherefore the priests both pronounce the sea expiate and call salt
“Typhon’s foam”; and one of the chief prohibitions they have is: “Not to
set salt on table.” And they do not give greeting to sailors, <span
id="fr_1060"></span>[1](#fn_1061) because they use the sea, and get
their living from it. And for this cause chiefly they accuse fish of
being a cause of offence, and write up: “Hate fish!”

7\. At anyrate at Saïs, in the entrance of the temple of Athena, there
used to be chiselled up “babe,” “old man,” and after that “hawk,” then
“fish,” and last of all “hippopotamus.”

8\. This meant in symbols: “O ye who are being born and are dying, God
hates shamelessness.”

9\. For “babe” is the symbol of birth, and “old man” of death, and by
“hawk” they mean God, and by “fish” hatred—as has been said on account
of the sea—and by “hippopotamus” shamelessness, for it is fabled that
after it has killed its sire it violates its dam.

10\. Moreover, what is said by the Pythagorics, namely, that the sea is
the tears of Kronos, would seem to riddle the fact of its not being pure
and cognate with itself.

11\. Let these things then be stated from outside sources as matters of
common information.

XXXIII\. 1. But the more wise of the priests call not only the Nile
Osiris, and the sea Typhon; but \[they

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

call\] without exception every source and power that moistens,
Osiris—considering \[him\] cause of generation and essence of seed, and
Typhon everything dry and fiery, and of a drying nature generally and
one hostile to moisture.

2\. And for this cause also, as they think he \[Typhon\] was born with a
reddish-yellow body, somewhat pale, they do not by any means readily
meet or willingly associate with men that look like this.

3\. On the other hand, again, they say in the language of myth that
Osiris was born black, because all \[Nile\] water blackens both earth
and garments and clouds when mixed \[with them\], and \[because\]
moisture in the young makes their hair black, whereas greyness comes on
those past their prime, as though it were a turning pale owing to its
drying up.

4\. The spring, too, is blooming and productive and balmy; but autumn,
through lack of moisture, is inimical to plants and baneful to animals.

5\. And the ox that is kept at Sun-city which they call Mnevis—sacred to
Osiris, while some also consider it sire of Apis—is black \[also\] and
has second honours after Apis.

6\. Moreover, they call Egypt, since it is especially black-soiled, just
like the black of the eye, Chēmia, and liken it to a heart; for it is
warm and moist, and is mostly confined in, and adjacent to, the southern
part of the civilised world, just like the heart \[is\] in man’s
left-hand side.

XXXIV\. 1. Moreover, they say that sun and moon do not use chariots for
vehicles, but sail round in boats—\[thus\] riddling their being
nourished by and being born in the “Moist.”

2\. And they think that Homer also, like Thales, set down Water as
source and birth of all things, after

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

learning \[it\] from Egyptians; for that Oceanus is Osiris, and
Tēthys <span id="fr_1061"></span>[1](#fn_1062) Isis, as nursing all
things and rearing them all up together.

3\. For Greeks also call “emission of seed” ἀπ-ουσίαν and “intercourse”
συν-ουσίαν, and “son” (υἱὸν) from “water” (ὕδατος) and “moisten”
(ὗσαι); <span id="fr_1062"></span>[2](#fn_1063) and \[they call\]
Dionysus Huēs, as lord of the Moist Nature, in that he is no other than
Osiris.

4\. In fact, Hellanicus <span id="fr_1063"></span>[3](#fn_1064) seems to
have heard Osiris called Hu-siris by the priests; for he persists in
thus calling the god, presumably from his nature and power of
invention. <span id="fr_1064"></span>[4](#fn_1065)

<span id="fn_1059"></span>[307:4](th131.htm#fr_1058) This paragraph and
the next is quoted by Eusebius, *Præp. Ev.,* III. iii. 11.

<span id="fn_1060"></span>[307:5](th131.htm#fr_1059) That is Nile.

<span id="fn_1061"></span>[308:1](th131.htm#fr_1060) Lit., “pilots”; but
presumably here used in a more general sense.

<span id="fn_1062"></span>[310:1](th131.htm#fr_1061) As connected with
Τήθη, the Nurse of all, and identified by some with the Primal Earth;
and so signified by the word-play Τηθὺν and τιθην-ουμένην (“nursing”).

<span id="fn_1063"></span>[310:2](th131.htm#fr_1062) The word-play runs:
ap-*ous*-ia, sun-*ous*-ia, *hu*-ion, *hud*-atos, *hus*-ai.

the Greek logographers; fl. 553-504 B.C.

<span id="fn_1065"></span>[310:4](th131.htm#fr_1064) εὑρέσεως—probably
another word-play, *heuresis* and *husiris*.
