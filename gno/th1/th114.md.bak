##### THE ART OF KNOWING AND OF DIVINISING

II\. 1. Wherefore the longing for the Godly state is a desire for Truth,
and specially the \[truth\] about the Gods, in so much as it doth
embrace reception of the sacred \[things\]—instruction and
research; <span id="fr_785"></span>[1](#fn_786.md) a work more holy than is
all and every purging rite and temple-service, and not least pleasing to
that Goddess whom thou servest, in that she is particularly wise and
wisdom-loving, seeing her very name doth seem to indicate that knowing
and that gnosis <span id="fr_786"></span>[2](#fn_787.md) is more suitable
to her than any other title.

2\. For that “Isis” is Greek, <span id="fr_787"></span>[3](#fn_788.md) and
\[so is\] “Typhōn”—in that he’s foe unto the Goddess, and is “puffed
up” <span id="fr_788"></span>[4](#fn_789.md) through \[his\] unknowing and
deceit, and tears the Holy Reason (*Logos*) into pieces and makes away
with it; the which the Goddess gathers up again and recomposes, and
transmits to those perfected in the art of divinising, <span
id="fr_789"></span>[5](#fn_790.md)—which by the means of a continually
sober life

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

and by \[their\] abstinence from many foods and sexual indulgences,
tempers intemperate pleasure-love, and doth accustom \[them\] to
undergo, without being broken down, the rigorous tasks of service in the
sacred \[rites\], the end of which is gnosis of the First and Lordly
One, the One whom mind alone can know, <span
id="fr_790"></span>[1](#fn_791.md) for whom the Goddess calls on \[them\]
to seek, though He is by her side and one with her.

3\. Nay more, the very appellation of the holy \[place\] doth plainly
promise gnosis, that is *eidēsis,* of That-which-is; for it is named
*Iseion,* as though “of them who *shall* know” <span
id="fr_791"></span>[2](#fn_792.md) That-which-is, if that with reason
(*logos*) and with purity <span id="fr_792"></span>[3](#fn_793.md) we enter
in the holy \[places\] of the Goddess.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_786"></span>[262:1](th114.htm#fr_785.md) τὴν μάθησιν . . . καὶ
ζήτησιν. Mathesis was the technical Pythagorean term for gnosis.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[262:2](th114.htm#fr_786.md) τὸ εἰδ-έναι καὶ τὴν
ἐπ-ισ-τήμην—word-plays on ἶσις.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[262:3](th114.htm#fr_787.md) *Cf.* lx. 2. The
Egyptian of Isis is Ȧst.

<span id="fn_789"></span>[262:4](th114.htm#fr_788.md) τετυφωμένος—a play on
τυφών—lit., “wrapped in smoke (τῦφος),” and because one so wrapped in
smoke or clouds has his intelligence darkened, hence “puffed up with
conceit,” crazy and demented. Typhōn is the dark or hidden side of the
Father.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[262:5](th114.htm#fr_789.md) θειώσεως (not in L.
and S. or Soph.); it presumably comes from the stem of θειόω, which
means: (i.) to smoke with sulphur and so purify; (ii.) to make divine
(θεῖος), and so transmute into godship. The sentence may thus also mean
“those initiated into the sulphur rite”—a not impossible rendering when
we remember the Alchemical literature which had its source in
Chemia-Egypt. It will also permit us to connect brimstone with
Typhōn—hoofs and all!

<span id="fn_791"></span>[263:1](th114.htm#fr_790.md) Or the
Intelligible—νοητοῦ.

<span id="fn_792"></span>[263:2](th114.htm#fr_791.md) εἰς-ομένων τὸ ὄν—a
play on ἰσ-εῖ-ον—fut. of √ϝιδ (*vid*) from which comes also εἴδησις
above. This may also mean “seeing” as well as “knowing,” and thus may
refer to the Epopteia or Mystery of Sight, and not the preliminary
Mystery of Hearing (Muēsis).

<span id="fn_793"></span>[263:3](th114.htm#fr_792.md) ὁσίως—another play on
ἶσις; *cf.* lx. 3.
