##### CONCERNING SARAPIS

4\. For they say that Sarapis is no other than Pluto, and Isis
Persephassa, as Archemachus of Eubœa has said, <span
id="fr_1029"></span>[3](#fn_1030.md) and Heracleides of Pontus, when he
supposes that the seat of the oracle at Canopus is Pluto’s.

XXVIII\. 1. And Ptolemy the Saviour <span
id="fr_1030"></span>[4](#fn_1031.md) saw in a dream the gigantic statue of
Pluto—though he had not previously seen or known what form it
was—ordering him to bring it to Alexandria.

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

2\. And when he did not know and had no idea where \[the statue\] was
set up even after he had described his vision to his friends, there was
found a man, a great traveller, by name Sōsibius, who said he had seen
at Sinope just such a colossus as the King seemed to have seen.

3\. He \[Ptolemy\] accordingly sent Sōtelēs and Dionysius, who, after
expending much time and pains, not, however, without the help of God’s
providence, removed it secretly and brought it away.

4\. And when it had been brought \[to Alexandria\] and set up publicly,
the assistants of Timotheus, the interpreter, and of Manethōs, the
Sebennyte, coming to the conclusion that it was a statue of
Pluto—judging by its cerberus and huge serpent—convinced Ptolemy that it
was that of no other of the Gods than Sarapis; for it did not come from
Sinopē with this designation, but after it had been brought to
Alexandria it received the Egyptian name for Pluto, namely, Sarapis.

5\. And yet people sink into the opinion of Heracleitus the physicist,
when he says: “Hades <span id="fr_1031"></span>[1](#fn_1032.md) and
Dionysus are the same, for whomsoever they rage and riot.”

For those who postulate that Hades means the body, because the soul is
as it were deranged and drunken in it, put forward a \[too\] meagre
interpretation.

6\. But \[it is\] better to identify Osiris with Dionysus, and
Sarapis <span id="fr_1032"></span>[2](#fn_1033.md) with Osiris, so
designated after he had changed his nature. <span
id="fr_1033"></span>[3](#fn_1034.md) Wherefore “Sarapis” is common to
all, <span id="fr_1034"></span>[4](#fn_1035.md) just as, you know, those
who share in the sacred rites know that “Osiris” is.

<span id="page_303">p. 303</span>

XXIX\. 1. For it is not worth while paying attention to the Phrygian
writings, in which Isis is said to have been the daughter of
Charops, <span id="fr_1035"></span>[1](#fn_1036.md) son of Heracles, and
Typhon \[son\] of Æacus, <span id="fr_1036"></span>[2](#fn_1037.md)
\[also\] son of Heracles.

2\. Nor \[is it worth while\] refraining from disregarding
Phylarchus, <span id="fr_1037"></span>[3](#fn_1038.md) when he writes that
“it was Dionysus who first brought two oxen from India to Egypt, of
which the name of one was Apis, and of the other Osiris; and *Sarapis*
is the name of Him who orders \[or adorns\] the universe from *sairein*
\[‘sweep,’ ‘clean’\], which some say \[means\] ‘beautifying’ and
‘adorning’”;—for these \[remarks\] of Phylarchus are absurd.

3\. But still more so are those of them who say that Sarapis is not a
god, but that the coffin of Apis <span id="fr_1038"></span>[4](#fn_1039.md)
is thus named, and that certain brazen gates at Memphis, called “Gates
of Oblivion and Wailing,” open with a deep mournful sound, when they
bury Apis, and that therefore at every sounding of brass <span
id="fr_1039"></span>[5](#fn_1040.md) we are plunged into oblivion.

4\. More moderate are they who claim that the

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

simultaneous motion of the universe is thus called \[*sc. Sarapis*\],
from *seuesthai* and *sousthai* <span id="fr_1040"></span>[1](#fn_1041.md)
\[“speed”\].

5\. But the majority of the priests say that “Osiris” and “Apis” have
been woven together into the same \[name\], explaining and teaching that
we should look on the Apis as an en-formed image of the soul of Osiris.

6\. If, however, the name of Sarapis is Egyptian, I for my part think it
denotes “Good Cheer” and “Delight,”—finding a proof in the fact that
Egyptians call the feast “Delights”—*Sairei.*

And, indeed, Plato says that Hades has been so called as being
“sweet” <span id="fr_1041"></span>[2](#fn_1042.md) and gentle to those with
him.

7\. And with Egyptians both many other of their names are *logoi,* <span
id="fr_1042"></span>[3](#fn_1043.md) and they call subterrene space, to
which they think the souls depart after death, Amenthē—the name
signifying “the \[space\] which takes and gives.” <span
id="fr_1043"></span>[4](#fn_1044.md)

8\. But whether this, too, is one of the names that left Hellas long ago
and have been brought back again, <span
id="fr_1044"></span>[5](#fn_1045.md) we will examine later on; for the
present, let us continue with the remaining \[points\] of the belief we
have in hand.

<span id="fn_1033"></span>[302:2](th129.htm#fr_1032.md) Sar-apis—a

Eg. Ȧsȧr-Hapi.

<span id="fn_1034"></span>[302:3](th129.htm#fr_1033.md) Presumably from
that of a daimon to that of a god.

<span id="fn_1035"></span>[302:4](th129.htm#fr_1034.md) That is,
apparently, a common principle in all men.

<span id="fn_1036"></span>[303:1](th129.htm#fr_1035.md) Lit. “Bright- (or
Glad-) eyed.”

<span id="fn_1037"></span>[303:2](th129.htm#fr_1036.md) Lit., “Wailer.”

<span id="fn_1040"></span>[303:5](th129.htm#fr_1039.md) ἠχοῦντος . . .
χαλκώματος. This has, nevertheless, presumably some mystic meaning. In
the myths, cymbals were said to have been used to protect the infant
Bacchus, and infant Zeus, and to keep off the Titans—so, presumably,
plunging them into oblivion. Compare also 1 Corinth. xiii. 1, where
Paul, speaking of the exercise of the “gift of tongues” (*glossalaly*)
without love (ἀγάπη), uses precisely the same term, when saying: “I am
become as sounding brass (χαλκὸς ἠχῶν) or tinkling cymbal” the latter
being, perhaps, a reference to the *sistrum,* while the former is
perhaps a metaphor, derived from the hardness and colour (“red”) of
brass, or rather bronze or copper, referring to a state of mind which
plunges us into oblivion of our better part—namely, spiritual love.

<span id="fn_1041"></span>[304:1](th129.htm#fr_1040.md) A contracted form
of the former—from √σϝε or √σεϝ, with idea of “swiftness.” (?)
*Serapis—sev-a-this—sevesthai*.

<span id="fn_1042"></span>[304:2](th129.htm#fr_1041.md) ἁδούσιον—unknown to
the lexicons. I suggest that it may be connected with ἦδος, from √σϝαδ
of ἁνδάνω—hence “sweet.”

<span id="fn_1043"></span>[304:3](th129.htm#fr_1042.md) Presumably “words
of deep meaning”—another technical use of this Proteus-like term.

<span id="fn_1044"></span>[304:4](th129.htm#fr_1043.md) Budge (*op. cit.,*
ii. 200) says: “The Egyptian form of the word is Amentet, and the name
means ‘hidden place.’”

<span id="fn_1045"></span>[304:5](th129.htm#fr_1044.md) How very Greek!
*Cf.* lxi. 4.
