### IX

#### PLUTARCH: CONCERNING THE MYSTERIES OF ISIS AND OSIRIS

##### FOREWORD

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the chapter on Philo we attempted to
set before the reader some outlines of the central doctrine of
Hellenistic theology—the sublime concept of the Logos—as envisaged by a
learned Jew of the Diaspora, steeped in Hellenism, and living in the
capital of Egypt and the centre of the intellectual life of Greater
Greece.

In the present chapter we shall endeavour to give the reader a further
insight into this master-idea from another standpoint, and shall
reproduce the views of a learned Greek, who, while remaining on the
ground of Hellenic traditions proper, turns his eyes to Egypt, and reads
what part of its mysterious message he can decipher, in Greek modes of
thought.

Plutarch, of Chæroneia in Bœotia, nourished in the second half of the
first century A.D., and so follows immediately on Philo and on Paul;
like Philo, however, he knows nothing of the Christians, though like the
Alexandrian he treats of precisely those problems and questions which
were and are of pre-eminent interest for Christians.

Plutarch chooses as his theme the myth and mysteries of Osiris and Isis.
He gives the myth in its main outlines, and introduces us into the
general religious

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

atmosphere of the Egyptian belief of what we may, perhaps, be allowed to
call “Demotic” times. But he does far more than this. Initiated himself
into the Osiriaca, of which there was apparently a *thiasos* at Delphi,
though on the one hand he possesses more knowledge of formal details
than he feels himself permitted to disclose, on the other hand he is
aware that the “true initiate of Isis” is one who goes far beyond any
formal reception of the symbolic mysteries; the true initiate must of
his own initiative for ever keep searching and probing more deeply into
the intimate reason of things, as adumbrated by the “things said and
done” in the sacred rites (iii. 3).

For this task Plutarch is well equipped, not only by his wide knowledge
of the philosophy and theology and science of his day, but also by the
fact that he held a high office at Delphi in the service of Apollo and
also in connection with the Dionysiac rites. He was almost certainly a
hierophant, and no merely formal one at that.

Plutarch accordingly gives a most instructive exposition, which should
enable us, if only we are content to put ourselves in his place, and
condescend to think in the terms of the thought of his day, to review
the ancient struggle between physical reason and formal theology which
was then in full conflict—a conflict that has been renewed on a vastly
extended scale for the last few centuries, and which is still being
fought to a finish or honourable truce in our own day.

Our initiated philosopher is on the side neither of atheism or pure
physicism, nor on that of superstition, as he understood those terms in
his day; he takes a middle ground, and seeks final refuge in the fair
vision of the Logos; and that, too, in all humility, for he knows well
that whatever he can say is at best but a

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

dim reflection of the glory of the Highest, as indeed he expressly tells
us when writing:

“Nor can the souls of men here on the earth, swathed as they are in
bodies and enwrapped in passions, commune with God, except so far as
they can reach some dun sort of a dream of Him with the perception of a
mind trained in philosophy” (lxxiii. 2).

We accordingly find Plutarch discussing the various theories of his day
which professed to explain the mythological and theological enigmas of
the ancients, with special reference to the Osiris myth.

He discusses the theory of Evemerus, that the gods were nothing but
ancient kings and worthies, and dismisses it as no really satisfactory
explanation (xxiii.).

He then proceeds to consider the theory that these things refer to the
doings of daimones,—which he thinks a decided improvement on that of
Evemerus (xxv.).

Thence he passes to the theories of the Physicists or natural
phenomenalists (xxxii.), and of the Mathematici—that is to say, the
Pythagorean speculations as to the celestial spheres, and their
harmonies (xli.).

In each of these three latter theories he thinks there is some truth;
still each by itself is insufficient; they must be combined (xlv.), and
even then it is not enough.

He next considers the question of first principles, and discusses the
theories of the One, the Two, and the Many; again finding something to
be said for each view, and yet adopting none of them as all-sufficient.

But of all attempted interpretations he finds the least satisfactory to
be that of those who are content to limit the hermeneutics of the
mystery-myths simply to the operations of ploughing and sowing. With
this “vegetation god” theory he has little patience, and stigmatises its
professors as that “dull crowd” (lxv.).

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And here, perhaps,
some of us may think that Plutarch is not out of date even in the
twentieth century of grace, and his arguments might be recommended to
the consideration of those anthropologists who are just now with such
complacency running to death what Mr Andrew Lang humourously calls the
“Covent Garden” theory.

Further on, dealing as he does with the puzzling question of Egyptian
“animal worship,” Plutarch is brought face to face with many problems of
“taboo” and “totemism,” and he is not without interest in what he says
on these subjects (lxxii. f.), and in the theories of utilitarianism and
symbolism which he adduces (lxxiv.).

Finally, he gives us his view of the *rationale* of the custom of
incense-burning (lxxix.), which should be of some concern to many in
present-day Christian communities.

But the whole of this complex of custom and rites, puzzling and
self-contradictory as they may appear, and the whole of the riddles and
veiled enigmas of Egyptian priestly tradition, are, Plutarch believes,
resolvable into transparent simplicity by a proper understanding of the
true nature of man and of his relation to Divine Nature, that Wisdom who
is the eternal and inseparable spouse of Divine Reason, the Logos.

It would perhaps have been simpler for some of my readers—it certainly
would have been shorter—had I condensed what Plutarch has to say; but my
desire is rather to let this student of the comparative theology of his
day speak for himself, and not to give my own views; for I still
believe, in spite of the superior formal education of the twentieth
century, that we cannot normally know more about the ancient

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

mysteries and their inner purport than the best minds who were initiated
into them while they still flourished.

For not only are we without the precise data which these ancients
possessed, but also the phase of thought through which we have recently
been passing, and in which we mostly still are, is not one which can
sympathetically tolerate those very considerations which, in my opinion,
provide the most fertile ground of explanation of the true inwardness of
what was best in those mystery-traditions.

Moreover, I have thought it of service to give a full version of this
treatise of Plutarch’s from a decent critical text, <span
id="fr_777"></span>[1](#fn_778.md) for the only translation in English read
by me is by no means a careful piece of work, <span
id="fr_778"></span>[2](#fn_779.md) and manifestly rendered from a very
imperfect text; also, the language of Plutarch in some passages appears
to me to be deserving of more careful handling than has as yet been
accorded it, for a number of sentences seem to have been purposely
phrased so as to be capable of conveying a double meaning.

Finally, with regard to his own interpretation, I would suggest that
Plutarch, as was natural to a Greek, has more insisted on intellectual
modes of thought than perhaps an Egyptian priest would have been
inclined to do; for it seems probable that to the Egyptian mind the
chief interest would lie in the possibility of the realisation of
immediate contact with the Mystery in all those modes which are not so
much intellectual as

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

sensible; in other words, it would be by making himself a vehicle of the
Great Breath in his body rather than a mirror of the Mystery in his
mind, that the son of the Nile Land would seek for union.

It is, moreover, of interest to find that Plutarch addresses his
treatise to a lady. For though we have extant several moral tractates
addressed to wives—such as Porphyry’s *Letter* to Marcella, and
Plutarch’s *Consolation* to his own wife, Timoxena—it is rare to find
philosophical treatises addressed to women, and nowadays many women are
once more interested in such “philosophy.”

Plutarch wrote his essay at Delphi (lxviii. 6), and addressed it to
Klea, a lady who held a distinguished position among the Delphic
priestesses, and who had herself been initiated into the Osiriac
Mysteries—her very name Klea being, perhaps, her mystery-name (xxxv.).
The treatise is, therefore, addressed to one who was prepared to read
into it more than appears on the surface.

It should also be remembered that in all probability the main source of
Plutarch’s information was the now lost treatise of Manetho on the
Egyptian Religion, and in this connection it is of interest to record
Granger’s opinion, who, in referring to Plutarch’s *De Iside et
Osiride,* says:

“First he deals with those opinions which identify the Egyptian gods
with natural objects—Osiris with the Nile, Isis with the land, and so
on. Then he considers the interpretations of those who identify the gods
with the sun and moon, etc. (ch. lxi.). These speculations summarise for
us, at first or second hand, some of the Hermetic books current in
Plutarch’s time.” <span id="fr_779"></span>[1](#fn_780.md)
