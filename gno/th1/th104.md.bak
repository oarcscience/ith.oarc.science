### I

#### THE REMAINS OF THE TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

##### WRITER AND READER

<span class="smallcaps">Little</span> did I think when, years ago, I
began to translate some of the Trismegistic tractates, that the
undertaking would finally grow into these volumes. My sole object then
was to render the more important of these beautiful theosophic treatises
into an English that might, perhaps, be thought in some small way worthy
of the Greek originals. I was then more attracted by the sermons
themselves than by the manifold problems to which they gave rise; I
found greater pleasure in the spiritual atmosphere they created, than in
the critical considerations which insistently imposed themselves upon my
mind, as I strove to realise their importance for the history of the
development of religious ideas in the Western world.

And now, too, when I take pen in hand to grapple with the difficulties
of “introduction” for those who will be good enough to follow my
all-insufficient labours, it is to the tractates themselves that I turn
again and again for refreshment in the task; and every time I turn to
them I am persuaded that the best of them are worthy of all the labour a
man can bestow upon them.

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

Though it is true that the form of these volumes, with their Prolegomena
and Commentaries and numerous notes, is that of a technical treatise, it
has nevertheless been my aim to make them throughout accessible to the
general reader, even to the man of one language who, though no scholar
himself, may yet be deeply interested in such studies. These volumes
must, therefore, naturally fall short of the precision enjoyed by the
works of technical specialists which are filled with direct quotations
from a number of ancient and modern tongues; on the other hand, they
have the advantage of appealing to a larger public, while at the same
time the specialist is given every indication for controlling the
statements and translations.

Nor should the general reader be deterred by an introductory volume
under the imposing sub-title of Prolegomena, imagining that these
chapters are necessarily of a dull, critical nature, for the subjects
dealt with are of immense interest in themselves (at least they seem so
to me), and are supplementary to the Trismegistic sermons, frequently
adding material of a like nature to that in our tractates.

Some of these Prolegomena have grown out of the Commentaries, for I
found that occasionally subjects lent themselves to such lengthy
digressions that they could be removed to the Prolegomena to the great
advantage of the Commentary. The arrangement of the material thus
accumulated, however, has proved a very difficult task, and I have been
able to preserve but little logical sequence in the chapters; but this
is owing mainly to the fact that the extant Trismegistic literature
itself is preserved to us in a most chaotic fashion, and I as yet see no
means of inducing any sure order into this chaos.

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

##### THE EXTANT TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

To distinguish our writings both from the Egyptian “Books of Thoth” and
the Hermes Prayers of the popular Egyptian cult, as found in the Greek
Magic Papyri, and also from the later Hermetic Alchemical literature, I
have adopted the term Trismegistic literature in place of the usual
designation Hermetic.

Of this Greek Trismegistic literature proper, much is lost; that which
remains to us, of which I have endeavoured to gather together every
fragment and scrap, falls under five heads:

> A. The Corpus Hermeticum.  
> B. The Perfect Sermon, or the Asclepius.  
> C. Excerpts by Stobæus.  
> D. References and Fragments in the Fathers.  
> E. References and Fragments in the Philosophers.

A. The Corpus Hermeticum includes what has, previous to
Reitzenstein, <span id="fr_1"></span>[1](#fn_1.md) been known as the
“Poimandres” <span id="fr_2"></span>[2](#fn_2.md) collection of fourteen
Sermons and the “Definitions of Asclepius.”

B. The Perfect Sermon, or the Asclepius, is no longer extant in Greek,
but only in an Old Latin version.

C. There are twenty-seven Excerpts, from otherwise lost Sermons, by John
Stobæus, a Pagan scholar of the

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

end of the fifth or beginning of the sixth century, who was an immense
reader and made a most valuable collection of extracts from Greek
authors, though studiously avoiding every Christian writer. Some of
these Excerpts are of great length, especially those from the Sermon
entitled “The Virgin of the World”; these twenty-seven Excerpts are
exclusive of extracts from Sermons still preserved in our Corpus.

D. From the Church Fathers we obtain many references and twenty-five
short Fragments, otherwise unknown to us, and considerably widening our
acquaintance with the scope of the literature.

E. From Zosimus and Fulgentius we obtain three Fragments, and from the
former and Iamblichus, and Julian the Emperor-Philosopher, we obtain a
number of valuable references.

Such are what at first sight may appear to be the comparatively scanty
remains of what was once an exceedingly abundant literature. But when we
remember that this literature was largely reserved and kept secret, we
cannot but congratulate ourselves that so much has been preserved;
indeed, as we shall see later on, but for the lucky chance of a Hermetic
apologist selecting some of the sermons to exemplify the loyal nature of
the Trismegistic teaching with respect to kings and rulers, we should be
without any Hermetic Corpus at all, and dependent solely on our extracts
and fragments.

But even with our Hermetic Corpus before us we should never forget that
we have only a fraction of the Trismegistic literature—the flotsam and
jetsam, so to say, of a once most noble vessel that sailed the seas of
human endeavour, and was an ark of refuge to many a pious and cultured
soul.

References to lost writings of the School will meet

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

us abundantly in the course of our studies, and some attempt will be
made later on to form a notion of the main types of the literature.

As for the rest of the so-called Hermetic works, medico-mathematical,
astrological and medico-astrological, and alchemical, and for a list of
the many inventions attributed to the Thrice-greatest—inventions as
numerous as, and almost identical with, those attributed to Orpheus by
fond posterity along the line of “pure” Hellenic tradition—I would refer
the student to the *Bibliotheca Græca* of Joannes Albertus
Fabricius. <span id="fr_3"></span>[1](#fn_3.md)

For the Alchemical and Mediæval literature the two magnificent works of
Berthelot (M. P. E.) are indispensable—namely, *Collection des anciens
Alchimistes grecs* (Paris, 1888), and *La Chimie au Moyen Âge* (Paris,
1893).

In close connection with the development of this form of “Hermetic”
tradition must be taken the Hermes writings and traditions among the
Arabs. See Beausobre’s *Histoire Critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme*
(Amsterdam, 1734), i. 326; also Fleischer (H. L.), *Hermes Trismegislus
an die menschliche Seele, Arabisch und Deutsch* (Leipzig, 1870);
Bardenhewer (O.), *Hermetis Trismegisti qui apud Arabes fertur de
Castigatione Animæ Liber* (Bonn, 1873); and especially R. Pietschmann,
the pupil of Georg Ebers, who devotes the fourth part of his treatise,
entitled *Hermes Trismegistus nach ägyptischen und orientalischen
Überlieferungen* (Leipzig, 1875), to a consideration of the Hermes
tradition, “Bei Syrern und Araben.”

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

Reitzenstein treats very briefly of the development of this later
Hermetic literature on pp. 188-200 of his *Poimandres*. <span
id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)

##### THE ORIGINAL MS. OF OUR CORPUS

From the fragmentary nature of the remains of the Trismegistic
literature that have come down to us, it will be at once seen that a
critical text of them is a complicated undertaking; for, apart from the
Corpus, the texts have to be collected from the works of many authors.
This, however, has never yet been done in any critical fashion; so that
a translator has first of all to find the best existing critical texts
of these authors from which to make his version. This, I hope, I have
succeeded in doing; but even so, numerous obscurities still remain in
the texts of the excerpts, fragments, and quotations, and it is highly
desirable that some scholar specially acquainted with our literature
should collect all these together in one volume, and work over the
labours of specialists on the texts of Stobæus and the Fathers, with the
added equipment of his own special knowledge.

Even the text of our Corpus is still without a thoroughly critical
edition; for though Reitzenstein has done this work most admirably for
*C. H.,* i., xiii. (xiv.), and (xvi.)-(xviii.), basing himself on five
MSS. and the printed texts of the earlier editions, he has not thought
fit to give us a complete text.

A list of the then known MSS. is given in Harles’ edition of Fabricius’
*Bibliotheca Græca* (pp. 51, 52); while Parthey gives notes on the only
two MSS. he used in his edition of fourteen of the Sermons of

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

our Corpus. It is, however, generally believed that there may be other
MSS. hidden away in Continental libraries.

All prior work on the MSS., however, is entirely superseded by
Reitzenstein in his illuminating “History of the Text” (pp. 319-327), in
which we have the whole matter set forth with the thoroughness that
characterises the best German scholarship.

From him we learn that we owe the preservation of our Hermetic Corpus to
a single MS. that was found in the eleventh century in a sad condition.
Whole quires and single leaves were missing, both at the beginning
(after ch. i.) and the end (after ch. xvi.); even in the remaining
pages, especially in the last third, the writing was in a number of
places no longer legible.

In this condition the MS. came into the hands of Michael Psellus, the
great reviver of Platonic studies at Byzantium, probably at the time
when his orthodoxy was being called into question. Psellus thought he
would put these writings into circulation again, but at the same time
guard himself against the suspicion that their contents corresponded
with his own conclusions. This accounts for the peculiar scholion to *C.
H.,* i. 18, which seems at first pure monkish denunciation of Pœmandres
as the Devil in disguise to lead men from the truth, while the
conclusion of it betrays so deep an interest in the contents that it
must have been more than purely philological.

And that such an interest was aroused in the following centuries at
Byzantium, may be concluded from the fact that the last three chapters,
which directly justify polytheism or rather Heathendom, were omitted in
a portion of the MSS., and only that part of the Corpus received a wider
circulation which corresponded

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

with what might be regarded at first sight as a Neoplatonism assimilated
to Christianity. The text was reproduced with thoughtless exactitude, so
that though its tradition is extraordinarily bad, it is uniform, and we
can recover with certainty the copy of Psellus from the texts of the
fourteenth century.

These Trismegistic Sermons obtained a larger field of operation with the
growth of Humanism in the West. Georgius Gemistus Pletho, in the latter
part of the fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth century, brought
Neoplatonism from Byzantium into Italy as a kind of religion and made a
deep impression on Cosimo Medici; and Marsiglio Ficino, who was early
selected by the latter as the head of the future Academy, must have made
his Latin translation of our Corpus, which appeared in 1463, to serve as
the first groundwork of this undertaking. Cosimo had the Greek text
brought from Bulgaria (Macedonia) by a monk, Fra Lionardo of Pistoja,
and it is still in the Medicean Library.

It was not, however, till the middle of the sixteenth century that the
Greek text was printed; and meantime, with the great interest taken in
these writings by the Humanists, a large number of MSS. arose which
sought to make the text more understandable or more elegant; such MSS.
are of no value for the tradition of the text.

##### TEXTS AND TRANSLATIONS

We will now proceed to give some account of the texts and translations
of the Trismegistic writings, a bibliographical labour which the general
reader will most probably skip, but which the real student will
appreciate at its proper value. <span id="fr_5"></span>[1](#fn_5.md)

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

The best account of the texts and translations up to 1790 is that of
Harles, who has entirely rewritten the account of Fabricius (*op. cit.,*
pp. 52 ff.). <span id="fr_6"></span>[1](#fn_6.md)

The *editio princeps* was not a text but a Latin translation by
Marsiglio Ficino (Marsilius Ficinus), published in quarto in 1471. <span
id="fr_7"></span>[2](#fn_7.md) Both the name of the publisher and place of
publication are lacking, but the British Museum catalogue inserts them
in parenthesis as “G. de Lisa, Treviso,” presumably on the authority of
Harles. This translation consisted of the so-called “Pœmandres,” in
fourteen chapters, that is to say fourteen treatises, under the general
title, *Mercurii Trismegisti Liber de Potestate et Sapientia Dei* (or
*The Book of Mercury Trismegist concerning the Power and Wisdom of
God*). The enormous popularity of this work is seen by the fact of the
very numerous editions (for a book of that time) through which it ran.
No less than twenty-two editions have appeared, the first eight of them
in the short space of a quarter of a century. <span
id="fr_8"></span>[3](#fn_8.md)

In 1548 there appeared an Italian translation of Ficinus’ Latin version
of the “Pœmandres” collection, entitled *Il Pimandro di Mercurio
Trismegisto,* done into Florentine by Tommaso Benci, printed at Florence
in 12mo. A second edition was printed at Florence in 1549 in 8vo, with
numerous improvements by Paitoni.

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

The first Greek text was printed at Paris, in 1554, by Adr. Turnebus; it
included the “Pœmandres” and “The Definitions of Asclepius,” to which
the Latin version of Ficino was appended. The title is, *Mercurii
Trismegisti Pœmander seu de Potestate ac Sapientia Divina: Aesculapii
Definitiones ad Ammonem Regem;* the Greek was edited by P. Angelo da
Barga (Angelus Vergecius).

In 1557 appeared the first French translation by Gabriel du Preau, at
Paris, with a lengthy title, *Deux Livres de Mercure Trismegiste Hermés
tres ancien Theologien, et excellant Philozophe. L’un de la puissance et
sapience de Dieu. L’autre de la volonte de Dieu. Auecq’un Dialogue de
Loys Lazarel, poete Chrestien, intitulé le Bassin d’Hermés*.

This seems to be simply a translation of an edition of Ficinus’ Latin
version published at Paris by Henr. Stephanus in 1505, to which a
certain worthy, Loys Lazarel, who further rejoiced in the agnomen of
Septempedanus, appended a lucubration of his own of absolutely no
value, <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9.md) for the title of Estienne’s
edition runs: *Pimander Mercurii Liber de Sapientia et Potestate Dei.
Asclepius, ejusdem Mercurii Liber de Voluntate Divina. Item Crater
Hermetis a Lazarelo Septempedano.*

In 1574 Franciscus Flussas Candalle reprinted at Bourdeaux, in 4to,
Turnebus’ Greek text, which he emended, with the help of the younger
Scaliger and other Humanists, together with a Latin translation, under
the title, *Mercurii Trismegisti Pimander sive Pœmander.* This text is
still of critical service to-day.

This he followed with a French translation, printed in 1579, also at
Bourdeaux in folio, and bearing the title, *Le Pimandre de Mercure
Trismegiste de la Philosophie*

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> *Chrestienne,
Cognoissance du Verb Divin, et de l’Excellence des Œuvres de Dieu.* This
we are assured is translated “*de l’exemplaire Grec, avec collation de
très-amples commentaires,*” <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md) all of
which is followed by the full name and titles of Flussas, to wit,
“François Monsieur de Foix, de la famille de Candalle, Captal de Buchs,
etc., Evesque d’Ayre, etc.,” the whole being dedicated to “Marguerite de
France, Roine de Navarre.”

Twelve years later Franciscus Patricius (Cardinal Francesco Patrizzi)
printed an edition of the text of the Sermons of the Corpus, of “The
Asclepius,” and also of most of the Extracts and of some of the
Fragments; he, however, has arranged them all in a quite arbitrary
fashion, and has as arbitrarily altered the text, which generally
followed that of Turnebus and Candalle, in innumerable places. To this
he appended a Latin translation, in which he emended the versions of
Ficino and de Foix, as he tells us, in no less than 1040 places. These
were included in his *Nova de Universis Philosophia,* printed at
Ferrara, in folio, 1591, and again at Venice by R. Meiettus, in 1593, as
an appendix to his *Nov. de Un. Phil.,* now increased to fifty books.

This Latin translation of Patrizzi was printed apart, together with the
*Chaldæan Oracles,* at Hamburg in 12mo, also, in 1593, under the title
*Magia Philosophica.* The latter edition bears the subscription on the
title-page, “*jam nunc primum ex Biblioteca Ranzoviana è tenebris
eruta,*” which Harles explains as a reprint by plain Henr. Ranzou, who
is, however, described in the volume itself as “*produx.*” It seems to
have been again reprinted at Hamburg in 1594 in 8vo.

Meantime the Carmelite, Hannibal Rossellus, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[2](#fn_11.md) had

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

been laboriously engaged for many years on an edition of the “Pœmandres”
with most elaborate commentaries. This was printed at Cracow by Lazarus,
in six volumes in folio, from 1585 to 1590. Rossel treats of philosophy,
theology, the Pope, the scriptures, and all disciplines in his
*immanibus commentariis, inepte* as some say, while others bestow on him
great praise. His title is *Pymander Mercurii Trismegisti.* This was
reprinted with the text and translation of de Foix in folio at Cologne
in 1630, under the title *Divinus Pimander Hermetis Mercurii
Trismegisti.*

Hitherto nothing had been done in England, but in 1611 an edition of
Ficinus’ translation was printed in London. This was followed by what
purports to be a translation of the “Pœmandres” from Arabic, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) “by that learned Divine, Doctor Everard,”
as the title-page sets forth. It was printed in London in 1650 in 8vo,
with a preface by “J. F.,” and bears the title *The Divine Pymander of
Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus, in xvii. Books. Translated formerly out
of the Arabick into Greek* \[!\] *and thence into Latin, and Dutch, and
now out of the Original into English.* There was a second edition of
Everard’s version printed at London in 1657, in 12mo. There are also
reprints of the 1650 edition by Fryar of Bath, with an introduction by
Hargrave Jennings, in 1884; <span id="fr_13"></span>[2](#fn_13.md) by P. B.
Randolph, Toledo, Ohio, 1889; and by the Theosophical Publishing
Society, in the *Collectanea Hermetica,* edited by W. Wynn Westcott, in
1893.

To what Dutch translation Everard refers I cannot discover, for the only
one known to me is that printed

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

at Amsterdam in 1652 in 12mo. It is a translation of Patrizzi’s text,
and bears the title, *Sestien Boecken van den Hermes Trismegistus. . . .
uyt het Griecx ghebracht . . . met eene . . . Voorede uyt het Latijn von
F. Patricius in de welcke hij bewijst dat desen . . . Philosoph heeft
gebleoyt voor Moyses,* etc. Harles says nothing of this edition, but
speaks of one printed at Amsterdam in 1643 in 4to, by Nicholas van
Rauenstein, but I can find no other trace of it.

The first German translation was by a certain Alethophilus, and was
printed at Hamburg in 1706 (8vo) under the title *Hermetis Trismegisti
Erkäntnüss der Natur,* etc., containing seventeen pieces; this was
reprinted at Stuttgart in 1855, in a curious collection by J. Schieble,
entitled *Kleiner Wunder-Schauplatz*. <span
id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md) The title reads *Hermetis Trismegisti
Einleitung in’s höchste Wissen von Erkentniss der Natur und der darin
sich offenbarenden grossen Grottes,* with an appendix concerning the
person of Hermes, etc.

But why Schieble should have reprinted Alethophilus’ translation is not
clear, when in 1781 a new translation into German, with critical notes
and valuable suggestions for emending the text, had appeared by
Dieterich Tiedemann (Berlin and Stettin, in 8vo), entitled *Hermes
Trismegists Pœmander, oder von der göttlichen Macht und Weisheit,* a
rare book which, already in 1827, Baumgarten-Crusius <span
id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md) laments

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

as almost unfindable in the republic of letters, and of which the
British Museum possesses no copy. <span id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)

It is remarkable that of a work which exhausted so many editions in
translation and was evidently received with such great enthusiasm, there
have been so few editions of the text, and that for two centuries and a
quarter <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md) no attempt was made to
collate the different MSS. and editions, until in 1854 Gustav Parthey
printed a critical text of the fourteen pieces of “Pœmandres,” at
Berlin, under the title *Hermetis Trismegisti Pœmander,* to which he
appended a Latin translation based on the original version of Ficino
successively revised by de Foix and Patrizzi. Parthey’s promise to edit
*reliqua Hermetis scripta* has not been fulfilled, and no one else has
so far attempted this most necessary task.

Reitzenstein’s (p. 322) opinion of Parthey’s text, however, is very
unfavourable. In the first place, Parthey took Patrizzi’s arbitrary
alterations as a true tradition of the text; in the second, he himself
saw neither of the MSS. on which he says he relies. The first of these
was very carelessly copied for him and carelessly used by him; while the
second, which was copied by D. Hamm, is very corrupt owing to very
numerous “corrections” and interpolations by a later hand—all of which
Parthey has adopted as ancient readings. His text, therefore, concludes
Reitzenstein, is doubly falsified—a very discouraging judgment for
lovers of accuracy.

In 1866 there appeared at Paris, in 8vo, a complete translation in
French of the Trismegistic treatises and

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

fragments by Louis Ménard, entitled *Hermès Trismégiste,* preceded by an
interesting study on the origin of the Hermetic books, of which a second
edition was printed in 1867. This is beyond question the most
sympathetic version that we at present possess.

Everard’s version of the “Pœmandres” being reprinted in 1884 by Fryar of
Bath, the rest of the treatises were retranslated by Anna Kingsford and
Edward Maitland from Ménard’s French version (including his notes), and
appeared in 1885 (in 4to), published by Fryar, but bearing a publisher’s
name in India, under the general title *The Hermetic Works: The Virgin
of the World of Hermes Mercurius Trismegistus*. Meantime, in 1882, J. D.
Chambers had published (at Edinburgh, in 8vo) a crabbed and slavishly
literal translation of the “Pœmandres,” together with the Excerpts from
Stobæus and the Notices of Hermes in the Fathers, with an introductory
Preface, under the title, *The Theological and Philosophical Works of
Hermes Trismegistus, Christian Neoplatonist*. Indeed, the loose and
erroneous version of Everard is far more comprehensible than this
fantastically literal translation.

For the last six years I have myself been publishing, in the pages of
*The Theosophical Review,* translations of the Trismegistic Sermons and
also a few of the studies now included in these Prolegomena; all of the
former, however, have been now carefully revised, and the latter have
for the most part been greatly enlarged and improved.

Finally, in 1904, E. Reitzenstein of Strassburg published at Leipzig his
illuminating study, *Poimandres,* in which he gives the critical text of
*C. H.,* i., xiii. (xiv.), (xvi.)-(xviii.), based on five MSS. and the
best early printed editions, with all that minute care, knowledge of
palæography, and enthusiasm for philology which

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

characterises the best textual-critical work of modern scholarship. Why,
however, Reitzenstein has not done the same good service for the whole
of the Corpus as he has done for the selected sermons, is a mystery. He
is the very man for the task, and the service he could render would be
highly appreciated by many.

So much, then, for the existing partial texts and translations of the
extant Trismegistic literature. Of the translations with which I am
acquainted, <span id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18) Everard’s (1650.md), the
favourite in England, because of its dignified English, is full of
errors, mistranslations, and obscurities; it is hopeless to try to
understand “Hermes” from this version. Chambers’s translation (1882,
from the text of Parthey) is so slavishly literal that it ceases to be
English in many places, in others goes wide of the sense, and, in
general, is exasperating. Ménard’s French translation (1866, also from
Parthey’s text) is elegant and sympathetic, but very free in many
places; in fact, not infrequently quite emancipated from the text. The
most literally accurate translation is Parthey’s Latin version (based on
the Latin translation of Ficino, as emended by Candalle and Patrizzi);
but even in such literal rendering he is at fault at times, while in
general no one can fully understand the Latin without the Greek. To
translate “Hermes” requires not only a good knowledge of Greek, but also
a knowledge of that Gnosis which he has not infrequently so admirably
handed on to us.

have lost record: 1471, ’72, ’81, ’83, ’91, ’93, ’94, ’97; 1503, ’05,
’16, ’22, ’32, ’49, ’52, ’54, ’61, ’70, ’76, ’77; 1611, ’41. They were
printed at Venice, Paris, Basle, Lyons, and London.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[10:1](th104.htm#fr_9.md) The writer has painfully
perused it, for, more fortunate than the British Museum, he possesses a
copy of this rare work.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[11:1](th104.htm#fr_10.md) These on perusal prove
of little value.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[11:2](th104.htm#fr_11.md) R. 322 calls him a
Minorite.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[12:1](th104.htm#fr_12.md) It is clear, however,
that Everard translated from Ficinus’ Latin version, and that the
“Arabick” is a myth.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[12:2](th104.htm#fr_13.md) Of which only 200 copies
were issued to subscribers, as though, forsooth, they were to come into
great “occult” secrets thereby.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[13:1](th104.htm#fr_14.md) Part of the full title
runs: *K. W.-S. d. Wissenschaften, Mysterien, Theosophie, göttlichen und
morgenländischen Magie, Naturkräfte, hermet. u. magnet. Phil., Kabbala,
u. and. höhern Kentnissen,* and much more in the same strain, but I have
no doubt the reader has already had enough of it. From 1855 to 1857
fourteen parts appeared, mostly taken up with German translations of
Hermes, of Agrippa’s *Philosophia Occulta* from the Latin, and of *The
Telescope of Zoroaster* from the French.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[13:2](th104.htm#fr_15.md) *Op. inf. cit*., p. 10.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[14:1](th104.htm#fr_16.md) I have, therefore, not
been able to avail myself of Tiedemann’s labours. R. 322 speaks highly
of them.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[14:2](th104.htm#fr_17.md) The last edition prior
to Parthey’s was the reprint of Flussas’ text, at Cologne in 1630,
appended to Rossel’s lucubrations.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[16:1](th104.htm#fr_18.md) As already remarked, I
have not been able to see a copy of the German of Tiedemann.
