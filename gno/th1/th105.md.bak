#### THE HISTORY OF THE EVOLUTION OF OPINION

##### THE CHIEF POINTS OF INTERROGATION

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have now to consider the following
interesting points:

The early Church Fathers in general accepted the Trismegistic writings
as exceedingly ancient and authoritative, and in their apologetic
writings quote them in support of the main general positions of
Christianity.

In the revival of learning, for upwards of a century and a half, all the
Humanists welcomed them with open arms as a most valuable adjunct to
Christianity, and as being in accord with its doctrines; so much so that
they laboured to substitute Trismegistus for Aristotle in the schools.

During the last two centuries and a half, however, a body of opinion was
gradually evolved, infinitesimal in its beginnings but finally well-nigh
shutting out every other view, that these writings were Neoplatonic
forgeries and plagiarisms of Christianity.

Finally, with the dawn of the twentieth century, the subject has been
rescued from the hands of opinion, and has begun to be established on
the firm ground of historical and critical research, opening up problems
of the greatest interest and importance for the history of Christian
origins and their connection with Hellenistic

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

theology and theosophy, and throwing a brilliant light on the
development of Gnosticism.

The first point will be brought out in detail in the volume in which a
translation of all the passages and references to Thrice-greatest Hermes
in the writings of the Church Fathers will be given; while the last will
be made abundantly apparent, we hope, in the general course of our
studies. The second and third points will now demand our immediate
attention, especially the third, for we have endeavoured with great
labour to become acquainted with all the “arguments” which have tended
to build up this opinion; and unless we have to change all our ideas as
to the time-frame of so-called Neoplatonism, we are entirely
unconvinced; for we find that it has been evolved from unsupported
assertions, and that not one single work exists which ventures in any
satisfactory fashion to argue the question (most writers merely
reasserting or echoing prior opinions), or in which the statements made
may not as easily prove the priority of the Trismegistic school to the
Neoplatonic as the reverse.

We will then proceed to give some account of this chaos of contradictory
opinions, picking out the most salient points.

##### THE OPINIONS OF THE HUMANISTS

That the early scholars of the revival of learning were all unanimously
delighted with the Trismegistic writings, is manifest from the
bibliography we have already given, and that they should follow the
judgment of the ancient Fathers in the matter is but natural to expect;
for them not only were the books prior to Christianity, but they were
ever assured that Hermes

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

had been a really existent personality, like any of the Biblical
worthies, such as Enoch and Noah (as was unquestionably believed in
those days), and further, that he was prior to, or a contemporary of,
Moses. <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

Thus in the *editio princeps* of Ficino we read: “Whoever thou art who
readest these things, whether grammarian, or rhetorician, or
philosopher, or theologian, know thou that I am Hermes the
Thrice-greatest, at whom wondered first the Egyptians and the other
nations, and subsequently the ancient Christian theologians, in utter
stupefaction at my doctrine rare of things divine.”

The opinion of Ficino, that the “writer” of the “Pœmandres” tractates
was one who had a knowledge both of Egyptian and Greek, is of interest
as being that of a man uncontaminated by the infinite doubts with which
the atmosphere of modern criticism is filled, and thus able to get a
clean contact with his subject.

Of the same mind were Loys Lazarel and du Preau, the first French
translator; while the Italian Cardinal Patrizzi appends to his labours
the following beautiful words (attributed by some to Chalcidius <span
id="fr_20"></span>[2](#fn_20).md), which he puts in the mouth of Hermes:

“Till now, my son, I, banished from my home, have lived expatriate in
exile. Now safe and sound I seek my home once more. And when but yet a
little while I shall have left thee, freed from these bonds of body, see
that thou dost not mourn me as one dead. For I return to that supreme
and happy state to which the universe’s citizens will come when in the
after-state.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For there the Only
God is supreme lord, and He will fill His citizens with wondrous joy,
compared to which the state down here which is regarded by the multitude
as life, should rather be called death.” <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

Patrizzi believed that Hermes was contemporary with Moses, basing
himself upon the opinion of Eusebius in his *Chronicum,* <span
id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md) and thought that it would be to the
greatest advantage of the Christian world, if such admirable and pious
philosophy as was contained in the Trismegistic writings were
substituted in the public schools for Aristotle, whom he regarded as
overflowing with impiety.

##### THE FIRST DOUBT

And that such opinions were the only ones as late as 1630, is evident
from the favour still shown to the voluminous commentaries of de Foix
and Rossel. Nevertheless some fifty years previously, a hardy pioneer of
scepticism had sturdily attacked the validity of the then universal
Hermes tradition on one point at least—and that a fundamental one. For
Patrizzi (p. 1*a*) declares that a certain Jo. Goropius Becanus was the
first after so many centuries to dare to say that Hermes (as a single
individual) never existed! But the worthy Goropius, who appears to have
flourished about 1580, judging by an antiquarian treatise of his on the
race and language of the “Cimbri or Germani” published at Amsterdam, had
no followers as yet in a belief that is now universally accepted by all
critical scholarship. But this has to do with the Hermes-saga and not
directly with the question of the Trismegistic works,

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

and so we may omit for the present any reference to the host of
contradictory opinions on “Hermes” which are found in all the writers to
whom we are referring, and none of which, prior to the decipherment of
the hieroglyphics, are of any particular value.

##### THE LAUNCHING OF THE THEORY OF PLAGIARISM

It was about the middle of the seventeenth century that the theory of
plagiarism and forgery was started. Ursin (Joh. Henr. Ursinus), a pastor
of the Evangelical Church at Ratisbon, published at Nürnberg in 1661, a
work, in the second part of which he treated of “Hermes Trismegistus and
his Writings,” <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) and endeavoured to
show that they were wholesale plagiarisms from Christianity, but his
arguments were subjected to a severe criticism by Brucker some hundred
years later. <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md)

This extreme view of Ursin was subsequently modified into the subsidiary
opinions that the Trismegistic works were composed by a half-Christian
(*semi-christiano*) or interpolated by Christian overworking.

The most distinguished name among the early holders of the former
opinion is that of Isaac Casaubon, <span id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_25.md)
who dates these writings at the beginning of the second

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

century; Casaubon’s opinions, however, were promptly refuted by Cudworth
in his famous work *The True Intellectual System of the Universe,* the
first edition of which was printed at London, in folio, 1678. <span
id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) Cudworth would have it, however, that
Casaubon was right as far as the treatises entitled “The Shepherd of
Men” and “The Secret Sermon on the Mountain” are concerned, and that
these treatises were counterfeited by Christians since the time of
Iamblichus—a very curious position to assume, since a number of the
treatises themselves look back to this very “Shepherd” as the original
document of the whole “Pœmandres” cycle.

But, indeed, so far we have no arguments, no really critical
investigation, <span id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md) so that we need not
detain the reader among these warring opinions, on which the cap was set
by the violent outburst of Colberg in defence of orthodoxy against the
Alchemists, Rosicrucians, Quakers, Anabaptists, Quietists, etc., of
which *fanatici,* as he calls them, Hermes, he declares, was the
Patriarch. <span id="fr_28"></span>[3](#fn_28.md)

##### THE ONLY ARGUMENT ADDUCED

One might almost believe that Colberg was an incarnation of a Church
Father continuing his ancient polemic against heresy; in any case the
whole question of heresy

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

was now revived, and the eighteenth and nineteenth century criticism of
the Trismegistic works almost invariably starts with this prejudice in
mind and seeks (almost without exception) to father the Trismegistic
writings on Neoplatonism, which it regards as the most powerful opponent
of orthodoxy from the third century onwards. Harles (1790) gives the
references to all the main factors in the evolution of this opinion
during the eighteenth century; <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) but
the only argument that the century produced—indeed, the only argument
that has ever been adduced—is that the doctrines of the Trismegistic
writings are clearly Platonic, and that too of that type of mystical
Platonism which was especially the characteristic of the teaching of
Iamblichus at the end of the third century A.D., and which is generally
called Neoplatonism; *therefore,* these writings were forged by the
Neoplatonists to prop up dying Paganism against the ever more and more
vigorous Christianity. We admit the premisses, but we absolutely deny
the conclusion. But before pointing out the weakness of this conclusion
of apologetic scholarship, we must deal with the literature on the
subject in the last century. The eighteenth century produced no
arguments in support of this conclusion beyond the main premisses which
we have admitted. <span id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md) Has the nineteenth
century

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

produced any others so as to justify the position taken up by the echoes
of opinion in all the popular encyclopædias with regard to these most
valuable and beautiful treatises? <span id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md)

If our encyclopædias deign to rest their assertions on authority, they
refer us to Fabricius (Harles) and Baumgarten-Crusius. We have already
seen that Harles will not help us much; will the latter authority throw
any more light on the subject? We are afraid not; for, instead of a
bulky volume, we have before us a thin academical exercise of only 19
pp., <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) in which the author puts
forward the bare opinion that these books were invented by Porphyry and
his school, and this mainly because he thinks that Orelli <span
id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33.md) had proved the year before that the
Cosmogony of Sanchoniathon was invented by the “Platonici.” Moreover,
was not Porphyry an enemy of Christ, for did he not write XV. Books
against the Christians? All of which can scarcely be dignified with the
name of argument, far less with that of proof.

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

##### THE THEORY OF HILGERS

The same may be said of the short academical thesis of Hilgers, <span
id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34.md) who first shows the weakness of Möhler’s
strange opinion <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35.md) that the author was
a Christian who pretended to be a Pagan and inserted “errors” on
purpose. Hilgers finally ends up with the lame conclusion that Christian
doctrine was known to the author of the “Pœmandres” cycle, especially
the Gospel of “John” and Letters of Paul; but how it is possible to
conjecture anything besides, he does not know. Of the possibility of the
priority of the “Pœmandres” to the writings of “John” and Paul, Hilgers
does not seem to dream; nevertheless this is as logical a deduction as
the one he draws from the points of contact between the two groups of
literature. But Hilgers has got an axe of his own to grind, and a very
blunt one at that; he thinks that “The Shepherd of Men” was written at
the same time as “The Shepherd of Hermas,” that simple product of what
is called the sub-apostolic age—a document held in great respect by the
early outer communities of General Christianity, and used for purposes
of edification. Our “Shepherd,” Hilgers thinks, was written in
opposition to the Hermas document, but he can do nothing but point to
the similarity of name as a proof of his hypothesis. This topsyturvy
opinion we shall seek to reverse in a subsequent chapter on “‘Hermes’
and ‘Hermas.’”

As to the author of our “Shepherd,” Hilgers thinks he has shown that “he
was not a follower of the

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

doctrines of the Christ, but of the so-called Neoplatonists, and among
these especially of Philo Judæus”; in fact he seems, says Hilgers, to
have been a Therapeut. <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)

##### THE GERMAN THEORY OF NEOPLATONIC “SYNCRETISMUS”

Here we have the first appearance of another tendency; the more
attention is bestowed upon the Trismegistic writings, the more it is
apparent that they cannot be ascribed to Neoplatonism, if, as generally
held, Neoplatonism begins with Ammonius Saccas, Plotinus, and Porphyry
in the third century. Therefore, in this subject, and in this subject
alone, we find a tendency in later writers to push back the
Neoplatonists so as to include Philo Judæus, who flourished in the first
half of the first century! On these lines we should soon get
*Neo*-platonism back to Plato and Pythagoras, and so be forced to drop
the “Neo” and return to the old honoured name of simple “Platonici.”

But already by this time in Germany the theory of Neoplatonic
*Syncretismus* to prop up sinking Heathendom against rising Christianity
had become crystallised, as may be seen from the article on “Hermes,
Hermetische Schriften” in Pauly’s famous *Real Encyclopädie der
classischen Alterthumswissenshaft* (Stuttgart, 1844), where this
position is assumed from the start.

Parthey, however, in 1854, in his preface, ventures on no such opinion,
but expresses a belief that we may even yet discover in Egypt a demotic
text of the “Pœmandres,” which shows that he considered the original to
have been written in Egyptian, and therefore not by a Neoplatonist.

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

##### THE FRENCH THEORY OF EGYPTIAN ORIGIN

In France, moreover, the Egyptian paternity of the Trismegistic
writings, and that too on very sensible lines, was asserted about the
same time, namely, in 1858, by Artaud in his article on “Hermès
Trismégiste,” in Hoeffer’s *Nouvelle Biographie Générale,* published at
Paris by Messrs Firmin Didot. Artaud writes:

“In the mystic sense Thoth or the Egyptian Hermes was the symbol of the
Divine Mind; he was the incarnated Thought, the living Word—the
primitive type of the Logos of Plato and the Word of the
Christians. . . .

“We have heard Champollion, the younger, giving expression to the formal
opinion that the books of Hermes Trismegistus really contained the
ancient Egyptian doctrine of which traces can be discovered from the
hieroglyphics which cover the monuments of Egypt. Moreover, if these
fragments themselves are examined, we find in them a theology
sufficiently in accord with the doctrines set forth by Plato in his
*Timaeus*—doctrines which are entirely apart from those of the other
schools of Greece, and which were therefore held to have been derived by
Plato from the temples of Egypt, when he went thither to hold converse
with its priests.” <span id="fr_37"></span>[1](#fn_37.md)

Artaud is also of the opinion that these Trismegistic treatises are
translations from the Egyptian.

##### THE VIEWS OF MÉNARD

Nowadays, with our improved knowledge of Egyptology, this hypothesis has
to be stated in far more

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

careful terms before it can find acceptance among the learned;
nevertheless it was evidently the conviction of Dévéria, who in a work
of which he only succeeded in writing the first two pages, proposed to
comment on the entire text of the Trismegistic Books from the point of
view of an Egyptologist. For these Books, he declared, offered an almost
complete exposition of the esoteric philosophy of ancient Egypt. <span
id="fr_38"></span>[1](#fn_38.md)

But by far the most sympathetic and really intelligent account of the
subject is that of Ménard, <span id="fr_39"></span>[2](#fn_39.md) who gives
us a pleasant respite from the chorus of the German Neoplatonic
syncretism theory. And though we do not by any means agree with all that
he writes, it will be a relief to let in a breath of fresh air upon the
general stuffiness of our present summary of opinions.

The fragments of the Trismegistic literature which have reached us are
the sole surviving remains of that “Egyptian philosophy” which arose
from the congress of the religious doctrines of Egypt with the
philosophical doctrines of Greece. In other words, what the works of
Philo were to the sacred literature of the Jews, the Hermaica were to
the Egyptian sacred writings. Legend and myth were allegorised and
philosophised and replaced by vision and instruction. But who were the
authors of this theosophic method? This question is of the greatest
interest to us, for it is one of the factors in the solution of the
problem of the literary evolution of Christianity, seeing that there are
intimate points of contact of ideas between several of the Hermetic
documents and certain Jewish and Christian writings, especially the
opening verses of Genesis, the treatises of Philo, the fourth Gospel

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (especially the
Prologue), and beyond all the writings of the great Gnostic doctors
Basilides and Valentinus.

Such and similar considerations lead Ménard to glance at the environment
of infant Christianity and the various phenomena connected with its
growth, and this he does from the point of view of an enlightened
independent historical scholar.

“Christianity,” he writes, “did not fall like a thunderbolt into the
midst of a surprised and startled world. It had its period of
incubation, and while it was engaged in evolving the positive form of
its dogmas, the problems of which it was seeking the solution were the
subject of thought in Greece, Asia, and Egypt. Similar ideas were in the
air and shaped themselves into all sorts of propositions.

“The multiplicity of sects which have arisen in our own times under the
name of socialism, can give but a faint idea of the marvellous
intellectual chemistry which had established its principal laboratory at
Alexandria. Humanity had set in the arena mighty philosophical and moral
problems: the origin of evil, the destiny of the soul, its fall and
redemption; the prize to be given was the government of the conscience.
The Christian solution <span id="fr_40"></span>[1](#fn_40.md) won, and
caused the rest to be forgotten, sunk for the most part in the shipwreck
of the past. Let us then, when we come across a scrap of the flotsam and
jetsam, recognise in it the work of a beaten competitor and not of a
plagiarist. Indeed, the triumph of Christianity was prepared by those
very men who thought themselves its rivals, but who were only its
forerunners. The title suits them, though many were contemporaries of
the Christian era, while others were a little later; for the succession
of a religion only dates from the day when it is accepted by the

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

nations, just as the reign of a claimant to the throne dates from his
victory” (pp. ix., x.).

Ménard distinguishes three principal groups in the Trismegistic
treatises, which he assigns to Jewish, Greek, and Egyptian influences.
In them also he finds a link between Philo and the Gnostics.

“Between the first Gnostic sects and the Hellenic Jews represented by
Philo, a link is missing; this can be found in several of the Hermetic
works, especially ‘The Shepherd of Men’ and ‘The Sermon on the
Mountain.’ In them also will perhaps be found the reason of the
differences, so often remarked upon, between the first three Gospels and
the fourth” (p. xliv.).

Next, the direction in which that “link” is to be looked for is more
clearly shown, though here Ménard is, I think, too precise when writing:

“It seems certain that ‘The Shepherd’ came from that school of
Therapeuts of Egypt, who have been often erroneously confounded with the
Essenians of Syria and Palestine” (p. lvi).

But “instead of the physical discipline of the Essenians, who, according
to Philo, practised manual labour, put the product of their toil into
the common fund, and reduced philosophy to ethics, and ethics to
charity, the ‘monasteries’ of the Therapeuts contributed to Christian
propaganda a far more Hellenised population, trained in abstract
speculations and mystic allegories. From these tendencies, combined with
the dogma of the incarnation, arose the Gnostic sects. ‘The Shepherd’
should be earlier than these schools” (p. lviii.).

As to “The Sermon on the Mountain,” “it can be placed, in order of ideas
and date, between ‘The Shepherd’ and the first Gnostic schools; it
should be

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

a little earlier than the founders of Gnosticism, Basilides, and
Valentinus” (p. lxv.).

If Gnosticism be taken with Ménard to mean the Christianised theosophy
of Basilides and Valentinus from the first quarter of the second century
onwards, the oldest Trismegistic treatises are demonstrably earlier, for
their Gnosticism is plainly a far simpler form; in fact, so much more
simple that, if we could proceed on so crude an hypothesis as that of a
straight-lined evolution, we should be forced to find room for
intermediate forms of Gnosticism between them and the Basilidian and the
Valentinian Gnosis. And of this Ménard seems to be partly conscious when
writing: “We can follow in the Hermetic books the destiny of this
Judæo-Egyptian Gnosis, which, during the first century, existed side by
side with Christianity without allowing itself to be absorbed by it,
passing insensibly from the Jewish school of Philo to the Greek school
of Plotinus” (p. lxvii.).

Ménard here used the term Christianity for that tendency which
afterwards was called Catholic or General Christianity, the body to
which these very same Gnostics gave the principal dogmas of its
subsequent theology.

But if the Gnostics were Therapeuts, and the Trismegistic writers
Therapeuts, why should Ménard call them Jews, as he appears to do in his
interesting question, “Where are the Jewish Therapeuts at the end of the
second century?” Certainly Philo laboured to give his readers the
impression that the Therapeuts were principally Jews, perhaps to win
respect for his compatriots in his apology for his nation; but the
Therapeuts were, evidently, on his own showing, drawn from all the
nations and scattered abroad in very numerous communities, though many
Jews were doubtless in

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

their ranks—indeed, Philo probably knew little about their communities
other than the Mareotic. If, then, the term “Therapeut” will explain
some of the phenomena presented by these writings, the combination
“Jewish Therapeuts” will certainly not do so. The very answer of Ménard
himself to his question shows that even these Mareotic Therapeuts could
not have been orthodox Jews, for the French scholar proceeds to surmise
not only that, “some, converted to Christianity, became monks or
Gnostics of the Basilidian or Valentinian school,” but that “others more
and more assimilated themselves to Paganism.”

And by “Paganism” our author says he does not mean “polytheism,” for “at
this period all admitted into the divine order of things a well-defined
hierarchy with a supreme God at the head; only for some this supreme
Deity was in the world, for others outside it” (p. lxxiv.).

Ménard’s introduction meets with the general approval of Reitzenstein
(p. 1), who characterises it as *feinsinnige,* and agrees that he has
rightly appreciated many of the factors, especially from the theological
side; he, however (p. 116, n. 2), dissents, and rightly dissents, from
Ménard as to any direct Jewish influence on the Trismegistic literature,
and refuses to admit that the “Pœmandres” can in any way be
characterised as a Jewish-Gnostic writing.

But the sensible views of Ménard were impotent to check the
crystallisation of the German theory, which was practically repeated by
Zeller, <span id="fr_41"></span>[1](#fn_41.md) and once more by

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pietschmann in his
learned essay, <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) based in part on A.
G. Hoffmann’s article “Hermes” in Ersch and Grüber’s *Allgemeine
Encyclopädie der Wissenschaften und Künste*. <span
id="fr_43"></span>[2](#fn_43.md)

An exception to this tendency, however, is to be found in the opinion of
Aall; <span id="fr_44"></span>[3](#fn_44.md) who, though he adduces no
proof, would on general grounds place the composition of the Hermetic
literature (though whether or not by this he means our extant
Trismegistic sermons is not clear) as far back as the second century
B.C., and would see in it an offshoot from the same stem which later on
supplied the ground-conceptions of the Johannine theology. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[4](#fn_45.md)

##### ENGLISH ENCYCLOPÆDISM

In England, as we have seen, the subject, like so many others of a
similar nature, has been almost entirely neglected, but with the
encyclopædic activity of the past generation we find it touched upon,
and in the usual encyclopædic fashion. The German position is assumed,
without one word of proof or reference to any, as an “acquired fact of
science”! The “last effort of expiring Heathendom” theory is trotted out
with complacency and with that impressive air of official knowledge
which makes the pronouncements of the family physician a law unto all
its members, from baby to father—until the specialist is called in. And

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

unfortunately these *ex cathedrâ* encyclopædic pronouncements are all
the general reader will ever hear. This is the case with all those three
indifferent articles in our current dictionaries of reference. <span
id="fr_46"></span>[1](#fn_46.md) We are assured that, “as all are generally
agreed,” the writings are Neoplatonic, and this without any
qualification or definition of the term, and that too in dictionaries
where the term “Neoplatonic,” in articles on the subject, is applied
solely to the “Chain” from Ammonius Saccas and Plotinus onwards. The
presumption is plain that by Neoplatonic forgeries we are to understand
a date of at earliest from the middle of the third century onwards.

##### CHAMBERS’S OPINION

And this although Justin Martyr (*cir.* 150 A.D.) bestows emphatic
praise on these very same writings and classes their writer, “Hermes,”
among the “most ancient philosophers,” a point which the German
theorists and their English copiers have all discreetly shirked, but
which, together with other considerations, has forced Chambers, in the
preface to his translation (London, 1882), to give quite a new meaning
to the term Neoplatonist, which he uses of Hermes in his title, <span
id="fr_47"></span>[2](#fn_47.md) and to declare that our Hermes is entitled
“to

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

be considered the real *founder* of Neoplatonism.” <span
id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) Chambers would still, in spite of Justin’s
clear testimony, wedge in the earliest deposit of Trismegistic
literature immediately between the time of composition of the new
canonical books and Justin, and devotes nearly all his notes to fishing
out every verse of the New Testament he can which bears the slightest
resemblance to the Trismegistic text. <span
id="fr_49"></span>[2](#fn_49.md) But if we closely compare these so-called
parallels, we are compelled to acknowledge that if there be any
plagiarism it is not on the side of Hermes; nay, more, it is as plain as
it can be that there is no verbal plagiarism at all, and that the
similarity of ideas therefore pertains to quite another problem, for the
distinctive dogmas of Common Christianity are entirely wanting; there is
not a single word breathed of the historical Jesus, not a syllable
concerning the nativity, the crucifixion, resurrection, ascension or
coming of Christ to judgment, as Chambers admits.

##### GERMAN ENCYCLOPÆDISM

Let us now turn to the pronouncements of German encyclopædism on the
subject. F. A. Brockhaus’ *Conversations-Lexikon* (Leipzig, 1884) does
but repeat the old hypothesis. The Trismegistic writings are “the last
monuments of Heathendom”; the writer, however, grudgingly takes in the
date of Justin Martyr in the sentence, “presumably the majority of these
writings belong to the second century,” but not a word is breathed of
how this conclusion is arrived at.

A most valuable article, in fact far and away the

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

very best that has yet been done, containing innumerable references to
all the articles in the most recent transactions of learned societies
and to the papers in scientific periodicals, is that of Chr. Scherer on
“Hermes,” in W. H. Roscher’s *Auführliches Lexikon der griechischen u.
römischen Mythologie* (Leipzig, 1884, etc.). Unfortunately this article
deals solely with the Hermes of the Greeks, while for “Hermes
Trismegistos” we are referred to “Thoth,” an article which has not yet
appeared. This brings our summary of opinions down to the close of the
last century; we have probably omitted reference to some minor opinions,
for no up-to-date bibliography exists on the subject, but we doubt that
any work of importance has escaped our notice.

##### A RECENT ARTICLE BY GRANGER

The most recent work done in England on the subject, in the present
century, is an article by Frank Granger, <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md) who, in spite of some useful criticisms
and suggestions on some points, is nevertheless in the main reactionary,
and contends for a Christian origin of our most important tractates. The
scope of his enquiry may be seen from his preliminary statement when he
writes:

“We shall have little difficulty in showing, as against Zeller, that the
book \[? our Corpus, or the first Sermon only\] is in the main
homogeneous and of Christian origin. Not only so, our discussion will
bring us into contact with the later Greek culture as it developed amid
Egyptian surroundings, and will raise several problems of considerable
importance. Among other

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

things we shall have to trace the way in which Hermes passes over into
Christian tradition, and how the Greek representations of Hermes
furnished Christian art with one of its earliest motives. <span
id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) We shall further find in it a bridge by
which we may pass over from Greek philosophy and science to modes of
thought which are properly Christian. And yet the writer retains so much
of the antique spirit that he can hardly be mistaken for an apologist of
Paganism.”

When, however, Granger attempts to prove his case, he breaks down
utterly, being able to point to little besides the popular phrase
“increase and multiply.” Towards the end of his enquiry, however, he
sees that the traditional values of many factors will have to be altered
by a study of our literature, as, for instance, when he writes:

“The traditional estimate of Gnosticism, then, requires to be
reconsidered, in the light of the *Poemandres*. It belongs to a time
when religious definitions were still in the making—a time, therefore,
when the limits of free discussion were not yet straitly drawn. Hence
the various permutations of religious belief which we find in Irenæus,
Hippolytus, Tertullian, would not be admitted by their exponents to be
in conflict with the Christian faith, but would rather be regarded as
exhibiting new and fruitful applications of principles common to all.
Ecclesiastical opinion ultimately settled down in one direction rather
than another. But until this process was complete, each living system of
belief might count upon a possible victory, <span
id="fr_52"></span>[2](#fn_52.md) and so, among others, the system which may
be traced in the *Poemandres*. And the *Poemandres* is so far from being
a merely heretical production, that

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

its relation to orthodox belief may fairly be indicated by saying that
it answers to the earlier intellectual position of Clement of
Alexandria.” <span id="fr_53"></span>[1](#fn_53.md)

We should say rather that the difficulties in which our essayist is
evidently involved by his hypothesis of Christian origin, would be
considerably lessened by accepting the evidence on all hands which a
more extended study of the Trismegistic and allied literatures affords,
and by treating what he refers to as Gnosticism without qualification as
the Christianised Gnosis, and not as Gnosticised Christianity.

We thus find Granger compelled, in keeping with the above, to guess the
date of the “Pœmandres” as towards the end of the second century; but
even so, he feels dissatisfied with himself, for he has to add: “Nor
does this date preclude us from finding occasional traces of even
earlier material.”

However we may dissent from Granger’s conclusions as to the “Pœmandres,”
we agree with him in the importance he ascribes to the *Gospel according
to the Egyptians,* in connection with which he writes <span
id="fr_54"></span>[2](#fn_54.md):

“It is instructive to note that Salome, who plays so prominent a part in
the *Gospel according to the Egyptians,* is the mother of St John, <span
id="fr_55"></span>[3](#fn_55.md) and that the same Gnostic circles in which
this gospel is current were also those in which we hear for the first
time of the Fourth Gospel. That is to say, the Fourth Gospel comes to us
from the hands of the Alexandrine Gnostics. The system of Valentinus is
really a somewhat fanciful

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

commentary upon the opening chapters of St John’s Gospel. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) Heracleon, the first great
commentator <span id="fr_57"></span>[2](#fn_57.md) upon St John, was both a
Gnostic and at the same time was really the master of Origen, and
through him helped to determine the development of the orthodox
theology. Now, the key to the interpretation of the Fourth Gospel is to
be found in the Gnostic ideas which underlie the *Poemandres,* ideas to
which Heracleon furnishes the clue. But the commentators have refused
the help which the Gnostics could give, and the Fourth Gospel has been
consistently misunderstood owing to the exaggerated stress which has
been laid upon the doctrine of the λόγος.”

I am not quite clear what the last sentence is intended to mean. Too
great stress cannot be laid upon the doctrine of the Logos, for it is,
as we shall show, the fundamental concept of Hellenistic theology; but
too great stress can and has been laid upon the illegitimate claim that
the Proem of the Fourth Gospel embodies a peculiarly Christian doctrine.

Moreover, if the Fourth Gospel emerges in Alexandrine circles and is so
essentially Gnostic, how can it be ascribed, as Granger appears to
ascribe it, to “St John”? A very different conclusion seems to follow
from Granger’s premisses.

The conclusion of the most recent study by English scholarship on our
“Pœmandres” is as follows:

“The *Poemandres,* then, is a very striking exponent of the religious
and philosophical ideas amid which

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Alexandrine
theology arose. On the one hand it is in touch with Greek mythology and
science; on the other, with Jewish and Christian literature. The author
is more sober than most of his Gnostic contemporaries; he is a more
consistent reasoner than Clement.” <span id="fr_58"></span>[1](#fn_58.md)

But if, as we shall show, the date of the “Pœmandres” must be pushed
back demonstrably at least a hundred years, and if, as is exceedingly
probable, it must go back still further, the whole problem is changed,
and the relationship of all the factors alters proportionately.

##### REITZENSTEIN AND THE DAWN OF RIGHT VIEWS

But in the present century, by the publication of Reitzenstein’s
*Poimandres,* the whole subject has been placed on a different footing
and brought into a clearer light. Reitzenstein attacks the problem of
the Trismegistic writings from an entirely objective, historical,
philological, and literary standpoint. Being entirely emancipated from
any theological preconceptions, he is always careful to point out that
his conclusions are based solely on critical research in the domain of
philology proper; he cannot, however, refrain at times from adding
(somewhat slily) that these results are of the deepest interest to the
theologian—indeed, we might say highly embarrassing if the theologian
happens to be a traditionalist.

The general scope of Reitzenstein’s essay may be gathered from his
sub-title, “Studies in Greek-Egyptian and Early Christian Literature.”
Our Trismegistic writings form part of a large number of Greek written
texts, the remains of a once exceedingly extensive Hellenistic
theological literature; and by Hellenistic

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

theology is meant the blending of Greek and Oriental religious thought
and experience. This Hellenistic theology was most strongly influenced
by Egyptian conceptions and traditions. The Egyptian religion is known
to have spread itself over the Hellenistic world, and every scholar will
at once recall to mind how many Greek writers have treated expressly of
the Egyptian religion, and how many passages in Greek literature refer
to Egyptian beliefs, as compared with the very few which treat of
Babylonian, Persian, or even Syrian.

Nevertheless, the remains of this Hellenistic theological literature
have never been treated as a whole from the point of view of philology;
the cause of this has been the entire disregard of the subject by
Christian theologians, coupled with the grotesque grounds on which the
consideration of the Hellenistic-Egyptian religion is usually set
aside—one famous theologian lately going so far as to assert that the
Egyptian worship was despised on all sides, both by Jews and Greeks, as
the lowest depth of human superstition.

As then Egypt had a provably dominant position in Hellenistic
literature, so also must she have had in some sort a correspondingly
strong influence on Hellenistic culture, and consequently on the
development of Hellenistic religious experience. The evidence of this is
afforded by the Early Christian literature.

We have, therefore, here in these Greek-Egyptian and Early Christian
documents the possibility of methodical work, seeing that it is a
question of the comparative study of two contemporaneous literatures;
moreover, the language and typology of the Christian literature is bound
to betray traces of the general Hellenistic theology of the time (pp.
v., vi.).

The study of Reitzenstein is thus a consideration of

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

our Trismegistic literature as a whole, and the analysis and comparison
of two of the most typical sermons with other Hellenistic documents and
with Early Christian writings.

This he does with praiseworthy and painstaking industry, with great
acumen and admirable scholarly equipment; but his work is of no service
to any but scholars, and that, too, to scholars who are specialists. It
is a work bristling with technicalities of every description, and
crammed with untranslated texts. Indeed, Reitzenstein belongs to that
school of philological purists who think it a loss of dignity to
translate anything; this is a very convenient convention, and I myself
have often wished that I could have availed myself of it when face to
face with innumerable difficulties of translation.

Reitzenstein, then, translates nothing, but busies himself with texts
and the higher criticism of the subject. He, however, does not give us
the text of our literature as a whole, or even of the Corpus Hermeticum,
but only of four chapters and the fragments of a fifth. Moreover, the
results of his investigations are very difficult to summarise; indeed,
he nowhere summarises them himself in any certain fashion, his chapters
being on the whole of the nature of studies in the Trismegistic
literature rather than a complete exposition.

Nevertheless these studies are, beyond comparison, the most important
and suggestive work that has yet been done on the subject; and as I
shall avail myself of his labours on so many occasions in the sequel, I
cannot refrain from acknowledging here the special debt of gratitude
which all lovers of our sermons must feel to him, for compelling the
attention of scholars to the first importance of the Trismegistic
literature in the

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

domain of the history of the development of religious thought in the
first centuries.

The general scope of his studies will be seen from the titles of the
main chapters:—I. Age of the “Poimandres”; by “Poimandres” R. means *C.
H.,* i. only. II. Analysis of the “Poimandres”; III. Fundamental
Conception of the “Poimandres”; IV. “Poimandres” and the Egyptian
Apocalyptic Literature; V. Expansion of the Hermetic Literature; VI. The
Hermetic Corpus; VII. The Later “Poimandres” Document (The
Prophet-Initiation).

The theory of plagiarism from Christianity must for ever be abandoned.
The whole literature is based on the “Pœmandres” as its original gospel,
and the original form of this scripture must be placed at least prior to
the second century A.D. How much earlier it goes back we cannot at
present say with any exactitude; before the beginning of the second
century is the *terminus ad quem*—that is to say it cannot possibly be
later than this; to seek, therefore, for traditional Christian thoughts
in this document is henceforth deprived of any prospect of success (p.
36).

Reitzenstein tells us (p. 2) that these writings in the first place
interested him solely through their literary form, but that this
interest became deepened as he gradually learned to value them as
important records of that powerful religious movement which, like a
flood, overflowed the West from the East, and, after preparing the way
for Christianity, subsequently bore it along with it; the best and
surest evidence of this religious revival is to be found in the literary
form of Hellenistic theology.

This in itself is of interest enough and to spare; and at a time when
every scrap of contemporary literature is being so eagerly scanned for
the smallest side-light it

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

can throw on the environment and development of Christian origins, it is
amazing that the Trismegistic writings should have been hitherto so
studiously neglected.

##### A KEY TO EGYPT’S WISDOM

But there is another and still more profoundly interesting side of the
subject which we cannot expect to find treated in a purely philological,
technical, and critical treatise. The more one studies the best of these
mystical sermons, casting aside all prejudice, and trying to feel and
think with the writers, the nearer one is conscious of approaching the
threshold of what may well be believed to have been the true Adytum of
the best in the mystery-traditions of antiquity. Innumerable are the
hints of the greatnesses and immensities lying beyond that
threshold—among other precious things the vision of the key to Egypt’s
wisdom, the interpretation of apocalypsis by the light of the sun-clear
epopteia of the intelligible cosmos.

Such greatnesses and such mysteries have a power and beauty which the
most disreputable tradition of the texts through unknowing hands cannot
wholly disguise, and they are still recognisable, even though thus clad
in the rags of their once fair garments, by those who have eyes to see
and ears to hear.

But to return to the points we raised in the opening of this chapter.

##### THE SUGGESTED ANSWERS TO OUR QUESTIONS

If we now re-state the problems we are considering in the interrogative
form, we shall have to find answers to the following questions:

Why did the early Church Fathers accept the

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

Trismegistic writings as exceedingly ancient and authoritative, and in
their apologetic writings quote them in support of the main impersonal
dogmas of Christianity?

Why, in the revival of learning, for upwards of a century and a half did
all the Humanists welcome them with open arms as a most valuable adjunct
to Christianity, and as being in accord with its main doctrines, so much
so that they laboured to substitute Trismegistus for Aristotle in the
schools?

Finally, why during the last two centuries and a half has a body of
opinion been gradually evolved, infinitesimal in its beginnings, but
well-nigh shutting out every other view, that these writings are
Neoplatonic forgeries?

The answers to these questions are simple:—The Church Fathers appealed
to the authority of antiquity and to a tradition that had never been
called in question, in order to show that they taught nothing
fundamentally new—that, in brief, they taught on main points what Hermes
had taught. They lived in days too proximate to that tradition to have
ventured on bringing any charge of plagiarism and forgery against it
without exposing themselves to a crushing rejoinder from men who were
still the hearers of its “living voice” and possessors of its “written
word.”

The scholars of the Renaissance naturally followed the unvarying
tradition of antiquity, confirmed by the Fathers of the Church.

Gradually, however, it was perceived that, if the old tradition were
accepted, the fundamental originality of general Christian
doctrines—that is to say, the philosophical basis of the Faith, as apart
from the historical dogmas peculiar to it—could no longer be maintained.
It, therefore, became imperatively necessary to discredit the ancient
tradition by every possible

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

means. With what success this policy has been attended we have already
seen; we have also reviewed this growth of opinion, and shown its
baseless character and the straits to which its defenders have been put.

From the clouds of this obscurantism the sun of Thrice-greatest Hermes
and the radiance of his Gnosis have once more shone forth in the skies
of humanistic enquiry and unprejudiced research. He is no longer to be
called bastard, and plagiarist, and thief of other people’s property,
but must be regarded as a genuine teacher of men, handing on his own,
and giving freely of his substance to all who will receive the gift.

century, while Fabricius himself, whose summary of prior opinion is
overworked by Harles, assigns them to the time of Porphyry and
Iamblichus, though Harles dates the earliest of them from the end of the
first to the middle of the second century (p. 48, n.).

<span id="fn_30"></span>[23:2](th105.htm#fr_30.md) It may be worth while
here to record the opinion of Gibbon, who would ascribe a Christian

conflict between Neoplatonism and Christianity, the former sought to
give a profounder and more spiritual meaning to the pagan philosophy, by
