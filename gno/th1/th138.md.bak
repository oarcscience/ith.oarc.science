##### THE TRUE “LOGOS,” AGAIN, ACCORDING TO PLUTARCH

LXIV\. 1. But, to speak concisely, it is not correct to consider either
water or sun or earth or heaven as Osiris or Isis, or, again, fire or
drought or sea as Typhon; but if we were to assign simply that
\[nature\] to the latter which is not subject to measure or rule owing
to excesses or insufficiencies, and should reverence and honour that
which has been subjected to order and is good and beneficent, as the
work of Isis, and the image and copy and reason of Osiris, we should not
miss the mark.

2\. Moreover, we shall make Eudoxus <span
id="fr_1199"></span>[2](#fn_1200.md) cease to disbelieve and be perplexed,
how it is neither Demeter who has charge of love-affairs but Isis, nor
Dionysus who has the power either to make the Nile increase or to rule
over the dead \[but Osiris\].

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

3\. For we think that by one Common Reason (*Logos*) <span
id="fr_1200"></span>[1](#fn_1201.md) these Gods have been ordained over
every domain of good; and every fair and good thing possible for nature
owes its origin to their means,—\[Osiris\] giving \[them\] their origins
and \[Isis\] receiving and distributing \[them\].
