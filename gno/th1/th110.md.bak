### VII

#### THE MYTH OF MAN IN THE MYSTERIES

##### THE GNOSTIC TRADITION

“<span class="smallcaps">But</span> All-Father Mind, being Life and
Light, did bring forth Man (Ἄνθρωπον) co-equal to Himself.” <span
id="fr_300"></span>[1](#fn_300.md)

So runs the opening paragraph of what we may call the soteriological
part of the “Pœmandres” treatise of our Trismegistic literature. This
Man or Anthrōpos is the Spiritual Prototype of humanity and of every
individual man, and is a technical term found in a number of the early
Christianised Gnostic systems.

For instance, in a system some outlines of which are preserved in the
polemical *Refutation* of Irenæus, <span id="fr_301"></span>[2](#fn_301.md)
and which the Bishop of Lyons seems to associate with an Ophite
tradition, while Theodoret <span id="fr_302"></span>[3](#fn_302.md)
ascribes it to the Sethians, we are told that in the Unutterable Depth
were two Great Lights,—the First Man, or Father, and His Son, the Second
Man; and also the Holy Spirit, the First Woman, or Mother of all living.

In this tradition, moreover, the Son of the Mother—the chief Formative
Power of the seven Demiurgic Potencies of the sensible cosmos—is called
Ialdabaōth (? the Child of the Egg), who boasts himself to be

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

supreme. But his mother, Wisdom, reproves his pride, saying unto him:
“Lie not, Ialdabaōth, for above thee is the Father of All, First Man,
and Man Son of Man.” <span id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_303.md)

##### THE “PHILOSOPHUMENA” OF HIPPOLYTUS

But the main source of our information on this Anthrōpos tradition, in
its Christianised Gnostic form, is to be found in Hippolytus’
*Philosophumena; or, Refutation of all Heresies.*

In 1842, Minoïdes Mynas, a learned Greek, sent on a literary mission by
the French Government, discovered in one of the monasteries on Mount
Athos the only MS. (generally ascribed to the fourteenth century) which
we possess of this extremely valuable work. It was originally in ten
books, but, unfortunately, the first three and the beginning of the
fourth are missing from our MS. The first book, however, was already
known, though previously erroneously ascribed to Origen, and was
accordingly prefixed to the text of the *editio princeps* of our work by
Emmanuel Miller (Oxford, 1851).

The missing Books II. and III. dealt respectively with the doctrines and
mysteries of the Egyptians and with those of the Chaldæans. Hippolytus
(Proœm.) boasts that he has divulged all their mysteries, as well as the
secrets of those Christian mystics whom he stigmatises as heretics, and
to whom he devotes Books V.-IX.

It is a curious fact that it is precisely those Books wherein this
divulging of the Mysteries was attempted, which should be missing; not
only have they disappeared, but in the Epitome at the beginning of Book
X. the summary of their contents is also omitted. This seems almost to
point to a deliberate removal of just

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

that information which would be of priceless value to us to-day, not
only for the general history of the evolution of religious ideas, but
also for filling in an important part of the background of the
environment of infant Christianity.

Why, then, were these books cut out? Were the subsequent Christian
Orthodox deterred by religious scruples, or were they afraid to
circulate this information? Hippolytus himself seems to have had no such
hesitation; he is ever delightedly boasting that he is giving away to
the multitude the most sacred secrets of others; it seems to have been
his special *métier* to cry aloud on the house-tops what had been
whispered in their secret chambers. It was for him a delicious triumph
over “error” to boast, “I have your secret documents, and I am going to
publish them!”

Why, then, should those who came after him hesitate? Surely they were
like-minded with Hippolytus, and would have been as delighted as himself
in humbling the pride of the hated Mystery-institutions in the dust? Can
it possibly be that they saw far more clearly than he did that quite
other deductions might be drawn from his “startling revelations”?

##### THE NAASSENES

That far other deductions could be drawn from the Mystery-rites and
Mystery-myths was at anyrate the view of a tradition of early Jewish and
Christian mystics whom Hippolytus calls Naassenes. The claim of these
Gnostics was practically that Christianity, or rather the Good News of
the Christ, was precisely the consummation of the inner doctrine of the
Mystery-institutions of all the nations; the end of them all was the
revelation of the Mystery of Man.

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

It is further to be noticed that these Naassenes, “who call themselves
Gnostics” (v. 2), are the very first school of Christian “heresy” with
which Hippolytus deals; he puts them in the forefront of his
*Refutation,* as being, presumably, in his opinion, the oldest, or, at
anyrate, as representing the most ancient form of Christian “heresy.”

Although the name Naassene (Ναασσηνοί) is derived from the Hebrew
*Naḥash* (Serpent), Hippolytus does not call them Ophites; indeed, he
reserves the latter name to a body to which he also gives (viii. 20) the
name Caïnites and Nochaïtæ (Νοχαϊταί)—? Nachaïtæ, again, from
*Nachash* <span id="fr_304"></span>[1](#fn_304.md)—and considers them of
not sufficient importance for further mention.

These Naassenes possessed many secret books or *apocrypha*—that is,
books kept back from general circulation—and also regarded as
authoritative the following scriptures: *The Gospel of Perfection, The
Gospel of Eve, The Questions of Mary,* <span
id="fr_305"></span>[2](#fn_305.md) *Concerning the Offspring of Mary, The
Gospel of Philip, The Gospel according to Thomas,* and *The Gospel
according to the Egyptians.* All of which points somewhat to an
Alexandrian or Egyptian circle.

##### ANALYSIS OF HIPPOLYTUS’ ACCOUNT OF THE NAASSENE DOCUMENT

One of their secret MSS. had fallen into the hands of Hippolytus. It is
in the Bishop of Portus’ quotations

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

from this document that Reitzenstein (pp. 81 ff.) seeks to discover what
he calls the “Hellenistic Myth of the God Anthrōpos.” His theory is
that, by eliminating the Christian citations and thoughts of the
Naassene writer, we are face to face with a purely Heathen document.

The reproduction of their views, as given by Hippolytus, <span
id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_306.md) falls according to Reitzenstein into
three divisions.

(i.) The first begins with the explanation of the name “Naassene” (S.
131, 1; C. 139, 1 <span id="fr_307"></span>[2](#fn_307).md), and, after
giving a few brief headings, ends (S. 134, 8; C. 141, 2) with the
statement that the writer of the MS. said they had their tradition from
James, the Brother of the Lord, who had delivered it to Mariamnē.

(iii.) The third begins (S. 170, 64; C. 178, 1) with another explanation
of the name. In both of these parts are found remains of hymns from some
liturgical collection.

(ii.) Between i. and ii. lies a longer exposition in which Hippolytus
tries to show that the Naassene doctrines are taken from the Mysteries,
culminating in the assertion that the Naassenes, as a matter of fact,
were nothing else than sectaries of the Mysteries of the Mother of the
Gods, in proof of which he quotes at length from a secret document of
their school.

Our interest in these quotations, however, is very different from that
of Hippolytus, for, as Reitzenstein has now shown, it is manifest on
inspection that the Christian quotations and thoughts in this document

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

violently disrupt its underlying continuity, and that they are for the
most part easily removable without damage to the sense.

With regard to the Old Testament quotations it is not always so easy to
disentangle them from the Hellenistic source, much less from the New
Testament quotations; the phenomena, however, presented by them are of
such a nature that, in my opinion, there is ample evidence before us
that there was a Jewish working-over of the matter before it came into
the hands of the Christian overwriter. Reitzenstein, however, does not
venture so far.

Even, then, if we were content with Reitzenstein’s analysis only, it is
quite clear that the quotations from the Old Testament formed no part of
the original; and that we have, therefore, before us what was once a
purely Heathen text, with Gnostic Christian *scholia,* or rather
overworked by a Christian Gnostic. The original Pagan text had,
accordingly, been cut up by the Naassene overwriter before ever it came
into the hands of Hippolytus.

Now, as the Christianised text must have been for some time in private
circulation before it reached the library of the Bishop of Portus <span
id="fr_308"></span>[1](#fn_308.md)—even if we make no allowance for a
Jewish Hellenistic stratum of overwriting, still seeing that Hippolytus’
own view was that, in the Naassene MS., he had before him a basic
document of those whom he regarded as the earliest Christian
“heretics”—it is quite evident that if we were to place the date of the
original Hellenistic source in the first century, we should not be doing
violence even to the ecclesiastical traditional absurdity that
Gnosticism first sullied the orthodox purity of the Church only

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

in the reign of Trajan (96-117 A.D.). But we will return to the question
of date later on.

As the whole matter is not only one of considerable interest for the
student of our treatises, but also of the greatest importance for the
student of the history of Gnosticism, I shall give a translation of
Hippolytus’ introductory and concluding sections, as well as of the
intermediate section which specially concerns us, so that the reader may
have a view of the whole medley as it comes to us from the hands of the
heresy-hunting bishop.

I shall, moreover, proceed a stage further in the analysis of the
material of Hippolytus than Reitzenstein has done, and hope, when the
evidence has been laid before the reader, to win his assent to what
appears to me to be the natural sifting out of the various elements,
with resultant phenomena which are of the greatest importance for the
history of Gnosticism, and, therefore, of the evolution of Christian
dogmatics, and which lead to conclusions that are far too serious to be
treated in the short space of a single chapter of our present essay.

In the following analysis H. stands for Hippolytus; C. for the Christian
Gnostic final overwriter, the “Naassene” whose MS. lay before H.; J. for
the Naassene Jewish mystic who preceded C. and overworked the original;
S. for the original Heathen Hellenistic Source.

As H. and C. are of secondary importance for our immediate enquiry,
though of themselves of the greatest value and interest, I shall print
them in smaller type. J. I shall print in the same type as S., as nearer
in contact with S. than C., and as being sometimes more difficult to
detach from S. than from C.

The reader, to have the text of Hippolytus before him, must neglect all
the critical indications and read straight on.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

With these brief preliminary indications we will, then, present the
reader with a translation of the first section, or introductory
part, <span id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_309.md) of Hippolytus’ exposure or
exposition of the Naassene doctrines, begging him to remember throughout
that it is a portrait painted by the hand of one of their bitterest
foes.

##### HIPPOLYTUS’ INTRODUCTION

<span style="font-size: small">H. The priests and chiefs of \[this\]
doctrine <span id="fr_310"></span>[2](#fn_310.md) were first of all those
who were called Naasseni—so named in Hebrew, \[in which\] “serpent” is
called *naas*. <span id="fr_311"></span>[3](#fn_311.md) But subsequently
they called themselves Gnostics, pretending that they alone knew the
Depths. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">From these many separated themselves and
\[so\] turned the school, which was originally a single one, into
numerous sects, setting forth the same ideas in various doctrinal forms,
as our argument will show as it advances. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">These \[Naassenes\] honour as the Logos
(Reason) of all universals <span id="fr_312"></span>[4](#fn_312.md) Man,
and Son of Man. This Man is male-female, and is called by them
Adamas. <span id="fr_313"></span>[5](#fn_313.md) And they have many
intricate <span id="fr_314"></span>[6](#fn_314.md) hymns in his honour.
These hymns—to dispose of them briefly—run somewhat as follows: </span>

J. ‘“From Thee’ \[is\] Father, and ‘Through Thee’ <span
id="fr_315"></span>[7](#fn_315.md) Mother—the two Immortal Names, <span
id="fr_316"></span>[8](#fn_316.md) Parents of Æons, O Thou who hast the
Heaven for Thy City, O Man of Mighty Names.” <span
id="fr_317"></span>[9](#fn_317.md)

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. And they divide him into three, like
Gēryōnēs; <span id="fr_318"></span>[1](#fn_318.md) for, they say, he has a
mental, psychic, and choïc \[aspect\]; <span
id="fr_319"></span>[2](#fn_319.md) and they think that the Gnosis of <span
id="fr_320"></span>[3](#fn_320.md) this \[Man\] is the beginning of the
possibility of knowing God, saying: </span>

J. The beginning of Perfection \[is\] the Gnosis of Man, but the Gnosis
of God is perfected Perfection. <span id="fr_321"></span>[4](#fn_321.md)

<span style="font-size: small">H. All these, he says <span
id="fr_322"></span>[5](#fn_322.md)—mental, psychic, and earthy—descended
together into one man—Jesus, born of Mary. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">And these three Men, he says, spake each
from their own special essences to their own special folk. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">For of the universal principles there are
three kinds \[or races\]—the angelic, psychic, and earthy; and three
churches—angelic, psychic, and earthy named the Elect, Called, and
Bound. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">These are the chief heads from a very
large number of doctrines, <span id="fr_323"></span>[6](#fn_323.md) which,
he says, James, the Brother of the Lord, handed on to Mariamnē. <span
id="fr_324"></span>[7](#fn_324.md) </span>

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

<span style="font-size: small">But in order that we may put an end to
the lying accounts of these impious \[heretics\] concerning Mariamnē,
and James, and the Saviour Himself, <span
id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_325.md) let us come to the Initiations from
which they get this myth—if you like \[to call it so\]—to the
non-Grecian and Grecian \[Initiations\]; and let us see how, by
combining together the secret Mysteries of all the Gentiles which must
not be spoken of, and by telling lies about the Christ, they take in
those who do not know that these things are the Orgies of the Gentiles.
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">Now, since the foundation of their system
is Man Adamas, and they say it has been written of him, “Who shall
declare his generation?” <span id="fr_326"></span>[2](#fn_326.md)—learn how
they have taken the undiscoverable and contradictory generation of Man
and plastered it on the Christ.</span>

##### THE MATERIAL FOR THE RECOVERY OF THE ORIGINAL HELLENISTIC DOCUMENT

\(1\) S. “Earth (say the Greeks <span id="fr_327"></span>[3](#fn_327).md)
first brought forth Man—bearing a fair gift, desiring to be mother not
of plants without feeling, nor of brutes without reason, but of a tamed
God-loving life.

“Difficult is it <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says <span
id="fr_328"></span>[4](#fn_328).md)</span> to discover whether it was among
the Bœotians that Alalkomeneus rose from the Kephisian Lake as first of
men; or whether

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

it was the Idæan Kurētes, race divine, or the Phrygian Korybantes, whom
Helios saw first sprouting forth tree-like; or whether Arkadia brought
forth Pelasgos \[first\], older than the Moon; or Eleusis Diaulos,
dweller in Raria; or Lēmnos Kabeiros, fair child of ineffable
orgies; <span id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_329.md) or whether Pallēnē
Phlegræan Alkyoneus, eldest of Giants.

“The Libyans say that Garamas, <span id="fr_330"></span>[2](#fn_330.md)
rising from parched plains, first picked sweet date of Zeus; while
Neilos, making fat the mud of Egypt to this day <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>, breeds living things, and
renders from damp heat things clothed in flesh.” <span
id="fr_331"></span>[3](#fn_331.md)

The Assyrians say it was with them Ōannēs, the Fish-eater; while the
Chaldæans \[say that it was\] Adam.

\(2\) J. And this Adam they \[the Chaldæans\] say was the man that Earth
produced—a body only, and that he lay breathless, motionless, immovable,
like a statue, being an image of that Man Above—

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. —of whom they sing, and brought into
existence by the many Powers, <span id="fr_332"></span>[1](#fn_332.md)
concerning which there is much detailed teaching. </span>

J. In order, then, that the Great Man from Above—

<span style="font-size: small">C. From whom, as is said, every
fatherhood has its name on earth or in the heavens. <span
id="fr_333"></span>[2](#fn_333.md)</span>

J. —might be completely brought low, there was given unto him <span
id="fr_334"></span>[3](#fn_334.md) Soul also, in order that through the
Soul the enclosed plasm of the Great, Most-fair, and Perfect Man might
suffer and be chastened.

<span style="font-size: small">H. For thus they call Him. They seek to
discover then further what is the Soul, and whence, and of what nature,
that by entering into man and moving him, it should enslave and chasten
the plasm of the Perfect Man; but they seek this also not from the
Scriptures, but from the Mysteries. </span>

\(3\) S. And they <span id="fr_335"></span>[4](#fn_335.md) say that Soul is
very difficult to discover, and hard to understand; for it never remains
of the same appearance, or form, or in the same state, so that one can
describe it by a general type, <span id="fr_336"></span>[5](#fn_336.md) or
comprehend it by an essential quality.

<span style="font-size: small">H. These variegated metamorphoses
they <span id="fr_337"></span>[6](#fn_337.md) have laid down in the Gospel,
superscribed “According to the Egyptians.” <span
id="fr_338"></span>[7](#fn_338.md) </span>

S. They are accordingly in doubt—

<span style="font-size: small">H. —like all the rest of the
Gentiles—</span>

J. —whether it \[*sc.* the Soul\] is from the Pre-existing \[One\], or
from the Self-begotten, or from the Streaming Chaos. <span
id="fr_339"></span>[8](#fn_339.md)

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. And first of all, in considering the
triple division of Man, they fly for help to the Initiations of the
Assyrians; for the Assyrians were the first to consider the Soul triple
and \[yet\] one. </span>

\(4\) S. Now every nature <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> yearns after Soul—one in one way and another in another.

For Soul is cause of all in Genesis. All things that are sustained and
grow <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> need Soul.
Indeed, no sustenance <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>
or growth is possible without the presence of Soul.

Nay, even stones <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> are
ensouled; <span id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_340.md) for they have the power
of increase \[or growth\]; and growth could not take place without
sustenance; for it is by addition that things which increase grow; and
addition is the sustenance of that which is sustained. <span
id="fr_341"></span>[2](#fn_341.md)

\(5\) Now the Assyrians call this \[Mystery\] Adōnis (or Endymiōn). And
whenever it is called Adōnis <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span>, it is Aphroditē who is in love with and desires Soul
so-called.

<span style="font-size: small">H. And Aphroditē is Genesis according to
them. <span id="fr_342"></span>[3](#fn_342.md)</span>

But when Persephonē (that is, Korē) is in love with Adōnis, Soul becomes
subject to Death, separated from Aphrodite (that is, from Genesis).

But if Selēnē is impassioned of Endymiōn, and is in

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

love with \[formal\] beauty, <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_343.md) it is
the Nature of the higher \[spaces <span
id="fr_344"></span>[2](#fn_344.md)\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> which desires Soul.

(6 <span id="fr_345"></span>[3](#fn_345).md) But if <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the Mother of the Gods
emasculate Attis—she, too, regarding him as the object of her love—it is
the Blessed Nature Above of the supercosmic and æonian \[spaces\] which
calls back the masculine power of Soul to herself. <span
id="fr_346"></span>[4](#fn_346.md)

<span style="font-size: small">H. For Man, he says, is male-female.
According, then, to this theory of theirs, the intercourse between man
and woman is exhibited as most mischievous, and is forbidden according
to their teaching. </span>

J. For Attis <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is
emasculated—that is, \[Soul is separated\] from the earthy parts of the
creation \[tending\] downwards, and ascends in quest of the Æonian
Essence Above—

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

<span style="font-size: small">C. —where (H. he says) is “neither male
nor female,” <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_347.md) but a new creature, a
new man, who is male-female. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. What they call “Above” I will explain
when I come to the proper place. And they say that this theory is
supported not simply by \[the myth\] of Rhea, but also, to put it
briefly, by universal creation. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">Nay, they make out that this is \[even\]
what was said by the Word (*Logos*): <span
id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_348.md)</span>

<span style="font-size: small">C. “For the invisible <span
id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_349.md) things of Him \[God\]—namely, His
Eternal <span id="fr_350"></span>[4](#fn_350.md) Power and Godhead—are
clearly seen from the creation of the world, being understood by His
things that are made; so that they \[men\] are without excuse. Because
that, though knowing God, they glorified Him not as God, nor did they
give \[Him\] thanks, but their non-understanding heart was made
foolish. <span id="fr_351"></span>[5](#fn_351.md)</span>

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Professing themselves to be wise, they
convicted themselves of folly, and changed the Glory of the
Incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and
of birds, and of four-footed beasts, and creeping things. <span
id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_352.md) . . . <span
id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_353.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Wherefore also God gave them up to
passions of dishonour; for both their females did change their natural
use to that which is against nature—</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. And what the natural use is, according
to them, we will say later on.</span>

<span style="font-size: small">C. —“and likewise also their males,
leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust for one
another, males with males working unseemliness <span
id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_354.md)—</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. And “unseemliness,” according to them,

recompense of their Error which was meet.” </span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. For in these words which Paul spake is

<span style="font-size: small">For what is promised by the \[rite of
the\] bath <span id="fr_356"></span>[5](#fn_356.md) is nothing else,
according to them, than the introduction into Unfading Bliss of him who,
according to them, is washed with Living Water, and anointed with the
Chrism that no tongue can declare. <span id="fr_357"></span>[6](#fn_357.md)
</span>

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

<span style="font-size: small">Hence as they place the Original Nature
of the universals in the Original Seed, having learned the Hippocratian
*dictum* that a child of seven is half a father, they say at fourteen
years, according to Thomas, it is manifested. This <span
id="fr_363"></span>[6](#fn_363.md) is their ineffable and mysterious
Logos. <span id="fr_364"></span>[7](#fn_364.md) </span>

(8 <span id="fr_365"></span>[8](#fn_365).md) S. <span

Egyptians—who are the most ancient of men after the Phrygians, who at
the same time were confessedly the first to communicate to mankind the
Mystery-rites and Orgies of all the Gods, and to declare their Forms and
Energies—have the mysteries of Isis, holy, venerable, and not to be
disclosed to the uninitiated.

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. And these are nothing else than the
robbing of the member of Osiris, and its being sought for by the
seven-robed and black-mantled <span id="fr_366"></span>[1](#fn_366.md)

And (they \[the Egyptians\] say) Osiris is Water. <span
id="fr_367"></span>[2](#fn_367.md) And Seven-robed Nature—

<span style="font-size: small">H. —having round her, nay, robing
*herself* in seven ætheric vestures—for thus they <span
id="fr_368"></span>[3](#fn_368.md) allegorically designate the
planet-stars, calling \[their spheres\] ætheric vestures—</span>

S. —being metamorphosed, as ever-changing Genesis, by the Ineffable and
Uncopiable and Incomprehensible and Formless, is shown forth as
creation.

J. And this is what <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>
is said in the Scripture:

“Seven times the Just shall fall and rise again.” <span
id="fr_369"></span>[4](#fn_369.md)

For these “fallings” <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>
are the changes of the stars, <span id="fr_370"></span>[5](#fn_370.md) set
in motion by the Mover of all things.

\(9\) S. Accordingly they <span id="fr_371"></span>[6](#fn_371.md) declare
concerning the Essence of the Seed which is the cause of all things in

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Genesis, that it
is none of these things, but that it begets and makes all generated
things, saying:

“I become what I will, and am what I am.” <span
id="fr_372"></span>[1](#fn_372.md)

Therefore <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> That which
moves all is unmoved; for It remains what It is, making all things, and
becomes no one of the things produced.

<span style="font-size: small">(H. He says that)</span> This is the Only
Good—

<span style="font-size: small">C. And concerning this was spoken what
was said by the Saviour: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Why callest thou me Good? One is
Good <span id="fr_373"></span>[2](#fn_373.md)—my Father in the Heavens, who
maketh His sun to rise on righteous and unrighteous, and sendeth rain on
saints and sinners.” <span id="fr_374"></span>[3](#fn_374.md)</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. And who are the saints on whom He
sendeth rain and the sinners on whom He also sendeth rain—this also he
tells subsequently with the rest. </span>

S. —and <span style="font-size: small">(H. that)</span> This is the
Great, Hidden, and Unknown Mystery of the Egyptians, Hidden and \[yet\]
Revealed.

For there is no temple <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> before the

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

entrance of which the Hidden \[Mystery\] does not stand naked, pointing
from below above, and crowned with all its fruits of generation.

\(10\) And <span style="font-size: small">(H. they say)</span> it stands
so symbolised not only in the most sacred temples before the statues,
but also set up for general knowledge—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —as it were “a light not under the
bushel, but” set “on the candlestick” <span
id="fr_375"></span>[1](#fn_375.md)—a preaching “heralded forth on the
house-tops.” <span id="fr_376"></span>[2](#fn_376.md)</span>

S. —on all the roads and in all the streets, and alongside the very
houses as a boundary and limit of the dwelling; <span
style="font-size: small">(H. that)</span> This is the God spoken of by
all, for they call Him Bringer-of-good, not knowing what they say.

<span style="font-size: small">H. And this mystery \[-symbol\] the
Greeks got from the Egyptians, and have it \[even\] to this day.</span>

<span style="font-size: small">At anyrate, he says, we see the
“Hermes” <span id="fr_377"></span>[3](#fn_377.md) honoured by them in this
form. </span>

\(11\) S. And the Cyllenians, treating \[this symbol\] with special
honour, \[regard it as the\] Logos. <span
id="fr_378"></span>[4](#fn_378.md)

For <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> Hermes is \[the\]
Logos, who, as being the Interpreter and Fabricator of all things that
have been and are and shall be, was honoured by them under the symbolism
of this figure, namely an ithyphallus.

And that he <span style="font-size: small">(H. that is Hermes, so
symbolised)</span> is

—not the “suitors” of Penelope <span style="font-size: small">(H. he

they <span id="fr_382"></span>[4](#fn_382.md) think—</span>

J. —they <span id="fr_383"></span>[5](#fn_383.md) have been thus brought
down into the plasm of clay, in order that they may be enslaved to the
Demiurge of this creation, Esaldaios <span

<span style="font-size: small">H. —a fiery God, fourth in number, for

This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is He who alone
hath the power of life and death. <span id="fr_388"></span>[3](#fn_388.md)

J. Concerning Him it is written: “Thou shalt shepherd them with a rod of
iron.” <span id="fr_389"></span>[4](#fn_389.md)

But the poet <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>, wishing
to embellish the incomprehensibility of the Blessed Nature of the Logos,
bestowed upon Him a golden instead of an iron rod.

S. “He spell-binds the eyes” of the dead <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>, and “wakes them again too
from sleep”—those who are waked from sleep and become “mindful.” <span
id="fr_390"></span>[5](#fn_390.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. Concerning them the Scripture saith:
“Awake thou that sleepest, and rise, and Christ will give thee
light.” <span id="fr_391"></span>[6](#fn_391.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">This is the Christ, the Son of Man (H. he
says), expressed in all who are born from the Logos, whom no expression
can express.</span>

S. This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the Great
Ineffable Mystery of the Eleusinia: “Hye Kye.” <span
id="fr_392"></span>[7](#fn_392.md)

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

J. And that <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> all

earth hath gone forth their sound.” <span
id="fr_393"></span>[1](#fn_393.md)

\(14\) S. And “Hermes leads them, moving his rod, and they follow,
squeaking” <span id="fr_394"></span>[2](#fn_394.md)—the souls in a cluster,
as the poet hath shown in the following image:

> Fly squeaking—should one from out the cluster fall  
> Down from the rock, they cling to one another.” <span

J. The “rock” <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> means
Adamas. This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the
“corner-stone”—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —“that hath become the head of the
corner.” <span id="fr_396"></span>[4](#fn_396.md) For in the</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span

expression—</span>

J. —which “I insert in the foundation of Zion.” <span
id="fr_399"></span>[3](#fn_399.md)

\[By this\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> he <span
id="fr_400"></span>[4](#fn_400.md) means, allegorically, the plasm of man.
For the Adamas who is “inserted” is \[the inner man, and the
“foundations of Zion” are <span id="fr_401"></span>[5](#fn_401.md)\] the
“teeth”—the “fence of the teeth,” as Homer says—the Wall and
Palisade <span id="fr_402"></span>[6](#fn_402.md) in which is the inner
man, fallen into it from the Primal Man, the Adamas Above—\[the Stone\]
“cut without hands” <span id="fr_403"></span>[7](#fn_403.md) cutting it,
and brought down into the plasm of forgetfulness, the earthy, clayey
\[plasm\].

\(15\) S. And <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says that)</span>
they followed Him squeaking <span id="fr_404"></span>[8](#fn_404.md)—the
souls, the Logos.

That is, <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> \[He led
them\] into the eternal lands free from all guile. For where <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> went they?

For He <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is
Ocean—“birth-causing of

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

gods and birth-causing of men” <span
id="fr_407"></span>[1](#fn_407.md)—flowing and ebbing for ever, now up and
now down.

J. When Ocean flows down <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span>, it is the birth-causing of men; and when \[it flows\] up,
towards the Wall and Palisade, and the “White Rock,” it is the
birth-causing of gods.

This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is what is
written:

“‘I have said ye are Gods and all Sons of the Highest’ <span
id="fr_408"></span>[2](#fn_408.md)—if ye hasten to flee from Egypt and get
you beyond the Red Sea into the Desert”; that is, from the intercourse
below to the Jerusalem Above, who is the Mother of the Living. <span
id="fr_409"></span>[3](#fn_409.md) “But if ye turn back again into
Egypt”—that is, to the intercourse below—“‘ye shall die like
men.’” <span id="fr_410"></span>[4](#fn_410.md)

For <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> all the
generation below is subject to death, but the \[birth\] begotten above
is superior to death.

<span style="font-size: small">C. For from water alone—that is,
spirit—is begotten the spiritual \[man\], not the fleshly; the lower
\[man\] is fleshly. That is (H. he says) what is written: “That which is
born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the spirit is
spirit.” <span id="fr_411"></span>[5](#fn_411.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. This is their <span
id="fr_412"></span>[6](#fn_412.md) spiritual birth. </span>

J. This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the Great
Jordan, which, flowing downwards and preventing the sons of Israel

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

from going forth out of Egypt, or from the intercourse below—

<span style="font-size: small">H. —for Egypt is the body, according to
them—</span>

J. —was turned back by Jesus <span id="fr_413"></span>[1](#fn_413.md) and
made to flow upwards.

<span style="font-size: small">H. Following after these and such like
\[follies\], these most wonderful “Gnostics,” discoverers of a new
grammatical art, imagine that their prophet Homer showed forth these
things arcanely; and, introducing those who are not initiated into the
Sacred Scriptures into such notions, they make a mock of them. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">And they say that he who says that all
things are from One, is in error, \[but\] he who says they are from
Three is right, and will furnish proof of the first principles \[of
things\]. <span id="fr_414"></span>[2](#fn_414.md) </span>

J. For one <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the
Blessed Nature of the Blessed Man Above, Adamas; and one is the
\[Nature\] Below, which is subject to Death; and one is the Race without
a king <span id="fr_415"></span>[3](#fn_415.md) which is born Above—where
<span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is Mariam the
sought-for, and Jothōr the great sage, and Sepphōra the seeing, and
Moses whose begetting is not in Egypt—for sons were born to him in
Madiam. <span id="fr_416"></span>[4](#fn_416.md)

S. And this <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> also did
not escape the notice of the poets:

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

“All things were threefold divided, and each received his share of
honour.” <span id="fr_417"></span>[1](#fn_417.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. For the Greatnesses (H. he says) needs
must be spoken, but so spoken by all everywhere, “that hearing they may
not hear, and seeing they may not see.” <span

J. For unless <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the
Greatnesses <span id="fr_419"></span>[3](#fn_419.md) were spoken, the
cosmos would not be able to hold together. These are the Three
More-than-mighty Words (*Logoi*): Kaulakau, Saulasau, Zeēsar;—Kaulakau,
the \[Logos\] Above, Adamas; Saulasau, the \[Logos\] Below; Zeēsar, the
Jordan flowing upwards. <span id="fr_420"></span>[4](#fn_420.md)

(17 <span id="fr_421"></span>[5](#fn_421).md) S. He <span

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

in all, whom the ignorant call three-bodied Gēryonēs—Earth-flow-er, as
though flowing from the earth; <span id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_422.md)
while the Greek \[*theologi*\] generally call Him the “Heavenly Horn of
Mēn,” <span id="fr_423"></span>[2](#fn_423.md) because He has mixed and
mingled <span id="fr_424"></span>[3](#fn_424.md) all things with all.

<span style="font-size: small">C. For “all things (H. he says) were made
through Him, and without Him no one thing was made that was made. In Him
is Life.” <span id="fr_425"></span>[4](#fn_425.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">This (H. he says) is “Life,” the
ineffable Race of perfect men, which was unknown to former generations.
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">And the “nothing” <span
id="fr_426"></span>[5](#fn_426.md) which hath been made “without Him,” is
the special cosmos; <span id="fr_427"></span>[6](#fn_427.md) for the latter

J. This <span id="fr_429"></span>[1](#fn_429.md) <span

Cup in which “the King drinketh and divineth.” <span

in the “fair seed” of Benjamin.

\(18\) S. The Greeks also speak of it <span style="font-size: small">(H.
he says)</span> with inspired tongue, as follows:

> “Bring water, bring \[me\] wine, boy!  
> Give me to drink, and sink me in slumber! <span

<span style="font-size: small">C. This (H. he says) would be sufficient
alone if men would understand—the Cup of Anacreon speaking forth
speechlessly the Ineffable Mystery. </span>

J. For <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> Anacreon’s Cup
is speechless—in as much as it tells him (says Anacreon) with speechless
sound of what Race he must be born—

alone to know—\[that is\] (H. he says) for us. </span>

J. For the Samothracians, in the Mysteries which are solemnised among
them, explicitly hand on the tradition that this Adam is the Man
Original.

S. Moreover, <span id="fr_438"></span>[2](#fn_438.md) in the initiation
temple of the Samothracians stand two statues of naked men, with both
hands raised to heaven and ithyphallic, like the statue of Hermes in

<span style="font-size: small">This (H. he says) is what was spoken by

each of His disciples is, and that it needs must be that each of them

says)</span> the Thracians who dwell round Haimos call Korybas, <span
id="fr_446"></span>[2](#fn_446.md) and the Phrygians in like manner with

Above <span id="fr_447"></span>[3](#fn_447.md)—

J. —and from the expressive Brain <span id="fr_448"></span>[4](#fn_448.md)—

S. —and passing through all the sources of all things beneath—how and in
what manner He descends we do not understand.

J. This is <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> what was
spoken:

“His Voice we heard, but His Form we have not seen.” <span
id="fr_449"></span>[5](#fn_449.md)

For <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the Voice of Him,
when He hath been delegated and expressed, is heard, but the Form that
descended from Above, from the Inexpressible \[Man\]—what it is, no one
knows. It is in the earthy plasm, but no one has knowledge of it.

This \[Man\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is He
who “inhabiteth the

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Flood,” <span
id="fr_450"></span>[1](#fn_450.md) according to the Psalter, who cries and
calls from “many waters.” <span id="fr_451"></span>[2](#fn_451.md)

The “many waters” <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> are
the manifold genesis of men subject to death, from which He shouts and
calls to the Inexpressible Man, saying:

“Save my \[? Thy\] alone-begotten from the lions.” <span
id="fr_452"></span>[3](#fn_452.md)

To this \[Man\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> it
hath been spoken:

“Thou art my Son, O Israel, <span id="fr_453"></span>[4](#fn_453.md) fear
not; should’st thou pass through rivers, they shall not engulph thee;
should’st thou pass through fire, it shall not consume thee.” <span

By “rivers” <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> he <span
id="fr_455"></span>[6](#fn_455.md) means the Moist Essence of Genesis, and
by “fire” the impulse and desire towards Genesis.

And: “Thou art mine; fear not.” <span id="fr_456"></span>[7](#fn_456.md)

And again he <span id="fr_457"></span>[8](#fn_457.md) says:

“If a mother forget her children so as not to take pity on them or give
them suck, \[then\] I too will forget you” <span
id="fr_458"></span>[9](#fn_458.md)—saith Adamas <span

“Nay, even if a woman shall forget them, I will not forget you. Upon my
hands have I graven you.” <span id="fr_459"></span>[10](#fn_459.md)

And concerning His Ascent—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —that is, his regeneration in order
that he may be born spiritual, not fleshly.</span>

J. —the Scripture saith <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span>:

“Lift up the gates, ye who are rulers of you, and be

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

ye lift up ye everlasting gates, and the King of Glory shall come
in.” <span id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_460.md)

This is a wonder of wonders.

“For who <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is this King
of Glory? <span id="fr_461"></span>[2](#fn_461.md) A worm <span
id="fr_462"></span>[3](#fn_462.md) and no man, the scorn of men, and the
contempt of the people. <span id="fr_463"></span>[4](#fn_463.md) He is the
King of Glory, the Mighty in War.” <span id="fr_464"></span>[5](#fn_464.md)

By “War” he <span id="fr_465"></span>[6](#fn_465.md) means the “\[war\] in
the body,” for the plasm is compounded of warring elements, as it is
written <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>:

“Remember the war that is \[warred\] in the body.” <span
id="fr_466"></span>[7](#fn_466.md)

This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the Entrance,
and this is the Gate, which Jacob saw, when he journeyed into
Mesopotamia. <span id="fr_467"></span>[8](#fn_467.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. Which is the passing from childhood to
puberty and manhood; that is, it was made known to him who journeyed
into Mesopotamia. </span>

J. And Meso-potamia <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>
is the Stream of Great Ocean flowing from the middle of the Perfect Man.

And he <span id="fr_468"></span>[9](#fn_468.md) marvelled at the Heavenly
Gate, saying:

“How terrible \[is\] this place! This is naught else than the House of
God; yea, this \[is\] the Gate of Heaven.” <span
id="fr_469"></span>[10](#fn_469.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. On this account (H. he says) Jesus
saith: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“I am the True Door.” <span
id="fr_470"></span>[11](#fn_470.md) </span>

J. And he <span id="fr_471"></span>[12](#fn_471.md) who says these things
is <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

the \[one\] from the Inexpressible Man, expressed from Above—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —as the perfect man. The not-perfect
man, therefore, cannot be saved unless he be regenerated passing through
this Gate. </span>

\(21\) S. This same \[Man\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> the Phrygians call also Papa; <span
id="fr_472"></span>[1](#fn_472.md) for He calmed <span
id="fr_473"></span>[2](#fn_473.md) all things which, prior to His own
manifestation, were in disorderly and inharmonious movement.

For the name Papa <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is
\[the\] Sound-of-all-things-together in Heaven, and on Earth, and
beneath the Earth, saying: “Calm, calm” <span
id="fr_474"></span>[3](#fn_474.md) the discord of the cosmos.

<span style="font-size: small">C. And: Make “peace for them that are
far”—that is, the material and earthy—“and peace for them that are
near” <span id="fr_475"></span>[4](#fn_475.md)—that is, the spiritual and
knowing and perfect men. </span>

\(22\) S. The Phrygians call Him also Dead—when buried in the body as
though in a tomb or sepulchre.

<span style="font-size: small">C. This (H. he says) is what is said:
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Ye are whited sepulchres, filled (H. he
says) within with bones of the dead, <span
id="fr_476"></span>[5](#fn_476.md) for Man, the Living \[One\] <span
id="fr_477"></span>[6](#fn_477.md) is not in you.” </span>

<span style="font-size: small">And again He says: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“The dead shall leap forth from their
graves” <span id="fr_478"></span>[7](#fn_478.md)—</span>

<span style="font-size: small">—that is, from their earthy bodies,
regenerated spiritual, not fleshly. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">This (H. he says) is the Resurrection
which takes place</span>

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

<span style="font-size: small">through the Gate of the Heavens, through
which all those who do not pass (H. he says) remain Dead. </span>

S. The same Phrygians again call this very same \[Man\], after the
transformation, God \[or a God\]. <span id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_479.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. For he becomes (H. he says) God when,
rising from the Dead, through such a Gate, he shall pass into Heaven.
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">This is the Gate (H. he says) which Paul,
the Apostle, knew, setting it ajar in a mystery, and saying that he was
caught up by an angel and came to the second, nay the third heaven, into
Paradise itself, and saw what he saw, and heard ineffable words, which
it is not lawful for man to utter. <span
id="fr_480"></span>[2](#fn_480.md)</span>

<span style="font-size: small">These (H. he says) are the Mysteries,
ineffable \[yet\] spoken of by all,—</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“—which \[also we speak, yet\] not in
words taught of human wisdom, but in \[words\] taught of Spirit,
comparing things spiritual with spiritual things. But the psychic man
receiveth not the things of God’s Spirit, for they are foolishness unto
him.” <span id="fr_481"></span>[3](#fn_481.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">And these (H. he says) are the Ineffable
Mysteries of the Spirit which we alone know. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">Concerning these (H. he says) the Saviour
said: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“No one is able to come to Me, unless my
Heavenly Father draw him.” <span id="fr_482"></span>[4](#fn_482.md)</span>

<span style="font-size: small">For it is exceedingly difficult (H. he
says) to receive and accept this Great Ineffable Mystery. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">And again (H. he says) the Saviour said:
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Not every one that saith unto Me, Lord,
Lord! shall enter into the Kingdom of the Heavens, but he who doeth the
Will of My Father who is in the Heavens” <span
id="fr_483"></span>[5](#fn_483.md)—</span>

<span style="font-size: small">—which \[Will\] they must do, and not
hear only, to enter into the Kingdom of the Heavens. </span>

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

<span style="font-size: small">And again He said (H. he says): </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“The tax-gatherers and harlots go before
you into the Kingdom of the Heavens.” <span
id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_484.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">For by “tax-gatherers” (τελῶναι) are
meant (H. he says) those who receive the consummations <span
id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_485) (τέλη.md) of the universal \[principles\];
and we (H. he says) are the “tax-gatherers” <span
id="fr_486"></span>[3](#fn_486.md) \[upon whom the consummations of the
æons have come” <span id="fr_487"></span>[4](#fn_487.md)\]. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">For the “consummations” (H. he says) are
the Seeds disseminated into the cosmos from the Inexpressible \[Man\],
by means of which the whole cosmos is consummated; for by means of these
also it began to be. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">And this (H. he says) is what is said:
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“The Sower went forth to sow. And some
\[Seeds\] fell by the way-side, and were trodden under foot; and others
on stony places, and they sprang up (H. he says), but because they had
no depth, they withered and died. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Others (H. he says) fell on the fair and
good ground, and brought forth fruit—one a hundred, another sixty, and
another thirty. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“He who hath (H. he says) ears to hear,
let him hear!” <span id="fr_488"></span>[5](#fn_488.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">That is (H. he says), no one has been a
hearer of these Mysteries, save only the gnostic, perfect
\[man\].</span>

<span style="font-size: small">This (H. he says) is the “fair and good
ground” of which Moses saith: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“I will bring you into a fair and good
land, into a land flowing with milk and honey.” <span
id="fr_489"></span>[6](#fn_489.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">This (H. he says) is the “honey and milk”
by tasting which the perfect \[men\] become free from all rule, <span
id="fr_490"></span>[7](#fn_490.md) and share in the Fullness. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">This (H. he says) is the Fullness whereby
all things that are generated both are and are full-filled from the
Ingenerable \[Man\]. </span>

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

\(23\) S. This same \[Man\] is called by the Phrygians Unfruitful.

<span style="font-size: small">C. For He is unfruitful as long as He is
fleshly and works the work of the flesh. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">This (H. he says) is what is said:
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Every tree that beareth not good fruit,
is cut down and cast into the fire.” <span
id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_491.md) </span>

<span style="font-size: small">For these “fruits” (H. he says) are the
*logic,* <span id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_492.md) living men only who pass
through the third Gate. <span id="fr_493"></span>[3](#fn_493.md) </span>

J. At anyrate they <span id="fr_494"></span>[4](#fn_494.md) say:

“If ye have eaten dead things and made living ones, what will ye make if
ye eat living things?” <span id="fr_495"></span>[5](#fn_495.md)

And by “living things” they mean *logoi* and minds and men—the “pearls”
of that Inexpressible \[Man\] cast into the plasm below. <span
id="fr_496"></span>[6](#fn_496.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. This is what He saith (H. he says):
</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Cast not the holy thing to the dogs nor
the pearls to the swine.” <span id="fr_497"></span>[7](#fn_497.md)</span>

<span style="font-size: small">H. For they say that the work of swine is
the intercourse of man with woman. </span>

(24 <span id="fr_498"></span>[8](#fn_498).md) S. This same \[Man\] <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the Phrygians also call
Ai-polos; <span id="fr_499"></span>[9](#fn_499.md) not because <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> He feeds

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

she-goats and he-goats, as the <span
style="font-size: small">(C.—psychics <span
id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_500).md)</span> interpret the name, but because
<span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> He is Aei-polos—that
is, “Always-turning” (Aei-polōn), <span id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_501.md)
revolving and driving round the whole cosmos in \[its\] revolution; for
*polein* is to “turn” and change things.

Hence <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> all call the
two centres <span id="fr_502"></span>[3](#fn_502.md) of heaven poles. And
the poet also <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> when he
says: “Hither there comes and there goes (*pōleitai*) Old Man of the
Sea, whose words are e’er true—Egypt’s undying Prōteus.” <span
id="fr_503"></span>[4](#fn_503.md)

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

\[By *pōleitai*\] he does not mean “he is put on sale,” <span
id="fr_504"></span>[1](#fn_504.md) but “he turns about” \[or comes and
goes\] there,—as though it were, \[he spins\] and goes round.

And the cities in which we live, in that we turn about and circulate in
them, are called *poleis*.

Thus <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the Phrygians
call Aipolos this \[Man\] who turns all things at all times all ways,
and changes them into things kin.

\(25\) The Phrygians, moreover <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span>, call Him Fruitful.

J. For <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>:

“Many more are the children of the desolate \[woman\] than of her who
hath her husband.” <span id="fr_505"></span>[2](#fn_505.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. That is, the regenerated, deathless,
and ever-continuing \[children\] are many, although few are they
\[thus\] generated; but the fleshly (H. he says) all perish, though many
are they \[thus\] generated. </span>

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

<span style="font-size: small">C. For this cause (H. he says): </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Rachel bewailed her children, and would
not (H. he says) be comforted weeping over them; for she knew (H. he
says) that they are not.” <span id="fr_506"></span>[1](#fn_506.md)</span>

J. And Jeremiah also laments the Jerusalem Below—not the city in
Phœnicia, <span id="fr_507"></span>[2](#fn_507.md) but the generation
below—which is subject to destruction.

<span style="font-size: small">C. For Jeremiah also (H. he says) knew
the perfect man, regenerated from water and spirit, not fleshly. </span>

J. At anyrate the same Jeremiah said:

“He is man, and who shall know him?” <span
id="fr_508"></span>[3](#fn_508.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. Thus (H. he says) the knowledge of the
perfect man is deep and hard to comprehend. </span>

J. For “The beginning of Perfection <span style="font-size: small">(H.
he says)</span> is Gnosis of man, but Gnosis of God is perfect
Perfection.” <span id="fr_509"></span>[4](#fn_509.md)

\(26\) S. And the Phrygians <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> call Him also “Plucked Green Wheat-ear”; and after the
Phrygians the Athenians \[so designate Him\], when, in the secret rites
at Eleusis, they show those who receive in silence the final initiation
there into the Great—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —and marvellous and most
perfect—</span>

S. —Epoptic Mystery, a plucked wheat-ear. <span
id="fr_510"></span>[5](#fn_510.md)

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

And this Wheat-ear is also with the Athenians the Light-giver <span
id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_511.md)—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —perfect \[and\] mighty—</span>

J. —from the Inexpressible—

S. —as the hierophant himself—not emasculated like the “Attis,” <span
id="fr_512"></span>[2](#fn_512.md) but made eunuch with hemlock juice—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —and divorced from all fleshly
generation—</span>

S. —in the night, at Eleusis, solemnising the Great Ineffable Mysteries,
when the bright light streams forth, <span
id="fr_513"></span>[3](#fn_513.md) shouts and cries aloud, saying:

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

“\[Our\] Lady hath brought forth a Holy Son: Brimō \[hath given birth\]
to Brimos”—

—that is, the Strong to the Strong.

\(27\) J. And “\[Our\] Lady” <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> is the Genesis—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —the Spiritual, Heavenly
\[Genesis\]—</span>

J. —Above. And the Strong is he who is thus generated.

For it is the Mystery called “Eleusis” and “Anaktoreion”;—“Eleusis,”
because we—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —the spiritual—</span>

J. —come <span id="fr_514"></span>[2](#fn_515.md) from Above, streaming
down from Adamas, for *eleus-esthai* <span style="font-size: small">(H.
he says)</span> is “to come”; and “Anaktoreion” \[from *anag-esthai,*
“leading back,” that is <span id="fr_515"></span>[3](#fn_516.md)\] from
“returning” <span id="fr_516"></span>[4](#fn_517.md) Above. <span
id="fr_517"></span>[5](#fn_518.md)

This \[Return\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is
that of which those who are initiated into the great Mysteries of the
Eleusinia speak.

\(28\) S. And the law is that after they have been initiated into the
Little Mysteries, they should be further initiated into the Great.

“For greater deaths do greater lots obtain.” <span
id="fr_518"></span>[6](#fn_519.md)

The Little <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> are the
Mysteries of

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Persephonē Below;
concerning which Mysteries and the way leading there and—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —being broad and wide,—</span>

—taking \[men\] to Persephonē, the poet also speaks:

> “Beneath this there is another path death-cold,  
> Hollow and clayey. But this <span id="fr_519"></span>[1](#fn_520.md) is
> best to lead  
> To grove delightsome of far-honoured Aphroditē.” <span
> id="fr_520"></span>[2](#fn_521.md)

These <span id="fr_521"></span>[3](#fn_522.md) are <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the Little Mysteries—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —those of the fleshly
generation—</span>

S. —and after men have been initiated into them, they should cease for a
little, and become initiated in the Great—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —heavenly \[Mysteries\]. </span>

S. For they to whom the “deaths” in them <span
id="fr_522"></span>[4](#fn_523.md) are appointed, “receive greater lots.”

J. For this \[Mystery\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> is the Gate of Heaven, and this is the House of God, where
the Good God dwells alone; into which \[House\] <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> no impure \[man\] shall
come—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —no psychic, no fleshly
\[man\]—</span>

J. —but it is kept under watch for the spiritual alone; where when they
come, they must cast away their garments, and all become bridegrooms,
obtaining their true manhood <span id="fr_523"></span>[5](#fn_524.md)
through the Virginal Spirit.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

For this <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the
Virgin big with child, conceiving and bearing a Son <span
id="fr_524"></span>[1](#fn_525.md)—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —not psychic, not fleshly, but a
blessed Æon of Æons. <span id="fr_525"></span>[2](#fn_526.md)</span>

<span style="font-size: small">Concerning these \[Mysteries\] (H. he
says) the Saviour hath explicitly said that: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Narrow and strait is the Way that
leadeth to Life, and few are they who enter it; but broad and wide
\[is\] the Way that leadeth to Destruction, and many are they who
journey thereby.” <span id="fr_526"></span>[3](#fn_527.md) </span>

S. <span id="fr_527"></span>[4](#fn_528.md) Moreover, also, the Phrygians
say that the Father of wholes <span id="fr_528"></span>[5](#fn_529.md) is
Amygdalos <span id="fr_529"></span>[6](#fn_530.md)—

J. —no \[ordinary\] tree <span id="fr_530"></span>[7](#fn_531.md) <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>; but that He is that
Amygdalos the Pre-existing, who having in Himself the Perfect Fruit, as
it were, throbbing <span id="fr_531"></span>[8](#fn_532.md) and moving in
\[His\] Depth, He tore asunder <span id="fr_532"></span>[9](#fn_533.md) His
Womb, and gave birth to His own Son <span
id="fr_533"></span>[10](#fn_534.md)—

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

<span style="font-size: small">C. —the Invisible, Unnameable, and
Ineffable \[One\] of whom we tell. <span id="fr_534"></span>[1](#fn_535.md)
</span>

S. For “*amyxai*” <span id="fr_535"></span>[2](#fn_536.md) is, as it were,
“to break” and “cut open”; just as <span style="font-size: small">(H. he
says)</span> in the case of inflamed bodies and those which have some
internal tumour, when physicians lance them, they speak of
“*amychas.*” <span id="fr_536"></span>[3](#fn_537.md)

Thus <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the Phrygians
call him Amygdalos.

<span style="font-size: small">C. From whom proceeded and was born the
Invisible—</span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Through whom all things were made, and
without whom nothing was made.” <span id="fr_537"></span>[4](#fn_538.md)
</span>

\(30\) S. The Phrygians also say that that which is generated from Him
is Syriktēs. <span id="fr_538"></span>[5](#fn_539.md)

J. For that which is generated is Spirit in harmony. <span
id="fr_539"></span>[6](#fn_540.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. For “God (H. he says) is
Spirit.” <span id="fr_540"></span>[7](#fn_541.md)</span>

<span style="font-size: small">Wherefore He says: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“Neither in this mountain do the true
worshippers worship, nor in Jerusalem, but in Spirit.” <span
id="fr_541"></span>[8](#fn_542.md) </span>

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

<span style="font-size: small">For the worship of the perfect \[men\]
(H. he says) is spiritual, not fleshly. </span>

J. And “Spirit” <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is
there where both Father and Son are named, generated there from
Him <span id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_543.md) and the Father.

S. He <span id="fr_543"></span>[2](#fn_544.md) <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the Many-named,
Myriad-eyed, Incomprehensible, whom every nature desires, some one way,
some another.

J. This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the
Word <span id="fr_544"></span>[3](#fn_545.md) of God, which is:

“The Word of Announcement of the Great Power. Wherefore It shall be
sealed, and hidden, and concealed, stored in the Habitation, where the
Root of the Universals has its foundation—

“Of Æons, Powers, Intelligences, Gods, Angels, Spirits Delegate,
Existing Non-existences, Generated Ingenerables, Comprehensible
Incomprehensibles,—Years, Months, Days, Hours,—of \[the\] Boundless
Point, from which the most minute begins to increase by parts. <span
id="fr_545"></span>[4](#fn_546.md)

“For <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> the Point which
is nothing and is composed of nothing, though partless, will become by

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

means of its own Thought a Greatness <span
id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_547.md) beyond our own comprehension.”

<span style="font-size: small">C. This \[Point\] (H. he says) is the
Kingdom of the Heavens, the “grain of mustard seed,” <span
id="fr_547"></span>[2](#fn_548.md) the partless point, the first existing
for the body; which no one (H. he says) knows save the spiritual \[men\]
alone. </span>

J. This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is what is
said:

“They are neither words nor languages whereby their <span

<span style="font-size: small">H. These things, \[then,\] which are said

S. For example <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>, when
the people assemble in the theatres, and a man comes on the stage, clad
in a robe different from all others, with lute <span
id="fr_552"></span>[7](#fn_553.md) in hand on which he plays, and thus
chants the Great Mysteries, not knowing what he says: <span

> “Whether blest Child of Kronos,  
> or of Zeus, or of Great Rhea,—  
> Hail, Attis, thou mournful song <span id="fr_554"></span>[9](#fn_555.md)
> of Rhea!

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

> Assyrians call thee thrice-longed-for Adōnis;  
> all Egypt \[calls thee\] Osiris;

<span style="font-size: small">H. He \[S.\] says that this is the Attis

##### HIPPOLYTUS’ CONCLUSION

<span style="font-size: small">H. For these and suchlike reasons these
\[Naassenes\] frequent what are called the Mysteries of the Great
Mother, believing that they obtain the clearest view of the Universal
Mystery from the things done in them. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">For they have nothing beyond the
\[mysteries\] therein enacted except that they are not emasculated.
Their sole “accomplishment,” \[however,\] is the business of the Eunuch,
for they most severely and vigilantly enjoin to abstain, as though
emasculated, from intercourse with women. And the rest of their
business, as we have stated at length, they carry out just like the
Eunuchs. </span>

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

<span style="font-size: small">And they honour nothing else but
“Naas,” <span id="fr_559"></span>[1](#fn_560.md) being called Naasseni. And
Naas is the Serpent—</span>

J. <span id="fr_560"></span>[2](#fn_561.md)—from whom <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> are all those \[things\]
called *naous* <span id="fr_561"></span>[3](#fn_562.md) under heaven, from
*naas*.

To that Naas alone every shrine and every rite of initiation and every
mystery <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is dedicated;
and, in general, no initiation can be found under heaven in which a
*naos* does not play a part, and \[also\] the *Naas* in it, from which
it has got the name of *naos*.

<span style="font-size: small">(H. Moreover, they say that)</span> the
Serpent is the Moist Essence—

<span style="font-size: small">H. —just as \[did\] also Thales the
Milesian <span id="fr_562"></span>[4](#fn_563.md)—</span>

J. —and <span style="font-size: small">(H. that)</span> naught at all of
existing things, immortal or mortal, animate or inanimate, can hold
together without Him.

\[And they say\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. that)</span> all
things are subject to Him, and <span style="font-size: small">(H.
that)</span> He is Good, and has all things in Him as in “the horn of
the one-horned bull”; <span id="fr_563"></span>[5](#fn_564.md) so that He
distributes beauty and bloom to all that exist according to each one’s
nature and peculiarity, as though permeating all, just as \[the River\]
“proceeding forth out of Eden and dividing itself into four
sources.” <span id="fr_564"></span>[6](#fn_565.md)

<span style="font-size: small">H. And they say that Eden is His Brain,
as though it were bound and constricted in its surrounding vestures like
heavens; while Paradise they consider to be the Man as far as His Head
only. </span>

This River, then, coming forth out of Eden <span
style="font-size: small">(H. that is, from His Brain),</span> is divided
into four streams.

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

And the name of the first river is called Pheisōn. “This is that which
encircles all the land of Evilat, there where is the gold, and the gold
of that land is fair; there too is the ruby and the green stone.” <span
id="fr_565"></span>[1](#fn_566.md)

This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is His Eye—by
its dignity and colours bearing witness to what is said.

The name of the second river is Geōn. “This is that which encircles all
the land of Æthiopia.” <span id="fr_566"></span>[2](#fn_567.md)

This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is \[His organ
of\] Hearing; for it is labyrinth-like.

And the name of the third is Tigris. “This is that which flows the
opposite way to the Assyrians.” <span id="fr_567"></span>[3](#fn_568.md)

This <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is \[His organ
of\] Smell, for the current of it is very rapid; and it “flows the
opposite way to the Assyrians,” because after the breath is breathed
out, on breathing in again, the breath that is drawn in from without,
from the air, comes in more rapidly, and with greater force. For this
<span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the nature of
respiration.

“And the fourth river \[is\] Euphratēs.” <span
id="fr_568"></span>[4](#fn_569.md)

This <span style="font-size: small">(H. they say)</span> \[is\] the
mouth, through which by the utterance of prayer and entrance of food,
the <span style="font-size: small">(? C.—spiritual, perfect)</span> man
is rejoiced, and nourished and expressed. <span
id="fr_569"></span>[5](#fn_570.md)

This \[River\] <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> is the
Water above the Firmament. <span id="fr_570"></span>[6](#fn_571.md)

<span style="font-size: small">C. Concerning which (H. he says) the
Saviour hath said: </span>

<span style="font-size: small">“If thou hadst known Who it is Who
asketh, thou wouldst have asked from Him \[in return\], and He would
have given thee to drink of Living Water bubbling \[forth\].” <span

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

J. To this Water <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>
every nature comes, each selecting its own essence, and from this Water
there comes to each nature what is proper \[to it\] <span
style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>, more surely than iron to

<span style="font-size: small">C. And if any man (H. he says) is “blind

“the True Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the
world,” <span id="fr_575"></span>[4](#fn_576.md)—let him see again through
us, and let him see as it were through—</span>

J. <span id="fr_576"></span>[5](#fn_577.md) —Paradise, planted with Trees
and all kinds of seeds, the Water flowing amid all the Trees and Seeds,
and \[then\] shall he see that from one and the same Water the Olive
selects and draws Oil, and the Vine Wine, and each of the rest of the
Trees according to its kind.

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

But <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span> that Man is of no
honour in the World, though of great honour \[in Heaven,
betrayed\] <span id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_578.md) by those who know not
to those who know Him not, being accounted “as a drop from a
cask.” <span id="fr_578"></span>[2](#fn_579.md)

But we <span style="font-size: small">(H. he says)</span>—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —are the spiritual \[men\] who—</span>

J. —choose for ourselves from—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —the Living Water—</span>

J. —the Euphrates, that flows through the midst of Babylon, what is
proper \[to each of us\]—journeying through the True Gate—

<span style="font-size: small">C. —which is Jesus the Blessed. </span>

<span style="font-size: small">And of all men we alone are
Christians, <span id="fr_579"></span>[3](#fn_580.md) accomplishing the
Mystery at the third Gate—</span>

J. —and being anointed with the Ineffable Chrism from the Horn, <span
id="fr_580"></span>[4](#fn_581.md) like David \[was\], not from the

<span style="font-size: small">C. —who was fellow-citizen with an evil

<span style="font-size: small">H. These things, then, we have set down

##### CONCLUSION OF ANALYSIS

All this may have seemed, quite naturally, contemptible foolishness to
the theological prejudices of our worthy Church Father; but it is
difficult for me, even in the twentieth century, not to recognise the
beauty of this fine Mystic Hymn, and I hope it may be equally difficult
for at least some of my readers.

But to return to the consideration of our much overwritten Source.

This Source is plainly a commentary, or elaborate paraphrase, of the
Recitation Ode, “Whether, blest Child of Kronos,” which comes at the end
(§ 30) and not, as we should expect, at the beginning, and has probably
been displaced by Hippolytus. It is an exegetical

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

commentary written from the standpoint of the Anthrōpos-theory of the
Mysteries (? originally Chaldæan), the Man-doctrine.

This commentary seems for the most part to run on so connectedly, that
we can almost persuade ourselves that we have most of it before us, the
*lacunæ* being practically insignificant. Paragraphs 6 and 7 S.,
however, are plainly misplaced, and §§ 17 and 18 S. also as evidently
break the connection. <span id="fr_594"></span>[1](#fn_595.md)

##### THE HELLENIST COMMENTATOR

The writer is transparently a man learned in the various Mystery-rites,
and his information is of the greatest possible importance for a study
of this exceedingly obscure subject from an historical standpoint.

With § 8 S., and the Egyptian Mystery-doctrine, we come to what is of
peculiar interest for our present Trismegistic studies. Osiris is the
Heavenly Man, the Logos; not only so, but in straitest connection with
this tradition we have an exposition of the Hermes-doctrine, set forth
by a system of allegorical interpretations of the Bible of Hellas—the
Poems of the Homeric cycle. Here we have the evident *syncrasia* Thoth =
Osiris = Hermes, a Hermes of the “Greek Wisdom,” as the Recitation Ode
phrases it, and a doctrine which H., basing himself on the commentator
(§ 10), squarely asserts the Greeks got from Egypt.

Nor is it without importance for us that in closest connection with
Hermes there follow the apparently misplaced sections 17 and 18, dealing
with the “Heavenly Horn,” or drinking-horn, of the Greek Wisdom, and the
“Cup” of Anacreon; with which we may compare the *Crater,* Mixing-bowl
or Cup, in which,

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

according to Plato’s *Timæus,* the Creator mingled and mixed the
elements and souls, and also the spiritual Cup of the Mind in our
Trismegistic treatise, “The Crater or Monas,” *C. H.,* iv. (v.).

But above all things is it astonishing that we should find the
commentator in S. quoting (§ 9) a *logos* from a document which, as we
have shown in the note appended to the passage, is in every probability
a Trismegistic treatise of the Pœmandres type.

##### THE JEWISH AND CHRISTIAN OVERWRITERS

This commentary S. was worked over by a Jewish Hellenistic mystic J.,
whose general ideas and method of exegesis are exactly paralleled by
those of Philo. In my opinion, he was a contemporary of that period and
a member of one of those communities whom Philo classes generally as
Therapeut. He was, moreover, not a worshipper of the serpent, but a
worshipper of that Glorious Reality symbolised as the Serpent of Wisdom,
and this connects him with initiation into Egypto-Chaldæan or
Chaldæo-Egyptian Mysteries. These he finds set forth allegorically in
the prophetical scriptures of his race. His quotations from the LXX.
show him to be, like Philo, an Alexandrian Hellenistic Jew; the LXX. was
his Targum.

J. again was overwritten by C., a Christian Gnostic, no enemy of either
J. or S., but one who claimed that he and his were the true realisers of
all that had gone before; he is somewhat boastful, but yet recognises
that the Christ-doctrine is not an innovation but a consummation. The
phenomena presented by the New Testament quotations of C. are, in my
opinion, of extraordinary interest, especially his quotations from or
parallels with the Fourth Gospel. His quotations from

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

or parallels with the Synoptics are almost of the same nature as those
of Justin; he is rather dealing with “Memoirs of the Apostles” than with
verbatim quotations from our stereotyped Gospels. His parallels with the
Fourth Gospel also seem to me to open up the question as to whether or
no he is in touch with “Sources” of that “Johannine” document.

On top of all our strata and deposits, we have—to continue the metaphor
of excavation, and if it be not thought somewhat uncharitable—the
refutatory rubbish of Hippolytus, which need no longer detain us here.

I would, therefore, suggest that C. is to be placed somewhere about the
middle of the second century A.D.; J. is contemporary with Philo—say the
first quarter of the first century A.D.; the Pagan commentator of S. is
prior to J.—say somewhere in the last half of the first century B.C.;
while the Recitation Ode is still earlier, and can therefore be placed
anywhere in the early Hellenistic period, the *termini* being thus
300-50 B.C. <span id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_596.md)

And if the redactor or commentator in S. is to be placed somewhere in
the last half of the first century B.C. (and this is, of course, taking
only the *minimum* of liberty), then the Pœmandres type of our
literature, which J. quotes as scripture, must, in its original Greek
form, be placed back of that—say at least in the first half of the first
century B.C., as a moderate estimate. <span
id="fr_596"></span>[2](#fn_597.md) If those dates are not proved,

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I am at anyrate
fairly confident they cannot be disproved.

##### ZOSIMUS AND THE ANTHROPOS-DOCTRINE

That, moreover, the Anthrōpos-doctrine, to the spirit of which the whole
commentary of our S. exegete is accommodated, was also fundamental with
the adherents of the Trismegistic tradition, may be clearly seen from
the interesting passage (which we give in the Fragments at the end of
the third Volume) of Zosimus, a member of what Reitzenstein calls the
Pœmandres Community, who flourished somewhere at the end of the third
and beginning of the fourth century A.D. <span
id="fr_597"></span>[1](#fn_598.md)

The sources of Zosimus for the Anthrōpos-doctrine, he tells us, are, in
addition to the Books of Hermes, certain translations into Greek and
Egyptian of books containing traditions (mystery-traditions, presumably)
of the Chaldæans, Parthians, Medes, and Hebrews on the subject. This
statement is of the very first importance for the history of Gnosticism
as well as for appreciating certain elements in Trismegisticism. Though
the indication of this literature is vague, it nevertheless mentions
four factors as involved in the Hebrew tradition; the Gnostic Hebrews,
as we should

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

expect, were handing on elements from Chaldæan, Parthian, and Median
traditions. Translations of these books were to be found scattered
throughout Egypt, and especially in the great library at Alexandria.

There is, in my opinion, no necessity precisely, with Reitzenstein (p.
106, n. 6), to designate these books the “Ptolemaic Books,” and so to
associate them with a notice found in the apocryphal “Eighth Book of
Moses,” where, together with that of the *Archangelic Book of Moses,*
there is mention of the Fifth Book of the “Ptolemaic Books,” described
as a book of multifarious wisdom under the title “One and All,” and
containing the account of the “Genesis of Fire and Darkness.” <span
id="fr_598"></span>[1](#fn_599.md)

Another source of Zosimus was the *Pinax* of Bitos or Bitys, of whom we
shall treat in considering the information of Jamblichus.

From all of these indications we are assured that there was already in
the first centuries B.C. a well-developed Hellenistic doctrine of the
descent of man from the Man Above, and of his return to that heavenly
state by his mastery of the powers of the cosmos.

##### PHILO OF ALEXANDRIA ON THE MAN-DOCTRINE

This date is further confirmed by the testimony of Philo (*c.* 30
B.C.-45 A.D.).

For, quoting the verse: “We are all sons of One Man,” <span
id="fr_599"></span>[2](#fn_600.md) he addresses those who are “companions
of wisdom and knowledge” as those who are “Sons of one and the same
Father—no mortal father, but an immortal Sire, the Man of God, who being
the Reason (*Logos*) of the Eternal, is of necessity himself
eternal.” <span id="fr_600"></span>[3](#fn_601.md)

And again, a little further on:

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

“And if a man should not as yet have the good fortune to be worthy to be
called Son of God, let him strive manfully to set himself in order <span
id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_602.md) according to His First-born Reason
(*Logos*), the Oldest Angel, who is as though it were the Angel-chief of
many names; for he is called Dominion, and Name of God, and Reason, and
Man-after-His-Likeness, and Seeing Israel.

“And for this reason I was induced a little before to praise the
principles of those who say: ‘We are all sons of One Man.’ For even if
we have not yet become fit to be judged Sons of God, we may at any rate
be Sons of His Eternal Likeness, His Most Holy Reason (*Logos*); for
Reason, the Eldest of all Angels, is God’s Likeness \[or Image\].” <span
id="fr_602"></span>[2](#fn_603.md)

Thus Philo gives us additional proof, if more were needed, for the full
Anthrōpos-doctrine was evidently fundamental in his circle—that is to
say, in the thought-atmosphere of the Hellenistic theology, or the
religio-philosophy, or theosophy, of his day, the beginning of the first
century A.D.

This date alone is sufficient for our purpose; but it is not too bold a
statement even to say that the Man-Mystery was a fundamental concept of
the brilliant period of the Hellenistic syncretism which succeeded to
the founding of Alexandria—the period of the expansion of Hellas beyond
her national borders; in other words, her birth into the greater world.

It is enough to know that the Mystery was hidden and yet revealed in the
shadow-garments of Chaldæan, Babylonian, Magian, Phœnician, Hebrew,
Egyptian, Phrygian, Thracian, and Greek mystery-traditions. It was, in
brief, fundamental in all such wisdom-shows, and necessarily so, for it
was the Christ-Mystery.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[147:7](th110.htm#fr_324.md) Celsus (c. 150-175
A.D.) knows of groups of Harpocratians—that is, worshippers of
Horus—some of whom derived their tradition from Salōmē, others from
Mariamnē, and others again from Martha (Origen, *C. Celsum,* v. 62).
This suggests an Egyptian setting. (For Salome and Maria or Miriam
(Mariamnē), the Sisters of Jesus, see *D. J. L.,* 405 f .; for Martha,
Our Lady, see *ibid.,* 375 ff.) In the Gnostic *Acts of Philip,*
Mariamnē, or Mariammē (both forms being found in the MSS., according to
R. A. Lipsius, *Die apokr. Apostelgeschichten*—Brunswick, 1884—iii. 12),
is the “virgin sister” of Philip, and plays an important *rôle* as
prophetess. She is to Philip as Thekla to Paul, or Helen to Simon.
Compare with this the “sister wife” whom Paul demands the right to take
about like “the rest of the Apostles and the Brethren of the Lord and
Cephas” (1 Corinth. ix. 5; *D. J. L.,* 229). Salmon (art. “Mariamne” in
Smith and Wace’s *D. of Christ. Biog.,* iii. 830) refers to the Mary
(Magdalene) of the *Pistis Sophia,* the chief questioner of the Master
and His favourite disciple, the sister of Martha. The tradition of the
Gnosis from James, the Brother of the Lord, is asserted by Clement of
Alexandria in Book VI. of his lost work, *The Institutions,* where he
writes: “The Lord imparted the Gnosis to James the Just, to John and
Peter, after His resurrection; these delivered it to the rest of the
Apostles, and they to the Seventy” (Euseb., *Hist. Eccles.,* ii. 1; *cf.
D. J. L.,* 226).

<span id="fn_325"></span>[148:1](th110.htm#fr_325.md) From here onwards we
use the revised critical text of Reitzenstein (pp. 83-98), who appends
what we may call an *apparatus criticus* of the emendations and
conjectures of the various editions of our solitary MS. R., as usual,
however, gives no translation.

<span id="fn_326"></span>[148:2](th110.htm#fr_326.md) Is. liii. 8—same
reading as LXX. *Cf.* also 25 § J.

<span id="fn_327"></span>[148:3](th110.htm#fr_327.md) A remark of the
writer of S., which, as we shall see at the end, is divided into Texts
and Commentary.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[148:4](th110.htm#fr_328.md) The “he says” may be
ascribed to any subsequent hand; I have marked them all H. to avoid
further complication.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[149:1](th110.htm#fr_329.md) “Burstings forth,”
inspirations, revealings, or mysteries.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[149:2](th110.htm#fr_330.md) In Greek
transformation, son of Apollo and the daughter of Minos, born in Libya.
This points to a very ancient myth-connection with the old Cretan
civilisation. Garamas was also called Amphithemis (q.v. in Roscher’s
*Lex*.); he appears also, according to one tradition, to have been the
father of Ammon. (See “Garamantis Nympha,” *ibid*.)

<span id="fn_331"></span>[149:3](th110.htm#fr_331.md) This passage is
doubly interesting, for it is not only a source, but a source within a
source. Already a number of scholars have recognised it as an Ode; and
not only so, but conjectured with much probability that it is by no less
a master than Pindar himself. Nay, further, it is part of a Hymn to
Jupiter Ammon—an additionally interesting point for us as showing strong
Egyptian influence. It is true that in our text of Hippolytus the order
of the words has been frequently changed to bring it into prose form;
but the reconstruction of most of it is not difficult, and quite
convincing. I translate from the text of Bergk’s final revision, as
given S. 134, 135; C. 142. R., for some reason or other, does not refer
to this interesting side-light.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[150:7](th110.htm#fr_338.md) This is a further
indication of the environment of the Naassenes. *Cf.* *C. H.,* x. (xi.)
7.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[150:8](th110.htm#fr_339.md) That is from Man
(Father), Man Son of Man (Son), or Flowing Chaos (Mother)—corresponding
in Hellenic mythology to Kronos, Zeus, and Rhea. For Rhea (from ρέειν,
“to flow”) is the Moist or Liquid Nature, as with the Stoics; she is the
*a*-cosmic or unordered Earth, the Prima Materia (the First Earth, the
Spouse of Heaven—Uranus), Hyle Proper, who carries in her bosom the
Logos. For references, see R., p. 99, n. 2.

<span id="fn_340"></span>[151:1](th110.htm#fr_340.md) *Cf.* Ex. viii. 8.

<span id="fn_341"></span>[151:2](th110.htm#fr_341.md) The preceding
paragraph is evidently composed of selections from S. R. (p. 85, n. 1)
thinks that we have here the description of only one aspect of Soul, and
that the description of the remaining two aspects has been omitted by H.

<span id="fn_342"></span>[151:3](th110.htm#fr_342.md) *Sc.* the Naassenes,
in H.’s view.

<span id="fn_343"></span>[152:1](th110.htm#fr_343.md) μορφῆς—lit., either
form or beauty.

<span id="fn_344"></span>[152:2](th110.htm#fr_344.md) *Sc.* of cosmos.

<span id="fn_345"></span>[152:3](th110.htm#fr_345.md) This paragraph and §
7, together with the accompanying overworkings, seem to have been
misplaced by H., according to R. (pp. 99, 100).  
  
The sudden introduction of the name Attis without any preliminaries,
indicates another *lacuna*; the transition from the Assyrian to the
Phrygian Mysteries of the Great Mother is too brusque.

<span id="fn_346"></span>[152:4](th110.htm#fr_346.md) The threefold nature
of the Soul is thus distinguished by: (i.) The union (or marriage) which
joins it to generation, or to earth-life—the nature of things on earth;
(ii.) The union which joins it with death—the nature of the things
“beneath” the earth; (iii.) The union which joins it with formal beauty,
or beauty in form (μορφή)—the nature of super-terrene (or sublunary)
things, here regarded as the Elysian state.  
  
The love of the Mother of the Gods for the Soul represents the “fourth
state” (the *turīya* of Vedantic mystic psychology), or the absorption
of the masculine power of the Soul by its own higher Feminine Nature.
*Cf.* in Damascius’ “Life of Isidores” (Photius, *Bibl.,* ed. Bekker,
345 a. 5: “I fell asleep, and in a vision Attis seemed to appear to me,
and, on behalf of the Mother of the Gods, to initiate me into the feast
called Hilaria—a mystery which discloses the way of our salvation from
Hades.” Hades, the realm of Selēnē, is not Tartarus, the realm of Death.

<span id="fn_347"></span>[153:1](th110.htm#fr_347.md) Compare the so-called
*Second Epistle of Clement* (an early homily incorporating
extra-canonical Gospel-materials), xii. 2: “For the Lord Himself being
asked by some one when his Kingdom should come, said: When the two shall
be one, and the outside as the inside, and the male with the female
neither male nor female”; and also the well-known *logoi,* from *The
Gospel according to the Egyptians,* quoted several times by Clement of
Alexandria: “When Salome asked how long Death should prevail, the Lord
said: So long as ye women bear children; for I am come to destroy the
work of the Female. And Salome said to Him: Did I therefore well in
bearing no children? The Lord answered and said: Eat every Herb, but eat
not that which hath bitterness. When Salome asked when these things
about which she questioned should be made known, the Lord said: When ye
trample upon the Garment of Shame; when the Two become One, and Male
with Female neither male nor female.” And with the last logos of the
above compare the new-found fragment of a lost Gospel: “His disciples
say unto Him: When wilt thou be manifest to us, and when shall we see
Thee? He saith: When ye shall be stripped and not be ashamed.”—Grenfell
and Hunt, *New Sayings of Jesus* (London, 1904), p. 40. The environment
is Egyptian and ascetic; it is a saying addressed to a community, as may
be seen from one of the previous *logoi*: “Having one garment what do ye
\[lack\]?”

<span id="fn_348"></span>[153:2](th110.htm#fr_348.md) See Rom. i. 20-23,

<span id="fn_350"></span>[153:4](th110.htm#fr_350.md) ἀΐδιος—evidently a
word-play.

<span id="fn_351"></span>[153:5](th110.htm#fr_351.md) The received Pauline
text is slightly shortened here.

<span id="fn_352"></span>[154:1](th110.htm#fr_352.md) Evidently a reference
to the Chaldæan fourfold (man-eagle-lion-bull) glyph of what Later
Orphicism and Platonism called the Autozōon, representing the four main
types of Animal Life; the same mystery which Ezekiel saw in the Vision
of the Mercabah, or Celestial Chariot—a reflected picture, I believe,
from the Chaldæan Mysteries.

<span id="fn_353"></span>[154:2](th110.htm#fr_353.md) Verses 24 and 25 of
the Received Text are omitted.

<span id="fn_354"></span>[154:3](th110.htm#fr_354.md) ἀσχημοσύνη—meaning

<span id="fn_356"></span>[154:5](th110.htm#fr_356.md) That is, baptism.

<span id="fn_357"></span>[154:6](th110.htm#fr_357.md) We wonder what “they”
really did say? They may have argued in their private circles that even
in the foulest things the clean soul could recognise the reversed signs
of the Mysteries of Purity; for certainly these things require an
explanation—nay, more urgently do they require an interpretation in
proportion to their foulness. The hateful suggestion of Hippolytus that
these ascetic and spiritually-minded folk—for their doctrines plainly
show them to be so—were as foul as those of the Flood, only shows the
ineradicable prejudice of unwitting self-righteousness.

<span id="fn_358"></span>[155:1](th110.htm#fr_358.md) Completion of R.

<span id="fn_359"></span>[155:2](th110.htm#fr_359.md) Picking up “Blessed

<span id="fn_363"></span>[155:6](th110.htm#fr_363.md) Presumably referring
to Seed.

<span id="fn_364"></span>[155:7](th110.htm#fr_364.md) Perhaps, however,
they meant something very different, and perhaps even their analogies
are not so foolish as they seemed to H.

<span id="fn_365"></span>[155:8](th110.htm#fr_365.md) The material here
seems to follow directly on § 5. It is a summary by H.; but seeing that
there is more in it of S. than of H., we will print it as S., indicating
H. when possible.

<span id="fn_366"></span>[156:1](th110.htm#fr_366.md) Isis, or Nature, as
the seven spheres and the eighth sphere (? the “black” earth).

<span id="fn_367"></span>[156:2](th110.htm#fr_367.md) That is the Celestial
Nile or Heaven-Ocean, which fructifies Mother Nature. “The Alexandrians
honoured the same God as being both Osiris and Adonis, according to
their mystical god-blending (*syncrasia*).” Damascius, “Life of
Isidorus” (Phot., *Bibl.,* 242; p. 342 a. 21, ed. Bek.).

<span id="fn_368"></span>[156:3](th110.htm#fr_368.md) *Sc.* the Egyptians.

<span id="fn_369"></span>[156:4](th110.htm#fr_369.md) Prov. xxiv. 16—same
reading as LXX. *Cf.* Luke xvii. 4.: “If he trespass against thee seven
times in a day and turn again to thee, saying, ‘I repent’; thou shalt
forgive.” This saying is apparently from the “Logia” source; *cf.* Matt,
xviii. 21, and compare the idea with the scheme of the “repentance” of
the *Pistis Sophia*.

<span id="fn_370"></span>[156:5](th110.htm#fr_370.md) The seven planetary
spheres; but it may also connect with the idea of the falling “stars” as
the souls descending into matter, according to the Platonic and Hermetic
doctrine.

<span id="fn_371"></span>[156:6](th110.htm#fr_371.md) Probably the
Egyptians in their Mysteries, connecting with what is summarised by H.
at end of § 6 and beginning of § 7.

<span id="fn_372"></span>[157:1](th110.htm#fr_372.md) Evidently a *logos*
from some Hellenistic scripture. In the evidence of Zosimus which we
adduce at the end of our Trismegistic Fragments, he quotes (§§ 15 and 7)
from the “Inner Door”—a lost treatise of Hermes Trismegistus—as follows:
“For that the Son of God having power in all things, becoming all things
that He willeth, appeareth as He willeth to each.” Thus we have S.
quoting the original *logos,* which, I suggest, belongs to the
“Pœmandres” type of Trismegistic literature. Therefore that type was in
existence before S. This confirms our attribution of the “they declare”
to the Egyptians and their Mysteries (Trismegisticism being principally
the Hellenised form of those Mysteries), and also the completion of R.
at the end of the first paragraph of § 7 above.

<span id="fn_373"></span>[157:2](th110.htm#fr_373.md) *Cf.* Matt. xix. 17 =
Mark x. 18 = Luke xviii. 19. The first clause agrees with Mark and Luke,
the second with Matthew (omitting “the” before “Good”). The presumably
primitive reading of the positive command, “Call me not Good,” has
disappeared entirely from this phase of tradition.

<span id="fn_374"></span>[157:3](th110.htm#fr_374.md) A different form from
Matt. v. 45, but the same idea; for the other tradition, see Luke vi.
35.

<span id="fn_375"></span>[158:1](th110.htm#fr_375.md) *Cf.* Matt v. 15 =
Mark iv. 21 = Luke viii. 16 and xi. 33.

<span id="fn_376"></span>[158:2](th110.htm#fr_376.md) *Cf.* Matt. x. 27 =
Luke xii. 3.

<span id="fn_377"></span>[158:3](th110.htm#fr_377.md) That is, symbolically
distinguished statues of Hermes.

<span id="fn_378"></span>[158:4](th110.htm#fr_378.md) The text is faulty;
but compare *Pausanias,* VI. xxvi. 5, where, speaking of Cyllene, he
says: “The image of Hermes which the people of the place revere
exceedingly, is nothing but an ithyphallus on a pedestal.” This famous
symbolic figure at Cyllene is mentioned also by Artemidorus,
*Oneirocr.,* i. 45; and by Lucian, *Jupiter Tragædus,* 42. *Cf.* J. G.
Frazer’s *Pausanias* (London, 1898), iv. 110.

<span id="fn_379"></span>[159:1](th110.htm#fr_379.md) Psychagogue and
psychopomp—or leader and evoker of souls—apparently here meaning him who
takes souls out of body and brings them back again to it.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[159:2](th110.htm#fr_380.md) μνηστήρων—lit.,
meaning “recalling to mind”; and also “suitors.” *Cf.* *Od.,* xxiv. 1
ff.

<span id="fn_381"></span>[159:3](th110.htm#fr_381.md) Empedocles, *On
Purifications* (Diels, 119; Stein, 390; Karsten, 11; Fairbanks, *First
Philosophers of Greece,* 206); Empedocles continues: “ . . . have I
fallen here on the earth to consort with mortals!”

<span id="fn_382"></span>[159:4](th110.htm#fr_382.md) The Naassenes, in
H.’s opinion.

<span id="fn_383"></span>[159:5](th110.htm#fr_383.md) The souls.

<span id="fn_384"></span>[159:6](th110.htm#fr_384.md) Some editors think
this is a mistake for Ialdabaōth. The name, however, appears in the
system of Justinus (Hipp., *Philos.,* v. 26) as Esaddaios, evidently the
transliteration of El Shaddai, as one of the twelve Paternal Angels, the
Sons of Elohim, the Demiurge of the sensible world, and of Eden, the
Maternal Potency or Nature.

<span id="fn_385"></span>[159:7](th110.htm#fr_385.md) τοῦ ἰδικοῦ κόσμου—the
cosmos of species and not of wholes. *Cf.* § 17 below for the passage of
C. from which H. takes this. Compare Ptah-Hephaistos, the Demiurge by
Fire, the Fourth, in the Inscription of London given in Chap. VI. above.

“he who hath power over the lives of cosmos.”

<span id="fn_389"></span>[160:4](th110.htm#fr_389.md) Ps. ii. 9—same
reading as LXX.

<span id="fn_390"></span>[160:5](th110.htm#fr_390.md) Or “get back memory,”
or “become suitors.”

<span id="fn_391"></span>[160:6](th110.htm#fr_391.md) Eph. v. 14—a
shortened form of the present Pauline text; Paul himself, however, seems
to be quoting from some older writing. If the intermediate reading
(ἐπιψαύσει for ἐπιφαύσει) can stand (see W. H., Ap. 125), it would mean
“Christ shall touch thee” with His rod.

<span id="fn_392"></span>[160:7](th110.htm#fr_392.md) *Cf.* Plutarch, *De
Is. et Os.,* xxxiv. After saying that Osiris, or the Logos, is
symbolised as Ocean and Water, and that Thales took his idea of Primal
“Water, as the cause of things, from the Egyptians, the initiated priest
of Apollo and learned comparative mythologist continues: “The Greeks say
that ‘son’ (ὑιόν) comes from ‘water’ (ὕδατος) and ‘to moisten’ (ὕσαι),
and they call Dionysus ‘Hyes’ (ὕην) as Lord of the Moist (ὑγρᾶς) Nature,
he being the same as Osiris.” Stoll in Roscher’s *Lex*. (*sub vv.*) says
that “Hyēs” and “Hyē” were respectively designations of Dionysus and
Semele, and that the meaning is the “Moistener” and the “Moistened”
(references *loc. cit.*). The nymphs who reared Bacchus were also called
Hyades (*Pherecydes,* 46; p. 108, ed. Sturz). Hyēs was also a popular
epithet of Zeus as god of rain. See also Lobeck, *Aglaophamus,* 782 and
1045 ff.; *Anecd.,* Bekk., p. 202: Some say that Hyēs = Attis, others
that Hyēs = Dionysus; “for Zeus poured (ὕσε) ambrosia upon him.” One of
the names of Bacchus was Ambrosia (Pherecy., *ibid.*; Non., xxi. 20). I
would therefore suggest that the mystic cry “Hye Kye” meant “O Moistener
beget!”

<span id="fn_410"></span>[163:4](th110.htm#fr_410.md) The final quotation
within the quotation is also from Ps. lxxxii. 6. Here, then, we have a
quotation from a scripture (“what is written”), glossed by J. with his
special exegesis, but already being an exegesis of an Old Testament
*logos*. It is not only a *halacha,* to use a term of Talmudic

presumably, those who have learned to rule themselves, the “self-taught”
race, etc., of Philo.

<span id="fn_416"></span>[164:4](th110.htm#fr_416.md) Eusebius (*Præp.
Evang.,* IX. xxviii. and xxix. 5 ff.; ed. Dind. i. 505 ff. and 508 ff.),
quoting from Alexander Cornelius (Polyhistor), who nourished about 100
B.C., has preserved to us a number of verses from a tragedy (called *The
Leading Forth*) on the subject of Moses and the Exodus story, by a
certain Ezechiel, a (? Alexandrian) Hebrew poet writing in Greek. In
these fragments of Ezechiel’s tragedy, Mariam, Sepphōra, and Jothōr are
all *dramatis personæ*. These spellings and that of Madiam are, of
course, all LXX. (that is, Greek Targum) forms of our A.V. Miriam,
Jethro, Zipporah, and Midian.

<span id="fn_417"></span>[165:1](th110.htm#fr_417.md) *Il.,* xv. 189.

<span id="fn_418"></span>[165:2](th110.htm#fr_418.md) *Cf.* Luke viii. 10.
Luke seems to preserve the reading of the source more correctly than
Matt. xiii. 13 or Mark iv. 12. The Saying looks back to Is. vi. 9.

<span id="fn_419"></span>[165:3](th110.htm#fr_419.md) *Cf.* § 30 J.

<span id="fn_420"></span>[165:4](th110.htm#fr_420.md) These three names are
based on the Hebrew text of Is. xxviii. 13, A.V.: “But the Word of the
Lord was unto them precept upon precept, precept upon precept; line upon
line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.” LXX.: “καὶ ἔσται
αὐτοῖς τὸ λόγιον κυρίου τοῦ θεοῦ, θλῖψις ἐπὶ θλῖψιν ἐλπὶς ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι,
ἔτι μικρὸν ἔτι μικρόν.” That is: “And the *logion* \[oracle, the
Urim-and-Thummim, or instrument of the Logos, according to Philo\] of
God shall be to them tribulation on tribulation, hope on hope, still
little still little.” See Epiphanius, *Hær.,* xxv. 4. “*Saulasau
saulasau*” = “tribulation on tribulation, tribulation on tribulation;”
“*kaulakau kaulakau*” = “hope on hope, hope on hope;” “*zeēsar*
\[*zeēsar*\]” = “still little still little”—that is, the “Height of
Hope,” the “Depth of Tribulation,” and the “As yet Very
Little”—evidently referring to the as yet small number of the
Regenerate. *Cf. Pistis Sophia,* 354: “One out of a thousand, and two
out of ten thousand.” See Salmon’s article, “Caulacau,” in Smith and
Wace’s *D. of Ch. Biog.,* i. 424 f. It is also to be noticed that
Epiphanius ascribes the origin of these names to the Nicolaïtans. In
Hebrew the corresponding name would be Balaamites; and Balaam or Bileam
(Nico-laus) was one of the Rabbinical by-names for Jeschu (Jesus). See
*D. J. L.,* p. 188.

<span id="fn_421"></span>[165:5](th110.htm#fr_421.md) This and the
following paragraph seem to have been misplaced by J. or C., for § 19
connects directly with the exposition concerning the ithyphallic Hermes.

<span id="fn_426"></span>[166:5](th110.htm#fr_426.md) *Cf.* the *logos,*
from *The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery*: “Jesus, the
Living One, answered and said: Blessed is the man who knoweth this
\[Word (*Logos*)\], and hath brought down the Heaven, and borne the
Earth and raised it heavenwards, and he becometh the Middle, for it (the
Middle) is ‘nothing.’”—Schmidt (C.), *Gnostische Schriften in koptischer

*Koptisch-gnostische Schriften* (Leipzig, 1905), p. 259.

<span id="fn_428"></span>[166:7](th110.htm#fr_428.md) The fourth Demiurgic
Power of the Sensible World was Esaldaios, as we have already seen from
J., § 12. The indications are too vague to recover the “measures” and
“numbers” of the system. But the “third and fourth” are apparently both
“fiery”—the former giving “light,” the latter “heat.” Compare § 23 C.,
who speaks of the third Gate, or entrance to the third Heaven. This
Heaven, the third from below, would correspond with the first ætheric
sphere—there being, presumably, three before the fourth or middle, the
“Fiery Ruler.”

<span id="fn_437"></span>[168:1](th110.htm#fr_437.md) This seems to connect
immediately with the end of § 16. See R. 100, n. 4.

<span id="fn_438"></span>[168:2](th110.htm#fr_438.md) S. probably had
“For,” which was glossed by J. into “Moreover.”

<span id="fn_439"></span>[168:3](th110.htm#fr_439.md) But this “statue,” as
we have seen, was the ithyphallus simply.

<span id="fn_444"></span>[168:8](th110.htm#fr_444.md) *Cf.* John viii. 21
and xiii. 33. It is remarkable that in the text of our Gospels these
*logoi* are addressed to the Jews; C., however, takes them as sayings
addressed to the disciples. It is possible that we may have here a
“source” of the Fourth Gospel!

<span id="fn_445"></span>[169:1](th110.htm#fr_445.md) These “tribes,” then,
were not the Jewish tribes, ten of which did not return, but twelve
typical natures of men, and something else.

<span id="fn_446"></span>[169:2](th110.htm#fr_446.md) See Immisch’s

<span id="fn_447"></span>[169:3](th110.htm#fr_447.md) Κορύβας, the Lord of

<span id="fn_495"></span>[175:5](th110.htm#fr_495.md) If our attribution of
this to J. is correct (R. gives it to C.), we have perhaps before us a
*logos* from the Phrygian Mysteries.

<span id="fn_496"></span>[175:6](th110.htm#fr_496.md) This may possibly be
assigned to C.; but C. usually comments on J. and does not lead, and the
terminology is that of J. and not of C.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[175:7](th110.htm#fr_497.md) A simple form of
Matt. vii. 6. Is it by any means possible an underlying mystical
word-play on the Eleusinian logos “ὕε κύε”; hence ὕς (pig)—a synonym of
χοῖρος and κύων (dog)?

<span id="fn_498"></span>[175:8](th110.htm#fr_498.md) This section seems to
be misplaced, and § 25 probably followed § 23 immediately in the
original; the antithesis of Fruitful and Unfruitful following one
another, as above (§ 22), the antithesis of Dead and God.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[175:9](th110.htm#fr_499.md) αἰ-πόλος, *vulg.* =
“goat-herd.”

<span id="fn_500"></span>[176:1](th110.htm#fr_500.md) S. had probably
“ignorant.”

<span id="fn_501"></span>[176:2](th110.htm#fr_501.md) ἀειπόλος, τουτέστι
ἀεὶ πολῶν. *Cf.* Plato, *Cratylus,* 408 C, D.

<span id="fn_502"></span>[176:3](th110.htm#fr_502.md) This is not very
clear. But see Mozley’s article, “Polus,” in Smith, Wayte, and
Marindin’s *D. of Gk. and Rom. Antiquities* (London, 1891), ii. 442,
443: “Both in \[Plato’s\] *Timæus,* 40 B. and \[Aristotle’s\] *De Cælo,*
ii. 14, πόλος is used, not for the entire heaven, but for the axis of
heaven and earth, around which the whole revolved. Again in the *De
Cælo,* ii. 2, the πόλοι are the poles, north and south, in our sense of
the word.” Compare also the rubric in one of the rituals in the Greek
Magic Papyri—C. Wessely, *Griechische Zauberpapyrus,* in *Denkschr. d.
Akad., ph. hist. Kl.,* xxxvi. (Vienna, 1888)—where it is said that the
Sun will then move towards the Pole, and the theurgist will see Seven
Virgins (the Seven Fortunes of Heaven) approach, and Seven Youths, with
heads of bulls (the Pole-lords of Heaven), who make the axis turn
(661-670). Compare this with the “cylinder” idea in the fragment of *K.
K.* Then there will appear the Great God “in a white robe and trowsers,
with a crown of gold on his head, holding in his right hand the golden
shoulder of a heifer, that is the Bear that sets in motion and keeps the
heaven turning in due seasons.” This God will pronounce an oracle, and
the theurgist will then receive the gift of divination. The special
interest of this tradition is that it contains a Magian element (to wit,
the “trowsers”), and this connects closely with Phrygia and the cult
that was wedded most closely with the Mithriaca, namely, that of the
Mother of the Gods.

<span id="fn_503"></span>[176:4](th110.htm#fr_503.md) *Od.,* iv. 384. In
the Proteus myth Egypt is the Nile—that is, the “Great Green,” the
Heaven Ocean. Proteus was also said to have been the messenger or
servant of Poseidon, the special God, it will be remembered, of Plato’s
Atlantis.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[177:1](th110.htm#fr_504.md) πιπράσκεται, a
synonym of πωλεῖται, which, besides the meaning of “coming and going,”
or “moving about,” also signifies “is sold”; but I do not see the
appositeness of the remark, unless the “ignorant” so understood it.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[177:2](th110.htm#fr_505.md) Is. liv. 1; quoted
also in Gal. iv. 27. *Cf.* Philo, *De Execrat.,* § 7; M. ii. 435, P. 936
(Ri. v. 254): “For when she \[the Soul\] is a multitude of passions and
filled with vices, her children swarming over her—pleasures, appetites,
folly, intemperance, unrighteousness, injustice—she is weak and sick,
and lies at death’s door, dying; but when she becomes sterile, and
ceases to bring them forth, or even casts them from her, forthwith, from
the change, she becometh a chaste virgin, and, receiving the Divine
Seed, she fashions and engenders marvellous excellencies that Nature
prizeth highly—prudence, courage, temperance, justice, holiness, piety,
and the rest of the virtues and good dispositions.”  
  
There are, thus, seen to be identical ideas of a distinctly marked
character in both J. and Philo. Did J., then, belong to Philo’s
“circle”? Or, rather, did Philo represent a propagandist side of J.’s
circle? In other words, can we possibly have before us in J. a Therapeut
allegorical exercise, based on S., by an exceedingly liberal-minded
Hellenistic Jewish mystic?

<span id="fn_506"></span>[178:1](th110.htm#fr_506.md) *Cf.* Matt. ii. 18,
which depends on Jer. xxxi. 15 (LXX. xxxviii. 15). In T. R., however,
the reading is by no means the same as in LXX. C. favours the Gospel
text rather than that of LXX.

<span id="fn_507"></span>[178:2](th110.htm#fr_507.md) This shows a very
detached frame of mind on behalf of J. Perhaps it may be an
interpolation of C.

<span id="fn_508"></span>[178:3](th110.htm#fr_508.md) Jer. xvii. 9.

<span id="fn_509"></span>[178:4](th110.htm#fr_509.md) This has all the
appearance of a quotation from some mystic apocryphon of the Gnosis.

<span id="fn_510"></span>[178:5](th110.htm#fr_510) See Cumont (F..md),
*Mystères de Mithra* (Brussels, 1898). In the monuments representing the
bull-slaying myth of the Mithriaca, the bull’s tail is frequently
terminated in “*une truffe d’epis*”—the number varies, being either one,
three, five, or seven. In the *Bundahish* all things are generated from
the body, especially from the spinal marrow, of the slain bull.
Sometimes the wheat-ears are represented as flowing like blood from the
wound above the heart inflicted by the dagger of Mithras, the
Bull-slayer (*op. cit.,* i. 186, 187). The constellation of the
Wheat-ear in the Virgin, which was supposed to give good harvests,
presumably refers to the same idea (*cf.* Eratosth., *Cataster.,* 9).
See *op. cit.,* i. 202, 205, n. 2. The wheat-ear, therefore, symbolised
in one aspect the “generative seed”—in animals and men-animals the
spermatozoa, in man a mystery. Mithraicism had the closest connection
with the Phrygian Mystery Cult; indeed, the Magna Mater Mysteries were
used by it for the initiation of women, who were excluded from the
Mithriaca proper.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[179:3](th110.htm#fr_513.md) ὑπὸ πολλῷ πύρι, lit.,
“to the accompaniment of much fire.” This refers, I believe, to the
brilliant illumination of the Temple, or, as it was variously called,
the Initiation Hall (τελεστήριον), the Mystic Enclosure (μυστικὸς
σηκός)—though this was probably the inner court surrounding the Temple
proper the Great Hall (μέγαρον), or Palace (άγάκτορον). As Hatch says,
in the tenth of his famous Hibbert Lectures for 1888: “And at night
there were the mystic plays: the scenic representations, the drama in
symbol and for sight. The torches were extinguished; they stood outside
the Temple \[in the Mystic Enclosure, presumably\] in the silence and
darkness. The door opened—there was a blaze of light—before them was
enacted the drama.” Hatch (E.), *The Influence of Greek Ideas and Usages
upon the Christian Church* (4th ed., London, 1892). See also my “Notes
on the Eleusinian Mysteries,” in *The Theosoph. Rev.* (April 1898),
xxii. p. 151.

<span id="fn_514"></span>[180:1](#fr_-1.md) See especially Lobeck,
*Aglaophamus,* 587 ff.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[180:2](th110.htm#fr_514.md) ἤλθομεν, this verb
forming its tenses from √ερ and √ελυθ, and ἔλευσις meaning also
“coming.”

<span id="fn_516"></span>[180:3](th110.htm#fr_515.md) Emend, by Keil.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[180:4](th110.htm#fr_516.md) ἀνελθεῖν.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[180:5](th110.htm#fr_517.md) It need hardly be
said that this is all mystical word-play; ἀνακτόρειον is philologically
derived from the same stem as ἄναξ, “a king.” *Cf.* the Anaktoron or
Palace as the name of the Eleusinian Temple of Initiation.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[180:6](th110.htm#fr_518.md) Heracleitus, Fr. (25,
Diels; 101, Fairbanks, *First Philosophers of Greece*). “Deaths” may
also be rendered destinies, fates, or dooms.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[181:1](th110.htm#fr_519.md) *Sc.* the first path.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[181:2](th110.htm#fr_520.md) These verses are from
some unknown poet, who is conjectured variously to have been either
Parmenides or Pamphus of Athens. See notes *in loc*. in both Schneidewin
and Cruice.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[181:3](th110.htm#fr_521.md) *Sc.* those of
Persephonē.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[181:4](th110.htm#fr_522.md) *Sc.* the Greater
Mysteries; in which, presumably, the candidate went through some
symbolic rite of death and resurrection.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[181:5](th110.htm#fr_523.md) Or true virility,
ἀπηρσενωμένους, which equates with ἀπ-ανδρουμένους, I believe, and does
not mean *demasculati,* or *exuta virilitate,* as translated
respectively by Schneidewin and Cruice. For the “death” mentioned above
and the “casting away of the garments,” see the Mystery Ritual in *The
Acts of John* (*F. F. F.,* 431-434); and for the latter and the
“Virginal Spirit,” the passages on the Sacred Marriage which I have
collected in the chapter on the main doctrines of Philo.

<span id="fn_525"></span>[182:1](th110.htm#fr_524.md) A loose reference to
LXX.—Is. vii. 14.

<span id="fn_526"></span>[182:2](th110.htm#fr_525.md) Or Eternity of
Eternities.

<span id="fn_527"></span>[182:3](th110.htm#fr_526.md) *Cf.* Matt. vii. 13,
14; our text, however, is an inversion of the clauses, with several
various readings, of T. R.

<span id="fn_528"></span>[182:4](th110.htm#fr_527.md) This seems to connect
with the Fruitful of § 25. See below, in the Hymn “Whether blest Child,”
the “*cut* wheat-ear” that Amygdalos brought forth.

<span id="fn_529"></span>[182:5](th110.htm#fr_528.md) This refers to the
First Man.

<span id="fn_530"></span>[182:6](th110.htm#fr_529.md) *Vulg.,* Almond-tree.

<span id="fn_531"></span>[182:7](th110.htm#fr_530.md) In the Mithriaca,
Mithras, in the most ancient myth, was represented as in (? born from) a
Tree. See Cumont.

<span id="fn_532"></span>[182:8](th110.htm#fr_531.md) Reading οἱονεὶ
διαφύζοντα with S., C., and R.; but the Codex has οιον ἰδία σφύζοντα. If
we read ᾠόν for the corrupt οιον, we get “the Egg throbbing apart” or in
separation—and so link on with the Orphic (Chaldæan) tradition.

<span id="fn_533"></span>[182:9](th110.htm#fr_532.md) διήμυξε, the synonym
of a term which occurs frequently in the *Pistis Sophia,* “I tore myself
asunder.”

<span id="fn_534"></span>[182:10](th110.htm#fr_533.md) That is, to Man Son
of Man.

<span id="fn_535"></span>[183:1](th110.htm#fr_534.md) The somewhat boastful
tone, shown in several passages already, probably betrays C.; it may,
however, be assigned to J.

<span id="fn_536"></span>[183:2](th110.htm#fr_535.md) ἀμύξαι, a play on
Amygdalos.

<span id="fn_537"></span>[183:3](th110.htm#fr_536.md) That is,
“scarifications.”

<span id="fn_538"></span>[183:4](th110.htm#fr_537.md) *Cf.* John i. 3.,
reading, however, οὐδὲν and not the οὐδὲ ἕν of W. H.

<span id="fn_539"></span>[183:5](th110.htm#fr_538.md) The Piper; properly,
the player on the syrinx or seven-reeded Pan-pipe. Compare the Mystery
Ritual in *The Acts of John*: “I would pipe; dance all of you!” (*F. F.
F.,* p. 432); and, “We have piped unto you and ye have not danced”
(Matt. xi. 17 = Luke vii. 27).

<span id="fn_540"></span>[183:6](th110.htm#fr_539.md) Or harmonised; that
is, cosmic or ordered. *Cf. C. H.,* i. 15: “For being above the Harmony,
He became a slave enharmonised”; also *Orph. Hymn.,* viii. 11; and also
*Acts of John,* where the Logos is spoken of as “Wisdom in harmony” (*F.
F. F.,* 436).

<span id="fn_541"></span>[183:7](th110.htm#fr_540.md) *Cf.* John iv. 24.

<span id="fn_542"></span>[183:8](th110.htm#fr_541.md) A conflation of John
iv. 21 and 23. The “mountain,” when used mystically, signifies the inner
“Mount of initiation.” Jerusalem in the text signifies the Jerusalem
Below. The true worshippers worship in the Jerusalem Above.

<span id="fn_543"></span>[184:1](th110.htm#fr_542.md) *Sc.* the Son.

<span id="fn_544"></span>[184:2](th110.htm#fr_543.md) *Sc.* the Piper.

<span id="fn_545"></span>[184:3](th110.htm#fr_544.md) ρῆμα—used also by
Philo and LXX.

<span id="fn_546"></span>[184:4](th110.htm#fr_545.md) With slight verbal
omissions the opening lines down to “foundation” are identical with the
beginning of *The Great Apocalypse or Announcement* of the “Simonian”
tradition, an exceedingly interesting document from which some
quotations have been preserved to us by Hippolytus elsewhere (*Philos.,*
vi. 9). The “Simonian” tradition was regarded by all the Church Fathers
as the source of all “heresy”; but modern criticism regards *The Great
Announcement* as a late document of the Christian Gnosis. The quotation
of this document by J., however, makes this opinion, in my view,
entirely untenable. If my analysis stands firm, *The Great Announcement*
is thus proved to be pre-Christian, according to the traditional date. I
am also inclined to think that in this quotation itself we have already
the work of a commentator and not the original form of the Apocalypse.

<span id="fn_547"></span>[185:1](th110.htm#fr_546.md) *Cf.* § 16 J.

<span id="fn_548"></span>[185:2](th110.htm#fr_547.md) *Cf.* Matt. xiii. 31
= Mark iv. 30 = Luke xiii. 18.

<span id="fn_549"></span>[185:3](th110.htm#fr_548.md) *Sc.* the Heavens of
the Psalm, that is, the Æons and the rest above.

<span id="fn_550"></span>[185:4](th110.htm#fr_549.md) Ps. xviii. 3.

<span id="fn_551"></span>[185:5](th110.htm#fr_550.md) The Naassenes, in H’s
view.

<span id="fn_552"></span>[185:6](th110.htm#fr_551.md) ἀπρονοήτως.

<span id="fn_553"></span>[185:7](th110.htm#fr_552.md) κιθάραν—the ancient
cithara was triangular in shape and had seven strings.

<span id="fn_554"></span>[185:8](th110.htm#fr_553.md) The text of the
following Ode has been reconstructed by Wilamowitz in *Hermes,* xxxvii.
328; our translation is from his reconstruction.

<span id="fn_555"></span>[185:9](th110.htm#fr_554.md) ἄκουσμα—a hearing, an
instruction, lesson, discourse, sermon, applied to the public lectures
of Pythagoras (Jamb., *V. P.,* 174). It means also a song or even a
“singer,” a “bard.” “Their singers (ἀκούσματα) are thus called ‘bards’”
(Posid. ap. Athen., vi. 49). The Hearers (οἱ ἀκουσματικοί) were the
Probationers in the School of Pythagoras (see *s.vv.* in Sophocles’
*Lex.*). Schneidewin and Cruice adopt Hermann’s “emendation,” ἄκρισμα
(mutilation), but I prefer the reading of the Codex, as referring to the
“mournful piper,” or Logos, in the flowing “discord” of Rhea or Chaos,
and therefore the “song” that Rhea is beginning to sing as she changes
from Chaos to Cosmos.

<span id="fn_556"></span>[186:1](th110.htm#fr_555.md) Perhaps Quick, for
θεὸς is from θέ-ειν, “to run,” to imitate the word-play of our mystics.

<span id="fn_557"></span>[186:2](th110.htm#fr_556.md) Or cut.

<span id="fn_558"></span>[186:3](th110.htm#fr_557.md) βόμβοις.

<span id="fn_559"></span>[186:4](th110.htm#fr_558.md) Lit., “bellower.”

<span id="fn_560"></span>[187:1](th110.htm#fr_559.md) The Hebrew *Naḥash,*
as we have already seen.

<span id="fn_561"></span>[187:2](th110.htm#fr_560.md) There being more of
J. than of H. in this, I have printed it as J. though it is a defaced J.
I am also persuaded that in what follows we have a quotation from a
“Simonian” document by J. rather than J. himself.

<span id="fn_562"></span>[187:3](th110.htm#fr_561.md) That is, temples.

<span id="fn_563"></span>[187:4](th110.htm#fr_562.md) Who derived all
things symbolically from “Water.”

<span id="fn_564"></span>[187:5](th110.htm#fr_563.md) *Cf.* Deut. xxxiii.
17.

<span id="fn_565"></span>[187:6](th110.htm#fr_564.md) *Cf.* Gen. ii. 10
(LXX.).

<span id="fn_566"></span>[188:1](th110.htm#fr_565.md) *Cf.* Gen. ii. 11,
12.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[188:2](th110.htm#fr_566.md) *Ibid.,* 13.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[188:3](th110.htm#fr_567.md) *Ibid.,* 14.

<span id="fn_569"></span>[188:4](th110.htm#fr_568.md) *Ibid.*

<span id="fn_570"></span>[188:5](th110.htm#fr_569.md) The substance of this
is also to be found in the “Simonian” tradition “refuted” by Hippolytus.

<span id="fn_571"></span>[188:6](th110.htm#fr_570.md) *Cf.* Gen. i. 7.

<span id="fn_572"></span>[188:7](th110.htm#fr_571.md) *Cf.* John iv. 10.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[189:1](th110.htm#fr_572.md) Lit., the Heracleian
stone.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[189:2](th110.htm#fr_573.md) κερκίδι. *Cf.* Hipp.,
*Phil.,* v. 17, on system of Sethiani (S. 198, 36). Both S. and C.
translate it correctly as “*spina,*” meaning “backbone”; it has,
however, been erroneously translated as “spur.” Plutarch, *De Is. et
Os.,* lxii. 3, tells us that the load-stone was called by the Egyptians
“bone of Horus”; and Horus is the “hawk” *par excellence,* the “golden
hawk.” *Cf.* Budge, *Gods of the Egyptians,* ii. 246, who says that we
are informed by Manetho (thus making Manetho the main source of
Plutarch) that the “load-stone is by the Egyptians called the ‘bone of
Horus,’ as iron is the ‘bone of Typho.’” In the chapter of the Ritual
dealing with the deification of the members, the backbone of the
deceased is identified with the backbone of Set (xlii. 12). Elsewhere
(cviii. 8) the deceased is said “to depart having the harpoon of iron in
him.” This seems to suggest the black backbone of death and the golden
backbone of life.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[189:3](th110.htm#fr_574.md) *Cf.* John ix. 1;
τυφλὸς ἐκ γενετῆς, perhaps mystically meaning “blind from (owing to)
genesis.” *Cf.* the “blind accuser” in the Trismegistic treatise quoted
by Zosimus in our Fragments.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[189:4](th110.htm#fr_575.md) John i. 9.

<span id="fn_577"></span>[189:5](th110.htm#fr_576.md) This is evidently to
be attributed to J., or rather his “Simonian” source, as it follows
directly on the sentence about “every nature selecting.” Either C. has
suppressed the opening words of J.’s paragraph and substituted his own
gloss, or H. has mangled his text.

<span id="fn_578"></span>[190:1](th110.htm#fr_577.md) A *lacuna* in the
Codex which is thus completed by S. and C.

<span id="fn_579"></span>[190:2](th110.htm#fr_578.md) *Cf.* Is. xl. 15.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[190:3](th110.htm#fr_579.md) That is,
Messiah-ites, or Anointed-ones.

<span id="fn_581"></span>[190:4](th110.htm#fr_580.md) *Cf.* 1 Sam. xvi. 13.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[190:5](th110.htm#fr_581.md) 1 Sam. x. 1.

<span id="fn_583"></span>[190:6](th110.htm#fr_582.md) The text of this Hymn
is in places very corrupt; I have followed Cruice’s emendations mostly.
Schneidewin, for some reason or other which he does not state, omits it
bodily from his Latin translation.

<span id="fn_584"></span>[191:1](th110.htm#fr_583.md) This attribution may
be thought by some to be questionable; but as it is far more similar to
the thought-sphere of J. than to that of C., I have so assigned it. It
belonged to the same circles to which we must assign the sources of J.

<span id="fn_585"></span>[191:2](th110.htm#fr_584.md) γενικὸς—perhaps
“general” simply.

<span id="fn_586"></span>[191:3](th110.htm#fr_585.md) Or, of the Whole.

<span id="fn_587"></span>[191:4](th110.htm#fr_586.md) The Codex has ἔλαφον,
which, with Miller, we correct into ἐλάφου. Is this a parallel with the
“lost sheep” idea? Can it possibly connect with the conception
underlying the phrases on the golden tablets found in tombs of “Orphic”
initiates, on the territory of ancient Sybaris: “A kid thou hast fallen
into the milk” (“Timpone grande” Tablet *a,* Naples Museum, Kaibel,
C.I.G.I.S., 642); and, “A kid I have fallen into milk” (“Campagno”
Tablet *a, ibid.,* 641, and Append., p. 668)? But this connection is
very hazy; it more probably suggests the *nebris* or “fawn-skin” of the
Bacchic initiates (see my *Orpheus,* “The Fawn-skin,” pp. 243 ff., for
an explanation). Cruice proposes to substitute ὑδαρὸν (“watery”); but
there seems no reason why we should entirely reject the reading of the
Codex, especially as C.’s suggestion breaks the rule of the “more
difficult” reading being the preferable.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[191:5](th110.htm#fr_587.md) βασιλείαν—kingdom or
kingship.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[191:6](th110.htm#fr_588.md) The Codex reads εἶπεν
διησοῦς ἐσὸρ. Can this possibly be a glossed and broken-down remains of
Ἰαω Ζεησαρ (Iaō Zeēsar)?

<span id="fn_590"></span>[192:1](th110.htm#fr_589.md) Cruice thinks this
refers to the breath of God’s anger; but surely it refers to the Holy
Spirit of God?

<span id="fn_591"></span>[192:2](th110.htm#fr_590.md) *Sc.* the soul, the
“wandering sheep.”

<span id="fn_592"></span>[192:3](th110.htm#fr_591.md) *Cf.* “the bitter
Water,” or “Darkness,” or “Chaos,” of the Sethian system in Hipp.,
*Philos.,* v. 19; and see the note to the comments following
Hermes-Prayer v., p. 92.

<span id="fn_593"></span>[192:4](th110.htm#fr_592.md) The Logos in His
descent through the spheres takes on the Forms of all the Powers.

<span id="fn_594"></span>[192:5](th110.htm#fr_593.md) Is it, however,
possible that the original Hymn had Naas (Νάαν) and not Gnosis (Γνῶσιν)?

<span id="fn_595"></span>[193:1](th110.htm#fr_594.md) *Cf.* R. 99, 100; and
100, n. 4.

<span id="fn_596"></span>[195:1](th110.htm#fr_595.md) Wilamowitz’
hesitating attribution of it to the reign of Hadrian (117-138 A.D.) is,
in my opinion, devoid of any objective support whatever. (See R., p.
102.) Reitzenstein himself (p. 165) would place it in the second century
B.C.

<span id="fn_597"></span>[195:2](th110.htm#fr_596.md) Incidentally also it
may be pointed out that this analysis gives the *coup de grâce* to
Salmon’s contention (“The Cross-references in the Philosophumena,”
*Hermathena,* 1885, v. 389 if.) that the great systems of the Gnosis
made known to us only by Hippolytus are all the work of a single forger
who imposed upon the credulity of the heresy-hunting Bishop of Portus.
This contention, though to our mind one of the most striking instances
of “the good Homer nodding,” was nevertheless practically endorsed by
Stähelin (*Die gnostische Quellen Hippolyts in seiner Hauptschrift gegen
die Haeretiken,* 1890; in *Texte u. Untersuchungen,* VI.), who went over
the whole ground opened up by Salmon with minute and scrupulous
industry. The general weakness of this extraordinary hypothesis of
forgery has, however, been well pointed out by De Faye in his
*Introduction à l’Étude du Gnosticisme au II<sup>e</sup> et au
III<sup>e</sup> Siècle* (Paris, 1903), pp. 24 ff.; though De Faye also
maintains a late date.
