##### ON FISH TABOOS

VII\. 1. As to sea-fish, all \[Egyptians\] abstain generally (not from
all \[fish\] but) from some;—as, for example, those of the Oxyrhynchus
nome from those caught with a hook, for as they venerate the
sharp-snouted fish, <span id="fr_828"></span>[5](#fn_829.md) they fear that
the hook <span id="fr_829"></span>[6](#fn_830.md) is not pure when
“sharp-snout” is caught by it; <span id="fr_830"></span>[7](#fn_831.md)
while those of the Syēnē nome \[abstain from\] the “devourer,” <span
id="fr_831"></span>[8](#fn_832.md) for that it seems that it appears
together with the rising of the Nile, and that it shows their <span
id="fr_832"></span>[9](#fn_833.md) growth to those in joy, seen as a
self-sent messenger.

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

2\. Their priests, upon the other hand, abstain from all; and \[even\]
on the ninth of the first month, <span id="fr_833"></span>[1](#fn_834.md)
when every one of the rest of the Egyptians eats a broiled fish before
his front door, <span id="fr_834"></span>[2](#fn_835.md) the priests do not
taste it, but burn *their* fishes to ashes before the doors \[of the
Temple\]. <span id="fr_835"></span>[3](#fn_836.md)

3\. And they have two reasons \[for this\], of which I will later on
take up the sacred and extraordinary \[one\], according with the facts
religiously deduced concerning Osiris and Typhon. The evident, the one
that’s close at hand, in showing forth the fish as a not necessary and a
not unsuperfluous cooked food, bears witness unto Homer, who makes
neither the Phæacians of luxurious lives, nor yet the Ithakēsian Island
men, use fish, nor yet Odysseus’s Companions <span
id="fr_836"></span>[4](#fn_837.md) in so great a Voyage and on the Sea
before they came to the last Strait. <span
id="fr_837"></span>[5](#fn_838.md)

4\. And generally \[the priests\] think that the sea’s from fire and is
beyond the boundaries—nor part nor element \[of earth\], but of another
kind, a superfluity cor-rupted and cor-rupting.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_829"></span>[269:5](th119.htm#fr_828.md) τὸν ὀξύρυγχον—perhaps
the pike.

<span id="fn_830"></span>[269:6](th119.htm#fr_829.md) ἄγκιστρον—dim. of
ἄγκος, meaning a “bend” of any kind. Perhaps it may be intended as a
play on the *ankh* tie or “noose of life,” the well-known Egyptian
symbol, generally called the *crux ansata*.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[269:7](th119.htm#fr_830.md) If we read αὑτῷ for
αὐτῷ it would suggest a mystic meaning, namely, “falls into his own
snare.”

<span id="fn_832"></span>[269:8](th119.htm#fr_831.md) φαγροῦ—*Vulg.,*
sea-bream; but Hesychius spells it φάγωρος, connecting it with φαγεῖν,
to devour.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[269:9](th119.htm#fr_832.md) Or “his” (the
Nile’s); but the “self-sent messenger” (αὐτάγγελος) seems to demand
“their,” and so suggests a mystical sense.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[270:1](th119.htm#fr_833.md) Copt. Thoth—corr.
roughly with September.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[270:2](th119.htm#fr_834.md) πρὸ τῆς αὐλείου
θύρας—that is, the outside door into the αὐλή, or court of the house.
*Cf.* the title of the Trismegistic treatise given by Zosimus—“The Inner
Door.” There may, perhaps, be some mystical connection.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[270:3](th119.htm#fr_835.md) *Cf.* Luke xxiv. 42:
“And they gave Him a piece of broiled fish.” This was *after* His
“resurrection.” Also *cf. Talmud Bab.,* “Sanhedrin,” 103*a*: “That thou
shalt not have a son or disciple who burns his food publicly, like
Jeschu ha-Notzri” (*D. J. L.,* 189).

<span id="fn_837"></span>[270:4](th119.htm#fr_836.md) Compare the
Companions of Horus in the Solar Boat.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[270:5](th119.htm#fr_837.md) I fancy there must be
some under-meaning here, and so I have put the key-words in capitals.
