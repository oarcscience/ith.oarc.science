##### THE KINGS, THE RIDDLES OF THE PRIESTS, AND THE MEANING OF AMOUN

IX\. 1. The kings were appointed from the priests or from the
warriors,—the one caste possessing worth and honour through manliness,
and the other through wisdom.

2\. And he who was appointed from the warriors immediately became
\[one\] of the priests and shared in their philosophy,—which for the
most part was hidden in myths and words (*logoi*), containing dim
reflections and transparencies of truth, as, doubtless, they themselves
make indirectly plain by fitly setting sphinxes up before the temples,
as though their reasoning about the Gods possessed a wisdom wrapped in
riddle. <span id="fr_853"></span>[1](#fn_854.md)

3\. Indeed, the seat <span id="fr_854"></span>[2](#fn_855.md) of Athena
(that is Isis, as they think) at Saïs used to have the following
inscription on it:

“I am all that has been and is and shall be, and no mortal has ever
re-vealed <span id="fr_855"></span>[3](#fn_856.md) my robe.” <span
id="fr_856"></span>[4](#fn_857.md)

4\. Moreover, while the majority think that the proper name of Zeus with
the Egyptians is Amoun (which we by a slight change call Ammōn),
Manethō, the Sebennyte, considers it His hidden \[one\], and that His
\[power of\] hiding is made plain by the very articulation of the sound.

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

5\. Hecatæus <span id="fr_857"></span>[1](#fn_858.md) of Abdēra, however,
says that the Egyptians use this word to one another also when they call
one to them, for that its sound has got the power of “calling to.” <span
id="fr_858"></span>[2](#fn_859.md)

6\. Wherefore when they call to the First God—who they think is the same
for every man—as unto the Unmanifest and Hidden, invoking Him to make
Him manifest and plain to them, they say “Amoun!”

So great, then, was the care Egyptians took about the wisdom which
concerned the mysteries of the Gods.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_854"></span>[273:1](th121.htm#fr_853.md) *Cf.* M. L.
*ridellus,* F. *rideau,* a curtain or veil.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[273:2](th121.htm#fr_854.md) The technical term
for the sitting statue of a god or goddess.

<span id="fn_856"></span>[273:3](th121.htm#fr_855.md) ἀπεκάλυψεν—that is,
no one within duality has expressed or shown that in which this aspect
of feminine life veils itself.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[273:4](th121.htm#fr_856.md) For this mystical
*logos* of Net (Neith), the Great Mother, *cf.* Budge, *op. cit.,* i.
459 f.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[274:1](th121.htm#fr_857.md) H. flourished 550-475
B.C. A. was a town on the southern shore of Thrace.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[274:2](th121.htm#fr_858.md) προσκλητικήν. H. thus
seems to suggest that it (? Amen) was a “word of power,” a word of magic
for evoking the *ka* of a person, or summoning it to appear. It does not
seem very probable that the Egyptians shouted it after one another in
the street.
