##### AFTERWORD

So ends this exceedingly instructive treatise of Plutarch, which, in
spite of the mass of texts and monuments concerning Ȧsȧr and Ȧst which
have already been deciphered by the industry of Egyptologists, remains
the most complete account of the root mystery-myth of ancient Egypt. The
myth of Osiris and Isis goes back to the earliest times of which we have
record, and is always found in the same form. Indeed the “Ritual,” the
“Book of the Dead,” which should rather be called the “Book of the
Living,” might very well be styled “The Gospel of Osiris.”

It would be out of place here to seek for the historical origin of this
Great Mystery; certainly Osiris was originally something greater than a
“water sprite,” as Budge supposes. Osiris and Isis were and are
*originally,* as I believe, cosmic or super-cosmic beings; for the Elder
and Younger Horus, regarded macrocosmically, were the Intelligible and
Sensible Worlds, and, regarded microcosmically, pertained to the mystery
of the Christ-stage of manhood.

It may, of course, be denied that the ancient Egyptians were capable of
entertaining any such notions; we, however, prefer the tradition of our
Trismegistic tractates to the “primitive-culture” theories of
anthropological speculation. That, however, such views were entertained
in the first centuries is incontrovertible, as may be seen from a
careful study of Philo of Alexandria alone. Thus to quote one passage
out of many with regard to the two Horoi:

“For that *this* cosmos is the Younger Son of God, in that it is
perceptible to sense. The Son who’s older than this one, He hath
declared to be no one \[perceptible by sense\], for that he is
conceivable by mind alone.

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But having judged
him worthy of the Elder’s rights, He hath determined that he should
remain with Him alone.” <span id="fr_1276"></span>[1](#fn_1277.md)

When, moreover, we speak of the Christ-stage of manhood, we mean all
that mystery that lies beyond the normal stage of man, including both
the super-man stage and that of the Christ.

In any case, Plutarch is of the greatest service for understanding the
atmosphere and environment in which the students of the Trismegistic
tradition moved, and we have therefore bestowed more care upon him than
perhaps the general reader may think necessary.
