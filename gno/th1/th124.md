##### THE MYSTERY-MYTH

2\. They say that when Rhea <span id="fr_887"></span>[3](#fn_888.md)
secretly united with Kronos, Helios on sensing <span
id="fr_888"></span>[4](#fn_889.md) it imprecated her not to bring forth in
month or year. <span id="fr_889"></span>[5](#fn_890.md)

3\. That Hermes being in love with the Goddess, came to conjunction
\[with her\]; then playing draughts <span
id="fr_890"></span>[6](#fn_891.md) against Selene, <span
id="fr_891"></span>[7](#fn_892.md) and winning <span
id="fr_892"></span>[8](#fn_893.md) the seventieth of each

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

of the lights, he con-duced from all <span
id="fr_893"></span>[1](#fn_894.md) five days and in-duced them into the
three hundred and sixty \[days\]—which Egyptians call the “now
in-duced,” <span id="fr_894"></span>[2](#fn_895.md) and keep as birthdays
of the Gods. <span id="fr_895"></span>[3](#fn_896.md)

4\. \[And they say\] that on the first Osiris was born, and that a voice
fell out <span id="fr_896"></span>[4](#fn_897.md) together with him on his
being brought forth—to wit: “The Lord of all forth comes to light.”

5\. But some say that a certain Pamylē, <span
id="fr_897"></span>[5](#fn_898.md) being moistened <span
id="fr_898"></span>[6](#fn_899.md) from the holy \[place\] of Zeus, heard a
voice directing her to proclaim with outcry that “Great King Good-doing
Osiris is born”; and that because of this she nursed Osiris, Kronos
entrusting him to her, and they keep with mystic rites the Pamylia in
his honour, similar to the Phallephoria. <span
id="fr_899"></span>[7](#fn_900.md)

6\. And on the second \[they say\] Arouēris \[was born\]—whom they call
Apollo, and some call Elder Horus. <span id="fr_900"></span>[8](#fn_901.md)

On the third that Typhon, neither in season nor in place, but breaking
through with a blow, leapt forth through her side. <span
id="fr_901"></span>[9](#fn_902.md)

On the fourth that Isis was born in all moist \[conditions\].

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

On the fifth Nephthys, whom they name End and Aphroditē, while some
\[call\] her also Victory.

7\. And \[they say\] that Osiris and Arouēris were from Helios, Isis
from Hermes, and Typhon and Nephthys from Kronos, and therefore the
kings considering the third <span id="fr_902"></span>[1](#fn_903.md) of the
“induced” \[days\] nefast, used neither to consult nor serve themselves
till night. <span id="fr_903"></span>[2](#fn_904.md)

8\. And \[they say\] that Nephthys was married to Typhon; <span
id="fr_904"></span>[3](#fn_905.md) but Isis and Osiris being in love with
each other, united even before they were born, down in the Womb beneath
the Darkness. <span id="fr_905"></span>[4](#fn_906.md)

9\. Some, moreover, say that Arouēris thus came to birth, and that he is
called Elder Horus by Egyptians, but Apollo by Greeks.

XIII\. 1. And \[they say\] that when Osiris was king, he straightway set
free the Egyptians from a life from which they could find no way out and
like unto that of wild beasts, <span id="fr_906"></span>[5](#fn_907.md)
both setting fruits before them, and laying down laws, and teaching them
to honour the Gods.

2\. And that subsequently he went over the whole earth, clearing
it, <span id="fr_907"></span>[6](#fn_908.md) not in the least requiring
arms, but drawing the multitude to himself by charming them with
persuasion and reason (*logos*), <span id="fr_908"></span>[7](#fn_909.md)
with song and every art the Muses give; <span
id="fr_909"></span>[8](#fn_910.md) and that for this

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

cause he seems to the Greeks to be the same as Dionysus. <span
id="fr_910"></span>[1](#fn_911.md)

3\. And \[they say\] that while he was away, Typhon attempted no
revolution, owing to Isis keeping very careful guard, and having the
power <span id="fr_911"></span>[2](#fn_912.md) in her hands, holding it
fast; but that when he \[Osiris\] came back, he made with art a wile for
him, con-juring seventy-two men, and having as co-worker a queen coming
out of Æthiopia, whom they call Asō. <span
id="fr_912"></span>[3](#fn_913.md)

4\. But that after measuring out for himself in secret the body of
Osiris, <span id="fr_913"></span>[4](#fn_914.md) and having devised,
according to the size, <span id="fr_914"></span>[5](#fn_915.md) a beautiful
and extraordinarily ornamented chest, <span
id="fr_915"></span>[6](#fn_916.md) brought it into the banqueting
hall. <span id="fr_916"></span>[7](#fn_917.md)

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

5\. And that when they were delighted at the sight and wondered, Typhon,
in sport, promised to give the chest to him who could make himself
exactly equal to it by laying himself down in it. <span
id="fr_917"></span>[1](#fn_918.md)

6\. And that when all were trying, one after another, since no one
fitted, Osiris stepped in and laid himself down.

7\. And they who were present running up, dashed on the lid, and, after
some \[of them\] had closed it down with fastenings, and others had
poured hot lead over it, they carried it out to the River, <span
id="fr_918"></span>[2](#fn_919.md) and let it go into the Sea by way of the
Tanitic <span id="fr_919"></span>[3](#fn_920.md) mouth, which \[they say\]
Egyptians call even to this day by a hateful and abominable name.

8\. These things they say were done on the seventeenth of the month
Athur, <span id="fr_920"></span>[4](#fn_921.md) in which \[month\] the Sun
passes through the Scorpion; it being the eight-and-twentieth year of
Osiris’ reign.

9\. Some, however, say that he had lived and not reigned so long. <span
id="fr_921"></span>[5](#fn_922.md)

XIV\. 1. And as the Pans and Satyrs <span
id="fr_922"></span>[6](#fn_923.md) that inhabit round Chemmis <span
id="fr_923"></span>[7](#fn_924.md) were the first to sense the

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

passion <span id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_925.md) \[of Osiris\], and give
tongue concerning what was being done, \[they say\] that on this account
sudden disturbances and emotions of crowds are even unto this day called
“panics.”

2\. But when Isis <span id="fr_925"></span>[2](#fn_926.md) sensed it, she
cut off one of her curls, and put on a mourning dress, whence the city
to this day bears the name Koptō. <span id="fr_926"></span>[3](#fn_927.md)

But others think the name signifies privation, <span
id="fr_927"></span>[4](#fn_928.md) for they say that *koptein* is to
de-prive.

3\. And \[they say\] that she, wandering about in every direction, and
finding no way out, never approached any one without accosting him; nay,
she asked even little children whom she happened to meet, about the
chest.

4\. And they happened to have seen, and showed the mouth <span
id="fr_928"></span>[5](#fn_929.md) through which the friends of Typhon let
the vessel <span id="fr_929"></span>[6](#fn_930.md) go into the Sea.

5\. Because of this \[they say\] Egyptians believe that little children
have prophetic power, and they especially divine from the sounds of
their voices, when playing in the holy places and shouting about
anything.

6. <span id="fr_930"></span>[7](#fn_931.md) And \[they say\] that when
\[Isis\] was aware that

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Osiris in
ignorance had fallen in love and united himself with her sister <span
id="fr_931"></span>[1](#fn_932.md) as with herself, and seeing as proof the
honey-clover <span id="fr_932"></span>[2](#fn_933.md) wreath which he had
left behind with Nephthys, she sought for the babe—(for she \[N.\]
exposed it immediately she bore it, through fear of Typhon <span
id="fr_933"></span>[3](#fn_934).md).

7\. And after it was found with toil and trouble—dogs <span
id="fr_934"></span>[4](#fn_935.md) guiding Isis to it it—was reared and
became her guard and follower, being called Anubis, and is said to guard
the Gods, as *their* dogs men.

XV\. 1. It was from him she got intelligence about the chest:—that after
it had been wave-tossed out by the Sea to the Byblos <span
id="fr_935"></span>[5](#fn_936.md) country, the land-wash had gently
brought it to rest in a certain heather-bush.” <span
id="fr_936"></span>[6](#fn_937.md)

2\. And the heather-bush, in a short time running up into a most
beautiful and very large young tree, enfolded, and grew round it, <span
id="fr_937"></span>[7](#fn_938.md) and hid it entirely within itself.

3\. And the King, <span id="fr_938"></span>[8](#fn_939.md) marvelling at
the greatness of the

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

tree, after cutting off the branches, and rounding off the trunk that
surrounded the coffin without its being seen, <span
id="fr_939"></span>[1](#fn_940.md) set it up as the prop of his roof.

4\. And they say that on her hearing of these things by the daimonian
spirit of a voice, <span id="fr_940"></span>[2](#fn_941.md) Isis came to
Byblos, and, sitting down at a fountain-head, downcast and weeping, held
converse with no one else, but she embraced and showed affection to the
maids of the Queen, curling <span id="fr_941"></span>[3](#fn_942.md) their
hair and exhaling from herself on their skin a marvellous fragrance.

5\. And when the Queen saw her maids, longing for the ambrosia-smelling
hair and skin of the stranger came upon her.

And so when she had been sent for and had become an inmate \[of the
palace, the Queen\] made her nurse of her little one.

6\. And the name of the King, they say, was Malkander, <span
id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_943.md) while her name according to some was
Astarte, according to others Saōsis, and according to others
Nemanous, <span id="fr_943"></span>[5](#fn_944.md)—or whatever is the name
for which the Greek equivalent would be Athenaïs. <span
id="fr_944"></span>[6](#fn_945.md)

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

XVI\. 1. And \[they say\] that instead of giving it <span
id="fr_945"></span>[1](#fn_946.md) the breast, Isis reared the little one
by putting her finger <span id="fr_946"></span>[2](#fn_947.md) into its
mouth, and that at night she burnt round <span
id="fr_947"></span>[3](#fn_948.md) the mortal \[elements\] of its body,
and, turning herself into a swallow, flew round the pillar and twittered
a dirge; until the Queen, through spying \[on her\] and crying out <span
id="fr_948"></span>[4](#fn_949.md) when she saw the babe being burnt round,
deprived it of its immortality. <span id="fr_949"></span>[5](#fn_950.md)

2\. That when the Goddess revealed herself, she claimed for herself the
pillar of the roof; and, taking it down with the greatest care, she cut
away the heather-tree from round it, then wrapping this <span
id="fr_950"></span>[6](#fn_951.md) up in fine linen, and pouring the juices
of sweet herbs over it, <span id="fr_951"></span>[7](#fn_952.md) she placed
it in the hands of the royal couple; and even unto this day the people
of Byblos venerate the wood <span id="fr_952"></span>[8](#fn_953.md) lying
in the holy place of Isis.

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

3\. As for the coffin, she flung herself round it, and kept moaning so
long, that the younger of the little ones of the king died away; <span
id="fr_953"></span>[1](#fn_954.md) and, taking the elder with herself, and
placing the coffin on a boat, she sailed away.

4\. And when the River Phædrus <span id="fr_954"></span>[2](#fn_955.md)
raised too rough a wind <span id="fr_955"></span>[3](#fn_956.md) just after
dawn, <span id="fr_956"></span>[4](#fn_957.md) waxing wrath, she dried up
his stream.

XVII\. 1. And \[they say\] that when first she found solitude and was by
herself, she opened the chest, and laying her face on his face, she
kissed \[him\] and shed tears.

2\. And that when the little one came up in silence from behind and
understood, on sensing it she turned herself about, and passionately
gave him an awe-ful look. And the little one could not hold himself up
against the awe of her, and died.

3\. But some say \[it was\] not thus, but, as it has been said
before, <span id="fr_957"></span>[5](#fn_958.md) that he fell out <span
id="fr_958"></span>[6](#fn_959.md) into the river.

4\. And he has honours owing to the Goddess, for the Manerōs <span
id="fr_959"></span>[7](#fn_960.md) whom Egyptians hymn at their symposia is
he.

5\. While others relate that the boy was called Palæstinos <span
id="fr_960"></span>[8](#fn_961.md) or Pelousios, and that the city <span
id="fr_961"></span>[9](#fn_962.md) was named after him when it was founded
by the Goddess; and that the Manerōs who is hymned was the first to
discover the art of the Muses. <span id="fr_962"></span>[10](#fn_963.md)

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

6\. But some say that it is the name of no one, but a manner of speech
for men drinking and feasting,—with the meaning “May such and such
things be present in becoming measure!” For the Egyptians on every such
occasion shout out this, it being indicated to them by “Manerōs.”

7\. Just as, doubtless, also their being shown the image of a dead man
carried round in a small wooden coffin, is not a reminder of the Osirian
passion, as some suppose; but it is in order to exhort them while filled
with wine to make use of things present, in that all will very presently
be such \[as it\], that they bring in an unpleasing after-revel.

XVIII\. 1. And \[they say\] that when Isis had gone a journey to her son
Horus, who was being reared at Boutos, <span
id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_964.md) and had put away <span
id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_965.md) the chest, <span
id="fr_965"></span>[3](#fn_966.md) Typhon, taking his dogs <span
id="fr_966"></span>[4](#fn_967.md) out by night towards the moon, came upon
it; and recognising the body, tore it into fourteen pieces, and
scattered them abroad.

2\. And Isis \[they say\] on learning this, searched for them in a
papyrus skiff (*baris*) sailing away through the marshes; <span
id="fr_967"></span>[5](#fn_968.md) whence those who sail in papyrus hulls
are not injured by the crocodiles, either because they <span
id="fr_968"></span>[6](#fn_969.md) fear or rather revere the Goddess. <span
id="fr_969"></span>[7](#fn_970.md)

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

3\. And it is because of this \[they say\] that many tombs of Osiris are
spoken of in Egypt <span id="fr_970"></span>[1](#fn_971.md)—through her
performing burial rites on meeting with each piece.

4\. Some, however, say no; but that making herself images \[of them\]
she distributed these to each city, <span
id="fr_971"></span>[2](#fn_972.md) as though she were giving it the
\[whole\] body, in order that it might have honours from the multitude,
and that even if Typhon should get the better of Horus, he might
renounce his search for the true tomb when many were spoken of and
pointed out.

5\. Now, the only one of the parts of Osiris which Isis did not find was
that which causes awe; for that it was cast straightway into the River,
and the scaly-coat, <span id="fr_972"></span>[3](#fn_973.md) and the
devourer, <span id="fr_973"></span>[4](#fn_974.md) and the
sharp-snout <span id="fr_974"></span>[5](#fn_975.md) ate it up—which \[they
say\] among fishes are considered specially expiate; <span
id="fr_975"></span>[6](#fn_976.md) and that Isis, making herself a
counterfeit instead of it, consecrated the phallus; in honour of which
the Egyptians keep festival even to this day. <span
id="fr_976"></span>[7](#fn_977.md)

XIX\. 1. Thereafter Osiris, coming to Horus out of

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

the Invisible, <span id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_978.md) worked through him
and trained him for the fight.

2\. He then put this test question to him: “What does he consider
fairest?” And when he said: “Helping father and mother in ill
plight,”—he asked a second: “What animal does he think most useful for
those who go out to fight?”

3\. And when Horus said “Horse,” he marvelled at him, and was quite
puzzled why he did not say “Lion” rather than “Horse.” <span
id="fr_978"></span>[2](#fn_979.md)

4\. Accordingly Horus said: “‘Lion’ is a needful thing to one requiring
help, but ‘Horse’ \[can\] scatter in pieces the foe in flight and
consume him utterly.” <span id="fr_979"></span>[3](#fn_980.md)

Thus hearing, Osiris rejoiced that Horus was fitly prepared.

5\. And it is said that as many were changing over to the side of Horus,
Thūēris, <span id="fr_980"></span>[4](#fn_981.md) Typhon’s concubine, came
too; and that a certain serpent pursuing after her was cut in pieces by
those round Horus. <span id="fr_981"></span>[5](#fn_982.md) And to-day on
this account they cast down a small rope and cut it in pieces for all to
see. <span id="fr_982"></span>[6](#fn_983.md)

6\. The fight lasted for many days, and Horus won. Nevertheless, when
Isis received Typhon in bonds, she did not make away with him. Far from
it; she unbound him and let him go.

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

7\. Horus, however, did not bear this temperately; but, laying hands on
his mother, he drew off the crown from her head. Whereupon Hermes <span
id="fr_983"></span>[1](#fn_984.md) crowned her with a head-dress of
cow-horns.

8\. And \[they say\] that also when Typhon got the chance of bringing a
bastardy suit against Horus, and Hermes was counsel for the defence,
Horus was judged legitimate by the Gods. <span
id="fr_984"></span>[2](#fn_985.md)

And that \[afterwards\] Typhon was fought under in two other fights.

9\. And that Isis brought forth from her union with Osiris after his
death <span id="fr_985"></span>[3](#fn_986.md) Harpocrates <span
id="fr_986"></span>[4](#fn_987.md)—who missed the month and was weak in his
limbs from below upwards. <span id="fr_987"></span>[5](#fn_988.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_888"></span>[278:3](th124.htm#fr_887.md) The Mother of the
Gods—“Flowing,” that is, motion pure and simple, unordered or chaotic.

<span id="fn_889"></span>[278:4](th124.htm#fr_888.md) In the most primitive
meaning of the word αἰσθόμενον—from √αισ, lengthened form of αι (compare
ἀΐω).

<span id="fn_890"></span>[278:5](th124.htm#fr_889.md) μηνὶ μητ᾽ ἐνιαυτῷ.
Both words are connected with roots meaning “one” in ancient dialects;
μὴν = μ-εὶς (Æol.) and ἔνος = *an-nus* (Lat.). *Cf.* εἵς, μ-ία, ἕν;
hence ἐνι-αυτός = “one-same.” The Goddess, therefore, apart from the
Sun, could only bring forth in a day.

<span id="fn_891"></span>[278:6](th124.htm#fr_890.md) πέττια,—πεσσός was an
oval-shaped stone for playing a game like our draughts; it was also used
for the board on which the game was played, divided by 5 straight lines
each way, and therefore into 36 squares.

<span id="fn_892"></span>[278:7](th124.htm#fr_891.md) *Sc.* the moon.

<span id="fn_893"></span>[278:8](th124.htm#fr_892.md) Or “taking away.”

<span id="fn_894"></span>[279:1](th124.htm#fr_893.md) *Sc.* the lights.

<span id="fn_895"></span>[279:2](th124.htm#fr_894.md) ἐπαγομέναις—or “now
intercalated.”

<span id="fn_896"></span>[279:3](th124.htm#fr_895.md) This is an
exceedingly puzzling statement. The “lights” cannot be the “lights” of
the moon, of which there were 30 phases. It more probably has some
connectipn with 360, the 70th of which works out at 5⋅142857—a number
not so very far removed from our own calculations. The “each” in the
text may thus be an error.

<span id="fn_897"></span>[279:4](th124.htm#fr_896.md) A voice from heaven,
a Bath-kol, proceeding from the Womb of Rhea.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[279:5](th124.htm#fr_897.md) παμίλη—presumably a
play on πᾶν (all) and ὕλη (matter).

<span id="fn_899"></span>[279:6](th124.htm#fr_898.md)
ὑδρευομένην—presumably by the Great Moistener; it is, however, generally
translated “drawing water.”

<span id="fn_900"></span>[279:7](th124.htm#fr_899.md) That is the
“Phallus-Bearing.”

<span id="fn_901"></span>[279:8](th124.htm#fr_900.md) Eg. Heru-ur.

<span id="fn_902"></span>[279:9](th124.htm#fr_901.md) πλεῦρα—meaning in man
radically “rib”; also side of a square, and root of a square (or cubic)
number. Typhon would be represented by the diagonal.

<span id="fn_903"></span>[280:1](th124.htm#fr_902.md) That is, the birthday
of Typhon.

<span id="fn_904"></span>[280:2](th124.htm#fr_903.md) A strange sentence;
but as the kings were considered Gods, they probably worshipped
themselves, or at least their own *ka,* and consulted themselves as
oracles.

<span id="fn_905"></span>[280:3](th124.htm#fr_904.md) Presumably as being
opposite, or as hating one another.

<span id="fn_906"></span>[280:4](th124.htm#fr_905.md) *Cf.* liv. 4.

<span id="fn_907"></span>[280:5](th124.htm#fr_906.md) Metaphors reminiscent
of the symbolism of the so-called Book of the Dead.

<span id="fn_908"></span>[280:6](th124.htm#fr_907.md) *Sc.* of wild beasts;
but may also mean “softening it,” when Osiris stands for Water, and
again “making it mild,” or “civilising it.”

<span id="fn_909"></span>[280:7](th124.htm#fr_908.md) He himself being the
Logos.

<span id="fn_910"></span>[280:8](th124.htm#fr_909.md) μουσικῆς—music, in
the modern meaning of the term, was only one of the arts of the Muses,
the nine daughters of Zeus.

<span id="fn_911"></span>[281:1](th124.htm#fr_910.md) Διό-νυσος—that is,
“he of the Mount (νῦσα) of Zeus.”

<span id="fn_912"></span>[281:2](th124.htm#fr_911.md) That is
“sovereignty.”

<span id="fn_913"></span>[281:3](th124.htm#fr_912.md) Probably the
prototype of the Alchemical Azoth. Æthiopia was the land of the black
folk south of Egypt, the land *par excellence* of the black magicians as
opposed to the good ones of the Egyptians (this, of course, being the
Egyptian point of view). The Osiris-myth was in Egyptian, presumably, as
easily interpretable into the language of magic and con-juration as into
other values. Compare the Demotic folk-tales of Khamuas, in Grifiith’s
*Stories of the High Priests of Memphis,* for how this view of it would
read in Egyptian. Æthiopia would also mean the Dark Earth as opposed to
the Light Heaven.

<span id="fn_914"></span>[281:4](th124.htm#fr_913.md) The “body of Osiris”
may mean the cosmos (great or little), as the “body of Adam,” its copy
in the Kabalah.

<span id="fn_915"></span>[281:5](th124.htm#fr_914.md) Or, “according to the
greatness”—using “greatness” in its Gnostic signification, as here
meaning the great cosmos and also the cosmic body of man.

<span id="fn_916"></span>[281:6](th124.htm#fr_915.md) In Pythagorean terms,
“an odd-ly ordered rectangular encasement”—referring, perhaps, to a
certain configuration of cosmic permanent atoms. But see the plate which
Isaac Myer calls “A Medieval Idea of the Makrokosm, in the Heavenly
Zodiacal Ark,” but which intitles itself “*Forma Exterior Arcæ Noë ex
Descriptione Mosis*.” This is a coffin, and within it lies the dead
Christ. The plate is prefixed to p. 439 of Myer’s *Qabbalah*
(Philadelphia, 1888). It also presumably refers to the “germ” of the
cosmic robe of the purified man, the “robe of glory.” In mysticism the
metaphors cannot be kept unmixed, for it is the apotheosis of
syncretism.

<span id="fn_917"></span>[281:7](th124.htm#fr_916.md) Lit., the “drinking
together,” referring perhaps to the conjunction of certain cosmic
forces, and also microcosmically to souls in a state of joy or festivity
or bliss, prior to incarnation.

<span id="fn_918"></span>[282:1](th124.htm#fr_917.md) That is, prove the
“permanent atoms” were his own—if we think in terms of reincarnation.

<span id="fn_919"></span>[282:2](th124.htm#fr_918.md) *Sc.* the Sacred
Nile, Great Jordan, etc., the Stream of Ocean, which, flowing downwards,
is the birth of men, and upwards, the birth of Gods.

<span id="fn_920"></span>[282:3](th124.htm#fr_919.md) ταν-ιτικοῦ—probably a
word-play connected with √ταν, “to stretch,” and so make tense or thin,
or expand, and so the “widestretched mouth of the Great River.” *Cf.*
the Titans or Stretchers.

<span id="fn_921"></span>[282:4](th124.htm#fr_920.md) Copt. Hathōr—corr.
roughly to November.

<span id="fn_922"></span>[282:5](th124.htm#fr_921.md) *Cf.* xlii. 4.

<span id="fn_923"></span>[282:6](th124.htm#fr_922.md) Two classes of
elemental existences.

<span id="fn_924"></span>[282:7](th124.htm#fr_923.md) That is Ȧpu, the
Panopolis of the Greeks; the name Chemmis, the modern Akhmīm, is derived
from an old Egyptian name. See Budge, *op. cit.,* ii. 188.

<span id="fn_925"></span>[283:1](th124.htm#fr_924.md) πάθος—the technical
term of what was enacted in the mystery-drama.

<span id="fn_926"></span>[283:2](th124.htm#fr_925.md) As Mother Nature.

<span id="fn_927"></span>[283:3](th124.htm#fr_926.md) Meaning “I cut”; and
in mid. “I cut or beat the breast,” as a sign of mourning.

<span id="fn_928"></span>[283:4](th124.htm#fr_927.md) “The depriving things
of their power” or “negation”; Osiris being the fertilising or
generative or positive power.

<span id="fn_929"></span>[283:5](th124.htm#fr_928.md) *Sc.* the way or
passage. In little children the life force is not sexually polarised.

<span id="fn_930"></span>[283:6](th124.htm#fr_929.md) ἀγγεῖον—a vase or
vessel of any kind, hence funerary urn or even coffin; but μεταγγίζειν
means “to pour from one vessel into another,” and μεταγγισμὸς is the
Pythagorean technical term for metempsychosis or palingenesis.

<span id="fn_931"></span>[283:7](th124.htm#fr_930.md) This paragraph, which
breaks the narrative, is introduced to give the myth of the birth of
Anubis.

<span id="fn_932"></span>[284:1](th124.htm#fr_931.md) *Sc.* Nephthys.

<span id="fn_933"></span>[284:2](th124.htm#fr_932.md) Meli-lote—*lotos* in
Greek stands for several plants; it might be translated as
“honey-lotus.” *Cf.* xxxviii. 5.

<span id="fn_934"></span>[284:3](th124.htm#fr_933.md) Her legitimate
spouse.

<span id="fn_935"></span>[284:4](th124.htm#fr_934.md) A term used
frequently among the Greeks (who presumably got the idea elsewhere) for
the servants, agents, or watchers of the higher Gods; thus the Eagle is
called the “winged dog” of Zeus Æsch., *Pr.,* 1022). “Dog,” as we have
seen (xi. 1, n.) signifies a power of the World, Soul or Great Animal,
also of individual souls.

<span id="fn_936"></span>[284:5](th124.htm#fr_935.md) That is, “Papyrus.”
This Byblos was a “city in the Papyrus Swamps of the Delta.” (So Budge,
*op. cit.,* ii. 190.)

<span id="fn_937"></span>[284:6](th124.htm#fr_936.md) ἐρείκη—probably a
play on the root-meaning of ἐρείκειν, “to quiver,” is intended. The
Egyptian *erīca* was taller and more bushy than ours. Or it may be the
tamarisk; elsewhere it is called a mulberry-tree.

<span id="fn_938"></span>[284:7](th124.htm#fr_937.md) *Sc.* the
“coffin”—perhaps here signifying what has lately been called the
“permanent atom” in man.

<span id="fn_939"></span>[284:8](th124.htm#fr_938.md) The ruler of the
form-side of things.

<span id="fn_940"></span>[285:1](th124.htm#fr_939.md) On the erroneously
called “Gnostic” gems, the lopped trunk is a frequent symbol; the lopped
“five-branched,” presumably.

<span id="fn_941"></span>[285:2](th124.htm#fr_940.md) Notice the three
stages of awareness: (i.) the babbling of children; (ii.) the
intelligence given by the dog; (iii.) the daimonian spirit of a voice
(Heb. *Bath-kol*).

<span id="fn_942"></span>[285:3](th124.htm#fr_941.md) Isis, when she first
lost Osiris, cut off a curl (xiv. 2).

<span id="fn_943"></span>[285:4](th124.htm#fr_942.md) Apparently, though
curiously, a play on the Semitic *MLK* or *Malek,* “king,” and the Greek
*andr,* “man”—that is, “king of men.”

<span id="fn_944"></span>[285:5](th124.htm#fr_943.md) Or “Nemanōs.” The
names seem to have been impartially maltreated by the copyists; thus we
find such variants as Aspartē, Sooses, Neimanoë.

<span id="fn_945"></span>[285:6](th124.htm#fr_944.md) There was among the
ancients an art of name-translation, as Plato tells us in the Story of
Atlantis, in which the Atlantic names he says, were translated into
Greek by Solon or by the priests of Saïs. Here, I believe, there is also
a word-play intended. Isis, as we have seen, was pre-eminently Nurse,
τίτθη, a further intensification of the intensified τί-θη; from √θα,
“suckle”; the common form of “nurse” was τι-θή-νη. On the contrary,
ἀθηναΐς is a daughter or derivative of ἀ-θή-νη, one who does not give
suck; for Athena was born from the head and was the virgin goddess *par
excellence*. Mythologically, Athenais was wife of Alalkomeneus, the
eponymous hero of a city in Bœotia, where was a very ancient temple of
Athena. In the Pindaric ode quoted in S. (1) of chapter, “Myth of Man in
the Mysteries,” Alalkomeneus is given as one of the equivalents for the
“first man.”

<span id="fn_946"></span>[286:1](th124.htm#fr_945.md) The child’s name was
Diktys, according to viii. 2.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[286:2](th124.htm#fr_946.md) The √δεκ in δάκτυλος
is said to be the same as that in δέκα, “ten,” and “ten” is the number
of “perfection.”

<span id="fn_948"></span>[286:3](th124.htm#fr_947.md) Or “away.”

<span id="fn_949"></span>[286:4](th124.htm#fr_948.md) Lit., “croaking” like
a raven, to match the “twittering” of the swallow.

<span id="fn_950"></span>[286:5](th124.htm#fr_949.md) This presumably hints
that Isis, as the Divine Mother, endeavours to make all perfect and
sound, while the earthly mother prevents this.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[286:6](th124.htm#fr_950.md) *Sc.* the *erīca*.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[286:7](th124.htm#fr_951.md) *Cf.* John xix. 40:
“So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in fine linen together
with sweet herbs.”

<span id="fn_953"></span>[286:8](th124.htm#fr_952.md) τὸ ξύλον—the term
used repeatedly in the New Testament for the cross.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[287:1](th124.htm#fr_953.md) Or “swooned,” or lost
consciousness.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[287:2](th124.htm#fr_954.md) φάιδρος—lit., Bright,
Beaming, Shining—that is, the Sun-stream.

<span id="fn_956"></span>[287:3](th124.htm#fr_955) Or “breath” (πνεῦμα.md).

<span id="fn_957"></span>[287:4](th124.htm#fr_956.md) That is “at
sun-rise.”

<span id="fn_958"></span>[287:5](th124.htm#fr_957.md) *Cf.* viii. 2.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[287:6](th124.htm#fr_958.md) *Sc.* of the boat of
Isis.

<span id="fn_960"></span>[287:7](th124.htm#fr_959.md) Μαν-έρως. I fancy
this is a play, in conjunction with the κατα-μαν-θάν-οντα, and
ἀπο-θάν-οντα (the “understanding” and “dying away”) above; the name
would then mean either “love of understanding” or “understanding of
love.”

<span id="fn_961"></span>[287:8](th124.htm#fr_960.md) παλαιστινός—perhaps a
play on παλαιστής, “a wrestler”; hence a “rival” or “suitor.”

<span id="fn_962"></span>[287:9](th124.htm#fr_961.md) Pelusium; the
Pelusian was the eastern mouth of the Nile.

<span id="fn_963"></span>[287:10](th124.htm#fr_962.md) See note on xii. 1.

<span id="fn_964"></span>[288:1](th124.htm#fr_963.md) Generally supposed to
stand for the city Butō, but may be some word-play. Can it be connected
with Boōtes, the Ploughman—the constellation Arcturus—the voyage being
celestial; that is, a movement of the world-soul or change of state in
the individual soul? Budge (p. 192) gives its Egyptian equivalent as
Per-Uatchit, *i.e.* “House of the Eye.”

<span id="fn_965"></span>[288:2](th124.htm#fr_964.md) Lit., from her feet.

<span id="fn_966"></span>[288:3](th124.htm#fr_965.md) Lit., vessel; may
also mean “cell.”

<span id="fn_967"></span>[288:4](th124.htm#fr_966.md) *Vulg.,* “hunting.”

<span id="fn_968"></span>[288:5](th124.htm#fr_967.md) ἕλη—a probable play
on the δι-ελεῖν (“tear to pieces”) above.

<span id="fn_969"></span>[288:6](th124.htm#fr_968.md) *Sc.* the crocodiles.

<span id="fn_970"></span>[288:7](th124.htm#fr_969.md) It is remarkable how
that every now and then Plutarch inserts apparently the most naïve
superstitions without a word of explanation. They cannot be all simply
irresponsible *on dits*. It is, perhaps, not without significance that
the “chest” is first of all drifted to the Papyrus country, and that the
*baris* of Isis should be made of papyrus. It seems almost as if it
symbolised some “vehicle” that was safe from the “crocodile” of the
deep. In other words, the skiffs are not paper boats and the crocodiles
not alligators.

<span id="fn_971"></span>[289:1](th124.htm#fr_970.md) “And Egypt *they say*
is the body” to quote a refrain from Hippolytus concerning the
“Gnostics.”

<span id="fn_972"></span>[289:2](th124.htm#fr_971.md) Presumably of the
fourteen sacred ones.

<span id="fn_973"></span>[289:3](th124.htm#fr_972.md) λεπιδωτόν.

<span id="fn_974"></span>[289:4](th124.htm#fr_973.md) φάγρον.

<span id="fn_975"></span>[289:5](th124.htm#fr_974.md) ὀξύρυγχον.

<span id="fn_976"></span>[289:6](th124.htm#fr_975.md) Anthropologically,
“taboo.”

<span id="fn_977"></span>[289:7](th124.htm#fr_976.md) What these “fourteen
parts” of Osiris may be is beyond the sphere of dogmatism. I would
suggest that there may be along one line some connection with those
seeds of life which have lately been called “permanent atoms”; and along
another line, that of the birth of the Christ-consciousness, there may
be a series of powers derived from past incarnations.

<span id="fn_978"></span>[290:1](th124.htm#fr_977.md) Hades.

<span id="fn_979"></span>[290:2](th124.htm#fr_978.md) The “Horse” may
symbolise purified passion, and “Lion” a certain receptive power of the
mind.

<span id="fn_980"></span>[290:3](th124.htm#fr_979.md) The white “Horse” was
presumably opposed to the red “Ass” of Typhon, as the purified vehicle
of the soul contrasted with the impure. “Lion” was one of the grades in
the Mithriac Mysteries; it was a sun-animal.

<span id="fn_981"></span>[290:4](th124.htm#fr_980.md) Eg. Ta-urt (Budge,
*op. cit.,* p. 193).

<span id="fn_982"></span>[290:5](th124.htm#fr_981.md) That is, by the
Companions of Horus (or Disciples of the Christ)—a frequent scene in the
vignettes of the Book of the Dead.

<span id="fn_983"></span>[290:6](th124.htm#fr_982.md) That is, in the
public mystery processions.

<span id="fn_984"></span>[291:1](th124.htm#fr_983.md) The symboliser as
well as the interpreter of the Gods.

<span id="fn_985"></span>[291:2](th124.htm#fr_984.md) *Cf.* liv. 3.

<span id="fn_986"></span>[291:3](th124.htm#fr_985.md) Or it may mean
“completion” (τελευτήν).

<span id="fn_987"></span>[291:4](th124.htm#fr_986.md) In Eg. Ḥeru-p-khart,
*i.e.,* “Horus the Younger.”

<span id="fn_988"></span>[291:5](th124.htm#fr_987.md) τοῖς κάτωθεν
γυίοις—but, presumably, not from above downwards.
