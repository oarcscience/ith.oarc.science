### V

#### THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE ACCORDING TO MANETHO, HIGH PRIEST OF EGYPT

##### HERMES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HELLENISTIC PERIOD

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> more intimate contact of Greek
thought and philosophy with Egyptian lore and mystic tradition began
immediately with the brilliant era of the Lagides, who gradually made
Alexandria the intellectual and religious, philosophic and scientific,
centre of the Hellenistic world.

Thoth-Hermes, as we have seen, had been for the Egyptians from the
earliest times the teacher of all ancient and hidden wisdom; he was *par
excellence* the writer of all sacred scripture and the scribe of the
gods. We should then naturally expect that his dominating influence
would play a leading part in the new development; and this, indeed, is
amply demonstrated by the evidence of the religious art of the time,
which presents us with specimens of statues of the Greek type of Hermes,
bearing at the same time either the feather of truth (the special symbol
of Maāt) on the head, or the papyrus-roll in the hand <span
id="fr_199"></span>[1](#fn_199.md)—both symbols of Thoth in his dual
character as revealer and scribe.

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

Of the complex nature of the mystic and apocalyptic literature that thus
came into existence we have very distinct testimony. <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_200.md) In keeping with its Egyptian prototype
it was all cast in a theological and theosophical mould, whether it
treated of physics, or medicine, or astrology. Thus we learn that
Pamphilus, the grammarian, <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_201.md) was
intimately acquainted with a Greek-Egyptian literature dealing with
“sacred plants” and their virtues as determined by the influences of the
thirty-six Decans; this lore, he tells us, was derived from the “Books
ascribed to the Egyptian Hermes.” <span id="fr_202"></span>[3](#fn_202.md)

##### PETOSIRIS AND NECHEPSO

Of still greater interest are the Greek fragments of Petosiris and
Nechepso which have come down to us. <span
id="fr_203"></span>[4](#fn_203.md) These Greek fragments are to be dated at
least before the end of the second century B.C., <span
id="fr_204"></span>[5](#fn_204.md) and afford us striking parallels with
our extant Trismegistic literature.

In them we find the Prophet Petosiris represented as the teacher and
counsellor of King Nechepso, as Asclepius of Ammon in one type of our
literature; while it is Hermes who reveals the secret wisdom to two
younger gods, Asclepius and Anubis, as in our sermons he does to
Asclepius and Tat.

As to Petosiris himself, Suidas (*s.v.*) tells us that he was an
Egyptian philosopher who wrote on comparative

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greek and Egyptian
theology, making selections from the “Holy Books,” and treating of
astrology and the Egyptian Mysteries. Moreover, Proclus <span
id="fr_205"></span>[1](#fn_205.md) tells us that Petosiris had an intimate
knowledge of every order of the Gods and Angels, and refers to a
hieratic formula of theurgic invocation to the greatest of the goddesses
(Necessity), for inducing the vision of this Power, and the ritual of
the manner of addressing her when she appeared, as handed on by the same
Petosiris.

The mystical nature of this literature is still more clearly shown in
what Vettius Valens <span id="fr_206"></span>[2](#fn_206.md) tells us of
Nechepso, who surpassed the Ammon of our literature and attained to
direct knowledge of the Inner Way.

Vettius, in the first half of the first century A.D., laments that he
did not live in those days of initiate kings and rulers and sages who
occupied themselves with the Sacred Science, when the clear Æther spake
face to face with them without disguise, or holding back aught, in
answer to their deep scrutiny of holy things. In those days so great was
their love of the holy mysteries, so high their virtue, that they left
the earth below them, and in their deathless souls became
“heaven-walkers” <span id="fr_207"></span>[3](#fn_207.md) and knowers of
things divine.

Vettius then quotes from a Greek apocalyptic treatise of Nechepso, where
the King tells us that he had remained in contemplation all night gazing
into the æther; and so in ecstasy he had left his body, <span
id="fr_208"></span>[4](#fn_208.md) and had then heard a heavenly
Voice <span id="fr_209"></span>[5](#fn_209.md) addressing him. This Voice
was not merely a sound, but appeared as a

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

substantial presence, who guided Nechepso on his way through the
heaven-space.

It is, moreover, exceedingly probable that the magnificent spectacle of
the star-spheres <span id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210.md) to which Vettius
refers, speaking of it as “the most transcendent and most blessed vision
(θεωρία) of all,” was taken directly from the same source.

With this we may compare the wish of Trismegistus that Tat might get him
the wings of the soul and enjoy that fair sight, <span
id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211.md) and the seeing of it by Hermes himself
through the Mind. <span id="fr_212"></span>[3](#fn_212.md)

All of which proves the existence of books in Greek in middle Ptolemaic
times treating in the same manner of identical subjects with those
contained in our Trismegistic literature.

##### MANETHO THE BELOVED OF THOTH

When, then, the sovereignty of Egypt passed into the hands of the
Diadochi of Alexander, and the Ptolemies made Alexandria the centre of
learning in the Greek world, by the foundation of the ever-famous Museum
and Library and Schools in their capital, there arose an extraordinary
enthusiasm for translating, paraphrasing, and summarising into Greek of
the old scriptures and records of the nations. The most famous name of
such translators and compilers and comparative theologians is that of
Manetho, <span id="fr_213"></span>[4](#fn_213.md) who introduced the

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

treasures of Egyptian mysticism, theology, mythology, history, and
chronology to the Grecian world. Moreover, seeing that the veracity and
reliability of Manetho as a historian is with every day more and more
accepted as we become better acquainted with the monuments, he seems to
have done his work loyally enough.

Manetho was contemporary with the first two Ptolemies; that is to say,
he lived in the last years of the fourth and the first half of the third
century B.C. He was a priest of Heliopolis (On), <span
id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_214.md) and was thoroughly trained in all Greek
culture <span id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_215.md) as well as being most
learned in the ancient Wisdom of Egypt. <span
id="fr_216"></span>[3](#fn_216.md) Manetho not only wrote on historical
subjects, but also on the mystic philosophy and religion of his country,
and it is from his books in all probability that Plutarch and others
drew their information on things Egyptian. Manetho derived his
information from the hieroglyphic inscriptions in the temples <span
id="fr_217"></span>[4](#fn_217.md) and from the rest of the priestly
records; but unfortunately his books are almost entirely lost, and we
only possess fragments quoted by later writers.

##### THE LETTER OF MANETHO TO PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS

One of these quotations is of great importance for our present enquiry.
It is preserved by Georgius

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Syncellus, <span
id="fr_218"></span>[1](#fn_218.md) and is stated to be taken from a work of
Manetho called *Sothis* <span id="fr_219"></span>[2](#fn_219.md) a work
that has otherwise entirely disappeared. The passage with the
introductory sentence of the monk Syncellus runs as follows:

“It is proposed then to make a few extracts concerning the Egyptian
dynasties from the Books of Manetho. \[This Manetho,\] being high priest
of the Heathen temples in Egypt, based his replies \[to King Ptolemy\]
on the monuments <span id="fr_220"></span>[3](#fn_220.md) which lay in the
Seriadic country. \[These monuments,\] he tells us, were engraved in the
sacred language and in the characters of the sacred writing by Thoth,
the first Hermes; after the flood they were translated from the sacred
language into the then common tongue, <span
id="fr_221"></span>[4](#fn_221.md) but \[still written\] in hieroglyphic
characters, and stored away in books by the Good Daimon’s son and the
second Hermes, father of Tat—in the inner chambers of the temples of
Egypt.

‘“In the *Book of Sothis* Manetho addresses King Philadelphus, the
second Ptolemy, personally, writing as follows word for word:

“‘The Letter of Manetho, the Sebennyte, to Ptolemy Philadelphus.

“‘To the great King Ptolemy Philadelphus, the venerable: I, Manetho,
high priest and scribe of the holy fanes in Egypt, citizen of Heliopolis
but by birth a Sebennyte, <span id="fr_222"></span>[5](#fn_222.md) to my
master Ptolemy send greeting.

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

“‘We <span id="fr_223"></span>[1](#fn_223.md) must make calculations
concerning all the points which you may wish us to examine into, to
answer your questions <span id="fr_224"></span>[2](#fn_224.md) concerning
what will happen to the world. According to your commands, the sacred
books, written by our forefather Thrice-greatest Hermes, which I study,
shall be shown to you. My lord and king, farewell.’”

##### THE IMPORTANCE OF MANETHO’S STATEMENT IN HIS “SOTHIS”

Here we have a verbal quotation from a document purporting to be written
prior to 250 B.C. It is evidently one of a number of letters exchanged
between Manetho and Ptolemy II. Ptolemy has heard of the past according
to the records of Egypt; can the priests tell him anything of the
future? They can, replies Manetho; but it will be necessary to make a
number of calculations. Ptolemy has also expressed a strong desire to
see the documents from which Manetho derived his information, and the
high priest promises to let him see them.

These books are ascribed to Hermes, the Thrice-greatest, and this is the
first time that the title is used in extant Greek literature. This
Hermes was the second, the father of Tat, we are told elsewhere by
Manetho, and son of the Good Spirit (Agathodaimon), who was the first
Hermes. Here we have the precise grading of the degrees in our
treatises: (i.) The Shepherd of Men, or The Mind; (ii.) Thrice-greatest;
(iii.) Tat. This refers to the ever-present distinction of pupil and
master, and the Master of masters.

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

If, however, we seek for historical allusions, we may perhaps be
permitted to conclude that the first Hermes, that is to say the first
priesthood among the Egyptians, used a sacred language, or in other
words a language which in the time of the second Hermes, or second
priesthood, was no longer spoken. It was presumably archaic Egyptian.
The two successions of priests and prophets were separated by a “flood.”
This “flood” was presumably connected with, if not the origin of, the
flood of which Solon heard from the priest of Saïs, which happened some
nine thousand years before his time, and of which we have considerable
information given us in the *Timæus* and *Critias* of Plato. <span
id="fr_225"></span>[1](#fn_225.md) The Good Angel is the same as the Mind,
as we learn from the Trismegistic literature, and was regarded as the
father of Hermes Trismegistus. This seems to be a figurative way of
saying that the archaic civilisation of Egypt before the flood, which
presumably swept over the country when the Atlantic Island went down,
was regarded as one of great excellence. It was the time of the Gods or
Divine Kings or Demi-Gods, whose wisdom was handed on in mystic
tradition, or revived into some semblance of its former greatness, by
the lesser descendants of that race who returned from exile, or
reincarnated on earth, to take charge of the new populations who had
gradually returned to the lower Nile plains after the flood had
subsided.

Thus we have three epochs of tradition of the Egyptian mystery-cultus:
(i.) The first Thoth or Agathodaimon, the original tradition preserved
in the sacred language and character in the stone monuments of the

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Seriadic land,
presumably the Egypt prior to the Atlantic flood; (ii.) the second
Thoth, the Thrice-greatest, the mystery-school after the period of the
great inundation, whose records and doctrines were preserved not only in
inscriptions but also in MSS., still written in the sacred character,
but in the Egyptian tongue as it was spoken after the people reoccupied
the country; and (iii.) Tat, the priesthood of Manetho’s day, and
presumably of some centuries prior to his time, who spoke a yet later
form of Egyptian, and from whose demotic translations further
translations or paraphrases were made in Greek.

##### IS “SOTHIS” A FORGERY?

This natural line of descent of the fundamental doctrines in the
tradition of the Trismegistic literature, however, is scouted by
encyclopædism, which would have our sermons to be Neoplatonic forgeries,
though on what slender grounds it bases its view we have already seen.
It will now be interesting to see how the testimony of Manetho is
disposed of. Our encyclopædias tell us that the book *Sothis is
obviously* a late forgery; parrot-like they repeat this statement; but
nowhere in them do we find a single word of proof brought forward. Let
us then see whether any scholars have dealt with the problem outside of
encyclopædism. Very little work has been done on the subject. The
fullest summary of the position is given by C. Müller. <span
id="fr_226"></span>[1](#fn_226.md) Müller bases his assertion on
Böckh, <span id="fr_227"></span>[2](#fn_227.md) and Böckh on
Letronne. <span id="fr_228"></span>[3](#fn_228.md)

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

The arguments are as follows: (i.) That the term “venerable” (σεβαστός)
is not used prior to the time of the Roman emperors; (ii.) that Egypt
knows no flood; (iii.) that the ancient mythology of Egypt knows no
first and second Hermes; (iv.) that Egypt has no Seriadic land; (v.)
that the term “Trismegistus” is of late use.

##### THE ARGUMENTS OF ENCYCLOPÆDISM REFUTED

Let us take these arguments in order and examine them, bearing in mind,
however, that the whole question has been prejudiced from the start, and
that encyclopædism, in order to maintain its hypothesis of the
spuriousness of our Trismegistic writings, is *bound* to argue the
spuriousness of Manetho’s *Sothis*. The categorical statements of
Manetho are exceedingly distressing to the former hypothesis; in fact,
they give it the lie direct. As to the arguments, then:

(i.) The term σεβαστός is in later times equated with “Augustus,” the
honorific title of the Roman emperors. Therefore, it is argued, it could
not have been used prior to their times. But why not? The king to an
Egyptian was *divine*—every inscription proves it—and the term
“venerable” was in early times always applied to the Gods. Why not then
apply it to the “Great King”? Indeed, what could be more natural than to
do so?

(ii.) We have already shown that, according to Plato, Egypt knew most
accurately of a Flood; Plato further tells us that Solon got his
information from the priests of Saïs, who told him that all the records
were preserved in the temple of Neïth.

It is not here the place to discuss the *Atlanticum* of Plato and the
long history of opinion connected with

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

it, for that would require a volume in itself. I have, however,
acquainted myself with all the arguments for and against the
authenticity of at least the germ of this tradition, and with the
problems of comparative mythology and folklore involved in it, and also
with the recent literature of the subject which seeks to corroborate the
main conceptions of Plato by the researches of seership. All this, taken
in conjunction with the general subject of the “myths” of Plato, and the
latest views on this subject, has convinced me that the greatest of
Greek philosophers did not jest when, his dialectic having gone as far
as it could, he sought refuge in the mystery-traditions for
corroboration of those intuitions which his unaided intellect could not
demonstrate.

It can of course be argued that every reference to a flood in Egyptian
Hellenistic literature is but a repetition of what the incredulous must
regard as Plato’s brilliant romance; but in this connection, as in many
others, it is equally arguable that all such references—Plato’s
included—are derivable from one and the same source—namely, Egypt
herself.

And, indeed, on 9th November 1904, at a meeting of the Society of
Biblical Archæology, a paper by Professor Naville was read by Mr F.
Legge on “A Mention of a Flood in the Book of the Dead.” The flood in
question is that described in the Leyden version as Ch. clxxv. <span
id="fr_229"></span>[1](#fn_229.md)

(iii.) Cicero (106-44 B.C.) speaks of five Mercurii, the last *two* of
whom were Egyptian. <span id="fr_230"></span>[2](#fn_230.md) One was the
“son of Father Nile,” whose name the Egyptians considered it impiety to
pronounce—and for whom, presumably, they substituted the term
Agathodaimon; and the

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

second was the later Thoyth, the-founder of Hermopolis. <span
id="fr_231"></span>[1](#fn_231.md) Cicero could hardly have invented this;
it must have been a commonplace of his day, most probably derived in the
first instance from the writings of Manetho, from which generally the
Greeks, and those imbued with Greek culture, derived all their
information about Egypt.

And, indeed, Reitzenstein (p. 139), though he refers the information
given by Syncellus to a Pseudo-Manetho (without a word of explanation,
however), admits that the genealogy of Hermes there given is in its main
features old. <span id="fr_232"></span>[2](#fn_232.md)

##### THE SERIADIC LAND

(iv.) The statement that Egypt knew no Seriadic land or country seems to
be a confident assertion, but the following considerations may perhaps
throw a different light on the matter.

In the astronomical science of the Egyptians the most conspicuous solar
system near our own, represented in the heavens by the brilliant Sirius,
was of supreme interest. Cycles of immense importance were determined by
it, and it entered into the highest mysticism of Egyptian initiation.
Sirius was, as it were, the guardian star of Egypt. Now ancient Egypt
was a sacred land, laid out in its nomes or provinces according to the
heavens, having centres in its body corresponding to the centres or
ganglia of the heavens. As the Hindus had a Heavenly Ganges
(Ākāsha-Gangā) and an earthly Ganges, so had the heavens a Celestial

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Nile, and Egypt a
physical Nile, the life-giver of the land. The yearly inundation, which
meant and means everything for ancient and modern Khem, was observed
with great minuteness, and recorded with immense pains, the basis of its
cycle being the Sothiac or Siriadic; Sirius (Seirios) being called in
Greek transliteration Sothis and Seth (Eg. Sepṭ). What more natural
name, then, to give to the country than the Seriadic Land?

The Nile records in ancient times were self-registered by pyramids,
obelisks, and temples, and in later times nearly all monuments were
built according to the type of the masonic instruments of the Egyptian
astrogeological science. This science has been studied in our own times
by an Egyptian, and the results of his researches have been printed “for
private circulation,” and a copy of them is to be found in the British
Museum. In his Preface the author writes as follows: <span
id="fr_233"></span>[1](#fn_233.md)

“The astrogeological science gave birth to a monumental system, by means
of which the fruits of the accumulated observations and experience of
the human race have been preserved, outliving writings, inscriptions,
traditions, and nationalities. The principal monuments had imparted to
them the essential property of being autochronous landmarks of a
geochronological nature. Many of them recorded, hydromathematically, the
knowledge in astronomy, in geography, and in the dimension and figure of
the earth obtained in their respective epochs. They were Siriadic
monuments, because their magistral lines were projected to the scale

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

of the revolutions of the cycles of the star Surios (*sic*) in terms of
the standard astrogeological cubit.”

Doubtless our author flogs his theory too severely, as all such writers
do; but nilometry and the rest was certainly one of the most important
branches of the priestly science.

##### THE STELÆ OF HERMES

But before we deal with the last objection urged against the
authenticity of Manetho’s *Sothis,* we will add a few words more
concerning these Seriadic monuments known in antiquity as the Stelae of
Hermes or of Seth, and erroneously spoken of in Latin and English as the
“Columns” or “Pillars” of Hermes.

The general reader may perhaps be puzzled at the variety of spelling of
the name of the star, but he should recollect that the difficulties of
transliteration from one language to another are always great, and
especially so when the two languages belong to different families. Thus
we find the variants of Teḥuti, the Egyptian name of Hermes,
transliterated in no less than nineteen various forms in Greek and two
in Latin—such as Thoyth, Thath, Tat, etc. <span
id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_234.md) Similarly we find the name of the famous
Indian lawgiver transliterated into English as Manu, Menu, Menoo, etc.

With regard to these “Mercurii Columnæ,” it was the common tradition, as
we have already pointed out, that Pythagoras, Plato, and others got
their wisdom from these columns, that is to say, monuments. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_235.md) The

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

historian Ammianus Marcellinus, <span id="fr_236"></span>[1](#fn_236.md)
the friend of the Emperor Julian, has preserved for us a peculiarity of
the construction of some of these pyramids or temples which is of
interest. The passage to which we refer runs as follows:

“There are certain underground galleries and passages full of windings,
which, it is said, the adepts in the ancient rites (knowing that the
flood was coming, and fearing that the memory of the sacred ceremonies
would be obliterated) constructed in various places, distributed in the
interior \[of the buildings\], which were mined out with great labour.
And levelling the walls, <span id="fr_237"></span>[2](#fn_237.md) they
engraved on them numerous kinds of birds and animals, and countless
varieties \[of creatures\] of another world, which they called
hieroglyphic characters.” <span id="fr_238"></span>[3](#fn_238.md)

We are thus told of another peculiarity of some of the Seriadic
monuments, and of the “Books preserved from the Flood” of which there
were so many traditions. These are the records to which Sanchuniathon
and Manetho make reference.

##### THE SONS OF SETH-HERMES

The Egyptian account is straightforward enough; but when Josephus,
following the traditional practice of his race in exploiting the myths
of more ancient nations for the purpose of building up Jewish
history—for the

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mosaic Books
supply innumerable examples of the working-up of elements which the Jews
found in the records of older nations—runs away with the idea that Seth
(the Egyptian Sirius) was the Biblical patriarch Seth, the Jewish
“antiquarian” enters on a path of romance and not of history. ’Tis thus
he uses the Egyptian Seriadic tradition for his own purposes:

“All of these \[the Sons of Seth\] being of good disposition, dwelt
happily together in the same country free from quarrels, without any
misfortune happening to the end of their lives. The \[great\] subject of
their studies was that wisdom which deals with the heavenly bodies and
their orderly arrangement. In order that their discoveries should not be
lost to mankind and perish before they became known (for Adam had
foretold that there would be an alternate disappearance of all
things <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239.md) by the force of fire and
owing to the strength and mass of water)—they made two monuments, <span
id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_240.md) one of brick and the other of stone, and
on each of them engraved their discoveries. In order that if it should
happen that the brick one should be done away with by the heavy
downpour, <span id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_241.md) the stone one might
survive and let men know what was inscribed upon it, at the same time
informing them that a brick one had also been made by them. And it
remains even to the present day in the Siriad land.” <span
id="fr_242"></span>[4](#fn_242.md)

This passage is of great interest not only as affording a very good
example of the method of inventing Jewish “antiquities,” but also as
permitting us to recover the outlines of the original Egyptian account
which Josephus purloined and adapted. The Sons of Seth were the
initiates of the archaic priesthood of the First Hermes.

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Adam has been
substituted for the First Man, in the sense of our “Shepherd” tradition;
and the two kinds of monuments (which Josephus seems to regard as two
single structures and not as relating to two classes of buildings) may
refer to the brick structures and temples of that age, and to specially
constructed and more lasting monuments of stone—perhaps rock-cut
temples, or the most ancient pyramids. I have also asked myself the
question as to whether there may not be some clue concealed in this
“brick monument” reference to the puzzling statement in the Babylonian
Talmud <span id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_243.md) that Jesus set up a
“brick-bat” and worshipped it. Jesus is said in the Talmud Jeschu
Stories to have “learned magic in Egypt,” and the magical wisdom of
ancient Egypt is here said to have been recorded on monuments of
brick. <span id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_244.md)

Reitzenstein (p. 183), after pointing to the similarity of tradition as
to the Seriadic Land contained in Josephus, and in what he characterises
as Pseudo-Manetho, <span id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_245.md) adds the
interesting information that the Seriadic Land is borne witness to by an
inscription as being the home and native land of Isis; indeed, the
Goddess herself is given the name of *Neilotis* or *Seirias*; she is the
fertile earth and is Egypt. <span id="fr_246"></span>[4](#fn_246.md)

To continue, then, with the consideration of the arguments urged against
the authenticity of Manetho’s *Sothis*. With regard to objection (iv.),
we have given very good reasons for concluding that so far from Egypt
“knowing no Seriadic land,” Egypt was *the* Seriadic Land *par
excellence,* and the Books of Hermes

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

were the direct descendants of the archaic stone monuments of that land.
And further, we have shown that our Trismegistic writings are a step or
two further down in the same line of descent. The whole hangs together
logically and naturally.

We have thus removed four of the five props which support the hypothesis
of forgery with regard to the *Sothis* document. Let us now see whether
the remaining prop will bear the weight of the structure.

##### THE EPITHET “THRICE-GREATEST”

(v.) We are told that the term “Trismegistus” is of late use. This
assertion is based entirely on the hypothesis that all our extant
Trismegistic writings are Neoplatonic forgeries of the third or at best
the second century, before which time the name Thrice-greatest was never
heard of. The term Trismegistus must go as far back as the earliest of
these writings, at any rate, and where we must place that we shall see
at the end of our investigations.

That the peculiar designation Trismegistus was known in the first
century even among the Romans, however, is evident from the famous Latin
epigrammatist Martial (v. 24), who in singing the praise of one Hermes,
a famous gladiator, brings his pæan to a climax with the line:

> <span style="font-size: small">*Hermes omnia solus et ter unus*. <span
> id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_247.md)</span>

A verse which an anonymous translator in 1695 freely renders as:

> <span style="font-size: small">Hermes engrosses all men’s gifts in
> one,  
> And Trismegistus’ name deserves alone.</span>

Such a popular reference shows that the name Trismegistus was a
household word, and argues for

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

many years of use before the days of Martial (A.D. 43-104?). But have we
no other evidence?

In the trilingual inscription (hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek) on the
famous Rosetta Stone, which sings the praises of Ptolemy Epiphanes
(210-181 B.C.), Hermes is called the “Great-and-Great.” <span
id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) Letronne renders this *deux fois
grand*; <span id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) and in his notes <span
id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) says that the term “Trismegistus” was
not known at this date, thus contemptuously waving aside Manetho’s
*Sothis*. Had it been known, he says, it would undoubtedly have been
used instead of the feebler expression “great-and-great.” <span
id="fr_251"></span>[4](#fn_251.md) But why undoubtedly? Let us enquire a
little further into the matter. The Egyptian reduplicated form of this
attribute of Hermes, *ȧā ȧā,* the “great-great,” is frequently elsewhere
found with a prefixed sign which may be transliterated *ur*. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[5](#fn_252.md) So that if the more simple form is
translated by “great, great,” the intensive form would naturally be
rendered “great, great, great,” or “three times great.” But we have to
deal with the form “thrice-greatest,” a superlative intensive. We have
many examples of adjectives intensified with the particle τρίς in
Greek, <span id="fr_253"></span>[6](#fn_253.md)

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

but no early instances of their superlatives; therefore, what?
Apparently that the term “Trismegistus” is a late invention.

But may we not legitimately suppose, in the absence of further
information, that when the Egyptian had intensified his reduplicated
form he had come to an end of his resources—it was the highest term of
greatness that he could get out of his language? Not so when he used
Greek. He could go a step further in the more plastic Hellenic tongue.
Why, then, did he not use “thrice-greatest” instead of “great-and-great”
on the Rosetta Stone?

Because he was translating *ȧā ȧā* and not its intensified form. But why
did he not use the intensified form in the demotic inscription? Well,
“whys” are endless; but may we not suppose that, as Ptolemy was being
praised for his *justice,* which he is said to have exercised “as Hermes
the great-and-great,” the reduplicated form was sufficient for this
attribute of the idealised priesthood, while the still more honorific
title was reserved for Hermes as the personified Wisdom? Or, again, may
it not have been politic to refrain from adjectives which would have
dimmed the greatness of Ptolemy?

##### THE CLUE OF GRIFFITHS

So I wrote in November 1899, when the major part of this chapter was
first published in *The Theosophical Review*. Shortly afterwards,
however, I came across an entirely new clue. In his *Stories of the High
Priests of Memphis: the Sethon of Herodotus and the Demotic Tales of
Khamuas* (Oxford, 1900), F. Ll. Griffiths presents us with the
translation of an exceedingly interesting demotic text, found on the
*verso* of two Greek

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

documents, the contents of which prove them to be official
land-registers of the seventh year of Claudius (A.D. 46-47). There is
also “strong evidence for attributing the demotic text to some time
within thirty years from that date” (p. 41). So much for the copy of the
original; but what of its contents? As they belong to the most important
cycle of folk-tates of Egypt, it is to be assumed that their form and
substance is old.

In this papyrus we are told that on an occasion of great need when the
Pharaoh of Egypt was being overcome at a distance by the sorceries of
the Ethiopian enchanters, he was saved, and the magic of the Black Ones
sent back upon them, by a certain Hor, son of Pa-neshe, most learned in
the Books. Before his great trial of strength with the Ethiopian spells,
we read of this Hor that:

“He entered the temple of Khmûn; he made his offerings and his libations
before Thoth, the Eight-times-great, the Lord of Khmûn, the Great God”
(p. 58).

To this Griffiths appends the following note:

“‘Thoth, eight times great’; the remains of the signs indicate this
reading. The title, which here appears for the first time in Egyptian
literature, is the equivalent of τρισμέγιστος \[thrice-greatest\], a
late epithet first used about the date of this MS. <span
id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_254.md) ὁ is μέγας \[great\], which we may
represent algebraically by *a*; ὁ ὁ (2*a*), a common title of Thoth in
late hieroglyphic, is μέγας καὶ μέγας \[great and great\] on the Rosetta
Stone, but probably represents μέγιστος \[greatest\], and 8ὁ is
therefore τρισμέγιστος \[thrice-greatest\], *i.e.* (2*a*)³. The famous
epithet of Hermes which has puzzled commentators thus displays its
mathematical formation. 6ὁ = 3(2*a*) would not fill the

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

lacuna on the papyrus, nor would it give the obviously intended
reference to the name of Thoth’s city, ‘the Eighth,’ and the
mythological interpretation of that name.”

The mythological interpretation of that name, namely Khmun
(*Khemen-nw*), which Budge transliterates Khemennu, Griffiths says is
“the eighth city,” *i.e.* “the eighth in Upper Egypt going up the
river.” <span id="fr_255"></span>[1](#fn_255.md)

We are loth to deprive any one of a so fair adaptation to environment in
the evolution of purely physical interpretation; but we are afraid that
our readers will have already learned for themselves that Khemennu was
the City of the Eight, the City of the Ogdoad, and will expect some less
mundane explanation of the name; not that we altogether object to
Khemennu being the “Eighth City up the River,” if that river is
interpreted as the Celestial Nile on which the soul of the initiated
sailed in the solar boat.

Reitzenstein then is wrong in supposing (p. 117, n. 6) that Griffiths
connects the honorific title Trismegistus with the eight cynocephali who
form the *paut* of Thoth; but we may do so.

The nature of this symbolic Ogdoad is most clearly seen in the
inscription of Dêr-el-Bahari, of the time of the Twenty-second Dynasty
which Maspero has lately published. <span
id="fr_256"></span>[2](#fn_256.md)

In it the Osirified says to the Supreme:

“I am One who becomes Two; I am Two who becomes Four; I am Four who
becomes Eight; I am the One after that.”

So also in the first Hermes Prayer, quoted in a preceding chapter,
addressed to Hermes as Agathodaimon,

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thoth is he “whom
the Eight Wardens guard.”

These Eight, we may perhaps be permitted to speculate, were generated
Two from One, *ȧā ȧā,* Greatest; Four from Two, Twice-greatest; Eight
from Four, Thrice-greatest.

Such a combination would specially commend itself to men trained in
Pythagorean mathematical symbols, as were doubtless many who took part
in compiling the Egyptian Hellenistic theosophical literature.

I, therefore, conclude that the honorific title Thrice-greatest can very
well go back to early Ptolemaic times; and therefore, as far as I can
see, the authenticity of Manetho’s *Sothis* stands unimpugned as far as
any arguments so far brought against it are concerned. I therefore
regard the quotation of Syncellus as a most valuable piece of
information in tracing the genesis of the Trismegistic literature.
Whether or not any of our extant sermons can be placed among these
earlier forms of this literature will be discussed later on.

##### THE EARLIEST TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

That, however, literature of a similar nature existed in early and
middle Ptolemaic times we have already seen from the material adduced at
the beginning of this chapter; we may therefore fitly conclude it by
pointing out that in later Ptolemaic times, and down to the first
century A.D., we find in the same literature specimens of cosmogenesis
closely resembling the main elements of the world-formation given in our
“Shepherd” treatise.

An excellent example is that of the fragmentary cosmogonical poem, the
text of which Reitzenstein has printed in his *Zwei religionsgesch.
Fragen,* to which we

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

have already referred. This poem Reitzenstein (p. 92) dates as belonging
to the first century B.C., though it may probably be earlier; it
declares itself to be of the Hermes tradition, both in its statement
about itself and also in the fact that it is Hermes, the Beloved Son of
Zeus, who is the Logos-Creator of the cosmos, and also the progenitor or
“father” of the prophet-poet who writes the vision.

##### PHILO BYBLIUS

But not only did the tradition of Egyptian Hermes dominate the Greek
forms of cosmogony which emanated from Alexandria and spread through the
Hellenic world, but it also imposed itself upon the forms of cosmogony
and the history-writing of other nations; the most striking example of
this is to be found in the *Phœnician Histories* of Philo Byblius, who
lived in the second half of the first century A.D.

The fragments of this work are of great interest to our present enquiry,
as they tend to show that both Egypt and Phœnicia, the two most sacred
nations, derived their cosmogonical knowledge and mystery-traditions
from the same source; that source being traced to the most archaic Books
of Thoth.

This is all, no doubt, an overwriting of Phœnician records in the light
of Egyptian tradition; Philo, however, would have us regard his work as
a Greek translation or paraphrase of a compilation made by an ancient
and learned Phœnician priest, Sanchuniathon, based immediately upon
archaic Phœnician records by one who was also learned in the oral
tradition of his own mysteries.

The initial question as to whether Philo had a genuine Phœnician
document before him or not, need

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

not occupy us here, save in the most superficial fashion, as we are at
present interested in the Egyptian elements of his account solely, and
not in disentangling the native Phœnician substratum.

It must, however, in fairness be said that though the Byblian prefaces
his account with an introduction and intersperses it with occasional
remarks, all this is transparently his own, and is clearly
distinguishable from what have every appearance of being translated
passages.

##### ARE HIS “PHŒNICIAN HISTORIES” A FORGERY?

The general theory, however, since the time of Orelli <span
id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_257.md) has been that Philo forged the whole of
this cosmogony and history. On the contrary, it was made considerable
use of by Porphyry in his criticism of Christianity, and Eusebius <span
id="fr_258"></span>[2](#fn_258.md) quotes the passages used by
Porphyry. <span id="fr_259"></span>[3](#fn_259.md) The whole work of Philo,
moreover, is claimed to be recovered by Wagenfeld, who has elaborately
defended its genuineness. <span id="fr_260"></span>[4](#fn_260.md) There
indeed seems no reason to

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

accept the forgery-hypothesis, which apparently rests on an even
flimsier basis than the forgery-theory of the Trismegistic writings. The
work, on the contrary, considered as a specimen of Phœnician story
strongly influenced by Egyptian tradition, is a most interesting
document for understanding the ancient Semitic mystery-tradition as
distinguished from Jewish adaptations of general Semitic legend—in other
words, the distinction of *Semitismus* and *Israëlitismus*. Porphyry was
not only a Semite himself but also a good critic, and not likely to base
his arguments on a forgery; nor would Philo have ventured to put forward
a forgery when there were thousands of learned and fanatical Jews who
would have been only too glad to expose it.

Philo tells us that the Phœnician public traditions being chaotic,
“Sanchuniathon, a man of great learning and a busy searcher \[after
knowledge\], who especially desired to know the first principles from
which all things are derived, most carefully examined the Books of
Taaut, for he knew that Taaut was the first of all under the sun who
discovered the use of letters and the writing of records. So he started
from him, making him as it were his foundation—from him the Logos whom
the Egyptians called Thōuth, the Alexandrians Thōth, <span
id="fr_261"></span>[1](#fn_261.md) but whom the Greeks have turned into
Hermes.” <span id="fr_262"></span>[2](#fn_262.md)

##### SANCHUNIATHON AND THE BOOKS OF HERMES

This evidently means that the source of Sanchuniathon’s information as
to the mystic beginning of things was derived from the Books of Thoth,
and

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

that this was so may be seen from the following passage:

“He supposes the beginning of all things to consist of a Dark Mist of a
spiritual nature, or as it were a Breath of dark mist, and of a turbid
Chaos black as Erebus; <span id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_263.md) that these
were boundless, and for many an age <span
id="fr_264"></span>[2](#fn_264.md) remained without a bound. ‘But when,’
he <span id="fr_265"></span>[3](#fn_265.md) says, ‘the Spirit fell in love
with his own principles, <span id="fr_266"></span>[4](#fn_266.md) and they
were interblended, that interweaving was called Love; <span
id="fr_267"></span>[5](#fn_267.md) and this Love was the origin of the
creation of all things. But \[Chaos\] did not know its own
creation. <span id="fr_268"></span>[6](#fn_268.md) From its embrace with
Spirit Mōt was born. <span id="fr_269"></span>[7](#fn_269.md) From her
\[Mōt, the Great Mother\] it was that every seed of the creation came,
the birth of all the cosmic bodies.

“‘\[First of all\] there were \[Great\] Lives <span
id="fr_270"></span>[8](#fn_270.md) devoid of sensation, and out of these
came subsequently \[Great\]

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Lives possessed of
intelligence. <span id="fr_271"></span>[1](#fn_271.md) The latter were
called Zophasemin (that is to say, “Overseers of the Heavens”). The
latter were fashioned in the form of eggs, and shone forth as Mōt, the
Sun and Moon, the Stars and the great Planetary Spheres.

“‘Now as the \[original\] nebula began to lighten, through its heat
mists and clouds of sea and earth <span id="fr_272"></span>[2](#fn_272.md)
were produced, and gigantic downpours and torrents of the waters in the
firmaments. Even after they were separated, <span
id="fr_273"></span>[3](#fn_273.md) they were still carried from their
proper places by the heat of the sun, and all the \[watery and earthy
elements\] met together again in the nebula one with the other, and
dashed together, amid thunder and lightning; and over the crash of the
thunderings the \[Great\] Rational Lives before-mentioned watched, <span
id="fr_274"></span>[4](#fn_274.md) while on the land and sea male and
female cowered at their echo and were dismayed.’

“After this our author proceeds to say: ‘These things we found written
in the Cosmogony of Taaut, and in his commentaries, based on his
researches and the evidences which his intelligence saw and discovered,
and so enlightened us.’” <span id="fr_275"></span>[5](#fn_275.md)

There are many other points of interest in Philo’s translation, but we
need not elaborate them here. One point, however, must not be omitted,
because of its importance with regard to the Hermes-Æsculapius
tradition, an important factor in the Trismegistic writings.

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

“And Cronus \[Ammon\] going to the land of the South gave the whole of
Egypt to the God Taaut to be his kingdom. All these things were first
recorded by the Seven Sons of Sydyk, the Cabiri, and their eighth
brother, Asclepius, as it was commanded them by the God Taaut.” <span
id="fr_276"></span>[1](#fn_276.md)

Æsculapius is here at once identified with the cult of the “Great Gods”
(כבר, KBR, *Kabirim*), who were, according to the old Semitic tradition,
the Sons of King Sydyk (? Melchizedec). The whole subject of the very
ancient mysteries of these Great Gods is one of immense interest, but we
must not be tempted to follow this alluring bye-path. <span
id="fr_277"></span>[2](#fn_277.md) Enough has been said to show that both
Sanchuniathon and the writer of “The Shepherd” drew their accounts of
cosmogony from the same sources, namely, the “Books of Thoth,” or, in
other words, the Egyptian mystery-tradition.

<span id="fn_247"></span>[116:1](th108.htm#fr_247.md) Pietschmann misquotes
this line, giving “ter maximus” for “ter unus” (*op. cit.,* p. 36).

<span id="fn_248"></span>[117:1](th108.htm#fr_248.md) καθάπερ Ἑρμῆς ὁ μέγας

is called “μέγας, μέγας, μέγας” on the Rosetta Stone.

<span id="fn_253"></span>[117:6](th108.htm#fr_253.md) In Greek not only is
the term τρίσμακαρ (thrice-blessed) applied to Hermes in the
inscriptions of Pselcis (see Letronne’s *Recueil,* i. 206 n.), but also
in a Magical Prayer (Wessely, 1893—p. 38, 11. 550 ff.; Kenyon, p. 102)
he is addressed as τρισμέγας, or “thrice-great” simply.

of the out-breathing of the universe or of any system; it is the Great
Breath or Spirit moving on the Waters of Chaos, the primal nebula.
Erebus was fabled to be a region of nether darkness separating Earth and
Hades (not Hell). It was the Dark Side of Heaven.

Sanchuniathon; so that we may take this passage as a direct quotation,
or rather translation.

the primal states of Matter or Chaos.

<span id="fn_267"></span>[125:5](th108.htm#fr_267.md) Pothos, πόθος;
yearning, longing—love for all that lives and breathes. This union was
symbolised not only among the Phœnicians but also among most of the
other nations by an egg, round which a serpent twines. When the egg and
serpent are represented apart they stand for “Chaos” and “Ether,” matter
and spirit; but when united they represent the hermaphrodite or
male-female first principle of the universe, spirit-matter, called in
Greek translation Pothos or Erōs.

<span id="fn_269"></span>[125:7](th108.htm#fr_269.md) Here Philo, the
translator, volunteers the information that some call this prime plasm
of Chaos, “Slime,” others explain it as “Fermentation,” in a watery sort
of medium.

is made in the cosmogonic account in “The Shepherd,” but with more
detail.
