##### CONCERNING TYPHON

XXX\. 1. Osiris and Isis have, then, changed from good daimones into
gods. While as for the dimmed and shattered power of Typhon, though it
is at the last

<span id="page_305">p. 305</span>

gasp and in its final death-throes, they still appease and soothe it
with certain feasts of offerings.

2\. Yet, again, every now and then at certain festivals they humiliate
it dreadfully and treat it most despitefully,—even to rolling
red-skinned men in the mud, and driving an ass over a precipice (as the
Koptos folk), because Typhon was born with his skin red and ass-like.
While the Busiris folk and Lycopolitans do not use trumpets at all, as
they sound like an ass \[braying\].

3\. And generally they think that the ass is not clean, but a daimonic
animal, on account of its resemblance to that \[god\]; and making
round-cakes for feasts of offerings on both the month of Paÿni and that
of Phaōphi, <span id="fr_1045"></span>[1](#fn_1046) they stamp on them
an “ass tied.” <span id="fr_1046"></span>[2](#fn_1047)

4\. And on the Feast of Offerings of the Sun, they pass the word to the
worshippers not to wear on the body things made of gold nor to give food
to an ass. <span id="fr_1047"></span>[3](#fn_1048)

5\. The Pythagorics also seem to consider Typhon a daimonic power; for
they say that Typhon was produced on the six-and-fiftieth even measure;
and again that the \[power <span id="fr_1048"></span>[4](#fn_1049)\] of
the equilateral triangle is that of Hades and Dionysus and Ares; that of
the square is that of Rhea and Aphroditē and Demeter and Hestia (that
is, Hera); that of the dodecagon, that of Zeus; and that of the
fifty-six angled \[regular polygon\], that of Typhon—as Eudoxus
relates. <span id="fr_1049"></span>[5](#fn_1050)

<span id="page_306">p. 306</span>

XXXI\. 1. And, as Egyptians believe that Typhon was born
red-skinned, <span id="fr_1050"></span>[1](#fn_1051) they offer in
sacrifice even the red ones of the oxen \[only\] after making the
scrutiny so close, that if \[the beast\] has even a single hair black or
white, they consider it ought not to be offered; for if it were
sacrificed, it would not be an acceptable offering to the gods, but the
contrary, \[as are\] all those animals which have seized on the souls of
impure and unrighteous men in the course of their transformation into
bodies other \[than human\].

2\. Wherefore after uttering imprecations on the head of the
victim, <span id="fr_1051"></span>[2](#fn_1052) and cutting off its
head, they used to cast it into the river in olden days, but nowadays
they give it to strangers.

3\. But as to the one that is to be sacrificed, those of the priests who
are called Sealers, set a mark upon it—the seal (as Kastōr <span
id="fr_1052"></span>[3](#fn_1053) relates) having the impression of a
man forced down on one knee with his hands drawn round behind him, and a
sword sticking in his throat. <span id="fr_1053"></span>[4](#fn_1054)

4\. And they think that the ass also has the distinction of its
resemblance \[to Typhon\], as has been said, owing to its aversion to
being taught and to its wantonness, no less than on account of its
skin. <span id="fr_1054"></span>[5](#fn_1055)

5\. For which cause also since they especially detested

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ōchus <span
id="fr_1055"></span>[1](#fn_1056) of \[all\] the Persian kings as being
blood-polluted and abominable, they gave him the nickname of “Ass.”

But he, with the retort: “This Ass, however, will make a fine feast off
your Ox”—slaughtered the Apis, as Deinōn has told us. <span
id="fr_1056"></span>[2](#fn_1057)

6\. Those, however, who say that Typhon’s flight from the fight on an
ass lasted seven days, and that after reaching a place of safety he
begat sons—Hierosolymus and Judæus—are instantly convicted of dragging
Judaïc matters into the myth. <span id="fr_1057"></span>[3](#fn_1058)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1046"></span>[305:1](th130.htm#fr_1045) Copt. Paōni and
Paopi—corr. roughly with June and October.

<span id="fn_1047"></span>[305:2](th130.htm#fr_1046) ὄνον δεδεμένον.
*Cf.* Matt. xxi. 2: ὄνον δεδεμένην; *cf.* also 1. 3, where it is a
hippopotamus.

<span id="fn_1048"></span>[305:3](th130.htm#fr_1047) That is,
presumably, not to weigh down their minds with the superfluity of
riches, nor to feed up the stupid and lustful energies of their souls.

<span id="fn_1049"></span>[305:4](th130.htm#fr_1048) A “power” in
Pythagorean technology is the side of a square (or, perhaps, of any
equilateral polygon) in geometry; and in arithmetic the square root, or
that which being multiplied into itself produces the square.

<span id="fn_1050"></span>[305:5](th130.htm#fr_1049) Eudoxus seems to
have been Plutarch’s authority for his statements regarding Pythagorean
doctrine; *cf.* vi., lii., lxii. The Typhonic figure might be generated
by “sevening” the interior angles of a regular octagon and producing the
radii to the circumference of the circumscribed circle, or by “eighting”
the interior angles of a regular heptagon.

<span id="fn_1051"></span>[306:1](th130.htm#fr_1050) Or “fire-coloured.”

<span id="fn_1052"></span>[306:2](th130.htm#fr_1051) Compare the Ritual
of Azāzel (the scape-goat), one of the two goats set apart on the Great
Day of Atonement among the Jews (Lev. xvi. 8 ff.).

<span id="fn_1053"></span>[306:3](th130.htm#fr_1052) *Cf.* also Plut.,
*Ætia Romana,* x. Castor was a Greek historian who was a contemporary of
Cicero and Julius Cæsar.

<span id="fn_1054"></span>[306:4](th130.htm#fr_1053) The ox was,
therefore, the vicarious atonement of the man.

<span id="fn_1055"></span>[306:5](th130.htm#fr_1054) It was a red ass,
then, which symbolised the Typhonic power.

<span id="fn_1056"></span>[307:1](th130.htm#fr_1055) *Cf.* xi. 4.

<span id="fn_1057"></span>[307:2](th130.htm#fr_1056) Müller, ii. 95.
Deinōn was a contemporary of Alexander the Great, and wrote a history of
Persia.

<span id="fn_1058"></span>[307:3](th130.htm#fr_1057) This item of
ancient scandal would almost seem to have come from the pen of an Apion;
it is an interesting specimen of theological controversy in story-form.
