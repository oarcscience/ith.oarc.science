##### THE SYMBOLISM OF THE SISTRUM

LXIII\. 1. The sistrum (σεῖστρον) also shows that existent things must
be shaken up (σείεσθαι) and never have cessation from impulse, but as it
were be wakened up and agitated when they fall asleep and die away.

2\. For they say they turn aside and beat off Typhon with
sistra,—signifying that when corruption binds nature fast and brings her
to a stand, \[then\] generation frees her and raises her from death by
means of motion.

3\. Now the sistrum has a curved top, and its arch contains the four
\[things\] that are shaken. For the part of the cosmos which is subject
to generation and corruption, is circumscribed by the sphere of the
moon, and all \[things\] in it are moved and changed by the four
elements—fire and earth and water and air.

4\. And on the arch of the sistrum, at the top, they put the metal
figure of a cat with a human face, and at the bottom, below the shaken
things, the face sometimes of Isis and sometimes of
Nephthys,—symbolising by the faces generation and consummation (for
these are the changes and motions of the elements), and by the cat the
moon, on account of the variable nature, <span
id="fr_1197"></span>[2](#fn_1198.md) night habits, and fecundity of the
beast.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

5\. For it is fabled to bring forth one, then two, and \[then\] three,
and four, and five \[at a birth\], and then adds one by one until
seven; <span id="fr_1198"></span>[1](#fn_1199.md) so that in all she brings
forth eight-and-twenty, the number of lights of the moon.

6\. This, however, is probably somewhat too mythical; anyway, the pupils
of its eyes seem to become full and dilate at the full-moon, and to
contract and shut out the light during the wanings of that luminary.

7\. And by the human face of the cat is signified the intellectual and
reasonable nature of the changes that take place in connection with the
moon.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_1198"></span>[344:2](th137.htm#fr_1197.md) τὸ ποικίλον. King
translates this “pied colour,” and deduces that “the original colour of
the cat was tabby”; but, as the school-boy says, I don’t see it.

<span id="fn_1199"></span>[345:1](th137.htm#fr_1198.md) More “Physiologus”;
or rather, there was a mystical theory about other things which was
adapted to a popular natural history of the cat, and then the fable was
cited as “proof” of the original theory.
