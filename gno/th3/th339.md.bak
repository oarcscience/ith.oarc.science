### CYRIL OF ALEXANDRIA <span id="fr_597"></span>[1](#fn_597.md)

<span class="small">i. *Contra Julianum*, i. 30; Migne, col. 548
A. <span id="fr_598"></span>[2](#fn_598.md)</span>

##### CYRIL’S CORPUS OF XV. BOOKS

(<span class="smallcaps">Cyril</span>, after claiming that Pythagoras
and Plato obtained their wisdom in Egypt from what, he professes, they
had heard of Moses there, proceeds:)

And I think the Egyptian Hermes also should be considered worthy of
mention and recollection—he who, they say, bears the title of
Thrice-greatest because of the honour paid him by his contemporaries,
and, as some think, in comparison with Hermes the fabled son of Zeus and
Maia.

This Hermes of Egypt, then, although an initiator into mysteries, <span
id="fr_599"></span>[3](#fn_599.md) and though he never ceased to cleave to
the shrines of idols, is \[nevertheless\] found to have grasped the
doctrines of Moses, if not with entire correctness, and beyond all
cavil, yet still in part.

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

For both \[Hermes\] himself has been benefitted \[by Moses\], and
reminder of this \[fact\] has also been made in his own writings by
\[the editor\] at Athens who put together the fifteen books entitled
“Hermaïca.” \[This editor\] writes concerning him \[Hermes\] in the
first book, putting the words into the mouth of one of the priests of
the sacred rites:

“In order then that we may come to things of a like nature (?),—have you
not heard that our Hermes divided the whole of Egypt into allotments and
portions, measuring off the acres with the chain, <span
id="fr_600"></span>[1](#fn_600.md) and cut canals for irrigation purposes,
and made nomes, <span id="fr_601"></span>[2](#fn_601.md) and named the
lands \[comprised in them\] after them, and established the interchange
of contracts, and drew up a list of the risings of the stars, and \[the
proper times <span id="fr_602"></span>[3](#fn_602.md)\] to cut plants; and
beyond all this he discovered and bequeathed to posterity numbers, and
calculations, and geometry, and astronomy, and astrology, and music, and
the whole of grammar?”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Corpus of XV. Books is evidently the source of Cyril’s information,
and he takes the above quotation from the Introduction, which purported
to be written by an Egyptian priest (as is also the case in the treatise
*De Mysteriis*, traditionally ascribed to Jamblichus), but which Cyril
says was written at Athens, by presumably some Greek editor. <span
id="fr_603"></span>[4](#fn_603.md)

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

<span class="small">ii. *Ibid.*, i. 31; Migne col. 549 B.</span>

##### THE INCORPOREAL EYE

Thrice-greatest Hermes says somewhat as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Cyril then quotes, with four slight verbal variants, the first four
paragraphs of the passage excerpted by Stobæus, Ex. ii., and then
proceeds without a break:)

#### FRAGMENT XI.

> If, then, there be an incorporeal eye, <span
> id="fr_604"></span>[1](#fn_604.md) let it go forth from body unto the
> Vision of the Beautiful; let it fly up and soar aloft, seeking to see
> not form, nor body, nor \[even\] types <span
> id="fr_605"></span>[2](#fn_605.md) \[of things\], but rather That which
> is the Maker of \[all\] these,—the Quiet and Serene, the Stable and
> the Changeless One, the Self, the All, the One, the Self of self, the
> Self in self, the Like to Self \[alone\], That which is neither like
> to other, nor \[yet\] unlike to self, and \[yet\] again Himself. <span
> id="fr_606"></span>[3](#fn_606.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Though Cyril runs this passage on to the four paragraphs which in the
Stobæan Extract are continued by three other paragraphs, I am quite
persuaded that the Archbishop of Alexandria took the above from the same
“Sermon to Tat” <span id="fr_607"></span>[4](#fn_607.md) as the
Anthologist. <span id="fr_608"></span>[5](#fn_608.md)

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

<span class="small">iii. *Ibid.*, i. 33; Migne, col. 552 D.</span>

##### THE HEAVENLY WORD PROCEEDING FORTH

And Thrice-greatest Hermes thus delivers himself concerning God:

#### FRAGMENT XII.

> For that His Word (*Logos*) proceeding forth, <span
> id="fr_609"></span>[1](#fn_609.md)—all-perfect as he was, and fecund, and
> creative in fecund Nature, falling on fecund <span
> id="fr_610"></span>[2](#fn_610.md) Water, made Water pregnant. <span
> id="fr_611"></span>[3](#fn_611.md)

##### THE PYRAMID

And the same again \[declares\]:

#### FRAGMENT XIII.

> The Pyramid, then, is below \[both\] Nature and the Intellectual
> World. <span id="fr_612"></span>[4](#fn_612.md) For that it <span
> id="fr_613"></span>[5](#fn_613.md) hath above it ruling it the
> Creator-Word <span id="fr_614"></span>[6](#fn_614.md) of the Lord of
> all,—who, being the First Power after

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

> <span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Him, \[both\]
> increate \[and\] infinite, leaned forth <span
> id="fr_615"></span>[1](#fn_615.md) from Him, and has his seat above, and
> rule o’er all that have been made through him. He is the First-born of
> the All-perfection, His perfect, fecund and true Son. <span
> id="fr_616"></span>[2](#fn_616.md)

##### THE NATURE OF GOD’S INTELLECTUAL WORD

And again the same \[Hermes\], when one of the Temple-folk <span
id="fr_617"></span>[3](#fn_617.md) in Egypt questions him and says:

#### FRAGMENT XIV.

> But why, O most mighty Good Daimon, was he <span
> id="fr_618"></span>[4](#fn_618.md) called by this name <span
> id="fr_619"></span>[5](#fn_619.md) by the Lord of all?—replies:

> Yea, have I told thee in what has gone before, but thou hast not
> perceived it.

> The nature of His Intellectual Word (*Logos*) is a productive and
> creative Nature. This is as though it were His
> Power-of-giving-birth, <span id="fr_620"></span>[6](#fn_620.md) or
> \[His\] Nature, or \[His\] Mode of being, or call it

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

> what you will,—only remembering this: that He is Perfect in the
> Perfect, and from the Perfect makes, and creates, and makes to live,
> perfect good things.

> Since, then, He hath this nature, rightly is He thus named. <span
> id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_621.md)

##### THE WORD OF THE CREATOR

And the same \[Hermes\], in the First Sermon of the “Expository
\[Sermons\] to Tat,” <span id="fr_622"></span>[2](#fn_622.md) speaks thus
about God:

#### FRAGMENT XV.

> The Word (*Logos*) of the Creator, O \[my\] son, transcends all sight;
> He \[is\] self-moved; He cannot be increased, nor \[yet\] diminished;
> Alone is He, and like unto Himself \[Alone\], equal, identical,
> perfect in His stability, perfect in order; for that He is the One,
> after the God alone beyond all knowing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first two Fragments (xi. and xii.) seem to be taken from the same
sermon, the contents of which resembled the first part of the “Shepherd
of Men” treatise; it has all the appearance of a discourse addressed to
Tat, and probably came in “The Expository Sermons.”

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

The third Fragment (xiii.) belongs to the more frankly Egyptian type,
the Agathodaimon literature, in which Hermes, as the Good Spirit,
figures as the teacher of the Mystery-god Osiris. <span
id="fr_623"></span>[1](#fn_623.md)

The last Fragment (xv.) is so similar in its phrasing to Fragment xi.,
already given by Cyril (i. 31), that I am strongly inclined to think the
Archbishop took both from the same source. If so, we can reconstruct
part of “The First Sermon of the Expository \[Sermons\] to Tat,” the
beginning of which (see Lact., *Ep*., 4) is also given by Stobæus, Ex.
ii., with the heading from “The \[Book\] to Tat,” while he heads other
extracts “From the \[pl.\] to Tat.” <span
id="fr_624"></span>[2](#fn_624.md)

<span class="small">v. *Ibid.*, ii. 35; Migne, col. 556 A.</span>

##### MIND OF MIND

And Hermes also says in the Third Sermon of those to Asclepius:

#### FRAGMENT XVI.

> It is not possible such mysteries \[as these\] should be declared to
> those who are without initiation in the sacred rites. But ye, lend
> \[me\] your ears, \[ears\] of your mind!

> There was One Intellectual Light alone,—nay, Light transcending
> Intellectual Light. He is for ever Mind of mind <span
> id="fr_625"></span>[3](#fn_625.md) who makes \[that\] Light to shine.

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

> There was no other; \[naught\] save the Oneness of Himself \[alone\].
> For ever in Himself \[alone\], for ever doth He compass all in His own
> Mind,—His Light and Spirit. <span id="fr_626"></span>[1](#fn_626.md)

##### HE IS ALL

And after some other things he says:

#### FRAGMENT XVII.

> Without Him <span id="fr_627"></span>[2](#fn_627.md) \[is\] neither god,
> nor angel, nor daimon, nor any other being. For He is Lord of all,
> \[their\] Father, and \[their\] God, and Source, and Life, and Power,
> and Light, and Mind, and Spirit. For all things are in Him and for His
> sake. <span id="fr_628"></span>[3](#fn_628.md)

##### CONCERNING SPIRIT

And again, in the same Third Sermon of those to Asclepius, in reply to
one who questions \[him\] concerning the Divine Spirit, the same
\[Hermes\] says as follows:

#### FRAGMENT XVIII.

> Had there not been some Purpose <span id="fr_629"></span>[4](#fn_629.md)
> of the Lord of all, so that I should disclose this word

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

> <span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*logos*), ye
> would not have been filled with so great love <span
> id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_630.md) to question me about it. Now give ye
> ear unto the rest of the discourse (*logos*).

> Of this same Spirit, of which I have already spoken many times, all
> things have need; for that it raises up all things, each in its own
> degree, and makes them live, and gives them nourishment, and
> \[finally\] removes them from its holy source, <span
> id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_631.md) aiding the spirit, <span
> id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_632.md) and for ever giving life to all, the
> \[one\] productive One.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### THE “TO ASCLEPIUS” OF CYRIL’S CORPUS

From the above statements of Cyril we learn that in addition to “The
Expository Sermons to Tat,” he had also before him a collection of
“Sermons to Asclepius”; of these there were at least three. Was “The
Perfect Sermon” one of this collection? It may have been; for the style
of it is cast in the same mould as that of these Fragments in Cyril.

Hermes, in the Third Sermon of Cyril’s collection, is addressing several
hearers, for he uses the plural; so also in *P. S. A.*, i. 2. Hermes
addresses Asclepius, Tat, and Ammon.

In the Third Sermon, Hermes also says: “It is not possible such
mysteries should be declared to those

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

who are without initiation in the sacred rites”; in *P. S. A.*, i. 2,
Hermes declares: “It is a mark of an impious mind to publish to the
knowledge of the crowd <span id="fr_633"></span>[1](#fn_633.md) a
tractate <span id="fr_634"></span>[2](#fn_634.md) brimming o’er with the
full grandeur of divinity.” The *numinis majestas* (grandeur of
divinity) is precisely the same idea as the Spirit, the “Divine
supremacy and power,” as Cyril says referring to Hermes.

Finally, in the Third Sermon, Hermes makes the striking remark that the
Love (ἔρως) of the Gnosis which urges on the disciples, is inspired by
the Providence or Foresight of God—that is, by His Spirit; *P. S. A.*,
i. 28, ends with the words: “To them, sunk in fit silence reverently,
their souls and minds pendent on Hermes’ lips, thus Love (ἔρως)
Divine <span id="fr_635"></span>[3](#fn_635.md) began to speak.”

The setting of the mode of exposition is then identical in the two
Sermons, and we may thus very well refer them to the same collection.

<span class="small">v. *Ibid.*, ii. 52; Migne, col. 580 B.</span>

##### FROM “THE MIND”

To this I will add what Thrice-greatest Hermes wrote “To his own
Mind,”—for thus the Book is called.

(Cyril then quotes, with very slight verbal variants, the last question
and answer in *C. H*., xi. (xii.) 22.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In our Corpus the treatise is not written by Hermes to the Mind, but, on
the contrary, it is cast in the mould of a revelation of “The Mind to
Hermes,” and is so

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

entitled. Cyril thus seems to have been mistaken. <span
id="fr_636"></span>[1](#fn_636.md) It may, then, have been that in the copy
which lay before the Church Father, the title read simply: “The Mind.”

<span class="small">vi. *Ibid.*, ii. 55; Migne, col. 586 D. <span
id="fr_637"></span>[2](#fn_637.md)</span>

##### OSIRIS AND THRICE-GREATEST AGATHODAIMON

But I will call to mind the words of Hermes the Thrice-greatest; in “The
Asclepius” <span id="fr_638"></span>[3](#fn_638.md) he says:

#### FRAGMENT XIX.

> Osiris said: How, then, O thou Thrice-greatest, \[thou\] Good
> Spirit, <span id="fr_639"></span>[4](#fn_639.md) did Earth in its
> entirety appear?

> The Great Good Spirit made reply:

> By gradual drying up, as I have said; and when the many Waters got
> commandment . . . <span id="fr_640"></span>[5](#fn_640.md) to go into
> themselves again, the Earth in its entirety appeared, muddy and
> shaking.

> Then, when the Sun shone forth, and without ceasing burned and dried
> it up, the Earth stood compact in the Waters, with Water all
> around. <span id="fr_641"></span>[6](#fn_641.md)

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

##### “LET THERE BE EARTH”

Further, in yet another place \[he writes\]:

#### FRAGMENT XX.

> The Maker and the Lord of all thus spake: Let there be Earth, and let
> the Firmament appear <span id="fr_642"></span>[1](#fn_642.md)!

> And forthwith the beginning of the \[whole\] creation, Earth, was
> brought into existence. <span id="fr_643"></span>[2](#fn_643.md)

##### THE GENERATION OF THE SUN

So much about the Earth; as to the Sun, he again says as follows:

#### FRAGMENT XXI.

> Then said Osiris: O thou Thrice-greatest, \[thou\] Good Spirit, whence
> came this mighty one?

> Would’st thou, Osiris, that we tell to thee the generation of the Sun,
> whence he appeared?

> He came from out the Foresight of the Lord of all; yea, the Sun’s
> birth proceedeth from

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

> the Lord of all, through His Creative Holy Word. <span
> id="fr_644"></span>[1](#fn_644.md)

##### “LET THE SUN BE!”

In like manner also in the “First Expository Sermon to Tat,” he says:

#### FRAGMENT XXII.

> Straightway the Lord of all spake unto His own Holy and
> Intelligible—to His Creative Word (*Logos*): Let the Sun be!

> And straightway with His word (*logos*), the Fire that hath its nature
> tending upward, <span id="fr_645"></span>[2](#fn_645.md)—I mean pure
> \[Fire\], that which gives greatest light, has the most energy, and
> fecundates the most,—Nature embraced <span
> id="fr_646"></span>[3](#fn_646.md) with her own Spirit, and raised it up
> aloft out of the Water. <span id="fr_647"></span>[4](#fn_647.md)

(After referring to Genesis i. 6: “And God said, Let there be a
firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from
the waters,”—Cyril proceeds:)

<span class="small">vii. *Ibid.*, ii. 57; Migne, col. 588 C.</span>

##### THE FIRMAMENT

Moreover the Hermes who is with them <span
id="fr_648"></span>[5](#fn_648.md) Thrice-

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

greatest mentions this \[that is, the firmament\] again. For he
describes God as saying to His creations:

#### FRAGMENT XXIII.

> I will encompass you with this Necessity, you who are disobedient to
> me, <span id="fr_649"></span>[1](#fn_649.md) which hath been laid on you
> as a Command through My own Word (*Logos*); for him ye have as Law.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This quotation also is probably taken from the same source as the
previous passage—that is, from the “First Expository Sermon to Tat.” The
idea and setting, however, should also be compared with the parallel in
the *K. K*. Excerpt (Stob., *Phys*., xli. 44; Gaisf., p. 408): “O Souls,
Love and Necessity shall be your lords, they who are lords and marshals
after me of all,”—where the “after me” (μετ᾽ ἐμέ) might perhaps confirm
the “up to me” in the preceding note as the more correct rendering.

<span class="small">viii. *Ibid.*, ii. 64; Migne, col. 598 D.</span>

##### FROM THE “TO ASCLEPIUS”

For Hermes, who is called Thrice-greatest, writes thus to Asclepius
about the nature of the universe:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Here follows with a few slight verbal variants the text of *C. H.*,
xiv. (xv.) 6, 7, beginning: “If, then, all things have been admitted to
be two.”)

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

And some lines after he proceeds in warmer language, setting forth a
striking argument, and says:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Then follows §§ 8, 9 of the same sermon, except the third sentence, and
§ 10 omitting the last sentence.) <span id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_650.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The same treatise must have lain before Cyril as that contained in our
Corpus in the form of a letter with the heading, “Unto Asclepius good
health of soul!”—for the Archbishop says that Hermes “writes thus to
Asclepius.” <span id="fr_651"></span>[2](#fn_651.md)

<span class="small">ix. *Ibid.*, iv. 130; Migne, col. 702.</span>

##### THE SOLE PROTECTION

(After quoting Porphyry as warning against participation in blood-rites
for fear of contamination from evil daimons, Cyril proceeds:)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And their Thrice-greatest Hermes seems also to be of the same opinion;
for he, too, writes as follows, in the \[sermon\] “To Asclepius,”
concerning those unholy daimons against whom we ought to protect
ourselves, and flee from them with all the speed we can:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

“The sole protection—and this we must have—is piety. For neither evil
daimon, yea nor Fate, can ever overcome or dominate a man who pious is,
and pure, and holy. For God doth save the truly pious man from every
ill.” <span id="fr_652"></span>[3](#fn_652.md)

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

<span class="small">x. *Ibid.*, viii. 274; Migne, col. 920 D.</span>

##### THE SUPREME ARTIST

Moreover, their Thrice-greatest Hermes has said somewhere about God, the
Supreme Artist <span id="fr_653"></span>[1](#fn_653.md) of all things:

#### FRAGMENT XXIV.

> Moreover, as perfectly wise He established Order and its
> opposite <span id="fr_654"></span>[2](#fn_654.md); in order that things
> intellectual, as being older and better, might have the government of
> things and the chief place, and that things sensible, as being second,
> might be subject to these.

> Accordingly that which tends downward, and is heavier than the
> intellectual, has in itself the wise Creative Word (*Logos*). <span
> id="fr_655"></span>[3](#fn_655.md)

<span class="small">xi. *Ibid*. (?).</span>

##### AN UNREFERENCED QUOTATION

(Chambers (p. 154) gives the following, “*Cyrill. Contra Julian., citing
Hermes*” but without any reference, and I can find it nowhere in the
text:)

#### FRAGMENT XXV.

> If thou understandest that One and Sole God, thou wilt find nothing
> impossible; for It is all virtue.

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

> Think not that It may be in some one; say not that it is out of some
> one.

> It is without termination; it is the termination of all.

> Nothing contains It; for It contains all in Itself.

> What difference is there then between the body and the Incorporeal,
> the created and the Uncreated; that which is subject to necessity, and
> what is Free; between the things terrestrial and things Celestial, the
> things corruptible and things Eternal?

> Is it not that the One exists freely and that the others are subject
> to necessity?

“self” and “same” which is unreproducible in English.

<span id="fn_607"></span>[253:4](th339.htm#fr_607.md) That is, presumably,

introducing this symbolism.

<span id="fn_610"></span>[254:2](th339.htm#fr_610.md) The adjective γόνιμος

R. 243, n. 3. Reitzenstein thinks that the image which the writer had in
his mind was the pyramid, or obelisk, with the sun-disk on the top.

<span id="fn_617"></span>[255:3](th339.htm#fr_617.md) τεμενιτῶν. The
questioner was undoubtedly Osiris (see Frag. xix. below). Cyril then
knows that “Osiris” was understood to stand for a grade of Egyptian
priests. *Cf.* R. 131.

<span id="fn_618"></span>[255:4](th339.htm#fr_618.md) Presumably the Logos.

<span id="fn_619"></span>[255:5](th339.htm#fr_619.md) Presumably “Soul”
(Psyche).

<span id="fn_620"></span>[255:6](th339.htm#fr_620.md) γένεσις.

<span id="fn_621"></span>[256:1](th339.htm#fr_621.md) This passage seems to
refer to the identity of Soul and Logos. For revised text see R. 131,
and the reference there to Plato, *Cratylus*, 400 B, where ψυχή, soul,
is explained by the word-play φυσέχη, that is, that which has physis, or
nature, or the power of production.

<span id="fn_622"></span>[256:2](th339.htm#fr_622.md) τῶν πρὸς τὸν Τὰτ
διεξοδικῶν.

<span id="fn_623"></span>[257:1](th339.htm#fr_623.md) See Frag. xix. below,
where Cyril (ii. 56) says that this type was found in the “Sermon to
Asclepius,” that is, was put with the Asclepius-books in the collection
which lay before him.

<span id="fn_624"></span>[257:2](th339.htm#fr_624.md) See also Fragg. xi.,
xii., xiii., xx., xxii., xxiii., xxiv. (?).

<span id="fn_625"></span>[257:3](th339.htm#fr_625.md) *Cf.* *K. K*., 16.

<span id="fn_626"></span>[258:1](th339.htm#fr_626.md) That is, Light and
Life. See *C. H.*, i. 9: “God, the Mind, . . . being Life and Light.”

<span id="fn_627"></span>[258:2](th339.htm#fr_627.md) Lit. outside of Him.

<span id="fn_628"></span>[258:3](th339.htm#fr_628.md) For a fuller
statement of the idea in this paragraph, see *C. H.*, ii. (iii.) 14.
Cyril thinks that the above two Fragments refer to the Father, Son (Mind
of mind and Light of light) and Holy Ghost (the Divine supremacy and
power), and is thus the source of the statement in Suidas (*s.v.*
“Hermes”) that Trismegistus spoke concerning the Trinity.

<span id="fn_629"></span>[258:4](th339.htm#fr_629.md) Or Providence,
πρόνοια. R. (203, n. 2) refers this to a belief that only when some
internal prompting gave permission to the master to expand the teaching,
could he do so. *Cf.* Appul., *Metam*., xi. 21, 22; *P. S. A*., i.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[259:1](th339.htm#fr_630.md) ἔρως τοιοῦτος.

<span id="fn_631"></span>[259:2](th339.htm#fr_631.md) That is, presumably,
causing their seeming death.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[259:3](th339.htm#fr_632.md) That is, the
individual life-breath, unless the reading ἐπίκουρον πνεύματι is
corrupt. The Latin translator in Migne goes hopelessly wrong, as,
indeed, is frequently the case. *Cf.* *C. H.*, x. (xi.) 13, Comment; *P.
S. A.*, vi. 4; Exx. iv. 2, xv. 2, xix. 3.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[260:1](th339.htm#fr_633.md) That is, the
uninitiated, the *profanum vulgus*.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[260:2](th339.htm#fr_634.md) *Tractatus*;
presumably *logos* in the original Greek.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[260:3](th339.htm#fr_635.md) *Cf.* also *P. S.
A.*, xx. 2 and xxi. 1, 3.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[261:1](th339.htm#fr_636.md) *Cf.* R. 128, n. 1.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[261:2](th339.htm#fr_637.md) Texts of quotations
reproduced in R. 127, n. 1.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[261:3](th339.htm#fr_638.md) From the quotations
we can see that this could not have been the special heading of the
treatise from which Cyril quotes, and which plainly belongs to the
Agathodaimon type. Cyril probably means that the treatise, in *his*
collection, came under the general title, “The Asclepius.”

<span id="fn_639"></span>[261:4](th339.htm#fr_639.md) Ἀγαθὸς δαίμων.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[261:5](th339.htm#fr_640.md) The reading is an
untranslatable ἀπὸ τοῦ, where the *lacuna* is probably to be completed
with “from the Lord of all.”

<span id="fn_641"></span>[261:6](th339.htm#fr_641.md) A distinction is
evidently drawn between the (heavenly) Water and water (the companion
element of earth). The text is immediately continued in Frag. xxi.
below.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[262:1](th339.htm#fr_642.md) See *C. H.*, i. 18,
Commentary.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[262:2](th339.htm#fr_643.md) This seems to be
taken not from a different place in the “To Asclepius,” but from another
sermon, or group of sermons, most probably from the “First Expository
Sermon to Tat”—as may be seen by comparing its phrasing with Frag. xxii.
See also Fragg. xi., xii, xiii., xv., xxii., xxiii., xxiv. (?).

<span id="fn_644"></span>[263:1](th339.htm#fr_644.md) This is evidently an
immediate continuation of Frag. xix. above. *Cf.* R. 126, n. 1, where
the texts are reproduced.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[263:2](th339.htm#fr_645.md) See Frag. xiii.
below, concerning the pyramid.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[263:3](th339.htm#fr_646.md) Embraced the Fire.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[263:4](th339.htm#fr_647.md) *Sc.* the
Water-Earth, one element, not yet separated, according to *C. H.*, i. 5.
For other probable quotations from this “First Expository Sermon to
Tat,” see Fragg. xi., xii., xiii., xv., xx., xxiii., xxiv. (?).

<span id="fn_648"></span>[263:5](th339.htm#fr_648.md) *Sc.* the
philosophers.

<span id="fn_649"></span>[264:1](th339.htm#fr_649.md) τοῖς ἐπ᾽ ἐμε,—lit.
“against me,” or it may perhaps be “up to me.” Migne’s Latin translator
gives “*qui in mea potestatis estis,*” and Chambers (p. 153), “those
from me”; neither of which can be correct.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[265:1](th339.htm#fr_650.md) Cyril also twice
omits the words “ignorance and jealousy” after “arrogance and impotence”
in 8, and also the words “and yet the other things” in 9.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[265:2](th339.htm#fr_651.md) *Cf.* Frag. iv.,
Comment.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[265:3](th339.htm#fr_652.md) *Cf.* *P. S. A.*,
xxix. 1. A comparison of this with Frag. iv., quoted by Lactantius (ii.
15), and the Commentary thereon, shows clearly that Cyril has
strengthened the original text by interpolations. Cyril’s quotation (v.
176) from Julian, in which the Emperor refers to Hermes, is given under
“Julian.”

<span id="fn_653"></span>[266:1](th339.htm#fr_653.md) ἀριστοτεχνοῦ,—an
epithet applied by Pindar (Fr. 29) to Zeus.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[266:2](th339.htm#fr_654.md) ἀταξίαν.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[266:3](th339.htm#fr_655.md) This seems somewhat
of a piece with the contents of the “First Expository Sermon to Tat.”
See Fragg. xi., xii., xiii., xv , xx., xxii., xxiii.
