### JUSTIN MARTYR

<span class="small">i. *Cohortatio ad Gentiles*, xxxviii.; Otto (J. C.
T.), ii. 122 (2d ed., Jena, 1849). <span

##### THE MOST ANCIENT OF PHILOSOPHERS

<span class="smallcaps">Now</span> if any of you should think that he
has learnt the doctrine concerning God from those of the philosophers
who are mentioned among you as most ancient, let him give ear to Ammon
and Hermes. For Ammon in the Words (*Logoi*) concerning himself <span
id="fr_498"></span>[2](#fn_498.md) calls God “utterly hidden”; while Hermes
clearly and plainly declares:

> To understand God is difficult; to speak \[of Him\] impossible, even
> for one who can understand. <span id="fr_499"></span>[3](#fn_499.md)

##### THE “WORDS OF AMMON”

This passage occurs at the very end of the treatise. Justin will have it
that the most ancient of all the philosophers are on his side.

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

These are Ammon and Hermes. Justin, moreover, knows of certain Words
(Logoi), or Sermons, or Sacred Utterances of Ammon, which must have been
circulating in Greek, otherwise it is difficult to see how Justin was
acquainted with them. They were evidently of an apocalyptic nature, in
the form of a self-revelation of Ammon or God.

These “Words of Ammon” have clearly nothing to do with the Ammonian type
of the surviving Trismegistic literature, where Ammon is a hearer and
not an instructor, least of all the supreme instructor or Agathodaimon.
In them we may see an intermediate stage of direct dependence of
Hellenistic theological literature on Egyptian originals, for we have
preserved to us certain Hymns from the El-Khargeh Oasis which bear the
inscription “‘The Secret Words of Ammon’ which were found on Tables of
Mulberry-wood.” <span id="fr_500"></span>[1](#fn_500.md)

##### THE INEFFABILITY OF GOD

The sentence from Hermes is from a lost sermon, a fragment of which is
preserved in an excerpt by Stobæus. It was probably the opening words of
what Stobæus calls “The \[Sermon\] to Tat,” <span
id="fr_501"></span>[2](#fn_501.md) that is to say, probably one of the
“Expository Sermons to Tat,” as Lactantius calls them. <span
id="fr_502"></span>[3](#fn_502.md)

The idea in the saying was a common place in

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hellenistic
theological thought, and need not be always directly referred to the
much-quoted words of Plato: “To find the Father and the Maker of this
universe is a \[great\] work, and finding \[Him\] it is impossible to
tell \[Him\] unto all.” <span id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_503.md) Indeed, it
is curious to remark that Justin reproduces the text of the Hermetic
writer far more faithfully than when he refers directly to the saying of
Plato. <span id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_504.md)

<span class="small">ii. I. *Apologia*, xxi.; Otto, i. 54.</span>

##### HERMES AND ASCLEPIUS SONS OF GOD

And when we say that the Word (*Logos*) which is the first begetting of
God, was begotten without intercourse,—Jesus Christ, our Master,—and
that he was crucified, and was dead, and rose again and ascended into
heaven, we bring forward no new thing beyond those among you who are
called Sons of Zeus. For ye know how many Sons the writers who are held
in honour among you ascribe to Zeus:—Hermes, the Word (*Logos*), who was
the interpreter and teacher of all; and Asclepius, who was also <span
id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_505.md) a healer, <span
id="fr_506"></span>[4](#fn_506.md) and was smitten by the bolt \[of his
sire\] and ascended into heaven . . . \[and many others\] . . .

<span class="small">iii. *Ibid.*, xxii.; Otto, i. 58.</span>

##### HERMES THE WORD WHO BRINGS TIDINGS FROM GOD

But as to the Son of God called Jesus,—even though he were only a man
\[born\] in the common way, \[yet\] because of \[his\] wisdom is he
worthy to be called Son

<span id="page_218">p. 218</span>

of God; for all writers call God “Father of men and gods.” And if we say
\[further\] that he was also in a special way, beyond his common birth,
begotten of God \[as\] Word (*Logos*) of God, let us have this in common
with you who call Hermes the Word (*Logos*) who brings tidings <span
id="fr_507"></span>[1](#fn_507.md) from God.

##### THE SONS OF GOD IN HELLENISTIC THEOLOGY

It is remarkable that Justin heads the list of Sons of God—Dionysus,
Hercules, etc.—with Hermes and Asclepius. Moreover, when he returns to
the subject he again refers to Hermes and to Hermes alone. This clearly
shows that the most telling parallel he could bring forward was that of
Hermes, who, in the Hellenistic theological world of his day, was
especially thought of under the concept of the Logos.

The immediate association of the name of Asclepius with that of Hermes
is also remarkable, and indicates that they were closely associated in
Justin’s mind; the indication, however, is too vague to permit of any
positive deduction as to an Asclepius-element in the Trismegistic
literature current in Rome in Justin’s time. Justin, in any case, has
apparently very little first-hand knowledge of the subject, for he
introduces the purely Hellenic myth of Asclepius being struck by a
thunderbolt, which, we need hardly say, is entirely foreign to the
conception of the Hellenistic Asclepius, the disciple of Hermes.

##### AN UNVERIFIABLE QUOTATION

To these quotations Chambers (p. 139) adds the following passage from
*II. Apologia*, vi.,—which in date may be placed some four or five years
after the First.

<span id="page_219">p. 219</span>

“Now to the Father of all no name can be given; seeing that He is
ingenerable; for by whatsoever name one may be called, he has as his
elder the one who gives the name. But ‘Father,’ and ‘God,’ and
‘Creator,’ and ‘Lord,’ and ‘Master’ are not names, but terms of address
\[derived\] from His blessings and His works.”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is quite true that this passage might be taken verbally from a
Hermetic tractate, but I can find no authority in the text of Justin for
claiming it as a quotation. For the same idea in Hermes compare *C. H.*,
v. (vi.) 10, and Lact., *D. I*., i. 6.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_497"></span>[215:1](th331.htm#fr_497.md) The *Exhortation* is
considered by most pseudepigraphic, but is supposed by others to be the
earliest work of Justin, which may be placed conjecturally about 130
A.D.; the *First Apology* is generally ascribed to the year 148 A.D.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[215:2](th331.htm#fr_498.md) Taking the reading
περὶ ἑαυτοῦ (Otto, n. 13), adopted in R. 138.

<span id="fn_499"></span>[215:3](th331.htm#fr_499.md) Quoted also by
Lactantius, *D. I. Epit*., 4; Cyril Alex., *Con*. *Jul.*, i. 31; and
Stobæus, *Flor*., lxxx. \[lxxviii.\], 94 (Ex. ii. 1).

<span id="fn_500"></span>[216:1](th331.htm#fr_500.md) R. 138. The
connection between this Ammon and Hermes was probably the same as that
which is said to have existed between the king-god Thamus-Ammon and the
god of invention Theuth-Hermes. Thamus-Ammon was a king philosopher, to
whom Theuth brought all his inventions and discoveries for his (Ammon’s)
judgment, which was not invariably favourable. See the pleasant story
told by Plato, *Phædrus*, 274 C. *Cf.* also the notes on Kneph-Ammon,
*K. K*., 19, Comment.

<span id="fn_504"></span>[217:2](th331.htm#fr_504.md) See *Cohort*., xxii.;
*II. Apol*., x. Clemens Alex., Origen, Minutius Felix, Lactantius, and
other of the Fathers also quote this saying of Plato.

<span id="fn_505"></span>[217:3](th331.htm#fr_505.md) That is, like Jesus.
