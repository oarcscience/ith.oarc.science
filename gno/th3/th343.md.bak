### JAMBLICHUS

##### ABAMMON THE TEACHER

<span class="smallcaps">The</span> evidence of Jamblichus <span
id="fr_725"></span>[1](#fn_725.md) is of prime importance seeing that it
was he who put the Later Platonic School, previously led by the purely
philosophical Ammonius, Plotinus and Porphyry, into conscious touch with
those centres of Gnosis into which he had been initiated, and instructed
it especially in the Wisdom of Egypt in his remarkable treatise
generally known by the title *On the Mysteries*. The authorship of this
treatise is usually disputed; but as Proclus, who was in the direct
tradition, attributes it to Jamblichus, the probabilities are in favour
of its authenticity.

Jamblichus writes with the authority of an accredited exponent of the
Egyptian Wisdom as taught in these mysteries, and under the name of
“Abammon, the Teacher,” proceeds to resolve the doubts and difficulties
of the School with regard to the principles of the

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

sacred science as formulated by Porphyry. Jamblichus begins his task
with these significant words <span id="fr_726"></span>[1](#fn_726.md):

##### HERMES THE INSPIRER

“Hermes, the God who is our guide in \[sacred\] sermons, was rightly
held of old as common to all priests. And seeing that it is he who has
in charge the real science about the Gods, he is the same in all \[our
sacred sermons\]. <span id="fr_727"></span>[2](#fn_727.md) And so it was to
him that our ancestors attributed all the discoveries of their wisdom,
attaching the name of Hermes to all the writings which had to do with
such subjects. <span id="fr_728"></span>[3](#fn_728.md) And if we also
enjoy that share of this God which has fallen to our lot, according to
our ability \[to receive him\], thou dost well in submitting certain
questions on theology to us priests, as thy friends, for their solution.
And as I may fairly suppose that the letter sent to my disciple Anebo
was written to myself, I will send thee the true answers to the
questions thou hast asked. For it would not be proper that Pythagoras
and Plato, and Democritus and Eudoxus, and many others of the ancient
Greeks, <span id="fr_729"></span>[4](#fn_729.md) should have obtained
fitting instruction

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

from the recorders of the sacred science of their times, and that thou,
our contemporary, who art of a like mind with these ancients, should
lack guidance from the now living bearers of the title ‘Common
Teachers.’” <span id="fr_730"></span>[1](#fn_730.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the above important passage we learn that among the Egyptians the
books which dealt technically with the science of sacred things, and
especially with the science of the Gods, that is to say, with the nature
of the hierarchy from man upwards to the Supreme Ruler of our system,
were regarded as “inspired.” The Ray of the Spiritual Sun which
illumined the sacred science was distinguished as a Person, and this
Person, because of a partial similarity of attributes, the Greeks had
long identified with their God Hermes. He was “common” to the priests of
the sacred science, that is to say, it was this special Ray of the
Spiritual Sun which illumined their studies. Not, however, that all were
equally illumined, for there were many grades in the mysteries, many
steps up the holy ascent to union

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

with Deity. Now the Rays of the Spiritual Sun are really One Light,
“polarised” variously by the “spheres” of which we have heard so much in
the Trismegistic treatises. These Rays come forth from the Logos, and
each illuminates a certain division of the whole hierarchy of beings
from the Logos to man, and characterises further the lower kingdoms,
animals and plants, and minerals. Hence, for instance, among animals, we
get the ibis, the ape and the dog as being especially sacred to Thoth or
Hermes.

##### THOSE OF THE HERMAÏC NATURE

Among men generally, also, there are certain whose characteristics are
of a “Hermaïc” <span id="fr_731"></span>[1](#fn_731.md) nature; the more
evolved of these are adapted to certain lines of study and research,
while again among those few of these who are beginning to be really
conscious of the science of sacred things, that is to say, among the
initiated students or priests, the direct influence of this Ray or
Person begins to be consciously felt, by each, as Jamblichus says,
according to his ability, for there are still many grades.

Now the peculiar unanimity that prevailed in these strictly hierarchical
schools of initiation, and the grand doctrine of identification that ran
throughout the whole economy—whereby the pupil became identified with
the master when he received his next grade of initiation, and whereby
his master was to him the living symbol of all that was above that
master, that is to say, was Hermes for him, in that he was the messenger
to him of the Word, and was the channel whereby the divine inspiration
came to him—rendered the ascription to

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hermes of all the
sacred scriptures, such as the sermons of initiation, a very natural
proceeding. It was not the case of a modern novel-writer taking out a
copyright for his own precious productions, but simply of the recorder,
scribe or copyist of the sacred science handing on the tradition. As
long as this was confined to the disciplined schools of the sacred
science it was without danger, but when irresponsible people began to
copy a method, to whose discipline they refused to submit, for purposes
of edification, and so appended the names of great teachers to their own
lucubrations, they paved the way for that chaos of confusion in which we
are at present stumbling.

##### THE BOOKS OF HERMES

Towards the end of his treatise Jamblichus, in treating of the question
of the innumerable hierarchies of being and their sub-hierarchies, says
that these are so multiplex that they had to be treated by the ancient
priests from various aspects, and even among those who were “wise in
great things” in his own time the teaching was not one and the same.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

“The *main* states of being were completely set forth by Hermes (in the
twenty thousand books, as Seleucus <span id="fr_732"></span>[1](#fn_732.md)
writes, or in the thirty-six thousand five hundred and twenty-five as
Manetho relates), while the *sub-states* are interpreted in many other
writings by the ancients, some of them sub-dividing <span
id="fr_733"></span>[2](#fn_733.md) some of the sub-states and others
others.” <span id="fr_734"></span>[3](#fn_734.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

At first sight it would seem that we are not to suppose

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

that it took 20,000 volumes to set forth the *main outlines* of the
cosmic system. Jamblichus would seem to mean that in the library or
libraries of the books treating of the sacred science, the general
scheme of the cosmos was set forth, and that the details were filled in
very variously by many writers, each according to the small portion of
the whole he had studied or speculated on. As to the number of books
again we should not be dismayed, when we reflect that a book did not
mean a large roll or volume but a division or chapter of such a roll.
Thus we read of a single man composing no less than 6000 “books”!

But on further reflection this view does not seem satisfactory. The
ghost of the very precise number 36,525, which Jamblichus substitutes
from Manetho for the vague total 20,000 of Seleucus, refuses to be laid
by such a weak-kneed process.

We see at once that 365⋅25 days is a very close approximation to the
length of the solar year. We know further that 36,525 years was the sum
of 25 Sothiac cycles (1461 × 25 = 36,525), <span
id="fr_735"></span>[1](#fn_735.md) that most sacred time-period of the
Egyptian secret astronomy, which was assigned to the revolution of the
zodiac or the Great Year. Now supposing after all that Jamblichus *does*
mean that Hermes actually did write the scheme of the cosmos in 36,525
“books” or “chapters”; and supposing further that these “chapters” were
not written on papyrus, but in the heavens; and supposing still further
that these “chapters” were simply so many great aspects of the real sun,
just as the 365⋅25 days were but aspects of the physical sun—in such
case the above favourite passage, which every previous writer has
referred to actual books superscribed with the

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

name of Hermes, and has dragged into every treatise on the Hermetic
writings, will in future have to be removed from the list, and one of
the functions of the real Hermes, the Initiator and Recorder, will
become apparent to those who are “wise in greater things.”

##### THE MONAD FROM THE ONE

In the next chapter, after first speaking of the God over all,
Jamblichus refers to the Logos, the God of our system, whom he calls
“God of gods, the Monad from the One, prior to being and the source of
being.” And then continues:

“For from Him cometh the essence of being and being; wherefore is He
called Father of being. For He is prior to being, the source of
spiritual existences; wherefore also is He called Source of spiritual
things. These latter are the most ancient sources of all things, and
Hermes places them before the æthereal and empyrean and celestial gods,
bequeathing to us a hundred books on the history of the empyrean, and a
like number on that of the æthereal, but a thousand of them concerning
the celestial.” <span id="fr_736"></span>[1](#fn_736.md)

I am inclined to think that there is a mistake in the numbers of these
books, and that we should have 10 assigned to the first class, 100 to
the second, and 1000 to the third. In any case we see that all are
multiples of the perfect number 10; and that thus my theory is still
supported by the further information that Jamblichus gives us.

##### THE TRADITION OF THE TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

We next come to a passage which deals directly with our Trismegistic
literature. Jamblichus tells Porphyry that with the explanations he has
already

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

given him, he will be able to find his way in the Hermetic writings
which have come into his hands.

“For the books in circulation bearing the name of Hermes contain Hermaïc
doctrines, although they often use the language of the philosophers,
seeing that they were translated from the Egyptian by men well skilled
in philosophy.” <span id="fr_737"></span>[1](#fn_737.md)

The information given by Jamblichus is precise; they were translations,
but instead of a literal rendering, the translators used the usual
phraseology of the Greek philosophical writers.

Jamblichus then goes on to say that physical astronomy and physical
research generally were but a very small part of the Hermaïc science, by
no means the most important.

For “the Egyptians deny that physics are everything; on the contrary
they distinguish both the life of the soul and the life of the mind from
nature, <span id="fr_738"></span>[2](#fn_738.md) not only in the case of
the cosmos but also in man. They first posit Mind and Reason (*Logos*)
as having a being peculiar to themselves, and then they tell us that the
world of becoming \[or generation\] is created. As Forefather of all
beings in generation they place the Creator, and are acquainted with the
Life-giving Power which is prior to the celestial spaces and permeates
them. Above the universe they place Pure Mind; this for the universe as
a whole is one and undivided, but it is variously manifested in the
several spheres. <span id="fr_739"></span>[3](#fn_739.md) And they do not
speculate about these things with the unassisted reason, but they
announce that by the divine art of their priestly science <span
id="fr_740"></span>[4](#fn_740.md) they reach higher and more

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

universal states \[of consciousness\] above the \[Seven Spheres of\]
Destiny, ascending to God the Creator, <span
id="fr_741"></span>[1](#fn_741.md) and that too without using any material
means, or any other \[material\] assistance than the observation of a
suitable opportunity.

“It was Hermes who first taught this Path. <span
id="fr_742"></span>[2](#fn_742.md) And Bitys, the prophet, translated \[his
teachings concerning it\] for King Ammon, <span
id="fr_743"></span>[3](#fn_743.md) discovering them in the inner
temple <span id="fr_744"></span>[4](#fn_744.md) in an inscription in the
sacred characters at Saïs in Egypt. \[From these writings it was that
Bitys\] handed on the tradition of the Name of God, as ‘That which
pervadeth the whole universe.’” <span id="fr_745"></span>[5](#fn_745.md)

“As to the Good Itself \[the Egyptians\] regard It in Its relation to
the Divine as the God that transcends all thought, and in Its relation
to man as the at-onement with Him—a doctrine which Bitys translated from
the Hermaïc Books.” <span id="fr_746"></span>[6](#fn_746.md)

From these two passages we learn that the ancient doctrine of Hermes
concerning the Path, which is the keynote of our Trismegistic tracts,
was to be found either in inscriptions in the sacred script in the
secret chambers of the temples, into which no uninitiated person was
ever permitted to enter, or in “books,” also in the sacred script; that
these had never been translated until the reign of King Ammon. <span
id="fr_747"></span>[7](#fn_747.md) But what are we to understand by
translated? Into Greek? Not necessarily, but more probably interpreted
from the

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

hieroglyphic symbols into the Egyptian vernacular and written in the
demotic character. The term used (διερμηνεύειν) clearly bears this
sense; whereas if translation from Egyptian into Greek had been
intended, we should presumably have had the same word (μεταγράφειν)
employed which Jamblichus uses when speaking of the Hermetic books that
had been read by Porphyry. Reitzenstein (p. 108), however, has
apparently no doubt that the writings of Bitys were in Greek, and that
these writings lay before Jamblichus and were the only source of his
information. But I cannot be certain that this is the meaning of the
Greek.

We have rather, according to my view, probably two strata of
“translation”—from hieroglyphic into demotic, from demotic into Greek.
As to Bitys, we know nothing more definite than Jamblichus tells us.
Perhaps he was the first to translate from the sacred hieroglyphs into
the vulgar tongue and script; and by that we mean the first to break the
ancient rule and write down in the vulgar characters those holy sermons
and treatises which previously had never before been inscribed in any
but the most sacred characters. We are not, however, to suppose that
Bitys was the only one to do this.

Now in our Trismegistic literature we have a deposit addressed to a King
Ammon. Is it then possible that this King, whoever he was, was the
initiator of a change of policy in the immemorial practice of the
priests? It may be so, but at present we have not sufficient data to
decide the point.

##### BITYS

A further scrap of information concerning Bitys, however, may be gleaned
from Zosimus (§ 8), when, speaking of the Logos, the Son of God, pouring
His Light

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

into the soul and starting it on its Return Above, to the Blessed Region
where it was before it had become corporeal (as described in the
Trismegistic tractate, entitled “Concerning the Inner Door”)—he writes:

“And there shall it see the Picture (πίναξ) that both Bitos hath
described, and thrice-greatest Plato, and ten-thousand-times-great
Hermes,—for Thōythos translated it into the first sacred tongue,—Thōth
the First Man.” <span id="fr_748"></span>[1](#fn_748.md)

The identity of Bitys and Bitos is thus unquestionable. <span
id="fr_749"></span>[2](#fn_749.md) Reitzenstein, however, asserts that
neither of these name-forms is Egyptian, and therefore approves of the
identification of our Bitys with “Pitys the Thessalian” of the
Papyri, <span id="fr_750"></span>[3](#fn_750.md) as Dieterich has
suggested. The headings of the fragments of the writings of Pitys in the
Papyri run: “The Way \[or Method\] of Pitys”; “Pitys to King Ostanes
Greeting”; “The Way of Pitys the King”; “Of Pitys the Thessalian.”

From this Reitzenstein (n. 2) concludes that already in the second and
third centuries (? A.D.) Pitys is included among the prophetical
theologi and Magians. What the precise date of these Papyri may be it is
not easy to determine, but, whether or not they belong to the second and
third centuries, it is evident that Pitys was regarded as ancient and a
contemporary of the Magian Sage Ostanes.

King, <span id="fr_751"></span>[4](#fn_751.md) referring to a passage of
the Elder Pliny (*Nat. Hist*., xxx. 4), which remarks on the similarity
of the

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Magian Gnosis with
the Druidical Gnosis of Gaul and Britain, says: “Pliny by his ‘Magica’
understands the rites instituted by Zoroaster, and first promulgated by
Osthanes to the outer world, this Osthanes having been ‘military
chaplain’ to Xerxes during his expedition to Greece.”

This date, if we can rely upon it, would take us back to the Persian
Conquest of Egypt, but what has a Thessalian Pitys to do with that?

Curiously enough also Pliny in his xxviiith Book makes use of the
writings of a certain Bithus of Dyrrachium, a city on the coast of
Illyricum in the Ionic Gulf, known in Grecian history as Epidamnus.

All of this is puzzling enough; but whatever conclusions may be drawn
from the evidence, the clearest indication is that Bitys was ancient,
and therefore that whatever translating or rather “interpreting” there
may have been, it was probably from hieroglyphic into demotic, and the
latter was subsequently further “interpreted” into Greek.

##### OSTANES-ASCLEPIUS

But is Ostanes the Magian Sage of tradition, or may we adopt the
brilliant conclusion of Maspero, and equate Ostanes with Asclepius, and
so place him in the same circle with Bitys, or rather see in Bitys an
“Asclepius”?

At any rate the following interesting paragraph of Granger <span
id="fr_752"></span>[1](#fn_752.md) deserves our closest attention in this
connection, when he writes:

“Maspero, following Goodwin, has shown that Ostanes is the name of a
deity who belongs to the cycle of

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thoth. <span
id="fr_753"></span>[1](#fn_753.md) His name, Ysdnw, was derived by the
Egyptians themselves from a verb meaning ‘to distinguish’ and he was a
patron of intellectual perception. As time went on, he gained in
importance. Under the Ptolemies he was often represented upon the Temple
walls (*l.c*.). In Pliny he appears as an early writer upon
medicine. <span id="fr_754"></span>[2](#fn_754.md) Some of the
prescriptions quoted as from him are quite in the Egyptian style. <span
id="fr_755"></span>[3](#fn_755.md) Philo Byblius, on whom, to be sure, not
much reliance can be placed, <span id="fr_756"></span>[4](#fn_756.md)
mentions a book of Ostanes—the *Octateuch*. <span
id="fr_757"></span>[5](#fn_757.md) It is tempting to identify this with
some such collection as the six medical books which occupy the last
place in Clement’s list. <span id="fr_758"></span>[6](#fn_758.md) Now
Pliny, as appears from his list of authorities, does not quote Ostanes
directly. If we note that Democritus is mentioned by Pliny in the same
context, and that Ostanes is the legendary teacher of Democritus upon
his journey to Egypt, we shall consider it at least probable that Pliny
depends upon Democritus for his mention of Ostanes. The Philosopher,
whose visit to Egypt may be regarded as a historical fact, would in that
case be dealing with a medical collection which passes under the name of
Ostanes. Asclepius, who appears in the *Pœmander*, will be the Greek
equivalent of Ostanes. Thus the collocation of Hermes and Asclepius is
analogous to the kinship of the Egyptian deities, Thoth and Ysdnw.”

##### FROM THE HERMAÏC WRITINGS

That these Bitys-books contained the same doctrines as our Trismegistic
writings is evident from the whole

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

treatise of Jamblichus. Jamblichus throughout bases himself upon the
doctrines of Hermes, <span id="fr_759"></span>[1](#fn_759.md) and clearly
suggests that he does not owe his information to translations only, as
was the case with Porphyry, but to records in Egyptian; but whether to
the demotic treatises of the Bitys-school or to the heiroglyphic records
themselves he does not say. That these doctrines were identical with the
teachings in our Trismegistic literature requires no proof to any one
who has read our treatises and the exposition of Jamblichus; for the
benefit, however, of those who have not read Jamblichus, <span
id="fr_760"></span>[2](#fn_760.md) we append a passage to show the striking
similarity of ideas. Treating of the question of freewill and necessity
raised by Porphyry, and replying to the objection that the Egyptians
taught an astrological fatalism, Jamblichus writes:

“We must explain to you how the question stands by some further
conceptions drawn from the Hermaïc writings. Man has two souls, as these
writings say. The one is from the First Mind, and partakes also of the
Power of the Creator, <span id="fr_761"></span>[3](#fn_761.md) while the
other, the soul under constraint, comes from the revolution of the
celestial \[Spheres\] <span id="fr_762"></span>[4](#fn_762.md); into the
latter the former, the soul that is the Seer of God, insinuates itself
at a later period. This then being so, the soul that descends into us
from the worlds <span id="fr_763"></span>[5](#fn_763.md) keeps time with
the circuits of these worlds, while the soul from the Mind, existing in
us in a spiritual fashion, is free from the whirl of

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Generation; by
this the bonds of Destiny are burst asunder; by this the Path up to the
spiritual Gods is brought to birth; by such a life as this is that Great
Art Divine, which leads us up to That beyond the Spheres of
Genesis, <span id="fr_764"></span>[1](#fn_764.md) brought to its
consummation.” <span id="fr_765"></span>[2](#fn_765.md)

##### THE COSMIC SPHERES

With regard to the nature of these Spheres, Jamblichus shows very
clearly that they are not the physical planets, as may be seen from the
following passages of his *De Mysteriis*:

“With regard to partial existences, then, I mean in the case of the soul
in partial manifestation, <span id="fr_766"></span>[3](#fn_766.md) we must
admit something of the kind we have above. For just such a life as the
\[human\] soul emanated before it entered into a human body, and just
such a type as it made ready for itself, just such a body, to use as an
instrument, does it have attached to it, and just such a corresponding
nature accompanies \[this body\] and receives the more perfect life the
soul pours into it. But with regard to superior existences and those
that surround the Source of All as perfect existences, the inferior are
set within the superior, bodies in bodiless existences, things made in
their makers; and the former are kept in position by the latter
enclosing them in a sphere.

“The revolutions of the heavenly *Bodies*, <span
id="fr_767"></span>[4](#fn_767.md) therefore, being from the first set in
the celestial revolutions of the æthereal *Soul*, <span
id="fr_768"></span>[5](#fn_768.md) for ever continue in this relationship;
while the *Souls* of the \[invisible\] Worlds, <span
id="fr_769"></span>[6](#fn_769.md) extending to their \[common\] *Mind*,
are completely

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

surrounded by it, and from the beginning have their birth *in* it. And
*Mind* in like manner, both partially and as a whole, is also contained
in superior states of existence.” <span id="fr_770"></span>[1](#fn_770.md)

And again in another passage Jamblichus writes:

“We say that \[the Spiritual Sun and Moon, and the rest\] are so far
from being contained within their Bodies, that on the contrary, it is
they who contain these Bodies of theirs within the Spheres of their own
vitality and energy. And so far are they from tending towards their
Bodies, that the tendency of these very Bodies is towards their Divine
Cause. Moreover, their Bodies do not impede the perfection of their
Spiritual and Incorporeal Nature or disturb it by being situated in
it.” <span id="fr_771"></span>[2](#fn_771.md)

To this we may add what Proclus writes in his Commentary on the *Timæus*
of Plato:

“Each of the \[Seven\] Planetary Spheres is a complete World containing
a number of divine offspring, which are invisible to us, and over all of
these Spheres the Star <span id="fr_772"></span>[3](#fn_772.md) we see is
the Ruler. Now Fixed Stars differ from those <span
id="fr_773"></span>[4](#fn_773.md) in the Planetary Spheres in that the
former have but one Monad, namely, their system as a whole <span
id="fr_774"></span>[5](#fn_774.md); while the latter, namely the invisible
globes in each of the Planetary Spheres, which globes have an orbit of
their own determined by the revolution of their respective Spheres, have
a double Monad—namely, their system as a whole, <span
id="fr_775"></span>[6](#fn_775.md) and that dominant characteristic which
has been evolved by selection in the several spheres of the system. For
since globes are secondary to Fixed Stars they require a double order of
government,

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

first subordination to their system as a whole, and then subordination
to their respective spheres. <span id="fr_776"></span>[1](#fn_776.md) And
that in each of these spheres there is a host <span
id="fr_777"></span>[2](#fn_777.md) on the same level <span
id="fr_778"></span>[3](#fn_778.md) with each, you may infer from the
extremes. <span id="fr_779"></span>[4](#fn_779.md) For if the Fixed
Sphere <span id="fr_780"></span>[5](#fn_780.md) has a host on the same
level as itself, and Earth has a host of earthy animals, <span
id="fr_781"></span>[6](#fn_781.md) just as the former a host of heavenly
animals, <span id="fr_782"></span>[7](#fn_782.md) it is necessary that
every whole <span id="fr_783"></span>[8](#fn_783.md) should have a number
of animals on the same level with itself; indeed it is because of the
latter fact that they are called wholes. The intermediate levels,
however, are outside the range of our senses, the extremes only being
visible, the one through the transcendent brilliance of its nature, the
other through its kinship with ourselves.” <span
id="fr_784"></span>[9](#fn_784.md)

It is evident that we are here dealing with what are known to
Theosophical students as the “planetary chains” of our system, and that
therefore these Spheres are not the physical planets; the visible
planets are

<span id="page_302">p. 302</span>

but a very small portion of the globes of these chains, of some of which
there are no globes at all visible. The ascription therefore of the
“influence” of these Spheres to the sun, moon, and five of the visible
planets is at best a makeshift, a “correspondence,” or a “symbolism.”

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_725"></span>[285:1](th343.htm#fr_725.md) The exact date of
Jamblichus is very conjectural. In my sketches of the “Lives of the
Later Platonists” I have suggested about A.D. 255-330. See *The
Theosophical Review* (Aug. 1896), xviii. 462, 463.

<span id="fn_726"></span>[286:1](th343.htm#fr_726.md) I translate from the
text of Parthey (Berlin, 1857).

<span id="fn_727"></span>[286:2](th343.htm#fr_727.md) The term λόγος is, of
course, used technically, as a sacred or inspired sermon or course of
instruction.

<span id="fn_728"></span>[286:3](th343.htm#fr_728.md) πάντα τὰ οἰκεῖα
συγγράμματα.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[286:4](th343.htm#fr_729.md) Parthey here adds the
following interesting note: “The Egyptian teachers of Pythagoras were
Œnuphis of On (Plut., *De Is. et Os*., 10) and Sonchis (Clem. Al.,
*Strom*., i. 15, 69); Plato was the pupil of Sechnuphis of On (Clem.
*l.c.*) and of Chonuphis (Plut., *De Gen. Socr*., 578); Democritus was
taught by Pammenes of Memphis (Georg. Sync., i. 471 Dind.); Eudoxus by
Chonuphis of Memphis (Plut. and Clem. *ll*. *cc*.).” To this Parthey
appends a list of some of the many other famous Greeks who owed their
knowledge to Egyptian teachers, viz., Alcæus, Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ,
Appuleius, Archimedes, Bias, Chrysippus of Cnidus, Cleobulus, Dædalus,
Decæneus, Diodorus Siculus, Ellopion, Euripides, Hecatæus of Abdera,
Hecatæus of Miletus, Hellanicus, Herodotus, Homerus, Lycurgus, Melampus,
Musæus, Œnopides of Chios, Orpheus, Pausanias, Pherecydes, Polybius,
Simmias, Solon, Sphærus, Strabo, Telecles, Thales, Theodorus, Xenophanes
of Colophon, Zamolxis. I have quoted this note on purpose to show the
overpowering weight of evidence which some modern theorists have to
face, in order to maintain their thesis that the philosophy of Greece
was solely a native product. The universal testimony of the Greeks
themselves is that all their greatest philosophers, geometricians,
mathematicians, historians, geographers, and especially their
theosophists, were pupils of the Egyptian Wisdom; the modern theory of
the unaided evolution of philosophy on the soil of Greece, which is so
universally accepted, is, to my mind, entirely erroneous. The “form” or
“manner” of “philosophizing” was of course solely due to Greek genius,
but the “matter” of it was of hoary antiquity. *Cf.* Plutarch, *De Is.
et Os*., x.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[287:1](th343.htm#fr_730.md) That is to say,
presumably, teachers of all without distinction of race. *Op. cit*., i.
1.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[288:1](th343.htm#fr_731.md) It is from this
region of ideas that the terms “mercurial temperament,” and so forth,
have reached modern times over the bridge of astrological tradition.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[289:1](th343.htm#fr_732.md) Porphyry (*De Abs*.,
ii. c. 55) mentions a Seleucus whom he calls a “theologist”; Suidas says
that Seleucus of Alexandria wrote a treatise *On the Gods*, in 100 books
or chapters.

simply record it.

can see (*i.e*. the visible planets), the manner of those we cannot see.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[301:5](th343.htm#fr_780.md) The sphere of fixed
stars or suns.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[301:6](th343.htm#fr_781.md) That is to say, all
the visible globes (*vulgo* planets) of our system as a whole. An
“animal” means a “*living* thing”; so that here “earthy animals” mean
the living vehicles of the heavenly beings which we so erroneously call
“heavenly bodies.”

<span id="fn_782"></span>[301:7](th343.htm#fr_782.md) That is to say, suns
or solar systems.

<span id="fn_783"></span>[301:8](th343.htm#fr_783.md) Here whole means
plane.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[301:9](th343.htm#fr_784.md) That is to say, the
brilliant light of the suns in space, and the reflected light of the
physical globes of the planetary spheres of our system. See Proclus,
*Commentarius in Platonis Timæum*, Bk. iv., p. 279 D, E, p. 676, ed.
Schneider (Vratislaviæ, 1847). The passage is very difficult to
translate because of its technical nature. Taylor, in his translation
(London, 1820, ii. 281, 282), misses nearly every point.
