<p><h3 align="center" align="center">ZOSIMUS</h3></p>
<p><h5 align="center">ON THE ANTHR&#332;POS-DOCTRINE</h5></p>
<p>(<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Zosimus</span> flourished somewhere at the end of the third and beginning of the fourth century A.D. He was a member of what Reitzenstein (p. 9) calls the Poimandres-Gemeinde, and, in writing to a certain Theosebeia, a fellow-believer in the Wisdom-tradition, though not as yet initiated into its spiritual mysteries, he urges her to hasten to Poimandres and baptize herself in the Cup.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_661"></A><A HREF="#fn_661"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> The following quotation is of first importance for the understanding of the Anthr&#333;pos-Doctrine or Myth of Man in the Mysteries.</p>
<p>In one of the Books of his great work distinguished by the letter Omega, and dedicated to Oceanus as the &#8220;Genesis and Seed of all the Gods,&#8221;&#8212;speaking of the uninitiated, those still beneath the sway of the Heimarmen&#275; or Fate, who cannot understand his revelations,&#8212;he writes&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_662"></A><A HREF="#fn_662"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>:)</p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE PROCESSIONS OF FATE.</h5></p>
<p>1. Such men [our] Hermes, in his &#8220;Concerning Nature,&#8221; hath called mind-less,&#8212;naught but &#8220;processions&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_663"></A><A HREF="#fn_663"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> of</p>

<p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="green">p. 274</font></A></p>
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Fate,&#8212;in that they have no notion&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_664"></A><A HREF="#fn_664"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of aught of things incorporal, or even of Fate herself who justly leads them, but they blaspheme her corporal schoolings, and have no notion of aught else but of her favours.</p>
<p><h5 align="center">&#8220;THE INNER DOOR&#8221;</h5></p>
<p>2. But Hermes and Zoroaster have said the Race of Wisdom-lovers is superior to Fate, by their neither rejoicing in her favours,&#8212;for they have mastered pleasures,&#8212;not by their being struck down by her ills,&#8212;for ever living at the &#8220;Inner Door,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_665"></A><A HREF="#fn_665"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> and not receiving&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_666"></A><A HREF="#fn_666"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from her her fair gift, in that they look unto the termination of [her] ills.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_667"></A><A HREF="#fn_667"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>
<p>3. On which account, too, Hesiod doth introduce Prometheus counselling Epimetheus, and doth tell him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_668"></A><A HREF="#fn_668"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> not to take the Gift&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_669"></A><A HREF="#fn_669"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> from Zeus who rules Olympus, but send it back again,&#8212;[thus] teaching his own brother through philosophy&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_670"></A><A HREF="#fn_670"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> to return the Gifts of Zeus,&#8212;that is, of Fate.</p>
<p>4. But Zoroaster, boasting in knowledge of all things Above, and in the magic of embodied speech,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_671"></A><A HREF="#fn_671"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></p>

<p>professes that all ills of Fate,&#8212;both special [ills] and general [ones],&#8212;are [thus] averted.</p>
<p><h5 align="center">AGAINST MAGIC</h5></p>
<p>5. Hermes, however, in his &#8220;About the Inner Door,&#8221; doth deprecate [this] magic even, declaring that:</p>
<p>The spiritual man, [the man] who knows himself,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_672"></A><A HREF="#fn_672"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> should not accomplish any thing by means of magic, e&#146;en though he think it a good thing, nor should he force Necessity, but suffer [her to take her course], according to her nature and decree&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_673"></A><A HREF="#fn_673"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>; [he should] progress by seeking only, through the knowledge of himself and God, to gain the Trinity&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_674"></A><A HREF="#fn_674"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> that none can name, and let Fate do whate&#146;er she will to her own clay&#8212;that is, the body.</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XXVI.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>6. And being so minded (he says), and so ordering his life, he shall behold the Son of God becoming all things for holy souls, that he may draw her&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_675"></A><A HREF="#fn_675"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> forth from out the region of the Fate into the Incorporeal [Man].</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>7.

<p><h5 align="center">THE LIBRARIES OF THE PTOLEMIES</h5></p>
<p>9. The Chald&aelig;ans and Parthians and Medes and Hebrews call Him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_684"></A><A HREF="#fn_684"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> Adam, which is by interpretation virgin Earth, and blood-red&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_685"></A><A HREF="#fn_685"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Earth, and fiery&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_686"></A><A HREF="#fn_686"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> Earth, and fleshly Earth.</p>
<p>10. And these indications were found in the book-collections&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_687"></A><A HREF="#fn_687"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> of the Ptolemies, which they stored away in every temple, and especially in the Serapeum, when they invited Asenas, the chief priest of Jerusalem, to send a &#8220;Hermes,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_688"></A><A HREF="#fn_688"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> who translated the whole of the Hebrew into Greek and Egyptian.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_689"></A><A HREF="#fn_689"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>
<p>11. So the First Man is called by us Th&#333;yth and by them Adam,&#8212;not giving His [true] name in the Language of the Angels, but naming Him symbolically according to His Body by the four elements [or letters] out of His whole Sphere,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_690"></A><A HREF="#fn_690"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> whereas his Inner Man, the</p>

<p><h5 align="center">NIKOTHEOS</h5></p>
<p>12. His authentic [name], however, I know not, owing to the so long [lapse of time&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_692"></A><A HREF="#fn_692"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>]; for Nikotheos&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_693"></A><A HREF="#fn_693"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> who-is-not-to-be-found alone doth know these things.</p>

<p><h5 align="center">FROM THE BOOK OF THE CHALD&AElig;ANS</h5></p>
<p>13.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_695"></A><A HREF="#fn_695"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> &#8220;When Light-Man (<i>Ph&#333;s</i>) was in Paradise, exspiring&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_696"></A><A HREF="#fn_696"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> under the [presence of] Fate, they&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_697"></A><A HREF="#fn_697"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> persuaded Him to clothe himself in the Adam they had made, the [Adam] of Fate, him of the four elements,&#8212;as though [they said] being free from [her&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_698"></A><A HREF="#fn_698"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A>] ills and free from their&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_699"></A><A HREF="#fn_699"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;And He, on account of this &#145;freedom from ills&#146; did</p>

<p>not refuse; but they boasted as though He had been brought into servitude [to them].&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_700"></A><A HREF="#fn_700"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>14. For Hesiod said that the outer man was the &#8220;bond&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_701"></A><A HREF="#fn_701"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> by which Zeus bound Prometheus.</p>
<p>Subsequently, in addition to this bond, he sends him another, Pand&#333;ra,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_702"></A><A HREF="#fn_702"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> whom the Hebrews call Eve.</p>
<p>For Prometheus and Epimetheus&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_703"></A><A HREF="#fn_703"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> are one Man, according to the system of allegory,&#8212;that is, Soul and Body.</p>
<p><h5 align="center">MAN THE MIND</h5></p>
<p>And at one time He&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_704"></A><A HREF="#fn_704"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> bears the likeness of soul, at another of mind, at another of flesh, owing to the imperfect attention which Epimetheus paid to the counsel of Prometheus, his own mind.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_705"></A><A HREF="#fn_705"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A></p>
<p>15. For our Mind&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_706"></A><A HREF="#fn_706"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A> saith:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT XXVII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>For that the Son of God having power in all things, becoming all things that he willeth, appeareth as he willeth to each.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_707"></A><A HREF="#fn_707"><FONT SIZE="1">8</FONT></A></blockquote></p>

<p>16. Yea, unto the consummation of the cosmos will He come secretly,&#8212;nay, openly associating with His own,&#8212;counselling them secretly, yea through their minds, to settle their account with their Adam, the blind accuser,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_708"></A><A HREF="#fn_708"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> in rivalry with the spiritual man of light.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_709"></A><A HREF="#fn_709"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>
<p><h5 align="center">THE COUNTERFEIT DAIMON</h5></p>
<p>17. And these things come to pass until the Counterfeit Daimon&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_710"></A><A HREF="#fn_710"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> come, in rivalry with themselves, and wishing to lead them into error, declaring that he is Son of God, being formless in both soul and body.</p>
<p>But they, becoming wiser from contemplation of</p>

</p>
<p><a name="page_282"><font size="1" color="green">p. 282</font></A></p>
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Him who is truly Son of God, give unto him&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_711"></A><A HREF="#fn_711"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> his own Adam for death,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_712"></A><A HREF="#fn_712"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> rescuing their own light spirits for [return to] their own regions where they were even before the cosmos [existed].&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_713"></A><A HREF="#fn_713"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
<p>18. And [it is] the Hebrews alone and the Sacred Books of Hermes [which tell us] these things about the man of light and his Guide the Son of God, and about the earthy Adam and <i>his</i> Guide, the Counterfeit, who doth blasphemously call himself Son of God, for leading men astray.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_714"></A><A HREF="#fn_714"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>
<p>19. But the Greeks call the earthy Adam Epimetheus, who is counselled by his own mind, that is, his brother, not to receive the gifts of Zeus. Nevertheless being both deceived&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_715"></A><A HREF="#fn_715"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> and repenting,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_716"></A><A HREF="#fn_716"><FONT SIZE="1">6</FONT></A> and seeking the Blessed Land.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_717"></A><A HREF="#fn_717"><FONT SIZE="1">7</FONT></A></p>
<p>But Prometheus, that is the mind, interprets all things and gives good counsel in all things to them who have understanding and hearing. But they who have only fleshly hearing are &#8220;processions of Fate.&#8221;</p>

<p><h5 align="center">HIS ADVICE TO THEOSEBEIA</h5></p>
<p>To the foregoing we may append a version of Zosimus&#146; advice&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_718"></A><A HREF="#fn_718"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> to the lady Theosebeia, to which we have already referred, as offering an instructive counterpart to <i>C. H.</i>, xiii. (xiv.). After a sally against the &#8220;false prophets,&#8221; through whom the daimones energize, not only requiring their offerings but also ruining their souls, Zosimus continues:</p>
<p align="center"><HR ALIGN="CENTER" SIZE="1" WIDTH="25%" NOSHADE></p> 
<p>&#8220;But be not thou, O lady, [thus] distracted, as, too, I bade thee in the actualizing [rites], and do not turn thyself about this way and that in seeking after God; but in thy house be still, and God shall come to thee, He who is everywhere and not in some wee spot as are daimonian things.</p>
<p>&#8220;And having stilled thyself in body, still thou thyself in passions too&#8212;desire, [and] pleasure, rage [and] grief, and the twelve fates&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_719"></A><A HREF="#fn_719"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of Death.</p>
<p>&#8220;And thus set straight and upright, call thou unto thyself Divinity; and truly shall He come, He who is everywhere and [yet] nowhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;And [then], without invoking them, perform the sacred rites unto the daimones,&#8212;not such as offer things to them and soothe and nourish them, but such as turn them from thee and destroy their power, which Mambres&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_720"></A><A HREF="#fn_720"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> taught to Solomon, King of Jerusalem, and all that Solomon himself wrote down from his own wisdom.</p>
<p>&#8220;And if thou shalt effectively perform these rites,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_284"><font size="1" color="green">p. 284</font></A></p>
<p>thou shalt obtain the physical conditions of pure birth. And so continue till thou perfect thy soul completely.</p>
<p>&#8220;And when thou knowest surely that thou art perfected in thyself, then spurn&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. from thee&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_721"></A><A HREF="#fn_721"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> the natural things of matter, and make for harbour in P&#339;mandres&#146;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_722"></A><A HREF="#fn_722"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> arms, and having dowsed thyself within His Cup,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_723"></A><A HREF="#fn_723"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> return again unto thy own [true] race.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_724"></A><A HREF="#fn_724"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>This was how Zosimus understood the teaching of the Trismegistic tradition, for he had experienced it.</p>

<p>According to the number-system of the Gnostic Marcus, there are: seven vowels, eight semi-vowels, and nine mutes (<i>F. F. F.</i>, p. 368).

For Nikotheos, see the Gnostic &#8220;Untitled Apocalypse&#8221; of the Codex Brucianus (C. Schmidt, <i>Gnos. Schrift. in kop. Sprach. aus d. C. B.</i>, p. 285), p. 12a: &#8220;Nikotheos hath spoken of Him [namely, the Alone-begotten,&#8212;see <i>ibid</i>., p. 601], and seen Him; for he is one [<i>sc</i>. of those who have seen Him face to face]. He [N.] said: &#145;The Father exists exalted above all the perfect.&#146; He [N.] hath revealed the Invisible and the perfect Triple-power.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the <i>Life of Plotinus</i>, by Porphyry (c. xiv.), among the list of &#8220;Gnostics&#8221; against whose views on Matter the great coryph&aelig;us of Later Platonism wrote one of the books of his <i>Enneads</i> (II. ix.), there is mention of Nikotheos in close connection with Zoroaster and others (S. 603 ff.). If we now turn to Schmidt&#146;s <i>Plotins Stellung zum Gnosticismus und kirchlichen Christentum</i> (Leipzig, 1900), in which he has examined at length the matter of the treatise of Plotinus and the passage of Porphyry, we find him returning to the consideration of Nikotheos (pp. 58 ff.). Schmidt (p. 61) takes the &#8220;hidden Nikotheos&#8221; for a &#8220;heavenly being,&#8221; indeed as identical with the Alone-begotten, and as, therefore, the revealer of Himself. This Alone-begotten is the &#8220;Light-Darkness&#8221; of p. 13a of the &#8220;Untitled Apocalypse&#8221; of <i>C. B</i>. In other words, Nikotheos seems to be a synonym of the Triumphant Christos. See R. Liechtenhan, <i>Die Offenbarung in Gnosticismus</i> (Gottingen, 1901), p. 31. So far for the inner meaning; but is there possibly an outer one? As there was an apocalypse, for the words of Nikotheos are quoted, there was a seer, a prophet, a Christos, who had seen and handed on. It is somewhat remarkable that one of the by-names given to Jesus (Jeschu) by Rabbinical theological controversy was Balaam (Bileam), meaning &#8220;Destroyer of the people.&#8221; Is there, then, any connection between Niko-theos on the one hand and Niko-laos (the Greek equivalent of Balaam) on the other? There are, at any rate, many other parallels in the Talmud Jeschu-Stories of names of dishonour on the Rabbinical side equating with names of exalted honour on the Gnostic and Christian side. If so&#8212;dare we ask the question?&#8212;have we in the <i>logos</i> of Nikotheos a fragment from an &#8220;Apocalypse of Jesus&#8221;?</p>
<p>Nay, may not Balaam-Niko-laos,&#8212;to take a lesson from the mystic word-play of the time,&#8212;&#8220;allegorically&#8221; have symbolized on the one hand the &#8220;victory of the many&#8221; (&#955;&#945;&#972;&#962;), and on the other the &#8220;Victor of the many,&#8221; for &#8220;people&#8221; in Philo signifies the &#8220;many&#8221; as opposed to the &#8220;one&#146;&#146; &#8220;race&#8221; (&#947;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#962;) which sums up all His &#8220;limbs&#8221; in the Christ?</P>
