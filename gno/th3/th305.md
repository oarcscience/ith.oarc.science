#### EXCERPT IV.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[GOD, NATURE AND THE GODS\]

<span class="small">(Patrizzi (p. 51b) gives no title; but simply the
heading “In Another \[Book\].”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xxxv. 11, under the heading:
“Of Hermes”; G. pp. 295, 296; M. i. 206; W. i. 293.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. iv. of “Fragments Divers,” p.
274).</span>

1\. \[*Her*.\] There is, then, That which transcends being, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72)—beyond all things existent, and all that
really are.

For That-transcending-being is \[that mystery\] because of which exists
that being-ness <span id="fr_73"></span>[2](#fn_73) which is called
universal, common unto intelligibles that really are, and to those
beings which are thought of according to the law of sameness.

Those which are contrary to these, according to the law of otherness,
are again themselves according to themselves. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[3](#fn_74)

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

And Nature is an essence which the senses can perceive, containing in
itself all sensibles.

2\. Between these <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75) are the
intelligible <span id="fr_76"></span>[2](#fn_76) and the sensible gods.

Things that pertain to the intelligence, share in \[the nature of\] the
Gods that are intelligible only; while things pertaining to opinion,
have their part with those that are the sensible.

These latter are the images of the intelligences <span
id="fr_77"></span>[3](#fn_77); the Sun, for instance, is the image of
the Demiurgic God above the Heaven.

For just as He hath made the universe, so doth Sun make the animals, and
generate the plants, and regulate the breaths. <span
id="fr_78"></span>[4](#fn_78)

#### COMMENT

I have supplied the title for the sake of uniformity. If we compare our
extract with Ex. vii, and especially the last sentence of the former
with the first sentence of § 2 of the latter, and note that in Stobæus
the one excerpt follows almost immediately on the other, we shall be
fairly well persuaded that they both come from the same
collection—namely, the Sermons to Tat.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_72"></span>[24:1](th305.htm#fr_72) Or the pre-existent; τὸ
πρὸ ὄν, or τὸ προόν.

<span id="fn_73"></span>[24:2](th305.htm#fr_73) οὐσιότης; or
essentiality.

<span id="fn_74"></span>[24:3](th305.htm#fr_74) This seems to refer to
the seven spheres of difference or otherness (κατὰ τὸ ἕτερον) moving
symbolically against, or “crosswise with,” the all-embracing sphere of
sameness (καθ᾽ ἑαυτό); or it may mean that they have a sameness in the
fact that their motions enter into themselves “again.”

<span id="fn_75"></span>[25:1](th305.htm#fr_75) Presumably God and
Nature.

<span id="fn_76"></span>[25:2](th305.htm#fr_76) νοηματικοί,—a very rare
form, and may possibly mean perceptible.

<span id="fn_77"></span>[25:3](th305.htm#fr_77) νοημάτων.

<span id="fn_78"></span>[25:4](th305.htm#fr_78) Or spirits. The last
clause, “and regulates,” etc., is absent from some MSS., and is,
therefore, considered spurious by some editors; but its unexpectedness
is a strong guarantee of its genuineness. The “spirits” are the
*prāṇa’s* of Hindu physiological psychology; *cf. C*. *H*., x. (xi.) 13,
Comment., and Exs. xv. 2, xix. 3.
