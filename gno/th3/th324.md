#### EXCERPT XXIII.

### FROM “APHRODITE”

<span class="small">(Title in Patrizzi (p. 45) is “The Likeness of
Children,” followed by: “From Aphrodite.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xxxvi. 2, under heading: “Of
Hermes from ‘Aphrodite’”; G. pp. 297, 298; M. i. 207, 208; W. i. 295,
296.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. iii. of “Fragments Divers,”
p. 273.)</span>

\[——\] How, \[then,\] are offspring born like to their parents? Or how
are they returned <span id="fr_286"></span>[1](#fn_286.md) to \[their own\]
species <span id="fr_287"></span>[2](#fn_287.md)?

\[*Aphrodite*.\] I will set forth the reason. When generation stores up
seed from the ripe blood being sweated forth, <span
id="fr_288"></span>[3](#fn_288.md) it comes to pass that somehow there’s
exhaled from the whole mass <span id="fr_289"></span>[4](#fn_289.md) of
limbs a certain essence, following the

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

law of a divine activity, as though the man himself were being born; the
same thing also in the woman’s case apparently takes place.

When, then, what floweth from the man hath the ascendancy, and keeps
intact, the young one’s brought to light resembling its sire; contrary
wise, in the same way, \[resembling\] its dam.

Moreover, if there should be ascendancy of any part, \[then\] the
resemblance \[of the young\] will favour that \[especial\] part.

But sometimes also for long generations the offspring favoureth the
husband’s form, because his decan has the greater influence <span
id="fr_290"></span>[1](#fn_290.md) at that \[particular\] moment when the
wife conceives.

#### COMMENT

This fragment belongs to a type of Hermetic literature of which it is
the sole surviving specimen. It is in form identical with the Isis and
Horus type; but what the name of the questioner of Aphrodite could have
been is difficult to say.
