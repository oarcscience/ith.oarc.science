<p>He wrote books, indeed many [of them], treating of the Gnosis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_541"></A><A HREF="#fn_541"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> of things divine, in which he asserts the greatness of the Highest and One and Only God, and calls Him by the same names as we [do]&#8212;God and Father.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_542"></A><A HREF="#fn_542"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> And [yet], so that no one should seek after His name, he has declared that He cannot be named, in that He doth not need to have a name, owing, indeed, unto the very [nature of His] unity.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_543"></A><A HREF="#fn_543"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> His words are these&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_544"></A><A HREF="#fn_544"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A>:</p>

<p><h5 align="center">THE HISTORICAL ORIGINS OF THE HERMETIC TRADITION</h5></p>
<p>For Lactantius, then, Hermes was very ancient; moreover, he was one who descended from heaven and had returned thither. When, however, Firmianus attempts the historical origins of the Hermetic tradition, as was invariably the case with the ancients, he can do nothing better than refer us to a complex though</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

<p><a name="page_234"><font size="1" color="green">p. 234</font></A></p>
<p>interesting myth, and to a legend of it devised to flatter the self-esteem of its Hellenic creators: A Greek god, whose cult, moreover, was known to be intimately connected with an ancient mystery-tradition, was the originator of the wisdom of Egypt. Of course; and so with all nations who had any ancient learning&#8212;their special tradition was oldest and best and originator of all others!</p>
<p>For the rest, Lactantius knows nothing historically of the tradition which he esteemed so highly, and the mention of the Latinized name Thoyth&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_545"></A><A HREF="#fn_545"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> and of Hermopolis&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_546"></A><A HREF="#fn_546"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> does but throw the paucity of his knowledge into deeper relief. What Lactantius does know is a large literature in Greek and its general tendency.</p>
<p>The sentence he quotes is not found textually in any of the extant Trismegistic literature.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_547"></A><A HREF="#fn_547"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p><h5 align="center">URANUS, CRONUS AND HERMES, ADEPTS OF THE PERFECT SCIENCE</h5></p>
<p>And so it appears that he [Cronus] was not born from Heaven (which is impossible), but from that man who was called Uranus; and that this is so, Trismegistus bears witness, when, in stating that there have been very few in whom the perfect science has been found,</p>

<p><h5 align="center">ON MORTAL AND IMMORTAL SIGHT</h5></p>
<p>His [God&#146;s] works are seen by the eyes; but how He made them, is not seen even by the mind, &#8220;in that,&#8221; as Hermes says:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT III.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>Mortal cannot draw nigh&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_550"></A><A HREF="#fn_550"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> to the Immortal, nor temporal to the Eternal, nor the corruptible to That which knoweth no corruption.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_551"></A><A HREF="#fn_551"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>And, therefore, hath the earthly animal not yet capacity to see celestial things, in that it is kept shut within the body as in a prison house, lest with freed sense, emancipate, it should see all.</blockquote></p>

<p><a name="page_236"><font size="1" color="green">p. 236</font></A></p>
<p>The first part of this citation (which Lactantius gives in Latin) is identical in idea with a sentence in Frag. iv.&#8212;that favourite source of quotation, which Stob&aelig;us, Ex. ii. (<i>Flor</i>. lxxx. [lxxviii.] 9), excerpted from &#8220;The [Sermon] to Tat.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_552"></A><A HREF="#fn_552"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> It might, then, be thought that this was simply a paraphrase of Lactantius&#146;, or that he was quoting from memory, and that the second sentence was not quotation but his own writing. But the second sentence is so thoroughly Trismegistic that it has every appearance of being genuine.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_553"></A><A HREF="#fn_553"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><h5 align="center">MAN MADE AFTER THE IMAGE OF GOD</h5></p>
<p>But the making of the truly living man out of clay&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_554"></A><A HREF="#fn_554"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> is of God. And Hermes also hands on the tradition of this fact,&#8212;for not only has he said that man was made by God after the Image of God,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_555"></A><A HREF="#fn_555"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> but also he has attempted to explain with what skilfulness He has formed every single member in the body of man, since there is not one of them which is not admirably suited not only for what it has to do, but also adapted for beauty.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_556"></A><A HREF="#fn_556"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>Man made after the Image of God is one of the fundamental doctrines of the Trismegistic tradition. For instance, <i>P. S. A.</i>, vii. 2: &#8220;The [man] &#145;essential,&#146; as say the Greeks, but which we call the &#145;form of the</p>

<p><h5 align="center">HERMES THE FIRST NATURAL PHILOSOPHER</h5></p>
<p>Empedocles&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_558"></A><A HREF="#fn_558"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A>&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [and others]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. laid down four elements, fire, air, water, and earth,&#8212;[in this] perchance following Trismegistus, who said that our bodies were composed of these four elements by God.</p>
<p>&#8220;For that they have in them something of fire, something of air, something of water, and something of earth,&#8212;and yet they are not fire [in itself], nor air, nor water, nor earth.&#8221;</p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>All this about the elements is, of course, a commonplace of ancient physics, and we may, therefore, dismiss the na&iuml;ve speculation of Lactantius, who evidently thought he had the very words of the first inventor of the theory before him; for he renders into Latin word for word the same text which Stob&aelig;us has preserved to us in an excerpt from &#8220;The [Sermons] to Tat&#8221;&#8212;Ex. iii. I.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_559"></A><A HREF="#fn_559"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></p>

<p><h5 align="center">THE DAIMON-CHIEF</h5></p>
<p>Thus there are two classes of daimons,&#8212;the one celestial, and the other terrestrial. The latter are impure spirits, the authors of the evils that are done,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_560"></A><A HREF="#fn_560"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p><h5 align="center">DEVOTION IS GOD-GNOSIS</h5></p>
<p>In fine, Hermes asserts that those who have known God, not only are safe from the attacks of evil daimons, but also that they are not held even by Fate.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_562"></A><A HREF="#fn_562"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> He says:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT IV.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>The one means of protection is piety. For neither doth an evil daimon nor doth Fate rule o&#146;er the pious man.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_563"></A><A HREF="#fn_563"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> For God doth save the pious [man] from every ill. The one and only good found in mankind is piety.</blockquote></p>
<p>And what piety means, he witnesses in another place, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Devotion is God-Gnosis.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_564"></A><A HREF="#fn_564"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>
<p>Asclepius, his Hearer, has also explained the same idea at greater length in that &#8220;Perfect Sermon&#8221; which he wrote to the King.</p>
<p>Both, then, assert that the daimons are the enemies and harriers of men, and for this cause Trismegistus</p>
<p>

<p>

<p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></A></p>
<p>calls them &#8220;evil &#145;angels&#146;,&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_565"></A><A HREF="#fn_565"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;so far was he from being ignorant that from celestial beings they had become corrupted, and so earthly.</p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>This passage is given in Greek, and is quoted, but with numerous glosses, also by Cyril (<i>Contra Julianum</i>, iv. 130); it is also practically the same as the sentence in <i>P. S. A.</i>, xxix.: &#8220;The righteous man finds his defence in serving God and deepest piety. For God doth guard such men from every ill.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now we know that Lactantius had the Greek of this &#8220;Perfect Sermon&#8221; before him, and we know that our Latin translation is highly rhetorical and paraphrastic.</p>
<p>The only difficulty is that Lactantius&#146; quotation ends with the sentence: &#8220;The one and only good found in mankind is piety&#8221;; and this does not appear in the Latin translation of <i>P. S. A</i>. On the other hand, Firmianus immediately refers by name to a Perfect Sermon, which, however, he says was written by Asclepius, and addressed to the King. Our Fragment is, therefore, probably from the lost ending of <i>C. H</i>., xvi. (see Commentary on the title).</p>

<p><h5 align="center">THE COSMIC SON OF GOD</h5></p>
<p>Hermes, in that book which is entitled the &#8220;Perfect Sermon,&#8221; uses these words:</p>
<p align="center"><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT V.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>The Lord and Master of all things (whom &#146;tis our custom to call God), when He had made the</blockquote></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_240"><font size="1" color="green">p. 240</font></A></p>
<p><blockquote>second God, the Visible and Sensible,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_566"></A><A HREF="#fn_566"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A>&#8212;I call Him sensible, not that He hath sensation in Himself (for as to this, whether or no He hath Himself sensation, we will some other time enquire), but that He is object of senses and of mind,&#8212;when, then, He&#146;d made Him First, and One and Only,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_567"></A><A HREF="#fn_567"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> He seemed to Him most fair, and filled quite full of all things good. At Him he marvelled, and loved Him altogether as His Son.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_568"></A><A HREF="#fn_568"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A></blockquote></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>Lactantius here quotes from the lost Greek original of &#8220;The Perfect Sermon,&#8221; viii. 1. We have thus a means of controlling the old Latin translation which has come down to us.</p>
<p>It is, by comparison, very free and often rhetorical; inserting phrases and even changing the original, as, for instance, when in the last clause it says: &#8220;He fell in love with him as being part of His Divinity.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is, however, possible that the translator may have had a different text before him, for there is reason to believe that there were several recensions of the <i>P. S. A</i>.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_569"></A><A HREF="#fn_569"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A></p>

<p>Trismegistus, who has tracked out, I know not how, almost all truth, has often described the power and greatness of the Word (<i>Logos</i>), as the above quotation&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_577"></A><A HREF="#fn_577"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> from him shows, in which he confesses the Word to be Ineffable and Holy, and in that its telling forth transcends the power of man.</p>

<p>Here Lactantius translates literally from <i>C. H.</i>, xii.

<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT VIII.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>Nay, nay; speak more propitiously, O [my] Asclepius! For very great impiety is it to let come in the mind any such thought about that One and Only Good.</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>These things, and things like these, are not appropriate to Him. For He is full of all things that exist and least of all stands He in need [of aught].</blockquote></p>
<p><blockquote>But let us worship pouring forth our thanks. The [worthiest] sacrifice to Him is blessing, [and blessing] only.</blockquote></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>With this compare the passage in <i>P. S. A.</i>, xli. 2 (p. 61, 16, Goldb.). Here again we have the means of controlling the old Latin translator, but not with such exactitude as before, for Lactantius has also turned the Greek text into Latin. But not only from the other specimens of Lactantius&#146; Hermes translations, but also from his present close reproduction of the ordinary wording of the Trismegistic treatises, we may be further confident that the Old Latin translation is free, paraphrastic, and rhetorical, as we have already remarked.</p>

<p><h5 align="center">THE DUAL NATURE OF MAN</h5></p>
<p>Hermes, in describing the nature of man, in order that he might teach how he was made by God, brings forward the following:</p>
<p><h4 align="center">FRAGMENT IX.</h4></p>
<p><blockquote>From the two natures, the deathless and mortal, He made one nature,&#8212;that of man,&#8212;one and the self-same thing; and having made the self-same [man] both somehow deathless and somehow mortal, He brought him forth, and set him up betwixt&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_586"></A><A HREF="#fn_586"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> the godlike and immortal</blockquote></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><a name="page_246"><font size="1" color="green">p. 246</font></A></p>
<p><blockquote>nature and the mortal, that seeing all he might wonder at all.</blockquote></p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p><h5 align="center">WONDER THE BEGINNING OF PHILOSOPHY</h5></p>
<p>This idea of &#8220;wondering&#8221; was, doubtless, a commonplace in Hellenistic philosophical circles and looked back to the Platonic saying: &#8220;There is no other beginning of Philosophy than wondering.&#8221; Compare also one of the newest found &#8220;Logoi of Jesus,&#8221; from the rubbish heaps of Oxyrhynchus, which runs: &#8220;Let not him that seeketh&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cease until he find, and when he finds he shall wonder; wondering he shall reign, and reigning he shall rest.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_587"></A><A HREF="#fn_587"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>Wondering is the beginning of Gnosis; this makes a man king of himself, and thus master of gods and men, and so he has peace. The translation of &#946;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#955;&#949;&#973;&#963;&#949;&#953; by Grenfell and Hunt as &#8220;reach the kingdom&#8221; seems to me to have no justification.</p>
<p>Lactantius here quotes the Greek text of <i>P. S. A.</i>, viii. 3, and so once again we can control the Old Latin version. The Church Father is plainly the more reliable, reproducing as he does familiar Hermetic phrasing and style; and we thus again have an insight into the methods of our rhetorical, truncated, and interpolated Latin Version.</p>

<p><h5 align="center">OF HERMES AND HIS DOCTRINE CONCERNING GOD</h5></p>
<p>Hermes,&#8212;who, on account of his virtue and knowledge of many arts, gained the title of Thrice-greatest, who also in the antiquity of his doctrine preceded the philosophers, and who is worshipped as god among the Egyptians,&#8212;declaring the greatness of the One and Only God with unending praises, calls Him God and Father, [and says] He has no name, for that He has no need for a distinctive name,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_591"></A><A HREF="#fn_591"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> inasmuch as He alone is,</p>

<p>In writing to his son [Tat] he begins as follows:</p>

<p>Finally Plato has spoken concerning the first and second God, not plainly as a philosopher, but as a prophet, perchance in this following Trismegistus, whose words I have added in translation from the Greek.</p>

Like Hercules, he was of superhuman strength, and many similar exploits of his powers are recorded. In the Io-legends, Hera made Argos guardian of the cow into which the favourite of Zeus had been metamorphosed. Zeus accordingly sent Hermes to carry off his beloved. Hermes is said to have lulled Argos to sleep by means of his syrinx, or pipe of seven reeds, or by his caduceus, and then to have stoned him or cut off his head. See Reseller&#146;s <i>Ausf&uuml;hr. Lex. d. griech. u. r&ouml;m. Myth</i>., <i>s.v</i>. &#8220;Argos.&#8221; It is to be noticed that instead of Argum, four MSS. read <i>argentum</i>, which is curious as showing a Medieval Alchemical influence.

<P><A NAME="fn_540"></A><A HREF="th337.htm#fr_540">232:2</A> <i>Pheneat&aelig;</i>,&#8212;Phen&euml;us was a town in Arcadia, that country of ancient mysteries. (It is remarkable that Hermas is taken by the &#8220;Shepherd&#8221; in spirit to a mountain in Arcadia. See <i>Shepherd of Hermas</i>, Sim. ix. 1.) Cicero begins his description of the fifth Hermes with this statement, and Lactantius has thus awkwardly misplaced it. Pausanias (viii. 14, 6) tells us that Phen&euml;us itself was considered as a very ancient city, and that its chief cult was that of Hermes. This cult of Hermes, moreover, was blended with an ancient mystery-tradition, for Pausanias (<i>ibid</i>., 15, 1) tells us that:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pheneatians have also a sanctuary of Demeter sumamed Eleusinian, and they celebrate mysteries in her honour, alleging that rites identical with those performed at Eleusis were instituted in their land.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Beside the sanctuary of the Eleusinian goddess is what is called the Petroma, two great stones fitted to each other. Every second year, when they are celebrating what they call the Greater Mysteries, they open these stones, and taking out of them certain writings which bear on the mysteries, they read them in the hearing of the initiated, and put them back in their place that same night. I know, too, that on the weightiest matters most of the Pheneatians swear by the Petroma.&#8221; Frazer&#146;s Translation, i. 393 (London, 1898).</P>
