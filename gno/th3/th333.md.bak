### CLEMENT OF ALEXANDRIA <span id="fr_511"></span>[1](#fn_511.md)

<span class="small">i. *Protrepticus*, ii. 29; Dindorf (G.), i. 29,
(Oxford, 1869)—(24 P., 8 S.).</span>

##### MANY HERMESES AND ASCLEPIUSES

(<span class="smallcaps">After</span> referring to the three Zeuses,
five Athenas, and numberless Apollos of complex popular tradition,
Clement continues:)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But what were I to mention the many Asclepiuses, or the Hermeses that
are reckoned up, or the Hephæstuses of mythology?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Clement lived in the very centre of Hellenistic theology, and his
grouping together of the names of Asclepius, Hermes and Hephæstus, the
demiurgic Ptah, whose tradition was incorporated into the Pœmandres
doctrine, is therefore not fortuitous, but shows that these three names
were closely associated in his mind, and that, therefore, he was
acquainted with the Trismegistic literature. This deduction is confirmed
by the following passage.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

<span class="small">ii. *Stromateis*, I. xxi. 134; Dindorf, ii. 108 (399
P., 144 S.).</span>

##### THE APOTHEOSIS OF HERMES AND ASCLEPIUS

Of those, too, who once lived as men among the Egyptians, but who have
been made gods by human opinion, \[are\] Hermes of Thebes and Asclepius
of Memphis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(To this we may appropriately append what Clement has to tell us about
the “Books of Hermes,” when, writing in the last quarter of the second
century, he describes one of the sacred processions of the Egyptians as
follows:)

<span class="small">iii. *Ibid.*, VI. iv. 35; Dind., iii. 156,
157.</span>

##### THE BOOKS OF HERMES

First comes the “Singer” bearing some one of the symbols of music. This
\[priest\], they tell us, has to make himself master of two of the
“Books of Hermes,” one of which contains (1) Hymns \[in honour\] of the
Gods, <span id="fr_512"></span>[1](#fn_512) and the other (2.md)
Reflections <span id="fr_513"></span>[2](#fn_513.md) on the Kingly Life.

After the “Singer” comes the “Time-watcher” bearing the symbols of the
star-science, a dial after a hand and phœnix. He must have the division
of the “Books of Hermes” which treats of the stars ever at the tip of
his tongue—there being four of such books. The first of these deals with
(3) the Ordering of the

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

apparently Fixed Stars, <span id="fr_514"></span>[1](#fn_514.md) the next
\[two\] (4 and 5) with the conjunctions and variations of Light of the
Sun and Moon, and the last (6) with the Risings \[of the Stars\].

Next comes the “Scribe of the Mysteries,” with wings on his head, having
in either hand a book and a ruler <span id="fr_515"></span>[2](#fn_515.md)
in which is the ink and reed pen with which they write. He has to know
what they call the sacred characters, and the books about (7)
Cosmography, and (8) Geography, (9) the Constitution of the Sun and
Moon, and (10) of the Five Planets, (11) the Survey of Egypt, and (12)
the Chart of the Nile, (13) the List of the Appurtenances of the Temples
and (14) of the Lands consecrated to them, (15) the Measures, and (16)
Things used in the Sacred Rites.

After the above-mentioned comes the “Overseer <span
id="fr_516"></span>[3](#fn_516.md) of the Ceremonies,” bearing the cubit of
justice and the libation cup \[as his symbols\]. He must know all the
books relating to the training \[of the conductors of the public cult\],
and those that they call the victim-sealing <span
id="fr_517"></span>[4](#fn_517.md)

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

books. There are ten of these books which deal with the worship which
they pay to the gods, and in which the Egyptian cult is contained;
namely \[those which treat\] of (17) Sacrifice, (18) First-fruits, (19)
Hymns, (20) Prayers, (21) Processions, (22) Feasts, and (23-26) the
like.

After all of these comes the “Prophet” clasping to his breast the
water-vase so that all can see it; and after him follow those who carry
the bread that is to be distributed. <span
id="fr_518"></span>[1](#fn_518.md) The “Prophet” as chief of the temple,
learns by heart the ten books which are called “hieratic”; these contain
the volumes (27-36) treating of the Laws, and the Gods, and the whole
Discipline of the Priests. For you must know that the “Prophet” among
the Egyptians is also the supervisor of the distribution of the
\[temple\] revenues.

Now the books which are absolutely indispensable <span
id="fr_519"></span>[2](#fn_519.md)

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

for Hermes <span id="fr_520"></span>[1](#fn_520.md) are forty-two in
number. Six-and-thirty of them, which contain the whole
wisdom-discipline <span id="fr_521"></span>[2](#fn_521.md) of the
Egyptians, are learned by heart by the \[grades of priests\] already
mentioned. The remaining six are learned by the “Shrine-bearers” <span
id="fr_522"></span>[3](#fn_522.md); these are medical treatises dealing
with (37) the Constitution of the Body, with (38) Diseases, (39)
Instruments, (40) Drugs, (41) Eyes, <span
id="fr_523"></span>[4](#fn_523) and finally (42.md) with the Maladies of
Women.

##### THE GENERAL CATALOGUE OF THE EGYPTIAN PRIESTLY LIBRARY

This exceedingly interesting passage of Clement gives us the general
catalogue of the Egyptian priestly library and the background of the
Greek translations and adaptations in our Trismegistic writings.

The whole of these writings fall into this frame, and the oldest deposit
or “Pœmandres” type fits in excellently with the content of the hieratic
books (the titles of which Clement has unfortunately omitted), or with
those that were kept secret. These hieratic books were evidently the
more important and were in charge of the “Prophet,” that is to say, of
those high priests of the temples who were directors of the prophetic
discipline, the very subject of our “Pœmandres” treatises. <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_511"></span>[221:1](th333.htm#fr_511.md) *Fl*., 175-200 A.D.

<span id="fn_512"></span>[222:1](th333.htm#fr_512.md) I have numbered the
books and used capitals for greater clearness.

<span id="fn_513"></span>[222:2](th333.htm#fr_513.md) ἐκλογισμόν; I do not
know what this term means in this connection. The usual translation of
“Regulations” seems to me unsatisfactory. Some word such as “Praise” (?
read εὐλογισμόν) seems to be required, as may be seen from the title of
*C. H.*, (xviii.), “The Encomium of Kings.”

<span id="fn_514"></span>[223:1](th333.htm#fr_514.md) τῶν ἀπλανῶν
φαινομένων ἄστρων.

<span id="fn_515"></span>[223:2](th333.htm#fr_515.md) κανόνα.; this must
mean a hollow wooden case shaped like a ruler.

<span id="fn_516"></span>[223:3](th333.htm#fr_516.md) στολιστής, called
also ἱερόστολος. This priestly office is usually translated as the
“keeper of the vestments,” the “one who is over the wardrobe.” But such
a meaning is entirely foreign to the contents of the books which are
assigned to him. He was evidently the organiser of the ceremonies,
especially the processions.

<span id="fn_517"></span>[223:4](th333.htm#fr_517.md) μοσχοσφραγιστικά—that
is to say, literally, books relating to the art of one who picks out and
“seals calves” for sacrifice. The literal meaning originally referred to
the selection of the sacred Apis bull-calf, into which the power of the
god was supposed to have re-incarnated, in the relic of some primitive
magic rite which the conservatism of the Egyptians still retained in the
public cult. Its meaning, however, was later on far more general, as we
see by the nature of the books assigned to this division. Boulage, in
his *Mystères d’Isis* (Paris, 1820, p. 21), says that “the seal of the
priests which marked the victims was a man kneeling with his hands bound
behind his back, and a sword pointed at his throat, for it was in this
attitude that the neophyte received the first initiation, signifying
that he agreed to perish by the sword if he revealed any of the secrets
revealed to him.” This he evidently deduced from Plutarch’s *De Is. et
Os*., xxxi. 3.

<span id="fn_518"></span>[224:1](th333.htm#fr_518.md) οἱ τὴν ἔκπεμψιν τῶν
ἄρτων βαστάζοντες. The “Prophet” belonged to the grade of high priests
who had practical knowledge of the inner way. As the flood of the Nile
came down and irrigated the fields and brought forth the grain for
bread, and so gave food to Egypt, so did the living stream of the Gnosis
from the infinite heights of space pour into the Hierophant, and he in
his turn became Father Nile for the priests, his disciples, who in their
turn distributed the bread of knowledge to the people. A pleasing
symbolism, of which the bread and water of the earlier ascetic schools
of Christendom, who rejected wine, was perhaps a reminiscence. Nor has
even the General Church in its older forms forgotten to sprinkle the
people from the water-vase and distribute among them the bread.

<span id="fn_519"></span>[224:2](th333.htm#fr_519.md) This seems to suggest
that there were others, the knowledge of which was optional, or rather
reserved for the few. There may perhaps have been forty-nine in all.

<span id="fn_520"></span>[225:1](th333.htm#fr_520.md) That is, the
priesthood.

<span id="fn_521"></span>[225:2](th333.htm#fr_521.md) Lit. philosophy.

<span id="fn_522"></span>[225:3](th333.htm#fr_522.md) παστοφόροι, those who
carried the *pastos* as a symbol; this apparently symbolized the shrine
or casket of the soul; in other words, the human body. These Pastophors
were the priests who were the physicians of the body, the higher grades
being presumably physicians of the soul.

<span id="fn_523"></span>[225:4](th333.htm#fr_523.md) This seems to be an
error of the copyist.

<span id="fn_524"></span>[225:5](th333.htm#fr_524.md) As to the
hieroglyphic inscription at Edfu, which was thought by Jomasd to contain
references to the titles of these forty-two books, see Parthey, *Über
Isis und Osiris*, p. 255.
