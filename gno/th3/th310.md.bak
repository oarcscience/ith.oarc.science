#### EXCERPT IX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### OF \[THE DECANS AND\] THE STARS

<span class="small">(Patrizzi (p. 38b) does not give the first third of
the text (§§ 1-5), and his title, “Of the Stars,” is evidently
incomplete; it is followed by “To the Same \[*i.e.* Tat\].”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xxi. 9, under the heading: “Of
Hermes from the \[Sermon\] to Tat,” pp. 184-190; M. i. 129-133; W. i.
189-194.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. vi. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” pp. 242-247, under the sub-heading, “Of
the Decans and the Stars.”)</span>

1\. *Tat*. Since in thy former General Sermons (*Logoi* <span
id="fr_121"></span>[1](#fn_121).md), \[father,\] thou didst promise me an
explanation of the Six-and-thirty Decans, <span
id="fr_122"></span>[2](#fn_122.md) explain, I prithee, now concerning them
and their activity. <span id="fr_123"></span>[3](#fn_123.md)

*Her*. There’s not the slightest wish in me not to do so, O Tat, and
this should prove the

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

most authoritative sermon (*logos*) and the chiefest of them all. So
ponder on it well.

We have already spoken unto thee about the Circle of the Animals, or the
Life-giving one, <span id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md) of the Five
Planets, and of Sun and Moon, and of the Circle <span
id="fr_125"></span>[2](#fn_125.md) of each one of these.

2\. *Tat*. Thou hast done so, Thrice-greatest one.

*Her*. Thus would I have thee understand as well about the
Six-and-thirty Decans,—calling the former things to mind, in order that
the sermon on the latter may also be well understood by thee.

*Tat*. I have recalled them, father, \[to my mind\].

*Her*. We said, \[my\] son, there is a Body which encompasses all
things.

Conceive it, then, as being in itself a kind of figure of a sphere-like
shape; so is the universe conformed.

*Tat*. I’ve thought of such a figure in my mind, just as thou dost
describe, O father \[mine\].

3\. *Her*. Beneath the Circle of this \[all-embracing\] frame <span
id="fr_126"></span>[3](#fn_126.md) are ranged the Six-and-thirty Decans,
between this Circle of the Universe and that one of the Animals,
determining the boundaries of both these Circles, and, as it were,

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

holding that of the Animals aloft up in the air, and \[so\] defining it.

They <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) share the motion of the
Planetary Spheres, and \[yet\] have equal powers with the \[main\]
motion of the Whole, <span id="fr_128"></span>[2](#fn_128.md)
crosswise <span id="fr_129"></span>[3](#fn_129.md) the Seven.

They’re <span id="fr_130"></span>[4](#fn_130.md) checked by nothing but the
All-encircling Body, for this must be the final thing in the \[whole
grades of\] motion,—itself by its own self.

But they speed on the Seven other Circles, because they <span
id="fr_131"></span>[5](#fn_131.md) move with a less rapid motion than the
\[Circle\] of the All.

Let us, then, think of them as though of Watchers stationed round \[and
watching\] over both the Seven themselves and o’er the Circle of the
All,—or rather over all things in the World,

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —holding together
all, and keeping the good order of all things.

4\. *Tat*. Thus do I have it, father, in my mind, from what thou say’st.

*Her*. Moreover, Tat, thou should’st have in thy mind that they are also
free from the necessities laid on the other Stars.

They are not checked and settled in their course, nor are they
\[further\] hindered and made to tread in their own steps again <span
id="fr_132"></span>[1](#fn_132.md); nor are they kept away from <span
id="fr_133"></span>[2](#fn_133.md) the Sun’s light,—\[all of\] which things
the other Stars endure.

But free, above them all, as though they were inerrant Guards and
Overseers of the whole, they night and day surround the universe.

5\. *Tat*. Do these, then, also, further exercise an influence <span
id="fr_134"></span>[3](#fn_134.md) upon us?

*Her*. The greatest, O \[my\] son. For if they act in <span
id="fr_135"></span>[4](#fn_135.md) them, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[5](#fn_136.md) how should they fail to act on us as
well,—both on each one of us and generally? <span
id="fr_137"></span>[6](#fn_137.md)

Thus, O \[my\] son, of all those things that happen generally, the
bringing into action <span id="fr_138"></span>[7](#fn_138.md) is from
these <span id="fr_139"></span>[8](#fn_139.md); as for example,—and ponder
what I say,—downfalls of kingdoms, states’ rebellions,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

plagues \[and\] famines, tidal waves \[and\] quakings of the earth; no
one of these, O son, takes place without their action. <span
id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md)

Nay, further still, bear this in mind. If they rule over them, and we
are in our turn beneath the Seven, dost thou not think that some of
their activity extends to us as well,—\[who are\] assuredly their sons,
or \[come into existence\] by their means?

6\. *Tat*. What, \[then,\] may be the type <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141.md) of body that they have, O father
\[mine\]?

*Her*. The many call them daimones; but they are not some special class
of daimones, for they have not some other kind of bodies made of some
special kind of matter, nor are they moved by means of soul, as we \[are
moved\], but they are \[simple\] operations <span
id="fr_142"></span>[3](#fn_142.md) of these Six-and-thirty Gods.

Nay, further, still, have in thy mind, O Tat, their operations,—that
they cast in the earth the seed of those whom \[men\] call Tanĕs, some
playing the part of saviours, others being most destructive. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[4](#fn_143.md)

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

7\. Further the Stars <span id="fr_144"></span>[1](#fn_144.md) in heaven as
well do in their several \[courses\] bear them <span
id="fr_145"></span>[2](#fn_145.md) underworkers <span
id="fr_146"></span>[3](#fn_146.md); and they <span
id="fr_147"></span>[4](#fn_147.md) have ministers and warriors <span
id="fr_148"></span>[5](#fn_148.md) too.

And they <span id="fr_149"></span>[6](#fn_149.md) in \[everlasting\]
congress with them <span id="fr_150"></span>[7](#fn_150.md) speed on their
course in æther floating, fullfilling \[all\] its <span
id="fr_151"></span>[8](#fn_151.md) space, so that there is no space above
empty of stars.

They are the cosmic engine of the universe, <span
id="fr_152"></span>[9](#fn_152.md) having their own peculiar action, which
is subordinate, however, to the action of the Thirty-six,—from whom
throughout \[all\] lands arise the deaths of \[all\] the other
lives <span id="fr_153"></span>[10](#fn_153.md) with souls, and hosts of
\[lesser\] lives that spoil the fruit.

8\. And under them <span id="fr_154"></span>[11](#fn_154.md) is what is
called the

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Bear, <span
id="fr_155"></span>[1](#fn_155.md)—just in the middle of the Circle of the
Animals, <span id="fr_156"></span>[2](#fn_156.md) composed of seven stars,
and with another corresponding \[Bear\] <span
id="fr_157"></span>[3](#fn_157.md) above its head.

Its energy is as it were an axle’s, setting nowhere and nowhere rising,
but stopping \[ever\] in the self-same space, and turning round the
same, giving its proper motion <span id="fr_158"></span>[4](#fn_158.md) to
the Life-producing Circle, <span id="fr_159"></span>[5](#fn_159.md) and
handing over this whole universe from night to day, from day to night.

And after this <span id="fr_160"></span>[6](#fn_160.md) there is another
choir of stars, to which we have not thought it proper to give names;
but they who will come after us, <span id="fr_161"></span>[7](#fn_161.md)
in imitation, will give them names themselves. <span
id="fr_162"></span>[8](#fn_162.md)

9\. Again, below the Moon, are other stars, <span
id="fr_163"></span>[9](#fn_163.md) corruptible, deprived of energy, which
hold together for a little while, in that they’ve been exhaled out of
the earth itself into the air above the earth,—which ever are being
broken up, in that they have a nature like unto \[that of\] useless
lives on earth, which come into existence for no other purpose than to
die,—such as the tribe of flies, and fleas, and worms, and other things
like them.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

For these are useful, Tat, neither to us nor to the world; but, on the
contrary, they trouble and annoy, being nature’s by-products, <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) which owe their birth to her
extravagance. <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165.md)

Just in the same way, too, the stars exhaled from earth do not attain
the upper space.

They cannot do so, since they are sent forth from below; and, owing to
the greatness of their weight, dragged down by their own matter, they
quickly are dispersed, and, breaking up, fall back again on earth,
affecting nothing but the mere disturbance of the air about the earth.

10\. There is another class, O Tat, that of the so-called long-haired
\[stars\], <span id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_166.md) appearing at their
proper times, and after a short time, becoming once again
invisible;—they neither rise nor set nor are they broken up.

These are the brilliant messengers and heralds of the general destinies
of things <span id="fr_167"></span>[4](#fn_167.md) that are to be.

They occupy the space below the Circle of the Sun.

When, then, some chance is going to happen to the world, \[comets\]
appear, and, shining for some days, again return behind <span
id="fr_168"></span>[5](#fn_168.md) the Circle of the Sun, and stay
invisible,—some showing in

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

the east, some in the north, some in the west, and others in the south.
We call them Prophets. <span id="fr_169"></span>[1](#fn_169.md)

11\. Such is the nature of the stars. The stars, however, differ from
the star-groups. <span id="fr_170"></span>[2](#fn_170.md)

The stars are they which sail <span id="fr_171"></span>[3](#fn_171.md) in
heaven; the star-groups, on the contrary, are fixed in heaven’s
frame, <span id="fr_172"></span>[4](#fn_172.md) and they are borne along
together with the heaven,—Twelve out of which we call the Zōdia. <span
id="fr_173"></span>[5](#fn_173.md)

He who knows these can form some notion clearly of \[what\] God is; and,
if one should dare say so, becoming \[thus\] a seer for himself, \[so\]
contemplate Him, and, contemplating Him, be blessed.

12\. *Tat*. Blessèd, in truth, is he, O father \[mine\], who
contemplateth Him.

*Her*. But ’tis impossible, O son, that one in body <span
id="fr_174"></span>[6](#fn_174.md) should have this good chance.

Moreover, he should train his soul beforehand, here and now, that when
it reacheth there, \[the space\] where it is possible for it to
contemplate, it may not miss its way.

But men who love their bodies,—such men will never contemplate the
Vision of the Beautiful and Good.

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

For what, O son, is that \[fair\] Beauty which hath no form nor any
colour, nor any mass? <span id="fr_175"></span>[1](#fn_175.md)

*Tat*. Can there be aught that’s beautiful apart from these?

*Her*. God only, O \[my\] son; or rather that which is still
greater,—the \[proper\] name of God.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### COMMENTARY

The earlier editors of Stobæus (apparently following the mistake of
Patrizzi) have Asclepius instead of Tat as the second person of the
dialogue, which is clearly wrong according to the text itself (see the
first sentence given to Hermes, and §§ 9 and 10). <span
id="fr_176"></span>[2](#fn_176.md)

The excerpt is from a sermon in the Collection to Tat. It belongs to the
further explanation of things referred to only generally in the General
Sermons; it is, therefore, again probably from one of the Expository
Sermons, in which series already a sermon has been given on the Zodiacal
Twelve and on the Seven Spheres.

Seeing also that it is stated that this sermon is “most authoritative
and the chiefest of them all,” we must suppose that it came at the end
of one of the Books of the Expository Sermons.

We seem to have the beginning of the sermon, but not the end, for
Stobæus breaks off in an aimless and provoking fashion in the midst of a
subject.

For a list of the Egyptian names of the Decans, with their Greek
transcriptions and symbols, see Budge, *Gods of the Egyptians*, ii.
304-308.

<span id="fn_129"></span>[47:3](th310.htm#fr_129.md) This refers to the
astronomical system underlying the Pythagoreo-Platonic tradition, as,
for instance, set forth allegorically and symbolically by Plato in the
famous passage in The *Timæus* (36 B, C). “The entire compound he (the
Demiurge) divided lengthways into two parts, which he joined to one
another at the centre like the letter X, and bent them into a circular
form, connecting them with themselves and each other at the point
opposite to their original meeting point; and, comprehending them in a
uniform revolution upon the same axis, he made the one the outer and the
other the inner circle. Now the motion of the outer circle he called the
motion of the same, and the motion of the inner circle the motion of the
other or diverse” (Jowett’s Translation, iii. 454, 455). The X
symbolizes the “crosswise,” which in terms of motion may be translated
as “inverse to.”

concerning the spiritual and other spaces and their inhabitants, “Of

Gnostic Codices.

Neither Patrizzi nor Gaisford, nor Meineke, nor Wachsmuth, nor Ménard,
has a word to say on this most interesting passage. I would suggest in
the first place that the text is faulty, and that we should read “οὓς
καλοῦσι Τάνας, τοὺς μὲν σωτηρίους, τοὺς δὲ ὀλεθριωτάτους”; and in the
second that Τάνας is a shortened form of Τιτᾶνας or Titans. Τάνας (?
from Τᾶν) is connected with ταναός, “stretched out,” from √ταν, just as
Τιτὰν is connected with τιταίνω,—Τιτᾶνες thus signifying the Stretchers
or Strivers. It may, however, also be connected with τίτας (τίτης)—from
τίνω, and so mean Avengers. *Cf.* J. Laurent. Lydus, *De Mensibus*, iv.
31 (W. 90, 24), as given in note to *P. S. A.*, xxviii. 1.
