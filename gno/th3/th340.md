##### HERMES SPEAKS OF THE TRINITY

Hermes the Thrice-greatest.—He was an Egyptian sage, and flourished
before Pharaoh. He was called Thrice-greatest because he spoke of the
Trinity, declaring that in the Trinity there is One Godhead, as follows:

“Before Intellectual Light was Light Intellectual; Mind of mind, too,
was there eternally, Light-giving. There was naught else except the
Oneness of this \[Mind\] and Spirit all-embracing.

“Without this is nor god, nor angel, nor any other being. For He is Lord
and Father, and the God of all; and all things are beneath Him, \[all
things are\] in Him. <span id="fr_657"></span>[2](#fn_657.md)

(The source of Suidas, or of his editor, is manifestly

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cyril, *C. J*., i.
35 (Fragg. xvi., xvii.), of which a very garbled edition is reproduced.
The same statement and passage is also quoted by Cedrenus, John Malalas,
and the author of the *Chronicum Alexandrinum*. See Bernhardy’s edition
of Suidas (Halle, 1853), i. 527, notes.) Suidas then continues without a
break:)

“His Word (*Logos*), all-perfect as he was, and fecund, and creative,
falling in fecund Nature, yea in fecund Water, made Water
pregnant.” <span id="fr_658"></span>[1](#fn_658.md)

After saying this he has the following prayer:

##### AN ORPHIC HYMN

“Thee, Heaven, I adjure, wise work of mighty God; thee I adjure,
Word <span id="fr_659"></span>[2](#fn_659.md) of the Father which He spake
first, when He established all the world!

“Thee I adjure, \[O Heaven\], by the alone-begotten Word (*Logos*)
himself, and by the Father of the Word alone-begotten, yea, by the
Father who surroundeth all,—be gracious, be gracious!”

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is not a prayer from Hermes, but three verses (the last somewhat
altered) of an Orphic hymn excerpted from Cyril, *ibid*., i. 33 (Migne,
col. 552 C),—lines also attributed to “Orpheus” by Justin Martyr. The
last half of the prayer seems to be a pure invention of Suidas, or of
his editor, based partially on Cyril’s comments.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_656"></span>[268:1](th340.htm#fr_656.md) Date uncertain; some
indications point to as late as the twelfth century; if these, however,
are due to later redaction, others point to the tenth century.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[268:2](th340.htm#fr_657.md) He is above them as
Lord and Father, as Mind and Light; and they are in Him as Lady and
Mother, as Spirit and Life.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[269:1](th340.htm#fr_658.md) This is again, and
this time almost verbally, taken from Cyril *ibid*., i. 33; Frag. xii.

<span id="fn_659"></span>[269:2](th340.htm#fr_659.md) φωνήν.
