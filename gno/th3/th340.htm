<p><h5 align="center">HERMES SPEAKS OF THE TRINITY</h5></p>
<p>Hermes the Thrice-greatest.&#8212;He was an Egyptian sage, and flourished before Pharaoh. He was called Thrice-greatest because he spoke of the Trinity, declaring that in the Trinity there is One Godhead, as follows:</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Intellectual Light was Light Intellectual; Mind of mind, too, was there eternally, Light-giving. There was naught else except the Oneness of this [Mind] and Spirit all-embracing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without this is nor god, nor angel, nor any other being. For He is Lord and Father, and the God of all; and all things are beneath Him, [all things are] in Him.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_657"></A><A HREF="#fn_657"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A></p>

<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> Cyril, <i>C. J</i>., i. 35 (Fragg. xvi., xvii.), of which a very garbled edition is reproduced. The same statement and passage is also quoted by Cedrenus, John Malalas, and the author of the <i>Chronicum Alexandrinum</i>. See Bernhardy&#146;s edition of Suidas (Halle, 1853), i. 527, notes.) Suidas then continues without a break:)</p>
<p>&#8220;His Word (<i>Logos</i>), all-perfect as he was, and fecund, and creative, falling in fecund Nature, yea in fecund Water, made Water pregnant.&#8221;&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_658"></A><A HREF="#fn_658"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>After saying this he has the following prayer:</p>
<p><h5 align="center">AN ORPHIC HYMN</h5></p>
<p>&#8220;Thee, Heaven, I adjure, wise work of mighty God; thee I adjure, Word&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_659"></A><A HREF="#fn_659"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> of the Father which He spake first, when He established all the world!</p>
<p>&#8220;Thee I adjure, [O Heaven], by the alone-begotten Word (<i>Logos</i>) himself, and by the Father of the Word alone-begotten, yea, by the Father who surroundeth all,&#8212;be gracious, be gracious!&#8221;</p>
<p><hr> </p>
<p>This is not a prayer from Hermes, but three verses (the last somewhat altered) of an Orphic hymn excerpted from Cyril, <i>ibid</i>., i. 33 (Migne, col. 552 C),&#8212;lines also attributed to &#8220;Orpheus&#8221; by Justin Martyr. The last half of the prayer seems to be a pure invention of Suidas, or of his editor, based partially on Cyril&#146;s comments.</p>
