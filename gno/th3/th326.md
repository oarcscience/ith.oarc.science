1. <span id="fr_298"></span>[3](#fn_298.md) <span
class="smallcaps">So</span> speaking Isis doth pour forth for Horus the
sweet draught (the first) of

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

deathlessness <span id="fr_299"></span>[1](#fn_299.md) which souls have
custom to receive from Gods, and thus begins her holiest discourse
(*logos*):

Seeing that, Son Horus, Heaven, adorned with many a wreath \[of starry
crowns\], is set o’er every nature of \[all\] things beneath, and that
nowhere it lacketh aught of anything which the whole cosmos now doth
hold,—in every way it needs must be that every nature which lies
underneath, should be co-ordered and full-filled by those that lie
above; for things below cannot of course give order to the ordering
above.

It needs must, therefore, be the less should give place to the greater
mysteries. The ordinance of the sublimer things transcends the lower; it
is both sure in every way and falleth ’neath no mortal’s thought.
Wherefore the \[mysteries\] below did sigh, fearing the wondrous beauty
and the everlasting durance of the ones above,

’Twas worth the gazing <span id="fr_300"></span>[2](#fn_300.md) and the
pains to see Heaven’s beauty, beauty that seemed like God,—God who was
yet unknown, and the rich majesty of Night, who weaves her web with
rapid light, <span id="fr_301"></span>[3](#fn_301.md) though it be less
than Sun’s, and of the other mysteries <span
id="fr_302"></span>[4](#fn_302.md) in turn that move in Heaven, with
ordered motions and with periods

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

of times, with certain hidden influences <span
id="fr_303"></span>[1](#fn_303.md) bestowing order on the things below and
co-increasing them.

2\. Thus fear succeeded fear, and searching search incessant, and for so
long as the Creator of the universals willed, did ignorance retain its
grip on all. But when He judged it fit to manifest Him who He is, He
breathed into the Gods the Loves, and freely poured the splendour <span
id="fr_304"></span>[2](#fn_304.md) which He had within His heart, into
their minds, in ever greater and still greater measure; that firstly
they might have the wish to seek, next they might yearn to find, and
finally have power to win success as well. But this, my Horus,
wonder-worthy son, could never have been done had that seed <span
id="fr_305"></span>[3](#fn_305.md) been subject to death, for *that* as yet
had no existence, but only with a soul that could vibrate responsive to
the mysteries of Heaven.

3\. Such was all-knowing Hermes, who saw all things, and seeing
understood, and understanding had the power both to disclose and to give
explanation. For what he knew, he graved on stone; yet though he graved
them onto stone he hid them mostly, keeping sure silence though in
speech, that every younger age of cosmic time

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

might seek for them. And thus, with charge unto his kinsmen of the Gods
to keep sure watch, he mounted to the Stars.

To him succeeded Tat, who was at once his son and heir unto these
knowledges; and not long afterwards Asclepius-Imuth, according to the
will of Ptah who is Hephæstus, <span id="fr_306"></span>[1](#fn_306.md) and
all the rest who were to make enquiry of the faithful certitude of
heavenly contemplation, as Foreknowledge <span
id="fr_307"></span>[2](#fn_307.md) willed, Foreknowledge queen of all.

4\. Hermes, however, made explanation to surrounding \[space\], how that
not even to his son (because of the yet newness of his youth) had he
been able to hand on the Perfect Vision. But when the Sun did rise for
me, and with all-seeing eyes I <span id="fr_308"></span>[3](#fn_308.md)
gazed upon the hidden \[mysteries\] of that New Dawn, and contemplated
them, slowly there came to me—but it was sure—conviction that the sacred
symbols of the cosmic elements were hid away hard by the secrets of
Osiris.

5\. \[Hermes\], ere he returned to Heaven, invoked a spell on them, and
spake these words. (For ’tis not meet, my son, that I should leave this
proclamation ineffectual, but \[rather\] should speak forth what words
\[our\] Hermes uttered

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

when he hid his books away.) Thus then he said:

“O holy books, who have been made by my immortal hands, by
incorruption’s magic spells, . . . <span id="fr_309"></span>[1](#fn_309.md)
free from decay throughout eternity remain and incorrupt from time!
Become unseeable, unfindable, for every one whose foot shall tread the
plains of this \[our\] land, until old Heaven doth bring forth meet
instruments for you, whom the Creator shall call souls.”

Thus spake he; and, laying spells on them by means of his own works, he
shuts them safe away in their own zones. And long enough the time has
been since they were hid away. <span id="fr_310"></span>[2](#fn_310.md)

6\. And Nature, O my son, was barren, till they who then were under
orders to patrol the Heaven, approaching to the God of all, their King,
reported on the lethargy of things. The time was come for cosmos to
awake, and this was no one’s task but His alone.

“We pray Thee, then,” they said, “direct Thy thought to things which now
exist and to what things the future needs.”

7\. When they spake thus, God smiled and said: “Nature, arise!” And from
His word

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

there came a marvel, feminine, possessed of perfect beauty, gazing at
which the Gods stood all-amazed. And God the Fore-father, with name of
Nature, honoured her, and bade her be prolific.

Then gazing fixedly on the surrounding space, He spake these words as
well: “Let Heaven be filled with all things full, and Air, and Æther
too! “God spake and it was so. And Nature with herself communing knew
she must not disregard the Sire’s command; so with the help of Toil she
made a daughter fair, whom she did call Invention. And on her <span
id="fr_311"></span>[1](#fn_311.md) God bestowed the gift of being, and with
His gift He set apart all them that had been so-far made, filled them
with mysteries, and to Invention gave the power of ruling them.

8\. But He, no longer willing that the world above should be inert, but
thinking good to fill it full of breaths, so that its parts should not
remain immotive and inert, He thus began on these <span
id="fr_312"></span>[2](#fn_312.md) with use of holy arts as proper for the
bringing forth of His own special work.

For taking breath from His own Breath and blending this with knowing
Fire, <span id="fr_313"></span>[3](#fn_313.md) He mingled them with certain
other substances which have

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

no power to know; and having made the two <span
id="fr_314"></span>[1](#fn_314.md)—either with other—one, with certain
hidden words of power, He thus set all the mixture going thoroughly;
until out of the compost smiled a substance, as it were, far subtler,
purer far, and more translucent than the things from which it came; it
was so clear that no one but the Artist could detect it.

9\. And since it neither thawed when fire was set unto it (for it was
made of Fire), nor yet did freeze when it had once been properly
produced (for it was made of Breath), but kept its mixture’s composition
a certain special kind, peculiar to itself, of special type and special
blend,—(which composition, you must know, God called Psychōsis, after
the more auspicious meaning of the name and from the similarity of its
behaviour <span id="fr_315"></span>[2](#fn_315).md)

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —it was from this
coagulate He fashioned souls enough in myriads, <span
id="fr_316"></span>[1](#fn_316.md) moulding with order and with measure the
efflorescent product of the mixture for what He willed, with skilled
experience and fitting reason, so that they should not be compelled to
differ any way one from another.

10\. For, you must know, the efflorescence that exhaled out of the
movement God induced, was not like to itself. For that its first
florescence was greater, fuller, every way more pure, than was its
second; its second was far second to the first, but greater far than was
its third. <span id="fr_317"></span>[2](#fn_317.md) And thus the total
number of degrees reached up to sixty. <span
id="fr_318"></span>[3](#fn_318.md) In spite of this, in laying down the
law, He ordered it that all should be eternal, as though from out one
essence, the forms of which Himself alone could bring to their
completion.

11\. Moreover, He appointed for them limits and reservations in the
height of upper Nature, <span id="fr_319"></span>[4](#fn_319.md)

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

that they might keep the cylinder <span id="fr_320"></span>[1](#fn_320.md)
a-whirl in proper order and economy and \[thus\] might please their
Sire. And so in that all-fairest station of the Æther He summoned unto
Him the natures of all things that had as yet been made, and spake these
words:

“O Souls, ye children fair of Mine own Breath and My solicitude, whom I
have now with My own Hands <span id="fr_321"></span>[2](#fn_321.md) brought
to successful birth and consecrate to My own world, give ear unto these
words of Mine as unto laws, and meddle not with any other space but that
which is appointed for you by My will.

“For you, if ye keep steadfast, the Heaven, with the star-order, and
thrones I have ordained full-filled with virtue, shall stay as now they
are for you; but if ye shall in any way attempt some innovation contrary
to My decrees, I swear to you by My most holy Breath, and by this
mixture out of which I brought you into being, and by these Hands of
Mine which gave you life, <span id="fr_322"></span>[3](#fn_322.md) that I
will speedily devise for you a bond and punishments.”

12\. And having said these words, the God,

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

who is my Lord, mixed the remaining cognate elements (Water and
Earth <span id="fr_323"></span>[1](#fn_323).md) together, and, as before,
invoking on them certain occult words, words of great power though not
so potent as the first, He set them moving rapidly, and breathed into
the mixture power of life; and taking the coagulate (which like the
other floated to the top), when it had been well steeped and had become
consistent, He modelled out of it those of the \[sacred\] animals <span
id="fr_324"></span>[2](#fn_324.md) possessing forms like unto men’s.

The mixtures’ residue He gave unto those souls that had gone in advance
and had been summoned to the lands of Gods, to regions near the Stars,
and to the \[choir of\] holy daimones. He said:

13\. “My sons, ye children of My Nature, fashion things! Take ye the
residue of what My art hath made, and let each fashion something which
shall bear resemblance to his own nature. These will I further give to
you as models.”

He took and set in order fair and fine, agreeably to the motions of the
souls, the world of sacred animals, appending as it were to those
resembling men those which came next in order, and on these types of
lives He did bestow

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

the all-devising powers and all-contriving procreative breath of all the
things which were for ever generally to be.

And He withdrew, with promises to join unto the visible productions of
their hands breath that cannot be seen, <span
id="fr_325"></span>[1](#fn_325.md) and essence of engendering its like to
each, so that they might give birth to others like themselves. And these
are under no necessity to do aught else than what they did at first.

14\. \[And Horus asked:\]

What did the souls do, mother, then?

And Isis said:

Taking the blend of matter, Horus, son, they first looked at the
Father’s mixture and adored it, and tried to find out whence it was
composed; but this was not an easy thing for them to know.

They then began to fear lest they should fall beneath the Father’s wrath
for trying to find out, and so they set to work to do what they were
bid.

Thereon, out of the upper stuff which had its topmost layer
superfluously light, they formed the race of birds; while they were
doing this the mixture had become half-hardened, and by this time had
taken on a firm consistency—thereon they fashioned out the race of
things

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

which have four feet; \[next they did fashion forth\] the race of
fish—less light and needing a moist substance of a different kind to
swim in; and as the residue was of a cold and heavy nature, from it the
Souls devised the race of creeping things.

15\. They then, my son, as though they had done something grand, with
over-busy daring armed themselves, and acted contrary to the commands
they had received; and forthwith they began to overstep their proper
limits and their reservations, and would no longer stay in the same
place, but were for ever moving, and thought that being ever stationed
in one place was death.

That they would do this thing, however, O my son (as Hermes says when he
speaks unto me), had not escaped the Eye of Him who is the God and Lord
of universal things; and He searched out a punishment and bond, the
which they now in misery endure.

Thus was it that the Sovereign King of all resolved to fabricate with
art the human frame, in order that in it the race of Souls throughout
might be chastised.

16\. “Then sending for me,” Hermes says, “He spake: ‘Soul of My Soul,
and holy mind of My own Mind, <span id="fr_326"></span>[1](#fn_326.md) up
to what point, the nature of the

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

things beneath, shall it be seen in gloom? How long shall what has up to
now been made remain inactive and be destitute of praise? Bring hither
to Me now, My son, all of the Gods in Heaven,’ said God”—as Hermes
saith.

And when they came obedient to His command,—“Look down,” said He, “upon
the Earth, and all beneath.” And they forthwith both looked and
understood the Sovereign’s will. And when He spake to them on human
kind’s behalf, they \[all\] agreed to furnish those who were to be, with
whatsoever thing they each could best provide.

17\. Sun said: “I’ll shine unto my full.”

Moon promised to pour light upon the after-the-sun course, and said she
had already given birth to Fear, and Silence, and also Sleep, and
Memory—a thing that would turn out to be most useful for them. <span
id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_327.md)

Cronus announced himself already sire of Justice and Necessity.

Zeus said: “So that the race which is to be may not for ever fight,
already for them have I made Fortune, and Hope, and Peace.”

Ares declared he had become already sire of Struggle, Wrath, and Strife.

Nor yet did Aphrodite hesitate; she also said: “I’ll join to them
Desire, my Lord, and Bliss,

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

and Laughter \[too\], so that our kindred souls, in working out their
very grievous condemnation, may not exhaust their punishment unto the
full.”

Full pleased were all, my son, at Aphrodite’s words.

“And for my part,” said Hermes, “I will make men’s nature well endowed;
I will devote to them Prudence and Wisdom, Persuasiveness and Truth, and
never will I cease from congress with Invention, but ever will I benefit
the mortal life of men born underneath my types of life. <span
id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_328.md) For that the types our Father and
Creator hath set apart for me, are types of wisdom and intelligence, and
more than ever \[is this so\] what time the motion of the Stars set over
them doth have the natural power of each consonant with itself.”

18\. And God, the Master of the universe, rejoiced on hearing this, and
ordered that the race of men should be.

“I,” Hermes says, “was seeking for the stuff which had to be employed,
and calling on the Monarch for His aid. And He gave order to the Souls
to give the mixture’s residue; and taking it I found it utterly dried
up.

“Thereon, in mixing it, I used more water far than was required to bring
the matter back unto

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

its former state, so that the plasm was in every way relaxable, and weak
and powerless, in order that it might not, in addition to its natural
sagacity, be full of power as well.

“I moulded it, and it was fair; and I rejoiced at seeing mine own work,
and from below I called upon the Monarch to behold. And He did look on
it, and was rejoiced, and ordered that the Souls should be enfleshed.

“Then were they first plunged in deep gloom, and, learning that they
were condemned, began to wail. <span id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_329.md) I
was myself amazed at the Souls’ utterances.”

19\. Now give good heed, son Horus, for thou art being told the Mystic
Spectacle which Kamēphis, our forefather, was privileged to hear from
Hermes, record-writer of all deeds, and I from Kamēphis, most ancient of
\[us\] all, when he did honour me with the Black \[Rite\] that gives
perfection; hear thou it now from me!

For when, O wondrous son of mighty fame, if they were about to be shut
in their prisons, some simply uttered wails and groans—in just the
self-same way as beasts that once have been at liberty, when torn from
their accustomed haunts they love so well, will be bad slaves, will
fight

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

and make revolt, and be in no agreement with their masters; nay more, if
circumstance should serve, will even do to death those that oppress
them. <span id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_330.md)

Others with louder outcry hissed like snakes; another one shrieked
shrilly, and ere he spake shed many tears, and, turning up and down what
things served him as eyes, he said:

20\. “O Heaven, thou source of our begetting, O Æther, Air, O Hands and
holy Breath of God our Monarch, O ye most brilliant Stars, eyes of the
Gods, O tireless light of Sun and Moon, co-nurslings of our origin,—reft
from \[you\] all we suffer piteously.

“And this the more, in that from spacious realms of light, from out
\[thy\] holy envelope and wealthy dome, and from the blessed government
we shared with Gods, we shall be thus shut down into these honourless
and lowly quarters.

“What is the so unseemly thing we miserables have done? What \[crime\]
deserves these punishments? How many sins await us wretched ones? How
many are the things we have to do in this our hopeless plight,
necessities to furnish for this watery frame that is so soon dissolved?

21\. “For that no longer shall our eyes behold

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

the souls of God; when through such watery spheres as these we see our
own forefather Heaven grown small and tiny, we shall dissolve in
sighs,—nay, there’ll be times we shall not see at all, <span
id="fr_331"></span>[1](#fn_331.md) for sentence hath been passed on us poor
things; the gift of real sight hath not been given to us, in that it
hath not been permitted us to see without the light. Windows they are,
not eyes! <span id="fr_332"></span>[2](#fn_332.md)

“How wretchedly shall we endure to hear our kindred breaths breathe in
the air, when we no longer shall be breathing with them! For home,
instead of this great world high in the air, a heart’s small mass awaits
us. Set Thou us free from bonds so base as these to which we have sunk
down, and end our grief!

“O Lord, and Father, and our Maker, if so it be Thou hast thus quickly
grown indifferent unto the works of Thine own Hands, appoint for us some
limits! Still deem us worthy of some words, though they be few, while
yet we can see through the whole world-order bright on every side!”

22\. Thus speaking, Horus, son, the Souls gained their request; for that
the Monarch came, and sitting on the Throne of Truth made answer to
their prayers.

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

“O Souls, Love and Necessity shall be your lords, <span
id="fr_333"></span>[1](#fn_333.md) they who are lords and marshals after Me
of all. <span id="fr_334"></span>[2](#fn_334.md) Know, all of you who are
set under My unageing rule, that as long as ye keep you free of sin, ye
shall dwell in the fields of Heaven; but if some cause of blame for
aught attach itself to you, ye shall dwell in the place that Destiny
allots, condemned to mortal wombs.

“If, then, the things imputed to your charge be slight, leaving the bond
of fleshly frames subject to death, ye shall again embrace your
\[father\] Heaven, and sigh no more; but if ye shall commit some greater
sins, and with the end appointed of your frames be not advanced, no
longer shall ye dwell in Heaven, nor even in the bodies of mankind, but
shall continue after that to wander round in lives irrational.” <span
id="fr_335"></span>[3](#fn_335.md)

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

23\. Thus speaking, Horus mine, He gave to all the gift of breath, <span
id="fr_336"></span>[1](#fn_336.md) and thus continued:

“It is not without purpose or by chance I have laid down the law of your
transformings <span id="fr_337"></span>[2](#fn_337.md); but as \[it will
be\] for the worse if ye do aught unseemly, so for the better, if ye
shall will what’s worthy of your birth.

“For I, and no one else, will be the Witness and the Watcher. Know,
then, it is for what ye have done heretofore, ye do endure this being
shut in bodies as a punishment.

“The difference in your rebirths, accordingly, for you, shall be as I
have said, a difference of bodies, and their \[final\] dissolution
\[shall be\] a benefit and a \[return to\] the fair happiness of former
days.

“But if ye think to do aught else unworthy of Me, your mind shall lose
its sight so as to think the contrary \[of what is true\], and take the
punishment for benefit; the change to better things for infamous
despite.

“But the more righteous of you, who stand upon the threshold of the
change to the diviner state, shall among men be righteous kings, and
genuine philosophers, founders of states, and lawgivers, and real seers,
and true herb-knowers,

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

and prophets of the Gods most excellent, skilful musicians, skilled
astronomers, and augurs wise, consummate sacrificers,—as many of you as
are worthy of things fair and good.

24\. “Among winged tribes \[they shall be\] eagles, for these will
neither scare away their kind nor feed on them; nay more, when they are
by, no other weaker beast will be allowed by them to suffer wrong, for
what will be the eagles’ nature is too just \[to suffer it\].

“Among four-footed things \[they will be\] lions,—a life of strength and
of a kind which in a measure needs no sleep, in mortal body practising
the exercises of immortal life—for they nor weary grow nor sleep. <span
id="fr_338"></span>[1](#fn_338.md)

“And among creeping things \[they will be\] dragons, in that this animal
will have great strength and live for long, will do no harm, and in a
way be friends with man, and let itself be tamed; it will possess no
poison and will cast its skin, <span id="fr_339"></span>[2](#fn_339.md) as
is the nature of the Gods.

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

“Among the things that swim \[they will be\] dolphins; for dolphins will
take pity upon those who fall into the sea, and if they are still
breathing bear them to the land, while if they’re dead they will not
ever even touch them, though they will be the most voracious tribe that
in the water dwells.”

25\. Thus speaking God became imperishable Mind. <span
id="fr_340"></span>[1](#fn_340.md) Thereon, son Horus, from the Earth
uprose a very Mighty Spirit which no mass of body could contain, whose
strength consisted in his intellect. And though he knew full well the
things on which he questioned—the body with which man was clothed
according to his type, a body fair and dignified, yet savage overmuch
and full of fear—immediately he saw the souls were entering the plasms,
he cried out:

“What are these called, O Hermes, Writer of the Records of the Gods?”

And when he answered “Men!”—“Hermes,” he said, “it is a daring work,
this making man, with eyes inquisitive, and talkative of tongue, with
power henceforth to hear things even which

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

are no concern of his, dainty of smell, who will use to its full his
power of touch on every thing.

“Hast thou, his generator, judged it good to leave him free from care,
who in the future daringly will gaze upon the fairest mysteries which
Nature hath? Wouldst thou leave him without a grief, who in the days to
come will make his thoughts reach unto mysteries beyond the Earth?

26\. “Men will dig up the roots of plants, and will find out their
juices’ qualities. Men will observe the nature of the stones. Men will
dissect not only animals irrational, but they’ll dissect themselves,
desiring to find out how they were made. They will stretch out their
daring hands e’en to the sea, and cutting self-grown forests down will
ferry one another o’er to lands beyond. \[Men\] will seek out as well
the inner nature of the holy spaces which no foot may tread, and will
chase after them into the height, desiring to observe the nature of the
motion of the Heaven.

“These are yet moderate things \[which they will do\]. For nothing more
remains than Earth’s remotest realms; nay, in their daring they will
track out Night, the farthest Night of all.

27\. “Naught have they, then, to stop them from receiving their
initiation in the good of

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

freedom from all pain, and, unconstrained by terror’s grievous goads,
from living softly out a life free from all care.

“Then will they not gird on the armour of an over-busy daring up to
Heaven? Will they not, then, reach out their souls freed from all care
unto the \[primal\] elements themselves?

“Teach them henceforth to long to plan out something, where they have as
well to fear the danger of its ill-success, in order that they may be
tamed by the sharp tooth of pain in failure of their hopes.

“Let the too busy nature of their souls be balanced by desires, and
fears, and griefs, and empty hopes.

“Let loves in quick succession sway their souls, hopes, manifold
desires, sometimes fulfilled, and sometimes unfulfilled, that the sweet
bait of their success may draw them into struggle amid direr ills.

“Let fever lay its heavy hand on them, that losing heart they may submit
desire to discipline.”

28\. Thou grievest, dost thou, Horus, son, to hear thy mother put these
things in words? Art thou not struck with wonder, art thou not
terror-struck at how poor man was grievously oppressed? Hear what is
sadder still!

When Momos said these things Hermes was pleased, for what he said was
said out of affection

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

for him; and so he did all that he recommended, speaking thus:

“Momos, the Nature of the Breath Divine which doth surround \[all
things\] shall not become inert. The Master of the universe appointed me
as steward and as manager.

“Wherefore the overseer of His command will be the keen-eyed Goddess of
the all, Adrasteia <span id="fr_341"></span>[1](#fn_341.md); and I will
skilfully devise an instrument, mysterious, possessed of power of sight
that cannot err, and cannot be escaped, whereto all things on earth
shall of necessity be subject, from birth to final dissolution,—an
instrument which binds together all that’s done. This instrument shall
rule all other things on Earth as well \[as man\].”

29\. These words, said Hermes, did I speak to Momos, and forthwith the
instrument was set a-going.

When this was done, and when the souls had entered in the bodies, and
\[Hermes\] had himself been praised for what was done, again the Monarch
did convoke the Gods in session. The Gods assembled, and once more did
He make proclamation, saying:

“Ye Gods, all ye who have been made of chiefest Nature, free from all
decay, who have

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

received as your appointed lot for ever more to order out the mighty
Æon, through whom all universal things will never weary grow
surrendering themselves in turn the one to other,—how long shall we be
rulers of this sovereignty that none can ever know? How long these
things, shall they transcend the power of sight of Sun and Moon?

“Let each of us bring forth according to his power. Let us by our own
energy wipe out this inert state of things; let chaos seem to be a myth
incredible to future days. Set hand to mighty work; and I myself will
first begin.”

30\. He spake; straightway in cosmic order there began the
differentiation of the up-to-then black unity \[of things\]. And Heaven
shone forth above tricked out with all his mysteries; Earth, still
a-tremble, as the Sun shone forth grew harder, and appeared with all the
fair adornments that bedeck her round on every side. For beautiful to
God are even things which men think mean, in that in truth they have
been made to serve the laws of God.

And God rejoiced when now He saw His works a-moving; and filling full
His Hands, which held as much as all surrounding space, with all that
Nature had produced, and squeezing tight the handfuls mightily, He said:

“Take \[these\], O holy Earth, take those, all-

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

honoured one, who art to be the mother of all things, and henceforth
lack thou naught!”

31\. God spake, and opening His Hands, such Hands as God should have, He
poured them all into the composition of the world. And they in the
beginnings were unknown in every way; for that the Souls as newly shut
in prison, not enduring their disgrace, began to strive in emulation
with the Gods in Heaven, in full command of their high birth, and when
held back, in that they had the same Creator, made revolt, and using
weaker men as instruments, began to make them set upon each other, and
range themselves in conflict, and make war among themselves.

Thus strength did mightily prevail o’er weakness, so that the strong did
burn and massacre the weak, and from the holy places down they cast the
living and the dead down from the holy shrines, until the Elements in
their distress resolved to go to God their Monarch \[to complain\] about
the savage state in which men lived.

The evil now being very great, the Elements approached the God who made
them, and formulated their complaint in some such words as these:

32\. It was moreover Fire who first received authority to speak. He
said:

“O Lord, Artificer of this new World, thou

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Name mysterious
among the Gods, and up to now revered by all mankind, how long hast
Thou, O Daimon, judged it right to leave the life of mortals without
God?

“Show now Thyself unto Thy World consulting <span
id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_342.md) Thee; initiate the savagery of life with
peace; give laws to life; to right give oracles; fill with fair hopes
all things; and let men fear the vengeance of the Gods, and none will
sin.

“Should they receive due retribution for their sins, they will refrain
henceforth from doing wrong; they will respect their oaths, and no one
any more will ponder sacrilege.

“Let them be taught to render thanks for benefits received, that I, the
Fire, may joyfully do service in the sacrificial rites, that they may
from the altar send sweet-smelling vapours forth.

“For up to now I am polluted, Lord; and by the godless daring of these
men I am compelled to burn up flesh. They will not let me be for what I
was brought forth; but they adulterate with all indecency my undecaying
state.”

33\. And Air too said:

“I also, Master, am made turbid by the vapours which the bodies of the
dead exhale, and I am pestilential, and, no longer filled with health, I
gaze down from above on things I ought not to behold.”

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

Next Water, O my son of mighty soul, received authority to speak, and
spake and said:

“O Father, O wonderful Creator of all things, Daimon self-born, and
Nature’s Maker, who through Thee doth conceive all things, now at this
last, command the rivers’ streams for ever to be pure, for that the
rivers and the seas or wash the murderers’ hands or else receive the
murdered.”

34\. After came Earth in bitter grief, and taking up the tale, O son of
high renown, thus she began to speak:

“O sovereign Lord, Chief of the Heavenly Ones, and Master of the
Wheels, <span id="fr_343"></span>[1](#fn_343.md) Thou Ruler of us Elements,
O Sire of them who stand beside Thee, from whom all things have the
beginning of their increase and of their decrease, and into whom they
cease again and have the end that is their due according to Necessity’s
decree, O greatly honoured One, the godless rout of men doth dance upon
my bosom.

“I hold in my embrace as well the nature of all things; for I, as Thou
didst give command, not only bear them all, but I receive them also when
they’re killed. But now am I dishonoured. The world upon the Earth
though filled with all things \[else\] hath not a God.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

“For having naught to fear they sin in everything, and from my heights,
O Lord, down \[dead\] they fall by every evil art. And soaking with the
juices of their carcases I’m all corrupt. Hence am I, Lord, compelled to
hold in me those of no worth. With all I bear I would hold God as well.

“Bestow on Earth, if not Thyself, for I could not contain Thee, yet some
holy Emanation <span id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) of Thyself. Make
Thou the Earth more honoured than the rest of Elements; for it is right
that she should boast of gifts from Thee, in that she giveth all.”

35\. Thus spake the Elements; and God, fullfilling all things with the
sound of His \[most\] holy Voice, spake thus:

“Depart, ye Holy Ones, ye Children worthy of a mighty Sire, nor yet in
any way attempt to innovate, nor leave the whole of \[this\] My World
without your active service.

“For now another Efflux of My Nature is among you, and he shall be a
pious supervisor of all deeds—judge incorruptible of living men and
monarch absolute of those beneath the earth, not only striking terror
\[into them\] but taking vengeance on them. And by his class of birth
the fate he hath deserved shall follow every man.”

And so the Elements did cease from their complaint,

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

upon the Master’s order, and they held their peace; and each of them
continued in the exercise of his authority and in his rule.

36\. And Horus thereon said:

How was it, mother, then, that Earth received God’s Efflux?

And Isis said:

I may not tell the story of \[this\] birth <span
id="fr_345"></span>[1](#fn_345.md); for it is not permitted to describe the
origin of thy descent, O Horus, \[son\] of mighty power, lest afterwards
the way-of-birth of the immortal Gods should be known unto men,—except
so far that God the Monarch, the universal Orderer and Architect, sent
for a little while thy mighty sire Osiris, and the mightiest Goddess
Isis, that they might help the world, for all things needed them.

’Tis they who filled life full of life. ’Tis they who caused the
savagery of mutual slaughtering of men to cease. ’Tis they who hallowed
precincts to the Gods their ancestors and spots for holy rites. ’Tis
they who gave to men laws, food, and shelter.

’Tis they who will, says Hermes, learn to know the secrets of my records
all, and will make separation of them; and some they will keep for
themselves, while those that are best suited for the benefit of mortal
men, they will engrave on tablet and on obelisk.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

’Tis they who were the first to set up courts of law; and filled the
world with justice and fair rule. ’Tis they who were the authors of good
pledges and of faith, and brought the mighty witness of an oath into
men’s lives.

’Tis they who taught men how to wrap up those who ceased to live, as
they should be. <span id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_346.md)

’Tis they who searched into the cruelty of death, and learned that
though the spirit which goes out longs to return into men’s bodies, yet
if it ever fail to have the power of getting back again, then loss of
life results.

’Tis they who learned from Hermes that surrounding space was filled with
daimons, and graved on hidden stones \[the hidden teaching\].

’Tis they alone who, taught by Hermes in God’s hidden codes, became the
authors of the arts, and sciences, and all pursuits which men do
practise, and givers of their laws.

’Tis they who, taught by Hermes that the things below have been disposed
by God to be in sympathy with things above, established on the earth the
sacred rites o’er which the mysteries in Heaven preside.

’Tis they who, knowing the destructibility of \[mortal\] frames, devised
the grade of prophets, in all things perfected, in order that no prophet
who stretched forth his hands unto the Gods,

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

should be in ignorance of anything, that magic and philosophy should
feed the soul, and medicine preserve the body when it suffered pain.

38\. And having done all this, my son, Osiris and myself perceiving that
the world was \[now\] quite full, were thereupon demanded back by those
who dwell in Heaven, but could not go above till we had made appeal unto
the Monarch, that surrounding space might with this knowledge of the
soul <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_347.md) be filled as well, and we
ourselves succeed in making our ascent acceptable \[to Him\]. . . . For
that God doth in hymns rejoice.

Ay, mother, Horus said. On me as well bestow the knowledge of this hymn,
that I may not remain in ignorance.

And Isis said: Give ear, O son! <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_348.md)

<span id="fn_297"></span>[93:2](th326.htm#fr_297.md) Curiously enough,
though the page-headings throughout have “Minerva Mundi,” the heading of
p. 28 still stands “Pupilla Mundi”—showing that Patrizzi himself was
puzzled how to translate the Greek, and had probably in the first place
translated it throughout “Pupilla Mundi,” or “Apple of the Eye of the
World.” In his Introduction (p. 3), however, Patrizzi writes: “But there
is extant also another \[book of Hermes\] with the title of ‘The Sacred
Book,’ which we found in Cyprus, in a monastery called Enclistra, at the
same time as the rest of the books, and which John Stobæus has inserted
in his Physical Eclogues together with other fragments.” This would seem
to suggest that Patrizzi had seen the original Sermon, and that its main
title was “The Sacred Book.”

πρόνοια.

<span id="fn_308"></span>[96:3](th326.htm#fr_308.md) The masculine is here
used, the writer forgetting for the moment that he had assumed the
person of Isis.

<span id="fn_309"></span>[97:1](th326.htm#fr_309.md) The text is here again
hopeless. Meineke’s emendation (*Adnot*., p. cxxx.) ἃς . . . φαρμάκῳ
χρίσας ἐπικρατῷ—which makes Hermes smear the books with some magical
ointment—is ingenious, but hardly satisfactory, though Wachsmuth adopts
it.

<span id="fn_310"></span>[97:2](th326.htm#fr_310.md) This is purely
conjectural; the text is utterly corrupt.

<span id="fn_312"></span>[98:2](th326.htm#fr_312.md) *Sc.* the breaths or

<span id="fn_313"></span>[98:3](th326.htm#fr_313.md) πῦρ νοερόν—a term in
frequent use subsequently among the Later Platonists; *cf*. Porphyry,
*ap*. Euseb., *Præp. Ev*., XV. xi. 16

<span id="fn_314"></span>[99:1](th326.htm#fr_314.md) *Sc.* the knowing and
unknowing primal elements. *Cf.* *P. S. A*., vi.

<span id="fn_315"></span>[99:2](th326.htm#fr_315.md) The text is very
involved and obscure, and the meaning of the writer is by no means
clear. Psychōsis (ψύχωσις) means either animation (quickening) or
“making cold” (*cf.* ψύχω and ψυχόω); the name Psychōsis is thus
apparently supposed by the writer to have some connection with the term
ἔψυχε (“freeze,” or grow cold), which he has just employed in his
description of the behaviour of the mixture. In its less auspicious
sense ἔψυχε meant “grow cold”; in its more auspicious meaning it
signified “breathe.” But even so it must be said that the further reason
(viz., similarity of behaviour) given for the choice of the term
Psychōsis is the exact opposite of what is stated in the description of
the soul-stuff’s nature; and this is all the more puzzling when we
recall the theory of Origen and his predecessors that the soul (ψυχή)
was so-called precisely because it *had* grown cold and fallen away from
the Divine heat and life. With the term *cf*. the σωμάτωσις of Exx.
viii. 5, vii. 2.

<span id="fn_316"></span>[100:1](th326.htm#fr_316.md) *Cf.* Plato, *Tim*.,
41: “He divided the whole mixture into souls equal in number to the
stars, and assigned each soul to a star.” So also Philo, who speaks of
the souls as “equal in number to the stars”—*De Som*., i. § 22; M. 642,
P. 586 (Ri. iii. 244).

<span id="fn_317"></span>[100:2](th326.htm#fr_317.md) *Cf.* Plato, *ibid*.:
“They \[the souls\] were not, however, pure as before, but diluted to
the second and third degrees.

<span id="fn_318"></span>[100:3](th326.htm#fr_318.md) See § 56 below.

<span id="fn_319"></span>[100:4](th326.htm#fr_319.md) Of the Nature Above
(τῆς ἄνω φύσεως); *cf*. the “Jerusalem Above” of the “Gnostics.” *Cf.*
also *Tim*., 41 D: “And having there \[that is, among the stars\] placed
them as in a chariot, he showed them the nature of the universe, and
declared to them the laws of destiny, according to which their first
birth should be one and the same for all,—no one should suffer a
disadvantage at his hands; they were to be sown in the instruments of
time severally adapted to them, and to come forth the most religious of
animals; and as human nature was of two kinds, the superior race would
hereafter be called man.” With the last sentence, *cf.* also 12 below.

<span id="fn_320"></span>[101:1](th326.htm#fr_320.md) *Cf.* *P. S. A.*,

<span id="fn_323"></span>[102:1](th326.htm#fr_323.md) We have had previous
mention of fire, (æther) and air,—the psychōsis being the quintessence.

<span id="fn_324"></span>[102:2](th326.htm#fr_324.md) These are presumably
the types of life in the upper world, symbolized by the zodiac.

<span id="fn_325"></span>[103:1](th326.htm#fr_325.md) So Meineke in notes,
following Cantor,—instead of the traditional “visible.”

<span id="fn_329"></span>[107:1](th326.htm#fr_329.md) There is a lacuna in
the text, which I have thus conjecturally completed.

<span id="fn_330"></span>[108:1](th326.htm#fr_330.md) The reading of this
sentence has not yet been properly emended, so that its translation is
somewhat conjectural.

<span id="fn_331"></span>[109:1](th326.htm#fr_331.md) An Orphic verse has
here crept into the text from the margin. It runs: “By light it is we
see; by eyes we naught behold.” *Fragm. Monad*., x., p. 504, Herm.

<span id="fn_332"></span>[109:2](th326.htm#fr_332.md) *Cf.* Plat., *Men*.,

<span id="fn_334"></span>[110:2](th326.htm#fr_334.md) *Cf*. Frag. xxiii.

<span id="fn_335"></span>[110:3](th326.htm#fr_335.md) *Cf.* *Tim*., 42 B:
“He who lived well during his appointed time was to return and dwell in
his native star, and there he would have a blessed and congenial
existence. But if he failed in attaining this, at the second birth, he
would pass into a woman, and if, when in that state of being, he did not
desist from evil, he would be continually changed into some brute who
resembled him in the evil nature which he had acquired, and would not
cease from his toils and transformations until he followed the
revolution of the ‘same’ and the ‘like’ within him, and overcame by the
help of reason the turbulent and irrational mob of later accretions,
made up of fire and air and water and earth, and returned to the form of
his first and better state.” Notice the omission of any reference to the
inferior status of woman in the Egyptian tradition.

<span id="fn_336"></span>[111:1](th326.htm#fr_336.md) Lit. “their
spirits”—which apparently link the souls with their bodies.

<span id="fn_337"></span>[111:2](th326.htm#fr_337.md) Reading μεταβολάς.

<span id="fn_338"></span>[112:1](th326.htm#fr_338.md) *Cf.* Manetho, cited
in the *Orthography* of Chœroboscus (Cramer, *Anecd*. *Ox*., ii. 235,
32; Ælian, *H. A*., v. 39, who follows Apion; R. 145, n. 3). But indeed
this queer belief is a commonplace of the Mediæval *Bestiaries*, which
all go back to their second century Alexandrian prototype, the famous
*Physiologus*, which was doubtless in part based on Aristotle’s *History
of Animals* and Pliny’s *Natural History*.

<span id="fn_339"></span>[112:2](th326.htm#fr_339.md) ἐάσει δὲ καὶ γηράσαν.
The reading is corrupt. But if we read γῆρας for γηράσαν, we have in the
writer’s ornate and somewhat strained style ἐᾶν γῆρας for the usual
γῆρας ἐκδύνειν found in Aristotle (*H. V*., 5. 7. 10; 8. 17. 11) for the
changing of a serpent’s skin. The phrase “as is the nature of the Gods”
may then be explained as referring to the parallel between the anciently
supposed rejuvenescence of the serpent and the perpetual growing young
of the Gods.
