##### GOD IS BEYOND ALL UNDERSTANDING

<span class="smallcaps">Thrice-Greatest</span> Hermes speaks of the One
God, and confesses Him beyond all understanding and all appraisement.

This is evidently a reference to the most quoted sentence of Hermes. See
Justin Martyr i. below, and other references.

Chambers (p. 140), after this notice in Cyprian, inserts a passage from
Eusebius (*c*. 325 A.D.), which he says is “a clear quotation from the
‘Pœmandres’ of Hermes, whom, however, he \[Eusebius\] probably confounds
with the Shepherd of Hermas.”

Eusebius (*Hist. Ecc*., v. 8), however, quotes Irenæus (iv. 20, 2), who
quotes literally *The Shepherd of Hermas* (Mand., i.). Indeed, it is the
most famous sentence in that early document. See the list of its
quotations by the Fathers in the note to Gebhardt and Harnack’s text
(Leipzig, 1897), p. 70. Such verbal exactitude is not to be found in the
remaining Trismegistic literature; the idea, however, is the basis of
the whole Trismegistic theology.
