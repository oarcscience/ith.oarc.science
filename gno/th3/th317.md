#### EXCERPT XVI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[OF SOUL, III.\]

<span class="small">(I have added the title, Patrizzi (p. 40b) having
only the heading: “To the Same Ammon.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xli. 3, under the simple
heading: “Of Hermes”; G. pp. 323, 324; M. i. 227, 228; W. i. 320,
321.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. v. of “Fragments of the Books
of Hermes to Ammon,” pp. 263, 264.)</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">The</span> Soul is, then, incorporal
essence; for if it should have body, it would no longer have the power
of being self-maintained. <span id="fr_234"></span>[1](#fn_234)

For every body needeth being; it needeth also ordered life <span
id="fr_235"></span>[2](#fn_235) as well.

For that for every thing that comes to birth, <span
id="fr_236"></span>[3](#fn_236) change also must succeed. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[4](#fn_237)

For that which doth become, <span id="fr_238"></span>[5](#fn_238)
becomes in size; for in becoming it hath increase.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

Again, for every thing that doth increase, decrease succeedeth; and on
increase destruction.

For, sharing in the form of life, <span id="fr_239"></span>[1](#fn_239)
it <span id="fr_240"></span>[2](#fn_240) lives; it shares, also, in
being through the Soul.

2\. But that which is the cause of being to another, is being first
itself.

And by \[this\] “being” I now mean becoming in reason, and taking part
in intellectual life.

It is the Soul that doth supply this intellectual life.

It is called living <span id="fr_241"></span>[3](#fn_241) through the
life, and rational through the intellect, and mortal through the body.

Soul is, accordingly, a thing incorporal, possessing \[in itself\] the
power of freedom from all change.

For how would it be possible to talk about an intellectual living
thing, <span id="fr_242"></span>[4](#fn_242) if that there were no
\[living\] essence to furnish life?

Nor, any more, would it be possible to say a rational \[living\] thing,
were there no ratiocinative essence to furnish intellectual life.

3\. It is not to all \[lives\] that intellect extends; \[it doth
depend\] on the relationship of body’s composition to the Harmony.

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

For if the hot in the compost be in excess, he’s light <span
id="fr_243"></span>[1](#fn_243) and fervid; but if the cold, he’s heavy
and he’s dull.

For Nature makes the composition fit the Harmony.

There are three forms of the becoming,—the hot, the cold, and medium.

It <span id="fr_244"></span>[2](#fn_244) makes it fit according to the
ruling Star <span id="fr_245"></span>[3](#fn_245) in the star-mixture.

And Soul receiving it, <span id="fr_246"></span>[4](#fn_246) as Fate
decrees, supplies this work of Nature with \[the proper kind of\] life.

Nature, accordingly, assimilates the body’s harmony unto the mixture of
the Stars, and co-unites its complex mixtures with their Harmony, so
that they are in mutual sympathy.

For that the end of the Stars’ Harmony is to give birth to sympathy
according to their Fate.
