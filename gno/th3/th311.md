#### EXCERPT X.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[CONCERNING THE RULE OF PROVIDENCE, NECESSITY AND FATE\]

<span class="small">(Title in Patrizzi (p. 38), “Of Fate,” simply;
followed by “From the \[Sermons\] to Tat.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., iv. 8, under heading: “Of
Hermes to his Son”; G. pp. 61, 62; M. i. 42, 43; W. i. 73, 74.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. vii. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” pp. 248, 249.)</span>

1\. \[*Tat*.\] Rightly, O father, hast thou told me all; now further,
\[pray,\] recall unto my mind what are the things that Providence doth
rule, and what the things ruled by Necessity, and in like fashion also
\[those\] under Fate.

\[*Her*.\] I said there were in us, O Tat, three species of incorporals.

The first’s a thing the mind alone can grasp <span
id="fr_177"></span>[1](#fn_177.md); it thus is colourless, figureless,
massless, <span id="fr_178"></span>[2](#fn_178.md) proceeding out of the
First Essence in itself, sensed by the mind alone. <span
id="fr_179"></span>[3](#fn_179.md)

And there are also, \[secondly,\] in us, opposed

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

to this, <span id="fr_180"></span>[1](#fn_180.md) configurings, <span
id="fr_181"></span>[2](#fn_181.md)—of which this serves as the
receptacle. <span id="fr_182"></span>[3](#fn_182.md)

But what has once been set in motion by the Primal <span
id="fr_183"></span>[4](#fn_183.md) Essence for some \[set\] purpose of the
Reason (*Logos*), and that has been conceived <span
id="fr_184"></span>[5](#fn_184.md) \[by it\], straightway doth change into
another form of motion; this is the image of the Demiurgic
Thought. <span id="fr_185"></span>[6](#fn_185.md)

2\. And there is \[also\] a third species of incorporals, which doth
eventuate round bodies,—space, time, \[and\] motion, figure,
surface, <span id="fr_186"></span>[7](#fn_186.md) size, \[and\] species.

Of these there are two \[sets of\] differences.

The first \[lies\] in the quality pertaining specially unto themselves;
the second \[set is\] of the body.

The special qualities are figure, colour, species, space, time,
movement.

\[The differences\] peculiar to body are figure

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

configured, and colour coloured; there’s also form conformed, surface
and size. <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_187.md)

The latter with the former have no part.

3\. The Intelligible Essence, then, in company with God, <span
id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_188.md) has power o’er its own self, and
\[power\] to keep <span id="fr_189"></span>[3](#fn_189.md) another, in that
it keeps itself, since Essence in itself is not under Necessity.

But when ’tis left by God, it takes unto itself the corporal nature; its
choice of it being ruled by Providence,—that is, its choosing of the
world. <span id="fr_190"></span>[4](#fn_190.md)

All the irrational is moved to-wards some reason.

Reason \[comes\] under Providence; unreason \[falls\] under Necessity;
the things that happen in the corporal \[fall\] under Fate.

Such is the Sermon on the rule of Providence, Necessity and Fate.

#### COMMENT

I have taken the title from the concluding words, which are evidently
the end of the sermon. Stobæus thus seems to have reproduced the whole
of this little tractate, which should be read in connection with Exx.
xi., xii. and xiii. *C. H.*, xii. (xiii.) 6 (see Commentary), seems to
presuppose this sermon.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_177"></span>[55:1](th311.htm#fr_177.md) Or an intelligible
something.

<span id="fn_178"></span>[55:2](th311.htm#fr_178.md) Or bodiless.

<span id="fn_179"></span>[55:3](th311.htm#fr_179.md) That is, the
intelligible essence.

<span id="fn_180"></span>[56:1](th311.htm#fr_180.md) *Sc.* of opposite
nature to the first incorporal, as negative to positive, say.

<span id="fn_181"></span>[56:2](th311.htm#fr_181.md) σχηματότητες—that is,
the “somethings” more subtle or ideal than figures or shapes,—types, or
prototypes, or paradigms of some kind.

<span id="fn_182"></span>[56:3](th311.htm#fr_182.md) That is, plays the
part of matter, “womb,” or “nurse” to these.

<span id="fn_183"></span>[56:4](th311.htm#fr_183.md) Lit. intelligible.

<span id="fn_184"></span>[56:5](th311.htm#fr_184.md) Or received.

<span id="fn_185"></span>[56:6](th311.htm#fr_185.md) Or Mind. Heeren (as
also all editors subsequent to him) thinks that something has here
fallen out of the text, because he finds no *second* incorporal
specifically mentioned; but the duality of the demiurgic thought, active
and passive, creative and conceptive, will do very well for the second.

<span id="fn_186"></span>[56:7](th311.htm#fr_186.md) Or appearance.

<span id="fn_187"></span>[57:1](th311.htm#fr_187.md) The distinction seems
to be between colour, form, etc., “in itself,” and differentiated
colours, forms, etc.

<span id="fn_188"></span>[57:2](th311.htm#fr_188.md) πρὸς τῷ θεῷ γενομένη.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[57:3](th311.htm#fr_189.md) Or save, preserve.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[57:4](th311.htm#fr_190.md) This sentence seems to
be corrupt.
