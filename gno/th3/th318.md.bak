#### EXCERPT XVII.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[OF SOUL, IV.\]

<span class="small">(Patrizzi (p. 41) runs this on to the preceding
without a break.</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., xli. 4, under heading: “Of the
Same”—that is, “Of Hermes”; G. pp. 324, 325; M. i. 228, 229; W. i. 321,
322.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. vi. of “Fragments of the Book
of Hermes to Ammon,” pp. 265, 266.)</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Soul</span>, Ammon, then, is essence
containing its own end within itself; in \[its\] beginning taking to
itself the way of life allotted it by Fate, it draws also unto itself a
reason like to matter, possessing “heart” and “appetite.” <span
id="fr_247"></span>[1](#fn_247.md)

“Heart,” too, is matter; if it doth make its state accordant with the
Soul’s intelligence, it, \[then,\] becometh courage, and is not led away
by cowardice.

And “appetite” is matter, too; if it doth make its state accord with the
Soul’s rational power, it \[then\] becometh temperance, and is not

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

moved by pleasure, for reasoning fills up the “appetite’s” deficiency.

2\. And when both \[these\] <span id="fr_248"></span>[1](#fn_248.md) are
harmonized, and equalized, and both are made subordinate to the Soul’s
rational power, justice is born.

For that their state of equilibrium doth take away the “heart’s” excess,
and equalizes the deficiency of “appetite.”

The source of these, <span id="fr_249"></span>[2](#fn_249.md) however, is
the penetrating essence of all thought, <span
id="fr_250"></span>[3](#fn_250.md) its self by its own self, \[working\] in
its own reason that doth think round everything, <span
id="fr_251"></span>[4](#fn_251.md) with its own reason as its rule. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[5](#fn_252.md)

It is the essence that doth lead and guide as ruler; its reason is as
’twere its counsellor who thinks about all things. <span
id="fr_253"></span>[6](#fn_253.md)

3\. The reason of the essence, then, is gnosis of those reasonings which
furnish the irrational \[part\] with reasoning’s conjecturing, <span
id="fr_254"></span>[7](#fn_254.md)—a faint thing as compared with reasoning
\[itself\], but reasoning as compared with the irrational, as echo unto
voice, and moonlight to the sun.

And “heart” and “appetite” are harmonized upon a rational plan; they
pull the one against the other, and \[so\] they learn to know in their
own selves a circular intent. <span id="fr_255"></span>[8](#fn_255.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_247"></span>[75:1](th318.htm#fr_247.md) In a metaphorical
sense,—θυμὸν καὶ ἐπιθυμία; terms originally belonging to a primitive
stage of culture, and often translated “anger and
concupiscence”—positive and negative, denoting the “too much” and the
“too little” of the animal nature, and to he paralleled with the νοῦς
and ἐπίνοια of the rational nature. *Cf.* Ex. i. 5 and xviii. 3.

<span id="fn_248"></span>[76:1](th318.htm#fr_248.md) *Sc.* virtues,—courage
