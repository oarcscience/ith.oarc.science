#### EXCERPT XI.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[OF JUSTICE\]

<span class="small">(I have added the title, the excerpt not being found
in Patrizzi.</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys*., iii. 52, under the vague
heading: “Of Hermes”; G. p. 50; M. i. 33, 34; W. i. 62, 63.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. iv. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” p. 240.)</span>

1\. \[*Her*.\] For there hath been appointed, O \[my\] son, a very
mighty Daimon turning in the universe’s midst, that sees all things that
men do on the earth.

Just as Foreknowledge <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_191) and
Necessity have been set o’er the Order of the gods, in the same way is
Justice set o’er men, causing the same to act on them.

For they rule o’er the order of the things existing as divine, which
have no will, nor any power, to err.

For the Divine cannot be made to wander; from which the incapacity to
err accrues \[to it\].

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

But Justice is appointed to correct the errors men commit on earth.

2\. For, seeing that their race is under sway of death, and made out of
bad matter, \[it naturally errs\], and failure is the natural thing,
especially to those who are without the power of seeing the
Divine. <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192)

’Tis over these that Justice doth have special sway. They’re subject
both to Fate through the activities of birth, <span
id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_193) and unto Justice through the mistakes
\[they make\] in life. <span id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_194)

#### COMMENT

The title and place of this excerpt has been discussed in the Commentary
on *C. H.*, xii. (xiii.) 6. It belongs to the Tat-Sermons, and in the
collection of Lactantius probably stood prior to the Sermon of Hermes to
Tat, “About the General Mind.” <span id="fr_195"></span>[4](#fn_195)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_191"></span>[58:1](th312.htm#fr_191) Or Providence. *Cf.*
Ex. i. 15, note.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[59:1](th312.htm#fr_192) This recalls Philo’s
description of the Therapeuts, who were “taught ever more and more to
see,” and strive for the “intuition” or “sight of that which is,”—τῆς
τοῦ ὄντος θέας (Philo, *D. V. C.*, 891 P., 473 M.).

<span id="fn_193"></span>[59:2](th312.htm#fr_193) That is, through the
natural accidents that attend life in a body.

<span id="fn_194"></span>[59:3](th312.htm#fr_194) That is, in their way
of living—ἐν τῷ βίω.

<span id="fn_195"></span>[59:4](th312.htm#fr_195) Compare with it Exx.
x., xii., xiii.
