### OF ENERGY AND FEELING

<span class="small">(Title from Patrizzi (p. 44); preceded by “Of
Thrice-greatest Hermes.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Phys.*, xxxv. 6, under the heading:
“From the \[Sermons\] to Tat”; G. pp. 284-291; M. i. 198-203; W. i.
284-289.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. ii. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” pp. 231-237.)</span>

1\. *Tat*. Rightly hast thou explained these things, O father \[mine\].
Now give me further teaching as to those.

For thou hast said somewhere <span id="fr_93"></span>[1](#fn_93.md) that
science and that art do constitute the rational’s energy. <span
id="fr_94"></span>[2](#fn_94.md)

But now thou say’st that the irrational lives, <span
id="fr_95"></span>[3](#fn_95.md) through deprivation of the rational, are
and are called *ir*-rational.

According to this reasoning, \[therefore\], it follows of necessity that
the irrational lives are

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

without any share in science or in art, through deprivation of the
rational.

2\. *Her*. \[It follows\] of necessity, \[my\] son.

*Tat*. How, then, O father, do we see some of irrational \[creatures\]
using \[both\] intelligence, and art?—the ants, for instance, storing
their food for winter, and in like fashion, \[too,\] the creatures of
the air building their nests, and the four-footed beasts \[each\]
knowing their own holes. <span id="fr_96"></span>[1](#fn_96.md)

*Her*. These things they do, O son, neither by science nor by art, but
by \[the force of\] nature.

Science and art are teachable; but none of these irrationals is taught a
thing.

Things done by nature are \[so\] done by reason of the general energy of
things.

Things \[done\] by art and science are achieved by those who know,
\[and\] not by all.

Things done by all are brought into activity <span
id="fr_97"></span>[2](#fn_97.md) by nature.

3\. For instance, all look up \[to heaven\]; but all \[are\] not
musicians, or \[are\] all archers, or hunters, or the rest.

But some of them have learned one thing,

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> \[others another
thing\], science and art being active <span
id="fr_98"></span>[1](#fn_98.md) \[in them\].

In the same way, if some ants only did this thing, and others not, thou
would’st have rightly said they acted by \[the light\] of science, and
stored their food by means of art.

But if they all without distinction are driven by their nature to \[do\]
this, though \[it may be\] against their will,—’tis plain they do not do
it or by science or by art.

4\. For Tat, these energies, though \[in themselves\] they are
incorporal, are \[found\] in bodies, and act through bodies.

Wherefore, O Tat, in that they are incorporal, thou sayest that they are
immortal; but, in so far as without bodies they cannot manifest
activity, <span id="fr_99"></span>[2](#fn_99.md) I say that they are ever
in a body.

Things once called into being for some purpose, or some cause, things
that come under Providence and Fate, can never stay inactive of their
proper energy.

For that which is, shall ever be; for that this \[being\] is \[the
very\] body and the life of it.

5\. It follows from this reason, \[then,\] that these are always bodies.

Wherefore I say that “bodying” <span id="fr_100"></span>[3](#fn_100.md)
itself is an eternal \[exercise of\] energy.

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

If bodies are on earth, they’re subject unto dissolution; yet must these
\[ever\] be \[on earth to serve\] as places and as organs for the
energies.

The energies, however, \[are\] immortal, and the immortal is
eternally,—\[that is, that\] body-making, if it ever is, <span
id="fr_101"></span>[1](#fn_101.md) is energy.

6\. \[The energies\] accompany the soul, though not appearing all at
once.

Some of them energize the man the moment that he’s born, united with the
soul round its irrational \[parts\]; whereas the purer ones, with change
of age, <span id="fr_102"></span>[2](#fn_102.md) co-operate with the soul’s
rational part.

But all these energies depend on bodies. From godly <span
id="fr_103"></span>[3](#fn_103.md) bodies they descend to mortal
\[frames\], these body-making \[energies\]; each one of them is \[ever\]
active, either around the body or the soul.

Yea, they are active with the soul itself without a body. They are for
ever in activity.

The soul, however, is not for ever in a *mortal* body, for it can be
without the *body*; whereas the energies can never be without the
*bodies*.

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

This is a sacred saying (*logos*), son: Body apart from soul cannot
persist; its being can. <span id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md)

7\. *Tat*. What dost thou mean, O father \[mine\]?

*Her*. Thus understand it, Tat! When soul leaves body, body itself
remains.

But \[even\] the body so abandoned, <span
id="fr_105"></span>[2](#fn_105.md) as long as it remains, is in activity,
being broken up and made to disappear.

For body without \[the exercise of\] energy could not experience these
things. <span id="fr_106"></span>[3](#fn_106.md)

This energy, accordingly, continues with the body when the soul has
gone.

This, therefore, is the difference of an immortal body and a mortal
one,—that the immortal doth consist of a one single matter, but this
\[body does\] not.

The former’s active, and the latter’s passive.

For every thing that maketh active is the stronger; and \[every thing\]
that is made active is the weaker.

The stronger, too, being in authority and free, doth lead; the
\[weaker\] follows \[as\] a slave.

8\. The energies, then, energize not only bodies that are ensouled, but
also \[bodies\] unensouled,

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —stocks,
stones, <span id="fr_107"></span>[1](#fn_107.md) and all such things;—both
making \[them\] to grow, and to bear fruits, and ripening \[them\],
dissolving, melting, rotting and crumbling \[them\], and setting up \[in
them\] all like activities which bodies without souls can undergo.

For energy’s <span id="fr_108"></span>[2](#fn_108.md) the name, O son, for
just the thing that’s going on,—that is becoming.

And many things needs must for ever be becoming; nay, rather, all things
\[must\].

For never is Cosmos bereft of any of existent things, but being
borne <span id="fr_109"></span>[3](#fn_109.md) for aye in its own self, it
bears existent things,—\[things\] that shall never cease from being
destroyed again. <span id="fr_110"></span>[4](#fn_110.md)

9\. Know, then, that energy of every kind is ever free from death,—no
matter what it is, or in what body.

And of the energies, some are of godly bodies, and some of those which
are corruptible; some \[are\] general, and some special. Some \[are\] of
genera, and some are of the parts of every genus.

The godly ones, \[accordingly\], are those that exercise their energies
through everlasting bodies. And these are perfect \[energies\], in that
\[they energize\] through perfect bodies.

But partial \[energies are\] those \[that energize\] through each one of
the \[single\] living things.

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

And special \[energies are those that energize\] through each one of
existent things.

10\. This argument, accordingly, O son, deduces that all things are full
of energies.

For though it needs must be that energies should be in bodies,—and there
be many bodies in the Cosmos,—I say that energies are many more than
bodies.

For often in one body there is \[found\] one, and a second and a third
\[activity\],—not counting in the general ones that come with it.

By general ones I mean the purely corporal ones, that exercise
themselves through the sensations <span id="fr_111"></span>[1](#fn_111.md)
and the motions \[of the body\].

For that without these energies the body \[of an animal\] can not
persist.

11\. The souls of men, however, have a second class of energies,—the
special ones \[that exercise themselves\] through arts, and sciences,
and practices, and \[purposed\] doings. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[2](#fn_112.md)

For that the feelings <span id="fr_113"></span>[3](#fn_113.md) follow on
the energies or rather are completions <span
id="fr_114"></span>[4](#fn_114.md) of the energies.

Know, then, O son, the difference of energy and of sensation.

\[Thus\] energy is sent down from above; whereas sensation, being in the
body and having its existence from it, receives the energy

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

and makes it manifest, as though it did embody it.

Wherefore I say sensations are both corporal and mortal, and last as
long as doth the body \[only\].

Nay, rather, its sensations are born together with the body, and they
die with it.

12\. But the immortal bodies in themselves have no sensation,—\[not even
an\] immortal \[one\], as though they were composed out of some essence
of some kind.

For that sensation doth arise entirely from naught else than either from
the bad or else the good that’s added to the body, or that is, on the
contrary, taken \[from it\] again.

But with eternal bodies there is no adding to nor taking from.

Wherefore, sensation doth not occur in them.

13\. *Tat*. Is, then, sensation felt in every body?

*Her*. In every body, son; and energies are active in all \[bodies,
too\].

*Tat*. Even in bodies without souls, O father \[mine\]?

*Her*. Even in them, O son. There are, however, differences in the
sensations.

The feelings of the rationals occur with reason; those of irrationals
are simply corporal; as for the things that have no soul, they \[also\]
have

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

sensations, but passive ones,—experience of increase \[only\] and
decrease. <span id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md)

Moreover, passion and sensation depend from one \[same\] head, <span
id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116.md) and they are gathered up again into the
same, and that, too, by the energies.

14\. Of lives <span id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117.md) with souls there are
two other energies which go with the sensations and the passions,—grief
and joy.

And without these, an ensouled life, and most of all a rational one,
could not experience sensation.

Wherefore, I say that there are forms of passions,—\[and\] forms that
dominate the rational lives more \[than the rest\].

The energies, then, are the active forces \[in sensations\], while the
sensations are the indications of the energies.

15\. Further, as these <span id="fr_118"></span>[4](#fn_118.md) are
corporal, they’re set in motion by the irrational parts of \[a man’s\]
soul; wherefore, I say that both of them are mischievous.

For that both joy, though \[for the moment\] it provides sensation
joined with pleasure, immediately becomes a cause of many ills <span
id="fr_119"></span>[5](#fn_119.md) to

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

him who feeleth it; while grief \[itself\] provides \[still\] greater
pains and suffering.

Wherefore, they both would seem \[most\] mischievous.

16\. *Tat*. Can, then, sensation be the same in soul and body, father
\[mine\]?

*Her*. How dost thou mean,—sensation in the soul, \[my\] son?

*Tat*. Surely it cannot be that soul’s incorporal, and that sensation is
a body, father,—sensation which is sometimes in a body and sometimes
not, \[just as the soul\]?

*Her*. If we should put it *in* a body, son, we should \[then\]
represent it as like the soul or \[like\] the energies. For that we say
these <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md) are incorporals in bodies.

But \[as\] sensation’s neither energy nor soul, nor any other thing than
body, according to what has been said above, it cannot, therefore, be
incorporal.

And if it’s not incorporal, it must be body.

For of existing things some must be bodies and the rest incorporal.

#### COMMENT

Again, as with the last excerpt, the earlier editions of Stobæus have
Asclepius and Tat as the persons of

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

the dialogue instead of Hermes and Tat. Wachsmuth gives them correctly.

The second sentence is of great interest, for it refers us presumably to
*C. H.*, x. (xi.), 22: “God’s rays, to use a figure, are his energies;
the Cosmos’s are natures; the arts and sciences are man’s.” Seeing,
however, that “The Key” is an Epitome of the General Sermons to Tat, the
statement may also have been made in one of these sermons.

In either case the existence of these General Sermons is presupposed,
and, therefore, it may be that our excerpt is, again, one of the
Expository Sermons to Tat.

The beginning of the Sermon has clearly been omitted by Stobæus, and
apparently the end also.
