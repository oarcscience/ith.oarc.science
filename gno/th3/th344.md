### JULIAN THE EMPEROR <span id="fr_785"></span>[1](#fn_785.md)

<span class="small">Text: *ap*. Cyril, *Contra Julianum*, v. 176; Migne,
col. 770 A. See also Neumann (C. I.), *Juliani Imperatoris Librorum
contra Christianos quæ supersunt* (Leipzig, 1880), p. 193. <span

##### THE DISCIPLES OF WISDOM

That God, however, has not cared for the Hebrews only, \[but rather\]
that in His love for all nations He hath bestowed on them \[*sc*. the
Hebrews\] nothing worth very serious attention, whereas He has given us
far greater and superior gifts, consider from what will follow. The
Egyptians, counting up of their own race the names of not a few sages,
can also say they have had many who have followed in the steps <span
id="fr_787"></span>[3](#fn_787.md) of Hermes. I mean of the Third Hermes
who used to come down <span id="fr_788"></span>[4](#fn_788.md) \[to them\]
in Egypt. The Chaldæans \[also can tell of\] the \[disciples\] of Oannes
and of Belus;

<span id="page_304">p. 304</span>

and the Greeks of tens of thousands \[who have the Wisdom\] from
Cheiron. <span id="fr_789"></span>[1](#fn_789.md) For it is from him that
they derived their initiation into the mysteries of nature, and their
knowledge of divine things; so that indeed \[in comparison\] the Hebrews
seem only to give themselves airs about their own \[attainments\].

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we learn from Julian that the Third Hermes, the Hermes presumably
of our Sermons, was known, by those initiated into the Gnosis, to be no
physical historical Teacher, but a Teaching Power or Person, who taught
from within spiritually.
