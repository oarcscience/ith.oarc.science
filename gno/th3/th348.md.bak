##### SOME PRESS NOTICES.

“Mr. Mead has done his work in a scholarly and painstaking
fashion.”—*The Guardian*.

“The ordinary student of Christian evidences, if he confines his reading
to the ‘Fathers,’ learns nothing of these opinions \[the so-called
Gnostic ‘heresies’\] except by way of refutation and angry condemnation.
In Mr. Mead's pages, however, they are treated with impartiality and
candour. . . . . These remarks will suffice to show the unique character
of this volume, and to indicate that students may find here matter of
great service to the rational interpretation of Christian
thought.”—*Bradford Observer*.

“Whatever may be the worth of the Gnostics’ speculations, there seems to
be little doubt that these early heretics, among whom were some deep
thinkers, as well as men of blameless character, have not been very
impartially dealt with by their orthodox opponents, and those who wish
to see their views treated in a more sympathetic way than has been usual
with ecclesiastical historians, will do well to read this able volume of
Mr. G. R. S. Mead. . . . . The book, Mr. Mead explains, is not intended
primarily for the student, but for the general reader, and it certainly
should not be neglected by anyone who is interested in the history of
early Christian thought.”—*The Scotsman*.

“The work is one of great labour and learning, and deserves study as a
sympathetic estimate of a rather severely-judged class of
heretics.”—*Glasgow Herald*.

“Written in a clear and elegant style. . . . . The bibliographies in the
volume are of world-wide range, and will be most valuable to students of
theosophy”—*Asiatic Quarterly*.

“Mr. Mead writes with precision and clearness on subjects usually
associated with bewildering technicalities and mystifications. Even the
long-suffering ‘general reader’ could go through this large volume with
pleasure. That is a great deal to say of a book on such a
subject.”—*Light*.

“This striking work will certainly be read not only with the greatest
interest in the select circle of the cultured, but by that much larger
circle of those longing to learn all about Truth. . . . . May be summed
up as an extraordinarily clear exposition of the Gnosis of the Saints
and the Sages of philosophic Christianity.”—*The Roman Herald*.

“Mr. Mead does us another piece of service by including a complete copy
of the Gnostic *Hymn of the Robe of Glory* . . . . and a handy epitome
of the *Pistis Sophia* is another item for which the student will be
grateful.”—*The Literary Guide.*

“The author has naturally the interest of a theosophist in Gnosticism,
and approaches the subject accordingly from a point of view different
from our own. But while his point of view emerges in the course of the
volume, this does not affect the value of his work for those who do not
share his special standpoint. . . . . Mr. Mead has at any rate rendered
us an excellent service, and we shall look forward with pleasure to his
future studies.”—*The Primitive Methodist Quarterly.*

“The writing of the present work has been a congenial task to Mr. Mead,
and he has brought to bear, lovingly and zealously, upon the portraiture
of the figure of Christ and of early Christianity all the knowledge
which a deep study of Oriental religions from their emotional side could
furnish. The book is published by the Theosophical Publishing Society,
and bears, of course, the marks of its associations; but it may be
stated at the outset that there is very little of what is commonly
regarded as the Theosophic method apparent in the work, which is the
product of a scholarly though, withal, very devotional spirit. . . . .
In his endeavour to realise the object which he has set himself, Mr.
Mead has traversed a wide field. . . . . In fine, we have in his volume
a bird's-eye view of the whole field

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

of early Gnosticism written for the general reader in a style and method
requiring no knowledge of the ancient tongues.”—*The Monist*.

“We are glad to see that the Theosophists. . . . . are settling down to
the study of religion. . . . . Though we do not appreciate their
fundamental philosophy, so far as we understand it, we think they may do
good work if they produce books like this of Mr. Mead—comprehensive,
interesting, and scholarly though evidently biassed. . . . . Readers not
familiar with the learned German works on Gnosticism will find here an
account of its varying phases and of the influences which helped to
produce it. The chapters entitled ‘Some Rough Outlines of the Background
of the Gnosis’ are well written, and they tend to focus the philosophic
and religious movement of the ancient world. . . . . There is a very
excellent bibliography.”—*The Spectator.*

“Mr. Mead, whose translation of the *Pistis Sophia* was a welcome boon,
gives us here ‘some short sketches among the Gnostics, mainly of the
first two centuries.’ Most readers, unless they are Theosophists, will
think them too long, and Mr. Mead's enthusiasm for the Forgotten Faith
of Gnosticism will remind them of the proverb: ‘The cow in the meadow,
knee deep in clover, often looks over the hedge and longs for the
common.’ . . . . Justice was not done to the Gnostics by their
opponents, and we cannot wonder. Moderns, like Harnack, however, have
tried to make amends, and Mr. Mead has done his best. We commend this
book to all who are tired of Christianity, and who want something deeper
than the Lord’s Prayer, more sublime than Paul’s hymn to Love, and more
practical than the Sermon on the Mount.”—*The Christian World*.

“Mr. Mead is a sympathetic student, and regards the theosophists, of
whom he is one, as the inheritors, more or less, of the ‘Knowledge’ of
the early Gnostics, who, while anathematised as heretics, powerfully
influenced the thought of the Christian Church in its earlier centuries.
Mr. Mead is as far removed from the received orthodoxy as the men whose
speculations he discusses.”—*The Manchester Guardian.*

“L’opera, cui l’autore dà modestamenti il nome di *Brevi studi*, è
invero il frutto di dotte e pazientissime ricerche, di vasta e profunda
erudizione; è d’interesse grande per il soggetto che tratta ed è
accessibile anche a chi non sia uno studioso di religione comparata od
un teologo, per la maniera abile e piacevole con cui il sogetto è
trattato. L’autore stesso spiega perchè volle cosi l’opera sua con
queste parole: ‘poichè io stimo tal sogetto di profundo interesse umano
e non di mera importanza accademica.’ Il libro, che vide la luce proprio
all’ alba del nuovo secolo, risponde ad un bisogno del memento o,
meglio, risponde ad un bisogno che sempre si è fatto e si farà sentire,
ma che mai forse come nell’ epocha presente ebbe fra noi tanta
intensita.”—*La Nuova Parola*.

##### SOME PRESS OPINIONS.

“Mr. Mead is already favourably known to scholars as a well-informed
writer on the origins of religion. His particular province of study is
that which passes by the name of ‘occult’—a word that may be little more
than a euphemism for our ignorance. . . . Mr. Mead’s work is careful,
scholarly, and critical, yet deeply sympathetic with those spiritual
ideals of life which are far greater than all the creeds. . . . . Will
be found very useful to English readers.”—*Bradford Observer*.

“With much that Mr. Mead says about Apollonius we are entirely disposed
to agree.”—*Spectator*.

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

“Mr. Mead’s sympathetic monograph is based upon a careful study of the
literature of the subject. . . . . Writes with moderation, and has
rendered good service by examining Apollonius from a fresh point of
view.”—*Manchester Guardian*.

“We give a specially cordial welcome to Mr. G. R. S. Mead’s ‘Apollonius
of Tyana. . . . . It is a book which all well-instructed spiritualists
will be able to appreciate and understand.”—*Light*.

“A charming and enlightening little work, full of knowledge, bright with
sympathy, and masterly in style.”—*The Coming Day*.

“It is not only interesting, it is fair, and to a great degree
scholarly, although it is slight and popular in conception. The spirit
and tone are admirable. Mr. Mead neither flouts what he thinks mistaken
nor states uncritically what he believes. . . . . He uses his
authorities with care and judgment, and gives exact references. Some
good suggestions are made in the book.”—*Literature*.

“Through this jungle of fable, controversy, and misunderstanding, Mr.
Mead has heroically set himself to cut his way to the man as he was.
Practically he regards him as a theosophist of the first century, who
had been initiated into the loftier orders and commissioned to
regenerate the cults at many of the larger sanctuaries. The author has
studied the original authorities carefully, and also the work of his
predecessors. It is, of course, impossible to say whether his attempt to
get back to the real Apollonius has been successful. In most respects
his account is plausible, and quite possibly may represent the
facts. . . . . At any rate, impartial students will be grateful for his
sympathetic vindication of Apollonius from the too frequent charge that
he was nothing better than a charlatan. He thinks that Apollonius must
surely have visited some of the Christian societies, and have met with
Paul, if not earlier, at least at Rome in 66. It seems to us very
problematical that he should have taken any interest in the Christians,
though the probability would be much enhanced if Mr. Mead’s view of
primitive Christianity could be substantiated.”—*The Primitive Methodist
Quarterly Review*.

“Students of the religious history of the earlier centuries of the
Christian era are already indebted to Mr. Mead for his elucidations of
more than one obscure document of that remote age. His account of
Apollonius of Tyana will be all the more welcome because, treating its
subject without theological or denominational prepossessions, it reveals
the ancient philosopher in a new light, which may very well be also a
true one. . . . . Mr. Mead gives a readable and well-studied account of
him, reviewing what little remains known of his life, and inquiring,
without controversy, what must have been the character of one who had so
real an influence on the religious life of his time. . . . . The book is
rich in suggestions of the actualities of the religious life of the
ancient world when Christianity was still in its infancy. It is well
worthy of the attention of all who are interested in the subject.”—*The
Scotsman*.

“This little book is an attempt to tell us all that is definitely known
of one of the most extraordinary figures in history. . . . It is done in
the main with absolute impartiality, and with considerable learning. It
is not a satisfactory book, but it is useful and interesting, and, in
default of anything better, it may be recommended.”—*Saturday Review*.

“The task Mr. Mead has set himself is to recover from Philostratus’
highly romantic narrative the few facts which can be really known, and
to present to the public a plain and simple story which shall accord
with the plain and simple life of the humble Tyanean; and he has
achieved no little success. His book is thoroughly readable, the manner
of writing most attractive, and his enthusiasm evidently
sincere. . . . . Mr. Mead’s last work is a thoroughly scholarly one, and
he has contributed a very valuable page to philosophical
history.”—*Chatham and Rochester Observer*.

“Mr. Mead’s works are always worth reading. They are characterised by
clearness, sanity, and moderation; they are scholarly, and are always
conceived in a profoundly religious spirit. The bibliographies are
excellent. With Mr. Mead’s workmanship we have only one fault to find.
In order to give elevation to the utterances of his hero, he not only
affects poetical expressions—which is permissible—and poetical
inversions of speech—which are not permissible—but he indulges in a
whole page of irregular blank verse. Mr. Mead is master of an excellent
prose style, and Pegasus is a sorry hack when Pegasus goes
lame.”—*Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society*.

“This well-written volume affords a critical study of the only existing
record of the life of Apollonius of Tyana. . . . . His principles, his
mode of teaching, his travels in the east and in the south and west, his
mode of life, his sayings, letters, and writings and bibliographical
notes, are all set forth in a clear and interesting style.”—*Asiatic
Quarterly Review*.

“Verfasser will auf Grund der philostratischen Biographie ein Bild vom
Leben und Wirken des Apollonius geben. Es fehlt ihm dazu nich an
besonnenen Urteil, eben so wenig an der nötigen Belesenheit in der
einschlägigen Litteratur. . . . . Verf. hält sich auch, obwohl offenbar
selbst Theologe, frei von der theologischen Voreingenommenheit, die bei
der Beurteilung des Apollonius so früh und so lange Unheil gestiftet
hat.”—*Wochenschrift fur klassische Philologie*.

Ὁ κ. Mead γράφει λίαν γλαφυρῶς, πραγματεύεται δὲ τὸ θέμα του κριτικώτατα
καὶ μετὰ μεγάλης νουνεχείας καὶ δίδει ἡμῖν οὕτω τὴν ἀξιοπιστοτέραν
εἰκόνα τοῦ ἀνδρὸς.—*Erevna.*

##### SOME PRESS NOTICES.

“A clear, intelligent, and interesting account of the history of the
development of Biblical criticism . . . . a thoughtful and learned, yet
readable book, which well deserves the attention of readers interested
in its subject.”—*The Scotsman*.

“Mr. Mead begins with a sketch of the recent progress of Biblical
criticism. The tone is not altogether what one would wish—the
‘Conservatives’ were, after all, fighting for what they held to be very
precious—but it is substantially true.”—*Spectator*.

“Mr. Mead describes his book as ‘a study in the most recent results of
the higher and the lower criticism.’ The description is incomplete
rather than inadequate, for the study is made from a neo-Gnostic point
of view, and under neo-Gnostic prepossessions. . . . Mr. Mead has shown,
in previous volumes, how the fascinating glamour of their writings has
attracted him, and, though they are mainly represented by imperfect but
suggestive fragments, he has done his best to reconstruct them and to
revive, where possible, their lingering vitality. His work, on these
lines, has met with due appreciation. . . . . He regards Gnosticism as a
suppressed religion which may yet result in an all-embracing creed,
which will combine and focus the scattered rays now dispersed abroad
among divergent faiths.”—*Sheffield Daily Telegraph*.

“In his modest preamble the author describes himself as neither
scientist nor theologian, but as ‘a friendly spectator, who, as a
devoted lover of both science and religion, has no partisan interest to
serve, and, as a believer in the blessings of that true tolerance which
permits perfect liberty in all matters of opinion and belief, has no
desire to dictate to others what their decision should be on any one of
the many controversial points touched upon.’ Further on he strongly
advises the ‘disturbed’ reader, ‘who fears to plunge deeper into the
free waters of criticism,’ to ‘leave the matter alone, and content
himself with the creeds and cults of the churches.’ We, therefore,
cannot complain if in the sequel he puts forth conclusions widely
different from those generally held, even in this ‘advanced’ age, by the
average thoughtful student. He claims to treat the subject ‘without fear
or favour,’ and, while disclaiming the ‘ultra-rationalism’ of the
‘extreme school’ of criticism, he nevertheless ‘feels himself compelled
largely to accept the proofs brought forward of the unhistorical nature
of much in the Gospel narratives, and also the main positions in all
subjects of Gospel criticism which do not involve a mystical or
practical religious element.’ As a theosophist, he seems to have a
peculiar affection, on mystical grounds, for the fourth Gospel, which,
however, he sees fit to class with Hermes Trismegistus. It would be far
too elaborate a task to attempt to deal with the details of his argument
here. Its results claim to be based on Nestle’s deservedly popular work.
Anyone who wishes to see Nestle theosophically interpreted may well read
Mr. Mead’s lucid and interesting pages for himself. . . . . There are
many other points we should criticise if we had space. But there are
many points, on the other hand, which call for hearty commendation; not
least, Mr. Mead’s crusade against book-worship.”—*The Guardian*.

“This work consists of various chapters which have appeared from time to
time in a Review devoted to the study of religion from an entirely
independent point of view, and perused by a class of readers belonging
to many Churches of Christendom, to schools or sects of Brahmanism,
Buddhism, Mohammedanism, Zoroastrianism, and others who follow no
religion. The author considers that the controversies which have been
waged under the term of the ‘Higher Criticism’ have almost exclusively
been that of progressive knowledge of physical facts (natural,
historical, and literary) and the conservatism of theological
traditional views, and never, at any time, between Science and Religion
in their true meaning.”—*Asiatic Quarterly Review*.

“While Mr. Mead is thus in general agreement with the extreme left wing
in criticism, he is very far from adopting their rationalistic point of
view. . . . . As to dates, the author assigns all the Gospels to the
reign of Hadrian. The phenomena of the Synoptic

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gospels, he
thinks, point to concerted effort, and he believes that they were
written in Egypt. It is not surprising that he lays much stress on
Gnosticism, but he has no wish to revive it. He rather pleads that we
should study it with a view to recovering precious truths that have been
lost. The book is written in a pleasant style, and we have read it with
interest, but we cannot regard it as Mr. Mead’s most successful
effort.”—*The Primitive Methodist Quarterly*.

“This anlysis of the ‘Gospels,’ however, is preliminary to a vindication
of that eternal ‘Gospel’ which lies beneath all such literature. Mr.
Mead contends that this Gospel may be discovered in Gnostic writings
which were condemned by the early Christian Church as heresies. He
admits freely that the forms of the ancient ‘Gnosis’ cannot now be
revived, but he finds in the popular Evangelical doctrine of the living
Christ an adumbration of the ancient wisdom of the condemned Gnostics.
But the Christ of Mr. Mead’s teaching is one of a sacred brotherhood,
including Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, and other great enlighteners of
the race. These are all living spiritual energies, inspiring and guiding
mankind in its toilsome quest for truth and righteousness. Readers will
find in Mr. Mead’s thoughtful and scholarly pages much that will help in
that rational and spiritual reconstruction which is the great religious
task of the hour.”—*Yorkshire Daily Observer*.

##### SOME PRESS NOTICES.

“A close and learned investigation. . . . . Mr. Mead is a theosophical
scholar whose previous works dealing with Gnosticism and Gospel
criticism are of some value not only to theosophists, but to
theologians.”—*The Times*.

“On the examination of these little known tales Mr. Mead expends an
amount of patience, labour, and learning which the ordinary man . . . .
would deem ridiculous. Happily, however, the world is not yet peopled
exclusively with fat, plump, commonplace people, and those who follow
Mr. Mead can be sure of reward in matter which will set them
thinking. . . . These researches are contributions to the study of the
origins of Christianity, and their uniqueness lies in the fact that very
few writers ever enter the fields where Mr. Mead works with such
praiseworthy diligence. The ordinary reader trusts too implicitly, in
these matters, to his Geikie and his Farrar, and even the student who
has the dash of the heretic in him is too easily contented with his
Renan. For both these classes of readers Mr. Mead’s chapters will open
up new fields of thought. The reader will find himself in the midst of
those fierce fanaticisms, and weird, occult theosophies which were part
of the atmosphere in which infant Christianity grew. Without an adequate
acquaintance with these, Christian origins cannot be understood. This
knowledge Mr. Mead’s readers will obtain if they follow him closely, and
their view of the beginnings of Christianity will be correspondingly
full and true.”—*The Yorkshire Daily Observer*.

“Mr. Mead’s previous wanderings in historic by-ways have resulted in
much curious lore associated with Gnosticism and the Neo-Platonists, and
he seems to have been attracted to this adjacent field as one likely to
contain hidden treasure. . . . . For those who desire an introduction to
this branch of literature, Mr. Mead has made it easily accessible.”—*The
Sheffield Daily Telegraph*.

“Written by a professed theosophist, this work is yet entirely free from
the taint of dogmatism of any kind. It is indeed a valuable contribution
to the literature on the subject, which is as abundant as it is chaotic.
The author has collected and reviewed this mass, and has summarised and
criticised it until he has shaped it into something of a coherent whole.
The Rabbinical and other Hebrew legendary and historical matter dealing
with the reputed origin and life of the Messiah is carefully sifted, and
the subject is approached with befitting reverence. . . . . That the
book is most valuable from a suggestive point of view cannot be denied.
It merits the attention of all interested in Christian criticism.”—*The
Scotsman*.

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

“This book, with its remarkable title, deals in a very critical spirit
with the origins of Christianity. . . . Although critical in the highest
degree, the author does not dogmatise, and preserves a philosophical
calm thought.”—*The Chatham and Rochester Observer*.

“The author of this learned work is not propounding a mere theological
riddle, nor can he be said to be coming forward wantonly merely to
increase the number of puzzles that confront the student of Christian
origins. . . . . The author has been a very diligent student of the
Talmud, and perhaps his lengthened account of that extraordinary body of
traditions is one of the best in our language. . . . . The argument
throughout is marked by great erudition and remarkable modesty.”—*The
Glasgow Herald*.

“The question is not a fool’s question. It is serious, and Mr. Mead
takes it seriously.”—*The Expository Times*.

“Mr. Mead has done much first-rate work, on untraditional lines, in
early Church history, and has propounded theorems of which a good deal
more will be heard. He always writes as a scholar, with complete
avoidance of infelicities of theological utterance such as too often
have handicapped suggestive heterodoxies.”—*The Literary World.*

“The materials for the further pursuit of the inquiry are all brought
together in this volume, and the author is at very evident pains to hold
the balance carefully as between the different authorities whom he
quotes. He has read everything of any importance that has been published
relating to the subject of which he treats. He is evidently a very
widely read man, and is possessed of much critical acumen, as also of
all the best qualifications of historical inquiry and original research.
The work will, we doubt not, be largely read by Christian
theologians.”—*The Asiatic Quarterly Review*.

“This is the fifth book by Mr. Mead that we have had the pleasure of
bringing before our readers. In our notices of his earlier volumes we
have been glad to recognise, whether we agreed with him or not, the
learning, the earnestness, the scientific method, and the deep religious
spirit by which they have been animated. The title of the present volume
will, we anticipate, cause many readers to regard it as a piece of
cranky speculation. . . . It is not, however, a work to be dismissed
with a mere shrug of the shoulders. . . . Mr. Mead has brought out not
simply an interesting but a valuable work, even apart from the special
thesis which he investigates.”—*The Primitive Methodist Quarterly
Review*.

“I would direct the attention of educated scholarly men to a very
remarkable book . . . . written by G. R. S. Mead. . . . . I invite our
educated and serious-minded Protestant clergymen everywhere to read this
book and tell me, privately, what they think about it.”—Standish O’
Grady, in *The All Ireland Review*.

“A much more remarkable collection of apocrypha is the subject of a
curious book by Mr. Mead, known to the small public who are interested
in such things as learned in the fantasies of Gnosticism. . . . . We
have not often read a learned book from which we dissent so widely with
more genuine interest, and we are bound to recognise the dignified and
scholarly fashion in which Mr. Mead puts forward his theses, strange and
Impossible as some of them seem to us to be.—*The Pilot*.

##### SOME PRESS OPINIONS.

“The ‘Pistis Sophia’ has long been recognised as one of the most
important Gnostic documents we possess, and Mr. Mead deserves the
gratitude of students of Church History and of the History of Christian
Thought, for his admirable translation and edition of this curious
Gospel.”—*Glasgow Herald*.

“Mr. Mead has done a service to other than Theosophists by his
translation of the, ‘Pistis Sophia.’ This curious work has not till
lately received the attention which it deserves. . . . . He has prefixed
a short Introduction, which includes an excellent bibliography. Thus,
the English reader is now in a position to judge for himself of the
scientific value of the only Gnostic treatise of any considerable length
which has come down to us.”—*Guardian*.

“From a scholar’s point of view the work is of value as illustrating the
philosophico-mystical tendencies of the second century.”—*Record*.

“Mr. Mead deserves thanks for putting in an English dress this curious
document from the early ages of Christian philosophy.”—*Manchester
Guardian.*
