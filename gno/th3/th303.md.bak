#### EXCERPT II.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[OF THE INEFFABILITY OF GOD\]

<span class="small">(I have added the title, the excerpt not being found
in Patrizzi.</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Flor*., lxxx. \[lxxviii.\] 9, under
the heading: “Of Hermes from the \[Book\] to Tat”; G. iii. 135; M. iii.
104, 105. <span id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. x. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” p. 256.)</span>

\[*Her*.\] To understand <span id="fr_51"></span>[2](#fn_51.md) God is
difficult, to speak \[of Him\] impossible.

For that the Bodiless can never be expressed in body, the Perfect never
can be comprehended by that which is imperfect, and that ’tis difficult
for the Eternal to company with the ephemeral.

The one is for ever, the other doth pass; the one is in \[the clarity
of\] Truth, the other in the shadow of appearance.

So far off from the stronger \[is\] the weaker,

<span id="page_15">p. 15</span>

the lesser from the greater \[is so far\], as \[is\] the mortal \[far\]
from the Divine.

It is the distance, then, between the two that dims the Vision of the
Beautiful.

For ’tis with eyes that bodies can be seen, with tongue that things seen
can be spoken of; but That which hath no body, that is unmanifest, and
figureless, and is not made objective \[to us\] out of matter,—cannot be
comprehended by our sense.

I have it in my mind, O Tat, I have it in my mind, that what cannot be
spoken of, is God.

#### COMMENTARY

Justin Martyr quotes these opening words of our excerpt *verbatim*,
assigning them to Hermes (*Cohort*., 38; Otto, ii. 122). <span
id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md)

The substance of the second sentence is given twice by Lactantius in
Latin (*Div. Institt*., ii. 8; Ep. 4); in the second passage the Church
Father also quotes verbatim the first sentence of our excerpt, and from
his introductory words we learn that they were the *beginning* of a
written sermon from Hermes to his son (Tat).

The first four sentences are also quoted in almost identical words
(there being two variants of reading and two slight additions) by
Cyril,—*Contra Julianum*, i. 31 (Migne, col. 549 B), who, moreover,
gives some additional lines, beginning (Frag. xi.): “If, then, there be
an incorporeal eye,” etc.

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

If, furthermore, we are right in supposing that Frag. xv. (Cyril,
*ibid*., i. 33) is from the same sermon, then this sermon is the “First
Sermon of the Expository \[Sermons\] to Tat,” and the Stobæan heading,
“From the \[Book\] to Tat,” will mean the collection of Expository
Sermons (see Comment, on Frag. xv.).
