### AN ATTEMPT AT CLASSIFYING THE EXTANT LITERATURE

<span class="smallcaps">Before</span> we proceed to append our
concluding remarks, it will be as well to set down some attempt at
classifying our extant sermons and fragments. Unfortunately, however,
this cannot be done in any scientific manner, owing to the fact that the
literature, even were it fully before us, would be found to be too
chaotic. Indeed, even with our fragmentary information concerning it, we
are acquainted with no less than four unrelated Corpora—those that lay
before Lactantius, Cyril, and Stobæus, and our own imperfect Corpus of
Byzantine tradition. There must also have been other Corpora or
collections, as, for instance, the books that Jamblichus used, not to
mention the ancient body of MSS. which lay before Petosiris and
Nechepso.

##### OF HERMES

First and foremost, standing in a class by itself, must be placed:

C. H. i.—“The Pœmandres.”

This is the fundamental Gospel of the School, the Self-instruction of
the Hermes-or Master-grade.

With it, as based upon it in general type, though not in form, must be
taken:

C. H. xi. (xii.).—“Mind unto Hermes.”

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

This is of later date, but still it must have been comparatively early,
for it introduces the Æon-doctrine, which must be early, and is the
esoteric instruction on the doctrines laid down in C. H*.* iv. (v.)—“The
Cup”—which was perhaps regarded as the most important sermon after “The
Pœmandres.”

Of the lost early literature we can get no clear indication; it may,
however, be mentioned that the “Sayings of Agathodaimon” referred to in
the Tat Sermon, C. H*.* xii. (xiii.), probably belonged to the most
archaic deposit of the Trismegistic literature, and may be compared with
the “Sayings of Ammon” mentioned by Justin Martyr. These belonged,
presumably, originally solely to the Hermes-grade.

With the same type as the conclusion of the “Pœmandres” in its present
form, that is to say with a later development, we must classify:

> C. H. iii. (iv.).—“The Sacred Sermon”; and  
> C. H*.* vii. (viii).—“Whither stumble ye.”

Here also, for lack of a more satisfactory heading, we must place:

> Ex. xxii.—“An Apophthegm of Hermes.”  
> Ex. xxiv.—“A Hymn of the Gods.”  
> Frag. xxvi.—From “The Inner Door.”  
> Frag. xxvii—“For Our Mind saith.”

The last being probably from one of the oldest deposits of the
literature.

The next most convenient heading for classification is that under which
we can place the greatest number of pieces, namely:

##### TO TAT

We know that the Tat-instruction was divided into

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (*a*) “The General
Sermons,” of which C. H*.* x. (xi.)—“The Key”—is said to be the epitome
or rather summation; and (*b*) “The Expository Sermons,” of which C. H.
xiii. (xiv.)—“The Secret Sermon on the Mountain”—was the consummation.

It is, of course, not certain whether the Tat Sermons were divided
simply into these two classes, for though we are certain in a number of
instances that we are dealing with an extract from an Expository Sermon,
we are often in doubt when the heading is only “From the Sermon,” or
“Sermons to Tat,” how to classify it. We do not know how many General
Sermons there may have been, or whether they were divided into Books as
were the Expository Sermons and the “To Asclepius,” at anyrate in the
Corpus of Cyril. For convenience of classification, however, we may
consider, though perfectly arbitrarily, that all the sermons and
fragments which cannot fall under the heading of “Expository” may be
treated as “General.”

*The General Sermons*

> C. H. (ii.).—“The General Sermon.” <span
> id="fr_792"></span>[1](#fn_792.md)  
> C. H. viii (ix.).—“That No One of Existing Things do Perish.”  
> Ex. x.—“Concerning the Rule of Providence.” <span
> id="fr_793"></span>[2](#fn_793.md)  
> Ex. xi.—“Of Justice.” <span id="fr_794"></span>[3](#fn_794.md)  
> Ex. xx.—“The Power of Choice.”  
> Fragg. vi and vii.  
> C. H. x. (xi.).—“The Key.”

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

This last is stated to be the epitome or summation of “The General
Sermons.” It is addressed to both Asclepius and Tat, and is to be taken
in connection with “The Perfect Sermon.”

*The Expository Sermons*

Of these there were in the Corpus of Cyril three Books—to the First of
which are assigned:

> Fragg. xx. (?), xxii., xxiii., xxiv.  
> Ex. ii. and Fragg. iii., xi., xii., xv. <span
> id="fr_795"></span>[1](#fn_795.md)

To be assigned to “The Expository Sermons” in general without any
clearer indications:

> Exx. iii. (?).—“Of Truth.” <span id="fr_796"></span>[2](#fn_796.md)  
> Ex. iv. <span id="fr_797"></span>[3](#fn_797.md)  
> Exx. v., vi., vii., viii., ix. <span id="fr_798"></span>[4](#fn_798.md)  
> Ex. i.—“Of Piety and True Philosophy.” <span
> id="fr_799"></span>[5](#fn_799.md)

From the Corpus Hermeticum we may conjecturally assign the following to
this class:

> C. H. iv. (v.).—“The Cup.” <span id="fr_800"></span>[6](#fn_800.md)  
> C. H. v. (vi.).—“Though Manifest.”  
> C. H. vii. (viii.).—“About the Common Mind.” <span
> id="fr_801"></span>[7](#fn_801.md)

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

Finally, the whole course of these “Expository Sermons” is consummated
by what we may call “The Initiation of Tat”:

C. H. xiii. (xiv.).—“The Secret Sermon on the Mountain.”

We next pass on to what Cyril calls the “To Asclepius,” of which, as of
“The Expository Sermons, there were in his Corpus at least Three Books.

##### TO ASCLEPIUS

In our Corpus Hermeticum the following are assigned to Asclepius:

> C. H. ii. (iii.). “An Introduction to the Gnosis of the Nature of All
> Things.”  
> C. H. vi. (vii.).—“In God Alone is Good.”  
> C. H*.* ix. (x.).—“About Sense.” <span
> id="fr_802"></span>[1](#fn_802.md)  
> C. H. xiv. (xv.).—“A Letter to Asclepius.” <span
> id="fr_803"></span>[2](#fn_803.md)

From the “To Asclepius” in Cyril’s collection we have:

Frag. xxv. (?).

And definitely from the Third “To Asclepius”:

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

Fragg. xvi.-xviii.

In this Third Book it is probable that “The Perfect Sermon” was included
in Cyril’s Corpus. This sermon, which is the longest we possess, was
evidently originally addressed to Asclepius alone, for its alternative
title is *par excellence* “The Asclepius,” and my conjecture that the
introduction of the “holy three”—Asclepius, Tat and Ammon—is due to a
later editor, is amply borne out by all the evidence. We may thus well
conclude our list with:

“The Perfect Sermon.”

For the fragments of the lost Greek original of this important tractate,
see Lactantius:

Fragg. v., viii., ix., x.

This Sermon is to be taken in close connection with “The Key” which sums
up “The General Sermons” to Tat.

##### TO AMMON

Stobæus ascribes eight of his extracts to a Book or Books of his
collection entitled “To Ammon.” These excerpts, however, would seem to
be more appropriately classified under “Sermons to Tat.” As, however,
Johannes distinctly so describes them, we will append them here.

> Exx. xii, xiii.  
> Exx. xiv.-xix.—“Of Soul,” i.-vi.

Exx. xvi.-xix. follow one another in the text of the Excerpts by
Stobæus; as Ex. xviii., however, refers to “The General Sermons,” it
therefore would make us suppose that either we are here dealing with
“The Expository Sermons” to Tat, or that the Ammon-grade had already had
communicated to them “The General Sermons.”

The above are the four types of Trismegistic Sermons

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

proper, and we next turn to the writings of the Disciples of Hermes.

##### OF ASCLEPIUS

It is remarkable that Asclepius, the most learned of the Three, writes
his treatises and letters, not to philosophers or priests, or students,
nor yet to his younger brother Tat—but invariably to the King or to
Kings. He invariably writes to “Ammon”; and the once existing literature
of this class was a very rich one, if we can believe the writer or
redactor of C. H*.* (xvi.). The fragments that remain, however, are by
no means numerous, and include:

> C. H. (xvi.).—“The Definitions of Asclepius.” <span
> id="fr_804"></span>[1](#fn_804.md)  
> Frag. iv.—Probably from the lost ending of above.  
> C. H. (xvii.).—“Of Asclepius to the King.” <span
> id="fr_805"></span>[2](#fn_805.md)  
> Ex. xxi. (?)—which may, perhaps, be more correctly headed “Of
> Asclepius to the King” instead of with Stobæus “Of Isis to Horus.”

To neither Tat nor Ammon are tractates assigned; for when Tat is
perfected he becomes in his turn Hermes, and so writes as Hermes, while
Ammon is the man of action and affairs who does not teach. May we
further from these phenomena conclude that “Asclepius” was the man who
was skilled in theory and intellectual grasp, but was not capable of
direct illumination as was Tat?

The next class of literature falls under the heading:

##### OF ISIS

Whether or not the forms of this literature which we possess are
contemporaneous with or later than

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

the Tat and Asclepius Sermons, we cannot say; but in any case they are
based on ancient types—the “Books of Isis to Horus.” To this type we
assign:

Ex. xxi.—“Of Isis to Horus.”

Though, as we have suggested above, this is an error of Johannes, and
should be rather “Of Asclepius to the King.”

Ex. xxiii.—“From Aphrodite.”

Where Aphrodite probably equates with Isis.

> Exx. xxv., xxvi.—“The Virgin of the World.”  
> Ex. xxvii.—“From the Sermon of Isis to Horus.”

The remaining class of literature is connected with the name of Osiris
as the Disciple of Agathodaimon, the Thrice-greatest, and may be headed
as:

##### FROM THE AGATHODAIMON LITERATURE

Our fragments are all taken from Cyril’s Corpus, and are referred to by
him under the heading “To Asclepius.” We have, however, not included
them under this heading in our tentative classification, because they
are plainly not addressed to Asclepius, but belong to a quite different
form of literature, most probably throwing back to an ancient type of
the same nature as the “Books of Isis.” To this class are to be
assigned:

Fragg. xiii., xiv., xix., xxi.

This form may be perhaps more appropriately taken with the “Sayings of
Agathodaimon” and the “Sayings of Ammon” as Agathodaimon; both of which
pertain to the oldest types of the Trismegistic literature.

Finally, we add the appendix to our Corpus written by a Pœmandrist
rhetor and apologist:

C. H. (xviii.).—“The Encomium of Kings.”

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> This may be taken
with the quotation from the editor of Cyril’s Corpus of XV. Books.

And so we come to the end of our tentative classification; with the full
conviction, however, that as no one at the time when the literature was
extant in a number of Corpora and collections of all sorts attempted to
classify it, so now that we have only the flotsam and jetsam of this
once abundantly rich cargo before us, no inventory can be made that is
of the slightest scientific value, and we can at best offer the reader a
few sorted heaps of *disjecta membra* of varying dates.

##### OF JUDGMENTS OF VALUE

We now approach the conclusion of our task, but with the feeling that
the whole matter should be put aside for years before any attempt be
made to set down any judgments of value. We are as yet too much involved
in a maze of details to be able to extricate ourselves into the clear
space in which we can walk at ease round the labyrinth and view it from
a general and detached point of view.

Nevertheless, we will endeavour to set down some general impressions of
our experiences in the labyrinth—of the many windings we have had to
traverse, and the many places with no way out into which we have been
led by following the paths of history and criticism; out of which there
has been time and again no egress, even when holding fast to the thread
of light woven out of the illuminating rays of the doctrines of the
tradition.

It is indeed a difficult task to stand with the feet of the mind set
firm on the surface of objectivity, and with the head and heart of it in
the heights and depths of the subjective and unmanifest. And yet this
almost superhuman task is the Great Work set before every scholar of the
Gnosis—the man who would think truly

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

and judge justly, viewing the matter from all standpoints, and
appraising it from without and within, from above and below,
endeavouring to unite centre and circumference in a blended intuitional
sense that transcends our divided senses and intellect.

The Trismegistic literature is scripture, and to its understanding we
must bring all and every faculty that the best minds of to-day are
bringing to bear upon the special scripture which each one may believe
to be the most precious legacy from the Past to the Present.

Now the application of what is called “criticism” to scripture is the
wielding of a two-edged sword; this sword is not only two-edged, but it
is fiery. If it is rightly used, it will disperse the hosts of error and
hew a path into the Paradise of Truth; but if it is wrongly used, it
will react on the daring soul that attempts to grasp it, and he will
find in it the flaming brand in the hands of the Angel-Warden that keeps
him from the Gate of Heaven.

Criticism, which is regarded with such fear and trembling by some, and
is sneered at and despised by others, is the sword that the Christ has
brought on earth in these latter days. There is now war in the members
of the faithful, war within them, such war as they cannot escape, if God
has given them a mind with which to reason. Every man of intelligence
who loves his own special scripture, is keenly aware of the war within
his members—head against heart and heart against head, form against
substance and substance against form. This is keenly felt by those who
love their own special Bible; but how few can enter into the feelings of
another who loves with equal fervour some other Bible? Who can be really
fair to any other man’s religion? And by this we do not mean an
absolutely lifeless indifference, in which the head

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

alone is concerned—for there are not a few men of this type who deal
with the comparative science of religion—but a lively sympathy that
knows that the other man’s religion is the highest thing on earth for
him, and the light-giving revelation of God’s Wisdom.

##### THE SONS OF GOD

In treating of the “Religion of the Mind,” of the Gnosis of
Thrice-greatest Hermes, I have endeavoured to enter into it as I
conceive the Disciples of that Way entered into it, with love and
reverence. I would do the same with any other of the Great Religions of
Humanity (and have done so in some cases), if I desired fervently, all
prejudices and predilections apart, I will not say, to understand it—for
what mortal mind can grasp the Divine Revelation in any of its Great
Forms?—but to share, however imperfectly, in its illumination. Now, this
attitude of mind and love of God and man is strongly deprecated by those
who fear to stand accused of lack of loyalty to their own particular
form of that Great Form of Faith which God has given for their guidance.
The one object of their enquiries into other Great Forms of Faith is to
“prove” that their own small form of the Great Form to which they give
allegiance, is the end of all ends, and the highest of all heights, and
that the other countless forms are of the Enemy of their God. My God, or
rather God, for He is the Father of all, has no enemies; He has many
sons, all brethren, and loves them equally even though they refuse to
believe Him. There is but one Religion, its Great Forms are many, the
forms of these Forms are innumerable, as many as are the individual
minds and hearts of men, and the many hearts and minds of individual
man.

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

And here I would set forth my present all-insufficient notion of the
Great Form of Religion known as Christianity, for there will doubtless
be some who read these volumes who will accuse me of I know not what
attitude other than that of their own to that Faith.

My faith in the Master of Christendom is unbounded; I dare not limit it
or qualify it—for that Master is for me the Mind of all master-hood,
Pœmandres Himself. For how can any small mind of man dare to limit the
Illimitable, the Mystery of all mysteries, that enfolded Jesus the
Christ, and Gautama the Buddha, and Zoroaster the Mage, and Lao-tze the
Sage, and Orpheus the Bard, and Pythagoras the Philosopher, and Hermes
the Gnostic, and all and every Master and Master of masters? Do I
detract from the transcendency of Jesus the Christ, when I mention His
Brethren, all Sons of God? I do not, for the Sons of God are not
separate and apart, set over one against the other; they are all one
Sonship of the Father, and these apparent differences must be left to
those who think themselves wise enough to judge between them—instructed
enough to know the within of the matter as well as the without, which in
no case has come down to us in any but the most fragmentary and
erroneous tradition. I do not know; I dare not judge those who are
Judges of the quick and dead. And so I leave this audacity to those who
would forget the *logos* of their Saviour: “Judge not.”

If, nevertheless, I am still judged as a “calumniator” by some, it is
but natural injustice and quite understandable. There is, however, no
real Injustice in the universe, and he who would be Justified and rise
again with Osiris, must balance mortal seeming justice and injustice to
reach the true equilibrium, and so be free of mortal opinion, and stand
in the Hall of Truth. It is to the bar of this Judgment Hall that all
men in

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

the last resort appeal, whether they be born Christian or Mahommedan,
Brāhman or Jew, Buddhist or Taoist, Zoroastrian or Pagan—or whether they
be born to a manner of faith that is none of these, or to an ideal of
faith that includes them all.

Christianity is the Faith of the Western World—the Faith most suited to
it in nature and in form. He who gave that Faith, gave in fullest
abundance through many sources; and the greatest sign of His authority,
of His *authentia*, was the throwing open of some part of the age-long
secret mystery-teaching to the many without distinction of age, sex,
class, caste, colour, or nation, or of instruction. The inner doors of
the Temple were thrown wide open to the *Amme-ha-aretz*; but the
innermost door still remained closed, for it is a door that is not
man-made—it opens into the within of things, and not into some inner
court of formal instruction. That door still remained naturally closed
to the unworthy and unknowing; but no Scribe or Pharisee of the
established order of things could any longer keep the key thereof in his
selfish hands. The key was given to all, but given still mystically, for
it is hidden in the inner nature of each son of man, and if he seek not
in himself, searching into the depths of his own nature, he will never
find it. That key is the opener of the Gate of the Gnosis, the
complement and syzygy and spouse of Faith; the virile husband of the
woman-side of the Christ-Religion.

In the early days that Gnosis was given in greatest fullness; Faith
there was, Faith in mighty abundance, but there was also Gnosis; and it
was because of this Gnosis of not a few that the Faith of the many was
so intense. But over these mysterious days, and the inner in-working of
the Mystery, a veil has been drawn to hide the holy operations from
profane eyes

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> So that to-day,
these many centuries after, the foolish of the Faith deny there was ever
a Gnosis; just as their still more foolish predecessors persecuted the
Gnostics of Christ and howled them down as Antichrists and First-born
Sons of Satan. The natural veil was thus drawn over the too bright light
of the Sacred Marriage when Heaven had kissed the Earth once more.

So great, then, is my faith in the *authentia* of the Master, so great
my assurance of the wisdom of His Gnosis. If this be thought “calumny”
of His transcendency, then we are judged “calumniators” with Hermes, a
Knower of the Mystery, and so complimented immeasurably beyond our
deserts.

##### CONCERNING DATES

And now let us turn to the Religion of the Mind, which is also the
Religion of the Heart—for is not Thoth Lord of the heart of man?

In the first place we have endeavoured faithfully to investigate every
statement or suggestion that can be thought to be indicative of date,
and we have not succeeded in any single instance in fixing a precise
date for any sermon or fragment. What, however, we have been able to do,
is to clear the ground of many false opinions, and to show the
insecurity, if not the absurdity, of any attempt at precision. Every
hypothesis of precision of date, when that hypothesis has favoured a
late date for any sermon, has broken down. Whenever there has been a
clearer indication, as, for instance, in the case of the *Shepherd of
Hermas*, and the *Pœmandres* of Hermes, it has thrown the time-period
backwards and not forwards.

What has been proved, and amply proved, however, is that our literature
goes back in an unbroken tradition of type and form and content to the
earliest Ptolemaic

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

times. The earliest forms of this literature are lost, but clear records
of its nature remain. Of the extant literature there are specimens of
varying date, though how they should be ordered is by no means clear;
what, however, is clear is that some of our documents are at least
contemporaneous with the earliest writings of Christianity.

In the “Prolegomena” we have established an unbroken line of tradition
in which Gnosis and Mystery-teaching have been handed down through
pre-Christian, Pagan and Jewish, and through Christian hands. We have
further shown that the Gnosis of our Trismegistic documents is a simpler
form than that of the great doctors of the Christianised Gnosis,
Basilides and Valentinus, who flourished in the first quarter of the
second century. The earlier of our sermons, therefore, represent one of
the main streams, perhaps the main stream, of the Unchristianised
Gnosis. We have further shown that, together with many other schools,
both our Pœmandrists and the writers of the New Testament documents use
a common theological or theosophical nomenclature, and have a common
body of ideas.

What is clear from all this is that there is no plagiarism, no
deliberate copying, no *logoklopia* of other men’s secrets, though there
was the freest drawing on a common fund. The condition of affairs and
the nature of the problems involved are such, that any theory of
plagiarism at once becomes a two-edged sword; he who says that
Trismegisticism copied from Christianity, can at once have his argument
reversed into the form that Christianity copied from Trismegisticism.

As to date, then, we are dealing with a period when there was as yet no
divorcement between Gnosis and Faith even in Christianity itself, and
therefore the

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

canons of judgment erected in later times by ecclesiastical
self-limitation cannot be made to apply.

##### THE BLEND OF TRADITIONS

The view of General Christianity, gradually narrowed down by the Church
Fathers into dogmatic Nicene Christianity, looked to one tradition only
as the schoolmaster of the Faith—the tradition of Israel as the
God-favoured Folk. Nevertheless it was the fair Greek tongue and the
Greek method of thought that were used in evolving this special
dispensation into a world-cult for the many.

The Trismegistic tradition laboured under no such limitation; its
sympathies were more catholic. It is true that its main source was in
Egypt, but it embraced with whole-hearted affection the wisdom of Hellas
and the genius of Greece which were developed under Divine Providence to
teach the Western Nations the glory and beauty of the mind. At the same
time its sympathies were not divorced from the tradition of the Hebrews,
though it refused to set them apart from the rest of humanity, and
looked rather to the great river of wisdom in the Books of the
Chaldæans, Persians, Medes, and Parthians, than to the single stream
shut off in the Books of Israel. The spirit of our Trismegistic writings
is the same as that which inspired the Pagan and Jewish and Christian
Gnostic scribes of the Naassene Document, all of whom believed that
there was but one Mystery which all the mystery-institutions of the
world attempted to adumbrate.

If, then, we were to say for the sake of convenience that our
Trismegistic writings enshrine the Wisdom of Egypt in Greek tradition,
we should not divorce that Wisdom from the Wisdom of the Chaldæans and
the rest. The Wisdom was one, the forms were many; and both

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egypt and Chaldæa
looked back to an Archaic Gnosis that was the common mother of their
most ancient forms of Mystery-teaching.

And if we say that this Wisdom. has come down to us in Greek tradition,
we should ever remember that this Græcising or philosophising has to do
with the form and not with the substance. For whence did Thales and
Pythagoras and Plato draw the inspiration for their philosophy or love
of wisdom; was it not from Egypt? At anyrate so say the Greeks
themselves without a single dissentient voice. And can we think that the
Greeks, who were always so proud of their own achievements and boasted
their own genius so loudly, would have given the palm of wisdom to Egypt
had they not been compelled by overwhelming evidence to do so? But this
does not mean that we are to deprive Hellas of her just laurels. Hellas
was the mother of philosophy in the sense of systematic thinking and the
development of the analytic reason. This is her great virtue and honour;
independent research, and the piercing analysis of the intellect and the
beauty of clear thinking in excellent expression, were her gifts to the
Western world. It was she beyond the other nations that created for
herself a subtler vehicle of thought for the manifestation of the powers
of mental analysis. That, however, is not necessarily in itself wisdom,
but the perfecting of an instrument whereby wisdom, if it be attained by
other means, may be the more clearly expressed for those in whom the
analytic faculties are being developed.

Wisdom transcends this mode of mind; for ratiocination is not ecstasis,
the practical intelligence is not the contemplative mind. Nor is mind,
using it as contrasted with the other faculties and energies and

<span id="page_326">p. 326</span>

powers in man, the only or even the highest thing in man. This Secret of
the Sphinx Egypt had possessed for millennia; so that her priests could
say to Solon: “You Greeks are all children”—for the intellect in Greece
was young, though destined to grow into a giant; whereas the hoary
Gnosis of the heart of man was prior to the æons, and will continue when
the æons shall cease.

That Gnosis of Man still awaits decipherment in Egypt; it is hidden in
her glyphs and symbols and holy signs. But that Gnosis will never yield
its secret to those who persist in interpreting these symbols of the
Language of the Gods into their lower forms, forms intended for children
and not for men. And indeed our Trismegistic sermons, if they should
teach us nothing else, can at least assure us of this, for their writers
were still ear to mouth with the Living Voice of that once Great Church
of Wisdom. Our Pœmandrists knew what the mystery-tradition inculcated;
they knew, for they had been within the holy shrines.

At anyrate for my part I prefer to believe their view of the matter,
than to listen to the contemptuous patronage of modern conceit bred of
complete ignorance of the manifold natures and powers and energies in
man.

##### OF INITIATION

Indeed the whole of this theosophy of Egypt, as indeed of the theosophy
of all climes and times, was intended to lead a man up the stairway of
perfectioning, to the portals of the first true natural initiation,
whereby he becomes superman, or, as Hermes would say, at last and in
truth “man” and not a “procession of Fate.” Beyond that stage are many
others too sublime for us in any way to understand; and it is just
because

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

of their sublimity that we do not understand and so we “interpret”
things of the height into the lowest notions and opinions of the most
limited things of sense. For beyond the superman stage comes the Christ,
and then—but who shall speak of that which transcends even perfected
master-hood?

And by initiation, in this sense, we do not mean probationary forms of
drama and of instruction, “of things said and done,” but a natural thing
and process, all that which the Christ of Christendom has laboured to
inculcate with so much wisdom even in the blurred record that has come
down to us. To this initiation a man may come without a physical guide
or the help of any tradition of formal ceremony. Nevertheless, he would
indeed be foolish who should say that the greater mystery-institutions
which have been established by wise teachers and the Providence of God,
have been or are of no effect.

On the contrary, the disciple of wisdom will study every record of such
institutions accessible to him, and ponder on their marvellous
multiplicity, and marvel at the infinite modes devised to play the
pedagogue, that so man may be brought unto his God. Nevertheless, if he
has not the love and wit to study such things, he should not despair,
for is he not already in the Outer Court of the Temple, if he would but
lift up his eyes to see the mysteries of the universe that surround him
on every side?

We all are babes in the Womb of the Great Mother; how long we continue
as babes, as embryos, remains for each of us to decide. For in this
Birth the Mother alone cannot bear all the pains of labour; we too must
help and strive and struggle and dare to breathe within her holy Womb,
so as to accustom our dead lungs to expand, before the Great Birth can
be accomplished, and we can at length walk forth into the Inner

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> World erect upon
our feet and draw in at every pore and in every atom its pure air
without fear. But this Inner World is no thin shadow of the outer world,
as it may appear to us in the dark night of our present ignorance; it is
the Inner Cosmos, not the inner earth. Rapts and visions may let us see
some mysteries of the inner earth, but not the mysteries of Earth, much
less the Divine Mysteries of Cosmos.

Nor is there any need to label these things with precise terms, for now
even the most experienced in such vision can know but in part; whereas
then we shall know the Fullness, face to face, without a parable. But
knowing this, who shall tell the Mystery, who *can* tell the Mystery—for
is not the whole of Nature telling us this Mystery now at every moment
with infinite voices from infinite mouths, and yet we hear nothing? For
is not the whole creation designed with this one purpose to tell every
son of man that he *is* of Light and Life and only *happens* to be out
of them, as Hermes says?

##### A LAST WORD

But it is very possible that some who have done me the honour of reading
to the end, will say: “This man is a dreamer, an ecstatic; we have no
use for such in the hard world of rigid facts that confront us in our
everyday life!”

But indeed I have little time for dreams and ecstasies in the sense in
which my supposed critics would use the words, as any one may see who
can realise the labour that has been expended on these volumes,
nine-tenths of which are filled with translations and commentaries,
criticisms and notes, in which dreams and ecstasies have no part, but
only strenuous co-labour of mind and soul and body. And that is just the
carrying out of what I hold to be the true doctrine of practical

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

mysticism, or if objection be taken by the reader to that much ill-used
word, of the Great Work of life. It is true that it is almost impossible
to talk of these high or deep things except in language that in every
expression and in every word is liable to misconstruction. For even when
we call them high things, they are not high in space or place, but
rather in the sense that they are of greater intensity than the shows
and appearances of opinion that form the surfaces or superficialities of
our world of normal conditioning.

Spirit in itself is not superior to mind, or mind to soul, or soul to
body; each and all must work together according to their proper dignity,
nature, and energy, in perfect equilibrium in the perfect man. They are
not descending degrees of some one thing, but are mutually in some
mysterious way all aspects of one another.

For should we regard them as quantitatively distinguished solely, then
we should be looking at them from the point of view of divided body
alone; or should we regard them as qualitatively distinguished, then we
should be looking at them from the point of view of separated soul
alone; or should we regard them as logically distinguished, then we
should be regarding them from the standpoint of the formal reason
solely; while if we should look at them as wholes monadically and
synthetically, we should be regarding them from an abstract and not a
vital view-point.

Nevertheless they are all each of other, the same in difference and
different in the same. Their source and middle and their end is Man, and
Man alone can reach unto the Gnosis of God.

And therefore we may conclude with the daring counsel given unto Hermes
by the Mind—a doctrine fit for Men.

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

“If, then, thou dost not make thyself like unto God, thou canst not know
Him. For like is knowable to like alone.

“Make thou thyself to grow to the same stature as the Greatness which
transcends all measure; leap forth from every Body; transcend all Time;
become Eternity; and then shalt thou know God.

“Conceiving nothing is impossible unto thyself, think thyself deathless
and able to know all—all arts, all sciences, the way of every life.

“Become more lofty than all height, and lower than all depth. Collect
into thyself all senses of all creatures—of fire and water, dry and
moist. Think that thou art at the same time in every place—in earth, in
sea, in sky; not yet begotten, in the womb, young, old, and dead, in
after-death conditions.

“And if thou knowest all these things at once—times, places, doings,
qualities, and quantities; thou canst know God.”

This is the Straight Way, the Good’s Own Path, the Ancient Road.

“If thou but sett’st thy foot thereon, ’twill meet thee everywhere,
’twill anywhere be seen, both where and when thou dost expect it
not—waking, sleeping, sailing, journeying, by night, by day, speaking,
and saying naught. For there is naught that is not image of the Good.”

And so for the present writing we bid farewell to Thrice-greatest Hermes
and the teachings of his Mind, the Shepherd of all men—with heart-felt
thanks that by the Mercy of God the echo of his voice has come to us
across the ages and bidden us once more remember.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_792"></span>[311:1](th346.htm#fr_792.md) The text has bodily
fallen out of our Corpus with one of the quires.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[311:2](th346.htm#fr_793.md) This seems to be a
complete sermon, and to be presupposed in C. H*.* xii. (xiii.); as also
Ex. xi.

<span id="fn_794"></span>[311:3](th346.htm#fr_794.md) Exx. x.-xiii.
probably go here as being part of the “Sermons on Fate to Tat”; but they
are assigned otherwise by Stobæus.

<span id="fn_795"></span>[312:1](th346.htm#fr_795.md) These all seem to go
together from the same Sermon or Book, which in the case of Frag. xv. is
definitely assigned by Cyril to the “First of the Expository Sermons.”
The beginning of the Sermon is given in Lact. xxiv., and a reference in
Lact. xiii.

<span id="fn_796"></span>[312:2](th346.htm#fr_796.md) Seems to be a
complete tractate.

<span id="fn_797"></span>[312:3](th346.htm#fr_797.md) By comparison with
Ex. vii.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[312:4](th346.htm#fr_798.md) Ex. ix. is
characterised as “the most authoritative and chiefest of them all,” and
therefore came, presumably, at the end of one of the Books of these
Sermons.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[312:5](th346.htm#fr_799.md) A complete tractate,
containing heads or summaries of previous sermons, and probably one
towards the end of this collection.

<span id="fn_800"></span>[312:6](th346.htm#fr_800.md) The esoteric
counterpart of which is C. H*.* xi. (xii.).

<span id="fn_801"></span>[312:7](th346.htm#fr_801.md) These three sermons
are too advanced to be classed among “The General Sermons,” and in the
case of the last, Tat is a questioner and not a hearer as he indubitably
was in the introductory instruction.

<span id="fn_802"></span>[313:1](th346.htm#fr_802.md) This is said to
follow on “The Perfect Sermon,” which was not included in our Corpus
among the selections of the Pœmandrist apologist who redacted it.

<span id="fn_803"></span>[313:2](th346.htm#fr_803.md) This is said by the
editor to be an expansion of an instruction already given to Tat, in
Asclepius’ absence, and the doctrine is very similar to that contained
in C. H*.* xi. (xii.)—“Mind unto Hermes.” It also stood in Cyril’s
(viii.) “To Asclepius.”

<span id="fn_804"></span>[315:1](th346.htm#fr_804.md) The end is lost.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[315:2](th346.htm#fr_805.md) A fragment only from
the end of the sermon is preserved.
