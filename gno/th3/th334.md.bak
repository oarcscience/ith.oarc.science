### TERTULLIAN <span id="fr_525"></span>[1](#fn_525.md)

<span class="small">i. *Contra Valentinianos*, xv.; Œhler (F.), ii. 402
(Leipzig, 1844).</span>

##### HERMES THE MASTER OF ALL PHYSICS

(<span class="smallcaps">Writing</span> sarcastically of the Gnostic
Sophia-myth, Tertullian exclaims:)

Well, then, let the Pythagoreans learn, the Stoics know, \[yea,\] Plato
even, whence matter—which they \[*sc*. the Pythagoreans and the rest\]
would have to be ingenerable—derived its source and substance to
\[form\] this pile of a world,—\[a mystery\] which not even the famous
Thrice-greatest Hermes, the master of all physics, has thought out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The doctrine of Hermes, and of Hellenistic theology in general, however,
is that matter comes from the One God. It is remarkable that Tertullian
keeps his final taunt for that school which was evidently thought the
foremost of all—that of the “famous Thrice-greatest Hermes.”

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

<span class="small">ii. De Anima, ii.; Œhler, ii. 558.</span>

##### HERMES THE WRITER OF SCRIPTURE

(Inveighing against the wisdom of the philosophers, Tertullian says:)

She \[philosophy\] has also been under the impression that she too has
drawn from what they \[the philosophers\] consider “sacred” scriptures;
because antiquity thought that most authors were gods (*deos*), and not
merely inspired by them (*divos*),—as, for instance, Egyptian Hermes,
with whom especially Plato had intercourse, <span
id="fr_526"></span>[1](#fn_526.md) . . . \[and others\] . . . .

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here again, as with Justin, Hermes heads the list; moreover, in
Tertullian’s mind, Hermes belongs to antiquity, to a more ancient
stratum than Pythagoras and Plato, as the context shows; Plato, of
course, depends on Hermes, not Hermes on Plato; of this Tertullian has
no doubt. There were also “sacred scriptures” of Hermes, and Hermes was
regarded as a god.

<span class="small">iii. *Ibid.*, xxviii.; Œhler, ii. 601.</span>

##### HERMES THE FIRST TEACHER OF REINCARNATION

What then is the value nowadays of that ancient doctrine mentioned by
Plato, <span id="fr_527"></span>[2](#fn_527.md) about the reciprocal
migration of souls; how they remove hence and go thither, and then
return hither and pass through life, and then again depart from this
life, made quick again from the dead? Some will have it that this is a
doctrine of Pythagoras; while Albinus <span
id="fr_528"></span>[3](#fn_528.md) will have it to

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

be a divine pronouncement, perhaps of Egyptian Hermes.

<span class="small">iv. *Ibid.*, xxxiii.; Œhler, ii. 610.</span>

##### HERMES ON METEMPSYCHOSIS

(Arguing ironically against the belief in metempsychosis, Tertullian
writes:)

Even if they \[souls\] should continue \[unchanged\] until judgment \[is
pronounced upon them\] . . . a point which was known to Egyptian Hermes,
when he says that the soul on leaving the body is not poured back into
the soul of the universe, but remains individualized <span
id="fr_529"></span>[1](#fn_529.md):

#### FRAGMENT I.

> That it may give account unto the Father of those things which it hath
> done in body.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

This exact quotation <span id="fr_530"></span>[2](#fn_530.md) is to be
found nowhere in the existing remains of the Trismegistic literature,
but it has every appearance of being genuine.

Œhler (note c) refers to *C. H.*, x. (xi.) 7, but this passage of “The
Key” is only a general statement of the main idea of metempsychosis.

A more appropriate parallel is to be found in *P. S. A.*, xxviii. 1:
“When, \[then,\] the soul’s departure from the body shall take
place,—then shall the judgment and the weighing of its merit pass into
its highest daimon’s power”—a passage, however, which retains far
stronger traces of the Egyptian prototype of the idea than does that
quoted by Tertullian.
