#### COMMENTARY

##### ARGUMENT

The Sermon from which this Extract is taken plainly belonged to the same
class of literature as the *K. K*. Excerpts. The writer is an initiate
of a higher degree, imparting instruction to his pupil by word of mouth.

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

He himself, however, professes to have “seen,” for he has been plunged
in the Cup of Immortality, and his feet have crossed the Plain of Truth
(3).

1\. The subject is the excarnate state of souls (1-3). The instruction
is given by an analogy and a similitude (4). Each soul seeks naturally
its proper habitat in the unseen world.

5\. The ordering of the spaces of the excarnate souls is then described.
These spaces are all in the “great air,” the sublunary region, extending
from the earth surface to the moon.

6\. Of this great interval there are 4 main divisions and 60 spaces, the
divisions consisting respectively of 4, 8, 16 and 32 sub-spaces. Above
the second division from below there is no motion of the “air”; the
“wind,” or “moving air” belt, belongs properly to this second division,
but has also authority over the first or lowest division, which extends
from the earth-surface to the tops of the highest mountains.

7\. Besides these 4 divisions and 60 spaces, there is a further ordering
into 12 “intervallic” divisions. <span id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_483.md)

8\. All is arranged by measure and harmony, and after death every soul
goes to the space of its desert, ascending and descending according to
an unerring law of Providence.

9\. To carry out this economy there are two ministers of Providence, the
warder and the conductor of souls. The one watches over souls who are
out of body, and the other brings them back to suitable bodies. These
bodies are made by nature in exact correspondence with their former
deeds and characters; in this nature is aided by the energies of
experience and memory (9-11).

12\. The nature of the soul is conditioned by its habitat in the
air-spaces or zones; and this is especially

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

the case with those of the regal type. The names of some of these royal
souls and their offices are given.

13\. In brief all is ordered from above; the source of all is above in
the soul-spaces, and as all souls come thence, so will all return
thither.

14\. How this is effected is explained as being conditioned by a certain
link between soul and body, a sort of quintessence, or exhalation, or
vapour, of the blend of sub-elements which compose the body
(14-20). <span id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_484.md) It is a sort of etheric
link between soul and body; it circulates in the body, but also shares
with the soul, which is not thought of as being in the body, but as a
sphere enveloping the body; or at any rate the body is in the soul, and
not the soul in the body. Health is said to depend upon the maintenance
of the due proportion of the “vapours” <span
id="fr_485"></span>[2](#fn_485) of this “etheric double” (18.md).

Not only so, but the increase of vitality or intensity in these elements
in the “vapour,” is the means of remembering symbolic dreams and passing
into a state of ecstasy; finally it is the fiery element of this
“vapour” which dissolves this “spirituous body” (19).

It is by means of this link that changes are effected from soul to body,
and from body to soul (20); and here, unfortunately, Stobæus ends his
excerpt.

##### TITLE AND ORDERING

The “Sermon of Isis to Horus” extract is, in both style and context, so
similar to the *K. K*. excerpts that we might almost take it to be part
and parcel of the very same treatise; but if this had been the case,
Stobæus, following his custom, would have presumably headed it with a
simple “from the same.” He may,

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

however, have made a mistake, for that the good Joannes sometimes nods,
may be seen from the short Excerpt xxi., which he says is also taken
from “The \[Sermon\] of Isis to Horus” <span
id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_486.md); but this cannot be the case, since Isis
is here addressing a certain king as her pupil, and not Horus.

Moreover, at the very beginning of our excerpt Horus distinctly states
that Isis has already explained to him “the details of God’s wondrous
soul-making,” and thanks her “for being made initiate by word of mouth
into the vision of the soul,”—all of which is a precise reference to the
contents of the *K. K*. excerpts. I am, therefore, inclined to think
that not only is it a further tractate of instruction following
immediately on *K. K*., but that even if it were supposed to be part and
parcel of the same sermon, and that “The \[Sermon\] of Isis to Horus”
was simply a sub-title or alternative title of the “Virgin of the
World,” the hypothesis could not be easily set aside. <span
id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_487.md)

In any case it is quite certain that *S. I. H*. belongs to precisely the
same type as *K. K*.; and that it pertains to the same special class of
Trismegistic literature, and to a somewhat similar type as the treatise
from which Cyril quotes Fragg. xix., xx., xxi., in which Osiris figures
as the disciple of the Good Daimon, Trismegistus.

##### THE BOOKS OF ISIS AND HORUS

Here also, as in *K. K*., Isis comes forward as “initiated into the
nature that transcendeth death,” her “feet

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

have crossed the Plain of Truth” (3) that is as we have shown in the
Comments on *K. K*., 10, the writer claims to have reached the degree of
illumination which bestows on men the consciousness of the gods. “Isis,”
then, is not “common to all priests,” as Jamblichus says of “Hermes,”
without the honorific qualification “Thrice-greatest,” but rather of a
certain grade of initiation; the teacher of that lower grade, or
Horus-grade, being Hermes’ representative. Isis was commonly regarded as
the Lady of all wisdom and teacher of all magic. Already in the earliest
Hellenistic period she had attributes similar to those of Thoth-Hermes,
and thus comes forward as the Orderer of the world <span
id="fr_488"></span>[1](#fn_488.md); and not only so, but, like Thoth, she
is called Lady of the heart and of the tongue; that is to say, her
attributes were those of the Logos. <span
id="fr_489"></span>[2](#fn_489.md)

That there was a secret theosophic and apocalyptic literature ascribed
to Isis and Horus may be seen from Lucian, who, in one of his humorous
sketches, puts into the mouth of Pythagoras the following sentence:

“I also journeyed to Egypt that I might make the acquaintance of the
prophets of wisdom, and I descended into the shrines of the temples and
learned the Books of Isis and Horus.” <span
id="fr_490"></span>[3](#fn_490.md)

Here again, then, as Manetho tells us, these Books, as the Books of
Hermes, were kept secret in the holy of holies of the Temples; and these
shrines were evidently

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

underground for Pythagoras is said to have “descended” to them.

This is the Horus who is not only, after Osiris, the lord of power and
might, that is, king, but lord of philosophy, as Arnebeschēnis (12). For
Arnebeschēnis, that is Har-nebeschenis, is, as Spiegelberg has
shown, <span id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_491.md) an Egyptian proper name,
meaning “Horus lord of Letopolis,” at one time an important city in the
Delta. In the Alchemical literature also we meet with Horus as a writer
of books, as for instance in the superscription “Horus the Gold-miner to
Cronus who is Ammon.” <span id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_492.md)

Here we see that Horus stands to Isis as Asclepius to Hermes; Asclepius
wrote books to Ammon, and so Horus wrote books to Ammon; but whereas the
Trismegistic tradition proper looked back to Cronus (Ammon) as one of
its earliest teachers, the later writings converted Ammon into a king
who was taught by Asclepius or by Horus.

##### THE WATERY SPHERE AND SUBTLE BODY

The writer of *S. I*. *H*. tells us that the soul in its royal state,
that is while lord of itself, is a divine creature, but in incarnation
it is united with the watery plasm or subtle body, of *K. K.*, 18, where
Hermes says that in making it he “used more water than was required”;
and to which the soul in its complaint (§ 21) refers as a “watery
sphere.” This union makes it dense “against its proper nature” (3), and
it is further densified by a certain “vaporous” nature which unites it
with the physical frame (15, 17, 20); concerning all of which it is of
interest to refer to Philoponus, who tells us that:

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

“They \[the ancients\] further add, that there is something of a plantal
and plastic life <span id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_493.md) also, exercised
by the soul, in those spirituous and airy bodies after death; they being
nourished too, though not after the same manner, as these gross earthly
bodies of ours are here, but by vapours; and that not by parts or
organs, but throughout the whole of them (as sponges), <span
id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_494.md) they imbibing everywhere those vapours.
For which cause, they who are wise will in this life also take care of
using a thinner and dryer diet, that so that spirituous body (which we
have also at this present time within our grosser body) may not be
clogged and incrassated, but attenuated. Over and above which these
ancients made use of catharms, or purgations, to the same end and
purpose also: for as this earthly body is washed with water, so is that
spirituous body cleansed by cathartic vapours; some of these vapours
being nutritive, others purgative. Moreover, these ancients further
declared concerning this spirituous body, that it was not organized, but
did the whole of it, in every part throughout, exercise all functions of
sense, the soul hearing and seeing, and perceivng all sensibles, by it
everywhere.” <span id="fr_495"></span>[3](#fn_495.md)

##### THE HABITAT OF EXCARNATE SOULS

But to return to our treatise; the dwelling-place of excarnate souls is
the Air, the sublunary region of four main layers, which are
successively subtler and finer as they are more removed from the earth;
the uppermost limit of the Air is coterminous with the fiery or ætheric
realms (6), the habitat of the gods.

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

In the different zones, or firmaments, or layers of this Air, dwell not
only excarnate souls, during the period between their incarnations, but
also those which have never yet been shut in body—that is, presumably,
the daimones (8).

With regard to the manner in which souls are kept in their appropriate
spaces after the death of the body, and the way in which they are
brought back to appropriate bodies, and the two ministers of Providence
(9), it is of value to note that in this we have a simple outline of
what is explained at great length and in much detail in the Coptic
Gnostic work called *Pistis Sophia*. It would, however, occupy too much
space here to deal with the representations of the Egyptian Gnostic work
on this subject in a satisfactory manner, and as the text is now
accessible in English, it can easily be consulted by the reader. <span
