#### EXCERPT XX.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[THE POWER OF CHOICE\]

<span class="small">(Patrizzi (p. 42) runs this on to Ex. xix. without a
break.</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stob., *Ethica*, vii. 31, under heading: “Of
Hermes”; G. (ii.) pp. 654, 655; M. ii. 100, 101; W. ii. 160, 161.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. i. of “Fragments Divers,” pp.
271, 272.)</span>

<span class="smallcaps">There</span> is, then, essence, reason,
thought, <span id="fr_277"></span>[1](#fn_277) perception. <span
id="fr_278"></span>[2](#fn_278)

Opinion and sensation move towards perception; reason directs itself
towards essence; and thought sends itself forth through its own self.

And thought is interwoven with perception, and entering into one another
they become one form,—which is that of the Soul \[itself\].

Opinion and sensation move towards the Soul’s perception; but they do
not remain in the same state. Hence is there excess, and falling short,
and difference with them.

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

When they are drawn away from the perception, they deteriorate; but when
they follow it and are obedient, they share in the perceptive reason
through the sciences. <span id="fr_279"></span>[1](#fn_279)

2\. We have the power to choose; it is within our power to choose the
better, and in like way \[to choose\] the worse, according to our
will. <span id="fr_280"></span>[2](#fn_280)

And if \[our\] choice clings to the evil things, it doth consort with
the corporeal nature; \[and\] for this cause Fate rules o’er him who
makes this choice.

Since, then, the intellectual essence <span
id="fr_281"></span>[3](#fn_281) in us is absolutely free,—\[namely\] the
reason that embraces all in thought,—and that it ever is a law unto
itself and self-identical, on this account Fate does not reach it. <span
id="fr_282"></span>[4](#fn_282)

Thus furnishing it first from the First God, it <span
id="fr_283"></span>[5](#fn_283) sent forth the perceptive reason, and
the whole reason which Nature hath appointed unto them that come to
birth.

With these the Soul consorting, consorteth with their fates, though \[in
herself\] she hath no part \[or lot\] in their fates’ nature.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="small">(Patrizzi (p. 42) adds the following to the
preceding; it is not found in Stobæus, and appears to be a
scholium.)</span>

What is necessitated by the interwoven harmony <span
id="fr_284"></span>[1](#fn_284) of \[all\] the parts, in no way differs
from that which is fated.

#### COMMENT

I have supplied a temporary heading for the sake of uniformity. Our
extract, however, seems to be taken from a lengthy treatise, and was
probably one of the Sermons to Tat.

<span id="fn_280"></span>[85:2](th321.htm#fr_280) Reading ἑκουσίως for
the meaningless ἀκουσίως of the text.

<span id="fn_281"></span>[85:3](th321.htm#fr_281) Reading νοηματικὴ with
Patrizzi, instead of σωματικὴ as with G. W. prefers ἀσώματος
(incorporal).

<span id="fn_283"></span>[85:5](th321.htm#fr_283) The Soul, or
intellectual essence. The text is very obscure, and Wachsmuth does not
seem to have improved it. *Cf.* *C. H.*, xii. (xiii.) 8.
