### OF PIETY AND \[TRUE\] PHILOSOPHY

<span class="small">(Title from Patrizzi (p. 4); preceded by “Of
Thrice-greatest Hermes.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stobæus, *Phys*., xxxv. 1, under heading: “Of
Hermes—from the \[Book\] to Tat”; G. pp. 273-278; M. i. 190-194; W. i.
273-278. <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0)</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. i. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his Son Tat,” pp. 225-230.)</span>

1. <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1) *Her*. Both for the sake of love to
man, and piety <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2) to God, I \[now\], my
son, for the first time take pen in hand. <span
id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3)

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

For there can be no piety more righteous than to know the things that
are, and to give thanks for these to Him who made them,—which I will
never cease to do.

2\. *Tat*. By doing what, O father, then, if naught be true down here,
may one live wisely?

*Her*. Be pious, <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4) son! Who pious is,
doth reach the height of \[all\] philosophy <span
id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5); without philosophy the height of piety
cannot be scaled.

But he who learns what are existent things, and how they have been
ordered, and by whom, and for whose sake,—he will give thanks for all
unto the Demiurge, as unto a good sire, a nurse \[most\] excellent, a
steward who doth never break his trust. <span
id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6)

3\. Who giveth thanks, he will be pious; and he who pious is, will \[get
to\] know both where is Truth, and what it is.

And as he learns, he will more and more pious grow.

For never, son, can an embodied soul that has once leaped aloft, so as
to get a hold upon the truly Good and True, slip back again into the
contrary.

For when the soul \[once\] knows the Author of its Peace, <span
id="fr_7"></span>[4](#fn_7) ’tis filled with wondrous love, <span
id="fr_8"></span>[5](#fn_8) and

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

with forgetfulness <span id="fr_9"></span>[1](#fn_9) of every ill, and
can no more keep from the Good.

4\. Let this be, O \[my\] son, the goal of piety;—to which if thou
attain, thou shalt both nobly live, and happily depart from life, for
that thy soul no longer will be ignorant of whither it should wing its
flight again.

This is the only \[Way\], my son,—the Path \[that leads\] to Truth,
\[the Path\] on which our forebears, <span id="fr_10"></span>[2](#fn_10)
too, did set their feet, and, setting them, did find the Good. <span
id="fr_11"></span>[3](#fn_11)

Solemn and smooth this Path, yet difficult to tread for soul while still
in body.

5\. For first it hath to fight against itself, and make a great
dissension, and manage that the victory should rest with the one part
\[of its own self\].

For that there is a contest of the one against the two, <span
id="fr_12"></span>[4](#fn_12)—the former trying to flee, the latter
dragging down.

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

And there’s great strife and battle \[dire\] of these with one
another,—the one desiring to escape, the others striving to detain.

6\. The victory, moreover, of the one or of the others <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13) is not resemblant.

For that the one doth hasten \[upwards\] to the Good, the others settle
\[downwards\] to the bad.

The one longs to be freed; the others love their slavery.

If \[now\] the two be vanquished, they remain deprived of their own
selves and of their ruler <span id="fr_14"></span>[2](#fn_14); but if
the one be worsted, ’tis harried by the two, and driven about, being
tortured by the life down here.

This <span id="fr_15"></span>[3](#fn_15) is, \[my\] son, the one who
leadeth thee upon the Thither <span id="fr_16"></span>[4](#fn_16) Path.

Thou must, \[my\] son, first leave behind thy body, <span
id="fr_17"></span>[5](#fn_17) before the end \[of it <span
id="fr_18"></span>[6](#fn_18) is reached\], and come out victor in the
life of conflict, and thus as victor wend thy way towards home.

7\. And now, \[my\] son, I will go through the things that are by
heads <span id="fr_19"></span>[7](#fn_19); for thou wilt understand the
things that will be said, if thou remember what thy ears have heard.

All things that are, are \[then\] in motion; alone the that which is
not, is exempt from it.

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

Every body is in a state of change; \[but\] all bodies are not
dissolvable; some bodies \[only\] are dissolvable.

Not every animal is mortal; not every animal, immortal.

That which can be dissolved, can \[also\] be destroyed; the permanent
\[is\] the unchangeable; the that which doth not change, \[is\] the
eternal.

What doth become <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20) for ever, for ever
also is destroyed <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21); what once for all
becomes, is never more destroyed, nor does it \[ever more\] become some
other thing.

8\. First God; second the Cosmos; third \[is\] man. <span
id="fr_22"></span>[3](#fn_22)

The Cosmos, for man’s sake; and man, for God’s.

The soul’s irrational part <span id="fr_23"></span>[4](#fn_23) is
mortal; its rational part, immortal.

All essence \[is\] immortal; all essence, free from change.

All that exists <span id="fr_24"></span>[5](#fn_24) \[is\] twofold;
naught of existing things remains.

Not all are moved by soul; the soul moves all that doth exist. <span
id="fr_25"></span>[6](#fn_25)

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

9\. All that suffereth \[is\] sensible; not all that’s sensible, doth
suffer.

All that feels pain, doth also have experience of pleasure,—a mortal
life <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26); not all that doth experience
pleasure, feeleth \[also\] pain,—a life immortal.

Not every body’s subject to disease; all bodies subject to disease are
subject \[too\] to dissolution.

10\. The mind’s in God; the reasoning faculty’s <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27) in man.

The reason’s in the mind; the mind’s above all suffering.

Nothing in body’s true <span id="fr_28"></span>[3](#fn_28); all in the
bodiless is free from what’s untrue.

All that becomes, \[is\] subject unto change; not all that doth become,
need be dissolved.

Naught\[’s\] good upon the earth; naught\[’s\] bad in heaven.

11\. God\[’s\] good; \[and\] man \[is\] bad. <span
id="fr_29"></span>[4](#fn_29)

Good \[is\] free-willed; bad is against the will.

The gods do choose what things *are* good, as good; . . .

The good law of the mighty \[One\] <span id="fr_30"></span>[5](#fn_30)
is *the* good law; good law’s *the* law.

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

Time’s for the gods; the law for men. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31)

Bad is the stuff that feeds the world; time is the thing that brings man
to an end.

12\. All in the heaven is free from change; all on the earth is subject
unto it.

Naught in the heaven’s a slave; naught on the earth is free.

Nothing can *not* be known in heaven; naught can be known on earth.

The things on earth do not consort with things in heaven. <span
id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32)

All things in heaven are free from blame; all on the earth are
blameworthy.

The immortal is not mortal; the mortal, not immortal.

That which is sown, is not invariably brought forth; but that which is
brought forth, must have invariably been sown.

13\. \[Now\] for a body that can be dissolved, \[there are\] two
“times”:—\[the period\] from its sowing till its birth, and from its
birth until its death; but for an everlasting body, the time from birth
alone. <span id="fr_33"></span>[3](#fn_33)

Things subject unto dissolution wax and wane.

The matter that’s dissolved, doth undergo two

<span id="page_10">p. 10</span>

contrary transformings:—death and birth; but everlasting \[matter\],
doth change either to its own self, or into things like to itself.

The birth of man \[is\] the beginning of his dissolution; man’s
dissolution the beginning of his birth.

That which departs, <span id="fr_34"></span>[1](#fn_34) \[returns; and
what returns\] departs \[again\]. <span id="fr_35"></span>[2](#fn_35)

14\. Of things existent, some are in bodies, some in forms, and some
\[are\] in activities. <span id="fr_36"></span>[3](#fn_36)

Body\[’s\] in forms; and form and energy in body.

The deathless shares not in the mortal \[part\]; the mortal shares in
the immortal.

The mortal body doth not mount <span id="fr_37"></span>[4](#fn_37) into
the deathless one; the deathless one descends <span
id="fr_38"></span>[5](#fn_38) into the mortal frame.

Activities do not ascend, but they descend.

15\. The things on earth bestow no benefit on things in heaven; the
things in heaven shower every benefit on things on earth.

Of bodies everlasting heaven is the container; of those corruptible, the
earth.

Earth \[is\] irrational; the heaven \[is\] rational.

The things in heaven \[are\] under it; the things on earth above the
earth.

<span id="page_11">p. 11</span>

Heaven\[’s\] the first element; earth\[’s\] the last element.

Fore-knowledge <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39) \[is\] God’s Order;
Necessity\[’s\] handmaiden to Fore-knowledge.

Fortune\[’s\] <span id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40) the course of the
disorderly,—the image of activity, <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41)
untrue opinion.

What, \[then\] is God? The Good that naught can change.

What, man? The bad that can be changed. <span
id="fr_42"></span>[4](#fn_42)

16\. If thou rememberest these heads, <span
id="fr_43"></span>[5](#fn_43) thou wilt remember also what I have
already set forth for thee with greater wealth of words. For these are
summaries <span id="fr_44"></span>[6](#fn_44) of those.

Avoid, however, converse with the many \[on these things\]; not that I
would that thou shouldst keep them selfishly unto thyself, but rather
that thou shouldst not seem ridiculous unto the multitude. <span
id="fr_45"></span>[7](#fn_45)

For that the like’s acceptable unto the like; the unlike’s never friend
to the unlike.

Such words as these have very very few to give them ear; nay, probably,
they will not even have the few. <span id="fr_46"></span>[8](#fn_46)

They have, moreover, some \[strange force\]

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

peculiar unto themselves; for they provoke the evil all the more to bad.

Wherefore thou shouldst protect the many \[from themselves\], for they
ignore the power of what’s been said.

17\. *Tat*. What meanest thou, O father?

*Her*. This, \[my\] son! All that in man is animal, is proner unto bad
\[than unto good\]; nay, it doth cohabit with it, because it is in love
with it.

Now if this animal should learn that Cosmos is subject to genesis, and
all things come and go according to Fore-knowledge <span
id="fr_47"></span>[1](#fn_47) and by Necessity, Fate ruling all,—in no
long time it would grow worse than it is now, <span
id="fr_48"></span>[2](#fn_48) \[and\] thinking scorn of the whole
\[universe\] as being subject unto genesis, and unto Fate referring
\[all\] the causes of the bad, would never cease from every evil deed.

Wherefore, care should be taken of them, in order that being \[left\] in
ignorance, they may become less bad through fear of the unknown.

#### COMMENTARY

Patrizzi thought so highly of this excerpt that he chose it for Book I.
of his collection. He, however, erroneously made the persons of the
dialogue Asclepius and Tat, instead of Hermes and Tat—an unaccountable

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

mistake, in which he has been followed by all the editors of Stobæus
except Wachsmuth.

In the introduction the treatise purports to be a letter written to
Tat,—a new departure, for it is “for the first time”; on the other hand
the form of the treatise is the usual one of oral instruction, of
question and answer (§ 2). Nevertheless in § 16 we learn that the
definitions given in §§ 7-15 are intended as heads or summaries of
previous sermons.

But already in *C. H.*, x. (xi.) 1, we have an abridgment or epitome (or
rather a summation) of the General Sermons delivered to Tat, just as we
have in *C. H.*, xvi., “the summing up and digest, as it were, of all
the rest’’ of the Sermons of Asclepius to the King, under the
traditional title, “The Definitions of Asclepius.” The headings in our
sermon, then, may probably have been intended for the summary of the
teaching of the Expository Sermons to Tat (see in Cyril, Frag. xv.).
Some of our definitions, however, are strikingly similar to those in *C.
H.*, x. (xi.), but this may be accounted for by supposing that “The Key”
itself was one of, or rather the continuation of, the Expository
Sermons. <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49)

The warning to use great discretion in communicating the instruction to
the “many,” because of the danger of teaching the Gnosis to the morally
unfit, seems to be an appropriate ending to the sermon; we may then be
fairly confident that we have in the above a complete tractate of “The
\[? Expository\] Sermons to Tat”; the title, however, is the invention
of Patrizzi, and not original.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[5:1](th302.htm#fr_9) Where λήθη (forgetfulness)
is opposed to ἔρως (love),—that is to say, reminiscence, the secret of
the μάθησις (*mathēsis*) of the Pythagoreans, the knowledge of the
Author of our being or of our “race” within,—ψυχὴ μαθοῦσα ἑαυτῆς τὸν
προπάτορα (*cf*. Ex. iii. 6).

<span id="fn_12"></span>[5:4](th302.htm#fr_12) The “one” is the rational
element (τὸ λογικόν) and the “two” are the passional (τὸ θυμικόν) and
desiderative (τὸ ἐπιθυμητικόν) elements of the irrational nature (τὸ
ἄλογον, or τὸ αἰσθητὸν as below), the “heart” and the “appetite.” *Cf*.
Ex. xvii.; see also “Orphic Psychology” in my *Orpheus* (London, 1896),
pp. 273-275.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[6:1](th302.htm#fr_13) Lit. of the two.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[6:2](th302.htm#fr_14) That is, the one.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[7:2](th302.htm#fr_21) Or dies.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[7:3](th302.htm#fr_22) πρῶτον ὁ θεὸς, δεύτερον ὁ

(Æon) is the first God; second is Cosmos; man’s the third.”

<span id="fn_23"></span>[7:4](th302.htm#fr_23) Lit. sensible part,—τὸ

<span id="fn_24"></span>[7:5](th302.htm#fr_24) πᾶν τὸ ὄν,—as opposed to
οὐσία. (essence).

<span id="fn_25"></span>[7:6](th302.htm#fr_25) The meaning of
*ex*-istence, being the coming out of pure being into the state of
becoming.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[8:1](th302.htm#fr_26) Or animal; perhaps this
and the following interjection are glosses.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[8:2](th302.htm#fr_27) ὁ λογισμός,—perhaps a
mistake for λόγος, as Patrizzi has it.

<span id="fn_28"></span>[8:3](th302.htm#fr_28) Or real.

*cf*. *C. H*., x. (xi.) 12.

<span id="fn_30"></span>[8:5](th302.htm#fr_30) The text is faulty; as is
also apparently that of the following sentence. None of the conjectures
yet put forward are satisfactory.

<span id="fn_31"></span>[9:1](th302.htm#fr_31) Or time is divine, the
law is man’s.

<span id="fn_32"></span>[9:2](th302.htm#fr_32) I have not adopted W.’s
lengthy emendations.

<span id="fn_33"></span>[9:3](th302.htm#fr_33) This is the idea of
sempiternity—of things which have a beginning but no end.

<span id="fn_34"></span>[10:1](th302.htm#fr_34) Or dies.

<span id="fn_35"></span>[10:2](th302.htm#fr_35) There is a lacuna in the
