#### EXCERPT V

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### \[OF MATTER\]

<span class="small">(I have added the title, it being the same as that
of the main section of Stobæus, Patrizzi (p. 51) giving only the simple
heading “From the \[Sermons\] to Tat.”</span>

<span class="small">Text: Stobæus, *Phys*., xi. 2, under the heading:
“Of Hermes from the \[Sermons\] to Tat”; G. p. 121; M. i. 84, 85; W. i.
131.</span>

<span class="small">Ménard, Livre IV., No. viii. of “Fragments from the
Books of Hermes to his son Tat,” p. 250.)</span>

*Her*. Matter both has been born, O son, and it has been \[before it
came into existence\]; for Matter is the vase of genesis, <span
id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md) and genesis, the mode of energy of God,
who’s free from all necessity of genesis, and pre-exists.

\[Matter\], accordingly, by its reception of the seed of genesis, did
come \[herself\] to birth, and \[so\] became subject to change, and,
being shaped,

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

took forms; for she, contriving the forms of her \[own\] changing,
presided over her own changing self.

The unborn state <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md) of Matter, then,
was formlessness <span id="fr_81"></span>[2](#fn_81.md); its genesis is its
being brought into activity.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_79"></span>[26:1](th306.htm#fr_79.md) Or receptacle or field
of genesis, or birth (ἀγγεῖον γενέσεως). The idea of a vessel or vase of
birth was a familiar symbol with the Pythagoreans; μεταγγισμός (from the
simile of pouring water out of one vessel into another) being one of
their synonyms for metempsychosis.

<span id="fn_80"></span>[27:1](th306.htm#fr_80.md) ἀγεννησία

<span id="fn_81"></span>[27:2](th306.htm#fr_81.md) ἀμορφία. Compare this
with the Christian Gnostic commentator of the Naassene Document, quoted
by Hippolytus (*Philos*. v. 7), and the comment of Hippolytus on him:
“Their first and Blessed Formless Essence (ἀσχημάτιστος οὐσία), the
cause of all forms” (“Myth of Man,” § 7).
