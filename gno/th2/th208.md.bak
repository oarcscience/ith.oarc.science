#### COMMENTARY

##### TEXT AND TITLE

The text seems to be very corrupt, and at one time I thought it
incomplete; but it may very well end with the reference to the mighty
deeds of the men of old.

The title “Sacred Sermon” would lead us to expect something of a special
nature, something that would constitute a basis of doctrine. For we hear
of the “Sacred Sermon” of Orpheus, and of the “Sacred Sermon” of
Pythagoras, and are told that they formed the most sacred deposits of
these two mystic schools respectively, and were regarded with special
reverence; they thus seem to have been looked upon in some fashion as
containing the groundwork of these systems.

And this is precisely what we find with our treatise; it is to a large
extent a summary of the general ideas of the “Shepherd” cosmogony
adapted to the needs of a simpler formularization.

When, however, Reitzenstein (p. 193) refers to this treatise cursorily
as the preaching of some prophet or other which has been transferred to
Hermes by the Redactor of our Corpus, he suggests that we are dealing
with a doctrine foreign to the cosmogonical ideas of the “Shepherd.” It
is, indeed, true that if we compare the *data* of the two treatises
together, detail by detail, we shall find strong contradictions; but the
general “feel” of both is the same, the general atmosphere is identical.

##### THE TRINITY

Prefixed to the cosmogenesis is a formal theological proœm, the precise
meaning of which escapes me because of its almost mnemonic nature; it
is, indeed

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

quite in *sūtra* style. There appears, however, to be a distinct
trinitarian <span id="fr_141"></span>[1](#fn_141.md) idea lurking in the
first sentence, the trinity consisting of God (ὁ Θεὸς) and Godhead (τὸ
θεῖον) and Nature (ἡ φύσις). The Glory or Power of all things is this
Divine Trinity. The Source (or Beginning), the End and the Ever-renewing
of all things are owing to this Triad. All three seem to be almost
interchangeable terms. The Godhead is the Mind of God, Godly Nature is
the Wisdom of God. Again, at the end of the sermon (§ 4) we are told
that the Godhead (or that which is Divine) is “Nature’s
ever-making-new-again the cosmic mixture.” Godhead in operation is
Nature, while at the same time Nature is co-established in Godhead, and
both are one in God, the Source of all.

The cosmogenesis begins with the grandiose image: “Darkness that knew no
bounds was in Abyss.”

We have already, in commenting on “Darkness” in the “Pœmandres”
treatise, referred, in explanation, to a Gnostic tradition in which the
Primal Elements appear as Water, Darkness, Abyss, and Chaos, and have
given some reason for ascribing the form of this tradition to Egypt—that
is, Archaic Egypt, a parallel tradition to the Sumerian, both derived
from a still more Archaic source.

##### FROM THE SYSTEM OF THE NICOLAÏTANS

If, now, we turn to Epiphanius (remembering that he picked up what he
knew or thought he knew about the Gnostics in Egypt), we shall find that
he has preserved from another Gnostic system an even more striking
parallel with our text.

The Bishop of Salamis is denouncing the Nicolaïtans, <span
id="fr_142"></span>[2](#fn_142.md) who for him were the earliest Christian
Gnostics, there

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

being very numerous and various sects of them, all deriving from a
certain Nicolaus, whom Epiphanius would have us believe to have been one
of the first seven deacons of the Church.

If, in reality, however, the Nicolaïtans = the Balaamites of early
Talmudic Rabbinism, <span id="fr_143"></span>[1](#fn_143.md) then the
original Nicolaïtans were the earliest Christians, for “Balaamites” was
the Rabbinical by-name of the followers of Balaam (Bileam) = Jeschu, and
Balaam = Nicolaos, in Hebrew and Greek respectively.

Curiously enough, moreover, in the paragraph (§ 4) before the one from
which we are going to quote, Epiphanius ascribes the use of the mystic
words, “Kaulakau Kaulakau,” to the Nicolaïtans, words which we have,
with high probability, shown in the chapter “Myth of Man in the
Mysteries” (§ 16 J., end) to have been used by a Jewish Gnostic of the
time of Philo, writing in an Egyptian environment, and dealing with the
Man-tradition, which is one of the main elements of the “Pœmandres”
doctrine. All of which carries us back to the dawn of Christianity.

Speaking, then, of these Nicolaïtans, Epiphanius writes (xxv. 5):

“Others of them, again, plaster together empty names, saying: There was
Darkness and Abyss (βυθός) and Water; and Spirit in the midst of them
made separation of them.” <span id="fr_144"></span>[2](#fn_144.md)

Here we have precisely the same elements as in our text for the
foundation of a cosmogonical representation. What precise relationship
these various traditions may have had to one another we cannot say with
any certainty; but what we can say is that the writer or

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

writers of our treatise are dealing with a material common to
themselves, to pre-Christian Jewish Gnosticism and the earliest forms of
the Christian Gnosis.

##### THE “BOOKS OF THE CHALDÆANS”

The sentence (in § 2), “All things being undefined and yet unwrought
(ἀκατασκευάστων)” is also to be noticed, and, together with the opening
sentence of the cosmogony, compared with the LXX. version of Gen. i. 2:

“And the earth was invisible and as yet unwrought (ἀκατασκεύαστος), and
Darkness was upon the Abyss, and the Spirit of God was borne upon the
Water.”

Are we, then, to suppose that our Trismegistic writer based himself
directly upon this famous “oracle” of Jewish Scripture?

The Jewish Gnostics would doubtless do so in their commentaries; but the
phenomena of the Christianized Jewish Gnostic systems persuade us rather
that these Gnostic Jews did not derive their ideas directly from the
text of their national Scripture, but from what we may call parallel
traditions of an esoteric nature. We shall see later on, when treating
of Zosimus, that there were translations of the Chaldæan sacred books in
the Alexandrian Library, and we cannot but believe that the general
ideas of Chaldæan cosmogony were familiar to all the learned of the
time. For Chaldæa and Egypt were regarded as the two most wisdom-loving
nations of antiquity, the two most sacred lands. What wonder, then, that
Chaldæan and Egyptian ideas should be blended together, and turned out
into a “scientific” whole, by the spirit of Greek “philosophizing,” in
our treatises?

I would therefore conclude that both here, and in

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the repetition of the formula, “increase in increasing and multiply in
multitude” (§ 3), from the “Pœmandres” treatise (§ 18), the similarities
are not due to direct plagiarism, but to the fact that such *logoi* were
“in the air.” I would also suggest that the somewhat peculiar term
ἀκατασκεύαστος was not original with the Greek Targum of Genesis, first
made at Alexandria some 250 years B.C., but that it was rather taken
from the theological and philosophical language of the day and used by
the Hebrew translators; that, in brief, in the LXX. translation already
we have to take into account the strong influence of the technology of
Hellenistic theology.

With regard to the whole of our treatise, I would suggest that we have
the heads of topics which were to be subsequently explained and
commented upon, rather than a didactic treatise setting forth a clear
teaching. Like the proem, the cosmogenesis itself is straitly condensed,
so condensed that the indications are too vague for us to form any clear
mental picture of the process that is suggested. We have nothing but a
series of headings that may have meant something very definite to the
writer—may, in fact, have summed up for him a whole body of doctrine—but
which for us, in our ignorance of detail, can have but little precise
meaning.

To add to our difficulties, the text, as we have already said, appears
to be very faulty. It is very probable that owing to its original
brevity, copyists and readers would be tempted to gloss it in the
interests of what would appear to them greater clearness; these glosses
creeping into the text later on would, since the gloss-makers did not
know the original scheme, blurr rather than elucidate the
mother-text—and hence our tears.

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

The most striking doctrine in the exposition is that of Renewal or
Making-new-again (ἀνανέωσις). All animal and vegetable forms contain in
themselves “the seed of again-becoming” (τὸ σπέρμα τῆς παλιγγενεσίας). I
do not think that this is intended simply to mean that the individual is
continued in the species; for we read that “every birth of flesh
ensouled . . . shall of necessity renew itself (ἀνανεωθήσεται).” The
doctrine that is preached is, therefore, that of *palingenesis* or
“re-incarnation”; the renewal on the kārmic wheel of birth-and-death
(φύσεως κύκλου ἐναριθμίου δρόμημα).

##### THE “FLOOD”

The last point to which we need call the reader’s attention is the
sentence: “And there shall be memorials mighty of their handiworks upon
the earth, leaving dim trace behind when cycles are renewed.”

The thought of the writer is evidently turned back towards the past, to
a time when a mighty race, devoted to growth in wisdom, lived on earth
and left great monuments of their wisdom in the work of their hands, dim
traces of which were to be seen “in the renewal of the times.” This
seems to me to be a clear reference to the general belief of the time
(commonly, though erroneously, called Stoic) that there were alternate
periods of destruction, by fire and water, and of renewal. In Egypt the
common belief, as we have pointed out elsewhere, was that the last
destruction had been by water and flood. Before this Flood our author
believed there had been a mighty race of Egyptians, the race of the
First Hermes, and that some dim traces of the mighty works of this
bygone wisdom-loving civilization were still to be seen.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

I am, myself, strongly inclined to believe in this tradition; and I have
sometimes speculated as to the possibility of there being buried beneath
one or more of the pyramids the remains of some prehistoric buildings
(perhaps also of pyramid-shape) that have survived the “Flood.”
