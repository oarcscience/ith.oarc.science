#### COMMENTARY

##### CONCERNING THE TlTLE

Patrizzi has run (xvi.) and (xvii.) together, under the title
“Definitions of Asclepius—Book I.,” though he clearly saw that (xvii.)
did not belong to (xvi.) by his remark, “*videntur sequentia ex alio
libro sumpta.*” He also heads (xvii.) 1-10 “Definitions of
Asclepius—Book II.,” and 11-16 “D. of A.—Book III.,” though the contents
have evidently nothing to do with such a title.

In the MSS. a later hand has added to the general title a catalogue of
contents as follows:

“Of God; Matter; Evil; Fate; the Sun; Intelligible Essence; Divine
Essence; Man; the Economy of the Plērōma; the Seven Stars; the Man after
the Likeness” <span id="fr_611"></span>[1](#fn_610.md)—for which largely
irrelevant list Patrizzi substitutes the title: “Of the Sun and
Daimons.”

Reitzenstein (p. 192) is of opinion that this contents-list, and also
the similar headings in (xviii.), are due to some Byzantine scribe, who
also foolishly interpolated (xvii.).

But even to (xvi.) the title “Definitions of Asclepius” seems very
inappropriate; while, on the other hand, we find Lactantius (*D. I.*,
ii. 5), in referring to the “incursions of daimones,” claiming that it
was a doctrine also of Hermes, and adding:

“Asclepius, his hearer, has also explained the same idea at greater
length in that ‘Perfect Sermon’ which he wrote to the King.”

This is quite definite, and the authority of Lactantius should perhaps
be preferred to that of the MSS., but as the title would clash with “The
Perfect Sermon” of Hermes to Asclepius, and as Lactantius may just

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

possibly mean “in that initiatory sermon,”—the term *perfectus* being
used in a general and not in an appellative sense,—I have kept the
traditional title and placed that of Lactantius second.

##### A TRADITION CONCERNING THE TRISMEGISTIC LITERATURE

1\. Like “The Key”—*C. H.*, x. (xi.)—of Hermes, our treatise is an
Epitome <span id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_611.md); Asclepius has previously
written a number of Sermons to the King.

The reference to the “Conversations” between Hermes and Asclepius and
Tat, sometimes when both the latter were present and sometimes with
Asclepius alone, presupposes the existence of this class of Dialogue,
and indicates that the Correspondence of Asclepius with the King is a
later deposit of our literature. <span id="fr_613"></span>[2](#fn_612.md)

This literary activity of Asclepius is claimed in the introduction to be
authorized by Hermes, and, moreover, purports to have been originally
written in Demotic Egyptian. In other words, the writer would have us
believe that the Greek is a translation from Egyptian. This it clearly
is not; and we can only conclude that the “prophecy” as to direct
translation is a literary fiction of our author.

2\. On the other hand, it is highly probable that our author was in
contact with a living tradition, to the effect that the Hermes-teaching
was originally Egyptian, and that this was “interpreted” into Greek—that
is, into Greek modes of thought, rather than “translated” in the
ordinary sense into Greek.

In any case, the contempt shown by our author for the Greek language and
“philosophizing,” and his

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

admiration for Hieroglyphic Egyptian as a “language of the Gods”—a
magical tongue, that by its *māntric* power compelled the understanding
of the hearer, by putting him in sympathy with the ideas pictured by the
ideograms, or sounded forth by the “names of power” <span
id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_613.md)—show that he was not only not a Greek,
but also no lover of Greek Philosophy.

This is exceedingly puzzling, seeing not only that the majority of the
writers of our tractates are plainly deep students and lovers of Plato,
but also that the author of our tractate himself also writes very much
in the same style as they do.

All of this seems to indicate that in his introduction he was using for
his own purposes some tradition about the ancient Thoth-literature that
was current in his time. A form of this tradition was also made use of
by Philo of Byblus in the first century, when he makes the Phœnician
priest Sanchuniathon discover the origin of the Phœnician cosmogony and
mystery-teaching in the Books of Taautos, “whom the Egyptian called
Thoyth, the Alexandrians Thoth, and the Greeks changed into Hermes.”

Sanchuniathon, he says, “having come across the secret writings that had
been discovered and brought from the shrines of the Temples of
Ammon,—compositions which were not known to all,—practised by himself
the science (τῆν μάθησιν) of all things.” <span
id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_614.md)

Philo also professes to quote from one of the earliest priests of
Phœnicia, a certain Thabiōn, who is said apparently to have got his
information from a writing of the Seven Kabiri, and of Asclepius, the
pupil of Taautos. This Thabiōn asserted that Taautos was made King of
Egypt by Kronos—that is, Ammon. <span id="fr_616"></span>[3](#fn_615.md)

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

Here we are evidently in contact with certain traditions with regard to
Thoth-Hermes, his ancestors and pupils, and secret writings. Presumably
many such traditions were floating about, and were used according to the
fancy and taste of Hellenistic writers for their own purposes.

But there was also another tradition concerning a certain King Ammon,
used in one form by Jamblichus, when he writes:

“It was Hermes who first taught this Path \[*sc.* the Way up to God\].
And Bitys, <span id="fr_617"></span>[1](#fn_616.md) the Prophet, translated
\[his teachings concerning it\] for King Ammon, discovering them in the
inner temple in an inscription in the sacred characters at Saïs in
Egypt.” <span id="fr_618"></span>[2](#fn_617.md)

What our author and Jamblichus have in common is that there were certain
secret teachings of Hermes in the Sacred Language of Ancient Egypt
hidden away in the inner shrines of the temples, and that these were
translated into the current Egyptian language of the time for a certain
King Ammon.

It must, then, have been some tradition of this kind that our author or
writer had in mind; he would have it believed that he was writing in the
style or according to the model of a certain literature.

Who this King Ammon was can only be guessed at; but to my mind it is
probable that the “translations” of Bitys were made in connection with
the translation activity of Manetho for King Ptolemy, and this
translation was into Greek. Our author, however, would refer it to some
Egyptian King, and so seek to invoke the authority of a high antiquity
for the treatise he was putting into circulation.

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

##### A SPECULATION AS TO DATE

5\. What seems to differentiate our treatise from the rest of the
tractates, is the prominence its author gives to the doctrine of the Sun
as Demiurgic Orderer of all things. This so to speak pantheistic form of
Sun-worship is peculiarly Egyptian. <span
id="fr_619"></span>[1](#fn_618.md)

Now if we remember the disdainful way in which Greek “philosophizing” is
spoken of in the introduction, we may be tempted to take the sentence,
“And *if* there be any essence which the mind alone can grasp” (§ 6), as
a somewhat patronizing reference to the Intelligible World of Greek
Philosophy, as also the analogy in § 12; but when we turn to §§ 17 and
18 the exposition fully adopts the doctrine of the Intelligible and
Sensible Worlds. This is so irreconcilable a contradiction that one is
almost compelled to believe that the introduction is by another hand
altogether, and that our sermon proper begins with § 3.

But even so, the sermon is addressed to some King or other—“The Perfect
Sermon to the King” of Lactantius—without any further qualification.
Who, however, this King may have been historically must remain a matter
of pure conjecture.

7\. When, then, Reitzenstein, pointing to § 7, says that the symbolism
of the Sun as a charioteer wearing a crown of rays corresponds with that
of the pictures of the Aurelian Sun-god, and adds further it is the
Roman Empire-god of the third century, we are quite prepared to
acknowledge a similarity of symbolism. But if it is intended to suggest
that, therefore, we are to date our document by this similarity, it must
be admitted that the indications are far too vague; for the symbolism of
the Sun as the ray-crowned charioteer

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

is fundamental with the cult of Mithras, and is found in Greece long
before the Aurelian period.

##### THE DELINEATION OF THE SUN

It is interesting, however, here to notice that the Sun is “wreathed
with cosmos,” and to compare this with the passage concerning the
Macro-prosopus in the *Untitled Apocalypse* of the Coptic Gnostic Codex
Brucianus, and especially with the sentence:

“The Hair of His Head is the number of the Hidden Worlds, and the
Outline of His Face is the Type of the Æons.” <span
id="fr_620"></span>[1](#fn_619.md)

In this *Untitled Apocalypse* there is a strong Egyptian
under-colouring; that, however, the idea of a crown of powers was
pre-eminently Egyptian may be seen from many a passage in the *Pistis
Sophia.*

8\. It is also of interest to notice that the delineation of the Sun in
§ 8 reminds us of the Orphic Phanes, especially the reference to the two
hemispheres above and below,—the two parts of the Egg in Orphic
symbolism.

9\. The hint that the sun-life runs in some sort of spiral or serpentine
fashion in animals, and that this also is the case with the Great Bodies
or Celestial Animals, is of interest.

##### CONCERNING THE DAIMONES

10\. Our author then proceeds to set forth his doctrine of the daimones
or ministers of the Gods, who are assigned to the lower hemisphere of
operation, from the Earth to the Sun, the Gods presumably occupying the
higher hemisphere of activity. These daimones are what a Hindu or
Buddhist would call kārmic agents, for they are all connected with what
is called the Fate-

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sphere, the
Instrument or the Wheel of Genesis, or Saṁsāra.

15\. These daimones rule over the lower energies of the soul; the higher
energy or rational part of the soul is set above them, and is designed
to be the “receptacle of God,”—or rather of His Ray,—the Mind proper.

16\. With § 16 compare the remarkable passage in one of the Letters of
Valentinus:

“One \[alone\] is Good, whose free utterance is His manifestation
through His Son; it is by Him alone that the heart can become pure, when
every evil essence has been expelled from it.

“Now its purity is prevented by the many essences which take up their
abode in it, for each of them accomplishes its own deeds, outraging it
in divers fashions with unseemly lusts.

“As far as I can see, the heart seems to receive somewhat the same
treatment as an inn \[or caravanserai\], which has holes and gaps made
in its walls, and is frequently filled with dung, men living filthily in
it and taking no care of the place as being someone else’s property.
Thus is it with the heart so long as it has no care taken of it, ever
unclean and the abode of many daimons.

“But when the Alone Good Father hath regard unto it, it is sanctified
and shineth with light; and he who possesseth such a heart is so blessed
that ‘he shall see God.’” <span id="fr_621"></span>[1](#fn_620.md)

The language of Valentinus is remarkably like that of our treatises;
Valentinus himself was an Egyptian.

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

17\. Entirely Egyptian also is the Scheme of Dependency given in § 17,
as we have already pointed out on several occasions, quoting from a Hymn
of Valentinus.

The sentence: “Wherefore God is the Sire of all; the Sun’s \[their\]
Demiurge”—distinctly contradicts Reitzenstein’s (p. 198, 1) statement
that the Sun in our treatise is worshipped as the All-god. The Sun is He
“by whom all things are made,”—the Creative Logos of God. <span
id="fr_622"></span>[1](#fn_621.md)

19\. The treatise is evidently incomplete; if, however, we turn to the
contents-title given at the beginning of these comments we can gain but
little information as to what is missing, for the contents there given
do not in any but the vaguest fashion correspond to the substance of our
treatise, nor do the subjects treated of come in the same order as in
the contents-heading. The Divine Essence, Man, the Economy of the
Plērōma and the Man after the Likeness, which are clearly not treated of
in our text, *may* then have been treated in the missing portion of our
tractate; but this is all we can say.
