#### CORPUS HERMETICUM VII. (VIII.)

### THE GREATEST ILL AMONG MEN IS IGNORANCE OF GOD

<span class="small">(Text: P. 54, 55; Pat. 18a.)</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">Whither</span> stumble ye, sots, who have
sopped up the wine of ignorance unmixed, and can so far not carry it
that ye already even spew it forth?

Stay ye, be sober, gaze upwards with the \[true\] eyes of the heart! And
if ye cannot all, yet ye at least who can!

For that the ill of ignorance doth pour o’er all the earth and overwhelm
the soul that’s battened down within the body, preventing it from
fetching port within Salvation’s harbours.

2\. Be then not carried off by the fierce flood, but using the
shore-current, <span id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) ye who can, make
for Salvation’s port, and, harbouring there, seek ye for one to take you
by the hand and lead you <span id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) unto
Gnosis’ gates.

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Where shines clear Light, of every darkness clean; where not a single
soul is drunk, but sober all they gaze with their hearts’ eyes on Him
who willeth to be seen.

No ear can hear Him, nor can eye see Him, nor tongue speak of Him, but
\[only\] mind and heart.

But first thou must tear off from thee the cloak which thou dost
wear,—the web of ignorance, the ground of bad, corruption’s chain, the
carapace of darkness, the living death, sensation’s corpse, the tomb
thou carriest with thee, the robber in thy house, who through the things
he loveth, hateth thee, and through the things he hateth, bears thee
malice.

3\. Such is the hateful cloak thou wearest,—that throttles thee \[and
holds thee\] down to it, in order that thou may’st not gaze above, and,
having seen the Beauty of the Truth, and Good that dwells therein,
detest the bad of it; having found out the plot that it hath schemed
against thee, by making void of sense those seeming things which men
think senses.

For that it hath with mass of matter blocked them up and crammed them
full of loathsome lust, so that thou may’st not hear about the things
that thou should’st hear, nor see the things that thou should’st see.
