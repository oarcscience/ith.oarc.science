### THE SACRED SERMON

##### OF HERMES

<span class="small">(Text: P. 31-33; Pat. 8b-9.)</span>

1\. <span class="smallcaps">The</span> Glory of all things is God,
Godhead and Godly Nature. Source of the things that are is God, who is
both Mind and Nature,—yea Matter, the Wisdom that reveals all things.
Source \[too\] is Godhead,—yea Nature, Energy, Necessity, and End, and
Making-new-again. <span id="fr_134"></span>[1](#fn_134)

Darkness that knew no bounds was in Abyss, and Water \[too\] and subtle
Breath intelligent; these were by Power of God in Chaos.

Then Holy Light arose; and there collected ’neath Dry Space <span
id="fr_135"></span>[2](#fn_135) from out Moist Essence

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Elements; and all
the Gods do separate things out from fecund Nature.

2\. All things being undefined and yet unwrought, the light things were
assigned unto the height, the heavy ones had their foundations laid down
underneath the moist part of Dry Space, <span
id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136) the universal things being bounded off
by Fire and hanged in Breath to keep them up.

And <span id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137) Heaven was seen in seven
circles; its Gods were visible in forms of stars with all their signs;
while Nature had her members made articulate together with the Gods in
her. And \[Heaven’s\] periphery revolved in cyclic course, borne on by
Breath of God.

3\. And every God by his own proper power brought forth what was
appointed him. Thus there arose four-footed beasts, and creeping things,
and those that in the water dwell, and things with wings, and everything
that beareth seed, and grass, and shoot of every flower, all having in
themselves seed of again-becoming. <span id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_138)

And they selected out <span id="fr_139"></span>[4](#fn_139) the
births <span id="fr_140"></span>[5](#fn_140) of men for gnosis of the
works of God and attestation of the energy of Nature; the multitude of
men for

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

lordship over all beneath the Heaven and gnosis of its blessings, that
they might increase in increasing and multiply in multitude, and every
soul infleshed by revolution of the Cyclic Gods, for observation of the
marvels of the Heaven and Heaven’s Gods’ revolution, and of the works of
God and energy of Nature, for tokens of its blessings, for gnosis of the
power of God, that they might know the fates that follow good and evil
\[deeds\] and learn the cunning work of all good arts.

4\. \[Thus\] there begins their living and their growing wise, according
to the fate appointed by the revolution of the Cyclic Gods, and their
deceasing for this end.

And there shall be memorials mighty of their handiworks upon the earth,
leaving dim trace behind when cycles are renewed.

For every birth of flesh ensouled, and of the fruit of seed, and every
handiwork, though it decay, shall of necessity renew itself, both by the
renovation of the Gods and by the turning-round of Nature’s rhythmic
wheel.

For that whereas the Godhead is Nature’s ever-making-new-again the
cosmic mixture, Nature herself is also co-established in that Godhead.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_134"></span>[75:1](th207.htm#fr_134) *Cf.* *P. S. A.*, xxvi
2.

<span id="fn_135"></span>[75:2](th207.htm#fr_135) Lit. “Sand”; this
presumably refers to the Light, and would thus mean “within the area or
sphere of Light”—that is to say, manifestation. The “Moist Essence” is
apparently the Water of Chaos, or primal substance.

<span id="fn_136"></span>[76:1](th207.htm#fr_136) ὑφ᾽ ὑγρᾷ ἄμμῳ;
presumably the “Water” of space. The heavy things are apparently
primæval or cosmic “Earth.”

<span id="fn_137"></span>[76:2](th207.htm#fr_137) The emended text from
here to the end of the first sentence of § 3 is given by R. 47, n. 1.

<span id="fn_138"></span>[76:3](th207.htm#fr_138) Or “reincarnation”
(παλιγγενεσίας).

<span id="fn_139"></span>[76:4](th207.htm#fr_139) ἐσπερμολόγουν.

<span id="fn_140"></span>[76:5](th207.htm#fr_140) τὰς γενέσεις.
