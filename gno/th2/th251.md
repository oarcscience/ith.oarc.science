*Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2*, by G.R.S. Mead, \[1906\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

4\. \[XV. M.\] And now it hath been told you on each several point,—as
man hath power \[to tell\], and God hath willed it and permitted it.

This, then, alone remains that we should do,—bless God and give Him
praise; and so return to taking thought for body \[’s comfort\].

For now sufficiently have we been filled with feast of mind by our
discourse on sacred things. <span id="fr_957"></span>[5](#fn_956)

1\. Now when they came forth from the holy place, <span
id="fr_958"></span>[1](#fn_957) they turned their faces towards the
south <span id="fr_959"></span>[2](#fn_958) when they began their
prayers to God.

For when the sun is setting, should anyone desire to pray to God, he
ought to turn him thitherwards <span id="fr_960"></span>[3](#fn_959); so
also at the rising of the same, unto that spot which lies beneath the
sun. <span id="fr_961"></span>[4](#fn_960)

As they were just beginning to recite the prayer, Asclepius did whisper:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[*Asc.*\] Let us suggest to father, Tat,—what he did bid us do, <span
id="fr_962"></span>[5](#fn_961)—that we should say our prayer to God
with added incense and with unguents.

Whom when Thrice-greatest heard, he grew distressed and said:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2\. \[*Tris.*\] Nay, nay, Asclepius; speak more propitious words! For
this is like to profanation of \[our\] sacred rites,—when thou dost pray
to God, to offer incense and the rest.

For naught is there of which He stands in need, in that He is all
things, or all are in Him.

<span id="page_389">p. 389</span>

But let us worship, pouring forth our thanks. For this is the best
incense in God’s sight,—when thanks are given to Him by men. <span
id="fr_963"></span>[1](#fn_962)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3\. \[We give\] Thee grace, Thou highest \[and\] most excellent! For by
Thy Grace we have received the so great Light of Thy own Gnosis.

O holy Name, fit \[Name\] to be adored, O Name unique, by which the Only
God <span id="fr_964"></span>[2](#fn_963) is to be blest through worship
of \[our\] Sire,—\[of Thee\] who deignest to afford to all a Father’s
piety, and care, and love, and whatsoever virtue is more sweet \[than
these\], endowing \[us\] with sense, \[and\] reason, \[and\]
intelligence;—with sense that we may feel Thee; with reason that we may
track Thee out from the appearances of things <span
id="fr_965"></span>[3](#fn_964); with means of recognition that we may
joy in knowing Thee.

4\. Saved by Thy Power divine, let us rejoice that Thou hast shown
Thyself to us in all Thy Fullness. Let us rejoice that Thou hast deigned
to consecrate us, \[still\] entombed in bodies, to Eternity.

For this is the sole festival of praise worthy of man,—to know Thy
Majesty.

We have known Thee; yea, by the Single Sense of our intelligence, we
have perceived

<span id="page_390">p. 390</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Thy Light
supreme,—O Thou true Life of life, O Fecund Womb that giveth birth to
every nature!

5\. We have known Thee, O Thou completely filled with the Conception
from Thyself of Universal Nature!

We have known Thee, O Thou Eternal Constancy!

For in the whole of this our prayer in worship of Thy Good, this favour
only of Thy Goodness do we crave;—that Thou wilt keep us constant in our
Love of knowing Thee, <span id="fr_966"></span>[1](#fn_965) and let us
ne’er be cut off from this kind of Life.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this desire we \[now\] betake us to \[our\] pure and fleshless
meal. <span id="fr_967"></span>[2](#fn_966)

from,” literally.

<span id="fn_958"></span>[388:2](th251.htm#fr_959) This is apparently an
error for south-west or west.

<span id="fn_959"></span>[388:3](th251.htm#fr_960) That is, to the
setting sun or the west. *Cf.* *C. H.*, xiii. (xiv.) 16, Comment.

presumably, as the One God.
