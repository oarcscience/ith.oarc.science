*Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2*, by G.R.S. Mead, \[1906\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### XIX

1\. \[VIII. M.\] *Asc.* What dost thou call, Thrice-greatest one, the
heads of things, or sources of beginnings?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* Great are the mysteries which I reveal to thee, divine the
secrets I disclose; and so I

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

make beginning of this thing <span id="fr_795"></span>[1](#fn_794) with
prayers for Heaven’s favour.

The hierarchies <span id="fr_796"></span>[2](#fn_795) of Gods are
numerous; and of them all one class is called the Noumenal, <span
id="fr_797"></span>[3](#fn_796) the other \[class\] the Sensible. <span
id="fr_798"></span>[4](#fn_797)

The former are called Noumenal, not for the reason that they’re thought
to lie beyond *our* <span id="fr_799"></span>[5](#fn_798) senses; for
these are just the Gods *we* sense more truly than the ones we call the
visible,—just as our argument will prove, and thou, if thou attend, wilt
be made fit to see.

For that a lofty reasoning, and much more one that is too godlike for
the mental grasp of \[average\] men, if that the speaker’s words are not
received <span id="fr_800"></span>[6](#fn_799) with more attentive
service of the ears,—will fly and flow beyond them; or rather will flow
back \[again\], and mingle with the streams of its own source. <span
id="fr_801"></span>[7](#fn_800)

2\. There are, then, \[certain\] Gods who are the principals <span
id="fr_802"></span>[8](#fn_801) of all the species.

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

Next there come those whose essence <span
id="fr_803"></span>[1](#fn_802) is their principal. These are the
Sensible, each similar to its own dual source, <span
id="fr_804"></span>[2](#fn_803) who by their sensibility <span
id="fr_805"></span>[3](#fn_804) affect all things,—the one part through
the other part \[in each\] making to shine the proper work of every
single one.

Of Heaven,—or of whatsoe’er it be that is embraced within the term,—the
essence-chief <span id="fr_806"></span>[4](#fn_805) is Zeus; for ’tis
through Heaven that Zeus gives life to all.

Sun’s essence-chief is light; for the good gift of light is poured on us
through the Sun’s disk.

3\. The “Thirty-six,” who have the name of Horoscopes, <span
id="fr_807"></span>[5](#fn_806) are in the \[self\] same space as the
Fixed Stars; of these the essence-chief, or prince, is he whom they call
Pantomorph, or Omniform, <span id="fr_808"></span>[6](#fn_807) who
fashioneth the various forms for various species.

The “Seven” who are called spheres, have essence-chiefs, that is, \[have
each\] their proper rulers, whom they call \[all together\] Fortune and
Heimarmenē, <span id="fr_809"></span>[7](#fn_808) whereby all things are
changed

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

by nature’s law; perpetual stability being varied with incessant
motion. <span id="fr_810"></span>[1](#fn_809)

The Air, moreover, is the engine, or machine, through which all things
are made—(there is, however, an essence-chief of this, a second
\[Air\])—mortal from mortal things and things like these. <span
id="fr_811"></span>[2](#fn_810)

4\. These hierarchies of Gods, then, being thus and \[in this way\]
related, <span id="fr_812"></span>[3](#fn_811) from bottom unto top, are
\[also\] thus connected with each other, and tend towards themselves; so
mortal things are bound to mortal, things sensible to sensible.

The whole of \[this grand scale of\] Rulership, however, seems to Him
\[who is\] the Highest Lord, either to be not many things, or rather
\[to be\] one.

For that from One all things depending, <span
id="fr_813"></span>[4](#fn_812) and flowing down from it,—when they are
seen as

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

separate, they’re thought to be as many as they possibly can be; but in
their union it is one \[thing\], or rather two, from which all things
are made;—that is, from Matter, by means of which the other things are
made, and by the Will of Him, by nod of whom they’re brought to pass.

#### XX

1\. *Asc.* Is this again *the* reason, O Thrice-greatest one?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* It is, Asclepius. For God’s the Father or the Lord of all, or
whatsoever else may be the name by which He’s named more holily and
piously by men,—which should be set apart among ourselves for sake of
our intelligence.

For if we contemplate this so transcendent God, we shall not make Him
definite by any of these names.

For if a \[spoken\] word <span id="fr_814"></span>[1](#fn_813) is
this:—a sound proceeding from the air, when struck by breath, <span
id="fr_815"></span>[2](#fn_814) denoting the whole will, perchance, of
man, or else the \[higher\] sense, which by good chance a man perceives
by means of mind, when out of \[all his\] senses, <span
id="fr_816"></span>[3](#fn_815)—a name the stuff of which,

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

made of a syllable or two, has so been limited and pondered, that it
might serve in man as necessary link between the voice and ear;—thus
\[must\] the Name of God in full consist of Sense, and Spirit, and of
Air, and of all things in them, or through, or with them. <span
id="fr_817"></span>[1](#fn_816)

2\. Indeed, I have no hope that the Creator of the whole of Greatness,
the Father and the Lord of all the things \[that are\], could ever have
one name, even although it should be made up of a multitude—He who
cannot be named, or rather He who can be called by every name.

For He, indeed, is One and All <span id="fr_818"></span>[2](#fn_817); so
that it needs must be that all things should be called by the same name
as His, or He Himself called by the names of all.

3\. He, then, alone, yet all-complete in the fertility of either sex,
ever with child of His own Will, doth ever bring to birth whatever He
hath willed to procreate.

His Will is the All-goodness, which also is the Goodness of all things,
born from the nature of His own Divinity,—in order that all things may
be, just as they all have been, and that henceforth the nature of being
born from their own selves may be sufficient to all things that will be
born.

<span id="page_345">p. 345</span>

Let this, then, be the reason given thee, Asclepius, wherefore and how
all things are made of either sex.

#### XXI

1\. *Asc.* Thou speak’st of God, then, O Thrice-greatest one?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* Not only God, Asclepius, but all things living and inanimate.
For ’tis impossible that any of the things that are should be
unfruitful.

For if fecundity should be removed from all the things that are, it
could not be that they should be for ever what they are. I mean that
Nature, <span id="fr_819"></span>[1](#fn_818) Sense, and Cosmos, have in
themselves the power of being born, <span
id="fr_820"></span>[2](#fn_819) and of preserving all things that are
born.

For either sex is full of procreation; and of each one there is a union,
or,—what’s more true,—a unity incomprehensible; which you may rightly
call Erōs <span id="fr_821"></span>[3](#fn_820) or Aphroditē, or both
\[names\].

2\. This, then, is truer than all truth, and plainer than what the mind
\[’s eye\] perceives;—that from that Universal God of Universal Nature
all other things for evermore have found, and had bestowed on them, the
mystery of

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

bringing forth; in which there is innate the sweetest Charity, \[and\]
Joy, \[and\] Merriment, Longing, and Love Divine.

We might have had to tell the mighty power and the compulsion of this
mystery, if it had not been able to be known by every one from personal
experience, by observation of himself.

3\. For if thou should’st regard that supreme \[point\] of time
when . . . <span id="fr_822"></span>[1](#fn_821) the one nature doth
pour forth the young into the other one, and when the other greedily
absorbs \[it\] from the first, and hides it \[ever\] deeper \[in
itself\]; then, at that time, out of their common congress, females
attain the nature of the males, males weary grow with female
listlessness.

And so the consummation of this mystery, so sweet and requisite, is
wrought in secret; lest, owing to the vulgar jests of ignorance, the
deity of either sex should be compelled to blush at natural
congress,—and much more still, if it should be subjected to the sight of
impious folk.

#### XXII

1\. The pious are not numerous, however; nay, they are very few, so that
they may be counted even in the world. <span
id="fr_823"></span>[2](#fn_822)

Whence it doth come about, that in the many

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

bad inheres, through defect of the Gnosis and Discernment of the things
that are.

For that it is from the intelligence of Godlike Reason, <span
id="fr_824"></span>[1](#fn_823) by which all things are ordered, there
come to birth contempt and remedy of vice throughout the world.

But when unknowingness and ignorance persist, all vicious things wax
strong, and plague the soul with wounds incurable; so that, infected
with them, and invitiated, it swells up, as though it were with
poisons,—except for those who know the Discipline of souls and highest
Cure of intellect.

2\. So, then, although it may do good to few alone, ’tis proper to
develope and explain this thesis:—wherefore Divinity hath deigned to
share His science and intelligence with men alone. Give ear,
accordingly!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

When God, \[our\] Sire and Lord, made man, after the Gods, out of an
equal mixture of a less pure cosmic part and a divine,—it \[naturally\]
came to pass the imperfections <span id="fr_825"></span>[2](#fn_824) of
the cosmic part remained commingled with \[our\] frames, and other
ones <span id="fr_826"></span>[3](#fn_825) \[as well\], by reason of the
food and sustenance we have out of necessity in common with all
lives <span id="fr_827"></span>[4](#fn_826); by reason of which

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

things it needs must be that the desires, and passions, and other vices,
of the mind should occupy the souls of human kind.

3\. As for the Gods, in as much as they had been made of Nature’s
fairest <span id="fr_828"></span>[1](#fn_827) part, and have no need of
the supports of reason and of discipline, <span
id="fr_829"></span>[2](#fn_828)—although, indeed, their deathlessness,
the very strength of being ever of one single age, stands in this case
for prudence and for science, still, for the sake of reason’s unity,
instead of science and of intellect (so that the Gods should not be
strange to these),—He, by His everlasting law, decreed for them an
order, <span id="fr_830"></span>[3](#fn_829) circumscribed by the
necessity of law.

While as for man, He doth distinguish him from all the other animals by
reason and by discipline alone; by means of which men can remove and
separate their bodies’ vices,—He helping them to hope and effort after
deathlessness.

4\. In fine, He hath made man both good and able to share in immortal
life,—out of two natures, \[one\] mortal, \[one\] divine.

And just because he is thus fashioned by the Will of God, it is
appointed that man should be superior both to the Gods, who have been
made

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

of an immortal nature only, and also to all mortal things.

It is because of this that man, being joined unto the Gods by
kinsmanship, doth reverence them with piety and holy mind; while, on
their side, the Gods with pious sympathy regard and guard all things of
men.

#### XXIII

1\. But this can only be averred of a few men endowed with pious minds.
Still, of the rest, the vicious folk, we ought to say no word, for fear
a very sacred sermon should be spoiled by thinking of them.

<span id="fn_798"></span>[340:5](th244.htm#fr_799) That is, the “Sense”
of those who have reached the “Trismegistic” grade, though of course
beyond the range of the normal senses.

<span id="fn_799"></span>[340:6](th244.htm#fr_800) The text is faulty.

essence and sensibility.

<span id="fn_804"></span>[341:3](th244.htm#fr_805) That is, presumably,
their power of affecting the senses.

<span id="fn_805"></span>[341:4](th244.htm#fr_806) The Greek οὐσιάρχης
is retained in the Latin.

<span id="fn_806"></span>[341:5](th244.htm#fr_807) *Horoscopi* (=
ὡροσκόποι); generally called Decans; *cf.* Ex. ix., where the Decans are

εἱμαρμένη.

<span id="fn_809"></span>[342:1](th244.htm#fr_810) Quoted in the
original Greek by Ioan. Laurentius Lydus, *De Mensibus*, iv. 7; Wünsch
(Leipzig, 1898), p. 70, 22; as follows: “And Hermes is witness in his
\[book\], called ‘The Perfect Sermon,’ when saying: ‘They that are
called the Seven Spheres have a Source that is called Fortune or Fate,
which changes all things and suffers them not to remain in the same
\[conditions\].’” The quotation is continued without a break; the rest
of it, however, corresponds to nothing in our context, but is somewhat
similar to ch. xxxix. 1, 2.

<span id="fn_810"></span>[342:2](th244.htm#fr_811) That is, the region
of things subject to death. The text is faulty. *Cf.* with this “engine”
the “cylinder” of the *K. K.* Fragments (10).

<span id="fn_811"></span>[342:3](th244.htm#fr_812) *Ab imo ad summum se
admoventibus*; for *admoventibus* compare “*genus admotum superis*,”
Silius Italicus, viii. 295.

<span id="fn_812"></span>[342:4](th244.htm#fr_813) *Cf.* iv. 1 above,
and the note.

<span id="fn_813"></span>[343:1](th244.htm#fr_814) *Vox* (= name),
presumably λόγος in the original; a play on “word” and “reason,” but
also referring to the mysterious “name” of a person.

<span id="fn_814"></span>[343:2](th244.htm#fr_815) *Spiritu*, or spirit.

<span id="fn_815"></span>[343:3](th244.htm#fr_816) *Ex sensibus* =
presumably, in ecstasis.

<span id="fn_816"></span>[344:1](th244.htm#fr_817) The text of this
paragraph is very unsatisfactory.

<span id="fn_817"></span>[344:2](th244.htm#fr_818) *Cf.* i. 1 above.

<span id="fn_818"></span>[345:1](th244.htm#fr_819) Here, presumably,
meaning *hyle.*

<span id="fn_819"></span>[345:2](th244.htm#fr_820) *Naturam* again.

<span id="fn_825"></span>[347:3](th244.htm#fr_826) *Sc.* imperfections.

<span id="fn_826"></span>[347:4](th244.htm#fr_827) Lit. animals.

<span id="fn_827"></span>[348:1](th244.htm#fr_828) *Mundissima*—that is,
most cosmic, or “adorned.”

<span id="fn_828"></span>[348:2](th244.htm#fr_829) Or science.

<span id="fn_829"></span>[348:3](th244.htm#fr_830) *Ordinem*—that is,
Cosmos. Compare this also with the idea of the Gnostic Horos which
“surrounds” the Plērōma.
