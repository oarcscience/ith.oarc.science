### TO ASCLEPIUS

<span class="small">(Text: P. 19-30; Pat. 18b-20.)</span>

\*          \*          \*          \*          \*

1\. *Hermes.* <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md) All that is moved,
Asclepius, is it not moved *in* something and *by* something?

*Asclepius.* Assuredly.

*Her.* And must not that in which it’s moved be greater than the moved?

*Asc.* It must.

*Her.* Mover, again, has greater power than moved?

*Asc.* It has, of course.

*Her.* The nature, furthermore, of that in which it’s moved must be
quite other from the nature of the moved?

*Asc.* It must completely.

2\. *Her.* Is not, again, this cosmos vast, \[so vast\] that than it
there exists no body greater?

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

*Asc.* Assuredly.

*Her.* And massive too, for it is crammed with multitudes of other
mighty frames, nay rather all the other bodies that there are?

*Asc.* It is.

*Her.* And yet the cosmos is a body?

*Asc.* It is a body.

*Her.* And one that’s moved?

3\. *Asc.* Assuredly.

*Her.* Of what size, then, must be the space in which it’s moved; and of
what kind \[must be\] the nature \[of that space\]? Must it not be far
vaster \[than the cosmos\], in order that it may be able to find room
for its continued course, so that the moved may not be cramped for want
of room and lose its motion?

*Asc.* Something, Thrice-greatest one, it needs must be, immensely vast.

4\. *Her.* And of what nature? Must it not be, Asclepius, of just the
contrary? And is not contrary to body bodiless?

*Asc.* Agreed.

*Her.* Space, then, is bodiless. But bodiless must either be some
godlike thing or God \[Himself\]. And by “some godlike thing” I mean no
more the generable but the ingenerable. <span
id="fr_114"></span>[1](#fn_114.md)

<span id="page_61">p. 61</span>

5\. If, then, space be some godlike thing, it is substantial <span
id="fr_115"></span>[1](#fn_115.md); but if ’tis God \[Himself\], it
transcends substance. But it is to be thought of otherwise \[than God\],
and in this way.

God is first “thinkable” <span id="fr_116"></span>[2](#fn_116.md) for us,
not for Himself, for that the thing that’s thought doth fall beneath the
thinker’s sense. God then can not be “thinkable” unto Himself, in that
He’s thought of by Himself as being nothing else than what He thinks.
But He is “something else” for us, and so He’s thought of by us.

6\. If space is, therefore, to be thought, \[it should\] not, \[then, be
thought as\] God, but space. If God is also to be thought, \[He should\]
not \[be conceived\] as space, but energy that can contain \[all
space\].

Further, <span id="fr_117"></span>[3](#fn_117.md) all that is moved is
moved not in the moved but in the stable. And that which moves
\[another\] is of course stationary, for ’tis impossible that it should
move with it.

*Asc.* How is it, then, that things down here, Thrice-greatest one, are
moved *with* those that are \[already\] moved? For thou hast said <span
id="fr_118"></span>[4](#fn_118.md) the errant spheres were moved by the
inerrant one.

*Her.* This is not, O Asclepius, a moving *with*, but one *against*;
they are not moved *with*

<span id="page_62">p. 62</span>

one another, but one *against* the other. It is this contrariety which
turneth the resistance of their motion into rest. For that resistance is
the rest of motion.

7\. Hence, too, the errant spheres, being moved contrarily to the
inerrant one, are moved by one another by mutual contrariety, \[and
also\] by the stable one through contrariety itself. And this can
otherwise not be.

The Bears <span id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md) up there, which neither
set nor rise, think’st thou they rest or move?

*Asc.* They move, Thrice-greatest one.

*Her.* And what their motion, my Asclepius?

*Asc.* Motion that turns for ever round the same.

*Her.* But revolution—motion round same—is fixed by rest. For
“round-the-same” doth stop “beyond-same.” “Beyond-same” then, being
stopped, if it be steadied in “round-same”—the contrary stands firm,
being rendered ever stable by its contrariety.

8\. Of this I’ll give thee here on earth an instance, which the eye can
see. Regard the animals down here,—a man, for instance, swimming! The
water moves, yet the resistance of his hands and feet give him
stability, so that he is not borne along with it, nor sunk thereby.

<span id="page_63">p. 63</span>

*Asc.* Thou hast, Thrice-greatest one, adduced a most clear instance.

*Her.* All motion, then, is caused in station and by station.

The motion, therefore, of the cosmos (and of every other hylic
animal <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120).md) will not be caused by
things exterior to the cosmos, but by things interior \[outward\] to the
exterior—such \[things\] as soul, or spirit, or some such other thing
incorporal.

’Tis not its body that doth move the living thing in it; nay, not even
the whole \[body of the universe a lesser\] body e’en though there be no
life in it. <span id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121.md)

9\. *Asc.* What meanest thou by this, Thrice-greatest one? Is it not
bodies, then, that move the stock and stone and all the other things
inanimate?

*Her.* By no means, O Asclepius. The something-in-the-body, the
that-which-moves the thing inanimate, this surely’s not a body, for that
it moves the two of them—both body of the lifter and the lifted? So that
a thing that’s lifeless will not move a lifeless thing. That which doth
move \[another thing\] is animate, in that it is the mover.

Thou seest, then, how heavy laden is the soul,

<span id="page_64">p. 64</span>

for it alone doth lift two bodies. That things, moreover, moved are
moved *in* something as well as moved by something is clear.

10\. *Asc.* Yea, <span id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) O Thrice-greatest
one, things moved must needs be moved in something void. <span
id="fr_123"></span>[2](#fn_123.md)

*Her.* Thou sayest well, O \[my\] Asclepius! <span
id="fr_124"></span>[3](#fn_124.md) For naught of things that are is void.
Alone the “is-not” ’s void \[and\] stranger to subsistence. For that
which is subsistent can never change to void. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[4](#fn_125.md)

*Asc.* Are there, then, O Thrice-greatest one, no such things as an
empty cask, for instance, and an empty jar, a cup and vat, and other
things like unto them?

*Her.* Alack, Asclepius, for thy far-wandering from the truth! Think’st
thou that things most full and most replete are void?

11\. *Asc.* How meanest thou, Thrice-greatest one?

*Her.* Is not air body?

*Asc.* It is.

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

*Her.* And doth this body not pervade all things, and so, pervading,
fill them? And “body”; doth body not consist from blending of the
“four”? Full, then, of air are all thou callest void; and if of air,
then of the “four.” <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md)

Further, of this the converse follows, that all thou callest full are
void—of air; for that they have their space filled out with other
bodies, and, therefore, are not able to receive the air therein. These,
then, which thou dost say are void, they should be hollow named, not
void; for they not only are, but they are full of air and spirit.

12\. *Asc.* Thy argument (*logos*), Thrice-greatest one, is not to be
gainsaid; air is a body. Further, it is this body which doth pervade all
things, and so, pervading, fill them. What are we, then, to call that
space in which the all doth move?

*Her.* The Bodiless, Asclepius.

*Asc.* What, then, is Bodiless?

*Her.* ’Tis Mind and Reason (*Logos*), whole out of whole, all
self-embracing, free from all body, from all error free, unsensible to
body and untouchable, self stayed in self, containing all, preserving
those that are, whose rays, to use a

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

likeness, are Good, Truth, Light beyond light, the Archetype of soul.

*Asc.* What, then, is God?

13\. *Her.* Not any one of these is He; for He it is that causeth them
to *be*, both all and each and every thing of all that are. Nor hath He
left a thing beside that is-not; but they are all from things-that-are
and not from things-that-are-not. For that the things-that-are-not have
naturally no power of being anything, but rather have the nature of the
inability-to-be. And, conversely, the things-that-are have not the
nature of some time not-being.

14\. *Asc.* What say’st thou ever, then, God is?

*Her.* God, therefore, is not Mind, but Cause that the Mind is; God is
not Spirit, but Cause that Spirit is; God is not Light, but Cause that
the Light is. Hence should one honour God with these two names \[the
Good and Father\]—names which pertain to Him alone and no one else.

For no one of the other so-called gods, no one of men, or daimones, can
be in any measure Good, but God alone; and *He* is Good alone and
nothing else. The rest of things are separable all from the Good’s
nature; for \[all the rest\] are soul and body, which have no space that
can contain <span id="fr_127"></span>[1](#fn_127.md) the Good.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

15\. For that as mighty is the Greatness of the Good as is the Being of
all things that are—both bodies and things bodiless, things sensible and
intelligible things. Call not thou, therefore, aught else Good, for thou
would’st impious be; nor anything at all at any time call God but Good
alone, for so thou would’st again be impious.

16\. Though, then, the Good is spoken of by all, it is not understood by
all, what thing it is. Not only, then, is God not understood by all, but
both unto the gods and some of men they out of ignorance do give the
name of Good, though they can never either be or become Good. For they
are very different from God, while Good can never be distinguished from
Him, for that God is the same as Good.

The rest of the immortal ones are natheless honoured with the name of
God, and spoken of as gods; but God is Good not out of courtesy but out
of nature. For that God’s nature and the Good is one; one is the kind of
both, from which all other kinds \[proceed\].

The Good is He who gives all things and naught receives. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md) God, then, doth give all things and
receive naught. God, then, is Good, and Good is God.

17\. The other name of God is Father, again

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

because He is the that-which-maketh all. The part of father is to make.

Wherefore child-making is a very great and a most pious thing in life
for them who think aright, and to leave life on earth without a child a
very great misfortune and impiety; and he who hath no child is punished
by the daimons after death.

And this the punishment: that that man’s soul who hath no child, shall
be condemned unto a body with neither man’s nor woman’s nature, a thing
accurst beneath the sun.

Wherefore, Asclepius, let not your sympathies be with the man who hath
no child, but rather pity his mishap, knowing what punishment abides for
him.

Let all that has been said, then, be to thee, Asclepius, an introduction
to the gnosis of the nature of all things.

body.

<span id="fn_122"></span>[64:1](th205.htm#fr_122.md) For a criticism of
Parthey’s text of the following three paragraphs, see R., pp. 209, 300.
Parthey had uncritically conflated the text of our Corpus and the
readings of Stobæus, in ignorance that he had before him two different
recensions of the same text. I follow Reitzenstein.

<span id="fn_123"></span>[64:2](th205.htm#fr_123.md) *Cf.* *P. S. A.*,
xxxiii. 1.

<span id="fn_124"></span>[64:3](th205.htm#fr_124.md) From here to the end
of § 12 is quoted by Stobæus, *Phys.*, xviii. 3; G. pp. 149-150; W. 158,
13 ff.

<span id="fn_125"></span>[64:4](th205.htm#fr_125.md) The variant in Stobæus
reads: “No single thing of things that are is void by reason of the
\[very nature of\] subsistence. The ‘is’ could not be ‘is’ were it not
*full* of subsistence \[itself\].” The rest of the variants need not be
noted in translation.

<span id="fn_126"></span>[65:1](th205.htm#fr_126.md) The physical
elements—earth, air, water and fire—were supposed to be severally
combinations of the Primal Elements, Earth, Air, Water and Fire, one
Element dominating in each. Thus our air would consist of a proportion
of all four Great Elements, but would have Air predominant in it; and so
for the rest.

<span id="fn_127"></span>[66:1](th205.htm#fr_127.md) In the original there
is a word-play—χωριστά (separable) and χωρῆσαι (contain)—which is
impossible to reproduce in translation.

<span id="fn_128"></span>[67:1](th205.htm#fr_128.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, x.
(xi.) 3: ’Tis “He alone who taketh naught.”
