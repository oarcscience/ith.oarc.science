*Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2*, by G.R.S. Mead, \[1906\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[IX. M.\] And <span id="fr_831"></span>[1](#fn_830.md) since our sermon
treats of the relationship and intercourse <span
id="fr_832"></span>[2](#fn_831.md) of men and Gods,—learn, Asclepius, the
power and strength of man!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[Our\] Lord and Father, or what is Highest God,—as He’s Creator of the
Gods in Heaven, so man’s the maker of the gods who, in the temples,
suffer man’s approach, and who not only have light poured on them, but
who send forth \[their\] light \[on all\]; not only does a man go
forward towards the God\[s\], but also he confirms the Gods \[on
earth\]. <span id="fr_833"></span>[3](#fn_832.md)

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

Art thou surprised, Asclepius; nay is it not that even *thou* dost not
believe?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

2\. *Asc.* I am amazed, Thrice-greatest one; but willingly I give assent
to \[all\] thy words. I judge that man most blest who hath attained so
great felicity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* And rightly so; \[for\] he deserves our wonder, in that he is
the greatest of them all.

As for the genus of the Gods in Heaven,—’tis plain from the
commixture <span id="fr_834"></span>[1](#fn_833.md) of them all, that it
has been made pregnant from the fairest part of nature, <span
id="fr_835"></span>[2](#fn_834.md) and that the only signs \[by which they
are discerned\] are, as it were, before all else their heads. <span
id="fr_836"></span>[3](#fn_835.md)

3\. Whereas the species of the gods which humankind constructs is
fashioned out of either nature,—out of that nature which is more ancient
and far more divine, and out of that which is in men; that is, out of
the stuff of which they have been made and are configured, not only in
their heads alone, but also in each limb and their whole frame.

And <span id="fr_837"></span>[4](#fn_836.md) so mankind, in imaging
Divinity, stays

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

mindful of the nature and the source of its own self.

So that, just as \[our\] Sire and Lord did make the Gods æonian, that
they might be like Him; so hath mankind configured its own gods
according to the likeness of the look of its own self. <span
id="fr_838"></span>[1](#fn_837.md)

#### XXIV

1\. *Asc.* Thou dost not mean their statues, dost thou, O
Thrice-greatest one?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* \[I mean their\] statues, O Asclepius,—dost thou not see how
much *thou* even, doubtest?—statues, ensouled with sense, and filled
with spirit, which work such mighty and such \[strange\]
results,—statues which can foresee what is to come, and which perchance
can prophesy, foretelling things by dreams and many other
ways,—\[statues\] that take their strength away from men, or cure their
sorrow, if they do so deserve.

Dost thou not know, Asclepius, that Egypt is the image of the
Heaven <span id="fr_839"></span>[2](#fn_838.md); or, what is truer still,
the transference, or the descent, of all that are in governance or
exercise in Heaven? And if more truly \[still\] it must be said,—this
land of ours is Shrine of all the World.

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

2\. Further, in that ’tis fitting that the prudent should know all
before, it is not right ye should be ignorant of this.

The time will come when Egypt will appear to have in vain served the
Divinity with pious mind and constant worship <span
id="fr_840"></span>[1](#fn_839.md); and all its holy cult will fall to
nothingness and be in vain.

For that Divinity is now about to hasten back from Earth to Heaven, and
Egypt shall be left; and Earth, which was the seat of pious cults, shall
be bereft and widowed of the presence of the Gods.

And foreigners shall fill this region and this land; and there shall be
not only the neglect of pious cults, but—what is still more painful,—as
though enacted by the laws, a penalty shall be decreed against the
practice of \[our\] pious cults and worship of the Gods—\[entire\]
proscription of them.

3\. Then shall this holiest land, seat of \[our\] shrines and temples,
be choked with tombs and corpses. <span id="fr_841"></span>[2](#fn_840.md)

O Egypt, Egypt, of thy pious cults tales only will remain, as far beyond
belief for thy own sons \[as for the rest of men\]; words only will be
left cut on thy stones, thy pious deeds recounting!

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

And Egypt will be made the home of Scyth <span
id="fr_842"></span>[1](#fn_841.md) or Indian, or some one like to
them,—that is a foreign neighbour. <span id="fr_843"></span>[2](#fn_842.md)

Ay, for the Godly company <span id="fr_844"></span>[3](#fn_843.md) shall
mount again to Heaven, and their forsaken worshippers shall all die out;
and Egypt, thus bereft of God and man, shall be abandoned.

4\. And now I speak to thee, O River, holiest \[Stream\]! I tell thee
what will be. With bloody torrents shalt thou overflow thy banks. Not
only shall thy streams divine be stained with blood; but they shall all
flow over \[with the same\].

The tale of tombs shall far exceed the \[number of the\] quick; and the
surviving remnant shall be Egyptians in their tongue alone, but in their
actions foreigners.

#### XXV

1\. Why dost thou weep, Asclepius? Nay, more than this, by far more
wretched,—Egypt herself shall be impelled and stained with greater ills.

For she, the Holy \[Land\], and once deservedly

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

the most beloved by God, by reason of her pious service of the Gods on
earth,—she, the sole colony <span id="fr_845"></span>[1](#fn_844.md) of
holiness, and teacher of religion \[on the earth\], shall be the type of
all that is most barbarous.

And then, out of our loathing for mankind, the World will seem no more
deserving of our wonder and our praise.

All this good thing, <span id="fr_846"></span>[2](#fn_845.md)—than which
there has been fairer naught that can be seen, nor is there anything,
nor will there \[ever\] be,—will be in jeopardy.

2\. And it will prove a burden unto men; and on account of this they
will despise and cease to love this Cosmos as a whole,—the changeless
work of God; the glorious construction of the Good, comprised of
multifold variety of forms; the engine of God’s Will, supporting His own
work ungrudgingly; the multitudinous whole massed in a unity of all,
that should be reverenced, praised and loved,—by them at least who have
the eyes to see.

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

For Darkness will be set before the Light, and Death will be thought
preferable to Life. No one will raise his eyes to Heaven; the pious man
will be considered mad, the impious a sage; the frenzied held as strong,
the worst as best.

3\. For soul, and all concerning it,—whereby it doth presume that either
it hath been born deathless, or that it will attain to deathlessness,
according to the argument I have set forth for you,—\[all this\] will be
considered not only food for sport, <span
id="fr_847"></span>[1](#fn_846.md) but even vanity.

Nay, \[if ye will\] believe me, the penalty of death shall be decreed to
him who shall devote himself to the Religion of the Mind.

New statutes shall come into force, a novel law; naught \[that is\]
sacred, nothing pious, naught that is worthy of the Heaven, or Gods in
Heaven, shall \[e’er\] be heard, or \[even\] mentally believed.

4\. The sorrowful departure of the Gods from men takes place; bad
angels <span id="fr_848"></span>[2](#fn_847.md) only stay, who mingled with
humanity will lay their hands on them, and drive the wretched folk to
every ill of recklessness,—to wars, and robberies, deceits,

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

and all those things that are opposed to the soul’s nature. <span
id="fr_849"></span>[1](#fn_848.md)

Then shall the Earth no longer hold together; the Sea no longer shall be
sailed upon; nor shall the Heaven continue with the Courses of the
Stars, nor the Star-course in Heaven.

The voice of every God <span id="fr_850"></span>[2](#fn_849.md) shall cease
in the \[Great\] Silence that no one can break; the fruits of Earth
shall rot; nay, Earth no longer shall bring forth; and Air itself shall
faint in that sad listlessness.

#### XXVI

1\. This, when it comes, shall be the World’s old age,
impiety,—irregularity, and lack of rationality in all good things.

And when these things all come to pass, Asclepius,—then He, \[our\] Lord
and Sire, God First in power, and Ruler of the One God
\[Visible\], <span id="fr_851"></span>[3](#fn_850.md) in check of crime,
and calling error back from the corruption of all things unto good
manners and to deeds spontaneous with His Will (that is to say God’s
Goodness),—ending all ill, by either washing it away with water-flood,
or burning it away with fire, or by the means of pestilent diseases,
spread

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

throughout all hostile lands,—God will recall the Cosmos to its ancient
form <span id="fr_852"></span>[1](#fn_851.md); so that the World itself
shall seem meet to be worshipped and admired; and God, the Maker and
Restorer of so vast a work, be sung by the humanity who shall be then,
with ceaseless heraldings of praise and \[hymns of\] blessing.

2\. For this \[Re-\] birth of Cosmos is the making new <span
id="fr_853"></span>[2](#fn_852.md) of all good things, and the most holy
and most pious bringing-back again of Nature’s self, by means of a set
course of time,—of Nature, which was without beginning, and which is
without an end. For that God’s Will hath no beginning; and, in that ’tis
the same and as it is, it is without an end.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Asc.* Because God’s Nature’s the Determination <span
id="fr_854"></span>[3](#fn_853.md) of the Will. Determination is the
Highest Good; is it not so, Thrice-greatest one?

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

3\. *Tris.* Asclepius, Will is Determination’s child; nay, willing in
itself comes from the Will.

Not that He willeth aught desiring it; for that He is the Fullness of
all things, and wills what things He has.

He thus wills all good things, and has all that He wills. Nay, rather,
He doth think and will *all* good.

This, then, is God; the World of Good’s His Image.

#### XXVII

1\. *Asc.* \[Is Cosmos\] good, Thrice-greatest one?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* \[’Tis\] good, <span id="fr_855"></span>[1](#fn_854.md) as I will
teach thee, O Asclepius.

For just as God is the Apportioner and Steward of good things to all the
species, or \[more correctly\] genera, which are in Cosmos,—that is to
say, of Sense, <span id="fr_856"></span>[2](#fn_855.md) and Soul, and
Life,—so Cosmos is the giver and bestower of all things which seem unto
\[us\] mortals good;—that is to say, the alternation of its parts, of
seasonable fruits, birth, growth, maturity, and things like these.

And for this cause God doth transcend the height of highest Heaven,
extending everywhere, and doth behold all things on every side.

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

2\. Beyond the Heaven starless Space doth stretch, stranger to every
thing possessed of body.

The Dispensator who’s between the Heaven and Earth, is Ruler of the
Space which we call Zeus \[Above\].

The Earth and Sea is ruled by Zeus Below <span
id="fr_857"></span>[1](#fn_856.md); he is the Nourisher of mortal lives,
and of fruit-bearing \[trees\].

It is by reason of the powers of all of these <span
id="fr_858"></span>[2](#fn_857.md) that fruits, and trees, and earth, grow
green.

The powers and energies of \[all\] the other \[Gods\] will be
distributed through all the things that are.

3\. Yea, they who rule the earth shall be distributed \[through all the
lands\], and \[finally\] be gathered in a state, <span
id="fr_859"></span>[3](#fn_858.md)—at top of Egypt’s upper part, <span
id="fr_860"></span>[4](#fn_859.md)—which shall be founded towards the
setting sun, and to which all the mortal race shall speed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Asc.* But now, just at this moment, where are they, Thrice-greatest
one?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* They’re gathered in a very large

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

community, <span id="fr_861"></span>[1](#fn_860.md) upon the Libyan
Hill. <span id="fr_862"></span>[2](#fn_861.md) And now enough concerning
this hath been declared.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_830"></span>[349:1](th245.htm#fr_831.md) This sentence and the
first half of the next, down to “suffer man’s approach,” is quoted word
for word in Latin by Augustine, *De Civitate Dei*, xxiii.

<span id="fn_831"></span>[349:2](th245.htm#fr_832.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, x.
(xi.) 22.

<span id="fn_832"></span>[349:3](th245.htm#fr_833.md) The Latin translation
of this paragraph seems confused.

<span id="fn_833"></span>[350:1](th245.htm#fr_834.md) This is, apparently,
the “star stuff” of which their bodies are made.

<span id="fn_834"></span>[350:2](th245.htm#fr_835.md) *De mundissima parte
naturæ esse prægnatum*—whatever that means; but *cf.* p. 348, n. 1.

<span id="fn_835"></span>[350:3](th245.htm#fr_836.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, x.
(xi.) 10, 11.

<span id="fn_836"></span>[350:4](th245.htm#fr_837.md) This sentence,
together with the first five sentences of the next chapter, down to the
words “and constant worship,” are quoted in Latin with two or three
slight verbal variants by Augustine, *De Civitate Dei*, xxiii.

<span id="fn_837"></span>[351:1](th245.htm#fr_838.md) *Cf.* xxxvii. 2
below.

<span id="fn_838"></span>[351:2](th245.htm#fr_839.md) *Cf.* Comment, on *K.
K.*, 46-48.

<span id="fn_839"></span>[352:1](th245.htm#fr_840.md) Augustine’s quotation
ends here.

<span id="fn_840"></span>[352:2](th245.htm#fr_841.md) *Sepulchrorum erit
mortuorumque plenissima.* This sentence is quoted verbatim by Augustine,
De Civitate Dei, xxvi.

<span id="fn_841"></span>[353:1](th245.htm#fr_842.md) Compare Colossians
iii. 11: “Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
uncircumcision, *Barbarian, Scythian*, bond nor free: but Christ is all,
and in all.”

<span id="fn_842"></span>[353:2](th245.htm#fr_843.md) *Vicina barbaria*;
lit. a neighbouring foreign country. Compare this with the previous
note. It is strange the two, Scyth and barbarian, coming twice together.

<span id="fn_843"></span>[353:3](th245.htm#fr_844.md) *Divinitas.*

<span id="fn_844"></span>[354:1](th245.htm#fr_845.md) *Deductio* the
technical term for leading out a colony from the *metropolis* or mother
city. Compare Philo, *De Vita Contemplativa*, P. 892, M. 474 (Conybeare,
p. 58): “In Egypt there are crowds of them \[the Therapeuts\] in every
province, or nome as they call it, and especially at Alexandria. For
they who are in every way the most highly advanced, lead out a colony
(ἀποικίαν στέλλονται), as it were to the Therapeutic father-land”; and
also the numerous parallel passages cited by Conybeare from Philo’s
other writings.

<span id="fn_845"></span>[354:2](th245.htm#fr_846.md) *Sc.* the Cosmos.

<span id="fn_846"></span>[355:1](th245.htm#fr_847.md) *Cf.* xii. 2 above.

<span id="fn_847"></span>[355:2](th245.htm#fr_848.md) *Nocentes
angeli*,—usually daimones in our tractates; still, as Lactantius (*D.
I.*, ii. 15) says that Hermes calls the daimones “evil angels” (ἀγγέλους
πονηροὺς), he most probably took it from the Greek original of our
sermon.

<span id="fn_848"></span>[356:1](th245.htm#fr_849.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, x.
(xi.) 21.

<span id="fn_849"></span>[356:2](th245.htm#fr_850.md) *Omnis vox divina*;
or, perhaps, the “whole Word of God.”

<span id="fn_850"></span>[356:3](th245.htm#fr_851.md) That is, Cosmos.

<span id="fn_851"></span>[357:1](th245.htm#fr_852.md) The above passage is
cited in the original Greek by Lactantius (*D. I.*, vii. 8) as from the
“Perfect Sermon” of Hermes. As we might expect from what had been
already said on this subject, it differs from our Latin translation, and
runs as follows:  
  
“Now when these things shall be as I have said, Asclepius, then will
\[our\] Lord and Sire, the God and Maker of the First and the One God,
look down on what is done, and making firm His Will, that is the Good,
against disorder,—recalling error, and cleaning out the bad, either by
washing it away with water-flood, or burning it away with swiftest fire,
or forcibly expelling it with war and famine,—will bring again His
Cosmos to its former state, and so achieve its Restoration.”

<span id="fn_852"></span>[357:2](th245.htm#fr_853.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, iii.
(iv.) 1.

<span id="fn_853"></span>[357:3](th245.htm#fr_854.md) *Consilium* = βουλή.

<span id="fn_854"></span>[358:1](th245.htm#fr_855.md) This seems a *formal*
contradiction of *C. H.*, x. (xi.) 10, but is not really so.

<span id="fn_855"></span>[358:2](th245.htm#fr_856.md) Meaning higher sense,
presumably; reading *sensus* for *sensibus.*

<span id="fn_856"></span>[359:1](th245.htm#fr_857.md) *Jupiter Plutonius.*
Ménard suggests “*Zeus souterrain* (*Sarapis?*)”; the original was
probably Zeus Aidoneus.

<span id="fn_857"></span>[359:2](th245.htm#fr_858.md) It is not clear who
“these” are; perhaps all that have so far been mentioned, but this does
not seem satisfactory. Doubtless the Latin translation is, as usual, at
fault.

<span id="fn_858"></span>[359:3](th245.htm#fr_859.md) Or city.

<span id="fn_859"></span>[359:4](th245.htm#fr_860.md) *In summo Ægypti
initio.*

<span id="fn_860"></span>[360:1](th245.htm#fr_861.md) *Civitate.*

<span id="fn_861"></span>[360:2](th245.htm#fr_862.md) *In monte Libyco*;
lit. on a (or the) Libycan, or Libyan or African Hill or Mount. Compare
with this xxxvii. below.
