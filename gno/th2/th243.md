2\. \[VII. M.\] And now let us begin to treat of Spirit and such things.

There was first God and Matter, <span id="fr_763"></span>[3](#fn_762.md)
which we in Greek <span id="fr_764"></span>[4](#fn_763.md) believe \[to
be\] the Cosmos; and Spirit was *with* Cosmos, or Spirit was *in*
Cosmos, but not in like way as in God <span
id="fr_765"></span>[5](#fn_764.md); nor were there

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

things \[as yet\] from which the Cosmos \[comes to birth\] in God.

They *were* not; just for the very reason that they were not, but were
as yet in that \[condition\] whence they *have had* their birth. <span
id="fr_766"></span>[1](#fn_765.md)

For those things only are not called ingenerable which have not yet been
born, but \[also\] those which lack the fertilizing power of generating,
so that from them naught can be born.

And so whatever things there are that have in them the power of
generating,—these two are generable, \[that is to say,\] from which
birth can take place, though they be born from their own selves
\[alone\]. For there’s no question that from those born from themselves
birth can with ease take place, since from *them* all are born.

3\. God, then, the everlasting, God the eternal, nor can be born, nor
could He have been born. That <span id="fr_767"></span>[2](#fn_766.md) is,
That was, That shall be ever. This, therefore, is God’s Nature—all from
itself \[alone\].

But Matter <span id="fr_768"></span>[3](#fn_767.md) (or the Nature of the
Cosmos) <span id="fr_769"></span>[4](#fn_768.md) and Spirit, although they
do not seem to be things born from any source, <span
id="fr_770"></span>[5](#fn_769.md) yet in themselves

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

possess the power of generation and of generating,—the nature of
fecundity.

For the beginning <span id="fr_771"></span>[1](#fn_770.md) \[truly\] is in
\[just that\] quality of nature which possesses in itself the power and
matter both of conception and of birth. <span
id="fr_772"></span>[2](#fn_771.md) This, <span
id="fr_773"></span>[3](#fn_772.md) then, without conception of another, is
generable of its own self.

#### XV

1\. But, on the other hand, \[whereas\] those things which only have the
power of bringing forth by blending with another nature, are thus to be
distinguished, this Space of Cosmos, <span
id="fr_774"></span>[4](#fn_773.md) with those that are in it, seems not to
have been born, in that \[the Cosmos\] has in it undoubtedly all
Nature’s potency. <span id="fr_775"></span>[5](#fn_774.md)

By “Space” I mean that in which are all things. For all these things
could not have been had Space not been, to hold them all. Since for all
things that there have been, must be provided Space.

For neither could the qualities nor quantities, nor the positions, nor
\[yet\] the operations, be distinguished of those things which are no
*where.*

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

2\. So then the Cosmos, also, though not born, still has in it the
births <span id="fr_776"></span>[1](#fn_775.md) of all; in that, indeed, it
doth afford for all of them most fecund wombs for their conception.

It, therefore, is the sum of \[all that\] quality of Matter which hath
creative potency, although it hath not been \[itself\] created.

And, seeing that \[this\] quality of Matter is in its nature \[simple\]
productiveness; so the same \[source\] produces bad as well \[as good\].

#### XVI

1\. I have not, therefore, O Asclepius and Ammon, said what many say,
that God *could* not excise and banish evil from the Scheme <span
id="fr_777"></span>[2](#fn_776.md) of Things;—to whom no answer need at all
be given. Yet for your sakes I will continue what I have begun, and give
a reason.

They say that God ought to have freed the World from bad in every way;
for so much is it <span id="fr_778"></span>[3](#fn_777.md) in the World,
that it doth seem to be as though it were one of its limbs.

This was foreseen by Highest God and \[due\] provision made, as much as
ever could have been in reason made, then when He thought it proper to
endow the minds of men with sense, <span id="fr_779"></span>[4](#fn_778.md)
and science and intelligence.

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

2\. For it is by these things alone whereby we stand above the rest of
animals, that we are able to avoid the snares and crimes of ill.

For he who shall on sight have turned from them, before he hath become
immeshed in them,—he is a man protected by divine intelligence and
\[godly\] prudence.

For that the ground-work of \[true\] science doth consist of the
top-stones of virtue.

3\. It is by Spirit that all things are governed in the Cosmos, and made
quick,—Spirit made subject to the Will of Highest God, as though it were
an engine or machine.

So far, then, \[only\] let Him be by us conceived,—as Him who is
conceivable by mind alone, who is called Highest God, the Ruler and
Director of God Sensible, <span id="fr_780"></span>[1](#fn_779.md)—of Him
who in Himself includes all Space, all Substance, and all Matter, of
things producing and begetting, and all whatever is, however great it
be.

#### XVII

1\. It is by Spirit that all species in the Cosmos are \[or\] moved or
ruled,—each one according to its proper nature given it by God.

Matter, <span id="fr_781"></span>[2](#fn_780.md) or Cosmos, on the other
hand, is that which holds all things,—the field of motion, <span
id="fr_782"></span>[3](#fn_781.md) and

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

the that which crowds together <span id="fr_783"></span>[1](#fn_782.md)
all; of which God is the Ruler, distributing unto all cosmic things all
that is requisite to each.

It is with Spirit that He fills all things, according to the quality of
each one’s nature.

2\. \[Now,\] seeing that the hollow roundness <span
id="fr_784"></span>[2](#fn_783.md) of the Cosmos is borne round into the
fashion of a sphere; by reason of its \[very\] quality or form, it never
can be altogether visible unto itself.

So that, however high a place in it thou shouldest choose for looking
down below, thou could’st not see from it what is at bottom, because in
many places it confronts \[the senses\], and so is thought to have the
quality \[of being visible throughout\]. <span
id="fr_785"></span>[3](#fn_784.md)

For it is solely owing to the forms of species, with images of which it
seems insculpted, that it is thought \[to be\] as though ’twere visible
\[throughout\]; but as a fact ’tis ever to itself invisible.

3\. Wherefore, its bottom, or its \[lowest\] part, if \[such a\] place
there be within a sphere, is called in Greek *a-eidēs* <span
id="fr_786"></span>[4](#fn_785.md); since that *eidein* <span
id="fr_787"></span>[5](#fn_786.md) in

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Greek means
“seeing,”—which “being-seen” the sphere’s beginning <span
id="fr_788"></span>[1](#fn_787.md) lacks.

Hence, too, the species have the name *eideai*, <span
id="fr_789"></span>[2](#fn_788.md) since they’re of form we cannot see.

Therefore, in that they are deprived of “being-seen,” in Greek they are
called *Hades*; in that they are at bottom <span
id="fr_790"></span>[3](#fn_789.md) of the sphere, they’re called in Latin
*Inferi.*

These, then, are principal and prior, <span
id="fr_791"></span>[4](#fn_790.md) and, as it were, the sources and the
heads of all the things which are in them, <span
id="fr_792"></span>[5](#fn_791.md) through them, or from them.

#### XVIII

1\. *Asc.* All things, then, in themselves (as thou, Thrice-greatest
one, dost say) are cosmic \[principles\] (as I should say) of all the
species which are in them, \[or\] as it were, the sum and substance of
each one of them. <span id="fr_793"></span>[6](#fn_792.md)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* So Cosmos, then, doth nourish bodies; the Spirit, souls; the
\[Higher\] Sense (with which Celestial Gift mankind alone is
blest) <span id="fr_794"></span>[7](#fn_793.md) doth feed the mind.

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

And \[these are\] not all men, but \[they are\] few, whose minds are of
such quality that they can be receptive of so great a blessing.

2\. For as the World’s illumined by the Sun, so is the mind of man
illumined by that Light; nay, in \[still\] fuller measure.

For whatsoever thing the Sun doth shine upon, it is anon, by
interjection of the Earth or Moon, or by the intervention of the night,
robbed of its light.

But once the \[Higher\] Sense hath been commingled with the soul of man,
there is at-onement from the happy union of the blending of their
natures; so that minds of this kind are never more held fast in errors
of the darkness.

Wherefore, with reason have they said the \[Higher\] Senses are the
souls of Gods; to which I add: not of *all* Gods, but of the great ones
\[only\]; nay, even of the principles of these.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_762"></span>[332:3](th243.htm#fr_763.md) The Greek ὕλη is here
retained by the translator.

<span id="fn_763"></span>[332:4](th243.htm#fr_764.md) *Græce.*

<span id="fn_764"></span>[332:5](th243.htm#fr_765.md) The Latin translation
is confused. The original seems to have stated that Spirit and Cosmos
(or Matter) were as yet *one*, or Spirit-Matter.

<span id="fn_765"></span>[333:1](th243.htm#fr_766.md) That is, presumably,
they were in potentiality.

<span id="fn_766"></span>[333:2](th243.htm#fr_767.md) *Hoc.*

<span id="fn_767"></span>[333:3](th243.htm#fr_768.md) Again ὕλη in the
Latin text.

<span id="fn_768"></span>[333:4](th243.htm#fr_769.md) *Cf.* “Matter or
Cosmos” of xvii. 2.

<span id="fn_769"></span>[333:5](th243.htm#fr_770.md) *Principio*,
“beginning” the same word as that used in the Vulgate translation of the
Proem of the fourth Gospel.

<span id="fn_770"></span>[334:1](th243.htm#fr_771.md) *Initium.*

<span id="fn_771"></span>[334:2](th243.htm#fr_772.md) This seems to make it
clear that the idea “Cosmos” is regarded under the dual concept of
Spirit-Matter.

<span id="fn_772"></span>[334:3](th243.htm#fr_773.md) *Sc.* Primal Nature,
or Spirit-Matter.

<span id="fn_773"></span>[334:4](th243.htm#fr_774.md) *Cf.* xxx. 1, and
xxxiv. 1 below.

<span id="fn_774"></span>[334:5](th243.htm#fr_775.md) The Latin
construction is very faulty.

<span id="fn_775"></span>[335:1](th243.htm#fr_776.md) *Naturas.*

<span id="fn_776"></span>[335:2](th243.htm#fr_777.md) Lit. nature.

<span id="fn_777"></span>[335:3](th243.htm#fr_778.md) *Sc.* evil or bad.

<span id="fn_778"></span>[335:4](th243.htm#fr_779.md) Presumably meaning
the higher sense.

<span id="fn_779"></span>[336:1](th243.htm#fr_780.md) That is, Cosmos.

<span id="fn_780"></span>[336:2](th243.htm#fr_781.md) Again ὕλη.

<span id="fn_781"></span>[336:3](th243.htm#fr_782.md) *Agitatio.*

<span id="fn_782"></span>[337:1](th243.htm#fr_783.md) *Frequentatio.*

<span id="fn_783"></span>[337:2](th243.htm#fr_784.md) *Cava
rotunditas*—that is, presumably, concavity.

<span id="fn_784"></span>[337:3](th243.htm#fr_785.md) *Propter quod multis
locis instat, qualitatemque habere creditur.* The Latin translation is
evidently faulty. Ménard omits the sentence entirely, as he so often
does when there is difficulty.

<span id="fn_785"></span>[337:4](th243.htm#fr_786.md) Ἀ-ειδής—that is,
“Invisible”; that is, Hades (Ἀιδὴς or Ἅδης).

<span id="fn_786"></span>[337:5](th243.htm#fr_787.md) εἰδεῖν—? ἰδεῖν.

<span id="fn_787"></span>[338:1](th243.htm#fr_788.md) *Primum spheræ*; the
top or bottom presumably, or periphery, of the world-sphere.

<span id="fn_788"></span>[338:2](th243.htm#fr_789.md) εἰδέαι—? ἰδέαι—that
is, forms, species,—but also used of the highest species, viewed as
“ideas.”

<span id="fn_789"></span>[338:3](th243.htm#fr_790.md) *Sc.* at the centre.

<span id="fn_790"></span>[338:4](th243.htm#fr_791.md) Or principles and
priorities (*antiquiora*).

<span id="fn_791"></span>[338:5](th243.htm#fr_792.md) *Sc.* the “ideas.”

<span id="fn_792"></span>[338:6](th243.htm#fr_793.md) The Latin text is
hopeless.

<span id="fn_793"></span>[338:7](th243.htm#fr_794.md) *Cf.* vii. i.
