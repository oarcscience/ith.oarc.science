#### IX

1\. \[V. M.\] But, O Asclepius, I see that thou with swift desire of
mind art in a hurry to be told how man can have a love and worship of
the Heaven, or of the things that are therein. Hear, then, Asclepius!

The love of God and Heaven, together with all them that are therein, is
one perpetual act of worship. <span id="fr_727"></span>[1](#fn_726.md)

No other thing ensouled, of Gods or animals, can do this thing, save man
alone. <span id="fr_728"></span>[2](#fn_727.md) ’Tis in the admiration,
adoration, \[and\] the praise of men, and \[in their\] acts of worship,
that Heaven and Heaven’s hosts find their delight.

2\. Nor is it without cause the Muses’ choir hath been sent down by
Highest Deity unto the host of men; in order that, forsooth, the terrene
world should not seem too uncultured, had it lacked the charm of
measures, but rather that with songs and praise of men accompanied with

<span id="page_324">p. 324</span>

music, <span id="fr_729"></span>[1](#fn_728.md) He might be lauded,—He who
alone is all, or is the Sire of all; and so not even on the
earths, <span id="fr_730"></span>[2](#fn_729.md) should there have been an
absence of the sweetness of the harmony of heavenly praise.

3\. Some, then, though they be very few, endowed with the Pure
Mind, <span id="fr_731"></span>[3](#fn_730.md) have been entrusted with the
sacred charge of contemplating Heaven.

Whereas those men who, from the two-fold blending of their nature, have
not as yet withdrawn their inner reason from their body’s mass, <span
id="fr_732"></span>[4](#fn_731.md) these are appointed for the study of the
elements, and \[all\] that is below them.

4\. Thus man’s an animal; yet not indeed less potent in that he’s partly
mortal, but rather doth he seem to be all the more fit and efficacious
for reaching Certain Reason, since he has had mortality bestowed on him
as well.

For it is plain he could not have sustained the strain of both, unless
he had been formed out of both natures, <span
id="fr_733"></span>[5](#fn_732.md) so that he could possess the powers of
cultivating Earthly things and loving Heaven.

<span id="page_325">p. 325</span>

#### X

1\. The Reason of a thesis such as this, O \[my\] Asclepius, I would
that thou should’st grasp, not only with the keen attention of thy soul,
but also with its living power <span id="fr_734"></span>[1](#fn_733.md)
\[as well\].

For ’tis a Reason that most men cannot believe; the Perfect and the True
are to be grasped by the more holy minds. <span
id="fr_735"></span>[2](#fn_734.md) Hence, then, will I begin.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_726"></span>[323:1](th241.htm#fr_727.md) *Una est obsequiorum
frequentatio.* *Cf.* Ex. i. 3.

<span id="fn_727"></span>[323:2](th241.htm#fr_728.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, xvi.
11: “The duty of mankind is to give worship.”

<span id="fn_728"></span>[324:1](th241.htm#fr_729.md) *Musicatis*; or
perhaps “Muse-inspired”; a word which, like so many others, occurs only
in the Latin of this treatise.

<span id="fn_729"></span>[324:2](th241.htm#fr_730.md) *In terris*, pl.

<span id="fn_730"></span>[324:3](th241.htm#fr_731.md) *Cf.* vii. 1 and 2
above.

<span id="fn_731"></span>[324:4](th241.htm#fr_732.md) The reading is
“*interiorem intelligentiam mole corporis resederunt*,” of which I can
make nothing; *resederunt* is evidently an error.

<span id="fn_732"></span>[324:5](th241.htm#fr_733.md) There is here a
“double” in the text, which the editor has not removed.

<span id="fn_733"></span>[325:1](th241.htm#fr_734.md) *Vivacitate.* *Cf.*
*C. H.*, x. (xi.) 17; and xix. 1 below.

<span id="fn_734"></span>[325:2](th241.htm#fr_735.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, ix.
(x.) 10.
