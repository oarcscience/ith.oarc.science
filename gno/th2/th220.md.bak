#### COMMENTARY

##### TITLE AND ORDERING

This treatise bears a double title:—“On Thought and Sense,” and “That
the Beautiful and Good is in God only.” The former heading is clearly
taken from the concluding words: “Let so much then suffice on
thought-and-sense”; whereas the introductory sentence speaks of the
Sermon on Sense only. The latter heading seems to be a thoughtless
repetition of the title of *C. H.,* vi. (vii.).

The opening words: “I gave the Perfect Sermon yesterday, Asclepius,”
inform us not only that we have to do with an Asclepius Dialogue, but
also that our sermon followed directly on the “Perfect Sermon,” a Latin
version of which has fortunately been preserved to us. <span
id="fr_235"></span>[1](#fn_235.md)

It is, therefore, of very great interest to find that Lactantius, <span
id="fr_236"></span>[2](#fn_236.md) in quoting a sentence from our treatise
(§ 4)—“Devotion is God-gnosis”—continues with the words: “Asclepius, his
hearer, has also explained the same idea at greater length in the
Perfect Sermon.”

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Lactantius had, therefore, a collection before him in which these two
sermons stood in close connection.

Reitzenstein (p. 195) thinks that our sermon must be an extract from a
longer one, because he cannot bring himself to believe that so short a
treatise could have been found in immediate connection (as the opening
words suggest) with so lengthy and detailed a tractate as the “Perfect
Sermon.” This may be so; and yet the formal beginning and ending of our
sermon would seem to suggest that we are dealing with a complete
tractate and not with an extract.

##### “SENSE-AND-THOUGHT”

The doctrine that in men “sense-and-thought” together constitutes human
“sense” throws some light on the meaning of the term “sense” as used
elsewhere in the Trismegistic literature, where we should expect to find
“mind” employed, and that, too, in the sense of the higher mind.

Normal human “thought,” then, is, so to say, sensible, entirely bound up
in sense-impressions; it is the mind alone that can soar beyond the
senses, for it alone can be “illumined by God’s Light” (§ 3).

The mind is, as it were, a womb or woman, that can be impregnated either
by the “Seeds of God” or by the “Daimonial Energy”; she thus conceives
and brings forth virtues or vices.

All of this is precisely the same doctrine as Philo preaches, as may be
seen by the passages we have quoted in the “Prolegomena” on the subject
of the “Sacred Marriage.”

##### THOSE IN GNOSIS

The Seeds of God are Virtue and Self-control and Devotion or Piety; and
Devotion in its true sense

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

is God-gnosis, or Knowledge of God. The Gnostics, then, “they who are in
Gnosis”—a curious expression—because of their natural divorcement from
the “world,” “please not the many, nor the many them.”

“They are thought mad and laughed at; they’re hated and despised, and
sometimes even put to death.”

Mark the impersonal note, the calm laying down of the causes of
misunderstanding between the “many” and the “few’’; and compare this
with the more personal note of the saying underlying the following
Synoptic accommodations:

“Blessed are ye when men hate you and excommunicate you, and revile and
expel your Name as evil, for the Son of Man’s sake” (Luke vi. 22).

“Blessed are ye when men revile you and persecute you and say all evil
against you, lying, for My sake” (Matt. v. 11).

It is clear, at least it seems so to me, that “Luke” has kept closer to
the original, and that that original was addressed not only to the
members of a community, but to those who had been cast forth from some
other community “for the sake of the Son of Man”—that is, because of the
immediate inspiration of the Logos, which doubtless did not pay
sufficient attention to the prejudices of the “many” of that community.

“Matthew,” on the contrary, seems to have adapted the Saying for general
purposes and the necessities of the Cult of Jesus. <span
id="fr_237"></span>[1](#fn_237.md)

##### THE TRUE GNOSTIC

Excellent also is the doctrine that the true “Gnostic,” the man who is
consciously growing into the stature of

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

the Christ, the true “Devotee of God,” “will bear with all,” for he is
beginning to know the Reason of things.

“For such an one all things, e’en though they be for others bad, are for
him good; deliberately he doth refer them all unto the Gnosis.”

He sees the Good, he sees God, in all things. He is the true Alchemist.
For “thing most marvellous, ’tis he alone who maketh bad things good”;
by spiritual alchemy he transmutes the evil of the world to good; he
drains the “cup of bitterness” unto the dregs, and transmutes it into
the pure Water of Life.

In every Man, then, there are two “men,” the material (or hylic) and the
substantial (or spiritual, οὐσιώδης).

Evil, however, is not a permanent thing; it is but the process of
“becoming good,” the productive side of things (§ 5).

##### THE GOAL OF THE GNOSIS

It is difficult to bring out the delicacy of the wording of the original
in translation. First God’s ultimate intention is stated to be the
making of all things like unto (ὅμοια) Himself; the world-process is to
be ultimately consummated in the Great Sameness of Union with Him. But
meantime while this making, creating or becoming, or transformation, is
going on, the imperfections cannot produce, that is, become creators in
their turn; they are unproductive (ἄφορα). That which is the instrument
or organ of God’s making is the Cosmic Course (φορά). We are finally (§
7) told that the differences of bodies are conditioned by the speed of
this Cosmic Course; therefore the opposite poles, Other and Same, are
both ultimately referable to Cosmos, the Likeness of God.

The end to be achieved is to develop the “sense-and-thought” of the
Cosmos, the One Sense, not manifold,

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

but simple. This is the deliberate working with the Will of God, the
Cosmic Will, the perpetual renewing of all things (ἀνανέωσις).

The Cosmos, then, as the Logos of God, is the Good Gardener of Life; it
is both the place of Life and its Creator—that is to say, both female
and male, both Mother and Father.

##### THE POSSIBILITY OF KNOWING GOD

But the Cosmos is not apart from God, nor even *in* God; God does not
*have* Cosmos as a possession, but *is* Cosmos and all therein (§ 9).
Cosmos is Son of God, His Very Self (§ 8).

Therefore we can learn to know somewhat of the nature of God by sense
and thought, for, “God is not, as some suppose, beyond the reach of
sense and thought” (ἀναισθητὸς καὶ ἀνόητος); that is, God does not
entirely transcend sense and thought, for God is all things.

“As some suppose” doubtless refers again to the “blasphemers” of §
4—that is, the apparently dualistic doctrine set forth in *C. H.*, vi.
(vii.). <span id="fr_238"></span>[1](#fn_238.md)

And so, finally, we learn that Faith, in the true sense, is a certitude
of the mind, or of true manhood. “To understand is to believe” (§ 10).
Gnosis and not belief is the Fair Faith.

Compare with this the “Perfect Sermon,” x. 1:

“The reason for a thesis such as this, O my Asclepius, I would that thou
should’st grasp, not only with the keen attention of thy soul, but also
with its living power as well.

“For ’tis a reason that most men cannot believe; the Perfect and the
True are to be grasped by the more holy minds.”

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_235"></span>[136:1](th220.htm#fr_235.md) For it would, of
course, be absurd to suppose that the “Perfect Sermon” could in any way
be thought to indicate *C. H.*, vi. (vii.), the last Asclepius Dialogue
in our Corpus; especially when our sermon (§ 4) directly combats the
teaching of *C. H.*, vi.

<span id="fn_236"></span>[136:2](th220.htm#fr_236.md) *Div. Institt.*, ii.
15 (Ed. Fritz., i. 106); *cf.* also v. 14.

<span id="fn_237"></span>[138:1](th220.htm#fr_237) R. (p. 213, 1.md) brings
this passage of our sermon into connection with some assumed persecution
of the Pœmandres communities in the course of the fourth century; but I
cannot myself see the slightest ground for such an assumption.

<span id="fn_238"></span>[140:1](th220.htm#fr_238.md) Reitzenstein (p. 171,
2) compares this doctrine of the insensibility and incognizability of
God with the Sabæan Gnosis.
