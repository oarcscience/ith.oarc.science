### \[THE ENCOMIUM OF KINGS\]

##### (ABOUT THE SOUL’S BEING HINDERED BY THE PASSION OF THE BODY)

<span class="small">(Text: R. 355-360; Pat. at end.)</span>

1\. \[<span class="smallcaps">Now</span>\] in the case of those
professing the harmonious art of muse-like melody—if, when the piece is
played, the discord of the instruments doth hinder their intent, its
rendering becomes ridiculous.

For when his instruments are quite too weak for what’s required of them,
the music-artist needs must be laughed at by the audience.

For He, with all good will, gives of His art unweariedly; they blame the
\[artist’s\] weakness.

He then who is the Natural Musician-God, not only in His making of the
harmony of His \[celestial\] songs, but also in His sending forth the
rhythm of the melody of His own song\[s\]

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

right down unto the separate instruments, <span
id="fr_630"></span>[1](#fn_629.md) is, as God, never wearied.

For that with God there is no growing weary.

2\. So, then, if ever a musician desires to enter into the highest
contest of his art he can—when now the trumpeters have rendered the same
phrase of the \[composer’s\] skill, and afterwards the flautists played
the sweet notes of the melody upon their instruments, <span
id="fr_631"></span>[2](#fn_630.md) and they complete the music of the piece
with pipe and plectrum—\[if any thing goes wrong,\] one <span
id="fr_632"></span>[3](#fn_631.md) does not lay the blame upon the
inspiration <span id="fr_633"></span>[4](#fn_632.md) of the music-maker.

Nay, \[by no means,\]—to him one renders the respect that is his due;
one blames the falseness of the instrument, in that it has become a
hindrance to those who are most excellent—embarrassing the maker of the
music in \[the execution of\] his melody, and robbing those who listen
of the sweetness of the song.

3\. In like way also, in our case, let no one of

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

our audience for the weakness that inheres in body, blame impiously our
Race. <span id="fr_634"></span>[1](#fn_633.md)

Nay, let him know God is Unwearied Spirit <span
id="fr_635"></span>[2](#fn_634.md)—for ever in the self-same way possessed
of His own science, unceasing in His joyous gifts, the self-same
benefits bestowing everywhere.

4\. And if the Pheidias—the Demiurge—is not responded to, by lack of
matter to perfect His skilfulness, although for His own part the Artist
has done all he can, let us not lay the blame on Him.

But let us, \[rather,\] blame the weakness of the string, <span
id="fr_636"></span>[3](#fn_635.md) in that, because it is too slack or is
too tight, it mars the rhythm of the harmony.

5\. So when it is that the mischance occurs by reason of the instrument,
no one doth blame the Artist.

Nay, \[more;\] the worse the instrument doth chance to be, the more the
Artist gains in reputation by the frequency with which his hand doth
strike the proper note, <span id="fr_637"></span>[4](#fn_636.md) and more
the love the listeners pour upon that Music-

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

maker, without <span id="fr_638"></span>[1](#fn_637.md) the slightest
thought of blaming him.

So will we too, most noble \[Sirs\], set our own lyre in tune again,
within, with the Musician!

6\. Nay, I have seen one of the artist-folk <span
id="fr_639"></span>[2](#fn_638.md)—although he had no power of playing on
the lyre—when once he had been trained for the right noble theme, make
frequent use of his own self as instrument, and tune the service of his
string by means of mysteries, so that the listeners were amazed at how
he turned necessitude into magnificence. <span
id="fr_640"></span>[3](#fn_639.md)

Of course you know the story of the harper who won the favour of the God
who is the president of music-work.

\[One day,\] when he was playing for a prize, and when the breaking of a
string became a hindrance to him in the contest, the favour of the
Better One supplied him with another string, and placed within his grasp
the boon of fame.

A grasshopper was made to settle on his lyre, through the foreknowledge
of the Better One,

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

and \[so\] fill in the melody in substitution of the \[broken\]
string. <span id="fr_641"></span>[1](#fn_640.md)

And so by mending of his string the harper’s grief was stayed, and fame
of victory was won.

7\. And this I feel is my own case, most noble \[Sirs\]!

For but just now I seemed to make confession of my want of strength, and
play the weakling for a little while; but now, by virtue of the strength
of \[that\] Superior One, as though my song about the King had been
perfected \[by Him, I seem\] to wake my muse.

For, you must know, the end of \[this\] our duty will be the glorious
fame of Kings, and the good-will of our discourse (*logos*) \[will
occupy itself\] about the triumphs which they win.

Come then, let us make haste! For that the singer willeth it, and hath
attuned his lyre <span id="fr_642"></span>[2](#fn_641.md) for this; nay
more, more sweetly will he play, more fitly will he sing, as he has for
his song the greater subjects of his theme.

8\. Since, then, he <span id="fr_643"></span>[3](#fn_642.md) has the
\[stringing\] of his lyre tuned specially to Kings, and has the key

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

of laudatory songs, and as his goal the Royal praises, let him first
raise himself unto the highest King—the God of wholes.

Beginning, \[then,\] his song from the above, he, \[thus,\] in second
place, descends to those after His likeness who hold the sceptre’s
power <span id="fr_644"></span>[1](#fn_643.md); since Kings themselves,
indeed, prefer the \[topics\] of the song should step by step descend
from the above, and where they have their \[gifts of\] victory presided
o’er for them, thence should their hopes be led in orderly succession.

9\. Let, then, the singer start with God, the greatest King of wholes,
who is for ever free from death, both everlasting and possessed of
\[all\] the might of everlastingness, the Glorious Victor, the very
first, from whom all victories descend to those who in succession do
succeed to victory. <span id="fr_645"></span>[2](#fn_644.md)

10\. Our sermon (*logos*) then, doth hasten to descend to \[Kingly\]
praises and to the Presidents of common weal and peace, the Kings—whose
lordship in most ancient times was placed upon the highest pinnacle by
God Supreme; for whom the prizes have already been prepared even before
their prowess in the war; of whom the trophies have been raised even
before the shock of conflict.

For whom it is appointed not only to be Kings but also to be best.

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

At whom, before they even stir, the foreign land <span
id="fr_646"></span>[1](#fn_645.md) doth quake.

\*          \*          \*          \*          \*

##### (ABOUT THE BLESSING OF THE BETTER \[ONE\] AND PRAISING OF THE KING)

11\. But now our theme (*logos*) doth hasten on to blend its end with
its beginnings—with blessing of the Better \[One\] <span
id="fr_647"></span>[2](#fn_646.md); and then to make a final end of its
discourse (*logos*) on those divinest Kings who give us the \[great\]
prize of peace.

For just as we began \[by treating\] of the Better \[One\] and of the
Power Above, so let us make the end bend round again unto the same—the
Better \[One\].

Just as the Sun, the nurse of all the things that grow, on his first
rising, gathers unto himself the first-fruits of their yield with his
most mighty hands, using his rays as though it were for plucking off
their fruits—yea, \[for\] his rays are \[truly\] hands for him who
plucketh first the most ambrosial \[essences\] of plants—so, too, should
we, beginning from the Better \[One\], and \[thus\] recipient of His
wisdom’s stream, and turning it upon the garden of our souls above

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

the heavens, <span id="fr_648"></span>[1](#fn_647.md)—we should \[direct
and\] train these \[streams\] of blessing back again unto their source,
\[blessing\] whose entire power of germination \[in us\] He hath Himself
poured into us.

12\. ’Tis fit ten thousand tongues and voices should be used to send His
blessings back again unto the all-pure God, who is the Father of our
souls; and though we cannot utter what is fit—for we are \[far\] unequal
to the task—\[yet will we say what best we can\].

For Babes just born have not the strength to sing their Father’s glory
as it should be sung; but they give proper thanks for them, according to
their strength, and meet with pardon for their feebleness. <span
id="fr_649"></span>[2](#fn_648.md)

Nay, it is rather that God’s glory doth consist in this \[one\] very
thing—that He is greater than His children; and that the prelude and the
source, the middle and the end, of blessings, is to confess the Father
to be infinitely puissant and never knowing what a limit means.

13\. So is it, too, in the King’s case.

For that we men, as though we were the children of the King, feel it our
natural duty to give praise to him. Still must we ask for pardon \[for
our insufficiency\], e’en though ’tis granted by our Sire before we
\[even\] ask.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

And as it cannot be the Sire will turn from Babes new-born because they
are so weak, but rather will rejoice when they begin to recognise \[his
love\] <span id="fr_650"></span>[1](#fn_649.md)—so also will the Gnosis of
the all \[rejoice\], which doth distribute life to all, and power of
giving blessing back to God, which He hath given \[us\].

14\. For God, being Good, and having in Himself eternally the limit of
His own eternal fitness, and being deathless, and containing in Himself
that lot of that inheritance that cannot come unto an end, and \[thus\]
for ever ever-flowing from out that energy of His, He doth send tidings
to this world down here \[to urge us\] to the rendering of praise that
brings us home again. <span id="fr_651"></span>[2](#fn_650.md)

With Him, <span id="fr_652"></span>[3](#fn_651.md) therefore, is there no
difference with one another; there is no partiality <span
id="fr_653"></span>[4](#fn_652.md) with Him.

But they are one in Thought. One is the Prescience <span
id="fr_654"></span>[5](#fn_653.md) of all. They have one Mind—their Father.

One is the Sense that’s active through them—

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

their passion for each other. <span id="fr_655"></span>[1](#fn_654.md) ’Tis
Love <span id="fr_656"></span>[2](#fn_655.md) Himself who worketh the one
harmony of all.

15\. Thus, therefore, let us sing the praise of God.

Nay, rather, let us \[first\] descend to those who have received their
sceptres from Him.

For that we ought to make beginning with our Kings, and so by practising
ourselves on them, accustom us to songs of praise, and train ourselves
in pious service to the Better \[One\].

\[We ought\] to make the very first beginnings of our exercise of praise
begin from him, <span id="fr_657"></span>[3](#fn_656.md) and through him
exercise the practice \[of our praise\], that so there may be in us both
the exercising of our piety towards God, and of our praise to Kings.

16\. For that we ought to make return to them, in that they have
extended the prosperity of such great peace to us.

It is the virtue of the King, nay, ’tis his name alone, that doth
establish peace.

He has his name of King because he levelleth the summits of dissension
with his smooth tread, <span id="fr_658"></span>[4](#fn_657.md) and is the
lord of reason (*logos*) that \[makes\] for peace.

And in as much, in sooth, as he hath made

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

himself the natural protector of the kingdom which is not his native
land, <span id="fr_659"></span>[1](#fn_658.md) his very name \[is made\]
the sign of peace.

For that, indeed, you know, the appellation of the King has frequently
at once restrained the foe.

Nay, more, the very statues of the King are peaceful harbours for those
most tempest-tossed.

The likeness of the King alone has to appear to win the victory, and to
assure to all the citizens freedom from hurt and fear.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_629"></span>[289:1](th235.htm#fr_630.md) ἄχρι τῶν κατὰ μέρος
ὀργάνων,—that is, to “parts” as opposed to “wholes”; “wholes” signifying
generally noumenal or celestial essences, “parts” meaning the separate
existences of the phenomenal or sensible world.

<span id="fn_630"></span>[289:2](th235.htm#fr_631.md) ἄρτι δὲ καὶ αὐλητῶν
τοῖς μελικοῖς τὸ τῆς μελῳδίας λιγυρὸν ἐργασαμένων.—I do not know what
this means exactly. Ménard translates: *quand les joueurs de flûte ont
exprimé les finesses de la mélodie*; Patrizzi gives: *melicis organis
melodiæ dulcedinem.*

<span id="fn_631"></span>[289:3](th235.htm#fr_632.md) Or perhaps “he,”
meaning the judge of the contest.

<span id="fn_632"></span>[289:4](th235.htm#fr_633.md) τῷ πνεύματι.

<span id="fn_633"></span>[290:1](th235.htm#fr_634.md) The Race of the
Prophets, or Gnostics—the Race of the Logos.

<span id="fn_634"></span>[290:2](th235.htm#fr_635.md) Referring to the
“inspiration” or “breath” above,—ὡς ἀκάματον μέν ἐστι πνεῦμα ὁ θεός.
Compare John iv. 24: πνεῦμα ὁ θεός—God is Spirit.

<span id="fn_635"></span>[290:3](th235.htm#fr_636.md) The metaphor has
become somewhat mixed by the introduction of Pheidias, who was a
“musician” in marble and ivory and gold, and not on strings and pipes.

<span id="fn_636"></span>[290:4](th235.htm#fr_637.md) τῇς κρούσεως πολλάκις
πρὸς τὸν τόνον ἐμπεσούσης.

<span id="fn_637"></span>[291:1](th235.htm#fr_638.md) Reading ἔχοντες for
ἔσχον.

<span id="fn_638"></span>[291:2](th235.htm#fr_639.md) Meaning presumably
prophets.

<span id="fn_639"></span>[291:3](th235.htm#fr_640.md) It is difficult to
follow the exact meaning of some of the writer’s rhetorical sentences,
even if our text is sound; here, however, the text, even after passing
through Reitzenstein’s hands, is still very halting, and so I venture on
this translation with all hesitation.

<span id="fn_640"></span>[292:1](th235.htm#fr_641.md) The song of the
cicala was so pleasant to the ear of the Ancients, that we frequently
find it used in poetry as a simile for sweet sounds. Plato calls the
grasshoppers the “prophets of the Muses.”

<span id="fn_641"></span>[292:2](th235.htm#fr_642.md) For the idea of the
prophet being the lyre of God, *cf.* Montanus (*ap.* Epiphan., *Hær.*,
xlviii. 4). See also the references to Philo given by R. 204, n. 1.

<span id="fn_642"></span>[292:3](th235.htm#fr_643.md) *Sc.* the singer.

<span id="fn_643"></span>[293:1](th235.htm#fr_644.md) *Cf.* *K. K.*, 39 ff.

<span id="fn_644"></span>[293:2](th235.htm#fr_645.md) But see Plasberg’s
reading. R. 370.

<span id="fn_645"></span>[294:1](th235.htm#fr_646.md) τὸ βάρβαρον.

<span id="fn_646"></span>[294:2](th235.htm#fr_647.md) τοῦ κρείττονος,—that
is God, or the inner God, as in the last section.

<span id="fn_647"></span>[295:1](th235.htm#fr_648.md) εἰς τὰ ἡμέτερα τῶν
ψυχῶν ὑπερουράνια φυτά.

<span id="fn_648"></span>[295:2](th235.htm#fr_649.md) Lit. “in this.”

<span id="fn_649"></span>[296:1](th235.htm#fr_650.md) Lit. “at their
recognition,”—ἐπὶ τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως—a play on *epignōsis* and *gnōsis*, and
a parallel between the wisdom of God and the royal knowledge of the
King.

<span id="fn_650"></span>[296:2](th235.htm#fr_651.md) εἰς τόνδε τὸν κὸσμον
παρέχων τὴν ἀπαγγελίαν εἰς διασωστικὴν εὐφημίαν,—where it may be
possible to connect ἀπαγγελία with the familiar εὐαγγέλιον.

<span id="fn_651"></span>[296:3](th235.htm#fr_652.md) ἐκείσε.

<span id="fn_652"></span>[296:4](th235.htm#fr_653.md) τὸ ἀλλοπρόσαλλον.

<span id="fn_653"></span>[296:5](th235.htm#fr_654.md) πρόγνωσις.

<span id="fn_654"></span>[297:1](th235.htm#fr_655.md) τὸ εἰς ἀλλήλους
φίλτρον.

<span id="fn_655"></span>[297:2](th235.htm#fr_656.md) ὁ ἔρως,—the Higher
Love.

<span id="fn_656"></span>[297:3](th235.htm#fr_657.md) *Sc.* the King.

<span id="fn_657"></span>[297:4](th235.htm#fr_658.md) The word-play between
βασιλεὺς and βάσει λείᾳ is unreproducible in English.

<span id="fn_658"></span>[298:1](th235.htm#fr_659.md) τῆς βασιλείας τῆς
βαρβαρικῆς.
