#### XXXIII

1\. \[XII. M.\] Now on the subject of a “Void,” <span
id="fr_907"></span>[1](#fn_906.md)—which seems to almost all a thing of
vast importance,—I hold the following view.

Naught is, naught could have been, naught ever will be void.

For all the members of the Cosmos are completely full; so that Cosmos
itself is full and \[quite\] complete with bodies, diverse in quality
and form, possessing each its proper kind and size.

And of these bodies—one’s greater than another, or another’s less than
is another, by difference of strength and size.

Of course, the stronger of them are more easily perceived, just as the
larger \[are\]. The lesser ones, however, or the more minute, can
scarcely be perceived, or not at all—those which we know are things \[at
all\] by sense of touch alone.

Whence many come to think they are not bodies, and that there are void
spaces,—which is impossible.

2\. So also \[for the Space\] which is called

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Extra-cosmic,—if
there be any (which I do not believe),—\[then\] is it filled by Him with
things Intelligible, that is things of like nature with His own
Divinity; just as this Cosmos which is called the Sensible, is fully
filled with bodies and with animals, consonant with its proper nature
and its quality;—\[bodies\] the proper shape of which we do not all
behold, but \[see\] some large beyond their proper measure, some very
small; either because of the great space which lies between \[them and
ourselves\], or else because our sight is dull; so that they seem to us
to be minute, or by the multitude are thought not to exist at all,
because of their too great tenuity.

I mean the daimones, who, I believe, have their abode with us, and
heroes, who abide between the purest part of air above us and the
earth,—where it is ever cloudless, and no \[movement from the\] motion
of a single star \[disturbs the peace\].

3\. Because of this, Asclepius, thou shalt call nothing void; unless
thou wilt declare of what that’s void, which thou dost say is void;—for
instance, void of fire, of water, or things like to these.

For if it should fall out, that it should seem that anything is able to
be void of things like these,—though that which seemeth void be little

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

or be big, it still cannot be void of spirit and of air.

#### XXXIV

1\. In like way must we also talk concerning “Space,” <span
id="fr_908"></span>[1](#fn_907.md)—a term which by itself is void of
“sense.” <span id="fr_909"></span>[2](#fn_908.md)

For Space seems what it is from that of which it is \[the space\]. For
if the qualifying <span id="fr_910"></span>[3](#fn_909.md) word is cut
away, the sense is maimed.

Wherefore we shall \[more\] rightly say the space of water, space of
fire, or \[space\] of things like these.

For as it is impossible that aught be void; so is Space also in itself
not possible to be distinguished what it is.

For if you postulate a space without that \[thing\] of which it is \[the
space\], it will appear to be void space,—which I do not believe exists
in Cosmos.

2\. If nothing, then, is void, so also Space by its own self does not
show what it is unless you add to it lengths, breadths \[and
depths\],—just as you add the proper marks <span
id="fr_911"></span>[4](#fn_910.md) unto men’s bodies.

These things, then, being thus, Asclepius, and ye who are with
\[him\],—know the Intelligible

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cosmos (that is,
\[the one\] which is discerned by contemplation of the mind alone) is
bodiless; nor can aught corporal be mingled with its nature,—\[by
corporal I mean\] what can be known by quality, by quantity, and
numbers. For there is nothing of *this* kind in that.

3\. This Cosmos, then, which is called Sensible, is the receptacle of
all things sensible,—of species, qualities, or bodies.

But not a single one of these can quicken without God. For God is all,
and by Him \[are\] all things, and all \[are\] of His Will.

For that He is all Goodness, Fitness, Wisdom, unchangeable,—that can be
sensed and understood by His own self alone.

Without Him naught hath been, nor is, nor will be.

4\. For all things are from Him, in Him, and through Him,—both
multitudinous qualities, and mighty quantities, and magnitudes exceeding
every means of measurement, and species of all forms;—which things, if
thou should’st understand, Asclepius, thou wilt give thanks to God.

And if thou should’st observe it <span id="fr_912"></span>[1](#fn_911.md)
as a whole, thou wilt be taught, by means of the True Reason, that
Cosmos in itself is knowable to sense, <span
id="fr_913"></span>[2](#fn_912.md) and that all things in it are wrapped

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

as in a vesture by that Higher Cosmos <span
id="fr_914"></span>[1](#fn_913.md) \[spoken of above\].

#### XXXV

1\. Now every single class of living thing, <span
id="fr_915"></span>[2](#fn_914.md) Asclepius, of whatsoever kind, or it be
mortal or be rational, whether it be endowed with soul, or be without
one, just as each has its class, <span id="fr_916"></span>[3](#fn_915.md)
so does each several \[class\] have images of its own class.

And though each separate class of animal has in it every form of its own
class, still in the selfsame \[kind of\] form the units differ from each
other.

And so although the class of men is of one kind, so that a man can be
distinguished by his \[general\] look, still individual men within the
sameness of their \[common\] form do differ from each other.

2\. For the idea <span id="fr_917"></span>[4](#fn_916.md) which is divine,
is bodiless, and is whatever is grasped by the mind.

So that although these two, <span id="fr_918"></span>[5](#fn_917.md) from
which the general form and body are derived, are bodiless, it is
impossible that any single form should be produced exactly like
another,—because the

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

moments of the hours and points of inclination \[when they’re born\] are
different.

But they are changed as many times as there are moments in the hour of
that revolving Circle in which abides that God whom we have called
All-formed. <span id="fr_919"></span>[1](#fn_918.md)

3\. The species, <span id="fr_920"></span>[2](#fn_919.md) then, persists,
as frequently producing from itself as many images, and as diverse, as
there are moments in the Cosmic Revolution, <span
id="fr_921"></span>[3](#fn_920.md)—a Cosmos which doth \[ever\] change in
revolution. But the idea <span id="fr_922"></span>[4](#fn_921.md)
\[itself\] is neither changed nor turned.

So are the forms of every single genus permanent, \[and yet\] dissimilar
in the same \[general\] form.

#### XXXVI

1\. *Asc.* And does the Cosmos have a species, O Thrice-greatest one?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* Dost not thou see, Asclepius, that all has been explained to
thee as though to one asleep?

For what is Cosmos, or of what doth it consist, if not of all things
born?

This, <span id="fr_923"></span>[5](#fn_922.md) then, you may assert of
heaven, and

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

earth, and elements. For though the other things possess more frequent
change of species, \[still even\] heaven, \[by its\] becoming moist, or
dry, or cold, or hot, or clear, or dull, \[all\] in one kind <span
id="fr_924"></span>[1](#fn_923.md) of heaven,—these \[too\] are frequent
changes into species. <span id="fr_925"></span>[2](#fn_924.md)

2\. Earth hath, moreover, always many changes in *its* species;—both
when she brings forth fruits, and when she also nourishes her
bringings-forth with the return of all the fruits; the diverse qualities
and quantities of air, its stoppings and its flowings <span
id="fr_926"></span>[3](#fn_925.md); and before all the qualities of trees,
of flowers, and berries, of scents, of savours—species.

Fire \[also\] brings about most numerous conversions, and divine. For
these are all-formed images of Sun and Moon <span
id="fr_927"></span>[4](#fn_926.md); they’re, as it were, like our own
mirrors, which with their emulous resplendence give us back the
likenesses of our own images.
