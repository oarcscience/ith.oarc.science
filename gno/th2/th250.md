#### XXXIX

1\. \[XIV. M.\] *Asc.* What part of the economy, <span
id="fr_942"></span>[4](#fn_941) Thrice-greatest one, does the
Heimarmenē, or Fate, then occupy? For do not the celestial Gods rule
over generals <span id="fr_943"></span>[5](#fn_942); the terrene occupy
particulars?

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

*Tris.* That which we call Heimarmenē, Asclepius, is the necessity of
all things that are born, <span id="fr_944"></span>[1](#fn_943) bound
ever to themselves with interlinked enchainments.

This, then, is either the effector of all things, or it is highest God,
or what is made the second God by God Himself,—or else the
discipline <span id="fr_945"></span>[2](#fn_944) of all things both in
heaven and on earth, established by the laws of the Divine.

2\. And so these twain, Fate and Necessity, are bound to one another
mutually by inseparable cohesion. <span id="fr_946"></span>[3](#fn_945)

The former of them, the Heimarmenē, gives birth to the beginnings of all
things; Necessity compels the end of \[all\] depending from these
principals.

On these doth Order follow, that is their warp-and-woof, and Time’s
arrangement for the perfecting of \[all\] things. For there is naught
without the interblend of Order. <span id="fr_947"></span>[4](#fn_946)

<span id="page_386">p. 386</span>

That Cosmos <span id="fr_948"></span>[1](#fn_947) is made perfect in all
things; for Cosmos’ self is vehicled <span
id="fr_949"></span>[2](#fn_948) in Order, or totally consists of Order.

#### XL

1\. So, then, these three, Fate, \[and\] Necessity, \[and\] Order, are
most immediately effected by God’s Will, who rules the Cosmos by His Law
and by His Holy Reason.

From these, accordingly, all willing or not-willing is altogether
foreign, according to God’s Will. <span id="fr_950"></span>[3](#fn_949)

They are not moved by wrath nor swayed by favour, but are the
instruments of the Eternal Reason’s self-compulsion, which is \[the
Reason\] of Eternity, <span id="fr_951"></span>[4](#fn_950) that never
can be turned aside, or changed, or be destroyed.

2\. First, then, is Fate, which, as it were, by casting in the seed,
supplies the embryo of all that are to be.

Follows Necessity, whereby they all are forcibly compelled unto their
end.

Third, Order \[comes\], preserving warp-and-woof of \[all\] the things
which Fate and \[which\] Necessity arrange. <span
id="fr_952"></span>[5](#fn_951)

<span id="page_387">p. 387</span>

This, then, is the Eternity, which neither doth begin nor cease to be,
which, fixed by law unchangeable, abides in the unceasing motion of its
course.

3\. It rises and it sets, by turns, throughout its limbs <span
id="fr_953"></span>[1](#fn_952); so that by reason of Time’s changes it
often rises with the very limbs with which it \[once\] had set.

For \[its\] sphericity,—its law of revolution, <span
id="fr_954"></span>[2](#fn_953)—is of this nature, that all things are
so straitly joined to their own selves, that no one knoweth what is the
beginning of their revolution <span id="fr_955"></span>[3](#fn_954);
since they appear for ever all to go before and follow after their own
selves.

Good and bad issues, <span id="fr_956"></span>[4](#fn_955)
\[therefore,\] are commingled in all cosmic things.

<span id="fn_946"></span>[385:4](th250.htm#fr_947) *Cf.* J. Laurentius
Lydus, *De Mensibus*, iv. 7 (Wünsch, 70); the rest of the quotation
following on what has been already quoted in the note to xix. 3. The
Greek is either a very much shortened form or the Latin a very much
expanded one, for the former may be translated as follows: “And Fate is
also fated Activity (or Energy), or God Himself, or the Order that doth
follow that Activity set over all things in the heaven and all things on
the earth, together with Necessity. The former (Fate) gives birth to the
very beginnings of things, the latter compels the ends also to come into
existence. And on them there follow Order and Law, and there is naught
that’s orderless.” *Cf.* Ex. i. 15, and Ex. xi. 1.

<span id="fn_947"></span>[386:1](th250.htm#fr_948) *Mundus* = cosmos,
meaning also order in Greek.

<span id="fn_948"></span>[386:2](th250.htm#fr_949) *Gestatur.*

<span id="fn_949"></span>[386:3](th250.htm#fr_950) *Divinitus.*

<span id="fn_950"></span>[386:4](th250.htm#fr_951) That is, the Æon.

<span id="fn_951"></span>[386:5](th250.htm#fr_952) Fate thus seems to be
regarded as the Creator, Order as the Preserver, and Necessity as the
Destroyer or Regenerator.

<span id="fn_952"></span>[387:1](th250.htm#fr_953) *Membra*; that is,
parts, presumably constellations.

<span id="fn_953"></span>[387:2](th250.htm#fr_954) *Cf.* xxxv. 3 below.

<span id="fn_954"></span>[387:3](th250.htm#fr_955) *Volubilitatis*; that
is, their turning into themselves; the symbol of which was the serpent
swallowing its tail.

<span id="fn_955"></span>[387:4](th250.htm#fr_956) *Eventus et fors.*
