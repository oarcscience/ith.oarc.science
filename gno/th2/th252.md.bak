#### COMMENTARY

##### THE TITLE

The titles in the Latin MSS. vary. The heading preferred by Hildebrand
is “Asclepius, or a Dialogue of Thrice-greatest Hermes”; while in the
Bipontine edition, the title stands: “Thrice-greatest Hermes Concerning
the Nature of the Gods; A Sermon addressed to Asclepius.” Ménard, the
French translator, prefers: “A Sermon of Initiation, or Asclepius.”

The treatise begins with a transparent gloss, in all probability
originally the marginal note of some scribe,

<span id="page_391">p. 391</span>

or student, which has improperly crept into the text. It runs: “This
Asclepius is my Sun-god”; that is to say, apparently: “This Sermon
‘Asclepius’ has illumined me”; from which it is evident that the title
lying before the scribe was “Asclepius” simply, as may be seen from § 2:
“It is, however, with *thy* name I will inscribe this treatise.”
Stobæus, moreover, in quoting from the original Greek (of xxvii. 4),
heads his extract simply, “Of Hermes from the \[Sermons\] to Asclepius.”

On the other hand, the Church Father Lactantius, writing at the
beginning of the fourth century, and quoting from the Greek original,
says twice, categorically (*D. I.*, iv. 6 and vii. 8): “*Hermes in illo
libro qui* λόγος τέλειος *inscribitur*”; that is, “Hermes in the Book
entitled ‘The Perfect Sermon,’ or ‘The Sermon of Initiation’”; while
Johannes Laurentius Lydus on three occasions quotes from this “Perfect
Sermon” of Hermes, and on each occasion so names it.

I have accordingly preferred this as the main title, and added “The
Asclepius” as an alternative.

##### THE OLD LATIN TRANSLATION AND THE GREEK ORIGINAL

Of the Greek original we have quotations or references by Lactantius
(see viii. 1 and 3; xxv. 4: xxvi. 1; xli. 2), Johannes Laurentius Lydus
(see xix. 3; xxviii. 1; xxxix. 1, 2), and Stobæus (see xxvii. 4).

If we compare these Greek quotations with our Latin translation, we
shall find, not only that the Latin is an exceedingly free rendering of
the Greek, showing many expansions and contractions, and often missing
the sense of the original, but also that even in Greek there were
probably several recensions of the same text. <span
id="fr_968"></span>[1](#fn_967.md)

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

Indeed, the free rendering of our translation is of such a nature that
it is impossible to base upon it any certain conclusions as to the date
of the original or its precise worth in the history of religion. <span
id="fr_969"></span>[1](#fn_968.md)

That, however, our Latin translation is an ancient one is proved by
Augustine’s verbal quotations from it (see xxiii. 1; xxiii. 3-xxiv. 2;
xxiv. 3; xxvii. 1-4). It was thus in existence about 400 A.D. at
least. <span id="fr_970"></span>[2](#fn_969.md)

Tradition, however, has assigned to it a far higher antiquity,
attributing it to no less distinguished a writer than Appuleius, and so
referring it to the first half of the second century.

This attribution has, of course, for long been questioned by modern
criticism, and Reitzenstein, though he does not discuss the subject,
accepts the adverse verdict and refers us to a “Pseudo-Appuleius.”

Hildebrand, whose minute acquaintance with Appuleius’ peculiar style and
neologisms is a guarantee of his competence, has thoroughly gone into
the matter; and though he sums up against tradition, it is in a
half-hearted way. The translation, if not by Appuleius, is at any rate
in old African Latin, and there is nothing in the style which absolutely
forbids the possibility of its being by the author of *The Golden Ass*
and the initiate of Isis. The strongest point, other than philological,
against tradition is that Augustine *does not say* the translation was
by Appuleius; but this seems to me to be unworthy of serious
consideration.

It is, of course, difficult to turn possibilities into probabilities,
but I see no reason why the Greek original of our Sermon should not be
assigned to the

<span id="page_393">p. 393</span>

earlier Hermes-Asclepian dialogues as well as to any others. That it was
one of the most famous is evident by its wide quotation, and by the fact
that several recensions of the Greek text were in circulation.

##### OF THE WRITER AND THE PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE

The Latin translator retains a number of the original Greek technical
terms, and if we could only rely on his translation giving us the
substance of the original in all cases, we should be presented in
several passages with phenomena which would persuade us that the writer
of the original intended his readers to think he was an Egyptian, and
that his native nomenclature was other than Greek, as is also the case
in *C. H.* (xvi.).

For instance, in vii. 2, “the man ‘essential,’ <span
id="fr_971"></span>[1](#fn_970.md) as say the Greeks,”—but this may be a
gloss of the Latin translator.

Again, in x. 2: “So that . . . ‘World’ seems most fitly called ‘Cosmos’
in Greek,”—which seems to be the original.

Yet again, the “multifarious reasoning” of xii. 3 reminds us strongly of
“the philosophizing of the Greeks—the noise of words,” in *C. H.*, xvi.
2.

On the other hand, the phrase, “which we in Greek (*græce*) believe to
be the Cosmos,” would seem to make the original author forget his
Egyptian rôle.

While “its bottom . . . is called in Greek A-eidēs,” coupled with “in
Greek they are called *Hades* . . . in Latin *Inferi*” (xvii. 3), may be
assigned to a gloss of the translator.

In xxiv. 1, however, the sentence, “Dost thou not know, Asclepius, that
Egypt is the image of the Heaven? . . . This land of ours is shrine of
the whole world”—coupled with the rest of the chapter, and Ch. xxv.

<span id="page_394">p. 394</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —could hardly have
been written by a Greek. In xxviii. 1, moreover, the “weighing of the
merit” of the soul is strongly Egyptian, and so with the image and
animal-cult.

As to the persons of the dialogue, I would suggest that originally the
sermon was addressed to Asclepius alone, and that the slight narrative
indications were added later to adapt it to wider circles.

The chief disciple is evidently Asclepius; he it is who is already “well
versed in Nature,” according to *C. H.*, xiv. (xv.) 1; that is to say,
he has progressed beyond the stage of Hearer, for he questions Hermes,
whereas Tat does not ask questions, but listens only, he is “the one who
is to hear” (i. 1). To them is added Ammon on the proposal of Asclepius;
and Ammon is admitted on the ground that he had already had much
*written* to him, but apparently had not yet been admitted to oral
teaching.

The teaching is delivered in solemn surroundings in the holy place or
shrine (i. 2), and teacher and pupils constitute the “sacred four.”
Hermes teaches in a state of exaltation; the place is filled with “God’s
goodly presence,” and “Love Divine” instructs them, through Hermes’
lips, in answer to the Pure and Single Love of Philosophy in their
hearts (*cf.* xii. 3; xiv. 1).

The same hand that wrote the warning against revealing the sermon to
others in i. 2 also probably wrote: “And ye, O Tat, Asclepius and Ammon,
in silence hide the mysteries divine within the secret places of your
hearts, and breathe no word of their concealment!” (xxxii. 4); he also,
presumably, glossed “Asclepius” (xxxiv. 2) with “and ye who are with
him,” and added the naïve whisper of Asclepius to Tat (xli. 1).

This redactor (if our analysis is correct), moreover,

<span id="page_395">p. 395</span>

was a member of a select <span id="fr_972"></span>[1](#fn_971.md) ascetic
community, judging at any rate by his last sentence (xli. 5); in which
case Ammon can hardly be equated with any King Ammon, but must be taken
as standing for some grade of the community. I would suggest that this
grade was similar to that of the Exoterici of the Pythagoreans or the
outer circles of the Essenes, of which the members still lived in the
world, but received instruction. In this case, however, the “we” of the
last sentence would have to be taken as referring to Asclepius and Tat,
and not to Ammon.

As to the dependence of our sermon on the rest of the literature, I find
more points of contact between it and *C. H.*, x. (xi.), “The Key”
sermon addressed to Tat; none of the references, however, which I have
given in the notes, show any literal dependence.

##### THE DOCTRINE OF THE WILL OF GOD

In the general doctrine the stress laid on the concept of the Will of
God <span id="fr_973"></span>[2](#fn_972.md) is to be specially noticed.
This Will seems to be almost personified, and is, of course, a
fundamental doctrine of the Trismegistic religio-philosophy. <span
id="fr_974"></span>[3](#fn_973.md)

In xxvi. 1 it is identified with the Goodness <span
id="fr_975"></span>[4](#fn_974.md) of God, and the Nature of God. <span
id="fr_976"></span>[5](#fn_975.md) But what it seems to correspond to most
nearly is the Æon or Eternity-idea which is set forth very clearly in
xxx.-xxxii.—in fact, more clearly than anywhere else in the Trismegistic

<span id="page_396">p. 396</span>

literature. God and Æon are the sources of all things; and Æon is “the
Eternity of God, in Truth itself subsisting, the Fullness of all things”
(xxxii. 1). The Will of God is thus the Æon or Plērōma, the Wisdom, the
Energy, the Spouse of the Supreme.

This Will rules Cosmos with Law and Holy Reason (xl.); Cosmos being the
Order of things involved in Fate and Necessity the instruments of the
Divine Will. <span id="fr_977"></span>[1](#fn_976.md)

Our sermon is also characterized by the frequent use it makes of the
terms Spirit and Sense.

##### CONCERNING SPIRIT AND THE ALL-SENSE

The Spirit is evidently Cosmic Life (vi. 4; xxvii. 1) and individual
life (x. 4). <span id="fr_978"></span>[2](#fn_977.md) The exposition of it
begins with xiv. 2; Spirit and Matter, or the Nature of the Cosmos (xiv.
3), are practically regarded as the Positive and Negative, or Masculine
and Feminine Energies of the Divine.

Spirit is the Ruler (xvii. 1) of all things in Cosmos or Nature; it is
the immediate Instrument of the Will of God (xvi. 3); and is, indeed,
loosely identified with that Will (xix. 4); while in still looser
fashion Spirit seems to be symbolized by “Heaven” and the Sensible
Cosmos by “Earth” (xix. 2).

It is very probable that this doctrine of Spirit as Divine Breath is
fundamentally Egyptian, and owes nothing to immediate Semitic influence.
However this may be, the use of the term Sense, as apparently in some
way superior to Reason (vi. 4; x. 4), is very striking, and, as in some
cases opposed to the exaltation of the Reason found elsewhere in our
tractates, under the influence of this leading idea of Greek philosophy,
discloses an Egyptian point of view.

<span id="page_397">p. 397</span>

We have already noticed this use of the term in some of our tractates,
but in our present sermon it is brought into great prominence. This
Sense is not the differentiated senses, but a Unit or Cosmic Sense.

It is “the Divine Sense of intelligence,” and is found only in God and
in man’s reason (vii. 1; xxxii. 2).

It is the “Higher Sense (with which Celestial Gift mankind alone is
blest)”—characterized as the “feeder of the mind” (xviii. 1); yet on the
other hand this “Higher Sense” is that “which by good chance a man
perceives by mind, when out of all his senses.”

This Sense is in some fashion closely connected with Nature and Cosmos
(xxi. 1); through it man “disciplines his soul,” and “cures his
intellect,” thus gaining “intelligence of God-like Reason” (xxii. 1),
and finally “mingling himself with the All-sense of the Divine
Intelligence” (xxix. 2).

This All-sense is the same as the “Whole Sense of Divinity,” and is the
Likeness of God; it is “in its own self immoveable,” and yet “doth set
itself in motion within its own stability” (xxxii. 1). Man must make
himself like unto this Likeness.

This Likeness is evidently the Æon or Intelligible Cosmos; for the
“Cosmic Sense is the Container of all sensibles” (xxxii. 2).

In man its chief normal characteristic is the retentiveness of memory,
“through which man is made ruler of the Earth” (xxxii. 2). This Sense is
then man’s *continuum*, the germ of everlastingness in him, the
root-ground of consciousness (xxxii. 3), the Single Sense of the
intelligence (xli. 4), which is fully brought to birth only when a man
“is wholly plunged in consciousness of life (in *sensu vitæ*)” (xxxvii.
3),—the “spiritual life” of the Christian Gnostics.

The fact that we have only a translation to deal with

<span id="page_398">p. 398</span>

prevents us laying too much stress on details, but the general idea is
clear enough; so too with the rest of this, the longest of our sermons,
we must be content to refer only to general points, the chief of which
are the “prophetic” utterances.

##### THE PROPHETIC UTTERANCES

These present us with problems of very great difficulty, and, so far, I
have neither seen any solution nor has any occurred to me.

So much work has been done on contemporary prophetic utterances of this
nature, especially on the Sibylline Literature, that it may be said that
the scholastic mind has reached certain general *criteria* with regard
to such pronouncements—the chief of which is that the hypothesis of
genuine prophecy is not to be entertained.

In the Sibylline literature, indeed, this is clearly established; for
much of it consists of traditional history written in the prophetical
tense, so to say; when the history comes to an end the date of the
“prophetical” writer is at once detected, for all that follows has no
longer any relation to historical events.

In the case of our “prophecies,” however, we have nothing of this nature
to guide us. All we can say is that they seem to have been written, most
probably, at a time when the Trismegistic communities were being
persecuted.

That this was in the course of the fourth century, however, as
Reitzenstein (p. 213) supposes, seems to me to be, so far, destitute of
any sure objective confirmation; it not only compels us to suppose that
the prophecies are later interpolations (which they may possibly be),
but that these interpolations are later than Lactantius; whereas there
is every probability that

<span id="page_399">p. 399</span>

the Church Father had the text of them before him, <span
id="fr_979"></span>[1](#fn_978.md) and his date is the beginning of the
fourth century.

On the other hand, Zosimus, writing somewhere about the end of the third
and beginning of the fourth century, breathes no word of persecution,
and leads us to suppose that the community was still flourishing. We are
thus still in the gravest uncertainty.

The first of our “prophecies” is in xii. 3: “For I will tell thee as
though it were propheticly”—addressed to Asclepius, and, therefore,
probably not due to the redactor who we have supposed added the
narrative sentences.

The lament of the writer is that “the Single Love, the Love of Pure
Philosophy,” is fast disappearing from the world; he can hardly have had
Christianity in mind when writing these words, for he contrasts the
“Pure Philosophy” with “multifarious reasoning” and “divers sciences,”
and the latter can hardly be said to be characteristic of General
Christianity.

If, however, his words may be said to include also Gnostic Christianity,
then he was clearly not in sympathy with it; but this can hardly be the
case, seeing that the resemblances between the Trismegistic and
Christian Gnosis are of a very intimate nature.

##### THE PROSCRIPTION OF THE WORSHIP OF THE GODS

Turning next to xxiv. 2, we meet with the clear statement that the
worship of the Gods will be legally proscribed by the “barbarian”
masters of Egypt (also xxv. 3).

Such a general proscription in this emphatic sense took place in Egypt
only with the destruction of the Serapeum by the Christians themselves
in 389 A.D.

<span id="page_400">p. 400</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Of persecutions of
the Christians by the Roman authorities in Egypt prior to this we get
clear indications in the writings of the Christian Gnostic Basilides,
who flourished at Alexandria at the beginning of the second century, and
wrote specially of martyrdom. But this will little help us for the
proscription of a cult that favoured the worship of the Gods and of
their images.

Can it, then, be possible that these prophetic utterances were written
at a time when many of the same nature were being penned by Jew and
Christian? For our author, as for Jewish and Christian writers, the “End
of the World” was at hand; his expectation is in this precisely the same
as that of the writers of the New Testament documents.

The cause of this dire event is that Egypt, the “shrine of the whole
world,” the “Holy Land” <span id="fr_980"></span>[1](#fn_979.md) *par
excellence*, will be polluted with all iniquity and violence. The Cult
of the Gods will cease, and the Gods will leave the Earth and mount to
Heaven. The man’s whole heart is bleeding for Egypt, even as the heart
of a Jew for Jerusalem.

If there is any immediate historical references in these heartfelt
utterances, we must seek them in such phrases as: “This holiest land,
seat of our shrines and temples, shall be choked with tombs and corpses”
(xxiv. 3); “the tale of tombs shall far exceed the number of the quick”
(*ibid.*, § 4) <span id="fr_981"></span>[2](#fn_980.md); and “Egypt shall
be made the home of Scyth or Indian, or someone like to them—that is, a
foreign neighbour.”

It is true that the Christians were ever reproached

<span id="page_401">p. 401</span>

with worshipping the dead, and building churches over the bones of the
dead—an act of utter pollution according to all Pagan notions; but the
words of our author, even allowing for all hyperbole, can hardly be
construed in this sense.

People like Scyths or Indians, again, if we are to suppose any
historical reference, can hardly be imagined to refer to the Romans;
while the Goths under Alaric, who ravaged Greece in 395, 396 A.D., are
too late even for Reitzenstein. Moreover, we have already in our notes
pointed to the strange conjunction of Scyth and Barbarian in our text as
being also found in Colossians.

On the other hand, nothing but the entire State suppression of the Pagan
Religion in all its forms can satisfy xxv. 3, and this just suits the
end of the fourth century.

If, however, we cannot entertain so late a date, and I do not think we
can, there seems nothing for it but to give the writer some credit for
his prognostication of the future; for eventually things certainly
turned out for him and all he held most dear very much as he imagined or
feared they would.

##### THE LAST HOPE OF THE RELIGION OF THE MIND

At any rate the last hope of the Pure Love, the Religion of the Mind, is
in the Trismegistic Communities, if indeed it is so permitted to
interpret xxvii. 3:

“Yea, they who rule the earth shall be distributed \[through all the
lands\], and finally be gathered in a state,—at top of Egypt’s upper
part,—which shall be founded towards the setting sun, and to which all
the mortal race shall speed.”

We need not insist upon details, for our translator

<span id="page_402">p. 402</span>

may have gone wide of the original; for instance, the “race” may,
instead of being “mortal” in the original, have been the “Race” of which
we have already heard so much in Philo and these tractates; but the
similarity of the idea cannot fail to remind us of Philo when, in
writing of the Redeemed of Spiritual Israel, he says:

“Those who were but scattered in Hellas and non-Grecian (Barbarian)
lands, over islands and over continents, shall rise up with one impulse,
and from diverse regions flock together unto the one spot revealed to
them.” <span id="fr_982"></span>[1](#fn_981.md)

And with this further compare the famous passage on the Therapeuts:

“Now this Race of men is to be found in many parts of the inhabited
world, both the Grecian and non-Grecian world, sharing in the Perfect
Good.

“In Egypt there are crowds of them in every province, or nome as they
call it, and especially round Alexandria. For they who are in every way
(or in every nome) the most highly advanced, come as colonists, <span
id="fr_983"></span>[2](#fn_982.md) as it were, to the Therapeutic
fatherland.” <span id="fr_984"></span>[3](#fn_983.md)

Moreover, just as the Therapeuts in the immediately following lines of
Philo are said to have their community on a hill, so too in our text we
immediately find mention of the Trismegistic communities as having their
chief centre on the Libyan Hill,—a community which is spoken of as “very
large” in numbers, and so is somewhat of a contradiction to the numbers
of the Pious given in xxii. 1, where we are told “they may be counted
even in the world,” unless the sentence is to be taken as rhetorical.

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

This Hill is called the Libyan Mount, a vague enough title; nor is this
vagueness removed when we find it again referred to (in xxxvii. 3) as
the place of burial of the body of the First Asclepius, and obtain the
additional information that it is “hard by the shore of crocodiles,” for
this can hardly refer to Crocodilopolis in the Fayyūm, the most northern
of the towns so named, seeing that the Libyan Mount is “at the top of
Egypt’s upper part,” and “towards the setting sun.”

This, however, corresponds admirably with the location of Philo’s
Therapeut community on the southern shore of Lake Mareotis, just south
of Alexandria; but few indeed will be found to entertain the possibility
even that Philo and our author may be speaking of the same people from
different standpoints and under different names.

As far as I can see, there is no certainty in the matter; and,
therefore, I leave it as a problem of immense interest that has not as
yet found a solution.
