### THE CUP OR MONAD

##### OF HERMES TO TAT

<span class="small">(Text: P. 34-40; Pat. 26b-27.)</span>

1\. *Hermes.* With Reason (*Logos*), not with hands, did the
World-maker <span id="fr_145"></span>[1](#fn_145.md) make the universal
World <span id="fr_146"></span>[2](#fn_146.md); so that thou thus shouldst
think of Him as everywhere and ever-being, the Author of all things, and
One and Only, who by His Will <span id="fr_147"></span>[3](#fn_147.md) all
beings hath created.

This Body of Him is a thing no man can touch, or see, or measure, a Body
inextensible, like to no other frame. ’Tis neither Fire nor Water, Air
nor Breath <span id="fr_148"></span>[4](#fn_148.md); yet all of them come
from it. <span id="fr_149"></span>[5](#fn_149.md) Now being Good He willed
to consecrate this \[Body\] to Himself alone, and set its Earth in order
and adorn it. <span id="fr_150"></span>[6](#fn_150.md)

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

2\. So down \[to Earth\] He sent the Cosmos <span
id="fr_151"></span>[1](#fn_151.md) of this Frame Divine, <span
id="fr_152"></span>[2](#fn_152.md)—man, a life that cannot die, and yet a
life that dies. And o’er \[all other\] lives and over Cosmos \[too\],
did man excel by reason of the Reason (*Logos*) and the Mind. For
contemplator of God’s works did man become; he marvelled and did strive
to know their Author.

3\. Reason (*Logos*) indeed, O Tat, among all men hath He distributed,
but Mind not yet; not that He grudgeth any, for grudging cometh not from
Him, <span id="fr_153"></span>[3](#fn_153.md) but hath its place below,
within the souls of men who have no Mind.

*Tat.* Why then did God, O father, not on all bestow a share of Mind?

*Her.* He willed, my son, to have it set up in the midst for souls, just
as it were a prize.

4\. *Tat.* And where hath He had it set up?

*Her.* <span id="fr_154"></span>[4](#fn_154.md) He tilled a mighty
Cup <span id="fr_155"></span>[5](#fn_155.md) with it, and sent it down,
joining a Herald \[to it\], to whom He gave command to make this
proclamation to the hearts of men:

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

Baptize <span id="fr_156"></span>[1](#fn_156.md) thyself with this Cup’s
baptism, what heart can do so, thou that hast faith thou canst ascend to
Him that hath sent down the Cup, thou that dost know for what thou didst
come into being!

As many then as understood the Herald’s tidings and doused themselves in
Mind, became partakers in the Gnosis; and when they had “received the
Mind” they were made “perfect men.”

But they who do not understand the tidings,these, since they possess the
aid of Reason \[only\] and not Mind, are ignorant wherefor they have
come into being and whereby.

5\. The senses of such men are like irrational creatures’; and as their
\[whole\] make-up is in their feelings and their impulses, <span
id="fr_157"></span>[2](#fn_157.md) they fail in all appreciation of <span
id="fr_158"></span>[3](#fn_158.md) those things which really are worth
contemplation. These centre all their thought upon the pleasures of the
body and its appetites, in the belief that for its sake man hath come
into being.

But they who have received some portion of God’s gift, <span
id="fr_159"></span>[4](#fn_159.md) these, Tat, if we judge by their deeds,
have from Death’s bonds won their release; for they embrace in their own
Mind all things,

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

things on the earth, things in the heaven, and things above the
heaven,—if there be aught. <span id="fr_160"></span>[1](#fn_160.md) And
having raised themselves so far they sight the Good; and having sighted
It, they look upon their sojourn here as a mischance; and in disdain of
all, both things in body and the bodiless, they speed their way unto
that One and Only One.

6\. This is, O Tat, the Gnosis of the Mind, Vision of things Divine;
God-knowledge is it, for the Cup is God’s.

*Tat.* Father, I, too, would be baptized.

*Her.* Unless thou first shalt hate thy Body, son, thou canst not love
thy Self. But if thou lov’st thy Self thou shalt have Mind, and having
Mind thou shalt share in the Gnosis.

*Tat.* Father, what dost thou mean?

*Her.* It is not possible, my son, to give thyself to both,—I mean to
things that perish and to things divine. For seeing that existing things
are twain, Body and Bodiless, in which the perishing and the divine are
understood, the man who hath the will to choose is left the choice of
one or other; for it can never be the twain should meet. And in those
souls to whom the choice is left, the waning of the one causes the
other’s growth to show itself.

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

7\. Now the choosing of the Better not only proves a lot most fair for
him who makes the choice, seeing it makes the man a God, but also shows
his piety to God. Whereas the \[choosing\] of the Worse, although it
doth destroy the “man,” it only doth disturb God’s harmony to this
extent, that as processions pass by in the middle of the way, without
being able to do anything but take the road from others, so do such men
move in procession through the world led by their bodies’
pleasures. <span id="fr_161"></span>[1](#fn_161.md)

8\. This being so, O Tat, what comes from God hath been and will be
ours; but that which is dependent on ourselves, let this press onward
and have no delay; for ’tis not God, ’tis we who are the cause of evil
things, preferring them to good.

Thou see’st, son, how many are the bodies through which we have to pass,
how many are the choirs of daimones, how vast the system of the
star-courses <span id="fr_162"></span>[2](#fn_162.md) \[through which our
Path doth lie\], to hasten to the One and Only God.

For to the Good there is no other shore <span
id="fr_163"></span>[3](#fn_163.md); It hath no bounds; It is without an
end; and

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

for Itself It is without beginning, too, though unto us it *seemeth* to
have one—the Gnosis.

9\. Therefore to It Gnosis is no beginning; rather is it \[that Gnosis
doth afford\] to *us* the first beginning of *Its being known.*

Let us lay hold, therefore, of the beginning, and quickly speed through
all \[we have to pass\].

’Tis very hard, to leave the things we have grown used to, which meet
our gaze on every side, and turn ourselves back to the Old Old \[Path\].

Appearances delight us, whereas things which appear not make their
believing hard.

Now evils are the more apparent things, whereas the Good can never show
Itself unto the eyes, for It hath neither form nor figure.

Therefore the Good is like Itself alone, and unlike all things else; for
’tis impossible that That which hath no body should make Itself apparent
to a body.

10\. The “Like’s” superiority to the “Unlike “and the “Unlike’s” <span
id="fr_164"></span>[1](#fn_164.md) inferiority unto the “Like” consists in
this:

The Oneness <span id="fr_165"></span>[2](#fn_165.md) being Source <span
id="fr_166"></span>[3](#fn_166.md) and Root of all, is in all things as
Root and Source. Without \[this\] Source is naught; whereas the Source
\[Itself\] is from naught but Itself, since It is

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Source of all the
rest. It is Itself Its Source, since It may have no other Source.

The Oneness then being Source, containeth every number, but is contained
by none; engendereth every number, but is engendered by no other one.

11\. Now all that is engendered is imperfect, it is divisible, to
increase subject and to decrease; but with the Perfect \[One\] none of
these things doth hold. Now that which is increasable increases from the
Oneness, but succumbs through its own feebleness when it no longer can
contain the One.

And now, O Tat, God’s Image <span id="fr_167"></span>[1](#fn_167.md) hath
been sketched for thee, as far as it can be <span
id="fr_168"></span>[2](#fn_168.md); and if thou wilt attentively dwell on
it and observe it with thy heart’s eyes, believe me, son, thou’lt find
the Path that leads above; nay, that Image shall become thy Guide <span
id="fr_169"></span>[3](#fn_169.md) itself, because the Sight \[Divine\]
hath this peculiar \[charm\], it holdeth fast and draweth unto it those
who succeed in opening their eyes, just as, they say, the magnet
\[draweth\] iron. <span id="fr_170"></span>[4](#fn_170.md)

(xiv.) 6.

<span id="fn_150"></span>[85:6](th209.htm#fr_150.md) κοσμῆσαι, the whole is
a play on the word κόσμος (*kosmos*) which means “order,” “ornament,”
and “world.” I have tried to retain it in English by using both
meanings. The three preceding sentences, from “This Body” onwards, are
quoted by Stobæus, *Phys.*, I. ii. 30; G. i. 26; W. 38, 10 ff., under
the heading “Of Hermes.”

<span id="fn_151"></span>[86:1](th209.htm#fr_151.md) That is, “Order.”

<span id="fn_152"></span>[86:2](th209.htm#fr_152.md) That is, the Body of
God; the One Element.

or mixing-bowl.

<span id="fn_156"></span>[87:1](th209.htm#fr_156.md) The meaning of this
term is not to “sprinkle” with water, but to “plunge the whole body”
into water.

<span id="fn_157"></span>[87:2](th209.htm#fr_157.md) καὶ ἐν θυμῷ καὶ ἐν
ὀργῇ τὴν κρᾶσιν ἔχοντες.

wonder at.”

<span id="fn_159"></span>[87:4](th209.htm#fr_159.md) *Sc.* the Mind.

<span id="fn_160"></span>[88:1](th209.htm#fr_160.md) *Cf.* *C. H.* xi.
(xii.) 19: “And contemplate what is beyond—if there be aught beyond the
Cosmos.”

<span id="fn_161"></span>[89:1](th209.htm#fr_161.md) Critical text of
simile is also given by R. 102, n. 2. Quoted by Zosimus in § “On the
Anthropos Doctrine.”

<span id="fn_162"></span>[89:2](th209.htm#fr_162.md) καὶ συνέχειαν καὶ
δρόμους ἀστέρων, the Septenary Spheres or “Cyclic Gods”; for the συέχεια
(lit. continuity) is evidently the same as the ἁρμονία, Harmony,
Concord, System.

<span id="fn_163"></span>[89:3](th209.htm#fr_163.md) ἀδιάβατον,—lit. not to
be crossed, not to be forded.

<span id="fn_164"></span>[90:1](th209.htm#fr_164.md) Reading with B., τοῦ
ἀνομοίου.

<span id="fn_165"></span>[90:2](th209.htm#fr_165.md) μονάς,—the Monad, that
is the Good.

<span id="fn_166"></span>[90:3](th209.htm#fr_166.md) Or, Beginning.

<span id="fn_167"></span>[91:1](th209.htm#fr_167.md) The Universal Cosmos
or Monad.

<span id="fn_168"></span>[91:2](th209.htm#fr_168.md) The above sentences,
beginning with “The Oneness,” second paragraph of § 10, are quoted by
Stobæus, *Phys.*, I. x. 15; G. pp. 116, 117; W. 127, 6 ff .; under the
heading, “Of Hermes.”

<span id="fn_169"></span>[91:3](th209.htm#fr_169.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, vii.
(viii.) 2; ix. (x.) 10; x. (xi.) 21; R. 23, n. 5.

<span id="fn_170"></span>[91:4](th209.htm#fr_170.md) This simile is also
used in the Naassene Document, and in Plutarch, *On Isis and Osiris*,
where I have noticed it.
