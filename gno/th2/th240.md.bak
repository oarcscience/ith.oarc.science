*Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2*, by G.R.S. Mead, \[1906\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3\. \[IV. M.\] *Asc.* What, then, Thrice-greatest one, has caused it
that man should be planted in the world, and should not pass his life in
highest happiness in that part \[of the universe\] where there is God?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

\[*Tris.*\] Rightly thou questionest, O \[my\] Asclepius! And we pray
God that He bestow on us the power of setting forth this reason; since
everything depends upon His Will, and specially those things that are
set forth about the Highest Whole, the Reason that’s the object of our
present argument. Hear, then, Asclepius!

#### VIII

1\. The Lord and Maker of all things, whom we call rightly God, when
from Himself He made the second \[God\], the Visible and Sensible, <span
id="fr_718"></span>[1](#fn_717.md)—I call him Sensible not that He hath
sensation in Himself (for as to this, whether or no He have himself
sensation, we will some other time declare), but that He is the object
of the senses of those who see;—when, then, He made Him first, but
second to Himself, and that He seemed

<span id="page_321">p. 321</span>

to Him \[most\] fair, as one filled to the full with goodness of all
things, He fell in love with Him as being part of His Divinity. <span
id="fr_719"></span>[1](#fn_718.md)

2\. Accordingly, in that He was so mighty and so fair, He willed that
some one else should have the power to contemplate the One He had made
from Himself. And thereon He made man,—the imitator of His Reason and
His Love. <span id="fr_720"></span>[2](#fn_719.md)

The Will of God is in itself complete accomplishment; inasmuch as
together with His having willed, in one and the same time He hath
brought it to full accomplishment.

And so, when He perceived that the “essential” <span
id="fr_721"></span>[3](#fn_720.md) \[man\] could not be lover <span
id="fr_722"></span>[4](#fn_721.md) of all things, unless He clothed him in
a cosmic carapace, He shut him in within a house of body,—and ordered it
that all \[men\] should be so,—from either nature making him a single
blend and fair-proportioned mixture.

<span id="page_322">p. 322</span>

3\. Therefore hath He made man of soul and body,—that is, of an eternal
and a mortal nature; so that an animal thus blended can content his dual
origin,—admire and worship things in heaven, and cultivate and govern
things on earth. <span id="fr_723"></span>[1](#fn_722.md)

By mortal things <span id="fr_724"></span>[2](#fn_723.md) I do not mean the
water or the earth \[themselves\], for these are two of the \[immortal\]
elements that nature hath made subject unto men,—but \[either\] things
that are by men, or \[that are\] in or from them <span
id="fr_725"></span>[3](#fn_724.md); such as the cultivation of the earth
itself, pastures, \[and\] buildings, harbours, voyagings,
intercommunications, mutual services, which are the firmest bonds of men
between themselves and that part of the Cosmos which consists \[indeed\]
of water and of earth, \[but is\] the Cosmos’ terrene part,—which is
preserved by knowledge and the use of arts and sciences; without which
\[things\] God willeth not Cosmos should be complete. <span
id="fr_726"></span>[4](#fn_725.md)

<span id="page_323">p. 323</span>

In that necessity doth follow what seems good to God; performance waits
upon His will.

Nor is it credible that that which once hath pleased Him, will become
unpleasing unto God; since He hath known both what will be, and what
will please Him, long before.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_717"></span>[320:1](th240.htm#fr_718.md) *Sc.* the Logos as
Cosmos. *Cf.* xxxi. 1 below.

<span id="fn_718"></span>[321:1](th240.htm#fr_719.md) The Greek original of
this passage is quoted by Lactantius, *Div. Institt.*, iv. 6, and runs
as follows in Fritzsche’s (O. F.) text (Leipzig, 1842):  
  
“The Lord and Maker of all things (whom ’tis our custom to call God)
when He had made the second God, the Visible and Sensible,—I call him
Sensible not that He hath sensation in Himself (for as to this, whether
or no He have himself sensation, we will some other time enquire), but
that He is object of senses and of mind;—when, then, He’d made Him
first, and One and Only, He seemed to Him most fair, and filled quite
full of all things good. At Him He marvelled, and loved Him altogether
as His Son.” With the last words, *cf.* Plat., *Tim.*, 37 D.

<span id="fn_719"></span>[321:2](th240.htm#fr_720.md) *Diligentiæ.*

<span id="fn_720"></span>[321:3](th240.htm#fr_721.md) The Greek οὐσιώδης
being again, as in vii. 2, retained in the Latin. *Cf.* *C. H.*, i. 15
and ix. (x.) 5.

<span id="fn_721"></span>[321:4](th240.htm#fr_722.md) *Diligentem.*

<span id="fn_722"></span>[322:1](th240.htm#fr_723.md) This sentence is also
quoted by Lactantius (*Div. Institt.*, vii. 13) in the original Greek,
which reads:  
  
“From the two natures, the deathless and the mortal, He made one
nature,—that of man, one and the selfsame thing. And having made the
selfsame \[man\] both somehow deathless and also somehow mortal, He
brought him \[forth\], and set him up betwixt the godlike and immortal
nature and the mortal; that seeing all he might wonder at all.”

<span id="fn_723"></span>[322:2](th240.htm#fr_724.md) That is, the “things
on earth.”

<span id="fn_724"></span>[322:3](th240.htm#fr_725.md) That is, the two
elements mentioned.

<span id="fn_725"></span>[322:4](th240.htm#fr_726.md) The above paragraph
seems to have been very imperfectly translated into Latin.
