### THE SECRET SERMON ON THE MOUNTAIN

##### CONCERNING REBIRTH AND THE PROMISE OF SILENCE

##### OF THRICE-GREATEST HERMES UNTO TAT HIS SON

<span class="small">(Text: R. 339-348; P. 114-128; Pat. 15b-17b.)</span>

1\. *Tat.* \[Now\] in the General Sermons, <span
id="fr_441"></span>[1](#fn_441.md) father, thou didst speak in riddles most
unclear, conversing on Divinity; and when thou saidst no man could e’er
be saved before Rebirth, <span id="fr_442"></span>[2](#fn_442.md) thy
meaning thou didst hide.

Further, when I became thy Suppliant, in Wending up the Mount, <span
id="fr_443"></span>[3](#fn_443.md) after thou hadst conversed with me, and
when I longed to learn the Sermon (*Logos*) on Rebirth (for this beyond
all

<span id="page_220">p. 220</span>

other things is just the thing I know not), thou saidst, that thou
wouldst give it me—“when thou shalt have become a stranger to the
world.” <span id="fr_444"></span>[1](#fn_444.md)

Wherefore I got me ready and made the thought in me a stranger <span
id="fr_445"></span>[2](#fn_445.md) to the world-illusion.

And now do thou fill up the things that fall short <span
id="fr_446"></span>[3](#fn_446.md) in me with what thou saidst would give
me the tradition <span id="fr_447"></span>[4](#fn_447.md) of Rebirth,
setting it forth in speech or in the secret way.

I know not, O Thrice-greatest one, from out what matter and what womb
Man comes to birth, or of what seed. <span
id="fr_448"></span>[5](#fn_448.md)

2\. *Hermes.* Wisdom that understands <span
id="fr_449"></span>[6](#fn_449.md) in silence <span
id="fr_450"></span>[7](#fn_450.md) \[such is the matter and the womb from
out which Man is born\], and the True Good the seed.

*Tat.* Who is the sower, father? For I am altogether at a loss.

*Her.* It is the Will of God, my son.

*Tat.* And of what kind is he that is begotten, father? For I have no
share of that essence in

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

me, which doth transcend the senses. <span
id="fr_451"></span>[1](#fn_451.md) The one that is begot will be another
one from God, God’s Son?

*Her.* All in all, out of all powers composed.

*Tat.* Thou tellest me a riddle, father, and dost not speak as father
unto son.

*Her.* This Race, <span id="fr_452"></span>[2](#fn_452.md) my son, is never
taught; but when He willeth it, its memory is restored by God.

3\. *Tat.* Thou sayest things impossible, O father, things that are
forced. Hence answers would I have direct unto these things. Am I a son
strange to my father’s race?

Keep it not, father, back from me. I am a true-born son; explain to me
the manner of Rebirth.

*Her.* What may I say, my son? I can but tell thee *this.* Whene’er I
see within myself the Simple Vision <span
id="fr_453"></span>[3](#fn_453.md) brought to birth out of God’s
mercy, <span id="fr_454"></span>[4](#fn_454.md) I have passed through
myself into a Body that can never die. And now I am not what I was
before; but I am born in Mind.

The way to do this is not taught, and it cannot be seen by the
compounded <span id="fr_455"></span>[5](#fn_455.md) element by means of
which thou seest.

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

Yea, I have had my former composed form dismembered for me. I am no
longer touched, yet have I touch; I have dimension too; and \[yet\] am I
a stranger to them now.

Thou seest me with eyes, my son; but what I am thou dost not understand
\[even\] with fullest strain of body and of sight.

4\. *Tat.* Into fierce frenzy and mind-fury hast thou plunged me,
father, for now no longer do I see myself.

*Her.* I would, my son, that thou hadst e’en passed right through
thyself, as they who dream in sleep yet sleepless.

*Tat.* Tell me this too! Who is the author <span
id="fr_456"></span>[1](#fn_456.md) of Rebirth?

*Her.* The Son of God, the One Man, by God’s Will.

5\. *Tat.* Now hast thou brought me, father, unto pure stupefaction.

Arrested from the senses which I had before, . . . . <span
id="fr_457"></span>[2](#fn_457.md); for \[now\] I see thy Greatness
identical with thy distinctive form.

*Her.* Even in this thou art untrue <span
id="fr_458"></span>[3](#fn_458.md); the mortal form doth change with every
day. ’Tis turned by time to growth and waning, as being an untrue
thing. <span id="fr_459"></span>[4](#fn_459.md)

6\. *Tat.* What then is true, Thrice-greatest One?

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

*Her.* That which is never troubled, son, which cannot be defined; that
which no colour hath, nor any figure, which is not turned, which hath no
garment, which giveth light; that which is comprehensible unto itself
\[alone\], which doth not suffer change; that which no body can
contain. <span id="fr_460"></span>[1](#fn_460.md)

*Tat.* In very truth I lose my reason, father. Just when I thought to be
made wise by thee, I find the senses of this mind of mine blocked up.

*Her.* Thus is it, son: That which is upward borne like fire, yet is
borne down like earth, that which is moist like water, yet blows like
air, <span id="fr_461"></span>[2](#fn_461.md) how shalt thou *this*
perceive with sense—the that which is not solid nor yet moist, which
naught can bind or loose, of which in power and energy alone can man
have any notion,—and even then it wants a man who can <span
id="fr_462"></span>[3](#fn_462.md) perceive the Way of Birth in God <span
id="fr_463"></span>[4](#fn_463.md)?

7\. *Tat.* I am incapable of this, O father, then?

*Her.* Nay, God forbid, my son! Withdraw into thyself, and it will come;
*will*, and it comes to pass; throw out of work the body’s senses, and
thy Divinity shall come to birth; purge from thyself the brutish
torments—things of matter.

*Tat.* I have tormentors then in me, O father?

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

*Her.* Ay, no few, my son; nay, fearful ones and manifold.

*Tat.* I do not know them, father.

*Her.* Torment the first is this Not-knowing, <span
id="fr_464"></span>[1](#fn_464.md) son; the second one is Grief; the third,
Intemperance; the fourth, Concupiscence; the fifth, Unrighteousness; the
sixth is Avarice; the seventh, Error <span
id="fr_465"></span>[2](#fn_465.md); the eighth is Envy; the ninth,
Guile <span id="fr_466"></span>[3](#fn_466.md); the tenth is Anger;
eleventh, Rashness; the twelfth is Malice.

These are in number twelve; but under them are many more, my son; and
creeping through the prison of the body <span
id="fr_467"></span>[4](#fn_467.md) they force the man that’s placed
within <span id="fr_468"></span>[5](#fn_468.md) to suffer in his senses.
But they depart (although not all at once) from him who hath been taken
pity on by God <span id="fr_469"></span>[6](#fn_469.md); and this it is
which constitutes the manner of Rebirth. And . . . . <span
id="fr_470"></span>[7](#fn_470) the Reason (*Logos*.md).

8\. And now, my son, be still and solemn silence keep! Thus shall the
mercy that flows on us from God not cease.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Henceforth rejoice, O son, for by the Powers of God thou art being
purified for the articulation of the Reason (*Logos*).

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

Gnosis of God hath come to us, and when this comes, my son, Not-knowing
is cast out.

Gnosis of Joy hath come to us, and on its coming, son, Sorrow will flee
away to them who give it room. The Power that follows Joy do I invoke,
thy Self-control. O Power most sweet! Let us most gladly bid it welcome,
son! How with its coming doth it chase Intemperance away!

9\. Now fourth, on Continence I call, the Power against Desire.

. . . . <span id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_471.md) This step, my son, is
Righteousness’ firm seat. For without judgment <span
id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_472.md) see how she hath chased Unrighteousness
away. We are made righteous, son, by the departure of Unrighteousness.

Power sixth I call to us,—that against Avarice, Sharing-with-all. <span
id="fr_473"></span>[3](#fn_473.md)

And now that Avarice is gone, I call on Truth. And Error flees, and
Truth is with us.

See how \[the measure of\] the Good is full, my

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

son, upon Truth’s coming. For Envy hath gone from us; and unto Truth is
joined the Good as well, with Life and Light.

And now no more doth any torment of the Darkness venture nigh, but
vanquished \[all\] have fled with whirring wings.

10\. Thou knowest \[now\], my son, the manner of Rebirth. And when the
Ten is come, my son, that driveth out the Twelve, the Birth in
understanding <span id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_474.md) is complete, and by
this Birth we are made into Gods.

Who then doth by His mercy gain this Birth in God, abandoning the body’s
senses, knows himself \[to be of Light and Life <span
id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_475.md)\] and that he doth consist of these, and
\[thus\] is filled with Bliss.

11\. *Tat.* By God made steadfast, father, no longer with the sight my
eyes afford I look on things, but with the energy the Mind doth give me
through the Powers. <span id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_476.md)

In heaven am I, in earth, in water, air; I am in animals, in plants; I’m
in the womb, before the womb, after the womb; I’m everywhere!

But further tell me this: How are the torments of the Darkness, when
they are twelve in number, driven out by the ten Powers? What is the way
of it, Thrice-greatest one?

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

12\. *Her.* This dwelling-place <span id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477.md)
through which we have just passed, my son, is constituted from the
circle of the types-of-life, this being composed of elements, twelve in
number, but of one nature, an omniform <span
id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_478.md) idea. For man’s delusion there are
disunions <span id="fr_479"></span>[3](#fn_479.md) in them, son, while in
their action they are one. Not only can we never part Rashness from
Wrath; they cannot even be distinguished.

According to right reason (*logos*), then, they <span
id="fr_480"></span>[4](#fn_480.md) naturally withdraw once and for all, in
as much as they are chased out by no less than ten powers, that is, the
Ten.

For, son, the Ten is that which giveth birth to souls. And Life and
Light are unified there, where the One hath being from the Spirit.
According then to reason (*logos*) the One contains the Ten, the Ten the
One.

13\. *Tat.* Father, I see the All, I see myself in Mind.

*Her.* This is, my son, Rebirth—no more to look on things from body’s
view-point (a thing three ways in space extended), <span
id="fr_481"></span>[5](#fn_481.md) . . . <span
id="fr_482"></span>[6](#fn_482) though this Sermon (*Logos*.md) on Rebirth,
on which I did not

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

comment <span id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_483.md);—in order that we may not
be calumniators <span id="fr_484"></span>[2](#fn_484.md) of the All unto
the multitude, to whom indeed the God Himself doth will we should not.

14\. *Tat.* Tell me, O father: This Body which is made up of the Powers,
is it at any time dissolved?

*Her.* Hush, \[son\]! Speak not of things impossible, else wilt thou sin
and thy Mind’s eye be quenched.

The natural body which our sense perceives is far removed from this
*essential* birth.

The first must be dissolved, the last can never be; the first must die,
the last death cannot touch.

Dost thou not know thou hast been born a God, Son of the One, even as I
myself?

15\. *Tat.* I would, O father, hear the Praise-giving with hymn which
thou didst say thou heardest then when thou wert at the Eight \[the
Ogdoad\] of Powers.

*Her.* Just as the Shepherd did foretell \[I should\], my son, \[when I
came to\] the Eight. <span id="fr_485"></span>[3](#fn_485.md)

Well dost thou haste to “strike thy tent,” <span
id="fr_486"></span>[4](#fn_486.md) for thou hast been made pure.

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

The Shepherd, Mind of all masterhood, <span
id="fr_487"></span>[1](#fn_487.md) hath not passed on to me more than hath
been writ down, for full well did He know that I should of myself be
able to learn all, and hear what I should wish, and see all things.

He left to me the making of fair things <span
id="fr_488"></span>[2](#fn_488.md); wherefore the Powers within me, e’en as
they are in all, <span id="fr_489"></span>[3](#fn_489.md) break into song.

16\. *Tat.* Father, I wish to hear; I long to know these things.

*Her.* Be still, my son; hear the Praise-giving now that keeps \[the
soul\] in tune, Hymn of Re-birth—a hymn I would not have thought fit so
readily to tell, had’st thou not reached the end of all.

Wherefore this is not taught, but is kept hid in silence.

Thus then, my son, stand in a place uncovered to the sky, facing the
southern wind, <span id="fr_490"></span>[4](#fn_490.md) about the sinking
of the setting sun, and make thy worship; so in like manner too when he
doth rise, with face to the east wind.

Now, son, be still!

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

##### THE SECRET HYMNODY

17\. Let every nature of the World receive the utterance of my hymn!

Open thou Earth! Let every bolt of the Abyss be drawn for me. Stir not,
ye Trees!

I am about to hymn creation’s Lord, both All and One.

Ye Heavens open, and ye Winds stay still; \[and\] let God’s deathless
Sphere receive my word (*logos*)!

For I will sing the praise of Him who founded all; who fixed the Earth,
and hung up Heaven, and gave command that Ocean should afford sweet
water \[to the Earth\], to both those parts that are inhabited and those
that are not, for the support and use of every man; who made the Fire to
shine for gods and men for every act.

Let us together all give praise to Him, sublime above the Heavens, of
every nature Lord!

’Tis He who is the Eye of Mind; may He accept the praise of these my
Powers!

18\. Ye Powers that are within me, hymn the One and All; sing with my
Will, Powers all that are within me!

O blessed Gnosis, by thee illumined, hymning through thee the Light that
mind alone can see, <span id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_491.md) I joy in Joy
of Mind.

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

Sing with me praises all ye Powers!

Sing praise, my Self-control; sing thou through me, my Righteousness,
the praises of the Righteous; sing thou, my Sharing-all, the praises of
the All; through me sing, Truth, Truth’s praises!

Sing thou, O Good, the Good! O Life and Light, from us to you our
praises flow!

Father, I give Thee thanks, to Thee Thou Energy of all my Powers; I give
Thee thanks, O God, Thou Power of all my Energies!

19\. Thy Reason (*Logos*) sings through me Thy praises. Take back
through me the All into \[Thy\] Reason—\[my\] reasonable oblation <span
id="fr_492"></span>[1](#fn_492.md)!

Thus cry the Powers in me. They sing Thy praise, Thou All; they do Thy
Will.

*From* Thee Thy Will <span id="fr_493"></span>[2](#fn_493.md); *to* Thee
the All. Receive from all their reasonable oblation. The All that is in
us, O Life, preserve; O Light illumine it; O God in-spirit it. <span
id="fr_494"></span>[3](#fn_494.md)

It is Thy Mind that plays the Shepherd <span
id="fr_495"></span>[4](#fn_495.md) to Thy Word, <span
id="fr_496"></span>[5](#fn_496.md) O Thou Creator, Bestower of the Spirit
\[upon all\]. <span id="fr_497"></span>[6](#fn_497.md)

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

20\. \[For\] Thou art God; Thy Man <span id="fr_498"></span>[1](#fn_498.md)
thus cries to Thee through Fire, through Air, through Earth, through
Water, \[and\] through Spirit, through Thy creatures.

’Tis from Thy Æon I have found Praise-giving; and in Thy Will, <span
id="fr_499"></span>[2](#fn_499.md) the object of my search, have I found
rest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tat.* By thy good pleasure <span id="fr_500"></span>[3](#fn_500.md) have I
seen this Praise-giving being *sung*, <span
id="fr_501"></span>[4](#fn_501.md) O father; I have set it in *my* Cosmos
too.

*Her.* Say in the Cosmos that thy mind alone can see, my son.

*Tat.* Yea, father, in the Cosmos that the mind alone can see; for I
have been made able by thy Hymn, and by thy Praise-giving my mind hath
been illumined. But further I myself as well would from my natural mind
send praise-giving to God.

21\. *Her.* But not unheedfully, my son.

*Tat.* Ay. What I behold in mind, that do I say.

To thee, thou Parent of my Bringing into Birth, as unto God I, Tat, send
reasonable offerings. <span id="fr_502"></span>[5](#fn_502.md) O God and
Father, thou art the Lord, thou art the Mind. Receive from me oblations

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

reasonable as thou would’st wish; for by thy Will all things have been
perfected.

*Her.* Send thou oblation, son, acceptable to God, the Sire of all; but
add, my son, too, “through the Word” (*Logos*).

*Tat.* I give thee, father, thanks for showing me to sing such hymns.

22\. *Her.* Happy am I, my son, that thou hast brought the good fruits
forth of Truth, products that cannot die.

And now that thou hast learnt this lesson from me, make promise to keep
silence <span id="fr_503"></span>[1](#fn_503.md) on thy virtue, and to no
soul, my son, make known the handing on to thee the manner of Rebirth,
that we may not be thought to be calumniators. <span
id="fr_504"></span>[2](#fn_504.md)

And now we both of us have given heed sufficiently, both I the speaker
and the hearer thou.

In Mind <span id="fr_505"></span>[3](#fn_505.md) hast thou become a Knower
of thyself and of our \[common\] Sire.

understand the various translations. Everard gives “without labour”;
Parthey, “*nulla contentione*”; Ménard, “*sans combat*”; Chambers,
“without contention.” I would, therefore, render it: “See how she hath
chased out Unrighteousness without a home”; for it seems to me that in
χωρὶς κτίσεως we have the exact antithesis of ἕδρασμα. Righteousness has
here her firm seat or abode, and Unrighteousness is thus naturally
without a home.
