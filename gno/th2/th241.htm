<p>1. [V. M.] But, O Asclepius, I see that thou with swift desire of mind art in a hurry to be told how man can have a love and worship of the Heaven, or of the things that are therein. Hear, then, Asclepius!</p>
<p>The love of God and Heaven, together with all them that are therein, is one perpetual act of worship.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_727"></A><A HREF="#fn_726"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>
<p>No other thing ensouled, of Gods or animals, can do this thing, save man alone.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_728"></A><A HREF="#fn_727"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> &#146;Tis in the admiration, adoration, [and] the praise of men, and [in their] acts of worship, that Heaven and Heaven&#146;s hosts find their delight.</p>
<p>2. Nor is it without cause the Muses&#146; choir hath been sent down by Highest Deity unto the host of men; in order that, forsooth, the terrene world should not seem too uncultured, had it lacked the charm of measures, but rather that with songs and praise of men accompanied with</p>

<p>music,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_729"></A><A HREF="#fn_728"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> He might be lauded,&#8212;He who alone is all, or is the Sire of all; and so not even on the earths,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_730"></A><A HREF="#fn_729"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> should there have been an absence of the sweetness of the harmony of heavenly praise.</p>
<p>3. Some, then, though they be very few, endowed with the Pure Mind,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_731"></A><A HREF="#fn_730"><FONT SIZE="1">3</FONT></A> have been entrusted with the sacred charge of contemplating Heaven.</p>
<p>Whereas those men who, from the two-fold blending of their nature, have not as yet withdrawn their inner reason from their body&#146;s mass,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_732"></A><A HREF="#fn_731"><FONT SIZE="1">4</FONT></A> these are appointed for the study of the elements, and [all] that is below them.</p>
<p>4. Thus man&#146;s an animal; yet not indeed less potent in that he&#146;s partly mortal, but rather doth he seem to be all the more fit and efficacious for reaching Certain Reason, since he has had mortality bestowed on him as well.</p>
<p>For it is plain he could not have sustained the strain of both, unless he had been formed out of both natures,&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_733"></A><A HREF="#fn_732"><FONT SIZE="1">5</FONT></A> so that he could possess the powers of cultivating Earthly things and loving Heaven.</p>

<p>1. The Reason of a thesis such as this, O [my] Asclepius, I would that thou should&#146;st grasp, not only with the keen attention of thy soul, but also with its living power&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_734"></A><A HREF="#fn_733"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A> [as well].</p>
<p>For &#146;tis a Reason that most men cannot believe; the Perfect and the True are to be grasped by the more holy minds.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_735"></A><A HREF="#fn_734"><FONT SIZE="1">2</FONT></A> Hence, then, will I begin.</p>
