#### CORPUS HERMETICUM VIII. (IX.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### THAT NO ONE OF EXISTING THINGS DOTH PERISH, BUT MEN IN ERROR SPEAK OF THEIR CHANGES AS DESTRUCTIONS AND AS DEATHS

##### \[OF HERMES TO TAT\]

<span class="small">(Text: P. 56-59; Pat. 48a, 48b.)</span>

1\. \[*Hermes.*\] Concerning Soul and Body, son, we now must speak; in
what way Soul is deathless, and whence comes the activity <span
id="fr_210"></span>[1](#fn_210.md) in composing and dissolving Body.

For there’s no *death* for aught of things \[that are\]; the thought
\[this\] word conveys, is either void of fact, or \[simply\] by the
knocking off a syllable what is called “death,” doth stand for
“deathless.” <span id="fr_211"></span>[2](#fn_211.md)

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

For death is of destruction, and nothing in the Cosmos is destroyed. For
if Cosmos is second God, a life <span id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_212.md)
that cannot die, it cannot be that any part of this immortal life should
die. All things in Cosmos are parts of Cosmos, and most of all is man,
the rational animal.

2\. For truly first of all, eternal and transcending birth, is God the
universals’ Maker. Second is he “after His image,” Cosmos, brought into
being by Him, sustained and fed by Him, made deathless, as by his own
Sire, living for aye, as ever free from death.

Now that which ever-liveth, differs from the Eternal; for He <span
id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_213.md) hath not been brought to being *by*
*another*, and even if He have been *brought to being*, He hath not
*been* brought into being by Himself, but ever *is* brought into being.

For the Eternal, in that It is eternal, is the all. The Father is
Himself eternal *of* Himself, but Cosmos hath become eternal and
immortal *by* the Father.

3\. And of the matter stored beneath it, <span
id="fr_214"></span>[3](#fn_214.md) the Father made of it a universal body,
and packing it together made it spherical—wrapping it round the
life <span id="fr_215"></span>[4](#fn_215.md)—\[a sphere\] which is
immortal in itself, and that doth make materiality eternal.

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

But He, the Father, full-filled with His ideas, did sow the lives <span
id="fr_216"></span>[1](#fn_216.md) into the sphere, and shut them in as in
a cave, willing to order forth <span id="fr_217"></span>[2](#fn_217.md) the
life with every kind of living.

So He with deathlessness enclosed the universal body, that matter might
not wish to separate itself from body’s composition, and so dissolve
into its own \[original\] unorder.

For matter, son, when it was yet incorporate, was in unorder. And it
doth still retain down here this \[nature of unorder\] enveloping the
rest of the small lives <span id="fr_218"></span>[3](#fn_218.md)—that
increase-and-decrease which men call death.

4\. It is round earthly lives that this unorder doth exist. For that the
bodies of the heavenly ones preserve one order allotted to them from the
Father as their rule <span id="fr_219"></span>[4](#fn_219.md); and it is by
the restoration <span id="fr_220"></span>[5](#fn_220.md) of each one \[of
them\] this order is preserved indissolute. <span
id="fr_221"></span>[6](#fn_221.md)

The “restoration” then of bodies on the earth

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

is \[thus their\] composition, whereas their dissolution restores them
to those bodies which can never be dissolved, that is to say, which know
no death. Privation, thus, of sense is brought about, not loss of
bodies.

5\. Now the third life—Man, after the image of the Cosmos made, \[and\]
having mind, after the Father’s will, beyond all earthly lives—not only
doth have feeling with the second God, but also hath conception of the
first; for of the one ’tis sensible as of a body, while of the other it
conceives as bodiless and the Good Mind.

*Tat.* Doth then *this* life not perish?

*Her.* Hush, son! and understand what God, what Cosmos \[is\], what is a
life that cannot die, and what a life subject to dissolution.

Yea, understand the Cosmos is by God and in God; but Man by Cosmos and
in Cosmos.

The source and limit and the constitution of all things is God.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_210"></span>[124:1](th217.htm#fr_210.md) ἐνέργεια.

<span id="fn_211"></span>[124:2](th217.htm#fr_211.md) The text is obscure,
and the translations without exception make nonsense of it. Some words
seem to be missing.

<span id="fn_212"></span>[125:1](th217.htm#fr_212.md) Living thing,
“animal.”

<span id="fn_213"></span>[125:2](th217.htm#fr_213.md) *Sc.* the Eternal.

<span id="fn_214"></span>[125:3](th217.htm#fr_214.md) *Sc.* beneath the
cosmos, world-order or universe.

<span id="fn_215"></span>[125:4](th217.htm#fr_215.md) The text here seems
to me to be very faulty; for ποιόν, ποιά, I read ζῷον, ζῷα. In such
unintelligible phrases as αὐτῷ τὸ ποιόν, and τὸ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ ποιόν, the
writer is evidently dealing with the Cosmos as the one life, the
αὐτόζῳον, from which all other lives are derived; and if he did not
write αὐτόζῳον, he assuredly wrote ζῷν. He wrote sense and not the
nonsense of the present text.

<span id="fn_216"></span>[126:1](th217.htm#fr_216.md) *Sc.* the great lives
or so-called heavenly “bodies.”

<span id="fn_217"></span>[126:2](th217.htm#fr_217.md) Or beautify.

<span id="fn_218"></span>[126:3](th217.htm#fr_218.md) As distinguished from
the great lives or animals, the so-called heavenly “bodies.”

<span id="fn_219"></span>[126:4](th217.htm#fr_219.md) τὴν ἀρχήν,—or source
or principle.

<span id="fn_220"></span>[126:5](th217.htm#fr_220.md) ἀποκατάστασις, a term
used of the cyclic return of stars to their original positions.

<span id="fn_221"></span>[126:6](th217.htm#fr_221.md) If we may be
permitted to coin a neologism.
