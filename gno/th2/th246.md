*Thrice-Greatest Hermes, Vol. 2*, by G.R.S. Mead, \[1906\], at
Intangible Textual Heritage

------------------------------------------------------------------------

4\. \[X. M.\] But now the question as to deathlessness or as to death
must be discussed.

The expectation and the fear of death torture the multitude, who do not
know True Reason.

Now death is brought about by dissolution of the body, wearied out with
toil, and of the number, when complete, by which the body’s members are
arranged into a single engine for the purposes of life. The body dies,
when it no longer can support the life-powers <span
id="fr_863"></span>[3](#fn_862.md) of a man.

This, then, is death,—the body’s dissolution, and the disappearance of
corporeal sense. <span id="fr_864"></span>[4](#fn_863.md)

As to *this* death anxiety is needless. But there’s another \[death\]
which no man can

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

escape, <span id="fr_865"></span>[1](#fn_864.md) but which the ignorance
and unbelief of man think little of.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

5\. *Asc.* What is it, O Thrice-greatest one, that men know nothing of,
or disbelieve that it can be?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* So, lend thy ear, Asclepius!

#### XXVIII

1\. When, \[then,\] the soul’s departure from the body shall take
place,—then shall the judgment and the weighing of its merit pass into
its highest daimon’s power. <span id="fr_866"></span>[2](#fn_865.md)

And when he sees it pious is and just,—he suffers it to rest in spots
appropriate to it.

But if he find it soiled with stains of evil deeds, and fouled with
vice,—he drives it from Above into the Depths, and hands it o’er to
warring hurricanes and vortices of Air, of Fire, and Water. <span
id="fr_867"></span>[3](#fn_866.md)

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

2\. ’Twixt Heaven and Earth, upon the waves of Cosmos, is it dragged in
contrary directions, for ever racked with ceaseless pains <span
id="fr_868"></span>[1](#fn_867.md); so that in this its deathless nature
doth afflict the soul, in that because of its unceasing sense, it hath
the yoke of ceaseless torture set upon its neck.

Know, then, that we should dread, and be

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

afraid, and \[ever\] be upon our guard, lest we should be entangled in
these \[toils\].

For those who do not now believe, will after their misdeeds be driven to
believe, by facts not words, by actual sufferings of punishment and not
by threats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

3\. *Asc.* The faults of men are not, then, punished, O Thrice-greatest
one, by law of man alone?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* In the first place, Asclepius, all things on Earth must die.

Further, those things which live by reason of a body, and which do cease
from living by reason of the same,—all these, according to the merits of
this life, or its demerits, find due \[rewards or\] punishments.

\[And as to punishments\] they’re all the more severe, if in their life
\[their misdeeds\] chance to have been hidden, till their death. <span
id="fr_869"></span>[1](#fn_868.md) For \[then\] they will be made full
conscious of all things by the divinity, just as they are, according to
the shades of punishment allotted to their crimes.

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

#### XXIX

1\. *Asc.* And these deserve \[still\] greater punishments,
Thrice-greatest one?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Tris.* \[Assuredly;\] for those condemned by laws of man do lose their
life by violence, so that \[all\] men may see they have not yielded up
their soul to pay the debt of nature, but have received the penalty of
their deserts.

Upon the other hand, the righteous man finds his defence in serving God
and deepest piety. For God doth guard such men from every ill. <span
id="fr_870"></span>[1](#fn_869.md)

2\. Yea, He who is the Sire of all, \[our\] Lord, and who alone is all,
doth love to show Himself to all.

It is not by the place where he may be, nor by the quality which he may
have, nor by the greatness which he may possess, but by the mind’s
intelligence alone, that He doth shed His light on man,—\[on him\] who
shakes the clouds of Error from his soul, and sights the brilliancy of
Truth, <span id="fr_871"></span>[2](#fn_870.md) mingling himself with the
All-sense of the Divine Intelligence; through love <span
id="fr_872"></span>[3](#fn_871.md) of which he wins his freedom from that
part of him o’er which Death rules, and has the

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

seed of the assurance of his future Deathlessness implanted in him.

3\. This, then, is how the good will differ from the bad. Each several
one will shine in piety, in sanctity, in prudence, in worship, and in
service of \[our\] God, and see True Reason, as though \[he looked at
it\] with \[corporal\] eyes; and each will by the confidence of his
belief excel all other men, as by its light the Sun the other
stars. <span id="fr_873"></span>[1](#fn_872.md)

For that it is not so much by the greatness of his light as by his
holiness and his divinity, the Sun himself lights up the other
stars. <span id="fr_874"></span>[2](#fn_873.md)

Yea, \[my\] Asclepius, thou should’st regard him as the second
God, <span id="fr_875"></span>[3](#fn_874.md) ruling all things, and giving
light to all things living in the Cosmos, whether ensouled or
unensouled.

For if the Cosmos is a living thing, and if it has been, and it is, and
will be ever-living,—naught in the Cosmos is subject to death.

For of an ever-living thing, it is \[the same\] of every part which is;
\[that is,\] that ’tis \[as ever-living\] as it is \[itself\]; and in
the World itself \[which is\] for everyone, and at the self-same time an
ever-living thing of life,—in it there is no place for death. <span
id="fr_876"></span>[4](#fn_875.md)

5\. And so he <span id="fr_877"></span>[5](#fn_876.md) should be the full
store of

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

life and deathlessness; if that it needs must be that he should live for
ever.

And so the Sun, just as the Cosmos, lasts for aye. So is he, too, for
ever ruler of \[all\] vital powers, or of \[our\] whole vitality; he is
their ruler, or the one who gives them out.

God, then, is the eternal ruler of all living things, or vital
functions, that are in the World. He is the everlasting giver-forth of
Life itself. <span id="fr_878"></span>[1](#fn_877.md)

Once for all \[time\] He hath bestowed Life on all vital powers; He
further doth preserve them by a law that lasts for evermore, as I will
\[now\] explain.

#### XXX

1\. For in the very Life of the Eternity <span
id="fr_879"></span>[2](#fn_878.md) is Cosmos moved; and in the very
Everlastingness <span id="fr_880"></span>[3](#fn_879.md) of Life \[itself\]
is Cosmic Space. <span id="fr_881"></span>[4](#fn_880.md)

On which account it <span id="fr_882"></span>[5](#fn_881.md) shall not stop
at any time, nor shall it be destroyed; for that its very self is
palisaded <span id="fr_883"></span>[6](#fn_882.md) round about, and bound
together as it were, by Living’s Sempiternity.

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

Cosmos is \[thus\] Life-giver unto all that are in it, and is the Space
of all that are in governance beneath the Sun.

The motion of the Cosmos in itself consisteth of a two-fold energy. ’Tis
vivified itself from the without by the Eternity, <span
id="fr_884"></span>[1](#fn_883.md) and vivifies all things that are within,
making all different, by numbers and by times, fixed and appointed \[for
them\].

2\. Now Time’s distinguished on the Earth by quality of air, by
variation of its heat and cold; in Heaven by the returnings of the stars
to the same spots, the revolution of their course in Time.

And while the Cosmos is the home <span id="fr_885"></span>[2](#fn_884.md)
of Time, <span id="fr_886"></span>[3](#fn_885.md) it is kept green
\[itself\] by reason of Time’s course and motion.

Time, on the other hand, is kept by regulation. Order and Time effect
renewal of all things which are in Cosmos by means of alternation.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_862"></span>[360:3](th246.htm#fr_863.md) *Vitalia.*

<span id="fn_863"></span>[360:4](th246.htm#fr_864.md) This passage is
quoted in the original Greek by Stobæus, *Florilegium*, cxx. 27 (G. iii.
464; M. iv. 105, 106; Pat. 45, under title “Death”), under the heading
“Of Hermes from the \[Sermons\] to Asclepius.” It runs as follows:  
  
“Now must we speak of death. For death affrights the many as the
greatest of all ills, in ignorance of fact. Death is the dissolution of
the toiling frame. For when the ‘number’ of the body’s joints becomes
complete,—the basis of the body’s jointing being number,—that body dies;
\[that is,\] when it no longer can support the man. And this is
death,—the body’s dissolution and the disappearance of corporeal
sense.”  
  
The directness and the sturdy vigour of the Greek original has clearly
lost much in the rhetorical paraphrasing of the Latin translator.

<span id="fn_864"></span>[361:1](th246.htm#fr_865.md) *Necessaria.*

<span id="fn_865"></span>[361:2](th246.htm#fr_866.md) *Cf.* *C. H.*, x.
(xi.) 21.

<span id="fn_866"></span>[361:3](th246.htm#fr_867.md) The substance of
these two sentences is contained in a “quotation” from the Greek by J.
Laurentius Lydus, *De Mensibus*, iv. 149 (Wünsch, 167, 15): “According
to the Egyptian Hermes who, in what is called ‘The Perfect Sermon,’ says
as follows: ‘But such souls as transgress the norm of piety, when they
do leave their body, are handed over to the daimones and carried
downwards through the air, cast forth as from a sling into the zones of
fire and hail, which poets call Pyriphlegethon and Tartarus.’” That this
is a “quotation,” however, I doubt very much, for if we compare it with
*D. M.*, iv. 31 (W. 90, 24), which very faintly echoes the teaching of
our chaps, iv., v., xxvii., we shall find that Tartarus and
Pyriphlegethon are entirely due to Laurentius himself. The passage runs
as follows:  
  
“For the Egyptian Hermes, in his Sermon called Perfect, says that the
Avenging of the daimones, being present in matter itself, chastise the
human part \[of us\] according as it has deserved; while the Purifying
ones confined to the air purify the souls after death that are trying to
soar aloft, \[conducting them\] round the haily and fiery zones of the
air, which the poets and Plato himself in the *Phædo* call Tartarus and
Pyriphlegethon; while the Saving ones again, stationed in the lunar
space, save the souls.” *Cf.* Ex. ix. 6.

<span id="fn_867"></span>[362:1](th246.htm#fr_868.md) Ménard here quotes a
couple of lines from Empedocles (*c.* 494-434 B.C.), cited by Plutarch,
but without giving any reference. They are from the famous passage
beginning ἔστιν ἀνάγκης χρῆμα κ.τ.λ. (369-382), of which the following
is Fairbanks’ translation. See Fairbanks (A.), *The First Philosophers
of Greece* (London, 1898), p. 205:  
  
“There is an utterance of Necessity, an ancient decree of the Gods,
eternal, sealed fast with broad oaths: Whenever any one defiles his body
sinfully with bloody gore or perjures himself in regard to
wrongdoing,—one of those spirits who are heir to long life (δαίμων οἵτε
μακραίωνες λελάχασι βιοῖο),—thrice ten thousand seasons shall he wander
apart from the blessed, being born meanwhile in all sorts of mortal
forms (φυόμενον παντοῖα διὰ χρόνου εἴδεα θνητῶν) changing one bitter
path of life for another. For mighty Air pursues him Seaward, and Sea
spews him forth on the threshold of Earth, and Earth casts him into the
rays of the unwearied Sun, and Sun into the eddies of Air: one receives
him from the other, and all hate him. One of these now am I too, a
fugitive from the gods and a wanderer, at the mercy of raging Strife.”

<span id="fn_868"></span>[363:1](th246.htm#fr_869.md) *Cf.* the Vision of
Thespesius (Aridæus) in Plutarch, *De Sera Numinis Vindicta*: “Thus he
had to see that the shades of notorious criminals who had been punished
in earth-life were not so hardly dealt with . . . ; whereas those who
had passed their lives in undetected vice, under cloak and show of
virtue, were hemmed in by the retributory agents, and forced with labour
and pain to turn their souls inside out.”

<span id="fn_869"></span>[364:1](th246.htm#fr_870.md) Compare the Fragment
quoted in Greek by Lactantius, *D. I.*, ii. 15, and by Cyril, *C. J.*,
iv. 130.

<span id="fn_882"></span>[366:6](th246.htm#fr_883.md) *Circumvallatus et
quasi constrictus.* Compare with this the idea of the Horos or Boundary
in the æonology of “Them of Valentinus,” as set forth by Hippolytus
(*Philosophumena*, vi. 31):  
  
“Moreover that the formlessness of the Abortion should finally never
again make itself visible to the perfect Æons, the Father Himself also
sent forth the additional emanation of a single Æon, the Cross \[or
Stock, τὸν σταυρόν\], which being created great, as \[the creature\] of
the great and perfect Father, and emanated to be the Guard and Wall of
protection \[lit. Paling or Stockade—χαράκωμα, the Roman *vallum*\] of
the Æons, constitutes the Boundary (ὅρος) of the Plērōma, holding the
thirty Æons together within itself. For these \[thirty\] are they which
form the divine creation.” See *F. F. F.*, p. 342.

<span id="fn_883"></span>[367:1](th246.htm#fr_884.md) That is, the Æon.
