3\. \[XI. M.\] All things, then, being thus,

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

there’s nothing stable, nothing fixed, nothing immoveable, of things
that are being born, in Heaven or on the Earth.

Immoveable <span id="fr_887"></span>[1](#fn_886.md) \[is\] God alone, and
rightly \[He\] alone; for He Himself is in Himself, and by Himself, and
round Himself, completely full and perfect.

He is His own immoveable stability. Nor by the pressure of some other
one can He be moved, nor in the space \[of anyone\].

4\. For in Him are all \[spaces\], and He Himself alone is in them all;
unless someone should venture to assert that God’s own motion’s in
Eternity <span id="fr_888"></span>[2](#fn_887.md); nay, rather, it is just
Immoveable Eternity itself, back into which the motion of all times is
funded, and out of which the motion of all times takes its beginning.

#### XXXI

1\. God, then, hath \[ever\] been unchanging, <span
id="fr_889"></span>[3](#fn_888.md) and ever, in like fashion, with Himself
hath the Eternity consisted,—having within itself Cosmos ingenerate,
which we correctly call \[God\] Sensible. <span
id="fr_890"></span>[4](#fn_889.md)

Of that \[transcendent\] Deity this Image <span
id="fr_891"></span>[5](#fn_890.md) hath been made,—Cosmos the imitator of
Eternity.

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

Time, further, hath the strength and nature of its own stability, in
spite of its being in perpetual motion,—from its necessity of \[ever\]
from itself reverting to itself.

2\. And so, although Eternity is stable, motionless, and fixed, still,
seeing that the movement of \[this\] Time (which is subject to motion)
is ever being recalled into Eternity,—and for that reason Time’s
mobility is circular,—it comes to pass that the Eternity itself,
although in its own self, is motionless, \[yet\] on account of Time, in
which it is—(and it *is* in it),—it seems to be in movement as all
motion.

So that it comes to pass, that both Eternity’s stability becometh moved,
and Time’s mobility becometh stable.

So may we ever hold that God Himself is moved into Himself by \[ever-\]
same transcendency of motion. <span id="fr_892"></span>[1](#fn_891.md)

For that stability is in His vastness motion motionless; for by His
vastness is \[His\] law exempt from change. <span
id="fr_893"></span>[2](#fn_892.md)

3\. That, then, which so transcends, which is not subject unto sense,
\[which is\] beyond all bounds, \[and which\] cannot be grasped,—That

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

transcends all appraisement; That cannot be supported, nor borne up, nor
can it be tracked out. <span id="fr_894"></span>[1](#fn_893.md)

For where, and when, and whence, and how, and what, He is,—is known to
none. <span id="fr_895"></span>[2](#fn_894.md) For He’s borne up by \[His\]
supreme stability, and His stability is in Himself \[alone\],—whether
\[this mystery\] be God, or the Eternity, or both, or one in other, or
both in either.

4\. And for this cause, just as Eternity transcends the bounds of Time;
so Time \[itself\], in that it cannot have bounds set to it by number,
or by change, or by the period of the revolution of some second \[kind
of Time\],—is of the nature of Eternity.

Both, then, seem boundless, both eternal. And so stability, though
naturally fixed, yet seeing that it can sustain the things that are in
motion,—because of all the good it does by reason of its firmness,
deservedly doth hold the chiefest place.

#### XXXII

1\. The principals of all that are, are, therefore, God and Æon. <span
id="fr_896"></span>[3](#fn_895.md)

The Cosmos, on the other hand, in that ’tis moveable, is not a
principal. <span id="fr_897"></span>[4](#fn_896.md)

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

For its mobility exceeds its own stability by treating the immoveable
fixation as the law of everlasting movement.

The Whole Sense, <span id="fr_898"></span>[1](#fn_897.md) then, of the
Divinity, though like \[to Him\] in its own self immoveable, doth set
itself in motion within its own stability.

’Tis holy, incorruptible, and everlasting, and if there can be any
better attribute to give to it, \[’tis its\],—Eternity of God supreme,
in Truth itself subsisting, the Fullness of all things, of Sense, and of
the whole of Science, consisting, so to say, with God. <span
id="fr_899"></span>[2](#fn_898.md)

2\. The Cosmic Sense is the container <span
id="fr_900"></span>[3](#fn_899.md) of all sensibles, \[all\] species, and
\[all\] sciences.

The human \[higher sense consists\] in the retentiveness of memory, in
that it can recall all things that it hath done.

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

For only just as far as the man-animal has the divinity of Sense <span
id="fr_901"></span>[1](#fn_900.md) descended; in that God hath not willed
the highest Sense divine should be commingled with the rest of animals;
lest it should blush for shame <span id="fr_902"></span>[2](#fn_901.md) on
being mingled with the other lives.

For whatsoever be the quality, or the extent, of the intelligence of a
man’s Sense, the whole of it consists in power of recollecting what is
past.

It is through his retentiveness of memory, that man’s been made the
ruler of the earth.

3\. Now the intelligence of Nature <span id="fr_903"></span>[3](#fn_902.md)
can be won by quality of Cosmic Sense,—from all the things in Cosmos
which sense can perceive.

Concerning \[*this*\] Eternity, which is the second \[one\],—the Sense
of this we get from out the senses’ Cosmos, and we discern its quality
\[by the same means\].

But the intelligence of Quality \[itself\], the “Whatness” of the Sense
of God Supreme, is Truth alone,—of which \[pure\] Truth not even the
most tenuous sketch, or \[faintest\] shade, in Cosmos is discerned.

For where is aught \[of it\] discerned by measurement of times,—wherein
are seen untruths, and births \[-and-deaths\], and errors?

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

4\. Thou seest, then, Asclepius, on what we are \[already\] founded,
with what we occupy ourselves, and after what we dare to strive.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But unto Thee, O God most high, I give my thanks, in that Thou hast
enlightened me with Light to see Divinity!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

And ye, O Tat, Asclepius and Ammon, in silence hide the mysteries divine
within the secret places of your hearts, <span
id="fr_904"></span>[1](#fn_903.md) and breathe no word of their
concealment <span id="fr_905"></span>[2](#fn_904.md)!

5\. Now in our case the intellect doth differ from the sense in
this,—that by the mind’s extension intellect can reach to the
intelligence and the discernment of the quality of Cosmic Sense.

The Intellect of Cosmos, on the other hand, extends to the Eternity and
to the Gnosis of the Gods who are above itself. <span
id="fr_906"></span>[3](#fn_905.md)

And thus it comes to pass for men, that we perceive the things in
Heaven, as it were through a mist, as far as the condition of the human
sense allows.

’Tis true that the extension \[of the mind\] which we possess for the
survey of such transcendent things, is very narrow \[still\]; but \[it

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

will be\] most ample when it shall perceive with the felicity of
\[true\] self-consciousness.

<span id="fn_898"></span>[371:2](th247.htm#fr_899.md) *Consistens, ut ita
dixerim, cum deo.* Is there possibly here underlying the Latin
*consistens cum deo* the expanded form of the peculiar and elliptical
πρὸς τὸν θεὸν of the Proem to the Fourth Gospel (the *apud deum* of the
Vulgate)? This was explained by the Gnostic Ptolemy, somewhere about the
middle of the second century, as “at-one-ment with God,” in his exegesis
of the opening words, which he glosses as: “The at-one-ment with each
other, together with their at-one-ment with the Father” (ἡ πρὸς ἀλλήλους
ἄμα καὶ ἡ πρὸς τὸν πατέρα ἕνωσις). So that the first verse of the Proem
would run: “In the Beginning was the Logos, and the Logos was (one) with
God; yea, the Logos was God. He was in the Beginning (one) with God”—?
*consistens cum deo.* See Irenæus, *Ref. Om. Hær.*, I. viii. 5—Stieren
(Leipzig; 1853), i. 102; also *F. F. F.*, p. 388.
