### THE PERFECT SERMON

#### OR THE ASCLEPIUS

<span class="small">(Text: The Greek original is lost, and only a Latin
version remains to us. I use the text of Hildebrand (G. F.), *L. Apuleii
Opera Omnia ex Fide Optimorum Codicum* (Leipzig, 1842), Pars II., pp.
279-334; but have very occasionally preferred the text in Patrizzi’s
*Nova de Universis Philosophia* (Venice, 1593), or of the Bipontine
edition of Appuleius, *Lucii Apuleji Madaurensis Platonici Philosophi
Opera* (Biponti, 1788), pp. 285-325.)</span>

#### I

1. <span id="fr_669"></span>[1](#fn_668) \[I. M. <span
id="fr_670"></span>[2](#fn_669)\] \[*Trismegistus.*\] God, O Asclepius,
hath brought thee unto us that thou mayest hear a Godly sermon, <span
id="fr_671"></span>[3](#fn_670) a sermon such as well may seem of all
the previous ones we’ve \[either\] uttered, or with which we’ve been
inspired by the Divine, more Godly than the piety of \[ordinary\] faith.

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

If thou with eye of intellect <span id="fr_672"></span>[1](#fn_671)
shalt *see* this Word <span id="fr_673"></span>[2](#fn_672) thou shalt
in thy whole mind be filled quite full of all things good.

If that, indeed, the “many” be the “good,” and not the “one,” in which
are “all.” Indeed the difference between the two is found in their
agreement,—“All” is of “One” <span id="fr_674"></span>[3](#fn_673) or
“One” is “All.” So closely bound is each to other, that neither can be
parted from its mate.

But this with diligent attention shalt thou learn from out the sermon
that shall follow \[this\].

But do thou, O Asclepius, go forth a moment and call in the one who is
to hear. <span id="fr_675"></span>[4](#fn_674)

(And when he had come in, Asclepius proposed that Ammon too should be
allowed to come. Thereon Thrice-greatest said:)

\[*Tris.*\] There is no cause why Ammon should be kept away from us. For
we remember how we have ourselves set down in writing many things to his
address, <span id="fr_676"></span>[5](#fn_675) as though unto a son most
dear and most beloved, of physics many things, of ethics \[too\] as many
as could be.

It is, however, with *thy* name I will inscribe this treatise.

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

But call, I prithee, no one else but Ammon, lest a most pious sermon on
a so great theme be spoilt by the admission of the multitude.

For ’tis the mark of an unpious mind to publish to the knowledge of the
crowd a tractate brimming o’er with the full Greatness of Divinity.

(When Ammon too had come within the holy place, and when the sacred
group of four was now complete with piety and with God’s goodly
presence—to them, sunk in fit silence reverently, their souls and minds
pendent on Hermes’ lips, thus Love <span id="fr_677"></span>[1](#fn_676)
Divine began to speak.)

#### II

1\. \[*Tris.*\] The soul of every man, O \[my\] Asclepius, is deathless;
yet not all in like fashion, but some in one way or \[one\] time, some
in another.

*Asc.* Is not, then, O Thrice-greatest one, each soul of one \[and the
same\] quality?

*Tris.* How quickly hast thou fallen, O Asclepius, from reason’s true
sobriety!

Did not I say that “All” is “One,” and “One” is “All,” <span
id="fr_678"></span>[2](#fn_677) in as much as all things have

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

been in the Creator before they were created. Nor is He called unfitly
“All,” in that His members are the “All.”

Therefore, in all this argument, see that thou keep in mind Him who is
“One”-“All,” or who Himself is maker of the “All.”

2\. All things descend from Heaven to Earth, to Water and to Air.

’Tis Fire alone, in that it is borne upwards, giveth life; that which
\[is carried\] downwards \[is\] subservient to Fire.

Further, whatever doth descend from the above, begetteth; what floweth
upwards, nourisheth.

’Tis Earth alone, in that it resteth on itself, that is Receiver of all
things, and \[also\] the Restorer of all genera that it receives.

This Whole, <span id="fr_679"></span>[1](#fn_678) therefore, as thou
rememberest, <span id="fr_680"></span>[2](#fn_679) in that it is of
all,—in other words, all things, embraced by nature under “Soul” and
“World,” <span id="fr_681"></span>[3](#fn_680) are in \[perpetual\]
flux, so varied by the multiform equality of all their forms, that
countless kinds of well-distinguished qualities may be discerned, yet
with this bond of union, that all should seem as One, and from “One”
“All.” <span id="fr_682"></span>[4](#fn_681)

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

#### III

1\. That, then, from which the whole Cosmos is formed, consisteth of
Four Elements—Fire, Water, Earth, and Air; Cosmos \[itself is\] one,
\[its\] Soul \[is\] one, and God is one.

Now lend to me the whole of thee, <span
id="fr_683"></span>[1](#fn_682)—all that thou can’st in mind, all that
thou skill’st in penetration.

For that the Reason <span id="fr_684"></span>[2](#fn_683) of Divinity
may not be known except by an intention of the senses like to it. <span
id="fr_685"></span>[3](#fn_684)

’Tis <span id="fr_686"></span>[4](#fn_685) likest to the torrent’s
flood, down-dashing headlong from above with all-devouring tide; so that
it comes about, that by the swiftness of its speed it is too quick for
our attention, not only for the hearers, but also for the very
teachers. <span id="fr_687"></span>[5](#fn_686)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_668"></span>[307:1](th237.htm#fr_669) I have added numbers
to the paragraphs for greater convenience of reference.

<span id="fn_669"></span>[307:2](th237.htm#fr_670) Ménard has divided
the treatise into fifteen parts, which I have thus distinguished; the
numbering of the chapters are those usually found.

<span id="fn_670"></span>[307:3](th237.htm#fr_671) Or, a sermon about
the Gods.

<span id="fn_671"></span>[308:1](th237.htm#fr_672) *Intelligens.*

<span id="fn_672"></span>[308:2](th237.htm#fr_673) Reason or sermon or
*logos*; *cf.* iii. and below: “For that the Reason,” etc.

<span id="fn_673"></span>[308:3](th237.htm#fr_674) But ii. 1, referring
again to this idea, has the reading: “‘All’ is ‘One.’” *Cf. C. H.*, xvi.
3; and also xx. 2 below.

<span id="fn_674"></span>[308:4](th237.htm#fr_675) This, as we shall see
later on, is Tat. See xxxii. below.

<span id="fn_675"></span>[308:5](th237.htm#fr_676) Lit. to his name.

<span id="fn_676"></span>[309:1](th237.htm#fr_677) *Cupido*; without
doubt Erōs in the lost original; *cf.* xxi. 1 below; and Frag. xviii.

<span id="fn_677"></span>[309:2](th237.htm#fr_678) This, as we have
already noted, is a variant of the reading in i., where we find “*omnia
unius esse*” (“all” is of “one”) and not “*omnia unum esse*” (“all” is
“one”).

<span id="fn_678"></span>[310:1](th237.htm#fr_679) *Sc.* the Cosmos.

<span id="fn_679"></span>[310:2](th237.htm#fr_680) Presumably from some
previous sermon.

<span id="fn_680"></span>[310:3](th237.htm#fr_681) That is, Cosmos.

<span id="fn_681"></span>[310:4](th237.htm#fr_682) The Latin of this
paragraph is very obscure.

<span id="fn_682"></span>[311:1](th237.htm#fr_683) *Cf.* *C. H.*, xi.
(xii.) 15: “Give thou thyself to Me, My Hermes, for a little while.”

<span id="fn_683"></span>[311:2](th237.htm#fr_684) *Ratio*—that is,
*Logos.*

<span id="fn_684"></span>[311:3](th237.htm#fr_685) Lit. divine—that is,
by a concentration like to the singleness of the Godhead.

<span id="fn_685"></span>[311:4](th237.htm#fr_686) That is, “This Reason
is.”

<span id="fn_686"></span>[311:5](th237.htm#fr_687) “*Quo efficitur ut
intentionem nostram . . . celeri velocitate praetereat.*” Compare with
this the description of the instruction of the Therapeuts in Philo’s
famous tractate, *De Vita Contemplativa*, 901 P., 483 M.—Conybeare’s
text, p. 117 (Oxford; 1895): “For when in giving an interpretation, one
continues to speak rapidly without pausing for breath, the mind of the
hearers is left behind, unable to keep up the pace”—ὁ τῶν ἀκροωμένων
νοῦς συνομαρτεῖν ἀδυντῶν ὑστερίζει.
