### THE HYMN OF THE ROBE OF GLORY.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

When I was a little child.  
And dwelling in my kingdom, in my Father's house,  
And in the wealth and the glories  
Of my nurturers had my pleasure,  
From the East, <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md) our home,  
My parents, having equipped me, sent me forth.  
And of the wealth of our treasury  <span id="fr_1"></span>[2](#fn_1.md)  
They had tied up for me a load.  
Large it was, yet light,  
So that I might bear it unaided--  
Gold of . . .  <span id="fr_2"></span>[3](#fn_2.md)  
And silver of Gazzak the great,  
And rubies of India,  
And agate (?) from the land of Kushān (?),  
And they girded me with adamant  <span id="fr_3"></span>[4](#fn_3.md)  
Which can crush iron.  
And they took off from me the bright robe,

</div>

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Which in their love they had wrought for me,  
And my purple toga,  
Which was measured (and) woven to my stature.  
And they made compact with me,  
And wrote it in my heart that it should not be forgotten:  
"If thou goest down into Egypt, <span id="fr_4"></span>[1](#fn_4.md)  
And bringest the one pearl, <span id="fr_5"></span>[2](#fn_5.md)  
Which is in the midst of the sea <span id="fr_6"></span>[3](#fn_6.md)  
Hard by the loud-breathing serpent, <span id="fr_7"></span>[4](#fn_7.md)  
(Then) shalt thou put on thy bright robe  
And thy toga, <span id="fr_8"></span>[5](#fn_8.md) which is laid over it,  
And with thy Brother, <span id="fr_9"></span>[6](#fn_9.md) our next in
rank, <span id="fr_10"></span>[7](#fn_10.md)  
Thou shalt be heir in our kingdom."  
I quitted the East (and) went down,  
There being with me two messengers, <span
id="fr_11"></span>[8](#fn_11.md)  
For the way was dangerous and difficult,  
And I was young to tread it.  
I passed the borders of Maishān,  
The meeting place of the merchants of the East,  
And I reached the land of Babel,  
And I entered the walls of . . .  <span id="fr_12"></span>[9](#fn_12.md)

</div>

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

I went down into Egypt,  
And my companions parted from me.  
I betook me straight to the serpent,  
Hard by his dwelling I abode,  
(Waiting) till he could slumber and sleep, <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)  
And I could take my pearl from him.  
And when I was single and alone,  
A stranger to those with whom I dwelt,  
One of my race, a free-born man,  
From among the Easterns, I beheld there--  
A youth fair and well-favoured.  
. . . . \*       \*       \*       \*       \*  
\*       \*       \*       \*       \*       \*  
\*       \*  and he came and attached himself to me.  
And I made him my intimate,  
A comrade with whom I shared my merchandise.  
I warned him against the Egyptians  
And against consorting with the unclean;  
And I put on a garb like theirs,  
Lest they should insult (?) me because I had come from afar,  
To take away the pearl,  
And (lest) they should arouse the serpent against me.  
But in some way or other  
They perceived that I was not their countryman;  
So they dealt with me treacherously.  
Moreover they gave me their food to eat.  
I forgot that I was a son of kings,  
And I served their king;

</div>

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

And I forgot the pearl,  
For which my parents had sent me,  
And by reason of the burden of their . . .  
I lay in a deep sleep. <span id="fr_14"></span>[1](#fn_14.md)  
But all those things that befell me,  
My parents perceived and were grieved for me;  
And a proclamation was made in our kingdom,  
That all should speed to our gate,  
King and princes of Parthia  
And all the nobles of the East.  
So they wove a plan on my behalf,  
That I might not be left in Egypt,  
And they wrote to me a letter,  
And every noble signed his name <span id="fr_15"></span>[2](#fn_15.md)
thereto:  
"From thy Father, the King of kings,  
And thy Mother, the Mistress of the East,  
And from thy Brother, our next in rank,  
To thee our son, who art in Egypt, greeting!  
Up and arise from thy sleep,  
And listen to the words of our letter!

</div>

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Call to mind that thou art a son of kings!  
See the slavery--whom thou servest!  
Remember the pearl  
For which thou didst speed to Egypt!  
Think of thy bright robe,  
And remember thy glorious toga,  
Which thou shalt put on as thine adornment,  
When thy name hath been read out in the list of the valiant,  
And with thy Brother, our \[? next in rank\],  
Thou shalt be \[? king\] in our kingdom."  
And my letter (was) a letter  
Which the King sealed with his right hand,  
(To keep it) from the wicked ones, the children of Babel,  
And from the savage demons of . . . <span
id="fr_16"></span>[1](#fn_16.md)  
It flew in the likeness of an eagle,  
The king of all birds;  <span id="fr_17"></span>[2](#fn_17.md)  
It flew and alighted beside me,  
And became all speech.  
At its voice and the sound of its rustling,  
I started and arose from my sleep.  
I took it up and kissed it,  
And loosed its seal (?), (and) read;  
And according to what was traced on my heart  
Were the words of my letter written.  
I remembered that I was a son of kings,  
And my free soul longed for its natural state.  
I remembered the pearl,

</div>

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

For which I had been sent to Egypt,  
And I began to charm him,  
The terrible loud-breathing serpent.  
I hushed him to sleep and lulled him to slumber;  
For my Father's name I named over him,  
And the name of our next in rank,  
And of my Mother, the Queen of the East;  <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)  
And I snatched away the pearl,  
And turned to go back to my Father's house.  
And their filthy and unclean garb  
I stripped off, and left it in their country,  <span
id="fr_19"></span>[2](#fn_19.md)  
And I took my way straight to come  
To the light of our home, the East.  
And my letter, my awakener,  
I found before me on the road,  
And as with its voice it had awakened me,  
(So) too with its light it was leading me  
Shone before me with its form,  
And with its voice and its guidance,  
It also encouraged me to speed,  
And with his (?) love was drawing me on.  
I went forth, passed by . . .  
I left Babel on my left hand,  <span id="fr_20"></span>[3](#fn_20.md)  
And reached Maishān the great,

</div>

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

The haven of the merchants,  
That sitteth on the shore of the sea.  
\*      \*      \*      \*      \*      \*  
And my bright robe, which I had stripped off,  
And the toga wherein it was wrapped,  
From the heights of Hyrcania (?)  
My parents sent thither,  
By the hand of their treasurers,  
Who in their faithfulness could be trusted therewith.  
And because I remembered not its fashion  
For in my childhood I had left it in my Father's house  
On a sudden as I faced it,  
The garment seemed to me like a mirror of myself.  <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)  
I saw it all in my whole self,  
Moreover I faced my whole self in (facing) it.  
For we were two in distinction,  
And yet again one in one likeness.  
And the treasurers also,  
Who brought it to me, I saw in like manner,  
That they were twain (yet) one likeness.  <span
id="fr_22"></span>[2](#fn_22.md)  
For one kingly sign was graven on them,  
Of his hands that restored to me (?)  
My treasure and my wealth by means of them.  
My bright embroidered robe,

</div>

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

Which . . . . with glorious colours;  
With gold and with beryls,  
And rubies and agates (?)  
And sardonyxes varied in colour,  
It also was made ready in its home on high (?)  
And with stones of adamant  
All its seams were fastened;  
And the image of the King of kings was depicted in full all over it,  
And like the sapphire stone also were its manifold hues.  
Again I saw that all over it  
The motions of knowledge  <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) were
stirring  
And as if to speak  
I saw it also making itself ready.  
I heard the sound of its tones,  
Which it uttered to those who brought it down(?)  
Saying, "I . . . . . . . ."  <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md)  
Whom they reared for him (?) in the presence of my fathers,  
And I also perceived in myself  
That my stature was growing according to his labours.  <span
id="fr_25"></span>[3](#fn_25.md)  
And in its kingly motions  
It was spreading itself out towards me,  <span
id="fr_26"></span>[4](#fn_26.md)  
And in the hands of its givers

</div>

<span id="page_414">p. 414</span>

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

It hastened that I might take it.  
And me too my love urged on  
That I should run to meet it and receive it;  
And I stretched forth and received it,  
With the beauty of its colours I adorned myself  
And my toga of brilliant colours  
I cast around me, in its whole breadth.  
I clothed myself therewith, and ascended  
To the gate of salutation and homage;  
I bowed my head, and did homage  
To the Majesty  <span id="fr_27"></span>[1](#fn_27.md) of my Father who had
sent it to me,  
For I had done his commandments,  
And he too had done what he promised,  
And at the gate of his princes  
I mingled with his nobles;  
For he rejoiced in me and received me,  
And I was with him in his kingdom.  
And with the voice . . .  
All his servants glorify him.  
And he promised that also to the gate  
Of the King of kings I should speed with him,  
And bringing my gift and my pearl  
I should appear with him before our King.

Well may Professor Bevan call this glorious hymn a "master-piece of
religious poetry"; it is not only magnificent as poetry, but priceless
as a record of occult fact. What then have we not lost by the barbarous
destruction of the Hymns of Bardaisan?

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[406:1](fff58.htm#fr_0.md) Either the Plērōma or
Ogdoad, the spiritual realms. The following notes are all mine.

<span id="fn_1"></span>[406:2](fff58.htm#fr_1.md) A Gnostic technical term.

<span id="fn_2"></span>[406:3](fff58.htm#fr_2) Beth-‘Ellāyē (Wright.md). It
is highly probable that all the names of countries and towns, some of
which Bevan has, omitted as too doubtful, are substitutes for states or
regions of the higher planes; the identification of some of them has
entirely baffled scholars, and the identification of the rest is mostly
unsatisfactory. No doubt Bardaisan, or his son Harmonius, or whatever
Bardesanist wrote the poem, was familiar with the great caravan route
from India to Egypt, and used this knowledge as a substructure, but the
whole is allegorical. (Since writing this note some excellent work of
interpretation on these lines has been done by German scholars. See
Bibliography).

<span id="fn_3"></span>[406:4](fff58.htm#fr_3.md) A symbol, presumably, for
the mind-body, or vesture.

<span id="fn_4"></span>[407:1](fff58.htm#fr_4.md) The body, a technical
term common to many Gnostic schools.

<span id="fn_5"></span>[407:2](fff58.htm#fr_5.md) The Gnosis.

<span id="fn_6"></span>[407:3](fff58.htm#fr_6.md) Of matter, gross and
subtle.

<span id="fn_7"></span>[407:4](fff58.htm#fr_7.md) Perhaps the elemental or
animal essence in matter.

<span id="fn_8"></span>[407:5](fff58.htm#fr_8.md) Two of the higher
vestures of the Self, of which there were three.

<span id="fn_9"></span>[407:6](fff58.htm#fr_9.md) The higher ego
presumably.

<span id="fn_10"></span>[407:7](fff58.htm#fr_10.md) Next in rank to the
Mother and Father.

<span id="fn_11"></span>[407:8](fff58.htm#fr_11.md) The powers that compel
to rebirth presumably, the representatives of the Father and Mother.

<span id="fn_12"></span>[407:9](fff58.htm#fr_12) Sarbūg (Wright.md). These
are apparently various planes or states.

<span id="fn_13"></span>[408:1](fff58.htm#fr_13.md) The serpent is
presumably the passions, which inhere in the elemental essence.

<span id="fn_14"></span>[409:1](fff58.htm#fr_14.md) Is it possible that in
the above a real piece of biography has also been woven into the poem? I
am inclined to think so. It may even be a lost page from the occult life
of Bardaisan himself. Filled with longing to penetrate the mysteries of
the Gnosis, he joins a caravan to Egypt and arrives at Alexandria. There
he meets with a friend on the same quest as himself. Bardaisan first of
all has the misfortune to fall into the hands of some sensual and
self-seeking school of magic, and forgets for a time his real quest.
Only after this bitter experience does he obtain the instruction he
sought in the initiation of the Valentinian school. Of course this
speculation is put forward with all hesitation, but it is neither an
impossibility nor an improbability.

<span id="fn_15"></span>[409:2](fff58.htm#fr_15.md) Names are powers.
Compare the beautiful "Come unto us" passages in the Song of the Powers
of the *Pistis Sophia*, *pagg*. 17 *sqq*.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[410:1](fff58.htm#fr_16) Sarbūg (Wright.md).

<span id="fn_17"></span>[410:2](fff58.htm#fr_17.md) The descent of the Holy
Ghost or spiritual consciousness.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[411:1](fff58.htm#fr_18.md) The names of Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost, that is to say, the powers of the immortal
principles in man.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[411:2](fff58.htm#fr_19.md) He left his body behind
in trance, during the initiation.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[411:3](fff58.htm#fr_20.md) He goes to "the right"
like all the initiates in the Orphic and other Mysteries.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[412:1](fff58.htm#fr_21.md) Compare the logos: "As
any of you sees himself in a mirror, so let him see Me, in
himself."--Resch, *Agrapha* (*Texte u. Untersuchungen*, Bd. v., Heft 4),
36 b, and *As Others saw Him*, p.88.

<span id="fn_22"></span>[412:2](fff58.htm#fr_22.md) The mystery of the
syzygy; compare the story of the infancy in the *Pistis Sophia*.

<span id="fn_23"></span>[413:1](fff58.htm#fr_23.md) Gnosis; the robe in the
Pistis Sophia, contains all "knowledges" (γνώσεις).

<span id="fn_24"></span>[413:2](fff58.htm#fr_24.md) "I am the active in
deeds" (Wright).

<span id="fn_25"></span>[413:3](fff58.htm#fr_25.md) The "causal" body or
vesture which constitutes the higher ego.

<span id="fn_26"></span>[413:4](fff58.htm#fr_26.md) "It poured itself
entirely over me" (Wright)--the same simile as is used several times in
the Askew Codex.

<span id="fn_27"></span>[414:1](fff58.htm#fr_27.md) 'This seems to be One
different from the rather Himself, and the subject of the third and
fourth lines from the end.
