#### ii. From a Letter.

<span class="margnote">On the Pure in Heart.</span>"One \[alone\] is
Good, whose free utterance is His manifestation through his Son; it is
by Him alone that the heart can become pure, \[and that too only\] when
every evil essence has been expelled out of it. Now its purity is
prevented by the many essences which take up their abode in it, for each
of them accomplishes its own deeds, outraging it in

<span id="page_301">p. 301</span>

divers fashions with unseemly lusts. As far as I can see, the heart
seems to receive somewhat the same treatment as an inn \[or
caravanserai\], which has holes and gaps made in its walls, and is
frequently filled with dung, men living filthily in it and taking no
care of the place  as being someone else's property. Thus it is with the
heart so long as it has no care taken of it, ever unclean and the abode
of many dæmons \[elemental essences\]. But when the Alone Good Father
path regard unto it, it is sanctified and shineth with light; and he who
possesseth such a heart, is so blessed that 'he shall see God.'"

Here we have the very same doctrine as that enunciated by Basilides and
Isidorus with regard to the "appendages" of the soul, as indeed is
pointed out by Clement. The doctrine was an exceedingly ancient one in
Egypt. In the so-called *Book of the Dead* we read, that the "heart" is
a distinct personality within the man (the "*purusha* \[or man\] in the
æther of the heart" of the Upanishads); and not only this, but the
formula referred to and its explanatory texts teach us that "it is not
the heart that sins but only its fleshly envelope." (*Cf*. Wiedemann's
*Relig. of the Ancient Egyptians*, p. 287; 1897.) Isidorus, as we have
already seen, guarded against making the "appendages" the scapegoat, and
fixed the responsibility on the "heart" proper, the "ancestral
heart"--"guardian of my fleshes"--the reincarnating entity. It is,
however, quite true that the passions are connected with the blood, and
so with the "fleshly envelope,"

or physical heart, in which the real "heart" is said to be enshrined.
