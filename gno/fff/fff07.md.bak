### GREECE.

IF we turn to the Greece of the sixth century prior <span
class="margnote">The Greece of 600 <span
class="small">B.C.</span></span> to our era, we can perceive the signs
of the birth of a new spirit in the Western world, the beginning of a
great intellectual activity; it is, so to speak, the age of puberty of
the Greek genius, new powers of thought are coming into activity, and
the old-time myths and ancient oracular wisdom are receiving new
expression in the infant science of empirical physics and the birth of
philosophy.

This activity is part and parcel of a great quickening, an outpouring of
power, which may be traced in other lands as well; it is an
intensification of the religious consciousness of the nations, and it
intensified the religious instinct of Greece in a remarkable manner. Its
most marked characteristic

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

is the application of the intellect to things religious, owing to the
accelerated development of this faculty in man.

The greatest pioneers of this activity were men whose names still live
in the temple of fame. In the far East we have Confucius and Laotze, in
India Gautama the Buddha, in Persia the last of the Zoroasters, in
Greece Pythagoras; there were others doubtless elsewhere who acted as
messengers of the Light, but our existing records are too imperfect to
permit us to trace their paths.

Can any who believe in the providence of Wisdom in human affairs, doubt
but that this was part of some great plan for man's advancement? If
there be a Providence "that shapes our ends," where can we see its hand
more clearly than in such great happenings?

But to confine ourselves to Greece; we must not suppose that Pythagoras
was without predecessors; <span class="margnote">The Precursors of
Pythagoras.</span> for though his later followers would have us think
that all philosophy flowed from him, we cannot believe in this so sudden
appearance of it, and we doubt not that Pythagoras regarded himself as
the enunciator of old truths and but one of the teachers of a line of
doctrine. He had Pherecydes and Anaximander and Thales before him in
Asia Minor, and other teachers in Egypt and Chaldæa and elsewhere.
Indeed in these early days it is almost impossible to separate
philosophy from mythology and all the ancient ideas connected with it.
If we look to the times of Thales, who is regarded as the herald of the
first elements of philosophy in the Grecian world, and

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

who lived a century earlier than Pythagoras, we find a state of affairs
somewhat as follows.

The educated and travelled of the Greeks of the time regarded Egypt as
the centre of all learning and culture and their own forbears as of no
account in such matters. The rhapsodists of the Homeric poems flattered
their vanity by singing of the prowess of their ancient heroes, but
could tell the intelligent nothing of religion; as for Hesiod and his
[theogony](errata.htm#3.md) and the rest, they could make but little of
them. He was doubtless more intelligible than the archaic fragments of
the Orphic poems which enshrined the most ancient elements of the
religious tradition of Hellas. But he fell far short of the wisdom of
Egypt. As for the Orphic fragments, they were the relics of their
barbarous ancestors, and no one believed in them but the superstitious
and ignorant.

But a nation that is to be something of itself and not a mere copier of
others must have confidence in its past traditions, and we find about
this time that there arose a growing interest in these old fragments,
which gradually led to their collection and translation into the Greek
of the period. This took place at the end of the sixth century, and the
name identified most closely with this activity to recover the fragments
of the old tradition was that of Onomacritus.

It is interesting to notice how that this was done just prior to the
period when Greece cast back the invading hosts of Xerxes from the
shores of Europe. The effort seems to have been to revive in Greece the
memory of its past by recovering the channel of its ancient inspiration,
and at the same time to

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

let her feel the strength of her peculiar genius in thinking out the old
oracular wisdom in terms of her fresh intellect, that so she might feel
courage to hurl back the invading forces of the East, and pave the way
to her future conquests of that same East in the days of Alexander.

At this period, then, we notice the rise of philosophy and the revival
of the Orphic tradition. <span class="margnote">The Orphic
Tradition.</span> But this is not all; the leaven is working within as
well as without, and we find an enormously increased activity in those
most sacred institutions of the religious life of Greece--the Mysteries.
But before we proceed to consider briefly this perhaps the most
important point of all, let us try to take a hasty retrospect along the
line of the Orphic tradition; for those who studied such matters in
later Greece more deeply than the rest, assert with one voice that the
line of their descent was from Orpheus through Pythagoras and Plato.

The Greeks known to history seem to have formed part of one of the waves
of immigration <span class="margnote">Primitive Hellas.</span> into
Europe of the great Aryan stock. Of the main wave there were doubtless
many wavelets.

If we may venture to believe that some germ of history underlies the
records of the priests of Sais communicated to Solon and preserved to us
by Plato in his *Critias* and *Timæus*; according to them, so long ago
as ten thousand years before our era, Attica was occupied by the
long-forgotten ancestors of the Hellenes. Then came the great flood when
the Atlantic Island was destroyed, and the shores of the Mediterranean
rendered

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

uninhabitable by seismic disturbances of which the great cataclysm was
but one of a number, the third it is said before the "Flood of
Deucalion." It was the time of Egypt "before the flood" of which we have
mention in the writings of Manetho.

If this be true, we can imagine how the wavelet of the conquering Aryan
race which then occupied Hellas--the overlords of the "autochthones" of
the period--was driven back, and how the country was left for long to
the occupation of these same "autochthones" whom Herodotus calls
"Pelasgi." They were to the Greeks, what the Dravidians were and are to
the Indo-Aryans, "autochthones" if you will, but with a long history of
their own if we could recover their records.

The polity of the ancient Greek inhabitants of Attica, according to the
notes of Solon, bears a striking resemblance to the polity of the
ancient Aryans in India, and doubtless their primitive religious
traditions came from a common stock.

As for the "Pelasgi," who knows their traditions, or the blendings of
races that had taken place before the remains of them could be classed
as an indiscriminate mass? We are told, that they were ruled over by
chiefs from the Atlantic Island who busily pushed its conquests to the
most distant shores of the Great Sea (the Mediterranean), and that the
ancient Hellenes disputed the lordship with this dominant race. What
enormous possibilities of cult-mixtures myth-blending, and theocrasia
have we here! It was these Atlanteans who introduced the cults of
Poseidon and Hephæstus (Vulcan), the mighty powers of the

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

sea and of subterranean fire, which had destroyed their fathers.

For the Aryan Hellenic stock there was All-father Zeus and the Goddess
of Wisdom, Pallas Athene, who was also a warrior goddess, as befitted a
warlike race. What the Greek religion was at this period, who shall say?
But it is not so wild a guess to suppose that it may have been of a
bardic nature--hymn-bursts suited to warriors, of which we have relics
in the legends of Druid and Bard and in all those ancient traditions of
the Celt, in the mythology of the Teuton and Norseman, and even in the
legend-lore preserved by the ancient Slavs.

We may imagine how in these early years, as the strong current of the
Aryan flood swept them onward, <span class="margnote">The wavelets of
Aryan Immigration.</span> wavelet overlapped wavelet, horde fought with
horde, and that the smiling land of Hellas was a rich prize for the
strongest. We may imagine how when the effects of the "floods" had
subsided and in course of many many years seismic disturbances had
lessened, the Hellenic stock reoccupied the ground again, not only in
Greece itself but also on the shores of Asia Minor. But how many
wavelets of immigration flowed in until Homeric times who shall say?
Perhaps some day it may be possible to sift out from the myths some
deposit of history, and perceive how a Cecrops, an Erectheus, and an Ion
did not follow each other in rapid succession, but were great leaders
who established kingdoms separated by long periods of time.

May it not further be that with these conquering kings came bards to
advise and encourage, and supply

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

what of religion was thought good for them? May we not seek for the
prototype of Orpheus here, and to one of the later wavelets trace the
archaic fragments of the most ancient religious poems? We may almost see
some religious pomp of the time passing down the Sacred Way to Eleusis,
ever the most sacred spot in Greece, with some Orpheus of the time
rousing the warriors to enthusiasm by his songs, harp in hand, with his
grey locks streaming in the breeze, while the regular march of the
warriors kept time to the strain, and emphasized it by the rhythmic
clashing of their shields.

It would be vain to look for any intellectual <span class="margnote">The
Orphic Line.</span> presentation of religion along this line; whatever
it was, it must have been inspirational, prophetical, and oracular; and
indeed this is the peculiar characteristic of the Orphic tradition.

But even in these early days was the tradition a pure one? Scarcely; the
various races must have fought their way through other races, and
settled for a time among them before they reached Hellas, and the main
line of their march seems to have been round the south shores of the
Black Sea and through Thrace.

In Thrace they would meet with the cult of Dionysus and absorb some of
its traditions; not that Thrace was the home of this cult, its origins
appear to reach eastwards and back into time--a widespreading cultus
with its roots in the soil of an archaic Semitism, the traces of which
are hard to discover in the obscure and fragmentary records that we now
possess. Moreover there is some mixture

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

of the Chaldean tradition in the Orphic line, but whether it existed at
this period or was superadded later is hard to say.

What the precise religion of the earlier of these successive wavelets
was like, when they had settled in the rich lands of Greece, and became
more civilized, we can no longer say, for we have no records, but
doubtless they were watched over and sufficient inspiration given them
for their needs.

If we now turn to the Greece of Homer, and try to find traces of
Orpheus, we are doomed to disappointment; <span class="margnote">The
Greece of Homer.</span> but this is not altogether inexplicable. Homer
sings of a Greece that seems to have entirely forgotten its ancient
bards, of heroes who had left their religion at home, as it were. The
yellow-haired Greeks who won the supremacy subsequent to Ion's time,
were a stock that paid little attention to religion; they give one the
impression of being some sort of Viking warriors who cared little for
the agricultural pursuits in which their predecessors were engaged, if
we can judge from the tradition preserved by Hesiod. We see a number of
independent chieftains occupying the many vales of Greece, whose idea of
providing for an increasing population is by foray and conquest.

There may have been a fickle Helen and a too gallant Paris who violated
the hospitality of his hosts, but the Trojan War was more probably a
foray of these warriors to gain new lands,--a foray not against an alien
race, but against those of their own general kin; for the Trojans were
Greeks, somewhat orientalised in their customs perhaps, by settlement in

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

contact with the nations of Asia, but for all that Greeks,--dark-haired
Greeks, with a cult like the cult of the fair-haired ones, and with
perchance for the most part as little understanding concerning it.

It is, however, just this absence of the priest, or the very subordinate
position he holds, which is an indication of the germ of that
independence of thought which is the marked characteristic of the Greek
mind that was subsequently developed, and of which the Greece of history
was the special and carefully watched depository, that it might evolve
for the world-purpose for which it was destined. It was good for men to
look the gods manfully in the face and battle with them if need be.

"Homer" was the bard of these Viking heroes; but the bard of their
predecessors (who were equally Greeks) of the Hellenic stock which they
had dominated, was "Orpheus." The descendants of the heroes of Troy
naturally looked to "Homer" as the singer of the deeds of *their*
forefathers, and as the recorder of their customs and cult; they were
too proud to listen to "Orpheus" and the old "theologers" who had been
the bards of the conquered; so the old songs and sagas of this bardic
line, the lays and legends of this older Greece, were left to the people
and to consequent neglect and lack of understanding.

Such was the state of affairs when philosophy <span
class="margnote">"Orpheus" returns to Greece.</span> arose in the
seventh century; it was then found by the few that Homer could not
suffice for the religious needs of thinking men; there was nothing in
Homer to compare with the religious traditions of Egypt and Chaldæa; the
Greeks apparently had nothing of

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

religion, their ancestors were barbarians. Then it occurred to some to
collect and compare the ancient oracles and religious myths of the
people--the fragments of the Orphic songs--and therein they found proofs
of an ancient Greek tradition of things unseen that could be favourably
compared with much that Egypt and Chaldæa could tell them. Greece had a
religious tradition; their forebears were not barbarous.

Those who busied themselves with such matters at this critical period,
we may believe, were not left without guidance; and poets and thinkers
were helped as they could receive it. The fragments of this activity in
Orphic poesy which have come down to us, show signs of this inspiration;
we do not refer to the late "Orphic Hymns," some eighty in number, which
may be read in English in Taylor's translation, but to the ancient
fragments scattered in the works of classical and patristic writers.

Many of these were based on the archaic fragments of the pre-Homeric
times, and looked back to this archaic tradition as their foundation.
But the mystic and mythological setting of these poems, their
enthusiastic and prophetic character, though all-sufficient for many,
were not suited to the nascent intellectuality of Greece which was
asserting itself with such vigour. Therefore the greatest leaders of
that thought sought means to clothe the ideas which were enshrined in
myth and poesy, in modes more suitable to the intellectuals of the time;
and we have the philosophy of a Pythagoras and subsequently of a Plato.

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

But alongside of the public cults and popular traditions there existed
an inner organism of religion <span class="margnote">The
Mysteries.</span> and channels of secret traditions concealed within the
Mystery-institutions. If it is difficult to form any precise notion of
the evolution of popular religious ideas in Greece, much more difficult
is it to trace the various lines of the Mystery-traditions, which were
regarded with the greatest possible reverence and guarded with the
greatest possible secrecy, the slightest violation of the oath being
punishable by death.

The idea that underlay the Mystery-tradition in Greece was similar to
that which underlay all similar institutions in antiquity, and it is
difficult to find any cult of importance without this inner side. In
these institutions, in the inner shrines of the temple, were to be found
the means of a more intimate participation in the cult and instruction
in the dogmas.

The institution of the Mysteries is the most interesting phenomenon in
the study of religion. The idea of antiquity was that there was
something to be *known* in religion, secrets or mysteries into which it
was possible to be initiated; that there was a gradual process of
unfolding in things religious; in fine, that there was a science of the
soul, a knowledge of things unseen.

A persistent tradition in connection with all the great
Mystery-institutions was that their several founders were the
introducers of all the arts of civilization; they were either themselves
gods or were instructed in them by the gods

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

in brief, that they were men of far greater knowledge than any who had
come after; they were the teachers of infant races. And not only did
they teach them the arts, but they instructed them in the nature of the
gods, of the human soul, and the unseen world, and set forth how the
world came into existence and much else.

We find the ancient world honey-combed with these institutions. They
were of all sorts and <span class="margnote">Their Corruption.</span>
kinds, from the purest and most noble down to the most degraded; in them
we find the best and worst of the religion and superstition of humanity.
Nor should we be surprised at this, for when human nature is
intensified, not only is the better in it stimulated but also the worse
in it finds greater scope.

When knowledge is given power is acquired, and it depends on the
recipients whether or no they use it for good or evil. The teachers of
humanity have ever been opposed by the innate forces of selfishness, for
evolution is slow, and mankind wayward; moreover, men cannot be forced,
they must come of their own free-will, "for love is the fulfilling of
the law"; and so again though "many are the 'called,' few are the
'chosen.'"

It is said that these earliest teachers of humanity who founded the
Mystery-institutions as the most <span class="margnote">The Reason of
it.</span> efficient means of giving infant humanity instruction in
higher things, were souls belonging to a more highly developed humanity
than our own. The men of our infant humanity were children with minds
but little developed, and only capable of

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

understanding what they distinctly saw and felt. In the earliest times,
according to this view, the Mysteries were conducted by those who had a
knowledge of nature-powers which was the acquisition of a prior
perfected humanity not necessarily earth-born, and the wonders shown
therein such that none of our humanity could of themselves produce. As
time went on and our humanity more and more developed the faculty of
reason, and were thought strong enough to stand on their own feet, the
teachers gradually withdrew, and the Mysteries were committed to the
care of the most advanced pupils of this humanity, who had finally to
substitute symbols and devices, dramas and scenic representations, of
what had previously been revealed by higher means.

Then it was that corruption crept in, and man was left to win his own
[divinity](errata.htm#4.md) by self-conquest and persistent struggling
against the lower elements in his nature. The teachers remained unseen,
ever ready to help, but no longer moving visibly among men, to compel
their reverence and worship. So runs the tradition.

If, as we have seen, the origin and evolution <span class="margnote">The
Various Traditions.</span> of the popular cults of Greece are difficult
to trace, much more difficult are the beginnings and development of the
Greek Mystery-cultus. The main characteristic of the Mysteries was the
profound secrecy in which their traditions were kept; we therefore have
no adequate materials upon which to work, and have to rely mainly on
hints and veiled allusions. This much, however, is

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

certain, that the Mystery-side of religion was the initiation into its
higher cult and doctrine; the highest praise is bestowed upon the
Mysteries by the greatest thinkers among the Greeks, who tell us that
they purified the nature, and not only made men live better lives here
on earth but enabled them to depart from life with brighter hopes of the
future.

What the primitive Mystery-cultus traditions along the lines of Orphic,
Dionysiac, and Eleusinian descent may have been, it is unnecessary to
speculate in this rough outline sketch; but if we come down to the days
of Plato we find existing Mystery-institutions which may be roughly
characterised as political, private, and philosophic.

The political Mysteries--that is to say the State-Mysteries--were the
famous Eleusinia, with their <span class="margnote">The Political
Mysteries.</span> gorgeous external pageants and their splendid inner
rites. At this period almost every respectable citizen of Athens was
initiated, and we can easily see that the tests could not have been very
stringent, when so many were admitted every year. In fact, these
State-Mysteries, though providing for a grade or several grades of
advancement along the path of right living and of right comprehension of
life, had become somewhat perfunctory, as all departments of a
State-religion are bound to become in time.

Alongside of the Eleusinia there existed certain private Mysteries, not
recognised by the State, the <span class="margnote">The Private
Mysteries.</span> number of which subsequently increased enormously, so
that almost every variety of Oriental Mystery-cultus found its adherents
in Greece, as may be seen

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

from a study of the religious associations among the Greeks known as
Thiasi, Erani, and Orgeones; among private communities and societies of
this kind there were to be found naturally many undesirable elements,
but at the same time they satisfied the needs of many who could derive
no spiritual nourishment from the State-religion.

Among these private foundations were communities <span
class="margnote">The Orphic Communities.</span> of rigid ascetics, men
and women, who gave themselves entirely to holy living; such people were
said to live the "Orphic life" and were generally known as Orphics. Of
course there were charlatans who parodied them and pretended to their
purity and knowledge, but we are at present following the indications of
those whose conduct squared with their profession.

These Orphic communities appear to have been the refuges of those who
yearned after the religious life, and among them were the Pythagorean
schools. Pythagoras did not establish something entirely new in Greece
when he founded his famous school at Crotona; he developed something
already existing, and when his original school was broken up and its
members had to flee they sought refuge among the Orphics. The
Pythagorean schools disappear into the Orphic communities.

It is in the Pythagorean tradition that we see the signs of what I have
called the philosophic Mysteries; it is, therefore, in the best of the
Orphic and Pythagorean traditions that we have to find the indications
of the nature of the real Mysteries, and not in the political Eleusinia

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

or in the disorderly elements of the Oriental cults.

In fact the Orphics did much to improve the Eleusinia and supported them
as a most necessary <span class="margnote">The Philosophic
Mysteries.</span> means for educating the ordinary man towards a
comprehension of the higher life. It stands to reason, however, that the
Mysteries which satisfied the aspirations of Orphics and Pythagoreans
were somewhat higher than the State-Mysteries of the ordinary citizen.
These Pythagoreans were famous throughout antiquity for the purity of
their lives and the loftiness of their aims, and the Mysteries they
regarded with such profound reverence must have been something beyond
the Eleusinia, something to which the Eleusinia were but one of the
outer approaches.

We have then to seek for the innermost religious life of Greece in this
direction, and to remember <span class="margnote">Pythagoras and
Plato.</span> that the inner experiences of this life were kept a
profound secret and not paraded on the housetops. Pythagoras is said to
have been initiated into the Egyptian, Chaldæan, Orphic, and Eleusinian
Mysteries; at the same time he was one of the chief founders of Greek
philosophy. His philosophy however, was not a thing of itself, but the
application of his intellect--especially of his mathematical genius--to
the best in these Mystery-traditions; he saw that it was necessary to
attempt to lead the rapidly evolving intellectuality of Greece along its
own lines to the contemplation of the inner nature of things; otherwise
in the joy of its freedom it would get entirely out of hand and reject
the truths of the ancient wisdom.

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

Plato continued this task, though on somewhat different lines; he worked
more in the world than Pythagoras, and his main effort was to clear the
ground from misconceptions, so that the intellect might be purified and
brought into a fit state to contemplate the things-that-are. He spent
his life in this task, building up not so much a system of knowledge, as
clearing the way so that the great truths of the Gnosis of
things-that-are, as Pythagoras termed it, might become apparent of
themselves.

It is a mistake to suppose that Plato formulated a distinctly new system
of philosophy; his main conceptions are part and parcel of the old
wisdom handed down by the seers of the Mysteries; but he does not
formulate them so much as clear the ground by his
[dialectical](errata.htm#5.md) method, so that the mind may be brought into
a fit state to receive them.

Therefore are the conclusions of his dialogues nearly always negative,
and only at the end of his long life, probably against his better
judgment and in response to the importunity of his pupils, does he set
forth a positive document in the *Timæus*, composed of scraps from the
unpublished writings of Pythagoreans and others.

Unfortunately most of those who immediately followed him, imagined that
his dialectical method was an end in itself, and so instead of living
the life of philosophy and seeking the clear vision of true initiation,
they degenerated into empty argument and ended in negation.

Aristotle followed with his admirable method

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

of analysis and exact observation of phenomena, and as he treated of the
without rather than of <span class="margnote">Aristotle and
Scepticism.</span> he within he was from one point of view better
understood than Plato, but from another more misunderstood, in that his
method also was taken as an end in itself rather than as a means simply.
And so we come to the three centuries prior to the present era, when the
intellectual life of Greece was centred at Alexandria.

It was a far more extended Greece than the Hellas of Plato; it was a
Greece whose physical prowess had conquered the Orient, and which
boasted itself that its intellectual vigour would conquer the world.
Everywhere it matched its vigorous intellect against the ancient East,
and for a time imagined that victory was with it.

Its independence of thought had given rise to innumerable schools
warring with each other, and the spectacle it offers us is very similar
to the spectacle of modern Europe during the last three hundred years.

We see there at work, though on a smaller scale--in germ as it were--the
same intellectual activity which has [characterized](errata.htm#6.md) the
rise of the modern scientific method, and with it the same breaking down
of old views, the same unrest, the same spirit of scepticism.

If we look to the surface of things merely, we might almost say that
Greece had entirely forgotten the Mystery-tradition and gloried solely
in the unaided strength of her intellect. But if we look deeper we shall
find that this is not the case. In

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

the days of Plato the Orient and Egypt were brought to Greece so to
speak, whereas later on Greece went to Egypt and the East.

Now the ancient wisdom had its home in Egypt <span class="margnote">East
and West.</span> and Chaldæa and the Orient generally, so that though
the Orphic and Pythagorean communities of Plato's time imported into
Greece a modified Orientalism which they adapted to the Greek genius
along the lines of their own ancient wisdom-tradition, when the Greeks
in their thousands went forth into the East, those of them who were
prepared by contact with these schools, came into closer intimacy with
the ancient wisdom of the East, and drank it in readily.

As for the generality, just as the introduction of Orientalism into
Greece among the people brought with it abuses and enthusiastic rites of
an undesirable character, while at the same time it intensified the
religious life and gave greater satisfaction to the religious emotions,
so the Greek conquest of the Orient spread abroad a spirit of scepticism
and unbelief, while sharpening the intellectual faculties.

But all this was a very gradual process, and the more scepticism
increased, the intenser became the desire of numbers to withdraw from
the warring clash of opinions, and seek refuge in the contemplative life
that offered them knowledge. Oriental thinkers and mystics became
Hellenized along the lines of Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy, and
Greek philosophers became Orientalized by contact with members of the
many communities that honeycombed not only Egypt and the rest of the

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "barbarian"
nations subject to Greece, but also Asia Minor and even Hellas herself.
How numerous were these communities in the first century may be seen
from a study of the writings of Philo Judæus and the life of Apollonius
of Tyana, and from the picture of mystic Greece which may be recovered
from the ethical and theosophical essays of Plutarch, and also from the
many recently discovered inscriptions relating to the innumerable
Religious Associations in Greece.

When the Greek kingdoms of the Successors of Alexander were in their
turn humbled beneath <span class="margnote">Rome.</span> the conquering
power of Rome, the organizing Italic genius policed the world, somewhat
in a similar way to the fashion of the present British occupation of
India. The legal mind and practical genius of Rome was never really at
home in the metaphysical subtleties of Greek philosophy, or the
mysticism of the East. In literature and art she could only copy Greece;
in philosophy she sought for a rule of conduct rather than a system of
knowledge, and so we find her, in the persons of her best men, the
follower of Stoic naturalism, which summed up its code of ethics in the
ideal of "*honestas*."

Nevertheless Rome could no more than Greece avoid religious contact with
the East, and we <span class="margnote">The Mysteries of Mithras.</span>
find her passing through the same experiences as Greece, though in much
more modified form. The chief point of contact among the many religions
of the Roman Empire was in the common worship of the Sun, and the inner
core of this most popular cult was, from about <span
class="small">B.C.</span> 70

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

onwards, to be found in the Mysteries of Mithras.

"The worship of Mithras, or of the sun-god, was the most popular of
heathen cults, and the principal antagonist of the truth during the
first four centuries of our period." Such is the statement of one who
looks at it from the point of view of a Christian ecclesiastic, and
indeed the Church Fathers from the time of Justin Martyr onward have
declared that the Devil, in the Mysteries of Mithras, had plagiarized
their most sacred rites by anticipation.

The Mithriac Mysteries represented the esoteric side of a great
international religious movement, which the uniting together of many
peoples into the Græco-Roman world had made possible, and which resulted
from the contact of Greece and Rome with the thought of the East.

National and local cults were gradually influenced by the form of
symbolism employed by the modified Chaldæo-Persian tradition; the
worship of the Spiritual Sun, the Logos, with the natural symbol of the
glorious orb of day, which was common in one form or other to all great
cults, and the rest of the solar symbolism, gradually permeated the
popular indigenous forms of religion. In course of time, Mithra, the
visible sun for the ignorant, the Spiritual Sun, the Mediator between
the Light and Darkness, as Plutarch tells us, for the instructed, caused
