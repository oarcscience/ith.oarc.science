### NOTES ON THE CONTENTS OF THE BRUCE AND ASKEW CODICES.

THE attentive reader will have already perceived that the contents of
the *Pistis Sophia* treatise, of the <span class="margnote">The Kinship
of the Titled Treatises.</span> *Extracts from The Books of the
Saviour*, and of the fragments given under the title *The Book of the
Great Logos according to the Mystery*, are closely related together;
they indubitably belong to the same school. The result of the researches
of Schmidt into this very interesting question may be most clearly seen
in his reply to Preuschen's criticism on his work, a copy of which was
kindly sent me by Schmidt himself. (See *Zeitschrift für
wissenschaftliche Theologie*, Pt. iv., 1894.) Schmidt here sums up his
position, bringing together the results of his researches.

If I might myself venture a general opinion on so difficult and abstruse
a subject, I would say that all the three compilations we are
considering, belong not only to the same school, but also to one and the
same effort at syntheticizing and reformulation. It is evident that each
of them contains older materials, and it is almost certain that the
writer of the *Pistis Sophia* was acquainted with the material of the
Extracts of the Ieou and Baptism expositions. The far more difficult
question is the relationship of the Extracts to *The Book of the Great
Logos*, and the most difficult question of all is the school and authors
to which to assign them.

<span id="page_568">p. 568</span>

<span class="margnote">Date.</span>So far there is nothing absolutely
proved as to date, except that the compilers of these documents had
access to the same Sayings-material as the compilers of the Canonical
Gospels; the *terminus a quo* may, therefore, be placed somewhere about
the end of the first quarter of the second century. But the curious
phrase used in introducing a quotation from the Pauline Letters ("Thou
didst say unto us aforetime by the mouth of Paul our brother") shows
such complete indifference to the Canonical *Acts* account, that it
argues an early date. Because of the complex nature of the contents,
however, they have been ascribed by some to the third century; but this
does not seem to me to be sufficient reason for so late a date, when we
consider the complex nature of the new-found pre-Irenæic Gnostic work,
and the exceedingly abstruse character of the contents of the superior
untitled MS. of the Codex Brucianus, the contents of which Schmidt
places well in the second century.

<span class="margnote">Authorship.</span>Some of the materials are
undoubtedly very old indeed, but it is the compilation-problem that at
present engages us. I think that all three were compiled by the same
group, or even by the same writer (though the latter will seem a very
rash hypothesis to some). It is evident that the treatises pertain to
the most intimate centre of Gnosticism, familiar with the inmost
traditions, the most secret documents, and the practical inner
experiences of the school. It matters not whether you call this stream
of the Gnosis, "Ophite," "Barbēlō-Gnostic," "Gnostic," or "Valentinian";
such names

<span id="page_569">p. 569</span>

could have meant little for the compiler or compilers of these
documents.

Now it is evident that the *Extracts* and part of *The Book of the Great
Logos* are both based on the same original. It is true that the text of
the Baptism extract of the Askew Codex differs, slightly from the text
of the same rite in the Bruce Codex, but they are probably translated by
different hands, and both translators used great freedom in their
version, and were often puzzled how to put the Greek into Coptic, as is
evident in many passages.

A certain reformulation of the Gnosis is, then, referred to as *The
Books of the Saviour* or<span class="margnote">The Titles.</span> *The
Book of the Great Logos;* perhaps the original Greek document or
documents had no title, and it was the copiers, or the Coptic
translators and scribes, who added these titles. The *Pistis Sophia*
treatise, however, refers to a work called *The Two Books of Ieou*, and
further adds that they were given by the Saviour to Enoch and preserved
from the Flood.

Now it seems to me that if these references in the *Pistis* are not
interpolations, The *Two Books of Ieou* <span class="margnote">The Books
of Ieou.</span> cannot be identical with the common document in the
*Extracts* and *The Book of the Great Logos*, but that this document was
an overworking and reformulation of these two Books. *The Books of Ieou*
belonged presumably to some ancient tradition, probably Egyptian,
containing a host of symbols and seals, pass-words and mystery-names,
and much else which were referred to what Manetho calls "the Egypt
before

<span id="page_570">p. 570</span>

the Flood" (the Egypt of the "First Hermes" or Agathodæmon), the
traditions of which were equated with the Semitic traditions by Jewish
and Christian Gnostic circles. I have dealt with this subject at length
in my work on the Trismegistic literature.

<span class="margnote">The Probable Author.</span>I believe, then, that
the common document in the *Extracts* and *The Book of the Great Logos*
was not the actual *Books of Ieou* referred to in the *Pistis Sophia*,
but that it contained the substance of the Ieou Books, worked up by a
Gnostic writer into a new form. I further suggest that this writer was
the same as the author of the *Pistis Sophia* treatise, who reformulated
the *Books of Ieou* in the light of the Gnosis of the Living Master.
These things, however, do not seem to have been done in order; they were
more probably the various attempts at some consistent synthesis of the
old wisdom, attempts which in all probability did not satisfy the
writer. They were presumably the results of a long life of labour, and
may have been several times revised or recast. Who can say in our
present ignorance of all historical data?

And if it be asked: Who could have made such <span class="margnote">The
Obscurity of the Subject.</span>an attempt? I can find no answer, on
reviewing the whole list of known Gnostic writers, than that Valentinus
alone could in any way have attempted it. But that this can ever be
proved beyond cavil I have no hope, for we know practically nothing of
him and his writings; we only know of his great reputation, and of his
attempted reformulation of the Gnosis. Indeed so-called Valentinianism
helps us not at all in this speculation;

<span id="page_571">p. 571</span>

on the contrary, if we are to believe in any way the indications of the
Church Fathers, "they of Valentinus" seem to have formulated things
somewhat differently, and their ideas form only a small worked-in part
of the great syntheses with which we have been dealing. But the
information of the Church Fathers is very defective, and they seem for
the most part to have dealt with the semi-popular phase of Gnosticism.
Such abstruse subjects and such inner teachings as our Codices contain,
could not possibly have been circulated publicly; they were meant for
"disciples." It is true that the *Pistis* is in parts in a far more
popular form, but if it had been widely circulated; it is strange that
no mention of so marvellous an exposition should remain.

I, however, put forward this speculation with all hesitation; it means a
totally different reading of Valentinianism, a reading from within and
not from without. Our ideas on Gnosticism have, however, been so often
of late revised by new discoveries, that it may still be hoped that some
new find may yet throw a clear light on this (at present) entirely
obscure problem.

In the Introduction to my translation of the *Pistis Sophia*, I find
that I have stated my conclusions somewhat more crudely than I should
now do. I will, therefore, in repeating what I there said as to the
probable story of the adventures of the contents of the Askew Codex,
slightly modify some expressions.

The original Greek treatise which is now called the *Pistis Sophia* may,
then, probably

<span id="page_572">p. 572</span>

<span class="margnote">The Original Pistis Sophia.</span>have been
compiled by Valentinus in the latter half of the second century, perhaps
at Alexandria. By "compiled" I mean that this Apocalypse or Gospel, or
whatever its title may have been, was not invented from first to last by
Valentinus; the framework of the narrative, the selection of texts and
ideas from other scriptures, Hebrew, Christian, Egyptian, Chaldæan,
Greek, etc., and the adaptation of the nomenclature, were his share of
the task.

<span class="margnote">The Coptic Translation.</span>Of this original
doubtless several copies were made, and mistakes may have crept in. One
of these copies was presumably carried up the Nile and translated into
the vernacular, Greek being but little understood so far up the river.
The translator was evidently not a very accurate person; moreover his
knowledge of the subject was so imperfect that he had to leave many of
the technical terms in the original, and doubtless made guesses at
others. It is also probable that some things were added and others
subtracted on the score of orthodoxy. The wearisome length of the
Psalms, for instance, which Pistis Sophia recites in her repentances,
followed by the shorter Salomonic Odes, leads one to suppose that the
compiler originally quoted only a few striking verses from each psalm,
and that the later and more orthodox translator, with that love of
wearisome repetition so characteristic of monkish piety, whether of the
East or the West, added the other less apposite verses, with which he
was very familiar, while he was compelled to leave the Salomonic Odes as
they

<span id="page_573">p. 573</span>

stood, owing to his lack of acquaintance with the originals.

Moreover, the translator must have translated or possessed a translation
of other similar documents, <span class="margnote">The Books of the
Saviour.</span> which he or a later scribe styles *The Books of the
Saviour*, and from them he extracted what he considered to be passages
apposite to the subject in hand, and appended them to the *Pistis*
translation. These Books also, in my opinion, came from the literary
workshop of Valentinus.

The whole MS. of the Coptic translator seems to have been copied by some
ignorant copyist, who <span class="margnote">The Copyist.</span> made
many mistakes of orthography. It was copied by one man as a task, and
hurriedly executed; and I would suggest that two copies were then made
and occasionally a page of one copy substituted for a page of the other;
and, as the pages were not quite exact to a word or phrase, we may thus
account for some puzzling repetitions and some equally puzzling lacunae.
This copy was conjecturally made towards the end of the fourth century.

What was the history of the MS. after this date is impossible even to
conjecture. Its history must, however, have been exciting enough for it
to have escaped the hands of fanatics--both Christian and Mohammedan.
During this period some of the pages were lost.

The contents of the inferior MS. of the Bruce Codex presumably had
somewhat similar adventures, may even have come from the same
distributing Coptic centre.

It would be entirely out of place in these short

<span id="page_574">p. 574</span>

sketches to enter on a critical investigation into the nature of the
æonology, cosmology, soteriology, christology, and eschatology of these
documents, and attempt to trace their modifications. The evolution of
the universe is according to a certain order, but its involution seems
to change that order; the soteriology modifies the æonology and
cosmology. It is, in my opinion, because of this, rather than for any
other reason, that the scheme underlying the *Extracts* and *The Book of
the Great Logos* is said to be an "older form" than that underlying the
*Pistis* treatise.

<span class="margnote">The Scheme presupposed in these
Treatises.</span>The scheme underlying the *Pistis Sophia* has been
industriously analysed by Köstlin and revised and corrected by Schmidt,
who has also endeavoured to trace the modification of the general scheme
underlying the *Extracts* (hitherto erroneously called the Fourth Book
of *Pistis Sophia*) and *The Book of the Great Logos*, and of the scheme
presupposed in the *Pistis Sophia*,--modifications brought about by the
revelation of the new glories of the three Spaces of the Inheritance in
the last treatise.

As the general outlines of the scheme underlying the *Pistis Sophia* may
be of service to the reader, we will give it here, but it should be
understood that it represents only one configuration of the cosmic
mystery, at a certain moment of time, or in a certain phase of
consciousness.

We now come to a brief consideration of the superior MS. of the Bruce
Codex. Here also wè must rule out of place any attempt to grapple with
an exposition of the system presupposed by the compiler or compilers, in
spite of the following opinion and high appreciation of Schmidt, who in
his Introduction (pp. 34 and 35) writes:

"What a different world on the contrary meets us in our thirty-one
leaves! We find ourselves in the pure spheres of the highest Plērōma,

<span id="page_576">p. 576</span>

see step by step this world, so rich in heavenly <span
class="margnote">An Appreciation of the Untitled Treatise.</span>
beings, coming into existence before our eyes; each individual space
with all its inmates is minutely described, so that we can form for
ourselves a living picture of the glory and splendour of this Gnostic
heaven. The speculations are not so confused and fantastic as those of
the *Pistis Sophia* and our two *Books of Jeū*; here everything is in
full harmony and logical sequence. The author is imbued with the Greek
spirit, equipped with a full knowledge of Greek philosophy, full of the
doctrine of the Platonic ideas, an adherent of Plato's view of the
origin of evil--that is to say Hylē (Matter). Here it is not Christ who
is the organ of all communications to the disciples; it is not Jesus who
is God's envoy, and the redeemer and bringer of the mysteries; but we
possess in these leaves a magnificently conceived work by an old Gnostic
philosopher, and we stand astonished, marvelling at the boldness of the
speculations, dazzled by the richness of the thought, touched by the
depth of soul of the author. This is not, like the *Pistis Sophia*, the
product of declining Gnosticism, but dates from a period when Gnostic
genius like a mighty eagle left the world behind it, and soared in wide
and ever wider circles towards pure light, towards pure knowledge, in
which it lost itself in ecstasy.

"In one word, we possess in this Gnostic work as regards age and
contents a work of the very highest importance, which takes us into a
period of Gnosticism, and therefore of Christianity, of which

<span id="page_577">p. 577</span>

very little knowledge has been handed down to us."

<span class="margnote">Not to be attributed to a Single
Author.</span>While cordially agreeing with Schmidt in his last
paragraph, and in his high appreciation of the sublimity of the contents
of this MS., we must venture to differ from him as to the clearness and
logical order of the contents as at present preserved to us. If all is
so clear and in such logical sequence, it is surprising that Schmidt has
made no attempt to explain the contents. Many and many an hour have I
puzzled over the contents of his translation and tried to get them into
order, but I have as yet always failed. The result of my study, however,
has led me to differ from Schmidt's assumption that the work is by a
single author.

<span class="margnote">The Apocalyptic Basis.</span>My present
conclusion, which is of course put forward as entirely tentative, is
that the underlying matter was originally in the form of an apocalypse,
a series of visions of some subtle phase of the inner ordering and
substance of things. I would suggest that these visions were not in an
ordered sequence, but were written down, or taken down, at different
times as the seer described the inner working of nature from different
points of view. The original writer was clearly, as it seems to me, an
adherent of the Basilidian Gnosis, imbued with its teaching and
nomenclature; but he had his own illumination as well, and, seeing some
of the things of which he had been taught, in high enthusiasm and
inspired confidence, he sang of the greater things by analogy

<span id="page_578">p. 578</span>

with the lower he had seen--even these lower being so glorious that he
could not express them as they really are.

<span class="margnote">The Overworking.</span>These apocalyptic visions
were elaborately expanded and annotated and welded into a unity (the
first part being cosmogonical, and the second soteriological) by a
writer of great knowledge and wide reading, who was not only familiar
with all the Gnostic literature of his time, but also had seen the
things for himself; he laboured to make a consistent treatise with the
apocalyptic material, on which he set a very high value, as a basis; but
he often did not succeed, and clearly states that it is impossible for
any "tongue of flesh" to tell of such sublime mysteries.

I am strongly persuaded that the overwriting of this apocalypsis belongs
to the same circle of literary activity of which we have been already
treating. In it I think we have another specimen of the attempts to
re-edit and syntheticize the Gnosis, of which the main attempt is
associated with the activity of Valentinus. As to the history of the
Greek original, it parallels presumably that of the *Pistis Sophia*
original. It was probably translated about the same time, and had
adventures of a somewhat similar nature.
