<p>"From the very beginning have ye been immortal and children of life--such life as the &aelig;ons enjoy;<span class="margnote"><FONT SIZE="-1" COLOR="GREEN">Ye are the Sons of God.</FONT></span> yet would ye have death shared up among you, to spend and lavish it, so that death might die in you and by your hands; for inasmuch as ye dissolve the world and are not dissolved yourselves, ye are lords of all creation and destruction."</p>  
<p>Here we have the burden of the teaching in one of the treatises of the Codex Brucianus--to crucify the world and not let the world crucify us--and of the <i>Pistis Sophia</i> treatise, "Know ye not that ye are all gods and lords?" The Self within the heart, the seed of the divine, the pneumatic light-spark, the dweller in light, the inner man, was the eternal pilgrim incarnated in matter; those who had this alive and conscious within them were the spiritual or pneumatic. To such Valentinus is speaking.</p>
