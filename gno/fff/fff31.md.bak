### MONOÏMUS.

HIPPOLYTUS devotes his next section to a certain Monoïmus, who is only
mentioned by one other hæresiologist, namely Theodoret, in a brief
paragraph. Monoïmus was an Arabian and lived somewhere in the latter
half of the second century. His system is based on the idea of the
Heavenly Man, the universe, and the Son of this Man, the perfect man,
all other men being but imperfect reflections of the one ideal type.

<span class="margnote">Number-theories.</span>His general ideas attach
themselves to the cycle of Gnostic literature of which we are treating,
and are elaborated by many mathematical and geometrical considerations
from the Pythagoræan and Platonic traditions. The theory of numbers and
the geometrical composition of the universe from elements which are
symbolized by the five Platonic solids--namely, the tetrahedron, cube,
octahedron, dodecahedron and icosahedron--are developed. All these
geometrical symbols are produced by the monad, which he calls the iōta,
the yod, and the "one horn." It is our old friend the serpentine force,
the horn of plenty, the rod of Moses and of Hermes; in other words, it
is the atom which is said by seers to be a "conical" swirl of forces.
This monad is in numbers the decad, the perfect number and completion of
the first series of numbers, after which the whole process begins again.

Now it was Moses’ rod which brought to pass the plagues of Egypt
according to the myth. These

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "plagues" are
nothing else but transmutations of the matter of the physical body,
*e.g.*, water into blood, etc., all of which is quaintly worked out by
the writer.

The whole of this system, indeed, opens up a number of important
considerations which would lead us far beyond the scope of the present
essay. Monoïmus was undoubtedly a contemporary of the Valentinian
school, if not a pupil of Valentinus, and the garbled version of his
system as preserved by Hippolytus can be made to yield many important
points which will throw light on the "theological arithmetic" of the
Gnostic doctors. This may be proved some day still to preserve a seed
which may grow into a tree of real mathematical knowledge.

We will conclude our sketch of the tenets of

Monoïmus by quoting his opinion on the way to seek <span
class="margnote">How to seek after God.</span> for God. In a letter to a
certain Theophrastus, he writes: "Cease to seek after God (as without
thee), and the universe, and things similar to these; seek Him from out
of thyself, and learn who it is, who once and for all appropriateth all
in thee unto Himself, and sayeth: 'My god, my mind, my reason, my soul,
my body.' And learn whence is sorrow and joy, and love and hate, and
waking though one would not, and sleeping though one would not, and
getting angry though one would not, and falling in love though one would
not. And if thou shouldst closely investigate these things, thou wilt
find Him in thyself, one and many, just as the atom; thus finding from
thyself a way out of thyself."

All of this re-echoes very distinctly the teaching of the earlier
Trismegistic literature.
