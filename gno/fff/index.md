This is one of the best books about the Gnostics written prior to the
Nag Hammadi discoveries. G.R.S. Mead, who also translated the [Pistis
Sophia](../../chr/ps/index), summarizes what was known about the
Gnostics at the turn of the 20th century. At that time, a better picture
of the Gnostics was emerging, based on several papyri which had been
recently discovered. Although there had been a lot of academic research
on this subject, most of the key works were in German or French.
Therefore this book and [The Gnostics and Their Remains](../gar/index)
are the only two major books in English on this subject currently in the
public domain.

It was becoming increasingly obvious that early Christianity was a wide
spectrum of sects, the record of which had been subsequently forgotten
or suppressed by the Church. The Gnostics had deep connections with
ancient Mystery religions, Pythagoreanism, Hinduism and other ancient
beliefs. Most of the sacred texts of Gnosticism were long lost or
survived only in small quotes.

Mead draws on information provided both by the Early Church Fathers
hostile to Gnosticism, and the available corpus of actual Gnostic
documents at the time, cryptic and fragmentary as it was. He includes
excerpts from previously untranslated manuscripts, and extensive
summaries of the Pistis Sophia and the writings of the critics of
Gnosticism. This book is required reading for anyone who wants to
understand Gnosticism and the development of early Christianity.
