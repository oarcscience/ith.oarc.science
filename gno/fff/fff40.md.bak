### THE BASILIDIAN GNOSIS.

LET us now return to the early years of the second century, and devote
our attention to <span class="margnote">Basilides and his
Writings.</span> Basilides and his followers ("them of Basilides") who
elaborated one of the most abstruse and consistent systems of the
Gnosis, the outlines of which are plainly recoverable from the garbled
fragments that Patristic polemics have left us.

Of the life of this great doctor of the Gnosis we know nothing beyond
the fact that he taught at Alexandria. His date is entirely conjectural;
he is, however, generally supposed to have been immediately prior to
Valentinus. If, therefore, we say that he flourished somewhere about
<span class="small">A.D.</span> 120-130, it should be understood that a
margin of ten years or so either way has to be allowed for. Of his
nationality again we know nothing. But whether he was Greek, or
Egyptian, or Syrian, he was steeped in Hellenic culture, and learned in
the wisdom of the Egyptians. He was also well versed in the Hebrew
scriptures as set forth in the Greek version of the Seventy. The Gospel
teaching was his delight, and he wrote no fewer than twenty-four books
of commentaries thereon, although he does not appear to have used the
subsequently canonical versions. He also quotes from several of the
Pauline Letters.

Of the writings of Basilides the most important were the commentaries
already referred to; they were the first commentaries on the
Gospel-teachings written by a Christian philosopher; and in this, as

<span id="page_254">p. 254</span>

in all other departments of theology, the Gnostics led the way.
Basilides is further said to have written a Gospel himself, and to have
claimed to be the disciple of a certain Glaucias, who was an
"interpreter of Peter." There is also mention of certain Traditions of
Matthias, as held in great honour by the school. These purported to be
teachings given to Matthias in secret by Jesus after the "resurrection."
It may, therefore, be supposed that the Gospel of Basilides was not a
new historical setting of the Sayings of the Lord, but an exposition of
that "knowledge of supermundane things," which was the definition he
gave to the Gospel. Basilides presumably wrote a commentary on the
Sayings and Doings of the Lord, which were in general circulation in
many traditions, with or without the various historical settings; and
also his own elaboration of certain inner instructions that had been
handed down by a secret tradition. Whether or not this inner Gospel
formed part of the twenty-four books of his *Exegetica* is doubtful;
most critics, however, are in favour of this view. In any case, it is to
be supposed that his commentaries aimed at explaining the public Sayings
and Parables by the light of this secret Gospel. But there is another
hypothesis, which, if true, would be of intense interest. It is
suggested that it was Matthias, one of the heads of the inner schools,
who wrote the original sketch of Sayings and Doings underlying our
Synoptic accounts, and that these accounts were expansions by various
presbyters of the outer churches in Egypt. The original draft was
presumably

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

a Life intended for public circulation, and designed to be capable of an
interpretation according to the inner tenets of the Gnosis.

Basilides is also said to have written certain Odes, but of these no
fragment has reached us.

Our main sources of information for recovering an outline of the
Basilidian Gnosis are three in <span class="margnote">Our Sources of
Information.</span> number, and consist of the very fragmentary
quotations: (i.) of Hippolytus in his later work, *The Philosophumena;*
(ii.) of Clement of Alexandria in his *Miscellanies;* and (iii.)
presumably in the first place (either of the lost Syntagma of Justin or)
of the lost work of Agrippa Castor, who is said by Eusebius to have
written a refutation of the views of Basilides in the reign of Hadrian
(c. 133 <span class="small">A.D.</span>), and whose very unsatisfactory
and inaccurate data were copied by Irenæus, and the epitomators of the
earlier, smaller, and now lost work of Hippolytus.

Turning to the great work of Hippolytus, we come upon the most valuable
information extant for the reconstruction of this most highly
metaphysical system. The Church Father had evidently before him a
treatise of Basilides, but whether it was the *Exegetica* or not, is by
no means clear; what is certain, however, is that it set forth the
Gospel, or "knowledge of supermundane things," as Basilides understood
it; and we can only regret that we have not the original text of the
Gnostic doctor himself before us, instead of a most faulty copy of the
text of the Church Father's *Refutation*, whose method is of the most
provoking. Hippolytus muddles up his own glosses and criticisms with
mutilated quotations,

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

imperfectly summarizes important passages, which treat of conceptions
requiring the greatest subtlety and nicety of language; and in other
respects does scant justice to a thinker whose faith in Christianity was
so great, that, far from confining it to the narrow limits of a dogmatic
theology, he would have it that the Gospel was also a universal
philosophy explanatory of the whole world-drama.

Let us then raise our thoughts to those sublime heights to which the
genius of Basilides soared so many centuries ago, when faith in the
universal possibilities of the Glad Tidings was really living. And first
we must rise to that stupendous intuition of Deity, which transcends
even Being, and which to the narrow minds of earth seems pure
nothingness, instead of being that which beggars all fullness. Beyond
time, beyond space, beyond consciousness, beyond Being itself--

<span class="margnote">The Divinity Beyond Being.</span>"There was when
naught was; nay, even that 'naught' was not aught of things that are
\[even in the world of reality\]. But nakedly, conjecture and mental
quibbling apart, there was absolutely not even the One \[the Logos of
the world of reality\]. And when I use the term 'was,' I do not mean to
say that it was \[that is to say, in any state of being\]; but merely to
give some suggestion of what I wish to indicate, I use the expression
'there was absolutely naught.' For that 'naught' is not simply the
so-called Ineffable; it is beyond that. For that which is *really*
ineffable is not named Ineffable, but is superior to every name that is
used.

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

"The names \[we use\] are not sufficient even for the \[manifested\]
universe \[which is outside the world of real being\], so diversified is
it; they fall short."

Much less, then, he continues to argue, can we find appropriate names
for the beings of the world of reality and their operations; and far
more impossible, therefore, is it to give names to That which transcends
even reality. Thus we see that Basilides soared beyond even the ideal
world of Plato, and ascended to the untranscendable intuition of the
Orient--the That which cannot be named, to be worshipped in silence
alone.

We next come to the inception of the Seed of Universality, in this state
beyond being, a <span class="margnote">Universality Beyond Being.</span>
discrete stage, so to speak, beyond the unmanifested or noumenal world
even.

Hippolytus summarizes this condition of non-being, which transcends all
being from the original treatise as follows.

"Naught was, neither matter, nor substance, nor voidness of substance,
nor simplicity, nor impossibility-of-composition, nor inconceptibility,
nor imperceptibility, neither man, nor angel, nor god; in fine, neither
anything at all for which man has ever found a name, nor any operation
which falls within the range either of his [perception](errata.htm#31.md)
or conception. Such, or rather far more removed from the power of man's
comprehension, was the state of non-being, when \[if we can speak of
'when' in a state beyond time and space\] the Deity beyond being,
without thinking, or feeling, or determining, or choosing, or

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

being compelled, or desiring, willed to create universality.

"When I use the term 'will,'" writes Basilides, "I do so merely to
suggest the idea of an operation transcending all volition, thought, or
sensible action. And this universality also was not \[our\] dimensional
and differentiable universe, which subsequently came into existence and
was separated \[from other universes\], but the Seed of all universes."

This is evidently the same concept as the Mūlaprakriti of Indian
philosophy, and the most admirable statement of the dogma of the
"creation out of nothing" that has been put forward by any Christian
philosopher.

"This universal Seed contained everything in itself, potentially, in
some such fashion as the grain of mustard seed contains the whole
simultaneously in the minutest point--roots, stem, branches, leaves, and
the innumerable germs that come from the seeds of the plant, and which
in their turn produce still other and other plants in manifold series.

"Thus the Divinity beyond being created universality beyond being from
elements beyond being, positing and causing to subsist a single
something"--which poverty of language compels us to call a Seed, but
which was really the potentiality of potentialities, seeing that it was
"containing in itself the entire all-seed-potency of the universe." From
such a "Seed," which is everywhere and nowhere, and which treasures in
its bosom everything that was or is or is to be, all things must come
into

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

manifestation in their "proper natures and cycles" and times, at the
will of the Deity beyond all. How this is brought about is by no means
clear. Basilides seems to have had some idea of a "supplementary
development" (κατὰ προσθήκην αὐξανόμενα), which, however, is beyond
definition; one thing is clear, that he entirely repudiated every idea
of emanation, projection, or pullulation (προβολή).

"For of what sort of emanation is there need, or of what sort of matter
must we make supposition, <span class="margnote">Ex Nihilo.</span> in
order that God should make the universe, like as a spider weaves its web
\[from itself\], or mortal. man takes brass or timber or other matter
out of which to make something? But 'He spake and it was,' and this is
what is the meaning of the saying of Moses, 'Let there be light, and
there was light.' Whence, then, was the light? From naught. For it is
not written whence, but only from the voice of the Speaker of the word.
And He who spake the word, was not; and that which was, was not. For the
Seed of the universe, the word that was spoken, 'Let there be light,'
was from the state beyond being. And this was what was spoken in the
Gospel, 'It was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into
the world.' Man both deriveth his principles from that Seed and is also
enlightened by it." This primordial Light and Life is the source of all
things.

The next stage deals with the outcome, first-fruits, highest product, or
sublimest consummation, of universal potentiality, which Basilides calls
the Sonship.

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

<span class="margnote">The Sonship.</span>"In the absolute Seed there
was a triple Sonship in every way consubstantial with the God beyond
being, coming into being from the state beyond being. Of this triply
divided Sonship, one aspect was the subtlest of the subtle, one less
subtle, and one still stood in need of purification. The subtlest nature
of the Sonship instantly and immediately, together with the depositing
of the Seed of universality by the God beyond being, burst forth, rose
aloft, and hastened from below upward, 'like wing or thought,' as Homer
sings, and was with Him beyond being \[πρὸς τὸν οὐκ ὄντα--"with,' the
very same word as the mysterious preposition in the Proem now prefixed
to the fourth canonical Gospel\]. For every nature striveth after Him
because of His transcendency of all beauty and loveliness, but some in
one way and others in another.

"The less subtle nature of the Sonship, on the other hand, still
remained within the universal Seed; for though it would imitate the
higher and ascend, it could not, seeing that it fell short of the degree
of subtlety of the first Sonship, which had ascended through it \[the
second\], and so it remained behind. The less subtle Sonship,
accordingly, had to find for itself as it were wings on which to soar, .
. . and these wings are the Holy Spirit."

Just as a bird cannot fly without wings, and the wings cannot soar
without the bird, so the second Sonship and the Holy Spirit are
complementary the one to the other, and confer mutual benefits on one
another.

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

We here see that Basilides is dealing with the second aspect of the
Logos, the positive-negative state; we also perceive the anticipation of
the ground of the great controversies which subsequently arose
generations later, such as the Arian and the Filioque." But if we
enquire whence was the Holy Spirit, Basilides will tell us, from the
universal Seed, from which all things came forth under the will of
Deity.

"The second Sonship, then, borne aloft by the Spirit, as by a wing,
bears aloft the wing, that is the <span class="margnote">The Holy
Sprit.</span> Spirit; but on drawing nigh to the first Sonship and the
God beyond being, who createth from the state beyond being. it could no
longer keep the Spirit with it, for it \[the Spirit\] was not of the
same substance with it, nor had it a nature like unto that of the
Sonship. But just as a pure and dry atmosphere is unnatural and harmful
to fish, so to the Holy Spirit was that state of the Sonship together
with the God beyond being--that state more ineffable than every
ineffable and transcending every name.

"The Sonship, therefore, left it \[the Spirit\] behind near that Blessed
Space, which can neither be conceived of, nor characterized by any word,
yet not entirely deserted nor yet divorced from the Sonship. But even as
the sweetest smelling unguent poured. into a vessel, though the vessel
be emptied of it with the greatest possible care, nevertheless some
scent of the unguent still remains and is left behind--the vessel
retains the scent of the unguent, though it no longer holds the unguent
itself--in such a way has

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

the Holy Spirit remained emptied and divorced from the Sonship, yet at
the same time retaining in itself as it were the power of the unguent,
the savour of the Sonship. And this is the saying, 'Like the unguent on
the head which ran down unto Aaron's beard'--the savour of the Holy
Spirit permeating from above and below even as far as the formlessness
\[crude matter\] and our state of existence, whence the \[remaining\]
Sonship received its first impulse to ascend, borne aloft as it were on
the wings of an eagle. For all things hasten from below upward, from
worse to better, nor is anything in the better condition so bereft of
intelligence as to plunge downward. But as yet this third Sonship still
remains in the great conglomeration of the seed-mixture, conferring and
receiving benefits," in a manner that will receive subsequent
explanation.

The Holy Spirit, which in reality permeates everything, but phenomenally
separates the sensible universe from the noumenal, constitutes what
Basilides terms the Limitary Spirit, midway between things cosmic and
supercosmic. This Firmament is far beyond the visible firmament whose
locus is the moon's track.

<span class="margnote">The Great Ruler.</span>"After this, from the
universal Seed and conglomeration of seed-mixture there burst forth and
came into existence the Great Ruler, the head of the sensible universe,
a beauty and magnitude and potency that [naught](errata.htm#32.md) can
destroy." This is the demiurge; but let no mortal think that he can
comprehend so great a being, "for he is more ineffable than ineffables,
more potent than potencies,

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

wiser than the wise, superior to every excellence that one can name.

"Coming into existence he raised himself aloft, and soared upward, and
was borne above in all his entirety as far as the Great Firmament. There
he remained, because he thought there was none above him, and so he
became the most potent power of the universe," save only the third
Sonship which yet remained in the seed-mixture. His limit, therefore,
was his own ignorance of the supercosmic spaces, although his wisdom was
the greatest of all in the cosmic realms.

"Thus thinking himself lord, and ruler, and a wise master-builder, he
betook himself to the creation of the creatures of the universe."

This is the supercelestial or ætherial creation, which has its physical
correspondence in the spaces beyond the moon; below the moon was our
world and its "atmosphere." This atmosphere (the sublunary regions)
terminated at the visible heaven, or lower firmament, its periphery,
marked by the moon's path. In the sun-space lay the ætherial realms,
which apparently no mortal eye has seen, but only the reflection of
their inhabitants, the stars, in the surface of the sublunary waters of
space.

The ætherial creation of the Great Ruler proceeds on the theory of
similarity and analogy.

"First of all the Great Ruler, thinking it not right that he should be
alone, made for himself, and <span class="margnote">The Ætherial
Creation.</span> brought into existence from the universal Seed, a Son
far better and wiser than himself. For all this

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

had been predetermined by the God beyond being, when He deposited the
universal Seed.

"And the Great Ruler, on beholding his Son, was struck with wonder and
love and amazement at his marvellously great beauty, and he caused him
to sit at his right hand." And this space where is the throne of the
Great Ruler they called the Ogdoad. "And the Great Demiurgos, the wise
one, fabricated the whole ætherial creation with his own hand; but it
was his Son, who was wiser still, who infused energy into him and
suggested to him ideas."

That is to say, that the Great Ruler made the creatures of the ætherial
spaces, and these evolved souls, or rather were ensouled. And thus it is
that the son is, as it were, greater than the father, and sits on his
right hand, or above him; the right hand in Gnostic symbolism signifying
a higher condition. They mutually confer benefits also, one giving the
body and the other the mind or soul to ætherial beings. All ætherial
spaces then, down to the moon, are provided for and managed by the Son
of the Great Ruler, the consummation or perfection of his evolution or
creation.

<span class="margnote">The Sublunary Spaces.</span>"Next, there arose a
second Ruler from the universal Seed, far inferior to the first, but
greater than all below him, except the Sonship which still remained in
the Seed." This was the Ruler of the sublunary spaces, from the moon to
the earth. This Ruler is called effable, because men can speak of him
with understanding, and the space over which he rules is named the
Hebdomad. And the second Ruler also "brought

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

forth a Son far greater than himself from the universal Seed, in like
manner to the first," and the lower creation was ordered in the same
manner as the higher. This lower creation is apparently still one of
subtle matter.

As to the earth, the conglomeration of the seed-mixture is still in our
own stage or space, and the things that come to pass in this state of
existence, "come to pass according to nature, as having been primarily
uttered by Him who hath planned the fitting time and form and manner of
utterance of the things that were to be uttered. Of things here on the
earth, then, there is no special chief or manager or creator, for
sufficient for them is that plan which the God beyond being laid down
when He deposited the universal Seed."

That is to say, that the earth-stage is the moment between the past and
future, the turning-point of all choice, the field of new karman; here
all things verily are in the hand of God alone, in the highest sense.
Thus does Basilides avoid the difficulties both of fate and free-will
absolute.

We next come to the soteriology of Basilides, the redemption and
restoration of all things.

"When, then, the supercosmic planes and the whole universe \[ætherial,
sublunary, and terrestrial\] <span class="margnote">Soteriology.</span>
were completed, and there was no deficiency," that is to say, when the
evolutionary stream of creative energy began to return on itself, there
still remained behind in the universal Seed the third Sonship, which
bestows and receives benefits.

"But it needs must be that this Sonship also

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

should be manifested, and restored to its place above, there beyond the
highest Firmament, the Limitary Spirit of cosmos, with the most subtle
Sonship, and the second which followed the example of its fellow, and
the God beyond being, even as it was written, 'And the creation itself
groaneth together and travaileth together, waiting for the manifestation
of the Sons of God'"--the third Sonship.

The Sons of God are the divine sparks, the real spiritual men within,
who have been left behind here in the seed-mixture, "to order and inform
and correct and perfect our souls, which have a natural tendency
downwards to remain in this state of existence."

Before the Gospel was preached, and the Gnosis came, the Great Ruler of
the Ogdoad was considered even by the most spiritual among men to be the
only God, nevertheless no name was given to him, because he was
ineffable.

The inspiration of Moses, however, came from the Hebdomad only, as may
be seen from the words, "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but
the name of God I did not make known unto them." This God to whom Moses
and the Prophets gave names, was of the Hebdomad, which is effable, and
their inspiration came from this source. But the Gospel was that Mystery
which was ever unknown, not only to the nations, but also to them of the
Hebdomad and the Ogdoad, and even to their Rulers.

"When, therefore, the time had come," says the

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gnostic doctor,
"for the revelation of the children of God (who are ourselves), for whom
the whole <span class="margnote">The Mystic Gospel.</span> creation
groaneth and travaileth in expectation, the Gospel \[the Glad Tidings,
the Gnosis\] came into the universe, and passed through every
principality, and authority, and lordship, and every title that man can
use. It 'came' of very truth, not that anything 'came down' from above,
or that the blessed Sonship 'departed from' that Blessed God beyond
being, who transcends all thought. Nay, but just as the vapour of
naphtha can catch fire from a flame a great way off from the naphtha, so
do the powers of men's spirit pass from below from the formlessness of
the conglomeration up to the Sonship.

"The Son of the Great Ruler of the Ogdoad, catching fire as it were,
lays hold of and seizes on the ideas from the blessed Sonship beyond the
Limitary Spirit. For the power of the Sonship which is in the midst of
the Holy Spirit, in the Limit Space, shares the flowing and rushing
thoughts of the \[supreme\] Sonship with the Son of the Great Ruler.

"Thus the Gospel first came from the Sonship through the Son who sits by
the Great Ruler, to that Ruler; and the Ruler learned that he was not
the God over all, but a generable deity, and that above him was set the
Treasure of the ineffable and unnameable That beyond being and of the
Sonship. And he repented and feared on understanding in what ignorance
he had been. This is the meaning of the words, 'The fear of the Lord is
the beginning of wisdom.' For he began to grow wise through the

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

instruction of the Christ sitting by him, learning what is That beyond
being, what the Sonship, what the Holy Spirit, what the apparatus of the
universe what the manner of its restoration. This is the 'wisdom,
declared in a mystery,' concerning which Scripture uses the words, 'Not
in words taught of human wisdom, but in those taught of the Spirit.'

"The great Ruler, then, being instructed and taught and made afraid,
confessed the sin which he had done in boasting himself. This is the
saying, 'I have recognized my sin, and I know my transgression, and I
will confess it for the eternity.'

"After the instruction of the Great Ruler, the whole space of the Ogdoad
was instructed and taught, and the Mystery became known to the powers
above the heavens.

"Then was it that the Gospel should come to the Hebdomad, that its Ruler
might be instructed and evangelized in like manner. Thereupon the Son of
the Great Ruler lit up in the Son of the Ruler of the lower space, the
Light which he himself had had kindled in him from above from the
Sonship; and thus the Son of the Ruler of the Hebdomad was illumined,
and preached the Gospel to the Ruler, who in his turn, like as the Great
Ruler before him, feared and confessed \[his sin\]. And then all things
in the sublunary spaces were enlightened and had the Gospel preached
unto them.

<span class="margnote">The Sons of God.</span>"Therefore the time was
ripe for the illumination of the formlessness of our own world, and for
the Mystery to be revealed to the Sonship which had been left behind in
the formlessness, as it

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

were to one born out of due time (an abortion)--'the mystery which was
not known unto former generations,' as it is written, 'By revelation was
the mystery made known unto me,' and 'I heard unspeakable words, which
it is not lawful for man to utter.'

"Thus, from the Hebdomad, the Light--which had already come down from
above from the Ogdoad unto the Son of the Hebdomad--descended upon
Jesus, son of Mary, and he was illumined, being caught on fire in
harmony with the Light that streamed into him. This is the meaning of
the saying, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee'--that is to say, that
which came from the Sonship through the Limitary Spirit to the Ogdoad
and Hebdomad, down as far as Mary \[the body\]--and 'The Power of the
Highest shall overshadow thee'--that is to say, the divine creative
power which cometh from the \[ætherial\] heights above through the
Demiurgos, which power belongeth to the Son."

The text of Hippolytus is here exceedingly involved, and he evidently
did not seize the thought of Basilides. The "Son" apparently means the
soul. The power belongs to the soul and not to Mary--the body; the
divine creative power making of man a god, whereas the body can only
exercise the power of physical procreation. Moreover, Jesus seems to
stand for a type of every member of the Sonship, every Son of God.

"For the world shall hold together and not be dissolved until the whole
Sonship--which has been

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

left behind to benefit the souls in the state of formlessness, and to
receive benefits, by evolving forms for them \[the spirit requiring a
psychic vehicle for conscious contact with this plane\]--shall follow
after and imitate Jesus, and hasten upward and come forth purified.
\[For by purification\] it becometh most subtle, so that it is able to
speed aloft through its own power, even as the first Sonship; for it
hath all its power naturally consubsistent with the Light which shone
down from above.

<span class="margnote">The Final Consummation.</span>"When, then, the
whole Sonship shall have ascended, and passed beyond the Great Limit,
the Spirit, then shall the whole creation become the object of the Great
Mercy; for it groaneth until now and suffereth pain and awaiteth the
manifestation of the Sons of God, namely that all the men of the Sonship
may ascend beyond it \[the creation\]. And when this shall be effected,
God will bring upon the whole universe the Great Ignorance
\[Mahā-pralaya\], in order that all things may remain in their natural
condition, and nothing long for anything which is contrary to its
nature.

"Thus all the souls of this state of existence, whose nature is to
remain immortal in this state of existence alone, remain without
knowledge of anything different from or better than this state; nor
shall there be any rumour or knowledge of things superior in higher
states, in order that the lower souls may not suffer pain by striving
after impossible objects, just as though it were fish longing to feed on
the mountains with sheep,

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

for such a desire would end in their destruction. All things are
indestructible if they remain in their proper condition, but subject to
destruction if they desire to overleap and transgress their natural
limits.

"Thus the Ruler of the Hebdomad shall have no knowledge of the things
above him, for the Great Ignorance shall take hold of him also, so that
sorrow and pain and lamentation may go from him. He shall desire naught
of things impossible for him to attain, and thus shall suffer no grief.

"And in like manner the Great Ignorance shall seize upon the Great Ruler
of the Ogdoad, and also upon all the \[ætherial\] creations which are
subject to him in similar fashion, so that nothing may long after
anything contrary to nature and thus suffer pain.

"And thus shall be the restoration of all things, which have had their
foundations laid down according to nature in the Seed of the universe in
the beginning, and which will all be restored \[to their original
nature\] in their appointed cycles.

"And that everything has its proper cycle and time, the Saviour is
sufficient witness in the saying, 'My hour hath not yet come,' and also
the Magi in their observation of His star. For He also was foreordained
in the Seed to be subject to the nativity of the stars and the return of
the time-periods to their starting places."

Now the Saviour, according to the Basilidian Gnosis, was the perfected
spiritual "man," within

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

the psychic and animal man or soul. And when a man reaches this stage of
perfection, the Sonship in him leaves the soul behind here, "the soul
being no longer mortal but remaining in its natural state \[that is to
say, having become immortal\], just as the first Sonship \[left behind\]
the Holy Spirit, the Great Limit, in its proper space or region"; for it
is only then on reaching perfection, that the real "man" is "clothed
with a proper \[and really immortal\] soul."

<span class="margnote">Jesus.</span>Every part of the creation goes up a
stage, and the whole scheme of salvation is effected by the separating
from their state of conglomeration the various principles into their
proper states; and Jesus was the first-fruits, or great exemplar, of
this process.

"Thus his physical part down here--which belongs to formless
matter--alone suffered, and was restored to the formless state. His
psychic vesture or vehicle--which belongs to the Hebdomad--arose and was
restored to the Hebdomad. That vehicle in him which was of the nature of
the height of the Great Ruler he raised aloft, and it remained with the
Great Ruler. Moreover he raised still higher that which was of the
nature of the Great Limit, and it remained in the Limitary Spirit. And
it was thus through him that the third Sonship was purified, the Sonship
left behind in the state of mixture \[or impurity\] for the purpose of
helping and being helped, and it passed upwards through all of these
purified principles unto the blessed Sonship above,"

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

The main idea at the back of this system is the separating forth,
classification or restoration of the various elements or principles
confused in the original world-seed, or universal plasm, into their
proper natures, by a process of purification which brought unto men the
Gnosis or perfection of consciousness. Man was the crown of the
world-process, and the perfected man, the Christ, the Saviour, was the
crown of manhood, and therefore the manifestation of Deity, the Sonship.

So far Hippolytus, who in all probability gives us the outline of the
true Basilidian system. It was only in 1851 that *The Philosophumena*
were published to the world, after the discovery of the MS. in one of
the libraries on Mount Athos in 1842; prior to this nothing but the
short and garbled sketches of Irenæus and the Epitomators was known of
this great Gnostic's sublime speculations. *The Philosophumena* account
has revolutionized all prior views, and changed the whole enquiry, so
that the misrepresentations of Irenæus, or those of his prior authority,
are now referred to as "the spurious Basilidian system." To this we
shall refer later on. Meantime let us turn to Clement of Alexandria, who
deals purely with the ethical side of the Basilidian Gnosis, and
therefore does not touch the "metaphysical" part--using the term
"metaphysical" in the Aristotelian sense, namely, of things beyond the
Hebdomad, the things of the Hebdomad or sublunary space being called
"physics" or in the domain of physis or nature.

As to marriage, Basilides and his son Isidorus

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

taught that it was natural but not necessary, and seem to have taken a
moderate ground between the compulsory asceticism of some schools and
the glorification of procreation by the Jews, who taught that "he who is
without a wife is no man."

As to the apparently undeserved sufferings of martyrs, Basilides, basing
himself on the doctrines of reincarnation and karman, writes as follows
in Book xxiii. of his *Exegetica:* 

<span class="margnote">Karman and Reincarnation.</span>"I say that all
those who fall into these so-called tribulations, are people who, only
after transgressing in other matters without being discovered, are
brought to this good end \[martyrdom\] by the kindness of Providence, so
that, the offences they are charged with being quite different from
those they have committed without discovery, they do not suffer as
criminals for proved offences, reviled as adulterers or murderers, but
suffer merely for being Christians; which fact is so consoling to them
that they do not even appear to suffer. And even though it should happen
that one comes to suffer without previously committing any outward
transgression--a very rare case--he will not suffer at all through any
plot of any \[evil\] power, but in exactly the same way as the babe who
apparently has done no ill.

"For just as the babe, although it has done no wrong previously, or
practically committed any sin, and yet has the capacity of sin in it
\[from its former lives\], when it suffers, is advantaged and reaps many
benefits which otherwise are difficult to

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

gain; in just the selfsame way is it with the perfectly virtuous man
also who has never sinned in deed, for he has still the tendency to sin
in him; he has not committed actual sin \[in this life\], because he has
not as yet been placed in the necessary circumstances. In the case even
of such a man we should not be right in supposing entire freedom from
sin. For just as it is the will to commit adultery which constitutes the
adulterer, even though he does not find the opportunity of actually
committing adultery, and the will to commit murder constitutes the
murderer, although he may not be actually able to effect his purpose;
for just this reason if I see such a 'sinless' man suffering \[the pains
of martyrdom\], even if he has actually *done* no sin, I shall say that
he is evil in so far as he has still the *will* to transgress. For I
will say anything rather than that Providence is evil."

Moreover, even if the example of Jesus were to be flung in his face by
those who preferred miracle to law, the sturdy defender of the Gnosis
says that he should answer: "If you permit, I will say, He has not
sinned; but was like a babe suffering." And if he were pressed even more
closely, he would say: "The man you name is man, but God \[alone\] is
righteous; for 'no one is pure from pollution,'" as Job said.

Men suffer, says Basilides, from their deeds in former lives; the
"elect" soul suffers "honourably" through martyrdom, but souls of
another nature by other appropriate punishments. The "elect" soul is
evidently one that will suffer for an ideal; in other

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

words it is possessed of faith, which is the "assent of the soul to any
of the things which do not excite sensation such a soul, then,
"discovers doctrines without demonstration by an intellective
apprehension."

The vulgar superstition of transmigration, the passing of a human soul
into the body of an animal--so often confused by the uninstructed with
the doctrine of reincarnation, which denies such a possibility--received
a rational explanation at the hand of the Basilidian school. It arose
from a consideration of the animal nature in man, the animal soul, or
body of desire, the ground in which the passions inhere; the doctrine
being thus summarized by Clement:

<span class="margnote">The Theory of "Appendages."</span>"The
Basilidians are accustomed to give the name of appendages \[or
accretions\] to the passions. These essences, they say, have a certain
substantial existence, and are attached to the rational soul, owing to a
certain turmoil and primitive confusion."

The word translated essences is literally "spirits"; curiously enough
the whole animal soul is called the "counterfeit spirit" in the *Pistis
Sophia* treatise, and in *The Timæus* of Plato the same idea is called
"turmoil," as may be seen from the commentary of Proclus. The primitive
confusion is of course the chaotic conglomeration of the universal
seed-mixture, and the differentiation of the "elemental essence" of some
modern writers on theosophy.

"On to this nucleus other bastard and alien natures of the essence grow,
such as those of the wolf, ape, lion, goat, etc. And when the peculiar
qualities of

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

such natures appear round the soul, they cause the desires of the soul
to become like to the special natures of these animals, for they imitate
the actions of those whose characteristics they bear. And not only do
human souls thus intimately associate themselves with the impulses and
impressions of irrational animals, but they even imitate the movements
and beauties of plants, because they likewise bear the characteristics
of plants appended to them. Nay, there are also certain characteristics
\[of minerals\] shown by habits, such as the hardness of adamant."

But we are not to suppose that man is composed of several souls, and
that it is proper for man to yield to his animal nature, and seek excuse
for his misdeeds by saying that the foreign elements attached to him
have compelled him to sin; far from it, the choice is his, the
responsibility is his, the rational soul's. Thus in his book, *On an
Appended Soul*, Isidorus, son of Basilides, writes:

"Were I to persuade anyone that the real soul is not a unit, but that
the passions of the wicked <span class="margnote">Moral
Responsibility.</span> are occasioned by the compulsion of the appended
natures, no common excuse then would the worthless of mankind have for
saying, 'I was compelled, I was carried away, I did it without wishing
to do so, I acted unwillingly'; whereas it was the man himself who led
his desire towards evil, and refused to battle with the constraints of
the appendages. Our duty is to show ourselves rulers over the inferior
creation within us, gaining the mastery by means of our rational
principle."

In other words, the man is the same man, no

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

matter in what body or vesture he may be; the vestures are not the man.

One of the greatest festivals of the school was the celebration of the
Baptism of Jesus on the fifteenth day of the Egyptian month Tobe or
Tybi. "They of Basilides," says Clement, "celebrate His Baptism by a
preliminary night-service of readings; and they say that 'the fifteenth
year of Tiberius Caesar' means the fifteenth day of the month Tybi." It
was then that the Father "in the likeness of a dove"--which they
explained as meaning the Minister or Holy Spirit--came upon Him.

In "the fifteenth \[year\] of Tib\[erius\]" we have, then, perhaps an
interesting glimpse into the workshop of the "historicizers."

It is evident, therefore, that the Basilidians did not accept the
accounts of the canonical gospels literally, as Hippolytus claims; on
the contrary, they explained such incidents as historicized legends of
initiation, the process of which is magnificently worked out in the
*Pistis Sophia* treatise, to which I must refer the reader for further
information.

<span class="margnote">A Trace of Zoroastrianism.</span>We learn from
Agrippa Castor, as preserved by Eusebius, that Basilides imposed a
silence of five years on his disciples, as was the custom in the
Pythagorean school, and that he and his school set great store by the
writings of a certain Barcabbas and Barcoph, and by other books of
Orientals. Scholars are of opinion that Barcabbas and Barcoph, and their
variants, point to the cycle of Zoroastrian literature which is now
lost, but which was in great favour among many Gnostic

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

communities. It must have been that among the learned Jews and Essenes,
after the return from Babylonia, and also among the theosophically
minded of the time, the traditions of the Magi and of the great Iranian
faith were an important part of eclectic and syncretistic religion. The
Avesta-literature that has come down to us is said to be a recovery
front memory of a very small portion of the great library of Persepolis,
destroyed by the "accursed Alexander," as Pārsī tradition has it. And it
seems exceedingly probable, as Cumont has shown in his just-published
monumental work on the subject, that the Mithriac mystery-tradition
contains as authentic a tradition as the Pārsī line of descent, and
throws a brilliant light on the Zoroastrianism with which Gnosticism was
in contact.

Such, then, is all that can be deduced of the real Basilidian system
from the writings of Hippolytus and Clemens Alexandrinus, who
respectively selected only such points as they thought themselves
capable of refuting; that is to say, such features of the system as they
considered most erroneous. To the student of comparative religion it is
evident that both Church Fathers misunderstood the tenets they quoted,
seeing that even such hostilely selected passages easily fall into the
general scheme of universal theosophy, once they are taken out of the
setting of Patristic refutation, and allowed to stand on their own
merits. It is therefore a matter of deep regret that the writings of the
school have been lost or destroyed; they would doubtless have thrown

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

much light not only on Christian theosophy but also on the obscure
history of the origins.

<span class="margnote">The Spurious System.</span>It now remains for us
to refer briefly to the "spurious" Basilidian system. The following
points are taken from Irenæus and the epitomators, and are another proof
of the unreliability of Irenæus, the sheet-anchor of orthodox
hæresiology. The series of writers and copyists to which we refer, had
evidently no first-hand information of the teaching of Basilides, and
merely retailed whatever fantastic notions popular rumour and hearsay
attributed to the school.

The main features of the confection thus brewed are as follows. The God
of the Basilidians, they said, was a certain Abraxas or Abrasax, who was
the ruler of their first heaven, of which heavens there were no less
than 365. This power was so denominated because the sum of the numerical
values of the Greek letters in the name Abrasax came to 365, the number
of days in the year.

We learn, however, from Hippolytus (II.) that this part of the system
had to do with a far lower stage of creation than the God beyond all. It
is not, however, clear whether the Abrasax idea is to be identified with
the Great Ruler of the Ogdoad, or the Ruler of the Hebdomad and the
region of the "proasteioi up to the æther." In any case the 365
"heavens" pertained to the astrological and genetical considerations of
Egyptian and Chaldæan occult science, and represented from one point of
view the 365 "aspects" of the heavenly bodies (during the year), as
reflected on the surface of

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

the earth's "atmosphere" or envelope, which [extended](errata.htm#33.md) as
far as the moon.

Now it is curious to notice that in the *Pistis Sophia* treatise the
mysteries of embryology are consummated by a hierarchy of elemental
powers, or builders, 365 in number, who follow the dictates of the
karmic law, and fashion the new body in accordance with past deeds. The
whole is set forth in great detail, and also the astrological scheme of
the one ruler of the four, which in their turn each rule over ninety,
making in all 365 powers.

Not till Schwartze translated this treatise from the Coptic, in 1853,
was any certain light thrown on the Abrasax idea, and this just two
years after Miller in 1851 published his edition of *The
Philosophumena*, and thus supplied the material for proving that the
hitherto universal opinion that the "Abrasax" was the Basilidian name
for the God over all, was a gross error based on ignorance or
misrepresentation. It is also to be noticed that the ancient anonymous
treatise which fills the superior MS. of the Codex Brucianus, makes
great use of the number 365 among its endless hierarchies, but nowhere
mentions the name Abrasax.

The elemental forces which fashion the body are the lowest servants of
the karmic law. It was presumably these lowest powers that made up the
Abrasax of the populace. The God over all is the supreme ruler of an
endless galaxy of rulers, gods, archangels, authorities, and powers, all
of them superior to the 365.

In fact the mysteries of the unseen world were

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

so intricate in detail, that even those who devoted their lives to them
with unwearied constancy could scarcely understand some of the lower
processes, although the general idea was simple enough; and thus
Basilides imposed a silence of five years on his disciples, and declared
that "only one out of 1,000, and two out of 10,000," could really
receive the Gnosis, which was the consummation of many lives of effort.
Curiously enough this very phrase is also found in the *Pistis Sophia*
treatise.

The term Abrasax is well known to students of Gnosticism, because of the
number of gems on which it is found, and which are attributed to the
followers of Basilides; in addition to the great Continental scholars
who have treated the matter, in this country King has devoted much of
his treatise to the subject. The best and latest authorities, however,
are of opinion "that there is no tangible evidence for attributing any
known gems to Basilidianism or any other form of Gnosticism."

<span class="margnote">Abrasax.</span>In fact, in the Abrasax matter, as
in all other things, Gnosticism followed its natural tendency of going
"one better," to use a colloquialism, on every form of belief, or even
superstition. Doubtless the ignorant populace had long before believed
in Abrasax as the great power which governed birth and everyday affairs,
according to astrological notions; talismans, invocations, and the rest
of the apparatus which the vulgar mind ever clamours for in some form or
other, were all inscribed with this potent "name of power." Behind the
superstition, however, there lay certain occult facts,

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

of the real nature of which, of course, the vulgar astrologers and
talisman-makers were naturally ignorant. There facts, however, seem to
have been known to the doctors of the Gnosis, and they accordingly found
the proper place for them in their universal systems. Thus Abrasax, the
Great God of the ignorant, was placed among the lower hierarchies of the
Gnosis, and the popular idea of him was assigned to the lowest building
powers of the physical body.

As to the rest of the "spurious system" there is nothing of interest to
record; we cannot, however, omit the silliest tale told against the
Basilidians, which was as follows. They are said to have believed that
at the crucifixion Jesus changed bodies with Simon of Cyrene, and then,
when his substitute hung in agony, stood and mocked at those he had
tricked--with which cock-and-bull story we may come out of the Irenæic
"store-house of Gnosticism" for a breathing space.

Of the history of the school we know nothing beyond the fact that
Epiphanius, at the end of the fourth century, still met with students of
the Basilidian Gnosis in the nomes west of the Delta, from Memphis to
the sea. It seems more probable, however, that the school continued in
the main stream of Gnosticism of the latter half of the second century,
and was at the back of the great Valentinian movement of which we have
next to treat. Indeed it is very probable that the followers of this,
the main stream of the Gnosis, would have warmly resented being classed
as "them of Basilides" or "them of

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Valentinus"; they
doubtless regarded these teachers as handers-on of a living tradition,
each in his own way, and not as severally inspired revealers of new
doctrines.
