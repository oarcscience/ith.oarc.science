### THE AKHMĪM CODEX.

WE have now to lay before our readers what little information is at
present available with regard to the latest find in Gnosticism. Ten
years ago, Dr. Carl Schmidt informed me that he had hopes of bringing
out a work on the subject (including presumably a text and translation)
in some two years; but unfortunately his anxiously-awaited labours have
not yet seen the light. We are, therefore, entirely dependent upon the
report of the important communication made by him to the Royal Prussian
Academy of Sciences (*Kgl. preuss. Acad. d. Wissenschaften*) published
in the Transactions, and dated July 16th, 1896.

Schmidt's communication, entitled A "Pre-irenæic Gnostic Original Work
in Coptic" ("*Ein vorirenaeisches gnostisches Original-werk in
koptischer Sprache*"), proves the enormous importance of the happy
discovery. His paper is of course exceedingly technical and learned, but
the following summary will give the reader a general idea of a subject
which at present can only appeal to a very limited number of
specialists, but which ought in time to be familiar to all serious
students of Christian theosophy.

In January, 1896, Dr. Rheinhardt procured at Cairo, from a dealer of
antiquities from Akhmīm, <span class="margnote">The MS. and its
Contents.</span> this precious papyrus MS., which he asserted had been
discovered by a fellah in a niche in a wall. The MS. is now in the
Berlin Egyptian Museum, each leaf being carefully protected with glass.

<span id="page_580">p. 580</span>

Unfortunately the MS. is not entirely perfect; it contained originally
seventy-one leaves--six of which are now missing; each page contains
about eighteen to twenty-two lines. The writing is of extraordinary
beauty, and points to the fifth century.

After a short preface, the MS. bears the superscription *Gospel
according to Mary*, and on p. 77 the subscription *Apocryphon of John;*
immediately on the same page follows the title *Wisdom of Jesus Christ*,
and on p. 128 the same subscription; the next page begins without a
title, but at the end of the MS. we find the subscription *Acts of
Peter*.

The MS. therefore contains three distinct treatises, *The Gospel of
Mary* and *The Apocryphon of John* being the same piece.

<span class="margnote">The Gospel of Mary.</span>The first work begins
with the words: "Now it came to pass on one of these days, when John the
brother of James--the sons of Zebedee--had gone up to the temple, that a
Pharisee, named Ananias (?), came unto him and said unto him: 'Where is
thy Master, that thou dost not follow him?' He said unto him: 'From
whence He came thither is He gone (?).' The Pharisee said unto him:
'With deceit hath the Nazaræan deceived you, for he hath . . . you and
made away with the tradition of your fathers.' When I heard this I went
away from the temple to the mountain unto a solitary place, and was
exceedingly sorrowful in heart and said: 'How now was the Saviour
chosen; and wherefore was He sent to the world by His Father who sent
Him; and who is His Father; and what is the formation of that æon to
which we shall go?'"

<span id="page_581">p. 581</span>

While he is sunk in these thoughts, the heavens open, and the Lord
appears to him and to the disciples, in order to resolve his doubts. The
Saviour then leaves them, and again they are sorrowful and weep. They
said: "How can we go to the heathen and preach the gospel of the kingdom
of the Son of Man? If they have not received Him, how will they receive
us?"

Then Mary arose, and, having embraced them all, spake unto her brethren:
"Weep not, and be not sorrowful, nor doubt, for His grace will be with
you all and will overshadow you. Let us rather praise His goodness that
he hath prepared us, and made us to be men."

Peter requests her to proclaim what the Lord had revealed to her, thus
acknowledging the great distinction which the Lord had always permitted
her above all women. Thereupon she begins the narrative of an appearance
of the Lord in a dream; unfortunately some pages are here missing.

Hardly has she finished, when Andrew rises, and says that he cannot
believe that the Lord has given such novel teachings. Peter also rejects
her testimony and chides her. And Mary in tears says unto him: "Peter,
of what dost thou think? Believest thou that I have imagined this only
in myself, or lied as to the Lord?"

And now Levi comes forward to help Mary, and chides Peter as an eternal
quarreller. How the dispute went on we cannot determine, as two pages
are missing. On p. 21 a new episode begins and continues to the end of
the first treatise without a break.

The Lord appears again to John, and John

<span id="page_582">p. 582</span>

immediately repairs to his fellow-disciples and relates what the Saviour
had revealed unto him.

Schmidt suggests that the original title was *The Apocalypse* or
*Revelation*, and not *The Apocryphon of John*.

<span class="margnote">The Wisdom of Jesus Christ.</span>The book of the
*Wisdom of Jesus Christ* begins with the words: "After His resurrection
from the dead His twelve disciples and seven women disciples had gone
into Galilee to the mount which . . . . for they were in doubt as to the
hypostasis of the All . . . . as to the mysteries and holy economy. Then
did the Saviour appear unto them not in His prior form but in the
invisible spirit. His form was that of a great angel of light, His
substance indescribable, and He was not clothed in flesh that dieth, but
in pure, perfect flesh, as He taught us on the mountain in Galilee which
was called . . . He said: 'Peace be unto you; My peace I give unto
you.'" And they were all astonished and were afraid.

And the Lord bids them lay all their questions before Him; and the
several disciples bring forward their doubts and receive the desired
replies.

The *Acts of Peter* are likewise of Gnostic origin, and belong to the
great group of apocryphal stories of the Apostles. This third document
treats of an episode from the healing-wonders of Peter.

<span class="margnote">Irenæus Quotes from the Gospel of Mary.</span>The
importance of the whole MS. is, not only that it hands down to us three
hitherto unknown Gnostic writings, but especially that it gives us a
work which was known to Irenæus, our first important "authority" on
Gnosticism among the Fathers

<span id="page_583">p. 583</span>

a work from which he made extracts, but without giving the sources of
his information or quoting the title of the book. This work is *The
Gospel of Mary*.

Irenæus begins the last section of his first Book (29-31) with the
words: "And besides these, from among those whom we have before
mentioned as followers of Simon, a multitude of Barbēlō-Gnostics hath
arisen, and they have shown themselves as mushrooms from the ground."

In cap. 29 he treats mostly of a group of so-called Barbēlō-Gnostics,
with regard to whom he gives the contents of one of the books they used,
a teaching which we do not find put forward by either the earlier or
later hæresiarchs. Theodoret (I. 13) among the rest of the Refutators
alone knows of this teaching, and he simply copies Irenæus.

This source is our *Gospel of Mary;* and we can now for the first time
control Irenæus point by point, and see how little the Church Father
succeeded or could succeed in reproducing the exceedingly complicated
systems of the Gnostic schools. A few examples will be sufficient to
establish this point abundantly.

Irenæus begins his exposition with these words: "Some of them suppose a
certain never-ageing <span class="margnote">An Examination of his
Statements.</span> Æon in a Virginal Spirit, whom they name Barbēlō.
Where they say is a certain unnameable Father."

This "Father of All" is characterized in our new document (p. 22) as the
Invisible; as Pure <span class="margnote">The Father.</span> Light, in
which no one can see with mortal eyes; as Spirit, for no one can imagine
how He is

<span id="page_584">p. 584</span>

formed; the Everlasting, the Unspeakable; the Unnameable, for no one
existed before Him to give Him a name. Of Him it is said: "He thinketh
His Image alone and beholdeth it in the Water of Pure Light which
surroundeth Him. And His Thought energized and revealed herself, and
stood before Him in the Light-spark; which is the Power which existed
before the All, which Power hath revealed itself; which is the perfect
Forethought of the All; the Light, the Likeness of the Light, the Image
of the <span class="margnote">The Mother.</span>Invisible; that is, the
perfect Power, the Barbēlō, the Æon perfect in glory--glorifying Him,
because she hath manifested herself in Him and thinketh Him. She is the
first Thought, his Image; she becometh the First Man; that is, the
Virginal Spirit, she of the triple Manhood, the triple-powered one, the
triple-named, triple-born; the Æon which ages not, the Man-woman, who
hath come forth from His Forethought."

According to this, the "Father of the All" stands at the head of the
system, the "Invisible." After Him comes His "Image," that is, the
"Barbēlō," the "perfect Power," the "unageing Æon" of Irenæus.

By thinking of His Image, His Thought reveals herself in the
Light-spark, that is, in Barbēlō.

Irenæus gives all this in a short, incomprehensible abstract as follows:
"And that He was fain to manifest Himself to the same Barbēlō. And that
Thought came forth and stood before Him, and asked for Foreknowledge."

Our text then proceeds: "And Barbēlō besought <span class="margnote">The
Pentad.</span> Him to give unto her Foreknowledge. He nodded,

<span id="page_585">p. 585</span>

and when He had thus nodded assent, Foreknowledge manifested herself and
stood with Thought, that is Forethought, and glorified the Invisible and
the perfect Power, the Barbēlō, for that through her she had come into
existence.

"Again this Power besought that Incorruptibility be given unto her. He
nodded, and when He had thus nodded assent, Incorruptibility manifested
herself and stood with Thought and Foreknowledge, glorifying the
Invisible and Barbēlō, in that through her she had come into existence.

"For their sakes she besought that Everlasting Life be given them. He
nodded, and when He had thus nodded assent, Everlasting Life manifested
herself, and they stood and glorified Him and Barbēlō, because through
her they had come into existence in the manifestation of the Invisible
Spirit.

"This is the pentad of the Æons of the Father, that is, the First Man,
the Image of the Invisible; that is, Barbēlō, and Thought, and
Foreknowledge, and Incorruptibility and Life Everlasting."

At the request of Barbēlō, also, the Invisible causes to come forth
after Thought the three following feminine Æons, according to Irenæus;
"Thought asked for Foreknowledge; Foreknowledge also having come forth,
again upon their petition came forth Incorruptibility; then afterwards
Life Eternal; in whom Barbēlō rejoicing, and looking forth into the
greatness, and delighted with her conception, generated into it a Light
like unto it; her they affirm to be the beginning of the enlightening
and generation of all things; and that

<span id="page_586">p. 586</span>

the Father seeing this Light anointed it with His goodness to make it
perfect; and this they say is the Christ."

<span class="margnote">The Decad.</span>In this passage without doubt
Irenæus had before his eyes the words: "He is the decad of the Æons,
that is, He is the Father of the ingenerable Father. Barbēlō gazed into
Him fixedly . . . and she gave birth to a blessed Light-spark. Nor doth
it differ from her in greatness. This is the Alone-begotten, who hath
manifested himself in the Father, the self-generated God, the first-born
Son of the All, the pure Light-spirit. Now the Invisible Spirit rejoiced
over the Light, which had come into existence, which had first of all
manifested itself in the first Power--that is, His Forethought--in
Barbēlō. And He anointed him with His goodness, that he might be made
perfect."

This Alone-begotten is consequently identical with the Light or the
Christ. Irenæus offers us here no enlightenment, and further on he only
gives us the sentence: Therefore the First Angel, who stands near the
Alone-begotten," etc.

The Alone-begotten asks for Mind to be given him; when this has been
done, he praises, as Mind, the Father and Barbēlō.

Irenæus continues: "And this, they say, is Christ; who again requests,
as they say, that Mind may be given to help him; and then came forth
Mind; and after these the Father sends forth the Word."

In this place Irenæus has omitted a stage and quite forgotten the third
male Æon, namely, Will. Our MS. gives us the following:

<span id="page_587">p. 587</span>

"The Invisible Spirit willed to energize. His Will energized and
revealed itself and stood with the Mind and the Light praising Him. The
Word followed the Will, for through the Word hath Christ created all
things."

With this the upper Ogdoad is shut off from the Decad, the lower æon
proceeding from separate pairs. <span class="margnote">The
Christ.</span> Next we have the Self-begotten from Thought, the Word, of
whom it is written: "Whom He hath honoured with great honour, because he
came forth from His first Thought. The Invisible hath set him as God
over the All. The True God gave him all powers, and made the Truth that
is in Him subject unto him, that he might think out the All."

Irenæus reproduces this as follows: "Then afterwards, of Mind and the
Word, they say, was sent forth the Self-begotten, to represent the Great
Light, and that he was highly honoured, and all things made subject unto
him. And the Truth was sent out also with him, and that there is a
conjunction of the Self-begotten and Truth."

(It is impossible at present to attempt to analyze the system from the
above fragments; it may, however, be suggested that the treatise is here
exposing the three root-phases, or moments of emanation, of the Plērōma,
or ideal world: (a) the In-generable, (b) the Self-generable, and (c)
the Generable--the Father, the Logos, the All. The Gnosis, however, is
more elaborate than any other known system, and its idealistic
intuitions of primal processes know no limits.)

<span id="page_588">p. 588</span>

From the Light of the Christ and the Incorruptible proceed forth four
great Lights to surround the Self-begotten. Their names are Harmozel,
Ōroiael, Daveithe and Eleleth. From Will and Everlasting Life proceed
four others: Charis, Synesis, Aisthesis and Phronesis. Irenæus writes:

"And from the Light which is Christ, and Incorruptibility, four
Luminaries were sent forth to surround the Self-begotten; and that from
Will again and Life Everlasting, four such emanations were sent forth to
minister under the four Luminaries, which they call Grace (Charis),
Free-will (Thelesis), Understanding (Synesis), and Prudence (Phronesis).
And that Charis for her part was conjoined with the great and first
Luminary; and this they will have to be the Saviour, and call him
Harmogen; and Thelesis with the second, whom also they call Raguel; and
Synesis with the third, whom they name David; and Phronesis with the
fourth, whom they name Eleleth."

This passage is of interest in many ways. We learn the correct names; we
notice that three of them (Eleleth, Daveithe, Ōroiael) are also to be
found in the Codex Brucianus, and thus we establish the relation of this
important Codex with the first piece in our MS.

<span class="margnote">The Egyptian Origin of the Treatise.</span>These
proofs are sufficient to establish the point that *The Gospel of Mary*
was composed before <span class="small">A.D.</span> 180, and that the
Greek original, from which the Coptic translation was made, was earlier
than Irenæus. In the opinion of Dr. Schmidt, the work originated in
Egypt. The School which used it was the same as that designated by

<span id="page_589">p. 589</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Irenæus as the
Barbēlō-Gnostics, or, as they usually called themselves, simply the
Gnostics; this School was further subdivided into many single
denominations, whose names and teachings Epiphanius has given us in
detail. Among them were circulated many books under the name of Mary;
thus Epiphanius (*Hær*., xxvi. 8) speaks of *The Questions of Mary*,
both *The Great* and *The Little*, and even in xii. of *The Genealogy of
Mary*. Celsus had previously also met with this School, and perhaps was
acquainted with our work, for he informs us that some heretics derive
their origin from Mary and Martha, and gives the well-known diagram of
the so-called Ophites. Yet more; our original work shows us that Irenæus
"copied" from our book only up to a certain place; and in I. 30, he used
a second work of the same School which had fallen into his hands.

So far Dr. Schmidt, whose interesting communication is followed by a
note of Professor Harnack. Harnack gives his opinion as follows:

"This find is of the first importance to primitive Church history; not
only because we have one <span class="margnote">The Opinion of
Harnack.</span> (or perhaps three) original Gnostic works of the second
century--(is the *Wisdom of Jesus Christ* possibly the famous work of
Valentinus?)--but kind fate has also added to our debt that Irenæus has
quoted from one of the three treatises. We are thus for the first time
in a position to control by the original the presentation of a Gnostic
system as rendered by the Church Father. The result of this examination
shows, as we might

<span id="page_590">p. 590</span>

have expected, that owing to omissions, and because no effort was made
to understand his opponents, the sense of the by no means absurd
speculations of the Gnostics has been ruined by the Church Father.
Another fact--which can only with the greatest difficulty be extracted
from the writings of their opponents--is that the system treats of a
psychological process within the first principle, which the Gnostics
desired to unfold. Tertullian certainly says once (*Adv. Valent.*, iv.):
'Ptolemæus, the pupil of Valentinus, split up the names and numbers of
the æons into personified "substances," external to deity, whereas
Valentinus himself had included these in the very summit of the godhead
as the impressions of sensation and feeling'--but which of the Church
Fathers has given himself the trouble thus to understand the
speculations of Valentinus and of the other Gnostics?

"According to Hippolytus (*Philos.*, vi. 42), the followers of the
Gnostic Marcus complained of the misrepresentation of their teaching by
Irenæus; the followers of our newly discovered book could also have
complained of the incomprehensible fashion in which Irenæus had
represented their teachings.

"Thus, we had previously known a Gnostic work which probably originated
in Egypt in the second century, only through an epitome of it by a
Gallic bishop about the year 185, and now we find it again in a Coptic
translation of the fifth century--verily a paradoxical method of
transmission!"

If, however, the last chapters of Book I. of Irenæus are copied from the
lost Syntagma of Justin or some

<span id="page_591">p. 591</span>

other earlier work, as the best critics have previously maintained, then
the original of our new document has a considerably earlier date than
Schmidt or Harnack assign to it in the above Transaction.

The student of Gnosticism will at once perceive that the importance of
the new find cannot be over-estimated. <span class="margnote">The
Importance of the MS.</span> The new documents throw light not only on
the Codex Brucianus, but also on the system of the *Pistis Sophia*. We
have now these three original sources on which to base our study of
Gnostic theosophy; and there is hope that at last something may be done
to rescue the views of the best Gnostic doctors from obscurity, and from
the environment of pious refutation in which they have been previously
smothered. The task of the sympathetic student should now be to find
appropriate terms for the technicalities of the Gnosis, place the
various orders of ideas in their proper relation, and show that the
method of the Gnosis, which looked at the problems of cosmogony and
anthropogony from above, may be as reasonable in its proper domain as
are the methods of modern scientific research, which regard such
problems entirely from below. We should not forget that men like
Valentinus were theosophists, engaged on precisely the same studies as
their brethren the world over. The greatest cosmogonies of the world are
of the same nature as Gnostic cosmogenesis, and a study of these will
convince us of the similarity of source. Gnostic anthropogenesis has
many points of similarity with general theosophical ideas, and Gnostic
psychology is in a great measure borne out by recent research. The

<span id="page_592">p. 592</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Gnostic technical
terms are no more difficult of comprehension than those found in other
theosophical writers; and there is an exact parallel between the varying
use made of such terms by different writers on the Gnosis and the
misrepresentation of the views of the Gnostics by the Church Fathers,
and the various meanings given to like terms by other theosophical
writers and the misrepresentation of such writers by their critics. The
Gnostics were themselves partly to blame for their obscurity, and the
Church Fathers were partly to blame for their misrepresentation. In
brief, the same standard of criticism has to be applied to the writings
of the Gnostics as the discriminating student has to apply to all such
literature. It is true that to-day we speak openly of many things that
the Gnostics wrapped up in symbol and myth; nevertheless our real
knowledge on such subjects is not so very far in advance of the great
doctors of the Gnosis as we are inclined to imagine; now, as then, there
are only a few who really know what they are writing about, while the
rest copy, compare, adapt, and speculate.
