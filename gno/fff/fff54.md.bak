### THE NUMBER-SYMBOLISM OF MARCUS.

A LONG section in Irenæus is our almost exclusive source for a knowledge
of Marcus and his followers. <span class="margnote">Sources.</span>
Hippolytus and Epiphanius simply copy Irenæus and add nothing but new
terms of condemnation, while our information from other sources is a
question of lines and not of paragraphs. The unreliability of Irenæus as
a chronicler of Gnostic views is already known to our readers, and in
the case of Marcus and the Marcosians is more painfully patent than
usual. It seems that some of the adherents of the school were to be
found even among the rude populace of the Rhone valley, and the worthy
Presbyter of Lyons was especially anxious to discount their influence.
He begins the attack by retailing all the scandalous stories he can
collect about Marcus, a man he had never seen, and who had not been
nearer to the sheepfold of Lyons than Asia Minor, or at best Egypt!

Irenæus professes first of all to describe what took place at the
initiation-ceremonies and secret rites of the Marcosians, and paints a
graphic picture of charlatanry and debauchery, much to his own
satisfaction. To all of these reports and descriptions, however, the
Marcosians gave a most emphatic denial, and therefore we shall not at
present trouble the reader with the Presbyter's statements on the
subject, except to remark that he himself acknowledges that he depends
entirely on hearsay, and to point out to the student that the account
seems to be a very

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

distorted caricature of the ceremonies, the ritual of which is partly
preserved to us directly in the Askew Codex and one of the MSS. of the
Codex Brucianus.

Irenæus next proceeds to give a *résumé* of a Marcosian MS. which had
fallen into his hands. He apparently quotes some passages verbatim, but
for the most part contents himself with a summary, so that we can by no
means be sure what the writer of the document really said. The original
of the document Irenæus ascribes to Marcus himself, whom throughout the
whole section he apostrophises as a contemporary; it is, however,
probable that this is merely rhetorical--as is the case with Hippolytus,
who, thirty or forty years afterwards, in his opening paragraph,
predicts that the result of his exposure of Marcus will be that "he
*will now* desist \[from his imposture\]," although the body of the
Gnostic doctor had long been laid in the grave.

Of Marcus himself we know nothing beyond the fact that he was one of the
earlier pupils of Valentinus, or at any rate belonged to the earlier
circle of Valentinian ideas. His date is vaguely placed somewhere about
the middle of the second century; he is said to have taught in Asia
Minor, and Jerome, two hundred years afterwards, states that he was an
Egyptian.

To the student of Gnosticism who regards the Gnostic doctors as cultured
men who made a <span class="margnote">Number-letters</span> brave effort
to formulate Christianity as a universal philosophy, or rather as a
divine science springing from the ground of a philosophy of religion,
the attempt of Marcus to adapt the Hebrew number-letter

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

system, devised by "kabalistic" Rabbis, to the Greek alphabet, and so
work out a number-symbolism for the too abstruse æon-genesis and
world-process of the Gnosis, is a point of great interest. It may,
however, be that the Hebrews copied from the Greeks; or that both
derived this method from Egypt.

As must be patent to everyone, the methods of symbolism of the Gnostics
were very numerous; many attempts were made to convey to the physical
consciousness some idea of the modes, not only of superphysical
existence, but also of what was definitely stated to be suprarational
being. That these attempts were all doomed to failure, as far as general
comprehension was concerned, is no reason for us to deride the efforts
made; that we have not even to-day, with all our elaborate mathematical
formulæ, evolved a sufficient symbolism, is no reason for denying the
possibility of such an achievement within certain limits in future ages.

Marcus attempted this gigantic task with insufficient means, it is true,
with means too that appear to our prosaic minds to-day as fantastic and
even worthless; nevertheless he was not without a tradition that to some
extent justified his making the attempt.

The ancient religion of the Chaldæans was astronomical and mathematical;
cosmogenesis and evolution were worked out in the symbolism of numbers.
Every letter of the sacred language had a certain numerical equivalent,
and thus words and sentences could be constructed which could be
interpreted numerically, and be finally made

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

explanatory of natural and celestial phenomena and processes. Since the
sacred books of the "Mathematicians" are said to have been written with
this definite object in view, the mathematical key given to the initiate
into the ancient star-lore of Chaldæa, might thus open the door to the
sacred science of nature and man as known to the seers of that ancient
civilisation.

The Rabbis of the Jews, on their return from captivity, presumably
brought with them some <span class="margnote">Kabalism.</span> notions
of this method of number-letters, and later on proceeded to turn it to
account as a means, both of explaining away much that was distasteful to
the cultured mind in their ancient traditions, and of reading into the
old cosmogonic and patriarchal fables new and spiritual meanings,
derived to a large extent from their contact with Oriental ideas during
the years of captivity and subsequently. This method of mystical
exegesis by number-letters was developed to a marvellous extent by the
Hellenising tendencies of the cultured Rabbis among the Diaspora; and
Egypt, and especially Alexandria, was on; of the main centres of this
peculiar learning. A relic of this number-system has come down to the
present times with the tradition of the Kabalah. It is to be observed,
however, that the Rabbis *adapted* the system to a heterogeneous library
of works of various dates and many recensions, which were not originally
composed with this end in view. True, they believed that every word and
letter of the Law had been directly inspired by God, and thus contained
a wonderful magical potency, but the relentless logic

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

of modern Biblical research has to a large extent overturned this fond
hypothesis, and their pious number-processes must now for the most part
be regarded as the development of apologetic Rabbinism, and as
legitimate only for such small parts of the documents as may have been
composed in Babylon by scribes who were already versed in the Chaldaic
method.

There is little doubt that Valentinus and his pupils were acquainted
with all there was to learn at Alexandria of Rabbinical exegesis, in
which the hopes of the Jews were more than ever centred after the
destruction of the second temple in <span class="small">A.D.</span> 70.
They were also perfectly familiar with the Pythagorean
number-philosophy, the symbolism of which no doubt had many resemblances
to the number-books of the ancient Chaldeans. It is therefore but little
surprising to find that one of them busied himself with adapting this
ancient method of symbolism (if indeed it was not already native to
Grecian tradition) to the Greek alphabet, in which the documents of the
new faith, and, as they firmly believed, the new world-science, were now
almost exclusively written. Needless to say, the Greek alphabet would
not stand the strain; nevertheless it was a good exercise for a pupil of
the Gnosis, and offered wide scope for the use of much ingenuity.

This exercise in correspondences was naturally no contribution to
knowledge, but only a means of conveying knowledge otherwise acquired.
It will, however, be of interest to give the reader a brief sketch of
some of Marcus’ ideas, as far as it is possible

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

to recover them from the contemptuous summary of the Marcosian MS. by
Irenæus in his polemic. They are also additionally interesting as
showing intimate points of contact with the Coptic treatises we have so
often referred to.

The source of the document's inspiration is ascribed to the Supernal
Four, the highest hierarchy of the Plērōma, which however only reveals
itself to mortals in its "feminine" form, for the world cannot bear the
power and effulgence of its "masculine" greatness. The same idea is
current in India. The God (Deva) uses his power, the Goddess (Shakti,
Devī), as his means of communication with mortals; his own form no
mortal can behold and live. The whole of what follows is based upon the
Greek texts of Hippolytus (Duncker and Schneidewin) and Epiphanius
(Dindorf)--who copied from the lost Greek text of Irenæus--and upon the
oft-times unintelligent and barbarous Latin version of the Greek
original of Irenæus (Stieren).

The MS. apparently opened with the following passage descriptive of the
speaking forth of the Word of the Supernal Father.

"When first the Father, the not even the One, beyond all possibility of
thought and being, who is <span class="margnote">The Great Name.</span>
neither male nor female, willed that His ineffability should come into
being, and His invisibility take form, He opened His mouth and uttered a
Word, like unto Himself; who, appearing before Him, became the means of
His seeing what He himself was--namely Himself appearing in the form of
His own invisibility."

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

Now the utterance of the Great Name was on this wise. The Father spake
the Word; the first note of His Name was a sound of four elements; the
second sound was also of four elements; the third of ten; the fourth and
last of twelve. Thus the utterance of the whole Name was of thirty
elements and four sounds or groupings.

After the words "the first note of His Name was a sound of four
elements," Irenæus has dragged into his summary a suggestion of his own,
probably derived from some numerical exegesis of the Prologue to the
fourth Gospel, which he had come across elsewhere in his heresy-hunt.
Thus he evidently breaks into the thread of the summary with the
interjected note, "namely ἀρχή," the "Beginning" of the Prologue.

Further, each single element of the thirty has its own peculiar
utterance, character, letters, configurations and images. But no element
is acquainted with the form of the sound of which it is an element; in
fact, so far from knowing its parent-sound, it pays no attention even to
the utterance of its associate elements in its own sound-hierarchy, but
only to its own utterance.

Thus uttering all that it knows, it thinks it is sounding forth the
whole Name. For each of the elements, being a part of the whole Name,
enunciates its own peculiar sound as the whole Word, and does not cease
sounding until it arrives at the very last letter of the last
sub-element in its own peculiar tongue.

Now the consummation or restitution of all, things

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

takes place when all these original elements, coming to one and the same
letter or note, send forth one and the same utterance, a symbol of which
was the chanting of the sacred word "Amen" in unison. It was these notes
of the scale of the Primordial Harmony which were the means of giving
form to the Living Æon, which transcended all idea of substance and
generation. To such forms the Lord referred when speaking of "the angels
who continually behold the face of the Father."

The ordinary spoken names for these elements are: æons, words, roots,
seeds, plenitudes (plerōmata), fruits. The "spoken" names are
distinguished from the "authentic" names, or *mysticæ voces*, many
instances of the cypher-equivalents of which will be found in the Coptic
Codices.

Now every divine element, with all its sub-sounds, notes, or letters,
was contained in the phase of the Divine Being to which the symbolic
name of Church had been given. The term "Church" (Ecclesia) means the
"Calling Forth," the Heritage of the Elect, a substitute for an
"authentic" name, which was only revealed to the initiated members of
the school. The Church was the female aspect of the fourth and last
syzygy, or pair, of the Tetrad, or Holy Four, the Lords of the Plērōma.

When the last note of the last sub-element of these supernal elements
had uttered its own <span class="margnote">The Echo of the Name.</span>
peculiar sound, the echo of it went forth, in the image of all these
elements and sub-elements, and gave birth to another series; and it is
this series which is the cause not only of the elements

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

of the world which we know, but also of those elements which have a
prior existence to those of our world.

The last divine note itself, of which echo rang on echo downwards, was
wafted upwards by its own parent-sound to complete and consummate the
whole Name; while the echo descended to the parts below, and remained as
though cast out of the Plērōma.

This parent-sound or element, from which the last note, containing
potentially the utterance of the parent-sound, descended below,
consisted of thirty letters or elements, and each of these contains
other letters or elements, by means of which the name of each
root-element is spelt, and so on infinitely. That is to say, the
sub-elements as it were spell out the name, or manifest the power, of
the main element; and the power or name of each sub-element in turn is
manifested or spelt by other minor sub-elements, and so on infinitely.

Marcus brought home this grand idea to the minds of his pupils by
pointing out an analogy in the Greek alphabet. Thus take any single
letter, say Δ, delta; as soon as you name it, you have five letters,
namely, Δ delta, Ε epsilon, Λ lambda, Τ tau, Α alpha. Again Ε, epsilon,
is resolved into E epsilon, Ψ psi, Ι iota, Λ lambda, Ο omicron, Ν nu;
and so on infinitely. The illustration is certainly graphic enough.

<span class="margnote">The Symbolic Body of the Man of Truth.</span>The
Gnostic MS. then proceeded to describe a method of symbolizing the Great
Body of the Heavenly Man, whereby the twenty-four letters of the Greek
alphabet were assigned in pairs to the

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

twelve "limbs." The Body of the Heavenly Man was the graphic symbol of
the ideal economy, dispensation, or ordering of the universe, its
regions, planes, hierarchies and powers.

This symbolic representation was called the schema or configuration of
the one element (τό σχῆμα τοῦ στοχείου), and also the glyph (or
character) of the figure (or diagram) of the Man of Truth, presumably
the God of Truth of the Codex Brucianus, one of the treatises of which
contains a whole series of diagrams of the various moments of emanation
of the creative deity under this designation.

In the phrase "glyph of the figure" (ὁ χαρακτὴρ τοῦ γράμματος), the word
γράμμα is means either (i.) a letter of the alphabet, or (ii.) a note of
music, or (iii.) a mathematical figure or diagram. The character, glyph,
or configuration, would thus be the symbol or reflection of the
super-spiritual Plērōma, regarded (i.) as the last letter of the
four-lettered Great Name, or (ii.) as the last note of the Divine
Harmony which is sung forth by the Supernal Logos or Word. To avoid
complication and symbols of symbols, we have taken the word γράμμα in
its third sense, in which it declares its consanguinity with the great
art of systematising the elements and powers of nature, known in India
as *tantra* ("systematising," "ordering.") Tāntrika is now a Janus-faced
art, white and black, and its main feature is the drawing of magical
diagrams (*yantras*), to represent the configuration of the elements and
powers which the operator desires to use.

I omit here all mention of Mark's diagram of the

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

body of the Heavenly Man, as the consideration of it would take up too
much space in these short sketches.

Now the Word, the male energy of the middle pair or syzygy of the
trinity (Mind-Truth, Word-Life, Man-Church) and the sum of the six,
issued forth from the mouth of Truth. This Word is the Logos or Supreme
Reason of all things, the self-generator of the universe, who bestows
fatherhood (πατροδότορα λόγον) on all things. On earth this Word becomes
the name known commonly to all Christians, namely, Christ Jesus. But
Jesus is only the sound of the name down here and not the power of the
name. Jesus is really a substitute for a very ancient name, and its
power is known to the "elect" alone of the Christians.

It is the six-lettered name. But even this is only a symbol; among the
æons of the Plērōma it is manifold, and of another form and type, and
this is known only to them who are akin to the Logos in their hearts,
those whose angels or greatnesses are with Him for all time.

Now the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, attached to the various
limbs of the Body of the Heavenly Man in the diagram, are the symbols,
or images, of the emanations of the three powers which contain the sum
total or Plērōma of the æonic elements above. And there is a further
analogy to their nature in the alphabet. For there are nine consonants
(or soundless letters), eight liquids (or semi-sounds), and seven vowels
(or sounds).

The consonants symbolise the ineffable or soundless

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

elements of Mind-and-Truth; the liquids, midway between the soundless
letters and the sounds, typify the elements of Word-and-Life, which
receive the emanation from the unmanifested above, and receive back the
ascent from the manifested below; and the vowels represent the elements
of Man-and-Church, for sound going forth through the Man enformed all
things. For the echo of His voice investured them with form.

This reminds us of the elaborated division of the Platonic world of
ideas into three spaces: (1) noëtic; (2) both noëtic and noëric; and (3)
noëric. (See my essay on Orpheus).

Thus we have the series 9, 8, 7; and if we take 1 from 9 and add it to
7, we get 8, 8, 8--or Jesus, the <span class="margnote">The
Numbers.</span> six-lettered name (ἰησοῦς), the numerical values of the
letters of which amount to 888. That is to say, He who had his seat with
the Father (Mind), left his seat and descended, sent forth to the one
from whom He was separated (the Church), to restore the divine creation
to a state of equilibrium, in order that, the unities of the Plērōmas
(or three phases of the Plērōma or ideal cosmos) being reduced to an
equality, there might be a common product of a single power from all of
them in all of them. Thus the 7 obtained the power of the 8, and the
three spaces became equal in their numbers, namely, 3 eights, and these
added together are 24.

Now these three spaces or elements are each twofold (positive and
negative), 6 in all, and these again fourfold, 24 in all, the reflection
of the elements of the Unnameable, in dyads, triads and tetrads.

Moreover, if you would find the 6 among the 24

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

letters of the alphabet, which are only images of the real elements, you
will find it hidden in the double letters Ξ (κς), Ψ (πς), Ζ (δς). Add
this 6 to the 24 and we have again a symbol of the 30 æons of the
Plērōma.

<span class="margnote">Gospel Exegesis.</span>With much ingenuity our
Gnostics found these numbers and processes in the prologue to Genesis,
and elsewhere in the Old Covenant library; we need not, however, follow
them into this field of letter-numbering. But when we find that they
treated the Gospel-legends also not as history, but as allegory, and not
only as allegory, but as symbolic of the drama of initiation, the matter
becomes of deep interest for the theosophical student.

Thus they said that the transfiguration-story was symbolic (ἐν ὁμοιώματι
εἰκόνος) of the divine economy as manifested in the man seeking
perfection; in other words, of a certain stage of initiation.

To make this further apparent, we will use terms already familiar to
some of our readers.

After "six days," that is to say, in the seventh stage since the
disciple first set his feet on the path, he ascended into the
"mountain"--a graphic symbol for the higher states of consciousness.

He ascended the fourth and became the sixth. That is to say, he ascended
with three and was joined by two, the Peter, James and John, and Moses
and Elias of the familiar Gospel-narrative.

The "three" are the powers he had already won over the gross, subtle and
mental planes--presumably the degrees of *srotāpanna*, *sakadāgamin* and
*anāgāmin* in the Buddhist tradition. The "two"

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

are the representatives of the spiritual and divine powers which welcome
and support him, and thus he becomes sixth, or possessed of the
spiritual consciousness, while still in the body,--the *arahat* stage.

It was this "six," said the Marcosians, which had descended and been
detained in the Hebdomad, or region of the seven spheres of difference;
the "six" being in reality of the same essence as the World-mother, the
eighth encircling sphere of sameness, which is above or beyond these
seven. The six (the arahat) being thus of the same essence as the
World-mother (Wisdom) contains essentially in himself the whole number
of all the elements or powers--a fact already typified in the stage
symbolised in the baptism-myth by the descent of the dove. The dove is
the Alpha and Omega (1 and 800) of the diagram, the first and last of
the numbers, representing the head. Moreover the word for "dove" in
Greek is περιστερά, and 80 (π) + 5 (ε) + 100 (ρ) + 10 (ι) + 200 (σ) +
300 (τ) + 5 (e) + 100 (ρ) + 1 (α) = 801.

Again, it was on the "sixth day," the "preparation," that the divine
economy, or order of things, manifested the "last man," the "man from
heaven," for the new birth or regeneration of the "first man" or "man of
the earth"; and further the passion began in the sixth hour and ended in
the sixth hour, when the initiate was nailed to the cross. All of which
was designed to indicate the power of creation (inception) and
regeneration or rebirth (consummation), typified in the number 6, to
those who were admitted to the mysteries of initiation, called by the
Marcosian writer the "Sons of the Light," or

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Sons of the Man,"
for the Greek will carry both meanings.

For creation or descent is represented by the number 2, that is to say
by dyads, and regeneration or ascent by the number 3, that is to say by
triads, and 2 × 3 = 6.

<span class="margnote">The Creation of the Sensible World.</span>Now as
to the creation of the sensible universe: the Logos, as creator, uses as
his minister, or servant, the seven-numbered "greatness" (that is to
say, the septenary hierarchy of the ideal universe, the Plērōma or Mind
of the Logos, symbolized by the seven vowels), in order that the fruit
of His self-meditated meditation may be manifested.

The creation of our particular universe (or solar system), however, is
regarded as a fabrication, or building, according to a type in the
Divine Mind. The creative fabricator or builder is, as it were, a
reflection of the universal Logos, enformed by Him, but as it were
separated or cut off, and thus remaining apart from or outside the
Plērōma. It is by the power and purpose of the Divine Logos, that the
demiurgic power, by means of his own emanation or life (the reflection
of the Life of the Plērōma), ensouled the cosmos of seven powers,
according to the similitude of the septenary power above, and thus was
constituted the soul of the visible all, our cosmos. The demiurge makes
use of this work as though it had come into existence through his own
will alone; but the seven spheres of the world-soul (the cosmic
life)--copies of the æonic spheres which no cosmic spheres can really
represent--are in reality hand-maidens to the will of the Divine Life,
the supernal Mother.

<span id="page_373">p. 373</span>

Now the first of these seven spheres, or heavens, sounds forth the sound
or vowel Α, the second the Ε, the third the Η, the fourth and midmost
the Ι, the fifth the Ο, the sixth the Υ, and the seventh and fourth from
the middle the Ω. And all uniting together in harmony send forth a sound
and glorify him by whom they were emanated (the system-logos or
world-builder); and the glory of the sound is carried up to the
Forefather of the Plērōma (the Divine Logos), while the echo of their
hymn of glory is borne to earth, and becomes the modeller and generator
of them upon the earth, that is to say the souls of men.

Irenæus now appears to have come to the end of the MS., and so proceeds
to give the friend to whom he is writing, as many other details of
Marcosian ideas as he has picked up from scraps of quotations or from
hearsay,--"*quæ ad nos pervenneruut ex iis*" (c. xv.). He returns once
more to a consideration of the eternal economy of the Plērōma, and to an
exposition from which he has already quoted a scrap in another
connection (c. xi. 3), as follows:

"Before all universes there is a source (or beginning) before the primal
source, prior even to that state which is inconceivable, ineffable,
unnameable, <span class="margnote">The Tetraktys.</span> which I number
as Noughtness. With this No-number consubsists a power to which I give
the name Oneness. This Noughtness and Oneness, which are in reality one,
emanated, although they did not really emanate, the intelligible (or
ideal) source of all, ingenerable and invisible, to which speech gives
the name of Monad (or Nought).

<span id="page_374">p. 374</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> With this Monad
consubsists a power of equal substance (ὁμοούσιος) with it, which I call
One. These powers, Noughtness, Oneness, Nought and One, send forth the
rest of the emanations of the æons.

"Noughtness" (lit., "monadity") is the root of the monad, the **O** or
circle containing all the numbers--the no-number.

This passage shows the distinct influence of Basilides but among the
best critics opinions are divided as to whether it should be assigned to
Marcus or Heracleon.

The names of this highest tetrad or tetraktys, however, are really
incapable of representation in human speech; they are the "holy of
holies," names known to the Son alone, while even He does not know what
the Four really are, this final knowledge of the one reality being
referred to the Father alone.

These names pertain to the "sacred language," specimens of which are
given in the fragments from the *Books of the Saviour* attached to the
*Pistis Sophia* document and in two of the treatises of the Codex
Brucianus.

The substitutes for these names are: Ineffable (ἄῤῥητος) and Silence
(σειγή), Father (πατήρ) and Truth (ἀλήθεια); the Greek words for which
consist respectively of 7 and 5, and 5 and 7 letters, or twice 7 and
twice 5, the 24 elements of the Plērōma.

So also with the substitutes for the names of the second tetrad: Word
(λόγος) and Life (ζωή), Man (ἄνθρωπος) and Church (ἐκκλησία); the Greek
names consisting respectively of 5 and 3, and 8 and 8 letters--in all
24.

<span id="page_375">p. 375</span>

Again the spoken or effable name of the Saviour, Jesus (ἰησοῦς),
consists of 6 letters, while His ineffable name consists of 24. As
stated above, the name = 888, and thus, by another permutation, = 24.

Similar number-permutations are also found in the letters of the word
Christ.

But enough of this apparent forcing of an unwilling alphabet into the
arms of a number-symbolism--perhaps the reader will say. The Marcosians,
however, might in the first place plead in excuse the example of Philo
and Alexandrine Judaism, which believed not only in the literal
inspiration of the Hebrew text of the Old Covenant, but also that the
Greek version of the so-called Seventy was written by the finger of God;
and in the second, they might perhaps have said: The Greek names for the
æons are but substitutes for other names which have these
number-equivalents, and pertain to the secrets of our initiation.

The really scientific part of the system is the number-process as a
natural symbolism of primeval evolution; it is not enough to label this
Pythagoreanism and so dismiss it with a sneer, for all our modern
physical science is based upon exactly the same considerations of
measure and number.

Now the One contains in itself implicitly the three incomprehensibles,
Noughtness, Oneness and Nought. <span class="margnote">Theological
Arithmetic.</span> Thus the One is the representative of the upper
tetrad. And since all numbers come from the One, this tetrad is called
the All-Mother, or Wisdom Above. From her proceeds as a daughter, the
lower tetrad, the comprehensible numbers, the 1, 2,

<span id="page_376">p. 376</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> 3 and the 4, the
Wisdom Below, which must be regarded as 8 potentially, seeing that the 1
manifests the unmanifestable One, the representative of the
unmanifestable tetrad. The Wisdom below is thus reckoned as 8, or the
ogdoad. But this ogdoad contains the decad, for 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. And
this decad by congress with the 8 makes 80, and by congress with the 8
and itself makes 800; so that the 8, or world-mother, is separated into
three spaces, 8, 80, and 800, in all 888, which is the number of her
enforming power or consort Jesus, the creative Logos from above, the 1 +
2 + 3, or 6, the consort of the 4 or last number of the lower tetrad.

This enformation of the world-substance by means of the decad--by means
of the creative 888 or "Jesus"--was the "enformation according to
substance"; but there was another enformation of a higher kind, by means
of the "Christ," the "enformation according to knowledge." This was the
regeneration by means of the dodecad. Now 6 x 2 = 12; (1 + 2 + 3) × 2 =
12; 10 + 2 = 12; 8 + 4 = 12.

The 8 + 4 is the ogdoad with the first tetrad added to it; the 10 + 2 is
the decad with the twin powers of the upper and lower tetrads added to
it; the (1 + 2 + 3) × 2, or 6 × 2 is the doubling of the enforming power
or its ascent into itself.

<span class="margnote">Jesus the Master.</span>These eternal types and
processes were to be seen in nature and history. Thus in the case of the
great Master, just as the world-soul was in ignorance before she was
fashioned and regenerated, so were men in ignorance and error before the
coming of the Great One, Jesus. He took flesh as Jesus, in

<span id="page_377">p. 377</span>

order that He might descend to the perception of men on earth. And they
who recognized Him ceased from Ignorance, and ascended from Death unto
Life, His "Name," or Power, leading them unto the Father of Truth. For
it was the will of the All-Father to put an end to Ignorance and destroy
Death. And the ending of Ignorance is the Knowledge (ἐπίγνωσις) of Him
(the Christ). For this reason a man was chosen by His will whose
constitution was after the image of the power above (the lower tetrad),
that is to say, sufficiently developed to act as a fit vehicle.

Now the lower tetrad is spoken of as Word and Life, Man and Church. And
powers emanating from these four Holy Ones watch over the birth and
mould the lower vehicles of the Jesus on earth. And this, it was said,
was shown clearly in the allegorical scripture. "Gabriel" takes the
place of the Word (Reason or Logos), the "Holy Spirit" that of the Life,
the "Power of the Highest" that of the Man, and the "Virgin" that of the
Church.

Again, at the baptism there descended upon the Jesus, thus perfectly
constituted (or enformed according to substance), the dove, which soars
again to heaven, its upward course completing the Jesus (or 6) and
making him into the Christ (or 12), the enformation according to
knowledge, or perfect illumination. And in the Christ subsists the seed
of them who descend and ascend with Him. And the power of the Christ
which descends is the seed of the Plērōma, containing in itself both the
Father and the Son, and the unnameable power of Silence, the Mother,

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (which is only
known through them), and the rest of the æons. Now this power of
Silence, this Peace and Comfort, is the Holy Spirit. It was this Spirit
which spoke through the mouth of Jesus in the Gospel-narratives, and
proclaimed itself as Son of Man, and revealed the Father, descending on
Jesus and becoming one with Him. It was this Saviour who put an end to
death, by the removal of ignorance, and Jesus made Him known as his
Father, the Christ.

Jesus is really the name of the man who was perfected in his lower
nature (that is to say, the initiate); but because of its adaptability
and formation the name has been given to the Man who was to descend into
him (in other words, the Master). And he who was the vehicle of this
Great One, had thus in him both the Man and Word and Father and the
Ineffable, and Silence and Truth and Life and Church (for the Master is
one who is at-one with these).

After three sections of abuse, Irenæus resumes the subject of Marcosian
number-correspondences in cap. xvi.; but the reading of the key-passage
which deals with the imperfections of the dodecad and the consequent
"passion" of the cosmic soul and individual souls is so faulty that, as
yet, I have been able to make nothing out of it.

<span class="margnote">The "Moving Image of Eternity."</span>With cap.
xvii., however, the æonic types are traced in the economy of the cosmos.
The two tetrads are shown in the four elements fire, water, earth, and
air, and their four characteristics, hot, cold, dry, and moist. The
decad is shown in the seven spheres, and the eighth which encompasses
them, and in addition the sun and moon. This

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

clearly shows that the "seven spheres" are not the "planets," of either
astrology or astronomy. Finally the dodecad is shown in the so-called
zodiacal circle.

Now the motion of these seven spheres is exceedingly rapid, whereas the
eighth sphere, or heaven, is much slower than the motion of the seven
mutually interpenetrating spheres, and as it were balances or checks
their otherwise too rapid motion by pressure on their periphery; the
result is that the whole mass takes some 30 years to pass through a
sign, or a twelfth part, of the zodiacal belt. This retarding sphere was
thus regarded as an image of the Great Boundary which surrounds the
"Mother of thirty names" or Plērōma. Again, the moon encompasses its
"heaven," the lower boundary, in 30 days; and the sun completes its
cyclic return in 12 months. There are moreover 12 hours in every day,
and each hour is divided into thirty parts, according to the 12 great
divisions of the zodiac, each of which has again 30 sub-divisions, 360
in all; the earth again has 12 climates. All of which is doubtless to be
referred to the tradition of the common source of the ancient Chaldæan
and Egyptian religions.

For the world-fabricator, or time-spirit, when he desired to copy the
infinite, æonian, invisible and timeless nature of Eternity, was not
able to make a model of its abiding and eternal nature, seeing that he
himself was the result of a deficiency in this eternal nature; so he
represented Eternity in times and seasons, and numbers of many years,
thinking by a manifold number of times to imitate its infinitude. Thus
it was that truth abandoned him and he

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

followed after a lie; and therefore when the times are fulfilled his
work will come to an end.

Irenæus devotes his next three chapters (capp. xviii.-xx.) to what he
has heard of the <span class="margnote">From the Marcosian
Ritual.</span> Marcosian interpretation of scripture. This is of little
interest; but in chapter xxi. the Bishop of Lyons gives us some of the
formulæ used by the school, and these are of greater interest, although
the Marcosians denied their accuracy. Thus he says that the words of the
baptismal consecration are as follows:

"\[I baptise thee\] unto the Name of the unknown Father of the
universals, unto Truth, the Mother of all, unto Him who descended on
Jesus, unto the union, redemption, and communion of \[thy\] powers."

Next we have what purports to be the translation of a Hebrew invocation
to the Christ; Irenæus gives the original Hebrew, but in such a woefully
corrupt guise that it has baffled the ingenuity of the best of scholars.

"I invoke thee, O Light, who art above every power of the Father, Thou
who art called Light and Spirit and Life; for Thou hast reigned in the
body."

The formula of the rite of angelic redemption (the "angelic redemption"
was the means whereby the candidate became one with his "angel" above),
one of the higher degrees of Gnostic initiation, is then given:

"\[I invoke\] the Name hidden from every godhead and lordship, the Name
of Truth, in which Jesus, the Nazarene, clothed himself in the zones (or
girdles) of Light, \[the Name\] of the Christ, Christ the Living One,
through the Holy Spirit, for angelic redemption."

Next follows the formula of the restoration or

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

restitution, the final consecration. They who solemnize the rite declare
as follows:

"There is no separation between my spirit, my heart, and the
Super-celestial Power. May I enjoy thy Name, O Saviour of Truth!"

And then the candidate replies:

"I am confirmed and redeemed; I redeem my soul from this æon (world) and
all that cometh therefrom, in the name of IAŌ, who redeemed its soul,
unto redemption in Christ, the Living One."

Then the assistants rejoin:

"Peace unto all on whom this Name doth rest!" There were also prayers
for the dead, and also formulæ for the soul in passing through the seven
gates of the seven purgatorial spheres, of which the following are given
by Irenæus as specimens: "I am the son of the Father, of the Father who
is beyond all existence \[that is to say, generation, or *saṁsāra*, the
sphere of rebirth\] while I, His son, am in existence. I came \[into
existence\] to see mine own and things not mine, yet not wholly not
mine, for they are Wisdom's, who is \[my\] female \[counterpart\] and
made them for herself. But I derive my birth from Him who is beyond
existence, and I return again unto mine own whence I came forth."

And then they pass through the various planes of the purgatorial realms,
and the powers of the regions make way before them. The final "apology"
is made to the powers surrounding the world-fabricator, or demiurge, and
runs as follows:

"I am a vessel more precious than the female power \[lower Wisdom\] who
made you. Your mother

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

knoweth not the root from which she came; but I know myself and know
whence I am, and I invoke the incorruptible Wisdom \[above\], who is in
the Father. She it is who is the Mother of your mother, the Mother who
hath no mother, nor any male consort. But it was a female born from a
female who made you, one who knoweth not her Mother, but thinketh
herself to be alone \[self-generated\]. But I invoke her Mother to my
aid."

And so he passeth on to his own, casting off his chains, that is to say,
the soul, or lower nature.

It is evident that we have in the above an indication of the same range
of ideas which we find worked out with such elaboration in the *Pistis
Sophia* and Codex Brucianus treatises: the light-robe of the Master, the
Living One, the invocations, apologies, prayers for the dead, baptism
and chrism, all clearly distinguishable; all of which formed part of the
great cycle of Gnostic initiations in known Valentinian circles. The
degrees of this initiation were more and more secret as they became more
real. Irenæus may have heard of some of the formulæ of the lower grades,
but the higher grades could only be understood by the picked disciples
of these very intellectual and highly mystical schools. The documents
pertaining to the higher degrees seem never to have come into the hands
of the Church Fathers.
