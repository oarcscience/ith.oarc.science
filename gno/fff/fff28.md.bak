### THE PERATÆ.

<span class="margnote">The Source of their Tradition.</span>HIPPOLYTUS
says that the mysteries symbolized by the serpent are at the root of all
Gnosticism; and though the Church Father himself has not any idea what
these mysteries really are, as is amply proved by all his remarks, we
agree with him, as we have endeavoured to show above. He then proceeds
to treat of the system of the Peratæ, to whom we have already referred,
and whose Mysteries (Hippolytus calls them their "blasphemy against
Christ") had been kept secret "for many years." We know from other
sources that the school was prior to Clement of Alexandria. The system
of the Peratæ was based on an analogy with sidereal considerations, and
depended on the tradition of the ancient Chaldæan star-cult. In Book
iv., Hippolytus has already endeavoured to refute the Chaldæan system of
the star-spheres; but though he makes some good points against the
vulgar

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

astrology of the time, he does not affect the mysterious doctrine of the
septenary spheres, of which the empirical horoscopists had long lost the
secret, and for which they had substituted the physical planets.
Hippolytus had the Peratic school especially in mind in his attempted
refutation of the art of the astrologers and mathematicians, of which,
however, he admits he had no practical knowledge, but space compels us
simply to refer the student to the fourth book of his *Philosophumena*
for the outline of astrology which the Church Father presents.

According to the Peratic school, the universe was symbolized by a circle
enclosing a triangle. The <span class="margnote">The Three
Worlds.</span> triangle denoted the primal trichotomy into the three or
worlds, ingenerable, self-generable, and generable. Thus there were for
them three aspects of the Logos, or, from another point of view, three
Gods, or three Logoi, or three Minds, or three Men. When the
world-process had reached the completion of its devolution, the Saviour
descended from the ingenerable world or æon; the type of the Saviour is
that of a man perfected, "with a threefold nature, and threefold body,
and threefold power, having in himself all \[species of\] concretions
and potentialities from the three divisions of the universe." According
to the Pauline phrase; "It pleased Him that in him should dwell all
fulness (plērōma) bodily."

It is from the two higher worlds, the ingenerable and self-generable,
that the seeds of all kinds of potentialities are sent down into this
generable or formal world.

Hippolytus here breaks off, and, after informing

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

us that the founders of the school were a certain Euphrates (whom Origen
calls the founder of those Ophites to whom Celsus referred about 175
<span class="small">A.D.</span>) and Celbes, whom he elsewhere calls
Acembes and Ademes, proceeds to tell us something more of the Chaldæan
art. He then says that he will quote from a number of Peratic treatises
to show that their ideas were similar to those of the Chaldæans.

The Saviour has not only a human but a cosmic task to perform; the
cosmic task is to separate the good from the bad among the sidereal
powers and influences; the same peculiarity of soteriology is brought
into prominence in the *Pistis Sophia* treatise, to which we shall refer
later on. The "wars in heaven" precede the conflict of good and evil on
earth.

<span class="margnote">A Direct Quotation.</span>The treatise from which
Hippolytus proceeds to quote is evidently a Gnostic commentary on an old
Babylonian or Syrian cosmogonic scripture, which the commentator
endeavours to explain in Greek mythological terms. The beginning of this
mysterious treatise runs as follows:

"I am the voice of awakening from slumber in the peon (world) of night.
Henceforth I begin to strip naked the power that proceed eth from Chaos.
It is the power of the abysmal slime, which raiseth up the clay of the
imperishable vast moist \[principle\], the whole might of convulsion of
the colour of water, ever moving, supporting the steady, checking the
tottering, . . . the faithful steward of the track of the æthers,
rejoicing in that which streameth forth from the twelve founts of the
Law, the power which

<span id="page_209">p. 209</span>

taketh its type from the impress of the power of the invisible waters
above."

This power is called Thalassa, evidently the Thalatth (Tiāmat), or
World-Mother, of the Babylonians. The twelve sources are also called
twelve mouths, or pipes, through which the world-powers pour hissing. It
is the power which is surrounded by a dodecagonal pyramid or
dodecahedron--a hint which should persuade astrologers to reconsider
their "signs of the zodiac."

Hippolytus’ quotations and summary here become very obscure and require
a critical treatment which has not yet been accorded them; we are
finally told that the matter is taken from a treatise dealing with the
formal or generable world, for it is denominated *The Proasteioi up to
the Æther;* that is to say, the hierarchies of powers as far as the
æther, which were probably represented diagramatically by a series of
concentric circles, a "*proasteion*" being the space round a city's
walls.

Hippolytus here again points out the correspondence between astrological
symbolism and the teaching of this school of Gnosticism; it is, he says,
simply astrology allegorized, or rather we should say cosmogony
theologized. These Peratics, or Transcendentalists, derive their name
from the following considerations.

They believed that nothing which exists by generation can survive
destruction, and thus the <span class="margnote">The Meaning of the
Name.</span> sphere of generation is also the fate-sphere. He then who
knows nothing beyond this, is bound to the wheel of fate; but "he who is
conversant with the

<span id="page_210">p. 210</span>

compulsion of generation \[*saṁsāra*\], and the paths through which man
has entered into the \[generable\] world," can proceed through and pass
beyond (transcend) destruction. This destruction is the "Water" which is
the "generation of men," and which is the element in which the
hierarchies of generation hold their sway, and have their being. It is
called water because it is of that colour, namely, the lower ether.

The treatise from which Hippolytus quotes, again dives into the depths
of mythology, and among other things adduces the Myth of the
Going-forth, and its mystical interpretation; finally, the Gnostic
commentator explains the opening verses of the proem to the fourth
canonical Gospel. Hippolytus, however, is beginning to be baffled by the
amazing intricacy of the system, as he tells us, and thus breaks off,
and apparently takes up another treatise from which to quote. The new
treatise is of an exceedingly mystical character, and seemingly deals
with the psychological physiology of the school.

<span class="margnote">Psychological Physiology.</span>The universe is
figured forth as triple: Father, Son, and Matter (Hylē), each of endless
potentialities. The Son, the fashioning Logos, stands midway between the
immovable Father and moving Matter. At one time He is turned to the
Father and receives the powers in His disk (face, or "person"), and then
turning casts them into Matter, which is devoid of form; and thus the
Matter is moulded and the formal world is produced.

We here see an attempt to graft a higher teaching, of the same nature as
the Platonic doctrine of types

<span id="page_211">p. 211</span>

and ideas, on to the primitive symbolism of imperfectly observed natural
phenomena. The sun is the Father, the moon is the Son, and the earth is
Matter. The moon is figured as a serpent, owing to its serpentine path,
and its phases are imagined as the turning of its face towards the sun,
and again towards the earth. If this is correct, however, the immobility
of the sun and the motion of the earth give us reason to believe that
the Chaldæans were better acquainted with astronomy than the followers
of the far later Hipparcho-Ptolemæic geocentricism. The Gnostic writer
has also a correct theory of magnetic and other influences, which he
quaintly sets forth. We can, moreover, distinguish three strata of
interpretation: (i.) metaphysical and spiritual--the ideal world, the
intermediate, and the visible universe; (ii.) the world of
generation--with its sun, moon and earth-forces; and (iii.) the
analogical psycho-physiological process in man.

The last is thus explained. The brain is the Father, the cerebellum the
Son, and the medulla Matter or Hylē. "The cerebellum, by an ineffable
and inscrutable process, attracts through the pineal gland the spiritual
and life-giving essence from the vaulted chamber \[? third ventricle\].
And on receiving this, the cerebellum \[also\] in an ineffable manner
imparts the 'ideas,' just as the Son does, to Matter; or, in other
words, the seeds and the genera of things produced according to the
flesh flow along into the spinal marrow." And, adds Hippolytus, the main
secrets of the school depend on a knowledge of these correspondences,
but it would be impious for him

<span id="page_212">p. 212</span>

to say anything more on the matter--a scruple which is surprising to
find in a Church Father, and especially in Hippolytus, who devoted the
second and third books of his Refutation to an exposition of the
Mysteries.

<span class="margnote">The Lost Books of Hippolytus.</span>Now it is a
curious fact that these two books have been bodily removed from the MS.
Did Hippolytus, then, reveal too much of the "plagiarism by
anticipation" of the rites and doctrines of the Church, and did those
who came after him consider it unwise to keep such evidence on record?
For one would have thought that above all things the orthodox Fathers
would have delighted in parading the possession of such information
before the heathen and heretics, and would have specially preserved
these two books from destruction. But indeed it is altogether strange
that this, the most important Refutation of all the hæresiological
documents which we possess, was made no use of by the successors of
Hippolytus. The only MS. known to the western world was brought from
Mount Athos in 1842, and its contents (because of the number of direct
quotations) have revolutionized our ideas on Gnosticism on many points.
Had the two books on the Mysteries been preserved, we might perchance
have had our ideas even further revolutionized.
