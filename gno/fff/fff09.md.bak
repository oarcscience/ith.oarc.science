### PHILO ON THE CONTEMPLATIVE LIFE.

"As I have already treated of Essæans who the assiduously practise the
\[religious\] life of action, <span class="margnote">The Essæans.</span>
carrying it out in all, or, not to speak too presumptuously, in most of
its degrees, I will at once, following the sequence of my subject,
proceed to say as much as is proper concerning those who embrace \[the
life of\] contemplation; and that too without adding anything of my own
to better the matter--as all the poets and history-writers are
accustomed to do in the scarcity of good material--but artlessly holding
to the truth itself, for even the most skilful \[writer\], I know, will
fail to speak in accordance with her.

"Nevertheless the endeavour must be made and we must struggle through
with it; for the greatness of the virtue of these men ought not to be a
cause of silence for those who deem it right that no good thing should
be kept silent.

"Now the purpose of our wisdom-lovers is immediately apparent from their
name. They are <span class="margnote">The Name Therapeut.</span> called
Therapeutæ and Therapeutrides \[men and women\] in the original sense of
the word; either because they profess an art of healing superior to that
in use in cities (for that only heals (θεραπεύτει) bodies, whereas this
\[heals our\] souls as well when laid hold of by difficult and scarce
curable diseases, which pleasure and desire, and grief and fear,
selfishness and folly, and injustice, and

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

the endless multitude of passions and vices, inflict upon them), or else
because they have been schooled by nature and the sacred laws to serve
(θεραπεύτειν) That which is better than the Good and purer than the One
and more ancient than the Monad."

Philo here indulges in a digression., contrasting the unintelligent
worship of externals by the misinstructed in all religions with the
worship of true Deity by those who follow the contemplative life. Those
who are content to worship externals are blind; let them then remain
deprived of sight. And he adds significantly, that he is not speaking of
the sight of the body, but of that of the soul, by which alone truth and
falsehood are distinguished from each other.

"But as for the race of devotees \[the Therapeuts\], who are ever taught
more and more to see, let them strive for the intuition of That which
is; let them transcend the sun which men perceive \[and gaze upon the
Light beyond\], nor ever leave this rank \[order, space, or plane\],
which. leads to perfect blessedness. Now they who betake themselves to
\[the divine\] service \[do so\], not because of any custom, or on some
one's advice or appeal, but carried away with heavenly love, like those
initiated into the Bacchic and Corybantic Mysteries; they are afire with
God until they behold the object of their love.

"Then it is that, through their yearning for that deathless and blessed
Life, thinking that their <span class="margnote">Their Abandonment of
the World.</span> mortal life is already ended, they leave their
possessions to their sons and daughters, or, may

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

be, other relatives, with willing resolution making them their heirs
before the time; while those who have no relatives \[give their
property\] to their companions and friends."

In a digression Philo points out the difference between the sober
orderly abandonment of property to follow the philosophic life, which he
praises, and the wild exaggerations of the popular legends, which told
how Anaxagoras and Democritus, when seized with the love of wisdom,
allowed all their estates to be devoured by cattle.

"Whenever then \[our wisdom-lovers\] take the step of renouncing their
goods, they are no longer enticed away by any one, but hurry on without
once turning back, leaving behind them brethren, children, wives,
parents, the multitudinous ties of relationship, and bonds of
friendship, their native lands in which they have been born and reared;
for the habitual is a drag and most powerful allurement.

"Nor do they emigrate to some other city (like illused or worthless
slaves who, in claiming purchase <span class="margnote">Their
Retreats.</span> from their owners, only procure for themselves a change
of masters and not freedom), for every city, even the best governed one,
is full of innumerable tumults, forms of destruction, and disorders
which would be insupportable to a man who has once taken wisdom as a
guide.

"But they make their abode outside the walls in \[shut in\] woods or
enclosed lands in pursuit of solitude, \[and this\] not to indulge any
feeling of churlish dislike to their fellow-men, but from a knowledge
that continual contact with those of

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

dispositions dissimilar to their own is unprofitable and harmful.

"Now this natural class of men \[lit. race\] is to be found in many
parts of the inhabited world, both the Grecian and non-Grecian world
sharing in the perfect good.

"In Egypt there are crowds of them in every province, or nome as they
call it, and especially <span class="margnote">The Mareōtic
Colony.</span> round Alexandria. For they who are in every way \[or in
every nome\] the most highly advanced come as colonists, as it were, to
the Therapeutic fatherland, to a spot exceedingly well adapted for the
purpose, perched on a fairly high terrace \[small plateau or group of
small hills\] overlooking Lake Marea or Lake Mareōtis immediately south
of Alexandria, in a most favourable situation both for security and
mildness of temperature. Security \[*sci*. from robbers\] is ensured by
the belt of homesteads and villages \[which surrounds the terrace\], and
the mildness of temperature is due to the continual breezes sent up by
the lake, which opens into the sea, and from the proximity of the open
sea itself. The breezes from the sea are light, while those from the
lake are heavy, and their combination produces a most healthy condition
\[of the atmosphere\].

"The dwellings of the community are very simple, merely providing
shelter against the two <span class="margnote">Their Dwellings.</span>
greatest necessities, the extreme heat of the sun and the extreme cold
of the air. The dwellings are not close together as those in towns, for
neighbourhood is irksome and unpleasing to those

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

who are seeking for solitude; nor are they far apart, because of the
intercourse which is so dear to them, and also for mutual help in case
of attack by robbers.

"In each dwelling is a sacred place, called a shrine or monastery \[a
small chamber, closet, or <span class="margnote">The Original Meaning of
the Term Monastery.</span> cell\], in which in solitude they perform the
mysteries of the holy life, taking into it neither drink, nor food, nor
anything else requisite for the needs of the body, but only the laws and
inspired sayings of prophets, and hymns, and the rest, whereby knowledge
and devotion grow together and are perfected.

"Thus they preserve an unbroken memory of God, so that even in their
dream-consciousness nothing is presented to their minds but the glories
of the divine virtues and powers. Hence many of them give out the
rhythmic doctrines of the sacred wisdom, which they have obtained in the
visions of dream-life.

"Twice a day, at dawn and even, they are <span class="margnote">Their
Prayers and Exercises.</span> accustomed to offer up prayers; as the sun
rises s. praying for the sunshine, the real sunshine, that their minds
may be filled with heavenly Light, and as it sets praying that their
soul, completely lightened of the lust of senses and sensations, may
withdraw to its own congregation and council-chamber, there to track out
truth.

"The whole interval from dawn to sunset they devote to their exercises.
Taking the sacred writings they spend their time in study \[*lit*.
philosophise\], interpreting their ancestral code allegorically, for

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

they think that the words of the literal meaning are symbols of a hidden
nature which is made plain \[only\] by the under-meaning.

"They have also works of ancient authors who were once heads of their
school, and left behind <span class="margnote">The Nature of their
Books.</span> them many monuments of the method used in their
allegorical works; taking these as patterns, as it were, they imitate
the practice of their predecessors. They do not then spend their time in
contemplation and nothing else, but they compose songs and hymns to God
in all sorts of metres and melodies, outlined necessarily upon \[a
background of\] the more solemn numbers \[*lit*. rhythms\].

"For six days on end every one remains apart in solitude with himself in
his 'monastery,' as it <span class="margnote">Their Mode of
Meeting.</span> is called, engaged in study, never setting foot out of
door, or even looking out of window. But every seventh day they come
together as it were to a general assembly, and take their seats in order
according to their 'age' \[that is, the length of their membership in
the order\], in the prescribed attitude, with their hands palms
downwards, the right between the breast and chin, the left by the side.
Then he who is the senior most skilled in the doctrines comes
[forward](errata.htm#9.md) and discourses, with steadfast eyes and
steadfast voice, with reason and thoughtfulness, not making a display of
word-cleverness, as the rhetoricians and sophists of today, but
examining closely and explaining the precise meaning in the thoughts, a
meaning which does not merely light on the tips of the ears, but pierces
the ear and reaches the soul and steadfastly

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

abides there. The rest all listen in silence, signifying their approval
merely by a look in the eye or a nod of the head.

"Now this general sanctuary in which they assemble every seventh day
consists of two <span class="margnote">The Sanctuary.</span> enclosures:
one separated off for men, and the other for women. For women too
habitually form part of the audience, possessing the same eager desire
and having made the same deliberate choice \[as the men\].

"The division, however, between the two halls is only partly built up,
some three or four cubits from the floor, like a breast-work, the rest
of it, to the roof, being left open, and this for two reasons: in the
first place for the preservation of that modesty which so becomes
woman's nature, and in the second that sitting within earshot they may
hear easily, since there is nothing in the way of the speaker's voice.

"Now \[our Therapeuts\] first of all lay down continence as a
foundation, as it were for the soul, and then proceed to build up the
rest of the virtues upon it. Accordingly none of them would think of
taking food or drink before sundown, for they consider that the practice
of philosophy deserves the light, while the necessities of the body
\[may content themselves with\] darkness; hence they assign the day to
the former, and a brief portion of the night to the latter.

"A number of them, in whom the thirst for wisdom is implanted to a
greater degree, remind themselves of their food but once in three days,

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

while a few are so cheered and fare so sumptuously <span
class="margnote">Fasting.</span> at wisdom's banquet of teachings which
she so richly and unstintingly sets before them, that they can last for
twice the time, and even after six days barely take a mouthful of the
most necessary food, being trained to live on air, as they say the
grasshoppers do \[Plato, *Phaedr*.\], their needs made light by their
singing methinks.

"Since then they regard the seventh day as all-hallowed <span
class="margnote">The Seventh Day Common Meal.</span> and high festival,
they consider it worthy of special honour, and on it, after paying due
attention to the soul, they anoint the body, giving it, as also indeed
they do their cattle, respite from continual labour. Still they partake
of no dainty fare, but plain bread with salt for seasoning, which the
gourmands supplement with an extra relish of hyssop; while for drink
they have water from the spring. Thus in mollifying those tyrants which
nature has set over the mortal race--hunger and thirst, they offer them
nothing to tickle their vanity, but only such bare necessities as make
life possible. Accordingly they eat only to escape hunger, and drink
only to escape thirst, avoiding satiety as an enemy of and a plotter
against both soul and body.

"Now there are two kinds of covering--clothes and house. As to their
dwelling I have already <span class="margnote">Housing and
Clothing.</span> stated above that it is anything but beautiful to look
at, and put together anyhow, being made to answer only its most
absolutely necessary purpose; and as to their clothing, it is equally of
the plainest description, just to protect them from cold

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

and heat; in winter a thick mantle instead of a woolly hide, and in
summer a sleeveless robe of fine linen.

"For in everything they practise simplicity, knowing that vanity has
falsehood for its origin, but simplicity truth, each of them containing
the innate power of its source; for from falsehood stream forth the
manifold kinds of evils, while from truth come the abundant blessings of
good both human and divine.

"I would also touch upon the general meetings in which they pass the
time in greater festivity <span class="margnote">Their Sacred
Feasts.</span> than usual banqueting together, contrasting them with the
banquets of others."

Philo here indulges in a long digression in which he paints in the
strongest colours the debauchery and extravagance of the banquets of
voluptuaries, in order to contrast them as much as possible with the
sacred feasts of the Therapeuts.

"In the first place they all come together at the end of every seventh
week, for they reverence not only the simple period of seven days, but
also the period of the power \[or square\] of seven, since they know
that the 'seven' is pure and ever-virgin. Their seventh day festival
then is only a prelude to their greatest feast, which is assigned to the
fiftieth, the most holy and natural of numbers, \[the sum\] of the
powers of the \[perfect\] right-angled triangle, which has been
appointed as the origin of the generation of the cosmic elements.

"When then they have assembled together, clad in white robes, with
joyous looks and with the

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

greatest solemnity, at sign from one of the Ephemereuts for the day (for
this is the usual name <span class="margnote">The Banquet on the
Fiftieth Day.</span> for those who are engaged in such duties), and
before sitting down, standing one beside the other in rows in a certain
order, and raising their eyes and hands to heaven--their eyes, since
they are trained to gaze on things worthy of contemplation; and their
hands, since they are pure of gain, unstained by any pretence of
money-making affairs--they offer prayer unto God that their banquet may
be pleasing and acceptable.

"After prayers the seniors sit down to table, following the order of
their election. For they do <span class="margnote">Seniority.</span> not
regard as seniors merely those who are advanced in years and have
reached old age (nay, they regard such as quite young children if they
have only lately fallen in love with the higher life), but such as have
grown up and arrived at maturity in the contemplative part of
philosophy, which is [unquestionably](errata.htm#10.md) its fairest and
most divine portion.

"And women also share in the banquet, most of whom have grown old in
virginity, preserving their <span class="margnote">The Women
Disciples.</span> purity not from necessity (as some of the priestesses
among the Greeks), but rather of their own free-will, through their
zealous love of wisdom, with whom they are so keenly desirous of
spending their lives that they pay no attention to the pleasures of the
body. Their longing is not for mortal children, but for a deathless
progeny which the soul that is in love with God can alone bring forth,
when the Father has implanted in it those spiritual light-beams, with
which it shall

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

contemplate the laws of wisdom. There is, however, a division made
between them in their places at table, the men being apart on the right,
and the women apart on the left."

(It should be remembered that it was the custom in the Greco-Roman world
to recline at table, leaning on the left elbow with a cushion under the
arm. The person reclining to the right of another was said to lie on the
latter's breast (ἀυακεῖσθαι ἐυ τῷ κόλπῳ). *Cf*. the canonical phrase,
"the disciple who lay on His breast at meat.")

"Perhaps you suspect that cushions, if not luxurious at any rate of
tolerable softness, are provided <span class="margnote">The Plain
Couches.</span> for people well-born and well-bred and students of
philosophy, whereas they have nothing but mattresses of the more easily
procurable material (the papyrus of the country), over which \[they
throw\] the plainest possible rugs, slightly raised at the elbow for
them to lean upon. For on the one hand they somewhat relax their
\[usual\] Spartan rigour of life \[on such occasions\], while on the
other \[even at the banquets\] they always study the most liberal
frugality in everything, rejecting the allurements of pleasure with all
their might.

"Nor are they waited upon by slaves, since they consider the possession
of servants in general <span class="margnote">The Servers.</span> to be
contrary to nature. For nature has created all men free; but the
injustice and selfishness of those who strive after inequality (the root
of all evil), have set the yoke of power on the necks of the weaker and
harnessed them to \[the chariots of\] the stronger.

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

"So in this holy banquet there is no slave, as I have said, but it is
served by free men who perform the necessary service, not by compulsion,
or waiting for orders, but of their own free-will anticipating the
requests \[of the guests\] with promptitude and eagerness. For they are
not chance free men who are appointed for such service, but juniors of
the order who have been selected in. order of merit with every possible
care, who (as those noble and well-born and anxious to reach the summit
of virtue should) with affectionate rivalry, as though they were their
legitimate children, wait upon these fathers and mothers of theirs,
regarding them as their common parents, bound to them with closer ties
than their parents by blood: since, for those who think, there is no
closer tie than virtue and goodness. And they come in to serve
ungirdled, with their robes let down, so that no resemblance to a
slave's dress may be introduced.

"I know that some of my readers will laugh at such a banquet as this;
but such laughter will bring them weeping and sorrow.

"Nor is wine brought in on these occasions, but the clearest water, cold
for the majority, and <span class="margnote">The Frugal Fare.</span>
warmed for those of the older men whose tastes are delicate. The table
moreover contains nothing that has blood in it, for the food is bread
with salt for seasoning, to which hyssop is added as an extra relish for
the gourmands. For just as right reason bids priests make offerings free
from wine and blood, so does it bid these sages live. For wine is a drug
that brings on madness, and costly

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

seasonings rouse up desire, the most insatiable of beasts. So much,
then, for the preliminaries of the banquet.

"Now, after the guests have taken their places <span
class="margnote">The President.</span> in the ranks I have described,
and the waiters have taken their stand in order, ready to serve, when
complete silence is gained--(and when is there not? you may say; but
then there is deeper silence than before, so that no one ventures to
make a sound or even breathe at all hard)--the president searches out
some passage in the sacred scriptures or solves some difficulty
propounded by one of the members, without any thought of display, for he
does not aim at a reputation for cleverness in words, but is simply
desirous of getting a clearer view of some points \[of doctrine\]; and
when he has done so, he unselfishly shares it with those who, though
they have not such keen vision as himself, nevertheless have as great a
longing to learn.

"The president for his part employs a somewhat The leisurely method of
imparting instruction, pausing at <span class="margnote">The
Instruction.</span> intervals and stopping for frequent recapitulations,
impressing the ideas on their souls. (For when, in giving an
interpretation, one continues to speak rapidly without pausing for
breath, the mind of the hearers is left behind unable to keep up the
pace, and fails to comprehend what is said.) While they, on their side,
fixing all their attention upon him, remain in one and the same attitude
listing attentively, showing their understanding and comprehension \[ of
his words \] by nod and look; praise of the speaker by a pleased
expression and

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

the thoughtful turning to him of their faces, and hesitation by a mild
shake of the head and a motion of the forefinger of the right hand. And
the juniors who stand at service are,just as attentive as the seniors at
table.

"Now the interpretation of the sacred scriptures is based upon the
under-meanings in the allegorical <span class="margnote">The
Interpretation of Scripture.</span> narratives; for these men look upon
the whole of their law-code as being like to a living thing, having for
body the spoken commands, and for soul the unseen thought stored up in
the words (in which thought the rational soul \[of the student\] begins
to contemplate things native to its own nature more than in anything
else)--the interpretation, as it were, in the mirror of the names,
catching sight of the extraordinary beauties of the ideas contained in
them, unwrapping and unrobing the symbols from them, and bringing to
light the naked inner meanings, for those who are able with a little
suggestion to arrive at the intuition of the hidden sense from the
apparent meaning.

"When then the president seems to have discoursed long enough, and the
discourse, according to its range, to have in his case made good
practice at the points aimed at, and in theirs \[to have met with due\]
attention, there is a burst of applause from the company, as though they
would offer their congratulations, but this is restricted to three claps
of the hands.

"Then the president, rising, chants a hymn which has been made in God's
honour, either a new one <span class="margnote">The Singing
Hymns.</span> which he has himself composed, or an old one of

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

the ancient poets. For they have left behind them many metres and tunes
in trimetric epics, processional hymns, libation odes, altar-chants,
stationary choruses, and dance-songs, \[all\] admirably measured off in
diversified strains.

"And after him the others also in bands, in proper order, \[take up the
chanting\], while the rest listen in deep silence, except when they have
to join in the burden and refrains; for they all, both men and women,
join in.

Then when hymns are over, the juniors bring <span class="margnote">Bread
and Salt.</span> in the table, which was mentioned shortly before, with
the all-pure food upon it, leavened bread, with flavouring of salt
mingled with hyssop, out of respect to the holy table set up in the holy
place of the temple. For on this table are loaves and salt without
seasoning; the loaves are unleavened and the salt unmixed with anything
else; for it was fitting that the simplest and purest things should be
allotted to the most excellent division of the priests, the reward of
their ministry, while the rest should strive after things of similar
purity, but abstain from the same food \[as the priests\], in order that
the more excellent should have this privilege.

"After the banquet they keep the holy all-night <span
class="margnote">The Sacred Dancing.</span> festival. And this is how it
is kept. They all stand up in a body, and about the middle of the
entertainment they first of all separate into two bands, men in one and
women in the other, And a leader is chosen for each, the conductor whose
reputation is greatest and the one most suitable for the post,

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They then chant
hymns made in God's honour in many metres and melodies, sometimes
singing in chorus, sometimes one band beating time to the answering
chant of the other, \[now\] dancing to its music, \[now\] inspiring it,
at one time in processional hymns, at another in standing songs, turning
and returning in the dance.

"Then when each band has feasted \[that is, has sung and danced\] apart
by itself, drinking of God-pleasing \[nectar\], just as in the Bacchic
rites men drink the wine unmixed, then they join together, and one
chorus is formed of the two bands, in imitation of the joined chorus on
the banks of the Red Sea because of the wonderful works that had been
there wrought. For the sea at God's command became for one party a cause
of safety and for the other a cause of ruin."

(Philo here refers to the fabled dance of triumph of the Israelites at
the destruction of Pharaoh and his host, when Moses led the men and
Miriam the women in a common dance; but the Therapeuts all over the
world could not have traced the custom to this myth.)

"So the chorus of men and women Therapeuts, being formed as closely as
possible on this model, by means of melodies in parts and harmony--the
high notes of the women answering to the deep tones of the men--produces
a harmonious and most musical symphony. The ideas are of the most
beautiful, the expressions of the most beautiful, and the dancers
reverent; while the goal. of the ideas, expressions, and dancers is
piety.

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

"Thus drunken unto morning's light with this <span class="margnote">The
Morning Prayer.</span> fair drunkenness, with no head-heaviness or
drowsiness, but with eyes and body fresher even than when they came to
the banquet, they take their stand at dawn, when, catching sight of the
rising sun, they raise their hands to heaven, praying for sunlight and
truth and keenness of spiritual vision. After this prayer each returns
to his own sanctuary, to his accustomed traffic in philosophy and labour
in its fields.

"So far then about the Therapeuts, who are devoted to the contemplation
of nature and live in it and in the soul alone, citizens of heaven and
the world, legitimately recommended to the Father and Creator of the
Universe by their virtue, which procures them His love, virtue that sets
before it for its prize the most suitable reward of nobility and
goodness, outstripping every gift of fortune, and the first coiner in
the race to the very goal of blessedness."

 

With regard to the mystic numbers 7 and 50 mentioned in the text above,
it may be of interest to <span class="margnote">Note on the Sacred
Numbers.</span> remark that Philo elsewhere (*Leg. Alleg.*, i. 46) tells
us that the Pythagoreans called the number 7 the ever-virgin, because
"it neither produces any of the numbers within the decad \[*i.e.*, from
1 to 10\] nor is produced by any of them." The power or square of 7 is
49, and the great feast therefore took place every fiftieth day. The
number 50 is based on the proportioned of the sides of the "perfect"
right-angled triangle, the famous Pythagorean triangle,

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

so often referred to by Plato. (*Cf*. *The Nuptial Number of Plato*, by
James Adam, M.A., Cambridge, 1891; the best work on the subject.) The
sides of this triangle bear the proportions of 3, 4, and 5, and 32 +
42=52, or 9 + 16=25; and 9 + 16 + 25 = 50.

In another treatise (*Qu. in Gen.*, iii. 39) we get some further
interesting information concerning the 50. Philo speaks of two series,
which he calls triangles and squares, namely 1, 3, 6, 10, and 1, 4, 9,
16. At first sight it is difficult to discover why Philo should call the
first series of numbers triangles, but it has occurred to me that he had
in mind some such arrangement as the following.

<span id="img_08300"></span> ![](img/08300.jpg)

Many interesting correspondences may be made out from the study of the
apparently simple ordering of these points, monads, or atoms, but we are
at present only engaged on the consideration of the number 50.

With regard to the triangular series, 1, 3, 6, 10, it is to be noticed
that 1 = 1; 3 = 1 + 2; 6 = 1 + 2 + 3; and 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.

With regard to the square series, 1, 4, 9, 16, we see at once that 1 =
1<sup>2</sup>; 4 = 2<sup>2</sup>; 9 = 3<sup>2</sup>; and 16 =
4<sup>2</sup>. Moreover 1 + 3 + 6 + 10 = 20; and 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30;
and finally 20 + 30 = 50.

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

Much more could be said; but our space is limited, and those who are
interested in the matter can easily work out details for themselves.

In reading this treatise and the rest of the <span
class="margnote">Philo's Connection with the Therapeuts.</span>
references to the Therapeuts scattered through Philo's writings, the
chief questions that naturally arise are: What was Philo's connection
with them; and how far can we rely on his account? There is an important
passage in his writings which gives us the critical point of departure
in seeking an answer. Philo (*Leg. Alleg.*, i. 81) writes:

"I too have ofttimes left my kindred and my friends and country, and
have gone into the wilderness \[or into solitude\] in order to
comprehend the things worthy to be seen, yet have profited nothing; but
my soul was scattered or stung with passion, and lapsed into the very
opposite current."

We learn from this interesting item of autobiography that Philo had
himself enjoyed no success in the contemplative life. This accounts for
his great reverence and high respect for those who had succeeded in
comprehending the things "worthy to be seen." Now as Philo never
abandoned his property, he could therefore not have been a full accepted
member of one of these brotherhoods. In all probability he belonged to
one of their outer circles. As was the case with the Pythagoreans and
Essenes, the Therapeuts had lay-pupils who lived in the world and who
perhaps resorted to the community now and again for a period of
"retreat," and then returned again to the world.

That these lay-disciples were men of great ability

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

and insight is amply shown by the works of Philo <span
class="margnote">The Lay Disciples.</span> himself, but that there was a
large literature of a still loftier and more inspired character is also
evident from what Philo has to say of his teachers. What has become of
all these works, commentaries, interpretations, hymns, sermons,
expositions, apocalypses--works which aroused the admiration of so
distinguished a writer as Philo? It seems to me that though we may have
some scraps of them embedded in the Jewish Pseudepigrapha which have
come down to us, many of them belonged to the now lost precursors of the
fragments of the Gnostic literature which have survived.

But were the Therapeuts Jews, as Philo would lead us to believe in his
apology for that nation? It is evident from his own statements that the
community which he describes, and with which he was probably connected
as lay-pupil, was but one of a vast number scattered all over the world.
Philo would have us believe that his particular community was the chief
of all, doubtless because it was mainly Jewish, though not orthodoxly
so, for they were "sun-worshippers."

It is therefore reasonable to conclude that there were at this time
numerous communities of mystics <span class="margnote">The Variety of
Communities.</span> and ascetics devoted to the holy life and sacred
science scattered throughout the world, and that Philo's Mareotic
community was *one* of these. Others may have been tinged as strongly
with [Egyptian](errata.htm#11.md), or Chaldæan, or Zoroastrian, or Orphic
elements, as the one south of Alexandria was tinged with Judaism. It is
further not incredible

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

that there were also truly eclectic communities among them who combined
and synthesized the various traditions and initiations handed down by
the doctrinally more exclusive communities, and it is in this direction
therefore that we must look for light on the origins of Gnosticism and
for the occult background of Christianity. These communities did not at
this time propagandize, though they may have indirectly been at the back
of some of the greatest propagandist efforts, as in the case of Philo. I
also think that the later. Gnostic communities did not propagandize
directly, and that whatever works they may have put
[forward](errata.htm#12.md) for lay-pupils or by lay-pupils were only a
small part of their literature. For the people there were the Law and
the Prophets and the Gospel; for the lay-pupils, the intermediate
literature; and for those within, those most highly mystical and
abstruse treatises that none but the trained mystics could possibly
understand or were expected to understand.
