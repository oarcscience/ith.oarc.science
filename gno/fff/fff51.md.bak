#### ix. From a Psalm.

Finally from the same source, *The Philosophumena*, we recover the
following lines; it is <span class="margnote">The Chain of Being.</span>
probable that Hippolytus took them from the same treatise from which he
derived the above information, and that the Psalm endeavoured to explain
why the new-born babe was the Logos, why "this" is "That," as the
Upanishads have it, and all is one.

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"All things depending in spirit I see;  
All things supported in spirit I view;  
    Flesh from soul depending;  
    Soul by air supported;  
    Air from æther hanging--  
    Fruits borne of the deep--  
    Babe borne of the womb."

</div>

Whether or not this exceedingly mystical Psalm was taken in the sense we
have suggested above is merely problematical. Such mystic utterances
could of course be interpreted from both the microcosmic and macrocosmic
standpoints; and Hippolytus gives us what he asserts to be a Valentinian
interpretation from the latter point of view.

The "flesh" is the Hylē (the Hebdomad of Basilides); the "soul" is that
of the Demiurge (the "material" force of the ætheric spaces, the Ogdoad
of Basilides); the Demiurge hangs from the Spirit, which from one point
of view is the Great Limit or Boundary, separating the Plērōma, or world
of reality, from the Kenōma or phenomenal universe,

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

and from another is Sophia or Wisdom, in the Kingdom of the Midst. Thus
the Demiurge hangs from Sophia; Sophia from the Great Boundary or Horos
(a further differentiation of the Basilidian simple idea of the Great
Firmament); Horos from the Plērōma, the Blessed Treasure of the æons;
and this world of ideas, or Living Æon, from the Abyss or Great Depth,
the Father, the God beyond being.

This is the Valentinian chain of being, the subordinate details of which
are so abstruse and so complicated, that no one has hitherto been able
to make any consistent scheme out of their chaotic and contradictory
representations in the writings of the Fathers.

In the MS. of *The Philosophumena* the above fragment is prefixed by the
disconnected word "Harvest." Hilgenfeld accordingly speaks of Valentinus
"hymning the Great Harvest," which is a very grandiose conception, but
an idea difficult to connect with the lines quoted.

Such is the poor sum total of our information as to what Valentinus
actually taught himself--nine, or rather eight, shreds of fragments in
all. Yet what strong, joyous words, bursting with life, in the midst of
the dullness of the refutators' rhetoric.

To these fragments it might seem proper to append the account which
Irenæus (cap. 11) copied from a former hæresiological writer. It is
generally assumed that this more ancient authority was Justin Martyr;
but whoever he may have been, he was a mere summarizer, and even at that
early date in hæresiology (*cir*. 150), was struggling with the
contradictory

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

accounts he had heard of the "Valentinian" Gnosis. I, therefore,
consider this source as no more worthy of special notice than the other
summaries of general so-called Valentinian doctrine found in the
writings of the Fathers. We have nothing certain to learn in it of the
teaching of Valentinus himself, and that is the only search on which we
are at present engaged.

Thus we take our farewell of the "great unknown" of Gnosticism, whose
name was nevertheless <span class="margnote">The Ariadne's Thread out of
the Maze.</span> the best known of all, whose influence was the most
far-reaching, and whose doctrines, instead of being a cut-and-dried
system of dead vocables, were so animate with life that the
kaleidoscopic representations of them by his followers in the first
place, and the puzzled and puzzling summaries by the Fathers of these
protean representations in the second, have proved the despair of
scholarship. The reason of this for the most part is that, in
endeavoring to bring order into this chaos, words and terms have been
followed as clues instead of ideas. Not only in the case of the
Valentinian cycle of ideas, but also in every other phase of the Gnosis,
these delusive guides have been generally followed as leaders out of the
labyrinth. But the Adriadne's thread which takes us out of the maze is
spun out of ideas, not of names. The Gnostics were ever changing their
nomenclature; the god of one system might even be the devil of another!
He who makes a concordance of names merely, in Gnosticism, may think
himself lucky to escape a lunatic asylum; he, on the contrary, who seeks
the idea behind the

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

name, will often find himself in a realm of great beauty and harmony of
thought. Men like the Gnostics have ever had intuitions of a real state
of being, of definite and precise realms of consciousness; yet each has
caught but a glimpse of the reality, as all men must so long as they are
imprisoned in a body. If the Gnostics exhausted the philosophy and
religion of their time in striving to find a decent vestment for the
naked truth, as they thought they saw it, who shall blame them? Though
they contradict one another, in the view of the word-hunter, they do not
contradict themselves for the follower of ideas. The idea is the key
which opens the mysteries of the Gnosis, and those who refuse to use
this living key must be content to have the treasury closed against
them.

We shall now, before dealing with the followers of Valentinus, attempt,
from the chaos of summaries, to sift out some of the leading ideas of
the Valentinian cycle of the Gnosis. If we were to bring all these
contradictory accounts together and treat them to a critical analysis,
it is to be feared that the general reader, for whom these sketches are
written, would either close our pages in despair; or, if he attempted to
follow the details and the weighing of probabilities, be reduced to such
a state of mental perturbation that he would forget all that has gone
before, and be rendered totally unfit to comprehend what is to follow.
Such technical work must be reserved for treatment elsewhere, meantime
we will attempt, not to give an exposition of the system of "them of

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Valentinus"--if
indeed they ever had a single definite system--but merely to sketch some
outlines of their ideas on æonology.
