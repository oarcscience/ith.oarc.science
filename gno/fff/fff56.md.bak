### HERACLEŌN.

OF the life of Heracleon, whom Clement of Alexandria (*Strom*., iv. 9)
calls the "most esteemed of the <span class="margnote">His Commentary on
the Fourth Gospel.</span> school of Valentinus," we again know nothing
except that he wrote certain Memoirs (ὑπομνήματα), containing a
commentary on the fourth Gospel. The date of this commentary, the first
on any book of the New Testament collection, is generally ascribed to
the decade 170-180 <span class="small">A.D.</span> The Gnostic Heracleon
is thus the first commentator of canonical Christianity, and
considerable fragments of his work have been preserved by Origen in his
own Commentary on the so-called Johannine Gospel. These fragments were
first collected by Grabe in his *Spicilegium*, reprinted by Massuet and
Stieren in their editions of Irenæus, and by Hilgenfeld in his
*Ketzergeschichte* (1884), and finally in 1891 re-edited from a new
collation of all the eight known (only three having previously been
collated) MSS. by Brooke in *Texts and Studies*, i. 4.

In these fragments Heracleon assumes the "Valentinian" system as a
basis; but it is kept in the background, and his exegesis is often
endorsed by Origen.

The Gnostics were still in the Christian ranks, they were still members
of the General Christian body, and desired to remain members; but
bigotry finally drove them out because they dared to say that the
teaching of the Christ contained a wisdom

<span id="page_392">p. 392</span>

which transcended the comprehension of the majority.

The commentary of Heracleon, however, need not detain us, for it is, so
to say, outside the circle of distinct Gnostic exegesis; it stands
midway between it and General Christianity, and in almost the same
position as the views of Clement and Origen.
