#### viii. The Myth which Valentinus made.

Hippolytus (II.) inserts the following scrap of information in the midst
of the lengthy description of the system of Marcus, which he copied from
Irenæus:

<span class="margnote">The Wisdom of the "Little One."</span>"Valentinus
says that he once saw a child that had only just been born, and that he
proceeded to question it to find out who it was. And the babe replied
and said it was the Logos." To this, says Hippolytus, Valentinus
subjoined a "tragic myth," which formed the basis of his teaching. Have
we here an incident from the prologue to one of Valentinus’ treatises;
and is the "tragic myth" Valentinus’ modification of the great
Sophia-mythus which was the *deus ex machinâ* of part of his cosmogony?
