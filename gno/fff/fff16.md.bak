### THE LITERATURE AND SOURCES OF GNOSTICISM.

THE study of Gnosticism has so far been almost entirely confined to
specialists, whose works cannot be understanded of the people; the
ordinary reader is deterred by the wealth of detail, by the difficulty
of the technical terms, by the obscurity of theological phraseology, and
by the feeling that he is expected to know many things of which he has
never even heard. It is to be hoped that ere long some competent English
scholar, endowed with the genius of lucid generalization, may be induced
to write a popular sketch of the subject, in order that thinking men and
women who have not enjoyed the advantages of a technical training in
Church history and dogmatics, may understand its importance and
absorbing interest.

Meantime our present essay may, perhaps, to some extent serve as a
"guide to the perplexed," yet not conceived on the plan or carried out
with the ability of a Maimonides, but rather the mere jotting down of a
few notes and indications which may spare the general reader the years
of labour the writer has spent in searching through many books.

First, then, as to books; what are the best works on Gnosticism? The
best books without exception <span class="margnote">Literature.</span>
are by German scholars. Here, then, we are confronted with our first
difficulty, for the general reader as a rule is a man of one language
only. For the ordinary English reader, therefore, such works are closed
books, and he must have recourse to

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

translations, if such exist. Unfortunately only two of such works are
procurable in English dress.

The second volume of the translation (Bohn, new ed., 1890) of Neander's
*Church History* (1825, etc.), deals with the Gnostics, but the great
German theologian's work is now out of date.

The best general review of Gnosticism by the light of the most recent
researches, is to be found in Harnack's admirable *History of Dogma*, in
the first volume, translated in 1894.

For a more detailed account, Smith and Wace's *Dictionary of Christian
Biography* (1877-1887) is absolutely indispensable. The scheme of this
useful work contains a general article, with lengthy articles on every
Gnostic teacher, and shorter articles on a number of the technical terms
of the Gnosis. Lipsius, Salmon, and Hort are responsible for the work,
and their names are a sufficient guarantee of thoroughness.

The last two works are all that are necessary for a preliminary grasp of
the subject, and are the outcome of profound scholarship and admirable
critical acumen. It is a pleasure to subscribe one's tribute of praise
to such work, although the point of view assumed by these distinguished
scholars is not sufficiently liberal for one who is deeply convinced
that the inspiration of every honest effort to formulate the inner truth
of things is *really* from above.

Of other English works we may mention King's *Gnostics and their
Remains* (2nd ed., 1887), a work intended for the general reader. King
strongly

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

insists on a distinct Indian influence in Gnosticism, and deals with a
number of interesting points; but his work lacks the thoroughness of the
specialist. He is, however, far removed from "orthodoxy," and has an
exceeding great sympathy for the Gnostics. The weakest point of King's
work is the side he has brought into chief prominence; the so-called
"remains" of the Gnostics, amulets, talismans, etc., in which King as a
numismatologist took special interest, are now stated by the best
authorities to have had most probably no connection with our
philosophers. Nevertheless King's book is well worth reading.

Mansel's posthumous work, *The Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second
Centuries* (1875), is not only unsympathetic, but for the most part does
grave injustice to the Gnostics, by insisting on treating their leading
ideas as a metaphysic to be judged by the standard of modern German
philosophical methods, the Dean having himself once held a chair of
philosophy.

Norton, in his *Evidences of the Genuineness of the Gospels* (1847),
devotes his second volume to the Gnostics, but the value of his work is
small.

Burton's *Inquiry into the Heresies of the Apostolic Age* (1829) might
have been written by an early Church Father. The Bampton lecturer's
effort and Norton's are now both out of date; moreover their books and
that of Mansel are only procurable in the second-hand market.

So much for works in English dealing directly with Gnosticism.

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

The student will find in Harnack brief but discriminating bibliographies
after each chapter, in which all the best works are given, especially
those of German scholars; in Smith and Wace's Dictionary each article is
also followed by a fair bibliography. A short general bibliography, and
also a list of nearly all the latest work done on the only direct
documents of Gnosticism which we possess, is to be found in the
Introduction to my translation of the Gnostic treatise *Pistis Sophia*
(1896); and a classified bibliography of all the most important works is
appended to this essay. The student will be surprised to see how
unfavourably the paucity of information in English compares with the
mass of encyclopædic work in German, and how France also in this
department of Church history and theological research runs England very
close. But the consideration of these works does not fall into the plan
of this short essay.

<span class="margnote">Indirect Sources.</span>So much, then, for the
general literature of the subject in English; we have now to consider
briefly the indirect and direct documents of Gnosticism. By "indirect"
documents I mean the polemical writings of the Fathers of what
subsequently established itself as the orthodox Catholic Church. These
indirect documents were practically the only sources of information
until 1853, when Schwartze's translation of the *Pistis Sophia* was
published. By "direct" documents I mean the few Gnostic treatises which
have reached our hands through the medium of Coptic translation.

Our indirect sources of information, therefore,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

come through the hands of the most violent opponents of the Gnosis; and
we have only to remember the intense bitterness of religious controversy
at all times, and especially in the early centuries of the Church, to
make us profoundly sceptical of the reliability of such sources of
information. Moreover, the earlier and more contemporaneous, and
therefore comparatively more reliable, sources are to be found mostly in
the writings of the Fathers of the Western Church, who were less capable
of understanding the philosophical and mystical problems which agitated
the Eastern communities. The Roman and occidental mind could never
really grasp Greek and oriental thought, and the Western Fathers were
always the main champions of "orthodoxy."

We should further remember that we have extant no contemporary
"refutation" of the first century (if any ever existed), or of the first
three quarters of the second. The great "store-house of Gnosticism" is
the Refutation of Irenæus, who wrote at Lyons in Gaul, far away from the
real scene of action, in about the penultimate decade of the second
century. All subsequent refutators base themselves more or less on the
treatise of Irenæus, and frequently copy [the](errata.htm#22.md) work of
the Gallic bishop. If, then, Irenæus can be shown to be unreliable, the
whole edifice of refutation is endangered by the insecurity of its
foundation. This important point will be considered later on.

Prior to Irenæus a certain Agrippa Castor, who flourished late in the
reign of Hadrian, about 135 <span class="small">A.D.</span>,

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

is said by Eusebius to have been the first to write against heresies.
His work is unfortunately lost.

Justin Martyr, the apologist, also composed a work against heresies;
this Syntagma or Compendium is also unfortunately lost. Judging from
Justin's account of the Gospel-story in his extant works, it would
appear that the "Memoirs of the Apostles" to which he repeatedly refers,
were not identical with our four canonical Gospels, though it may well
be that these Gospels were assuming their present shape at this period.
It may therefore be supposed that his work upon heresies threw too
strong a light on pre-canonical controversy to make its continued use
desirable. This may also be the reason of the disappearance of the work
of Agrippa Castor. Justin flourished about 140-160 <span
class="small">A.D.</span>

Clement of Alexandria, whose greatest literary activity was from about
190-203 <span class="small">A.D.</span>, lived in the greatest centre of
Gnostic activity, and was personally acquainted with some of the great
doctors of the Gnosis. His works are for the most part free from those
wholesale accusations of immorality with which the general run of Church
Fathers in after years loved to bespatter the character of the Gnostics
of the first two centuries. All the critics are now agreed that these
accusations were unfounded calumnies as far as the great schools and
their teachers were concerned, seeing that the majority were rigid
ascetics. But this point will come out more clearly later on.

Clement is supposed to have dealt with the higher problems of Gnosticism
in his lost work, *The Outlines*,

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

in which he endeavoured to construct a complete system of Christian
teaching, the first three books of which bore a strong resemblance to
the three stages of the Platonists: (i.) Purification, (ii.) Initiation,
(iii.) Direct Vision. This work is also unfortunately lost. It was the
continuation of his famous *Miscellanies*, in which the Christian
philosopher laboured to show that he was a true Gnostic himself.

Tertullian of Carthage (fl. 200-220 <span class="small">A.D.</span>),
whose intolerance, "fiery zeal," and violently abusive language are
notorious, wrote against heresies, mostly copying Irenæus. For the
Marcionites, however, he is an independent authority. Part of the
treatise against heresies ascribed to Tertullian is written by some
unknown refutator, and so we have a Pseudo-Tertullian to take into
consideration.

Hippolytus, Bishop of Portus at the mouth of the Tiber, was the disciple
of Irenæus. He wrote a Compendium against all heresies, based almost
entirely on Irenæus, which is lost; but a much larger work of the same
Father was in 1842 discovered at Mount Athos. This purported to be a
*Refutation of All Heresies*, and adds considerably to our information
from indirect sources; for the work is not a mere copy of Irenæus, but
adds a large mass of new matter, with quotations from some Gnostic MSS.
which had fallen into Hippolytus' hands. The composition of this work
may be dated somewhere about 222 <span class="small">A.D.</span>

About this time also (225-250) Origen, the great Alexandrian Father,
wrote a refutation against a

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

certain Celsus, who is supposed to have been the first opponent of
Christianity among the philosophers, and who lived some seventy-five
years before Origen's time. In this there are passages referring to some
of the Gnostics. If then we include Origen's work against *The True
Word* of Celsus, we have mentioned all the Fathers who are of any real
value for the indirect sources of Gnosticism in the first two centuries

Philaster, bishop of Brescia in Italy, Epiphanius, bishop of Salamis in
Cyprus, and Jerome, fall about the last quarter of the fourth century,
and are therefore (unless, of course, they quote from earlier writers)
too late for accuracy with regard to the things of the first two
centuries. Philaster, moreover, is generally put out of court owing to
his overweening credulity; and the reliability of Epiphanius is often
open to grave suspicion, owing to his great faculty of inventing or
retailing scandals and all kinds of foulness.

Eusebius is fifty years earlier, but there is little to be gleaned from
him on the subject, and his reputation for accuracy has been called into
question by many independent historical critics.

Theodoret's Compendium, based on his predecessors and dating about the
middle of the fifth century, is far too late to add to our knowledge of
the first two centuries.

The study of these indirect documents has exercised the ingenuity of the
critics and resulted in a marvellously clever feat of scholarship.
Lipsius has demonstrated that Epiphanius, Philaster, and

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pseudo-Tertullian
all draw from a common source, which was the lost Syntagma or Compendium
of Hippolytus, consisting mainly of notes of the lectures of Irenæus;
that is to say, in all probability, of the polemical tractates which the
bishop read to his community, and on which he based his larger work.
Thus reconstructing the lost document, he compares it with Irenæus, and
infers for both a common authority, probably the lost Syntagma of
Justin.

We thus see that our main source is Irenæus. The *Refutation* of Irenæus
is the "store-house of Gnosticism"--according to the Fathers--for the
first two centuries. Irenæus lived far away in the wilds of Gaul; is his
evidence reliable? Setting aside the general presumption that no
ecclesiastical writer at such a time could, in the nature of things,
have been fair to the views of his opponents, which he perforce regarded
as the direct product of the prince of all iniquity, we shall shortly
see that fate has at length--only a few years ago--placed the final
proof of this presumption in our hands.

But meantime let us turn our attention to our <span
class="margnote">Direct Sources.</span> direct sources of
[information](errata.htm#23.md). We have now no less than three Codices
containing Coptic translations of original Greek Gnostic works.

(i.) The Askew Codex, vellum, British Museum, London: containing the
*Pistis Sophia* treatise and extracts from *The Books of the Saviour*.

(ii.) The Bruce Codex (consisting of two distinct MSS.), papyrus,
Bodleian Library, Oxford: containing a series of lengthy fragments under
the general

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

title *The Book of the Great Logos according to the Mystery;* another
treatise of great sublimity but without a title; and a fragment or
fragments of yet another treatise.

(iii.) The Akhmīm Codex, papyrus, Egyptian Museum, Berlin: containing
*The Gospel of Mary* (or *Apocryphon of John*), *The Wisdom of Jesus
Christ*, and *The Acts of Peter*.

The Akhmīm Codex was only discovered in 1896. Prior to 1853, when the
Askew Codex was translated into Latin, nothing of a practical nature was
known of its contents, while the contents of the Bruce Codex were not
known till 1891-1892, when translations appeared in French and German.
We have to reflect on the indifference which allowed these important
documents to remain, in the one case (Cod. Ask.) for eighty years
without translation, and in the other (Cod. Bruc.) one hundred and
twenty years! The first attempt at translation in English appeared only
in 1896 in my version of *Pistis Sophia*.

It will thus be seen that the study of Gnosticism from direct sources is
quite recent, and that all but the most recent research is out of date.
This new view is all the more forced upon us by the latest discovery
which in the Akhmīm MS. places in our hands the means of testing the
accuracy of Irenæus, the sheet-anchor of hæresiologists. *The Gospel of
Mary* is one of the original sources that Irenæus used. We are now
enabled in one case to control the Church Father point by point--and
find that he has so condensed and paraphrased his original that the
consistent system of the school of Gnosticism which

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

he is endeavouring to refute, appears as an incomprehensible jumble.

This recent activity among specialists in Gnostic research, at a time
when a widespread interest in a revival of theosophic studies has
prepared the way for a reconsideration of Gnosticism from, a totally
different standpoint to that of pure criticism or refutation, is a
curious coincidence.

From the above considerations it is evident that so far are the Gnostics
and their ideas from being buried in that oblivion which their opponents
have so fervently desired and so busily striven to ensure, that now at
the opening of the twentieth century, at a time when Biblical criticism
is working with the reincarnated energy and independence of a Marcion,
the memory of these universalizers of Christianity is coming once more
to the front and occupying the attention of earnest students of
religion.

In addition to these indirect and direct sources there is also another
source that may yield us some valuable information, when submitted to
the searching of an enlightened criticism. The legends and traditions
preserved in the Gnostic *Acts* deserve closer attention than they have
hitherto received, as we shall hope to show in the sequel by quotations
from several of them.
