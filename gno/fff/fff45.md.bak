#### iii. From the Letter to Agathōpus.

<span class="margnote">Concerning the One of the Powers of the Perfect
man.</span>The "free utterance," or perfect expression, of the Alone
Good can only be manifested by the man made perfect. Such a man was
Jesus. Thus we find Valentinus writing to Agathōpus as follows:

"It was by his unremitting self-denial in all things that Jesus attained
to \[*lit*., gained by working\] godship; he ate and drank in a peculiar
manner, without any waste. The power of continence was so great in him,
that his food did not decay in him, for he himself was without decay."

It is said that the physical body can be gradually accustomed to less
and less nutriment, and innumerable cases are on record in the East of
holy ascetics who have been able to support life on incredibly small
quantities of food. The "power" described above by Valentinus is one of
the *siddhis* mentioned in every treatise on yoga in India, and in the
Upanishads we read that "very little waste" is one of the first signs of
"success in *yoga*." We are also told that in the highest stages, after
the particles of the body have been entirely refined and made to obey
the higher will of the ascetic, a body of a still higher grade of matter
can be gradually substituted; and apparently some such ideas as these
(together with other notions) lay behind the doctrine of docetism which
was an integral part of the Gnosis.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Clement himself
also shared like views, and so did some other Fathers.
