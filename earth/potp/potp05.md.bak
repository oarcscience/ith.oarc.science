# THE PHANTOM OF THE POLES

# CHAPTER I.

### FLATTENING OF THE EARTH AT THE POLES.

Why is the earth flat at the poles? Our school-books teach that the
earth is round, and flattened at the poles; but they do not tell us why.
If the earth is solid, this question cannot be answered. If the earth be
hollow, the question is easily answered, as it could not be hollow and
at the same time round; for the opening to the interior of the earth
would then detract from the roundness just in proportion to the size of
the opening. A ball cannot be made round and have a hole in it: however
small the hole, the ball is not round to that extent.

If the earth be double, or hollow, it is built just as it would have to
be. If the earth be round, there would be no need of

this book; for that alone would settle the question for all time. To
prove a fact, one or two circumstances will sometimes be sufficient; but
not always. For instance,

not be within 20,000 miles of its walls.](tn/03000.jpg)

PLANET SATURN.  
The planet Saturn is a world within a world, and maybe more. The inner
world is flattened at the poles, and is 75,000 miles in diameter. If
hollow, the earth could move round in it, and yet not be within 20,000
miles of its walls.  

if it were claimed that the earth had an opening to the interior, and
one could show that the earth was round, that alone would be sufficient
to refute it. But, on the other hand, the fact that the earth is
flattened at the poles is not sufficient to prove that it is hollow, and
is only one of

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

the evidences to show that, if it be, the earth is in the right shape
for it. If now we can produce enough other evidence to prove that the
earth is double, then we have shown why it is flattened at the poles.
The fact that the earth is flattened at the poles is not any proof that
the earth is double, or hollow. It only shows that the shape of the
earth is not only favorable to such a condition, but absolutely
necessary, and gives a good foundation with which to start.
