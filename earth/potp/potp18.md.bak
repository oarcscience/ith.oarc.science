# CHAPTER XIV.

### HAVE OTHER THAN THE ESKIMOS INHABITED THE ARCTIC REGIONS?

I am of the opinion that another race besides Eskimos have dwelt in the
Arctic regions, and may still live, perhaps, in the interior of the
earth. If so, one cannot but think that their civilization was of a low
order--if they could be called civilized at all--from the fact that
little is or has been found to show that they were skilled in building.
If they were at all adept, or had made some slight advance, some of the
drift from the Arctic would have shown how far they had progressed. From
what Greely discovered, it is safe to conclude that if the interior of
the earth be peopled, it is by a race something akin to that now found
in the Arctic Circle. Extracts from Greely bearing on this subject will
be found hereinafter.

On page 379 he writes that he was greatly surprised to discover, against
a

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

vertical bank facing Ruggles River, three abandoned Eskimo huts, which
doubtless had been occupied in the far past as permanent abodes. "These
houses were built from large, fine pieces of slate, which were readily
obtainable from the adjoining rocks. Many pieces of this slate, as large
as three feet by two feet, were lying around, the thickness of which
varied from three-quarters of an inch to an inch and a half. The Eskimo
had utilized the steep precipitous bank against which the back of the
houses rested, and in which the chimneys were built. The houses were six
feet wide and ten feet long, though possibly they may have been longer,
as the walls most distant from the bank had fallen and partly
disappeared, through being undermined by the river. The side-walls of
the structure were about three feet in height. Apparently the whole
house had been covered with large pieces of slate, which served as a
roof, for many such pieces were found in the interior space, which was
partly filled by them. It is probable that the width of the houses

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

depended on the size of the pieces of slate which could be used as a
covering. No signs of a ridge-pole, or a wooden support to the roof,
were to be seen. We carefully removed the flat slabs, and, digging among
the dirt and moss, which was of considerable depth, found many relics
and bones, which were most numerous near the chimney, or fireplace.
Bones of the musk-ox, hare, and of various birds (and at least one kind
of fish) were found in great abundance. Among other articles were three
combs of walrus ivory, one of which had ornamental work on it, and
whalebone fish-hooks, a bone needle, and pieces of whalebone, a shoe for
a sledge-runner, and a number of other worked articles of bone and wood,
the use of which was unknown. A selection was made from the bones, in
order that it might be determined what species of animals had been
killed by the Eskimo who had occupied this place. A piece of dog-skin of
considerable size was also dug-out, which had rotted to such an extent
that it fell to pieces when handled."

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

Farther on, he says: "In the two houses and in the immediate vicinity we
collected about forty pieces of wood and worked bone. Among other
articles were one large and two small narwhal horns, two walrus ivory
toggles for dog-traces, such as are now used by the Greenlanders; an
arrow-head, two bone handles, a skinning-knife with bone handle and iron
blade, a bear's tooth, whalebone shoes for the runners of two sledges,
and a wooden upstander with a carefully made and well-fitted bone top.
Several sledge-bars, some of bone and others of wood, and a complete
wooden sledge-runner, which was very heavy, being five feet long, nine
inches high, and over two inches thick, were also discovered.

"Among other pieces of wood was a pole, nine feet long, and about two
inches in diameter, of a hard, close-grained, coniferous wood, probably
fir or hard pine. Parts of two wooden sledge-runners were badly rotted,
but one was yet in fair condition.

"There were several articles of worked

<span id="page_205">p. 205</span>

bone whose use I could not surmise, and the character of which was
unknown to our own Eskimo. The bone articles were of walrus, narwhal and
whalebone, the first being the predominating material, from which small
articles had been made. Musk-ox and hare bones were very plentiful.

"It appears evident, my Journal says, that these Eskimos had dogs,
sledges, arrows, and skinning knives, and fed on musk-oxen, seals,
hares, and occasionally fish. While this habitation does not appear to
have been covered with stones, as were those found by me on the east
side of the river, yet the arrangements indicate more than a summer
encampment.

"It is more than probable that these habitations were covered with skin
roofs, which must have been secured in a different manner from the
Greenland method, as no circles of stones were found. The construction
of these houses certainly entailed a large amount of work. In quitting
them, the roof and its supports must have been entirely removed. It is
possible

<span id="page_206">p. 206</span>

that the long pole found may have been used in some manner as a support
for the roof. It is extraordinary that, in abandoning this country, they
should have left behind the pole and the sledges, which were very
valuable, unless, indeed, their dogs perished there. The depth at which
the dog-toggles and other articles were discovered indicates their
having been left by accident where found, as they were covered by
debris, which evidently accumulated during the occupancy of these huts.

"The surroundings were carefully examined for graves, as during the
occupancy, covering at least two years, of habitations of such size, it
was likely some one must have died. No traces of any human remains could
be found, nor, indeed, of the dogs; but, in the case of the latter,
their uncared-for remains would have been devoured and their bones
removed by foxes or wolves. It is pertinent to remark that musk-ox or
other expected bones were rarely found in Grinnell Land. Nearly an hour
was spent in the examination

<span id="page_207">p. 207</span>

of these remains, after which we started westward."

On page 420 Greely again writes: "Sergeant Brainard--who seemed
intuitively to locate such places--discovered the sites of eighteen
Eskimo summer tents, and gathered near them a large number

of relics. The circles varied from five to fifteen feet in diameter.
There were two upstanders, runners, bone shoes, cross-bars, etc., making
a complete sledge; a very large stone (steatite, probably) lamp, fifteen
inches across, was broken in five pieces, and had been fastened together
by seal thongs. There was also a bone

<span id="page_208">p. 208</span>

spear-head, and other relics of like material, the use of which was
unknown to our Danish Eskimo."
