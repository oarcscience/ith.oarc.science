# CHAPTER VIII.

### METEORS OR VOLCANIC DISTURBANCES.

Herman Siemens--who was with Captain Hall on his last trip--writes about
meteors on page 257 of Hall's book: "We also saw numerous shooting
stars, sometimes forming, as it were, a silver thread, from the point
where they first appeared to that of disappearance; in a few instances I
have seen small fireballs pushing out from them similar to those of a
rocket."

I have claimed, from the start, that meteors, or so-called shooting
stars, are nothing but rocks thrown up from the earth by an exploding
volcano. Could so many shooting stars, as they are termed, come from a
passing comet, and land near the North Pole in a bunch, when it would
probably take them months, if not years, to reach the earth? Let us drop
this supernatural business, and get down to common sense, and call a
stone a stone, and a fire a fire. This misnaming should be done

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

away with forever. Our children should be taught differently, and the
sooner the better. The laws of the universe are absolute and immutable,
and no part of a star, planet, or comet can be detached from the main
body and sent sailing through space to land on this earth near the North
or South Pole.

"Far in the west falls shower after shower of stars," writes Nansen in
Vol. II, page 444, "some faint, scarcely visible, others bright like
Roman candles, all with a message from distant worlds. Low in the south
lies a bank of clouds, now and again outlined by the gleam of the
Northern Lights; but over the sea the sky is dark; there is open water
there."

Does anyone, able to read, believe that shower after shower of stars
fall near the North Pole? If there be such a person, it is apparent that
he never gave the matter any thought, or is incapable of thinking. That
rocks should be called thus! If a firefly were called the sun, or a
microbe an elephant, it would be no more absurd. Meteors are just plain
rocks thrown out

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

from the earth by an exploding volcano. An aurora might not always
appear when these rocks fall, as an explosion might not ignite, or the
burning be so small as not to show through the smoke and dust.

On the same page Nansen again writes: "Thursday, December 12th.--Between
six and nine this morning there was a number of shooting stars, most of
them in Serpentarius. Some came right from the Great Bear; afterwards
they chiefly came from the Bull or Aldebaran, or the Pleiades. Several
of them were very bright, and some drew a streak of shining dust after
them."

What is more characteristic than that the shining dust should follow a
volcanic eruption throwing out these shooting stars? The Great Bear is
located in the right direction. My contention is that shooting stars are
meteors passing through the air, thrown up by a volcanic eruption, and
all meteors that have struck the earth come out of the earth, internally
or externally. This theory about passing comets is given in lieu of a
better one, and

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

will not be advanced after the earth is shown to be hollow. Hall remarks
that the small base of one aurora proved it to be quite close to the
earth. A ball of fire fell during the display, and burst just before it
reached the earth, throwing out prismatic scintillations in every
direction.

Peary writes on page 163 that "a brilliant meteor was seen on the
northeastern sky, descending vertically, and a little later a meteor
with red and green trail was seen traveling west, about half-way to the
zenith and with a slight downward angle." Those two meteors were of the
many found in the vicinity of the North Pole, and undoubtedly came from
a volcano in the interior of the earth.

He also noticed a peculiar phenomenon: the "apparent sinking of large
areas of snow accompanied by peculiar muffled reports, which rumbled
away beneath the crust in every direction until they died away."

This could be accounted for by the volcanic disturbances in the earth,
from

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

which frequent explosions send forth stone, rocks, and dust, that fall
often in that part of the world.

To show that meteors are more likely to originate in the earth than from
some passing comet or from other source, it should be noted that when
analyzed they show no ingredients not found on earth. One writer in
Clerk's Astronomy, page 389, says: "The nearest affinities of the
mineral aggregated in them are with volcanic products from great depths.
These meteorites seem broken-up fragments of the interior parts of
globes like our own."

There is a meteor on exhibit at the Museum of Natural History, New York,
weighing many tons. If that had come from some comet a few million miles
away it would have struck the earth with such force that it would have
penetrated the hardest rock-surface hundreds of feet, and would have
melted the iron in it.
