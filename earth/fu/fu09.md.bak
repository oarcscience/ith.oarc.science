### REMARKS

###### ON THE

##### TEXT OF PROFESSOR NEUMANN.

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

### CHAPTER VI.

### FUSANG AND PERU.

SINCE the foregoing chapters were written, the author--my old friend and
teacher--has passed away, and the prophecy with which his work ended has
been singularly fulfilled. China is now thoroughly opened, and Japan,
once proverbial for its exclusiveness, goes beyond more than one
European country in her zeal to Europeanise. And I believe that time
will show, when the records of these countries shall have been more
carefully searched, that the same insight which induced Carl F. Neumann
to prophecy the speedy opening of the East, was not at fault when he
declared, on apparently slight data, his faith that in an early age the
Chinese had penetrated Western America as far as Mexico.

It should be especially observed that, in commenting on the simple
record of the old monk Hoei-Shin, Professor Neumann judiciously reminds
the reader that the information given "goes back into a period long
anterior to the most remote ages alluded to in the obscure legends of
the Aztecs, resting upon uncertain interpretations of hieroglyphics."
One thing we know, that in America, as in Asia or Europe, one wave of
emigration

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

and conquest swept after another, each destroying in a great measure all
traces of its predecessor. Thus in Peru the Inca race ruled over the
lower caste, and would in time have probably extinguished it. But the
Incas themselves were preceded by another and evidently more gifted
race, since it is now known that these mysterious predecessors were far
abler than themselves as architects. "Who this race were," says
Prescott, <span id="fr_48"></span>[1](#fn_48.md) "and whence they came, may
afford a tempting theme for inquiry to the speculative antiquarian. But
it is a land of darkness, that lies far beyond the domain of history."

Problems as difficult, and far more unpromising, have, however, been
solved within a few years, and entire literatures, histories, and
languages have been exhumed, literally from the soil. Let me instance,
for example, the earthen cylinders of Nineveh, of whose records it may
not only be said, "Dust thou art, and to dust shalt thou return," but
also, in the higher spirit of Christianity and humanity, "and from dust
thon shalt rise again." *Nullæ latent, quæ non patent*. And there is a
possibility that even in this secret of secrets, Old Peru, there lurks
some slight possibility of elucidating the question of the Chinese in
Mexico in the fifth century. For as the American waves of conquest,
flowed south, it is no extravagant hypothesis to assume that the race of
men whom the monk encountered in "Fusang" may possibly have had
something in common with what was

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

afterwards found farther south in the land of the Incas. One thing is
certain, that there is a singularly Peruvian air in all that this short
narrative tells us of the land Fusang. Fortified places, it says, were
unknown, though there was evidently a high state of civilisation; and
yet this strange anomaly appears to have actually existed in ancient
Peru, for Prescott speaks of the system of fortifications established
through the empire as though it had originated with the Incas. Most
extraordinary is, however, the remark of the monk that the houses are
built with wooden beams. Now, as houses, all the world over, are
generally constructed in this manner, the remark might seem almost
superfluous. However, the Peruvians built their houses with wooden
beams, and, as Prescott tells us, "knew no better way of holding the
beams together than tying them with the thongs of *maguey*." Now, be it
remarked that the monk makes a direct transition from speaking of the
textile fibre and fabric of the maguey to the wooden beams of the
houses--a coincidence which is at least striking, though it be no proof.
It is precisely as though he had the maguey in his memory, and were
about to add it to his mention of the wooden beams. And we may notice
that this construction of houses was admirably adapted to a land of
earthquakes such as Southern America, and that Prescott himself
testifies that a number of them "still survive, while the more modern
constructions of the conquerors are buried in ruins."

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

Most strikingly Peruvian is the monk's account of the kingdom and the
nobles. The name Ichi is very like the natural Chinese pronunciation of
the word Inca. The stress laid on the three ranks of nobles suggests the
Peruvian Inca castes of lower grade, as well as the Mexican; while the
stately going forth of the king, "accompanied by horns and trumpets,"
vividly recalls Prescott's account of the journeyings of the Peruvian
potentate. The change of the colour of his garments according to the
astronomical cycle is, however, more thoroughly in accordance with the
spirit of the institutions of the Children of the Sun than anything
which we have met in the whole of this strange and obsolete record. And
it is indeed remarkable that Professor Neumann, who had already
indicated the southern course of Aztec or of Mexican civilisation, and
who manifested, as the reader may have observed, so much shrewdness in
adducing testimony for the old monk's narrative, did not search more
closely into Peruvian history for that confirmation which a slight
inquiry seems to indicate is by no means wanting in it. Thus, with
regard to the observation of the seasons, Prescott, tells us that "the
ritual of the Incas involved a routine of observances as complex and
elaborate as ever distinguished that of any nation, whether pagan or
Christian." Each month had its appropriate festival, or rather
festivals. The four principal had reference to the sun, and commemorated
the great periods of his annual progress, the solstices and equinoxes.
Garments of a peculiar wool,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

and feathers of it peculiar colour, were reserved to the Inca. I cannot
identify the blue, red, yellow, and black (curiously reminding one of
the alchemical elementary colours still preserved by a strange feeling
for antiquity or custom in chemists' windows), but it is worthy of
remark that the rainbow was the Inca's special attribute or scutcheon,
and that his whole life was passed in accordance with the requisitions
of astronomical festivals; and the fact that different colours were
reserved to him, and identified with him, is very curious, and
establishes a strange analogy with the narrative of Hoei-shin.

I would, however, specially observe on this subject of the cycles and
changes of colours corresponding to astronomical mutations, that
Montesinos <span id="fr_49"></span>[1](#fn_49.md) expressly asserts that
the Peruvians threw their years into cycles of ten--a fact which has
quite escaped the notice of Neumann, who conjectures that the decade of
Fusang may have been a subdivision of the Aztec period, or even have
been used as an independent one, as was indeed the case with the
Chinese, who termed these notations "stems." "It is worthy of remark,"
he adds, "that among the Mongols and Mantchous these 'stems' are named
after colours, which, perhaps, have some relation to the several colours
of the royal clothing in the cycles of Fusang. These Tartaric tribes
term the first two years of the ten-year cyclus, green and greenish,

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

the next red and reddish, and so on, yellow and yellowish, white and
whitish, and finally black and blackish." <span
id="fr_50"></span>[1](#fn_50.md)

Peru, certainly, is not Mexico; but I would here recall my former
observation that Mexico *might* have been at one time peopled by a race
having Peruvian customs, which in after years were borne by them far to
the south. The ancient mythology and ethnography of Mexico present in
their turn a mass of curious, though perhaps accidental, identities with
those of Asia. And both Mexico and Peru had the tradition of a deluge
from which seven prisoners escaped. In the hieroglyphs of the former
country, these seven are represented as issuing from an egg.

We may note also that a Peruvian tradition declares the first
missionaries of civilisation who visited them to have been white and
bearded. "This may remind us," says Prescott, "of the tradition existing
among the Aztecs in respect to Quetzalcoatl, the good deity, who, with a
similar garb and aspect, came up the great plateau from the east, on a
like benevolent mission

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

to the natives." In the same way the Aesir, Children of Light, or of the
Sun, came from the east to Scandinavia, and taught the lore of the gods.

The Peruvian embalming of the royal dead takes us back to Egypt; the
burning of the wives of the deceased Incas reveals India; the singularly
patriarchal character of the whole Peruvian policy is like that of China
in the olden time; while the system of espionage, of tranquillity, of
physical well-being, and the iron-like immovability in which their whole
social frame was cast bring before us Japan--as it was a very few years
ago. In fact, there is something strangely Japanese in the entire cultus
of Peru as described by all writers.

It is remarkable that the Supreme Being of the Peruvians was worshipped
under the names of Pacha-comac, "He who sustains or gives life to the
universe," and of Viracocha, <span id="fr_51"></span>[1](#fn_51.md) "Foam
of the Sea," a name strikingly recalling Venus Aphrodite, the female and
second principle of life in many ancient mythologies. Not less curious
(if authentic) is the tradition of the Vestal Virgins of the Sun, who,
it is said, were buried alive if detected in an intrigue, and whose duty
it was to keep burning the sacred fire obtained at the festival of
Raymi.

"Vigilemque sacraverat ignem  
Excubias divûm æternas."

This fire was obtained, as by the ancient Romans, on

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

a precisely similar occasion, by means of a concave mirror of polished
metal. <span id="fr_52"></span>[1](#fn_52.md) The Incas, in order to
preserve purity of race, married their own sisters, as did the kings of
Persia, and of other Oriental nations, urged by a like feeling of pride,
and possibly in accordance with a faith in the physical law set forth a
few years ago in the *Fortnightly* and the *Westminster Reviews*. Among
the Peruvians, *mama* signified mother, while *papa* was applied to the
chief priest. "With both, the term seems to embrace in its most
comprehensive sense the paternal relation, in which it is more
familiarly employed by most of the nations of Europe."

It has been observed that, as in the case of the Green Corn Festival of
the Creek Indians of Georgia, <span id="fr_53"></span>[2](#fn_53.md) many
striking analogies can be established between the Indian tribes of North
America and the Peruvians. Gallatin has shown the affinity of languages
between all the American aborigines. It is possible that the first race
which subsequently spread southward, may with modifications have
occupied the entire north.

Let the reader also remember, that while the proofs of the existence or
residence of Orientals in America are extremely vague and uncertain--and
I trust that it

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

will be borne in mind that this admission has been made sincerely and
cheerfully--and while they are supported only by coincidences, the
*antecedent probability* of their having come hither, or having been
able to come, is stronger than the Nurse discovery of the New World, or
even than that of Columbus himself would appear to be. Let the reader
take the map of the Northern Pacific; let him ascertain for himself the
fact that from Kamtschatka, which was well known to the old Chinese, to
Aliaska, the journey is far less arduous than from China proper, and it
will be seen that there was in all probability abundant intercourse of
some kind between the continents. In early times, the Chinese were bold
and skilful navigators, to whom the chain of the Aleutian Islands would
have been simply like stepping-stones over a shallow brook to a child.
For it is a well-ascertained fact, that a sailor in an open boat might
cross from Asia to America by the Aleutian Islands in summer-time, and
hardly ever be out of sight of land, and this in a part of the sea
generally abounding in fish, as is proved by the fishermen who inhabit
many of these islands, on which fresh water is always to be found. Nor
when in Aliaska would the emigrant from Asia he deterred, during half
the year at least, by the severity of the climate. If the country be
not, as the late Mr Seward was jocosely said to have declared, abounding
in pine-apples and polar bears, icebergs and strawberries, it is at
least tolerably habitable, as I know by the testimony of several
friends--

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

one of whom even wintered out there while searching for gold--and from a
Russian-English newspaper published in that remote country. From a
number of this newspaper, containing the advertisement of books
published by Nicholas Trübner of London, I infer that a very fair degree
of luxury, not devoid of erudition, may now be attained in Aliaska. In
short, to an enterprising Buddhist monk, inspired with the zeal of a
missionary, this journey to Fusang does not present one half the
difficulties which thousands of exactly such monks undergo at the
present day in their journeyings over the vast and sterile plains and
through the hostile mountain ranges of Central Asia. I have, indeed, no
doubt that, even as I write, there is living, travelling, and preaching,
more than one such Eastern Cordelier, bearing literally the very name of
Hoei-shin, whose journeyings have been as wide, as wild, and as weary as
those of him who long ago returned and told, like King Thibault of
Navarre, his story of lands beyond sea--

"Outre mer, j’ay fait mon pélerinage,  
Et souffert ay moult grande dommage,"

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --and so passed
away to a quiet cloister grave. The bedesman sleeps among his ashes
cold, little thinking, before he died, that, more than a thousand years
after his story had been told it would rise again thousands of miles
away, and go, for men to read, even in Tahan itself.

Seriously enough, the only real marvel as regards the

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

probability of the Chinese having been in Mexico thirteen hundred years
ago would be that they were never there, and did not make the journey.
When we see a nation, as China once was, with a religious propaganda,
sending missionaries thousands of miles beyond its borders; boasting a
commerce, and gifted with astronomers and geographers of no mean
ability, we must certainly believe that it made many discoveries. And
when we find its pioneers advancing for centuries in a certain
direction, chronicling correctly every step made, and accurately
describing the geography and ethnography of every region on the way, we
have no ground to deny the last advance which their authentic history
claims to have made, hog ever indisposed we may be to admit it. One
tiling, at least, will probably be cheerfully conceded by the impartial
reader, that the subject well deserves further investigation, which it
will obtain from those students who are occupied in exploring the
mysteries of Oriental literature and the archæology of both worlds.

<span id="page_60">p. 60</span>

### NOTE TO CHAPTER VI.

I would not be understood as intimating that the civilisation of Fusang
was simply Peruvian. Some of the peculiarities observed by
Hoei-shin--as, for example, the manner of wooing, the exposure of the
dead, and the possible origin of his Kingdom of Women--existed in a
strongly-marked form among the Red Indians; others recall New Mexican or
Aztec culture, as it may have been ere driven south; and there are,
withal, Siberian-Mongolian traces. But I cannot resist the feeling,
which has grown on me through years of study on this subject, that in
the fifth century the Buddhist monk visited a race combining
characteristics and customs which afterwards spread to the south and
cast. All that he observed is singularly American, and, from the tone of
the narrative, was evidently new to the missionary. Since Prescott
wrote, many investigators have declared that the civilisation once
attributed entirely to the Incas, was derived by them from earlier races
which they had supplanted. Thus Thomas J. Hutchinson ("Two Years in
Peru, by T. J. Hutchinson, F.R.G.S. &c.," London, 1873) tells us that
the Chincas preceded the Yuncas, and that the Yuncas were conquered by
the Inca Pachacutec so recently as the fifteenth century of our era.
Tradition also gives the names of several races as preceding the Chincas
in Peru. It is, however, conjectured that, whatever the race may have
been which occupied Peru, it took from its predecessors culture which
they in like manner had inherited. In endeavouring to find some analogy
between Fusang as described by Hoei-shin, and Peru as described by
Prescott, I by no means consider that the customs attributed to the
Incas were unknown before their time.

pointed out, in some remarks to which I shall again have occasion to
refer, that there are many curious circumstances as to the use of
colours in connection with numbers; and that, for instance in many of
the prehistoric languages, the word for red and that for the number two
were identical. Very little can be inferred from this, and nothing can
be based upon it, but the coincidence, though slight, is curious, and
may serve as a basis for future observation. Red, it may be remarked, is
the second colour in the Fusang cyclus as mentioned by Hoei-shin. In the
symbolism of the Roman Catholic Chinch, blue and white are identified in
the Pope, but the Cardinals next him, or the second rank, wear red. Red,
as I have already indicated, was the colour both of the second Tartar
and second Fusang couple of years in the cyclus.
