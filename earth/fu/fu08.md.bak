### CHAPTER V.

### CHINESE AND JAPANESE IN KAMTSCHATKA AND THE HAWAIIAN GROUP.

A NUMBER of facts, taken from the occurrences of later times, may be
alleged to support the theory of a former intercourse of China and Japan
with the islands which lie between those countries and America, and also
with the western coast of the latter. Even if the Chinese and Japanese
(to whom, with their knowledge of the compass, such an enterprise would
have presented no difficulties) have never at any time intentionally
undertaken a voyage to America, it has nevertheless happened that ships
from Eastern Asia, China, and Japan, as well as those of Russians from
Ochotsk and Kamtschatka, have been cast away on the islands and coasts
of the New World. <span id="fr_43"></span>[1](#fn_43.md) The earliest
Spanish travellers and discoverers heard of foreign merchants who had
landed on the north-west coast of America, and even assert that they saw
fragments of a Chinese vessel. <span id="fr_44"></span>[2](#fn_44.md) This
much we know, that the crew of a Japanese junk accidentally

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

discovered a great continent in the East, remained there over winter,
and safely returned home. The Japanese have remarked that the land
extended further to the north-west. <span id="fr_45"></span>[1](#fn_45.md)
They may have wintered in California, and then coasted as far north as
Aliaska. Another Japanese vessel was wrecked about the end of the year
1832 on Oahu, one of the Sandwich Islands, concerning which the
*Hawaiian Spectator* contained the following observation: <span
id="fr_46"></span>[2](#fn_46.md)--"This Japanese vessel had nine men on
board, who were bringing fish from one of the southern Chinese islands
to Jeddo. A storm blew them out into the open sea, where they were
driven about between ten and eleven months, until they finally landed in
the haven Waiala, in the island Oahu. The ship was wrecked, but the men
were brought safely to Honolulu, where they remained eighteen months,
and then, by their own desire, were sent to Kamtschatka, whence they
hoped to steal quietly into their own country; for the barbarously cruel
Government of Japan, <span id="fr_47"></span>[3](#fn_47.md) mindful of the
artifices of the Portuguese

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Jesuits, and
continually fearing some plot on the part of the neighbouring Russians,
have forbidden even the return of their own shipwrecked countrymen. As
the natives of Hawaii," so continues the Spectator, "saw these
foreigners, so similar to themselves in external appearance, and in many
manners and customs, they were astonished, and declared unanimously,
'There is no doubt ou the subject; we came from Asia.'" Another example
of a Japanese vessel in America, and of the unreflecting, jealous policy
of the Dairi, is as follows:--During the winter of 1833-34, a Japanese
junk was wrecked on the north-west coast of America, in the vicinity of
Queen Charlotte's Island, and the numerous crew, weakened by hunger,
were murdered by the natives, with the exception of two persons. The
Hudson Bay Company kindly took charge of these survivors, and sent them,
in 1834, to England, whence they were forwarded to Macao. This was
considered a fortunate event, and the English hoped that the Japanese
Government, mindful of such kind treatment of their subjects, would show
themselves grateful, and perhaps remove the restrictions against all
foreigners. In vain. The ship that was to restore to the Japanese rulers
their subjects, and at the same time aid in the missionary enterprise
(Karl Gützlaff being on board), was received with a salute of
cannon-balls, and obliged to leave, with unfulfilled intentions, the
shores of this inhospitable land.

All of these facts show, however, and indeed sufficiently,

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

that. the passage of Eastern Asiatics to the western islands and shores
of America is in the highest degree possible. And it is also possible
that the inhabitants of these islands, in their weak boats, may from
time to time, accidentally or intentionally, have landed upon the
Asiatic Continent. "It is wonderful," says the Jesuit Hieronymus
d’Angelis, the first European who landed in Jeso (A.D. 1618), "how bold
and experienced are these people in the management of their vessels. In
their frail boats they often undertake voyages of from two to three
months' duration; and however often they may be wrecked, still there are
ever new adventurers ready to take their place and run the same risks."

### THE FUTURE OF EASTERN ASIA.

The pride and barbarism of the numerous countries situated on the coasts
of Asia and America, as well as of the inhabitants of the islands lying
between, have forbidden hitherto any hope of a relation, commercial or
otherwise, between them and the more enlightened world. Our age,
however, which has broken through so many obstacles, never again to be
closed, will ultimately break the chains of Eastern Asia, and give a
world-movement (*Weltbewegung*) to the immense numbers imprisoned there.
When this shall have been fully accomplished--and the beginning has
already taken place--we can first hope for a regular, unbroken union
between the Eastern and the Western World.

London, 1843. I have been personally well acquainted with both these
writers, and can commend their works as those of men of accurate
observation. Jarvis states that, according to the tradition of the
islanders, several such vessels had been wrecked upon Hawaii before the
island was discovered by whites or Europeans.--C. G. L.

remember that all this was written thirty years ago, before Japan had
entered on the great race of civilisation.
