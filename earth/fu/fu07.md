### CHAPTER IV.

### REMARKS ON THE REPORT OF HOEI-SHIN.

THE land west of the Indus, known to us at the present day under the
names of Avghanistan and Beloochistan, was converted, shortly after the
death of the Indian reformer Buddha, to his doctrine, which spread the
system of castes, and was founded upon the principle of universal love.

It bears in the reports of the Chinese Buddhists the name Kipin, which
appears in the different forma of Kaphen, Kaphes, and Kaphante, in the
description of rivers and cities in Gedrosia and Arachosia by several of
the older writers. <span id="fr_23"></span>[1](#fn_23.md) Here the third
leader of the religion of the King's Son of Kapilapura had chosen his
seat, <span id="fr_24"></span>[2](#fn_24.md) and here his disciples
flourished in great power, as their numerous monuments and ruins
indicate, until the seventh and eighth centuries, when the fanatic
Moslem promulgated the doctrines of their own prophet with fire and
sword.

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> To its holy city
came many of the monks of Middle Asia and China, and from Kophene again
the religion extended itself to many parts of the world, even to North
America and Mexico.

How these American lands were named by their inhabitants we know not, as
seems indeed to be generally the case with most new discoveries of this
nature. We know only that they received the name Fusang, which was that
of a tree common to these countries and Eastern Asia, or, it would more
probably appear, that of an Asiatic tree resembling it in one or more
particulars; for it seems to be a natural and usual circumstance to name
a newly-discovered land after some striking peculiarity of the kind. The
Norsemen, who landed in America five hundred years after these Buddhist
priests, named it in a similar manner Winaland--Wine or Vine land--from
the number of wild grapes which grew there. On account of the great
distance of the land Fusang, no missionaries went there afterwards. And
yet the story of this land, so full of marvels, has not yet disappeared
from the memories of Chinese and Buddhist inquirers into the wonders of
the olden time. Many of them have frequently mentioned it in their
works, and have even drawn maps of it, <span
id="fr_25"></span>[1](#fn_25.md) and taken the pains, in their thoughtless,
unreflecting manner, to collect all the accounts which we have here
given. Also, at a later period, their mythical geographers and poets
often availed themselves of this piece of knowledge, and,

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

as was the case in the West <span id="fr_26"></span>[1](#fn_26.md) with the
land of Prester John, spun it out into all manner of strange tales. But
these beautiful and romantic fancies about the land and tree Fusang can
have no more weight with the impartial seeker into the truth of
historical tradition than the legends of Alexander and of Charlemagne
with the student of Arrian and Eginhard. <span
id="fr_27"></span>[2](#fn_27.md)

The distance of the land from Tahan or Aliaska, which extends, according
to the estimate before given, from the fifty-seventh to the fifty-eighth
degree, leads us necessarily to the north-west coast of Mexico, and the
vicinity of San Blas. Not less decisively do the Buddhist-Chinese
reports indicate this part of the world. But before we can avail
ourselves of these later accounts of the Aztecs, a difficulty must be
removed, which would otherwise annihilate the complete mass of proofs.

### THE OLDEST HISTORY OF MEXICO.

The information given by our Buddhist travellers goes back into times
long anterior to the most remote periods alluded to in the obscure
legends of the

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Aztecs, resting
upon uncertain interpretations of hieroglyphics. One fact is, however,
deeply rooted in this trembling soil of Old America: the races of
barbarians which successively followed each other from the north to the
south always murdered, hunted down, and subdued the previous
inhabitants, and formed in course of time a new social and political
life upon the ruins of the old system, to be again destroyed and renewed
in a few centuries, by a new invasion of barbarians. The later native
conquerors in the New World can, of course, no more be considered in the
light of original inhabitants than the present races of men in the Old
World.

### THE RUINS OF MITLA AND PALENQUE. <span id="fr_28"></span>[1](#fn_28.md)

The ruins named after the adjacent places, Mitla and Palenque, situated
in the province Zzendales, near the limits of the municipality of Cuidad
Real and Yucatan, have been supposed by enthusiastic scholars to possess
an antiquity anterior, by thousands of years, to the coming of our Lord.
Prejudiced and ignorant visionaries have imagined this to be the home of
all spiritual cultivation, and even to have discovered here traces of
Buddhism. The Tolteks--a word signifying architects

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --appeared about
the middle of the seventh century, and one of their literary
productions, known as "The Divine Book," existed, according to an
unauthenticated legend, until the time of the Spaniards. The Aztecs, on
the contrary, came to Anahuac, or "The Land near the Water," during the
reign of Frederick the Second. <span id="fr_29"></span>[1](#fn_29.md) The
savage invaders evinced at first the greatest hostility to the religion
and social institutions of the conquered race, but feeling ultimately
themselves the want of a regular system, they erected a new edifice upon
the old ruins. This may prove advantageous in an intellectual or
intelligent (*subjectiv*), as well as a material point of view, since we
can thus avail ourselves of a knowledge of the laws, manners, and
customs of the Aztecs, in order to obtain a clearer conception of the
condition of the earlier races who inhabited this land. <span
id="fr_30"></span>[2](#fn_30.md) The most learned historian of New Spain
has already recognised in every particular, and in connection with the
results of the most recent inquiries, the original affinity of the
numerous Mexican languages.

The pyramidic-symbolic form of many of the Mexican monuments appears,
indeed, to have a resemblance with the religious edifices of the
Buddhists for places of interment; but neither their architecture nor
ornaments, according to Castañeda's drawings of Mexican antiquities,
indicate any East Indian symbol, unless we

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

are willing to admit their eight rings or stories as such. <span
id="fr_31"></span>[1](#fn_31.md) According to a Buddhistic legend, the
remains of Schakia were placed in eight metallic jars, and over these as
many temples were erected. <span id="fr_32"></span>[2](#fn_32.md) But if
Buddhism ever flourished in Central America, it certainly was not the
pure religion of Schakia as it now exists in Nepaul, Thibet, and other
parts of Asia, but a new religion, built upon its foundations. For the
missionaries of Schakiamunis were in a manner Jesuits, who, the more
readily to attain their aim, either based their doctrines upon, or
intermixed them with, the existing manners and customs. The myth of the
birth of the terrible Aztec god of war may possibly be a faded remain of
the old Indian religion. Huitzilopotschli of Mexico was born in the same
wonderful manner as Schakia of India; his mother saw a ball floating in
the air, but one of shining feathers, placed it in her bosom, became
pregnant, and gave birth to the terrible son, who came into the world
with a spear in his right hand, a shield in his left, and a waving tuft
of green feathers on his head. Juan de Grijalva, the nephew of
Velasquez, was so much struck with the many instances of a high state of
civilisation, and particularly with the magnificent buildings of Mexico,
that he named the

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

peninsula New Spain, which term has since been extended to a much
greater portion of the New World.

### FUSANG, MAGUEY, AGAVE AMERICANA.

We know that the flora of the north-western part of America is closely
allied to that of China, Japan, and other lands of Eastern Asia. <span
id="fr_33"></span>[1](#fn_33.md) We may also assume that the Fusang-tree
was formerly found in America, and afterwards, through neglect, became
extinct. Tobacco and Indian-corn seen always to have been as natural to
China as to the New World. <span id="fr_34"></span>[2](#fn_34.md) It is,
however, much more probable that the traveller described a plant
hitherto unknown to him, which supplies as many wants in Mexico as the
original Fusang is said to do in Eastern Asia--I mean the great American
aloe (*Agave Americana*), called by the Indians "Maguey," which is so
remarkably abundant in the plains of New Spain. From the crushed leaves,
even at the present day, a firm paper is prepared. Upon such paper those
hieroglyphic manuscripts alluded to by the Buddhist missionary, and
destroyed by the fanatic Spaniards, were written. From the sap an
intoxicating drink is made. Its large stiff leaves serve to roof their
low huts, and the fibres supply them with a variety of thread and ropes.
From the boiled roots they prepare an agreeable food, and the thorns
serve for pins and

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

needles. This wonderful plant, therefore, provides them with food,
drink, clothing, and writing materials; being, in fact, so fully
satisfactory to every want of the Mexicans, that many persons, well
acquainted with the land and its inhabitants, have asserted that the
maguey-plant must be exterminated ere sloth and idleness, the two great
impediments which hinder them from attaining a higher social position,
can be checked.

### METALS AND MONEY.

The use of iron, now found so plentifully in New Spain, was, as the
Buddhist correctly remarked, unknown in Mexico. Copper and brass
supplied its place, as was indeed the case at an early period in other
countries. The natives prepared, according to Antonio de Herrera, two
sorts of copper, a hard and a soft, the former of which was used to
manufacture cutting tools and agricultural instruments, and the latter
for pots and all manner of household implements. They understood the
working of silver, tin, and lead mines; but neither the silver nor the
gold which they picked up on the surface of the earth, or found in the
beds of rivers, served as a circulating medium. These metals were not
particularly prized in that land. Pieces of tin in the form of a common
hammer, <span id="fr_35"></span>[1](#fn_35.md) and bundles of

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

cacao containing a determined number of seeds, were the usual money.

### LAWS AND CUSTOMS OF THE AZTECS.

The laws of the Aztecs were very strict, yet in the few remaining
fragments of their hieroglyphical pictures we find no trace of the
regulations of the land "Fusang." There existed, however, in the days of
Montezuma, an hereditary nobility, divided into several ranks, of which
authors give contradictory statements. Zurita speaks of four orders of
chiefs, who were exempted from the payment of taxes, and enjoyed other
immunities. <span id="fr_36"></span>[1](#fn_36.md)

Their method of marrying resembled that practised at the present day in
Kamtschatka. We have no account of their mourning ceremonies, but know
that the king had a particular palace in which he passed the time of
mourning for his nearest relatives. <span id="fr_37"></span>[2](#fn_37.md)
On the festivals of the gods they sounded horns and trumpets this may
have been done by the companions of the king, as to a representative of
the godhead. <span id="fr_38"></span>[3](#fn_38.md)

The Aztecs reckoned according to a period of fifty-two years, and knew
very exactly the time of the revolution of the earth about the ann. The
ten-year cyclus spoken of in the Chinese report may have been a
subdivision of the Aztec period, or have even been

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

used as an independent period, as was the case with the Chinese, who
term their notations "stems." It is worthy of remark that among the
Mongols and Mantchous these "stems" are named after colours, which
perhaps have some relation to the several colours of the royal clothing
in the cyclus of Fusang. <span id="fr_39"></span>[1](#fn_39.md) These
Tartaric tribes term the first two years of the ten-year cyclus "green
and greenish;" the two next "red and reddish," <span
id="fr_40"></span>[2](#fn_40.md) and so, in continuation, yellow and
yellowish, white and whitish, and finally black and blackish. It
appears, however, impossible to bring this cyclus of the Aztecs into any
relation with those of the Asiatics, who universally reckon by periods
of sixty years.

### DOMESTIC ANIMALS.

The Aztecs had no beasts of draught or of burden. Horses were not found
in the New World. The report of the Chinese missionary has, therefore,
no connection with the later Mexican reigns. Two varieties of wild oxen
with large horns ranged in herds on the plains of the Rio del
Norte. <span id="fr_41"></span>[3](#fn_41.md) These might have been tamed
by the earlier inhabitants, and used as domestic animals. Stag's horns
have been found in the ruins of Mexican buildings; and Montezuma showed
the Spaniards, as curiosities, immensely large horns of this
description.

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> It is possible
that the stags formerly ranged from New California, and other regions of
North America, where they are still found in great numbers, to the
interior of Mexico. To a native of China it must have seemed remarkable
that the Mexicans should have prepared butter from hind's milk, since
such a thing has seldom been done in China, either in ancient or modern
times. When the inhabitants of Chusan saw the English sailors milking
she-goats, they could not retain their gravity. It is indeed possible
that the Chinese have described an animal similar to the horse with the
character *Ma*, or horse, for changes of this nature are of frequent
occurrence. <span id="fr_42"></span>[1](#fn_42.md) In such a manner many
names of animals in the Old World have been applied to others of an
entirely different nature in the New. The eastern limits of the Asiatic
Continent are also the limits of the native land of the horse, and it
appears that it was first taken in the third century of our era from
Korea into Japan. But let the error in regard to the American horses
have come from what source it will, the unprejudiced, circumspect
inquirer will not be

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

determined on account of it to declare the entire story of Fusang-Mexico
an idle tale. It appears to me that this description of the western
coast of America is at least as authentic as the discovery of the
eastern coast, as narrated in Icelandic sagas.

the gipsies speak of a fox as a *weshni juckal*, or wood-dog; of an
elephant as a *boro nakkescro gry*, or great-nosed horse; of a monkey as
a *bombaros*, and a lion as a *boro bombaros*, or big monkey, from their
connection in menageries. Professor Neumann was probably ignorant of the
fact, to which I allude more fully in another place, that the fossil
remains of many horses found in America are of so recent a period,
according to Professor Leidy, that they were probably coeval with
man.--C. G. L.
