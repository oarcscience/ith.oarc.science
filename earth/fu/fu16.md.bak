### CHAPTER XIII.

### DEGUIGNES, KLAPROTH, AND D'EICHTHAL.

THE reader has probably inferred, from the allusions to Deguignes in
Professor Neumann's work, that the Chinese discovery of Fusang is no
novelty to the world of science. More than a century ago that sagacious
and sensible *savant* discussed in the "Mémoires de l’Académie des
Inscriptions et Belles Lettres" (vol. xxviii., 1761), "Les Navigations
des Chinois du côté de l’Amérique, et sur plusieurs Peuples situés à
l’extrémité de l’Asie Orientale," and endeavoured to confirm the memoir
by Hoei-shin. The Chinese scholar Klaproth attempted to refute
Deguignes, but employed arguments which a more recent writer,
D’Eichthal, with the aid of far more extended and accurate information,
has in turn refuted. It is true, Deguignes was no more able to
absolutely *prove* that Hoei-shin and his predecessors were in
California, than we are at the present day. But he did his best, by
adducing such testimony as he could collect; and we have at least the
satisfaction of knowing that something has been added to it, and that
more may

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

be contributed, until at last the work shall be completed.

A thorough history of the question would have made it proper to begin
with Deguignes, or rather with Kampfer (bk. i. c. iv.), who speaks so
positively of the great Eastern Continent beyond Kamtschatka, discovered
by the Japanese. But as the translation by Neumann from the Chinese
original is more complete, and as he has succinctly set forth the whole
question as it was in his time, I judged it best to give preference to
the translation of his work, and then add the letter of Colonel Kennon,
which refers directly to so many statements made by Neumann--a course
which will not seem out of place to those who will bear in mind that
Colonel Kennon, who has accurately surveyed and mapped every mile of the
North Pacific, and every acre of its shores on either side, is therefore
as practically familiar with the possibilities of the route as any man
can be. The importance of his testimony at the present clay, and the
advanced state of our geographical knowledge, will appear to those who
will consult the curious Japanese map brought to Europe by Kampfer, and
given by him to Hans Sloane, representing the North Pacific; or the
almost as erroneous chart of the same by Philippe Bundle, which is given
with a facsimile of the former in Deguignes' Memoir ("Memoires de Lit.
et de l’Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres," vol. xxv
iii., 1701). having done this, I propose

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

to present in a condensed form an examination of the whole subject as it
appeared in 1564 to M. Gustave d’Eichthal, a scholar well known for his
learning and enthusiasm in Greek literature and other subjects. But
before passing to the work of M. G. d’Eichthal, I shall touch on a few
points in the excellent article by Deguignes, which should not be
neglected. He himself regarded the facts which he had collected as
authentic, and not as mere conjectures, like those indulged in by
Grotius, [Delaët](errata.htm#1.md), and others, relative to the early
settlement of America--of which latter I may observe, that the reader
who is desirous to know what they are, can find them all appropriately
set forth and commented on in Irving's "Knickerbocker History of New
York," a most fitting receptacle for theories which by their absurdity
have become the legitimate property of the humorist. Deguignes attempted
honestly and modestly to adhere to observation and probability, and the
result is that his ideas have been, in part at least, confirmed, and the
arguments of his opponents proved unsound.

His first step was to show that Li-yen, a Chinese historian who lived at
the beginning of the seventh century, speaks of a country named Fou-sang
(Fusang) which was more than 40,000 *li* east of the eastern shore of
China. To reach it, "one must depart from the province of Lean-tong,
north of Pekin, and that after travelling 12,000 *li*, the traveller
would reach Japan; and thence to the north, after a journey of 7000
*li*,

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

arrive at the country of Ven-chin" (Wen-schin, the Painted People).
"Five thousand *li* from this country, towards the east, is Ta-han,
which is 20,000 *li* from Fou-sang." As Deguignes remarked, "Of all
these, we only know the Leao-tong, the northern province of China,
whence vessels sailed; and Japan, which was the principal station for
Chinese vessels. The three other points on the journey are the Ven-chin
country, Ta-han, and Fou-sang. I hope to show that the first is Jeso,
the second Kamtschatka, and the third a place about California."

The next step was naturally enough to determine what was the length of a
*li* in China in the fifth century. But this was difficult; for, as
Deguignes remarks, "Although at the present day 250 *li* make a degree,
they have varied in the past, not only under different dynasties, but in
different provinces. Father Gaubil, who made deep researches in Chinese
astronomy, did not venture to decide this measure. He tells us that the
greater portion of the *literati* under the reign of Han maintained that
a thousand *li*, drawn from south to north, made a difference of an inch
of shadow at noon on a dial of eight feet. Those who succeeded them
thought that this measurement was incorrect, since they judged according
to the standard of the *li* in vogue in their own time. But if we cast
our eyes on the *li* adopted by the astronomers of the dynasty of Leam,
who flourished at the beginning of the sixth century ("Observations
Astronomiques du Pére Gaubil,"

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

vol. ii.), we shall find a considerable difference, since their 250 *li*
from north to south give in like manner an inch in difference. . . . .
But uncertainty may in this case be avoided by observing that from
Leao-tong to the island of Toni-ma-tao is fixed as a distance of 7000
*li*, and, in accordance with the *li* thus established, the 12,000 *li*
from Leao-tong to Japan end in the centre of the island, about Mea-co,
its capital."

Deguignes determined, with great intelligence, that the country of the
Wen-schin, 7000 *li* north-west of Japan, must be Jeso, from the exact
agreement of the accounts given of that country by Chinese historians of
the early part of the sixth century (Goei-chi and Ven-hien-tum-hao, A.D.
510-515) with that of Dutch navigators in 1643 ("Ambassade des
Hollandois au Japon," vol. i. p. 10; "Recueil des Voyages au Nord," vol.
iii. p. 44). Both describe the extraordinary appearance of the natives,
and speak of the abundance of a peculiar mineral resembling quicksilver.
"Five thousand *li* from this country, to the east, lies Tahan. The
manners of the people here were like those of Wen-schin, but they spoke
a different language."

I trust that it will be specially observed by those who think the
journey from China to Aliaska improbable, on account of the dreariness
of the country and its great discomfort, that the old travellers cited
by Deguignes speak of the Chinese navigators as habitually passing
through many Tartar tribes,

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

crossing the Great Desert of Chamo, passing over the ice of a great lake
in the country of Ko-li-ban, and, north of it, through a chain of
mountains, where the nights in summer were so short that one could
hardly roast a leg (or breast) of mutton between sunset and sunrise. But
the degree to which the dreariness of a country will deter a traveller
must depend upon the traveller himself. Colonel Kennon, in his letter,
speaks of the years which he passed in a little pilot-boat, on probably
the very route traversed by Hoei-shin, as the happiest of his life;
while, as to the land, Lieu-tenant Cochran, who in 1823 had the
hardihood to go on foot from St Petersburg to Kamtschatka, found the
latter country delightful, and speaks pleasure of the entertainments
there. It is true that he there wooed and won a wife, an incident of all
others most likely to convey sunshine into what all writers agree is the
foggiest country in the world. It is, however, to be assumed, that
Hoei-shin and his predecessors went by sea--no impossible thing, at, a
time when in China both astronomy and navigation were sciences in a high
sense of the word. Deguignes, speaking of the winds and currents, as
Colonel Kennon does, says that the Chinese, in order to avoid the
shores, "took the wind from the north of Japan, and in the Sea of Jeso
sailed to the east; but at the Strait of Uriés the current bore them
rapidly to the north." Therefore they entered the Strait of Uriés,
beyond which they found many islands, which extend to the most northern
point of Kamtschatka,

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

and where also terminate the 5000 *li* between Jeso and Tahan. The
account of the different people inhabiting the North of Asia on the
route to America, as given by Deguignes from several old Chinese
historians, is far more detailed than that in Neumann. From this and
other circumstances, I infer that Professor Neumann, though he cites
Deguignes, had read his work with but little care. Deguignes apologises
for his long and detailed account of these tribes, their manner of life
and habits; but to the interested reader this will appear to be one of
the strongest links in the chain of evidence, since no one on perusing
it can doubt that the Chinese were perfectly familiar with the entire
northern country to the very edge of America, and had been so for many
generations. Deguignes does not appear to have reflected that the *naïf*
and manifestly truthful accounts of all these different tribes by old
historians strengthen his arguments, since he tells us that he has
omitted most of them. It is worth noting that he cites from
Ven-hien-tum-kao and Tam-chu that "the Chinese travellers who intended
to visit Tahan took their departure from a city north of the river
Hoam-ho, <span id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67.md) towards the country of the
Ortous <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68.md) Tartars. This town, then
called by the Chinese *Tchung-cheou-kiang-tching*, must be the one now
known as Piljo-tai-hotun." This mention of the route as that which was
usually followed indicates that there was in those days much travel in
that direction; and we find a reason for it when we

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

learn that at an earlier period the chain of islands from Asia to
America was incredibly rich in furs, and that at a time when furs were
in extraordinary demand in Europe and the East, a demand which lasted
until the fifteenth century. We are told, for instance, that the
principal charge brought against a Turkish sultan of that time, when his
subjects rose in rebellion, was that he had spent millions in purchasing
sables, this fur being supposed to be possessed of virtues as an
aphrodisiac. To secure this luxury any sum was given; and it is said
that, so far back as the fifth century, the Che-goei tribes, who lived
on the north banks of the Amur, were principally occupied in fishing and
in hunting sables. This fur-hunting extended over the Aleutian Islands,
which, as D’Eichthal remarks (Revue Archæologique, 1862, vol. ii. p.
197), were inhabited before their conquest by the Russians (1760-1790)
by a numerous and prosperous population. "As we leave the North," says
Maury (*Revue des Deux Mondes*, April 1868), "the facilities of crossing
by short voyages increase, and the natives seem to find more and more
attraction in them. With nothing but a leafy branch for a sail, the
boat-load, consisting generally of a man, his wife and children, dashes
out seawards as soon as a favourable wind blows, and proceeds at a fast
rate." The Russians have long had establishments on the islands of St
Paul and St George, whence they send vast quantities of furs; and
Colonel Kennon has frequently, while conversing with me, spoken of the
beautiful quality of many which he saw, but which be

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

was unable either to purchase or accept as a gift, owing to a special
request from the Russian Government that he would not take one away.
Whatever he needed for food or stores was supplied with great
generosity, but no furs could be touched. I have called special
attention to the furs of this region, since, as they were once much more
abundant there than at present, and that at a time when it was more the
fashion to wear them, we have a satisfactory reason to account for the
Chinese having at one time been familiar with the island route to
America, and for their having gradually abandoned it. I am not aware
that any special stress has been laid on this as evidence, but to my
mind it fully accounts for the tone of the old writers cited by
Deguignes, who appear to speak of going to America, not as if it were a
legendary exploit, which had once or twice been achieved in the early
dawn of history, but rather as a common incident.

Tam-chu states that it is fifteen days' travel from the Che-goei, or
sable-hunters of the Northern Amur to the east, where are found the
Yu-tche, a race derived from the Che-goei; and that a further journey of
fifteen days brought the traveller to Tahan. But, he adds, people also
reached Tahan by sea, sailing from Jeso. After careful examination,
Deguignes determined that the only country 20,000 *li* east of China, to
which the name and conditions of Fusang could possibly be applicable,
must be California or New Mexico.

"The Chinese historians add to the account of Hoei-shin

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

that of a Kingdom of Women, which is 1000 *li* farther east." It has
been ingeniously suggested by M. D'Eichthal, that as the term *women*
was formerly applied to entire tribes in North America, the monk may
have heard something of them. Thus the Delawares, having given up their
arms to the Six Nations, and become *protégés* of the latter, were
formally entitled women, and accepted the name at a grand congress of
the tribes. As for the absurdities connected with this legend of the
women, as given by Hoei-shin, it is sufficient to say that he uses the
term "it is said" in reference to the statement that the children of
this woman-realm appear matured at the age of three years. Had he
pretended to have visited the errantry, he would not have given as a
matter of hearsay what he must certainly have observed. And as he was
also told that these women suckled their babes from the backs of their
heads, Deguignes, with his usual sagacity, remarks, "It is easy to see
by this narrative that the women fed their children *par dessus leurs
épaules*--over their shoulders--as is done in many places in India." The
following, from the historians Nan-su and Ven-hien-tum-kao, is not
without interest, as showing that from an early age Chinese vessels were
driven by storms to America:--"In the year 607 (A.D.), under the dynasty
of Leam, a Chinese vessel sailing in these seas was blown by a tempest
on an unknown island. The women resembled those of China, but the men
had faces and voices like dogs. These people ate small

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

beans, wore dresses made of a kind of cloth, and the walls of their
houses were built of earth, raised in a circle. The Chinese could not
understand them." If we make allowance for the dogs' faces on the
well-known ground that the Chinese are particularly given to applying
the word *dog* to all people whom they regard as savages, it will be
found that the description applies with marvellous exactness to those
New Mexican Indians who held a middle place between such
highly-cultivated people as the Pueblos and the wilder and ruder tribes.
The resemblance of the women to those of China is a matter of common
remark; and one of my own earliest observations, as a boy, was the
extraordinary likeness of Afong-Moy, a Chinese woman who visited America
many years ago, to an ordinary squaw. This likeness is always, however,
more striking in half-breed Indian women, and in those of light
complexion, and the Pueblos are very much lighter than other
Indians. <span id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69.md) The enormous consumption of
beans (*frijoles*), the cloth (which was very beautifully made by the
Pueblo-Aztecs, from early ages), and especially the circular walls of
earth, all identify these Indiana with those of New Mexico. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70.md) These people, as well as the Indians of
Louisiana (Chevalier de Tonti,

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Voyage au Nord"),
had a curious habit of howling and roaring terribly to express respect
and admiration, and this may account for the voices like dogs spoken of
by the Chinese.

Deguignes has collected some curious instances from old writers which
seem to prove that Chinese merchants frequently found their way to
Western America. Thus George Horne <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71.md)
(l. 6, c. 5), relates that beyond the tribes which dwelt west of the
Hurons, there came in great vessels strangers who were beardless. Fr.
Vasquez de Coronado states that he found at Quivir vessels with gilded
poops; and Pedro Melendez, in Acosta, speaks of the wrecks of Chinese
vessels seen on the coast. "And it is beyond question that foreign
merchants, clothed in silk, formerly came among the Catacualcans." All
these reports intimate that the Chinese once traded in Northern
California, about the country of the Quivir. And there is, moreover,
ground for asserting that, at one time certainly, the most civilised
tribes in North America were those nearest China. It is generally
assumed that the intelligent and almost refined Pueblos of New Mexico
are the descendants of Aztecs who fled to the north after the Spanish
invasion; but the traditions of the Aztecs themselves declare that they
came from the north, and it is probable that the Pueblos have always
been where they are. Delaët (bk. vi. c. xvi. and xxii.) says that near
New Mexico were people who dwell in houses

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

several stories high, with halls, chambers, and stoves. They wore skins
and cotton cloths, but, what is unusual among savages, had leather shoes
and boots. Every district had its public criers, who announced the
king's orders, and idols and temples were everywhere. Baron de la Hontan
("Memoires sur l’Amerique") speaks of the Mirambecs, who inhabited
walled towns near a *great Salt Lake*. These people made cloths, copper
hatchets, and other wares.

Charlevoix ("histoire do la Nouvelle France") narrates two incidents,
which, though almost incredible, are at least worthy of consideration.
One of these is that Father Grellon, after acting as missionary for some
time in Canada, went to China, and thence to Tartary, where he met a
Huron woman whom he had formerly known in Eastern America. Another
Jesuit, returning from China, also declared that a Spanish woman,
originally of Florida, was found by him in Tartary, to which country she
had come by an extremely cold northern route.

It is said that the walrus and seal hunters of the mouth of the river
Kocoima, in Siberia, are often carried out to sea on vast floating
fields of ice, and occasionally drift to the opposite American shore,
which is not far distant. Most of my readers will recall the wonderful
preservation of the crew of the *Polaris*, which, with women and
children, drifted for many months on an ice-cake. Indeed, many wild
animals, also like men engaged in hunting, may in this way

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

have been transported from one continent to the other.

These are substantially the points advanced by Deguignes, <span
id="fr_72"></span>[1](#fn_72.md) an excellent Chinese scholar, and a
.careful writer. It was while making researches for a history of the
Mongols that he found in the works of old Chinese historians the
materials for his theory that America was peopled from the North-west.
In 1831 Julius Heinrich von Klaproth, a distinguished scholar, attacked
Deguignes in a work entitled "Recherches sur le Pays de Fou-sang
mentionné dans les Livres Chinois, et pris mal à, propos pour une partie
de l’Amérique" ("Nouvelles Annales des Voyages," t. xxi. de la deuxième
série, 1831). By this work, according to Gustave d’Eichthal, Klaproth
did much harm. There was an authority attached to his name which made it
easy for lain, to render ridiculous the ideas advanced by Deguignes.
There is a popular tendency--especially in France--to ridicule
everything Chinese; and in England the mere idea of Chinese metaphysics
awakens a smile in the readers of Dickens, though scholars know that
Chinese Buddhists may be fairly said to have exhausted every refinement
of thought known to à priori or pantheistic methods. In
[ninety-nine](errata.htm#2.md) cases out of a hundred, the sneering critic
who negatives has it all his own way with the public for a time, and for
more than the present time he does not care. The

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

refutation of Klaproth now appears worthless; he produces nothing new,
and attacks Deguignes entirely "out of himself." He begins with a
plausible quibble, by accusing Deguignes of being false to his title.
"In the Chinese original," says Klaproth, "which Deguignes had before
his eyes, there is nothing said of the navigation undertaken by the
Chinese to the land of Fusang; but, as may be seen further on, it turns
upon a notice of Fusang as given by a Buddhist priest who had been
there." Klaproth says "a native of the country," and by the country he
means Fusang. But in a German version of the same passage, given by
Neumann in a more recent work ("Ost-Asien and West-America, Zeitschrift
für allgemeine Erdkunde,'' April 1864), the (or this) country refers to
China. Now Deguignes really wrote, according to his title, on the
navigation or voyages of Chinese to America, and he says very little of
the record of Hoei-shin, beyond quoting it. Deguignes tells us nothing
of a Chinese original in his title, he only adduces the narrative as
confirming his other researches; and Klaproth appears fully convicted of
a shrewd, unscrupulous trick, such as a petty Bohemian might have
recourse to in some notorious journal, whose ideal of criticism is to
make a writer appear personally ridiculous. After this he makes a
vigorous attack on Deguignes' estimate of the length of the Chinese *li*
in the fifth century, which ends in nothing, since he thinks that the
Chinese of that time had no means of estimating distances at

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

sea. The remark is that of a man accustomed to believe that distances
cannot be measured at sea without all the appliances and training of
modern science, while the truth is, every captain of a Yankee coaster
knows that it can be done--not very accurately, it is true, but
approximatively or tolerably well--with the simplest instruments, such
as any sailor can make. But as D’Eichthal observes, the 20,000 *li* from
Tahan to Fusang are probably merely arbitrary. The travellers found
that, going at the same average rate, it took them more than twice as
long to get from Tahan to Fusang as from Leao-tong (north of Pekin) to
Tahan. The obvious and natural way to measure Hoei-shin's 20,000 *li*
from Tahan to Fusang is by the *li* assigned to the preceding distances,
and according to this standard the estimate is accurate enough.

"The two agree in placing Wen-schin in the island of Jeso, situated 7000
*li* from the point of departure on the coast of Nippon. There, in fact,
is the country of the Wen-slain or Tattooed People. The Ainos, who then
occupied the northern part of Japan, or the island of Jeso, are still
accustomed to paint their bodies and faces with different figures. But
here," continues D’Eichthal, ''all agreement between the two writers
ceases. Deguignes thinks that Tahan, which is, according to the Chinese
account, 5000 *li* from Jeso, must be Kamtschatka. In this conclusion he
has against him, it is true, the important sum-total of the distance;
but on the other hand there are many arguments in his

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

favour, which we shall proceed to examine. Klaproth holds, however, that
Tahan is simply the island of Krafto or Taraï-kaï, the southern point of
which is found, according to his calculation, exactly 5000 *li* from the
northern point of Niphon. To arrive at this conclusion, as the distance
is only six degrees, Klaproth is compelled to adopt the measurement of
850 *li* to a degree, which he had just before rejected." He had said
that the distance between the West Coast of Corea, and the middle of
Niphon is, according to Deguignes, too great. "It would suppose for the
*li* a length of 850 to the degree, whereas, at the highest, it cannot
be more than 400."

"But to continue. If the island of Taraï-kaï is Tahan, we cannot find
Fusang 20,000 *li* to the east, for the nearest land in this direction
is 90° distant. 'By taking the story literally,' says Klaproth, 'and by
seeking Fusang east of Tahan, we fall into the Pacific Ocean.'" But as
Fusang must be found somewhere, and as it was a foregone conclusion with
Klaproth that it must not be found in America, he assumes that, having
arrived at the southern point of Taraï-kai, one should sail first to the
east in order to pass the Strait of La Pérouse, coasting along the
northern shore of Jeso, but that, having arrived at the north-east point
of the same island, he would sail to the south, and thus arrive at some
part of the South-east Coast of Japan, where Fusang would be found.

It will probably occur to the reader that this would

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

be taking i deal of pains to destroy an adversary's argument, and
weaving a very tangled web. Yet as the last word always has weight, this
argument of Klaproth held its own for many years, and still holds it
with many people. It is true, as D’Eichthal remarks, that by proceeding
in this style Klaproth put himself, in the most arbitrary manner, in
direct opposition to the very letter of his text, which says nothing at
all about sailing up and down and coasting around islands. "But this is
not the only objection which can be urged against him. In the first
place, nobody in Japan ever heard of Fusang. The details given with
regard to it do not suit Japan in the least. One circumstance is
decisive. Not only does the narrator put Fusang 20,000 *li* east of
Tahan, but he speaks of a country of women 1000 *li* from Fusang. But
1000 *li* to the east of Japan must be in the sea." It is to be
regretted that Klaproth asserts that Fusang is an ancient name of Japan,
but without citing any authority on which to support such a serious and
very material statement. Iris arguments have been answered not only by
D’Eichthal, but by Sr. José Perez, in an article in the *Révue Orientale
et Américaine*, No. 4, pp. 189-195. For a Chinese, even in the sixth
century, to place in Japan such a marvellous country as Fusang was
popularly supposed to be, would have been quite as absurd as if a French
traveller of the fourteenth century had assured the world that he had
found in England an immense region inhabited by giants. For popular
belief very soon clothed Fusang

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

with incredible marvels, as we shall see anon; and Klaproth supposes
this possible of a country which was at the time constantly exchanging
embassies with China, and conveying to the latter, as the reader may
recall from Neumann's work, detailed accounts of all its provinces, and
of their inhabitants. As Klaproth admits, Fusang soon became a
fairy-land, which Chinese poets loved to adorn with the fantastic and
marvellous. "The authors of Chan-haï-king, of the Li-sao, Hoai-nan-tsu,
Li-pe-tai, and others, have found in it an inexhaustible resource.
According to them, the sun rises in the valley of Yang-kon and makes his
toilet in Fu-sang, where there are mulberry-trees many thousand rods
high. The natives eat the fruit, which makes their bodies shine like
gold, and confers on them the ability to fly. "Such fables are not
placed in a neighbouring country. They require for plausibility great
distance, and entirely strange circumstances."

Again, the narrative declares that Buddhism was introduced into Fusang
A.D. 458, but it did not find its way into Japan, officially at least,
until 552. How then could Fusang, admitting that it existed, have been a
part of Japan?

"But to throw full light on the question," says D’Eichthal, "we should
study the second itinerary, that by land from China to Tahan, given by
Deguignes and Klaproth. We shall now do so; and if accused of delaying
too long over these documents, we reply that in them we find, as
Deguignes and Klaproth himself had clearly

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

seen, a leading element in the question, and a decisive argument from
the geographical point of view for the existence or non-existence of
ancient communications between Asia and America.

"The traveller by land from China to Tahan went from the upper course of
the Hoang-hoin, in the north of China, passed through the country of the
Ordos or Ho-tas, traversed the desert of Cobi, and arrived at the
principal camp of the Hoeï-khé Turks, on the left bank of the Orchon,
not far from its source, where Karakorum was afterwards placed. Thence
he journeyed to Lake Baïkal, crossed the country of Ko-li-han, the
ancient home of the Kirkis or Khirghiz, and turning to the east, came to
the Chy-weï. The most southern of these lived near the river Onon,
flowing from the right of the Upper Amoor (Amur). By travelling fifteen
days to the east, or in the direction of the Amoor, were found the
Chy-weï Youtché, probably the same people whom other Chinese authors
call Youtchy, that is to say, the Djourdje, the ancestors of the present
Mongols. From this point, finally, ten days' journey to the north
brought the traveller to Tahan surrounded ou three sides by the sea, and
also called Lieu-koueï. <span id="fr_73"></span>[1](#fn_73.md)

"We should have under our eyes the work of Deguignes, to realise with
what care he has discussed every part of this journey. Then, having
reached the final paint, he reasonably remarks, that as one travels by

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

land all the way to arrive at Tahan, it cannot be an island, yet that it
must be a maritime country according to the first route, since they also
went thither by sea; and basing his statement on the two views, he
places the *point de recontre* of the two itineraries in Kamtschatka."

"The southern part of Kamtschatka, or Tahan," says Deguignes, "was known
to the Chinese under the name of Lieou-koueï. Of old, the Tartars who
lived near the river Amoor reached it after fifteen days' sailing to the
north (Deguignes traces this navigation on his map). Chinese historians
relate that this country is surrounded by the sea an three sides. In the
year 640 (A.D.), the King of Lieou-koueï sent his son to China. <span
id="fr_74"></span>[1](#fn_74.md) According to the most accurate
descriptions which the Russians have given of it, this country is a
tongue of land extending from north to south, from Cape Sultoïnoss to
the north of Jeso, with which many writers have confounded it. It is
partly separated from the rest of Siberia by a gulf of the Eastern Sea,
which passes from south to north. Towards the northern extremity

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

it is inhabited by very ferocious people. Those who live towards the
south are more civilised. It is very likely that their commerce with the
Japanese and Chinese merchants who traded on their shores has
contributed to make them milder and more sociable than those of the
north, among whom these two more refined races rarely come" (p. 511).

It is only after discussing the two routes, and settling the common
point or limit as we have seen, that Deguignes undertakes to determine
the position of the country of Fusang. "This long detail," he declares,
"was necessary for an exact knowledge of the situation of the country.
The Chinese narrative informs us that Fusang is 20,000 *li* distant from
Tahan or Kamtschatka. Thus, by leaving a port in the latter country,
such as Kamtschatka, and sailing *east* for 20,000 *li*, the voyage ends
on the most western shore of America, or about the place where the
Russians landed in 1741. In all this immense extent of ocean there is no
land nor island to which the distance of 20,000 *li* applies. Nor can
we, on the other hand, suppose that the Chinese followed the coast of
Asia, and, touching its most eastern extremity, there placed the land of
Fusang. The excessive cold which prevails in the north of Kamtschatka,
renders this supposition untenable." <span id="fr_75"></span>[1](#fn_75.md)

"When Deguignes wrote," adds D’Eichthal, "the

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

solution which he proposed was not, however, so simple or evident as it
may appear to us to-day. At that time the geography of the North Pacific
was just beginning to be cleared of the darkness in which it had been so
long enveloped. Behring had discovered, in 1728, the strait which bears
his name; he had found, in 1741, some of the Aleutian Isles, the
promontory of Aliaska, and the northern extremity of the American side;
but he had not been able to make exact surveys. Deguignes, at least, did
not possess them; and to prepare the singular map, designed by Philip
Buache, which accompanies his memoir, the illustrious academician had
recourse to a Japanese chart.

"Since M. De l’Isle," he says, "published a map of this part of the
world, we have obtained from Russia information which, without giving
with accuracy the contour of the American coasts, teaches us generally
that the coast of California runs towards the west, and approaches
considerably that of Asia, leaving between the continents a narrow
strait, agreeing with the shape which the first geographers gave to
America, probably from more exact knowledge than we suppose, and which
is now lost." Thus the map of Asia, published by Sanson in 1650, gives,
between Asia and America, near the place of Behring's Straits, the
Strait of Ainan, as it was then called. This strait disappeared on
Guillaume de l’Isle's map of 1723, but reappeared in the same map
re-edited in 1745, and again in 1762, corrected by new documents. This
information was confirmed

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

by Japanese charts, especially by one which Mr Hans Sloane, President of
the Royal Society of London, had communicated to him, and which he
placed before his paper in the "Memoires de l’Académie des Inscriptions
et Belles-Lettres." "It agrees on the whole," he declares, "with our old
maps of America, and with the Russian discoveries." "On this map, about
the part discovered by the Russians, America seems to advance
considerably, and form a tongue of land which extends to Asia (the
promontory of Aliaska). *In this case it is intelligible that the
Chinese found it much easier to reach Fusang, since they thus had a
coast to follow almost all the way*."

"It was," says M. D’Eichthal very truly, "with a kind of prophetic
instinct, or, if you will, with extreme shrewdness and sense, that
Deguignes traced, on the map made by him, the route which was probably
followed by those whom he calls *navigateurs chinois* to get to America.
The details are naturally very imperfect, and Behring's Island is the
only one given of the Aleutians. On the other hand, the promontory of
Aliaska is out of all proportion too great, both in length and breadth.
There is an entire absence of all astronomical verification;
nevertheless, the general 'lay of the land' is correct, as recent
discoveries have confirmed. We have under our eyes three very important
documents, 'Les Renseignements Statistiques et Ethnographiques sur les
Possessions Russes à la côté Nord-ouest de l’Amérique, by Rear-Admiral
Wrangel ('Statistical and Ethnographical

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Communications as
to the Russian Possessions on the North-west Coast of America); <span
id="fr_76"></span>[1](#fn_76.md) an analysis of the work of Father
Wenjaminow on 'Les Isles (Aléoutiennes) du District du Unalaska,' by F.
Löwe (from the periodical *Archiv für die wissenschaftliche Kunde von
Russland*, 1842, 8th Part); and the critique of a memoir by Maury, ou
the facilities of passing from the North-east Coast of Asia to the
North-west Coast of America (*Revue des Deux Mondes*, April 1858). All
of these works agree in demonstrating time ease of this communication,
and that of settling on the North-west Coast of America. The climate of
all this region, even at the 60th degree of latitude is, for its
elevation, very mild. The chain of the Aleutian Isles and the promontory
of Aliaska form, as it were, a barrier which exclude Polar influences.
On the other hand, the great warm current of the Pacific Ocean, observed
by modern navigators, <span id="fr_77"></span>[2](#fn_77.md) contributes to
raise the temperature. Observations, carefully collected, have shown
that at Sitka the average temperature is 7°.39 Centigrade, or 50.91
Reaumur, with, it is true, slight differences between summer and winter:
even in winter the sea is never closed. In a word, according to the
unanimous testimony of navigators, there is not on the face of the

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

globe such a change of climate as is experienced in passing from
Behring's Straits to the Pacific Ocean."

All that has been said of the extreme facility with which the natives of
the North Pacific pass from Asia to America has, however, according to
M. D’Eichthal, nothing to do with the question of Chinese or Japanese
navigation between the continents; and therefore, he thinks that here
Deguignes erred, and said too much, when he entitled his memoir "Des
Navigations des Chinois du côté de l’Amérique." It seems to me that this
is stretching courtesy to Klaproth to affectation. Deguignes believed,
from several sources, that Chinese, merchants as well as missionaries,
had found their way to California. On this hypothesis he wrote his book,
and demonstrated the route which they must have followed, and therefore
he had a full right to say that its subject was ou the "navigations" of
the Chinese from the American coast. He could not, unfortunately, give
the log-books and diaries of the skippers who took Hoei-shin and his
predecessors across; though, if he had, Klaproths would not have been
wanting to impugn their authenticity.

It will be remembered that Deguignes lays stress on the high culture of
the early dwellers in New Mexico. So far as the limited information of
his time extended, he found in that country the point of departure and
the first theatre of American civilisation, and he believed, according
to D’Acosta, that, instead of the inhabitants of this region having been
refugees from Mexico, they are

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

the remains of a primitive civilisation from which the Mexicans drew
their culture ere they wandered south. D’Eichthal appeals to ancient
works not known to Deguignes, and also to the most recent, as verifying
this theory. These are the "Narrative of the Journey of Cibola in 1540,"
by Castañeda de Nagera, Paris, 1838, given in the collection of
"Voyages, Relations, et Mémoires Originaux, pour servir à l’Histoire de
la Découverte de l’Amérique, par Ternaux Compans;" the "Reports of
Explorations and Surveys to ascertain the most practicable and
economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River, made under
the direction of the Secretary of War in 1853-54," especially in vol.
iii.; "Report on the Indian Tribes," by Lieutenant A. W. Whipple, Thomas
Ewbank, Esq., and Prof. W. W. Turner; and also the "Personal Narrative
of Explorations, &c.," by John Russell Bartlett, New York, 1854. In
these works may be found, not only indubitable proof of the former
highly-advanced civilisation of New Mexico, but remarkable indications
of apparent affinity with Chinese culture. Deguignes was in the right
when he suggested that the oxen seen by Hoei-shin were probably bison.
We might add the statement, that in Fusang stags were raised as cattle
are in China, and that cheese was made from hind's milk, "as appears
from Popol-Vuh, the Sacred Book of the Quichés," by M. l’Abbé Brasseur
de Bourbourg <span id="fr_78"></span>[1](#fn_78.md) (Introduction,

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

p\. 40). He was also strictly right in asserting that the vine was known
there, and that iron was not, but that copper was used, and that gold
and silver (owing, doubtless, to their abundance) were of no value. All
these facts were strictly applicable to Mexico, and they were not
collectively applicable to any country then known to the Chinese. Of his
own knowledge Hoei-shin relates no marvels; what he tells us of the
existence of a white race is fully confirmed by tradition and the traces
still existing of such people. Lieutenant Whipple says there are white
Indians at Zuni, the principality of the old kingdom of Cibola, although
they are exception They have, he says, light or auburn hair. The first
Indian seen by Father Niça, in 1539, is described as a man of light
complexion. Indians of this type have since existed. And Catlin remarks
that, on seeing the Mandans, one is tempted to exclaim, "These are no
Indians." There are numbers of them whose colour is as light as that of
half-breeds, and among the women "are many who are almost white, and who
have grey eyes, or blue and hazel" (Catlin, "Letters and Notes on the
Manners, Customs, and Conditions of the North American Indians," fourth
edition, London, 1844, vol. i. p. 93). And as some uncertainty may exist
as to the relative colour of a half-breed, I would explain that it is
often not darker than that of a Chinese, and is much clearer, the cheeks
being generally rosy. I have seen the whole of Catlin's portraits of
Mandans, and, like all Americans

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

who have been in the West, am familiar with Indians, both of full and
mixed blood, and am quite sure that such an expert as General Whipple,
whom I have known personally very well, never mistook a half-breed for a
real Indian. The extraordinary lightness of the Mandan women is a
phenomenon which can only be accounted for by their belonging to an
entirely different stock from the other tribes. The men had very long
hair; braves who were 6 feet 2 inches high had it trailing for two or
three inches on the ground.

All these facts agree very well with the assertions of Hoei-shin, and M.
D’Eichthal, with great sagacity, points out that even the two prisons,
situated one in the north, the other in the south; the one for great
criminals destined to endure lifelong punishment, the other for trivial
offenders, coincide with the ideas as to future punishment held by some
Indian tribes, and especially by the Mandans. Catlin tells us (vol. i.
p. 157) that these people believed that their hell, which, like that of
the Norsemen, was a cold one, desolate and horrible, covered with
eternal ice, was situated far to the north, while the happy
hunting-grounds, or their paradise, lay in the south.

We may, perhaps, even dispense with supposing that the oxen seen by
Hoei-shin were bison, if we admit that domestic cattle may have existed
in America, and been exterminated. Thus, in the "Rélation de Choses de
Yucatan de Diégo de Landa," the author tells us that an Indian chief
named Cocom showed him one

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

day an ancient book containing the picture of a common European cow, and
told him it had been prophesied that when such beasts should come into
the country, the worship of the gods would cease--"Cessario el culto de
los Dioses, y que se avia cumplido, porque los españoles truxeron varas
grandes." It is true that this may have been a mere trick of the Indian
to flatter the Spaniard.

D’Eichthal has vindicated Deguignes as regards the statement that hinds
(*biches*) were domesticated in Fusang, and that cheese was made from
their milk, by citing from the "Popol-Vuh" (Introduction, p. xl.)--"Milk
was known to the Mexicans, who were accustomed to milk bison-cows and
tame hinds, and make cheese." The statement appears to 'have been taken
from Castañeda.

"The analysis which we have made of the work of Deguignes," says
D’Eichthal, "shows how he availed himself of the different geographical
and historical documents consulted by him, especially the Chinese
narrative of Fusang. There is, however, in this relation a point which
has escaped him; he did not, and in fact could not, understand who or
what those priests were who, in the 458th year of our era, carried their
doctrines to the country of Fusang; nor did that other priest, who,
forty years later, wrote of that country." "Formerly," says Deguignes,
"these nations had no knowledge of the religion of Fo. In the year 458
A.C., under the dynasty of *Sum* (Sung), five bonzes

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

of Samarcand carried their doctrines into this country: then the manners
changed" (p. 523).

For Deguignes, as for all men of his time, the religion of Fo was simply
one of the national religions of China. Its identity with Buddhism was,
I believe, not even suspected. But how could those pretended Chinese
bonzes have come from Samarcand? Deguignes, it appears, did not even ask
himself this question.

In the time of Klaproth, ideas were more advanced. The identity of the
religion of Fo and Buddhism was now acknowledged; and the passage in
question is much better translated--"Formerly the religion of Buddha did
not exist in those countries. It was in the fourth year, *la-ming*, of
the reign of Hiao-wou-te, of Souang (458 A.C.), that five *pi-khieou*,
or priests of the country of Ki-pin (the ancient Kophen), went to
Fusang, and there spread the law of Buddha. They took with them books,
holy images, ritual observances, and established habits of monasticism
which altered the manners of the inhabitants."

The land of Ki-pin, the ancient Kophen, is now called Bokhara, the
country of Samarcand. Samarcand, indeed, at the time of which we are
speaking, was one of the great strongholds of Buddhism. It was in the
centre of Asia, one part of it touching Persia, another Turkestan--at
the opening of all the roads which led from that central point to the
northern frontier of China, and to the north-east of Asia and the shores
of the Pacific. If Klaproth had admitted that

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Fusang was in
America, he would have found in this indication an excellent
setting-out-point for studying the institutions and monuments of
America, and their relations with Asia. He could the more easily have
done so, because at that time the journey of Humboldt to New Spain, and
also the "Views of the Cordilleras and Andes," had already appeared, and
in those works numerous affinities between the various civilisations of
America and Eastern Asia were plainly shown. But by his determination to
place Fusang on the South-east Coast of Japan, Klaproth not only lost
the benefit of the revelations on the subject of Buddhism furnished by
the Chinese document, but also found it a stumbling-block. As we have
already remarked, he was led to fix the introduction of Buddhism into a
Japanese province in the year 458 of our era, whereas be knew and owned
that the establishment of Buddhism in Japan did not take place until the
year 582. Besides, we must remember that in Klaproth's time the history
of Buddhism, though clear, was still very incomplete. The great works of
Hodgson, of Turner, of Burnouf, and those which are derived from them,
had not yet appeared. That which Deguignes could not even imagine, that
which even Klaproth could have accomplished but imperfectly, is now
easy. "By summing up all that we now know of the internal development
and the distant propagation of Buddhism, we can well understand what may
have been the result of its teaching in America, and can judge, from
this point of view,

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

the institutions and monuments of ancient American civilisation."

Such is, in brief, the substance of M. D’Eichthal's vindication of
Deguignes against the attack of' Klaproth, though it would be but just
to say that he has added to it a mass of valuable information which
should be read by all who take an interest in the subject. Let me, in
conclusion, add a word in sincere praise of the very moderate tone of
his defence. Those who have read the bitter accusations which other
writers have, in a spirit of honest indignation, hurled against
Klaproth, will understand and fully agree with me.
