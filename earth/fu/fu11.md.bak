### CHAPTER VIII.

### REMARKS ON COLONEL KENNON'S LETTER.

THE letter from Colonel Kennon, and more particularly the argument for
the settlement of Oceanica from Japan, are links in the chain of
circumstantial evidence, showing that in all probability the inhabitants
of Eastern Asia once passed to Western America. I myself have seen
Sandwich Islanders of the best class, well-educated--occupying, in fact,
the position of ladies and gentlemen--who were not to be distinguished
by me from the same class of Japanese, only that the Sandwich Islanders
seemed to be rather the better-looking. Some of the Pacific islands are
even now uninhabited, which renders it the more probable that those
which are not derived their population from the country which lies, as
Colonel Kennon remarks, "to the windward." Taking everything therefore
into consideration, the scientific character of early Chinese and
Japanese navigation, the crowded state of the empires, which, despite
stringent laws, continually compelled thousands to either live on the
water, or seek a living by voyaging; the islands thousands of miles away
which were probably

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

peopled by them, and the great ease with which the journey by the
Aleutian Islands could be accomplished, we have a chain of inductions
which require only the least fact to establish the whole as truth. This
fact is *probably* to be found in the record of the journey of
Hoei-shin. All that now remains is the hope that, if curiosity and
inquiry should be stimulated by the publication of what is here given,
further research may be made in China, or in its ancient records, for
clearer evidence. I have heard it said that it is commonly related by
the Chinese in California that their ancestors had preceded them by many
centuries in that country, which tradition was once recorded in a San
Francisco newspaper. This may have originated in some obscure version of
the old story of Hoei-shin, but then it is not impossible that there are
sources of information extant on this subject which were never known to
Europeans.

As regards the discovery of America by the Norse-men, while there is
apparently good direct evidence to establish what is now (popularly, at
least) regarded as a fact, the chain of general and presumptive evidence
is not so sarong as that which indicates the probable transit of Chinese
or Japanese to Aliaska. It is true the Icelanders were dauntless seamen
and reckless adventurers, and that the passage to Greenland presented no
great difficulty to them. But all these conditions existed equally as
regards seamanship, and to a much higher degree as to the ease of the
journey,

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

for Japanese or their neighbours. Scandinavia and Iceland were never at
any time more than thinly populated; but the teeming millions of Eastern
Asia have in all ages been proverbial. It is. certainly true that one
fact is worth all the presumptive evidence which can be imagined; and it
is equally true that the least fact is entitled to peculiar
consideration and respect when heralded and supported on every side by
probabilities.

There is a class of very unscientific writers on many subjects, but
especially on Ethnology, who affect a negative method in everything, and
ridicule every new thing as belonging rather to the realm of fairy tales
than to science. With these writers nothing was ever derived from a
strange source, or could have come from anything of which they were
ignorant. This tendency is not inspired by truth, but by that timidity
rather than prudence which dreads failure or ridicule, and contents
itself with theorising and arranging in the track of bolder minds and
true discoverers. Opposition to or belief in what they regard as
"religion," has also mach to do with this spirit of denial, since many,
and indeed far too many writers, are guided in every department of
science by a desire to prove or disprove Christianity, rather than to
find out what is true. To then all the extraordinary coincidences of
serpent-worship, monolithic groups, cups, winged globes, or crosses in
monuments, are merely phenomena of an accidental nature, and the most
natural things in the world, such as must have occurred to

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

everybody. In philology they are identical with that very large class of
unthinking and generally uneducated people who deem it useless to seek
for the origin of cant words or popular phrases, so convinced are they
that such "catches" come spontaneously to people's lips. "Everybody uses
them, so they must have come of themselves to everybody," said a man of
this class once to me. "A man can't help saying them." Now, as much
research in this field has convinced me that every popular saying has a
*decided* origin, popular belief to the contrary, it seems most probable
that such very positive matters as religions and myths, which are
difficult to learn, are, with the customs which they involve, more
generally transmitted, however remotely, than easily invented. A snake
is a singular object, and its motion on the ground is very much like the
winding course of a great river, and the island or islands so generally
found in the delta of a river naturally suggest something held in the
mouth of the snake; and yet I do not think that the idea of a serpent
with a ball at its mouth is so very palpable a religions symbol, and one
so innate, that it should be the very first thing which would occur as
an emblem of the great deity of the waters, to aboriginal Egyptians, to
monolith-setters in Brittany, to mound-builders in Ohio, to Peruvians
and Mexicans. In fact, I deem it not altogether impossible that this
poetical collocation of the serpent as a type of a river, and the ball,
simple and self-suggesting as it is, has never occurred to many of my
readers. It would

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

be preposterous to deny what Sir John Lubbock has all but proved in "The
Origin of Civilisation," that many methods of worship have occurred
independently and spontaneously to savage races widely remote one from
the other. Yet, ou the other hand, few impartial investigators will deny
that *transmission* has also been a wonderful element in what Germans
call *culture*.

If Buddhist priests were really the first men who, within the scope of
written history and authentic annals, went from the Old World to the
New, the fact is of great value in itself, and one which must doubtless
lead the way to much important knowledge as to all the early settlement
or culture of Old America. And if it be a fact, it will sooner or later
be proved. Nothing can escape History that belongs to it. Within a
generation Egypt and Assyria have yielded the greatest secrets of their
language and life to patient inquiry; every week at present sees the
most wonderful conquests, from the dreamy realm of myth and fable to
that of material record and fact. I do not know how or when it will be,
but I am persuaded that ancient America will in time yield her Moabite
stones and Rosetta slabs to the patient inquirer. The records of Mexico
were carefully destroyed by wicked bigots, who, not satisfied with
exterminating a flourishing and happy nation, sought to commit a double
murder by killing its past life. But it will be found again; for science
will yet achieve that, and more.
