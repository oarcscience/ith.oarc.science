#### CHAPTER XIV.

#### T. SIMSON AND DR E. BRETSCHNEIDER; OR EUROPEANS RESIDING IN CHINA ON FUSANG.

IN the "Notes and Queries on China and Japan," published at Hong Kong,
there appeared in No. 4, April 1869, this communication:--

#### "BUDDHIST PRIESTS IN AMERICA.

"I see the following statement in a recent home paper:--

"Professor Carl Neumann, of Munich, a diligent student of Chinese
antiquities and bibliography, has discovered from the Chinese Year-Books
that a company of Buddhist priests entered this vast continent, *via*
Aliaska, a thousand years before Columbus, and explored thoroughly and
intelligently the Pacific borders, penetrating into the land of
Fusang--for so they called the Aztec territory, after the Chinese name
of the Mexican aloe.

"Perhaps some of your numerous contributors may be able to verify the
learned sinologue's discovery, and for that purpose I beg to submit it
to further inquiry. Y. J. A.

"SHANGHAI, *March* 24, 1S69."

In consequence of this request by Y. J. A., there appeared in the next
number of the "Notes and Queries for China and Japan" the following
letter:--

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

"BUDDHIST PRIESTS IN AMERICA (vol. iii. p. 58).--Under this heading, a
querist in the last number of *Notes and Queries* submits to inquiry a
statement of Professor Carl Neumann of Munich, respecting the supposed
entry of Buddhist priests into the American Continent some thirteen
hundred years ago, and their passage into the land of the Aztecs, which
they called Fusang, 'after the Chinese name of the American aloe.'

"Now, in the first place, this statement, if true, inferentially proves
much more than it asserts; the Mexican aloe is a native of Mexico only,
and it is manifest, therefore, that if these supposed Chinese travellers
named the country after the Chinese name of the Mexican aloe, that plant
must have been well known to them before the period of their visit to
its native country; hence we are carried further back, to a time when
the Mexican aloe must have been known in China, and we must allow a
considerable period for it to have become so well known as to suggest to
the travellers a name for a newly-discovered--or, as it must needs have
been in this view, a rediscovered country. This consideration takes us
back into the question of the original peopling of the American
Continent, to the age of stone or bronze, perhaps, which is beyond the
intended scope of the querist's quotation.

"At the period when 'the land of Fusang is first mentioned by
historians,' China, exclusive of the neighbouring 'barbarous tribes,'
over whom she held sway, was not so extensive as she is at present, but
comprised only what we should now call the Northern and Central
Provinces. Does the Mexican aloe grow in that part of the country at
all? I am inclined to think not, though I cannot speak positively upon
the point. In Canton it is said by the Chinese to have been introduced
from the Philippine Islands, and is called Spanish (or Philippine) hemp,
its fibres being sometimes employed in the manufacture of mosquito nets.

"But the Fusang (or, more correctly, the Fusang <span
id="img_16200"></span> ![](img/16200.jpg) tree), as described in Chinese
botanical works appears to be a malvaceous plant; at any rate, whatever
it may be, it certainly is *not* the Mexican aloe, or and thing similar
to it.

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

"The land of Fusang is described by Chinese authors as being in the
Eastern Sea, in the place where the sun rises. Considering the
geographical limits of China at the time referred to (some 1300 years
ago), surely we need not look further than Japan for a very probable
identification of the Fusang country according with this description,
which indeed appears to be embodied in the more modern name
Jih-pên-kwoh, Japan, which is translatable as the 'Country of the Rising
Sun.' It is a matter of fact, too, that Buddhism was introduced into
that country some 1300 years ago; and this by no means extraordinary
event is a very much more probable version of the incident referred to
than the marvellous story given by Professor Neumann.

"CANTON.

THEOS. SIMSON."

The note of Y. J. A., of March 24, 1869, refers rather vaguely to a
statement in "home papers," by which I infer that American journals are
to be understood. In 1850 I published in the New York *Knickerbocker
Magazine*, for the first time, my version of Professor Neumann's little
work; and in 1862 republished in the *Continental Magazine* (N.Y.),
which I then edited, the greater portion of it, with additions of my
own. It is probable that the paragraph from the "home paper" cited by Y.
J. A. originated in an erroneous inference drawn from a hasty perusal of
one of these articles. It is therefore needless to comment on Mr
Simson's ignorance of the work which he attacked. His inference that the
giving a name to the maguey by the Buddhist monks infers a long previous
acquaintance with the plant, indicates a very slight knowledge of the
manner in which names are generally given by newcomers

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

to a strange country, as Professor Neumann has indeed intimated. In
North America the number of names thus applied, or misapplied, is
incredibly large. For an instance nearer home, we may take our own
English gipsies, who call a dog a jackal (*juckal*), a swan by the
Persian word for a pelican (*sákka* or *sákku*), and small grain by the
Hindu word for rice (*shali-giv*, Hindu *shalita*). Hoei-shin did as the
Americans and gipsies have done; having no word for a natural product
which was new to him, he heedlessly gave to it the name of a familiar
plant which he fancied resembled it. The fact that the plant known to
Chinese botanists as the Fusang is malvaceous, and unlike the maguey,
conflicts in nothing with the probability that Hoei-shin saw the great
American aloe. What the fancied point of resemblance may have been, or
what kind of a Chinese Fusang-plant he had in his mind, is of
comparatively slight importance. The main point, and the one steadily
ignored by all who have opposed the views of Deguignes and Neumann, is
this: did not Hoei-shin see in the land of Fusang, and afterwards
describe--no matter by what name--a remarkable plant, which is to-day
the characteristic plant of the region which he is supposed to have
visited. The geographical questions raised by Mr Simson, and the
possible identity of Japan with Fusang, have been too carefully
considered by M. D’Eichthal to render a further discussion of them
necessary.

As for the possible antiquity of the name Fusang,

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

as applied to the maguey, taking us "back into the age of stone or
bronze perhaps, which is beyond the intended scope of the querist's
quotation," it should be remarked that the ages of both stone and bronze
existed contemporaneously for many centuries on the North American
Continent until it was settled by Europeans; and further, that the age
of stone continues to exist among a few tribes, as I have acquaintances
who not many years ago witnessed the process of making flint arrow-heads
among the Indians of Oregon. I can remember having, when a boy,
occasionally seen, among sheaves of arrows bought from the Indians of
the plains, a few which were flint-tipped, though these were rare, most
of them appearing to have heads made from iron hoops. It is therefore
evident, that by transferring the period when the name Fusang was given
to the "age of stone or bronze" by no means removes the intended scope
of the querist's quotation into an era so remote and obscure as to defy
research.

The discussion of the question on its native soil, and in its
fatherland, China, did not, however, end here. In the fifth number of
the *Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal*, vol. iii., published at
Foochow, October 1870, there appeared an article entitled "Fusang; or,
Who Discovered America?" by "E. Bretschneider, Esq., M. D." It was as
follows:

"In the May number of the *Chinese Recorder* there is an article
reproduced from the *Gentleman's Magazine*, in which it is sought to be
proved that the Chinese had discovered America

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

as early as 500 A.D. Simultaneous with this there appears in *Notes and
Queries* (vol. iv. p. 19) a short notice on the same subject, in which
it is desired to collect and publish all notices concerning Fusang, by
which name the Chinese of that time are said to have called the
newly-discovered America.

"This supposed discovery of America by Buddhist priests has already been
the subject of remarks in *Notes and Queries* (vol. iii. pp. 58, 78).
Moreover, this is no new view. The first who advanced this hypothesis
was the well-known French sinologist Deguignes. (*Vide* his 'Récherches
sur les Navigation des Chinois du côté de l’Asie, Mém. de l’Académie des
Inscriptions,' &c., vol. xxviii. pp. 505, 526). Klaproth, in his work
'Annales des Empereurs du Japon,' 1834, p. 4, has already pointed out
the mistakes into which Deguignes has fallen.

Mr Taravey published two *brochures* on the same subject. 'L’Amérique
sous le nom de Pays de Fusang, a-t-elle été connue en Asie dés le
cinquième siécle de notre ére, dans les grandes annales de la Chine.'
The other *brochure* is entitled 'L’Amérique sous le nom de Fusang.
Nouvelles preuves que le Pays de Fusang est l’Amérique.' I have not read
these dissertations. They are quoted by Andrae and Geiger, 1864, in the
'Bibliotheca Sinologica.' I am also equally unacquainted with the
article of Mr Neumann." (To this Dr Bretschneider appends as a
footnote--"Since writing the above, I have learned with regret of the
death of this eminent Oriental scholar.") "I believe, however, that the
Chinese notices about Fusang are all derived from one and the same
source, and each and all rest upon the statements of a lying Buddhist
priest, Hui-shên, who asserts that he was in Fusang. His stories are
found in the 'History of the Liang Dynasty' (502-556 A.D.), chap. liv.,
and are reproduced by Ma-tuan-lin, and in other historical works.

"The 'History of the Liang Dynasty' refers, in the same chapter in which
Fusang is spoken of, to a number of countries, chiefly islands, which
must be placed in the same category as Fusang--

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

that is to say, the intelligence regarding these countries rests upon
rumours and fables. In order to be able properly to estimate the
accounts relating to Fusang, I shall refer shortly to these countries.
The historian of the Liang dynasty speaks first of the land of the
dwarfs (Chu-ju-kuo), lying to the south of Japan. Here, probably, the
islands of Leu-chew are meant, whose inhabitants are really of little
stature. These accounts regarding the dwarfs are reproduced from the
history of the posterior Han. The Chinese first became acquainted in the
year 605 A. D. with the Leu-chew Islands. The lands of the naked men
(Lo-kuo), and the black-toothed men (Hei-chi), were reached in a year by
a sea-voyage in a south-easterly direction. The latter intelligence is
also reproduced from the history of the Han, and seems to be an allusion
to the nations which chew betel-nut. Ten thousand *li* south-west from
this is a country of islands inhabited by black nasty people with white
eyes. Their flesh is nevertheless very well tasted, and those who sail
thither shoot them in order to eat them. Wên-shên, the country in which
the people tattoo themselves, lies 7000 *li* north-east from Japan. The
inhabitants make large lines upon their bodies, and especially upon
their faces. By a stretch of the imagination, we might suppose the North
American Red Indians to be here meant. It is known, however, that the
Japanese have also the custom of tattooing themselves.

"Lastly, the country *Tahan* is mentioned as 5000 *li* east of the
above. War is here unknown. <span id="fr_79"></span>[1](#fn_79.md)
According to this information, we should look for Tahan somewhere in the
Pacific Ocean, or still further east. The historians of the Tang
dynasty, 618-907, however, assign this land to a place in the middle of
Siberia. The following is found in the <span id="img_16700"></span>
![](img/16700.jpg) chapter 259 b.

"'The land Tahan is rich in sheep and horses. These, and likewise the
men, are of great stature. Hence the name Tahan.

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

At the lake *Kien-hai* (Baikal, according to Father Hyacinth), the
countries of Kie-kia-ssŭ and Kü. The first, according to Klaproth
('Tableaux Historiques de l’Asie') and others, were the Hakas, the
ancestors of the present Kirghises, and dwelt in the present Siberian
government of Tomsk and Yenissey. They formed at the time of the Tang
dynasty a powerful country. The country of the Kü is described as richly
wooded. 'No grass, much moss. There are neither sheep nor horses. On
this account stags are used as domestic animals, and harnessed to carts
(sledges). They are fed with moss. The people are clothed with
stag-skins.' The Chinese historian adds to this, that the people of
Tahan had no early intercourse with the Chinese. It was only in the
first half of the seventh century that envoys from there came to the
Chinese court, and brought sables and horses. According to the above,
Tahan must have been a country on the Lena and Yenissey rivers.

"The above-mentioned Buddhist priest, Hui-shên, who arrived in China
towards the end of fifth century, relates:--

"'The kingdom of Fusang lies 20,000 *li* east from Tahan, and directly
cast from China. The name of the country is derived from the tree of
this name (Fusang), which grows there in abundance. Its leaves resembles
those of the tree T’ung. The young sprouts are like those of the bamboo,
and are eaten. The fruit resembles a pear, and is of a red colour. Cloth
is made out of the bark, and paper is also prepared from it. The houses
are built of planks. There are no cities. Arms and war are unknown.
There are two prisons in the country for light and confirmed criminals.
Carts drawn by horses; oxen or stags are employed. The deer are their
domestic animals, like cows in China. A fermented drink is prepared from
their milk. Mulberry-trees exist, and red pears, which can be preserved
for a whole year. Grapes thrive also. Silver and copper have no value
there. There is no iron, but plenty of copper. They possess writings.
The inhabitants of Fusang were formerly ignorant of the Buddhist
religion. Five priests from Ki-pin

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> (Cabal) went there
in 458 A.D., and carried with them the holy books and the faith.' I pass
over the wonderful descriptions which Hui-shên gives of the customs,
clothing of the sovereign, punishment, &c., in Fusang, as unessential,
for I believe that no conclusions can be drawn therefrom. The
translation of these details is found in Klaproth's 'Annales des
Empereurs du Japon,' v.

"The above is the Chinese intelligence about Fusang, which sprang out of
the fifth century, and, I believe, the only information we possess. In
later times, the Chinese poets, who seem to be gifted with a much
livelier imagination than some of our *savants*, have further developed
and richly embellished those reports with regard to the land of Fusang,
and have made out of it a complete land of fables, where mulberry-trees
grow to a height of several thousand feet, and where silk-worms are
found more than six feet in length. The statements about Fusang given by
M. Léon de Rosily in his 'Variétés Orientales,' from a Japanese
Encyclopædia, are probably borrowed from the Chinese. I have not,
however, read M. Rosny's work. (Cf. *Notes and Queries*, vol. iv. p.
19.) <span id="fr_80"></span>[1](#fn_80.md)

"In order to place the credibility of the Buddhist priest Hui-shên in
the proper light, I will yet mention what he further relates of his
journeys. He asserts, namely (*loco citato*), that there is a kingdom
1000 *li* east of Fusang in which are no men, but only women, whose
bodies are completely covered with hair. When they wish to become
pregnant, they bathe themselves in a certain river. The women have no
mammæ, but tufts of hair on the neck, by means of which they suckle
their children.

"Upon these vague and incredible traditions of a Buddhist monk, several
European savants have based the hypothesis that the Chinese had
discovered America 1300 years ago. Nevertheless,

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

it appears to me that these sinologues have not succeeded in robbing
Columbus of the honour of having discovered America. They might have
spared themselves the writing of such learned treatises on this subject.
It appears to me that the verdict passed upon the value of the
information of the Buddhist monk Hui-shên by Father Hyacinth is the most
correct. This well-known sinologue adds the following words merely after
the translation of the article 'Fusang' out of the 'History of the
Southern Dynasties:' 'Hui-shên appears to have been a consummate
humbug.' (Cf. 'The People of Central Asia,' by F. hyacinth.)

"I cannot, indeed, understand what ground we have for believing that
Fusang is America. We cannot lay great stress upon the asserted
distance, for every one knows how liberal the Chinese are with numbers.
By tamed stags we can at all events only understand reindeer. But these
are found as frequently in Asia as in America. Mention is also made of
horses in Fusang. This does not agree at all with America, for it is
well known that horses were first brought to America in the sixteenth
century. Neumann appears to base his hypothesis on the assumption that
the tree Fusang is synonymous with the Mexican aloe. Mr Sampson has
already refuted this error. (*Notes and Queries*, vol. iii. p. 78.)

"According to the description and drawings of the tree Fusang given by
the Chinese, there is no doubt that it is a Malvacea. In Peking, the
*Hibiscus rosa siniensis* is designated by this name, while *Hibiscus
syriacus* is here called Mu-kin. These names seem to hold good for the
whole of China. The description which is given in the Pun-tsáo-kang-mu
of both plants (xxxvi. p. 64 and 65) admits of no doubt that by the tree
Fusang, Chu-kin, Chi-kin, Ji-ki, is to be understood *Hibiscus rosa
siniensis*. It is also mentioned that this tree has a likeness to the
Mu-kin (*Hibiscus syriacus*). Its leaves resemble the mulberry-tree.
Very good drawings of both kinds of *Hibiscus* are found in the
Chi-wu-ming-shi-tu-k’ao (xxxv. pp. 58 and 34). The Buddhist priest
Hui-shên compares the tree Fusang with the

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

tree T’ung. Under this name the Chinese denote different large-leaved
trees. In the Chi-wu-ming-shi-tu-k’ao (xxx. p. 46), the tree T'ung is
represented with broadly ovate, cordate, entire great leaves, and with
great ovoid, acuminate fruits. Hoffman and Schultes ('Noms indigenes des
Plantes du Japon et de la Chine') have set down the tree T’ung as
*Paulownia imperialis*. This agrees quite well with the Chinese drawing.

"The tree T’ung must not be confounded with the Yu-t’ung tree (synonyma
Ying-tsŭ-t’ung, Jĕn-t’ung), from whose fruit is furnished the well-known
and very poisonous oil, Túng-yn, which the Chinese employ in varnish and
in painting. It should be the *Dryanda cordata*, according to others
*Elaeococca verucosa*. I have not seen the tree, but it is known to
occur very abundantly in Central China, and especially on the
Yang-tse-kiang. There is a Chinese description in the Pun-tsao (xxxv. p.
26), and a drawing of it in the Chi-wu-ming-shi-tu-k’ao (xxxv. p. 26).

"*Finally*, there is a tree which the Chinese call Wu-t’ung (synonyme
Chên). This tree has already been mentioned by Du Halde ('Description de
l’Empire Chinois'), as a curiosity, in which the seeds are found on the
edges of the leaves. This phenomenon is also described in the drawing of
the Chi-wu-ming-shi-tu-k’ao (xxxv. 56). Compare further the description
in the Pun-t’sao (xxxv a, 25). It is the *Sterculia plantanifolia*, a
beautiful tree with large leaves, lobed so as to resemble a hand, which
is cultivated in the Buddhist temples near Peking. The Chinese are quite
right in what they relate about the seeds. The seed-follicles burst, and
acquire the form of coriaceous leaves, bearing the seeds upon their
margin.

"The leaves of all the trees just now mentioned allow themselves to be
compared, as is done by the Chinese, with those of *Hibiscus*, or other
plants of the Malvaceous family, but have not the slightest resemblance
with the Mexican aloe or maguey tree (*Agave americana*), which has
massive, spiny-toothed, fleshy leaves. Mr Hanlay (*Chinese Recorder*,
vol. ii. p. 315), of San

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Francisco, cannot,
therefore, succeed in proving that the Buddhist priest Hui-shên
understood by Fusang the Mexican aloe.

"*Finally*, I have to mention a tree which, as regards its appearance
and usefulness, corresponds pretty much with the description given by
Hui-shên of the Fusang-tree. I am speaking of the useful tree
*Broussonetia papyrifera*, which grows wild *in the temperate parts of
Asia*, <span id="fr_81"></span>[1](#fn_81.md) especially in China, Japan,
Corea, Manchuria, &c., and besides, found on the islands of the Pacific,
while, as far as I know, it does not occur in America. The leaves of
this tree are remarkable for their varying very much in shape. The same
tree produces at once very large and quite small leaves. They are
sometimes entire, sometimes many-lobed. The fruit is round, of a deep
scarlet colour, and pulpy. It is a well-known fact that, in the parts
where this tree grows, its bark is used for the making of paper and the
manufacturing of clothing material. From ancient times it has been known
to the Chinese under the name Ch’u (synonyma *Kou*, KOU-SANG, Kou-shu.
Cf. Pun-t’sao-kang-mu, xxxvi. 10). An excellent of engraving of the tree
is found in the Chi-wu-ming-shi-tu-k’ao (xxxiii. 57). *Hui-shên, in his
botanical diagnosis, perhaps made a mistake with regard to the
Fusang-free, and confounded Broussonetia with Hibiscus*.

"Just as little as the Mexican aloe does the non-existence of iron in
the country Fusang prove that America is to be understood, for there
were many countries in ancient times which possessed copper, but where
the art of working iron was unknown. The Chinese report also that the
natives of the Leu-chew Island did not possess iron, but only copper.

"Mr Hanlay (*l.c.*) appears to have received the discovery of America by
the Chinese with the greatest enthusiasm. Perhaps I have furnished him,
by means of the above notice about the kingdom of women, *which Hui-shên
visited*, a new proof for his

<span id="page_173">p. 173</span>

view of the case. Fusang lies, according to Hui-shên, directly east from
China more than 20,000 *li*, thus about the situation of San Francisco
at the present day. The celebrated women's kingdom lies 1000 *li* still
further towards the east, thus about the country of Salt Lake City,
where, at the present day, the Mormons are, which, if not a women's
country, is nevertheless a country of many women, and where--to the
disgrace of the United States--prostitution is carried on under the mask
of the Christian religion.

"I do not agree with Mr Sampson (*Notes and Queries*, vol. iii. p. 79)
in supposing that Fusang must be identified with Japan, <span
id="img_17300"></span> ![](img/17300.jpg) *Ji-pen*, the land where the
sun rises; *for Japan has been well known to the Chinese since several
centuries before our era*, under another name. I avail myself of this
opportunity to add a few words about the earliest accounts which the
Chinese have of Japan. This country was primitively known to them under
the name Wo, which occurs for the first time in the history of the
posterior Han, 25-221, chapter 115. I cannot afford to give here a
translation of the whole article, and shall, therefore, only touch upon
some of the most important points. The kingdom Wo, it is said, is
situated on a group of islands in the great sea, south-east of Han (in
the south-western part of Corea), and is composed of about a hundred
principalities. Since the conquest of Chas-sien (Corea) by the Emperor
Wu-ti, 108 B.C., about thirty of these principalities entered into
relations with China. The most powerful of the rulers has his capital in
Ye-ma-t’ai. It is mentioned that neither tigers and leopards, nor oxen,
horses, sheep, and magpies exist. As far as I know, this last remark is
not true at present, at least, as far as horses and oxen are concerned;
it is true, however, that sheep cannot thrive in Japan, and the attempts
of Europeans to acclimatise them have been, until now, unsuccessful.

"In the reign of Kuang-wu, A.D. 25-58, envoys came from the Wo-nu with
presents to the Chinese court. They stated that their country was the
southernmost of the kingdom.

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

"The history of the Sui dynasty, 589-618, chapter 81, gives also the
name Wo to Japan, and contains an extensive article on this country. The
chief place of the kingdom is called here Ye-mi-sui.

"The name Ji-pên is given to Japan by Chinese historians, for the first
time, towards the end of the seventh century. I entertained until now
the opinion that the Japanese, who, as everybody knows, use these same
signs for the name of their country, but pronounce them *Ni-pon*, had
borrowed this name, together with the art of writing, from China.
(Chinese writing was introduced into Japan A.D. 280; Buddhism, A.D.
552.) (Cf. Klaproth, 'Annales des Empereurs du Japon,' ix. and p.. 20.)
For Japan could appear only to the Chinese (or any other people on the
continent of Asia) as the country where the sun rises. This, however,
does not seem to be the case, according to information derived from in
Chinese sources. In the history of the T’ang dynasty, 618-907, chapter
259 *a*, Japan is at first described under the ancient name Wo. Then
follows the description of the kingdom Ji-pên, of which the following is
said:--'Ji-pên is of the same origin as Wo. It lies on the boundaries of
the sun, therefore the name.' It is also related that the name Wo was
changed by the Japanese, for the reason that they found it inharmonious;
others say that Ji-pên was formerly a small state, and that Wo, in later
times, was incorporated in Ji-pên. The people who came from Ji-pên to
the court boasted of the power of their country, but the Chinese did not
put faith in their words. They told that this kingdom extended 1000 *li*
in all directions, and that it was bordered on the west and south by the
great sea, and on the north and east by high mountains. Beyond the
mountains live the Mas-jen, the hairy men. This, beyond doubt, refers to
the Ainos, well known for being hairy in appearance.

"The above information removes all doubts as to the Japanese origin of
the name Ji-pên, and the use of it at first for the designation of the
largest of the islands, and afterwards as the name

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

of the whole empire. Ye-ma-t’ai, as the Chinese called the chief town of
Japan, seems to designate the province Yamato, in which the emperors had
their residence in ancient times. It is difficult to say anything of the
origin of the name Wo. It is probable that the Chinese invented it, and
that the Japanese afterwards adopted it. I find in a Japanese historical
map of Japan the characters <span id="img_17500"></span>
![](img/17500.jpg) as designating the province Yamato. This province is
designated by these characters on all the historical maps up to the
beginning of the eighth century, whereas on the modern maps that
province is called <span id="img_17501"></span> ![](img/17501.jpg) Taho.

"Allow me to observe also, in relation to the above-mentioned history of
the posterior Han, a Nü-wang-kuo, a country of women, is spoken of in
the southern part of Japan. This statement is confirmed by the Japanese
annals. (Cf. Klaproth, 'Annales des Empereurs du Japon,' p. 13.) The
Japanese call this country Atsowma.

"The land Tahan, according to the foregoing observations, must have been
a province in Siberia. Fusang is said to lie to the east of Tahan.
Supposing, then, that a country, Fusang, really existed, and was not an
invention of a Buddhist monk, it does not necessarily follow that it is
to be sought on the other side of the ocean. Let me here observe, that
this monk mentions in no place in his account having passed over a great
sea. Klaproth, in assuming that Fusang is meant for the island of
Saghalien, is, I believe, more near to the truth than the other
sinologues.

"In *Notes and Queries* (vol. iv. p. 19) there is a passage cited out of
the Liang-ssŭ-kung-ki, that the kingdom of Fusang had sent envoys to
China. That would, of course, prove that the so-called country of Fusang
had political intercourse with China, but it makes it more unlikely that
America was here meant. We will, *therefore*, in the meantime, still
consider Fusang as a *terra incognita nec non dubia*, and bestow upon Mr
Burlinghame the double honour of having been the first American
Ambassador at the Chinese court, and first Chinese Ambassador in
America.

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

"The contradictory fancies about China that originate in the brains of
European literati are truly astonishing. Some maintain that the Chinese
discovered America 1300 years ago, while a well-known learned Frenchman,
Count Gobineau, has some years ago asserted that the Chinese have
immigrated from America. In his 'Essai sur l’Inégalité des Races
Humaines,' vol. ii. p. 242, Count Gobineau says:--'D’où venaient ces
pouples jaunes? Du grand continent d’Amérique. C’est la réponse de la
physiologie comme de la linguistique.'

"All these unfounded hypotheses have much the same value as the supposed
discovery of America by the Chinese.

       "PEKIN, 13*th* *June* 1870."

As a Chinese scholar, familiar with the histories of the country, and as
a resident in Pekin at the time of writing the foregoing letter, Dr
Bretschneider is entitled to an examination in detail. Beyond all doubt,
no writer whatever on the subject of Fusang, whether Deguignes, Neumann,
or D’Eichthal, has expressed himself so positively on the question. A
true disciple of the learned Klaproth, he with great ingenuity directs
his chief energies less to the subject of dispute than to impugning the
honesty or sense of his opponents.

In the beginning, Dr Bretschneider disposes of all that Deguignes
alleges, by declaring that "Klaproth has already pointed out the
mistakes into which the latter has fallen." By this effective summary,
those who have not read Deguignes and Klaproth are fully informed in a
few words of the greater part of the argument--as it appeared to Dr
Bretschneider; and as he had not read Professor Neumann's or other works
on

<span id="page_177">p. 177</span>

the subject, he is, of course, relieved from the awkward responsibility
of answering many statements which would perhaps have interfered with
his own theories. As he makes no mention, indeed, of M. Gustave
d’Eichthal, we must conclude that he either had never heard of the
articles which had appeared several years before in the *Révue
Archæologique*, or passed them by as trifles unworthy his attention.

"The Chinese notices of Fusang," says Dr Bretschneider, "are all derived
from the same source, and each and all rest upon the statements of a
lying Buddhist priest." He does not deny, or he rather admits plainly,
that the steps towards Fusang are laid down faithfully enough until we
reach Tahan. No one, indeed, can well deny this who has read Deguignes
with any care. But the credibility of Hoei-shin. is utterly destroyed,
according to Dr Bretschneider, firstly, by the stories embroidered by
Chinese poets on his narrative hundreds of years after the monk was in
his grave, and, secondly, by the story of the Kingdom of Women.

I have already observed that Hoei-shin says nothing of having visited
this Kingdom of Women, but speaks of it as being a thousand *li* east of
Fusang. In our day, it is no longer the fashion to utterly discredit the
older travellers because they gilded and illuminated their texts with
arabesque marvels, especially when they only told the tales as they were
told to them. Judged by such a standard, all the travels of Buddhist

<span id="page_178">p. 178</span>

monks to the West must be entirely thrown out of history, Herodotus set
down as the father of lies, and every one of the Old World pilgrims
discredited with him. In fact, the *falsus in uno falsus in omnibus*
ground no longer obtains in criticism, and allowance is now made for the
simple credulity of twilight times. Scholars do not usually announce
their personal opinions as overwhelming arguments, or call names, and it
is to be regretted that a man of Dr Bretschneider's erudition should
have informed the sinologues who differ with him that "they might have
spared themselves the trouble of writing such learned treatises on this
subject." That he likes this method of argument by inspiration spiced
with personality appears from his evident admiration of Father Hyacinth,
who, as he tells us, *merely* added to the article "Fusang" the
following words--"Hui-shên appears to have been a consummate humbug."

Dr Bretschneider adduces the story of the Kingdom of Women as a reason
for discrediting Hoei-shin. Yet, when it strengthens his own position,
he informs us that a country of women was believed to exist in Southern
Japan.

"Neumann," says Dr Bretschneider, "appears to base his hypothesis on the
assumption that the tree Fusang is synonymous with the American aloe."
As he confessedly had not read Professor Neumann's work, it was hardly
fair to judge by hearsay, or to inform his public (even under the shield
of an "appears")

<span id="page_179">p. 179</span>

what Neumaun's "hypothesis" was. The reader of these pages is aware that
Professor Neumann by no means based his belief in Hoei-shin's narrative
simply on the maguey plant. "Mr Sampson,", says Dr Bretschneider, "has
already refuted this error." Mr Simson had, it is true, fully proved
that Hoei-shin gave to the maguey a name not now applicable to the
Chinese plants which bear it. But neither Mr Simson nor Dr Bretschneider
disproves the *main* fact--that Hoei-shin described a very singular
Mexican plant not known in Asia. The pictures which have been made by
Chinese botanists since the fifth century are very little to the
purpose. It seems to have escaped the notice of all writers that
Hoei-shin, which he calls the tree a Fusang, says it resembles the
T’ung, <span id="fr_82"></span>[1](#fn_82.md) a very different plant, the
leaves of which, though in other respects unlike those of the maguey,
are large. This indicates that by the word Fusang we are to understand
some American term, which to the Chinese sounded like one already
familiar to them. And it is remarkable that one point--and that, indeed,
the principal one in the Fusang controversy--has been overlooked by
every writer on the subject, from Deguignes to Bretschneider, which is,
that Hoei-shin, while he calls the tree a Fusang, states that its

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

leaves resemble those of another plant, and its sprouts those of yet
another. It is not remarkable that, with these qualifications left out
of sight, neither Mr Simson nor Dr Bretschneider could find the
mysterious plant among the Fusang-trees of China. Nothing can be more
plain than that, while giving to the American plant a name like that of
one in China, the monk by no means meant the latter. "The sprouts," he
says, "*on the contrary*, resemble those of the bamboo-tree." Yet in the
face of this statement, Mr Simson and Dr Bretschneider assert, as if it
were an argument, that the maguey plant is not the Fusang--when the monk
had taken pains to say the same thing, and even to emphasise his denial.
But, as a concluding paragraph on this subject, Dr Bretschneider informs
us that there is a Chinese tree--not the Fusang but Kousang--which
strikingly resembles it, and then naively remarks that this was perhaps
the one seen by Hoei-shin. The correction will be cheerfully admitted by
all who believe it possible that the Buddhist monk was in America; and I
avail myself of the opportunity to declare that Dr Bretschneider,
whatever his peculiarities of criticism may be, is undoubtedly a good
sinologist, and deeply learned in Chinese botany, and that his learning
has, in this respect, done much for the cause of Hoei-shin, while his
arguments *pro contra* have not injured it in the least. Hoei-shin in
all likelihood did make a mistake in confounding *Broussonetia* with
*Hibiscus*; but so that there is in China a Kousang, very much
resembling what the

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

monk chose to call Fusang, we can ask no more. Dr Bretschneider honestly
admits that Hoei-shin saw in Mexico a plant to which he gave a wrong
name, and corrects this error. To an unprejudiced critic these botanical
blunders of the old monk, obscured in all probability by provincial
terms and errors of copyists, so far from invalidating the main facts,
actually confirm them; and in this instance, where Dr Bretschneider is
inspired by positive science, he makes an admission favourable to the
credibility of Hoei-shin.

It is, however, strange that so learned a man should assert that because
there were in ancient times many other countries where iron was unknown,
therefore Hoei-shin's observation that it was not used in Fusang must go
for nothing. Iron was known to all the civilised countries with which
Hoei-shin was acquainted--what his ideas of Lew-chew were we cannot
ascertain--and when be found in Fusang an apparently civilised race
without iron, *and not using gold or copper for money*, he naturally
recorded these peculiarities. It is remarkable that this was the case in
Mexico. Four statements are here made--one relative to a plant, and
three to metals--all of them true as regards America, and not one of
them confirmed as regards China or India in the fifth century. According
to Dr Bretschneider's argument, the most accurate account of the
inhabitants of America, and their customs, must be set down as proving
nothing, whenever anything similar can be proved of other countries in
ancient times.

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

Dr Bretschneider states that Hoei-shin declares he visited the Kingdom
of Women; but, as I have already shown, the monk uses the term "it is
said" with reference to the great marvel of this country--the
extraordinary manner of suckling the children--which he would not have
done had he witnessed it. And here we are again indebted to Dr
Bretschneider for another inadvertent, yet most important, admission.
For, as he declares, Fusang lies--according to Hoei-shin--more than
20,000 *li* directly east from China, about the situation of San
Francisco; and that the Women's Kingdom, if it existed, must have been
where the Mormons now dwell. Now the question on which the whole turns
is really this, and nothing more:--Did Hoei-shin mean that there was a
country on the spot where, as is now known, land exists? The monk had a
perfect right to state his distances, and here Dr Bretschneider clearly
admits that the distance was accurately estimated. It may be remarked,
by the way, that prostitution has literally no existence in Utah, being
vigorously repressed by the Mormons, and that our author has evidently
been strangely misinformed as to the country. It is carried on, he says,
under the mask of the Christian religion, an assertion which would be
perfectly true if applied to Berlin or Paris, or in fact to any German
or French city where it is legalised by the Government, but which cannot
be said of the United States of America, and least of all of Utah, where
the people are not Christians at all. It would be insulting

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

to a scholar like Dr Bretschneider to insinuate that he does not know
the difference between prostitution and polygamy. I prefer to believe
that he wrote under a misapprehension of Mormon institutions. If,
however, we are to understand from Dr Bretschneider's text that he
alludes to the American Government as wearing a mask of the Christian
religion, I would say, as an American, firstly, that the expression is
needlessly offensive; and secondly, that as there is no connection
whatever in the United States between Church and State, it is devoid of
truth.

"Klaproth," says Dr Bretschneider, "in assuming that Fusang is meant for
the Island of Saghalien, is, I believe, more near to the truth than the
other sinologues." What then becomes of the perplexing Country of
Women--but just now in Utah, and at another time in Japan? If anybody's
statements and measurements are to be accepted, they are certainly those
of Hoei-shin himself, and they are plain enough--"Twenty thousand *li*
east of Tahan"--Tahan being plainly Siberia, as Dr Bretschneider admits,
when he finds it convenient to do so, for the sake of a bitter word
against America.

A passage cited from an old Chinese chronicle asserts that envoys once
went from Fusang to China. This, Dr Bretschneider allows, would prove
that Fusang had intercourse with the Celestial Kingdom, "but," as he
declares, "makes it still more unlikely that America was here meant." In
explanation, I will

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

cite the passage as given in the "Notes and Queries for China and
Japan."

"The 'Liang-sze-kung-ki' says that envoys from Fu-sang brought as
tribute 'gems for observing the sun,' like square and circular mirrors,
more than a foot in circumference, and transparent like glass. Looking
at the reflection of the sun in them, one could see very distinctly and
brightly the palace in the sun." <span id="fr_83"></span>[1](#fn_83.md)

This refers distinctly enough to something very like those curious
metallic mirrors made in China, and common even in London, by means of
which characters or pictures on the back are seen by reflecting the
sun's rays on the wall. But in any case, if such mirrors were ever
brought to China, they were much more likely to have come from
sun-worshipping Mexico, where metal and other work was made with great
ingenuity, than from Siberia, or even from Japan itself at that time.
But it is still utterly incomprehensible why the proving that Fusang
sent ambassadors to China

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

should "*make it still more unlikely that America is here meant*." There
is no reason to arbitrarily assume that ambassadors could not come from
America. But Dr Bretschneider treats this as his most conclusive
argument; indeed, as the only conclusive one, since he immediately
declares, "We will *therefore* still consider Fusang as a *terra
incognita nec non dubia*."

In brief, Dr Bretschneider asserts that there was no Fusang, it being
all the invention of a lying priest--but that it was in Siberia. There
was never any such place, but still Mr Simson is wrong in placing it in
Japan, and Klaproth is right in declaring it was at Saghalien. There was
no Fusang-tree either, but the monk who saw it meant the Kou-sang,
describing more accurately, however, a Mexican plant. Klaproth refuted
Deguignes and exposed his errors by proving that Fusang was also in
Japan; only in Dr Bretschneider's opinion it was elsewhere. And it is
certainly curious that the writers who utterly discredit the very
existence of Fusang, and all that is said of it, have each a theory as
to where it really was.

To verify history is the chief object of scholarship, just as to
investigate Nature is the aim of science. Every year sees the former
more guided by the latter, and it is well that it should be so, even as
it is well that parents who, as they grow old, look more and more into
the past, should be tenderly guarded by their vigorous children. To
prove who first from the Old World explored the New is no trifling
problem in history, and

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> I am well assured
that the investigation of the record of Hoei-shin will by no means rest
where it is. What we want is not to establish a favourite fancy, but to
ascertain the truth. It does not appear to many people, whose opinions
are entitled to respect, that the story of Hoei-shin is settled.
Liars--above all, lying travellers--are never brief, and had Hoei-shin
been "a consummate humbug," he would have hardly left such a concise
narrative as is given in the Annals. Time will probably show whether
these Buddhist monks ever existed, and whether they ever were in
America--

"The truth, which long in darkness lay,  
Will come with clearness to the day."

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And if their story
be proved a misrepresentation, or a myth founded on some old fable, we
may at least get from the inquiry set afoot a clue to its source, and
hints, or perhaps solid information, as to the great mystery of the
early settlement of America. We are still groping in darkness as regards
the past: the wonderful discoveries of the last fifty years may well
teach us this.

It is the impulsive--it may be the credulous--spirit, loving marvels and
novelty, which awakes these researches, and the negative, doubting, and
incredulous inquiry which tests them. I trust that in this book both the
believers and disbelievers in Hoei-shin's narrative have been honestly
represented. If I have inadvertently spoken harshly of Klaproth and his
disciple Bretschneider, I can only say that my severest

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

words are like flattery itself compared to what others have said in
print of both these scholars. As it is, I cannot resist the honest
conviction that both have, by their opposition, kept the question from
subsiding into oblivion, and unwittingly brought forth, if not positive
proofs, at least a mass of probabilities in favour of Hoei-shin before
which their opposition was trifling.

The truth is, that the vindication of Hoei-shin is of little importance
in itself compared to what lies behind it and what it may lead to. I
refer to those early ages peopled by strange and cloudy forms--ages not
without gleams of barbaric splendour--hinted at in the account of the
embassies bearing mirrors in which could be seen "the palace of the
sun"--perhaps that very Palace of the Sun itself known so well to the
Mexicans. Should the investigation lead to anything positive relative to
the early settlement of America, and to the action or reaction of the
Old World and the New, the little journal of the humble priest, who did
not even claim to be the first from beyond sea whose footsteps had
fallen in the Golden Land of Fusang, may well be allowed to pass into
oblivion, if nothing more occurs to confirm its authenticity.

still keep one burning, and it is not many years since the Chippeways
extinguished theirs. I have in my possession a common burning-glass,
which I once dug out of an old Chippeway grave; and it is to be observed
that burning-glasses, which were in great demand from the traders by the
Chippeways while they worshipped the sacred fire, are now no longer
called for. This is not owing to the introduction of matches, for (as is
proved by the contents of several tobacco-bags in my possession) the
Chippeways generally use flint and steel to obtain a light.--C. G. L.
