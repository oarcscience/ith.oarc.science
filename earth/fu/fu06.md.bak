### CHAPTER III.

### TAHAN OR ALIASKA, AND ITS DISCOVERY.

DURING the dynasty of Leang, in the first half of the sixth century, the
Chinese often heard of a land situated 5000 of their miles to the
eastward of the Painted People, who dwelt in the Aleutian Islands, and
named it Tahan, or Great China. The direction and distance indicate the
great peninsula Aliaska. They probably named it *Great* China from their
having heard of the continent which extends beyond. It was in a
precisely similar manner, according to the legend, that the Irish, who
in earlier ages, long before the time of Columbus, were cast away on the
American shores, named the country Great Ireland. <span
id="fr_15"></span>[1](#fn_15.md) They reported that the newly-discovered
nation altogether resembled the Painted People, but spoke an entirely
different language. The Tahan bore no weapons, and knew nothing of war
and strife. <span id="fr_16"></span>[2](#fn_16.md)

Beyond Aliaska the Chinese discovered, at the end of the fifth century,
a land which Deguignes, in fact,

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

afterwards sought for on the north-west part of the American Continent.
The conjecture of that keen-witted scholar was subsequently fully
verified, and we are now able to determine those parts of America
described by the Chinese. The zealous inquiries relating to a state of
civilisation long passed away, and to such of its remains as yet exist
in the New World, have led in our days to results of which the inquirer
of the eighteenth century could have had no intimation. We will now give
a literal translation of the Chinese report, and afterwards its
explanation.

### THE KINGDOM OF FUSANG, OR MEXICO.

"During the reign of the dynasty *Tsi*, in the first year of the
year-naming, 'Everlasting Origin' (A.D. 499), came a Buddhist priest
from this kingdom, who bore the cloister-name of Hoei-schin, *i.e.*,
Universal Compassion, <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md) to the present
district of Hukuang, and those surrounding it, who narrated that Fusang
is about twenty thousand Chinese miles in an easterly direction from
Tahan, and east of the Middle Kingdom. Many Fusang trees grow there,
whose leaves resemble the *Dryanda cordifolia*; <span
id="fr_18"></span>[2](#fn_18.md) the sprouts, on the contrary,

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

resemble those of the bamboo-tree, <span id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)
and are eaten by the inhabitants of the land. The fruit is like a pear
in form, but is red. From the bark they prepare a sort of linen which
they use for clothing, and also a sort of ornamented stuff." (With
regard to this, the Year-Books of Leang have a variation: instead of the
character KIN (11, 492 B.), meaning "embroidered stuff," or embroidered
and ornamented stuff in general, we have MIEN, which signifies "fine
silk.") "The houses are built of wooden beams; fortified and walled
places are there unknown."

### OF WRITING AND CIVIL REGULATIONS IN FUSANG.

"They have written characters in this land, and prepare paper from the
bark of the Fusang. The people have no weapons, and make no wars; but in
the arrangements for the kingdom they have a northern and a southern
prison. Trifling offenders were lodged in the southern prison, but those
confined for greater offences in the northern; so that those who were
about to receive grace could be placed in the southern prison, and those
who were not, in the northern. Those men and women who were imprisoned
for life were allowed to

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

marry. The boys resulting from these marriages were, at the age of eight
years, sold as slaves; the girls not until their ninth year. If a man of
any note was found guilty of crimes, an assembly was held; it must be in
an excavated place." (*Grube*, Ger. "a pit;" possibly within an
embankment or circle of earth.--C. G. L.) "There they strewed ashes over
him, and bade him farewell. If the offender was one of a lower class, he
alone was punished; but when of rank, the degradation was extended to
his children and grandchildren. With those of the highest rank it
attained to the seventh generation."

### THE KINGDOM AND THE NOBLES OF FUSANG.

"The name of the king is pronounced Ichi. The nobles of the first-class
are termed Tuilu; of the second, Little Tuilu; and of the third,
Na-to-scha. When the prince goes forth, he is accompanied by horns and.
trumpets. The colour of his clothes changes with the different years. In
the two first of the ten-year cyclus they are blue; in the two next,
red; in the two following, yellow; in the two next, red; and in the last
two, black."

### MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.

"The horns of the oxen are so large that they hold ten bushels. They use
them to contain all manner of

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

things. Horses, oxen, and stags are harnessed to their waggons. Stags
are used here as cattle are used in the Middle Kingdom, and. from the
milk of the hind they make butter. The red pears of the Fusang-tree keep
good throughout the year. Moreover, they have apples and reeds. From the
latter they prepare mats. No iron is found in this land; but copper,
gold, and silver are not prized, and do not serve as a medium of
exchange in the market.

"Marriage is determined upon in the following manner:--The suitor builds
himself a hut before the door of the house where the one longed for
dwells, and waters and cleans the ground every morning and evening. When
a year has passed by, if the maiden is not inclined to marry him, he
departs; should she be willing, it is completed. When the parents die,
they fast seven days. For the death of the paternal or maternal
grandfather they lament five days; at the death of elder or younger
sisters or brothers, uncles or aunts, three days. They then sit from
morning to evening before an image of the ghost, absorbed in prayer, but
wear no mourning-clothes. When the king dies, the son who succeeds him
does not busy himself for three years with State affairs.

"In earlier times these people lived not according to the laws of
Buddha. But it happened that in the second year-naming 'Great Light,' of
Song (A.D. 458), five beggar-monks from the kingdom of Kipin went to

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

this land, extended over it the religion of Buddha, and with it his holy
writings and images. They instructed the people in the principles of
monastic life, and so changed their manners."

### AMAZONIA.

The same Buddhist monk who gives this account of the land Fusang, tells
us of a country of women. "This land," he writes, "lies about a thousand
Chinese miles in an easterly direction from Fusang, and is inhabited by
white people with very hairy bodies." <span
id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) The entire story is, however, intermixed
with so much fabulous matter, that it is not worth translating. It is,
however, worthy of remark, that since the earliest times every civilised
race which has left us written records of its existence spoke of a land
of women, which was always placed farther and farther to the north-east,
until we find it ultimately placed in America. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md) It is hardly necessary to say that such a
land of women could never have existed. It is, however, possible that
among various tribes here and there the women may have had separate
dwelling-places; perhaps apart upon an island, and held intercourse with
the men only from time to time. The Arabs, particularly Edrisi, speak

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

of such an arrangement, but thought that this land of women lay in an
altogether different direction. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md) The
knowledge of the Arabs and Persians of the east and north-eastern parts
of the world extended only to Japan and the eastern shores of China. "To
the eastward of Japan," asserts Abulfeda distinctly, "the earth is
uninhabited."

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_15"></span>[24:1](fu06.htm#fr_15.md) Münchener Gelehrte
Anzeigen, viii. 636. This must have been the land extending from the two
Carolinas to the southern point of Florida.

<span id="fn_16"></span>[24:2](fu06.htm#fr_16.md) Leang-schu and
Mantuanlin, *a. a. o*.

<span id="fn_17"></span>[25:1](fu06.htm#fr_17.md) According to King-tschu
it signifies "an old name." King-tschu is the sixth of the nine
provinces which are described in the tax-roll of Ju, which contains the
sixth of the included divisions of the Annual Book. It extended from the
north side of the hill King. Compare Hongingta, the celebrated expounder
of King in the times of Tang, with the already-mentioned extracts from
the Annual or Year-Book.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[25:2](fu06.htm#fr_18.md) In the Leang-schu we find
an error in the writing (a very common <span id="page_26">p. 26</span>
occurrence in Chinese transcriptions): instead of the character TONG;
(4, 233 Bas.), we have Tang (11, 444 B.), which signifies *copper*, and
according to which we must read, "Their leaves resemble copper," which
is evidently an error.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[26:1](fu06.htm#fr_19.md) This is the case also in
China with the bamboo sprouts, on which account they are called *sun*
(7, 449 B.); *i.e.*, the buds of the first ten days, since they only
keep for that time.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[29:1](fu06.htm#fr_20.md) The reports are given in
the Kansse, bk. 79, p. 6; Leang-schu, bk. 64, p. 49; and from these much
more correctly in the Encyclopædia of Mantuanlin, bk. 327, *a. A*.

<span id="fn_21"></span>[29:2](fu06.htm#fr_21.md) The Japanese have in
their *facetiæ* an account of such a country.--C. G. L.
