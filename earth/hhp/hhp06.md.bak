### CHAPTER IV.

### THE MYSTERY OF THE HEAVENS.

OF all the natural images familiar to the mind none is more radiant, and
none more tranquil, than that of the rolling year as it circles
perpetually about the feet of God. Even in the midst of cloud and fog,
the mere striking of a clock, that record of planetary motion, serves to
remind us how circumscribed is the surrounding gloom, and how the dull
earth beneath our feet is, even as we gaze upon it, shining to its far
companions in the fields of light. As that lustrous orbit is woven,
revolution after revolution, with never-failing beauty, cycle after
cycle of age-long periods, like golden serpents, twine themselves

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

around it, and span the gulfs of time with the years of the Most High.

Such a system of harmonious periods and of measured intervals,
corresponding to universal, not arbitrary, standards, was a natural, and
indeed an essential, element in the theosophy of a priesthood whose
religious teaching was intentionally veiled under the analogies of
astronomy. In examining therefore the astronomical science of the
"Mystery-Teachers of the Heavens," <span id="fr_18"></span>[\*](#fn_18.md)
to use the official title employed in the Court of Pharaoh, we may not
unreasonably expect to trace the origin and signification of various
familiar measures, of which the use is widely diffused, but the
fundamental conception unknown. Nor shall we be altogether disappointed
in

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

this respect; while a sudden and vivid interest will be found to attach
to the common units of time and space, when we perceive that they are
not the fruit of any arbitrary arrangement, however ingenious, but are
the products of universal concords, and represent, so to speak, the
beats and bars of the music of the spheres.

That the moon was the sacred and, at least in early times, the secret
standard of

<span id="img_11200"></span> ![Balance before Thoth.](img/11200.jpg.md)  
Balance before Thoth.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egyptian science,
there seems little doubt. Thoth, the Great Lord of Wisdom and of
Measure, the divine recorder, before whom stood the Balance of Justice,
wherein the light and darkness of man's moral life were

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

weighed, was lord, not of the sun, but of the moon; and to that latter
orb we are indebted for our fundamental standards both of space and
time, as we may easily see, remembering always that we are dealing with
approximate measures, and "mean," or average motions. For the position
of a heavenly body is, in general, not the same to an observer on the
earth's surface as it would be if he were stationed at its centre, which
is the chief point of astronomical reference. This difference, or
parallax, must therefore be always taken into consideration; and in the
case of the moon, when on the horizon, it is found to be about <span
id="fr_19"></span>[\*](#fn_19.md) the three hundred and sixtieth part of
the circle of the heavens—that is, a degree; and conversely therefore
the fundamental measure of the circle is given by the difference between
the moon's apparent position on rising

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

at any place as seen by an observer at the earth's surface, and the
position in which it would appear at the same moment if viewed by an
observer at the centre of the earth. Equally simple is the fundamental
measure of time, viz. the hour or period required by the moon in her
orbit, relatively to the sun, to traverse a space equal to her own disc;
and this measure was peculiarly sacred in Egypt, each hour of the
twenty-four which elapse during a single rotation <span
id="fr_20"></span>[\*](#fn_20.md) of the earth being consecrated to its own
particular deity, twelve of light and twelve of darkness. "Explain the
God in the Hour" is the demand made of the adept in the Hall of
Justification. And that God in the Hour, we learn, was Thoth, the Lord
of the Moon, and "the Reckoner of the Earth."

A singular relation of a similar kind exists

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

between the lunar period and the risings of the stars, which was also
utilized by the Egyptian astronomers. For whereas in regard to the
apparent position of the sun, relatively to the rest of the heavens, the
motion of the earth in her orbit has a perceptible effect; in regard to
the stars, the distances are so enormous that the orbit of the earth
shrinks into insignificance. The time therefore which elapses between
any two successive risings of the same star at any given place will, on
the average, be a little less than that between any two successive
risings of the sun at that place; since in the first case the time
depends only upon the complete rotation of the place round the centre of
the earth, whereas in the latter, the motion of the earth's centre
during the interval must be taken into account. This difference is, on
the average, about four minutes in every twenty-four hours, and will,
therefore, in fifteen days, amount to an hour. Accordingly, as we learn
from a most interesting

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

paper published by Professor Renouf on a kalendar of the
XIX<sup>th</sup> dynasty, the observations of the stars were taken every
fifteenth day, thus correlating the sidereal period with the lunar
period of the hour.

Again, the interval which on the average elapses between the moments in
which the moon successively comes to the full (always in relation to a
given place such as Memphis), that is to say a lunar month or "lunation"
is about 29½ solar days. Suppose now we take as an unit of time thirty
such solar days; then each lunar month would fall short of that period
by half a day or one-sixtieth part, and the lunar year, consisting of
twelve such periods, would fall short by six days, so that all the
measures would be proportionate. Here, then, we possess the key to a
most singular correlation between the lunar motions and the solar months
(consisting always of thirty solar days), which Dr. Brugsch has pointed
out in the Table of Edfu; which was published in the

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

days of the Ptolemies, but never, apparently, while a native monarch
reigned. On the first day was celebrated the "conception of the moon,"
when that orb was on the meridian at noon (while still invisible to the
observer)—a refinement unknown to our kalendar; on the second day its
birth, or first appearance, and so on throughout the month of thirty
days. During the first month, therefore, the lunar intervals would of
course correspond more or less precisely with the solar days. But
whereas the two sets would grow progressively asunder, the lunar names
remained affixed to the same solar days. Thus the first day of each
solar month was called the conception of the moon, and the second new
moon, although neither phenomenon might have taken place anywhere near
the time—a method of expression necessitating, it would seem, a double
form of register, and simple enough to those who held the clue, but to a
stranger hopelessly misleading.

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

Turning now to the motions of our own planet we find, as Dr. Brugsch has
shown, that the Egyptian division of the solar, or to speak more
correctly, of the terrestrial year, depended upon a knowledge of the
365¼ rotations performed by the earth while completing (approximately)
one revolution, around the sun—an extra day being intercalated every
fourth or "grand" year. But this method of regarding the matter arises
out of our own slovenly method of expressing astronomical ideas, and our
habitual employment of language embodying the confused and confusing
conceptions of the Greeks; and it by no means does justice to the
Egyptian exactness. The truth is that a single year or revolution of the
earth is marked by no cosmic or universal correspondence. Only in the
fourth or "grand" year, as it was termed, is a harmony established by
the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) completion of the rotary and
revolutionary motions; while at the same time

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

the sun himself, drawing with him the whole planetary system, completes
an arc of his own mighty orbit, about equal to the whole circuit of the
course of the earth. Accordingly, every year appears to have included
(as it does in reality) the three hundred and sixty-sixth day. But
adhering strictly to the fact, the last solar day of the old year was
identical with the first of the new, the day of "completion-beginning;"
except in every fourth or grand year, when the earth's revolution being
completed simultaneously, or very nearly simultaneously, with a
rotation, the two festivals became distinct. Moreover, since four
minutes (of time) a day, amounts in the course of a year to the time
occupied by a complete rotation of the earth, it follows that the number
of such rotations or sidereal days in each year exceeds by one the solar
days; the difference being due to the fact that the change in the
earth's position every twenty-four hours, owing to its orbital motion,
must be taken into consideration

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

in regard to the sun, but is imperceptible when compared with the
distance of the stars. By the method of reckoning therefore, above
described, the solar or apparent days are harmonized with the number of
earth's true rotations. This being the principle, every year admitted of
division into two portions, one consisting of an orbit of three hundred
and sixty days, of which the lunar year fell short by the same number of
days as the solar year exceeded it; the other, that of the sacred
interval or "panegyric," as Dr. Brugsch applies the term, consisting of
six days, each being a festival of special sanctity.

That orbit again of three hundred and sixty days, was itself divided not
only into twelve equal solar months, but also into three equal seasons
(each of one hundred and twenty days), corresponding, as Dr. Brugsch has
shown, to the three great physical divisions of the Egyptian year—the
season of the inundation ("Se"), commencing with the rise of the Nile,
about

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

the time of the new moon nearest the summer solstice; the season of
winter ("Pir"), and the season of heat ("Semou") answering more or less
to our spring. Hence in every year the period of three hundred and sixty
days was divided either into three equal seasons, each containing twelve
decades of days, or into twelve equal months, each containing three
decades of days; while the sacred interval bore the same ratio to that
whole period (one-sixtieth) as a minute (of circular arc) bears to a
degree; and the excess quarter of a day upon which the whole arrangement
depended bore the same ratio to the sacred interval (one twenty-fourth)
as the solar hour to the complete day. It is not unworthy of remark
also, that whereas in the order of the seasons, as corrected by Dr.
Brugsch, their hieroglyphs have no correspondence with the physical year
(as Champollion believed to be the case), and appear therefore to be
arbitrary and unmeaning; yet

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

when we refer to the course of the soul in the Ritual, we find them to
symbolize three successive stages of its progress; the fields, <span
id="img_12200"></span> ![](img/12200.jpg) of Aahlu, into which it comes
forth from the Chamber of New Birth; the Enclosure, <span
id="img_12201"></span> ![](img/12201.jpg) of the Hidden Lintel of
Justice, the beginning of Justification; and the source of the Celestial
Nile, <span id="img_12202"></span> ![](img/12202.jpg), where it receives
the crown of Illumination.

For ordinary purposes and comparatively short periods the reckoning of
the Grand Cycle suffices; but for long intervals the correspondence is
not sufficiently exact; the real difference each year falling short of a
quarter of a day by nearly twelve minutes, or the fifth part of an hour
(less a certain number of seconds). But the fifth part of an hour will,
it is obvious, in thirty years, itself amount to six hours, that is, to
a quarter of a day; and accordingly, every thirty years we find a
special festival or Jubilee celebrated in the Kalendar of Egypt: thus
commemorating

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

the period said to have been occupied in building the Pyramid of Light.
And in five hundred years, or the Egyptian Cycle of the Phoenix, the
same difference will amount to between four and five days, that is, very
nearly to the sacred interval; so that if that interval be omitted, the
orbit of the coming year joins the orbit of the departing, and every
five hundred years the Phoenix renews itself. All these cycles therefore
centre round the adjustment of the quarter of a day; and so essential an
element was that quarter in all calculations relating to the kalendar,
that every fourth year, if we may trust Horapollo, the festival was
celebrated by the addition of a quarter of an acre to the land belonging
to the temples.

Of the three seasons, that of the inundation was the first and
principal; and the flood of the Nile ran like a sparkling current
through the religion of the country. "I am the Inundation," says the
Creator in the sixty-fourth

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

chapter, said to be the oldest of the Ritual, "the Light of the Second
Birth." Every stage in the annual flood of the life-giving river was the
subject of a special festival. Some little time before the summer
solstice, the first symptom of the coming rise was given by the waters
in Upper Egypt becoming suffused with a crimson colour. Of this singular
phenomenon, which goes by the name of "Red Nile," Herodotus has left a
very fine account; and it is curious to note, as an instance of strong
accord between ancient and modern travellers, that his description is
quoted at great length by the eminent living Egyptologist, Professor
Maspéro. The Red Nile is remarkable in every way; but in none perhaps
more than in the fact that the waters are at that time peculiarly sweet,
while at "Green Nile," as another period is called, the reverse is the
case. To the former condition, in connection with the midsummer sun,
allusion seems to be made in the "Eye filled with blood," mentioned in
the Ritual; and to the

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

latter in the "intolerable stench" made by Osiris in the river. About
the period corresponding to our month of July, the waters begin to rise;
and the "Sailing of the Bark of Ra" was celebrated, together with the
birthday of Osiris. A few days later was held the great Assembly at the
Nilometer, or sacred "Tat," the most venerated symbol known to their
worship; and the first proclamation of the rise was made. Towards the
middle of August took place the cutting of the Grand Dyke, whereby the
risen stream was permitted to overflow into private channels; a ceremony
celebrated in more modern times as the "Marriage of the Nile," but known
to the ancient world as the festival of the "Digging of the Earth." No
less a sanctity, in short, attached to every phase of that stream of
life than to the "Celestial Nile" itself, of which the earthly river was
the image and counterpart.

It may now be not uninteresting or uninstructive to compare for a moment
the system

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

of Egypt with our own Leap Year, for which we are, in fact, indebted to
that country, through the astronomer Sosigenes, who was imported by
Julius Cæsar from Alexandria, to remedy in some degree the confusion of
the Roman Kalendar. That famous Greek appears to have performed his task
very much after a fashion not unknown to adapters. He cared—perhaps he
knew—very little about the astronomical principle involved in the
Egyptian reckoning, and nothing at all about the niceties of further
adjustment which it demanded; indeed, before half a century was passed,
his own corrections required to be corrected. He took no heed of
standard or of measure, of orbit or of sacred interval. But first he cut
up the year into twelve unequal and unmeaning bits—to say he divided it
into portions is far too scientific an expression—which rags bore indeed
the name of the insulted moon, but of which that mighty measurer
condescended to make no sort of recognition. And

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

then he threw the "odd day" in along with the "odd month"; much as a
child, who has broken his toy-horse, glues a bit of tail to the shortest
of the legs, and calls aloud on creation to admire his handiwork.

Nor is the difference between the Egyptian and the alien treatment of
the kalendar accidental or unimportant. On the contrary, it suggests the
key to its use in the ancient country, as the great politico-religious
instrument whereby the social economy of the nation was co-ordinated
with theosophy of the priesthood. Among modern nations monotony of
recurrence seems to be the single object desired, so as to offer every
facility for the arrangements of business or pleasure, and to confine
within the strictest limits the diminutive period allotted to the life
to come. Any system therefore which breaks the regular routine, more
particularly if it be connected, as in ancient Egypt, with the
commemoration of sacred events, provokes impatience much

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

more than admiration. And the various adjustments of the kalendar appear
to be regarded as if they were odds and ends of time left littering
about the heavens by the sun and moon, and requiring an ingenious
astronomer—like Sosigenes—to fold together and put away tidily.

Very different from this narrow and ungracious spirit was the joyous
temper wherewith the Egyptian "Mystery-Teachers of the Heavens" regarded
those sacred intervals. Throughout the symbology of that country, life
was the centre, the circumference, the totality of good. Life was the
sceptre in the hand of Amen; life was the richest "gift of Osiris." "Be
not ungrateful to thy Creator," says the sage Ptah-Hotep, in what is
perhaps the oldest document in existence;" for he has given thee life."
"I am the Fount of Light," says the Creator in the Ritual. "I pierce the
darkness. I make clear the path for all; the Lord of Joy." By them

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

therefore the intervals were gratefully accepted as a kind of
breathing-space, wherein time, like the sun at the solstice, appears for
a while to rest, and man, like the immortals, might enjoy, without
impairing, the treasure of life. Accordingly the panegyric, or time of
praise, separating, or rather uniting year with year, took place not in
the gloom of winter as with us, but in the full height and glow of
summer; at the period at once of accomplishment and renovation, when the
sun was in his fullest strength, and the rising of the waters of the
Nile began to renew their life-giving floods. On the first day of the
sacred interval of continuous praise was celebrated the birth of Osiris,
the Lord of Light, Prime Mover of Creation. On the second, Horus; God,
of God; Light, of Light; the eldest of creation, to use the expression
of the Egyptian Ritual. On the third, Seb, Creator-Spirit of earth. On
the fourth, Isis, with her double relation of human and divine

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

motherhood. On the fifth, Neith, from whose divine personality gushed
the stream of life eternal, who "gave to every mummy the draught for
which he thirsted, that his soul might be separated from him no more for
ever." And on the sixth day was celebrated the feast of "Hep-Tep," the
crowning festival of Completion-Beginning.

Such was the symphony of light and joy which, for the Egyptian, preluded
the glowing year; and such also was its masonic expression, wherein was
struck the full diapason of lunar and solar, of terrestrial and
celestial, of temporal and of spiritual harmony. As the lunar Chamber of
New Birth, the Habitation of Isis, "the Mother of God" and the "Queen of
the Pyramid," was originally closed up, thus forming the trebly veiled
and most secret portion of the Hidden Places, so in the eastern
staircase of that chamber we seem to discover the most secret masonic
key, both to the astronomical form and the spiritual

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

signification—the exterior and the interior light. For in its fivefold
gradation we have the correlation of the lunar motion with the sun, in
the five degrees of the moon's ascent and descent each month from the
ecliptic. Again, since the sacred quarter of a day whereby the earth's
rotation was harmonized with its revolution exceeds the true period by
(very nearly) twelve minutes; so in five years does that annual excess
make up (5 × 12 =) 60 minutes, the lunar measure of the hour. And thus
we read in the Ritual of the "Chamber of the Hour in Rusta," the
territory both

<span id="img_13100"></span> ![Thrones of Isis and
Osiris.](img/13100.jpg.md)  
Thrones of Isis and Osiris.

of death and birth. In the same staircase, around the niche or "type,"
wherein the regenerate soul is formed—the image of the Queen of the
Pyramid—we have the fivefold regeneration of the senses; and in it too
we may recognize, in such a form

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

as to preserve but not to betray this trebly hidden masonic key, the
double throne of Isis and Osiris, pointing not improbably to a yet more
secret staircase within.

Even this does not exhaust the fulness of this prolific symbol; but it
gives a clue beyond its own immediate recess, and connects the Chamber
of New Birth with the luni-solar Chamber of the Orbit, just as the New
Birth itself connects Rusta with Aahlu; the place of Initiation with
that of Illumination. For in the same ascent in the Chamber of Divine
Birth, we have the five divine birthdays, which make up the sacred
interval of the solar year. Immediately above is the great throne,
crowning the lunar chamber, and masonically expressing the Egyptian
"Hep-Tep," or crowning festival of completion-beginning; as the chamber
which it surmounts represents the territory of both Death and Birth—the
"Completion-Beginning" of mortal Immortality. By the over-lappings

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

of the roof are formed thirty-six rays or indentations, marking the
thirty-six decades of the luni-solar orbit. The Southern wall, impending
about one degree North, points to the Northern boundary of the zodiacal
belt; the lower line of overlapping wall to its Southern boundary, and
between are the seven planetary spaces, with the groove of the
luni-solar orbit running down the space corresponding to that of the
earth.

Still further illustrations of the relations between our planet and her
luminous assistant, as together they describe the doubly-ruled Orbit of
Light, are to be found in this extraordinary Chamber of the Splendour.
As the wall points secretly to the Northern, and the inclined floor to
the Southern boundary of the Burning Circle of the Zodiac (about 89° and
152° of North Polar Distance) respectively; so does the inclination of
the roof to the level passage (about 28° 30´) secretly define the
limiting inclination of the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

lunar orbit (about 28° 30´) to the sacred plane of equinox. And the
fifty-six ramp-stones, twenty-eight on either side of the gallery, give
masonic expression to the fifty-six alternations of light and darkness
which take place approximately in the period of the moon's rotation,
twenty-eight of the ascent and twenty-eight of descent; the double
position of the stones, partly horizontal, partly sloping, corresponding
with the double attraction of the moon to the earth and the sun; and the
holes in their centres, with the crosses marked above them, indicating
the lunar transits over the Grand Meridian of the House of Osiris.

 

Recurring once more to the Kalendar, it is evident that a system
combining so wonderful a harmony with such perfect simplicity could
never have been constructed without some definite starting-point in
time, a Grand Epoch absolutely defined by some singular conjunction

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

of the heavenly bodies, and occurring only after long and clearly
measured intervals. Such an interval is afforded by the famous Cycle of
Sothis, of high antiquity in Egypt, and peculiar to that country, the
principle of which, being dependent upon the relative rates of the
earth's rotation and revolution respectively, has by no means been
always thoroughly understood. <span id="fr_21"></span>[\*](#fn_21.md)

Since the average interval between two successive risings of a given
star at a particular place is determined only by the period of the
earth's rotation, whereas in the case of the sun a period of about four
minutes must be added, on account of the motion of revolution in her
orbit during that period, it follows, as we have seen, that the star
will on the average rise at that place about four minutes earlier every
day, making the round of the twenty-four

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

hours every year. Consequently there will be in each year one day when
that star will rise at that place "heliacally," that is to say, just so
long before the dawn as to be visible for a few moments on the horizon
before vanishing in the increasing splendour. The position of the star
relatively to the earth and sun at the moment of heliacal rising we may
call its orient; and when the position is such as to coincide with the
summer solstice, we may express that position as the Grand Orient of the
star. Now the number of degrees by which the sun is below the horizon
when the heliacal rising of a star takes place, is not fully determined,
and varies to some extent with the locality; but ten degrees below is
usually taken as the sun's position when the star is lost in dawn, so
that the time would be about forty minutes before full sunrise. Let us
consider now the interval between two such risings of some particular
star; and for that purpose let us choose, like the

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Egyptians, Sirius
or Sothis, the most brilliant of the distant suns, the flaming sentinel
to us of the fiery hosts of space. Suppose, then, that on some
particular day (such as that of summer solstice) Sothis is on the
horizon of Memphis when the sun is eleven degrees below it, that is, one
degree below the point of dawn. On that day Sothis will rise heliacally,
and will remain visible on the horizon for about four minutes (while the
earth rotates through one degree), after which it will be lost in the
break of dawn. On the anniversary of that day it will again be on the
horizon, when the earth completes her 365th rotation; that is, when our
planet is a quarter of a degree less advanced in the orbit, since the
full revolution takes 365¼ rotations. Hence, since the earth *rotates*
through a quarter of a degree in a minute (of time), there will be the
difference of a minute in the corresponding rising each year, and
therefore of four minutes each grand cycle. But since

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

four minutes makes the difference of a day in the star's first
appearance, there will for every grand cycle be a difference of a day in
the heliacal rising of the star: and consequently in 4 × 365¼ (or 1461)
years the whole orbit will be traversed. That lovely cycle, with its
tetrachord of starry light just gleaming on the horizon and then
vanishing, lost in the growing splendour, appears from the allusions to
the dawn to have had its spiritual analogue in the festival of the
"Shapes," or divine forms of beauty; when the departed re-created in the
divine image rose gloriously from the grave, and shone for a while amid
the company of starry spirits, before merging his lustre, though not his
existence, in the splendour of the manifested Godhead.

From this highly important cycle we may draw some conclusion as to the
grand epoch of the Egyptian Kalendar; the date, that is to say, when
mere tradition came to an end, and systematic records, organized upon
astronomical

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

principles, began to be preserved. Since in the course of the cycle, the
heliacal risings take place on each day of the entire year, they will
run during the first half of the cycle in one direction (relatively to
the earth's orbit) and in the latter half in the opposite. And since
there is also a corresponding series of settings, subject to a similar
change of direction, the two series would in each cycle make up a double
reversal, interchanging positions not once but twice. When therefore
Herodotus tells us in a well-known passage (Euterp. 143), how, according
to the Egyptian records, the risings and settings had been out of their
orders four times since their reckoning commenced; "the risings twice
taking the place of the settings, and the settings twice taking the
place of the risings," the meaning becomes perfectly clear if referred
(as Rawlinson suggests) to the heliacal risings and settings of Sothis,
the determinator of the Kalendar. And the very circumstance

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

that Herodotus himself in all probability did not understand—and was not
intended to understand—the drift of the extract, strongly favours its
authenticity; since it is very difficult to conceive that a person,
ignorant of astronomy, should so misrepresent a statement made to him by
astronomers, as to blunder by accident into the correct exposition of a
different astronomical relation. We learn therefore that two Sothiac
cycles (four reversals) had been completed since the institution of the
scientific Kalendar; so that the cycle then current would be the third.
And as there is evidence that that cycle was completed in A.D. 139, and
therefore commenced in B.C. 1322, we conclude that the commencement of
the first Sothiac cycle and the institution of the scientific Kalendar
took place (2 x 1461 years previously, *i.e.*) at the summer solstice of
B.C. 4244; the moment of commencement being marked by the heliacal
rising of Sothis. In chapter lxiv., which describes

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

the new birth of the soul, and thus supplies the key to the whole creed,
or in its own words gives "The Entrance on Light in one Chapter," a
passage occurs which appears to refer to this dawning of another age.
"The twenty-four are passing," it says, "until the sixth. He remains in
the Gate." In the sixth hour that is to say, reckoning from midnight (as
Professor Renouf has shown to have been the custom), the march of the
stars is stayed, and the sun enters the Gate of a new cycle; in the same
way as for the regenerate soul the night is past, and he enters the Gate
of Everlasting Day.

That the date in question was the true epoch of the institution of the
Kalendar, to which all astronomical allusions are to be primarily
referred whether in the Ritual or in the Pyramid of Light, is confirmed
by a simple explanation which is thus afforded of a very marked
peculiarity (and apparent anomaly) in its use. As is well known, the

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "node" or point
where the earth at Equinox cuts the plane of the Equator, and
consequently the point of solstice (which is always 90° from that of
Equinox), is not invariable, but year after year falls a little short of
(or precedes) its previous position, so as to shift round in a direction
opposite to the earth's revolution. And the rate at which that
precession takes place (about 50" per annum) is such as to carry the
node, or point of crossing, round the entire orbit in about twenty-six
thousand years. Now attention has been drawn by Dr. Brugsch, who has so
admirably illustrated the ancient kalendar, to the circumstance that
during the later dynasties, a double series of months was employed,
wherein, for instance, "The First of Thoth," that is, the first day of
the first month, is given in the time of Thothmes III. (about B.C. 1600)
both on the day corresponding to our 20th of July, and on the 27th of
August, and similarly with the rest; but he has not offered any

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

solution. Suppose now that in addition to the current date of the
solstice the archaic date was also preserved—a suggestion entirely in
agreement with Egyptian custom and mode of thought—that is to say, that
a record was kept of the day of the Grand Epoch on which the earth
arrived at the point in her orbit which she had reached when the
kalendar was defined, then the peculiarity could be explained. For since
the date of Equinox, and therefore of course of solstice, falls a little
earlier relatively to the orbit every year, the archaic date will fall a
little later. And as in twenty-six thousand years it traverses the
circle of the year, and falls again on the anniversary; in two thousand
six hundred and fifty years the archaic date would be thirty-seven or
thirty-eight days later; so that if the kalendar were founded at the
epoch assigned, the difference between the current and the archaic date
in the days of Thothmes III. would just correspond to the difference
which

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

we find. Again, at the commencement of the third Sothiac cycle, in B.C.
1322, the archaic date would be later still, on the 29th or 30th of
August. And this appears to have been adopted in the later times as the
fixed archaic date, without further variation in the Alexandrine
Kalendar.

By a similar reference to the archaic date, we may throw some light on
the peculiar sanctity attaching to certain days of the month, for which
it is otherwise difficult to account. For instance, in the Kalendars of
the third Sothiac cycle, the fifteenth and the sixth of the month appear
to be particularly sacred; and in the Turin papyrus of the "Book of the
Dead" (the allusions in which would probably not go back so far as the
first cycle, but might refer either to the second or third), command is
given no less than three times that the most important festival of the
year, the Birthday of Osiris, should be celebrated on the fifteenth of
the month. But the Birthday of

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Osiris was, as we
have seen, the first festival of the New Year, and what connection could
such a day have with any particular day of any month whatever? A very
close connection if the archaic date is to be taken into consideration.
At the commencement of the second Sothiac cycle the archaic date of
Osiris's Birthday would fall twenty or twenty-one days later than at the
foundation of the kalendar; and, remembering the five days for the
sacred interval, we reach the fifteenth day of the first month; while a
similar calculation, allowing in all forty-one days, brings us in the
third Sothiac cycle to the sixth of the succeeding month. For a similar
reason another great festival, that of the Bark of Ra, is ordered to be
celebrated on the Birthday of Osiris, since at the foundation of the
Kalendar that day coincided with the rising of the sacred Nile, the
waters of which represent new life.

Hence, in order to preserve a true record of time, it is necessary to
note the motion of the

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

earth with reference to four, and only four, different standards; that
is to say, in regard to the stars, to the moon, to the sun, and to the
Equinox, the other relative motions of the earth having no perceptible
effect upon our reckoning of time. All these standards, with their
respective measures and harmonies, were known, as we have seen, to the
Egyptians; and this accounts for the circumstance which Dr. Brugsch has
remarked, that at a very early date the Kalendar of Egypt was kept upon
four different reckonings. All these standards also, each with its
spiritual signification corresponding with the Ritual, we have seen
expressed in the masonry of the Grand Pyramid. For to the architect of
the Egyptian Light, there was no celestial truth which was not
manifested in the motions of the celestial orbs; nor was there any
chamber among the Hidden Places of the Great House which did not
secretly reflect the path of the just in the mystery of the heavens.

<span id="fn_18"></span>[111:\*](hhp06.htm#fr_18.md) For most of the facts
here stated with regard to Egyptian astronomy I am indebted to the
invaluable researches of the late lamented Dr. Brugsch upon the
kalendar, as I am also to his history for quotations from the papyri,
and allusions to the customs of the country.

<span id="fn_19"></span>[113:\*](hhp06.htm#fr_19.md) It falls short by not
quite three (circular) minutes, or rather less than a seven-thousandth
part of the circumference.

<span id="fn_20"></span>[114:\*](hhp06.htm#fr_20.md) The word "rotation" is
always applied in this work to the motion of a body about its own axis;
"revolution," to its motion around another body.
