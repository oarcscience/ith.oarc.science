WE cannot think of a time when Man had not asked, Where am I? Nor, when
he had arrived at an explanation, that it was not set forth by
representation; not a definition in a book, or by carefully chosen
speech, but dramatically by that *parler aux yeux* which is an
increasing factor in speech as you go backwards in the history of
intelligent communication.

If we remember that 'old means not old in chronology, but in structure:
that is most archaic which lies nearest to the beginning of human
progress considered as a development,' we may roughly put as the
beginning of graphic and descriptive astronomy the dance and the story.
The dance, on the one hand, becomes a part of ritual, and the story
passes into mythology.

Every key applied to custom and mythology unlocks some of their secrets;
and Mr Max Müller, Mr Andrew Lang, and Dr Tylor are certainly agreed
that to a large extent what is now mythology was

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

once an explanation of nature. In this view the Odyssey itself is an old
and artistic geography, and the stories of Hercules, Theseus, and Jason,
astronomy for the young.

We ought at this point to examine rites and ceremonies, savage dances,
priestly observance, courtly ceremony, and the pomp of war, the great
festivals and games; and in all these things we should find that man,
after a certain stage was reached, was ever trying to conform himself to
the ritual of nature, so that, like it in some respects, he might share
its power and permanence.

But ritual is too wide a subject merely to glance at; we must limit
ourselves to things made, or poets’ views of how they should be made. In
these the tendency has been universal to embody the natural order: not a
plan of the world for science, but as a religious mystery and symbol; as
magic amulet, charm, fetish.

Such was the shield of Achilles; and Mr Gladstone, so well is this
understood, bases his inquiry as to the Homeric Geography on the
description in the Iliad of this work of Hephæstos, the fabricator God.
'On it he formed earth, sky, and sea, the unwearied sun, full moon, and
all the signs with which the sky is crowned—Pleiades, Hyads, the might
of Orion, and the Bear (which men also call the Wain), it turns there
and watches Orion, nor dips it into ocean.' And so on with the whole
lovely description comprising the entire Cosmos.

1\. The sun, moon, and revolving signs of the heavens.

2\. The earth, two cities—one at peace, the other at war; the life of
the fields in the round of the year; ploughing, reaping and the vintage,
herding of cattle and sheep folds.

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

3\. The dancing place that Dædalus built for fair-haired Ariadne, where
they imitated in the circling dance the tortuous way of the labyrinth—a
hint on the shield of the under-world.

4\. Ocean which flowed round the world beside the outer edge of the
thick-made shield.

This making the shield a map of things celestial is followed by Æschylus
in the 'Seven against Thebes.' Before the first gate Tydeus bore a
shield—

'With this proud argument. A sable sky  
 Burning with stars; and in the midst full orbed  
 A silver moon, the eye of night . . . . '

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> And Nonnos gives
Bacchus a shield blazoned with the whole celestial system (*Dupuis*).

In Temple pageantry the sky was often represented by a veil or mantle of
purple tissue scintillating with stars, either robing the God, hung
before the sanctuary, or covering artificial erections, *Asherim*, 'The
Groves' of Scripture.

Lenormant in his '*Origines*,' remarking that a winged oak with a veil
thrown over it, 'the tree and the peplos,' was the image by which the
Phœnicians figured the universe, citing Pausanias for an actual temple
veil of this kind at Gabala in Syria; quotes from Nonnos the description
of Harmonia weaving the magnificent web patterned with the images of the
whole natural order:—

'Bent over Athene's cunning loom, Harmonia wove a peplos with the
shuttle; in the stuff which she wove, she first represented the earth
with its *omphalos* in the centre; around the earth she spread out the
sphere of heaven, varied by the figures of the stars. She harmoniously
accompanied the earth with the sea that is associated with it, and she
painted thereon the rivers, under their image of bulls with men's faces

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

furnished with horns. Lastly, all along the exterior edge of the
well-woven vestment she represented the ocean in a circle enveloping the
Universe in its course.'

Josephus states that the veil of Herod's temple was blue, scarlet,
white, and purple, embroidered with the constellations of heaven.

The well-known practice of renewing these temple veils yearly agrees
with their astronomical significance. The annual procession with the new
covering to the Caaba at Mecca, still continues this practice.

              '. . . . . . Which of the deities  
Shall we have as a patron? We must weave our mantle,  
Our sacred mantle of course. . . . The yearly mantle  
To one or other of them.'       —ARISTOPHANES, Birds.

When the world was a tree, every tree was in some sort its
representation; when a tent or a building, every tent or building: but
when the relation was firmly established, there was action and reaction
between the symbol and the reality, and ideas taken from one were
transferred to the other, until the symbolism became complicated, and
only particular buildings would be selected for the symbolic purpose:
certain forms were reasoned from the building to the world, and
conversely certain thoughts of the universe were expressed in the
structure thus set apart as a little world for the House of God—a
Temple.

To the Teutonic nations trees were the first temples, as resembling the
universe tree, the shelter of the gods: with them, according to Grimm,
temple and tree were convertible words.

Pliny says 'trees were the first temples; even at this day the simple
rustic of ancient custom dedicates his noblest tree to God;' and in
'Outlines of Primitive Belief' (Keary) it is said, 'Certain it is that,
among

<span id="page_36">p. 36</span>

people who live in woody lands, we find long continuing the habit of
using a tree trunk for the main pillar of the house, of building
circular walls round that tree, and sloping the roof down to them from
it. Of such kind was the house of our Northern ancestors. . . . All this
is mere prosaic fact, but soon we pass on to the region of belief and
mythology. The Norsman on the image of his own house fashioned his
picture of the entire world. The earth with the heaven for a roof, was
to him but a mighty chamber, and likewise had its great supporting tree,
passing through the midst and branching far upwards among the clouds.'
The general accuracy of this view would seem to be confirmed by the
Japanese story given by Sir H. Reid, in which the first home of newly
created man was built round the heavenly spear, which formed at once its
roof tree and the world axis.

 

Berosos describes the paintings in the Temple of Belus at Babylon;
chaotic rather than cosmic it may be said, but having not any the less a
direct reference to the framing of the world:—'There was a time when all
was water and darkness, in which monstrous animals were spontaneously
engendered: men with two wings, and some with four; with two faces and
two heads, the one male and the other female, and with the other
features of both sexes united in their single bodies; men with the legs
and horns of a goat and the feet of a horse; others with the hind
quarters of a horse and the other part a man like the hippo-centaurs.
There were also bulls with human heads, dogs with four bodies and
fishes’ tails, and other quadrupeds, in which various animal forms were
blended, fishes, reptiles, serpents, and all kinds of monsters with the
greatest variety in their forms,

<span id="page_37">p. 37</span>

monsters whose images we see in the paintings of the temple of Bel at
Babylon.'

These composite figures, says Perrot, 'were not a caprice of the artists
who made them, but were suggested by a cosmic theory of which they
formed, as it were, a plastic embodiment and illustration.' The
description of the abominations done in Jerusalem (Ezekiel viii. 10, 11)
is a close parallel and confirmation.

Other descriptions of Babylonian temples lead us to see a cosmical
symbolism in their structure; that by Apollonius is quoted in a later
chapter, and another in an Arab translation of the Nabathean
agriculture, relates how the images of the gods throughout the world
betook themselves to Babylon, to the temple of the sun, 'to the great
golden image suspended between heaven and earth. The sun image stood,
they say, in the midst of the temple surrounded by all the images of the
world; next to it stood the images of the sun in all countries; then
those of the moon; next those of Mars; after them the images of Mercury;
then those of Jupiter; after them those of Venus; and last of all, of
Saturn.' (Baring Gould, 'Curious Myths.') This was evidently a temple
with a dome like the firmament, from which golden sun and planets were
suspended, and agrees entirely with the account by Apollonius.

But the buildings of Babylon and their more or less lineal descendants
in Persia, all of well-defined planetary symbolism, are considered in
later chapter's, so we will pass them for the present with just an
extract from that old mine, Maurice's 'Antiquities of India:'—

'Porphyry states that the Mithraic caverns represented the world.
According to Eubulus, Zoroaster first of all, among the neighbouring
mountains of Persia, consecrated a natural cell, adorned with

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

flowers and watered with fountains, in honour of Mithra, the father of
the universe. For he thought a cavern an emblem of the world fabricated
by Mithra; and in this cave were many geographical symbols arranged with
the most perfect symmetry and at certain distances, which shadowed out
the elements and climates of the world.'

'In Persia's hallowed caves the Lord of Day  
 Pours through the central gloom his fervid ray;  
 High wrought in burnished gold the Zodiac shines,  
 And Mithra toils through all the blazing signs.'  
                                               —STATIUS.

Not to elaborate an interpretation of the Pyramids, which have already
had far too many ingenious theories built with their silent stones, and
it is better to keep clear of conjecture lest the whole argument becomes
a sort of pyramid-inverted. Can we believe that the greatest works ever
accomplished by man, with infinite toil and laborious accuracy, in an
age when almost every act had a religious significance and a mystical
reason, carried no symbol—had no thought and message embodied in their
design? And this in a tomb the dwelling of no mere man, but the Pharaoh,
son of Ra the Sun. Moreover, there is hardly a sepulchral tablet but has
expanded on its top edge the sign of the sky, at times painted blue and
dotted with stars. Mr R. Proctor thinks it proved that they had an
astrological significance in addition to their use as tombs.

According to Brugsch, the Sun temple at Heliopolis had a sacred sealed
chamber in form of a *pyramid*, called 'Ben-Ben,' in which were kept the
two barks of the sun; an inscription gives an account of the visit of a
king:—'The arrangement of the *House of Stars* was completed, the
fillets were put on, he was purified with balsam and holy water, and the
flowers

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

were presented to him for the house of the obelisk. He took the flowers,
and ascended the stairs to the great window to look upon the Sun god Ra
in the house of the obelisk. Thus the king himself stood there. The
prince was alone. He drew back the bolt and opened the doors, and beheld
his father Ra in the exalted house of the obelisk, and the morning bark
of Ra, and the evening bark of Turn. The doors were then shut, the
sealing clay was laid on, and the King himself impressed his seal.'

The imagery of the temples and many inscriptions make clear that their
intention was to localise their great prototype, the temple of the
heavens. The dedicator of an inscription speaks thus of the temple of
Neith, the mother of the Sun god Ra: 'Moreover, I informed him
(Cambyses) also of the high consequence of the habitation of Neith; it
is such as a heaven in all its quarters ('a heaven in its whole plan,'
Renouf translates). . . . Moreover, of the high importance of the south
chamber, and of the north chamber, of the chamber of the morning Sun Ra,
and of the chamber of the evening Sun Turn. These are the mysterious
places of all the gods' (Brugsch).

Maspero in his recent book 'Egyptian Archæology' considers at length the
constructive and decorative symbolism of the Egyptian temple. 'The
temple was built in the likeness of the world, as the world was known to
the Egyptians. The earth, as they believed, was a flat and shallow
plane, longer than its width; the sky, according to some, extended
overhead like an immense iron ceiling, and, according to others, like a
shallow vault, As it could not remain suspended in space, without some
support, they imagined it to be held in place by four immense

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

props or pillars. The floor of the temple naturally represented the
earth. The columns, and if needful, the four corners of the chambers
stood for the pillars. The roof vaulted at Abydos, flat elsewhere,
corresponded exactly with the Egyptian idea of the sky. Each of these
parts was therefore decorated in consonance with its meaning; those next
to the ground were clothed with vegetation. The bases of the columns
were surrounded by leaves, and the lower part of the walls were adorned
with long stems of lotos or papyrus, in the midst of which animals were
occasionally depicted. Bouquets of water plants, emerging from the
water, enliven the bottom of the wall space in certain chambers.
Elsewhere we find full-blown flowers interspersed with buds or tied
together with cords. . . . The ceiling was painted blue, and spangled
with five pointed stars painted yellow, occasionally interspersed with
the cartouches of the royal founder. The vultures of Nekheb and Uati,
the [goddesses](errata.htm#0.md) of the south and north, crowned and armed
with divine emblems, hovered above the central nave of the hypostyle
halls and on the underside of the lintels of the front doors, above the
head of the Great King as he passed through on his way to the
sanctuary.'

'At the Ramessium, at Edfou, at Philæ, at Denderah, at Ombos, at Esnah,
the depths of the firmament seemed to open to the eyes of the faithful,
revealing the dwellers therein. There the celestial ocean poured forth
its floods, navigated by the sun and moon, with their attendant escort
of planets, constellations, and decans; there also the genii of the
months and days passed in long procession. In the Ptolemaic age zodiacs
fashioned after Greek models were sculptured side by side with
astronomical tables of purely native origin. Finally, the decoration of

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

the lowest part of the walls and of the ceiling were restricted to a
small number of subjects, which were always similar, the most important
and varied scenes being suspended as it were between earth and heaven on
the sides of the chambers and the Pylons. These scenes illustrated the
official relations which subsisted between Egypt and the gods. . . . The
sun, travelling from east to west, divided the universe into two
worlds—the world of the north and the world of the south. The Temple,
like the universe, was double, and an imaginary line, passing through
the axis of the sanctuary, divided it into two temples—the temple of the
south on the right hand, and the temple of the north on the left. Each
chamber was divided, in imitation of the temple, into two halves.'

 

To pass to the Semitic peoples. Philo Judæus states that the Temple of
Solomon was built in imitation of the world fabric, and Josephus gives
the same explanation of the symbolism of the Tabernacle. It has been
seen in the first chapter how the Tabernacle was the pattern of the
universe in small to the early Christian Fathers; and the text of the
Psalms would seem to prove that this was the Psalmist's own view: 'And
he built his sanctuary like high (palaces), like the earth, which he
hath established for ever' (Ps. lviii.).

Often it is not so much the actual earth and visible heavens that were
symbolised, as the original celestial world of the golden age—Paradise;
but a real, substantial, and geographical Paradise.

Of the Caaba of Mecca—an early Arab temple still preserved in continued
use—the story is told, that after Adam and Eve were cast out of
Paradise, they came together again near to Mecca. Adam prayed for a
shrine 'similar to that at which he had worshipped when in Paradise. The
supplication of Adam was

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

effectual. A tabernacle or temple, formed of radiant clouds, was lowered
down by the hands of angels, and placed immediately below its prototype
in the celestial paradise. Towards the heaven-descended shrine Adam
thenceforth turned in prayer, and round it he daily made seven circuits,
in imitation of the rites of the adoring angels.' So much for the
symbolism of the Caaba—'the Cube'—of Mecca. Other allied Semitic
structures, the small buildings found by Renan in Syria, have this
cubical form. So also have later buildings of Roman date, described by
Count de Vogüé as 'Kalybes': these are surmounted by cupolas. This
accomplished archæologist says: 'The cube is essentially a mystical
form, which is found in the cellæ of Egyptian temples and that of
Jerusalem; the hemisphere is the image of the celestial vault. We know
that the cella of a temple was regarded as the dwelling of the god
represented by the statue—a mystic symbol, or an invisible oracle.
Originally the sacred edifice was the image of the celestial dwelling,
as the symbol which inhabited it was the image of the divine personage.
The Etruscan priest who built a sanctuary, traced above in the sky with
his wand the foundations which he re-produced on earth—he transported,
so to say, upon the earth a part of the sky to make a dwelling for his
God. This idea is found in all countries, although it may not be so
formally expressed' (*La Syrie Centrale*).

To the early European races, in the same way, 'the most magnificent
temple which the ancients imagined, and which preceded all their notions
of buildings made with hands, was the vault of Olympus, in which they
supposed the great Jove to reside.' More particularly was this symbolism
preserved in later time in the circular structures, the *Tholos* of
Hestia in Greece, and of Vesta in Rome: a form which is

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

allowed by the latest authorities to represent the heavenly vault.

Plutarch in 'Isis and Osiris' describes a temple of Vesta:—'Numa built a
temple of an orbicular form, for the preservation of the sacred fire;
intending by the fashion of the edifice to shadow out not so much the
earth, or Vesta considered in that character, as the whole universe, in
the centre of which the Pythagoreans placed fire, which they called
Vesta and Unity.' Ovid in the 'Fasti' gives the same explanation; the
temple represented the round earth, 'a reason for its figure worthy of
our approval.'

The great rotunda at Rome, the Pantheon, is, of course, the most superb
temple in this manner, 143 feet in diameter, with a simple aperture in
the dome thirty feet across, through which streams the great beam of the
sun. The height to the zenith, from the floor, is equal to the diameter,
so that it would just contain a sphere. Of this vast domed expanse,
Pliny says, 'quod forma ejus convexa fastigiatum cæli similitudinem
ostenderet.' It has been suggested for the plan, a circle with eight
great niches, one of which is occupied by the door to the north, that
the south niche was intended to be occupied by Phœbus Apollo, and the
rest by the Moon and five other planets—Diana, Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, and Saturn.

The ancient Latin custom at the foundation of sacred buildings, in
relating them to the heavens, is thus described: 'Templum is the same
word as the Greek temenos; for the templum, according to Servius, was
any place which was circumscribed and separated by the augurs from the
rest of the land by a certain solemn formula. A place thus set apart and
hallowed by the augurs was always intended to serve religious purposes,
but chiefly for taking the auguria. The place in the heavens within
which the observations were

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

to be made was likewise called templum, as it was marked out and
separated from the rest by the staff of the augur. When the augur had
defined the *templum* within which he intended to make his observations,
he fixed his tent (*tabernaculum*), in it, and this tent was likewise
called templum or, more accurately, *templum minus*' (Dr Smith's Dict.).

The Druids had, as a rite, yearly to pull down and rebuild the roof of
their temple, 'as a symbol of the destruction and renovation of the
world.' The yearly veil, or the rekindled fire, is a much less serious
form of the renewal, type and guarantee of the world's continuance.

The poets and romance writers have preserved the tradition of buildings
like the world temple even to the Renaissance; the central temple in the
*Hypnerotomachia* is circular, with a dome from which hangs one great
orbicular lamp; and the town and temple in Campanella's 'Civitas Solis'
is elaborately symbolical. The town was divided into seven great rings
named from the seven planets, with four main streets and gateways
looking to the points of the compass; the temple in the centre was also
circular, and domed. Above the altar, a large globe represented the
earth; on the dome were all the stars of heaven from the first to the
sixth magnitude, with their names and influences marked, and the
meridians and great circles in relation to the altar. The pavement was
of precious stones. Seven golden, ever-burning lamps bore the names of
the seven planets. Louis XIV. seems to have tried to realise something
of this sort at Marley; and according to Mr H. Melville, 'Royal Arch
Mason,' in a book entitled 'Veritas,' even the modern ritual of Masonic
Lodges is cosmical.

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

But we have not done with the East and the beginning of history. 'It has
ever been accepted as a physical axiom in China that heaven is round and
earth is square; and among the relics of Nature worship of old we find
the altar of heaven at Pekin round, while the altar of earth is square.'
The former is described farther on in Chapter VI. According to Professor
Legge, it dates from the twelfth century B.C., and is thus primitive
Chinese before Confucius. 'The sovereigns of the Chan dynasty (1152-250
B.C.) worshipped in a building which they called the Hall of Light,
which also served the purpose of an audience and council chamber. It was
112 feet square, and surmounted by a dome typical of heaven above and
earth beneath' (Giles’ 'Historic China').

In the old Chinese book the Li-Ki (Sacred Books of the East) there is a
long account of the 'Hall of Distinction,' accompanied by a native plan.
In it the Emperor as 'Son of Heaven' has to go through an elaborate
solar ritual, passing from room to room as the sun passes into the
several solar mansions. A large square enclosure surrounds the whole,
with four ceremonial gateways (*Pailoos*) opening to the cardinal
points. The building is perfectly square, and divided into three each
way, making in all nine apartments, the middle one being called the hall
of the centre. The exterior wall of each apartment—three facing each of
the four quarters of the heavens—is dedicated to one of the months, the
angle rooms being named twice over. The 'hall of the centre' is only
occupied for a time between the sixth and seventh month. The 'Son of
Heaven’s' progress is also marked by dress and symbolism appropriate to
the season.

If we compare this with the Buddhist plan of the world given in Bock's
'Siam,' the reproduction of the pattern of the world will be apparent.
The diagram

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

of the twelve heavenly houses used by astrologers is very similar (see
[figures](#img_fig01).md).

The first emperor of United China in the third century B.C.—a Caligula
for cruelty, a Nero for splendour—is said in Chinese history to have
built a gorgeous country palace. 'The most remarkable feature of the
whole was the plan on which it was arranged. The various edifices were
so disposed as to correspond with and otherwise represent that part of
the heavens which lies between the North Star, the Milky Way, and the
Constellation Aquila, the vacant spaces being denoted by courts,
corridors, and winding paths. This, it is said, was partly intended as
an acknowledgment of the benign celestial influences to which the
emperor ascribed the brilliant success that had always attended him, and
partly as a monument of the vastness of his dominions, which could only
be symbolised by an imitation of the starry vault on high' (Balfour,
'Chinese Scrap Book'.)

Sir W. Chambers, in his account of Chinese gardens, with their
summer-houses and pavilions, says: 'Some of these are called *Mian
Ting*, or Halls of the Moon, being of prodigious size, and composed each
of a vaulted room made in the shape of a hemisphere, the

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

concave of which is artfully painted in imitation of a nocturnal sky,
and pierced with an infinite number of little windows, made to represent
the moon and stars, being filled with tinted glass that admits the light
in the quantities necessary to spread over the whole interior fabric the
pleasing gloom of a fine summer's night. The pavements of these rooms
are sometimes laid out in parterres of flowers; but oftenest the bottom
is full of clear running water, which falls in rills from the sides of a
rock in the centre; many little islands float upon its surface, and move
around as the current directs, some of them covered with tables for the
banquet, seats, and other objects.'

Of the Taouist temples, Dr Edkins tells us: 'The endeavour is made in
these to represent the gods of the religion in their celestial abodes
seated on their thrones.' In India the rock-cut caves of Ellora are said
to be complete representations of the paradise of Siva; the great props
left to support the roof are called 'Sumeru,' after the sky-supporting
mountain, the 'Beautiful Meru.'

The Buddhist Stupas or Topes—those nearly solid masses of the form of a
bubble floating on water, as an old author has it, or of a bell on a
platform, surmounted by umbrella-shaped canopies—would more properly,
perhaps, be classed with the solid structures of Babylon and Mexico in
Chapter VI., as representing the heavenly regions from without as the
mount of heaven, instead of from within, as a dwelling for deity. Asoka,
according to the legend, had eighty-four thousand constructed
simultaneously: on them every splendour was lavished—gilding, great
glass jewels, golden bells; statues of elephants with real tusks guarded
the enclosures, and at festivals they were buried in a profusion of
flowers. Fa-Hian speaks of one as 700 feet high; but some were only a
foot or

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

two in diameter. Mr A. Lillie, in his 'Buddhism in Christendom,' gives a
diagram of a stupa representing the successive zones of the heavens.
Professor Beal in the 'Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society,' vol. V.,
states that the great tope at Sanchi represents heaven and earth, and
points out how even the curious Buddhist railing, which surrounds some
of these structures,

<span id="img_fig02"></span>

[![Figure 2. A Buddhist Tope (Stupa)](tn/fig02.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/fig02.jpg.md)  
  

is of a chessboard pattern, as the enclosing walls of Paradise are
described to be; the four great gates in these enclosures are called
Torana, which means an ornamental gate or door to the abode of the
celestials.

The same author in his little book on Chinese Buddhism remarks: 'Whether
it be true or not that a simple idea underlies all rightly-directed
efforts of man to raise a building fit for the worship of God,

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

in this particular Buddhism illustrates the supposed rule. The symbolism
of the tope or stupa from the crowning spire of which the (Chinese)
*pagoda* originates, is, like that of all other sacred edifices,
intended to figure out an idea of the world or universe ruled over or
occupied by one supreme Spirit or Being. This certainly was the meaning
of the figure and furniture of the Jewish tabernacle and of the temple.
As Josephus says in his 'Antiquities,' Solomon rose up and said, 'O
Lord! Thou hast an eternal house, and such as Thou hast created for
Thyself out of Thine own work, we know it to be the heaven, and the air,
and the earth, and the sea:' it was a symbol of this that Solomon built,
so Philo tells us, and Cosmas labours at length to show the same thing.
The stupa is a high solid structure based on a square foundation or
platform, from which rises into the air a semicircular dome, which is
crowned by a square railing, or sometimes a solid cube with eyes on
every side. The square platform represents earth, the semicircular dome
figures out the air, the railed structure on the top denotes the heaven,
where watch the four gods (indicated by eyes). This was the first great
effort to describe in stone the idea of the world, or the three worlds,
over which the supreme presence of Buddha was supposed to rule; in this
stupa were his relics denoting his presence, the only authorised
substitute for himself. As the system grew the idea of the universe
expanded also, and it was not only earth and air and heaven that had to
be represented, but the towering worlds above the heaven, and after that
the platforms or plateaux (it is the only word we can use) of heavens
extending upwards and towards the eight points of space; hence the
symbolism expanded also, and above the cubical structure was erected a
high staff with rings or

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

umbrellas to denote world soaring above world to the uppermost empyrean.
Now it is this crowning pole with its rings or umbrellas that originated
the idea of the pagoda. Each platform in this structure denotes a world;
as they tower upwards in beautifully decreasing size, they offer to the
eye an effort of the mind of man to represent the idea of the infinite.
On each side of these platforms there are bells and tinkling copper
leaves to denote the eternal 'music of the spheres,' and the beautifully
carved balustrades and projecting eaves are ever described as proper
emblems of the happy beings who enjoy the presence of the Buddhas
dwelling in these supreme regions. This is the origin of the pagodas,
and there is nothing which gives China its distinctive architectural
character so much as these Buddhist structures not used for worship, but
to figure out the illimitable nature of the space in which dwells the
spiritual essence of all the Buddhas' (Beal).

In the modern Chinese ritual of Buddhism Dr Edkins says, 'Kan (heaven)
is the covering let down over an idol, as in the phrase Fo-Kan (a shrine
for Buddha), and it here represents the sky as a canopy stretched over
the world. Yu (the earth) is the chariot in which the idol sits.' The
tooth of Buddha in Ceylon is preserved under nine of these bell-shaped
gold and jewelled canopies representing the nine heavens. Buddhist bells
in China and Japan are usually ornamented with meridian lines, the sun,
and the stars.

In China the tombstones are often the well-known composite symbol
consisting of a cube as a base, on it a sphere, then a cone, a crescent,
and an inverted pear-shaped apex; on each of the solids are characters
signifying earth, air, fire, water, and ether, in the order in which the
elements were supposed to be

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

superimposed. And even the coinage, circular with a square hole, is
well-understood as symbolising heaven and earth.

 

In Christian architecture it is still said at times that the nave and
the chancel, divided by the screen, symbolise earth and heaven; and
Curzon gives it as the acknowledged significance of the Byzantine
Churches with the Berna shut off by the Iconastasis.

Didron tells us that the two or three thousand sculptures of one of the
greater French cathedrals of the thirteenth century are stone
encyclopædias comprising nature, science, ethics, and history. 'These
sculptures, then, are, in the fullest sense of the word, what in the
language of the Middle Ages was called the "Image or Mirror of the
Universe."' But it is rather the universe of religious ideas than the
actual solid built world. The Byzantine scheme preserved more of the
original thought: Christ was enthroned at the zenith of the central
dome, then zone below zone, were the heavenly powers, the saints, and
all. nature, one great chorus of praise.

A Byzantine church in Athens, the *Magale Panagia*, is described in
'Archæologia' (Vol. I., New Series), and photographs are given of the
paintings now destroyed. High in the centre of the dome is the Christ
enthroned, with His feet on the mystic wheels, the whole expanse being a
deep blue, next comes a series of nine semicircles containing
representations of the Orders of the Hierarchy—the Seraphim, the
Cherubim, the Thrones, the Dominions, the Virtues, the Powers, the
Principalities, the Archangels, the Angels—which respectively rule the
nine heavenly zones; the *primum mobile*, sphere of the fixed stars, and
the seven planets. Below these a belt circles the dome, blue of the
firmament, set all over with stars

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

and the twelve signs of the zodiac; to the east is the sun, and to the
west the moon; still below these on the walls are the winds, hail, and
snow; and still lower mountains, and trees, and the life on the earth,
and with all is interwoven passages from the last three Psalms:—

'O praise the Lord of heaven; praise Him in the height. Praise Him, all
ye angels of His; praise Him, all His host. Praise Him, sun and moon;
praise Him, all ye stars and light. Praise Him, all ye heavens; and ye
waters that are above the heavens. Let them praise the Name of the
Lord.'
