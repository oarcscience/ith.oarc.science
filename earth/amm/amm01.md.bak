### PREFACE

*IN sending out this essay, I must ask for indulgence.*

*In the first place, because this is, so far as known to me, the only
attempt to set out, from an architect's point of view, the basis of
certain ideas common in the architecture of many lands and religions,
the purposes behind structure and form which may be called the esoteric
principles of architecture.*

*And secondly, for an attempt to deal with a subject that could only be
rightly handled by one having the equipments of a wide scholarship;
while I can only claim that there should come of regular apprenticeship
and long practice in any craft or art, a certain instinct of insight not
possessed by mere outsiders though never so learned. The author who asks
the question quoted on the title page, says that Mr. Herbert Spencer's
essay on the origin of the styles of architecture fails because he was
not himself an architect, and no architect had prepared the way. I refer
to this in the*

*hope that writing thus, on my own art, may be sufficient excuse for any
appearance of affectation and presumption in quoting unfamiliar matter
at second hand; for I must say at once, what will be sufficiently
apparent on any page, that my knowledge of books is only that of the
general reader, and that I have made use of such inferior editions,
translations, and chance extracts as have come in my way; venturing to
suppose that, if the thought were clear, a passage originally in
hieroglyphs, or on clay tablets, might be dealt with as readily as a
paragraph from an evening paper.*

*In such a wide field I have thought it well to concentrate my attention
on some few definite points, and I fear, in doing this, there may be
some unnecessary insistence and repetition: a tendency to overprove, and
an attempt to explain too much; on the one hand to burden with what is
obvious, on the other to weaken by unfounded conjecture.*

*The main proposition occurred to me after collecting and comparing a
large number of architectural legends, and it was not until I read
definitely, for further confirmation, that I found statements, a
sentence here and there, anticipating me on nearly every point. It is
only since this has been in the publishers’ hands that I have seen Dr.
Warren's 'Paradise Found,' to find there several coincidences with my
chapters IV. and V*.

*To clear the page of footnotes, and to strengthen the structure of the
argument by expert evidence, I have generally preferred to transcribe my
authorities directly rather than attempt, by paraphrasing them, to give
an air of ease and unity to my own work. Equally by either method—'Would
you know the new, you must search the old.'*

*I have the pleasure of thanking friends who have helped me, especially
Mr. Ernest Newton and Mr. E. S. Prior. The figures*

Brindley, Mr. Schultz, and Mr. Barnsley*.

'*The prince Humayun fitted up seven houses of entertainment, and named
them after the seven planets, ordering all the furniture, paintings, and
also the dresses of those who waited upon him, to bear something that
was an emblem, of the tutelar star of the house. In the house of the
Moon met foreign ambassadors, travellers, and poets. Military men
attended him in the house of Mars, and judges, lawgivers, and
secretaries were received in that of Mercury*.'
