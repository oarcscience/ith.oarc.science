### CHAPTER XII

### THE SYMBOL OF CREATION

'*They entered an apartment containing nothing except a black painting
representing a woman. Her legs reached to the top of one of the walls;
her body occupied the entire ceiling; from her navel hung suspended, by
a thread, an enormous egg; and the remainder of her body, her head
downward, descended the other wall, to the level of the pavement, where
her finger ends touched*,'—SALAMMBO.

THE late William Burges built for himself a house strange and
barbarously splendid: none more than he could be minutely intimate with
the thought of old art, or more saturated with a passion for colour,
sheen, and mystery. Here were silver and jade, onyx and malachite,
bronze and ivory, jewelled casements, rock crystal orbs, marble inlaid
with precious metals; lustre, iridescence and colour everywhere;
vermilion and black, gold and emerald; everywhere device and symbolism,
and a fusion of Eastern feeling with his style.

In his own bedroom the bed and other furniture is vermilion heightened
by crimson glazes. Over the mantle a syren combs her long gilt hair,
looking-glass in hand—the mirror no make-believe. The ceiling has red
beams crossing a black field studded with small convex mirrors, two
inches across, surrounded by gilt rays, the mirrors giving back the
candle-light like stars

<span id="page_255">p. 255</span>

in the midnight sky. The hangings are Eastern embroidery, and the
pictures Persian miniatures. The ceiling of the next room is even more
extraordinary and mysterious; it is divided into four squares by heavy
beams, at the middle point of which there is a convex mirror as large as
the moon: each of these squares is crossed by diagonal ribs of bright
flamingo red, and a circle is drawn around the points of intersection,
from which hang emus’ eggs—four in all—large, almond-shaped, and
matchless green. They vibrate as you enter the room.

Burges had been to Constantinople, and there a few years ago hung from
the dome of Sta. Sophia, 'the fairest and noblest church in the world,'
a light frame of iron, an octagon, perhaps some sixty feet across, with
radii and inner concentric lines; a vast spider's web, suspended, it
must have seemed—such is the immensity—from the very vault of heaven. On
this frame were artlessly hung an infinity of lamps, tiny glass vases of
oil with floating wicks. Here and again amongst them were suspended
ostrich eggs, all placed with no more precision than the lights and
oranges on a Christmas tree—long, short, straight and awry, and so near
the floor as to be almost under the sight of the reader of the
'perspicuous book,' as he ascended the high pulpit of the conquered
mosque with the law and a naked sabre, the alternatives of Islam.

It appears from photographs that vulgar gas lights have now taken the
place of the original lamp frame, but it is shown in the interior view
given in Texier and Pullan's book. These hanging eggs seem of universal
use in the East, alike in church, mosque, and tomb. Still at
Constantinople, the frames of lights in the mosque of Achmet are
decorated with globes of crystal and ostrich eggs. They are usually
stained in bright colours, and have small metal mounts at top and

<span id="page_256">p. 256</span>

bottom, with a pendant or tassel below. Such a frame carrying lamps and
eggs may be seen in the wonderful water colour by Lewis at South
Kensington.

The drawings of interiors of Arab mosques in Eber's 'Egypt' show, in a
number of instances, a long cord, an egg, and then the lamp. Sometimes
as many as a dozen are thus suspended here and there, or in a row from a
beam. As far up the Nile as Assouan, Miss Edwards describes a mosque as
'cool and clean and spacious, the floor being covered with matting, and
some scores of ostrich eggs depending from the ceiling.' In the Coptic
churches the custom is equally observed, as may be seen in Butler's
'Coptic Churches of Egypt,' from which the following extract is taken;
and it is interesting to note how such a seemingly trivial circumstance
as the hanging of an egg from the ceiling arrests the attention, and
invites inquiry as to the intention of it:—

'The ostrich egg is a curious but common ornament in the religious
buildings of the Copts, the Greeks, and the Muslims alike. It may be
seen in the ancient church of the Greek convent in Kasr-ash Shammah, and
in most of the mosques in Cairo, mounted in a metal frame, and hung by a
single wire from the roof. In the churches it usually hangs before the
altar screen; but at Abu-s-Sifain, an ostrich egg is suspended also from
the point of the arches of the baldakyn. Here and there it is placed
above a lamp, threaded by the suspending cord, as in the Church of the
Nativity at Bethlehem; and sometimes it hangs from a wooden arm fastened
on to the pillars of the nave, as in the Nestorian church of At-Tahara,
in Mosul. Sometimes, instead of the egg of the ostrich, artificial eggs
of beautiful Damascus porcelain, coloured with designs in blue or
purple,

<span id="page_257">p. 257</span>

were employed, but these have almost entirely disappeared; in the
churches of the two Cairos there is, I believe, not one left; but a few
still remain in the churches of Upper Egypt, and in the mosques. The
tomb mosque of Kait Bey, without the walls of Cairo, contains some fine
specimens. These porcelain eggs are considerably smaller than an ostrich
egg, but larger than a hen's egg. In the British Museum there is a
porcelain egg from Abyssinia, with cherubim rudely painted under the
glaze. It clearly belonged once to a Christian place of worship. The
"Griffin's egg" was a common ornament in our own mediæval churches. In
the inventory of 1383 A.D., no less than nine are mentioned as belonging
to Durham Cathedral; and Pennant speaks of two as still remaining in
1780. . . . From the fact that marble eggs are said to have been
discovered in some early martyrs’ tombs at Rome, and that in all
Christian lands eggs are associated with Easter-time, some think that
the egg was regarded as emblematic of the Resurrection.' Another
explanation was given to the author here quoted, by the Copts
themselves. An ostrich is proverbially vigilant, therefore the egg
becomes a type of watchfulness. 'This explanation seems rational,' he
adds, 'for the devotion of the ostrich to its brood is, I believe, in
accordance with the facts of natural history, and the use of the egg may
well have arisen in Africa, where the habits of the bird are better
known. At any rate, it is the best solution of the question.'

From the conclusion we must dissent, for the custom is universal, and of
ancient origin, handed down from a time before Christianity, and all
evidence points to the former explanation being the true
one—resurrection, or rather, life. The egg is the typical germ, and
therefore the natural symbol of creation. That the

<span id="page_258">p. 258</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Copts may see in
it a symbol of vigilance we need not at all dispute, nor even contend
that it is now used with definite symbolical meaning. For
centuries—millenniums—they have been suspended from the ceilings of
temples and tombs, and may now be accepted in many instances as merely
ornamental trappings, but even thus accounted of good and sacred omen,
from the importance of the points from which they are suspended; for not
only are they hung in sacred buildings, but in places of honour and of
ritual importance. In the churches in Athens numbers of ostrich eggs
hang before the pictures of the Iconastasis.

The 'Griffin's eggs' were not necessarily ostrich eggs; in one instance
they are described as having a brown and hairy exterior, the inside
white, with a clear liquid yelk. We can buy them now for four-pence, as
cocoa-nuts.

 

In portraits of Eastern kings an egg is sometimes shown suspended from
the centre of the tester of the throne, and this is quite a traditional
observance, which we find followed in Italian art; unless, indeed, a
crown is suspended there, like that Benjamin of Tudela saw at
Constantinople, glittering with jewels. Something pendant and freely
swinging there must be to satisfy the Eastern taste; a means of beauty
to which we rarely resort except for lamps, which have had to give way
to the rigid pipe of gas. Cardinals' hats hang with splendid effect from
the dim height of the vaults of foreign cathedrals, drooping and faded
from age. But of all these things, a large jewel swinging from a cord
would be the most mysterious and magnificent, like that over the Great
Mogul's Peacock throne, as seen by Tavernier: 'When the king sets
himself upon the throne, there is a transparent jewel

<span id="page_259">p. 259</span>

with a diamond appendant of eighty or ninety carats, encompassed with
rubies and emeralds, so hung that it is always in his eye.' Another
pendant was a green parrot in one emerald. Suspended votive crowns were
frequent in earlier days. Constantine is said to have devoted his to the
sepulchre of our Lord; and in England, Canute dedicated his to
Winchester. In the

<span id="img_fig28"></span>

[![Figure 28. Italian Canopy, from a Tile](tn/fig28.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/fig28.jpg.md)  
  

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Cluny Museum are
several of these crowns; a treasure-trove at Toledo. They are of about
the eighth century, and there are hardly now in the world objects more
strangely fascinating, with their pendant strings of jewels—circlets of
blazing splendour, in barbaric gold. In a former chapter we have seen
that these insignia and orbs were suspended from the

<span id="page_260">p. 260</span>

ceilings in Persia and in Assyria. We meet, too, in several places with
a tradition of suspended chains of gold—in the porch of the Temple of
Herod, in India, and in Scandinavia.

 

Pendant ostrich eggs are found in festoons at Jerusalem and at Mount
Athos, and may be seen in the west at Toledo and Marseilles. In India,
Miss Gordon Cumming saw ostrich eggs suspended from the gorgeous canopy
of one of the great tombs of Delhi. At Tunis, they continue to be
brought to the tombs, where they are suspended as *ex votos*. The
Moorish mosques and tombs in Algiers are crowded with them, and at
Kirwan, the holy city inland, they are hung over the tomb of 'The
Companion,' with gilded balls of earth from Mecca. At Damascus, Lady
Burton describes the tomb of St John as 'hung over with lamps and
ostrich eggs; these latter are the ornaments of all holy places, and are
supposed to bring good fortune.' It is the same over the tomb of the
holy Hasan and his brother. Enough has been said to show that the
practice of hanging these eggs is, or was recently, followed in Europe,
Asia, and Africa, by all Christians—Catholic, Greek, Coptic, Nestorian,.
Abyssinian, Armenian; and by all Mohammedans in Turkey, Persia, India,
Syria, Egypt, and Algeria. Let us follow up the tradition historically.

In a picture of the fifteenth century, in the National Gallery, by Marco
Marziale, he shows an apse designed after that in St Mark's, Venice, and
intended for part of the interior of the Temple. From the centre of this
apse hangs a beautiful lamp, threaded on the cord of which is an ostrich
egg, directly over the Christ. A picture of Mantegna's has a similar
lamp (see next page). Hung over the tomb, as we have seen in several
instances, or as here, over our Lord, they are

<span id="page_261">p. 261</span>

emblems of resurrection, and it is in this sense that they are so
universally used in the early spring as <span id="img_fig29"></span>

'Easter eggs,' not only in London and Paris, but widely over the world.
Walcott's 'Dictionary of Archæology' says: 'The egg was the symbol of
creation in Egypt, and of hope and the resurrection among the early
Christians; the custom of giving coloured pasch eggs on Easter morning
is found in the East, in the Tyrol, in Russia, in Greece, and many parts
of England, where it may be traced back to the time of Edward I., and
was observed at Gray's Inn in the reign of Elizabeth. In France, the
pasch egg is eaten before any other nourishment on Easter day. Paul II.
issued a form of benediction of eggs for England, Scotland, and Ireland;
Henry VIII. received a paschal egg in a case of silver
[filigree](errata.htm#5.md) from the Pope.' And an interesting point
follows: 'De Moleon says that at Angers, on Easter day, two chaplains,
standing behind the altar, addressed two cubiculars or corbeliers, as
they advanced, "Whom seek ye?" and to the reply, "Jesus of Nazareth, the
crucified," answered,

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "He is risen; He
is not here." Then those who personated the Maries took from the altar
two ostrich eggs wrapped in silk, and descended singing, "Alleluia, the
Lord is risen."'

In the account of Muscovy in 1567, in Hakluyt, it is told how the people
prepared eggs against Easter, dyed red with basil, and gentlemen and
gentlewomen have eggs gilded, which they carry in like manner. They use
it, as they say, for a great love, and in token of the resurrection,
whereof they rejoice; for when two friends meet during the Easter
holidays they come and take one another by the hand; the one of them
saith: 'The Lord or Christ is risen;' the other answereth: 'It is so, of
a truth,' and then they kiss and exchange their eggs (both men and
women), continuing in kissing for days together.' Waterton tells us that
where he was at school, in the North of England, they had pasch eggs
dyed purple on Easter morning.

 

The custom of hanging an egg from a dome appears in the story of the
lamp, where Aladdin is made to ask for the roc's egg itself to adorn his
palace. It was a roc's egg that Sinbad saw, half buried in the sands of
Serindib, like a dome fifty feet in diameter. The story of the roc is
linked to that of other immense mythical birds. In Japan the appearance
of a vast bird is accounted, with earthquake and flood, as one of the
'seven calamities.' 'The Garuda of the Hindus, the Simurgh of the old
Persians, the Angka of the Arabs, the Bar-Yuchre of the Rabbinical
legends, the Gryps of the Greeks, were probably all versions of the same
original fable' (Col. Yule's Marco Polo'). Then there are *Amru and
Chamru* of the Avesta, which, like the eagle of the Norse and the
phoenix of the 'Romance

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

of Alexander,' are perched aloft on the 'tree of all seeds.' The prowess
of this mythical bird is one of the story subjects in the world's
lore—how it flies with elephants in its grasp, or carries off the strong
hero Rustem; or in the Talmud: 'An egg once dropped out of the nest of a
bird called Bar-Yuchnei, which deluged *sixty cities* and swept away
*three hundred cedars*. The question therefore arose: "Does the bird
generally throw out its eggs?" Rav Ashi answered: "No; that was a rotten
one"' (Hershon). Already, in the clay writings, there is the mighty Zu
bird, on a high mountain, alone.

In Egypt it was the golden egg hatched by the goose that produced the
mundane matter; and the bird is only framed on a scale suitable, or even
perhaps hardly adequate, to the work it has to do! Nearly all systems
giving an account of a genesis agree in this, that as the second or
third step there was produced from chaos a gigantic egg. The Egyptian,
Phœnician, Assyrian, Hindu, and Greek systems are here at one. 'From
Desire and Vapour proceeded primitive Matter. It was a muddy
water—black, icy, profound—encompassing insensible monsters, incoherent
parts of forms to be born. Then Matter condensed and became an egg. It
broke; one half formed the earth, the other half the firmament. The sun,
the moon, the winds, and the clouds appeared, and a crash of thunder
awakened the sentient animals.' The Orphic fragments and Aristophanes
preserve a Greek tradition to the same effect. When only Chaos and Night
existed—

'At length, in the dreary chaotical closet  
 Of Erebus old, was a privy deposit;  
 By night the primæval in secresy laid  
 A Mystical Egg, that in silence and shade  
 Was brooded and hatched.'—*The Birds*.

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

And we may complete the scheme from quite another source—the northern
Kalevala:—

'From one half of the egg, the lower,  
 Grows the nether vault of Terra;  
 From the upper half remaining  
 Grows the upper vault of Heaven.'

The Hindu code of Manu gives an account entirely similar. The Eternal,
willing to create, made by thought the humid principle and in it
deposited matter. This primitive germ floated on the waters; soon the
mass condensed itself into an egg, brilliant as gold and full of light.
From this mysterious envelope was born Brahma, father of all spirits. At
the end of a year the egg opened of itself; the upper half formed the
sky, the lower part the earth, the air is between, with the eight
regions and the reservoir of waters. Another account says the egg
contained the five elements, and was enclosed in seven envelopes, like
the wrappings of an onion; the seven envelopes falling off became the
seven heavens, and the seven worlds of the Brahman world scheme.

M. Dognée, in *Les Symbols Antiques, l’Œuf*, has traced the symbolic use
of the egg as it appears on the monuments or in literature, but only in
a footnote is the suspended ostrich egg mentioned, as it is found in
Temple, Tomb, Church, and Mosque.

'In Japan, in the Pagoda of Miaco,' he says, 'upon a large square altar
is placed a bull of massive gold on a block of rock; the animal is
ornamented by a rich collar, and pushes with its horns an egg floating
in the water contained in a cavity of the rock. To explain this image,
the following is told by the Priests. At the time of chaos, before the
creation, the world was concealed and inert in an egg which floated on
the surface of the waters. . . The divine bull image of

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

creative force broke the egg by a stroke of its horns, and from the egg
issued the terrestrial globe.'

The earth itself was considered by several mediæval writers to be
oviform. Bede likened the world to an egg, as did also Edrisi the
Arabian geographer: it half floated in water in an upright position,
Jerusalem being at the top.

The egg symbol was especially made use of by the Egyptians: it is shown
on the monuments and referred to in the texts as a symbol of the embryo
creation (Ra in the Egg). Wilkinson, writing of the ostrich, says 'even
its eggs were required for some ornamental or religious use, and these
with the plumes formed part of the tribute imposed by the Egyptians on
the conquered countries where it abounded. The purpose to which the eggs
were applied is unknown; but we may infer, from a religious prejudice in
their favour among the Christians of Egypt, that some superstition was
connected with them, and that they were suspended in the temples of the
ancient Egyptians, as they still are in the churches of the Copts. . . .
. They consider them the emblems of watchfulness: sometimes they use
them with a different view; the rope of their lamps is passed through an
ostrich egg shell in order to prevent rats coming down and drinking the
oil, as we were assured by the monks of Dayr Antonios.'

When the primordial egg was a part of the cosmological legend of a
people, it is easy to see that not only was any egg a symbol of the
origin of life, but an especially large egg would be preserved as
sacred, and suspended in the temple an image of the world floating in
the void: and there does seem something inherently mysterious in the
structure and perfect form of a very large egg. One, for instance, in
the Museum of Natural History is some thirteen

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

inches long, thirty inches in girth; it will hold two and one-third
gallons.

Although there is no incontrovertible evidence of eggs having been
suspended in Egyptian temples, of Greece we have the clearest
contemporary testimony by Pausanias. 'And hard by (Boonita in Laconia)
is the temple of Hilaira and Phœbe, who, the writer of the Cyprian poems
says, were the daughters of Apollo; and their priestesses are maidens,
called also Leucippides as well as the goddesses. One of their statues
was touched up by a priestess of the goddesses, who, with an art not
unknown in our days, put a new face on the old statue; but a dream
prevented her treating the other statue in the same way. *Here is hung
up an egg, fastened to the roof by fillets; they say it is the egg which
Leda is said to have laid*' (iii. 16). The story of Leda and the
parallel one of Latona are but distorted cosmic myths of Night and
Chaos, from which is formed the egg mundane.

The egg, firmly and widely accepted as a symbol of life and creation,
becomes an emblem of resurrection and new life; and thus the
widely-spread observance of Easter egg customs, and the association with
the tomb. 'Marble eggs are said to have been discovered in some early
martyr's tomb at Rome' (Butler). 'Admitted to the funeral ceremonies,
the egg was also deposited in the tomb with the cinders of the dead.
Eggs have been found in many tombs at Nola' (Dognée). In the British
Museum are six large ostrich eggs, decorated with carvings in low
relief, of Archaic style, which were found in one tomb at Vulci, in
Etruria. Perrot, who illustrates them, says .they are of Phœnician
origin. The holes—one large in the centre with three smaller ones round
it, and one hole only at the other end—show that they were certainly
mounted, probably with

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

a metal cap, for suspension, like the modern ones in the East.

Mr Dennis (Etruria) says: 'The eggs have holes in them as if for
suspension, and bring to mind the great roc's egg of the Arabian Nights;
or rather, recall the fact of ostrich eggs being suspended in mosques at
the present day. Imitations of ostrich eggs in terra cotta (as though
the supply of real ones was not sufficient) have been found in the tombs
of Vulci. Hens’ eggs are often found not only in Etruria but in Greece
and her colonies, and are sometimes enclosed in vases. Many museums of
Italy contain specimens of this singular sepulchral furniture, probably
in this case an emblem of resurrection.' Instances of all these are in
the British Museum. In a tomb at Bologna an Etruscan was exhumed with an
egg in his hands (Sir F. Burton).

Of the Latin races Dognée says 'it was by following the empire of the
same idea that they affected the ovoid form for funeral vases,' an
example of the reaction of thought and custom on design which, if true
here, is certainly as well founded in the case of Egyptian funeral
vases, some of which in the British museum are of the form of an egg:
and on the tables of offerings shown in the reliefs there are almost
invariably egg-shaped vessels.

Maurice, in his 'Antiquities of India,' says of a serpent coiled around
an egg used as a symbol on coins: 'The Phœnecians adorned the lofty
temples of Tyre with this emblem, which was there seen suspended on
high, and encircling in its genial folds the mundane egg or symbol of
the universe.' This is entirely parallel on the one side to the account
of Pausanias quoted above of the egg suspended in memory of that laid by
Leda, and on the other to Chaldian myth. Not only was it a symbol of the
earth's first birth to the Phœnicians, but to the Assyrians as well.
'The Chaos-serpent,'

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

says Mr Boscawen, 'lay coiled round the earth until slain by Merodach
the Lord of Light.' The serpent is represented with the body of a woman,
and 'it was this Queen of Chaos who ruled while the earth lay like the
cosmic egg in her coils, in the time when as yet none of the gods had
come forth.'

Of its early votive use by the Semites, Mr Robertson Smith tells us that
the people of Mecca annually visited a tree where they suspended
weapons, garments, and ostrich eggs.

In the British Museum is an ovoid stone from Chaldea which has an
inscription of Sargon I. (to whose name is attached the earliest date in
monumental history) dedicating it to the temple of Sippara: it is of
beautiful veined alabaster, about three inches long, and pierced for
suspension. Schliemann found several eggs of oriental alabaster at
'Troy' and Mycenæ which he considered *ex votos*.

There is a beautiful specimen in the Museum at Athens of an ostrich egg,
the surface of which is decorated with swimming dolphins of blue
vitreous material probably of Egyptian origin. This was found in a tomb
at Mycenæ, and would seem to be earlier than the sixth century; it is
pierced for a cord, and is an object of singular beauty (see [next
page](#img_fig30).md). In the South Kensington Museum there are two or
three ostrich eggs for hanging, elaborately carved, of Persian work; and
many of porcelain, from the churches of Anatolia, painted with cherubim.

It is curious to notice how the hanging lamp affects the form of the egg
with which it is so often associated in the East. The Jewish seven-light
brass synagogue lamp of several pieces hanging one to the other, has at
the bottom an egg-shaped pendant. Many of the Italian renaissance lamps
are ovoid: and a very splendid enamelled Russian lamp in South

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Kensington Museum
is of the same form itself, with a pendant separate piece the size and
shape of an ostrich egg. It may be that the shape is æsthetically the
best for suspension, the form of every drop of water as it falls. It is
sufficient for us that the egg <span id="img_fig30"></span>

was used as an architectural symbol of the origin of the world,
suspended from the sky-like dome, record of a genesis, an emblem of the
mystery of life, and a hope of resurrection.

 

Now when we recall the egg which Aladdin desired to suspend from the
dome of his palace, we can feel with him that even that room with the
twenty-four jewelled lattices was not perfect without it. The mistake
was to ask the Genie for the roc's egg itself, and not to be content
with its symbol. The adventure is the third and last peril of Aladdin,
and the termination of the story: when the younger brother of the
African Magician, disguised as the Holy Woman Fatima, is taken to the

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

palace by the Princess Badroulboudour:—'My good mother,' said the
princess, 'I am delighted to enjoy the company of such a holy woman as
yourself, who will by your presence bring down blessings upon the whole
palace. And now I mention this palace, pray tell me what you think of
it. But before I show you the other apartments, tell me how you like
this hall?'

'Pardon my freedom of speech, gracious lady,' replied the dissembling
magician. 'My opinion, if it can be of any value, is that if the egg of
a roc were suspended from the centre of the dome, this hall would not
have its equal in any of the four quarters of the world, and your palace
would be the wonder of the whole universe.'

'My good mother,' returned the princess, 'tell me what kind of bird a
roc is, and where the egg of one could be found?' 'Princess,' answered
the feigned Fatima, 'the roc is a bird of prodigious size which inhabits
the summit of Mount Caucasus; and the architect who designed your palace
can procure you a roc's egg.'

Aladdin returned late on the same evening, when the false Fatima had
taken leave of the princess, and had retired to the apartment allotted
to her. As soon as he entered the palace, he went to the apartment of
the princess. He saluted and embraced her; but she seemed to him to
receive him with less than her usual welcome. 'I do not find you, my
princess, in your usual good spirits,' said Aladdin. 'Has anything
happened during my absence that has displeased or vexed you? Do not, in
the name of heaven, conceal it from me; for there is nothing in my power
that I will not do to attempt to dispel it.' 'I have been disturbed by a
mere trifle,' replied the princess, 'and it really gives me so little
anxiety that I did not suppose that my discomposure would be so apparent
in my face and

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

manner that you could have perceived it. But since you have observed
some alteration in me, which I by no means intended, I will not conceal
the cause, inconsiderable as it is. I thought as you did yourself,' the
princess continued, 'that our palace was the most superb, the most
beautiful, and the most completely decorated of all the buildings in the
whole world. I will tell you, however, what has come into my head on
thoroughly examining the hall of the twenty-four windows. Do not you
think with me that if a roc's egg were suspended from the centre of the
dome, it would greatly improve the effect?' 'It is enough, my princess,'
replied Aladdin, 'that you think the absence of a roc's egg a defect.
You shall find by the diligence with which I am going to repair this
omission, that there is nothing I will not do for the love of you.'

Aladdin instantly left the princess and went up to the hall of the
twenty-four windows; and then taking out of his bosom the lamp, which he
always carried about with him since the distress he had undergone from
the neglect of that precaution, he rubbed it to summon the genie, who
immediately appeared before him. 'O Genie!' said Aladdin, 'a roc's egg
should be suspended from the centre of the dome in order to make it
perfect; I command you in the name of the lamp which I hold to get this
defect rectified.'

Aladdin had scarcely pronounced these words when the genie uttered so
loud and dreadful a scream that the very room shook, and Aladdin could
not refrain from trembling violently. 'How thou wretch!' exclaimed the
genie in a voice that would have made the most courageous man shake with
