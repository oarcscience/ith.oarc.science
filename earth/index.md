<span id="shape"></span>

#### Flat, Hollow or Inside-Out?

One of the oldest earth mysteries was 'what shape is it?' Eratosthenes,
in 240 BC, was able to prove the sphericity of the earth and estimate
its size to a reasonable margin of error, by comparing the angle of the
sun at two distant locations simultaneously. Aristotle knew that the
earth was spherical, citing the horizon, the Earth's circular shadow
during lunar eclipses, and other phenomena.

Many educated people knew about the spherical earth from late antiquity
on. However, most Europeans believed that the earth was flat until the
explorations of the renaissance. The Biblical concept of an earth with
*four corners* (e.g. [Isa 11:12](../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012).md) was taken
very literally. Note that the word used here,
[kanaf](../bib/poly/h3671.md), is a word used for corners of buildings,
cloth, bedsheets, and so on. To confuse matters somewhat, the earth is
also described in Isaiah as being circular ([Isa
40:22](../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022).md), specifically it says *the circle of
the earth*. Some modern inerrantists point to this as 'evidence' that
the earth is round, although Isaiah seems to imply that it is
disk-shaped here. The Hebrew word used here is
[khug](../bib/poly/h2329.md), which unambiguously means *circle,* not
*sphere.* It is related to a root [khagag](../bib/poly/h2287.md), which
means to dance in a circle, or a sacred procession which moves in a
circle. Square? Circular? it's enough to make your head spin...

In the late 19th century a number of alternative theories of the shape
of the earth were proposed, flat, hollow and inside-out. By the time the
poles had been reached in the early 20th century, the time for these
theories had passed. Today, some Biblical inerrantists still believe
that the Earth is flat.
