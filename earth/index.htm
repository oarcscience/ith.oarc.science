<A NAME="shape"></a>
<H4>Flat, Hollow or Inside-Out?</H4>
<P>
One of the oldest earth mysteries was 'what shape is it?'
Eratosthenes, in 240 BC, was able to prove the sphericity
of the earth and estimate its size to a reasonable margin of error,
by comparing the angle of the sun at two distant locations simultaneously.
Aristotle knew that the earth was spherical, citing the horizon,
the Earth's circular shadow during lunar eclipses, and other phenomena.</P
<P>
Many educated people knew about the spherical earth from
late antiquity on. 
However, most Europeans believed that the earth was flat until the explorations
of the renaissance.
The Biblical concept of an earth with <I>four corners</I>
(e.g. <A HREF="../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#012">Isa 11:12</A>)
was taken very literally.
Note that the word used here, <A HREF="../bib/poly/h3671.htm">kanaf</A>,
is a word used for corners of buildings, cloth, bedsheets, and so on.
To confuse matters somewhat, the earth is also described in Isaiah as
being circular (<A HREF="../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#022">Isa 40:22</A>),
specifically it says <I>the circle of the earth</I>.
Some modern inerrantists point to this as 'evidence' that the earth is round,
although Isaiah seems to imply that it is disk-shaped here.
The Hebrew word used here is <A HREF="../bib/poly/h2329.htm">khug</A>,
which unambiguously means <I>circle,</I> not <I>sphere.</I>
It is related to a root <A HREF="../bib/poly/h2287.htm">khagag</A>,
which means to dance in a circle, or a sacred procession which moves
in a circle.
Square? Circular? it's enough to make your head spin...
</P>
<P>
In the late 19th century a number of alternative theories
of the shape of the earth were proposed,
flat, hollow and inside-out.
By the time the poles had been reached in the early
20th century, the time for these theories had passed.
Today, some Biblical inerrantists still believe that the Earth is flat.
