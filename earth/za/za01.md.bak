# PREFACE

### TO THE SECOND EDITION.

To the various critics who reviewed unfavourably the first edition of
this work, and to those also who wrote and published replies to it, my
thanks are due and now respectfully tendered. They pointed out several
matters which, on proper examination, were not, as evidence, entirely
satisfactory; and as my object is to discover and hold to that only
which is true beyond doubt, I have omitted them in the present edition.
The true business of a critic is to compare what he reads with known and
provable *data*, to treat impartially the evidence he observes, and
point out logical deficiencies and inconsistencies with first
principles, but never to obtrude his own opinions. He should, in fact,
at all times take the place of Astrea, the Goddess of Justice, and
firmly hold the scales, in which the evidence is fairly weighed.

I advise all my readers who have become Zetetic not to be content with
anything less than this; and also not to look with disfavour upon the
objections of their opponents. Should such objections be well or even
plausibly founded,

<span id="page_vi">p. vi</span>

they will only tend to free us from error, and to purify and exalt our
Zetetic philosophy. In a word, let us make friends, or, at least,
friendly and useful instruments of our enemies; and, if we cannot
convert them to the better cause, let us carefully examine their
objections, fairly meet them if possible, and always make use of them as
beacons for our future guidance.

In all directions there is so much truth in our favour that we can well
afford to be dainty in our selection, and magnanimous, charitable, and
condescending towards those who simply believe, but cannot prove, that
we are wrong. We need not seize upon every crude and ill-developed
result which offers, or only seems to offer, the slightest chance of
becoming evidence in our favour, as every theorist is obliged to do if
he would have his theory clothed and fit to be seen. We can afford to
patiently wait, care-fully weigh, and well consider every point
advanced, in the full assurance that simple truth, and not the mere
opinions of men, is destined, sooner or later, to have ascendancy.
