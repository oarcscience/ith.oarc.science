# CHAPTER X.

### CAUSE OF SUN APPEARING LARGER WHEN RISING AND SETTING THAN AT NOONDAY.

IT is well known that when a light of any kind shines through a dense
medium it appears larger, or rather gives a greater "glare," at a given
distance than when it is seen through a lighter medium. This is more
remarkable when the medium holds aqueous particles or vapour in
solution, as in a damp or foggy atmosphere. Anyone may be satisfied of
this by standing within a few yards of an ordinary street lamp, and
noticing the size of the flame; on going away to many times the
distance, the light or "glare" upon the atmosphere will appear
considerably larger. This phenomenon may be noticed, to a greater or
less degree, at all times; but when the air is moist and vapoury it is
more intense. It is evident that at sunrise, and at sunset, the sun's
light must shine through a greater length of atmospheric air than at
mid-day; besides which, the air near the earth is both more dense, and
holds more watery particles in solution, than the higher strata through
which the sun shines at noonday; and hence the light must be dilated or
magnified, as well as modified in colour. The following diagram, fig.
66, will show also that, as the sun recedes from the meridian, over a
plane surface, the light, as it strikes the atmosphere, must give a
larger disc.

FIG. 66.

Let A, B, represent the upper stratum of the atmosphere; C, D, the
surface of the earth; and 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, the sun, in his morning,
forenoon, noon, afternoon, and evening positions. It is evident that
when he is in the position 1, the disc of light projected upon the
atmosphere at 6, is considerably larger than the disc projected from the
forenoon position, 2, upon the atmosphere at 7; and the disc at 7 is
larger than that formed at 8, when the sun, at 3, is on the meridian;
when at 4, the disc at 9 is again larger; and when at 5, or in the
evening, the disc at 10 is again as large as at 6, or the morning
position. It is evident that the above results are what must of
necessity occur if the sun's path, the line of atmosphere, and the
earth's surface, are parallel and horizontal lines. That such results do
constantly occur is a matter of everyday observation; and we may
logically deduce front it a striking argument against the rotundity of
the earth, and in favour of the contrary conclusion, that it is
horizontal. The atmosphere surrounding a globe would not permit of
anything like the same degree of enlargement of the sun when rising and
setting, as we daily see in nature.
