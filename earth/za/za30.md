# CHAPTER XII.

### THE CAUSE OF TIDES.

IT has been shown that the doctrine of the earth's rotundity is simply a
plausible theory, having no practical foundation; all ideas, therefore,
of "centre of attraction of gravitation," "mutual mass attraction of
earth and moon," &c. &c., as taught in the Newtonian hypothesis must be
given up, and the cause of tides in the ocean sought in some other
direction. Before commencing such an inquiry, however, it will be useful
to point out a few of the difficulties which render the theory
contradictory, and therefore false and worthless.

1st. The intensity of attraction of bodies on each other is affirmed to
be proportional to bulk.

2nd. The earth is affirmed to be much larger than the moon ("The mass of
the moon according to Lindenau is 1/87 of the mass of the earth" <span
id="fr_55"></span>[1](#fn_55)), and therefore to have much the greatest
attractive power. How then is it possible for the moon with only one
eighty-seventh part of the attractive power of the earth, to lift up the
waters of the ocean and draw them towards herself? In other words, how
can the lesser power overcome the greater?

3rd. It is affirmed that the intensity of attraction increases with
proximity, and *vice versâ*.

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

How, then, when the waters are drawn up by the moon from their bed, and
away from the earth's attraction,--which at that greater distance from
the centre is considerably diminished, while that of the moon is
proportionately increased--is it possible that all the waters acted on
should be prevented leaving the earth and flying away to the moon?

If the moon has power of attraction sufficient to lift the waters of the
earth at all, even a single inch from their deepest receptacles, where
the earth's attraction is much the greater, there is nothing in the
theory of attraction of gravitation to prevent her taking to herself all
the waters which come within her influence. Let the smaller body once
overcome the power of the larger, and the power of the smaller becomes
greater than when it first operated, because the matter acted on is
nearer to it. Proximity is greater, and therefore power is greater.

4th. The maximum power of the moon is affirmed to operate when on the
meridian of any place.

How then can the waters of the ocean immediately underneath the moon
flow towards the shores, and so cause a flood tide? Water flows, it is
said, through the law of gravity, or attraction of the earth's centre;
is it possible then for the moon, having once overcome the power of the
earth, to \] et go her hold upon the waters, through the influence of a
power which she has conquered, and which therefore, is less than her
own? Again, if the moon really draws the waters of the ocean towards
herself, can she take them to her own meridian, and there increase their
altitude without depressing or lowering the

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

level of the waters in the places beyond the reach of her influence? Let
the following experiments be tried, and then the answer given:--

1st. Spread out on a table a sheet of paper of any size, to represent a
body of water; place an object or mark at each edge of the paper, to
represent the shores. Now draw the paper gently upwards in the centre,
and notice the effect upon the objects or marks, and the edge of the
paper.

2nd. Take a basin of water, and carefully note the level round the edge.
Now place the bottom of a small lift-pump upon the surface of the water
in the centre of the basin. On making the first stroke of the pump, the
water will be slightly elevated in the centre, but it will recede or
fall in at the sides.

In both the above experiments it will be seen that the water will be
drawn away from the sides representing the shores when it is elevated in
the centre. Hence the supposed attraction of the moon upon the waters of
the earth could not possibly cause a flood-tide on the shores which are
nearest her meridian action, but the very contrary; the waters would
recede from the land to supply the pyramid of water formed immediately
underneath the moon, and of necessity produce an ebb tide instead of the
flood, which the Newtonian theory affirms to be the result.

The above and other difficulties which exist in connection with the
explanation of the tides afforded by the Newtonian system, have led
many, including Sir Isaac Newton himself, to admit that such explanation
is the least satisfactory portion of the "theory of gravitation."

From this point we may proceed to enquire: "What is

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

the real cause of the tides? The process must be purely Zetetic--first
to define the leading term, or terms employed; secondly, to collect all
the facts we can which bear upon the subject; and thirdly, to arrange
the evidence, and see what conclusion necessarily appears.

The tide is either the rising and falling of the water in relation to
the land; or the rising and falling of the land in relation to the
water; but as it is not at this stage decided which is the case, the
following must be the definition of the word tide:

DEFINITION.--Tide is the relative change of level between land and
water.

FACT 1.--There is a constant but variable pressure of the atmosphere
upon the surface of the earth and all the waters of the seas and lakes
which lie upon and within it, and upon all the oceans which surround it.

PROOF.--The workings of an air-pump, and the readings of the barometer
wherever experiments have been made. During storms at sea it has been
found that the commotion is almost confined to the surface, and seldom
extends to a hundred feet below: at which depth the water is always
calm, except in the path of currents and local submarine peculiarities.

The following quotations, gathered from casual reading, fully
corroborate the above statements:

<span class="small">"It is amazing how superficial is the most terrible
tempest; divers assure us that in the greatest storms calm water is
found at the depth of 90 feet. <span
id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56)</span>

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

"This motion of the surface of the sea is not perceptible to a great
depth. In the strongest gale it is supposed not to extend beyond 72 feet
below the surface; and at the depth of 90 feet, the sea is perfectly
still." <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57)

"The people are under a great mistake who believe that the substance of
the water moves to any considerable depth in a storm at sea. It is only
the form or shadow which hurries along like a spirit, or like a thought
over the countenance of the 'great deep,' at the rate of some forty
miles an hour. Even when the 'Flying Dutchman' is abroad, the great mass
of water continues undisturbed and nearly motionless a few feet below
the surface." <span id="fr_58"></span>[2](#fn_58)

"The unabraded appearance of the shells brought up from great depths,
and the almost total absence of the mixture of any *detritus* from the
sea, or foreign matter, suggest most forcibly the idea of *perfect
repose* at the bottom of the deep sea." <span
id="fr_59"></span>[3](#fn_59)

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"The sea may roll and shriek for woe,  
   And kiss the clouds with spray;  
Yet all is *calm* and bright below,  
   Down where the fishes play."

</div>

FACT 2. Water is (except to a very small degree), incompressible.

PROOF. Globes of metal--of gold and silver, of lead and of iron, the
last a large bomb-shell, have been filled with water, and subjected to
the force of powerful hydraulic machinery, and in every instance it was
found impossible to make them receive any appreciable addition. In some

<span id="page_163">p. 163</span>

instances, when the hydraulic pressure became very great, the water,
instead of exhibiting any signs of compression, was observed to ooze
through the pores of the metal, and to appear on the outer surface like
a fine dew or perspiration.

FACT 3. The atmospheric air is very elastic and greatly compressible.

PROOF. The condensation of air in the chamber of an air-gun; and
numerous experiments with an air-pump, condensing syringe, and similar
apparatus.

FACT 4. If a raft, a buoy, a ship, or any other structure which floats
on the open sea, is carefully observed, it will be seen to have a gentle
and regular fluctuating motion.

PROOF. However calm the water and the atmosphere, this gradual and
alternate rising and falling of the floating mass will generally be
visible to the naked eye. But a telescope (which magnifies motion as
well as bulk) will show its existence invariably.

FACT 4. Floating masses of different sizes and densities, being in the
same waters, and acted upon by the .same influences, fluctuate with
different velocities.

PROOF. Observation with the naked eye and with the telescope.

FACT 6. The largest and heaviest floating masses fluctuate less rapidly
than the smallest and lightest.

PROOF. Observation as above. A very striking illustration of the facts
4, 5, and 6, was observed by the author and many friends in Plymouth
Bay, in the autumn of 1864. He had previously .delivered a course of
lectures

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

in the hall of the Athenæum in that town; during which these and other
phenomena had been referred to. At the same period the triennial yacht
race was advertised, and as many as chose to do so were invited to meet
him on the rocks near the bay, early on the morning of the race. There
had assembled almost every form and size of vessel, from the smallest
yacht to the largest, as well as merchant and war ships. Among the
latter was observed laying alongside and within the great Breakwater,
the large iron-clad ship, the *Warrior*. The various phenomena were
observed by the whole party of ladies and gentlemen, not one of whom
expressed a doubt as to their reality.

The *Warrior*, being farthest away, and very large and heavy, was an
object of more special scrutiny. With telescopes her long black hull was
seen against the grey stone of the breakwater, to slowly fluctuate, and
almost with the regularity of a pendulum.

FACT 7. Wherever the general pressure of the atmosphere is greatest or
least, so are tides in the ocean less or greater than usual.

PROOF. The records of self-registering barometers in use in various
parts of the world.

FACT 8. The velocity of a flood-tide increases as it approaches land.

PROOF. Actual experiment. It is also a fact well known to sailors
engaged in coasting service.

FACT 9. If we go out in a boat with an ebb tide, we find the velocity
decreasing as we leave the shores and channels, until we reach a certain
point where the water is found to merely rise and fall but not to
progress.

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

PROOF. Actual experiment, often tried by, and well known to, pilots and
masters of tug steamers.

"The tide never ebbs and flows beyond 40 miles from land." <span
id="fr_60"></span>[1](#fn_60)

"Tides are great only on coasts and funnel-shaped rivers; in the centres
of wide seas, as the Pacific or Atlantic, the tides are trifling, the
whole is like water librating in a basin." <span
id="fr_61"></span>[2](#fn_61)

"When a ship is well out at sea, she is not affected by the tide, as it
creates no stream in the open sea, the tidal wave sweeping along, but
causing no more current than an ordinary billow." <span
id="fr_62"></span>[3](#fn_62)

It is recorded, that an ancient philosopher in a small boat allowed
himself to be carried to sea by an ebb tide, hoping thereby to discover
the source of the tides. After drifting many miles, the boat came to a
state of rest; and after a short time he found himself being carried
back to the shore. He had only been taken out by the ebb, and brought
again to land by the flood. He had discovered nothing, and seeing no
hope of doing so by repetitions of such a voyage, he destroyed himself
by jumping into the sea.

FACT 10. The times of ebb and flood tide at any given part are not
regularly exact, often being from half-an-hour to one hour or more
before and after the "Port Establishment time."

The times of ebb and flood and the altitude of the tides all over the
known world are very various and irregular. Sometimes running up at one
end of a river and down at the other, as in the river Thames. Sometimes
the flood

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

tide returning shortly after the usual and expected tide, as in
Southampton waters, the St. Lawrence, the Amazon,, and other rivers.

PROOF. The hydrographic records of various governments--notably the
English and American.

"At Holyhaven, near the mouth of the Thames, the tide is actually
falling and running *down* rapidly, when at the *same moment* it is
running up rapidly at London Bridge, and still rising. The first steamer
that ever hoisted a pennant under. the Admiralty, namely the *Echo*, was
commissioned under Lieutenant, now Admiral, Frederick Bullock, to survey
the river Thames and prove the above fact. Captain George Peacock,
second in command, was stationed in one of the ship's boats from 8
o'clock to 3 o'clock, both night and day, on the day before the full
moon up to the day after, from June to September, and the same of the
new moon of October, 1828, with a tide pole; another assistant being
stationed at the same time in the entrance of Holyhaven, with a tide
pole; and each having a pocket chronometer to note the exact times of
high-water and rise of the tide from low-water mark. The result was that
it was found the tide had fallen at Holyhaven six feet, and was running
rapidly *down* while at the *same moment* it was, at London Bridge still
rising and running rapidly up."

"There are four high waters and three low waters in the river St.
Lawrence (North America) at the *same time*; and in the river Amazon
(South America) there are no less than six high-waters and five
low-waters, at the same time; and in the dry season as many as seven
high-waters and six low-waters at the *same time* have been
known." <span id="fr_63"></span>[1](#fn_63)

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

On many occasions a third tide has flooded the Thames in 24 hours; and
some of these extra tides have been higher than the normal tides.

At Southampton there is always a second flood tide two hours after the
first.

"The first high water is caused by the eastern current up the Solent and
the inset from the English Channel, through St. Helen's and Spithead,
meeting near the Brambles. There is a second tide two hours after the
first, caused mainly by the stream setting to the westward through the
Solent at a rapid rate, assisted by the first quarter's ebb from
Chichester, Langston, and Portsmouth harbours, until it meets with a
check in the Narrows of Hurst, causing the second rise at Lymington
Leap, Southampton, &c. Low water is about 3 hours and 20 minutes after
the second high water." <span id="fr_64"></span>[1](#fn_64)

"The tidal water-mark at Portishead (mouth of the Avon), on the 16th of
August, 1871, at 7 o'clock in the morning, will be about 50 feet higher
relatively, than the tidal mark at London Bridge. At Cape Virgin (the
eastern entrance of the Straits of Magellan), at half-past eight the
same morning, the tidal mark will be about 51 feet higher than at York
Roads, (English Reach) towards the Western end of the Straits. At 2
o'clock of the same afternoon the tidal mark at Panama will be about 21
feet higher than at Colon, on the opposite side of the Isthmus; at Noel
Bay, in the Bay of Fundy (North America), at 1 o'clock of the same day,
the tidal mark will be about 53 feet higher than at Picton, on the
opposite side of the Nova Scotian Isthmus, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
At 5 o'clock the same evening, at Boisee Island, in the Corea, the tidal
mark will be about 49 feet higher than at Hong Kong, and about 42 feet

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

higher than at Cumsingmoon, at the mouth of the Canton river.

"At Christchurch, and at Granville, nearly opposite and across the
channel at 7 o'clock on the same morning, the water-mark will be 34 feet
higher at the latter part than at the former. At Piel Harbour
(Lancashire), at half-past 11 o'clock in the morning of the same date,
the water-mark will stand about 40 feet higher than *at the same moment*
at Rathwollen, Lough Swilly, on the N.E. coast of Ireland, nearly
opposite. The tide water-mark at Hull at half-past 6 a.m. or a little
later p.m. will be about 28 feet higher than at Berwick-on-Tweed, *at
the same moment* (16th or 31st), and about 32 feet higher than at
Margate. At Ballycastle Bay, N.E. coast of Ireland, the tide at the
highest springs never exceeds 3 feet, whilst at Piel Harbour and
Southerness it rises 28 feet, and at Liverpool 26 feet, independent of
forced tides by the wind. At Poole it never exceeds 7 feet; whilst at
Hastings it rises 24 feet, at Tenby 27 feet, and at Wexford, opposite,
only 5 feet; at Ark-low 4 feet, and Waterford 13 feet." <span

</div>

In these extracts abundant proof is given of the irregular character of
the tides, both in respect to times and altitudes.

FACT 11. Every ship, raft, or other floating mass, in addition to its
visible fluctuation, has a tremulous motion or tremor of the whole body.

PROOF. On the deck of any vessel or other floating body let the most
delicate instruments be placed, such as spirit-levels, poised compasses,
&c., and the tremulous motion will easily be recognised.

FACT 12. The earth has a tremulous motion more or less at all times.

PROOF. If a delicate spirit-level be firmly fixed on a rock or on the
most solid foundation it is possible to construct, and far away from the
influence of any railway, or blasting or mining operations, the curious
phenomenon will be observed of continual but irregular change in the
position of the air bubble. However carefully the level may be adjusted,
and the instrument protected from the atmosphere, the "bubble" will not
maintain its position long together. A similar effect is noticed in the
most

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

favourably situated astronomical observatories, where instruments of the
very best construction, and placed in the most approved positions,
cannot always be relied upon. without occasional and systematic
readjustment.

The following quotation affords a good illustration of the tremour above
described:---

<span class="small">"MARCH 12TH, 1822, in Adventure Bay, Island of South
Georgia, we anchored in seven fathoms water, latitude 54° 2´ 48″ S.,
longitude 38° 8´ 4″ W. The head of this Bay being surrounded with
mountains, I ascended the top of one of them for the purpose of taking
the altitude of the sun when at some distance from the meridian; but
after planting my artificial horizon, I was surprised to find that
although there was not a breath of wind, and everything around perfectly
still, yet the mercury had so tremulous a motion that I could not get an
observation." <span id="fr_67"></span>[1](#fn_67)</span>

FACT 13. Tides in the extreme south are very small, and in some parts
are scarcely perceptible.

PROOF. "The rise and fall of tide in Christmas Harbour, latitude 48° 41´
S, longitude 69° 3´ 35″ E., is remarkably small; not on any occasion
amounting to more than 30 inches and the usual spring tides are
generally less than two feet. The neap tide varies from four to twelve
inches, and the diurnal inequality is, comparatively, very
considerable." <span id="fr_68"></span>[2](#fn_68)

<span class="small">"Auckland Islands, latitude 50° 32´ 30″ S.,
longitude 166° 12´ 34″ E., high water at full and change of moon took
place, at 12 o'clock, and the highest spring tides scarcely
exceeded</span>

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

three feet. A remarkable oscillation of the tide when near the time of
high-water was observed; after rising to nearly its highest, the tide
would fall two or three inches, and then rise again between three and
four inches, so as to exceed its former height rather more than an inch.
This irregular movement generally occupied rather more than an hour, of
which the fall continued about 20 minutes, and the rise again upwards of
50 minutes of the interval."

"The same was observed at Campbell Island, South Harbour, latitude 52°
33´ 26″ S., longitude 169° 8´ 41″ E." <span
id="fr_69"></span>[1](#fn_69)

Along the whole length of southern land discovered by Lieut. Wilkes,
near the antarctic circle, and which extended upwards of 1500 miles,
very little tide was discovered.

<span class="small">"During the whole of our stay along the icy coast we
found no perceptible current by the reckoning and current log. Tides on
such an extent of coast there undoubtedly must be, but of little
strength, or we should have perceived them. In many of the icy bays we
were stationary for a sufficient time to perceive them if they had been
of any magnitude, and where the current was repeatedly tried." <span
id="fr_70"></span>[2](#fn_70)</span>

FACT 14. The tide generally turns a little *earlier below* than it does
above.

PROOF. Colonel Pasley, when operating on the "Royal George," the
war-ship which sunk at Spithead, was the first 'who observed and
recorded this peculiarity, which has also

<span id="page_172">p. 172</span>

been noticed during diving operations in Liverpool Bay and other
places. <span id="fr_71"></span>[1](#fn_71)

FACT 15.--Many large inland seas or lakes are entirely without tide,
while several wells of only a few feet in diameter have a considerable
rise and fall in the water corresponding in times to the tide in a
distant tidal sea.

PROOF---Many cases may be found in works on geography and geology.

FACT 16.--If, at any hour of the night, a telescope is firmly fixed,
securely lashed to any solid object, and turned to the pole-star, it
will be found on continuing the observation for some hours that the star
"Polaris" does not maintain its position, but seems to slowly rise and
fall in the field of view of the telescope. The line-of-sight will be
sometimes above it; in about twelve hours it will be below it; and in
another twelve hours it will again be above the star.

This peculiar motion of either the star or the earth is represented by
the following diagrams

<span class="small">In fig. 67, the line of sight, T, L, is represented
as *above* the</span>

FIG. 68.

<span class="small">pole-star, P; and in fig. 68, the same line is
*below* it. That such a peculiar phenomenon exists may be proved by
actual experiment on any clear night in winter, when it is dark
sufficiently long to observe for twelve hours together.</span>

Many more facts could be added to the foregoing collection, but already
the number is sufficient to enable us to form a definite conclusion as
to what is the real cause of the tides.

The facts 1 to 7 fully enable us to establish syllogistically the
groundwork of the reply. All bodies floating in an incompressible
medium, and exposed to atmospheric pressure, fluctuate, or rise and fall
in that medium.

The earth is a vast irregular structure, stretched out upon and standing
or floating in the incompressible waters of the "great deep."

*Ergo*--The earth has, of necessity, a motion of fluctuation.

Hence, when by the pressure of the atmosphere, the earth is depressed or
forced slowly down into the "great deep," the waters immediately close
in upon the receding bays and headlands, and produce the *flood tide*;
and

<span id="page_174">p. 174</span>

when, by reaction, the earth slowly ascends, the waters recede, and the
result is the *ebb tide*.

Facts 8, 9, 11, 12, and 16, show results that must necessarily follow
this fluctuation of the earth. The velocity of the flood is greatest as
it approaches land. If the waters were put in motion by the moon, the
velocity would be greatest where the altitude was greatest or nearest
the moon, and least the farthest from it or nearest the shores. The
reverse is the case in nature.

The line of sight being at a given time above the pole-star, as shown in
fact 16 ([fig. 67](#img_fig67)), and in twelve hours afterwards below
it, as shown in [fig. 68](#img_fig68), is exactly the result which must
follow a slowly rising and falling earth.

Facts 11 and 12 are also consistent with and necessarily attach to a
slowly fluctuating elastic mass like the earth.

In fact 10 we see the irregularity of time in flood and ebb, which
arises from the irregular form of the bed of the waters. The submarine
channels, banks, and depressions which exist in all directions, the
action and reaction, mounting and "back-lashing" of the waters, produce
the irregular times and altitudes of the tides observed and recorded in
the hydrographic offices of different nations.

In fact 13 we see that out of the reach of the great bulk of the
fluctuating earth the waters are but little disturbed; but if the waters
were lifted up by the moon they would flow towards and flood the
southern or antarctic lands as readily and to as great an extent as the
land in the equatorial and northern regions.

In fact 14 we have a phenomenon which could not possibly exist if the
tides arise from the action of the moon

<span id="page_175">p. 175</span>

upon the water; for as the action would first be on the surface, that
surface would be the first to show change of motion, and the bottom the
last.

In fact 15 we see what could not be possible if the moon were the cause
of tidal action by lifting the waters underneath her from their normal
position. If the moon's attraction operates in one place, what can
possibly prevent its action in all other places when and where the
relative positions are the same? No direct explanatory answer has yet
been given. If, however, the great inland lakes and seas are simply
indentations in and upon the land, the water contained in them of course
rises and falls *with* the earth on which they lie; there is no change
in the relative level of land and water, and therefore *no tide*. Just
as the fluctuations of a ship would show rising and falling, or ebb and
flood tide outside the hull, any vessel on the deck, filled with water,
would rise or fall *with* the ship, and would therefore exhibit no
change of level--*no tide*.

Thus we have been carried forward by the sheer force of evidence to the
conclusion that the tides of the sea do not arise from the attraction of
the moon, but simply from the rising and falling of the floating earth
in the waters of the "great deep." That calmness which is found to exist
at the bottom of the great seas could not be possible if the waters were
alternately raised by the moon and pulled down by the earth. The rising
and falling motion would produce such an agitation or "churning" of the
water that the "perfect repose," the growth of delicate organic
structures, and the accumulation of flocculent matter called "ooze,"
which has been so generally found when

<span id="page_176">p. 176</span>

taking soundings for deep-sea cables, could not exist. All would be in a
state of confusion, turbidity, and mechanical admixture.

The question: What has the moon to do with the tides? need not entirely
be set aside. It is possible that in some at present unknown way this
luminary may influence the atmosphere, increasing or diminishing its
barometric pressure, and indirectly the rise and fall of the earth in
the water; but of this there is not yet sufficient evidence, and
therefore the answer remains for the future.
