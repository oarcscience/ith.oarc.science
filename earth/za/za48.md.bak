### MOTION OF STARS NORTH AND SOUTH.

IT has often been urged that the earth must be a globe, because the
stars in the southern "hemisphere" move round a south polar star; in the
same way that those of the north revolve round "Polaris," or the
northern pole star. This is another instance of the sacrifice of truth,
and denial of the evidence of our senses for the purpose of supporting a
theory which is in every sense false and unnatural. It is known to every
observer that the north pole star is the centre of a number of
constellations which move over the earth in a circular direction. Those
nearest to it, as the "Great Bear," &c., &c., are always visible in
England during their whole twenty-four hours' revolution. Those further
away southwards rise north-north-east, and set south-south-west; still
further south they rise east by north, and set west by north. The
farthest south visible from England, the rising is more to the east and
south-east, and the setting to the west and south-west. But *all* the
stars visible from London rise and set in a way which

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

is not compatible with the doctrine of rotundity. For in-stance, if we
stand with our backs to the north, on the high land known as "Arthur's
Seat," near Edinburgh, and note the stars in the zenith of our position,
and watch for several hours, the zenith stars will gradually recede to
the *north-west*. If we do the same on Woodhouse Moor, near Leeds, or on
any of the mountain tops in Yorkshire or Derbyshire, the same phenomenon
is observed. The same thing may be seen from the top of Primrose Hill,
near Regent's Park, London; from Hampstead Heath; or Shooter's Hill,
near Woolwich. If we remain all night, we shall observe the same stars
rising towards our position from the north-east, showing that the path
of all the stars between ourselves and the northern centre move round
the north pole-star as a common centre of rotation; just as they *must*
do over a plane such as the earth is proved to be. It is undeniable that
upon a globe zenith stars would rise, pass over head, and set in the
plane of the observer's position. If now we carefully watch in the same
way the zenith stars from the Rock of Gibraltar, the very same
phenomenon is observed. The same is also the case from Cape of Good
Hope, Sydney and Melbourne in Australia, in New Zealand, in Rio Janeiro,
Monte Video, Valparaiso, and other places in the south. If then the
zenith stars of all the places on the earth, where special observations
have been made, rise from the morning horizon to the zenith of an
observer, and descend to the evening horizon, *not in a plane of the
position of such observer, but in an arc of a circle concentric with the
northern centre*, the earth is thereby

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

proved to be a plane, and rotundity altogether disproved--shown, indeed,
to be impossible.

Here, however, we are met with the positive assertion that there is a
very small star (of about the sixth magnitude) in the south, called
*Sigma Octantis*, round which all the constellations of the south
revolve, and which is therefore the southern polar star. It is scarcely
polite to contradict the statements made, but it is certain that persons
who have been educated to believe that the earth is a globe, going to
the southern parts of the earth do not examine such matters critically.
They see the stars move from towards the east towards the west, and they
are satisfied. But they have not instituted special experiments,
regardless of results, to ascertain the real and absolute movements of
the southern constellations. Another thing is certain, that from and
within the equator the north pole star, and the constellations *Ursa
Major*, *Ursa Minor*, and many others, can be seen from every meridian
simultaneously; whereas in the south, from the equator, neither the
so-called south pole star, nor the remarkable constellation of the
Southern Cross, can be seen simultaneously from every meridian, showing
that all the constellations of the south--pole star included--sweep over
a great southern arc and across the meridian, from their rise in the
evening to their setting in the morning. But if the earth is a globe,
*Sigma Octantis* a south pole star, and the Southern Cross a southern
circumpolar constellation, they would all be visible at the same time
from every longitude on the same latitude, as is the case with the
northern pole star and the northern circumpolar constellations. Such,
however,

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

is strangely not the case; Sir James Clarke Ross did not see it until he
was 8° south of the equator, and in longitude 30° W. <span
id="fr_131"></span>[1](#fn_131.md)

<span class="small">MM. Von Spix and Karl Von Martius, in their account
of -their scientific travels in Brazil, in 1817-1820, relate that "on
the 15th of June, in latitude 14° S, we beheld, *for the first time*,
that glorious constellation of the southern heavens, the Cross, which is
to navigators a token of peace, and, according to its position,
indicates the hours of the night. We had long wished for this
constellation as a guide to the other hemisphere; we therefore felt
inexpressible pleasure when we perceived it in the resplendent
firmament."</span>

The great traveller Humboldt says:--

<span class="small">"We saw distinctly, for the *first time*, the cross
of the south, on the nights of the 4th and 5th of July, in the 16th
degree of latitude. It was strongly inclined, and appeared from time to
time between the clouds. . . . The pleasure felt on discovering the
Southern Cross was warmly shared in by such of the crew as had lived in
the colonies."</span>

If the Southern Cross is a circumpolar cluster of stars, it is a matter
of absolute certainty that it could never be in-visible to navigators
upon or south of the equator. It would always be seen far above the
horizon, just as the "Great Bear" is at all times visible upon and north
of the equator. More especially ought it to be at all times visible when
the nearest star belonging to it is considerably nearer to the so-called
"pole star of the south" than is the nearest of the stars in the "Great
Bear" to the pole star of the north. Humboldt did not see the Southern
Cross until he

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

was in the 16th latitude south, and then it was "strongly inclined,"
showing that it was rising in the east, and sharing in the general sweep
of the stars from east to west, in common with the whole firmament of
stars moving round the pole star of the northern region.

We have seen that wherever the motions of the stars are carefully
examined, it is found that all are connected, and move in relation to
the northern centre of the earth. There is nowhere to be found a "break"
in the general connection. Except, indeed, what is called the "proper
motion" of certain stars and groups of stars all move in the same
general direction, concentric with the north pole, and with velocities
increasing with radial distance from it. To remove every possible doubt
respecting the motions of the stars from the central north to the most
extreme south, a number of special observers, each completely free from
the bias of education respecting the supposed rotundity of the earth,
might be placed in various southern localities, to observe and record
the motions of the well known southern constellation, not in relation to
a *supposed* south pole star, but to the meridian and latitude of each
position. This would satisfy a certain number of those who cannot divest
themselves of the idea of rotundity, but is not at all necessary for the
satisfaction of those who are convinced that the earth is a plane, and
that the extreme south is a vast circumference instead of a polar
centre. To these the evidence already adduced will be sufficiently
demonstrative.

The points of certainty are the following:--

<span class="small">1st.--Wherever the experiment is made the stars in
the zenith *do not* rise, culminate, and set in the same straight</span>

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

line, or plane of latitude, as they would if the earth is a globe.

2nd.--The Southern Cross is not at all times visible from every point of
the southern hemisphere, as the "Great Bear" is from every point in the
northern, and as both must necessarily and equally be visible if the
earth is globular. In reference to the several cases adduced of the
Southern Cross not being visible until the observers had arrived in
latitudes 8°, 14°, and 16° south, it cannot be said that they might not
have cared to look for it, because we are assured that they "had long
wished for it," and therefore must have been strictly on the look out as
they advanced southwards. And when the traveller Humboldt saw it "the
first time" it was "strongly inclined," and therefore low down on the
eastern horizon, and therefore previously invisible, simply because it
had not yet risen.

3rd.--The earth is a plane, with a northern centre, over which the stars
(whether fixed in some peculiar substance or floating in some subtle
medium is not yet known) move in concentric courses at different radial
distances from the northern centre as far south as and wherever
observations have been made. The evidence is the author's own
experiments in Great Britain, Ireland, Isle of Man, Isle of Wight, and
many other places; the statements of several unbiassed and truthful
friends, who have resided in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Rio
Janeiro, Valparaiso, and other southern localities, and the several
incidental statements already quoted.

4th--The southern region of the earth is not central, but
circumferential; and therefore there is no southern pole, no south pole
star, and no southern circumpolar constellations;

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="small">all statements to the contrary are doubtful,
inconsistent with known facts, and therefore not admissible as
evidence.</span>
