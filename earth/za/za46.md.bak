### STATIONS AND DISTANCES.

<span class="small">"The most complete proof that the earth is a globe
consists in the fact that travellers over its surface, whether by sea or
land, always find the distance between different stations, exactly such
as agree with the calculated distances." <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md)</span>

The above sentence is such a compound of childish fable, and either
unwarrantable assurance or ignorance,, that, were it not that the author
is an ardent and extensive, but not a careful or over-scrupulous writer,
in defence of the Newtonian astronomy, it would really be unworthy of
criticism. It is one of those utterances which indicate a desperate
determination to support a cause at all hazards, and without regard to
any evidence but such as agrees with a foregone conclusion. So great is
the number of those who advocate the earth's rotundity, who do not
hesitate to show the same spirit, that it is really a difficult thing to
feel that respect for them which persons who merely differ in opinion
ought at all times to show and feel towards each other. What can be more
misleading, or illogical, or even more the reverse of fact, than to say
that "travellers always find the distance between different stations
exactly such as agree with the calculated distances, and therefore the
earth is a globe?" A mariner at sea, coming in contact with new land,
immediately ascertains the latitude by taking the sun's altitude at
noon, and the longitude by the local meridian time in relation to the
meridian time at Greenwich. Neither the altitude of the sun, nor the
time by chronometer, has

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

any logical connection with the shape of the earth. It is true, elements
connected with the supposition of the earth's rotundity may be mixed up
with the mode of finding latitude and fixing longitude; and anyone may
afterwards readily find the places again, by sailing until the sun's
altitude and the time by chronometer are the same as those first
published, when, of course, they must have arrived at the same position,
whether the earth is a globe or a plane. It is altogether wrong to say
that places, either on land or sea, are found by calculation, except
that when places have already been found, and their latitudes and
longitudes given, calculation--which is merely the use of formulæ
resulting from previous observation--may be used to find them again.
But, primarily and essentially, places are found by observation, and not
by calculation. If anyone will read the reports of the leading
circumnavigators, and travellers of different countries, they will find
many instances where calculation has failed to agree with observations,
and where renewed observations have had to be made before anything like
the proper position of places in the maps could be fixed. In the
majority of instances, where calculation, even when mixed up with some
amount of observation, has been relied on, errors have been found.

<span class="small">"Assistant surveyor F. Gregory, and Mr. S. Trigg, in
a short exploration trip to the eastward of the Geraldine Mine, had
succeeded in discovering a large tract of good country, well grassed. .
. . Mr. Gregory, in hip report, notes a 'difference of 17 miles in
latitude, and something more in longitude, throughout the eastern
portion.'</span>

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

between himself and Mr. Austin--a difference for which he cannot
account. <span id="fr_126"></span>[1](#fn_126.md)

"This promontory (North Cape, Prince Edward's Island) we found by good
observation to be in latitude 46 ° 53´ S., and longitude 37° 33´ E.,
agreeing very nearly with Cook in the latitude, but differing
considerably in the longitude." <span id="fr_127"></span>[2](#fn_127.md)

"By noon (March 9, 1840) we were in latitude 64° 20´ S., and longitude
164 ° 20´ E., and therefore about 70 miles north of the land laid down
by Lieutenant Wilkes, and not far from the spot from which he must have
supposed he saw it; but having now searched for it at a distance varying
from 50 to 70 miles from it, to the north, south, east, and west, as
well as having sailed directly over its assigned position, we were
compelled to infer that it has no real existence." <span
id="fr_128"></span>[3](#fn_128.md)

Either Lieutenant Wilkes or Captain Ross had made a great mistake; or,
perhaps the land had disappeared?

In a "Memorandum by Admiral Krusenstern," of the Russian Navy, appended
to Lieutenant Wilkes' narrative, several discrepancies respecting true
positions are given, and advises that, in addition to the ordinary
modes, "absolutely astronomical observations" should be taken. He
concludes by saying: "With respect to the coast of South America,
Talcahuana, the longitude of which was determined by Captain Beechy to
be in 72° 56´ 59″ W., seems to me a well-determined point. Captain
Duperrey is not of that opinion; and it remains to be settled whether
the longitude of Talcahuana, or Valparaiso, in 71° 33´ 34″ W., deserves
the preference." Here is one of

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

many instances where, in a well-frequented place, a difference exists
among nautical calculators, as to its exact position, of 1° 23´ 25″, or
(supposing the earth a globe) fully 70 statute miles.
