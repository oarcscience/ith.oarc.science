### TANGENTIAL HORIZON.

IF a theodolite is placed on the sea shore, "levelled," and directed
towards the sea, the line of the horizon will be a given amount below
the cross-hair, and a certain "dip" or inclination from the level
position will have to be made to bring the cross-hair and the
sea-horizon together. If the theodolite is similarly fixed, but at a
greater altitude, the space between the cross-hair and the sea horizon,
and the dip of the instrument to bring them together, is also greater.
From the above, which is perfectly true, it has been concluded that the
surface of the earth is convex, and the line of sight over the sea
tangential. As a proof that such is not the case, the following
experiment may be tried:--

<span class="small">Place a theodolite on an eminence near the sea.
"Level," and direct it over the water, when the horizon will be seen a
little below the cross-hair or centre of the telescope, as shown in the
diagram, [fig. 30](za16.htm#img_fig30), page [41](za16.htm#page_41.md), and
from the cause there assigned, viz., collimation, or refraction. Now let
the instrument be inclined downwards until the cross-hair touches the
horizon, as shown in [fig. 31](za16.htm#img_fig31.md), page
[41](za16.htm#page_41.md), and in the following diagram, [fig.
92](#img_fig92.md). If the theodolite had a simple tube without lenses,
instead of a telescope, which causes the appearance shown in ,
the</span>

<span id="img_fig92"></span> ![FIG. 92.](img/fig92.jpg.md)  
FIG. 92.

<span class="small">horizon would be seen in a line with the cross-hair,
or axis of the eye, as at A, fig. 92, and the amount of "dip" required
to bring the cross-hair and the horizon in contact with each other will
be represented by the angle A, T, S, to which must be added the
collimation. In every instance where the experiment has been specially
tried, the dip without the collimation only amounted to the angle A, T,
S; thus proving that the' surface of the sea, S, B, is horizontal,
because parallel to the line A, T. If the water is convex, the line of
sight, A, T, would be a tangent, and the dip to the horizon would be T,
H, represented by the angle A, T, H. This angle, A, T, H, is never
observed, but always A, T, S, plus collimation or divergence produced by
the lenses in the telescope of the theodolite. Hence the surface of the
waters is everywhere horizontal.</span>

The words "collimation," "divergence," "refraction," &c., have many
times been used in connection with this part of the subject, and the
following very simple experiment will both exhibit what is meant, and
show its influence in practice.

<span class="small">Take a "magnifying glass," or a convex lens, and
hold it over a straight line drawn across a sheet of paper. If the line
is drawn longer than the diameter of the lens, that part of it which is
outside the lens will have a different position to that seen through it,
as shown in the following diagram, fig. 93.</span>

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

<span id="img_fig93"></span> ![FIG. 93.](img/fig93.jpg.md)  
FIG. 93.

<span class="small">Instead of the line going uninterruptedly through
the lens in the direction A, B, it will diverge, and appear at 1, 2; or
it will appear *above* the line A, B, as at 3, 4, if the lens is held to
the slightest amount above or below the actual centre.</span>

A lens is a magnifying glass because it *dilates*, or spreads out from
its centre, the objects seen through it. The infinitesimal or
mathematical point actually in the centre is, of course, not visibly
influenced, being in the very centre or on the true axis of the eye, but
any part in the minutest degree *out* of that abstract centre is
dilated, or diverged, or thrown further away from it than it would be to
the naked eye; hence its apparent enlargement or expansion. Whatever,
therefore, is *magnified*, is really so because thrown more or less *out
of the centre*, and the more or less magnifying power of the lens is
really the more or less divergence of the pencils of light on passing
through the substance of which it is composed. In the telescope of a
theodolite, or spirit-level, the spider's web of which the cross hair is
made is placed in the actual centre; hence, in an observation, the point
absolutely

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

opposite to it is not seen, but only some other point minutely distant
from it, but the distance of which is increased by the divergence caused
by the lenses; and this divergence is what is called the "magnifying
power." This is the source of those peculiarities which have been so
very illogically considered to be proofs of the earth's rotundity. It is
from this peculiarity that several gentlemen prematurely concluded that
the water in the Bedford Canal was convex.

On the 5th of March, 1870, a party, consisting of Messrs. John Hampden,
of Swindon, Wilts; Alfred Wallace, of London, William Carpenter, of
Lewisham, M. W. B. Coulcher, of Downham Market, and J. H. Walsh, Editor
of "The Field" newspaper, assembled on the northern bank of the "Old
Bedford Canal," to repeat experiments similar to those described in
figs. [2](za06.htm#img_fig02), [3](za06.htm#img_fig03.md),
[4](za07.htm#img_fig04), and [5](za07.htm#img_fig05.md), on pages
[11](za05.htm#page_11) to [14](za07.htm#page_14.md) of this work. But, from
causes which need not be referred to here, they abandoned their original
intentions, and substituted the following. On the western face of the
Old Bedford Bridge, at Salter's Lode, a signal was placed at an
elevation of 13 feet 4 inches above the water in the canal; at the
distance of three miles a signal-post, with a disc 12 inches in diameter
on the top, was so fixed that "the *centre* of the disc was 13 feet 4
inches above the water-line;" and at the distance of another three miles
(or six miles altogether), on the eastern side of the Welney Bridge,
another signal was placed, "3 inches above the top rail of the bridge,
and 13 feet 4 inches above the water-line." <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) This arrangement is represented in the
following diagram, fig. 94:--

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

<span id="img_fig94"></span> ![FIG. 94.](img/fig94.jpg.md)  
FIG. 94.

<span class="small">A, the signal on the Old Bedford Bridge; B, the
telescope on Welney Bridge; and C, the central signal-post, three miles
from each end. The object-glass of the telescope was 4½ inches diameter;
hence the centre, or true eye-line, was 2¼ inches higher than the top of
the signal B, and 3¾ inches below the top of the signal-disc at C. On
directing the telescope, "with a power of 50," towards the signal A, the
centre of which was 2¼ inches *below* the centre of the telescope, it
was seen to be below it; but the disc on the centre pole, the top of
which was, *to begin with*, 3¾ inches *above* the centre, or line of
sight, from the telescope, was seen to stand considerably *higher* than
the signal A. From which, three of the gentlemen immediately, but most
unwarrantably, concluded that the elevation of the disc in the field of
view of the telescope was owing to a rise in the water of the canal,
showing convexity! whereas it was nothing more than simply the upward
divergence (of that which was *already* 3¾ inches *above* the line of
sight) produced by the magnifying power of the telescope, as shown in
the experiment with the lens, on page [267](#page_267.md), [fig.
92.](#img_fig92.md)</span>

Why did they omit to consider the fact that 3¾ inches excess of altitude
would be made by a magnifying power of 50, to appear to stand
considerably above the eye-line, and that a mere hair's-breadth of
dip--an amount which could not be detected--towards the distant signal
would by magnifying,

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

diverging, or dilating all above it, make it appear to be lifted up for
several feet? Why did they not take care that the *top* of the centre
disc was *in a line* with the telescope and the distant signal, A? Why,
also, was the centre of the object glass fixed 2¼ inches *higher* than
the centre of the object of observation at the other end? There was no
difficulty in placing the *centre* of the telescope, the *top* of the
middle disc, and the *centre* of the farthest signal mark, at the *same
altitude*, and therefore in a straight line. For their own sakes as
gentlemen, as well as for the sake of the cause they had undertaken to
champion, it is unfortunate that they acted so unwisely; that they so
foolishly laid themselves open to charges of unfairness in fixing the
signals. Had they already seen enough to prove that the surface of the
water was horizontal, and therefore instinctively felt a desire to do
their best to delay as long as they could the day of general
denunciation of their cherished doctrine of the earth's rotundity? Such
questions are perfectly fair in relation to conduct so unjust and
one-sided. It is evident that their anxiety to defend a doctrine which
had been challenged by others overcame their desire for "truth without
fear of consequences;" and they eagerly seized upon the veriest shadow
of evidence to support themselves. In the whole history of invention, a
more hasty, ill-conceived, illogical conclusion was never drawn; and it
is well for civilisation that such procedure is almost universally
denounced. It is scarcely possible to draw a favourable conclusion as to
their motives in departing from their first intentions. Why did they not
confine themselves to the repetition of

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

the experiments, an account of which I had long previously published to
the world, and to test which the expedition was first arranged? That of
sending out a boat for a distance of six miles, and watching its
progress from a fixed point with a good telescope, would have completely
satisfied them as to the true form of the surface of the water; and as
no irregularity in altitudes of signals, nor peculiarities of
instruments, could have influenced the result, all engaged must at once
have submitted to the simple truth as developed by the simplest possible
experiment. That men should cling to complication, and prefer it to
simplicity of action, is difficult to understand, except on the
principle, as it was said of old, "Some love darkness better than
light." It is certain that many are ever ready to contend almost to
death for their mere opinions, who have little or no regard for actual
truth, however important in its bearings or sacred in its character.

These same gentlemen tried another experiment, from which they, quite as
prematurely and illogically as before, drew the conclusion that the
water was convex, and not horizontal.

<span class="small">"A 16-inch Troughton level, accurately adjusted, was
placed in the same position and height above the water as the large
achromatic telescope employed in the last experiment," when the
signal-pole, three miles, and the signal-flag on the bridge, six miles,
away, were seen as shown in the following diagram, fig. 95. A is the
cross-hair, B the signal-disc, and C the signal-flag on the Old Bedford
Bridge. The telescope, D, D, D, carrying the cross-hair A, is on the
bridge at Welney, three miles obverse from B and six from C.</span>

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span id="img_fig95"></span> ![FIG. 95.](img/fig95.jpg.md)  
FIG. 95.

From the above observations, two of the experimenters at once concluded
that the cross-hair in the line of sight was a tangent, and the water
convex--the appearance of B, and C, resulting from the declination of
the surface of the canal. It has been shown already that the best
constructed levelling instruments necessarily produce, from the nature
and arrangement of the lenses, a refraction or divergence of 1-1000th of
a foot in a distance of 10 chains or 660 feet, so that the well-known
and admitted refraction inseparable from the instruments employed, is
fully sufficient to explain the position of the disc at B, and the flag
at C, without demanding that the theory of the earth's rotundity is
thereby corroborated. It is the duty of surveyors, and all who have an
interest in this subject, to carefully study these peculiarities of
levelling instruments, and not only to make themselves thoroughly
acquainted with them, but to acknowledge their influence in every one of
their operations. Should anyone have the slightest doubt of the effect
of lenses in causing divergence of the line of sight, let him simply
provide two

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

instruments of precisely the same construction, except that one shall
have the lenses taken out. It will then be seen that the instrument with
lenses will not read, upon a graduated staff, the same point as that
without them. The latter will give the true reading; and the difference
between this and the reading of the instrument with lenses, is the
amount for which allowance must be made, otherwise the results, however
extensive and important, must be fallacious. <span
id="fr_124"></span>[1](#fn_124.md)

In connection with this part of the subject, it will be useful to
explain what is the cause of the apparent rise of a plane or horizontal
surface towards the axis of the eye.

In the following diagram, fig. 96:---

<span id="img_fig96"></span> ![FIG. 96.](img/fig96.jpg.md)  
FIG. 96.

<span class="small">Let A, B, represent a plane surface--say several
miles over the sea, from the shore, and E, an observer's eye. It is
evident that on looking directly downwards, as from E to A, the real and
the apparent position of the water-surface will be the same. But if a
transparent screen or a plate of glass be erected at some distance from
the eye, as at C, D, and the sight be directed over the water to the
distance W, the line of sight will cut the screen C, D, at the point 1,
and the surface of the water will appear at 3, equal to the altitude of
1. If the sight</span>

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

<span class="small">is now directed to the point X, the line of sight,
E, X, will cut the screen C, D, at the point 2, and the surface of the
water will appear to be elevated to the point 4. It is evident, then,
that the line of sight may be directed further and further over the
water beyond X, and each further line of sight would cut the screen
nearer to the line E, C, H, but could never become perfectly parallel
with it. In the same way the surface of the water would appear nearer
and nearer to the line E, H, at H, but could never come in actual
contact with it: the angle H, E, X, becomes more and more acute as the
distance increases; but, mathematically, the lines E, X, E, H, might be
prolonged *ad infinitum*, the angle C, E, 2, infinitely acute, and the
space H, 4, between the surface of the wafer and the line E, H,
immeasurably small, but actual contact is mathematically impossible.
Although there is always, at great distances, a minute space between the
line of sight and the surface of the water at the horizon, still, for
all practical purposes, and to the naked eye, there is no dip
required.</span>

The above remarks are made considering the water to be still, as if it
were frozen; but as the water of the sea is always in a state of
undulation, it is evident that a line of sight passing over a sea
horizon cannot possibly continue mathematically parallel to the plane of
the water, but must have a minute inclination upwards in the direction
of the zenith. Hence it is that often, when the sun is setting over a
stormy or heavily swelling sea, the phenomenon of sunset begins at a
point on the horizon sensibly less than 90° from the zenith. The same
phenomenon may be observed at sunrise, from any eminence over the sea in
an easterly direction, as from the summit

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

of the Hill of Howth, and the rock called "Ireland's Eye," near Dublin,
looking to the east over Liverpool Bay, in the direction of the coast of
Lancashire. This is illustrated by diagram 97:----

<span id="img_fig97"></span> ![FIG. 97.](img/fig97.jpg.md)  
FIG. 97.

<span class="small">A, D, B, represents the horizontal surface of the
sea, and D 1, and D 2, the optical or apparent ascent of the water
towards the eye-lines O 1, and O 2; O, D, the observer; Z, the zenith;
H, H, the horizon; and S, S, the morning and evening sun. It is obvious
from this diagram that if the water had a fixed character, as when
frozen, the angle Z, O 1, or Z, O 2, would be one of 90 °; but on
account of the waves and breakers at the horizon H, H, mounting half
their altitudes above the lines O 1, and O 2, the line of sight meets
the sun .at S, which appears to rise or set on the elevated horizon H,
the angle Z, O, S, being less than 90°.</span>

This is evidently the cause of the sun setting and rising at sea, later
when the water is calm, and earlier when it is greatly disturbed--a fact
well known to observant sea-going travellers and residents on eastern or
western shores. It is also the cause of the sun rising later and setting
earlier than it would over a smooth plane of earth, or over absolutely
still water, or than it ought to do mathematically for its known
altitude.
