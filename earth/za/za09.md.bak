### EXPERIMENT 4.

On several occasions the six miles of water in the old Bedford Canal
have been surveyed by the so-called "forward" process of levelling,
which consisted in simply taking a sight of, say 20 chains, or 440
yards, noting the point observed, moving the instrument forward to that
point, and taking a second observation; again moving the instrument
forward, again observing 20 chains in advance, and so on throughout the
whole distance. By this process, without making allowance for convexity,
the surface of the water was found to be perfectly horizontal. But when
the result was made known to several surveyors, it was contended "that
when the theodolite is levelled, it is placed at right angles to the
earth's radius--the line of sight from it being a tangent; and that when
it is removed 20 chains forward, and again 'levelled,' it becomes a
second and different tangent; and that indeed every new position is
really a fresh tangent--as shown in the diagram, fig. 9, T 1, T 2, and T
3, representing

FIG. 9.

the theodolite levelled at three different positions, and therefore
square to the radii 1, 2, 3. Hence, levelling forward in this way,
although making no allowance for rotundity, the rotundity or allowance
for it is involved in the process." This is a very ingenious and
plausible argument, by which the visible contradiction between the
theory of rotundity and the results of practical levelling is explained;
and many excellent mathematicians

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

and geodesists have been deceived by it. Logically, however, it will be
seen that it is not a *proof* of rotundity; it is only an explanation or
reconciliation of results with the *supposition* of rotundity, but *does
not prove it to exist*. The following modification was therefore adopted
by the author, in order that convexity, if it existed, might be
demonstrated. A theodolite

FIG. 10.

was placed at the point A, in fig. 10, and levelled; it was then
directed over the flag-staff B to the cross-staff C--the instrument A,
the flag-staff B, and the cross-staff C, having exactly the same
altitude. The theodolite was then advanced to B, the flag-staff to C,
and the cross-staff to D, which was thus secured .as a continuation of
one and the same line of sight A, B, C, prolonged to D, the altitude of
D being the same as that of A, B, and C. The theodolite was again moved
forward to the position C, the flag-staff to D, and the cross-staff to
the point E--the line of sight to which was thus again secured as a
prolongation of A, B, C, D, to E. The process was repeated to F, and
onwards by 20 chain lengths to the end of six miles of the canal, .and
parallel with it. By thus having an object between the theodolite and
the cross-staff, which object in its turn becomes a test or guide by
which the same line of sight is continued throughout the whole length
surveyed, the argument or explanation which is dependent upon the
supposition of rotundity, and that each position of the theodolite is a
different tangent, is completely destroyed. The result of this peculiar
or modified survey, which has been several times repeated, was that the
line of sight and

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

the surface of the water ran parallel to each other; and as the. line of
sight was, in this instance, a right line, the surface of the water for
six miles was demonstrably horizontal.

This mode of forward levelling is so very exact and satisfactory, that
the following further illustration may be given with

<span id="img_fig11"></span> ![](img/fig11.jpg)

advantage. In fig. 11, let A, B, C, represent the first position,
respectively of the theodolite, flag-staff, and cross-staff; B, C, D,
the second position; C, D, E, the third position; and D, E, F, the
fourth; similarly repeated throughout the whole distance surveyed.

The remarks thus made in reference to simple "forward" levelling, apply
with equal force to what is called by surveyors the
"back-and-fore-sight" process, which consists in reading backwards a
distance equal to the distance read forwards. This plan is adopted to
obviate the necessity for calculating, or allowing for the earth's
supposed convexity. It applies, however, just the same in practice,
whether the base or datum line is horizontal or convex; but as it has
been proved to be the former, it is evident that "back-and-fore-sight"
levelling is a waste of time and skill, and altogether unnecessary.
Forward

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

levelling over intervening test or guide staves, as explained by the
diagram, fig. 11, is far superior to any of the ordinary methods, and
has the great advantage of being purely practical§ and not involving any
theoretical considerations. Its adoption along the banks of any canal,
or lake, or standing water of any kind, or even along the shore of any
open sea, will demonstrate to the fullest satisfaction of any practical
surveyor that the surface of all water is horizontal.
