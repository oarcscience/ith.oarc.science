# "PARALLAX" AND HIS TEACHINGS.

### OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.

"TROWBRIDGE MECHANICS' INSTITUTION.--On Monday and Tuesday evenings last
two lectures were delivered by a gentleman adopting the name of
'Parallax,' to prove modern astronomy unreasonable and contradictory:
that the earth is a plane or disc and not a globe, the sun, moon, and
stars, self-luminous, &c., &c. The lectures were well attended, and were
delivered with great skill, the lecturer proving himself thoroughly
acquainted with the subject in all its bearings."--*Wilts Independent*,
*January* 18*th*, 1849.

\[Although "Parallax" had been delivering lectures for several years
previously, in various parts of England, the above was the first notice
which ever appeared in any newspaper.\]

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY \[after details\].--The lecturer is not a theorist,
and the matter is sufficiently important to claim the attention of the
scientific world."--*Liverpool Mercury*, *January* 25*th*, 1850.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--'Parallax' repeated his lectures on this subject
(by permission of the High Sheriff of the county) in the Court House
here, to large and respectable auditories of our townspeople. The nature
of these lectures is extraordinary, explaining that the earth is not a
globe, but a fixed circular plane--that the sun moves in the
firmament--and that, in fact, our present astronomical knowledge is
altogether fallacious and inconsistent with natural phenomena. . . . The
audience listened with the deepest attention, and appeared astonished at
the revelations of the lecturer. At the close of each lecture several
gentlemen entered the lists with 'Parallax,' and a lively and
interesting discussion ensued. 'Parallax,' however, maintained his
principles with infinite tact and ability, and answered his opponents in
a masterly manner. The audiences left strongly impressed

<span id="page_403">p. 403</span>

with the startling facts to which they had been listening--the most
sceptical, at least, philosophising after the manner of Hamlet:--

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

'There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,  
Than are dreamt of in our philosophy.'

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> As to 'Parallax'
himself, we must say that we seldom listened to a more clear,
perspicuous, and convincing lecturer. He is evidently a man of gifted
intellect, and deep scientific attainments. "--*Athlone Sentinel*, *May*
21*st*, 1851.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--'Parallax' has just concluded a second course of
four very interesting lectures, to large and respectable audiences, in
the Court House here \[details follow\]. At the close of each lecture a
very animated discussion took place; and although some very strong
arguments were brought forward, 'Parallax' maintained his ground. We
have seldom met with a lecturer endowed with such strong argumentative
powers who, in language so simple, could present so quickly and clearly
to the mind the ideas he wished to impart. The simple manner in which he
endeavoured to elucidate his subject, and bring it within the
comprehension of his hearers, as well as the good temper and forbearance
displayed during a lengthened discussion with some very able disputants,
called forth a vote of thanks at the conclusion, which was acceded to
without a dissentient voice."--*Westmeath Independent*, *May* 24*th*,
1851.

"During the past week 'Parallax' has visited Preston, and lectured at
the Institution to numerous and respectable audiences. The first was
con-fined to a marshalling of his experiments \[here lengthy details
follow\]. His lectures were delivered in a simple, unassuming style, and
his illustrations and language were of a character to suit the
comprehension of all. He appears to have studied well his subject, to
have made himself master of it in all its details, and to be armed at
all points against those who may enter with him into the lists of
controversy."--*Preston Guardian*, *August* 7*th*, 1852.

"A gentleman adopting the name of 'Parallax' has been delivering
lectures at the Hall on Zetetic Astronomy. The principle he proceeds
upon is to admit of no theories, and to take nothing for granted. He
holds that the earth is not a revolving globe but a fixed plane, and
that the sun moves in the firmament. The lecturer is evidently a
gentleman of deep learning, and is thoroughly in earnest. We understand
that the lectures are about to be re-delivered, and that then the system
will be fully developed."--*Leicester Chronicle*, *June* 3*rd*, 1854.

"We invite the attention of all who feel an interest in subjects of this
kind to these lectures, as, if the statements made by the lecturer in
reference to the heights of distant objects be incontrovertible, they
would seem

<span id="page_404">p. 404</span>

very seriously to invalidate some of the most important conclusions of
modern astronomy."--*Leicester Advertiser*, *June* 3*rd*, 1854.

"In another part of to-day's *Herald* we publish a synopsis of the
lecture on 'Zetetic Astronomy.' We have taken some pains to give the
lecturer's definitions of his philosophy, and mode of illustrating it.
But, inasmuch as the system of the lecturer differs in every point of
view from our own study of astronomy, and from all previous teachings on
the subject, there must be a great error on one side or the other.
'Parallax,' as a lecturer, as a sound logician, clear, lucid reasoner,
calm and self-possessed, we have never seen surpassed."--*Norfolk
Herald*, *November* 1*st*, 1856.

PARALLAX.'--The closing lectures of the series were delivered on Monday
and Wednesday last, and we do not know when we have heard such striking
lessons on the art of reasoning as were afforded by these lectures. As a
reasoner we much question if 'Parallax' can be surpassed; and the
gentlemanly manner in which the discussions were conducted brought out
that power to a very high degree."--*Yarmouth Free Press*, *November*
22*nd*, 1856.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY---THE EARTH NOT A GLOBE--'Parallax' has lectured to
respectable and critical audiences in the new room, Corn Exchange. No
one could fail to admire his power as a disputant. After the lectures he
met the questions put to him by the most enlightened and scientific
citizens with a readiness of reply which astonished his hearers; and he
challenged to meet any of them on the points raised, and would stand or
fall. by the issue depending on facts; but no one accepted his
challenge. Report states that he will visit Ely again, when no doubt
there will be a full room. Lecturers on the Newtonian system, with their
apparatus, orreries, &c., completely fail to interest the people here.
'Parallax' has the ability to do this; he met even the 'sledge-hammer'
of Mr. Burns with only a gentlemanly retort."--*Cambridge Chronicle*,
*December* 27*th*, 1856.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--Three lectures were delivered on Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday evenings last, at the Lecture Hall in this town,
by a gentleman adopting the name of 'Parallax,' to prove modern
astronomy unreasonable and contradictory--that the earth is a plane, or
a disc, and not a globe--the sun, moon, and stars, self-luminous, &c.,
&c. The lectures were delivered in a manner which could not fail to be
comprehended, and which left no doubt that the lecturer was thoroughly
acquainted with the subject he was discussing. We have seldom heard a
man with stronger argumentative powers, sounder logic, or more
convincive reasoning. The revelations of the lecturer appeared to
completely astound his audiences, who, for the greater part, left with a
strong impression that the previous teachers of astronomy must have been
greatly in error. 'Parallax' is undoubtedly

<span id="page_405">p. 405</span>

a gentleman of no mean intellect, and must have studied deeply to have
reached such scientific attainments."--*Croydon Chronicle*, *January*
24*th*, 1857.

\[After report.\] "The unquestionable ability with which 'Parallax' has
met his opponents has drawn forth much applause."--*Leicestershire
Mercury*, *August* 14*th*, 1858.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--No doubt many of our readers have been mystified
and surprised within the last week by the announcement that, in three
lectures, at the Northampton Mechanics' Institute, a gentleman who calls
himself 'Parallax,' would undertake to prove the earth not a globe, &c.,
&c. . . . We were highly gratified by the manner in which this important
subject was handled by 'Parallax'--a pseudonym which the lecturer
informed his audience he had adopted in order to avert the effect of an
insinuation that his startling announcement is but the morbid desire of
an individual to be known as the propounder of a philosophy boldly at
variance with that of the great astronomers of the past and present. His
subject was handled in a plain and easy manner, his language and
allusions proving him a man of education and thought, and certainly not
a pedant. The experiments mentioned, divested of technicality in their
recital, and understandable by all, were of such a nature as to cause a
start of surprise at their simplicity and truthfulness. . . . It is not
for us to pronounce a verdict upon so important an issue; 'Parallax' may
be in error, but as far as his reasonings from fact and experiment go,
there is much to set scientific men thinking. His arguments consist of
facts, and such as are patent to all degrees of mental capacity. . . .
In the discussions which followed, 'Parallax' certainly lost no ground,
either in answer to questions or to some broad assertions quoted from
learned authorities."--*South Mid-land Free Press*, *August* 14*th*,
1858.

"While Lord Brougham, Professor Owen, and Dr. Whewell, have been
assisting at the inauguration of the statue of Sir Isaac Newton, at
Grantham, 'Parallax' has been startling the good people of Coventry by
blotting the face of fair Mother Earth, declaring her long respected
rotundity a modern fable. . . . This is not the age for intolerance and
bigotry with respect to science; new discoveries and new lights are
treated with respect from whatever quarter they may emanate, and if
'Parallax' can make good his pretensions, his name will be immortalised
by posterity. . . . We thank 'Parallax' for exciting an interest in the
subject of astronomy which perhaps lecturers, according to the received
hypothesis, would have failed to create."--*Coventry Herald*, *October*
1*st*, 1858.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--In this glorious nineteenth century, the boasted
age of progress and reform, in which the strides of intellect are so
rapidly

<span id="page_406">p. 406</span>

approaching perfection, we cannot be surprised that such a beautiful
system of Zetetic Astronomy as that expounded by 'Parallax' should
entirely supersede the doctrine taught by Newton, and more especially
when we are told that this Zetetic system is the only one which is
consistent with common sense, and agreeable with the records contained
in the Holy Scriptures. Now if this statement be true, all the readers
of the 'Free Press' will agree in giving this philosophy a hearty
welcome."--Coventry Free Press, October 1st, 1858.

"ZETETIC PHILOSOPHY.--During the past week four lectures have been
delivered at our Institution, Royal Hill, which are to be continued on
four evenings next week. To say that these lectures are extraordinary in
their character is but saying the least that can possibly be said
concerning them. The exceedingly gifted lecturer, who apparently prefers
to be known as 'Parallax,' demonstrates the Newtonian theory of
astronomy to be in opposition to facts; and in so doing demonstrates
that the Bible is literally true in its philosophical teachings. From
this, the groundwork of his philosophy, spring teachings and doctrines
which cause us to hold our breath in the contemplation of them, and
compel us, as public journalists, to withhold our opinion on subjects so
vast, so important to man, and so utterly at variance with the commonly
received notions of the day. Is it for us to say that a greater than a
Newton shall not arise? No! we wait the issue. If 'Parallax' be wrong
there can be nothing easier than for our savans of Greenwich to
overthrow his doctrines; but if our readers think they would have an
easy task so to do, we can only say be present at his concluding
lectures, and judge for yourselves. . . . It is urged that this
'somebody or other' who has the audacity to come right into Greenwich,
above all places in the enlightened world, is very strong--strong in his
facts, strong in his arguments, and appears after all to get on the
right side of his audiences. This much we do know, that there are
thinking men in our town who have been compelled to bend to the
overpowering weight of evidence against our modern ideas. If it be true
that some have tried to overthrow him and yet failed, let them go again,
and still again, and nip this growth in the bud, ere a giant oak arises
which will scorn their science and defy their teachings."--*Greenwich
Free Press*, *May* 11*th* 1861.

"'PARALLAX' AT THE LECTURE HALL.--This talented lecturer is again in
Greenwich, rivetting the attention of his audiences, and compelling them
to submit to the facts which he brings before them--we say submit, for
this they do; it seems impossible for any one to battle with him, so
powerful are the weapons he uses. Mathematicians argue with him at the
conclusion of his lectures, but it would seem as though they held their

<span id="page_407">p. 407</span>

weapons by the blade and fought with the handle, for sure enough they
put the handle straight into the lecturer's hand, to their own utter
discomfiture and chagrin. It remains yet to be seen whether any of our
Royal Astronomers will have courage enough to meet him in discussion, or
whether they will quietly allow him to give the death-blow to the
Newtonian theory, and make converts of our townspeople to his own
Zetetic philosophy. If 'Parallax' be *wrong*, for Heaven's sake let some
of our Greenwich stars twinkle at the Hall, and dazzle, confound, or
eclipse altogether this wandering one, who is turning men, all over
England, out of the Newtonian path. 'Parallax' is making his hearers
disgusted with the Newtonian and every other *theory*, and turning them
to a consideration of facts and first principles, from which they know
not how to escape. Again we beg and trust that some of our Royal
Observatory gentlemen will try to save us, and prevent anything like a
Zetetic epidemic prevailing amongst us."--*Greenwich Free Press*, *May*
19*th*, 1862.

"EARTH NOT A GLOBE.--On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, 'Parallax'
delivered his lectures at the Chatham Lecture Hall. The science he sets
forth he denominates 'Zetetic Astronomy.' Whatever his hearers may think
of his philosophy, they must admit that his lectures show him to have
read and thought much. His discourses are very pleasing and interesting,
and he expounds his doctrines in a way that ought to offend none. The
variety of questions which a number of gentlemen asked the lecturer were
readily and courteously answered, and in a way which appeared to satisfy
most of the questioners. The audiences got so interested in these
discussions that it was midnight before all the arguers left. They
evidently took the deepest interest in the subjects presented to them.
Next week 'Parallax' is to give more lectures, as announced in our
advertising columns."--*Chatham News*, *June* 6*th*, 1863.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--It will be seen, on reference to our advertising
columns, that 'Parallax' will repeat his course of three lectures. He
has deeply interested the public, and has had full audiences. We defer
giving our opinion until the whole series of lectures have been given.
Certainly Parallax' is a man of strong argumentative powers, sound
logic, and convincing reasoning."--*Rochester and Chatham Journal*,
*June* 6*th*, 1863.

"There is a startling novelty in store for the scientific men of London.
One who calls himself 'Parallax' wields a battle-axe against the present
astronomical theories, giving lectures to the effect that the earth is
not a globe but a fixed circular plane \[particulars follow\].
'Parallax' has moved in the best provincial circles, but his orbit has
hitherto been distant from London."--*Court Journal*, *April* 9*th*,
1864.

"THE EARTH NOT A GLOBE.--We beg to direct attention to the second

<span id="page_408">p. 408</span>

course of lectures now being delivered by 'Parallax' at the Society's
Hall. Those who take an interest in this scientific subject would be
much enlightened by hearing the views of the lecturer, which are given
in a clear and logical manner, and carry conviction with
them."--*Portsmouth Guardian*, *April* 21*st*, 1864.

"THE WORLD WE LIVE IN.--We invite the attention of our readers to the
remarkable lectures being delivered by a gentleman adopting the name of
'Parallax,' with illustrations, explaining that the earth is not a globe
but a fixed circular plane, and that the sun actually moves in the
firmament. These lectures contain a vast amount of deep scientific
research, and proclaim 'Parallax' a man of varied and solid attainments.
He has well and completely concatenated his subject, and appears master
of his position."--*Weekly Mail*, *May* 23*rd*, 1864.

"'PARALLAX' AND HIS TEACHINGS.--No one can doubt that 'Parallax' has
made a hit at Gosport, and has created quite a sensation. The Zetetic
philosopher is an able reasoner; concede but his first point, skilfully
put, and you stand no chance against his fifteen years' platform
experience. For three nights \[details follow\]. During these
discussions 'Parallax' has not always had fair play; as may well be
supposed there is a degree of prejudice against his teachings, and hot
words have ensued. On Wednesday the arguments lasted until after
midnight."--*Gosport Free Press*, *May* 14*th*, 1864.

"EARTH NOT A GLOBE.--Last evening the gentleman bearing the *nom de
plume* of 'Parallax' delivered at the Athenæum the first of a series of
lectures to prove the fallacy of the Newtonian principles regarding the
rotundity of the earth. There was a very large attendance, every seat in
the place being occupied, and many who could not obtain sitting room
stood, filling up the whole of the available space in the hall. A
chairman was elected, as it was expected there would be a hot discussion
on so striking a subject. The lecturer commenced his discourse by \[here
lengthy details follow\]. At the conclusion of the lecture a very
animated discussion ensued between many gentlemen of the town and the
lecturer, and we must say that he was a good match for his
opponents."--*Western Daily Mercury*, *September* 27*th*, 1864.

"The second lecture of this series was delivered last evening. The hall
was crammed to excess--in fact, many were unable to obtain admission.
The lecturer briefly recapitulated a portion of his previous lecture. He
went through the whole of the syllabus, amidst constant interruption,
with the best possible temper, making his subject extremely interesting,
and handling it in such an able manner as to elicit loud and frequent
applause. Before the lecture was concluded it was quite evident, judging
from the

<span id="page_409">p. 409</span>

feelings exhibited by the majority of the audience, that 'Parallax' had
impressed many of them with the truth of his ideas. It cannot be denied
that he treats his subject in a very clever and ingenuous manner, and
succeeds in drawing many over to agree with him. "--*Western Daily
Mercur*y, *September* 28*th*, 1864.

"The third of the above series of lectures was delivered last evening.
The subject underwent a long and warm discussion, and the questions
which were put to the lecturer were answered with a great degree of
ingenuity. Upon the suggestion of a gentleman present, the lecturer said
that, in conjunction with other gentlemen, he would be happy to make any
experiments to ascertain the truth or fallacy of his teachings. This, we
believe, will be acted upon, it being purposed to visit the Breakwater
and the Eddystone Lighthouse, and there make the necessary observations,
which no doubt will prove very interesting."--*Western Daily Mercury*,
*September* 30*th*, 1864.

"'PARALLAX' ON ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--Last evening the lecturer who has
adopted this *nom de plume* gave his first lecture at the Athenæum. . .
. The hall was crowded by a respectable audience. He laid before his
hearers an entertaining, instructing, and very plausible collection of
facts, upon which he based the deduction that the world was not an
oblate spheroid, but a plane. The details were illustrated by diagrams,
that were interestingly explained, in aid of his arguments; and when, in
response to invitation, several gentlemen of experience, as nautical men
and in the survey of land, questioned his opinions, and advanced strong
antagonistic reasons, the replies were both clever and courteous. It was
much regretted that very warm feeling was manifested by some of the
auditors. . . . The lecturer was frequently applauded. He lectures again
this evening, and there can be no doubt that the audience will be a
numerous one, for in his lectures much unquestioned but valuable
information is incidentally introduced, and much argument that is
singularly difficult of controversion."--*Western Daily News*,
*September* 27*th*, 1864.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--During the current week three lectures have been
delivered at the Athenæum, Plymouth, which have excited not a little
commotion among the learned of our fellow-citizens. The lecturer, who
has adopted 'Parallax' as the name by which he would be known among the
scientific, commenced his course of lectures on Monday last, the
building being crowded with an attentive and, we may add, a critical
audience. The subject which was introduced that evening, 'Earth not a
Globe,' was one calculated to excite attention in the minds of the
philosophers or deep-thinkers of the present day, and as such the
lecturer was evidently prepared to meet with opposition \[details\]. We
are bound to admit that he

<span id="page_410">p. 410</span>

handled his subject with consummate skill; and, whether he is right or
wrong, we must do him the justice to acknowledge that he possesses all
the great qualities which characterise a lecturer and a
debater--consistently maintaining those principles which he holds to be
correct, founded, as he proves them to be, upon the great Word of Truth,
as established ere time began its course among men. We cannot attempt
even an outline of the lectures: we have simply to record the facts that
each lecture drew a very crowded assembly; that after each lecture an
animated discussion took place, in which many gentlemen bore part; and
we are free to express our conviction, without committing ourselves to
an absolute belief in the doctrines enunciated, that 'Parallax' proved
himself to be equal to the contest on which he had entered. All must
admit the lecturer to have shown that his studies and his researches
have been deep, powerful, and enduring."--*Plymouth Herald and United
Service Journal*, *October* 6*th*, 1864.

"PARALLAX AT DEVONPORT.--On Wednesday evening last the gentleman
adopting this cognomen, and who has been creating a great deal of
interest in this locality during the last few weeks, commenced a series
of lectures at the Devonport Mechanics' Institute. The reasoning of
'Parallax,' which he has termed Zetetic, is so astounding and
diametrically opposed to the great Newtonian theory which has obtained
in the world for hundreds of years, that he has often been ridiculed as
a crude experimentalist, abused as a false teacher, and even accused of
mendacity. He has borne these harsh expressions and ungentlemanly
imputations calmly and patiently; and it is but just to say that, in his
lectures, he has always courted the fullest inquiry--stating that his
only object is the elucidation of truth, no matter what it may be or
what it may lead to; and that in his discussions he is courteous in
hearing and candid in expression. That he is a clever man, and that he
has studied his subject deeply, there can be no possible doubt; and it
is certainly the case, whether he is right or wrong, that his arguments
are exceedingly plausible, and that he has much the better of his
opponents in discussion. Unfortunately those who have entered into
discussion with him have in nine cases out of ten become excited and
lost their command, while 'Parallax,' remaining cool and calculating,
has thus, apart from his demonstrations, been enabled to gain an
advantage over them in reasoning. On this occasion the discussion became
very warm, and ungracious imputations were made, which 'Parallax' said
resulted from a fear to face the consequences resulting from new and
true ideas. The demeanour, respectful bearing, and candour of 'Parallax'
bear out his assertions that his object is the elucidation of truth; and
he appeals to his audience to disprove his statements, while he
undertakes to prove them to

<span id="page_411">p. 411</span>

be true. He is fair in every way, and it is unjust, nay, it is something
worse, to treat with disrespect a lecturer of this character."

"The lectures will be repeated next week, and as public discussion is
invited at the end of each lecture, we hope it will be conducted
temperately and with proper spirit. Meanwhile we claim, in justice to
'Parallax,' that no unjust erroneous prejudicial notions be formed of
him without a hearing."--*Devonport Independent*, *October* 15*th*,
1864.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--\[After details.\] We can tell our readers that
'Parallax' is a practised lecturer, a good speaker, a clever debater,
and a courteous opponent. He has a plausible manner, and is thoroughly
'posted' in the standard philosophy as well as the system which he
teaches, and is therefore no mean antagonist. Students of science may
break a lance with him, but judging from his meetings at Gloucester and
Stroud, we should say that an ordinary man is no match for
him."--*Stroud Journal*, *October* 28*th*, 1865.

"A conclave of scientific gentlemen sat to get up a reply, and just one
of the number was able to state the answer: even that answer, scientific
as it was, had a fallacy in it."--*Spectator*, *April* 12*th*, 1856.

"The lecturer gained great praise for his ingenuity in proving that the
earth is a plane surrounded by ice. . . The evidence that the earth is
round is but cumulative and circumstantial."--*Professor de Morgan,
Cambridge University*.

"'PARALLAX' ON ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--The gentleman who has adopted this
noon de plume delivered his first lecture on Monday evening last There
was a large and highly respectable audience--the hall being crowded. The
lecture was a clear and elaborate exposition, &c. \[lengthy details
follow\]. If we may judge by the applause by which some of the
lecturer's arguments were confirmed, we should say that many of those
present were ready to exclaim: 'Behold, a greater than Newton is here!'
A hot discussion followed, in which the Rev. Nixon Porter and other
gentlemen took part, but Parallax' maintained his ground."--*Warrington
Guardian*, *March* 24*th*, 1866.

"EARTH NOT A GLOBE.--On Monday last a gentleman adopting the *nom de
plume* of 'Parallax'--a very appropriate name, seeing that the basis of
his arguments is the relation to each other of parallel lines--commenced
a series of lectures at the Public Hall on 'Zetetic Astronomy,' a system
directly opposed to the great Newtonian theory. That he is a clever man,
and has studied the matter deeply, and that he is master of his subject,
and thoroughly convinced of its truth, is apparent; and his arguments
are certainly very plausible. The lecture drew large audiences, and
among those present we noticed \[here a list is given of many of the
leading men

<span id="page_412">p. 412</span>

and families of the district\]. 'Parallax' commenced by explaining the
word 'Zetetic,' which had been adopted, because they did not sit in
their closets and endeavour to frame a theory to explain certain
phenomena, but went abroad into the world, and thoroughly investigated
the subject \[here follows a long report of the three lectures\].
Lengthy and animated discussions ensued; votes of thanks were passed to
the lecturer and the chairman--the Rev. Nixon Porter, who declared that
he was much struck with the simplicity and candour with which the
lecturer had stated his views; and, after a promise by 'Parallax' that
he would pay another visit to Warrington, the audience
dispersed."--*Warrington Advertiser*, *March* 24*th*, 1866.

"THE EARTH NOT A GLOBE.--Lectures on the above subject were de-livered
this week in the Royal Assembly Room, Great George-street, Liverpool, by
'Parallax,' a gentleman known to the literary world by a work on
'Zetetic Astronomy,' and who came somewhat prominently before the
Liverpool public fourteen or fifteen years ago through the columns of
the Mercury. The hall was well filled by respectable and critical
audiences. He commenced his first lecture by comparing the Newtonian
principle of astronomy with the Zetetic (which must prove all and take
nothing for granted); and endeavoured to demonstrate in a comprehensive
and logical manner that the earth is not a globe but a plane; that, in
fact, all theories of the earth's rotundity are fallacious, and that the
followers of Newton and other philosophers had been adopting and
believing a 'cunningly devised fable.' The lectures were illustrated by
numerous diagrams and experiments, and were listened to with the
greatest attention by all present. 'Parallax' appears to have studied
the peculiarities of his subject thoroughly, and was warmly applauded
during the delivery of his lectures."--*Liverpool Mercury*, *October*
3*rd*, 1866.

At the end of a detailed report of lectures at the Halifax Mechanics'
Hall it is stated:--"Whatever may be the truth or otherwise of the new
system, certain it is that the lectures were well attended, and numbers
of the audiences declared themselves converts."--*Halifax Guardian*,
*April* 13*th*, 1867.

"Coming to the facts of 'Parallax.' They are upon the whole admirably
dealt with. . He exhibits an immense number of diagrams, and explains
them with great ingenuity."--*Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer*,
*May* 2*nd*, 1867.

"The Philosophical Hall last night was crowded with a thoughtful
audience attracted by the formidable propositions which the lecturer
enunciates and defends \[particulars here follow\]. These and similar
extraordinary statements so utterly at variance with the recognised
theories of the

<span id="page_413">p. 413</span>

day, the lecturer maintains with a perspicuity and mastery of his
subject which carries the audience to some extent along with him, and
induces them to manifest symptoms of scientific unbelief."--*Leeds
Mercury*, *May* 8*th*, 1867.

"Without endorsing 'Parallax's' teachings, it must be said that (at the
Philosophical Hall, Leeds) he advanced them, supported them, and fought
for them with a skill and intelligence, tact, and good temper which were
not at all equalled by his opponents."--*Leeds Times*, *May* 11*th*,
1867.

"He displays in his lectures a thorough acquaintance with the Newtonian
philosophy, and presents his own peculiar views in such a way that they
assume great plausibility and astonish his hearers. At the close of each
lecture discussion is permitted, in the course of which 'Parallax'
exhibits great debating tact and power; his answers to his opponents
being frequently loudly applauded."--*Leeds Evening Express*, *May*
23*rd*, 1867.

"ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.--His lectures furnish a clear, masterly, and very
plausible exposition of his system. At the close of each lecture he
invited discussion; and it must be admitted that 'Parallax' evinced
varied knowledge, ability, and readiness in replying to
objections."--*Bradford Review*, July 6th, 1867.

"'PARALLAX' AT BRADFORD.--So long have astronomers averred the earth's
rotundity and its motion round the sun, that when 'Parallax' was
announced to lecture we went to see the man who had ventured to
controvert facts so long settled by the most *recherché* students in
celestial science. To our surprise every position taken seemed fortified
with keen logical reasoning, and an easy explanation was given of many
of the tests previously considered absolute proofs of the earth's
rotundity. The lecturer contends \[particulars are here given\]. By many
illustrations he disproved this rotundity, and astonished his audiences
by showing how little there is to be relied on in what has been hitherto
received as demonstration itself. 'Parallax' is unquestionably a very
acute reasoner, a paragon of courtesy, good temper, and masterly skill
in debate; and, by his frank and ingenuous manner, won largely on the
convictions of his audience. Seldom have we seen an assembly so much
absorbed in their subject; and the interest was maintained to the close.
We feel it due to say that, if the data given are correct, there is no
resisting the conclusions arrived at."--*Bradford Advertiser*, *July*
6*th* and 13*th*, 1867.

"The lecturer invited discussion, and a warm controversy took place, but
'Parallax' stood his ground admirably. His delivery is free and
unaffected, and the masterly style in which he handled his subject
showed that he was a geometrician and mathematician of no ordinary
merit."--*Dewsbury Chronicle*, *August* 5*th*, 1867.

"'PARALLAX' AT BIRSTAL.--This gentleman delivered his course of lectures
in the Public Hall here on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday last
\[particulars here follow\]. The lecturer thoroughly understands the
subject which he has taken in hand. He is gifted with extraordinary
debating power and acumen, and the manner in which he dealt with the
subject also proved him to be well versed in all the sciences bearing
upon his system of astronomy. His style of delivery, too, is one
calculated to win the sympathies of an audience."--*Birstal Record*,
*August* 10*th*, 1867.

"THE EARTH A PLANE.--\[Report of lecture at the Town Hall, Hanley,
concludes as follows\]:--A contemporary speaks of 'Parallax' as a very
acute reasoner, a paragon of courtesy, good temper, and masterly skill
in debate, adding that if the data given are correct there is no
resisting the conclusions arrived at. Apart from these conclusions, to
which he seems to lead most of his hearers in spite of themselves, the
lectures are really an intellectual treat."--Staffordshire Sentinel,
February 8th, 1868.

"'Parallax' has just repeated his lectures in Warrington, which were
presided over by the Rev. Nixon Porter, Alderman Holmes, ex-Mayor, and
P. Rylands, Esq., M.P. The lecturer was introduced by the first-named
gentleman as no stranger to Warrington, having visited them on former
occasions, given our scientific men some pretty hard nuts to crack, had
made certain statements and drawn certain inferences which, to say the
least, were plausible, and demanded fair consideration. Any man should
be fairly heard when he stood upon the foundation of truth, and braved
the opposition which was invariably incurred when the current modes of
thought were attacked and attempted to be controverted. If the
lecturer's statements were false, by all means let them be exploded;
but, if true, let us thankfully receive them and all their consequences,
giving to their zealous expounder the credit to which he is entitled.
Questions such as those brought before the meeting should be fully
considered and discussed. On introducing the lecturer on the third
evening, the chairman (P. Rylands, Esq., M.P.) concluded his address as
follows: 'Every philosophical inquiry which challenged contradiction
must have a good effect in causing them to think of the various natural
phenomena by which they were surrounded, thus improving their minds,
increasing the strength of their understandings, and adding to the
general intelligence of the people.' The lecturer, on rising, in reply
to the oft-repeated question which had been put to him as to the good or
use of his particular system of astronomy, even admitting it to be the
true one, would say that, at the least, it was of great importance to a
large commercial and mercantile nation such as ours, in correcting,
improving, and rendering more practical and safe the art of navigation,
on which the prosperity of the country so much depended. It was also a

<span id="page_415">p. 415</span>

most important religious question--one scarcely second to any other
religious question of the day. At present there was a great battle going
on between religious and scientific men, the former upholding the truth
of the Scriptures, and the latter believing in nothing but their own
philosophy, which was in direct opposition to Scriptural teachings.
Thousands of men at the present day declared the Scriptural astronomical
expressions to be false, and regarded science and philosophy as all in
all. One or the other must be false; both could not stand. If they were
all simply dogs they might 'bow-wow' together, and think nothing more of
the matter; but as they were men, endowed with sense and reason, the
importance of the subject presented itself to them in all its intensity.
If the earth was a globe, and the principles of modern astronomy were
true, religious teaching could not be reconciled to such a state of
things, and must consequently be false; but if, on the other hand,
modern astronomy could be proved to be false, then would the religious
philosophy stand forth as a grand reality, and show itself as the
communicated expression of some great master of the universe. He had a
few words to say to the so-called 'free-thinkers' of the day; those
especially who prided themselves upon having become sceptical in matters
of religion. He would have them to take care that the word
'free-thinker' was not misapplied. It was very possible, and not an
uncommon thing, for a person to become as great a bigot in this respect
as in any other. A free-thinker was not necessarily an atheist or even a
sceptic; he might or might not be so, but he might also be a lover of
true religion and a good Christian. He alone was a true free-thinker who
was prepared to seek out and to hold fast to all the practical truths
developed by human experience. He (the lecturer) had the deepest respect
for those who could leave the old theoretical 'ruts' of thought, and
dare to freely inquire for themselves into every subject, but he could
not do other than pity and almost despise all those who profess to be
'truth-seekers' and 'free-thinkers,' and who yet will only use their
powers for the promotion of religious scepticism. The man who refused
evidence simply because it might lead him back to a recognition of
Scriptural philosophy, and to seeing the necessity for a religious or
devotional life, was neither wise nor good, but was indeed a bigot in
the fullest sense of the term. The lecturer then proceeded to explain"
\[lengthy details follow\].--See *Warrington Guardian* of *September*
36*th* and 19*th*, and *Warrington Advertiser and Mail* of *September*
19*th*, 1868.

"WESTBOURNE HALL.--By special desire, such was the interest taken in the
propositions advanced, 'Parallax' was induced to repeat his three
lectures, the first of which was delivered on Thursday evening last to a
numerous and appreciative audience. . . . Although we must be

<span id="page_416">p. 416</span>

understood as not endorsing all, yet he said enough to puzzle the most
inveterate Newtonian philosopher present. . . . The lecture was amply
illustrated by diagrams, without which it is impossible to do justice to
the able remarks of the lecturer. . . . An animated discussion, which at
times was rather irregular, took place; some of the gentlemen who
entered the arena betraying more animus than ability. The lecturer
replied readily to the various objections of his opponents; and, judging
by the clamorous approval of the audience, he seemed to have gained the
attention of many who were not disposed to look favourably on the claims
of what is termed 'Zetetic Astronomy.'"--*Notting Hill and Bayswater
Times*, *November* 13*th*, 1869.

"The flat earth floating tremulously on the sea, the sun moving always
over it, giving day when near enough, and night when too far off; the
self-luminous moon, with a semi-transparent invisible moon created to
give her an eclipse now and then; the new law of perspective, by which
the vanishing of the hull before the masts, usually thought to prove the
earth globular, *really proves it flat*; all these and other things are
well fitted to form exercises in learning the elements of astronomy.
'Parallax,' though confident in the extreme, neither impeaches the
honesty of those whose opinions he assails, nor allots them any future
inconvenience."--*Augustus De Morgan, Professor of Mathematics in
Cambridge University, President of the Royal Astronomical Society,
F.R.A.S., &c., &c.*--*Athenæum Journal* for *October* 12, 1872.
