### EXPERIMENT 15.

From the first floor of the "grand" hotel, opposite the new or western
pier, at Brighton, in Sussex, a well-constructed instrument, called a
"Clinometer," was "levelled," and directed towards the sea. The water
seemed to ascend as an inclined plane, until it intercepted the line of
sight at the point H 1, as shown in fig. 44. On taking the instrument to
a higher

position, again "levelling," and looking over the sea, the surface
seemed to ascend a second time, until it met the eye-line at H 2. The
instrument was then taken to the highest room, and again directed to the
sea, when the uprising surface was again seen to meet the eye-line, as
at the point H 3 As already shown, these results are precisely those
which an optical or perspective law produces, in connection with a right
line, or a plane surface. Upon a globular surface, the appearance would
necessarily be as seen in fig. 45. From the position A, the

horizon would be seen at H 1, and at a considerable angle downwards;
from B, the horizon would be at H 2; and from C, at II 3; and the
downward angle, or "dip," would increase as the altitude of the observer
increased. But as nothing of the kind is anywhere to be seen, and the
directly contrary at all times visible, we are compelled by the force of
practical evidence to deny the existence of rotundity, and to declare
that, "to all intents and purposes," absolutely and logically, beyond
doubt, THE EARTH IS A VAST IRREGULAR PLANE.
