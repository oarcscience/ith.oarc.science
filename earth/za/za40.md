### ARCS OF THE MERIDIAN.

The discrepancies and anomalies so often observed in pendulum
experiments, have led the followers of Newton to seek the desired
evidence in measurements of arcs of the meridian; but here again they
are even more unfortunate than in their efforts with the pendulum. It is
certain that the question when attempted to be answered by such
measurements, is less satisfactory than was expected, and in many
respects the results are contradictory.

<span class="small">"The determination of the exact figure of the earth
(M. Biot remarks) has, for the last century and a half, been one of the
constant aims of the labours of the French Academy of Sciences. From the
time of the first measure of a degree by Picard, which enabled Newton to
establish the law of universal gravitation, the highest efforts of
astronomy and analysis have been directed to the consolidation of all
the elements of that great phenomenon; and to the development of all the
consequences, which they allow us to draw, not only as to the figure,
but also as to the interior condition of the terrestrial
spheroid."</span>

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

Notwithstanding that every possible phase of human ingenuity has been
brought to bear on this operation, which was expected to furnish
positive proof of the Newtonian assumptions, the whole has been,
geodetically and mathematically, a provoking failure. This will be
evident from the following explanation of the process adopted, and
quotations of opinions respecting it:--

<span class="small">"If we conceive a great circle in the heavens, the
360 radii of which converge towards and meet in the centre of the earth,
this will be the normal circle by which true degrees are, and alone can
be, determined on the terrestrial surface, intersected by those radii.
Practically the points of intersection are determined by the plumb-line.
Supposing now the earth to be a perfect sphere, . . . all plumb-lines or
normals prolonged would meet in the earth's centre, and consequently
coincide with the radii of the normal circle, determining in a direct
manner true degrees on the terrestrial surface; and therefore *assuming*
the figure of the earth to slightly deviate from that of a perfect
sphere, it is natural to conclude, without a positive proof or reason to
the contrary, that the plumb-lines would continue to be directed to the
earth's centre all the same. [Astronomy](errata.htm#8.md), however, not
only without any proof or reason whatever, *assumes* that they do not;
but, moreover, starting on the *assumption* that the *imaginary shape*
lent to the earth by Sir Isaac Newton's theory, is its *real shape*,
gives to the plumb-lines such imaginary directions as are needed in
order to adopt the empirical results of geodetic measurements to the
earth's *imagined form*. . . . That the direction of the plumb-lines or
normals to any given point on the earth's surface is perpendicular to a
tangent to that point, or to the plane of its horizon is, as I have
already shown, and as appears also</span>

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

<span class="small">distinctly from Sir John Herschel's own words, *a
mere assumption*, unsupported by even the shadow of a reason; for what
possible connection can there be between the positive force or 'law of
nature' which determines the directions of the plumb-line, and the
imaginary line and plane, which astronomers term 'a tangent' and 'the
horizon?'" <span id="fr_102"></span>[1](#fn_102.md)</span>

The actual results. of these repeated efforts will be seen in the
following quotations. In the ordnance survey of Great Britain, which was
conducted by the Duke of Richmond, Colonel Mudge, General Roy, Mr. Dalby
and others, base lines were measured on Hounslow Heath and Salisbury
Plain, with glass rods and steel chains; "when these were connected by a
chain of triangles and the length computed, the result did not differ
more than one inch from the actual measurements--a convincing proof of
the accuracy with which all the operations had been conducted. The two
stations of Beachy Head in Sussex, and Dunnose in the Isle of Wight, are
visible from each other, and more than sixty-four miles asunder, nearly
in a direction from east to west, their exact distance was found by the
geodetical operations to be 339,397 feet (sixty-four miles and 1477
feet). The azimuth, or bearing of the line between them with respect to
the meridian, and also the latitude of Beachy Head, were determined by
astronomical observations. From these data the length of a degree
perpendicular to the meridian was computed, and this, compared with the
length of a meridional degree in the same latitude, gave the proportion
of the polar to the equatorial axis. The result thus obtained, however,
*differed considerably* 

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

from that obtained by meridional degrees. It has been found *impossible
to explain the want of agreement in a satisfactory way*. . . . By
comparing the celestial with the terrestrial arcs, the length of degrees
in various parallels was determined as in the following table:

</div>

Notwithstanding the "accuracy with which all the operations had been
conducted," the skill and ingenuity and perfection of the instruments
employed were such that after measuring base lines far apart and
triangulating from summit to summit of the hills, between the stations
the actually measured and the mathematically calculated results "did not
differ more than one inch." Such exactitude was never scarcely
contemplated, and certainly could not be surpassed, if at all equalled,
by the ordnance officers or practical surveyors of any other country in
the world; and yet they failed to corroborate the assumption of polar
depression or diminution in the axial radius of the earth. "For instead
of the degrees *increasing* as we proceed from

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

north to south, they appear to *decrease*, as if the earth were an
*oblong* instead of an *oblate* spheroid." <span
id="fr_104"></span>[1](#fn_104.md)

The fallacy involved in all the attempts to prove the oblate spheroidal
form of the earth, is, that the earth is first assumed to be a globe,
the celestial surface above it to be concave, and the plumb-lines to be
radii. If this were the true condition of things, then all the degrees
of latitude would be the same in length; and if the earth were really
"flattened at the poles," the degrees would certainly shorten in going
from the equator towards the north. If, however, the celestial surface
is not concave, but horizontal, two plumb-lines suspended north and
south of each other would be parallel, and would indicate equal length
in all the degrees of latitude, thereby spewing the earth to be parallel
with the celestial surface, and therefore a plane. The differences
required by a globe are not found in practice, but such as a plane would
produce are invariably found. Hence the failure of geodesy becomes
evidence against rotundity, but demonstrating that the earth is parallel
to the horizontal heavens, and therefore of mathematical and logical
necessity A PLANE. It is ever the case, when falsehood is tested in the
crucible of experiment, that its value is diminished or destroyed,
whilst the contrary is the case with truth, which, like gold, the more
intense the fire of criticism the more brilliant it appears.

<span class="small">"When we come to compare the measures of meridional
arcs made in various parts of the earth, the results obtained exhibit
discordances far greater than what we have shown to be attributable to
error of observation, and which render it</span>

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

evident that the hypothesis (of flattened rotundity) in strictness of
its wording is untenable. The lengths of the degree of the meridian were
astronomically determined from actual measurement made with all possible
care and precision, by commissioners of various nations, men of the
first eminence, supplied by their respective governments with the best
instruments, and furnished with every facility which could tend to
ensure a successful result." <span id="fr_105"></span>[1](#fn_105.md)

The first recorded measurement of a degree of latitude is that by
Eratosthenes, 230 B.C.

It may be interesting to state here a few of the instances of the great
care and accuracy manifested by the English ordnance surveyors; from
which we may conclude that their published results may be implicitly
relied on.

<span class="small">"A base on Salisbury Plain was measured in 1794 with
steel chains, and was found to be 36574.4 feet long, and the length, *as
obtained by triangulation* from the Hounslow Heath base, being 36574.3,
exhibited therefore a difference of little more than an inch in a length
of nearly seven miles." <span id="fr_106"></span>[1](#fn_106.md)</span>

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

"The measurement of this base (on Belhelvie Sands in 1817) occupied from
May 5 to June 6, and Ramsden's steel chain was again the instrument
used. Its length, when compared with the unit ordnance standard bar O,
is found to be 26.516.66 feet, and the length *as deduced* (in 1827)
from the Lough Foyle base, is 26.518.99 feet."

"Hounslow Heath base, measured with glass rods, when reduced to the
ordnance standard, 1784, was 27.405.06 feet; the same measured with
steel chains, in 1791, gave 27.405.38 feet. Deduced by *computation*
from Lough Foyle base, in 1827, was 27.403.83 feet."

"Salisbury Plain base, measured by steel chains (1794), was 36.575.64
feet. By Colby's compensation bars (1849), it was found to be 36.577.95
feet. *Computed* from Lough Foyle base (1827), 36.577.34 feet." <span

Thus it will be seen that the least error between actual measurement of
base lines, and the results by triangulation and computation from
distant bases was 0.1 foot, a shade more than 1 inch, and the greatest
error 2.33 feet.

<span class="small">"These measurements are the most correct that,
perhaps, have ever been made on the face of the earth. Men of the
greatest skill have been employed; instruments of the most perfect
construction have been used; every precaution has been adopted to avoid
error, and all that science could do has been done." <span

How strange it appears, that one of the most ingenious mathematicians
the world ever produced, assumed for certain purposes that the earth was
a globe, that it revolved, that its revolutions caused the fluid and
plastic matter of

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

its substance to determine towards the equator--causing it to "bulge
out" to a greater extent than the diameter in the direction of the axis,
and therefore the circumference .at the equator must be greater than the
circumference at right angles, or in the direction of latitude; or, in
other words, that the degrees of latitude must diminish towards the
poles, and yet "men of the greatest skill," with "instruments of the
most perfect construction," having availed themselves of "all that
science can do," have succeeded in making measurements the most exact
"ever made on the face of the earth," have found results the very
reverse of all that the Newtonian theory deemed essential to its
consistency and perfection! Instead of the degrees *diminishing* towards
the pole they were found to *increase*; as if the earth were egg-shaped
or prolonged through its axis, and not, like an orange, flattened at the
sides--"as if;" to use more scientific language, "the earth were an
*oblong* instead of an *oblate* spheroid."

Well may such language as the following be used by practical writers!

<span class="small">"The geodetic operations carried out during the last
century and a half for the purpose of determining the figure and the
dimensions of the earth have, up to this time, led to no satisfactory
results. Having been performed by the most eminent astronomers, with the
most perfect instruments, in short with all the resources of modern
science, it would seem that they ought to have led to a final solution
of this most interesting problem; such, however, is by no means the
case. Every new measure of a meridian arc has but added, and adds, to
the existing doubts, and want of concordance, nay to the positive</span>

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

contradictions which the various operations exhibit, as compared with
one another." <span id="fr_109"></span>[1](#fn_109.md)

"The remarkable circumstance to which I would direct attention is, that
in the middle of the nineteenth century, and at a time when astronomy
and analysis celebrate their most brilliant triumphs, the ground itself
on which the truth of all their practical observations and theoretical
deductions mainly rests, continues a subject of doubt and perplexity as
much as ever it was in the almost forgotten days of Sir Isaac Newton.
After 150 years of unceasing efforts astronomy has yet to discover
whether the terrestrial equator forms an ellipse or a circle. After a
century and a half of unsuccessful calculation, analysis is still seen
toiling to invent empirical formulas for the purpose of establishing a
tolerable accordance between the geodetic measurements of to-day and
those of yesterday." <span id="fr_110"></span>[2](#fn_110.md)

Had it been seen in the days of Newton, or even a century ago, that the
surface of standing water was not convex, and therefore that the earth
could not be a globe at all, the great expense and labour, and the
inconceivable anxiety which astronomers have experienced through the
contradictions and inconsistencies developed during their attempts to
reconcile the facts of nature with the fancies of speculative
mathematicians, would have been avoided, and society saved from the
infliction of an education which, in the most confused manner, includes
a system of astronomy at variance with every perception of the senses,
contrary to every day experience, and demonstrably false both in its.
groundwork and in its principal ramifications.
