# ZETETIC ASTRONOMY.

### CHAPTER I.

### ZETETIC AND THEORETIC DEFINED AND COMPARED.

THE term Zetetic is derived from the Greek verb *Zeteo*; which means to
search, or examine; to proceed only by inquiry; to take nothing for
granted, but to trace phenomena to their immediate and demonstrable
causes. It is here used in contradistinction from the word "theoretic,"
the meaning of which is, speculative--imaginary--not
tangible,--scheming, but not proving.

None can doubt that by making special experiments, and collecting
manifest and undeniable facts, arranging them in logical order, and
observing what is naturally and fairly deducible therefrom, the result
must be more consistent and satisfactory than the contrary method of
framing a theory or system--assuming the existence and operation of
causes of which there is no direct and practical evidence, and which is
only claimed to be "admitted for the sake of argument," and for the
purpose of giving an apparent and plausible, but not necessarily
truthful explanation of phenomena. All theories are of this character.
"Supposing, instead of inquiring, imagining systems instead of learning
from observation and experience the true constitution of things.
Speculative men, by the force of genius may

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

invent systems that will perhaps be greatly admired for a time; these,
however, are phantoms which the force of truth will sooner or later
dispel; and while we are pleased with the deceit, true philosophy with
all the arts and improvements that depend upon it, suffers. The real
state of things escapes our observation; or, if it presents itself to
us, we are apt either to reject it wholly as fiction, or, by new efforts
of a vain ingenuity to interweave it with our own conceits, and labour
to make it tally with our favourite schemes. Thus, by blending together
parts so ill-suited, the whole comes forth an absurd composition of
truth and error. \* \* \* These have not done near so much harm as that
pride and ambition which has led philosophers to think it beneath them
to offer anything less to the world than a complete and finished system
of Nature; and, in order to obtain this at once, to take the liberty of
inventing certain principles and hypotheses from which they pretend to
explain all her mysteries."

"Theories are things of uncertain mode. They depend, in a great measure,
upon the humour and caprice of an age, which is sometimes in love with
one, and sometimes with another."

The system of Copernicus was admitted by its author to be merely an
assumption, temporary and incapable of demonstration. The following are
his words:--"It is not necessary that hypotheses should be true, or even
probable; it is sufficient that they lead to results of calculation
which agree with calculation. \* \* \* [Neither](errata.htm#0.md) let
anyone, so far as hypotheses are concerned, expect anything *certain*
from astronomy, since that science can afford nothing of

<span id="page_3">p. 3</span>

the kind, lest, in case he should adopt for truth, things feigned for
another purpose, he should leave this science more foolish than he came.
\* \* \* The hypothesis of the terrestrial motion was *nothing but an
hypothesis*, valuable only so far as it explained phenomena, and not
considered with reference to absolute truth or falsehood."

The Newtonian and all other "views" and "systems" have the same general
character as the "hypothesis of the terrestrial motion," framed by
Copernicus. The foundations or premises are always unproved; no proof is
ever attempted; the necessity for it is denied; it is considered
sufficient that the assumptions *seem* to explain the phenomena
selected. In this way it is that theory supplants theory, and system
gives way to system, often in rapid succession, as one failure after
another compels opinions to change. Until the practice of theorising is
universally relinquished, philosophy will continue to be looked upon by
the bulk of mankind as a vain and mumbling pretension, antagonistic to
the highest aspirations of humanity. Let there be adopted a true and
practical free-thought method, with *sequence* as the only test of truth
and consistency, and the philosopher may become the Priest of Science
and the real benefactor of his species. "Honesty of thought is to look
truth in the face, not in the side face, but in the full front; not
merely to look at truth when found, but to seek it till found. There
must be no tampering with conviction, no hedging or mental
prevarication; no making 'the wish father to the thought;' no fearing to
arrive at a particular result. To think honestly, then, is to think
freely; freedom and honesty of thought

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

are truly but interchangeable terms. For how can he think honestly, who
dreads his being landed in this or that conclusion? Such an one has
already predetermined in his heart how he shall think, and what he shall
believe. Perfect truth, like perfect love, casteth out fear."

Let the method of simple inquiry--the "Zetetic" process be exclusively
adopted--experiments tried and facts collected--not such only as
corroborate an already existing state of mind, but of every kind and
form bearing on the subject, before a conclusion is drawn, or a
conviction affirmed.

"Nature speaks to us in a peculiar language; in the language of
phenomena. She answers at all times the questions which are put to her;
and such questions are experiments."

"Nature lies before us as a panorama; let us explore and find delight,
she puts questions to us, and we may also question her; the answers may
ofttimes be hard to spell, but no dreaded sphinx shall interfere when
human wisdom falters."

We have an excellent example of a "Zetetic" process in an arithmetical
operation, more especially so in what is called the "Golden Rule," or
the "Rule of Three." If a hundredweight of any article costs a given
sum, what will some other weight, less or more, be worth? The separate
figures may be considered as the elements or facts in the inquiry; the
placing and working of them as the logical arrangement of the evidence;
and the quotient, or answer, as the fair and natural deduction,--the
unavoidable or necessitated verdict. Hence, in every arithmetical or

<span id="page_5">p. 5</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Zetetic" process,
the conclusion arrived at is essentially a quotient; which, if the
details are correctly worked, must of necessity be true, and beyond the
reach or power of contradiction.

We have another example of the "Zetetic" process in our Courts of
Justice. A prisoner is placed at the bar; evidence for and against him
is demanded: when advanced it is carefully arranged and patiently
considered. It is then presented to the Jury for solemn reconsideration,
and whatever verdict is given, it is advanced as the unavoidable
conclusion necessitated by the whole of the evidence. In trials, for
justice, society would not tolerate any other procedure. Assumption of
guilt, and prohibition of all evidence to the contrary, is a practice
not to be found among any of the civilised nations of the
earth--scarcely indeed, among savages and barbarians; and yet assumption
of premises, and selection of evidence to corroborate assumptions, is
everywhere and upon all subjects the practice of theoretical
philosophers!

The "Zetetic" process is also the most natural method of investigation.
Nature herself always teaches it; it is her own continual suggestion;
children invariably seek information by asking questions, by earnestly
inquiring from those around them. Fearlessly, anxiously, and without the
slightest regard to consequences, question after question, in rapid and
exciting succession, will often proceed from a child, until the most
profound in learning and philosophy, will feel puzzled to reply; and
often the searching cross-examinations of a mere natural tyro, can only
be brought to an end by an order to retire--to bed

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> --to school--to
play--to anywhere--rather than that the fiery "Zetetic" ordeal shall be
continued.

If then both Nature and justice, as well as the common sense and
practical experience of mankind demand, and will not be content with
less or other than the "Zetetic" process, why is it ignored and
constantly violated by the learned in philosophy? What right have they
to begin their disquisitions with fanciful data, and then to demand
that, to these all surrounding phenomena be moulded. As private
individuals they have, of course, a right to "do as they like with their
own;" but as authors and public teachers their unnatural efforts are
immeasurably pernicious. Like a poor animal tied to a stake in the
centre of a meadow, where it can only feed in a limited circle, the
theoretical philosopher is tethered to his premises, enslaved by his own
assumptions, and however great his talent, his influence, his
opportunities, he can only rob his fellow men of their intellectual
freedom and independence, and convert them into slaves like him-self. In
this respect astronomical science is especially faulty. It assumes the
existence of certain data; it then applies these data to the explanation
of certain phenomena. If the solution seems plausible it is considered
that the data may be looked upon as proved--demonstrated by the
apparently satisfactory explanation they have afforded. Facts, and
explanations of a different character, are put aside as unworthy of
regard; since that which is already assumed seems to explain matters,
there need be no further concern. Guided by this principle, the
secretary of the Royal Astronomical Society (Professor De Morgan, of

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Trinity College,
Cambridge), reviewing a paper by the author, in the *Athenæum*, for
March 25th, 1865, says: "The evidence that the earth is round is but
cumulative and circumstantial; scores of phenomena ask, separately and
independently, what *other* explanation can be *imagined* except the
sphericity of the earth?" It is thus candidly admitted that there is no
direct and positive evidence that the earth is round, that it is only
"imagined" or assumed to be so in order to afford an explanation of
"scores of phenomena." This is precisely the language of Copernicus, of
Newton, and of all astronomers who have laboured to prove the rotundity
of the earth. It is pitiful in the extreme that after so many ages of
almost unopposed indulgence, philosophers instead of beginning to seek,
before everything else, the true constitution of the physical world, are
still to be seen labouring only to frame hypotheses, and to reconcile
phenomena with imaginary and ever-shifting foundations. Their labour is
simply to repeat and perpetuate the self-deception of their
predecessors. Surely the day is not far distant when the very
complications which their numerous theories have created, will startle
them into wakefulness, and convince them that for long ages past they
have but been idly dreaming! Time wasted, energies thrown away, truth
obscured, and falsehood rampant, constitute a charge so grave that
coming generations will look upon them as the bitterest enemies of
civilisation, the heaviest drags on the wheels of progress, and the most
offensive embodiment of frivolity, pride of learning, and canting
formality; worse than this--by their position, their standing in the
front ranks of

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

learning, they deceive the public. They appear to represent a solid
phalanx of truth and wisdom, when in reality they are but as the flimsy
ice of an hour's induration--all surface, without substance, or depth,
or reliability, or power to save from danger and ultimate destruction.

Let the practice of theorising be abandoned as one oppressive to the
reasoning powers, fatal to the full development of truth, and, in every
sense, inimical to the solid progress of sound philosophy.

If, to ascertain the true figure and condition of the earth, we adopt
the "Zetetic" process, which truly is the only one sufficiently
reliable, we shall find that instead of its being a globe--one of an
infinite number of worlds moving on axes and in an orbit round the sun,
it is the directly contrary--a Plane, without diurnal or progressive
motion, and unaccompanied by anything in the firmament analogous to
itself; or, in other words, that it is the *only known material world*.
