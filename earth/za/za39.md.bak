### VARIABILITY OF PENDULUM VIBRATIONS.

Many contend that because a pendulum vibrates more rapidly in the
northern region than "at the equator, the earth is thereby proved not
only to be a globe, but to have axial motion, and because the variation
in the velocity is that of gradual increase as the north pole is
approached, it is concluded that the earth's true shape is that of an
oblate spheroid--the diameter through the poles being less than that
through the equator. The difference was calculated by Newton to be the
235th part of the whole diameter; or that the polar was to the
equatorial diameter as 680 to 692. Huygens gave the proportion as 577 to
875, or a difference of about one-third of the whole diameter. Others
have given still different proportions; but recently the difference of
opinion, each the result of calculation, has become so great that many
have concluded that the earth is really instead of oblate, an *oblong*
spheroid.

It is argued that as the length of a pendulum vibrating

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

seconds at the equator is 39,027 inches, and at the north pole 39,197
inches, that the earth, like an orange, has a globular form, but
somewhat flattened at the "poles." But this so-called argument proceeds
and depends upon the *assumption* that the earth is a globe having a
"centre of attraction of gravitation," towards which all bodies
gravitate or fall, and as a pendulum is essentially a falling body under
certain restraint, the fact that when of the same length it oscillates
or *falls* more rapidly at the north than at the equator is a proof that
the northern surface is nearer to the "centre of attraction," or centre
of the earth, than the equatorial surface: and of course if nearer the
radius must be shorter, and therefore the "earth is a spheroid flattened
at the poles."

The above is very ingenious and very plausible, but unfortunately for
its character as an argument, the evidence is wanting that the earth is
a globe at all; and until proof of convexity is given, all questions as
to its being oblate, oblong, or entirely spherical, are logically out of
place.

It is the duty of those who, from the behaviour of a pendulum at
different latitudes, contend that the earth is spherical, to first prove
that *no other* cause could operate besides greater proximity to a
centre of gravity in producing the known differences in its
oscillations. This not being done, nor attempted, the whole matter must
be condemned as logically insufficient, irregular, and worthless for its
intended purpose.

M. M. Picart and De la Hire, two celebrated French *savans*, as well as
many other scientific men, have attributed

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

the variations of the pendulum to differences of temperature at
different latitudes. It is certain that the average changes of
temperature are more than sufficient to bring about the variations which
have been observed. The following quotation will show the practical
results of these changes:--

<span class="small">"All the solid bodies with which we are surrounded
are constantly undergoing changes of bulk, corresponding to the
variations of temperature. . . . The expansion and con-traction of
metals by heat and cold form subjects of serious and careful attention
to chronometer makers, as will appear by the following statements:--The
length of the pendulum vibrating seconds, *in vacuo*, in the latitude of
London (51° 31' 8" north) at the level of the sea, and at the
temperature of 62° Fahrenheit, has been ascertained with the greatest
precision to be 39.13929 inches; now, as the metal of which it is
composed is constantly subject to variation of temperature, it cannot
but happen that its *length* is constantly varying, and when it is
further stated that if the 'bob' be let down 1-100th of an inch, the
clock will lose ten seconds in twenty-four hours; that the elongation of
1-1000th of an inch will cause it to lose one second per day; and that a
change of temperature equal to 30° Fahrenheit will alter its length
1-5000th part, and occasion an error in the rate of going of eight
seconds per day, it will appear evident that some plan must be devised
for obviating so serious an inconvenience." <span

"The mean annual temperature of the whole earth at the level of the sea
is 50° Fahrenheit. For different latitudes it is as under:--

From the above table it is seen that the temperature gradually decreases
from the equator towards the pole, which would of necessity *contract*
the substance of the pendulum, or starting it and cause it to
[vibrate](errata.htm#7.md) more rapidly.

Besides the temperature of a given latitude the pressure and density of
the air must be taken into account. In numbers 294 and 480 of the
"Philosophical Transactions," Dr. Derham records a number of experiments
with pendulums in the open air, and in the receiver of an air-pump,
which he summarises as follows:--

<span class="small">"The arches of vibration *in vacuo* were larger than
in the open air, or in the receiver before it was exhausted; the
enlargement or diminution of the arches of vibration were *constantly
proportional* to the *quantity* of *air*, or rarity, or density of it,
which was left in the receiver of the air-pump. And as the vibrations
were longer or shorter, so the time were accordingly; viz., two seconds
in an hour when the vibrations were longest, and less and less as the
air was re-admitted, and the vibrations shortened."</span>

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

Thus it is evident that two distinct and tangible causes necessarily
operate to produce variability in the oscillations of a pendulum at
different latitudes, without having recourse to a flattening at the
poles of an imaginary globe. First the gradual diminution of temperature
as the pendulum is carried from the equator to the polar region, tends
to shorten its length, and thus to increase its number of vibrations per
hour or day; and secondly, as the polar centre is approached the air is
colder, therefore denser, and therefore the "arches of vibration"
shorter, and the times of oscillation less, or in other words the number
of vibrations greater in a given period. It has also been ascertained
that the pendulum is influenced--other conditions being the same, by
electric and magnetic states of the atmosphere. When intense electric
conditions exist the arches and times of vibration are less than during
the existence of opposite conditions. Hence if in different latitudes
pendulum experiments are made *in vacuo*, at the same temperature, and
always at the level of the sea, different electric and magnetic
conditions prevailing, will induce variable results. The attention of
some of the most accurate and patient observers has been directed to
this mode of proving the oblate spheroidal form of the earth, but the
results have never been satisfactory, nor such as were expected, or that
the theory of rotundity should produce. The following remarks upon this
subject are interesting:

<span class="small">"Newton was the first person who made a calculation
of the figure of the earth on the theory of gravitation. He took the
following *supposition* as the only one to which his theory could be
applied. He *assumed* the earth to be fluid. This fluid</span>

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

matter he *assumed* to be equally dense in every part. . . . For trial
of his theory he *supposed* the fluid earth to be a spheroid. In this
manner he *inferred* that the form of the earth would be a spheroid in
which the length of the shorter is to the length of the longer or
equatorial diameter, in the proportion of 229 to 230." <span
id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md)

"The following table comprises the results of the most reliable pendulum
experiments which have thus far been made, and. among which the
extensive series of observations by General Sabine holds the first
place."

(Particulars are here given of sixty-seven experiments made in every
latitude north of the equator, from 0° 1´ 49″ north to 79° 49´ 58″
north; and of twenty-nine experiments in the south from latitude 0° 1'
34″ south, to Cape Horn, 55° 51´ 20″ south, and South Shetland. 62° 56´
11″ south.) We have here before us the results of fifty-five
observations of the seconds pendulum, and of seventy-six observations of
the invariable pendulum; in all 131 experiments; which number, however,
includes eight of the former and fifteen of the latter kind, *differing
to a remarkable extent*, as compared with the results generally from the
computed values. General Sabine observes of these discrepancies that
'they are due in a far greater degree to local peculiarities than to
what may be more strictly called errors of observation.' And already Mr.
Bailey (in Memoirs of the Royal Astronomical Society, vol. 7), had
expressed the opinion 'that the vibrations of a pendulum are powerfully
affected, in many places, by the local attraction of the substratum on
which it is swung, or by *some other direct influence* at present
*unknown to us*, and the effect of which far exceeds the errors of
observation."

"General Sabine himself relates:--'Captain Foster was furnished

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

<span class="small">with two invariable pendulums of precisely the same
form and construction as those which had been employed by Captain Kayter
and myself. Both pendulums were vibrated at all the stations, but *from
some cause*, which Mr. Bailey was unable to explain, the observations
with one of them were *so discordant* at South Shetland as to *require
their rejection*'" <span id="fr_101"></span>[1](za40.htm#fn_101.md)</span>

From the foregoing remarks and quotations it is obvious that the
assumption of Sir Isaac Newton that the earth is an oblate spheroid, is
not confirmed by experiments made with the pendulum.
