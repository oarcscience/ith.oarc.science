### EXPERIMENT 6.

The following important experiment has recently been tried at Brighton,
in Sussex. On the new or Western Pier a good theodolite was fixed, at an
elevation of 30 feet above the water, and directed to a given point on
the pier at Worthing, a distance of at least ten statute miles. Several
small yachts and other vessels were sailing about between the two piers,
one of which was brought to within a few yards of the Brighton Pier, and
directed to sail as nearly as possible in a straight line towards the
pier at Worthing; when the top of the mast, which scarcely reached the
theodolite, was observed to continue below the line of sight throughout
the whole distance, as shown in fig. 14--A,

representing the theodolite, and B, the pier at Worthing. From which it
is concluded that the surface of the water is horizontal throughout the
whole length of ten miles. Whereas, if the earth is a globe, the water
between the two piers would be an arc of a circle (as shown in fig. 15),
the centre of which would

be 16 feet 8 inches higher than the two extremities, and the vessel
starting. from A, would ascend an inclined plane, rising

over 16 feet, to the summit of the arc at C, where the mast-head would
stand considerably *above* the line of sight. From this point the vessel
would gradually descend to the point B, at Worthing. As no such
behaviour of the vessel was observed, the ten miles of water between the
two piers must be horizontal.
