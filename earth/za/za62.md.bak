### MOON'S APPEARANCE.

ASTRONOMERS have indulged in imagination to such a degree that the moon
is now considered to be a solid, opaque spherical world, having
mountains, valleys, lakes, or seas, volcanic craters, and other
conditions analogous to the surface of the earth. So far has this fancy
been carried that the whole visible disc has been mapped out, and
special names given to its various peculiarities, as though they had
been carefully observed, and actually measured by a party of terrestrial
ordnance surveyors. All this has been done in direct opposition to the
fact that whoever, for the first time, and without previous bias of
mind, looks at the moon's surface through a powerful telescope, is
puzzled to say what it is really like, or how to compare it with
anything known to him. The comparison which may be made will depend upon
the state of mind of the observer. It is well known that persons looking
at the rough bark of a tree, or at the irregular lines or veins in
certain kinds of marble and stone, or gazing at the red embers in a dull
fire will, according to the degree of activity of the imagination, be
able to see many different forms, even the outlines of animals and of
human faces. It is in this way that persons may fancy that the moon's
surface is broken up into hills and valleys, and other conditions such
as are found on earth. But that anything really similar to the

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

surface of our own world is anywhere visible upon the moon is altogether
fallacious. This is admitted by some of those who have written on the
subject, as the following quotations will show:--

"Some persons when they look into a telescope for the first time having
heard that mountains are to be seen, and discovering nothing but these
(previously described) unmeaning figures, break off in disappointment,
and have their faith in these things rather diminished than increased. I
would advise, therefore, before the student takes even *his first* view
of the moon through a telescope, to form as clear an idea as he can how
mountains, and valleys, and caverns, situated at such a distance *ought
to look*, and by what marks they may be recognised. Let him seize, if
possible, the most favourable periods (about the time of the first
quarter), and *previously learn from drawings and explanations* how to
interpret everything he sees." <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md)

"Whenever we exhibit celestial objects to inexperienced observers, it is
usual to *precede the view with good drawings* of the objects,
accompanied by an *explanation* of what each appearance exhibited in the
telescope *indicates*. The novice is told that mountains and valleys can
be seen in the moon by the aid of the telescope; but on looking he sees
a confused mass of light and shade, and *nothing* which *looks* to him
*like either mountains or valleys*. Had his attention been previously
directed to a plain *drawing* of the moon, and each particular
appearance *interpreted* to him, he would then have looked through the
telescope with intelligence and satisfaction." <span
id="fr_147"></span>[2](#fn_147.md)

"It is fresh in our remembrance that when showing a friend the moon at
an advanced phase, 'Is this the moon?' he said,

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> <span
class="small">'why I see nothing but clouds and bubbles!'--a very
graphic description of a first view by an uneducated eye. None of the
wonderful beauties of the landscape scenery that are so striking to the
beholder, can either be recognised or appreciated under such
circumstances. It is *only after a careful training of the eye*, that
the peculiarities of the full moon can be truly apprehended." <span
id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md)</span>

Thus it is admitted by those who teach, that the moon is a spherical
world, having hills and dales like the earth, that such things can only
be seen in imagination.

"Nothing but unmeaning figures" are really visible, and "the students
break off in disappointment, and have their faith in such things rather
diminished than increased, until they previously learn from drawings and
explanations how to interpret everything seen."

But who first made the drawings? Who first interpreted the "unmeaning
figures" and the "confused mass of light and shade?" Who first declared
them to indicate mountains and valleys, and ventured to make drawings,
and give explanations and interpretations for the purpose of biassing
the minds, and fixing or guiding the imaginations of subsequent
observers? Whoever they were, they, at least, had "given the reins to
fancy," and afterwards took upon themselves to dogmatise and teach their
bold, crude, and unwarranted imaginings to succeeding investigators. And
this is the kind of "evidence and reasoning" which is obtruded in our
seats of learning, and spread out in the numerous works which are
published for the "edification" of society.
