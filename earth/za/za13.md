### EXPERIMENT 8.

A very striking illustration of the true form of the sea horizon may be
observed from the high land in the neighbourhood of the head of
Portsmouth Harbour. Looking across Spithead to the Isle of Wight, the
base or margin of the island, where water and land come together,
appears to be a straight line from east to west, a length of twenty-two
statute miles. If a good

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

theodolite is directed upon it, the cross-hair will show that the. land
and water line is perfectly horizontal, as shown in fig. 19.

If the earth is globular, the two ends east and west of the Isle of
Wight would be 80 feet below the centre, and would appear in the field
of view of the theodolite as represented in fig. 20. As a proof that
such would be the appearance, the same instrument directed upon any
object having an upper outline curved in the smallest degree, will
detect and plainly show the curvature in relation to the cross-hair *a*
*b*; or the levelled board employed in experiment 7, fig. 18, will prove
the same condition to exist; viz., that the margin of the Isle of Wight
is, for twenty-two miles, a perfectly straight line; and instead of
curvating downwards 80 feet each way from the centre, as it certainly
would if convexity existed, it is absolutely horizontal.

From the lighthouse on Bidstone Hill, near Liverpool, the. whole length
of the Isle of Man, on a clear day and with a good telescope, is
distinctly visible, and presents the same horizontal base line as that
observed in the Isle of Wight.

From the high land near Douglas harbour, Isle of Man, the whole length
of the coast of North Wales is often plainly visible to the naked eye--a
distance extending from the point of Ayr, at the mouth of the River Dee,
towards Holyhead, not

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

less than fifty miles. Whatever test has been employed, the line, where
the sea and the land appear to join, is always found to be perfectly
horizontal, as shown in the following diagram; fig. 21.

<span id="img_fig21"></span> ![FIG. 21.](img/fig21.jpg.md)  
FIG. 21.

whereas, if the earth is spherical, and therefore the surface of all
water convex, such an appearance could not exist. It would of necessity
appear as shown in fig. 22.

FIG. 22.

A line stretched horizontally before the observer would not only show
the various elevations of the land, but would also show the declination
of the horizon H, H, below the cross-line S, S. The fifty miles length
of the Welsh coast seen along the horizon in Liverpool Bay, would have a
declination from the centre of at least 416 feet (25<sup>2</sup> x .8
inches = 416 feet 8 inches). But as such declination, or downward
curvation, cannot be detected, the conclusion is logically inevitable
that *it has no existence*. Let the reader seriously ask whether any and
what reason exists in Nature to prevent the fall of more than 400 feet
being visible to the eye, or incapable of detection by any optical or
mathematical means whatever. This question is especially important when
it is considered that at the same distance, and on the upper outline of
the same land, changes of level of only a few yards extent are quickly
and unmistakably perceptible.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If he is guided by
evidence and reason, and influenced by a love of truth and consistency,
he cannot longer maintain that the earth is a globe. He must feel that
to do so is to war with the evidence of his senses, to deny that any
importance attaches to fact and experiment, to ignore entirely the value
of logical process, and to cease to rely upon practical induction.
