### ANALOGY IN FAVOUR OF ROTUNDITY.

To those who are not strictly logical, a favourite "argument," in
support of the earth's globular form, is "that as all the heavenly
bodies are worlds, and visibly round, may, not the earth be so
necessarily, seeing that it is one of the same category?"

This is only seemingly plausible. In reality it is a piece of
self-deception. It must be proved that the stars are worlds; and to do
this, or to make it even possible that they are so, it must be proved
that they are millions of miles distant from the earth, and from each
other, and are hundreds or thousands of miles in diameter. By plane
trigonometry, in special connection with carefully *measured* base
lines, it has been *demonstrated*--placed beyond all power of
doubt--that the sun, moon, stars, comets, and meteors of every kind, are
all within a distance of a few thousand miles from the sea-level of the
earth; that therefore they are very small objects, therefore not worlds,
and therefore, from analogy, offer no logical reason or pretext for
concluding that this world is globular.
