### "SPHERICAL EXCESS."

As a proof of the earth's rotundity, many place great reliance upon what
is called the "spherical excess," which has been observed on making
trigonometrical observations on a large scale.

<span class="small">"The angles taken between any three points on the
surface of the earth by the theodolite are, strictly speaking, spherical
angles, and their sum must exceed 180 degrees; and the lines bounding
them are not the chords as they should be, but the tangents to the
earth. This excess is inappreciable in common cases, but in the larger
triangles it becomes necessary to allow for it, and to diminish each of
the angles of the observed triangle by one-third of the spherical
excess. To calculate this excess, divide the area of the triangle in
feet by</span>

<span id="page_262">p. 262</span>

the radius of the earth in seconds, and the quotient is the
excess:" <span id="fr_120"></span>[1](#fn_120.md)

"The theodolite used to measure the angles (in the English survey)
surpassed in its dimensions and elaborate workmanship, every instrument
of the kind that had been seen in Europe; it measured angles with such
precision, that it became necessary, in the calculation of the
triangles, to take into consideration the excess of three spherical
angles above two right angles, a quantity that had hitherto been too
minute to be ascertained by any instrument, and was only known by theory
to have any existence. The amount of the total error in the sum of the
three angles never exceeded three seconds, so that the angles. generally
must have been measured to the nearest second." <span
id="fr_121"></span>[2](#fn_121.md)

In this so-called argument for rotundity we have another instance of the
manner in which the most practical men of science are led astray. Just
as the differences observed in the reading of chronometers as compared
with those of the logs and dead reckonings when sailing in the southern
regions, navigators, having had an education which involved the doctrine
of rotundity, could not possibly see the real explanation which
demonstrable truth afforded, but were forced to adopt the idea that
ocean counter currents existed, overlooking altogether, and not daring
to face the obvious fact that the differences were observed whether
sailing east or west, and therefore that they were parties to the
contradictory notion that the currents of the sea were moving in
contrary directions carrying ships right and left, or backward and
forward, at the same time; so the most skilful observers connected

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

with the ordnance survey of Great Britain and Ireland, could not see
that the angles which were too large for agreement with their general
operations were the result of slight divergence in the rays of light
passing through the lenses of their telescope; but, contrary to every
principle of reasoning, assumed that the tops of the high places on and
to which observations were made, were divergent from the common centre
of a globular earth, and hence the so-called "spherical excess," for
which they made such allowances as were necessary to make their
observations agree with the theory of rotundity. Had they known that
such a theory was contrary to fact, and that the earth was a plane, they
would have sought an explanation of discrepancies in the proper quarter.
They would have recognised the influence of refraction or "collimation"
in their instruments; for they could not be ignorant of the optical
peculiarities which necessitate so many observations upon the same point
before they could decide upon the "average of errors" as their proper
reading. The rule that the greater the number of observations made
"averaging the errors," the more correct the deductions, ought to have
led them to seek the "spherical excess" only in the optical character of
the telescopes employed. In the operations connected with the Mont Cenis
Tunnel the leading observations were many times repeated before the
proper angles were ascertained. Mr. Francis Kossuth, one of the Royal
Commissioners of Italian Railways, in his report on the tunnel, after
describing the processes adopted in surveying over the mountain, says:--

<span class="small">"The whole system consisted of 28 triangles; and 86
was</span>

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

<span class="small">the number of measured angles. All of these were
repeated never less than 10 times, the greater part 20, and the most
important as many as 60 times." <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](za44.htm#fn_122.md)</span>

In many of the triangulations connected with the British ordnance
survey, the observations were repeated upwards of a hundred times, in
order to diminish the personal and instrumental errors to which all such
operations are liable. In page 41 of this work it is shown that a
levelled theodolite pointed towards the sea represents the horizon as
below the horizontal cross-hair, on account of what is technically
called "collimation," or "a slight divergence of the rays of light from
the axis of the eye on passing through the several glasses of the
theodolite." The same "collimation" exists in connection with the
vertical cross-hair; and hence the slight excess of the three angles
over 180 degrees so often observed when taking very long sights--such,
for instance, as those between Kippure and Donard, in Ireland, and
Precelly, in Wales.
