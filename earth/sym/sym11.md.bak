### CHAPTER VIII.

<span class="small">The Author leaves the ship to visit the seat of
government.—Description of the country.—Account of the polity of the
Symzonians, as stated by his conductor.—Comparison of the industry, its
objects and ends in the two worlds, and of the necessities and habits of
the internals and externals.—Expulsion of the unworthy from Symzonia, to
a place of exile near the north pole.—External world supposed to have
been peopled by the outcasts.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> was the 2d of January, 1818, that I
set out on this delightful visit. A native boat came alongside to convey
me, into which I stepped with no more sense of fear than might be
excited on going among the spirits of the blessed; so perfectly did the
appearance, manners, conduct, and expression of countenance of this
people accord with my ideas of purity and goodness.

On the way to the place of assembly, which was about one hundred miles
by water from the harbour where the ship lay, much occurred to gratify
my senses, instruct my mind, and delight my heart. We ascended the
river, the banks of which, and all the country near them, appeared like

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

one beautiful and highly cultivated garden, with neat low buildings
scattered throughout the scene. No crowded cities, the haunts of vice
and misery, hung like wens upon the lovely face of nature. An appearance
of equality in the condition and enjoyments of the people pervaded the
country. The buildings were all of them large enough for comfort and
convenience, but none of them so large, or so charged with ornament, as
to appear to have been erected as monuments of the pride and folly of
the proprietor.

Great numbers of small cattle and other domestic animals enriched the
view, and a profusion of flowers, tastefully arranged in the vicinity of
every house, filled the air with perfume, and charmed the eye with their
variegated beauties. No fogs or vapours obscured the charming prospect,
nor formed in wainrows <span id="fr_2"></span>[\*](#fn_2.md) to ornament
the scene, the mild influence of the sun not being sufficient to produce
rapid exhalations, nor the nights cold enough to condense them into

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

vapour. Nature's fairest landscape requires no mantle to obscure its
beauties, or to heighten their effect.

The active inhabitants all seemed engaged in something useful. Some were
tending their cattle; some cultivating vegetables, fruits, and flowers,
while others practised the mechanic arts.

As we passed on through this enchanting country, Surui, the eldest of my
conductors, instructed me in the civil polity, customs, mariners, and
habits of this people. From him I learned. that in Symzonia all power
emanated from the people; that the affairs of the nation were directed
by

1\. A chief, who was honoured with the title of *Best Man*, and who held
his situation for life, unless impeached of crime; but whose issue was
considered ineligible to the same office for one generation after his
decease.

2\. An ordinary council of one hundred worthies, who assembled twice in
each year, and oftener when circumstances made it necessary, to give
advice to the Best Man.

3\. A grand council of worthies, who assembled once in tour years, to
admit members

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

to their body, collect the sense of the nation on all public affairs,
and aid the Best Man with their judgment in the appointment of
Efficients to discharge the executive duties of the state.

The Best Man could only be elected by an unanimous vote of the grand
council.

The Worthies are of three orders—the <span
class="smallcaps">Good</span>, the <span class="smallcaps">Wise</span>,
and the <span class="smallcaps">Useful</span>.

The first, who have the title of *Good*, are such as have, by active
benevolence, exemplary conduct, and constant efforts to promote the
happiness of their fellow beings, obtained an expression of the public
voice, that they are superior to the generality of men. W hen any such
spontaneous testimony is given in favour of a man, it becomes the duty
of the worthies of the district to which he belongs, to make the fact
known to the grand council. The council examine minutely into the
grounds of the popular opinion, and if they find it well founded, and
that the man is truly good, benevolent, and virtuous, they admit him a
member by the title of Good.

The second class of worthies, are such as have in like manner been
ascertained to have promoted the interests of society by

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

improvements in science, and the advancement of useful knowledge. Such
men, if free from vice, although not distinguished by benevolence, or
the highest class of virtues, are admitted to the order of worthies by
the title of *Wise*. This class corresponds to that of the philosophers
of the external world.

The third, are all such as have manifested superior skill and diligence
in their respective callings, with evident and constant good will
towards their fellow men; such as have introduced useful inventions and
improvements in the arts, set good examples to their neighbours, and are
free from vicious propensities: these, on being found. justly entitled
to such characters, are admitted to the order of worthies by the title
of *Useful*.

The executive department is managed by <span
class="smallcaps">Efficients</span>, who are appointed by the Best Man,
assisted by the Grand Council; and, in the interval of their session, if
vacancies occur, by the ordinary council of One Hundred.

It is the duty of the worthies to notice the conduct of the people in
their respective districts, to aid the feeble and distressed,

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

if any such be found, to encourage the wavering, and reward the
meritorious. Whenever any one of them discovers a man of retired but
useful life, active but unobtrusive benevolence, extensive usefulness,
with that modest shunning of the public exhibition of his doings which
is necessary to possess the public in his favour, it becomes the duty of
the Worthy to name him to the Grand Council, as a man of modest and
exemplary merit; and if his character is, on investigation, found to be
agreeable to the representation, he is admitted accordingly.

Amongst the standing rules of this body, Surui mentioned the following:

1st. Any man setting forth pretensions to superior merit, with a view to
obtain a place among the worthies, is to be recorded as a *vain* man,
and to be for ever debarred the privilege of membership.

2d. Any man convicted of taking measures to gain a false reputation for
merit, or of secretly influencing any person or persons to exert
themselves to forward his nomination to the Grand Council, is to be
recorded as a *deceitful* man, and to be thereby for ever disqualified.

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

3d. Any man known to have been guilty of unjust or oppressive conduct
towards any of those within his sphere of influence, or to have
persecuted any who have been placed within the control of his power, to
be recorded as a *tyrannical* man, and considered as wholly unfit to
have any agency in the government of his fellow beings.

4th. Any man known to have affected a servile devotion to men of
influence and power, or to have courted popularity by flattering the
prejudices or passions of the people, to be recorded as a *hypocritical*
man, and to be considered for ever unworthy of admission to the
distinguished orders.

5th. All persons guilty of crimes, all who infringe the rules of virtue
and morality, all who lead irregular lives, or who set a bad example in
society, are for ever excluded from a place among the worthies. The last
clause of this rule is understood to include old batchelors.

All the Efficients are appointed from the order of Worthies; no man
being considered eligible to a place of trust who has not by his
exemplary conduct, usefulness, and undeviating rectitude, acquired the
notice and confidence of the public.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

The Grand Council being very numerous, transacts business by a committee
of three members from each district, to whom the other members
communicate such information and advice as they may deem necessary. The
recommendations to office are made by this body, to whom the cause of
each nomination, and the qualifications of the persons nominated, are
set forth in writing. The names of three individuals are always sent up
to the Best Man, with a description of their qualifications and merits,
for each office, of whom he selects and appoints the one who is, in his
opinion, most deserving of it.

The exercise of intrigue and backstair influence being a bar to office,
the offices of government are filled with the most intelligent, upright,
and valuable men in the country, selected with the sole view of
promoting the best interests of the nation.

I could not refrain from expressing my admiration of a system so wisely
calculated to give the state the benefit of all the talents,
information, and tried integrity of the nation. Surui asked with
apparent surprise, if we the Externals did not select men to fill the
places of honour, power,

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

and trust, with the same scrupulous attention to their character, purity
of life, usefulness in society, and goodness of heart. I was ashamed to
acknowledge the truth, and gave him a specimen of the veracity of an
External by replying, "yes, much the same, at least in the State of
New-York, where I am best acquainted."

I inquired whether the order of Worthies was a numerous body, and was
informed that it embraced a majority of the men of mature age; all of
whom were called in turn according to the order of their admission, to
fill a place in the ordinary council of the Best Man. This council
consists of one hundred; fifty-five of whom must be of the Good, forty
of the Useful, and five of the Wise. Such persons, however, as had
failed to maintain the character which obtained their admission to the
order, might be excluded from a participation in the government; and the
Best Man had the power to pass their names when summoning his ordinary
council, provided he did not at any time pass more than one-tenth of the
names on the list: for that proportion was deemed the

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

utmost that could possibly deviate from the paths of rectitude.

It appeared to me to be a very troublesome form of government, which
required the assemblage once in four years of more than half the men of
the nation. But l found this to be a great mistake. Surui assured me,
that the labour necessary to procure all the essential comforts and
rational embellishments of life, in this fruitful country, and with the
temperate habits of the people, required but a small proportion of the
labour which could be performed; that there was abundant leisure for an
annual assemblage of all the people, without any detriment to the
business of society; and that every member of it enjoyed an abundance of
the comforts of life, without excessive or constant labour. So far was
the quadrennial assembly of the worthies from being regarded as an evil,
that the arrival of the time of its occurrence was hailed as a season of
great enjoyment, instruction, and usefulness.

The numerous inlets of the sea, which intersected this beautiful country
in every direction, rendered travelling very easy and expeditions; so
that not only the Worthies,

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

but also such of their families as were of sufficient age to mingle with
society, repaired to the district of the assembly, in which none but the
Good, the Wise, and the Useful, were permitted to reside.—In the vessels
in which they are conveyed, they take a sufficient quantity of
substantial provisions for their own consumption, or to exchange for
such as they may prefer during their visit. They also carry tents, in
which such as cannot be accommodated in the houses of their friends
reside, during their stay.

None but Worthies are permitted to enter the district of the assembly
during the sitting. The first month of the assembly is passed in
devotional exercises, and the interchange of visits and civilities, all
vieing with one another in endeavours to advance the happiness of those
about them, and in conversing on matters important or useful to the
commonweal. After comparing ideas with one another for a month, they
appoint a committee from their number to sit in grand council one month,
and no longer. All but the committee then return home, unless business,
or a desire to offer their advice on some subject to the particular

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

notice of the committee, induces them to remain.

Surui described the enjoyments of the season of the grand assemblage
with the most enthusiastic expressions of delight.—None but the Good,
the Wise, the Useful, none but the virtuous and benevolent, are then
within the circuit of the district. The rarest gratifications of which
the human mind is susceptible in intellectual intercourse, were then
enjoyed without a sense of evil.

To me, who had been accustomed to see a great proportion of mankind
constantly devoted to hard labour, or incessantly applying to business,
to obtain a precarious subsistence; to see them, not content with the
efforts which might be made by day, wearing out their health and lives
in toil by the midnight lamp, and scarcely obtaining what are considered
the necessaries of life,—it was difficult to comprehend how a great
proportion of this people could leave their business and their homes, to
pass months in a non-productive state, without oppressing the remainder
of the people with intolerable burdens. But I was told that the Worthies
received nothing for their

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

services, and were able to provide without difficulty for themselves:
all the revenue of the country was devoted to the maintenance of the
Efficients, (who were paid for the time actually devoted to public
affairs,) and to works of public utility.

This state of things appeared to me at first to be beyond the limits of
possibility in the external world. My mind was for some time occupied by
reflecting upon the extraordinary difference in the *natural* condition
of the internals aid externals; and I commenced a comparison of the
varieties and objects of industry in the two worlds, and of those
necessities and habits which demanded the products of labour. This
brought me to a clear view of the matter. I perceived that the greater
part of the labour of the externals was devoted to the production of
things useless or pernicious; and that of the things produced or
acquired, the distribution, through defects in our social organization,
was so unequal, that some few destroyed, without any increase of
happiness to themselves, the products of the toil of multitudes. Instead
of devoting our time to useful purposes, and living temperately on the
wholesome gifts of Providence,

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

like the blest internals, so as to preserve our health and strengthen
our minds, thousands of us are employed in producing inebriating
liquors, by the destruction of wholesome articles of food, to poison the
bodies, enervate the minds, and corrupt the hearts, of our fellow
beings. Other thousands waste their strength to procure stimulating
weeds and narcotic substances from the extreme parts of the earth, for
the purpose of exciting diseased appetites, whereby, in the case of
those who possess good things, the ability to enjoy them is destroyed.
Still greater numbers give their industry and their lives to the
acquisition of mere matters of ornament, for the gratification of pride,
an insatiable passion, which is only stimulated to increase its demands
by every new indulgence. I saw that the internals owed their happiness
to their rationality, to a conformity with the laws of nature and
religion; and that the externals were miserable, from the indulgence of
inordinate passions, and subjection to vicious propensities.

I inquired of Surui how I should know the distinguished orders? what
badge or outward sign was worn by them? To

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

which he replied, "They are known by their undeviating rectitude of
conduct the good by their benevolence, the wise by their knowledge, the
useful by their works." In answer to my inquiries as to the condition of
those who were not of the order of Worthies, I was informed that it was
very various, according to their conduct. Most of the people, seeing the
happy condition of the Worthies, and being extremely desirous to partake
of the refined enjoyments of the grand assemblage, strove earnestly to
become deserving of a place among them; but some, giving way to their
carnal appetites and passions, fell into intemperate indulgences,
whereby they produced disease to their bodies, and a necessity for much
labour to supply their unreasonable consumption, and at the same time an
aversion to the performance of the labour which is necessary to the
preservation of health; that the constant exhortations and efforts of
the Worthy were found insufficient to restrain some of the youth from
forming such pernicious habits, so that before they were sufficiently
taught by experience and the examples before them, that to be good is to
be happy, they

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

degenerated into vice. This too often led to crime. To support their
wastefulness, they infringed the rights of others. When such men became,
in the opinions of the select worthies, incorrigible and dangerous to
society, they were transported to a land far distant to the north, the
extreme limit of the world, where a part of the year the heat is
intense. There they continue in their vicious course, pursuing the
gratification of their sensual appetites, and are punished with diseases
of body which enervate their faculties, inordinate passions which
torture their minds, and fierce desires which are incapable of being
satisfied.—The influence of their gross appetites and of the climate,
causes them to lose their fairness of complexion and beauty of form and
feature. They become dark coloured, ill favoured, and mis-shapen men,
not much superior to the brute creation. They retain, indeed, said
Surui, some of the customs and manners of Symzonia; and the ceremony of
pulling the nose in salutation by those who had strayed to the "icy
hoop," and were seen by Captain Ross, of whom I had spoken, was no doubt
a corruption of the graceful mode of salutation

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

practised where I then was. On my first appearance, they had apprehended
that I was of that outcast race; for it had been observed by those who
had conveyed delinquents to the place of exile, that the descendants of
the outcasts were enlarged in stature and size, owing to the grossness
of their habits, and at the same time that they had lost their strength
and activity. One of the pure race, it was believed, was able to lift
three times as much as any one of the degenerates, or to leap three
times as high. Their suspicions of my being of the outcast tribe, were
allayed by the testimony of reverence to the Supreme Being which I had
given, by falling on my knees, and imploring the aid of heaven in my
embarrassed situation; whereby they knew that I could not be unworthy of
their regard.

I felt not a little humbled by this account of the origin of the
northern internal people, and, cautiously avoided my observation that
might discover, to my intelligent conductor, the suspicion which darted
through my mind, that we the externals were indeed descendants of this
exiled race; some of whom, penetrating the "icy hoop" near the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

continent of Asia or America, might have peopled the external world. The
gross sensuality, intemperate passions, and beastly habits of the
externals, all testified against us.

I inquired of Surui where this place of exile was situated. He said it
was at the extreme northern part of the earth, as near the fountain of
light and heat as mortals could go, without danger of perishing by fire:
that they could only visit it in the temperate season, because during
the rest of the year, the sun was seen directly over head, when the heat
was so great as to render existence extremely painful. By this account I
knew that the place of exile must be situated somewhere on the verge of
the rim of the north polar opening, as there, and there only, could the
sun be seen directly over head, without going to the external tropic.
