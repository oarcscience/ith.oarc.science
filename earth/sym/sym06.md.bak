### CHAPTER III.

<span class="small">The author passes South Georgia, and proceeds in
search of Sandwich land—States to his officers and men his reasons for
believing in the existence of great bodies of land within the antarctic
circle, and for the opinion that the polar region is subject to great
heat in summer.—Crew mutiny at the instigation of Mr. Slim, third
mate—Happy discovery of a southern continent, which, at the unanimous
and earnest solicitation of his officers and men, lie names Seaborn's
land.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">On</span> the 10th of October we approached the
principal harbour of South Georgia, which I had no intention to enter
unless there was an appearance of an unusual abundance of seal on the
coast. When near the harbour we discovered two ships lying there with
their topmasts struck. This was evidence that there was no chance for us
in that quarter. I now told my officers and people that I thought it
useless to contend with those already in possession of the island for
the few seal it could afford, and thought it most advisable to proceed
in search of Sandwich land; where, no doubt, we could speedily obtain a
full cargo of skins, if we could find it, of

<span id="page_38">p. 38</span>

which I expressed great confidence. I strengthened their hopes by
assuring them that there was no doubt in my mind of the existence of
extensive bodies of land within the antarctic circle, which quarter had
scarcely been looked into by Christian navigators, and that my opinion
was founded upon the fact that Cook, and other navigators, had seen
large bodies of ice in latitude 70° to 71° south. This fact, I said,
indicated the existence of land, because ice could not form in a deep
salt sea uninterrupted by land, and agitated by the violent winds and
currents of the polar region. I urged that we had but to persevere in
our researches in high southern latitudes, to make sure of finding laud,
which would yield us ample fortunes, for all southern islands, when
first discovered, were found to abound in seal. Mr. Slim, the third
mate, expressed some apprehension, that great danger might be
encountered in high southern latitudes; that if we found land, the ice
might close upon us and prevent our return to our country, as it once
served a colony in Greenland. I was not much pleased with this. I have
no patience with an officer who suggests doubts

<span id="page_39">p. 39</span>

and difficulties when I have a grand project in view. I marked him, but
at the same time pretended to listen to his observations, as objections
of great weight, and then proceeded to remove them from the minds of the
officers and people, by advancing the following reasons for my belief
that the supposition of extreme cold at the pole was altogether
gratuitous.

1st. We know that the rays of the sun., uninfluenced by the atmosphere,
would rest upon the pole for six successive months.

2d. That a dense medium refracts, or bends the rays of the sun.

3d. That the amount of that refraction depends upon the extent of the
dense medium through which it has to pass.

4th. That at the pole, the rays of the sun coming to it in a very
oblique direction, must necessarily pass through our atmosphere a
greater distance than on any other part of this globe, and consequently
must there be refracted in a greater degree than elsewhere. Hence I
inferred, that in consequence of this refraction, and of its increase in
proportion to the obliquity of the direction of the rays, the sun when
in the

<span id="page_40">p. 40</span>

plane of the equator, must appear to an observer at the poles to be some
degrees above the horizon, and that the sun must recede to the north of
the equator at least live or six degrees of declination, before it would
become invisible at the south pole: therefore, as it takes fifteen days
to increase the sun's declination five degrees, it must be visible at
the poles one month longer, on account of the refraction, than it would
be without it. This conclusion is corroborated by the testimony of
Barentz, a Dutchman, who wintered in Nova Zembla. He found the sun to
rise, in latitude 76°, fifteen days sooner than was expected by
astronomical calculations. This will give the polar region seven months
constant sunshine; think of that, my shipmates, said I, seven months
constant day, with a continual stream of light and heat pouring upon the
same spot, without any interval of night to cool the earth and air. I
think if we can but find our way to the polar region, we shall be in
much more danger of being roasted alive, than of being frozen to death.
But, my lads, what Yankee sailor would hesitate to expose himself to be
roasted or frozen

<span id="page_41">p. 41</span>

alive to accomplish that which the British tars have endeavoured in vain
to do? Three hearty cheers put an end to the debate. We bore up for
*Sandwich* land, not that I had any belief in the existence of any
*such* land, for I had always been of opinion, that the English placed
this supposed land on their charts as an English discovery, stretching
it along from the polar seas to latitude 57° south, that they might,
whenever any land should be discovered in that unexplored quarter, have
a pretence for laying claim to it as a British discovery.

We had a fine gale from the S. W., and made rapid progress to the S. E.
under canvass. Although the most perfect satisfaction with the course I
had determined on appeared to prevail throughout the ship's company, Mr.
Slim came to me in my cabin, when relieved from his watch on deck, and
told me, that, however satisfactory my account of the matter might have
been to the other officers and the crew, it was not satisfactory to his
mind; and he should be glad to be informed how I accounted for the vast
bodies of ice which had invariably stopped the progress of navigators in
high

<span id="page_42">p. 42</span>

latitudes, if my notions of great heat at the poles were correct? "Take
a chair, Mr. Slim, and we will talk about it. In the first place, we
have no account of any navigator having sailed to a higher southern
latitude than 71°, and 82° appears, from the most authentic accounts, to
be the highest northern latitude that has been visited. Navigators to
these high latitudes have always found ice between the parallels of 70°
and 80°, which space that profound philosopher, John Cleve Symmes,
denominates the 'icy hoop.' It is true he has not taken the trouble to
explain to the world, in a satisfactory manner, why and wherefore this
narrow strip of ice should exist in that region; which omission, I
judge, must have arisen from the circumstance of its being obvious to
his capacious mind, that such a 'hoop' must necessarily exist,
'according to the laws of matter and motion.' The causes of it appearing
to him perfectly simple, he could not suppose it necessary to state them
to 'the most enlightened people on the face of the globe.' Now, sir, I
will explain the matter to you. At the pole, that is, ninety degrees
from the equator, there is seven months summer,

<span id="page_43">p. 43</span>

without any interval of night, as I stated on deck; and when the sun has
twenty-three and a half degrees of south declination, its rays must
strike the pole, allowing but three degrees for the effect of
refraction, on an angle of 26½° with the plane of the horizon, and must
appear nearly as high as in Scotland in the months of March and
September. It is true it does not continue at this extreme declination
for any great length of time. On the other hand, it does not recede so
far as to withdraw its rays from the pole for a single hour during seven
months of the year. This we know; and you can imagine, from the effect
of a March sun, which in your country, Mr. Slim, loosens the icy fetters
of winter, although withdrawn one half of the time, what must be its
effect when exerting its influence for months without any interruption?
Now in latitude 70°, with the exception of a few days, there is an
interval of night the year round. In the winter months the climate
cannot differ much from that of the pole. The cold is then no doubt
severe, and forms ice in both those positions. In the early part of
summer, that is, September, October, and

<span id="page_44">p. 44</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> November, there is
at the pole a steady blaze of heat and light, which must melt the ice
accumulated in winter, by causing a constant thaw. This sunshine
continues at the pole till the 1st of April, and prevents the forming of
ice until that time. But at 70°, there is, through most of these months,
a short period of night, sufficient for the atmosphere to cool. This
will be more obvious, if we consider the powerful influence of the ice,
during this absence of the sun's rays, and remember the great change of
temperature which occurs in our climate immediately after sunset at the
close of a sunny day in February or March. This interval of night in
latitude 70°, counteracts most of the effects of the sun's heat in the
day time. Nearly as much ice forms in the night as is thawed during the
day. This accounts for the 'icy hoop.' There is not summer enough to
dissipate the ice of winter; while at the pole there is summer enough to
dissolve a globe of ice."

"But, sir," rejoined Mr. Slim, "if this 'icy hoop' exists, how do you
expect to pass it? or, if it is impassable, what use is there in
encountering the risk of navigating unknown and dangerous

<span id="page_45">p. 45</span>

seas, in a high and boisterous latitude?"

"I mean, sir, to ascertain whether it be passable or not. I think it
probable that the influence of the summer heat may so far weaken it as
to admit of broad openings being formed by the pressure of wind or
currents, and if I can find an opening of but a mile wide, I shall dash
through it, at all hazards."

"And a pretty condition we shall be in, Capt. Seaborn, if the ice closes
the passage after we have dashed through it!" replied Mr. Slim. "We
shipped with you, sir, for a sealing voyage; not for a voyage of
discovery."

"You will please to remember, Mr. Slim, that I am expressly authorized
by the articles, to cruize and seek for seals wheresoever I may judge
expedient and proper, and that any opposition to my authority will
involve the forfeiture of your share—reccollect that, Mr. Slim."

"I do recollect that, sir; but at the same time I know, Capt. Seaborn,
that you have no right to hazard all our lives, by running into dangers,
greater than were ever encountered by human beings, to gratify your mad
passion for discovery, instead of pursuing

<span id="page_46">p. 46</span>

the interest of all concerned, by endeavouring to find seals in the
usual manner. How will you justify yourself to the world, to our
families, or to your own conscience, if we should, after effecting a
passage through this 'icy hoop' you speak of; find it closed against our
return, and be thus for ever lost to our wives, our children, and
society? We must in such a case all perish, and our blood would be upon
your head." A plague upon your lean carcass, thought I, how am I to
answer so many impertinent questions. I could not tell him of my belief
of open poles, affording a practicable passage to the internal world,
and of my confident expectations of finding comfortable winter quarters
inside; for he would take that as evidence of my being insane, and by
means of it persuade the crew to dispossess me of my command, and
confine me to my cabin for the remainder of the voyage. After knitting
my brows a short time, I replied, "Mr. Slim, you are a sufficiently
capable officer, and can get through with your duty well enough when you
choose to do it, but you don't know every thing; your mind is too dense
to admit the rays of intelligence. I would have you to

<span id="page_47">p. 47</span>

know, Sir, that I command this ship, and am not to be thwarted or
dictated to by any man. I have noticed your rebellious spirit; now mark
me, Sir, so sure as I have any more of your opposition to my will, or
hear any more of your murmuring; the moment I detect you in uttering one
discouraging word in the hearing of any of my officers or men,—I will
confine you, and carry you home in irons, to take your trial for
conspiring to make a revolt in the ship, which is death by the law;
remember that, and go to your duty, Sir."

Slim had some prudence, and was a great lover of pelf; he did not relish
the idea of forfeiting his share; he kept his tongue between his teeth;
but his lank, expressive features spoke horrible things. This comes of
taking more officers than there is duty for, thought I, as he left the
cabin; that fellow will give me trouble enough before I get rid of him;
there is nothing like constant hard work to keep men out of mischief.
But I had not much time for reflection, for Will Mackerel, my fourth
mate, whose birth adjoined my cabin, had overheard all that passed in my
interview with Slim, and as soon as he was

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

out of the way bolted into my cabin, without much ceremony. Will was a
hearty, frank, thorough bred sailor; doffing his hat to his commander
was the only point of etiquette he was acquainted with, and he thought
it degrading to perform that ceremony to any other person. Will
reverenced his commander when he found him to be a good sailor, a
skilful navigator, and a kind hearted man. He commenced with, "Captain
Seaborn, that fellow's insolence is unsufferable; he has spoken more
mutiny to your face, in your own cabin, in ten minutes. than all the
rest of the ship's company would dare to think of, in the forecastle,
the whole voyage. I would not give a rope yarn for a sailor who would
not go wherever the captain had courage to lead the way. I would not put
up with it; there is but one Slim in the ship, and we'll heave him
overboard, if you say the word; at least, I'd clap the ruffles <span
id="fr_0"></span>[\*](#fn_0.md) on him, and keep him out of harm's way the
rest of the voyage."

Whether it was honest indignation that prompted Will's advice, or
whether some little desire for Slim's birth, to which he would be
promoted of course if Slim

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

were cashiered, had its influence, I did not stop to ascertain. I told
Will, to be quiet, to say nothing of what had passed between me and Mr.
Slim, but to observe him closely, and let me know if he detected him in
endeavours to corrupt the crew.

We made rapid progress, and were soon in the latitude of Sandwich land,
as laid down in the charts, where we met with nothing but clear blue
ocean. I hauled up S. S. E., true course, and stood on as far as 68°
South, making the best use of my time by daylight, and drifting back
upon my track during the short interval of night. On the 2d Nov. in lat.
68½, we met with ice in detached fields; and had strong gales from S. W.
with raw, drizzly weather. I edged away to the eastward, intending to
keep near the ice, and hauled to the southward, when a clear sea would
permit. The first day, we kept the 'blink of the ice' <span
id="fr_1"></span>[\*](#fn_1.md) in sight, and found it to trend nearly East
and West. Made no southing this day. The second, we were

<span id="page_50">p. 50</span>

enabled to haul up S. E. and by E. and continued this course without
nearing the ice. The following day, hauled up S. E., set the engine in
motion, and made rapid way; we observed this day at noon, in 75° 22´ S.
I was elated with the prospect of reaching a much higher southern
[latitude](errata.htm#0.md) than any former navigator had been able to
gain, and pushed on as fast as canvas and steam could drive my vessel.

We had no interval of night in this high latitude, the sun's declination
being 15° S. After running on this course 24 hours, we lost sight of the
ice entirely, and thinking it most prudent to keep close under the lee
of the ice to windward, that in case of a hard gale we might have smooth
water, I steered due South. We observed this day, 5th Nov. in 78° 10´,
with cold, raw, disagreeable weather.

I had observed Slim moving about the ship, like an uneasy spirit
compelled to revisit this troubled world, often whispering to the men,
and frequently visiting the forecastle. When I came on deck after
dinner, the whole ship's company came aft, with Slim at their head, who
in their behalf told me, that the crew had determined to go no further
with me

<span id="page_51">p. 51</span>

into this region of ice. Will Mackerel, who was on the quarter deck,
spoke up with great passion, and asked Slim if he meant to head a
mutiny? adding, that if such was the case, he would let him see that he
was a man to stand by his commander. He then called upon those who were
of his mettle, to come over to the starboard side; which some few did,
while some took their stand amidships, that they might go either way, as
circumstances should dictate. The greater number, however, remained with
Slim. There was a sad uproar for a short time, every one having
something to say, and to enforce with an oath. Even the man on the
lookout at the mast head came down from his station to take a part in
the affair.

While this war of words was going on, Mr. Boneto, who was below, hearing
high words on deck, came up with his hanger and pistols; and the steward
brought me mine, but I ordered him to put them up again, saying, if the
men will not listen to reason, we will give up the voyage. The truth
was, I felt sensible that had I been possessed of my pistols at the
outset, I should certainly have shot Mr. Slim; but at this time the

<span id="page_52">p. 52</span>

irritation of the first impulse had subsided a little. I had had time to
cool. Mr. Albicore was standing by my side, as mute as a fish, waiting
for orders. The boatswain, Jack Whiffle his mate, and a number of the
best men, had joined Will Mackerel's party; while those who adhered to
Slim were the poorest seamen, and most timid men in the ship, though at
the same time the most noisy.

How the matter would have terminated but for a lucky occurrence is
doubtful. The vessel was running on her course during this contest, with
no one on the look out: a splash in the water, close aboard to windward,
drew my attention that way; it was a seal. At the same moment I observed
the water to be discoloured, and instantly ordered the engine to be
stopped, and a cast of the lead to be made. Some of the faithful
hastened to execute this order under the direction of Albicore and Will
Mackerel: but Slim and his malcontents kept up their vociferation, Slim
telling them that it was only a manœuvre of mine to divert them from
their purpose.

While this was going on, I swept the horizon with my spy glass, and soon
discovered in the S. W. directly to windward,

<span id="page_53">p. 53</span>

a low range of broken land. The moment I fixed my glass upon it, every
eye was turned in that direction: some sprang into the rigging, some ran
to the mast head, and the joyful cry of land ho! land! dispelled the
mutinous disposition of the crew.

Sixty-five fathoms, soft ooze, was the report of soundings; a delightful
indication of an extensive body of land, with large rivers depositing
their sediment on the bottom of the deep. We soon approached, and
observed the coast to range about S. E. and N. W. as far as the eye
could reach from the mast head. I called the attention of my officers to
this circumstance, and observed to them that the broad opening which we
had found in the 'icy hoop,' could now be easily accounted for. We had
noticed that the prevailing wind was from the S. W. with strong gales,
the influence of which was continually forcing the ice to the eastward;
but this body of land, ranging from the S. E. to the N. W. stopped the
ice to the westward of it, while that to the eastward was driven away,
leaving a clear passage to leeward of the land. From the westerly winds
prevailing all the year round, this must always be the case, unless

<span id="page_54">p. 54</span>

the 'immutable laws of matter and Motion,' and the relation between
'cause and effect' should be changed.

Mr. Slim, who had been leaning over the rail with his back towards me
during my discourse, now turned upon me, with "well said, captain, that
is the best reasoning I have heard from you yet,—I understand that." The
truth was, we were now well in with the land, and the appearance of vast
numbers of seal in the water and upon the shore; gave a prospect of a
splendid voyage, and excited Slim's cupidity, and his apprehension, for
the safety of his share, which he was aware he had jeopardized by his
conduct.

I was in excellent good humour, and told Slim I would overlook what had
passed; I could do no less, at a moment when a kind providence was
favouring my enterprise beyond my hopes, notwithstanding, my numerous
transgressions, without evincing an ungrateful and malicious spirit. The
utmost joy prevailed throughout the ship's company; even Slim's livid
countenance was distorted with an unusual grin. Slim, was not without
shrewdness, and occasionally he pretended to be very religious; but he
had a double allowance of native selfishness,

<span id="page_55">p. 55</span>

and worshipped with heartfelt devotion no other god but gold. With his
misconduct forgiven, and a prospect of gain which surpassed his most
sanguine expectations, he felt emotions as much like those of happiness,
as such a compound of evil passions could be supposed to feel.

When near the land, I observed it to be in general very low; there was
scarcely any appearance of elevated spots, and no high hills or
mountains could be seen. From the rugged appearance of the coast, I
judged that there were deep indentations, affording numerous and
convenient harbours, but in this I was mistaken. What we had taken for
the coast, proved to be a succession of islands, with a broad sound
between them and the main land, which latter had a straight, unbroken
shore. Deep water, and a very rapid current or tide, rendered it unsafe
to anchor amongst the islands; we therefore continued to coast along the
main shore in search of a harbour for several hours. The shore in this
place was not elevated more than 30 to 40 feet above the level of the
sea. It was skirted with tussoc, which, from the very

<span id="page_56">p. 56</span>

gradual rise of the land, hid all the interior from our view, except a
few moderate elevations far distant.

At 6 P. M. the appearance of a wide bay induced me to send off the boat
to examine for anchorage. At 10 they returned, with the information that
the bay afforded good shelter with soft ground, but was rather
objectionable as a harbour, in so high a latitude, on account of its
being full four miles wide, and very deep. I determined to run in and
anchor, until a more secure port could be found; and having despatched
two boats ahead to report the soundings by signal, stood into the bay,
and at 12 o'clock P. M. anchored in 10 fathoms, soft mud, the two capes
of the bay in one S. S. E. about one league, the western shore one mile
distant. Although it was midnight according to our reckoning, we had a
bright sunshine, the sun appearing ten degrees above the horizon.

This land having been first seen by myself, my officers and men united
in calling it after my name, and expressed their wish that I would
permit it to be so denominated; it was accordingly recorded in the

<span id="page_57">p. 57</span>

ship's log book by the name of Seaborn's Land.

I had much need of rest, having been almost constantly on deck for five
days; and after ordering the deck watch to get the boats out, and
prepare every thing for an excursion, I retired to my cabin, and was
soon fast asleep.
