### CHAPTER XV.

<span class="small">The Author is ordered to depart from Symzonia.—The
Best Man's reasons for sending him away.—His ineffectual efforts to
obtain a place of rendezvous for purposes of trade.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">It</span> was on my return from this visit to
the pearl wash maker, that I received notice to wait upon the Best Man.
I immediately repaired to his dwelling, with a light heart, in
expectation of my usual intellectual feast from his conversation, little
suspecting that this interview was to be the last. He received me with a
mild solemnity of manner, which warned me that the interview was for
some purpose of importance. He did not keep me in suspense, but in a
kind and benevolent manner informed me that the Wise men, to whom the
copies of my books had been given, had all made their reports, which,
together with the accounts of those who had observed the habits of
myself and people, and been in the most favourable situation to
ascertain my sentiments, had been submitted to him in council; that he
had taken full time to reflect

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

on the subject, before he determined on the painful measure which his
duty to his people imposed upon him:

That, from the evidence before him, it appeared that we were of a race
who had either wholly fallen from virtue, or were at least very much
under the influence of the worst passions of our nature; that a great
proportion of the race were governed by an inveterate selfishness, that
canker of the soul, which is wholly incompatible with ingenuous and
affectionate good-will towards our fellow-beings; that we were given to
the practice of injustice, violence, and oppression, even to such a
degree as to maintain bodies of armed men, trained to destroy their
fellow-creatures; that we were guilty of enslaving our fellow-men for
the purpose of procuring the means of gratifying our sensual appetites;
that we were inordinately addicted to traffic, and sent out our people
to the extreme parts of the external world to procure, by exchange, or
fraud, or force, things pernicious to the health and morals of those who
receive them, and that this practice was carried so far as to be
supported with armed ships, a thing unheard of, except from some very

<span id="page_197">p. 197</span>

ancient manuscript accounts of the Belzubians, which had been considered
by the Good men of Symzonia, for ages, as nothing more than fables.

After stating these and many other charges against the externals, he
added, that many of his council seriously apprehended that it was only
our inordinate thirst for gain, that had induced me and my people to
hazard our lives in an unknown region, and that it had not escaped their
notice, that my vessel was provided with terrific engines of
destruction, no doubt to enforce our will where our purposes required
it: Wherefore he, the Best Man, in council, had come to a resolution,
that the safety and happiness of his people would be endangered by
permitting any further intercourse with so corrupt and depraved a race.
He therefore required that I should repair forthwith to my vessel. and
there remain until the season of bright light was sufficiently advanced
to enable me to return to my country in safety; and ordered that all
necessary supplies of food, and whatever was wanted to refit my vessel,
should be furnished at the expense of the state; but that I should not
be permitted

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

to take away any of the products of the country which I esteemed
valuable for traffic, lest the cupidity of my countrymen should lead
them to send an armed force to obtain such things.

They were fully aware, he said, of the articles which were most coveted
by the externals; for my books had described them, and the purposes to
which they were applied; and Efficients would therefore be appointed to
examine my vessel, and see that I took away none of those articles. He
felt confident that they had additional security for a strict compliance
with this prohibitory order, in my integrity, of which he had formed a
favourable estimate, notwithstanding the corruption of my nature, and
did not apprehend that I would break through his injunctions, after
partaking so largely of the hospitality of the country.

I was petrified with confusion and shame, on hearing my race thus
described as pestiferous beings, spreading moral disease and
contamination by their intercourse, and by thus seeing all my hopes of
unbounded wealth at once laid prostrate; and I did not recover from the
despondency which overwhelmed me, till I recollected that

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mr. Boneto would
no doubt have a full cargo of seal skins ready against my return to
Seaborn's Land, which would ensure me a handsome fortune.

Any attempt to dissuade the Best Man from his purpose, or to obtain a
revocation of the decree, I knew would be altogether vain. I therefore
endeavoured to soften the judgment he had formed of the externals, by
representing the books, from which the Wise men and himself had drawn
their opinions, to be the works of the islanders whom I had described to
him as the supposed descendants of the Belzubians, and that they were
only re-printed in my country as they had been in his; that we professed
to be much more enlightened than those islanders, and styled ourselves
emphatically the most enlightened people on the face of the earth, by
which we meant no disrespect to the Symzonians, the face of the earth
being the outside of it only, and we were not sufficiently enlightened,
when the declaration was made, to know that there existed any such
people; and that there were many people amongst us who would eagerly
emulate the purity and goodness of the Symzonians,

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

could they but have the benefit of their example, and behold the
happiness which attended their course of life. I specified one numerous
class in particular, who were remarkable for simplicity of habits,
active benevolence, and good will towards mankind.

I admitted that the permission of a free intercourse with the externals,
might be productive of great mischief to his people, by introducing vice
and disease, which had been observed to spring up amongst the South Sea
islanders, and other unsophisticated nations, soon after their discovery
by Europeans and Americans; but urged that a limited intercourse, under
strict regulations, might be productive of much good; and that the
Symzonians would, in that case, enjoy the sweet reflection, that they
had contributed to the reformation of many of the externals, by the
beauty and loveliness of their example, and at the same time have the
benefit of more expanded views of the works of a beneficent Creator,
through the information which they might derive from the externals.

To effect this very desirable end, I proposed, that Token Island should
be established

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

as a place of meeting and intercourse, where the externals might erect
places of abode, and remain through the winter, and have communication
with such of the Symzonians as the Best Man, in council, might be
pleased to license for that purpose; and that the useful metal iron,
which was not to be found in Symzonia in sufficient quantities to supply
the wants of the people, was very abundant in the external world, and
would be brought and exchanged for articles which the Symzonians
considered useless, or nearly so.

The Best Man objected to this scheme. He had not forgotten the evils
related to have followed the ancient commerce with the Belzubians. He
also urged, that Token Island was situated in the worst region of the
earth, where the extreme heat and great humidity of the air would
generate violent diseases amongst those who should have the temerity to
remain there in the presence of the sun.

Unhappily, in my eagerness to carry my point, I assured him that this
would be no objection to the externals; that in the pursuit of gain,
they defied plague, pestilence, and famine; that the rich merchants who

<span id="page_202">p. 202</span>

sent out adventurers, never took the climate of a country into
consideration, viewing it as of no concern to them how many of the lives
of shipmasters and mariners might be sacrificed, nor how many widows and
orphans were thus created, provided they could make money by their
business; that the externals would come to Token Island so long as there
was any thing to be gained by it, even if one half of their number
should perish annually; and that the Symzonians could visit them in the
temperate season, when they would be quite safe.

The Best Man heard me out, and then told me I had said enough. It would
be much less dangerous to his people, he believed, to visit Token Island
in the hottest season, than to hold intercourse with such a depraved,
covetous, and sordid people at any time of the year. The plan was
inadmissible—I must prepare for my departure—The decree would be rigidly
enforced.

I expressed my reluctant acquiescence, and begged to be fully informed
of his will and pleasure, that I might not in any respect deviate from
the course I was desired to pursue. I closed by expressing a

<span id="page_203">p. 203</span>

hope, that the numerous manuscripts which the Wise and the Good had
bestowed upon me, might not be taken away, but that I might be permitted
to carry them to my country, to instruct the externals in the wisdom
they contained. After a moment's hesitation he replied, that good books
could not do harm in any world, and I might retain them. This was joyful
to my ears. I felt sure of instructive and profitable employment for
life in translating these productions for the benefit of my fellow
externals, and took my leave of the Best Man, with the comfortable
reflection that I had not discovered a new world wholly in vain.

On my return to my lodge, I found it deserted of the usual visiters,
Surui and other Efficients, appointed to provide for my wants, being the
only persons who approached or held conversation with me.—All other
persons, from this time until my departure from Symzonia, avoided me in
a manner as little calculated to hurt my feelings as possible.

My books were all returned to me; but, to mark my acquiescence in the
justice and propriety of the measures adopted by the

<span id="page_204">p. 204</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Best Man, I sent
to him by Surui my best telescope, a solar microscope, an excellent
sextant, a pair of globes, and a set of charts and maps of the external
world. The instruments being superior to any thing possessed by the
Symzonians, and all these articles being calculated to extend their
views of creation, I knew they would be highly esteemed. All these
articles were cordially received as a tribute of gratitude on my part;
and I was even given to understand, that the Best Man derived more
satisfaction from this indication of my heart, than from the possession
of the very useful and desirable things I had presented to him.
