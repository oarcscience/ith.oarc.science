### CHAPTER VII

*The true state of the Millennium, according to Characters taken from
Scripture; some mistakes concerning it, examin’d*.

WE have made sufficient proof of a Millennial state, from Scripture and
Antiquity; and upon that firm Basis have setled our second Proposition.
We should now determine the *Time* and *Place* of this future kingdom of
Christ: Not whether it is to be in Heaven, or upon Earth: for that we
suppose determin’d already; but whether it is to be in the present
Earth, and under the present constitution of Nature, or in the *New
Heavens* and *New Earth*, which are promis’d after the *Conflagration*.
This is to make our *Third Proposition:* and I should have proceeded
immediately to the examination of it, but that I imagine it will give us
some light in this affair, if we enquire further into the true state of
the *Millennium*, before we determine its Time and Place.

We have already noted some *moral* Characters of the *Millennial* state;
And the great *Natural* Character of it, is this in general, That it
will be *Paradisiacal*. Free from all inconveniences, either of external
Nature, or of our own Bodies. For my part, I do not understand how there
can be any considerable degree of

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

happiness without *Indolency*: nor how there can be Indolency, while we
have such Bodies as we have now, and such an external constitution of
Nature. And as there must be *Indolency*, where there is happiness; so
there must not be *Indigency*, or want of any due comforts of life. For
where there is *Indigency*, there is solicitude, and distraction, and
uneasiness, and fear: Passions, that do as naturally disquiet the Soul,
as pain does the Body. Therefore Indolency and Plenty seem to be two
essential Ingredients of every happy state; and these two in conjunction
make that state we call *Paradisiacal*.

Now the Scripture seems plainly to exempt the Sons of the *New
Jerusalem*, or of the *Millennium*, from all *pain* or *want*, in those
words, Apoc. 21. 4. *And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying: neither
shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away*.
And the Lord of that kingdom, *He that sate upon the Throne*, said,
*Behold I make all things new*, ver. 5. This Renovation is a
restauration to some former state: and I hope not to that state of
Indigency, and misery, and diseasedness, which we languish under at
present. But to that pristine Paradisiacal state, which was the blessing
of the first Heavens and the first Earth.

As Health and Plenty are the Blessings of Nature, so, in civil affairs,
*Peace* is the greatest blessing. And this is inseparably annext to the
*Millennium:* an indelible character of the kingdom of Christ. And by
*Peace* we understand, not onely freedom from Persecution upon religious
accounts, but that *Nation shall not rise up against Nation*, upon any
account whatsoever. That bloody Monster, *War*, that hath devour’d so
many Millions of the Sons of *Adam*, is now at length to be chain’d up:
and the Furies, that run throughout the Earth, with their Snakes and
Torches, shall be thrown into the Abyss, to sting and prey upon one
another. All evil and mischievous passions shall be extinguish'd: and
that not in men onely, but even in Brute creatures, according to the
Prophets. *The Lamb and the Lyon shall lie down together, and the
sucking Child shall play with the Basilisk*. Happy days, when not onely
the Temple of *Janus* shall be shut up for a thousand years, and the
*Nations shall beat their Swords into plowshares*: but all enmities and
antipathies shall cease, all acts of hostility, throughout all nature.
And this Universal Peace is a demonstration also of the former
character, *Universal Plenty*: for where there is want and
necessitousness, there will be quarrelling.

Fourthly, ’Tis a kingdom of Righteousness, as well as of Peace. These
also must go together; for unrighteous Persons will not live long in
peace, no more than indigent Persons. The *Psalmist* therefore joyns
them together: and *Plenty* also, as their necessary preservative: in
his description of the kingdom of Christ: Psal. 85. 10, 11, 12. *Mercy
and truth are met together: Righteousness and peace have kissed each
other. Truth shall spring out of the Earth, and righteousness shall look
down from Heaven. Yea the Lord shall give good, and our Land shall yield
her increase*. This will not be a medley-state, as the present World is,
good and bad mingled together; but a *chosen generation, a royal
Priesthood, an holy Nation, a peculiar people*. Those that have a part
in the first Resurrection, the Scripture pronounceth them *Holy and
Blessed:* and says, *the second death shall have no power over them*.
Satan also is bound and shut up in the bottomless Pit, and has

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

no liberty of tempting or seducing this people, for a thousand years:
but at the end of that time, he will meet with a degenerate crew,
separate and aliens to the Holy City,<span class="margnote">Apoc. 5.
9.</span> that will make war against it, and perish in the attempt. In a
word, those that are to enjoy this state, are always distinguish’d from
the multitude, <span class="margnote">*ch*. 7. 14.  
*ch*. 14. 3, 4.  
*ch*. 21. 27.</span> as People redeem’d from the Earth; That have wash’d
their Robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; and are
represented as Victors over the World; with such other Characters as are
incompetible to any but the righteous.

Fifthly, This will be a state under a peculiar divine presence and
conduct. It is not easie indeed to determine the manner of this
presence, but the Scripture plainly implies some extraordinary divine
presence to enlighten and enliven that state. When the *New Jerusalem*
was come down, St. *John* says,<span class="margnote">*Apoc*. 21.
3.</span> *And I heard a great voice out of Heaven, saying, Behold the
Tabernacle of God is with men: and he will dwell with them, and they
shall be his people: and God himself shall be with them and be their
God*. And the like is promis’d to the Palm-bearing Company, *Chap*. 7.
15. where they are admitted to the priviledges of the *New Jerusalem*.
When our Saviour was incarnate, and vouchsafed to dwell amongst the
Children of Men, the same phrase is us’d by this same Author, Joh. 1.
14.  <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md) *The Word was made flesh, and
Tabernacled amongst us: and we beheld his glory*, *&c*. We read it, *He
dwelt amongst us*, but render’d more closely, it is, *He* set his
*Tabernacle amongst us*. And that which the *Hebrews* call the
*Shekinah*,  <span id="fr_21"></span>[2](#fn_21.md) or *divine presence*,
comes from this very word. Therefore there will be a *Shekinah* in that
kingdom of Christ; but as to the mode of it, I am very willing to
confess my ignorance.

The last Character that belongs to this state, or rather to those that
enjoy it, is, that they are *Kings and Priests unto God*. This is a
character often repeated in Scripture, and therefore the more to be
regarded. It occurs thrice in the Apocalypse in formal terms, *Ch*. 1.
6. *Ch*. 5. 10. *Ch*. 20. 6. And as to the Regal dignity apart, that is
further exprest, either by the *donation of a kingdom*, as in *Daniel*'s
phrase, *Chap*. 7. 18, 22, 27. Or by *placing upon Thrones*, with a
judicial power; which is the New Testament style, *Matt*. 19. 28. *Luk*.
22. 29, 30. *Revel*. 20. 4. These two Titles, no doubt, are intended to
comprehend the highest honours that we are capable of: these being the
highest dignities in every kingdom; and such as were by the Ancients,
both in the East and in the West, commonly united in one and the same
Person: Their Kings being Priests, like *Melchisedeck:* or as the
*Roman* Emperour was *Pontifex Maximus*. But as to the Sacerdotal
character, that seems chiefly to respect the temper of the mind; to
signifie a People dedicated to God and his Service: Separate from the
World, and from secular affairs: Spending their time in devotion and
contemplation, which will be the great employments of that happy state.
For where there is ease, peace, and plenty of all things: refin’d
Bodies, and purified Minds, there will be more inclination to
intellectual exercises and entertainments: which they may attend upon,
without any distraction, having neither want, pain, nor worldly
business.

The Title of *King* implies a confluence of all things that constitute
temporal happiness. ’Tis the highest thing we can wish any in this
World, to be a King. So as the *Regal* dignity seems to comprehend all
the Goods of Fortune, or external felicity: And the *Sacerdotal*, the
Goods of the Mind, or internal: Both

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

which concur in the constitution of true happiness. There is also a
further force and emphasis in this notion, *of the Saints being made
Kings*, if we consider it comparatively, with respect to what they were
before in this World; where they were not only mean and despicable, in
subjection and servility, but often under persecution, abus’d and
trampled upon, by the secular and Ecclesiastical powers. But now the
Scene is chang’d, and you see the reverse of Providence, according as
*Abraham* said to the Rich *man*, *Son, remember that thou in thy life
time receivedst the good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. But
now he is comforted, and thou art tormented*. Now they are set upon
Thrones and Tribunals, who were before arraigned as Criminals, and
brought before tyrannical Judicatures. They are now Laws and Law-givers
to themselves: in a true state of Royal Liberty, neither under the
domination of evil men, nor of their own evil passions.

Some possibly may think, that this high character of *being made
Priests* and *Kings to God*, is not general to all that enjoy the
*Millennium*, but a prerogative belonging to the Apostles and some of
the chief Martyrs, who are eminently rewarded for their eminent
services. But Scripture, as far as I perceive, applyes it to all that
inherit that kingdom. *The redeemed out of every kindred, and tongue,
and people, and nation*, are made *kings and priests to God, and shall
reign on the earth*, *Apoc*. 5. 9, 10. And in the 20*th* *chap*. *ver*.
6. all the sons of the first Resurrection are made *Priests of God and
shall reign with him a thousand years*. Here is no distinction or
discrimination thus far. Not that we suppose an universal equality of
conditions in the Millennial state, but as to all these characters which
we have given of it, I do not perceive that they are restrain’d or
confin’d by Scripture to single persons, but make the general happiness
of that state, and are the portion of every one that is admitted into
the New Jerusalem.

Others possibly may think that this priviledge of the *first
Resurrection* is not common to all that enjoy the Millennial state. For
tho’ St. *John*, who is the only person that hath made express mention
of the *first Resurrection*, and of the *thousand years reign* of
Christ, does joyn these two as the same thing, and common to the same
persons; yet I know there are some that would distinguish them as things
of a different extent, and also of a different nature. They suppose the
Martyrs only will rise from the dead; and will be immediately translated
into Heaven, and there pass their *Millennium* in celestial glory. While
the Church is still here below, in her *Millennium*, such as it is; a
state indeed better than ordinary, and free from persecution: but
obnoxious to all the inconveniences of our present mortal life, and a
medly of good and bad people, without separation. This is such an Idea
of the *Millennium*, as, to my eye, hath neither beauty in it, nor
foundation in Scripture. That the Citizens of the *New Jerusalem* are
not a miscellaneous company, but a Community of righteous persons, we
have noted before: and that the state of nature will be better than it
is at present. But, besides this, what warrant have they for this
Ascension of the Martyrs into Heaven at that time? where do we read of
that in Scripture? And in those things that are not matters of Natural
Order, but of Divine Oeconomy, we ought to be very careful how we add to
Scripture.

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

The Scripture speaks only of the Resurrection of the Martyrs, *Apoc*.
20. 45. but not a word concerning their ascension into heaven. Will that
be visible? We read of our Saviour's Resurrection and Ascension, and
therefore we have reason to affirm them both. We read also of the
Resurrection and Ascension of the *Witnesses*, (*Apoc*. 11.) in a
figurate sence, and in that sence we may assert them upon good grounds.
But as to the Martyrs, we read of their Resurrection only, without any
thing exprest or imply’d about their Ascension. By what authority then
shall we add this new notion to the history or scheme of the Millennium?
The Scripture on the contrary, makes mention of the descent of the *New
Jerusalem*, *Apoc*. 21. 2. making the Earth the Theatre of all that
affair. And the Camp of the Saints is upon the Earth, *ver*. 9. and
these Saints are the same persons, so far as can be collected from the
text, that rise *from the dead, and reign’d with Christ*, and were
*Priests to God*. *ver*. 4, 5, 6. Neither is there any distinction made,
that I find, by St. *John*, of two sorts of Saints in the *Millennium*,
the one in Heaven, and the other upon Earth. Lastly, The four and twenty
Elders, *ch*. 5. 10. tho’ they were *Kings* and *Priests unto God*, were
content to reign upon Earth. Now who can you suppose of a superiour
order to these four and twenty Elders: Whether they represent the twelve
Patriarchs and twelve Apostles, or whomsoever they represent, they are
plac’d next to him that sit upon the Throne,<span
class="margnote">*chap*. 11. 16.</span> and they have Crowns of Gold
upon their heads, *ch*. 4. 4. there can be no marks of honour and
dignity greater than these are; and therefore seeing these highest
Dignitaries in the Millennium or future kingdom of Christ, are to reign
upon Earth, there is no ground to suppose the assumption of any other
into Heaven upon that account, or upon that occasion.

This is a short and general draught of the Millennial state, or future
Reign of the Saints, according to Scripture. Wherein I have endeavour’d
to rectifie some mistakes or misconceptions about it: That viewing it in
its true nature, we may be the better able to judge when and where it
will obtain. Which is the next thing to be consider’d.
