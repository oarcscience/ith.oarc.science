###### A

## REVIEW

###### OF THE

## THEORY

###### OF THE

# EARTH

TO take a review of this Theory of the Earth, which we have now
finish’d, We must consider, first, the extent of it: and then the
principal parts whereof it consists. It reaches, as you see, from one
end of the World to the other: From the first Chaos to the last day, and
the Consummation of all things. This, probably, will run the length of
Seven Thousand Years: which is a good competent space of time to
exercise our thoughts upon, and to observe the several Scenes which
Nature and Providence bring into View within the compass of so many
Ages.

The matter and principal parts of this Theory, are such things as are
recorded in Scripture. We do not feign a Subject, and then descant upon
it, for diversion; but endeavour to give an intelligible and rational
account of such matters of Fact, past or future, as are there specified
and declar’d. What it hath seem’d good to the Holy Ghost to communicate
to us, by History or Prophecy, concerning the several States and general
Changes of this Earth, makes the Argument of our Discourse. Therefore
the Things themselves must be taken for granted, in one sence or other:
seeing, besides all other proofs, they have the authority of a
Revelation; and our business is only to give such an explication of
them, as shall approve it self to the faculties of man, and be
conformable to Scripture.

We will therefore first set down the things themselves, that make the
subject matter of this Theory: and remind you of our explication of
them. Then recollect the general proofs of that explication, from reason
and nature: but more fully and particularly shew how it is grounded upon
Scripture. The primary *Phænomena* whereof we are to give an account,
are these Five or Six.

I. *The original of the Earth from a Chaos*.

II\. *The state of Paradise, and the Ante-diluvian World*.

III\. *The Universal Deluge*.

IV\. *The Universal Conflagration*.

V. *The Renovation of the World, or the New Heavens and New Earth*.

VI\. *The Consummation of all things*.

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

These are unquestionably in Scripture: and these all relate, as you see,
to the several forms, states, and revolutions of this Earth. We are
therefore oblig’d to give a clear and coherent account of these
Phænomena, in that order and consecution wherein they stand to one
another.

There are also in Scripture some other things, relating to the same
Subjects, that may be call’d the secondary ingredients of this Theory,
and are to be referr’d to their respective primary heads. Such are, for
instance,

I. *The Longevity of the Ante-diluvians*.

II\. *The Rupture of the Great Abyss, at the Deluge*.

III\. *The appearing of the Rainbow after the Deluge: as a sign that
there never should be a second Flood*.

These things Scripture hath also left upon record: as directions and
indications how to understand the Ante-diluvian state, and the Deluge it
self. Whosoever therefore shall undertake to write the Theory of the
Earth, must think himself bound to give us a just explication of these
secondary Phænomena, as well as of the primary; and that in such a
dependance and connexion, as to make them give and receive light from
one another.

This part of the Task is concerning the World behind us, Times and
Things pass’d, that are already come to light. The remainder is
concerning the World before us, Times and Things to come: that lie yet
in the bosome of Providence, and in the seeds of Nature. And these are
chiefly the *Conflagration* of the World, and the *Renovation* of it.
<span class="margnote">1 *Cor*. 15.  
*Apoc*. 20.</span>When these are over and expir’d, then comes the end,
as St. *Paul* says. Then *the Heavens and the Earth fly away*, as St.
*John* says. Then is the *Consummation* of all things, and the last
period of this sublunary World, whatsoever it is. Thus far the Theorist
must go, and pursue the motions of Nature, till all things are brought
to rest and silence. And in this latter part of the Theory, there is
also a collateral Phænomenon, the *Millennium*, or Thousand years Reign
of Christ and his Saints, upon Earth, to be consider’d. For this,
according as it is represented in Scripture, does imply a change in the
Natural World, as well as in the Moral: and therefore must be accounted
for, in the Theory of the Earth. At least it must be there determin’d,
whether that state of the World, which is singular and extraordinary,
will be before or after the Conflagration.

These are the Principals and Incidents of this Theory of the Earth, as
to the matter and subject of it: which, you see, is both important, and
wholly taken out of Scripture. As to our explication of these points,
that is sufficiently known, being set down at large in four Books of
this Theory. Therefore it remains only, having seen the matter of the
Theory, to examine the Form of it, and the proofs of it: for from these
two things it must receive its censure. As to the form, the characters
of a regular Theory seem to be these three; *Few and easie Postulatums:*
*Union of Parts:* and a *Fitness to answer, fully and clearly, all the
Phænomena to which it is to be apply’d*.

We think our Hypothesis does not want any of these Characters. As to the
First, we take but one single *Postulatum* for the whole Theory: and
that an easie one, warranted both by Scripture and Antiquity: Namely,
*That this Earth rise*,

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

*at first, from a Chaos*. As to the second, *Union of parts*, The whole
Theory is but one Series of Causes and Effects from that first Chaos.
Besides, you can scarce admit any one part of it, first, last, or
intermediate, but you must, in consequence of that, admit all the rest.
Grant me but that the Deluge is truly explain’d, and I’le desire no more
for proof of all the Theory. Or, if you begin at the other end, and
grant the *New Heavens* and *New Earth* after the Conflagration, you
will be led back again to the first Heavens and first Earth that were
before the Flood. For St. *John* says, that *New Earth* was without a
*Sea:* *Apoc*. 21. 1. And it was a *Renovation*, or *Restitution* to
some former state of things: there was therefore some former Earth
without a Sea; which not being the present Earth, it must be the
Ante-diluvian. Besides, both St. *John*, and the Prophet *Isaias*, have
represented the New Heavens and New Earth, as *Paradisiacal*; According
as is prov’d, *Book the* 4*th*. *ch*. 2. And having told us the form of
the New-future-Earth, that it will have *no Sea*, it is a reasonable
inference that there was no Sea in the *Paradisiacal Earth*. However
from the form of this Future Earth, which St. *John* represents to us,
we may at least conclude, That an *Earth without a Sea* is no Chimæra,
or impossibility: but rather a fit seat and habitation for the Just and
the Innocent.

Thus you see the parts of the Theory link and hold fast one another:
according to the second character. And as to the third, of being *suited
to the Phænomena*, we must refer that to the next head, of *Proofs*. It
may be truly said, that bare coherence and union of parts is not a
sufficient proof; The parts of a Fable or Romance may hang aptly
together, and yet have no truth in them. This is enough indeed to give
the title of a just Composition to any work, but not of a true one: till
it appear that the conclusions and explications are grounded upon good
natural evidence, or upon good Divine authority. We must therefore
proceed now to the third thing to be consider’d in a Theory, *What* its
Proofs are: or the grounds upon which it stands, whether Sacred or
Natural.

According to Natural evidence, things are proved from their Causes or
their Effects. And we think we have this double order of proofs for the
truth of our Hypothesis. As to the method of Causes, we proceed from
what is more simple, to what is more compound: and build all upon one
foundation. Go but to the Head of the Theory, and you will see the
Causes lying in a train before you, from first to last. And tho’ you did
not know the Natural history of the World, past or future, you might, by
intuition, foretell it, as to the grand revolutions and successive faces
of Nature, through a long series of Ages. If we have given a true
account of the motions of the Chaos, we have also truly form’d the first
habitable Earth. And if that be truly form’d, we have thereby given a
true account of the state of Paradise, and of all that depends upon it.
And not of that onely, but also of the universal Deluge. Both these we
have shewn in their causes: The one from the Form of that Earth, and the
other from the Fall of it into the Abyss. And tho’ we had not been made
acquainted with these things by Antiquity, we might, in contemplation of
the Causes, have truly conceiv’d them, as properties or incidents to the
First Earth. But as to the Deluge, I do not say, that we might have
calculated the Time, manner, and other circumstances of it: These things

<span id="page_384">p. 384</span>

were regulated by Providence, in subordination to the Moral World. But
that there would be, at one time or other, a disruption of that Earth,
or of the Great Abyss: and in consequence of it, an universal Deluge: So
far, I think, the light of a Theory might carry us.

Furthermore, In consequence of this disruption of the Primeval Earth, at
the Deluge, <span class="margnote">*Theor*. *book* 3 *ch*. 7, &
8.</span> the present Earth was made hollow and cavernous: and by that
means, (due preparations being used) capable of *Combustion*, or of
perishing by an universal Fire: Yet, to speak ingenuously, This is as
hard a step to be made, in vertue of Natural causes, as any in the whole
Theory. But in recompence of that defect, the Conflagration is so
plainly and literally taught us in Scripture, and avow’d by Antiquity,
that it can fall under no dispute, as to the thing it self. And as to a
capacity or disposition to it in the present Earth, that I think is
sufficiently made out.

Then, the Conflagration admitted, in that way it is explain’d in the
3*d*. Book: The Earth, you see, is, by that fire, reduc’d to a second
Chaos. A Chaos truly so call’d. And from that, as from the First, arises
another Creation, or *New Heavens* and a *New Earth*; By the same
causes, and in the same form, with the Paradisiacal. This is the
*Renovation* of the World: The *Restitution* of all things: mentioned
both by Scripture and Antiquity: and by the Prophet *Isaiah*, St.
*Peter* and St. *John*, call’d the *New Heavens* and *New Earth*. With
this, as the last period, and most glorious Scene of all humane affairs,
our Theory concludes, as to this method of Causes, whereof we are now
speaking.

I say, here it ends as to the *method of Causes*. For tho’ we pursue the
Earth still further, even to its last Dissolution: which is call’d the
Consummation of all things: yet all, that we have superadded upon that
occasion, is but Problematical: and may, without prejudice to the
Theory, be argued and disputed on either hand. I do not know, but that
our conjectures there may be well grounded: but however, not springing
so directly from the same root, or, at least, not by ways, so clear and
visible, I leave that part undecided. Especially seeing we pretend to
write no more than the *Theory of the Earth*, and therefore as we begin
no higher than the *Chaos*, so we are not obliged to go any further than
to the last state of a Terrestrial consistency: which is that of the New
Heavens and the New Earth.

This is the first natural proof, From the order of Causes. The second is
from the consideration of Effects. Namely of such effects as are already
in being. And therefore this proof can extend onely to that part of the
Theory, that explains the present and past form and Phænomena of the
Earth. What is Future, must be left to a further trial, when the things
come to pass, and present themselves to be examin’d and compar’d with
the Hypothesis. As to the present Form of the Earth, we call all Nature
to witness for us: The Rocks and the Mountains, the Hills and the
Valleys, the deep and wide Sea, and the Caverns of the Ground: Let these
speak, and tell their origine: How the Body of the Earth came to be thus
torn and mangled: If this strange and irregular structure was not the
effect of a ruine: and of such a ruine as was universal over the face of
the whole Globe. But we have given such a full explication of this, in
the

<span id="page_385">p. 385</span>

first part of the Theory, from *Chapt*. *the* 9*th*. to the end of that
Treatise, that we dare stand to the judgment, of any that reads those
four Chapters; to determine if the Hypothesis does not answer all those
Phænomena, easily and adequately.

The next Phænomenon to be consider’d, is the *Deluge*, with its
adjuncts. This also is fully explain’d by our Hypothesis, in the 2*d*.
3*d*. and 6*th*. Chapters of the first Book. Where it is shewn, that the
*Mosaical Deluge*, that is, an universal Inundation of the whole Earth,
above the tops of the highest Mountains, made by a breaking open of the
Great Abyss, (for thus far *Moses* leads us) is fully explain’d by this
Hypothesis, and cannot be conceiv’d in any other method. There are no
sources or stores of Water sufficient for such an effect: that may be
drawn upon the Earth, and drawn off again, but by supposing such an
Abyss, and such a Disruption of it, as the Theory represents.

Lastly, As to the Phænomena of Paradise and the Ante-diluvian World, we
have set them down in order in the 2*d*. Book: and apply’d to each of
them its proper explication, from the same Hypothesis. We have also
given an account of that Character which Antiquity always assign’d to
the first age of the World, or the Golden Age, as they call’d it:
namely, *Equality of Seasons* throughout the Year, or a perpetual
Equinox. We have also taken in all the adjuncts or concomitants of these
States, as they are mention’d in Scripture. *The Longevity* of the
Ante-diluvians, and the declension of their age by degrees, after the
Flood. As also that wonderful Phænomenon, the Rainbow: which appear’d to
*Noah* for a Sign, that the Earth should never undergo a second Deluge.
<span class="margnote">*Theor*. *Book* 2. *chap*. 5.</span>And we have
shewn, wherein the force and propriety of that Sign consisted, for
confirming *Noah*'s faith in the promise and in the divine veracity.

Thus far we have explain’d the past Phænomena of the Natural World. The
rest are Futurities, which still lie hid in their Causes; and we cannot
properly prove a Theory from effects that are not yet in being. But so
far as they are foretold in Scripture, both as to substance and
circumstance, in prosecution of the same Principles we have ante-dated
their birth, and shew’d how they will come to pass. We may therefore, I
think, reasonably conclude, That this Theory has performed its task and
answer’d its title: having given an account of all the general changes
of the Natural World, as far as either Sacred History looks backwards,
or Sacred Prophecy looks forwards. So far as the one tells us what is
past in Nature, and the other what is to come. And if all this be
nothing but an appearance of truth, ’tis a kind of fatality upon us to
be deceiv’d.
