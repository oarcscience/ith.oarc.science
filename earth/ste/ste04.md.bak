### CHAPTER I

#### *THE INTRODUCTION*

*An Account of the whole Work; of the Extent and general Order of it*.

SINCE I was first inclin’d to the Contemplation of Nature, and took
pleasure to trace out the Causes of Effects, and the dependance of one
thing upon another in the visible Creation, I had always, methought, a
particular curiosity to look back into the first Sources and ORIGINAL of
Things; and to view in my mind, so far as I was able, the Beginning and
Progress of a RISING WORLD.

And after some Essays of this Nature, and, as I thought, not
unsuccessful, I carried on my enquiries further, to try whether this
*Rising World*, when form’d and finisht, would continue always the same;
in the same form, structure, and consistency; or what changes it would
successively undergo, by the continued action of the same Causes that
first produc’d it; And, lastly, what would be its final Period and
Consummation. This whole Series and compass of things taken together, I
call’d a COURSE OF NATURE, or a SYSTEM OF NATURAL PROVIDENCE; and
thought there was nothing belonging to the External World more fit or
more worthy our study and meditation, nor any thing that would conduce
more to discover the ways of Divine Providence, and to show us the
grounds of all true knowledge concerning Nature. And therefore to clear
up the several parts of this Theory, I was willing to lay aside a great
many other Speculations, and all those dry subtleties with which the
Schools, and the Books of Philosophers, are usually fill’d.

But when we speak of a *Rising World*, and the Contemplation of it, we
do not mean this of the *Great Universe*; for who can describe the
Original of that? But we speak of the *Sublunary World*, This Earth and
its dependencies, which rose out of a Chaos about six thousand years
ago; And seeing it hath fain to our lot to act upon this Stage, to have
our present home and residence here, it seems most reasonable, and the
place design’d by Providence, where we should. first imploy our thoughts
to understand the works of God and Nature. We have accordingly therefore
design’d in this Work to give an account of the Original of the Earth,
and of all the great and general changes that it hath already undergone,
or is hence forwards to undergo, till the Consummation of all things.
For if

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

from those Principles we have here taken, and that Theory we have begun
in these two first Books, we can deduce with success and clearness the
Origin of the Earth, and those States of it that are already past;
Following the same Thred, and by the conduct of the same Theory, we will
pursue its Fate and History through future Ages, and mark all the great
Changes and Conversions that attend it *while Day and Night shall last*;
that is, so long as it continues an Earth.

By the States of the Earth that are already past, we understand chiefly
*Paradise* and the *Deluge*; Names well known, and as little known in
their Nature. By the Future States we understand the *Conflagration*,
and what new Order of Nature may follow upon that, till the whole Circle
of Time and Providence be compleated. As to the first and past States of
the Earth, we shall have little help from the Ancients, or from any of
the Philosophers, for the discovery or description of them; We must
often tread unbeaten paths, and make a way where we do not find one; but
it shall be always with a Light in our hand, that we may see our steps,
and that those that follow us may not follow us blindly. There is no
Sect of Philosophers that I know of that ever gave an account of the
Universal Deluge, or discover’d, from the contemplation of the Earth,
that there had been such a thing already in Nature. ’Tis true, they
often talk of an alternation of *Deluges* and *Conflagrations* in this
Earth, but they speak of them as things to come; at least they give no
proof or argument of any that hath already destroyed the World. As to
*Paradise*, it seems to be represented to us by the *Golden Age*;
whereof the Ancients tell many stories, sometimes very luxuriant, and
sometimes very defective: For they did not so well understand the
difference betwixt the New-made Earth and the Present, as to see what
were the just grounds of the Golden Age, or of Paradise: Tho’ they had
many broken Notions concerning those things. As to the *Conflagration*
in particular, This hath always been reckon’d One amongst the Opinions
or Dogmata of the Stoicks, *That the World was to be destroy’d by Fire*,
and their Books are full of this Notion; but yet they do not tell us the
Causes of the Conflagration, nor what preparations there are in Nature,
or will be, towards that great Change. And we may generally observe this
of the *Ancients*, that their Learning or Philosophy consisted more in
Conclusions, than in Demonstrations; They had many truths among them,
whereof they did not know themselves the premisses or the proofs: Which
is an argument to me, that the knowledge they had, was not a thing of
their own invention, or which they came to by fair reasoning and
observations upon Nature, but was delivered to them from others by
Tradition and Ancient fame, sometimes more publick, sometimes more
secret: These Conclusions they kept in mind, and communicated to those
of their School, or Sect, or Posterity, without knowing, for the most
part, the just grounds and reasons of them.

’Tis the Sacred writings of Scripture that are the best monuments of
Antiquity, and to those we are chiefly beholden for the History of the
first Ages, whether Natural History or Civil. ’Tis true, the Poets, who
were the most ancient Writers amongst the Greeks, and serv’d them both
for Historians, Divines, and Philosophers, have deliver’d some things
concerning the first Ages of the World, that have a fair resemblance of
truth, and some affinity with those accounts that are

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

given of the same things by sacred Authors, and these may be of use in
due time and place; but yet, lest any thing fabulous should be mixt with
them, as commonly there is, we will never depend wholly upon their
credit, nor assert any thing upon the authority of the Ancients which is
not first prov’d by natural Reason, or warranted by Scripture.

It seems to me very reasonable to believe, that besides the precepts of
Religion, which are the principal subject and design of the Books of
holy Scripture, there may be providentially conserv’d in them the memory
of things and times so remote, as could not be retriev’d, either by
History, or by the light of Nature; and yet were of great importance to
be known, both for their own excellency, and also to rectifie the
knowledge of men in other things consequential to them: Such points may
be, *Our great Epocha* or the Age of the Earth, The Origination of
mankind, The first and Paradisiacal state, The destruction of the Old
World by an universal Deluge, The longevity of its inhabitants, The
manner of their preservation, and of their peopling the Second Earth;
and lastly, The Fate and Changes it is to undergo. These I always lookt
upon as the Seeds of great knowledge, or heads of Theories fixt on
purpose to give us aim and direction how to pursue the rest that depend
upon them. But these heads, you see, are of a mixt order, and we propose
to our selves in this Work only such as belong to the Natural World;
upon which I believe the trains of Providence are generally laid; And we
must first consider how God hath order’d Nature, and then now the
Oeconomy of the Intellectual World is adapted to it; for of these two
parts consists the full System of Providence. In the mean time, what
subject can be more worthy the thoughts of any serious person, than to
view and consider the Rise and Fall, and all the Revolutions, not of a
Monarchy or an Empire, of the *Grecian* or *Roman* State, but of an
intire World.

The obscurity of these things, and their remoteness from common
knowledge will be made an argument by some, why we should not undertake
them; And by others, it may be, the very same thing will be made an
argument why we should; for my part I think *There is nothing so secret
that shall not be brought to Light*, within the compass of *Our World*;
for we are not to understand that of the whole Universe, nor of all
Eternity, our capacities do not extend so far; But whatsoever concerns
this Sublunary World in the whole extent of its duration, from the Chaos
to the last period, this I believe Providence hath made us capable to
understand, and will in its due time make it known. All I say, betwixt
the first Chaos and the last Completion of Time and all things
temporary, This was given to the disquisitions of men; On either hand is
Eternity, before the World and after, which is without our reach: But
that little spot of ground that lies betwixt those two great Oceans,
this we are to cultivate, this we are Masters of, herein we are to
exercise our thoughts, to understand and lay open the treasures of the
Divine Wisdom and Goodness hid in this part of Nature and of Providence.

As for the difficulty or obscurity of an argument, that does but add to
the pleasure of contesting with it, when there are hopes of victory; and
success does more than recompence all the pains. For there is no sort of
joy more grateful to the mind of man, than that which ariseth from the
invention of Truth; especially

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

when ’tis hard to come by. Every man hath a delight suited to his
Genius, and as there is pleasure in the right exercise of any faculty,
so especially in that of Right-reasoning; which is still the greater, by
how much the consequences are more clear, and the chains of them more
long: There is no Chase so pleasant, methinks, as to drive a Thought, by
good conduct, from one end of the World to the other; and never to lose
sight of it till it fall into Eternity, where all things are lost as to
our knowledge.

This Theory being chiefly Philosophical, Reason is to be our first
Guide; and where that falls short, or any other just occasion offers
itself, we may receive further light and confirmation from the Sacred
writings. Both these are to be lookt upon as of Divine Original, God is
the Author of both; He that made the Scripture made also our Faculties,
and ’twere a reflection upon the Divine Veracity, for the one or the
other to be false when rightly us’d. We must therefore be careful and
tender of opposing these to one another, because that is, in effect, to
oppose God to himself. As for Antiquity and the Testimonies of the
Ancients, we only make general reflections upon them, for illustration
rather than proof of what we propose; not thinking it proper for an
English Treatise to multiply citations out of Greek or Latin Authors.

I am very sensible it will be much our interest, that the Reader of this
Theory should be of an ingenuous and unprejudic’d temper; neither does
it so much require Book-learning and Scholarship, as good natural sence
to distinguish True and False, and to discern what is well prov’d, and
what is not. It often happens that Scholastick Education, like a Trade,
does so fix a man in a particular way, that he is not fit to judge of
any thing that lies out of that way; and so his Learning becomes a clog
to his natural parts, and makes him more indocile, and more incapable of
new thoughts and new improvements, than those that have only the Talents
of Nature. As Masters of exercise had rather take a Scholar that never
learn’d before, than one that hath had a bad Master; so generally one
would rather chuse a Reader without art, than one ill-instructed; with
learning, but opinionative and without judgment: yet it is not necessary
they should want either, and Learning well plac’d strengthens all the
powers of the mind. To conclude, just reasoning and a generous love of
Truth, whether with or without Erudition, is that which makes us most
competent Judges what is true; and further than this, in the perusal and
examination of this Work, as to the Author as much candor as you please,
but as to the Theory we require nothing but attention and impartiality.
