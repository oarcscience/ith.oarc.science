*THE CONCLUSION*

IF the Conflagration of the World be a reality, as, both by Scripture
and Antiquity, we are assur’d it is: If we be fully perswaded and
convinc’d of this: ’Tis a thing of that nature, that we cannot keep it
long in our thoughts, without making some moral reflections upon it.
’Tis both great in it self, and of universal concern to all Mankind. Who
can look upon such an Object, *A World in Flames*, without thinking with
himself, Whether shall I be in the midst of these flames, or no? What is
my security that I shall not fall under this fiery vengeance, which is
the wrath of an angry God? St. *Peter*,<span class="margnote">2 Epist.
3. 11.</span> when he had deliver’d the doctrine of the Conflagration,
makes this pious reflection upon it: *Seeing* 

<span id="page_307">p. 307</span>

*then that all these things shall be dissolv’d, what manner of persons
ought you to be, in holy conversation and godliness?* The strength of
his argument depends chiefly upon what he had said before in the 7*th*
Verse, where he told us, that the *present Heavens and Earth were
reserv’d unto fire, against the Day of judgment, and the perdition of
irreligious men*. We must avoid the crime then, if we would escape the
punishment. But this expression of *irreligious* or *ungodly men*, is
still very general. St. *Paul*, when he speaks of this fiery
indignation, and the Persons it is to fall upon, is more distinct in
their characters. He seems to mark out for this destruction, three sorts
of men chiefly, *The Atheists, Infidels, and the Tribe of Antichrist*.
These are his words:<span class="margnote">2 *Thess*. 1. 7, 8.</span>
*When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty
Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that known not God:
and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ*. Then as for
Anti-christ and his adherents, he says, in the 2*d*. Chapt. and 8*th*.
Verse, *The Lord shall consume that Wicked one with the Spirit of his
mouth, and shall destroy him with the brightness of his coming*, or of
his Presence. These, you see, all refer to the same time with St.
*Peter*: namely, to the coming of our Saviour, at the Conflagration; and
three sorts of Persons are characteriz’d as his Enemies, and set out for
destruction at that time. First, those that know not God: that is, that
acknowledge not God, that will not own the Deity. Secondly, those that
hearken not to the Gospel; that is, that reject the Gospel and Christian
Religion, when they are preach’d and made known to them. For you must
not think that it is the poor barbarous and ignorant Heathens, that
scarce ever heard of God, or the Gospel, that are threaten’d with this
fiery vengeance. No, ’tis the Heathens that live amongst Christians;
those that are Infidels, as to the existence of God, or the truth of
Christian Religion, tho’ they have had a full manifestation of both.
These are properly the Adversaries of God and Christ. And such
adversaries, St. *Paul* says in another place,<span
class="margnote">*Heb*. 10. 27.</span> *A fearful judgment, and fiery
indignation shall devour:* which still refers to the same time, and the
same Persons we are speaking of. Then as to the third sort of Men,
Anti-christ and his Followers, besides this Text of St. *Paul* to the
*Thessalonians*, ’tis plain to me in the Apocalypse, that *Mystical
Babylon* is to be consum’d by fire: and the *Beast* and *False Prophet*
to be thrown into the *Lake that burns with fire and brimstone*: Which
Lake is no where to be found till the Conflagration.

You see then for whom *Tophet* is prepar’d of old. For Atheists,
Infidels, and Anti-christian Persecutors. And they will have for their
Companions, the Devil and his Angels, the heads of the Apostasie. These
are all in open rebellion against God and Christ, and at defiance, as it
were, with Heaven. Excepting Anti-christ, who is rather in a secret
conspiracy, than an open rebellion. For, under a pretended Commission
from Jesus Christ, He persecutes his Servants, dishonours his Person,
corrupts his Laws and his Government, and makes War against his Saints.
And this is a greater affront and provocation, if possible, than a
barefac’d opposition would be.

There are other Men, besides these, that are unacceptable to God: All
sorts of sinners and wicked persons: but they are not so properly the
Enemies of God, as these we have mention’d. An intemperate Man is an
Enemy to himself, and

<span id="page_308">p. 308</span>

an injust Man is an Enemy to his Neighbour: But those that deny God, or
Christ, or persecute their Servants, are directly and immediately
Enemies to God. And therefore when the Lord comes in flames of fire to
triumph over his Enemies: To take vengeance upon all that are Rebels or
Conspirators against him and his Christ; these Monsters of Men will be
the first and most exemplary Objects of the divine wrath and
indignation.

To undertake to speak to these three Orders of men, and convince them of
their errour, and the danger of it, would be too much for the Conclusion
of a short Treatise. And as for the third sort, the Subjects of
Antichrist, none but the Learned amongst them are allow’d to be
inquisitive, or to read such things as condemn their Church, or the
Governors of it. Therefore I do not expect that this English Translation
should fall into many of their hands. But those of them, that are
pleas’d to look into the Latin, will find, in the Conclusion of it, a
full and fair warning to come out of Babylon: which is there prov’d to
be the Church of Rome. Then as to those that are Atheistically inclin’d,
which I am willing to believe are not many, I desire them to consider,
How mean a thing it is, to have hopes onely in this Life: and how
uneasie a thing, to have nothing but fears as to the Future. Those,
sure, must be little narrow Souls, that can make themselves a portion
and a sufficiency out of what they enjoy here: That think of no more,
that desire no more. For what is this life, but a circulation of little
mean actions? We lie down and rise again: dress and undress: feed and
wax hungry: work, or play, and are weary: and then we lie down again,
and the circle returns. We spend the day in trifles, and when the Night
comes, we throw our selves into the Bed of folly, amongst dreams and
broken thoughts and wild imaginations. Our reason lies a-sleep by us;
and we are, for the time, as arrant Brutes, as those that sleep in the
Stalls, or in the Field. Are not the Capacities of Man higher than
these? and ought not his ambition and expectations to be greater? Let us
be Adventurers for another World: ’Tis, at least, a fair and noble
Chance: and there is nothing in this, worth our thoughts or our
passions. If we should be disappointed, we are still no worse than the
rest of our fellow-mortals: and if we succeed in our expectations, we
are eternally happy.

For my part, I cannot be perswaded, that any man of Atheistical
inclinations can have a great and generous Soul. For there is nothing
great in the World, if you take God out of it. Therefore such a person
can have no great thought, can have no great aims, or expectations, or
designs: for all must lie within the compass of this Life, and of this
dull Body. Neither can he have any great instincts or noble passions:
For if he had, they would naturally excite in him greater Ideas, inspire
him with higher notions, and open the Scenes of the Intellectual World.
Lastly, He cannot have any great sence of Order, Wisdom, Goodness,
Providence, or any of the Divine Perfections. And these are the greatest
things that can enter into the thoughts of man, and that do most enlarge
and ennoble his mind. And therefore I say again, That, He that is
naturally inclined to Atheism, being also naturally destitute of all
these, must have a little and narrow soul.

<span id="page_309">p. 309</span>

But you’l say, it may be, This is to expostulate rather than to prove:
or to upbraid us with our make and temper, rather than to convince us of
an error in speculation. ’Tis an error it may be in practice, or in
point of prudence; but we seek Truth, whether it make for us or against
us: convince us therefore by just reasoning and direct arguments, that
there is a God, and then wee’l endeavour to correct these defects in our
natural complexion. You say well; and therefore I have endeavour’d to do
this before, in another part of this Theory, in the *Second Book*, *ch*.
11. Concerning the *Author of Nature*: where you may see, that the
Powers of Nature, or of the Material World, cannot answer all the
Phænomena of the Universe, which are there represented. This you may
consult at leisure. But, in the mean time, ’tis a good perswasive why we
should not easily give our selves up to such inclinations or opinions,
as have neither generosity, nor prudence on their side. And it cannot be
amiss, that these persons should often take into their thoughts, this
last scene of things, The *Conflagration* of the World. Seeing if there
be a God, they will certainly be found in the number of his Enemies, and
of those that will have their portion in the Lake that burns with Fire
and Brimstone.

The Third sort of persons that we are to speak to, are the Incredulous,
or such as do not believe the truth of *Christian Religion*, tho’ they
believe there is a God. These are commonly men of Wit and Pleasure, that
have not patience enough to consider, coolely and in due order, the
grounds upon which it appears, that Christian Religion is from Heaven,
and of Divine Authority. They ought, in the first place, to examine
*matter of Fact*, and the History of our Saviour: That there was such a
Person, in the Reigns of *Augustus* and *Tiberius*, that wrought such
and such Miracles in *Judæa*; taught such a Doctrine: was Crucified at
*Jerusalem*: rise from the dead the Third Day, and visibly ascended into
Heaven. If these matters of Fact be denied, then the controversie turns
only to an Historical question, *Whether* the Evangelical History be a
fabulous, or true History: which it would not be proper to examine in
this place. But if matter of Fact recorded there, and in the Acts of the
Apostles, and the first Ages of Christianity, be acknowledged, as I
suppose it is, then the Question that remains is this, *Whether* such
matter of Fact does not sufficiently prove the divine authority of Jesus
Christ and of his Doctrine. We suppose it possible, for a person to have
such Testimonials of divine authority, as may be sufficient to convince
Mankind, or the more reasonable part of Mankind; And if that be
possible, what, pray, is a-wanting in the Testimonies of Jesus Christ?
The Prophecies of the Old Testament bear witness to him: His Birth was a
miracle, and his Life a train of Miracles: not wrought out of levity and
vain ostentation, but for useful and charitable purposes. His Doctrine
and Morality not only blameless, but Noble: designed to remove out of
the World the imperfect Religion of the *Jews*, and the false Religion
of the *Gentiles*: All Idolatry and Superstition: and thereby to improve
Mankind, under a better, and more perfect dispensation. He gave an
example of a spotless innocency in all his Conversation, free from Vice
or any evil; and liv’d in a neglect of all the Pomp or Pleasures of this
Life, referring his happiness wholly to another World. He Prophesied
concerning his own Death, and his Resurrection: and concerning the
destruction of *Jerusalem*: which all came to pass in a signal manner.
He also

<span id="page_310">p. 310</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Prophesied of the Success of his Gospel: which,
after his Death, immediately took root, and spread it self every way
throughout the World: maugre all opposition or persecution, from *Jews*
or *Heathens*. It was not supported by any temporal power for above
three hundred Years: nor were any arts us’d, or measures taken,
according to humane prudence, for the conservation of it. But, to omit
other things, That grand article of his Rising from the Dead, Ascending
visibly into Heaven, and pouring down the miraculous Gifts of the Holy
Ghost, (according as he had promis’d) upon his Apostles and their
followers: This alone is to me a Demonstration of his Divine Authority.
To conquer Death: To mount, like an Eagle, into the Skies: and to
inspire his followers with inimitable gifts and faculties, are things,
without controversie, beyond all humane power: and may and ought be
esteemed sure Credentials of a person sent from Heaven.

From these matters of Fact we have all possible assurance, that Jesus
Christ was no Impostor or deluded person: (one of which two Characters
all unbelievers must fix upon him) but Commission’d by Heaven to
introduce a New Religion: to reform the World: to remove Judaism and
Idolatry; The Beloved Son of God, the great Prophet of the latter Ages,
the True Messiah that was to come.

It may be you will confess, that these are great arguments that the
Author of our Religion was a Divine Person, and had supernatural powers:
but withal, that there are so many difficulties in Christian Religion,
and so many things un-intelligible, that a rational man knows not how to
believe it, tho’ he be inclin’d to admire the person of Jesus Christ. I
answer, If they be such difficulties as are made only by the Schools and
disputacious Doctors, you are not to trouble your self about them, for
they are of no Authority. But if they be in the very words of Scripture,
then ’tis either in things practical, or in things meerly speculative.
As to the Rules of Practice in Christian Religion, I do not know any
thing in Scripture, obscure or unintelligible. And as to Speculations,
great discretion and moderation is to be us’d in the conduct of them. If
these matters of Fact, which we have alledg’d, prove the Divinity of the
Revelation, keep close to the Words of that Revelation, asserting no
more than it asserts, and you cannot err. But if you will expatiate, and
determine modes, and forms, and consequences; you may easily be puzled
by your own forwardness. For besides some things that are, in their own
nature, Infinite and Incomprehensible, there are many other things in
Christian Religion that are incompleatly reveal’d; the full knowledge
whereof, it has pleased God to reserve to another life, and to give us
only a summary account of them at present. We have so much deference for
any Government, as not to expect that all their Councels and secrets
should be made known to us, nor to censure every action whose reasons we
do not fully comprehend; much more in the Providential administration of
a World, we must be content to know so much of the Councels of Heaven
and of supernatural Truths, as God has thought fit to reveal to us. And
if these Truths be no otherwise than in a general manner, summarily and
incompleatly revealed in this life, as commonly they are, we must not
therefore throw off the Government, or reject the whole Dispensation: of
whose Divine Authority we have otherways full proof and satisfactory
evidence. For this would be, To lose the Substance in catching at a
Shadow.

<span id="page_311">p. 311</span>

But men that live continually in the noise of the World, amidst business
and pleasures, their time is commonly shar’d betwixt those two. So that
little or nothing is left for Meditation; at least, not enough for such
Meditations as require length, justness, and order. They should retire
from the crowd for one Month or two, to study the truth of Christian
Religion, if they have any doubt of it. They retire sometimes to cure a
Gout, or other Diseases, and diet themselves according to rule: but they
will not be at that pains, to cure a disease of the mind, which is of
far greater and more fatal consequence. If they perish by their own
negligence or obstinacy, the Physician is not to blame. Burning is the
last remedy in some distempers: and they would do well to remember, that
the World will flame about their heads one of these days: and whether
they be amongst the Living, or amongst the Dead, at that time, the
Apostle makes them a part of the Fewel, which that fiery vengeance will
prey upon. Our Saviour hath been true to his word hitherto: whether in
his promises, or in his threatnings; He promis’d the Apostles to send
down the Holy Ghost upon them after his Ascension, and that was fully
accomplish’d. He foretold and threaten’d the destruction of *Jerusalem*:
and that came to pass accordingly, soon after he had left the World. And
he hath told us also, that he will come again in the<span
class="margnote">*Matt*. 24. 30. &  
25. 31, *&c*.</span> *Clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory*; and
that will be to judge the World. *When the Son of Man shall come in his
glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then shall he sit upon the
Throne of his glory. And before him shall be gather’d all Nations*, and
he will separate the good from the bad; and to the wicked and
unbelievers he will say, *Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting
fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels*. This is the same Coming,
and the same Fire, with that which we mention’d before out of St.
*Paul*.<span class="margnote">*Ver*. 41.</span> As you will plainly see,
if you compare St. *Matthew*'s words with St. *Paul*'s, which are
these,<span class="margnote">2 *Thess*. 1. 7, 8, 9.</span> *When the
Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty Angels: In
flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that
hearken not to the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. Who shall be
punished with everlasting destruction, from, or by the presence of the
Lord, and the glory of his power*. This, me-thinks, should be an
awakening thought, that there is such a threatening upon record, (by one
who never yet fail’d in his word) against those that do not believe his
Testimony. Those that reject him now as a Dupe, or an Impostor, run a
hazard of seeing him hereafter coming in the Clouds to be their Judge.
And it will be too late then to correct their errour, when the bright
Armies of Angels fill the Air, and the Earth begins to melt at the
Presence of the Lord.

Thus much concerning those three ranks of Men, whom the Apostle St.
*Paul* seems to point at principally, and condemn to the flames. But, as
I said before, the rest of sinners and vitious Persons amongst the
Professors of Christianity, tho’ they are not so directly the Enemies of
God, as these are; yet being transgressors of his Law, they must expect
to be brought to Justice. In every well-govern’d State, not onely
Traitors and Rebels, that offend more immediately against the Person of
the Prince, but all others, that notoriously violate the Laws, are
brought to condign punishment, according to the nature and degree of
their crime. So in this case, *The fire shall try every man's work, of
what sort it is*. ’Tis

<span id="page_312">p. 312</span>

therefore the concern of every man to reflect often upon that Day, and
to consider what his fate and sentence is likely to be, at that last
Trial. The *Jews* have a Tradition that *Elias* sits in Heaven, and
keeps a Register of all Men's actions, good or bad. He hath his
Under-Secretaries for the several Nations of the World, that take
minutes of all that passes: and so hath the history of every man's life
before him, ready to be produc’d at the Day of Judgment. I will not
vouch for the literal truth of this, but it is true in effect. Every
man's fate shall be determin’d that Day, according to the history of his
life: according to the works done in the flesh, whether good or bad. And
therefore it ought to have as much influence upon us, as if every single
action was formally register’d in Heaven.

If Men would learn to contemn this World, it would cure a great many
Vices at once. And, me-thinks, St. *Peter*'s argument, from the
approaching dissolution of all things, should put us out of conceit with
such perishing vanities. Lust and Ambition are the two reigning Vices of
great Men: and those little fires might be soon extinguish’d, if they
would frequently and seriously meditate on this last and universal Fire;
which will put an end to all passions and all contentions. As to
Ambition, the Heathens themselves made use of this argument, to abate
and repress the vain affectation of glory and greatness in this World. I
told you before the lesson that was given to *Scipio Africanus*, by his
Uncle's Ghost, upon this Subject. And upon a like occasion and
consideration, *Cæsar* hath a lesson given him by *Lucan*, after the
Battle of *Pharsalia*; where *Pompey* lost the day, and *Rome* its
liberty. The Poet says, *Cæsar* took pleasure in looking upon the dead
Bodies, and would not suffer them to be buried, or, which was their
manner of burying, to be burnt. Whereupon he speaks to Him in these
words:

*Hos, Cæsar, populos si nunc non usserit Ignis,  
Uret cum Terris, uret cum gurgite Ponti.  
Communis mundo superest Rogus, Ossibus astra  
Misturus. Quocunque Tuam Fortuna vocabit,  
Hæ quoque eunt Animæ; non altiùs ibis in auras,  
Non meliore loco Stygiâ sub nocte jacebis.  
Libera fortuna Mors est: Capit omnia Tellus  
Quæ genuit: Cœlo tegitur Qui non habet urnam*.

Cæsar,

*If now these Bodies want their fire and urn,  
At last, with the whole Globe, they’l surely burn.  
The World expects one general Fire: and Thou  
Must go where these poor Souls are wand’ring now.  
Thou’l reach no higher, in th’ Ethereal plain,  
Nor ’mongst the shades a better place obtain.  
Death equals all: And He that has not room  
To make a Grave, Heav'ns Vault shall be his Tomb*.

These are mortifying thoughts to ambitious Spirits. And surely our own
Mortality, and the Mortality of the World it self, may be enough to
convince all considering Men, That, *Vanity of Vanities, all is Vanity
under the Sun*: any otherwise than as they relate to a better Life.
