### CHAPTER III

*That the World will be destroy’d by Fire, is the doctrine of the
Ancients, especially of the Stoicks. That the same doctrine is more
ancient than the Greeks, and deriv’d from the Barbarick Philosophy, and
That probably from* Noah*; the Father of all Traditionary Learning. The
same doctrine expresly authoriz’d by Revelation, and inroll’d into the
Sacred Canon*.

THAT the present World, or the present frame of Nature, will be
destroy’d, we have already shewn. In what manner this destruction will
be, by what force or what kind of fate, must be our next enquiry. The
Philosophers have always spoken of *Fire* and *Water*, those two unruly
Elements, as the only Causes that can destroy the World, and work our
ruine; And accordingly they say, all the great and fatal Revolutions of
Nature, either past or to come, depend upon the violence of these Two;
when they get the mastery, and overwhelm all the rest and the whole
Earth, in a Deluge or Conflagration. But as they make these Two the
Destroying Elements, so they also make them the Purifying Elements. And
accordingly in the Lustrations, or their rites and ceremonies for
purging sin, Fire and Water were chiefly made use of, both amongst the
*Romans*, *Greeks* and *Barbarians*. And when these Elements over-run
the world, it is not, they say, for a final destruction of it, but to
purge Mankind and Nature from their Impurities. As for purgation by Fire
and Water, the stile of our Sacred Writings

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

does very much accommodate it self to that sence; and the Holy Ghost,
who is the great Purifier of Souls, is compared in his operation upon
us, and in our regeneration, to fire or water. And as for the external
world, St. *Peter*<span class="margnote">1 *Ep*. 3. 21.  
1 *Cor*. 3. 13.*  
Mal*. 3. 2, 3.</span> makes the Flood to have been a kind of *Baptising*
or renovation of the world. And St. Paul and the Prophet *Malachy* make
the last Fire, to be a purging and refining fire. But to return to the
Ancients.

The *Stoicks* especially, of all other Sects amongst the *Greeks*, have
preserved the doctrine of the Conflagration, and made it a considerable
part of their Philosophy, and almost a character of their order. This is
a thing so well known that I need not use any Citations to prove it. But
they cannot pretend to have been the first authors of it neither. For,
besides that amongst the *Greeks* themselves, *Heraclitus* and
*Empedocles*, more ancient than *Zeno*, the Master of the *Stoicks*,
taught this doctrine, ’tis plainly a branch of the Barbarick Philosophy,
and taken from thence by the *Greeks*. For it is well known that the
most ancient and mystick learning amongst the *Greeks*, was not
originally their own, but borrowed of the more Eastern Nations, by
*Orpheus*, *Pythagoras*, *Plato*, and many more: who travel’d thither,
and traded with the Priests for knowledge and Philosophy; and when they
got a competent stock, returned home, and set up a School, or a Sect, to
instruct their Country-men. But before we pass to the Eastern nations,
let us, if you please, compare the *Roman* Philosophy upon this subject,
with that of the *Greeks*.

The *Romans* were a great people, that made a shew of Learning, but had
little in reality, more than words and Rhetorick. Their curiosity or
emulation in Philosophical Studies was so little, that it did not make
different Sects and Schools amongst them, as amongst the *Greeks*. I
remember no Philosophers they had but such as *Tully*, *Seneca*, and
some of their Poets. And of these *Lucretius*, *Lucan* and *Ovid*, have
spoken openly of the Conflagration. *Ovid*'s Verses are well known,

*Esse quoque in fatis reminiscitur, affore tempus,  
Quo mare, quo Tellus, correptaque Regia Cœli  
Ardeat, & mundi moles operosa laboret*.

*A Time decreed by Fate, at length will come,  
When Heavens and Earth and Seas shall have their doom;  
A fiery doom: And Nature's mighty frame  
Shall break, and be dissolv’d into a flame*.

We see *Tully*'s sence upon this matter in *Scipio*'s *Dream*. When the
old man speaks to his Nephew *Africanus*, and shews him from the clouds,
this spot of Earth, where we live; He tells him, tho’ our actions shou’d
be great, and fortune favour them with success, yet there wou’d be no
room for any lasting glory in this World; for the World it self is
transient and fugitive. And a Deluge or a Conflagration, which
necessarily happen after certain periods of time, sweep away all records
of humane actions. As for *Seneca*, he being a profest *Stoick*, we need
not doubt of his opinion in this point. We may add here, if you please,
the *Sibylline verses*, which were kept with great Religion, in the
Capitol at *Rome*, and consulted with much ceremony upon solemn
occasions. These *Sibyls* were

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

the Prophetesses of the *Gentiles*, and tho’ their writings now have
many spurious additions, yet none doubt but that the Conflagration of
the World was one of their original Prophecies.

Let us now proceed to the Eastern nations. As the *Romans* receiv’d the
small skill they had in the Sciences, from the *Greeks*; so the *Greeks*
receiv’d their chief mystick learning from the *Barbarians*: that is,
from the *Ægyptians*, *Persians*, *Phœnicians*, and other Eastern
Nations: For ’tis not onely the Western or Northern people, that they
call’d *Barbarians*, but indeed all Nations besides themselves. For that
is commonly the vanity of great Empires, to uncivilize in a manner all
the rest of the World; and to account all those People *Barbarous*, that
are not subject to their dominion. These however, whom they call’d so,
were the most ancient People, and had the first learning that was ever
heard of after the Flood. And amongst these, the *Ægyptians* were as
famous as any: whose Sentiment in this particular of the Conflagration
is well known. For *Plato*, who liv’d amongst them several years, tells
us in his *Timæus*, that it was the doctrine of their Priests, that the
fatal Catastrophes of the World were by *Fire* and *Water*. In like
manner the *Persians* made their beloved God, *Fire*, at length to
consume all things that are capable of being consum’d. For that is said
to have been the doctrine of *Hydaspes*, one of their great *Magi* or
Wise men.<span class="margnote">*Just. Mar. Apol.* 2.</span> As to the
*Phœnicians*, I suspect very much that the Stoicks had their Philosophy
from them, and amongst other things the Conflagration. We shall take
notice of that hereafter.

But to comprehend the *Arabians* also, and *Indians*, give me leave to
reflect a little upon the story of the *Phœnix*. A story well known, and
related by some ancient Authors, and is in short this. The *Phœnix*,
they say, is a Bird in *Arabia*, *India*, and those Eastern parts,
single in her kind, never more than one at a time, and very long-liv'd:
appearing onely at the expiration of the *Great Year*, as they call it:
And then she makes her self a Nest of Spices, which being set on fire by
the Sun, or some other secret power, she hovers upon it, and consumes
her self in the flames. But, which is most wonderful, out of these ashes
riseth a second *Phœnix*; so that it is not so much a death as a
renovation. I do not doubt but the story is a fable, as to any such kind
of Bird, single in her species, living and dying, and reviving in that
manner: But ’tis an Apologue, or a Fable with an interpretation, and was
intended as an Emblem of the World: which, after a long age, will be
consum’d in the last fire: and from its ashes or remains will arise
another world, or a new-form’d Heavens and Earth. This, I think, is the
true mystery of the *Phœnix*, under which Symbol the Eastern Nations
preserv’d the doctrine of the Conflagration and renovation of the World.
They tell some-what a like story of the Eagle, soaring a-loft so near
the Sun, that by his warmth and enlivening rays, she renews her age and
becomes young again. To this the *Psalmist* is thought to allude: Psal.
103. 5. *Thy Youth shall be renew’d like the Eagles:* which the
*Chaldee* Paraphrast renders, *In mundo venturo renovabis, sicut Aquilæ,
juventutem tuam*. These things to me seem plainly to be symbolical,
representing that World to come, which the Paraphrast mentions, and the
fireing of this. And this is after the manner of the Eastern Wisdom;
which always lov’d to go fine, cloath’d in figures and fancies.

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

And not onely the Eastern *Barbarians*, but the Northern and Western
also, had this doctrine of the Conflagration amongst them. The
*Scythians*, in their dispute with the *Ægyptians* about antiquity,
argue upon both suppositions, of Fire or Water, destroying the last
World, or beginning this. And in the West, the *Celts*, the most ancient
People there, had the same tradition; for the *Druids*, who were their
Priests and Philosophers, deriv’d, not from the *Greeks*, but of the old
race of Wise men, that had their Learning traditionally, and, as it
were, hereditary from the first ages: These, as *Strabo* tells us,<span
class="margnote">*l*. 4.</span> gave the World a kind of immortality by
repeated renovations; and the principle that destroy’d it, according to
them, was always Fire or Water. I had forgot to mention in this List,
the *Chaldeans:* whose opinion we have from *Berosus* in *Seneca*.<span
class="margnote">*Nat. Quæst*. 3. c. 29.</span> They did not onely teach
the Conflagration, but also fixt it to a certain period of time, when
there should happen a great Conjunction of the Planets in Cancer.
Lastly, we may add, to close the account, the Modern *Indian*
Philosophers, the reliques of the old *Bragmans*; These, as
*Maffeus*<span class="margnote">*l*. 16. *Hist. Ind*.</span> tells us,
declare, that the World will be renew’d, after an Universal
Conflagration.

You see of what extent and universality throughout all Nations, this
doctrine of the Conflagration hath been. Let us now consider what
defects or excesses there are, in these ancient opinions, concerning
this fate of the World, and how they may be rectified: That we may admit
them no further into our belief, than they are warranted by reason, or
by the authority of Christian Religion. The first fault they seem to
have commited about this point, is this, That they made these
revolutions and renovations of nature, indefinite or endless: as if
there would be such a succession of Deluges and Conflagrations to all
eternity. This, the *Stoicks* seem plainly to have asserted, as appears
from *Eumenius*, *Philo*, *Simplicius*, and Others. St. *Jerome*<span
class="margnote">*Epist*. 60.</span> imputes this Opinion also to
*Origen*: but he does not always hit the true sence of that Father, or
is not fair and just in the representation of it. Whosoever held this
Opinion, ’tis a manifest errour, and may be easily rectified by the
Christian Revelation; which teaches us plainly, that there is a final
period and consummation of all things that belong to this Sublunary or
Terrestrial world. When the *Kingdom shall be deliver’d up to the
Father:* and Time shall be no more.

Another Errour they committed in this doctrine, is, the Identity, or
sameness, if I may so say, of the worlds, succeeding one another. They
are made indeed of the same Lump of matter, but they suppos’d them to
return also in the same Form. And, which is worse, that there would be
the same face of humane affairs; The same Persons and the same actions
over again; So as the second World would be but a bare repetition of the
former, without any variety or diversity. Such a revolution is commonly
call’d the *Platonick Year:* A period, when all things return to the
same posture they had some thousands of years before; As a Play acted
over again, upon the same Stage, and to the same Auditory. This is a
groundless and injudicious supposition. For, whether we consider the
nature of things; The Earth after a dissolution, by Fire or by Water,
could not return into the same form and fashion it had before; Or
whether we consider Providence, it would no ways suit with the Divine
Wisdom and Justice to bring upon the

<span id="page_250">p. 250</span>

stage again those very Scenes, and that very course of humane affairs,
which it had so lately condemn’d and destroy’d. We may be assured
therefore, that, upon the dissolution of a World, a new order of things,
both as to Nature and Providence, always appears: And what that new
order will be, in both respects, after the *Conflagration*, I hope we
shall, in the following Book, give a satisfactory account.

These are the opinions, true or false, of the Ancients; and chiefly of
the *Stoicks*, concerning the mystery of the Conflagration. It will not
be improper to enquire in the last place, how the *Stoicks* came by this
doctrine: whether it was their discovery and invention, or from whom
they learned it. That it was not their own invention, we have given
sufficient ground to believe, by shewing the antiquity of it beyond the
times of the *Stoicks*. Besides, what a man invents himself, he can give
the reasons and causes of it, as things upon which he founded his
invention: But the *Stoicks* do not this, but according to the ancient
traditional way, deliver the conclusion without proof or premisses. We
nam’d *Heraclitus* and *Empedocles* amongst the *Greeks* to have taught
this doctrine before the *Stoicks*: And, according to *Plutarch*,<span
class="margnote">*De defec. Orac*.</span> *Hesiod* and *Orpheus*,
authors of the highest antiquity, sung of this last Fire, in their
Philosophick Poetry. But I suspect the *Stoicks* had this doctrine from
the *Phœnicians*; for if we enquire into the original of that Sect, we
shall find that their Founder *Zeno*, was a Barbarian or Semi-barbarian,
deriv’d from the *Phœnicians*, as *Laertius* and *Cicero* give an
account of him. And the *Phœnicians* had a great share in the Oriental
knowledge, as we see by *Sanchoniathon*'s remains in *Eusebius*. And by
their mystical Books which *Suidas* mentions, from whence *Pherecydes*,
*Pythagoras* his Master, had his learning. We may therefore reasonably
presume that it might be from his Countrey-men, the *Phœnicians*, that
*Zeno* had the doctrine of the *Conflagration*. Not that he brought it
first into *Greece*, but strongly reviv’d it, and made it almost
peculiar to his Sect.

So much for the *Stoicks* in particular, and the *Greeks* in general. We
have also, you see, trac’d these Opinions higher, to the first Barbarick
Philosophers: who were the first race of Philosophers after the Flood.
But *Josephus* tells a formal story of Pillars set up by *Seth*, before
the Flood; implying the foreknowledge of this Fiery destruction of the
World, even from the beginning of it. His words<span
class="margnote">*l*. 1. *c*. 3.</span> are to this effect, give what
credit to them you think fit. *Seth and his fellow students having found
out the knowledge of the cœlestial Bodies, and the order and disposition
of the Universe; and having also receiv’d from* Adam *a Prophecy, that
the World should have a double destruction, one by Water, another by
Fire; To preserve and transmit their knowledge, in either case, to
posterity. They raised two Pillars, one of Brick, another of Stone, and
ingrav’d upon them their Philosophy and inventions*. *And one of these
pillars*, the Author says, *was standing in* Syria,  <span
id="fr_12"></span>[1](#fn_12.md) *even to his time*. I do not press the
belief of this story; there being nothing, that I know of, in Antiquity
Sacred or prophane, that gives a joint testimony with it. And those that
set up these Pillars, do not seem to me to have understood the nature of
the Deluge or *Conflagration*; if they thought a Pillar, either of Brick
or Stone, would be secure, in those great dissolutions of the Earth. But
we have pursued this doctrine high enough without the help of these
ante-diluvian Antiquities: namely, to the earliest people and the first
appearances of Wisdom after

<span id="page_251">p. 251</span>

the Flood. So that, I think, we may justly look upon it as the doctrine
of *Noah*, and of his immediate posterity. And as that is the highest
source of learning to the present World; so we should endeavour to carry
our Philosophical Traditions to that Original: for I cannot perswade my
self but that they had amongst them, even in those early days, the main
strokes or conclusions of the best Philosophy: or, if I may so say, a
form of sound doctrine concerning Nature and Providence. Of which
matter, if you will allow me a short digression, I will speak my
thoughts in a few words.

In those first Ages of the World after the Flood, when *Noah* and his
Children peopled the Earth again, as he gave them Precepts of morality
and piety for the conduct of their manners: which are usually call’d
*Præcepta Noachidarum*, the *Precepts of Noah*, frequently mention’d
both by the Jews and Christians: So also he deliver’d to them, at least,
if we judge aright, certain Maximes or Conclusions about Providence, the
state of Nature, and the fate of the World: And these, in proportion,
may be call’d *Dogmata Noachidarum*, the *Doctrines* of *Noah*, and *his
Children*. Which made a Systeme of Philosophy or secret knowledge
amongst them, deliver’d by Tradition from Father to Son; but especially
preserv’d amongst their Priests and Sacred Persons, or such others as
were addicted to Contemplation. This I take to be more ancient than
*Moses* himself, or the *Jewish* Nation. But it would lead me too far
out of my way, to set down in this place, the reasons of my judgment.
Let it be sufficient to have pointed onely at this Fountain-head of
knowledge, and so return to our Argument.

We have heard, as it were, a Cry of Fire, throughout all Antiquity, and
throughout all the People of the Earth. But those alarums are sometimes
false, or make a greater noise than the thing deserves. For my part, I
never trust Antiquity barely upon its own account, but always require a
second witness, either from Nature, or from Scripture: What the voice of
Nature is, we shall hear all along in the following Treatise: Let us
then examine at present, what testimony the Prophets and Apostles give
to this ancient doctrine of the Conflagration of the World. The Prophets
see the World a-fire at a distance and more imperfectly, as a brightness
in the Heavens, rather than a burning flame: but St. *Peter* describes
it, as if he had been standing by, and seen the Heavens and Earth in a
red fire: heard the cracking flames and the tumbling Mountains: 2 *Pet*.
3. 10. In the day of the Lord, *The Heavens shall pass away with a great
noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat: The Earth also,
and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up*. Then, after a pious
Ejaculation, he adds, Ver. 12. *Looking for and hastening the coming of
the day of God, wherein the Heavens, being on fire, shall be dissolved;
and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat*. This is as lively, as a
Man could express it, if he had the dreadful spectacle before his Eyes.
St. *Peter* had before taught the same doctrine (*ver*. 5, 6, 7.) but in
a more Philosophick way; describing the double fate of the World, by
water and fire, with relation to the Nature and Constitution of either
World, past or present. *The Heavens and the Earth were of old,
consisting of water and by water: whereby, the World that then was,
being overflow’d with water, perished. But the Heavens and the Earth
which are now, by the same Word are kept in store, reserved unto fire* 

<span id="page_252">p. 252</span>

*against the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly, or Atheistical
men*. This testimony of St. *Peter* being full, direct, and explicit,
will give light and strength to several other passages of Scripture,
where the same thing is exprest obscurely or by allusion. As when St.
*Paul* says,<span class="margnote">1 *Cor*. 3 12, 13.*  
Mat*. 13. 40. 41, 42.  
2 *Thess*. 2. 7, 8.</span> *The fire shall try every mans work in that
day*. And our Saviour says, *The tares shall be burnt in the fire, at
the end of the World*. Accordingly it is said, both by the Apostles and
Prophets, that *God* will come to judgment *in Fire*. St. *Paul* to the
*Thessalonians*, promiseth the persecuted Righteous, rest and ease,
*When the Lord shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in
flaming fire: taking vengeance on them that know not God*, *&c*. And so
to the *Hebrews*, St. *Paul* says,<span class="margnote">*ch*. 10.
27.</span> that for wilful Apostates there remaineth no more Sacrifice
for sin, *but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery
indignation, which shall devour the adversaries*, or enemies of God. And
in the 12*th*. Chapter,<span class="margnote">*Ver*. 26, 27, 28,
29.</span> he alludes to the same thing, when after he had spoken of
*shakeing the Heavens* and the *Earth* once more, he exhorteth, as St.
*Peter* does upon the same occasion, to *reverence and godly fear, For
our God is a consuming Fire*.

In like manner the Prophets, when they speak of destroying the wicked,
and the Enemies of God and Christ, at the end of the world, represent it
as a destruction *by Fire*. Psalm the 11*th*. 6. *Upon the wicked the
Lord shall rain coals, fire, and brimstone, and a burning tempest: This
shall be the portion of their Cup*. And *Psal*. 50. 3. *Our God shall
come, and will not be slow: A fire shall devour before him, and it shall
be very tempestuous round about him*. And in the beginning of those two
triumphal Psalms, the sixty-eight, and ninety-seventh, we see plain
allusions to this coming of the Lord in fire. The other Prophets speak
in the same style, Of a fiery indignation against the wicked, in the day
of the Lord: As in *Isaiah* 66. 15.<span class="margnote">*and ch*. 34.
8, 9, 10.</span> *For behold the Lord will come with fire, and with his
Chariots like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke
with flames of fire*. And in *Daniel*, (c. 7. 9, 10.) The Ancient of
days is plac’d upon his Seat of Judgment, cover’d in flames. *I beheld
till the Thrones were set, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose
garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool:
His Throne was like the fiery flame, his wheels as burning fire. A fiery
stream issued and came forth from before him: Thousand thousands
ministred unto him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before
him: The judgment was set, and the Books were opened*. The Prophet
*Malachy* (c. 4. 1.) describes the Day of the Lord to the same effect,
and in like colours; *Behold the Day cometh, that shall burn as an Oven:
and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be as stubble;
and the day that cometh shall burnt them up, saith the Lord of Hosts,
that it shall leave them neither root nor branch*. And that nature her
self, and the Earth shall suffer in that fire, the Prophet *Zephany*
tells us, (c. 3. 8.) *All the Earth shall be devoured with the fire of
my jealousie*. Lastly, this consumption of the Earth by fire, even to
the foundations of it, is exprest livelily by *Moses* in his Song,
*Deut*. 32. 22. *A fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn unto the
lowest Hell: and shall consume the Earth with her increase, and set on
fire the foundations of the Mountains*.

If we reflect upon these Witnesses; and especially the first and last,
*Moses* and St. *Peter*: at what a great distance of time they writ
their Prophecies, and yet how well they agree, we must needs conclude
that they were acted by the same

<span id="page_253">p. 253</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Spirit: and a Spirit that see thorough all the
Ages of the World, from the beginning to the end. These Sacred Writers
were so far distant in time from one another, that they could not confer
together, nor conspire, either in a false testimony, or to make the same
prediction. But being under one common influence and inspiration, which
is always consistent with it self, they have dictated the same things,
tho’ at two thousand years distance sometimes from one another. This
besides many other considerations, makes their authority incontestable.
And upon the whole account, you see, that the doctrine of the future
*Conflagration of the World*, having run through all Ages and Nations,
is, by the joynt consent of the Prophets and Apostles, adopted into the
Christian Faith.
