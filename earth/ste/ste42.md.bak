### CHAPTER XI

*An Account of those extraordinary Phænomena and Wonders in Nature,
that, according to Scripture, will precede the coming of Christ, and the
Conflagration of the World*.

IF we reflect upon the History of Burning Mountains, we cannot but
observe, that, before their Eruptions, there are usually some changes in
the Earth or in the Air, in the Sea or in the Sun it self; as signs and
forerunners of the ensuing storm. We may then easily conclude that when
the last great Storm is a coming,

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

and all the Vulcano's of the Earth ready to burst, and the frame of the
World to be dissolv’d, there will be previous signs, in the Heavens and
on the Earth,' to introduce this Tragical fate. Nature cannot come to
that extremity, without some symptomes of her illness; nor die silently,
without pangs or complaint. But we are naturally heavy of belief as to
Futurities, and can scarce fancy any other Scenes, or other state of
nature, than that is present, and continually before our eyes; we will
therefore, to cure our unbelief, take Scripture for our guide, and keep
within the limits of its Predictions.

The Scripture plainly tells us of Signs or Prodigies that will precede
the coming of our Saviour, and the end of the World; both in the Heavens
and on the Earth. The Sun, Moon, and Stars, will be disturb’d in their
motion or aspect; The Earth and the Sea will roar and tremble, and the
Mountains fall at his Presence. These things both the Prophets and
Evangelists have told us; But what we do not understand, we are slow to
believe; and therefore those that cannot apprehend how such Changes
should come to pass in the Natural World, chuse rather to allegorize all
these expressions of Scripture, and to make them signifie no more than
political changes of Governments and Empires; and the great confusions
that will be amongst the People and Princes of the Earth towards the end
of the World. So that *darkning of the Sun, shaking of the Earth*, and
such like phrases of Scripture, according to these Interpreters, are to
be understood onely in a moral sence.

And they think they have a warrant for this interpretation from the
Prophetick style of the old Testament, where the destruction of Cities,
and Empires, and great Princes, is often describ’d by such figures,
taken from the Natural World. So much is true indeed as to the phrase of
the old Prophets in some places; but I take the true reason and design
of that, to be a typical adumbration of what was intended should
literally come to pass in the great and universal destruction of the
World; whereof these partial destructions were onely shadows and
pre-figurations. But to determine this case, Let us take the known and
approved rule for interpreting Scripture, *Not to recede from the
literal sence without necessity*, or where the nature of the subject
will admit of a literal interpretation. Now as to those cases in the old
Testament, history and matter of fact do show that they did not come to
pass literally, therefore must not be so understood; But as for those
that concern the end of the World, as they cannot be determin’d in that
way, seeing they are yet *future*; So neither is there any Natural
repugnancy or improbability that they should come literally to pass: On
the contrary, from the intuition of that state of Nature, one would
rather conclude the probability or necessity of them. That there may and
must be such disorders in the external World before the general
dissolution. Besides, if we admit Prodigies in any case, or Providential
indications of God's judgments to come, there can be no case suppos’d,
wherein it will be more reasonable or proper to admit them, than when
they are to be the Messengers of an Universal vengeance and destruction.

Let us therefore consider what signs Scripture hath taken notice of, as
destin’d to appear at that time, to publish, as it were, and proclaim
the approaching end of the World; And how far they will admit of a
natural explication, according to

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

those grounds we have already given, in explaining the causes and manner
of the Conflagration. These Signs are chiefly, Earthquakes, and
extraordinary commotions of the Seas. Then the darkness or bloudy colour
of the Sun and Moon; The shaking of the Powers of Heaven, the
fulgurations of the Air and the falling of Stars. As to Earthquakes, we
have upon several occasions shown, that these will necessarily be
multiplied towards the end of the World; when, by an excess of drought
and heat, exhalations will more abound within the Earth; and, from the
same causes, their inflammation also will be more frequent, than in the
ordinary state of nature. And as all Bodies, when dry’d, become more
porous and full of Vacuities; so the Body of the Earth will be at that
time: And the Mines or Cavities wherein the fumes and exhalations lodge,
will accordingly be of greater extent, open into one another, and
continued through long tracts and regions; By which means, when an
Earthquake comes, as the shock will be more strong and violent, so it
may reach to a vast compass of ground, and whole Islands or Continents
be shaken at once, when these trains have taken fire. The effects also
of such concussions, will not onely affect Mankind, but all the Elements
and the Inhabitants of them.

I do not wonder therefore that frequent and great Earthquakes should be
made a sign of an approaching Conflagration; and the highest expressions
of the Prophets concerning the *Day of the Lord*, may be understood in a
literal sence, if they be finally referr’d to the general destruction of
the World, and not terminated solely upon those particular Countries or
People, to whom they are at first directed. Hear what *Ezekiel* says
upon this subject:<span class="margnote">*Ch*. 38. 19, 20, 22.</span>
*For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken; Surely in
that Day there shall be a great shaking in the Land of Israel. So that
the Fishes of the Sea, and the Fowls of the Heaven, and the Beasts of
the Field, and all creeping things that creep upon the Earth; and all
the Men that are upon the face of the Earth, shall shake at my presence;
and the Mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall,
and every wall shall fall to the ground. And I will rain an over flowing
rain, and great hail-stones, fire and brimstone*. The Prophet *Isaias*
describes<span class="margnote">*ch*. 24. 18, 19, 20</span> these
judgments in terms as high, and relating to the Natural World: *The
Windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the Earth do
shake. The Earth is utterly broken down, the Earth is clean dissolv’d,
the Earth is moved exceedingly. The Earth shall reel to and fro like a
drunkard, and shall be removed like a Cottage, and the transgression
thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall and not rise again*.

To restrain all these things to *Judea*, as their adequate and final
object, is to force both the words and the sence. Here are manifest
allusions and foot-steps of the destruction of the World, and the
dissolution of the Earth; partly as it was in the Deluge, and partly as
it will be in its last ruine; torn, broken, and shatter’d. But most Men
have fallen into that errour, To fancy both the destructions of the
World, by water and by fire, quiet, noiseless things; executed without
any ruines or ruptures in Nature; That the Deluge was but a great Pool
of still waters, made by the rains and inundation of the Sea: and the
Conflagration will be onely a superficial scorching of the Earth, with a
running fire. These are false Idea's, and unsuitable to Scripture: for
as the Deluge is there represented a

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Disruption of the Abyss, and consequently of the
then habitable Earth; so the future combustion of it, according to the
representations of Scripture, is to be usher’d in and accompanied with
all sort of violent impressions upon Nature; and the chief instrument of
these violences will be Earthquakes. These will tear the Body of the
Earth, and shake its foundations; rend the Rocks, and pull down the tall
Mountains; sometimes overturn, and sometimes swallow up Towns and
Cities; disturb and disorder the Elements, and make a general confusion
in Nature.

Next to Earthquakes, we may consider the *roarings of a troubled Sea*.
This is another sign of a dying World. St. *Luke*<span
class="margnote">*ch*. 21. 25, 26, 27</span> hath set down a great many
of them together; Let us hear his words: *And there shall be signs in
the Sun, and in the Moon, and in the Stars; and upon the Earth, distress
of Nations, with perplexity, The Sea and the Waves roaring. Mens hearts
failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are
coming on the Earth: for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken. And then
shall they see the Son of Man coming in a cloud, with power and great
glory*, *&c*. As some would allegorize these Signs, which we noted
before; so others would confine them to the destruction of Jerusalem.
<span class="margnote">*Ver*. 28.  
*Mat*. 24. 31.</span>But ’tis plain, by this coming of the Son of man in
the clouds, and the *redemption of the faithful*, and at the same time,
the *sound of the last trumpet*, which all relate to the end of the
World, that something further is intended than the destruction of
*Jerusalem*. And though there were Prodigies at the destruction of that
City and State, yet not of this force, nor with these circumstances.
’Tis true, those partial destructions and calamities, as we observ’d
before, of *Babylon*, *Jerusalem*, and the *Roman* Empire, being types
of an universal and final destruction of all God's Enemies, have, in the
pictures of them, some of the same strokes, to show they are all from
the same hand; decreed by the same wisdom, foretold by the same Spirit;
and the same power and providence that have already wrought the one,
will also work the other, in due time, the former being still pledges;
as well as prefigurations, of the latter.

Let us then proceed in our explication of this sign, *The roaring of the
Sea, and the Waves*, applying it to the end of the World. I do not look
upon this ominous noise of the Sea, as the effect of a tempest, for then
it would not strike such a terrour into the Inhabitants of the Earth,
nor make them apprehensive of some great evil coming upon the World, as
this will do; what proceeds from visible causes, and such as may happen
in a common course of Nature, does not so much amaze us, nor affright
us. Therefore ’tis more likely these disturbances of the Sea proceed
from below; partly by sympathy and revulsions from the Land; by
Earthquakes there, and exhausting. the subterraneous cavities of waters,
which will draw again from the Seas what supplies they can: And partly
by Earthquakes in the very Sea it self; with exhalations and fiery
Eruptions from the bottom of it. Things indeed that happen at other
times, more or less, but at this conjuncture, all causes conspiring,
they will break out with more violence, and put the whole Body of the
Waters into a tumultuary motion. I do not see any occasion, at this
time, for high Winds; neither can think a superficial agitation of the
Waves would answer this Phænomenon; but ’tis rather from

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Contorsions in the bowels of the Ocean, which
make it roar, as it were, for pain. Some Causes impelling the Waters one
way, and some another, make intestine struglings and contrary motions;
from whence proceed unusual noises, and such a troubled state of the
Waters, as does not only make the Sea innavigable, but also strikes
terror into all the Maritime inhabitants, that live within the view or
sound of it.

So much for the Earth and the Sea. The face of the Heavens also will be
chang’d in divers respects. The Sun and the Moon darkned, or of a
bloudy, or pale countenance; The Celestial Powers shaken, and the Stars
unsetled in their Orbs. As to the Sun and Moon, their obscuration or
change of colour is no more than what happens commonly before the
Eruption of a fiery Mountain; *Dion Cassius*, you see, hath taken notice
of it in that Eruption of *Ætna* which he describes; and others upon the
like occasions in *Vesuvius*. And ’tis a thing of easie explication; for
according as the Atmosphere is more or less clear or turbid, the
Luminaries are more or less conspicuous; and according to the nature of
those fumes or exhalations that swim in the Air, the face of the Sun is
discolour’d, sometimes one way, sometimes another. You see, in an
ordinary Experiment, when we look upon one another through the fumes of
Sulphur, we appear pale like so many Ghosts; and in some foggy days the
Sun hangs in the Firmament as a lump of Bloud. And both the Sun and Moon
at their rising, when their light comes to us through the thick vapours
of the Earth, are red and fiery. These are not changes wrought in the
substance of the Luminaries, but in the modifications of their light as
it flows to us. For colours are but Light in a sort of disguise; as it
passes through *Mediums* of different qualities, it takes different
forms; but the matter is still the same, and returns to its simplicity
when it comes again into a pure air.

Now the air may be changed and corrupted to a great degree, tho’ there
appear no visible change to our eye. This is manifest from infectious
airs, and the changes of the air before storms and rains; which we feel
commonly sooner than we see, and some other creatures perceive much
sooner than we do. ’Tis no wonder then if before this mighty storm the
dispositions of the Air be quite alter’d; especially if we consider,
what we have so often noted before, that there will be a great abundance
of fumes and exhalations through the whole Atmosphere of the Earth,
before the last Fire breaks out; whereby the Light of the Sun may be
tinctur’d in several ways. And lastly, it may be so order’d
providentially, that the Body of the Sun may contract at that time some
Spots or *Maculæ* far greater than usual, and by that means be really
darkened; not to us only, but to all the neighbouring Planets. And this
will have a proportionable effect upon the Moon too, for the diminution
of her light. So that upon all suppositions these Phænomena are very
intelligible, if not necessary forerunners of the Conflagration.

The next Sign given us, is, that the *powers of heaven will be shaken*.
By the *Heavens* in this place is either understood the Planetary
Heavens, or that of the *Fix’d Stars*; but this latter being infinitely
distant from the Earth, cannot be really affected by the Conflagration.
Nor the powers of it, that is, its motions or the Bodies contain’d in
it, any way shaken or disorder’d. But in appearance

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

these celestial Bodies may seem to be shaken and their motions
disorder’d; as in a tempest by night, when the ship is toss’d with
contrary and uncertain motions, the Heavens seem to fluctuate over our
heads, and the Stars to reel to and fro, when the motion is only in our
own Vessel. So possibly the uncertain motions of the Atmosphere, and
sometimes of the Earth it self, may so vary the sight and aspect of this
starry Canopy, that it may seem to shake and tremble.

But if we understand this of the *Planetary Heavens*, They may really be
shaken. Providence either ordering some great changes in the other
Planets previously to the Conflagration of our Planet; as ’tis probable
there was a great change in *Venus*, at the time of our *Deluge*. Or the
great shakings and concussions of our Globe at that time, affecting some
of the neighbouring Orbs, at least that of the Moon, may cause Anomalies
and irregularities in their motions. But the sence that I should pitch
upon chiefly for explaining this phrase of *shaking the powers of
heaven*, comprehends, in a good measure, both these Heavens, of the
Fix’d Stars and of the Planets; ’Tis that change of situation in the
Axis of the Earth, which we have formerly mention’d; whereby the Stars
will seem to change their places, and the whole Universe to take another
posture. This is sufficiently known to those that know the different
consequences of a strait or oblique posture of the Earth. And as the
heavens and the earth were, in this sence, once shaken before; namely at
the Deluge, when they lost their first situation; so now they will be
shaken again, and thereby return to the posture they had before that
first concussion. And this I take to be the true literal sence of the
Prophet *Haggai*, <span class="margnote">*ch*. 2. 6.*  
Hebr*. 12. 26.</span> repeated by St. *Paul*, *Yet once more I shake not
the Earth only, but also heaven*.

That last Sign we shall take notice of, is that of *Falling Stars*. *And
the Stars shall fall from Heaven*, says our Saviour, *Matt*. 24. 29. We
are sure, from the nature of the thing, that this cannot be understood
either of fix’d Stars or Planets; for if either of these should tumble
from the Skies, and reach the Earth, they would break it all in pieces,
or swallow it up, as the Sea does a sinking ship; and at the same time
would put all the inferiour universe into confusion. It is necessary
therefore by these Stars to understand either fiery Meteors falling from
the middle Region of the Air, or Comets and Blazing Stars. No doubt
there will be all sorts of fiery Meteors at that time; and amongst
others, those that are call’d *Falling Stars*; which, tho’ they are not
considerable singly, yet if they were multiplyed in great numbers,
falling, as the Prophet says,<span class="margnote">Isa. 34. 4.</span>
as *leafs from the Vine, or figs from the fig-tree*, they would make an
astonishing sight. But I think this expression does chiefly refer to
Comets; which are dead Stars, and may truly be said to fall from heaven,
when they leave their seats above, and those ethereal regions wherein
they were fixt, and sink into this lower World; where they wander about
with a blaze in their tail, or a flame about their heads, as if they
came on purpose to be the Messengers of some fiery Vengeance. If numbers
of these blazing Stars should fall into our heaven together, they would
make a dreadful and formidable appearance; And I am apt to think that
Providence hath so contriv’d the periods of their motion, that there
will be an unusual concourse of them at that time, within the view of
the Earth, to be a prelude to this last and most Tragical Scene of the
Sublunary World.

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

I do not know any more in Scripture relating to the last Fire, that,
upon the grounds laid down in this discourse, may not receive a
satisfactory explication. It reaches, beyond the Signs before mention’d,
to the highest expressions of Scripture, As *Lakes of fire and
brimstone, a molten Sea mingled with fire, the Liquefaction of
Mountains*, and of the Earth it self. We need not now look upon these
things as Hyperbolical and Poetical strains, but as barefac’d
Prophecies, and things that will literally come to pass as they are
predicted. One thing more will be expected in a just hypothesis or
Theory of the Conflagration, namely, that it should answer, not only all
the conditions and characters belonging to the last Fire, but should
also make way and lay the foundation of another World to succeed this,
or of *New Heavens* and a *New Earth*. For St. *Peter* hath taught this
doctrine of the *Renovation* of the World, as positively and expressly
as that of its Conflagration. And therefore they that so explain the
destruction of the present World, as to leave it afterwards in an
eternal rubbish, without any hopes of restoration, do not answer the
Christian doctrine concerning it. But as to our Hypothesis, we are
willing to stand this farther trial, and be accountable for the
consequences of the Conflagration, as well as the Antecedents and manner
of it. And we have accordingly in the following Book, from the Ashes of
this, rais’d a New Earth; which we leave to the enjoyment of the
Readers. In the mean time, to close our discourse, we will bid farewel
to the present World, in a short review of its last flames.
