### CHAPTER VII

The true bounds of the Last Fire, and how far it is fatal. The natural
Causes and Materials of it, cast into three ranks: First, such as are
exteriour and visible upon the Earth; where the Volcano's of the Earth,
and their effects, are consider’d. Secondly, such materials as are
within the Earth. Thirdly, such as are in the Air.

ik S we have, in the preceding Chapter, laid aside those Causes of the
Conflagration, which we thought too great and cumbersome; so now we
must, in like manner, examine the Effect, and reduce that to its just
measures and proportions; that there may be nothing left superfluous on
either side: Then, by comparing the real powers with the work they are
to do, both being stated within their due bounds, we may the better
judge how they are proportion’d to one another.

We noted before, that the Conflagration had nothing to do with the Stars
and superiour Heavens, but was wholly confin’d to this Sublunary World.
And this Deluge of Fire will have much what the same bounds, that the
Deluge of Water had formerly. This is according to St. *Peter*'s
doctrine<span class="margnote">2 *Pet*. 3. 5, 6. *Ver*. 7</span>, for he
makes the same parts of the Universe to be the subject of both: namely,
the inferiour Heavens and the Earth. *The Heavens and the Earth which
were then, perish’d in a Deluge of Water: But the Heavens and the Earth
that are now, are reserv’d to fire*. The present Heavens and Earth are
substituted in the place of those that perish’d at the Deluge, and these
are to be over-run and destroy’d by fire, as those were by water. So
that the Apostle takes the same Regions, and the same space and compass
for the one as for the other, and makes their fate different according
to their different constitution, and the different order of Providence.
This is the sence St. *Austin* gives us of the Apostle's words, and
these are the bounds he sets to the last Fire; whereof a modern
Commentator<span class="margnote">*Estius in loc*.</span> is so well
assur’d, that he says, *They neither understand Divinity, nor
Philosophy, that would make the Conflagration reach above the Elementary
Heavens*.

Let these be then its limits upwards, the Clouds, Air, and Atmosphere of
the Earth. But the question seems more doubtful, *How* far it will
extend downwards, into the bowels of the Earth. I answer still, to the
same depth that the Waters of the Deluge reach'd: To the lowest Abysses
and the deepest Caverns within the ground. And seeing no Caverns are
deeper or lower, at least according to our Theory, than the bottom of
the great Ocean, to that depth, I suppose, the rage of this fire will
penetrate, and devour all before it. And therefore we

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

must not imagine, that onely the outward turf and habitable surface of
the Earth will be put into a flame and laid wart; the whole exteriour
region of the Earth, to the depth of the deepest part of the Sea, will
suffer in this fire; and suffer to that degree, as to be melted down,
and the frame of it dissolv’d. For we are not to conceive that the Earth
will be onely scorcht or charkt in the last fire, there will be a sort
of liquefaction and dissolution; It will become a *molten Sea mingled
with fire*, according to the expression of Scripture.<span
class="margnote">*Rev*. 15. 2.  
2 *Pet*. 3. 10.  
*Psal*. 97. 5.</span> And this dissolution may reasonably be suppos’d to
reach as low as the Earth hath any hollownesses, or can give vent to
smoak and flame.

Wherefore taking these for the bounds and limits of the last great fire,
the next thing to be enquir’d into, are the *Natural Causes* of it. How
this strange fate will seize upon the Sublunary World, and with an
irresistible fury subdue all things to it self. But when I say *Natural
Causes*, I would not be so understood, as if I thought the Conflagration
was a pure *Natural Fatality*, as the *Stoicks* seem to do. No, ’tis a
*mixt Fatality*; The Causes indeed are natural, but the administration
of them is from an higher hand. Fire is the Instrument, or the executive
power, and hath no more force given it, than what it hath naturally; but
the concurrence of these causes, or of these fiery powers, at such a
time, and in such a manner, and the conduct of them to carry on and
compleat the whole work without cessation or interruption, that I look
upon as more than what material Nature could effect of it self, or than
could be brought to pass by such a government of matter, as is the bare
result of its own laws and determinations. When a Ship sails gently
before the wind, the Mariners may stand idle; but to guide her in a
storm, all hands must be at work. There are rules and measures to be
observ’d, even in these tumults and desolations of Nature, in destroying
a World, as well as in making one, and therefore in both it is
reasonable to suppose a more than ordinary Providence to superintend the
work. Let us not therefore be too positive or presumptuous in our
conjectures about these things, for if there be an invisible hand,
Divine or Angelical, that touches the Springs and Wheels; it will not be
easie for us to determine, with certainty, the order of their motions.
However, ’tis our duty to search into the ways and works of God, as far
as we can: And we may without offence look into the Magazines of Nature,
see what provisions are made, and what preparations for this great Day;
and in what method ’tis most likely the design will be executed.

But before we proceed to mark out Materials for this fire, give me leave
to observe one condition or property in the Form of this present Earth,
that makes it capable of inflammation. ’Tis the manner of its
construction, in an hollow cavernous form; By reason whereof, containing
much Air in its cavities, and having many inlets and outlets, ’tis in
most places capable of ventilation, pervious and passable to the winds,
and consequently to the fire. Those that have read the former part of
this Theory,<span class="margnote">Book I. ch. 6, 7.</span> know how the
Earth came into this hallow and broken form, from what causes and at
what time; namely, at the Universal Deluge; when there was a disruption
of the exteriour Earth that fell into the Abyss, and so, for a time, was
overflow’d with water. These Ruines recover’d from the water, we
inhabit, and these Ruines onely will be burnt up; For being

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

not onely unequal in their Surface, but also hollow, loose, and
incompact within, as ruines use to be, they are made thereby capable of
a second fate, by inflammation. *Thereby*, I say they are made
combustible; for if the exteriour Regions of this Earth were as close
and compact in all their parts, as we have reason to believe the
interiour Regions of it to be, the Fire could have little power over it,
nor ever reduce it to such a state as is requir’d in a compleat
Conflagration, such as ours is to be.

This being admitted, that the Exteriour region of the Earth stands
hollow, as a well set fire, to receive Air freely into its parts, and
hath issues for smoke and flame: It remains to enquire what fewel or
materials Nature hath fitted to kindle this Pile, and to continue it on
fire till it be consum’d; or, in plain words, What are the *natural
causes and preparatives for a Conflagration*. The first and most obvious
preparations that we see in nature for this effect, are the *Burning
Mountains* or Volcano's of the Earth. These are lesser Essays or
preludes to the general fire; set on purpose by Providence to keep us
awake, and to mind us continually, and forewarn us of what we are to
expect at last. The Earth you see is already kindled, blow but the Coal,
and propagate the fire, and the work will go on. <span
class="margnote">*Isa*. 30. 33.</span>*Tophet is prepar’d of old*, and
when the Day of Doom is come, and the Date of the World expir’d, *the
breath of the Lord* shall make it burn.

But besides these Burning Mountains, there are Lakes of pitch and
brimstone and oily Liquors disperst in several parts of the Earth. These
are to enrage the fire as it goes, and to fortifie it against any
resistance or opposition. Then all the vegetable productions upon the
Surface of the Earth, as Trees, shrubs, grass, corn, and such like;
Every thing that grows out of the ground, is fewel for the fire; And
tho’ they are now accommodated to our use and service, they will then
turn all against us; and with a mighty blaze, and rapid course, make a
devastation of the outward furniture of the Earth, whether natural or
artificial. But these things deserve some further consideration,
especially that strange Phænomenon of the *Volcano's* or *Burning
Mountains*, which we will now consider more particularly.

There is nothing certainly more terrible in all Nature than Fiery
Mountains, to those that live within the view or noise of them; but it
is not easie for us, who never see them nor heard them, to represent
them to our selves with such just and lively imaginations as shall
excite in us the same passions, and the same horrour as they would
excite, if present to our senses. The time of their eruption and of
their raging, is, of all others, the most dreadful; but, many times,
before their eruption, the symptomes of an approaching fit are very
frightful to the People. The Mountain begins to roar and bellow in its
hollow caverns; cries out, as it were, in pain to be deliver’d of some
burthen, too heavy to be born, and too big to be easily discharg’d. The
Earth shakes and trembles, in apprehension of the pangs and convulsions
that are coming upon her; And the Sun often hides his head, or appears
with a discolour’d face, pale, or dusky, or bloudy, as if all Nature was
to suffer in this Agony. After these forerunners or symptomes of an
eruption, the wide jaws of the Mountain open: And first, clouds of smoke
issue out, then flames of fire, and after that a mixture of all sorts of
burning matter;

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

red hot stones, lumps of metal, half-dissolv’d minerals, with coals and
fiery ashes. These fall in thick showres round about the Mountain, and
in all adjacent parts; and not onely so, but are carried, partly by the
force of the expulsion, and partly by the winds, when they are aloft in
the Air, into far distant Countries. As from *Italy* to
*Constantinople*, and cross the Mediterranean Sea into *Africk*; as the
best Historians, *Procopius*, *Ammianus Marcellinus*, and *Dion
Cassius*, have attested.

These Volcano's are planted in several regions of the Earth, and in both
Continents, This of ours, and the other of *America*. For by report of
those that have view’d that new-found World, there are many Mountains in
it that belch out Smoke and Fire; some constantly, and others by fits
and intervals. In our Continent Providence hath variously disperst them,
without any rule known to us; but they are generally in Islands, or near
the Sea. In the Asiatick Oriental Islands they are in great abundance,
and Historians tell us of a Mountain in the Island *Java*, that in the
year, 1586 at one eruption kill’d ten thousand people in the
neighbouring Cities and Countrey. But we do not know so well the History
of those remote Volcano's, as of such as are in Europe and nearer home.
In *Iseland*, tho’ it lye within the Polar circle, and is scarce
habitable by reason of the extremity of cold, and abundance of Ice and
Snow, yet there are three burning Mountains in that Island; whereof the
chief and most remarkable is *Hecla*. This hath its head always cover’d
with Snow, and its belly always fill’d with Fire; and these are both so
strong in their kind, and equally powerful, that they cannot destroy one
another. It is said to cast out, when it rages, besides earth, stones
and ashes, a sort of flaming water. As if all contrarieties were to meet
in this Mountain to make it the more perfect resemblance of Hell, as the
credulous inhabitants fancy it to be.

But there are no Volcano's in my opinion, that deserve our observation
so much, as those that are in and about the *Mediterranean Sea*; There
is a knot of them called the *Vulcanian Islands*, from their fiery
eruptions, as if they were the Forges of *Vulcan*; as *Stombolo*,
*Lipara*, and others, which are not so remarkable now as they have been
formerly. However, without dispute, there are none in the Christian
World to be compared with *Ætna* and *Vesuvius*; one in the Island of
*Sicily*, and the other in *Campania*, overlooking the Port and City of
*Naples*. These two, from all memory of man and the most ancient records
of History, have been fam’d for their Treasures of subterraneous Fires:
which are not yet exhausted, nor diminish’d, so far as is perceivable;
for they rage still, upon occasions, with as much fierceness and
violence, as they ever did in former Ages; as if they had a continual
supply to answer their expences, and were to stand till the last fire,
as a type and prefiguration of it, throughout all generations.

Let us therefore take these two Volcano's as a pattern for the rest;
seeing they are well known, and stand in the heart of the Christian
World, where, ’tis likely the last fire will make its first assault.
*Ætna*, of the two, is more spoken of by the ancients, both Poets and
Historians; and we should scarce give credit to their relations
concerning it, if some later eruptions did not equal or exceed the fame
of all that hath been reported from former ages. That it heated the
waters of

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

the Sea, and cover’d them over with ashes; crack’d or dissolv’d the
neighbouring Rocks; darkened the Sun and the Air; and cast out, not only
mighty streams of flame, but a floud of melted Ore and other materials;
These things we can now believe, having had experience of greater, or an
account of them from such as have been eyewitnesses of these fires, or
of the fresh ruines and sad effects of them.

There are two things especially, in these Eruptions of *Ætna*, that are
most prodigious in themselves and most remarkable for our purpose. The
Rivers of fiery matter that break out of its bowels, or are spew’d out
of its mouth; and the vast burning stones which it flings into the Air,
at a strange height and distance. As to these fiery rivers or torrents,
and the matter whereof they are compounded, we have a full account of
them by *Alphonsus Borellus*, a learned Mathematician at Pisa; who,
after the last great Eruption in the year 1669 went into *Sicily*, while
the fact was fresh, to view and survey what *Ætna* had done or suffer’d.
And he says the quantity of matter thrown out of the Mountain at that
time, upon survey amounted to Ninety three millions, eight hundred
thirty eight thousand, seven hundred and fifty cubical paces. So that if
it had been extended in length upon the surface of the Earth, at the
bredth and depth of 3 foot, it would have reacht further than ninety
three millions of paces; which is more than four times the Circuit of
the whole Earth, taking a thousand paces to a mile. This is strange to
our imagination and almost incredible, that one Mountain should throw
out so much fiery matter, besides all the ashes that were disperst
through the Air, far and near, and could be brought to no account.

’Tis true, all this matter was not actually inflam’d or liquid fire. But
the rest that was sand, stone and gravel, might have run into glass or
some melted liquor like to it, if it had not been thrown out before the
heat fully reacht it. However, sixty million paces of this matter, as
the same Author computes, were liquid fire, or came out of the mouth of
the pit in that form. This made a River of fire, sometimes two miles
broad, according to his computation; but according to the observation of
others who also viewed it, the Torrent of fire was six or seven miles
broad, and sometimes ten or fifteen fathoms deep; and forc’d its way
into the Sea near a mile, preƒerving it self alive in the midst of the
waters.

This is beyond all the infernal Lakes and Rivers, *Acheron*,
*Phlegeton*, *Cocytus*, all that the Poets have talkt of. Their greatest
fictions about Hell have not come up to the reality of one of our
burning Mountains upon Earth. Imagin then all our *Volcano*'s rageing at
once in this manner.--But I will not pursue that supposition yet; Give
me leave only to add here what I mentioned in the second place, The vast
*Burning Stones* which this Mountain, in the time of its rage and
estuation, threw into the Air with an incredible force. This same Author
tells us of a stone fifteen foot long, that was flung out of the mouth
of the pit, to a miles distance. And when it fell, it came from such an
height and with such a violence, that it buried it self in the ground
eight foot deep. What trifles are our Mortar-pieces and Bombes, when
compar’d with these Engines of Nature? When she flings out of the wide
throat of a Volcano, a broken Rock, and twirles it in the air like a
little bullet; then lets it fall to do execution here below, as
Providence shall point and direct it. It would be hard to give an
account how

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

so great an impulse can be given to a Body so ponderous, But there's no
disputing against matter of fact; and as the thoughts of God are not
like our thoughts, so neither are his works like our works.

Thus much for *Ætna*. Let us now give an instance in Vesuvius, another
*Burning Mountain* upon the coast of the Mediterranean, which hath as
frequent Eruptions, and some as terrible as those of *Ætna*. *Dion
Cassius*<span class="margnote">*lib*. 66.</span> (one of the best
writers of the *Roman* History) hath given us an account of one that
happened in the time of *Titus Vespatian*; and tho’ he hath not set down
particulars, as the former Author did, of the quantity of fiery matter
thrown out at that time: yet supposing that proportionable to its
fierceness in other respects, this seems to me as dreadful an Eruption
as any we read of; and was accompanied with such prodigies and
commotions in the Heavens and the Earth, as made it look like the
beginning of the last Conflagration. As a prelude to this Tragedy, He
says there were strange sights in the air, and after that followed an
extraordinary drought, *Then the Earth began to tremble and quake, and
the Concussions were so great that the ground seem’d to rise and boyl up
in some places, and in others the tops of the mountains sunk in or
tumbled down. At the same time were great noises and sounds heard, some
were subterraneous, like thunder within the Earth; others above ground,
like groans or bellowings.* The Sea roar’d*, The heavens ratled with a
fearful noise, and then came a sudden and mighty crack, as if the frame
of Nature had broke, or all the mountains of the Earth had faln down at
once. At length* Vesuvius *burst, and threw out of its womb, first, huge
stones, then a vast quantity of fire and smoke, so as the air was all
darkned, and the Sun was hid, as if he had been under a great Eclipse.
The day was turn’d into night, and light into darkness; and the frighted
people thought the Gyants were making war against heaven, and fansied
they see the shapes and images of Gyants in the smoak, and heard the
sound of their trumpets. Others thought the World was returning to its
first Chaos, or going to be all consum’d with fire. In this general
confusion and consternation they knew not where to be safe, some run out
of the fields into the houses, others out of the houses into the fields;
Those that were at Sea hasten’d to Land, and those that were at Land
endeavour’d to get to Sea; still thinking every place safer than that
where they were. Besides grosser lumps of matter, there was thrown out
of the Mountain such a prodigious quantity of ashes, as cover’d the Land
and Sea, and fill’d the Air, so as, besides other damages, the Birds,
Beasts, and Fishes, with Men, Women and Children, were destroy’d, within
such a compass; and two entire Cities,* Herculanium *and* Pompeios*,
were overwhelm’d with a showre of ashes, as the People were sitting in
the Theater. Nay, these ashes were carried by the winds over the
Mediterranean into Africk, and into Ægypt and Syria. And at* Rome *they
choak’d the Air on a sudden, so as to hide the face of the Sun.
Whereupon the People, not knowing the cause, as not having yet got the
News from Campania of the Eruption of Vesuvius, could not imagine what
the reason should be; but thought the Heavens and the Earth were coming
together, The Sun coming down, and the Earth going to take its place
above*. Thus far the Historian.

You see what disorders in nature, and what an alarum, the Eruption of
one fiery Mountain is capable to make; These things, no doubt, would
have made strong impressions upon us, if we had been eye-witnesses of
them; But I know,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

representations made from dead history, and at a distance, though the
testimony be never so credible, have a much less effect upon us than
what we see our selves, and what our senses immediately inform us of. I
have onely given you an account of two Volcano's, and of a single
Eruption in either of them; These Mountains are not very far distant
from one another: Let us suppose two such Eruptions, as I have
mention’d, to happen at the same time, and both these Mountains to be
raging at once, in this manner; By that violence you have seen in each
of them singly, you will easily imagine what a terrour and desolation
they would carry round about, by a conjunction of their fury and all
their effects, in the Air and on the Earth. Then, if to these two, you
should joyn two more, the Sphere of their activity would still be
enlarg’d, and the Scenes become more dreadful. But, to compleat the
supposition, Let us imagine all the Volcano's of the whole Earth, to be
prepar’d and set to a certain time; which time being come, and a signal
given by Providence, all these Mines begin to play at once; I mean, All
these Fiery Mountains burst out, and discharge themselves in flames of
fire, tear up the roots of the Earth, throw hot burning stones, send out
streams of flowing Metals and Minerals, and all other sorts of ardent
matter, which Nature hath lodg’d in those Treasuries. If all these
Engines, I say, were to play at once, the Heavens and the Earth would
seem to be in a flame, and the World in an universal combustion. But we
may reasonably presume, that against that great Day of vengeance and
execution, not onely all these will be employ’d, but also new Volcano's
will be open’d, and new Mountains in every Region will break out into
smoke and flame; just as at the Deluge, the Abyss broke out from the
Womb of the Earth, and from those hidden stores sent an immense quantity
of water, which, it may be, the Inhabitants of that World never thought
of before. So we must expect new Eruptions, and also new sulphureous
Lakes and Fountains of Oyl, to boyl out of the ground; And these all
united with that Fewel that naturally grows upon the Surface of the
Earth, will be sufficient to give the first onset, and to lay vast all
the habitable World, and the Furniture of it.

But we suppose the Conflagration will go lower, pierce under-ground, and
dissolve the substance of the Earth to some considerable depth;
therefore besides these outward and visible preparations, we must
consider all the hidden invisible Materials within the Veins of the
Earth; Such are all Minerals or Mineral juices and concretions that are
igniferous, or capable of inflammation; And these cannot easily be
reckon’d up or estimated. Some of the most common are, Sulphur, and all
sulphureous bodies, and Earths impregnated with Sulphur, Bitumen and
bituminous concretions; inflammable Salts, Coal and other fossiles that
are ardent, with innumerable mixtures and compositions of these kinds,
which being open’d by heat, are unctuous and inflammable; or by
attrition discover the latent seeds of fire. But besides consistent
Bodies, there is also much volatile fire within the Earth, in fumes,
steams, and exudations, which will all contribute to this effect. From
these stores under-ground all Plants and Vegetables are fed and
supply’d, as to their oily and sulphureous parts; And all hot Waters in
Baths or Fountains, must have their original from some of these, some
mixture or participation of them. And as to the *Brittish* Soyl, there
is so much Coal incorporated

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

with it, that when the Earth shall burn, we have reason to apprehend no
small danger from that subterraneous Enemy.

These dispositions, and this Fewel we find, in and upon the Earth,
towards the last Fire. The third sort of Provision is in the Air; All
fiery Meteors and Exhalations engender’d and form’d in those Regions
above, and discharg’d upon the Earth in several ways. I believe there
were no fiery Meteors in the antediluvian Heavens; which therefore St.
*Peter* says, *were constituted of water*; had nothing in them but what
was watery. But he says, *the Heavens that are now* have treasures of
fire, or are reserv’d for fire, as things laid up in a store-house for
that purpose. We have thunder and lightning, and fiery tempests, and
there is nothing more vehement, impetuous, and irresistible, where their
force is directed. It seems to me very remarkable, that the Holy Writers
describe the *coming of the Lord*, and the destruction of the wicked, in
the nature of a tempest, or a storm of fire. <span
class="margnote">*Psal*. 11. 6.</span>*Upon the wicked the Lord shall
rain coals, fire and brimstone, and a burning tempest, this shall be the
portion of their cup*. And in the lofty Song of *David* (*Psal*. 18.)
which, in my judgment, respects both the past Deluge and the future
Conflagration, ’tis said,<span class="margnote">*ver*. 13, 14,
15.</span> *The Lord also thundred in the heavens, and the Highest gave
his voice, hail-stones and coals of fire. Yea, he sent forth his arrows
and scattered them, and he shot out lightnings and discomfited them.
Then the Chanels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the World
were discover’d; at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of
thy nostrils*. And a like fiery coming is describ’d in the ninety
seventh Psalm, as also by *Isaiah*, *Daniel*, and St. *Paul*.<span
class="margnote">*Isa*. 66. 15.  
*Dan*. 7. 9, 10.  
2 *Thess*. 1. 8.</span> And lastly, in the *Apocalypse*, when the World
draws to a conclusion, as in the seventh Trumpet (ch. II. 19.) and the
seventh Vial (ch. 16. 18.) we have still mention made of this Fiery
Tempest of Lightnings and Thunderings.

We may therefore reasonably suppose, that, before the Conflagration, the
air will be surcharg’d every where, (by a precedent drought) with hot
and fiery exhalations; And as against the Deluge, those regions were
burthened with water and moist vapours, which were pour’d upon the
Earth, not in gentle showres, but like rivers and cataracts from Heaven;
so they will now be fill’d with hot fumes and sulphureous clouds, which
will sometimes flow in streams and fiery impressions through the Air,
sometimes make Thunder and Lightnings, and sometimes fall down upon the
Earth in flouds of Fire. In general, there is a great analogy to be
observed betwixt the two Deluges, of Water and of Fire; not only as to
the bounds of them, which were noted before; but as to the general
causes and sources upon which they depend, from above and from below. At
the Floud, the windows of Heaven were opened above, and the Abyss was
opened below; and the Waters of these two joyn’d together to overflow
the World. In like manner, at the Conflagration, God will rain down Fire
from Heaven, as he did once upon *Sodom*; and at the same time the
subterraneous store-houses of Fire will be broken open, which answers to
the disruption of the Abyss: And these two meeting and mingling
together, will involve all the Heaven and Earth in flames.

This is a short account of the ordinary stores of Nature, and the
ordinary preparations for a general Fire; And in contemplation of these,
Pliny the Naturalist,

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

said boldly. *It was one of the greatest wonders of the World, that the
World was not every day set on fire*. We will conclude this Chapter with
his words, in the second Book of his *Natural History*<span
class="margnote">*ch*. 106, 107.</span>; having given an account of some
fiery Mountains, and other parts of the Earth that are the seats and
sources of Fire, He makes this reflection; *Seeing this Element is so
fruitful that it brings forth it self, and multiplies and encreases from
the least sparks, what are we to expect from so many fires already
kindled on the Earth? How does nature feed and satisfie so devouring an
Element, and such a great voracity throughout all the World, without
loss or diminution of her self? Add to these fires we have mentioned,
the Stars and the Great Sun, then all the fires made for humane uses;
fire in stones, in wood, in the clouds and in thunder; IT EXCEEDS ALL
MIRACLES, IN MY OPINION, THAT ONE DAY SHOULD PASS WITHOUT SETTING THE
WORLD ALL ON FIRE*.
