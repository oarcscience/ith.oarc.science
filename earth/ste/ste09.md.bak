### CHAPTER VI

*The dissolution of the First Earth: The Deluge ensuing thereupon. And
the form of the present Earth rising from the Ruines of the First*.

<span class="margnote">Vid. Fig. 5, & 6. pag. 59, & 62.</span>WE have
now brought to light the Ante-diluvian Earth out of the dark mass of the
Chaos; and not only described the surface of it, but laid open the
inward parts, to shew in what order its Regions lay. Let us now close it
up, and represent the Earth entire, and in larger proportions, more like
an habitable World; as in this Figure, where you see the smooth convex
of the Earth, and may imagine the great Abysse spread under it <span
id="fr_4"></span>[2](#fn_4.md); which two are to be the only subject of our
further contemplation.

In this smooth Earth were the first Scenes of the World, and the first
Generations of Mankind; it had the beauty of Youth and blooming Nature,
fresh and fruitful, and not a wrinkle, scar or fracture in all its body;
no Rocks nor Mountains, no hollow Caves, nor gaping Chanels, but even
and uniform all over. And the smoothness of the Earth made the face of
the Heavens so too; the Air was calm and serene; none of those
tumultuary motions and conflicts of vapours, which the Mountains and the
Winds cause in ours: ’Twas suited to a golden Age, and to the first
innocency of Nature.

All this you'll say is well, we are got into a pleasant World indeed,
but what's this to the purpose? what appearance of a Deluge here, where
there is not so much as a Sea, nor half so much water as we have in this
Earth? or what appearance of Mountains, or Caverns, or other
irregularities of the Earth, where all is level and united? So that
instead of loosing the Knot, this ties it the harder. You pretend to
shew us how the Deluge was made, and you lock up all the Waters within
the womb of the Earth, and set Bars and Doors, and a Wall of
impenetrable strength and thickness to keep them there. And you pretend
to shew us the original of Rocks and Mountains, and Caverns of the
Earth, and bring us to a wide and endless plain, smooth as the calm Sea.

This is all true, and yet we are not so far from the sight and discovery
of those things as you imagine; draw but the curtain and these Scenes
will appear, or something very like them. We must remember that St.
*Peter* told us, that the Ante-diluvian Earth perish’d, or was
demolish’d; and *Moses* saith, the *great Abysse*

<span id="page_65">p. 65</span>

<span id="img_06500"></span>

[![](tn/06500.jpg)

was broken open at the Deluge. Let us then suppose, that at a time
appointed by Divine Providence, and from Causes made ready to do that
great execution upon a sinful World, that this *Abysse* was open’d, or
that the frame of the Earth broke and fell down into the *Great Abysse*.
At this one stroke all Nature would be chang’d, and this single action
would have two great and visible Effects. The one Transient, and the
other permanent. First an universal Deluge would overflow all the parts
and Regions of the broken Earth, during the great commotion and
agitation of the Abysse, by the violent fall of the Earth into it. This
would be the first and unquestionable effect of this dissolution, and
all that World would be destroyed. Then when the agitation of the Abysse
was asswag’d, and the Waters by degrees were retied into their Chanels,
and the dry land appear'd,

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

you would see the true image of the present Earth in the ruines of the
first. The surface of the Globe would be divided into Land and Sea; the
Land would consist of Plains and Valleys and Mountains, according as the
pieces of this ruine were plac’d and dispos'd: Upon the banks of the Sea
would stand the Rocks, and near the shoar would be Islands, or lesser
fragments of Earth compass’d round by Water. Then as to Subterraneous
Waters, and all Subterraneous Caverns and hollownesses, upon this
supposition those things could not be otherwise; for the parts would
fall hollow in many places in this, as in all other ruines: And seeing
the Earth fell into this Abysse, the Waters at a certain height would
flow into all those hollow places and cavities; and would also sink and
insinuate into many parts of the solid Earth. And though these
Subterraneous Vaults or holes, whether dry or full of Water, would be
more or less in all places, where the parts fell hollow; yet they would
be found especially about the roots of the Mountains, and the higher
parts of the Earth; for there the sides bearing up one against the
other, they could not lie so close at the bottoms, but many vacuities
would be intercepted. Nor are there any other inequalities or
irregularities observable in the present form of the Earth; whether in
the surface of it, or interiour construction, whereof this *hypothesis*
doth not give a ready, fair, and intelligible account; and doth at one
view represent them all to us, with their causes, as in a glass: And
whether that Glass be true, and the Image answer to the Original, if you
doubt of it, we will hereafter examine them piece by piece. But in the
first place, we must consider the General Deluge, how easily and truly
this supposition represents and explains it, and answers all the
properties and conditions of it.

I think it will be easily allow’d, that such a dissolution of the Earth
as we have propos’d, and fall of it into the Abysse, would certainly
make an universal Deluge; and effectually destroy the old World, which
perish’d in it. But we have not yet particularly prov’d this
dissolution, and in what manner the Deluge follow’d upon it: And to
assert things in gross never makes that firm impression upon our
understandings, and upon our belief, as to see them deduc’d with their
causes and circumstances; And therefore we must endeavour to shew what
preparations there were in Nature for this great dissolution, and after
what manner it came to pass, and the Deluge in consequence of it.

We have noted before, that *Moses* imputed the Deluge to the disruption
of the Abysse; and St. *Peter*, to the particular constitution of that
Earth, which made it obnoxious to be absorpt in Water, so as our
explication so far is justifi’d. But it was below the dignity of those
Sacred Pen-men, or the Spirit of God that directed them, to shew us the
causes of this disruption, or of this absorption; this is left to the
enquiries of men. For it was never the design of Providence, to give
such particular explications of Natural things, that should make us
idle, or the use of Reason unnecessary; but on the contrary, by
delivering great conclusions to us, to excite our curiosity and
inquisitiveness after the methods, by which such things were brought to
pass: And it may be there is no greater trial or instance of Natural
wisdom, than to find out the Chanel, in which these great revolutions of
Nature, which we treat on, flow and succeed one another.

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

Let us therefore resume that System of the Ante-diluvian Earth, which we
have deduc’d from the Chaos, and which we find to answer St. *Peter*'s
description, and *Moses* his account of the Deluge. This Earth could not
be obnoxious to a Deluge, as the Apostle supposeth it to have been, but
by a dissolution; for the Abysse was enclos’d within its bowels. And
Moses doth in effect tell us, there was such a dissolution, when he
saith, *The fountains of the great Abysse were broken open*. For
fountains are broken open no otherwise than by breaking up the ground
that covers them: We must therefore here enquire in what order, and from
what causes the frame of this exteriour Earth was dissolv’d, and then we
shall soon see how, upon that dissolution, the Deluge immediately
prevail’d and overflow’d all the parts of it.

I do not think it in the power of humane wit to determine how long this
frame would stand, how many Years, or how many Ages; but one would soon
imagine, that this kind of structure would not be perpetual, nor last
indeed many thousands of Years, if one consider the effect that the heat
of the Sun would have upon it, and the Waters under it; drying and
parching the one, and rarifying the other into vapours. For we must
consider, that the course of the Sun at that time, or the posture of the
Earth to the Sun, was such, that there was no diversity or alternation
of seasons in the Year, as there is now; by reason of which alternation,
our Earth is kept in an equality of temper, the contrary seasons
balancing one another; so as what moisture the heat of the Summer sucks
out of the Earth, ’tis repaid in the Rains of the next Winter; and what
chaps were made in it, are fill’d up again, and the Earth reduc’d to its
former constitution. But if we should imagine a continual Summer, the
Earth would proceed in driness still more and more, and the cracks would
be wider and pierce deeper into the substance of it: And such a
continual Summer there was, at least an equality of seasons in the
Ante-diluvian Earth, as shall be prov’d in the following Book,
concerning *Paradise*. In the mean time this being suppos’d, let us
consider what effect it would have upon this Arch of the exteriour
Earth, and the Waters under it.

We cannot believe, but that the heat of the Sun, within the space of
some hundreds of years, would have reduc’d this Earth to a considerable
degree of driness in certain parts; and also have much rarifi’d and
exhal’d the Waters under it: And considering the structure of that
Globe, the exteriour crust, and the Waters lying round under it, both
expos’d to the Sun, we may fitly compare it to an *Æolipile*, or an
hollow Sphere with Water in it, which the heat of the Fire rarifies and
turns into Vapours and Wind. The Sun here is as the Fire, and the
exteriour Earth is as the Shell of the *Æolipile*, and the Abysse as the
Water within it; now when the heat of the Sun had pierced through the
Shell and reacht the Waters, it began to rarifie them, and raise them
into Vapours; which rare-faction made them require more space and room
than they needed before, while they lay close and quiet. And finding
themselves pen’d in by the exteriour Earth, they press’d with violence
against that Arch, to make it yield and give way to their dilatation and
eruption. So we see all Vapours and Exhalations enclos’d within the
Earth, and agitated there, strive to break out, and often shake the
ground with their attempts to get loose. And in the comparison we us’d
of an

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

\[paragraph continues\] *æolipile*, if the mouth of it be stopt that
gives the vent, the Water rarifi’d will burst the Vessel with its force.
And the resemblance of the Earth to an Egg, which we us’d before, holds
also in this respect; for when it heats before the Fire, the moisture
and Air within being rarifi’d, makes it often burst the Shell. And I do
the more willingly mention this last comparison, because I observe that
some of the Ancients, when they speak of the doctrine of the *Mundane
Egg*, say, that after a certain period of time it was broken.

But there is yet another thing to be consider’d in this case; for as the
heat of the Sun gave force to these Vapours more and more, and made them
more strong and violent; so on the other hand, it also weaken’d more and
more the Arch of the Earth, that was to resist them; sucking out the
moisture that was the cement of its parts, drying it immoderately, and
chapping it in sundry places. And there being no Winter then to close up
and unite its parts, and restore the Earth to its former strength and
compactness, it grew more and more dispos’d to a dissolution. And at
length, these preparations in Nature being made on either side, the
force of the Vapours increas’d, and the walls weaken’d, which should
have kept them in, when the appointed time was come, that All-wise
Providence had design’d for the punishment of a sinful World, the whole
fabrick brake, and the frame of the Earth was torn in pieces, as by an
Earthquake; and those great portions or fragments, into which it was
divided, fell down into the Abysse, some in one posture, and some in
another.

This is a short and general account how we may conceive the dissolution
of the first Earth, and an universal Deluge arising upon it. And this
manner of dissolution hath so many examples in Nature every Age, that we
need not insist farther upon the Explication of it. The generality of
Earthquakes arise from like causes, and often end in a like effect, a
partial Deluge, or Inundation of the place or Country where they happen;
and of these we have seen some instances even in our own times: But
whensoever it so happens, that the Vapours and Exhalations shut up in
the caverns of the Earth, by rarefaction or compression come to be
straitned, they strive every way to set themselves at liberty, and often
break their prison, or the cover of the Earth that kept them in; which
Earth upon that disruption falls into the Subterraneous Caverns that lie
under it: And if it so happens that those Caverns are full of Water, as
generally they are, if they be great or deep, that City or tract of Land
is drown’d. And also the fall of such a mass of Earth, with its weight
and bulk, doth often force out the Water so impetuously, as to throw it
upon all the Country round about. There are innumerable examples in
History (whereof we shall mention some hereafter) of Cities and
Countries thus swallow’d up, or overflow’d, by an Earthquake, and an
Inundation arising upon it. And according to the manner of their fall or
ruine, they either remain’d wholly under water, and perpetually drown’d,
as *Sodom* and *Gomorrha*, *Plato*'s *Atlantis*, *Bura* and *Helice*,
and other Cities and Regions in Greece and Asia; or they partly emerg’d,
and became dry Land again; when (their situation being pretty high) the
Waters, after their violent agitation was abated, retied into the lower
places, and into their Chanels.

Now if we compare these partial dissolutions of the Earth with an
universal dissolution, we may as easily conceive an universal Deluge
from an universal

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Dissolution, as a partial Deluge from a partial
Dissolution. If we can conceive a City, a Country, an Island, a
Continent thus absorpt and overflown; if we do but enlarge our thought
and imagination a little, we may conceive it as well of the whole Earth.
And it seems strange to me, that none of the Ancients should hit upon
this way of explaining the universal Deluge; there being such frequent
instances in all Ages and Countries of Inundations made in this manner,
and never of any great Inundation made otherwise, unless in maritim
Countries, by the irruption of the Sea into grounds that lie low. ’Tis
true, they would not so easily imagine this Dissolution, because they
did not understand the true form of the Antediluvian Earth; but,
methinks, the examination of the Deluge should have led them to the
discovery of that: For observing the difficulty, or impossibility of an
universal Deluge, without the Dissolution of the Earth; as also frequent
instances of these Dissolutions accompani’d with Deluges, where the
ground was hollow, and had Subterraneous Waters; this, methinks, should
have prompted them to imagine, that those Subterraneous Waters were
universal at that time, or extended quite round the Earth; so as a
dissolution of the exteriour Earth could not be made any where, but it
would fall into Waters, and be more or less overflow’d. And when they
had once reacht this thought, they might conclude both what the form of
the Ante-diluvian Earth was, and that the Deluge came to pass by the
dissolution of it. But we reason with ease about the finding out of
things, when they are once found out; and there is but a thin paper-wall
sometimes between the great discoveries and a perfect ignorance of them.
Let us proceed now to consider, whether this supposition will answer all
the conditions of an universal Deluge, and supply all the defects which
we found in other Explications.

The great difficulty propos’d, was to find Water sufficient to make an
universal Deluge, reaching to the tops of the Mountains; and yet that
this Water should be transient, and after some time should so return
into its Chanels, that the dry Land would appear, and the Earth become
again habitable. There was that double impossibility in the common
opinion, that the quantity of water necessary for such a Deluge was no
where to be found, or could no way be brought upon the Earth; and then
if it was brought, could no way be remov’d again. Our explication quite
takes off the edge of this Objection; for, performing the same effect
with a far less quantity of Water, ’tis both easie to be found, and
easily remov’d when the work is done. When the exteriour Earth was
broke, and fell into the Abysse, a good part of it was cover’d with
water by the meer depth of the Abysse it fell into, and those parts of
it that were higher than the Abysse was deep, and consequently would
stand above it in a calm water, were notwithstanding reacht and
overtop’d by the waves, during the agitation and violent commotion of
the Abysse. For it is not imaginable what the commotion of the Abysse
would be upon this dissolution of the Earth, nor to what height its
waves would be thrown, when those prodigious fragments were tumbled down
into it. Suppose a stone of ten thousand weight taken up into the Air a
mile or two, and then let fall into the middle of the Ocean, I do not
believe but that the dashing of the water upon that impression, would
rise as high as a Mountain. But suppose a mighty Rock or heap of Rocks
to fall from that height, or a great Island, or a

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Continent; these would expel the waters out of
their places, with such a force and violence, as to fling them among the
highest Clouds.

’Tis incredible to what height sometimes great Stones and Cinders will
be thrown, at the eruptions of fiery Mountains; and the pressure of a
great mass of Earth falling into the Abysse, though it be a force of
another kind, could not but impel the water with so much strength, as
would carry it up to a great height in the Air; and to the top of any
thing that lay in its way, any eminency, or high fragment whatsoever:
And then rowling back again, it would sweep down with it whatsoever it
rusht upon, Woods, Buildings, living Creatures, and carry them all
headlong into the great gulf. Sometimes a mass of water would be quite
struck off and separate from the rest, and tost through the Air like a
flying River; but the common motion of the waves was to climb up the
hills, or inclin’d fragments, and then return into the valleys and deeps
again, with a perpetual fluctuation going and coming, ascending and
descending, till the violence of them being spent by degrees, they
setled at last in the places allotted for them; where *bounds are set
that they cannot pass over, that they return not again to cover the
Earth*. <span class="margnote">*Psal*. 104. 6, 7, 8, 9.</span>

Neither is it to be wonder’d, that the great Tumult of the waters, and
the extremity of the Deluge lasted for some months; for besides, that
the first shock and commotion of the Abysse was extremely violent, from
the general fall of the Earth, there were ever and anon some secondary
ruines; or some parts of the great ruine, that were not well setled,
broke again, and made new commotions: And ’twas a considerable time
before the great fragments that fell, and their lesser dependencies
could be so adjusted and fitted, as to rest in a firm and immoveable
posture: For the props and stays whereby they lean’d one upon another,
or upon the bottom of the Abysse, often fail’d, either by the incumbent
weight, or the violent impulses of the water against them; and so
renew’d, or continu’d the disorder and confusion of the Abysse. Besides,
we are to observe, that these great fragments falling hollow, they
inclos’d and bore down with them under their concave surface a great
deal of Air; and while the water compass’d these fragments, and
overflow’d them, the Air could not readily get out of those prisons, but
by degrees, as the Earth and Water above would give way; so as this
would also hinder the settlement of the Abysse, and the retiring of the
Water into those Subterraneous Chanels, for some time. But at length,
when this Air had found a vent, and left its place to the Water, and the
ruines, both primary and secondary, were setled and fixt, then the
Waters of the Abysse began to settle too, and the dry Land to appear;
first the tops of the Mountains, then the high Grounds, then the Plains
and the rest of the Earth. And this gradual subsidency of the Abysse
(which Moses also hath particularly noted) and discovery of the several
parts of the Earth, would also take up a considerable time.

Thus a new World appear’d, or the Earth put on its new form, and became
divided into Sea and Land; and the Abysse, which from several Ages, even
from the beginning of the World, had lain hid in the womb of the Earth,
was brought to light and discover’d; the greatest part of it
constituting our present Ocean, and the rest filling the lower cavities
of the Earth: Upon the Land appear’d the Mountains and the Hills, and
the Islands in the Sea, and the Rocks upon the

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

shore. And so the Divine Providence, having prepar’d Nature for so great
a change, at one stroke dissolv’d the frame of the old World, and made
us a new one out of its ruines, which we now inhabit since the Deluge.
All which things being thus explain’d, deduc’d, and stated, we now add
and pronounce our Third and last Proposition; *That the disruption of
the Abysse, or dissolution of the primæval Earth and its fall into the
Abysse, was the cause of the Universal Deluge, and of the destruction of
the old World*.
