Christian Topography, written in the 6th century C.E., is a classic flat
earth text. Cosmas believed that the Earth was rectangular and that the
sky was shaped like a horizontal half-cylinder resting on a box. It
looks a bit like an old pirate chest. Cosmas believed that it the
Tabernacle constructed by Moses was based on the form of the universe.
There is a huge mountain that the sun goes behind when it is night.
Cosmas uses scriptural arguments to justify his flat-earth cosmology.
The text also contains geographical information that Cosmas collected
during his far-ranging travels, which took him all the way to India.

This etext is derived from the version at the [Additional Early Church
Fathers at the Tertullian Project
website](https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/index), which I highly
recommend. I have converted all of the Greek text (which was encoded in
a special Greek font) to Unicode. (For information on viewing Unicode in
your browser, see [The Unicode File](../../unicode).
