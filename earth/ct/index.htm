<P><CITE>Christian Topography</CITE>, written in the 6th century C.E.,
is a classic flat earth text.
Cosmas believed that the Earth was rectangular and that the sky
was shaped like a horizontal half-cylinder resting on a box.
It looks a bit like an old pirate chest.
Cosmas believed that it the Tabernacle constructed by Moses was
based on the form of the universe.
There is a huge mountain that the sun goes behind when it is night.
Cosmas uses scriptural arguments to justify his flat-earth cosmology.
The text also contains geographical information that
Cosmas collected during his far-ranging travels,
which took him all the way to India.

This etext is derived from the version at the

I have converted all of the Greek text (which was encoded 
in a special Greek font) to Unicode.
