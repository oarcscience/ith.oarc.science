**Cosmas Indicopleustes, Christian Topography (1897) Introduction.**

### INTRODUCTION.

----------------

#### SOURCES OF THE TEXT.

<span id="img_cosmas0-1-2"></span> ![](img/cosmas0-1-2.jpg) H E
*Christian Topography* of Cosmas, surnamed Indicopleustes, or the Indian
Navigator, has been preserved in two copies: one a parchment MS. of the
tenth century belonging to the Laurentian library in Florence, and
containing the whole work except only the last leaf; the other, a very
fine uncial MS. of the eighth or ninth century, belonging to the Vatican
library, and containing sketches drawn by Costnas himself, but wanting
entirely the twelfth book, which is the last. There is, besides, in the
Imperial library in Vienna, a Cosmas MS., but this contains only a few
leaves of the *Topography.*

The existence of the work, which had been for ages forgotten, and the
importance and interest of its contents, were first made known in the
latter half of the seventeenth century by Emeric Bigot. This learned
French scholar, while visiting Italy, extracted from the Florentine
Codex a copy of the <span id="pii">\|ii</span> Adulitic
Inscriptions,[<sup>1</sup>](#1.md) and of passages relating to Ethiopia and
India. These extracts were afterwards published in Thevenot's *Relation
de divers Voyages,* accompanied with a translation into French. Twenty
years later (1706), the work appeared in its complete form as exhibited
in the Florentine Codex, collated with that of the Vatican. It was not,
however, published separately, but was included in the second volume of
the splendid work *Nova Collectio Patrum et Scriptorum Graecorum,*
edited by Father Montfaucon, a Benedictine monk, celebrated for his
profound knowledge of Patristic literature. The Greek text was
illustrated by a learned introduction and a Latin translation of great
elegance and accuracy. Notes were also added, chiefly to point out where
discrepancies exist in the readings of the MSS. The present translation
has been prepared from Montfaucon's text, as reprinted in the 88th
volume of the *Patrologia Graeca,* printed at the Migne Press, Paris,
1864.

#### THE TITLE OF THE WORK. 

In the Florentine Codex, the index of the work reads thus: Αὕτη ἡ βίβλος
Χριστιανικὴ Τοπογραφία περιεκτικὴ παντὸς του̃ κόσμου παρ̕ ἡμι̃ν
ὠνομασμένη*. This Book named by us Christian Topography comprehensive of
the whole world,* Montfaucon entitles it: Cosmae Egyptii Monachi
Christiana Topographia, sive Christianorum Opinio de Mundo: *The
Christian* <span id="piii">\|iii</span> *Topography of Cosmas, an
Egyptian Monk, or the Opinion of Christians concerning the World.* As
Cosmas all through the work keeps harping, with the most provoking
reiteration, on his doctrine that the universe consists of only two
*places,* namely, the earth which is below the firmament, and heaven,
which is above it, the term *Topography* designates the treatise
properly enough; though on turning to peruse it for the first time, we
should from its title expect its contents to be very different from what
they are found to be.

#### NOTICE OF THE WORK BY PHOTIUS, PATRIARCH OF CONSTANTINOPLE.

Montfaucon does not seem to have been aware that a brief notice of the
*Topography* is to be found in the *Bibliotheka* of Photius, the
Patriarch of Constantinople, who was elected to that dignity in A.D.
858. Photius states that the work had for its title Χριστιανω̃ν βίβλος,
and was an exposition extending to the eighth book. He does not give the
author's name, but states that he flourished in the reign of the Roman
Emperor Justinus, and dedicated his work to a certain Pamphilus. He
condemns it as being below mediocrity in style, and faulty in its
syntax; and at the same time calls in question the author's veracity,
saying that he makes up stories so incredible that he may fairly be
regarded as a writer of fables rather than of facts. He then gives a
very concise summary of the <span id="piv">\|iv</span> contents of the
*Topography,* and concludes with a reference to the last four books,
which had from time to time been added to defend the doctrines set forth
in those which had preceded.

#### THE NAME OF THE AUTHOR OF THE "TOPOGRAPHY."

A doubt long ago arose as to whether Cosmas was the proper or family
name of the author of the *Topography.* Isaac Voss first started this
doubt, and Fabricius subsequently gave currency to the opinion that
Cosmas was so called because his work was devoted to a description of
the Kosmos: just as the Abbot John of Sinai was called Climacius because
he had published a work entitled *Climax.* In the absence of evidence,
this must remain an open question.

#### BIOGRAPHY OF COSMAS.

The *Topography* fortunately contains passages which throw light on the
personal history of its author, and enable us also to fix with certainty
the date at which he wrote. He was most probably a native of Alexandria,
and may have been of Greek parentage. His education was confined to the
more elementary branches of knowledge, such as would fit him for the
career he pursued in the earlier part of his life----that of a merchant.
But though he was not instructed, as he tells us
himself,[<sup>2</sup>](#2.md) <span id="pv">\|v</span> in the "learning of
the schools," yet so inquisitive was his turn of mind and so sharp his
intellect that he eventually acquired such a knowledge of literature and
science as raised him to the level of the culture of his time, and to
his being accepted as a capable exponent and defender of the Christian
faith.

The commercial pursuits of Cosmas carried him into seas and countries
far remote from his home. Thus he tells us that he had sailed upon three
of the great gulfs which run up into the earth from the ocean, namely,
the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea, and Persian Gulf.[<sup>3</sup>](#3.md)
He sailed also upon that part of the Erythraean Sea which beyond Cape
Guardafui stretches southward toward the outlying ocean, which in those
days was regarded with terror and held to be unnavigable on account of
the violent currents and dense and dismal fogs in which it was thought
to be enveloped. When the ship which carried Cosmas was approaching this
dread region of currents and fogs, a storm gathered overhead, and flocks
of albatrosses, like birds of ill omen, hovered on the wing high above
the mast. Dismay seized alike the passengers and the crew, and amidst
outcries of "port the helm," the course of the vessel was reversed and
she headed northwards.[<sup>4</sup>](#4.md) Cosmas does not say whether in
the course of this voyage he reached India, which was his destination
when he embarked. <span id="pvi">\|vi</span> If he did not, he must have
made a second and more successful attempt; for no one, we think, who
reads his eleventh book, in which he describes the island of Ceylon and
the ports, commerce, and animals of India, can doubt that he writes
about these places from personal knowledge of them.

One of the most interesting and instructive parts of the *Topography* is
that in which Cosmas relates what he had heard and seen in the course of
his travels in Ethiopia.[<sup>5</sup>](#5.md) By the name of *Ethiopia* he
designates in a general way the vast region which stretches southward
from Egypt down towards the equator; and from an incidental remark which
he drops when treating of the Adulitic inscription on the
throne,<sup>[<sup>6</sup>](#6.md)</sup> we learn that he had traversed it
almost throughout its length and its breadth. Like Herodotus of old, he
was ever athirst after knowledge, and when he was unable to visit places
which lay in the vicinity of his route, he made inquiries about them
from such persons as knew them and could be trusted to report things
truly. The capital of Ethiopia at that time was Axum, an important
centre of commerce, and also of religion and learning. It was one of the
places which Cosmas, in pursuit of his calling,
visited,[<sup>7</sup>](#7.md) and from one or two of his statements we may
infer that he was well received at Court, and was permitted by the King,
who professed the Christian faith and could speak Greek, to travel
freely through his dominions. <span id="pvii">\|vii</span> 

The seaport of Axum was Adule or Adulis,<sup>[<sup>8</sup>](#8.md)</sup>
the modern Zulá or Thulla, situated near Annesley Bay and distant from
the capital about one hundred and twenty miles or an eight days'
journey. Cosmas found himself here in the year 525 A.D., at which time
Elesboas, the King of Axum, was preparing an expedition against the
Homerites in Arabia.[<sup>9</sup>](#9.md) Here, at the request of the
Governor, Cosmas, along with his friend Menas, a monk of the monastery
at Raithu, copied the famous Greek inscriptions on the marble tablet and
the basanite throne, which lay together outside the town on the road
which led to Axum.[<sup>10</sup>](#10.md)

Among other parts of Ethiopia which our traveller visited we may include
the Aromatic country----that great projection on the east of the African
Continent which terminates in Cape Guardafui. His description of this
district (which supplied the Egyptians of old with their spices for
embalming the dead), and of its products and its foreign trade, shows
that it must have come from the pen of an
eye-witness.[<sup>11</sup>](#11.md) He may also have proceeded to the
north-west, and visited the kingdom of Meroe (now Khartum), for in that
direction lay the seats of several tribes mentioned in the inscription
on the throne. Montfaucon, in his Preface, credits him with the
discovery, in the Abyssinian province called Agau, of the true source of
the Nile. It was not, however, the source of the main stream <span
id="pviii">\|viii</span>  which he discovered, but that of the Blue
Nile,<sup>[<sup>12</sup>](#12.md)</sup> which, a millennium afterwards, was
rediscovered by the Portuguese, and more recently by the Scottish
traveller Bruce. There was still another interesting locality which the
traveller tells us he visited, and this lay on the other side of the Red
Sea----the Desert, namely, of Sinai, where he found, strewn among the
sands, fragments of rock covered with inscriptions which he took to have
been carved by the Israelites when they were wandering in that
wilderness.[<sup>13</sup>](#13.md)

Cosmas, when all his travels were over, returned to Alexandria, perhaps
after paying a visit to Jerusalem; and, abandoning the secular life,
retired to the seclusion of the cloister, where he devoted his leisure
to the composition of works on descriptive geography, cosmography, and
Scriptural exegesis. Of these, the *Christian Topography* alone is
extant. The loss of the geographical treatise, as Montfaucon well says,
is to be deplored with tears. It has been conjectured that the
geographical passages in the *Topography,* as, for instance, the
description of Ceylon in the eleventh book, are extracts from that
treatise.

#### THE CHRISTIAN SECT TO WHICH COSMAS BELONGED.

In the days of Cosmas ecclesiastical controversies were rife, and
professing Christians were divided <span id="pix">\|ix</span> into
numerous sects. That to which Cosmas most probably belonged was the
Nestorian. To this point Photius makes no reference, and it has been
equally overlooked by Montfaucon. The first who called in question the
orthodoxy of our Monk was De La Croze, who, in his *Histoire du
Christianisme des Indes,* adduced the following arguments to prove his
Nestorian proclivities: ----1°, that Cosmas calls Patricius, who was the
Archbishop of Persia when that country had been infected with
Nestorianism, a divine man and an illustrious
teacher;[<sup>14</sup>](#14.md) 2°, that Cosmas, in his list of heretical
sects, names the Manichaeans, the Marcionists, the Eutychians, the
Arians and the Apollinarians, but not the
Nestorians;[<sup>15</sup>](#15.md) 3°, that in his exposition of Scripture,
and in his system of the world, he always follows Theodosius of
Mopsuestia and Diodorus of Tarsus, who were the principal teachers of
the Nestorians; 4°, that concerning Christ and the Incarnation of the
Word, he uses the same modes of expression as the
Nestorians.[<sup>16</sup>](#16.md) We may add as a fifth argument the
glowing terms in which Cosmas speaks of the wide diffusion of
Christianity among the heathen nations of the east, which was mainly the
work of missionaries from Persia, where Nestorianism reigned
supreme.[<sup>17</sup>](#17.md) Only one passage occurs to throw some doubt
on the certainty of this conclusion----that in which Cosmas addresses
Mary as <span id="px">\|x</span> the *Mother of God,* an expression
abhorrent to the Nestorians. Had Cosmas in his monastery relapsed into
what was there considered orthodoxy?

#### THE DATE AT WHICH THE "TOPOGRAPHY" WAS WRITTEN.

We have already mentioned that the *Topography* has data from which the
time when Cosmas wrote can be certainly determined. In the second book
(p. 55), where he mentions his visit to Adulê, he observes that it was
made when Elesboas the Axumite King was preparing an expedition against
the Homerites in Arabia, and that this was at the beginning of the reign
of the Roman Emperor Justinus, since which time some five-and-twenty
years more or less had elapsed. Now, as it is known that the expedition
was made in A.D. 522, and that Justinus was at that date in the fifth
year of his reign, Cosmas must have been writing about the year 547. It
is true that an indication which apparently conflicts with this appears
in the tenth book (p. 351), where he speaks of Theodosius, the heretical
Bishop of Alexandria, as residing at the time in Constantinople, and
then on p. 353 refers to the death of his predecessor in office, Timothy
the younger,[<sup>18</sup>](#18.md) as an event of recent occurrence. Now
it is known that this Timothy died in 535, and was succeeded by
Theodosius, who, after a brief <span id="pxi">\|xi</span> residence in
his diocese went to Constantinople, whence he was banished in 536. The
tenth book must therefore have been written in the year preceding. How,
then, is this earlier date to be reconciled with the later? Montfaucon
answers this question satisfactorily. Cosmas, he points out, in order to
meet objections urged against his opinions, was in the habit of making
additions from time to time to the number of its books. The earlier date
thus probably indicates the time when he began to make such additions,
and the later when he was making the last, or one of the last,
recensions of his work.

#### OPINIONS OF THE LEARNED REGARDING THE "TOPOGRAPHY."

The condemnatory verdict of Photius upon the work of Cosmas has not been
endorsed by modern opinion. The style of the *Topography* has no doubt
the shortcomings which the Patriarch pointed out; but Cosmas, it is
proper to remember, expressly disclaims all pretensions to the learning
of the schools. He pleads that from his early years he had been so
engrossed in business, and had been besides so much abroad, that he had
found no spare time for studying rules of grammar and the art of
composition; he could, therefore, only write in a homely style, without
attempting any flights of rhetoric. Rhetoric, moreover would, he
thought, be out of place in his books, since "he wrote for <span
id="pxii">\|xii</span> Christians, who had more need of correct notions
than of fine phrases." The style has, notwithstanding, some redeeming
points. Cosmas, in spite of his loose grammar, seldom fails to make his
meaning clear, or to put forward his arguments with sufficient point and
force. Some passages, besides, which give us an insight into the depth
and fervour of his faith, rise to an eloquence which suggests the belief
that, had he cultivated the art, he might have shone in pulpit oratory.

It is, however, in relating his travelling experiences that Cosmas is
found at his best. The language he uses is simple, and his descriptions
are not only remarkably vivid, but are, above all things, truthful. In
this respect modern opinion is entirely at variance with that of
Photius. The greater knowledge now possessed of the remote regions which
Cosmas visited goes all to show that the thought of tickling the fancy
of his readers with tales of wonder had never entered his mind, but that
on the contrary he was a man who had a supreme regard for truth, and who
was at once an acute observer, and shrewd in judging the value of the
information which he received from others.

As soon as the *Topography,* in its complete edition by Montfaucon, made
its appearance, it excited great interest in the circles of learning,
and at once took rank as a work which contained more accurate and more
valuable information on geographical subjects than any other document
that had come down from the early mediaeval age. <span
id="pxiii">\|xiii</span> At the same time, the extreme singularity of
the views which it propounded on cosmology and on the interpretation of
Scripture texts filled its readers, with combined feelings of amazement
and amusement.

#### BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTICES.

The *Topography* was republished at Venice in 1776 in Gallandi's
*Bibliotheca veterum Patrum,* and its most valuable sections were,
printed, along with a French translation, at Paris in 1855, in Charton's
*Voyageurs Anciens et Modernes.* Its contents were made use of by
Robertson in his *Disquisition on Ancient India,* and by Gibbon in his
*History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.* The latter,
referring to the absurd theory of the world held by Cosmas, remarks that
"the nonsense of the Monk was, nevertheless, mingled with the practical
knowledge of the traveller".

Among the eminent geographers who have turned the *Topography* to
account may be mentioned Mannert, Gosselin, Humboldt, Dodwell, Playfair,
Bredow, Reinaud, Létronne, Sir Henry Yule,[<sup>19</sup>](#19.md) and Mr.
Raymond Beazley;[<sup>20</sup>](#20.md) while among <span
id="pxiv">\|xiv</span> ecclesiastical writers may be noted Allatius,
Bandini, De La Croze, Assemanni, Cave and Milne
Rae.<sup>[<sup>21</sup>](#21.md)</sup> The Adulitic inscriptions again have
exercised the pens of such scholars as: Fabricius, Chishull, Vincent,
Salt, Boeckh, V. de Saint-Martin, Dr. H. Müller of Vienna, and Dr.
Glaser of Munich.

#### THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COSMAS.

The *Christian Topography* is a production of which It may be truly said
τὸ πάρεργου κρει̃ττου του̃ ἔργου. It is essentially controversial, its
professed design being to refute, from Scripture and common sense, the
impious Pagan cosmography, according to which the earth is a sphere; and
the centre around which the heaven, which is also a sphere, revolves
with all its luminaries. The arguments with which Cosmas seeks to
demolish this theory and to illustrate his own are absurd in the
extreme; and were it not for the geographical, historical, and other
kinds of notices which are here and there incidentally introduced into
its pages, his work would chiefly serve for amusement. According to his
view, the figure of  <span id="pxv">\|xv</span> the universe can best be
learned from a study of the structure and furniture of the Tabernacle
which Moses prepared in the wilderness.[<sup>22</sup>](#22.md) This
wonderful conception did not originate with himself. Some of the
Christian Fathers who preceded him had entertained it in a vague and
general way, believing it might be warranted by the expression's in
*Hebrews,* ix, 23 and 24, where the Tabernacle and its contents are said
to be *patterns* (ὑποδείγματα) and *antitypes* or *figures of the true*
(ἀντίτυπα τω̃ν ἀληθινω̃ν). It was left to Cosmas to develop the conception
and work it out into all its details. So he explains again and again
that the division of the Tabernacle into two places, by means of the
veil, typified the division of the universe into two worlds----an upper
and a lower, by means of the firmament. The table of shew-bread, again,
with its waved border, represented the earth surrounded by the ocean,
while its other parts and the things upon it symbolized each some object
or other in the natural world. Now, as the table was twice as long as it
was broad, and was placed lengthwise from east to west, and breadthwise
from north to south, from this we learn that the earth is a rectangular
plane which extends in length from east to west, and in breadth from
north to south, and is twice as long as it is broad. The ocean, he
further gives us to know, is unnavigable, and, while encompassing this
earth of ours, is itself encompassed by another earth, which had been
the <span id="pxvi">\|xvi</span> seat of Paradise and the abode of man
until the Ark, floating on the billows of the Flood, wafted Noah and his
family over into this earth. The heavens come downward to us in four
walls, which, at their lower sides, are welded to the four sides of the
earth beyond ocean, each to each. The upper side of the northern wall,
at the summit of heaven, curves round and over, till it unites with the
upper side of the southern wall, and thus forms, in the shape of an
oblong vault, the canopy of heaven, which Cosmas likens to the vaulted
roof of a bathroom. This vast rectangular hall is divided at the middle
into two stories by the firmament, which thus serves as a ceiling for
the lower story and a floor for the upper. The lower story is this
world, where men and angels have their abode until the Resurrection, and
the story above is heaven ---- the place of the future state. As to the
position (θέσις) of the earth in the scheme of things, Scripture left
Cosmas in no doubt. The Psalmist had declared that the Creator had
founded the earth upon its own stability (ἐπι τὴν ἀσφάλειαν αὐτη̃ς); Job,
that He had hanged it upon nothing; and Isaiah, that, while heaven was
His throne, the earth was His footstool. Clearly, therefore, the place
of the earth was at the bottom of the universe ---- a position to which
it must have naturally sunk (as he shows in a very curious passage) at
the very instant of its creation.[<sup>23</sup>](#23.md) What then can be
more absurd than the Pagan doctrine that the earth is in the <span
id="pxvii">\|xvii</span> middle of the universe? Were it in the middle,
there must be something *below* it as well as *above* it; but there is
nothing *below* it, since we learn from Genesis that God made heaven and
earth, and nothing else beyond these. Here then the Pagans are at war
with divine Scripture; but, not content with this, they are at war also
with common sense itself and the very laws of nature, declaring, as they
do, that the earth is a central sphere, and that there are Antipodes,
who must be standing head-downward and on whom the rain must fall *up.*

Referring to the figure of the world as thus conceived by Cosmas, Sir
Henry Yule with grim humour remarked that "one of the huge receptacles
in which female travellers of our day carry their dresses, forms a
perfect model of the Kosmos of Kosmas". The theory, again, by which
Cosmas accounts for the vicissitudes of day and night is no less
preposterous than his idea of the figure of the world. The Pagan theory
that the earth is spherical and placed in the centre of the universe,
with the heavenly bodies revolving round it, accounted satisfactorily
for the disappearance of the sun during the night; but where could
Cosmas, in whose philosophy there was neither a spherical earth nor any
under-world, find a place for the great orb of light when no longer
visible? The problem did not baffle his ingenuity. Calling to his aid
the words of Solomon, which declared that the sun on rising turned first
towards the south and then <span id="pxviii">\|xviii</span> towards the
north, where he went down, and thence hastened to the place in which he
arose, he made them the basis of the following extraordinary theory. The
earth, he tells us, gradually rising up from the south, extends
westward, until it culminates at last in a huge conical mountain
situated somewhere in the far-away frozen north. Behind this immense
cone, the sun at the close of day disappears from view, and leaves the
world which we inhabit in darkness, until, having circled round the
cone, he reappears in the east to give birth to a new day. According,
moreover, as he is high or low during his nocturnal revolution, the
nights vary in their length; while, owing to a slight obliquity in his
motion, eclipses are produced. On the question of the magnitude of the
great luminary Cosmas differed widely from the Pagan philosophers, and
wrote his sixth book mainly to prove that, instead of its being, as they
thought, many times larger than the earth, it was no more than the size
of two only of the earth's climates or zones, those between the
latitudes of Alexandria and Rhodes, and Rhodes and Constantinople, an
extent of about 635 geographical miles.[<sup>24</sup>](#24.md) But the
words of Solomon form by no means the only Scriptural warrant for taking
this view of the order of nature, for the candlestick placed on the
south of the table of shew-bread typified the sun shining upon the earth
from the south towards the north, while the waved border <span
id="pxix">\|xix</span> which ran round the table typified the ocean
surrounded by the outer earth, both of which were illuminated by the sun
while circling round the gigantic mountain.[<sup>25</sup>](#25.md)

The Pagan theory which Cosmas especially detested, and made most
frequently the subject of his scornful and violent invective, was that
which maintained that the heavens were spherical and in constant
revolution. He heaps text upon text to confute the advocates of this
most pestilent doctrine, which, if admitted, would, he contended,
abolish the future state and make the resurrection of Christ of no
account.

But while Cosmas regarded as impious the doctrine that the heavens
revolve, he admitted the revolution of the celestial luminaries, which,
he held, were propelled in their courses by the angels, who do not live
in heaven but are restricted to the aerial spaces below the firmament,
until the resurrection.

All these and other views no less absurd, though interesting, Cosmas
states and re-states with the most wearisome pertinacity, and holding
them to be most vital verities, sanctioned alike by common sense and the
paramount authority of divine Scripture, denounces again and again
"those reprobate Christians who, instead of accepting them, prefer,
through their perverse folly or downright wickedness, to adopt the
miserable Pagan belief <span id="pxx">\|xx</span> that earth and heaven
are spherical, and that there are Antipodes on whom the rain must fall
*up.*

#### CRITICISMS OF HIS SYSTEM.

Since the *Topography* had for its main design the exposition of these
views, it has been compared by Yule to "a mere bank of mud, but
remarkable on account of certain geographical fossils which are found
imbedded in it". This comparison, however, we venture to think, does
less than justice to the work, for besides the geographical there are
many other "fossils" to be found in the mud, of different kinds and
generally of more or less interest and value. A list of these----but not
pretending to be complete----has been given by Montfaucon in his
Introduction. Among others may be specified the indication of Clysma as
the place of the passage of the Red Sea; the wares brought by merchants
to the Israelites when they sojourned in the wilderness; the seat of the
terrestrial Paradise; the worship of Mithras by the Persians; the rite
of baptism; the date of the Nativity; the question of the canonicity of
the Catholic Epistles; the exposition of the prayer of Hezekiah; the
inscriptions on the rocks found in the desert of Sinai; the state of
Christianity in Socotra, Ceylon and India; the extent to which
Christianity had spread over the heathen world; the interpretation of
the prophecies of Daniel; extracts from Pagan writers and Fathers of the
Church preserved only by Cosmas; and his views on the destiny of
children <span id="pxxi">\|xxi</span> who die in the womb or in infancy.
The portion, moreover, of the *Topography* which is the "mud bank" of
the comparison is not without some value. It is a specimen of a once
prevalent and not yet quite extinct mode of Scriptural exegesis; it
reveals what were some of the main currents of thought which permeated
the Christian world at the beginning of the Middle Ages; it discloses to
what a lamentable degree, as Monotheistic Christianity rose to the
ascendant, triumphant alike over the Persian Dualism of the Manichceans,
and the Greek Pantheism of the Neo-Platonists, the light of Hellenic
learning and science had faded from Christendom before as yet Islam,
which was destined to receive and preserve that light, had appeared in
the world; and while it exhibits the attitude in which Theology and
Science in those days stood to each other, it illustrates the signal
danger of regarding Scripture as a store-house of divine communications
which may be turned to account in defending or in oppugning scientific
speculations. To quote Yule once more: "The work is a memorable example
of that mischievous process of loading Christian truth with a dead
weight of false science."

#### OTHER WORKS BESIDES THE "TOPOGRAPHY" WRITTEN BY COSMAS.

Besides the *Christian Topography* Cosmas wrote several other works, of
which the most important <span id="pxxii">\|xxii</span> was one
addressed to Constantinus, in which he described the whole earth. Cosmas
mentions it in Book 1. A second was entitled *A Delineation or Image of
the Universe and of the Stellar Motion, made in imitation of the
artificial Sphere of the Pagans, and a Treatise thereon addressed to the
most Pious Deacon Homologus.* A third book was *A Commentary on the Song
of Songs;* and a fourth *An Exposition of the Psalms.*

#### GENERAL NATURE OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH BOOK OF THE "TOPOGRAPHY."

To the *Topography,* when first published, Cosmas prefixed two
prologues, in the first of which he exhorts his readers to bestow upon
his works a diligent and careful perusal; and in the second, which
contained the dedication to Pamphilus and apologies for his own
shortcomings as a writer, he points out the nature of the contents of
each of the five books of which the work then consisted. In the first
book he attacks, and to his own satisfaction demolishes, the pernicious
anti-Christian doctrines of the Pagan philosophy, that the world is
spherical and that there are Antipodes. In the second he propounds the
true theory which all Christians are bound to accept, based as it is
upon the inspired Word, and maintained, besides even by some of the
Pagan philosophers themselves. By the citation of measurements of the
earth made from east to west and from north to <span
id="pxxiii">\|xxiii</span> south, he seeks to prove that the length of
the earth is twice its breadth. In the third book he insists on the
authority and harmony of Scripture, adducing many texts, which, as in
the preceding book, he twists with audacious ingenuity to lend support
to his own impossible theory. In the two following books he again
demolishes the doctrine of the spheres, while he re-states and fortifies
his own theory with a long array of additional texts.

The publication of these books, which gave definite and uncompromising
expression to views of which the germs had long been vaguely floating
about in the air of Christendom, produced, as might have been expected
from their novelty when seen wrought together into a self-consistent
system, a startling effect. Objections were urged----directed especially
against his views regarding the figure of the world. How, he was asked,
could the sun, which was many times larger than the earth, be hidden
behind the mountain in the north, however great its altitude? The sixth
book was written to show that the sun, so far from being many times
larger than the earth, was in point of fact only the size of two of the
earth's "climates".

The seventh book, addressed to Athanasius, sought to refute a work
written by a professing Christian, who held that heaven was an
ever-revolving sphere, but nevertheless dissoluble. Cosmas cites and
expounds numerous texts to show that the heavens cannot be dissolved,
and that neither men nor angels can "enter into them until after the
<span id="pxxiv">\|xxiv</span> Resurrection. The eighth book is
addressed by Cosmas to another of his friends, called Peter, who had
asked him to expound the Prayer of Hezekiah. The exposition is given,
and Cosmas then proceeds to show how the minds of the Babylonians had
been impressed by the miraculous sign of the retrogression of the shadow
upon the sun-dial----and how Cyrus had been led to favour the Jews and
dismiss them from their Babylonian captivity by his reading the
prophecies of Isaiah which referred to himself even by name. The ninth
book, treating of the heavenly bodies, ascribes their motions to the
angels, who groan under this hard and incessant toil which they perform
for the benefit of man, and not for their own. They would have sunk,
therefore, into despair, had they not seen that, even after the Fall,
God was merciful and kind to man, on whose destinies their own depended.
They were further encouraged when they afterwards saw that the Apostle
Paul was caught up into the third heaven, and was there entertained with
a glimpse of its glories.

In the tenth book Cosmas cites a number of the Fathers to show that his
doctrines were in closest harmony with the teachings of the Church. In
the eleventh, which is entirely geographical, he describes some animals
and plants which he had seen or heard of in the course of his travels,
and gives an account also of the island of Ceylon, and of its extensive
commerce with India, Persia, China, and the countries of the west. The
twelfth <span id="pxxv">\|xxv</span> and last book shows that several of
the old Pagan writers bore testimony to the antiquity of the Old
Testament scriptures.

#### THE MAPS AND SKETCHES WHICH ILLUSTRATE THE VIEWS OF COSMAS.

"There is," says Mr. Raymond Beazley, in the admirable work we have
already referred to, "another interest about the *Topography.* It
contains in all probability the oldest Christian maps that have
survived. There is little reason to doubt that the numerous sketches
.... which are to be found in the Florentine manuscript of the tenth
century were really drawn by Cosmas himself (or under his direction) in
the sixth; and are thus at least two centuries earlier than the Map of
Albi, or the original sketch of the Spanish monk Beatus" (p. 281). The
Plates found in the Appendix have been reproduced by photography from
those which accompany Montfaucon's edition of the *Topography.*

#### THE PLACE OF COSMAS IN HISTORY.

With regard to the place which Cosmas holds in history, we cannot do
better than cite the estimate expressed by the same writer, whose wide
and accurate knowledge of mediaeval literature enables him to speak *ex
cathedra* on the subject. "Cosmas," he says, "is of interest to us as
the last of the old Christian geographers, and in a sense, too, the
first <span id="pxxvi">\|xxvi</span> of the mediaeval. He closes one age
of civilization which had slowly declined from the self-satisfied
completeness of the classical world, and he prepares us to enter another
that, in comparison, is literally dark. From the rise of Islam the
geographical knowledge of Christendom is on a par with its practical
contraction and apparent decline. Even more than actual exploration,
theoretical knowledge seemed on its death-bed for the next five hundred
years" (p. 33). In a subsequent passage dealing with the same topic, he
says: "The place of Cosmas in history has been sometimes misconceived.
His work is not, as it has been called (in the earlier years of this
century), the chief authority of the Middle Ages in geography. For, on
the whole, its influence is only slightly, and occasionally, traceable.
Its author stated his position as an article of Christian faith, but
even in those times there was anything but a general agreement with his
positive conclusions. . . The subtleties of Cosmas were left to the
Greeks, for the most part; the western geographers who pursued his line
of thought were usually content to stop short at the merely negative
dogmas of the Latin Fathers; and no great support was given to the
constructive tabernacle system of the Indian merchant. . . . Yet, after
all, the *Christian Topography.* must always be remarkable. . . . It is
one of the earliest important essays in scientific or strictly theoretic
geography, within the Christian aera, written by a Christian thinker"
(p. 283). Mr. Beazley concludes his long <span
id="pxxvii">\|xxvii</span> notice of the great Christian Cosmographer in
these terms: "He felt himself to be the apostle of full supernatural
theory in science. He knew that his work was unique. And such it has
always been recognised----by some with rapture, by others with
consternation, by most with derision. At least it is a monument of
infinite, because quite unconscious, humour. 'For neither before him was
any like unto him, neither shall be after.' "
