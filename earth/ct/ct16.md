Explanation of the plates**

<span id="img_cosmas14-1"></span> ![](img/cosmas14-1.jpg)

# EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES.

Plate I.----The picture on the left represents the City of Adulê----that
on the right an Ethiopian travelling from Adulê to Axômê. The lower
picture on the left is the tablet with the Greek inscription copied by
Cosmas. It is surmounted by the figure of Ptolemy Euergetês, standing in
a warlike attitude. The throne represented on the right is ascribed to
the same Ptolemy by Cosmas, but erroneously. It was placed at Adulê by
an Axumite conqueror. The writing on the right of it is Δίφρος
Πτολεμοικός, Ptolemy's chair.

Plate 2.----The figure of the earth and the heaven, as Cosmas and the
ancient Fathers conceived it. The cross-bar represents the firmament.

Plate 3.----A picture of the waters above the firmament.

Plate 4.----A representation of the conical mountain, and also of the
sun and the moon under the firmament. The inscription along the pillars
is: of οἱ στύλοι του̃ οὐρανου̃, the pillars of the heaven.

Plate 5.----A tracing of the inhabited world (γη̃ οἰκουμένη).

Plate 6.----A representation of the oblong rectangular figure of the
earth which we inhabit, with its surrounding ocean, which is itself
surrounded by the other earth which was the seat of Paradise and the
abode of man before the Flood. The four gulfs which penetrate into our
earth from the ocean, and the rivers which flow into it from Paradise,
are also depicted. Above the ocean in the outer earth is this
inscription· Φη̃ πέραν του̃ ὠκεανου̃ ἔνθα πρὸ του̃ κατακλυσμου̃ κατώκουν οἱ
ἄνθρωποι , the earth beyond the ocean where men dwelt before the Flood.
The lateral inscription is· Φη̃ πέραν του̃ ὠκεανου̃, the earth beyond the
ocean. The inscription in the figure of the great gulf coming from the
west is Ρωμαικὸς Κόλπος, the Roman gulf, *ie*., the Mediterranean. The
gulf coming from the north Cosmas calls Κασπετά Θάλασσα, the Caspian
Sea. The name of the northern river is Φεισω̃ν, and of the southern Φηω̃ν
ποταμός, the Pison and Gihon of our bibles. <span

Plate 7.----A representation of the earth with the walls which come down
to it from heaven. The four gulfs are shown, and the conical mountain in
the north-west whence the earth slopes downward to the south.

Plate 8.----A picture of the conical mountain with three circling lines
to show the paths of the sun as he moves round it at different
altitudes, thus making the nights shorter or longer. The words written
here are μικρὰ νὺξ, μέση νὺξ, μεγάλη νὺξ, short night, night of medium
length, long night.

Plate 9.----The figure of the world according to the Ptolemaic system.
The twelve signs of the Zodiac are shown, and the names are given of the
Roman and Egyptian months. The earth, in the form which Cosmas so much
abhorred, is in the centre, encircled by the orbits in succession of the
Moon, Σελήνης? of Mercury, Ἑρμου̃? of Venus, ̕Αφροδίτης? of the Sun,
Ἡλίου? of Mars, Ἄρεος? of Jupiter, Δίος. The names of the Roman months
are given in Greek characters, thus· Γεναρις, Φλεβάρις, Μάρτιος,
Αυρίλλιος (u = v̓, Μαιος, Ιουνιος, Ιουλιος, ̕Αυγυστος, Σεπτεβριος,
υκτωβριος, Νοευριος, Δικεβρις. Above the outer rim of the Zodiac are
given the names of the twelve signs with the names of the corresponding
Egyptian months· Αιγό-κερως Tybi? τοξότης Choiac? σκορπίος Athyr· ζυγὸς
Phaophy? παρθένος Thôth? λέων Mesori? καρκίνος Epiphi? Διδυμοι Payni?
ταυ̃ρος Pachôn? κριὸς Pharmouth? ἰχθυ̃ς Phamenôth? ὑδρόχοος Mechir.

Plate 10.----Antipodes drawn to deride the idea of their possibility.

Plate 11.----A delineation of the figure and dress of the pagan
inhabitants of Attica, οἱ ἔξωθεν ̕Αττικοί, as seen in the time of
Cosmas. These figures are meant for those of Hyperides and Menander,
mentioned in p. 147.

Plate 12.----A representation of the outward form of the Tabernacle, ἡ
Σκηνή. The words written outside indicate the directions, ἀνατολή, east·
βοῤῥα̃ς, north? Δύσις, west. The double line in the centre drawn from
north to south represents the veil, καταπέτασμα, dividing the Tabernacle
into the inner and outer sanctuary. The division to the right represents
the outer, which contained the table of shew-bread, ἡ τράπεζα? the
candlestick, λυχνία? Aaron's rod, ῥάβδος the vessel of sprinkling,
στάμνος? the two tables of the Law, αἱ πλακές? the serpent, ὄφις. In the
inner Tabernacle, ἐσωτέρα σκηνή, is depicted the Ark of the Testimony, ἡ
κιβωτός του̃ μαρτυρίου. See pp. 148-154.

Plate 14.----A delineation of the coverings of the Tabernacle,
σκεπάσματα τη̃ς σκηνη̃ς· the loops, ἀγκύλαι, and clasps, κρίκοι, by which
they were joined. <span id="p391">\|391</span> 

Plate 15. ---- A picture of the table of the Tabernacle turned by the
lathe, τράπεζα τορνευτός, and another of the candlestick with its seven
lamp-wicks, λυχνία ἑπτάμυχος? its shaft, καυλός? its ball, καρύισκος, in
the middle of the shaft; its spherical bowl, σφαιρωτὴρ κρατὴρ? its lily,
κρίνον? and its branches καλαμίσκοι, three on each side of the shaft,
making, along with the terminus of the shaft, seven in all, and
representing, according to Cosmas, the seven days of the week. See p.
152.

Plate 1 6. ---- The Ark of the Testimony, ἡ κιβωτός του̃ μαρτυρίου. Above
it is the Propitiatory or Mercy-seat, ἱλαστήριον. Above it the Cherubim
χερουβίμ figure of Zacharias on one side, and that of Abia on the other.

Plate 17. ---- A delineation of the Court of the Tabernacle, ἡ αὐλὴ τη̃ς
σκηνη̃ς? the other words denote the directions· ἀνατολὴ, δύσις, ἄρκτος,
μεσημβρία, east, west, north, south.

Plate 18. ---- The upper figures represent the celestials; the middle,
the terrestrials; and those below, the subterraneans or the buried. See
pp. 300-303.

Plate 19. ---- A delineation of the order in which the contents of the
outer Tabernacle were arranged. On the left is the table (τράπεζα) of
shew-bread, with three loaves at each of its four corners, to represent
the fruits of each of the four seasons (see p. 152); then follow the
candlestick, λυχνία? the vessel of sprinkling, στάμνος? the tables of
the Law πλακές? the serpent ὄφις.

Plate 20. ---- Melchisedek arrayed in his royal robes. See p. 175.

Plate 21. ---- A front and back view of Aaron wearing his priestly robes
τὸ σχη̃μα του̃ ἱερέως. Montfaucon states that Cosmas, in explanation of
this sketch, wrote for the figure on the right· ̕Ααρὼν μέγας ἀρχιερεὺς
ἐμπροσθοφανής front view of Aaron, the great high priest; and for the
figure on the left· ̕Ααρὼν μέγας ἀρχιερευ̃ς ὀπισθοφανής back view of
Aaron, the great high priest.

Plate 22. ---- A delineation of the circle of the twelve months and the
fruits produced in each month. Outside the circle are written the names
of the Egyptian months Μηνὲς ̕Αιγυπτίοι, and of the four seasons, which
he designates respectively, ἐαρινή τροπή the spring tropic? θερινή τροπή
the summer tropic? μετοπωρινή τροπή the autumn tropic? χειμερὶνή τροπή
the winter tropic. The fruit produced in Egypt in Pharmouth (April) is
σκόροδα, garlic; in Pachôn (May̓, κίννα a kind of pulse; in Payni
(June̓, κάρυα ̕Αρμένια Armenian nuts; in Epiphi (July̓, σι̃τος κοπύμωρα.
Montfaucon takes the latter <span id="p392">\|392</span> word to be a
mistake for συκόμορος the fig-mulberry, called also συκάμινος ἡ
̕Αιγυπτία? in Mesori (August̓, συ̃κα σταφύλια, figs, grapes: but to judge
from the picture only one kind of fruit is indicated; in Thôth
(September̓, ελαιόδακνα an unknown fruit; in Phaophy (October̓,
φοίνικες, palms or palm-leaves; in Athyr (November̓, ἀσπαράγια
asparagus; in Choiac (December̓, μαλάχαι mallows; in Tybi (January̓,
ἐυτύβια, endives; in Mechir (February̓, ἀγλάτια· this is unknown; in
Phamenôth (March̓, κίτρα fruit of citron?

The remaining plates are pictures of the animals and plants which Cosmas
has described in the earlier portion of the eleventh book.
