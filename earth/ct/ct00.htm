to the online edition.</b></p>


<P>Cosmas Indicopleustes ('India-voyager') of Alexandria was a
Greek sailor in the early 6th century who travelled to Ethiopia, India and Sri
Lanka.&nbsp; He then became a monk, probably of Nestorian tendencies, and around
550 AD wrote a strange book, copiously illustrated, which is the text presented
here.</p>

<P>There can be few books which have attracted more derision, mixed
with wonder, than the <i>Christian Topography</i> of Cosmas
Indicopleustes.&nbsp; It advances the idea that the world is flat, and that the
heavens form the shape of a box with a curved lid.&nbsp; The author cites
passages of scripture which he distorts wildly in order to support his thesis,
and attempts to argue down the idea of a spherical earth by stigmatizing it as
'pagan.'&nbsp; The approach to scripture is discreditable, and the conclusion
made simply wrong.</p>

<P>The book is often cited as evidence that Christianity introduced
the idea of the flat-earth into the world, and brought in the age of
ignorance.&nbsp; This is hardly fair, since Cosmas does not represent a
mainstream of any kind, personally or spiritually.&nbsp; The latter pages of his
work are devoted to rebutting the criticism of his fellow-monks, that what he
was saying was wrong.</p>

<P>As far as we can judge from the surviving literature, Christians
and pagans did not as such hold different views about the shape of the
world.&nbsp; Some of the philosophers had supposed a spherical earth, and even
calculated its size, and some Christians followed them, particularly if they
were educated men.&nbsp; Other philosphers had derided the idea, and some
Christians did likewise, such as Lactantius and Cosmas.&nbsp; Naturally
Christian writers of this school turned to scripture to illustrate their theme,
but their methods of exegesis attracted severe criticism from other Christian
authors such as Photius.&nbsp; In short, it was a subject on which there was no
certain knowledge in the ancient world.&nbsp; In the absence of the Victorian
culture of science which we enjoy today, there was also no means for a
proto-scientist to publish his discovery in such a way that it would be clear to
all that he was not simply a crank idly speculating.&nbsp; It seems unreasonable
to condemn Cosmas for reflecting the era in which he lived, when our incredulity
reflects only the better-informed era in which we were wise enough to be born.</p>

<P>The book is not without value, however.&nbsp; 'Indicopleustes'
means 'Indian voyager'.&nbsp; We learn from stray scraps in classical literature
that there was some trade between the Roman empire and India.&nbsp; But Cosmas
was one of the rare souls who had actually made the journey.&nbsp; Indeed we
learn from his book that he had travelled over much of the Red Sea coast, and as
far as Ceylon (modern Sri Lanka), and he describes some of what he saw, and even
drew pictures of the strange animals in his autograph manuscript.&nbsp; Some of
these have been copied into the existing manuscripts.&nbsp; Away from his daft
theory, Cosmas proves to be an interesting and reliable guide.&nbsp; He happened
to be in Ethiopia at the time when the King of Axum was preparing a military
expedition to attack Jewish Arabs in the Yemen.&nbsp; He records now vanished
inscriptions.&nbsp; In short, he gives us a window into a fascinating world of
which we would otherwise know nothing.&nbsp; This is the main value of his work.</p>

<blockquote>

<P><i>Composition</i></p>

</blockquote>

<P>The work was originally in 5 books.&nbsp; Objections led to him
adding first book 6 and then further books up to book 10.&nbsp; Books 11 and 12
seem to have no connection with the main portion of the work, and may have been
added by a later editor from other works by Cosmas, such as his work on
Geography addressed to a certain Constantinus.&nbsp; This includes his
description of the island of Taprobane, Ceylon or Sri Lanka.&nbsp; The Vatican
manuscript was copied from a text of only 10 books.</p>

<blockquote>

<P><i>About Cosmas</i></p>

</blockquote>

<P>Cosmas' own name is not absolutely certain.&nbsp; Two of the
three Mss. give no name for the author -- only the Laurentian Ms. names
him.&nbsp; However a portion of book 5 appears in the marginal commentaries
('catenae') on the Psalms, giving the name <i>Cosmas Indicopleustes</i> as the
author.</p>

<P>Cosmas tells us that he was a native of Egypt, probably of
Alexandria.&nbsp; He never received a complete education (II, 1). He was a merchant
(II, 54 and 56) in early life, perhaps importing spices.&nbsp; He made many
voyages.&nbsp; He knew Palestine and the area around Mt. Sinai (V, 8, 14,
51-52), had been to Socotra (III, 65), and had navigated in the Mediterranean,
Red Sea and Persian Gulf (II, 29).&nbsp; He had rounded cape Gardafui and sailed
off Somalia (II, 30).&nbsp; Later in life he settled in
Alexandria, developed indigestion, ophthalmia and other ills (II, 1).&nbsp; That he was
a monk is supposed, as the Laurentian manuscript calls him &#x039A;&#x03BF;&#x03C3;&#x03BC;&#x03B1;&#x03C2;
&#x03BC;&#x03BF;&#x03BD;&#x03B1;&#x03C7;&#x03BF;&#x03C2;, and indeed it is likely enough.&nbsp; Cosmas even mentions in
book 2 another merchant, Menas, a friend of his, who also became a monk.</p>

<P>Cosmas is often referred to in the literature as a
Nestorian.&nbsp; He tells us that he was a pupil of Patricius, Theodore of
Mopsuestia and Diodorus of Tarsus, and a friend of Thomas of Edessa.&nbsp; All
of these were Nestorians.&nbsp; He highlights the churches planted in the East,
all again Nestorian.&nbsp; One passage only gives the opposite impression, that
where he uses the Chalcedonian term <i>theotokos</i>, Mother of God, for Mary;
but this passage is not found in the Vatican manuscript, suggesting it is a
later addition.</p>

<P>Interestingly he refers to Marcionites and Montanists in book 5,
which suggests that these groups were still active in his part of the world at
this time.</p>

<blockquote>

<P><i>Date of the work</i></p>

</blockquote>

<P>The date of the work is fairly certain.&nbsp; In book 2, Cosmas
tells us that it is 25 years since he was in Axum, and he was there when
Elesbaas was preparing his expedition against the Homerites.&nbsp; That
expedition probably took place in 525 AD, or possibly 522 AD.&nbsp; At the
beginning of book 6, he refers to two eclipses, giving the dates as Mechir 12
and Mesori 24: these would seem to be the eclipses of 6 Feb. 547 and 17 Aug.
547.&nbsp; The logical inference is that the work was written around 550 AD.</p>

<blockquote>

<P><i>Greek text</i></p>

</blockquote>

<P>McCrindle's translation is given in the following pages.&nbsp;
This was based on the only available Greek text, that of the great Montfaucon,
which Migne had reprinted.&nbsp; Nevertheless this was a pre-critical
text.&nbsp; In 1909 E.O.Winstedt published a critical edition of the text,
without a translation but with English preface and notes.&nbsp; I considered
adding his preface to this collection also, but it is difficult to scan and not
really relevant in large portions.&nbsp; I have drawn on it for various points
in this preface, and also made use of the preface to Wanda Wolska-Conus edition,
Sources Chr&#233;tiennes 141 (1968).</p>

<P>Montfaucon's text was primarily based on the Laurentian
manuscript (L). Those who have read his <i>Diarium Italicum</i> will appreciate
the difficulties this venerable scholar, the father of bibliography, faced in
obtaining access to manuscripts in Italy.&nbsp; Winstedt suggests that his text
does not follow the manuscript very closely.&nbsp; One serious error occurs in
book 5 (248B-249B), where a leaf is missing in L.&nbsp; Montfaucon for whatever
reason only restored a small part of this text from V.&nbsp; Unfortunately this
passage is the one used in the catenae, and the difference has led to confusion
over whether Cosmas wrote some other work containing the words in the
catena.&nbsp; All of them are in fact from the <i>Christian Topography</i>.</p>

<P>Winstedt also included monochrome plates of some of the
illustrations from the Vatican manuscript (V).&nbsp; I have added these plates
as an appendix, after some hesitation, since the originals were probably made by
the author .&nbsp; All the manuscripts are magnificently illustrated.&nbsp;
Those in the Vatican Ms. are probably close copies of an antique original.&nbsp;
It is likely that Cosmas was his own artist, since some of them show subjects
unfamiliar to the average monastic copyist; at any rate, he must have directed
the execution.&nbsp; The first picture in V (f.12) has no connection with the
text, but shows an antelope between two banana trees.&nbsp; Native words for the
banana, and the mention of the little known port of Adulis, Gabaza, in the
picture on f.12v, all tend to suggest the involvement of the author.</p>

<P>I have added a translation of the summary of contents to the
front of McCrindle's translation.&nbsp; Wolska-Conus describes McCrindle's
version is being a little hasty, particularly in the theological portions, and a
little prone to force the text in the direction of the droll and amusing in
others.</p>

<blockquote>

<P><i>Manuscripts</i></p>

</blockquote>

<P>Three complete manuscripts exist:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <P>Rome: Vaticanus Graecus 699 (V).&nbsp; An uncial manuscript
    of the 9th century, written in Constantinople.&nbsp; It comprises 123 folios
    written in two columns, each of 32 lines except where miniatures appear.&nbsp; It contains only books 1-10, and as the index of
    books at the front is written in the same hand, and lists only 10, clearly
    it never had more.&nbsp; It omits the introductory prayer, first prologue,
    and start of the second prologue.&nbsp; Various leaves are missing.&nbsp;
    The manuscript is the best of them, but corrupt in point of copying
    accuracy.&nbsp; General production quality is top-class.&nbsp; Accents have been added by a subsequent corrector.&nbsp; The
    codex is illustrated 'magnificently'.</li>
  <li>
    <P>No. 1186 of the Greek Mss. of the Monastery of St. Catherine
    at Sinai (S).&nbsp; 11th century, 209 leaves, each of 30 lines, folio.&nbsp;
    Written in Cappadocia.&nbsp; Very correctly written and accented.&nbsp; It contained 12
    books, but the end is lacking.&nbsp; Commences with the first prologue, then
    the summary of 12 books, then the second prologue starting where V
    does.&nbsp; At the end of the 5th book (i.e. the end of the original work),
    it has a prayer not found in L.&nbsp; L and S are generally very closely
    related.&nbsp; It contains practically the same illustrations as L.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Florence: Laurentianus Plutei IX.28 (L).&nbsp; 11th century,
    written in minscule hand. 12 books.&nbsp; Written probably in the Iviron
    monastery on Mt. Athos.&nbsp; 279 folios, of 22 lines.&nbsp; Omits the summary of
    contents.&nbsp; Differs from V at the point where the two both begin, with
    an untranslatable sentence.&nbsp; A leaf or more is missing after fol. 104
    (Montfaucon 200D), which is absent also in V and S only partly contains the
    text, so a row of dots appears in the printed text.&nbsp; Since McCrindle
    had no access to S, at this point his text is incorrect.&nbsp; Illustrations
    are not so fine as those in V.&nbsp; Corrected throughout by another hand.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Phillips 2581.&nbsp; A paper copy of L, made 21 June
    1682. 326 pages, in quarto, paper.&nbsp; This was at Cheltenham when Winstedt wrote, but the Phillips
    collection is now dispersed. Winstedt had not seen it, however, but relied
    on a description by H. Omont.&nbsp; Wolska-Conus simply quotes Winstedt.</li>
</ul>
<P>Other partial manuscripts also exist, mainly containing
illustrations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <P>Paris Suppl. Gr. 844.&nbsp; 18th century.&nbsp; Contains
    only copies of some of the pictures in L.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Paris Gr. 2426 (P).&nbsp; 16th century.&nbsp; On ff. 112 ff,
    contains a copy of most of book 11, copied by Nicholas de la Torre, possibly
    from the archetype of Z although it contains more of this book than Z
    did.&nbsp; The text is handled freely, and seems to relate to the Smyrna
    manuscript.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Smyrna B-8 (Z).&nbsp; ca. 1100AD. Described by
    Papadopoulos-Kerameus in an 1877 catalogue.&nbsp; Selections appear on
    pp.156-192, under the name of Maximus (written over a shorter name which has
    been erased).&nbsp; Just a collection of pictures with short bits of text
    attached to it.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Vienna Theol. 9 (W).&nbsp; Selections.&nbsp; Bought in
    Constantinople by A. Busbeck.&nbsp; Copied from S, or more likely an Ms.
    similar to S.</li>
</ul>
<P>Finally a bunch of Mss. of the Psalter and Gospels are listed by
Winstedt, which prefix extracts from book 5 as catenae.&nbsp; These he describes
as all worthless, but he lists a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <P>Vat. Gr. 363 (R2).&nbsp; 10th century.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Oxford, Bodleian Library: Ms. Cromwell 15.&nbsp; 11th
    century.&nbsp; Bought on Mt. Athos in 1727.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Bodleian Arch. Selden 29.&nbsp; AD 1338.&nbsp; Fol. 116 has
    a catena on Luke, ascribed to <i>Cosmas Indicopleustes</i>.</li>
  <li>
    <P>[Others exist]</li>
</ul>
<P>There are also numerous Mss. which use a section from book 5 as
a catena on the Psalms, again of limited value:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <P>Vat. Gr. 342.&nbsp; 12th century.&nbsp; f. 7v.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Vat. Gr. 525.&nbsp; 12th century. f. 1.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Venice, Marcianus Gr. 498. 14th century. f. 270.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Bodleian, Baroc. 15.&nbsp; 12th century.&nbsp; f. 22.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Turin B. I. 10.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Milan, Ambrosian. B. 106.&nbsp; 10th century.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Moscow 358.&nbsp; 11th century.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Vat. Gr. 1747.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Paris Gr. 2743.&nbsp; Once Colbertinus 1476, 16th century,
    copied by J. Diassorinos.&nbsp; This is mentioned by Montfaucon, and also by
    Omont, both of whom lead the reader to suppose Cosmas was the author of a
    commentary on the Psalms preserved herein.&nbsp; In fact it contains only
    the usual chunk of book 5, followed by material from other authors.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Paris Gr. 169 (Mazarin-Reg. 3450).&nbsp; 14th century.&nbsp;
    A similar Ms., with the paragraph expanded by adding a following section
    from other authors.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Vallicellianus C. 4.&nbsp; 16th century.&nbsp; ff.
    434-5.&nbsp; Also with the expanded paragraph from book 5.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Paris Gr. 3179.&nbsp; 16th century. Copied by Bigot. Also
    with the expanded paragraph from book 5.</li>
  <li>
    <P>Vat. Gr. 711. fol. 196.</li>
</ul>

<P>The three main Mss. fall into two families: V and the
others.&nbsp; V has 10 books; S and L have 12.&nbsp; In V the paragraphs on the
major and minor prophets are in Septuagint order, as aso in the parallel passage
in the <i>Chronicon Paschale</i>; in S and L, they are disarranged&nbsp; into
the order of Theodore of Mopsuestia, as in McCrindle's translation.&nbsp;
Winstedt suggests this shows that Cosmas' literary executor added two books from
his papers, and 'corrected' the order into that favoured among Nestorians, and
perhaps added other notes at various points, found only in L and S. Cosmas wrote
his own notes, so supplementary paragraphs cannot be distinguished from the
original with ease.&nbsp; S cannot be a copy of L, and is more reliable as L has
been corrected by an educated man who corrected Cosmas' bad Greek at various
points.&nbsp; V is undoubtedly the best manuscript.</p>
