## PROLOGUE I.

FIRST of all I exhort those who will read this book to peruse it with
all attention and diligence, and not to run over it in a perfunctory
manner, but with loving pains to study it and take into their minds
impressions of the places, figures, and histories which it contains; and
when the book has been read to the end, let them further look into the
volume which we have composed for that lover of Christ, Constantinus: a
volume wherein we have described more fully the whole earth, both the
one beyond the ocean, and this one, and all its countries, together with
the southern parts from Alexandria to the Southern Ocean, namely, the
river Nile and the countries adjacent, and all the races of Egypt and
Ethiopia; the Arabian Gulf besides, with the countries adjoining and
their inhabitants as far as the same ocean, and likewise the middle
country between the river and the gulf, with the cities, districts and
tribes therein contained----a volume [<sup>2</sup>](#2.md) to prove that
what things are said by us are true, and those false which are said by
our adversaries, \[114\] for whose sake this book and the drawings
[<sup>3</sup>](#3.md) it contains have been prepared----those, I mean,
concerning the size of the sun, and that sun-burnt, uninhabited part of
the world about which they din our ears, and vomit out fictions and
fables. Let me next exhort my readers to examine the sketch
[<sup>4</sup>](#4.md) of the universe and the stellar motions which we have
prepared as a representation of <span id="p3">\|3</span> the organic
sphere of the pagans [<sup>5</sup>](#5.md), and to study the account of it
sent to the pious deacon Homologus, then they with God's help are quite
competent, especially with this book and the volume mentioned, to
overthrow from the foundation the error of the pagan [<sup>6</sup>](#6.md)
theories. For if any Christian possesses these three works, and is by
divine grace carefully exercised in the divine scriptures, he will
easily confute the foolish views of the fable-mongers, for, from the
figure itself, the constitution of the world and the very nature of
things, they prove that the divine scriptures and the doctrines preached
by Christians are perfectly true. Be strong then, ye Christians, in the
Lord.

 

## PROLOGUE II.

*The Christian Topography of the whole world demonstrated from divine
scripture, about which Christians ought not to doubt.*

IN days long gone by I hesitated, O God-beloved, God-loving and
Christ-loving [<sup>7</sup>](#7.md) Pamphilus, to take in hand the treatise
descriptive of the constitution of the whole world which you enjoined me
to draw up. For even had I so wished, it was out of my power, as you
well know, on account of the lingering illness by which I was
prostrated. <span id="p4">\|4</span> But since, in answer to your
frequent prayers, I have recovered from that illness, accept at last the
Preface to the books of the work which I submit, partly as fulfilling
the obedience I owe you, and partly as dreading the condemnation of the
sluggish servant which the discourse of our Saviour in the Gospels has
pronounced. And let no one condemn me as overbold, because I conduct the
exposition of my subject in a style homely and unmethodical, since it is
not fine phrases the Christian requires but right notions. For while
many be the darts and helmets and shields and wars set in motion against
the Church, some supposed to be Christians, holding divine scripture of
no account but despising and looking down upon it, assume like the Pagan
philosophers, that the form of the heavens is spherical, being led into
this error by the solar and lunar eclipses.[<sup>8</sup>](#8.md) We have
therefore conveniently divided the subject of the book into five parts.
In the outset then the first part is directed against the persons
referred to who have been misled, and argues that one who wishes to
profess Christianity cannot be led away by the plausible \[115\] errors
of those outside the Church----errors which are opposed to divine
scripture. For should any one choose to examine closely the Pagan
theories he will find them to be entirely fictitious, fabulous
sophistries, and to be utterly impossible. Then again, for the Christian
who will naturally ask and say: these being refuted, what are the true
theories that must be admitted in opposition to them? I have written the
second book, which proceeds to explain from divine scripture the nature
of the Christian theories----to describe the figure of the whole world,
and to notice that some of the ancient Pagans have been of the same
opinion. Then again, by way of replying to one <span id="p5">\|5</span>
who should doubt and ask: how does it appear that Moses and the prophets
in saying such things say what is true? the third book exhibits the
credibility of Moses and the Prophets, showing that they spake not of
themselves, but as inspired by divine revelation, and that the writers
alike of the Old and New Testament, men approved both by word and deed,
having foreseen these things, declared them accordingly. It further
shows what is the utility of delineations of the world, and how the
notion of the sphere had its origin and beginning. The fourth book,
again, has been written for behoof of those who wish to run their eye
over the figures, and is a brief recapitulation, along with
delineations, of what has been said before----a refutation, in fact, of
the theory of the sphere and of the Antipodes. Then again, the fifth
book has been written for those enquiring what the Christian theories
are, and it shows that in what we have said and have represented by
drawings we have neither devised fictions of our own nor invented new
fables; but from revelation and from what God who created the world has
ordained, have beheld the pattern of the whole world----namely the
Tabernacle prepared by Moses, which the New Testament consistently with
this view has pronounced to be an image of the whole world; and which
also by means of the vail Moses divided, and so made one tabernacle into
two, just as God also in the beginning divided what was one region,
extending from the earth to the highest heaven, into two regions, by
means of the firmament; and just as in the tabernacle there was an outer
and an inner place, so here there was a lower and an upper. Now the
lower is this world, and the upper is the world to come, into which also
the Lord Christ, after having risen according to the flesh from the
dead, ascended the first of all, and into which the righteous shall in
their turn afterwards ascend. And since from Adam to Moses, and from
Moses to John, and from John all the Apostles <span id="p6">\|6</span>
and Evangelists, have each and all in harmony, and both by words and
types spoken of these two states; and since not one of them has uttered
a discordant note, either saying that there was a state before the
first, or supposing that there is a third after the second; but all of
them, as if inspired by the Holy Ghost, have proclaimed that there are
\[116\] but two states only, we, therefore, putting our confidence in
the scriptures, which are truly divine, have not only sketched the
figures of the whole world, but also of those very places by which you
will find the Israelites made their exodus, also the mountain on which
they received the law in writing, and were instructed in the knowledge
of writing; also the delineation of the Tabernacle and the settlement in
the Land of Promise; until he who was expected to arise from among them,
and who was predicted by all the men of old and by the Prophets, did
actually appear, proclaiming the future second state, which on his
coming he showed in himself to us all, having entered into the inner
Tabernacle, into the upper celestial region, into which at his second
coming he shall call the righteous, saying: *Come, ye blessed of my
Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the
world.* To Him be glory for ever, Amen! <span id="p7">\|7</span> 

<span id="img_cosmas1-4"></span> ![](img/cosmas1-4.jpg)

# BOOK I OF COSMAS, A MONK.[<sup>9</sup>](#9.md)

*Against those who, while wishing to profess Christianity, think and
imagine like the pagans that the heaven is spherical.*

<span id="img_cosmas1-5"></span> ![](img/cosmas1-5.jpg)S many as
ardently desire true knowledge and are lovers of the true light, and
earnestly endeavour to become fellow-citizens of the saints in the age
to come, who regard the Old and New Testament as in reality divine
scripture, who are obedient to Moses and the Christ, who follow out to
the end the principles they have adopted, who acknowledge <span
id="p8">\|8</span> that the world was produced by God out of mere
nothing, and who believe that there is a resurrection of men and a
judgment, and that the righteous shall inherit the Kingdom of Heaven;
all these carefully examine the divine scriptures all throughout, to see
whether in Moses, who wrote the account of the Creation, and in the
other Prophets, they <span id="p9">\|9</span> contain descriptions of
the places and figures of the whole creation, among which is indicated
also the position of the Kingdom of Heaven, which the Lord Christ
promises God will give to righteous men. And when they find the Old and
New Testaments to be in mutual harmony, they abide therein firmly
grounded and immovable, in nothing confounded by their adversaries. But
those on the other hand who prank themselves out in the wisdom of this
world, and are self-confident that by scholastic reasonings they can
comprehend its figure and position, scoff at all divine scripture as a
mass of fables, stigmatising Moses and the prophets, the Lord Christ and
the Apostles as idle babblers,[<sup>10</sup>](#10.md) \[117\] and given
over to vain delusions; while with supercilious airs, as if they far
surpassed in wisdom the rest of mankind, they attribute to the heavens a
spherical figure and a circular motion, and by geometrical methods and
calculations applied to the heavenly bodies, as well as by the abuse of
words and by worldly craft, endeavour to grasp the position and figure
of the world by means of the solar and lunar eclipses, leading others
into error while they are in error themselves in maintaining that such
phenomena could not present themselves if the figure was other than
spherical. But concerning these matters we shall not enter into any
discussion just at present, since those persons sufficiently confute the
one the other. But those who wish to profess Christianity, while wishing
at the same time to <span id="p10">\|10</span> bedeck themselves with
the principles, the wisdom, and the diversity of the errors of this
world, and contend that one thing and another should be accepted, seem
to differ nothing from a shadow which exists while the intermediate body
from which it is projected is in light, but which cannot exist when that
body is not in light, nay, is even obliterated by the light when the
body is illuminated all round.

It is against such men my words are directed, for divine scripture
denounces them, as of old it denounced the strangers sojourning in
Samaria, because they feared God and burned incense and offered worship
on the high places.<sup>[<sup>11</sup>](#11.md)</sup> Were one to call such
men double-faced[<sup>12</sup>](#12.md) he would not be wrong, for, look
you, they wish both to be with us and with those that are against us,
thus making void their renunciation of Satan whom they renounced in
baptism, and again running back to him. Now, such men cannot be with us
at all; but they occupy a middle position, like empty houses standing
high up in the air, without having either foundations in the earth
below, or anything from above to hold them fast.[<sup>13</sup>](#13.md) For
while they have as yet scarcely come by their principles they set about
destroying them; and before they have yet destroyed them, they show that
their end is unaccomplished, as they stand firm neither on the one side
nor the other, but rather laugh at every one, and are themselves laughed
at by all. In the first place, then, when arguing with them about the
spherical figure, we showed that this figure was not possible, and was
indeed quite inconsistent with the nature of things. Certain of them say
that the heaven is a body consisting of four
elements,[<sup>14</sup>](#14.md) but some later on superciliously <span
id="p11">\|11</span>  reconstructed it with an additional fifth new
element,[<sup>15</sup>](#15.md) though formerly its essential constitution
comprised only four elements, for they saw at a glance that the heaven
could not revolve if it was composed of these. But herein again they are
found to be blind even when they think that those who are sharp-sighted
do not see. For since the heaven is seen to be of sundry and diverse
colours, whence a power to produce heat and cold seems to be inherent in
them, they say that the eyes of all are deceived by reason of their
immense distance. Well, then, let any one of them who so wishes come
forward and tell us: Why do the stars which, according to you are
evidently fixed in an immovable sphere, not \[118\] apparently differ in
colour and size, though their distances from us are seen to be unequal,
if the centre of the earth be the point from which our eyes are directed
towards them? And how is it that many of the fixed stars are equal and
like to the planet we call Mars, to which a lower sphere has been
assigned, and how do we in like manner see not a few of them to be like
the planet Jupiter? But <span id="p12">\|12</span> further, we do not
even see the heaven itself to be of one and the same colour, for, if it
were asked from whence can we surmise that the cloud-like concretions
which you have named the galaxy, and which you have so designated simply
because of the difference of their colour, have derived their peculiar
appearance, while the surface on which the ray of vision strikes is
uniform? and if I replied that these were proofs of the composition and
mixture of different elements, no one, I apprehend, would dare to
contradict me, even though he were a lover of falsehood, and much less
if one of those who always assign the foremost place to truth. Now if
the heaven has been constituted not of one single element endowed with a
circular motion of its own, but of the mixture of the four elements,
then it cannot well revolve. For it has been said that it must either be
moved downward if the heavy element preponderate, or be carried upward
if the opposite light one prevail, or must be stationary when no element
is preponderant. This is certainly obvious to everybody. For no one
would admit that he has ever seen the heaven move either upwards or
downwards.[<sup>16</sup>](#16.md) It must be allowed therefore that it is
firmly fixed. But should they ask: Whence are these motions that differ
from the rest in an element that is simple and without qualities? since
they say, and not untruly, that those bodies which they call planets
revolve oppositely to the universe; and if in like manner they say that
their revolution is accomplished in certain <span id="p13">\|13</span>
times which the Creator has fixed, it is evident that they do not even
deny that the planets advance from the East.[<sup>17</sup>](#17.md)

Then being mazed with perplexing doubts, as usually happens to those who
shrink from the truth, they say, on finding no way of escape, that the
stars make retrogressions and pauses. But tell me, ye souls that are so
ingenious in tying and untying knots, if from their very nature they
have motion, how comes it that they stand still? For nothing that can
thwart them enters as an element into their natural constitution. And
tell me this besides, what is the force or what the necessity which
imposes on them the contrary motion? And here let no one tell me that it
is an ocular deception; for it is no minute distance to which they
advance, seeing that they are often observed to shift their place from a
sign of the zodiac that is in the rear to one in front. But what must we
say of our opponents when passing on to the operations of the stars
themselves, they reach the very height of absurdity, all unconscious
that they themselves stand still or move backward, and are but a sorry
set of good-for-nothing rascals? Now anyone would say that the star
previously seen in Aries, but at present appearing in Pisces, was not in
the house of Mars, but in that of Jupiter, and that it \[119\] makes
*movements,* not such as they babble about when it is in Aries, but
those which they ascribe to it in its transit through Pisces. But if
they do not admit the retrograde motion *of the planets* which is
apparent, whence then or wherefore is their course in both directions?
They will perhaps in reply assign as the cause those invisible epicycles
which they have assumed as vehicles on which, as they will insist, the
planets are borne along. But they will <span id="p14">\|14</span> be in
no better case from this invention, for we shall ask: Why have they need
of vehicles? Is it because they are incapable of motion? Then, if so,
why should you assert them to be animated, and that too even with souls
more than usually divine? Or is it that they are capable? The very idea
is, methinks, ridiculous. And why have not the moon and the sun their
epicycles? Is it that they are not worthy on account of their
inferiority? But this could not be said by men in their sober senses.
Was it then from the scarcity of suitable material the Creator could not
construct vehicles for them? On your own head let the blasphemy of such
a thought recoil.

Cease, O ye wiseacres! prating worthless nonsense, and learn at last
though late to follow the divine oracles and not your own baseless
fancies. For, tell us, how ye think that the fixed stars move in an
opposite direction to the universe? Is such a motion theirs only or that
of the sphere in which they are placed? Then, if it is theirs, how do
they traverse unequal orbits in equal time? And how comes it that of the
stars in the galaxy not one has ever gone outside of it, nor any of
those outside is seen nearer it or within it? But if one should say that
it is the sphere which moves in the opposite direction, then it will be
found that at the same time it moves oppositely to itself. But who can
imagine a greater absurdity than this? Thus they do their best to
prevent anyone surpassing them in their effrontery----or rather, let me
say, in impiety, since they do not blush to affirm that there are people
who live on the under surface of the earth. What then, should some one
question them and say: Is the sun to no purpose carried under the earth?
these absurd persons will, on the spur of the moment, without thinking,
reply that the people of the Antipodes are there----men carrying their
heads downwards, and rivers having a position opposite to the rivers
here! thus taking in hand to turn every thing <span id="p15">\|15</span>
upside down rather than to follow the doctrines of the truth, in which
there are no futile sophisms, but which are plain and easy and full of
godliness, while they procure salvation for those who reverently consult
them.

But you will most effectually rebuke them if you say: Why does that
sphere of yours not revolve from the north to the south, or from some
other quarter to its opposite? And do not tell me, in answer, that such
seemed better to the Maker of the world, for my [<sup>18</sup>](#18.md)
.... But how can you \[120\] deem that you speak consistently with the
nature of things in supposing that the whole heaven is in motion and
describes a circle, without also supposing that outside of it there is
either some other space or body, even though it were imaginary. For it
is impossible any thing can move apart from the four elements, but must
move either in earth, or in water, or in air, or in fire, whether it is
transferred from place to place into the infinite, or whether it always
revolves in the same place. But if the heaven as it revolves passes into
the infinity of space, we must suppose that beyond it there is an
infinite earth into which it rolls, when noiselessly leaving what is
behind it; but if one of the other three elements be supposed, in not
one of them is the sphere adapted to roll and rotate; nay, were it to be
shot into any of them, a whizzing noise would attend the transition. But
if, again, it rolls and rotates always in the same spot without moving
from place to place, then it must be upheld by supports like a turner's
lathe, or an artificial globe, or on an axis like a machine or a waggon.
And if so, then we must again inquire by what the supports and axles are
themselves upheld, and so on *ad infinitum.* And tell me, pray, how are
we to suppose the axis passes through the middle of the earth, and of
what material it consists.

When these problems then concerning the nature of <span
id="p16">\|16</span> things are discussed, there remains the conclusion,
as we said before, that the heaven is fixed and does not revolve. But
even in supposing that the earth is in the middle of the universe, as
its centre, you immediately give the deathblow to your own theory when
you repeat that the middle is below, for it is impossible that the same
thing can at once both be in the middle and below, for the middle is the
middle between up and down, or between right and left, or between before
and behind. Why do you then, when beleaguered with difficulties, utter
absurdities contrary to nature, in opposition to scripture? For being in
terror lest any one should pose you with this question: How can this
unspeakable weight of the earth be held suspended by the air and not
fall down? you have invented stones of things that are not true, but
strange; and, reversing the order of things, give out that the middle is
below; so that if any should suppose that instead of the earth, fire was
the middle, you would then say that the middle was above instead of
below, seeing that the tendency of fire is upward. To me, therefore,
they seem to subvert the first by means of the second, and the second by
means of the first. But if they say that the air because it surrounds
the earth equally on all sides, is pushed on by the universe, and that
the earth remains immovable, and swerves neither to the one side nor the
other, why do men [<sup>19</sup>](#19.md) and the irrational animals that
live on land or fly in the air not move along with it, while all of them
cleave the air in walking and in traversing it, and in going on high.
And not only is it incapable of resisting these, but it cannot even
sustain the weight of the lightest inanimate things, such as the
shortest of feathers and the smallest of straws, but all of them cut it,
it is so attenuated and so rare, and they outstrip it according to the
force with which they are propelled. How then can we receive such false
theories? <span id="p17">\|17</span> 

But should one wish to examine more elaborately the question of the
Antipodes, he would easily find them to be old wives' fables. For if two
men on opposite sides placed the soles of their feet each against each,
whether they chose to stand on earth, or water, or air, or fire, or any
other kind of body, how could both be found standing upright? The one
would assuredly be found in the natural upright position, and the other,
contrary to nature, head downward.[<sup>20</sup>](#20.md) Such notions are
opposed to reason, and alien to our nature and condition. And how,
again, when it rains upon both of them, is it possible to say that the
rain falls down upon the two, and not that it falls down to the one and
falls up to the other, or falls against them, or towards them, or away
from them. For to think that there are Antipodes compels us to think
also that rain falls on them from an opposite direction to ours; and any
one will, with good reason, deride these ludicrous theories, which set
forth principles incongruous, ill-adjusted, and contrary to nature.

And if one should examine that other sophism of theirs, namely, that the
earth is inflated with air, and that earthquakes occur when the pent-up
air shakes the earth violently, he would be amazed at the imposture and
the contradiction in their statements. For if the earth when equally
pressed by the whole air stands unshaken and unswerving, then, when
inflated it ought to be all the heavier in that quarter, and to swerve
to a side, after the example of man which they adduce. For not only does
a man shake and tremble when attacked with <span id="p18">\|18</span>
flatulency, but he trembles when seized with terror, and when overcome
with wine, and pinched with cold, and when his blood boils with anger,
and when he is old and imbecile, but when he reels under the effects of
flatulency death results. Why then does not the earth also, which
according to them is inflated with air, not collapse and lose its proper
place? And why, again, do they further say that Egypt, because its soil
is porous and its furrows allow the air to escape without violent
shocks, is not subject to earthquakes, while in point of fact
earthquakes have been of frequent occurrence in that country, and so
violent as to overthrow cities and level them with the ground: and not
only so, but even in the times of the Greeks, when Alexander, and
Seleucus, and Antiochus, and Ptolemy ruled and reigned, they had
recourse to the assistance of philosophers----Aristotle and his
like----and frequently gave practical effect to what they advised? And
when Antioch was being founded by Seleucus [<sup>21</sup>](#21.md) and
Antiochus, how was it that the philosophers were not able to point out
that the country there was not safe from earthquakes, but on the \[122\]
contrary exposed to their frequent visitations? And this we say from
having seen that this city has been repeatedly overthrown by
earthquakes; and not Antioch only but Corinth also, which has close at
her hand the mob of the philosophers.

But if we should care to examine yet another of their opinions----that
in which they say and try to prove by illustrations----that rain is
produced from vapour drawn up <span id="p19">\|19</span> by heat into
the atmosphere, in the same way, say they, as the bath draws up vapour
from the heat, and lets it fall in drops; and just as a cupping-glass
draws up moisture by means of tow and fire, so too does the sun draw up
vapour, and in course of time lets it fall in drops, whence rain is
produced. One cannot but marvel at such wisdom as this, imposing, as it
does by its speciousness, upon the multitude. For since the bath derives
its heat not from above but from below, how can it be said to draw up,
and npt rather to push up? So too in the case of a caldron: it receives
its heat not from above but from below, and in both instances the
vapours are pushed up by the heat, and in the rebound, due in the one
case to the roof and in the other to the lid, they fall in drops.
Similar is the case of the cupping-glass, which, did not this instrument
itself constrain nature and suck up moisture, would never have sucked it
up at all,[<sup>22</sup>](#22.md) no, not even if fire and tow had been
applied ten thousand times over. But further, when one thrusts a damp
faggot into the fire, moisture is to such a degree pushed by the heat
that both moisture and smoke are expelled from the other end of the
faggot. And when one has kindled a fire on the ground he sees the
moisture in the faggots conveyed upwards by the smoke, not drawn up by
what is above but pushed up by the heat of the fire. Nay, more, if one
washes a garment and spreads it on the ground, and if, when it has been
dried by the sun, he lifts it up, he will find the moisture which has
been expelled from it by the heat impressed on the ground in the very
<span id="p20">\|20</span> shape of the garment. In like manner, if one
places a hot piece of meat on a trencher he will see the moisture
discharged in both directions, both upwards and downwards, the heat
being intermediate, for above he sees the steam mounting upwards, and
below he sees the trencher bathed in moisture on which the meat has
impressed its own shape; whence it appears that heat does not draw up,
as these sages tell us, but rather pushes up.

But when we propose a new question to them: Why is it that in the
Thebaid, where the ground is parched up by the heat, the moisture is not
drawn up and turned into rain for that country? they defend themselves
by saying that it is a moderate and not an excessive heat that causes
the drawing up. To this we shall give a very summary reply: And how
happens it, we shall ask, that beyond the Thebaid, in Ethiopia, where
the heat is far greater, there are frequent copious downfalls of rain?
And how can they say, those many and tip-top wise men, that the sun has
the power of drawing upwards, and assert also quite confidently that in
the course of his revolution he becomes heated by friction, while they
will not entertain the supposition that the heat is in him by nature.
But more: when they allow that the air is moist and hot, what need have
\[123\] those wiseacres to resort to sophistry and say that the moisture
is drawn up from elsewhere, when up above they have the heat and
moisture at the same spot? But if one should ask them about one
particular element as it is in itself, that is, should ask them to show
its distinctive quality, they immediately find themselves at a loss, and
attribute two qualities to one single element and say: Earth is *dry and
cold;* water, *cold and moist;* air, *moist and warm;* fire, *warm and
dry;* so that, being beleaguered with difficulties, they assign eight
qualities to the four elements. But at times they say that all the
qualities exist in each of the elements. Once more, therefore, they
<span id="p21">\|21</span> contradict their own words, by ascribing not
four but only two qualities to each of the four elements. I marvel
accordingly at those most excellent men when they attribute to water
*coldness and humidity,* and to the air *humidity and heat.* How do they
say that water, that is, the *cold and moist,* congeals and becomes ice
in winter-time? Wherefrom comes that extreme cold which converts it into
ice? For if they shall say that the departure of the sun naturally
produces this effect, why does it not produce the same effect on the
air, which is naturally *warm,* and at the same time *moist,* but makes
it, on the contrary, extremely *cold?* And how does *the cold*
itself----that is, water----not make the air----that is, *the
moist*----freeze, but, on the contrary, it is the latter which makes the
former freeze, as we actually see? Now though I have many things more to
say about this question and the examples which they erroneously adduce
in favour of their view of it, I curb myself, for I feel ashamed of the
foolishness of what is said by them, and consider what has already been
said on this subject sufficient.

There is, however, another sophism held by these wise men which I am
especially anxious to deal with, and will forthwith proceed to discuss.
They say that the heaven which they call a body contains the whole
world, and stoutly maintain that outside of it nothing whatever exists;
and yet they define angels and demons and souls, which are parts of the
world as uncircumscribed, neither containing the heaven, nor contained
by the heaven, not understanding what they say, since that which neither
contains nor is contained is never by any possibility seen among things
that are. If then these things be as they say, let them tell us with
respect to their own soul whether it is, or is not. And if they say it
is not, then to their own shame and disgrace they assume themselves to
be soulless. But if they say that it exists, let them tell us whether it
is <span id="p22">\|22</span> in them or is not in them. If they reply
that it is not in them, they answer not less shamelessly and foolishly
than they did before. But if they reply that the soul is in them, we
must ask them a further question: As the body is circumscribed by the
heaven, why is not the soul also circumscribed? And if, as they say, it
illuminates the body without being circumscribed along with it, the
question arises, where is it when it illuminates the body? since it is
impossible that, being a created thing, it should not exist with things
created. And if they say it exists somewhere \[124\] within the heaven,
then it is again circumscribed by the body itself of the heaven,
although it was represented by them as uncircumscribed. But if they make
it exist outside the heaven, they, in the first place, confute
themselves; in the next place, it will either be in a part of the heaven
and occupy but a small part of it, or it will be in the whole of it, in
which case it will circumscribe the heaven and will be found having form
like a bodily substance; and this a spherical form embracing and
limiting the sphere. But if, again, they say that as being
uncircumscribed it pervades all things both within and without, let them
not blind themselves to the fact that they arc both introducing
polytheism and imagining an equality with God. For this property
pertains to none except the uncreated Deity who created and fashioned
the universe. So then, professing themselves to be wise, they become
fools, as says the blessed Paul the Apostle, having changed the glory of
the uncircumscribed Deity to their own created souls, thus appropriating
to themselves the glory due to God. They must therefore in every way be
avoided. For, saith the Apostle, from those turn away who hold an
outward form of godliness but deny the power thereof.

<span id="#9"></span>9. <sup>1</sup> To this title Cosmas has prefixed
the following: "The notes (παραγραφαὶ) which occur in this work have
been inserted for the clearer exposition of the text (του̃ κειμένου). The
reader should therefore read first the text and then the notes." As
Cosmas in this book seeks to confute the system of astronomy called the
Ptolemaic----because Ptolemy, though not its founder, was its chief
exponent----it may be of service if we remind the reader of the main
outlines of that system. It assumed that the earth was the Centre of the
universe, and that the heavenly bodies revolved round it in perfect
circles and at a uniform rate of motion. Such phenomena as were found to
be inconsistent with these assumptions were explained by means of
subsidiary hypotheses. The belief that the earth was the centre of the
universe seemed to accord with the relation in which the primary
elements of which the material world was thought to be composed stood to
each other. Thus *earth,* as being the stablest element, held the lowest
place and supported *water,* above which was placed *air,* and above
that again, *fire,* while *ether* was supposed to extend indefinitely
above the others. In or beyond the ether were certain heavens, each of
which contained a crystalline sphere, whereto was attached a heavenly
body, which by the revolution of its crystalline sphere was made to move
round the earth. When it was discovered that the planets move sometimes
from west to east, sometimes from east to west, and for some time remain
stationary at the point where progression ends and retrogression begins,
the ancient astronomers were greatly puzzled, and to account for these
irregularities in the planetary movements invented the hypothesis of
epicycles. This doctrine is explained as follows in the article on the
Ptolemaic System of Astronomy in Chambers's *Encyclopaedia:* " The
acceleration of the sun on one side, and retardation on the other side
of his orbit, is only apparent, and results from the earth not being in
the centre of his sphere, c (see fig.), but at E, and consequently his
motion appears to be slowest at P and quickest at R.  

<span id="img_cosmas1-6"></span> ![](img/cosmas1-6.jpg)

"The alternate progression and regression of the planets was accounted
for by supposing them to move, not directly with their crystallines, but
in a small circle whose centre was a fixed point in the crystalline, and
which revolved on its axis as it was carried round with the latter; thus
(fig.) the planet was carried round the small circle A B D, as that
circle was carried round P Q R (now supposed to represent the planetary
crystalline). The planet, while in the outer portion of its small
circle, would thus have a forward and in the inner portion a backward
motion. The larger circle was called an *eccentric* and the smaller an
*epicycle*"

<span id="#10"></span>10. <sup>1</sup> Gr. σπερμολόγους*.* "The word",
says Dr. Bloomfield in his annotated edition of the Greek New Testament,
"was used properly of those small birds which live by picking up
scattered seeds; but metaphorically of those *paupers* who frequented
the market-places, and lived by picking up any scattered or refuse
produce; and generally of *persons of abject condition,* without any
certain means of support. Again, as the tribes of small birds which live
by picking up seeds are especially garrulous, the word came to denote a
*prater*." Though Cosmas here uses the word in its metaphorical sense,
he once or twice afterwards uses it in the literal sense of *a picker-up
of seeds.*

<span id="#15"></span>15. <sup>1</sup> Aristotle invented a term,
ἐντελέχεια , to denote *actuality* of existence in contrast to its mere
potentiality, δύναμις. His followers, however, eventually came to use
the term in the sense of a *fifth element,* namely *mind,* which
differed entirely in its nature from the four elements of common speech.
To this effect I may quote the words of Cicero: "Dicaearchus ....
quemdam Phthiotam senem .... disserentem inducit, nihil esse omnino
animum et hoc esse nomen totum inane .... Aristoteles .... quum quattuor
nota illa genera principiorum esset complexus, e quibus omnia orerentur,
quintam quamclam naturam censet esse, e qua sit mens. Cogitare enim et
providere et discere .... haec et similia eorum in horum quattuor
generum inesse nullo putat: quintum genus adhibet vacans nomine et sic
ipsum animum ἐνδελέχειαν appellat novo nomine quasi quamdam continuatam
motionem et perennem." (*Tusc. Disp.,* i, 21, 22). Cicero has here
confounded ἐντελέχεια with ἐνδελέχειαν, of which he has given the
meaning correctly. Probably he had not seen the word in the written
pages of Aristotle, but only heard it from the lips of Greek
Peripatetics, who, like their countrymen of the present day, pronounced
the letter ταυ̃ very like δέλτα.

<span id="#16"></span>16. <sup>1</sup> The Greek text, so far as I can
see, must be wrongly punctuated. Οὐδὲ γὰρ ἄνω φερόμενον, οὐδὲ κάτω, τίς
ὁμολογήσειεν ἑωρακέναι πώποτε? I remove the mark of interrogation and
construe the negative with τις, and not with φερόμενον*.* The Latin
version, however, follows the punctuation: Quis autem dicat se vidisse
coelum nec sursum nec deorsum ferri? This rendering is inconsistent with
the immediately subsequent context, where the author states his own view
that the heaven is immoveable.

<span id="#17"></span>17. <sup>1</sup> This sentence ends with a clause
which cannot be construed with it, but which might serve to begin the
next paragraph. The clause is: ̓Ουράνιον τε ποιούμενοι πορείαν = Then
when making (*i.e.* tracing) the course *of the planets* through heaven.

<span id="#18"></span>18. <sup>1</sup> The hiatus has after it ἐσθαι
φθεγγόμενος.

<span id="#19"></span>19. <sup>1</sup> The text has ἀνθρώπους, an
evident mistake for ἄνθρωποι*.*

<span id="#20"></span>20. <sup>1</sup> See Cicero, *Acad. Prior.,* 2,
39, and Plutarch, 2, 869 c., on Antipodes. Nearly all the Christian
Fathers held the same opinion as Cosmas abput the Antipodes; as, for
instance, Lactantius, who asks: "Est quisqam tam ineptus qui credat esse
homines, quorum vestigia sint superiora quam capita?" Augustin,
Chrysostom, Severianus of Gabala, Beda, were likewise anti-Antipodeans.

<span id="#21"></span>21. <sup>1</sup> Antioch on the Orontes was
founded by Seleucus Nicator in 300 B.C. Its first recorded earthquake
occurred in 148 B.C., and it has frequently suffered since from the same
cause. The one to which Cosmas here refers occurred in 526 A. D., and
almost entirely destroyed the city, which, however, Justinian had
rebuilt with great splendour before it was captured by Chosroes in 540
A.D. Corinth also suffered severely from this memorable earthquake.

<span id="#22"></span>22. <sup>1</sup> Gr. σικύα, which means both a
*cucumber* and a *cupping-glass.* Montfaucon renders the word by the
Latin *cucumis,* which means a *cucumber* but not a *cupping-glass.* Can
he have used it in mistake for *cucurbita?* Charton does not give this
illustration, though he gives the two which precede it. The argument is
that it is the instrument ( ὄργανον, *i.e.,* the cupping-glass), which
draws up the blood to the punctures, and not the heat from the wick
burning inside the glass to produce a vacuum. There is an ambiguity in
the statement of the argument.
