### CHAPTER XIV.

#### BUT ARCTICS CAN BE INHOSPITABLE, TOO

Stapi is a village consisting of about thirty huts, built of lava, at
the south side of the base of the volcano. It extends along the inner
edge of a small fiord, inclosed between basaltic walls of the strangest
construction.

Basalt is a brownish rock of igneous origin. It assumes regular forms,
the arrangement of which is often very surprising. Here nature had done
her work geometrically, with square and compass and plummet. Everywhere
else her art consists alone in throwing down huge masses together in
disorder. You see cones imperfectly formed, irregular pyramids, with a
fantastic disarrangement of lines; but here, as if to exhibit an example
of regularity, though in advance of the very earliest architects, she
has created a severely simple order of architecture, never surpassed
either by the splendours of Babylon or the wonders of Greece.

I had heard of the Giant's Causeway in Ireland, and Fingal's Cave in
Staffa, one of the Hebrides; but I had never yet seen a basaltic
formation.

At Stapi I beheld this phenomenon in all its beauty.

The wall that confined the fiord, like all the coast of the peninsula,
was composed of a series of vertical columns thirty feet high. These
straight shafts, of fair proportions, supported an architrave of
horizontal slabs, the overhanging portion of which formed a semi-arch
over the sea. At. intervals, under this natural shelter, there spread
out vaulted entrances in beautiful curves, into which the waves came
dashing with foam and spray. A few shafts of basalt, torn from their
hold by the fury of tempests, lay along the soil like remains of an
ancient temple, in ruins for ever fresh, and over which centuries passed
without leaving a trace of age upon them.

This was our last stage upon the earth. Hans had exhibited great
intelligence, and it gave me some little comfort to think then that he
was not going to leave us.

On arriving at the door of the rector's house, which was not different
from the others, I saw a man shoeing a horse, hammer in hand, and with a
leathern apron on.

"*Sællvertu*," said the hunter.

"*God dag*," said the blacksmith in good Danish.

"*Kyrkoherde*," said Hans, turning round to my uncle.

"The rector," repeated the Professor. "It seems, Axel, that this good
man is the rector."

Our guide in the meanwhile was making the 'kyrkoherde' aware of the
position of things; when the latter, suspending his labours for a
moment, uttered a sound no doubt understood between horses and farriers,
and immediately a tall and ugly hag appeared from the hut. She must have
been six feet at the least. I was in great alarm lest she should treat
me to the Icelandic kiss; but there was no occasion to fear, nor did she
do the honours at all too gracefully.

The visitors' room seemed to me the worst in the whole cabin. It was
close, dirty, and evil smelling. But we had to be content. The rector
did not to go in for antique hospitality. Very far from it. Before the
day was over I saw that we had to do with a blacksmith, a fisherman, a
hunter, a joiner, but not at all with a minister of the Gospel. To be
sure, it was a week-day; perhaps on a Sunday he made amends.

I don't mean to say anything against these poor priests, who after all
are very wretched. They receive from the Danish Government a
ridiculously small pittance, and they get from the parish the fourth
part of the tithe, which does not come to sixty marks a year (about £4).
Hence the necessity to work for their livelihood; but after fishing,
hunting, and shoeing horses for any length of time, one soon gets into
the ways and manners of fishermen, hunters, and farriers, and other
rather rude and uncultivated people; and that evening I found out that
temperance was not among the virtues that distinguished my host.

My uncle soon discovered what sort of a man he had to do with; instead
of a good and learned man he found a rude and coarse peasant. He
therefore resolved to commence the grand expedition at once, and to
leave this inhospitable parsonage. He cared nothing about fatigue, and
resolved to spend some days upon the mountain.

The preparations for our departure were therefore made the very day
after our arrival at Stapi. Hans hired the services of three Icelanders
to do the duty of the horses in the transport of the burdens; but as
soon as we had arrived at the crater these natives were to turn back and
leave us to our own devices. This was to be clearly understood.

My uncle now took the opportunity to explain to Hans that it was his
intention to explore the interior of the volcano to its farthest limits.

Hans merely nodded. There or elsewhere, down in the bowels of the earth,
or anywhere on the surface, all was alike to him. For my own part the
incidents of the journey had hitherto kept me amused, and made me
forgetful of coming evils; but now my fears again were beginning to get
the better of me. But what could I do? The place to resist the Professor
would have been Hamburg, not the foot of Snæfell.

One thought, above all others, harassed and alarmed me; it was one
calculated to shake firmer nerves than mine.

Now, thought I, here we are, about to climb Snæfell. Very good. We will
explore the crater. Very good, too, others have done as much without
dying for it. But that is not all. If there is a way to penetrate into
the very bowels of the island, if that ill-advised Saknussemm has told a
true tale, we shall lose our way amidst the deep subterranean passages
of this volcano. Now, there is no proof that Snæfell is extinct. Who can
assure us that an eruption is not brewing at this very moment? Does it
follow that because the monster has slept since 1229 he must therefore
never awake again? And if he wakes up presently, where shall we be?

It was worth while debating this question, and I did debate it. I could
not sleep for dreaming about eruptions. Now, the part of ejected scoriae
and ashes seemed to my mind a very rough one to act.

So, at last, when I could hold out no longer, I resolved to lay the case
before my uncle, as prudently and as cautiously as possible, just under
the form of an almost impossible hypothesis.

I went to him. I communicated my fears to him, and drew back a step to
give him room for the explosion which I knew must follow. But I was
mistaken.

"I was thinking of that," he replied with great simplicity.

What could those words mean?—Was he actually going to listen to reason?
Was he contemplating the abandonment of his plans? This was too good to
be true.

After a few moments' silence, during which I dared not question him, he
resumed:

"I was thinking of that. Ever since we arrived at Stapi I have been
occupied with the important question you have just opened, for we must
not be guilty of imprudence."

"No, indeed!" I replied with forcible emphasis.

"For six hundred years Snæfell has been dumb; but he may speak again.
Now, eruptions are always preceded by certain well-known phenomena. I
have therefore examined the natives, I have studied external
appearances, and I can assure you, Axel, that there will be no
eruption."

At this positive affirmation I stood amazed and speechless.

"You don't doubt my word?" said my uncle. "Well, follow me."

I obeyed like an automaton. Coming out from the priest's house, the
Professor took a straight road, which, through an opening in the
basaltic wall, led away from the sea. We were soon in the open country,
if one may give that name to a vast extent of mounds of volcanic
products. This tract seemed crushed under a rain of enormous ejected
rocks of trap, basalt, granite, and all kinds of igneous rocks.

Here and there I could see puffs and jets of steam curling up into the
air, called in Icelandic 'reykir,' issuing from thermal springs, and
indicating by their motion the volcanic energy underneath. This seemed
to justify my fears: But I fell from the height of my new-born hopes
when my uncle said:

"You see all these volumes of steam, Axel; well, they demonstrate that
we have nothing to fear from the fury of a volcanic eruption."

"Am I to believe that?" I cried.

"Understand this clearly," added the Professor. "At the approach of an
eruption these jets would redouble their activity, but disappear
altogether during the period of the eruption. For the elastic fluids,
being no longer under pressure, go off by way of the crater instead of
escaping by their usual passages through the fissures in the soil.
Therefore, if these vapours remain in their usual condition, if they
display no augmentation of force, and if you add to this the observation
that the wind and rain are not ceasing and being replaced by a still and
heavy atmosphere, then you may affirm that no eruption is preparing."

"But—"

'No more; that is sufficient. When science has uttered her voice, let
babblers hold their peace.'

I returned to the parsonage, very crestfallen. My uncle had beaten me
with the weapons of science. Still I had one hope left, and this was,
that when we had reached the bottom of the crater it would be
impossible, for want of a passage, to go deeper, in spite of all the
Saknussemm's in Iceland.

I spent that whole night in one constant nightmare; in the heart of a
volcano, and from the deepest depths of the earth I saw myself tossed up
amongst the interplanetary spaces under the form of an eruptive rock.

The next day, June 23, Hans was awaiting us with his companions carrying
provisions, tools, and instruments; two iron pointed sticks, two rifles,
and two shot belts were for my uncle and myself. Hans, as a cautious
man, had added to our luggage a leathern bottle full of water, which,
with that in our flasks, would ensure us a supply of water for eight
days.

It was nine in the morning. The priest and his tall Megæra were awaiting
us at the door. We supposed they were standing there to bid us a kind
farewell. But the farewell was put in the unexpected form of a heavy
bill, in which everything was charged, even to the very air we breathed
in the pastoral house, infected as it was. This worthy couple were
fleecing us just as a Swiss innkeeper might have done, and estimated
their imperfect hospitality at the highest price.

My uncle paid without a remark: a man who is starting for the centre of
the earth need not be particular about a few rix dollars.

This point being settled, Hans gave the signal, and we soon left Stapi
behind us.
