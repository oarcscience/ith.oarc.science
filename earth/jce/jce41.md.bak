### CHAPTER XXXIX.

#### FOREST SCENERY ILLUMINATED BY ELETRICITY

For another half hour we trod upon a pavement of bones. We pushed on,
impelled by our burning curiosity. What other marvels did this cavern
contain? What new treasures lay here for science to unfold? I was
prepared for any surprise, my imagination was ready for any astonishment
however astounding.

We had long lost sight of the sea shore behind the hills of bones. The
rash Professor, careless of losing his way, hurried me forward. We
advanced in silence, bathed in luminous electric fluid. By some
phenomenon which I am unable to explain, it lighted up all sides of
every object equally. Such was its diffusiveness, there being no central
point from which the light emanated, that shadows no longer existed. You
might have thought yourself under the rays of a vertical sun in a
tropical region at noonday and the height of summer. No vapour was
visible. The rocks, the distant mountains, a few isolated clumps of
forest trees in the distance, presented a weird and wonderful aspect
under these totally new conditions of a universal diffusion of light. We
were like Hoffmann's shadowless man.

After walking a mile we reached the outskirts of a vast forest, but not
one of those forests of fungi which bordered Port Gräuben.

Here was the vegetation of the tertiary period in its fullest blaze of
magnificence. Tall palms, belonging to species no longer living,
splendid palmacites, firs, yews, cypress trees, thujas, representatives
of the conifers. were linked together by a tangled network of long
climbing plants. A soft carpet of moss and hepaticas luxuriously clothed
the soil. A few sparkling streams ran almost in silence under what would
have been the shade of the trees, but that there was no shadow. On their
banks grew tree-ferns similar to those we grow in hothouses. But a
remarkable feature was the total absence of colour in all those trees,
shrubs, and plants, growing without the life-giving heat and light of
the sun. Everything seemed mixed-up and confounded in one uniform silver
grey or light brown tint like that of fading and faded leaves. Not a
green leaf anywhere, and the flowers—which were abundant enough in the
tertiary period, which first gave birth to flowers—looked like
brown-paper flowers, without colour or scent.

My uncle Liedenbrock ventured to penetrate under this colossal grove. I
followed him, not without fear. Since nature had here provided vegetable
nourishment, why should not the terrible mammals be there too? I
perceived in the broad clearings left by fallen trees, decayed with age,
leguminose plants, acerineæ, rubiceæ and many other eatable shrubs, dear
to ruminant animals at every period. Then I observed, mingled together
in confusion, trees of countries far apart on the surface of the globe.
The oak and the palm were growing side by side, the Australian
eucalyptus leaned against the Norwegian pine, the birch-tree of the
north mingled its foliage with New Zealand kauris. It was enough to
distract the most ingenious classifier of terrestrial botany.

Suddenly I halted. I drew back my uncle.

The diffused light revealed the smallest object in the dense and distant
thickets. I had thought I saw—no! I did see, with my own eyes, vast
colossal forms moving amongst the trees. They were gigantic animals; it
was a herd of mastodons—not fossil remains, but living and resembling
those the bones of which were found in the marshes of Ohio in 1801. I
saw those huge elephants whose long, flexible trunks were grouting and
turning up the soil under the trees like a legion of serpents. I could
hear the crashing noise of their long ivory tusks boring into the old
decaying trunks. The boughs cracked, and the leaves torn away by
cartloads went down the cavernous throats of the vast brutes.

So, then, the dream in which I had had a vision of the prehistoric
world, of the tertiary and post-tertiary periods, was now realised. And
there we were alone, in the bowels of the earth, at the mercy of its
wild inhabitants!

My uncle was gazing with intense and eager interest.

"Come on!" said he, seizing my arm. "Forward! forward!"

"No, I will not!" I cried. "We have no firearms. What could we do in the
midst of a herd of these four-footed giants? Come away, uncle—come! No
human being may with safety dare the anger of these monstrous beasts."

"No human creature?" replied my uncle in a lower voice. "You are wrong,
Axel. Look, look down there! I fancy I see a living creature similar to
ourselves: it is a man!"

I looked, shaking my head incredulously. But though at first I was
unbelieving I had to yield to the evidence of my senses.

In fact, at a distance of a quarter of a mile, leaning against the trunk
of a gigantic kauri, stood a human being, the Proteus of those
subterranean regions, a new son of Neptune, watching this countless herd
of mastodons.

Yes, truly, huger still himself. It was no longer a fossil being like
him whose dried remains we had easily lifted up in the field of bones;
it was a giant, able to control those monsters. In stature he was at
least twelve feet high. His head, huge and unshapely as a buffalo's, was
half hidden in the thick and tangled growth of his unkempt hair. It most
resembled the mane of the primitive elephant. In his hand he wielded
with ease an enormous bough, a staff worthy of this shepherd of the
geologic period.

We stood petrified and speechless with amazement. But he might see us!
We must fly!

"Come, do come!" I said to my uncle, who for once allowed himself to be
persuaded.

In another quarter of an hour our nimble heels had carried us beyond the
reach of this horrible monster.

And yet, now that I can reflect quietly, now that my spirit has grown
calm again, now that months have slipped by since this strange and
supernatural meeting, what am I to think? what am I to believe? I must
conclude that it was impossible that our senses had been deceived, that
our eyes did not see what we supposed they saw. No human being lives in
this subterranean world; no generation of men dwells in those inferior
caverns of the globe, unknown to and unconnected with the inhabitants of
its surface. It is absurd to believe it!

I had rather admit that it may have been some animal whose structure
resembled the human, some ape or baboon of the early geological ages,
some protopitheca, or some mesopitheca, some early or middle ape like
that discovered by Mr. Lartet in the bone cave of Sansau. But this
creature surpassed in stature all the measurements known in modern
palæontology. But that a man, a living man, and therefore whole
generations doubtless besides, should be buried there in the bowels of
the earth, is impossible.

However, we had left behind us the luminous forest, dumb with
astonishment, overwhelmed and struck down with a terror which amounted
to stupefaction. We kept running on for fear the horrible monster might
be on our track. It was a flight, a fall, like that fearful pulling and
dragging which is peculiar to nightmare. Instinctively we got back to
the Liedenbrock sea, and I cannot say into what vagaries my mind would
not have carried me but for a circumstance which brought me back to
practical matters.

Although I was certain that we were now treading upon a soil not
hitherto touched by our feet, I often perceived groups of rocks which
reminded me of those about Port Gräuben. Besides, this seemed to confirm
the indications of the needle, and to show that we had against our will
returned to the north of the Liedenbrock sea. Occasionally we felt quite
convinced. Brooks and waterfalls were tumbling everywhere from the
projections in the rocks. I thought I recognised the bed of surturbrand,
our faithful Hansbach, and the grotto in which I had recovered life and
consciousness. Then a few paces farther on, the arrangement of the
cliffs, the appearance of an unrecognised stream, or the strange outline
of a rock, carne to throw me again into doubt.

I communicated my doubts to my uncle. Like myself, he hesitated; he
could recognise nothing again amidst this monotonous scene.

"Evidently," said I, "we have not landed again at our original starting
point, but the storm has carried us a little higher, and if we follow
the shore we shall find Port Gräuben."

"If that is the case it will be useless to continue our exploration, and
we had better return to our raft. But, Axel, are you not mistaken?"

"It is difficult to speak decidedly, uncle, for all these rocks are so
very much alike. Yet I think I recognise the promontory at the foot of
which Hans constructed our launch. We must be very near the little port,
if indeed this is not it," I added, examining a creek which I thought I
recognised.

"No, Axel, we should at least find our own traces and I see nothing—"

"But I do see," I cried, darting upon an object lying on the sand.

And I showed my uncle a rusty dagger which I had just picked up.

"Come," said he, "had you this weapon with you?"

"I! No, certainly! But you, perhaps—"

"Not that I am aware," said the Professor. "I have never had this object
in my possession."

"Well, this is strange!"

"No, Axel, it is very simple. The Icelanders often wear arms of this
kind. This must have belonged to Hans, and he has lost it."

I shook my head. Hans had never had an object like this in his
possession.

"Did it not belong to some preadamite warrior?" I cried, "to some living
man, contemporary with the huge cattle-driver? But no. This is not a
relic of the stone age. It is not even of the iron age. This blade is
steel—"

My uncle stopped me abruptly on my way to a dissertation which would
have taken me a long way, and said coolly:

"Be calm, Axel, and reasonable. This dagger belongs to the sixteenth
century; it is a poniard, such as gentlemen carried in their belts to
give the coup *de grace*. Its origin is Spanish. It was never either
yours, or mine, or the hunter's, nor did it belong to any of those human
beings who may or may not inhabit this inner world. See, it was never
jagged like this by cutting men's throats; its blade is coated with a
rust neither a day, nor a year, nor a hundred years old."

The Professor was getting excited according to his wont, and was
allowing his imagination to run away with him.

"Axel, we are on the way towards the grand discovery. This blade has
been left on the strand for from one to three hundred years, and has
blunted its edge upon the rocks that fringe this subterranean sea!"

"But it has not come alone. It has not twisted itself out of shape; some
one has been here before us!

"Yes—a man has."

"And who was that man?"

"A man who has engraved his name somewhere with that dagger. That man
wanted once more to mark the way to the centre of the earth. Let us look
about: look about!"

And, wonderfully interested, we peered all along the high wall, peeping
into every fissure which might open out into a gallery.

And so we arrived at a place where the shore was much narrowed. Here the
sea came to lap the foot of the steep cliff, leaving a passage no wider
than a couple of yards. Between two boldly projecting rocks appeared the
mouth of a dark tunnel.

There, upon a granite slab, appeared two mysterious graven letters, half
eaten away by time. They were the initials of the bold and daring
traveller:

"A. S.," shouted my uncle. "Arne Saknussemm! Arne Saknussemm
everywhere!"
