### CHAPTER XXX.

#### A NEW MARE INTERNUM

At first I could hardly see anything. My eyes, unaccustomed to the
light, quickly closed. When I was able to reopen them, I stood more
stupefied even than surprised.

"The sea!" I cried.

"Yes," my uncle replied, "the Liedenbrock Sea; and I don't suppose any
other discoverer will ever dispute my claim to name it after myself as
its first discoverer."

A vast sheet of water, the commencement of a lake or an ocean, spread
far away beyond the range of the eye, reminding me forcibly of that open
sea which drew from Xenophon's ten thousand Greeks, after their long
retreat, the simultaneous cry, "Thalatta! thalatta!" the sea! the sea!
The deeply indented shore was lined with a breadth of fine shining sand,
softly lapped by the waves, and strewn with the small shells which had
been inhabited by the first of created beings. The waves broke on this
shore with the hollow echoing murmur peculiar to vast inclosed spaces. A
light foam flew over the waves before the breath of a moderate breeze,
and some of the spray fell upon my face. On this slightly inclining
shore, about a hundred fathoms from the limit of the waves, came down
the foot of a huge wall of vast cliffs, which rose majestically to an
enormous height. Some of these, dividing the beach with their sharp
spurs, formed capes and promontories, worn away by the ceaseless action
of the surf. Farther on the eye discerned their massive outline sharply
defined against the hazy distant horizon.

It was quite an ocean, with the irregular shores of earth, but desert
and frightfully wild in appearance.

If my eyes were able to range afar over this great sea, it was because a
peculiar light brought to view every detail of it. It was not the light
of the sun, with his dazzling shafts of brightness and the splendour of
his rays; nor was it the pale and uncertain shimmer of the moonbeams,
the dim reflection of a nobler body of light. No; the illuminating power
of this light, its trembling diffusiveness, its bright, clear whiteness,
and its low temperature, showed that it must be of electric origin. It
was like an aurora borealis, a continuous cosmical phenomenon, filling a
cavern of sufficient extent to contain an ocean.

The vault that spanned the space above, the sky, if it could be called
so, seemed composed of vast plains of cloud, shifting and variable
vapours, which by their condensation must at certain times fall in
torrents of rain. I should have thought that under so powerful a
pressure of the atmosphere there could be no evaporation; and yet, under
a law unknown to me, there were broad tracts of vapour suspended in the
air. But then 'the weather was fine.' The play of the electric light
produced singular effects upon the upper strata of cloud. Deep shadows
reposed upon their lower wreaths; and often, between two separated
fields of cloud, there glided down a ray of unspeakable lustre. But it
was not solar light, and there was no heat. The general effect was sad,
supremely melancholy. Instead of the shining firmament, spangled with
its innumerable stars, shining singly or in clusters, I felt that all
these subdued and shaded fights were ribbed in by vast walls of granite,
which seemed to overpower me with their weight, and that all this space,
great as it was, would not be enough for the march of the humblest of
satellites.

Then I remembered the theory of an English captain, who likened the
earth to a vast hollow sphere, in the interior of which the air became
luminous because of the vast pressure that weighed upon it; while two
stars, Pluto and Proserpine, rolled within upon the circuit of their
mysterious orbits.

We were in reality shut up inside an immeasurable excavation. Its width
could not be estimated, since the shore ran widening as far as eye could
reach, nor could its length, for the dim horizon bounded the new. As for
its height, it must have been several leagues. Where this vault rested
upon its granite base no eye could tell; but there was a cloud hanging
far above, the height of which we estimated at 12,000 feet, a greater
height than that of any terrestrial vapour, and no doubt due to the
great density of the air.

The word cavern does not convey any idea of this immense space; words of
human tongue are inadequate to describe the discoveries of him who
ventures into the deep abysses of earth.

Besides I could not tell upon what geological theory to account for the
existence of such an excavation. Had the cooling of the globe produced
it? I knew of celebrated caverns from the descriptions of travellers,
but had never heard of any of such dimensions as this.

If the grotto of Guachara, in Colombia, visited by Humboldt, had not
given up the whole of the secret of its depth to the philosopher, who
investigated it to the depth of 2,500 feet, it probably did not extend
much farther. The immense mammoth cave in Kentucky is of gigantic
proportions, since its vaulted roof rises five hundred feet  <span
id="fr_9"></span>[10](#fn_9.md) above the level of an unfathomable lake and
travellers have explored its ramifications to the extent of forty miles.
But what were these cavities compared to that in which I stood with
wonder and admiration, with its sky of luminous vapours, its bursts of
electric light, and a vast sea filling its bed? My imagination fell
powerless before such immensity.

I gazed upon these wonders in silence. Words failed me to express my
feelings. I felt as if I was in some distant planet Uranus or
Neptune—and in the presence of phenomena of which my terrestrial
experience gave me no cognisance. For such novel sensations, new words
were wanted; and my imagination failed to supply them. I gazed, I
thought, I admired, with a stupefaction mingled with a certain amount of
fear.

The unforeseen nature of this spectacle brought back the colour to my
cheeks. I was under a new course of treatment with the aid of
astonishment, and my convalescence was promoted by this novel system of
therapeutics; besides, the dense and breezy air invigorated me,
supplying more oxygen to my lungs.

It will be easily conceived that after an imprisonment of forty seven
days in a narrow gallery it was the height of physical enjoyment to
breathe a moist air impregnated with saline particles.

I was delighted to leave my dark grotto. My uncle, already familiar with
these wonders, had ceased to feel surprise.

"You feel strong enough to walk a little way now?" he asked.

"Yes, certainly; and nothing could be more delightful."

"Well, take my arm, Axel, and let us follow the windings of the shore."

I eagerly accepted, and we began to coast along this new sea. On the
left huge pyramids of rock, piled one upon another, produced a
prodigious titanic effect. Down their sides flowed numberless
waterfalls, which went on their way in brawling but pellucid streams. A
few light vapours, leaping from rock to rock, denoted the place of hot
springs; and streams flowed softly down to the common basin, gliding
down the gentle slopes with a softer murmur.

Amongst these streams I recognised our faithful travelling companion,
the Hansbach, coming to lose its little volume quietly in the mighty
sea, just as if it had done nothing else since the beginning of the
world.

"We shall see it no more," I said, with a sigh.

"What matters," replied the philosopher, "whether this or another serves
to guide us?"

I thought him rather ungrateful.

But at that moment my attention was drawn to an unexpected sight. At a
distance of five hundred paces, at the turn of a high promontory,
appeared a high, tufted, dense forest. It was composed of trees of
moderate height, formed like umbrellas, with exact geometrical outlines.
The currents of wind seemed to have had no effect upon their shape, and
in the midst of the windy blasts they stood unmoved and firm, just like
a clump of petrified cedars.

I hastened forward. I could not give any name to these singular
creations. Were they some of the two hundred thousand species of
vegetables known hitherto, and did they claim a place of their own in
the lacustrine flora? No; when we arrived under their shade my surprise
turned into admiration. There stood before me productions of earth, but
of gigantic stature, which my uncle immediately named.

"It is only a forest of mushrooms," said he.

And he was right. Imagine the large development attained by these
plants, which prefer a warm, moist climate. I knew that the *Lycopodon
giganteum* attains, according to Bulliard, a circumference of eight or
nine feet; but here were pale mushrooms, thirty to forty feet high, and
crowned with a cap of equal diameter. There they stood in thousands. No
light could penetrate between their huge cones, and complete darkness
reigned beneath those giants; they formed settlements of domes placed in
close array like the round, thatched roofs of a central African city.

Yet I wanted to penetrate farther underneath, though a chill fell upon
me as soon as I came under those cellular vaults. For half an hour we
wandered from side to side in the damp shades, and it was a comfortable
and pleasant change to arrive once more upon the sea shore.

But the subterranean vegetation was not confined to these fungi. Farther
on rose groups of tall trees of colourless foliage and easy to
recognise. They were lowly shrubs of earth, here attaining gigantic
size; lycopodiums, a hundred feet high; the huge sigillaria, found in
our coal mines; tree ferns, as tall as our fir-trees in northern
latitudes; lepidodendra, with cylindrical forked stems, terminated by
long leaves, and bristling with rough hairs like those of the cactus.

"Wonderful, magnificent, splendid!" cried my uncle. "Here is the entire
flora of the second period of the world—the transition period. These,
humble garden plants with us, were tall trees in the early ages. Look,
Axel, and admire it all. Never had botanist such a feast as this!"

"You are right, my uncle. Providence seems to have preserved in this
immense conservatory the antediluvian plants which the wisdom of
philosophers has so sagaciously put together again."

"It is a conservatory, Axel; but is it not also a menagerie?"

"Surely not a menagerie!"

"Yes; no doubt of it. Look at that dust under your feet; see the bones
scattered on the ground."

"So there are!" I cried; "bones of extinct animals."

I had rushed upon these remains, formed of indestructible phosphates of
lime, and without hesitation I named these monstrous bones, which lay
scattered about like decayed trunks of trees.

"Here is the lower jaw of a mastodon,"  <span
id="fr_10"></span>[11](#fn_10.md) I said. "These are the molar teeth of the
deinotherium; this femur must have belonged to the greatest of those
beasts, the megatherium. It certainly is a menagerie, for these remains
were not brought here by a deluge. The animals to which they belonged
roamed on the shores of this subterranean sea, under the shade of those
arborescent trees. Here are entire skeletons. And yet I cannot
understand the appearance of these quadrupeds in a granite cavern."

"Why?"

"Because animal life existed upon the earth only in the secondary
period, when a sediment of soil had been deposited by the rivers, and
taken the place of the incandescent rocks of the primitive period."

"Well, Axel, there is a very simple answer to your objection that this
soil is alluvial."

"What! at such a depth below the surface of the earth?"

"No doubt; and there is a geological explanation of the fact. At a
certain period the earth consisted only of an elastic crust or bark,
alternately acted on by forces from above or below, according to the
laws of attraction and gravitation. Probably there were subsidences of
the outer crust, when a portion of the sedimentary deposits was carried
down sudden openings."

"That may be," I replied; "but if there have been creatures now extinct
in these underground regions, why may not some of those monsters be now
roaming through these gloomy forests, or hidden behind the steep crags?"

And as this unpleasant notion got hold of me, I surveyed with anxious
scrutiny the open spaces before me; but no living creature appeared upon
the barren strand.

I felt rather tired, and went to sit down at the end of a promontory, at
the foot of which the waves came and beat themselves into spray. Thence
my eye could sweep every part of the bay; within its extremity a little
harbour was formed between the pyramidal cliffs, where the still waters
slept untouched by the boisterous winds. A brig and two or three
schooners might have moored within it in safety. I almost fancied I
should presently see some ship issue from it, full sail, and take to the
open sea under the southern breeze.

But this illusion lasted a very short time. We were the only living
creatures in this subterranean world. When the wind lulled, a deeper
silence than that of the deserts fell upon the arid, naked rocks, and
weighed upon the surface of the ocean. I then desired to pierce the
distant haze, and to rend asunder the mysterious curtain that hung
across the horizon. Anxious queries arose to my lips. Where did that sea
terminate? Where did it lead to? Should we ever know anything about its
opposite shores?

My uncle made no doubt about it at all; I both desired and feared.

After spending an hour in the contemplation of this marvellous
spectacle, we returned to the shore to regain the grotto, and I fell
asleep in the midst of the strangest thoughts.

a late geological period, the Pliocene, just before the glacial epoch,
and therefore could have no connection with the carboniferous
vegetation. (Trans.)
