### XVII

### THE SEARCH FOR NORUMBEGA

Sir Humphrey Gilbert, colonel of the British forces in the Netherlands,
was poring over the manuscript narrative of David Ingram, mariner.
Ingram had in 1568-69 taken the widest range of travel that had ever
been taken in the new continent, of which it was still held doubtful by
many whether it was or was not a part of Asia. "Surely," Gilbert said to
his half-brother, Walter Raleigh, a youth of twenty-three, "this knave
hath seen strange things. He hath been set ashore by John Hawkins in the
Gulf of Mexico and there left behind. He hath travelled northward with
two of his companions along Indian trails; he hath even reached
Norumbega; he hath seen that famous city with its houses of crystal and
silver."

"Pine logs and hemlock bark, belike," said Raleigh, scornfully.

<span id="page_187">p. 187</span>

"Nay," said Gilbert, "he hath carefully written it down. He saw kings
decorated with rubies six inches long; and they were borne on chairs of
silver and crystal, adorned with precious stones. He saw pearls as
common as pebbles, and the natives were laden down by their ornaments of
gold and silver. The city of Bega was three-quarters of a mile long and
had many streets wider than those of London. Some houses had massive
pillars of crystal and silver."

"What assurance can he give?" asked Raleigh.

"He offers on his life to prove it."

"A small offer, mayhap. There be many of these lying mariners whose
lives are as worthless as the stories they relate. But what said he of
the natives?"

"Kindly disposed," was the reply, "so far as he went, but those dwelling
farther north, where he did not go, were said to be cannibals with teeth
like those of dogs, whereby you may know them."

"Travellers' tales," said Raleigh. "*Omne ignotum pro mirifico*."

"He returned," said Gilbert, disregarding the

<span id="page_188">p. 188</span>

interruption, "in the *Gargarine*, a French vessel commanded by Captain
Champagne."

"Methinks something of the flavor represented by the good captain's name
hath got into your Englishman's brain. Good ale never gives such
fantasies. Doth he perchance speak of elephants?"

"He doth," said Sir Humphrey, hesitatingly. "Perchance he saw them not,
but heard of them only."

"What says he of them?" asked Raleigh.

"He says that he saw in that country both elephants and ounces; and he
says that their trumpets are made of elephants' teeth."

"But the houses," said Raleigh; "tell me of the houses."

"In every house," said Gilbert, reading from the manuscript, "they have
scoops, buckets, and divers vessels, all of massive silver with which
they throw out water and otherwise employ them. The women wear great
plates of gold covering their bodies, and chains of great pearls in the
manner of curvettes; and the men wear manilions

<span id="page_189">p. 189</span>

or bracelets on each arm and each leg, some of gold and some of silver."

"Whence come they, these gauds?"

"There are great rivers where one may find pieces of gold as big as the
fist; and there are great rocks of crystal, sufficient to load many
ships."

This was all which was said on that day, but never was explorer more
eager than Gilbert. He wrote a "Discourse of a Discoverie for a New
Passage to Cathaia and the East Indies"--published without his knowledge
by George Gascoigne. In 1578 he had from Queen Elizabeth a patent of
exploration, allowing him to take possession of any uncolonized lands in
North America, paying for these a fifth of all gold and silver found.
The next year he sailed with Raleigh for Newfoundland, but one vessel
was lost and the others returned to England. In 1583, he sailed again,
taking with him the narrative of Ingram, which he reprinted. He also
took with him a learned Hungarian from Buda, named Parmenius, who went
for the express purpose of singing the praise of Norumbega in Latin
verse,

<span id="page_190">p. 190</span>

but was drowned in Sir Humphrey's great flag-ship, the *Delight*. This
wreck took place near Sable Island, and as most of the supplies for the
expedition went down in the flag-ship, the men in the remaining vessels
grew so impatient as to compel a return. There were two vessels, the
*Golden Hind* of forty tons, and the *Squirrel* of ten tons, this last
being a mere boat then called a frigate, a small vessel propelled by
both sails and oars, quite unlike the war-ship afterwards called by that
name. On both these vessels the men were so distressed that they
gathered on the bulwarks, pointing to their empty mouths and their
ragged clothing. The officers of the *Golden Hind* were unwilling to
return, but consented on Sir Humphrey's promise that they should come
back in the spring; they sailed for England on the 31st of August. All
wished him to return in the *Golden Hind* as a much larger and safer
vessel; the *Squirrel*, besides its smallness, being encumbered on the
deck with guns, ammunition, and nettings, making it unseaworthy. But
when he was begged to remove into the larger vessel, he said, "I will
not forsake my little company going

<span id="page_191">p. 191</span>

homeward with whom I have passed so many storms and perils." One reason
for this was, the narrator of the voyage says, because of "hard reports
given of him that he was afraid of the sea, albeit this was rather
rashness than advised resolution, to prefer the wind of a vain report to
the weight of his own life."

On the very day of sailing they caught their first glimpse of some large
species of seal or walrus, which is thus described by the old narrator
of the expedition:--

"So vpon Saturday in the afternoone the 31 of August, we changed our
course, and returned backe for England, at which very instant, euen in
winding about, there passed along betweene vs and towards the land which
we now forsooke a very lion to our seeming, in shape, hair and colour,
not swimming after the maner of a beast by moouing of his feete, but
rather sliding vpon the water with his whole body (excepting the legs)
in sight, neither yet in diuing vnder, and againe rising aboue the
water, as the maner is, of Whales, Dolphins, Tunise, Porposes, and all
other fish: but confidently

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

shewing himselfe aboue water without hiding: Notwithstanding, we
presented our selues in open view and gesture to amase him, as all
creatures will be commonly at a sudden gaze and sight of men. Thus he
passed along turning his head to and fro, yawning and gaping wide, with
ougly demonstration of long teeth, and glaring eies, and to bidde vs a
farewell (comming right against the Hinde) he sent forth a horrible
voyce, roaring or bellowing as doeth a lion, which spectacle wee all
beheld so farre as we were able to discerne the same, as men prone to
wonder at euery strange thing, as this doubtlesse was, to see a lion in
the Ocean sea, or fish in shape of a lion. What opinion others had
thereof, and chiefly the Generall himselfe, I forbeare to deliuer: But
he tooke it for Bonum Omen \[a good omen\], reioycing that he was to
warre against such an enemie, if it were the deuill."

When they came north of the Azores, very violent storms met them; most
"outrageous seas," the narrator says; and they saw little

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

lights upon the mainyard called then by sailors "Castor and Pollux," and
now "St. Elmo's Fire"; yet they had but one of these at a time, and this
is thought a sign of tempest. On September 9, in the afternoon, "the
general," as they called him, Sir Humphrey, was sitting abaft with a
book in his hand, and cried out more than once to those in the other
vessel, "We are as near to heaven by sea as by land." And that same
night about twelve o'clock, the frigate being ahead of the *Golden
Hind*, the lights of the smaller vessel suddenly disappeared, and they
knew that she had sunk in the sea. The event is well described in a
ballad by Longfellow.

The name of Norumbega and the tradition of its glories survived Sir
Humphrey Gilbert. In a French map of 1543, the town appears with castle
and towers. Jean Allfonsce, who visited New England in that year,
describes it as the capital of a great fur country. Students of Indian
tongues defined the word as meaning "the place of a fine city"; while
the learned Grotius seized upon it as being the same as

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Norberga and so
affording a relic of the visits of the Northmen. As to the locality, it
appeared first on the maps as a large island, then as a smaller one, and
after 1569 no longer as an island, but a part of the mainland, bordering
apparently on the Penobscot River. Whittier in his poem of "Norumbega"
describes a Norman knight as seeking it in vain.

"He turned him back, 'O master dear,  
  We are but men misled;  
And thou hast sought a city here  
  To find a grave instead.

  \*    \*    \*    \*    \*

"'No builded wonder of these lands  
  My weary eyes shall see;  
A city never made with hands  
  Alone awaiteth me.'"

So Champlain, in 1604, could find no trace of it, and said that "no such
marvel existed," while Mark Lescarbot, the Parisian advocate, writing in
1609, says, "If this beautiful town ever existed in nature, I would like
to know who pulled it down, for there is nothing here

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

but huts made of pickets and covered with the barks of trees or skins."
Yet it kept its place on maps till 1640, and even Heylin in his
"Cosmography" (1669) speaks of "Norumbega and its fair city," though he
fears that the latter never existed.

It is a curious fact that the late Mr. Justin Winsor, the eminent
historian, after much inquiry among the present descendants of the
Indian tribes in Maine, could never find any one who could remember to
have heard the name of Norumbega.
