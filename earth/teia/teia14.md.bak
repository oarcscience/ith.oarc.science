### XI

### MAELDUIN'S VOYAGE

AN Irish knight named Maelduin set forth early in the eighth century to
seek round the seas for his father's murderers. By the advice of a
wizard, he was to take with him seventeen companions, neither less nor
more; but at the last moment his three foster brothers, whom he had not
included, begged to go with him. He refused, and they cast themselves
into the sea to swim after his vessel. Maelduin had pity on them and
took them in, but his disregard of the wizard's advice brought
punishment; and it was only after long wanderings, after visiting
multitudes of unknown and often enchanted islands, and after the death
or loss of the three foster brothers, that Maelduin was able to return
to his native land.

One island which they visited was divided into four parts by four
fences, one of gold, one

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

of silver, one of brass, one of crystal. In the first division there
dwelt kings, in the second queens, in the third warriors, and in the
fourth maidens. The voyagers landed in the maidens' realm; one of these
came out in a boat and gave them food, such that every one found in it
the taste he liked best; then followed an enchanted drink, which made
them sleep for three days and three nights. When they awakened they were
in their boat on the sea, and nothing was to be seen either of island or
maidens.

The next island had in it a fortress with a brazen door and a bridge of
glass, on which every one who ascended it slipped and fell. A woman came
from the fortress, pail in hand, drew water from the sea and returned,
not answering them when they spoke. When they reached at last the brazen
door and struck upon it, it made a sweet and soothing sound, and they
went to sleep, for three days and nights, as before. On the fourth day a
maiden came who was most beautiful; she wore garments of white silk, a
white mantle with a

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

brooch of silver with studs of gold, and a gold band round her hair. She
greeted each man by his name, and said, "It is long that we have
expected you." She took them into the castle and gave them every kind of
food they had ever desired. Maelduin was filled with love for her and
asked her for her love; but she told him that love was sin and she had
no knowledge of sin; so she left him. On the morrow they found their
boat, stranded on a crag, while lady and fortress and island had all
vanished.

Another island on which they landed was large and bare, with another
fortress and a palace. There they met a lady who was kinder. She wore an
embroidered purple mantle, gold embroidered gloves, and ornamented
sandals, and was just riding up to the palace door. Seventeen maidens
waited there for her. She offered to keep the strangers as guests, and
that each of them should have a wife, she herself wedding Maelduin. She
was, it seems, the widow of the king of the island, and these were her
seventeen daughters. She ruled the island and went every day to judge
the people and direct

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

their lives. If the strangers would stay, she said that they should
never more know sorrow, or hardships, or old age; she herself, in spite
of her large family, being young and beautiful as ever. They stayed
three months, and it seemed to all but Maelduin that the three months
were three years. When the queen was absent, one day, the men took the
boat and compelled Maelduin to leave the island with them; but the queen
rode after them and flung a rope, which Maelduin caught and which clung
to his hand. She drew them back to the shore; this happened thrice, and
the men accused Maelduin of catching the rope on purpose; he bade
another man catch it, and his companions cut off his hand, and they
escaped at last.

On one island the seafarers found three magic apples, and each apple
gave sufficient food for forty nights; again, on another island, they
found the same apples. In another place still, a great bird like a cloud
arrived, with a tree larger than an oak in its claws. After a while two
eagles came and cleaned the feathers of the

<span id="page_100">p. 100</span>

larger bird. They also stripped off the red berries from the tree and
threw them into the ocean until its foam grew red. The great bird then
flew into the ocean and cleaned itself. This happened daily for three
days, when the great bird flew away with stronger wings, its youth being
thus renewed.

They came to another island where many people stood by the shore talking
and joking. They were all looking at Maelduin and his comrades, and kept
gaping and laughing, but would not exchange a word with them. Then
Maelduin sent one of his foster brothers on the island; but he ranged
himself with the others and did as they did. Maelduin and his men rowed
round and round the island, and whenever they passed the point where
this comrade was, they addressed him, but he never answered, and only
gaped and laughed. They waited for him a long time and left him. This
island they found to be called The Island of Joy.

On another island they found sheep grazing, of enormous size; on
another, birds, whose eggs when eaten caused feathers to sprout all over
the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

bodies of those who eat them. On another they found crimson flowers,
whose mere perfume sufficed for food, and they encountered women whose
only food was apples. Through the window flew three birds: a blue one
with a crimson head; a crimson one with a green head; a green one with a
golden head. These sang heavenly music, and were sent to accompany the
wanderers on their departing; the queen of the island gave them an
emerald cup, such that water poured into it became wine. She asked if
they knew how long they had been there, and when they said "a day," she
told them that it was a year, during which they had had no food. As they
sailed away, the birds sang to them until both birds and island
disappeared in the mist.

They saw another island standing on a single pedestal, as if on one
foot, projecting from the water. Rowing round it to seek a way into it
they found no passage, but they saw in the base of the pedestal, under
water, a closed door with a lock--this being the only way in which the
island could be entered. Around another island there was a fiery
rampart, which constantly moved in a

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

circle. In the side of that rampart was an open door, and as it came
opposite them in its turning course, they beheld through it the island
and all therein; and its occupants, even human beings, were many and
beautiful, wearing rich garments, and feasting with gold vessels in
their hands. The voyagers lingered long to gaze upon this marvel.

On another island they found many human beings, black in color and
raiment, and always bewailing. Lots were cast, and another of Maelduin's
foster brothers was sent on shore. He at once joined the weeping crowd,
and did as they did. Two others were sent to bring him back, and both
shared his fate, falling under some strange spell. Then Maelduin sent
four others, and bade them look neither at the land nor at the sky; to
wrap their mouths and noses with their garments, and not breathe the
island air; and not to take off their eyes from their comrades. In this
way the two who followed the foster brother on shore were rescued, but
he remained behind.

Of another island they could see nothing but

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

a fort, protected by a great white rampart, on which nothing living was
to be seen but a small cat, leaping from one to another of four stone
pillars. They found brooches and ornaments of gold and silver, they
found white quilts and embroidered garments hanging up, flitches of
bacon were suspended, a whole ox was roasting, and vessels stood filled
with intoxicating drinks. Maelduin asked the cat if all this was for
them; but the cat merely looked at him and went on playing. The
seafarers dined and drank, then went to sleep. As they were about to
depart, Maelduin's third foster brother proposed to carry off a tempting
necklace, and in spite of his leader's warnings grasped it. Instantly
the cat leaped through him like a fiery arrow, burned him so that he
became ashes, and went back to its pillar. Thus all three of the foster
brothers who had disregarded the wizard's warning, and forced themselves
upon the party, were either killed or left behind upon the enchanted
islands.

Around another island there was a demon horse-race going on; the riders
were just riding in over the sea, and then the race began; the

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

voyagers could only dimly perceive the forms of the horses, but could
hear the cries of their riders, the strokes of the whips, and the words
of the spectators, "See the gray horse!" "Watch the chestnut horse!" and
the voyagers were so alarmed that they rowed away. The next island was
covered with trees laden with golden apples, but these were being
rapidly eaten by small, scarlet animals which they found, on coming
nearer, to be all made of fire and thus brightened in hue. Then the
animals vanished, and Maelduin with his men landed, and though the
ground was still hot from the fiery creatures, they brought away a boat
load of the apples. Another island was divided into two parts by a brass
wall across the middle. There were two flocks of sheep, and those on one
side of the wall were white, while the others were black. A large man
was dividing and arranging the sheep, and threw them easily over the
wall. When he threw a white sheep among the black ones it became black,
and when he threw a black sheep among the white ones, it became white
instantly. The voyagers thought

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

of landing, but when Maelduin saw this, he said, "Let us throw something
on shore to see if it will change color. If it does, we will avoid the
island." So they took a black branch and threw it toward the white
sheep. When it fell, it grew white; and the same with a white branch on
the black side. "It is lucky for us," said Maelduin, "that we did not
land on this island."

They came next to an island where there was but one man visible, very
aged, and with long, white hair. Above him were trees, covered with
great numbers of birds. The old man told them that he like them had come
in a curragh, or coracle, and had placed many green sods beneath his
feet, to steady the boat. Reaching this spot, the green sods had joined
together and formed an island which at first gave him hardly room to
stand; but every year one foot was added to its size, and one tree grew
up. He had lived there for centuries, and those birds were the souls of
his children and descendants, each of whom was sent there after death,
and they were all fed from

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

heaven each day. On the next island there was a great roaring as of
bellows and a sound of smiths' hammers, as if striking all together on
an anvil, every sound seeming to come from the strokes of a dozen men.
"Are they near?" asked one big voice. "Silence!" said another; and they
were evidently watching for the boat. When it rowed away, one of the
smiths flung after them a vast mass of red-hot iron, which he had
grasped with the tongs from the furnace. It fell just short, but made
the whole sea to hiss and boil around them as they rowed away.

Another island had a wall of water round it, and Maelduin and his men
saw multitudes of people driving away herds of cattle and sheep, and
shouting, "There they are, they have come again;" and a woman pelted
them from below with great nuts, which the crew gathered for eating.
Then as they rowed away they heard one man say, "Where are they now?"
and another cried, "They are going away." Still again they visited an
island where a great stream of water shot up into the air and made an
arch like a rainbow that spanned the land.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> They walked below
it without getting wet, and hooked down from it many large salmon;
besides that, many fell out above their heads, so that they had more
than they could carry away with them. These are by no means all of the
strange adventures of Maelduin and his men.

The last island to which they came was called Raven's Stream, and there
one of the men, who had been very homesick, leaped out upon shore. As
soon as he touched the land he became a heap of ashes, as if his body
had lain in the earth a thousand years. This showed them for the first
time during how vast a period they had been absent, and what a space
they must have traversed. Instead of thirty enchanted islands they had
visited thrice fifty, many of them twice or thrice as large as Ireland,
whence the voyagers first came. In the wonderful experiences of their
long lives they had apparently lost sight of the search which they had
undertaken, for the murderers of Maelduin's father, since of them we
hear no more. The island enchantment seems to have banished all other
thoughts.
