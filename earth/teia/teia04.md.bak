### I

### THE STORY OF ATLANTIS

THE Greek sage Socrates, when he was but a boy minding his father's
goats, used to lie on the grass under the myrtle trees; and, while the
goats grazed around him, he loved to read over and over the story which
Solon, the law-giver and poet, wrote down for the great-grandfather of
Socrates, and which Solon had always meant to make into a poem, though
he died without doing it. But this was briefly what he wrote in prose:--

"I, Solon, was never in my life so surprised as when I went to Egypt for
instruction in my youth, and there, in the temple of Sais, saw an aged
priest who told me of the island of Atlantis, which was sunk in the sea
thousands of years ago. He said that in the division of the earth the
gods agreed that the god Poseidon, or Neptune, should have, as his
share, this

<span id="page_2">p. 2</span>

great island which then lay in the ocean west of the Mediterranean Sea,
and was larger than all Asia. There was a mortal maiden there whom
Poseidon wished to marry, and to secure her he surrounded the valley
where she dwelt with three rings of sea and two of land so that no one
could enter; and he made underground springs, with water hot or cold,
and supplied all things needful to the life of man. Here he lived with
her for many years, and they had ten sons; and these sons divided the
island among them and had many children, who dwelt there for more than a
thousand years. They had mines of gold and silver, and pastures for
elephants, and many fragrant plants. They erected palaces and dug
canals; and they built their temples of white, red, and black stone, and
covered them with gold and silver. In these were statues of gold,
especially one of the god Poseidon driving six winged horses. He was so
large as to touch the roof with his head, and had a hundred water-nymphs
around him, riding on dolphins. The islanders had also baths and gardens
and sea-walls, and

they had twelve hundred ships and ten thousand chariots. All this was in
the royal city alone, and the people were friendly and good and
well-affectioned towards all. But as time went on they grew less so, and
they did not obey the laws, so that they offended heaven. In a single
day and night the island disappeared and sank beneath the sea; and this
is why the sea in that region grew so impassable and impenetrable,
because there is a quantity of shallow mud in the way, and this was
caused by the sinking of a single vast island."

"This is the tale," said Solon, "which the old Egyptian priest told to
me." And Solon's tale was read by Socrates, the boy, as he lay in the
grass; and he told it to his friends after he grew up, as is written in
his dialogues recorded by his disciple, Plato. And though this great
island of Atlantis has never been seen again, yet a great many smaller
islands have been found in the Atlantic Ocean, and they have sometimes
been lost to sight and found again.

There is, also, in this ocean a vast tract of floating seaweed, called
by sailors the Sargasso

<span id="page_4">p. 4</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Sea,--covering a
region as large as France,--and this has been thought by many to mark
the place of a sunken island. There are also many islands, such as the
Azores, which have been supposed at different times to be fragments of
Atlantis; and besides all this, the remains of the vanished island have
been looked for in all parts of the world. Some writers have thought it
was in Sweden, others in Spitzbergen, others in Africa, in Palestine, in
America. Since the depth of the Atlantic has been more thoroughly
sounded, a few writers have maintained that the inequalities of its
floor show some traces of the submerged Atlantis, but the general
opinion of men of science is quite the other way. The visible Atlantic
islands are all, or almost all, they say, of volcanic origin; and though
there are ridges in the bottom of the ocean, they do not connect the
continents.

At any rate, this was the original story of Atlantis, and the legends
which follow in these pages have doubtless all grown, more or less, out
of this first tale which Socrates told.
