### XII

### THE VOYAGE OF ST. BRANDAN

The young student Brandan was awakened in the morning by the crowing of
the cock in the great Irish abbey where he dwelt; he rose, washed his
face and hands and dressed himself, then passed into the chapel, where
he prayed and sang until the dawn of the day. "With song comes courage"
was the motto of the abbey. It was one of those institutions like great
colonies,--church, library, farm, workshop, college, all in one,--of
which Ireland in the sixth century was full, and which existed also
elsewhere. Their extent is best seen by the modern traveller in the
remains of the vast buildings at Tintern in England, scattered over a
wide extent of country, where you keep coming upon walls and fragments
of buildings which once formed a part of a single great institution, in
which all the life

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

of the community was organized, as was the case in the Spanish missions
of California. At the abbey of Bangor in Wales, for instance, there were
two thousand four hundred men,--all under the direction of a
comparatively small body of monks, who were trained to an amount of
organizing skill like that now needed for a great railway system. Some
of these men were occupied, in various mechanic arts, some in mining,
but most of them in agriculture, which they carried on with their own
hands, without the aid of animals, and in total silence.

Having thus labored in the fields until noonday, Brandan then returned
that he might work in the library, transcribing ancient manuscripts or
illustrating books of prayer. Having to observe silence, he wrote the
name of the book to give to the librarian, and if it were a Christian
work, he stretched out his hand, making motions with his fingers as if
turning over the leaves; but if it were by a pagan author, the monk who
asked for it was required to scratch his ear as a dog does, to show his
contempt, because, the regulations said, an unbeliever might well be
compared to

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

that animal <span id="fr_0"></span>[1](#fn_0.md). Taking the book, he
copied it in the Scriptorium or library, or took it to his cell, where
he wrote all winter without a fire. It is to such monks that we owe all
our knowledge of the earliest history of England and Ireland; though
doubtless the hand that wrote the histories of Gildas and Bede grew as
tired as that of Brandan, or as that of the monk who wrote in the corner
of a beautiful manuscript: "He who does not know how to write imagines
it to be no labor; but though only three fingers hold the pen, the whole
body grows weary." In the same way Brandan may have learned music and
have had an organ in his monastery, or have had a school of art,
painting beautiful miniatures for the holy missals. This was his early
life in the convent.

Once a day they were called to food; this consisting for them of bread
and vegetables with no seasoning but salt, although better fare was
furnished for the sick and the aged, for

<span id="page_111">p. 111</span>

travellers and the poor. These last numbered, at Easter time, some three
or four hundred, who constantly came and went, and upon whom the monks
and young disciples waited. After the meal the monks spent three hours
in the chapel, on their knees, still silent; then they confessed in turn
to the abbot and then sought their hard-earned rest. They held all
things in common; no one even received a gift for himself. War never
reached them; it was the rarest thing for an armed party to molest their
composure; their domains were regarded as a haven for the stormy world.
Because there were so many such places in Ireland, it was known as The
Isle of Saints.

Brandan was sent after a time to other abbeys, where he could pursue
especial studies, for they had six branches of learning,--grammar,
rhetoric, dialectics, geometry, astronomy, and music. Thus he passed
three years, and was then advised to go to an especial teacher in the
mountains, who had particular modes of teaching certain branches. But
this priest--he was an Italian--was suffering from poverty,

<span id="page_112">p. 112</span>

and could receive his guest but for a few weeks. One day as Brandan sat
studying, he saw, the legend says, a white mouse come from a crack in
the wall, a visitor which climbed upon his table and left there a grain
of wheat. Then the mouse paused, looked at the student, then ran about
the table, went away and reappeared with another grain, and another, up
to five. Brandan, who had at the very instant learned his lesson, rose
from his seat, followed the mouse, and looking through a hole in the
wall, saw a great pile of wheat, stored in a concealed apartment. On his
showing this to the head of the convent, it was pronounced a miracle;
the food was distributed to the poor, and "the people blessed his
charity while the Lord blessed his studies."

In the course of years, Brandan became himself the head of one of the
great abbeys, that of Clonfert, of the order of St. Benedict, where he
had under him nearly three thousand monks. In this abbey, having one day
given hospitality to a monk named Berinthus, who had just returned from
an ocean voyage, Brandan learned

<span id="page_113">p. 113</span>

from him the existence, far off in the ocean, of an island called The
Delicious Isle, to which a priest named Mernoc had retired, with many
companions of his order. Berinthus found Mernoc and the other monks
living apart from one another for purposes of prayer, but when they came
together, Mernoc said, they were like bees from different beehives. They
met for their food and for church; their food included only apples,
nuts, and various herbs. One day Mernoc said to Berinthus, "I will
conduct you to the Promised Isle of the Saints." So they went on board a
little ship and sailed westward through a thick fog until a great light
shone and they found themselves near an island which was large and
fruitful and bore many apples. There were no herbs without blossoms, he
said, nor trees without fruits, and there were precious stones, and the
island was traversed by a great river. Then they met a man of shining
aspect who told them that they had without knowing it passed a year
already in the island; that they had needed neither food nor sleep. Then
they returned to the Delicious Island, and every one

<span id="page_114">p. 114</span>

knew where they had been by the perfume of their garments. This was the
story of Berinthus, and from this time forward nothing could keep
Brandan from the purpose of beholding for himself these blessed islands.

Before carrying out his plans, however, he went, about the year 560, to
visit an abbot named Enda, who lived at Arran, then called Isle of the
Saints, a priest who was supposed to know more than any one concerning
the farther lands of the western sea. He knew, for instance, of the
enchanted island named Hy-Brasail, which could be seen from the coast of
Ireland only once in seven years, and which the priests had vainly tried
to disenchant. Some islands, it was believed, had been already
disenchanted by throwing on them a few sparks of lighted turf; but as
Hy-Brasail was too far for this, there were repeated efforts to
disenchant it by shooting fiery arrows towards it, though this had not
yet been successful. Then Enda could tell of wonderful ways to cross the
sea without a boat, how his sister Fanchea had done it by spreading her
own cloak upon the waves,

<span id="page_115">p. 115</span>

and how she and three other nuns were borne upon it. She found, however,
that one hem of the cloak sank below the water, because one of her
companions had brought with her, against orders, a brazen vessel from
the convent; but on her throwing it away, the sinking hem rose to the
level of the rest and bore them safely. St. Enda himself had first
crossed to Arran on a large stone which he had ordered his followers to
place on the water and which floated before the wind; and he told of
another priest who had walked on the sea as on a meadow and plucked
flowers as he went. Hearing such tales, how could St. Brandan fear to
enter on his voyage?

He caused a boat to be built of a fashion which one may still see in
Welsh and Irish rivers, and known as a curragh or coracle; made of an
osier frame covered with tanned and oiled skins. He took with him
seventeen priests, among whom was St. Malo, then a mere boy, but
afterwards celebrated. They sailed to the southwest, and after being
forty days at sea they reached a rocky island furrowed with streams,
where they received the kindest hospitality, and

<span id="page_116">p. 116</span>

took in fresh provisions. They sailed again the next day, and found
themselves entangled in contrary currents and perplexing winds, so that
they were long in reaching another island, green and fertile, watered by
rivers which were full of fish, and covered with vast herds of sheep as
large as heifers. Here they renewed their stock of provisions, and chose
a spotless lamb with which to celebrate Easter Sunday on another island,
which they saw at a short distance.

This island was wholly bare, without sandy shores or wooded slopes, and
they all landed upon it to cook their lamb; but when they had arranged
their cooking-apparatus, and when their fire began to blaze, the island
seemed to move beneath their feet, and they ran in terror to their boat,
from which Brandan had not yet landed. Their supposed island was a
whale, and they rowed hastily away from it toward the island they had
left, while the whale glided away, still showing, at a distance of two
miles, the fire blazing on his back.

The next island they visited was wooded and fertile, where they found a
multitude of birds,

<span id="page_117">p. 117</span>

which chanted with them the praises of the Lord, so that they called
this the Paradise of Birds.

This was the description given of this island by an old writer named
Wynkyn de Worde, in "The Golden Legend":--

"Soon after, as God would, they saw a fair island, full of flowers,
herbs, and trees, whereof they thanked God of his good grace; and anon
they went on land, and when they had gone long in this, they found a
full fayre well, and thereby stood a fair tree full of boughs, and on
every bough sat a fayre bird, and they sat so thick on the tree that
uneath \[scarcely\] any leaf of the tree might be seen. The number of
them was so great, and they sang so merrilie, that it was an heavenlie
noise to hear. Whereupon St. Brandan kneeled down on his knees and wept
for joy, and made his praise devoutlie to our Lord God, to know what
these birds meant. And then anon one of the birds flew from the tree to
St. Brandan, and he with the flickering of his wings made a full merrie
noise like a fiddle, that him seemed he never heard so joyful a melodie.
And then St. Brandan commanded

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

the foule to tell him the cause why they sat so thick on the tree and
sang so merrilie. And then the foule said, some time we were angels in
heaven, but when our master, Lucifer, fell down into hell for his high
pride, and we fell with him for our offences, some higher and some
lower, after the quality of the trespasse. And because our trespasse is
so little, therefore our Lord hath sent us here, out of all paine, in
full great joy and mirthe, after his pleasing, here to serve him on this
tree in the best manner we can. The Sundaie is a daie of rest from all
worldly occupation, and therefore that day all we be made as white as
any snow, for to praise our Lorde in the best wise we may. And then all
the birds began to sing evensong so merrilie that it was an heavenlie
noise to hear; and after supper St. Brandan and his fellows went to bed
and slept well. And in the morn they arose by times, and then those
foules began mattyns, prime, and hours, and all such service as
Christian men used to sing; and St. Brandan, with his fellows, abode
there seven weeks, until Trinity Sunday was passed."

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

Having then embarked, they wandered for months on the ocean, before
reaching another island. That on which they finally landed was inhabited
by monks who had as their patrons St. Patrick and St. Ailbée, and they
spent Christmas there. A year passed in these voyages, and the tradition
is that for six other years they made just the same circuit, always
spending Holy Week at the island where they found the sheep, alighting
for Easter on the back of the same patient whale, visiting the Isle of
Birds at Pentecost, and reaching the island of St. Patrick and St.
Ailbée in time for Christmas.

But in the seventh year they met with wholly new perils. They were
attacked, the legend says, first by a whale, then by a griffin, and then
by a race of cyclops, or one-eyed giants. Then they came to an island
where the whale which had attacked them was thrown on shore, so that
they could cut him to pieces; then another island which had great
fruits, and was called The Island of the Strong Man; and lastly one
where the grapes filled the air with

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

perfume. After this they saw an island, all cinders and flames, where
the cyclops had their forges, and they sailed away in the light of an
immense fire. The next day they saw, looking northward, a great and high
mountain sending out flames at the top. Turning hastily from this
dreadful sight, they saw a little round island, at the top of which a
hermit dwelt, who gave them his benediction. Then they sailed southward
once more, and stopped at their usual places of resort for Holy Week,
Easter, and Whitsuntide.

It was on this trip that they had, so the legend says, that strange
interview with Judas Iscariot, out of which Matthew Arnold has made a
ballad. Sailing in the wintry northern seas at Christmas time, St.
Brandan saw an iceberg floating by, on which a human form rested
motionless; and when it moved at last, he saw by its resemblance to the
painted pictures he had seen that it must be Judas Iscariot, who had
died five centuries before. Then as the boat floated near the iceberg,
Judas spoke and told him his tale. After he

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

had betrayed Jesus Christ, after he had died, and had been consigned to
the flames of hell,--which were believed in very literally in those
days,--an angel came to him on Christmas night and said that he might go
thence and cool himself for an hour. "Why this mercy?" asked Judas
Iscariot. Then the angel said to him, "Remember the leper in Joppa," and
poor Judas recalled how once when the hot wind, called the sirocco,
swept through the streets of Joppa, and he saw a naked leper by the
wayside, sitting in agony from the heat and the drifting sand, Judas had
thrown his cloak over him for a shelter and received his thanks. In
reward for this, the angel now told him, he was to have, once a year, an
hour's respite from his pain; he was allowed in that hour to fling
himself on an iceberg and cool his burning heat as he drifted through
the northern seas. Then St. Brandan bent his head in prayer; and when he
looked up, the hour was passed, and Judas had been hurried back into his
torments.

It seems to have been only after seven years

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

of this wandering that they at last penetrated within the obscure fogs
which surrounded the Isle of the Saints, and came upon a shore which lay
all bathed in sunny light. It was a vast island, sprinkled with precious
stones, and covered with ripe fruits; they traversed it for forty days
without arriving at the end, though they reached a great river which
flowed through the midst of it from east to west. There an angel
appeared to them, and told them that they could go no farther, but could
return to their own abode, carrying from the island some of those fruits
and precious stones which were reserved to be distributed among the
saints when all the world should be brought to the true faith. In order
to hasten that time, it appears that St. Malo, the youngest of the
sea-faring monks, had wished, in his zeal, to baptize some one, and had
therefore dug up a heathen giant who had been, for some reason, buried
on the blessed isle. Not only had he dug the giant's body up, but St.
Malo had brought him to life again sufficiently for the purpose of
baptism and instruction in the true faith; after which he gave him the
name

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

of Mildus, and let him die once more and be reburied. Then, facing
homeward and sailing beyond the fog, they touched once more at The
Island of Delights, received the benediction of the abbot of the
monastery, and sailed for Ireland to tell their brethren of the wonders
they had seen.

He used to tell them especially to his nurse Ita, under whose care he
had been placed until his fifth year. His monastery at Clonfert grew, as
has been said, to include three thousand monks; and he spent his
remaining years in peace and sanctity. The supposed islands which he
visited are still believed by many to have formed a part of the American
continent, and he is still thought by some Irish scholars to have been
the first to discover this hemisphere, nearly a thousand years before
Columbus, although this view has not yet made much impression on
historians. The Paradise of Birds, in particular, has been placed by
these scholars in Mexico, and an Irish poet has written a long poem
describing the delights to be found there:--

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

"Oft, in the sunny mornings, have I seen  
  Bright yellow birds, of a rich lemon hue,  
Meeting in crowds upon the branches green,  
  And sweetly singing all the morning through;  
And others, with their heads grayish and dark,  
  Pressing their cinnamon cheeks to the old trees,  
And striking on the hard, rough, shrivelled bark,  
  Like conscience on a bosom ill at ease.

"And diamond-birds chirping their single notes,  
  Now ’mid the trumpet-flower's deep blossoms seen,  
Now floating brightly on with fiery throats--  
  Small winged emeralds of golden green;  
And other larger birds with orange cheeks,  
  A many-color-painted, chattering crowd,  
Prattling forever with their curved beaks,  
  And through the silent woods screaming aloud."
