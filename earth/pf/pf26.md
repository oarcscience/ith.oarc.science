To the first men, if the Garden of Eden was located at the Pole, there
could have been but one day and one night in a year. Moreover, at the
break of that strange day the sun must have risen, not in the East, as
in postdiluvian times, but in the South. Do the traditions or sacred
books of the ancient world afford any hint of such a sunrise and of such
an Eden day?

A partial answer to this question is found in the beliefs of the ancient
Northmen. A learned Danish writer pronounces it "remarkable" that the
Scandinavian mythology informs us that, before the establishment of the
present order of the world, the sun, which now rises in the East, "*rose
in the South*." <span id="fr_263"></span>[1](#fn_263.md)

Equally striking confirmations appear in other mythologies. Turning to
the second Fargard of the Avesta, we find the most ancient Iranian
account of Yima, the first man and "the King of the Golden Age." A
detailed account is also given of a certain

<span id="page_198">p. 198</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Vara, or
inclosure, which as a safe habitation—a kind of Garden of Eden—he was
divinely commanded to make. Then comes this singular question and
answer: "O Maker of the material world, thou Holy One! What lights are
there in the Vara which Yima made?"

"Ahura Mazda answered: There are uncreated lights and created lights.
There the stars, the moon, and the sun are only *once a year* seen to
rise and set, and *a year seems only as a day*." <span
id="fr_264"></span>[1](#fn_264.md) Haug's version of the last clause is,
"And they think that a day which is a year." <span
id="fr_265"></span>[2](#fn_265.md) Spiegel's is the same, <span
id="fr_266"></span>[3](#fn_266.md) although in his Commentary he confesses
himself perplexed as to the meaning of so remarkable a declaration. "The
really genuine words," he observes, "are very difficult." They are not
so when once the key is found.

That the East Aryans had the same idea is also evident from the Laws of
Manu. Among this people Yama—the same as the Iranian Yima—was the first
man. His first abode, as we have seen, was at the North Pole, and at
death he became a god, the guardian of the South Pole, at which was the
region of the dead. But though the Hindus no longer associated him with
the North at the time of the writing of this ancient book, they well
understood that Yama's primitive Eden in Ilâvrita, around the north
polar Meru, where the gods reside, has only one day and one night in the
year. This is the language of the Code: "A year of mortals is a day

<span id="page_199">p. 199</span>

and a night of the gods, or regents of the universe seated around the
North Pole; and again their division is this: their day is the northern
and their night the southern course of the sun." <span
id="fr_267"></span>[1](#fn_267.md)

In like manner, in the Sûrya Siddhânta we read, "The gods behold the
sun, after it is once arisen, for half a year." <span
id="fr_268"></span>[2](#fn_268.md)

Equally unmistakable is the language of the probably more ancient work,
lately translated under the title of "The Institutes of Vishnu:"—

"The northern progress of the sun is a day with the gods.

"The southern progress of the sun is (with them) a night.

"A year is (with them) a day and a night." <span
id="fr_269"></span>[3](#fn_269.md)

<span id="page_200">p. 200</span>

This strange notion is perfectly clear and comprehensible the moment we
assume that the long-lived fathers and first regents of the human race
originally dwelt at the North Pole, and that these, apotheosized and
glorified in the imagination of later generations, in time became the
gods which ancient nations worshiped.

Both in the Iliad and Odyssey the learned Anton Krichenbauer finds two
kinds of days continually referred to. In what he considers the more
ancient portions of the poems, the day is a period of one year's
duration, especially when used in describing the life and exploits of
the gods; in what he considers the more modern portions, the term has
its modern meaning as a period of twenty-four hours. He quotes Lepsius
as recognizing a similar "one-day year" in the Egyptian and other
ancient chronologies; also the mention made of it by Palaifatos and
Suidas. <span id="fr_270"></span>[1](#fn_270.md)

In all such hitherto unnoticed testimonies—and we have not exhausted the
list of them <span id="fr_271"></span>[2](#fn_271.md)—we have new and
singularly unimpeachable evidences that in the thought of these ancient
peoples the land in which the generated gods and men alike originated
was a land in which, as in our Polar Eden, a day and a night filled out
the year. And if such was their

<span id="page_201">p. 201</span>

idea, whence, save from actual tradition, could they have derived it? As
cautious a scientific authority as Sir Charles Lyell, speaking of these
cosmological and chronological traditions of the Hindus, says: "We can
by no means look upon them as a pure effort of the unassisted
imagination, or believe them to have been composed without regard to
opinions and theories *founded on the observation of Nature*." <span
id="fr_272"></span>[1](#fn_272.md)

Even where the tradition has become distorted or inverted among
barbarians, the parallelism of the year and the day is not always lost.
A curious instance of this has come under the notice of the writer since
the present chapter was begun: "In those days (in the world before the
present) the seasons were much shorter than they are now. A year then
was but as a day of our time." <span id="fr_273"></span>[2](#fn_273.md)

alternate approaches and recessions of the sun we have the true
explanation of the origin of the old Rabbinical idea of half-yearly cold
and heat in hell, this latter being located, as we have shown, at the
South Pole: "The great Jalkut Rubeni gives us the following account of
hell: Sheol is *half fire* and *half hail*, and therein are many rivers
of fire. The seven abodes (or divisions) of hell are very spacious; and
in each there are seven rivers of fire and seven rivers of hail. The
uppermost abode is sixty times less than the second, and thus the second
is sixty times larger than the first, and every abode is sixty times
larger than that which precedes it. In each abode are seven thousand
caverns, and in each cavern seven thousand clefts, and in each cleft
seven thousand scorpions; and each scorpion hath seven limbs, and on
each limb are one thousand barrels of gall. There are likewise seven
rivers of rankest poison, which when a man toucheth he bursteth; and the
destroying angels judge him and scourge him every moment, *half a year*
in the fire and *half a year* in the hail and snow. And the cold is more
intolerable than the fire." Eisenmenger, *Entdecktes Judenthum*, vol.
ii., p. 345 (English translation, vol. ii., p. 52). According to the
*Sûrya Siddânta*, the demons as well as the gods behold the sun for six
months at a time.
