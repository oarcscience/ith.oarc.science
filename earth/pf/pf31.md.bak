### CHAPTER VII.

#### THE EXUBERANCE OF LIFE.

<span class="small">*And the Lord God planted a garden. And out of the
ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the
sight and good for food*.—The Book of Genesis.</span>

<span class="small">*Moreover, there were a great number of elephants in
the island; and there was provision for animals of every kind. Also
whatever fragrant things there are in the earth, whether roots, or
herbage, or woods, or distilling drops of flowers or fruits, grew and
thrived in that land*.—The Critias of Plato.</span>

<span class="small">*Wie verkehrt man überhaupt geht, wenn man lediglich
aus dem Kreise unsrer jetzigen Erfahrung die Urwelt construiren will,
haben uns die paläontologischen Entdeckungen der neuern Zeit gelehrt,
die eben in der Urwelt uns die riesenhaftesten and wunderbarsten
Thiergestalten vorführen*.—<span class="smallcaps">Dr. H.
Lüken</span>.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">According</span> to all ancient traditions and
beliefs, the cradle of the human race was in a portion of the world
characterized by an altogether extraordinary exuberance of life. Of all
lands the sun shone upon it was the fairest and best. Even down to the
Deluge, and later, something of the divine goodness of that primeval
home-land remained. In the eyes of Plato, the steady deterioration has
been going on from the beginning, the good soil washing down from the
heavenly mountains of the earth's summit and disappearing in the abyss,
until, "in comparison with what then was, there are remaining only the
bones of the wasted body, as they may be called,—all the richer and
softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skeleton of
the land being left." <span id="fr_468"></span>[1](#fn_468.md)

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

The deterioration of the climate of the mother-region of the race is
particularly described in the first Fargard of the Avesta: "The first of
the good lands and countries which I, Ahura Mazda, created was the
Airyana Vaêjô \[Aîran Vêj, "Iran the Ancient "\] by the good river
Dâitya. Thereupon came Angra Mainyu \[Ahriman\], who is all death, and
he counter-created by his witchcraft the serpent in the river, and
winter, a work of the daêvas. There are \[now\] ten winter months there,
two summer months, and these are cold for the waters, cold for the
earth, and cold for the trees." <span id="fr_469"></span>[1](#fn_469.md) So
in Fargard second we have a legendary account of the successive
migrations of the earliest remembered men out of the original North
country "*southwards*, to meet the sun," and nearly all commentators
ascribe these repeated "southward" movements to the gradual
refrigeration and glaciation of the primitive home in "Iran the
Ancient." <span id="fr_470"></span>[2](#fn_470.md)

The same idea of a perfect primeval climate is found among all ancient
peoples. Ovid represents

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

the spring, in Saturn's reign, to have been perennial. The spring of our
world-age is only an abbreviated reminder of that great original. <span
id="fr_471"></span>[1](#fn_471.md) So Lactantius has preserved a fragment
of the old ethnic creed when he tells us that only upon the loss of
Paradise, darkness and winter came over the earth. <span
id="fr_472"></span>[2](#fn_472.md)

With this supposed deterioration of soil and climate the deterioration
of man kept pace. Hence ancient writers, with hardly an exception,
represent the men of their own day as far inferior in stature, in
strength, and in longevity to the first progenitors of the race. Hesiod,
Aratus, Ovid, Vergil, and Claudian vary somewhat in their accounts of
the Golden, Silver, and later ages of human history, but all agree in
representing the men of their time as weak and puny and short-lived,
compared with men of the early ages of the world. Juvenal, in a
well-known passage, alludes to Homer's judgment, and expresses his own:

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">"Nam genus hoc vivo jam decrescebat Homero,  
 Terra malos homines nunc educat atque pusillos." <span
id="fr_473"></span>[3](#fn_473.md)</span>

</div>

Plato, speaking of the antediluvians, says, "For many generations, as
long as the divine nature lasted in them, they were obedient to the
laws, and well affectioned toward the gods who were their kinsmen; for
they possessed true and in every way great spirits, practicing
gentleness and wisdom in the various chances of life and in their
intercourse with one another. . . . By such reflections, and by the
continuance in them of the divine nature, all that

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

we have described waxed and increased in them; but when this divine
portion began to fade away in them, and became diluted too often, and
with too much of the mortal admixture, and the human nature got the
upper hand, they, being unable to bear their fortune, became unseemly,
and to him who had an eye to see they began to appear base, and had lost
the fairest of their precious gifts." <span
id="fr_474"></span>[1](#fn_474.md)

The ancient Indian conception of the world's decadence from period to
period is given in the "Laws of Manu." <span
id="fr_475"></span>[2](#fn_475.md) Of the four great ages of the life of
the present universe, we are living in the last and worst. In the first
*yuga* all men were holy; in the present all are utterly corrupt and
vile. In the first they were tall and long-lived; in each succeeding age
they have grown dwarfed and feeble.

Similar to the Indian was the Iranian belief as reflected in the
Bundahish. Here the duration of the universe is represented as filling
four world-periods of three thousand years each. During the first of the
four all is pure and sinless, but at its close the Evil One declares war
against Ahura Mazda, the holy God, which war is destined to fill the
three last ages. During the first of the three, the Evil One is
unsuccessful; during the second, good and evil are exactly balanced;
while in the last, which is our own, evil obtains, and till the destined
overthrow at the very end maintains supremacy. <span
id="fr_476"></span>[3](#fn_476.md)

The conception which we are noticing is as old as it is universal.
Berosus, reporting the earliest traditions

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

of Chaldæa, represents the first men as of extraordinary stature and
strength, and as retaining in lessening degree these characteristics
until some generations after the Flood. <span
id="fr_477"></span>[1](#fn_477.md) "Among the Egyptians," says Lenormant,
"the terrestrial reign of the god Râ, who inaugurated the existence of
the world and of human life, was a Golden Age, to which they continually
looked back with regret and envy: to assert the superiority of anything
above all that imagination could set forth, it was sufficient to affirm
that 'its like had never been seen since the days of the god Râ.' The
same idea is found again in the Egyptian account of the succession of
the terrestrial reigns of the gods, the demi-gods, heroes, and men, as
collected from the fragments of Manetho, and corroborated by the
testimony of native texts." <span id="fr_478"></span>[2](#fn_478.md) In
China, too, the catholic ethnic faith in a primeval Golden Age was not
lacking, so that everywhere the eldest traditions—be they Shemitic,
Aryan, or Turanian—support, confirm, and illustrate the representations
of the Bible touching the extraordinary pristine vitality of Edenic
nature and of antediluvian man. So overwhelming is the evidence that
this universal belief of antiquity is a reminiscence of primitive
reality, that one who expressly disclaims a personal belief in the
superior stature of the early men nevertheless asserts that "the
universality of the popular belief attests its very ancient origin," and
adds that "it may unhesitatingly be ranked among those originating at a
time when the great civilized peoples of a remote antiquity, still
clustering

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

about the cradle of the race, enjoyed a contact sufficiently close for
some common traditions." <span id="fr_479"></span>[1](#fn_479.md)

The bearing of this unanimous verdict of ancient tradition upon the
problem of the location of Eden is obvious. The traditions of the whole
ethnic world, not less than the record in Genesis, require that the
cradle of the race be placed in the one spot on earth where the
biological conditions are the most favorable possible. According to all
procurable data, that spot at the era of man's appearance upon the stage
was in the now lost "Miocene continent," which then surrounded the
Arctic Pole. That in that true, original Eden some of the early
generations of men attained to a stature and longevity unequaled in any
countries known to postdiluvian history is by no means scientifically
incredible. On the contrary, the exceptional biological conditions of
that land and the remarkable consensus of all tradition respecting the
vigor of early giant races combine to form a fresh illustration of the
principle that the more incredible things an hypothesis explains, the
more irresistibly credible the hypothesis itself becomes.

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

Back in that far-off foretime, even in the lower latitudes, life was
remarkably luxuriant. The paleontologists almost exhaust the resources
of language in the effort to describe it. Thus, on a single page,
Professor Alleyne Nicholson, of St. Andrew's University, says: "The life
of the Miocene period is *extremely abundant*, also *extremely varied*
in its character. . . . The marine beds have yielded *numerous* remains
of both vertebrate and invertebrate sea-animals, . . . *an enormous
number* of plants. . . . The remains of air-breathing animals are also
*abundantly* found. . . . The plants of the Miocene period are
*extraordinarily numerous*. . . . The plant-remains . . . indicate an
*extraordinarily rank and luxuriant* vegetation," etc. <span
id="fr_480"></span>[1](#fn_480.md) Figuier gives the following
illustration: "The Lycopods of our age are humble plants, scarcely a
yard in height and most common creepers; but those of the ancient world
were trees of eighty or ninety feet in height." <span
id="fr_481"></span>[2](#fn_481.md) But we have before seen that the
mother-region of all the abounding and varied floral and faunal types
was within the Arctic Circle, and from their amazing exuberance in low
latitudes we may form some conception of the yet superior potencies of
life which were at work in that more highly favored circumpolar,
seed-plot of the whole earth.

In our last chapter it was suggested that the Tree in the midst of
Paradise may have been as lofty as one of the giant Sequoias of
California. The comparison was not made at random. In the Miocene
remains in Britain, conifers are especially numerous. And "the most
abundant of these is a gigantic pine,

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

the *Sequoia Couttsiæ*, which is very nearly allied to the huge *Sequoia
gigantea* of California. A nearly allied form, *Sequoia Langsdorfii*,
has been detected in the Hebrides." <span
id="fr_482"></span>[1](#fn_482.md) From the latitude of the Sequoia grove
in Mariposa County, California, to that of the Hebrides is a long stride
toward the Pole; but we are not left to mere inference when we raise the
question whether the original starting-point of this gigantic
tree-species may not have been still higher in the Arctic regions. The
Miocene fossils of the highest attainable Arctic latitudes tell their
own story. Limited as have been the explorations among these fossils, as
Sir Charles Lyell remarks, "more than *thirty species* of Coniferæ have
been found, *including several Sequoias allied to the gigantic
Wellingtonia* of California. . . . There are also beeches, oaks, planes,
poplars, walnuts, limes, and even a magnolia, two cones of which have
lately been obtained, proving that this splendid evergreen not only
lived, but ripened its fruit, within the Arctic Circle. Many of the
limes, planes, and oaks were large-leaved species, and both flowers and
fruits, besides immense quantities of leaves, are in many cases
preserved. . . . Even in Spitzbergen, within 12° of the Pole, no less
than *ninety-five* species of fossil plants have been obtained." The
vigor of the vegetable life of the Miocene age in these Arctic regions
impresses the veteran geologist as "truly remarkable."

We have a right, then, not only to draw a conclusion from the "abundant"
and "extraordinarily rank and luxuriant vegetation" of the Arctic
regions in Miocene time, but also to learn a special lesson from

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

the gigantic forms which linger on our Western coast. Had the book of
Genesis described one of the trees of Eden as three hundred and twenty
feet in height and thirty feet in diameter at the base, not only all the
Voltaires of modern history, but also—until the discovery of
California—all naturalists of the advanced anti-Christian variety, would
have made no end of sport over the unscientific or mythical "Botany of
Moses." But the *Sequoia gigantea* is a living, indisputable fact.
Though not the oldest of the Coniferæ, it illustrates some of the
earlier possibilities of vegetable life. It tells the botanist that
growths once realized in great abundance are dying out, and unless
perpetuated by human care are soon to disappear from our globe forever.
Its last surviving representatives in the state of nature, preserved to
our day by certain fortunate local conditions and by their own inherent
longevity, are witnesses respecting a far-off world,—witnesses whose
testimony the most incredulous must accept. They tell of the far-away
dawn of the day of man, they bear testimony to the extraordinary life
which characterized their distant birth-land. <span
id="fr_483"></span>[1](#fn_483.md) And if these last *individuals* of an
expiring race can maintain, under unfavorable biological conditions, a
vigorous life *through two millenniums of time*, who shall declare it
impossible that

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

the men of the time and place of the origination of the Sequoia gigantea
should have averaged more than six feet in stature, or attained to an
age quite surpassing our threescore years and ten? As to the latter
point, it would require more than the combined lives of two Methuselahs
to watch the growth and death of a single tree like those of California.
The thought is not the incubation of the present writer; it is what the
trees themselves said to the foremost botanist of America. <span
id="fr_484"></span>[1](#fn_484.md)

But the exuberance of animal life in the Miocene period is not less
remarkable. We quote the same author as before: "The Invertebrate
animals of this period are *very numerous*. . . . The little shells of
the Foraminifera are *extremely abundant*. . . . Corals are *very
abundant*, in many instances forming regular reefs. . . . *Numerous*
crabs and lobsters represent the Crustacea. . . . Of Insects *more than
thirteen hundred species* have been determined by Dr. Heer from the
Miocene strata of Switzerland alone. . . . The Mollusca are *very
numerous*. . . . Polyzoans

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

are *abundant*. Bivalves and Univalves are *extremely plentiful*. . . .
The Fishes of the period are *very abundant*. . . . The remains of
Reptiles are *far from uncommon*. . . . The Land-tortoises make their
first appearance during this period. The most remarkable form of this
group is the *huge Colossochelys Atlas* of the Upper Miocene deposits of
the Siwâlik Hills in India, described by Dr. Falconer and Sir Proby
Cautley. *Far exceeding any living tortoise in its dimensions*, this
*enormous* animal is estimated as having had a length of about twenty
feet, measured from the tip of the snout to the extremity of the tail,
and to have stood upwards of seven feet. . . . The accomplished
paleontologists just quoted show further that some of the traditions of
the Hindus would render it not improbable that this *colossal* Tortoise
survived into the earlier portion of the human period. . . . The Mammals
of the Miocene are *very numerous*. . . . The *Edentates* (Sloths, etc.)
are represented by two *large* European forms. One of these is the
*large Macrotherium giganteum*. . . . The other is the *still more
gigantic Ancylotherium Pentelici*, which seems to have been *as large
as, or larger than, the rhinoceros*. . . . We may also note here the
first appearance of true 'whalebone *Whales*,' two species of which,
resembling the living 'Right Whale' of the Arctic seas, and belonging to
the same genus, have been detected in the Miocene beds of North America.
. . . The great order of the Ungulates, or hoofed quadrupeds, is *very
largely developed* in strata of the Miocene age, various new types
making their appearance here for the first time. . . . We meet for the
first time with representatives of the family *Rhinoceridæ*, comprising
the only existing rhinoceroses. . . .

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The family of the
Tapirs is represented, . . . some of which were quite diminutive in
point of size, whilst others attained *the dimensions of a horse*.
Nearly allied to this family, also, is the singular group of quadrupeds
which Marsh had described under the name of *Brontotheridæ*. These
extraordinary animals, typified by Brontotherium itself, agree with . .
. and differ from the existing Tapirs. . . . *Brontotherium gigas* is
said to be nearly *as large as an elephant*, whilst *Brontotherium
ingens* appears to have attained *dimensions still more gigantic*. The
well-known genus *Titanotherium* would also appear to belong to this
group. . . . The family of the Horses appears under various forms in the
Miocene, but the most important and best known of these is the
Hipparion. . . . Remains of the Hipparion have been found in various
regions in Europe and in India; and from the *immense quantities of
their bones* found in certain localities, it may be safely inferred that
these Middle Tertiary ancestors of the Horse lived, like their modern
representatives, in great herds. . . . Amongst the even-toed Ungulates
we for the first time meet with examples of the *Hippopotamus*, with its
four-toed feet, its massive body, and huge tusk-like lower teeth. . . .
The true Deer, with their solid bony antlers, appear for the first time
here. . . . Perhaps the most remarkable of these Miocene Ruminants is
the *Sivatherium giganteum* of the Siwâlik Hills in India. In this
extraordinary animal there were two pairs of horns. . . . If all these
horns had been simple, there would have been no difficulty in
considering Sivatherium as simply a *gigantic* four-horned Antelope. . .
. It is to the Miocene period that we must refer the first appearance

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

of the important order of the *Elephants* and their allies
(*Proboscidians*). . . . Only three generic groups of this order are
known, namely, the extinct *Deinotherium*, the equally extinct
Mastodons, and the Elephants; and all these three types are known to
have been in existence as early as the Miocene period, the first of them
being exclusively confined to deposits of this age. . . . The most
celebrated skull of the Deinothere is the one which was exhumed from the
Upper Miocene deposits of Epplesheim, in Hesse-Darmstadt, in the year
1836. This skull was four and a half feet in length, and indicated an
animal *larger than any existing species of the Elephant*. . . . Whilst
herbivorous quadrupeds, as we have seen, were *extremely abundant*
during Miocene times, and often attained *gigantic dimensions*, beasts
of prey (*Carnivora*) were *by no means wanting;* most of the existing
families of the order being represented. . . . Weasels and Otters were
not unknown, . . . whilst the great Cats of subsequent periods are more
than adequately represented by the *huge* 'sabre-toothed' Tiger. . . .
Amongst the *Rodent* Mammals . . . *all the principal living groups*
were differentiated in Middle Tertiary times. . . . Lastly, the Monkeys
existed during the Miocene period *under a variety of forms*. . . . The
*Dryopithecus* is referable to the group of 'Anthropoid Apes.' . . .
*Dryopithecus* was also *of large size, equaling Man in stature*, and
apparently living amongst the trees and feeding upon fruits." <span
id="fr_485"></span>[1](#fn_485.md)

It would be easy to heighten the impression of this vigor and luxuriance
of animal life in Tertiary and Post-tertiary times by studying the huge
bird-tracks

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

of the Connecticut sandstone, or the enormous skeletons of the *Dinornis
giganteus* and the *Dinornis elephantopus*, or the eggs of the *Æpiornis
maximus*,—eggs "measuring from thirteen to fourteen inches in
diameter." <span id="fr_486"></span>[1](#fn_486.md) We might consider the
*Diprotodon*, which "in size must have many times exceeded the
dimensions of the largest of its living successors, since the skull
measures no less than three feet in length." <span
id="fr_487"></span>[2](#fn_487.md) Or we might rehabilitate the "colossal"
*Megatherium Cuvieri*, whose "thigh-bone is nearly thrice the thickness
of the same bone in the largest of existing Elephants." <span
id="fr_488"></span>[3](#fn_488.md) Or, again, visiting the Jurassic beds of
our own Colorado, we might contemplate the *Titanosaurus*, one of the
latest discovered of the tenants of the early world, of which Sir John
Lubbock says that it "is perhaps the largest land animal yet known,
being *a hundred feet in length, and at least thirty feet in height*,

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

though it seems possible that even these vast dimensions may have been
surpassed by those of the *Atlantosaurus*," <span
id="fr_489"></span>[1](#fn_489.md) also a late discovery. But why multiply
illustrations? Natural history in our times can produce no species of
fishes, or of amphibians, or of reptiles, or of birds, or—among
mammals—of marsupials, or of edentates, or of ungulates, or of
proboscidians, or of carnivores, or of apes, which in normal dimensions
are not excelled by species of the corresponding orders and classes
belonging to Tertiary and Quaternary ages. And this being so, it is
surely possible and credible that in the same antediluvian ages some of
the varieties of the species *Bimana* may have exceeded in stature its
present average, and enjoyed a corresponding vigor of constitution. At
any rate, it will be soon enough to deny it after human remains of
suitable age shall have been found in the vicinity of the race's origin
and earlier history. So far as past findings are concerned, even
Büchner, who holds that "primitive man was inferior even in corporeal
attributes to the men of the present day," and that "the widely spread
belief in the former existence of a race of human giants is perfectly
erroneous," still has to say, "It is true that some very ancient
skeletons or parts of skeletons have been found, which must have
belonged to *comparatively large and very muscular men*, such, for
example, as the skeleton of the famous Neanderthal man, and the human
bones recently found by M. Louis Lartet in one of the caverns of
Perigord, . . . which seem to indicate a rude but muscular race of
men." <span id="fr_490"></span>[2](#fn_490.md) Again, speaking of the

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

skeleton to which the Neanderthal skull belongs, he says, "The ridges
and crests especially which served as points for insertion of the
muscles are very *strongly developed*, so that we may conclude that
their possessor was a *very strong and muscular man*." <span
id="fr_491"></span>[1](#fn_491.md) It may be added that Carl Vogt, one of
the earliest and most influential of Darwin's German disciples, also
conceived of "the man of the oldest Stone Age" as "*of large stature,
powerful and long-headed*." <span id="fr_492"></span>[2](#fn_492.md)

Here it may be well to remark that the primitive forms of animals, while
often so excelling in size the later forms of their own kind, are by no
means to be thought of as monstrosities. The proportion of a young
child's head to his body is very different from that of an adult's. In
comparison with the grown man, his limbs and hands and feet are
remarkably plump and well rounded. Had a painter never seen and studied
a human being except in the adult and senescent stage, the infant form
would seem to him singularly abnormal. This illustration may help to a
right judgment of certain early types of animals. For "if we take the
earliest known and oldest examples of any given group of animals, it can
sometimes be shown that these primitive forms, *though in themselves
highly organized*, possessed certain characters such as are now only
seen in the *young* of their existing representatives. In technical
language, the early forms of life in some instances possess 'embryonic'
characters, though this does not prevent them often attaining a size
much more gigantic than their nearest living relatives.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

Moreover, the ancient forms of life are often what is called
'*comprehensive types;*' that is to say, they possess characters in
combination such as we nowadays only find separately developed in
different groups of animals. Now this permanent retention of embryonic
characters and this 'comprehensiveness' of structural type are signs of
what a zoölogist considers to be a comparatively 'low' grade of
organization; and the prevalence of these features in the earlier forms
of animals is a very striking phenomenon, *though they are none the less
perfectly organized so far as their own type is concerned*." <span
id="fr_493"></span>[1](#fn_493.md) To put the mistake to be guarded against
in another light, it may be said that whoever considers the departures
of the most ancient forms of animal life from the allied living forms as
abnormal and monstrous in many cases simply takes the types of decadence
and senility by which to test and condemn the plumper and fuller and
fairer types of physical juvenility. In like manner, the "comprehensive"
types can be called monstrous and strange only as these terms might be
applied to the "London Times" by a man who in all his life had never
seen any other specimen of journalism than "The North British
Wool-Growers' Monthly Bulletin," or "The Daily Price-Current of the
Southampton Associated Grocers." What the zoölogist calls the "lowest"
forms of organization are rather the *highest*, if by "highest" we mean
those forms which are most inclusive, *lebenskräftig*, and susceptible
of evolutionary differentiation. <span id="fr_494"></span>[2](#fn_494.md)
The notion that the faunal world at

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

the time of the advent of man was a world of crudities and
monstrosities—a notion to which books and magazines of popularized
science have given an almost universal currency—is therefore entirely
false. <span id="fr_495"></span>[1](#fn_495.md) In the light of profounder
science, the fairest Eden of the oldest legend is, so far as primeval
zoölogy is concerned, more credible than when the study of Paleontology
was first begun.

It must not be forgotten that in all that has now been hinted respecting
the fauna of the early world no account has been taken of more favorable
and less favorable portions of the earth. Paleontologists are but just
beginning to consider that between the biological conditions of the
Arctic regions and those of every other portion of the globe there must
have been, in Pre-Glacial times, the profoundest and most far-reaching
difference. The growths of a region whose day was ten months in length,
and whose night was but two, could not fail to be vastly different

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

from those of the regions where, on the average, almost twelve hours of
every twenty-four are spent in darkness. "Nor can we overlook the fact
that the plants and shells of the Arctic region are eminently
variable." <span id="fr_496"></span>[1](#fn_496.md) If, therefore, in low
latitudes the forms and powers of animal life were what we have seen,
who can undertake to depict its superior exuberance and variety of
manifestation in that primitive polar focus from which all faunal types
proceeded! <span id="fr_497"></span>[2](#fn_497.md)

The Arctic rocks tell of a more wonderful lost Atlantis than Plato's.
The fossil ivory beds of Siberia excel everything of the kind in the
world. From the days of Pliny, at least, they have constantly been
undergoing exploitation, and still they are the chief headquarters of
supply. <span id="fr_498"></span>[3](#fn_498.md) The remains

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

of the mammoth are so abundant that, as Gratacap says, "the northern
islands of Siberia *seem built up of its crowded bones*." <span
id="fr_499"></span>[1](#fn_499.md) Another scientific writer, speaking of
the islands of New Siberia, northward of the mouth of the river Lena,
uses this language: "Large quantities of ivory are dug out of the ground
every year. Indeed, some of the islands are believed *to be nothing but
an accumulation of drift-timber and the bodies of mammoths and other
antediluvian animals frozen together*." <span
id="fr_500"></span>[2](#fn_500.md) So full of these remains is the soil of
these high Arctic regions that the Ostyaks and other ignorant tribes
have an idea that the mammoth is an underground animal ploughing his way
through the earth like a mole, and that he still lives in his
subterranean passages. Nor would there seem to be anything so remarkably
novel in the theory we have advocated in this book, according to which
the submergence of the primeval home of mankind and the introduction of
the great Ice Age are connected with the Deluge: for when, nearly two
hundred years ago, the Russian ambassador, Evert Yssbrants Ides, made
his bold, three-year overland journey to China, he in the high North
found and reported this precise traditionary belief. <span

Summing up the present chapter, then, we have only to say that whoever
accepts the conclusion to which the preceding lines of argument have
conducted us will find no longer a stumbling-block in the latest
revelations of Geology touching the extraordinary life-energies of
far-off ages, and in the hoary myths which tell of giants and Titans and
demigods in Earth's early morning. On the contrary, fossil form and
ethnic myth and sacred page will all be found uniting in a common story.

described are the exact counterpart or "counter-creation" of the
original polar day (the growing season) of ten months, and the original
polar night (or winter of rest from growth) of two months. This is
another incidental evidence that "Iran the Ancient" was situate at the
Pole.

période glaciaire pourrait seule expliquer un tel fait, car on ne
connaît aucune autre cause capable de rendre inhabitable, à cause de
froid, une contrée qui est representée comme ayant été à l’origine un
pays d’excellente nature. On serait donc obligée d’en inférer que les
Éraniens avestiques avaient conservé, non seulement le souvenir de la
période glaciaire, mais aussi celui des beaux jours qui l’ont précédée,

proof that such belief \[in the extraordinary stature of the early men\]
has no real foundation, but is simply a product of the imagination." But
his alleged scientific proof is purely negative, consisting of the fact
that the human skeletons which paleontologists have so far found—*none
of which are from the high North*—are only of ordinary size. "As far
back as we can trace the vestiges of mankind, up to the races who lived
in the Quaternary period side by side with the great mammifers of
extinct species, it may be proved that the medium height of our species
has never exceeded its existent limits." If other early species of
mammifers were gigantic in comparison with their nearest living
representatives of to-day, why may not the mammifer man have illustrated
the same law?

period the Sequoias "*occurred all around the Arctic zone*" (Asa Gray).
Professor J. D. Whitney finds evidence that one of the fallen trees in
Placer County was over 2000 years of age. See his *Yosemite Book;* also
Engler, *Entwickelungsgeschichte der Pflanzenwelt*. Leipsic, 1879-82:
chap. i. and ii. It is also noteworthy that the Australian *Eucalyptus
gigantea*, the only tree which surpasses the Sequoia in height, is found
precisely in that country whose belated living flora and fauna are more
closely related to the northern types of the early world than are any
other.

<span id="fn_484"></span>[288:1](pf31.htm#fr_484.md) "We cannot gaze high
up the huge and venerable trunks, which one crosses the continent to
behold, without wishing that these patriarchs of the grove were able,
like the long-lived antediluvians of Scripture, to hand down to us
through a few generations the traditions of centuries, and so tell us
somewhat of the history of their race. Fifteen hundred annual layers
have been counted or satisfactorily made out upon one or two fallen
trunks. It is probable that close to the heart of some of the living
trees may be found the circle that records the year of the Saviour's
nativity. A few generations of such trees might carry the history a long
way back. But the ground they stand on and the marks of very recent
geologic change and vicissitude in the region around testify that not
very many such generations can have flourished just here, at least in
unbroken series."—Professor Asa Gray, LL. D., "The Sequoia and its
History." *Proceedings of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science*, 1872, p. 6.

<span id="fn_486"></span>[292:1](pf31.htm#fr_486.md) The fact that fossil
remains of these gigantic extinct birds have been found only in the
Southern hemisphere militates in no wise against the doctrine that the
species originated in the highest North. For (1) birds are the best
equipped of all creatures for migration to the remotest parts of the
earth. (2.) The Connecticut Valley sandstones, in the Northern
hemisphere, preserve the tracks of birds "which must have been of
colossal dimensions," the tracks being 22 inches in length and 12 in
breadth, with a proportionate length of stride. "These measurements
indicate a foot four times as large as that of the African Ostrich."
(3.) These tracks were made in the Triassic period, while the remains
found in New Zealand and adjacent regions belong to the much more recent
Post-pliocene period, thus giving a long lapse of years for the spread
or migration of the species from the latitude of the Connecticut Valley
to that of the most Southern lands. Compare Geikie: "The higher fauna of
Australia is more nearly akin to that which flourished in Europe far
back in Mesozoic time than to the living fauna of any other region of
the globe." *Geology*, p. 619.

of leading types of life are rarely embryonic. On the contrary, they
often appear in highly perfect and specialized forms; often, however, of
composite type, and expressing <span id="page_296">p. 296</span>
characters afterwards so separated as to belong to higher groups. . . .
The bald and contemptuous negation of these facts by Haeckel and other
biologists does not tend to give geologists much confidence in their
dicta."—Principal J. W. Dawson, in his "Presidential Address before the
American Association for the Advancement of Science." *Science*,
Cambridge, Mass., Aug. 17, 1883: p. 195.

<span id="fn_495"></span>[296:1](pf31.htm#fr_495.md) "Dr. Hooker observes,
in his recent introductory essay on the Flora of Australia, that it is
impossible to establish a parallel between the successive appearances of
vegetable forms in time and their complexity of structure or
specialization of organs as represented by the successively higher
groups in the natural method of classification. He also adds that the
earliest recognizable cryptograms are not only the highest now existing,
but have more highly differentiated vegetative organs than any
subsequently appearing, and that the dicotyledonous embryo and perfect
exogenous wood, with the highest specialized tissue known (the
coniferous with glandular tissue), preceded the monocotyledonous embryo
and endogenous wood in date of appearance on the globe,—facts wholly
opposed to the doctrine of progression."—Sir Charles Lyell, *The
Antiquity of Man*, p. 404.

<span id="fn_497"></span>[297:2](pf31.htm#fr_497.md) This "eminent"
*variableness* of Arctic life has its bearing upon the scientific
credibility of prehistoric Arctic giants. At the present day, and in our
own latitudes, men occasionally appear whose stature is four or five
times the height of the smallest adult dwarfs. Accordingly, if we were
to assume two and one half feet as the minimum adult stature in polar
regions in primeval times, *the still prevailing* range of variation
would give us in those times some men from seven and one half to twelve
and one half feet in height. Possibly new fossil evidence on this point
is soon to be afforded us. The following is going the rounds of the
daily press: "A Carson (Nev.) dispatch says, The footprints which were
so much discussed in this country and Europe, and which were originally
pronounced by Dr. Harkness, of the Academy of Sciences, to be those of
mammoths, are now stated by him, after a year's examination, to be only
those of big-footed men." See *Proceedings of the California Academy of
Science*, 1882 (Aug. 7 and 27, Sept. 4, Oct. 2). Nadaillac, in
*Matériaux pour l’Histoire primitive et naturelle de l’Homme*. Paris,
1882: pp. 313-321. Topinard, in *Revue d’Anthropologie*. Paris, 1883:

1883.

<span id="fn_498"></span>[297:3](pf31.htm#fr_498.md) Von Middendorff
(*Reise im Norden and Osten Siberiens*, 1848) reckons the number of the
tusks which now annually come into the market as at least a hundred
pairs, on which Nordenskjöld remarks: <span id="page_298">p. 298</span>
"From this we may infer that during the years that have elapsed since
the Russian conquest of Siberia, useful tusks from more than 20,000
mammoths have been collected." In a note the same writer expresses the
opinion that Von Middendorff's estimate is quite too low, and says that
a single steamer on which he sailed up the Yenisej in 1875 was on that
single trip taking more than one hundred tusks to market. *The Voyage of

Flood, and afterwards, when the climate became colder, had frozen in the
