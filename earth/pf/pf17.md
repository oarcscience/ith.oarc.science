### CHAPTER I.

#### ANCIENT COSMOLOGY AND MYTHICAL GEOGRAPHY.

<span class="small">*Not enough credit has been given to the ancient
astronomers. For instance, Mere is no time within the scope of history
when it was not known that the earth is a sphere, and that the
direction* <span class="smallcaps">DOWN</span> *at different points is
toward the same point at the earth's centre. Current teaching in the
text-books as to the knowledge of astronomy by the ancients is at
fault*. <span id="fr_110"></span>[1](#fn_110.md)—<span

</div>

<span class="smallcaps">Back</span> of every mythological account of
Paradise lies some conception of the world at large, and especially of
the world of men. Rightly to understand and interpret the myths, we must
first understand the world-conception to which they were adjusted.
Unfortunately, the cosmology of the ancients has been totally
misconceived by modern scholars. All our maps of "The World according to
Homer" represent the earth as flat, and as surrounded by a level,
flowing ocean stream. "There can be no doubt," says Bunbury, "that
Homer, in common with all his successors down to the time of Hecatæus,
believed the earth to be a plane of circular form." <span
id="fr_111"></span>[2](#fn_111.md) As to the sky, we are generally taught
that the early Greeks believed it to be a solid metallic vault. <span
id="fr_112"></span>[3](#fn_112.md) Professor

<span id="page_118">p. 118</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> F. A. Paley aids
the imagination of his readers as follows: "We might familiarly
illustrate the Hesiodic notion of the flat circular earth and the convex
overarching sky by a circular plate with a hemispherical dish-cover of
metal placed over it and. concealing it. Above the cover (which is
supposed to rotate on an axis, πόλος) live the gods. Round the inner
concavity is the path of the sun, giving light to the earth
below." <span id="fr_113"></span>[1](#fn_113.md)

That all writers upon Greek mythology, including even the latest, <span
id="fr_114"></span>[2](#fn_114.md) should proceed upon the same assumptions
as the professed Homeric interpreters and geographers building upon
their foundations is only natural. And that the current conceptions of
the cosmology of the ancient Greeks should profoundly affect current
interpretations of the cosmological and geographical data of other
ancient peoples is also precisely what the history and inner
relationships of modern archæological studies would lead one to expect.
It is not surprising, therefore, I that the earth of the Ancient
Hebrews, Egyptians, Indo-Aryans, and other ancient peoples has been
assumed to correspond to the supposed flat earth of the Greeks. <span
id="fr_115"></span>[3](#fn_115.md)

<span id="page_119">p. 119</span>

A protracted study of the subject has convinced the present writer that
this modern assumption, as to the form of the Homeric earth is entirely
baseless and misleading. He has, furthermore, satisfied himself that the
Egyptians, Akkadians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Phœnicians, Hebrews,
Greeks, Iranians, Indo-Aryans, Chinese, Japanese,—in fine, all the most
ancient historic peoples,—possessed in their earliest traceable periods
a cosmology essentially identical, and one of a far more advanced type
than has been attributed to them. The purpose of this chapter is to set
forth and illustrate this oldest known conception of the universe and of
its parts.

In ancient thought, the grand divisions of the world are four, to wit:
the abode of the gods, the abode of living men, the abode of the dead,
and, finally, the abode of demons. To locate these in right mutual
relations, one must begin by representing to himself the earth as a
sphere or spheroid, and as situated within, and concentric with, the
starry sphere, *each having its axis perpendicular, and its north pole
at the top*. The pole-star is thus in the true zenith, and the heavenly
heights centring about it are the abode of the supreme god or gods.
According to the same conception, the upper or northern hemisphere of
the earth is the proper home of living men; the under or southern
hemisphere of the earth, the abode of disembodied spirits and rulers of
the dead; and, finally, the undermost region of all, that centring
around the southern pole of the

<span id="page_120">p. 120</span>

heavens, the lowest hell. <span id="fr_116"></span>[1](#fn_116.md) The two
hemispheres of the earth were furthermore conceived of as separated from
each other by an equatorial ocean or oceanic current.

To illustrate this conception of the world, let the two circles of the
diagram which constitutes the [frontispiece](pf00.htm#img_front.md) of this
work represent respectively the earth-sphere and the outermost of the
revolving starry spheres. A is the north pole of the heavens, so placed
as to be in the zenith. B is the south pole of the heavens in the nadir.
The line A B is the axis of the apparent revolution of the starry
heavens in a perpendicular position. C is the north pole of the earth; D
its south pole; the line C D the axis of the earth in perpendicular
position, and coincident with the corresponding portion of the axis of
the starry heavens. The space 1 1 1 1 is the abode of the supreme god or
gods; 2, Europe; 3, Asia; 4, Libya, or the known portion of Africa;
5 5 5, the ocean, or "ocean stream;" 6 6 6, the abode of disembodied
spirits and rulers of the dead; 7 7 7 7, the lowest hell. <span
id="fr_117"></span>[2](#fn_117.md)

<span id="page_121">p. 121</span>

Now, to make this key a graphic illustration of Homeric cosmology, it is
only necessary to write in place of 1 1 1 1 "<span
class="smallcaps">Lofty Olympos</span>;" in place of 5 5 5, "<span
class="smallcaps">The Ocean Stream</span>;" in place of 6 6 6, "<span
class="smallcaps">House Of Aïdes</span>" (Hades); and in place of
7 7 7 7, "<span class="smallcaps">Gloomy Tartaros</span>." Imagine,
then, the light as falling from the upper heavens,—the lower terrestrial
hemisphere, therefore, as forever in the shade; imagine the Tartarean
abyss as filled with Stygian gloom and blackness,—fit dungeon-house for
dethroned gods and powers of evil; imagine the "men-illuminating" sun,
the "well-tressed" moon, the "splendid" stars, silently wheeling round
the central upright axis of the lighted hemispheres,—and suddenly the
confusions and supposed contradictions of classic cosmology disappear.
We are in the very world in which immortal Homer lived and sang. <span
id="fr_118"></span>[1](#fn_118.md) It is no longer an obscure crag in
Thessaly, from which heaven-shaking Zeus proposes to suspend the whole
earth and ocean. The eye measures for itself the nine days’ fall of
Hesiod's brazen anvil from heaven to earth, from earth to Tartarus. The
Hyperboreans are now a possibility. Now a *descensus ad inferos* can be
made by voyagers in the black ship. Unnumbered commentators upon Homer
have professed their despair of ever being able to harmonize the
passages in which Hades is represented as "beyond the ocean" with those
in which it is represented as "subterranean." Conceive of man's
dwelling-place, of Hades, and the ocean, as in this key, and the notable
difficulty instantaneously vanishes. Interpreters of the Odyssey have
found it impossible to understand how the westward and northward

<span id="page_122">p. 122</span>

sailing voyager could suddenly be found in waters and amid islands
unequivocally associated with the East. The present key explains it
perfectly, showing what no one seems heretofore to have suspected, that
the voyage of Odysseus is a poetical account of an imaginary
*circumnavigation of the mythical earth in the upper or northern
hemisphere, including a trip to the southern or under hemisphere and a
visit to the* ὀμφαλὸς θαλάσσης*, or North Pole*.

In this cosmological conception the upright axis of the world is often
poetically conceived of as a majestic pillar, supporting the heavens and
furnishing the pivot on which they revolve. Euripides <span
id="fr_119"></span>[1](#fn_119.md) and Aristotle <span
id="fr_120"></span>[2](#fn_120.md) unmistakably identify the Pillar of
Atlas with this world-axis. How interesting a feature this pillar became
in ancient mythologies will be seen below in chapter third of this part,
in chapter second of part six, and elsewhere in this volume.

Again, according to this view the highest part of the earth, its true
summit, would of course be at the North Pole. And since the whole of the
upper or northern hemisphere would in this case be conceived of as
rising on all sides from the equatorial ocean toward that summit,
nothing would be more natural than to view the entire upper half of the
earth as itself a vast mountain, the mother and support of all lesser
mountains. <span id="fr_121"></span>[3](#fn_121.md) Moreover, as the abode
of the supreme God or gods was thought to be directly over this summit
of the earth, it would be extremely easy for the imagination to carry
the summit of so

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

stupendous a mountain into and far above the clouds, and even to extend
it to such a height that the gods of heaven might be conceived of as
having their abode upon its top. This is precisely what came to pass,
and hence in the cosmology of the ancient Egyptians, Akkadians,
Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Indians, Chinese, and others we find,
under various names, but always easily recognizable, this *Weltberg*, or
"Mountain of the World," situated at the North Pole of the earth,
supporting or otherwise connecting with the city of the gods, and
serving as the axis around which sun, moon, and stars revolve. Often we
also find evidence that the under hemisphere was in like manner
conceived of as an inverted mountain, antipodal to the mountain of the
gods, and connecting at its apex with the abode of demons. <span
id="fr_122"></span>[1](#fn_122.md) The adjoining figure may illustrate this
conception of the earth, <span id="img_12300"></span>

|-------------------------------------------------|
| ![The Antipodal Polar Mountains](img/12300.jpg.md) |

the upper protuberance being the "Mount of the Gods," the lower the
inverted "Mount of Demons."

A clear view of the first of these remarkable

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> World-Mountains is
so essential to any right understanding of mythical geography and of the
mythical terrestrial Paradise that a more extended examination of the
subject seems a necessity.

Beginning with the Egyptians we may note this remarkable fact; that
notwithstanding his sharing the common and mistaken modern assumption
that the Egyptians conceived of the earth as flat, Brugsch, confessedly
the foremost authority in ancient Egyptian geography, places the highest
and most sacred part of the Egyptians’ earth at the North, *making the
land there to rise until in actual contact with heaven*. He also places
at the farthest southern extremity of the earth another lofty mountain,
*Ap-en-to* or *Tap-en-to*, literally "the horn of the world." <span
id="fr_123"></span>[1](#fn_123.md) Now, while several professed
Egyptologists have recently come to the conviction that the earth of the
Egyptians was a sphere, no one has brought out the fact that these two
heights are two antipodal polar projections of the spherical earth, the
upper or celestial one being the mount of the gods, and the lower or
infernal one the mount of demons. Of the former the following passage in
the "Book of Hades" may naturally be understood to speak:—

“Draw me \[the nocturnal sun\], infernal ones! . . .

“Retreat towards the eastern heavens, toward the dwellings which support
Sar, that mysterious mountain that spreads light among the gods \[or,
that I may spread light among the gods?\], who receive me when I go
forth from amongst you, from the retreat.” <span
id="fr_124"></span>[2](#fn_124.md)

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

To the inverted infernal mountain seem to apply the expressions in
chapter one hundred and fifty of the "Book of the Dead:"—

"Oh, the very tall Hill in Hades! The heaven rests upon it. There is a
snake or dragon upon it: Sati is his name," etc. <span
id="fr_125"></span>[1](#fn_125.md)

In another chapter of the same book a place is spoken of as "the
inverted precinct," which place is Hades. <span
id="fr_126"></span>[2](#fn_126.md) Moreover, the translator of another
text, called the "Book of Hades," describes a "pendant mountain" as a
curious feature in the vignette illustrations of the original. This can
hardly be anything other than *Ap-en-to*, the inverted mountain of
Hades. <span id="fr_127"></span>[3](#fn_127.md)

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

The Akkadians, who antedated even the most ancient empires of the
Tigro-Euphrates valley, had in like manner a "Mountain of the World,"
which was unlike all other mountains in that it was a support on which
the heavens rested and around which they revolved. It was called Kharsak
Kurra. It was so rich with gold and silver and precious stones as to be
dazzling to the sight. An ancient Akkadian hymn respecting it uses this
language:—

“O mighty mountain of Bel, Im-Kharsak, whose head rivals heaven, whose
root is in the holy deep!

“Among the mountains like a strong wild bull it lieth down.

“Its horn like the brilliance of the sun is bright.

“Like the star of heaven it is filled with sheen.” <span
id="fr_128"></span>[1](#fn_128.md)

In another hymn, apparently of great antiquity, we find the goddess
Istar addressed as "Queen of this Mountain of the World," which is
further located and identified by its connection with "the axis of
heaven," and with "the four rivers" of the Akkadian Paradise. <span
id="fr_129"></span>[2](#fn_129.md)

<span id="page_127">p. 127</span>

Lenormant places this mountain in the North (but sometimes incorrectly
in the East or Northeast), and makes it the "*lieu de l’assemblée des
dieux;*" but when he locates the corresponding antipodal mountain of
Hades in the West, instead of in the South, he seems to have gone
entirely beyond the evidence. At least, Dr. Friedrich Delitzsch affirms
that in the cuneiform literature thus far known he has discovered no
trace of such a location. <span id="fr_130"></span>[1](#fn_130.md) But on
this question of the site of these mountains more will be said in
chapter sixth of the present division.

The Assyrians and Babylonians inherited the Akkadian conception. One of
the titles of the supreme divinity of the Assyrians related to the
sacred mount. An invocation to him opens thus: "Assur, the mighty god,
who dwells in the temple of Kharsak Kurra." <span
id="fr_131"></span>[2](#fn_131.md) An Assyrian hymn speaks of the

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">          "feasts of the silver mountain,  
The heavenly courts,"—</span>

</div>

and the translator makes the expression refer to this "Assyrian
Olympos." <span id="fr_132"></span>[3](#fn_132.md) Sayce finds in the
following a plain reference to the same:

"I am lord of the steep mountains, which tremble whilst their summits
reach to the firmament.

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

"The mountain of alabaster, lapis, and onyx, in my hand I possess
it." <span id="fr_133"></span>[1](#fn_133.md)

How current the idea must have been among the Babylonians is shown by
the rhetorical use made of it by the prophet Isaiah. Rebuking the
arrogance of the king of Babylon and pre-announcing to him his doom, the
prophet beholds his fall as already accomplished, and in a passage of
wonderful pictorial power and beauty exclaims, "How art thou fallen from
heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! how art thou cut down to the
ground, which didst weaken the nations! For thou hast said in thine
heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars
of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation in the sides
of the North (or more correctly in the uttermost parts of the North, in
the extreme northern regions), I will ascend above the heights of the
clouds; I will be like (or equal to) the Most High. Yet thou shalt be
brought down to Sheol, to the sides (or regions) of the pit." <span
id="fr_134"></span>[2](#fn_134.md)

Since the publication of Gesenius's commentary on this passage and his
excursus upon the "*Götterberg im Norden*" appended to it, no question
has remained in the minds of scholars as to the character of the *Har
Moed*, the "mount of the congregation," in the far-off North.

Among the Chinese we find a similar celestial mount, the mythical
Kwen-lun. It is often called simply "The Pearl Mountain." On its top is
Paradise, with a living fountain from which flow in opposite directions
the four great rivers of the world. <span
id="fr_135"></span>[3](#fn_135.md)

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Around it revolve
the visible heavens; and the stars nearest to it, that is nearest to the
Pole, are supposed to be the abodes of the inferior gods and genii. To
this day, the Tauists speak of the first person of their trinity as
residing in "the metropolis of Pearl Mountain," and in addressing him
turn their faces to the northern sky. <span
id="fr_136"></span>[1](#fn_136.md)

A striking parallel to the Egyptian and Akkadian idea of two opposed
polar mountains, an arctic and an antarctic,—the one celestial and the
other infernal,—is found among the ancient inhabitants of India. The
celestial mountain they called Su-Meru, the infernal one Ku-Meru. <span
id="fr_137"></span>[2](#fn_137.md) In the Hindu Puranas the size and
splendors of the former are presented in the wildest exaggerations of
Oriental fancy. Its height, according to some accounts, is not less than
eight hundred and forty thousand miles, its diameter at the summit three
hundred and twenty thousand. Four enormous buttress mountains, situated
at mutually opposite points of the horizon, surround it. One account
makes the eastern side of Meru of the color of the ruby, its southern
that of the lotus, its western that of gold, its northern that of coral.
On its summit is the vast city of Brahma, fourteen thousand leagues in
extent. <span id="fr_138"></span>[3](#fn_138.md) Around it, in the cardinal

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

points and the intermediate quarters, are situated the magnificent
cities of Indra and the other regents of the spheres. The city of Brahma
in the centre of the eight is surrounded by a moat of sweet flowing
celestial waters, a kind of river of the water of life (Gangâ), which
after encircling the city divides into four mighty rivers flowing
towards four opposite points of the horizon, and descending into the
equatorial ocean which engirdles the earth. <span
id="fr_139"></span>[1](#fn_139.md)

Sometimes Mount Meru is represented as planted so firmly and deeply in
the globe that the antarctic or infernal mountain is only a projection
of its lower end. Thus the Sûrya Siddhânta says: "A collection of
manifold jewels, a mountain of gold, is Meru, passing through the middle
of the earth-globe (*bhu-gola*), and protruding on either side. At its
upper end are stationed along with Indra the gods and the Great Sages
(*maharishis*); at its lower end, in like manner, the demons have their
abode,—each \[class\] the enemy of the other. Surrounding it on every
side is fixed, next, this great ocean, like a girdle about the earth,
separating the two hemispheres of the gods and of the demons."

Conceiving of Meru in this way, as a kind of core extending through the
earth and projecting at each pole, one can easily understand the
following passage, in which two pole-stars are spoken of instead of one:
"In both \[*i.e.*, the two opposite\] directions from Meru are two
pole-stars fixed in the midst of the sky." As these mark the two
opposite poles of

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

the heavens, it is correctly added that "to those who are situated in
places of no latitude \[*i.e.*, on the equator\] both these pole-stars
have their place in the horizon." Farther on in the same treatise the
common designation used for the northern hemisphere is the hemisphere of
the gods, and for the southern the hemisphere of the *asuras*, or
demons. <span id="fr_140"></span>[1](#fn_140.md)

A picture of "the Earth of the Hindus," showing the exact position of
Meru and its buttress-mounts, will be given below in chapter fourth of
the present Part ([p. 152](pf20.htm#page_152).md).

That the cosmology of ancient India should have been retained and
propagated in its main features by all the followers of Buddha was only
natural. Accordingly, in their teachings our earth, and every other, has
its Sumeru, around which everything centres. <span
id="fr_141"></span>[2](#fn_141.md) Its top, according to the Nyâyânousâra
Shaster, is four-square, and on it are situated the three and thirty
(Trayastriñshas) heavens. Each face of the summit measures 80,000
yôjanas. Each of the four corners of the mountain-top has a peak seven
hundred yôjanas high. These, of course, are simply the four
buttress-mountains of the Hindu Meru lifted to the summit and made the
culminating

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

peaks. They are ornamented, we are told, with the seven precious
substances,—gold, silver, lapis-lazuli, crystal, cornelian, coral, and
ruby. One of the cities on the summit is called Sudarsana, or Belle-vue.
It is 10,000 yôjanas in circuit. The storied gates are 1½ yôjanas high,
and there are 1,000 of these gates, fully adorned. Each gate has 500
blue-clad celestial guards, fully armed. In its centre is a kind of
inner city called the Golden City of King Sakra, whose pavilion is 1,000
yôjanas in circuit, and its floor is of pure gold, inlaid with every
kind of gem. This royal residence has 500 gates, and on each of the four
sides are 100 towers, within each of which there are 1,700 chambers,
each of which chambers has within it seven Devîs, and each Devî is
attended by seven handmaidens. All these Devîs are consorts of King
Sakra, with whom he has intercourse in different forms and personations,
according to his pleasure. The length and breadth of the thirty-three
heavens is 60,000 yôjanas. They are surrounded by a sevenfold city wall,
a sevenfold ornamental railing, a sevenfold row of tinkling curtains,
and beyond these a sevenfold row of Talas-trees. All these encircle one
another, and are of every color of the rainbow, intermingled and
composed of every precious substance. Within, every sort of enjoyment
and every enchanting pleasure is provided for the occupants.

Outside this wonderful city of the gods, there is on each of its four
sides a park of ravishing beauty. In each park there is a sacred tower
erected over personal relics of Buddha. Each park has also a magic lake,
filled with water possessing eight peculiar excellences. Thus beauties
are heaped upon beauties, splendors upon splendors, marvels upon

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

marvels, until in sheer despair the wearied and exhausted imagination
abandons all further effort at definite mental representation. <span
id="fr_142"></span>[1](#fn_142.md)

It is worthy of note that, while most scholars have supposed the Sumeru
of Buddhism to be simply a development of the Indian idea, Mr. Beal, a
high authority, has, in one of his latest publications, claimed for it
an independent and coördinate, if not primitive, character. <span
id="fr_143"></span>[2](#fn_143.md) Other peculiarities in Buddhist
cosmography, especially the detachment of Uttarakuru and of Jambu-dwîpa
from Mount Meru,—in both of which particulars the Buddhist cosmos
differs from the Puranic,—lend some apparent confirmation to this claim.

In ancient Iranian thought this same celestial mountain presents itself
to the student. Its name is Harâ-berezaiti, the mythical Albordj, <span
id="fr_144"></span>[3](#fn_144.md)—"the seat of the genii: around it
revolve sun, moon, and stars; over it leads the path of the blessed to
heaven." <span id="fr_145"></span>[4](#fn_145.md)

The following description of it in one of the invocations of Rashnu in
the Rashn Yasht forcibly reminds one of the Odyssean description of the
heavenly Olympos: "Whether thou, O holy Rashnu, art on the
Harâ-berezaiti, the bright mountain around which the many stars revolve,
where come neither night nor darkness, no cold wind and no hot wind, no
deathful sickness, no uncleanness made by the Daêvas, and the clouds
cannot reach up to the Haraiti Bareza; we invoke, we bless
Rashnu." <span id="fr_146"></span>[1](#fn_146.md)

The following description is from Lenormant: "Like the Meru of the
Indians, Harâ-berezaiti is the Pole, the centre of the world, the fixed
point around which the sun and the planets perform their revolutions.
Analogously to the Gangâ of the Brahmans, it possesses the celestial
fountain Ardvî-Sûra, the mother of all terrestrial waters and the source
of all good things. In the midst of the lake formed by the waters of the
sacred source grows a single miraculous tree, similar to the Jambu of
the Indian myth, or else two trees, corresponding exactly to those of
the Biblical Gan-Eden. . . . There is the garden of Ahuramazda, like
that of Brahma on Meru. Thence the waters descend toward the four
cardinal points in four large streams, which symbolize the four horses
attached to the car of the goddess of the sacred source,
Ardvî-Sûra-Anâhita. These four horses recall the four animals placed at
the source of the paradisaic rivers in the Indian conception." <span

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

The Hellenic and Roman myths concerning the "World-mountain" were
numerous, but in later times not a little confused, as Ideler has
learnedly shown. <span id="fr_148"></span>[1](#fn_148.md) By some, as for
example Aristotle, it was identified with the Caucasus, and it was
asserted that its height was so prodigious that after sunset its head
was illuminated a third part of the night, and again a third part before
the rising of the sun in the morning. This identification explains the
later legend, according to which, in order to prove his rightful
lordship of the world, Alexander the Great plucked "the shadowless
lance" (the earth's axis) out of the topmost peak of the Taurus
Mountains. <span id="fr_149"></span>[2](#fn_149.md) More commonly the mount
is called Atlas, or the Atlantic mountain. Proclus, quoting Heraclitus,
says of it, "Its magnitude is such that it touches the ether and casts a
shadow of five thousand stadia in length. From the ninth hour of the day
the sun is concealed by it, even to his perfect demersion under

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span>

the earth." <span id="fr_150"></span>[1](#fn_150.md) Strabo's account of it
is full of the legendary features characteristic of an earthly Paradise.
The olive-trees were of extraordinary excellence, and there were there
seven varieties of refreshing wine. He informs us that the grape
clusters were a cubit in length, and the vine-trunks sometimes so thick
that two men could scarcely clasp round one of them. Herodotus describes
the mountain as "very tapering and round; so lofty, moreover, that the
top (they say) cannot be seen, the clouds never quitting it either
summer or winter. The natives call this mountain '*The Pillar of
Heaven*,' and they themselves take their name from it, being called
Atlantes. They are reported not to eat any living thing and never to
have any dreams." <span id="fr_151"></span>[2](#fn_151.md) Equally strange
is the story told by Maximus Tyrius, according to which the waves of the
ocean at high water stopped short before the sacred mount, "standing up
like a wall around its base, though unrestrained by any earthly
barrier." "Nothing but the air and the sacred thicket prevent the water
from reaching the mountain." According to other ancient legends, a river
of milk descended from this marvelous height. Noticing such curious
stories, Pliny well describes the mountain as *fabulosissimum*. <span
id="fr_152"></span>[3](#fn_152.md)

<span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

Everywhere, therefore, in the most ancient ethnic thought,—in the
Egyptian, Akkadian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Indian, Persian, Chinese, and
Greek,—everywhere is encountered this conception of what, looked at with
respect to its base and magnitude, is called the "Mountain of the
World," but looked at with respect to its glorious summit and its
celestial inhabitants is styled the "Mountain of the Gods." We need not
pursue the investigation further. Enough has been said to warrant the
assertion of Dr. Samuel Beal: "It is plain that this idea of a lofty
central primeval mountain belonged to the undivided human race." <span
id="fr_153"></span>[1](#fn_153.md) Elsewhere the same learned sinologue has
said, "I have no doubt—I can have none—that the idea of a central
mountain, and of the rivers flowing from it, and the abode of the gods
upon its summit, is a primitive myth derived from the earliest
traditions of our race." <span id="fr_154"></span>[2](#fn_154.md)

The ideas of the ancients respecting the Underworld, that is the
southern hemisphere of the earth beyond the equatorial ocean, are
sufficiently set forth in the writer's essay on "Homer's Abode of the
Dead," printed in the Appendix of the present work. <span
id="fr_155"></span>[3](#fn_155.md)

In all these studies one important caution has too often been
overlooked. In interpreting the cosmological and geographical references
of ancient religious writings it should never be forgotten that the
ideas expressed are often poetical and symbolical,—

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

religious ideas, hallowed in sacred song and story. If, some thousands
of years hence, one of Macaulay's archæologists of New Zealand were to
try to ascertain and set forth the geographical knowledge of the
Christian England of to-day by a study of a few fragments of English
hymns of our period, critically examining every expression about a
certain wonderful mountain, located sometimes on earth and sometimes in
heaven, and bearing the varying name of "Sion" or "Zion;" then making a
microscopical study of all the references to the strange river, which
according to the same texts would seem to be variously represented as
"dark," and as possessed of "stormy banks," and as "rolling between" the
singer living in England and the abode of the dead located in Western
Asia, and called "Canaan,"—a river sometimes addressed and represented
as so miraculously discriminating as to know for whom to divide itself,
letting them cross over "dry shod,"—surely, under such a process of
interpretation, even the England of the nineteenth century would make in
geographical science a very sorry showing. Or again, if some Schliemann
of a far-off future were to excavate the site of one of the dozen
American villages known by the name of "Eden," and, finding unequivocal
monumental evidence that it was thus called, were thereupon to conclude
and teach that the Americans of the date of that village *believed* its
site to be the true site of the Eden of Sacred History, and that here
the race of man originated, this would be a grave mistake, but it would
be a mistake precisely similar to many an one which has been committed
by *our* archæologists in interpreting and reconstructing the geography
of the ancients.

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

In concluding this sketch of ancient cosmology one further question
naturally and inevitably thrusts itself upon us. It is this: How are the
rise and the so wide diffusion of this singular world-view to be
explained? In other words, how came it to pass that the ancestors of the
oldest historic races and peoples agreed to regard the North Pole as the
true summit of the earth and the circumpolar sky as the true heaven? Why
were Hades and the lowest hell adjusted to a south polar nadir? The one
and sole satisfactory explanation is found in the hypothesis of a
primitive north polar Eden. *Studied from that standpoint*, the
appearances of the universe would be exactly adapted to produce this
curious cosmological conception. Thus the very system of ancient thought
respecting the world betrays the point of view from which the world was
first contemplated. This, though an indirect evidence of the truth of
our hypothesis, is for this very reason all the more convincing.

that the sight of portions of the south-polar heavens, especially the
starless region known as “the black Coal Sack,” is to this day capable
of suggesting the associations of the bottomless pit. Thus in a recent
traveler's letter of the ordinary kind we read, “Every clear evening we
could see the Magellan Clouds, soft and fleece-like, floating airily
among the far-off constellations. These mysterious bodies look like
star-spray, or borrowed bits of the Milky Way. Then, too, our eyes would
seek out, as by some strange fascination, those still more mysterious
‘chambers of the South,’ the black Coal Sack, with its retreating depths
of darkness, wherein no star shines. These irregular spaces,
emptinesses, as it were, in the heavens, impress one with a sense of
*something uncanny, as though these were, indeed, the ‘blackness of
darkness forever.’”*—*The Sunday School Times*. Philadelphia, 1883: p.

North Pole Star was *Alpha Draconis*, the Southern was most probably the
star *Eta Hydri*, and certain to have been in the constellation Hydra. .

with an Egyptian scene of the sun passing through Hades, where we see
the twelve gods of the earth, or the lower domain of night, marching
towards a mountain <span id="page_126">p. 126</span> *turned upside
down, and two typical personages are also turned upside down*. This is
an illustration of the passage of the sun through the Underworld. The
*reversed* on the same monument are the dead. Thus the Osirified
deceased, who has attained the second life, in the Ritual says
exultingly, '*I do not walk upon my head*.' The dead, as the Akhu, are
the spirits, and the Atua \[of the New Zealand legend\] is a spirit who
comes walking upside down." Massey, *The Natural Genesis*. London, 1883:
vol. i., p. 529. (The italics are Massey's.) The passage is the more
remarkable from the fact that Massey elsewhere states that the earth
"was considered flat by the first myth-makers," who in his scheme appear
