#### THE HYPOTHESIS.

<span class="smallcaps">From</span> the foregoing chapters it would seem
as if nearly every imaginable site for the Gan-Eden of Genesis had been
proposed, examined, and found unavailable. One, however, remains,—a
region of rarest interest in astronomical, physical, and historical
geography,—the natural centre of the only historic hemisphere.
Considering the fascination of the subject and the inexhaustible
ingenuity that has been expended upon it, it seems remarkable that it
should be left to the closing years of the nineteenth century to bring
forward and seriously to test the proposition <span
class="smallcaps">that the cradle of the human race, the Eden of
primitive tradition, was situated at the North Pole, in a country
submerged at the time of the Deluge</span>. <span
id="fr_54"></span>[1](#fn_54.md)

<span id="page_48">p. 48</span>

This is the hypothesis which it is proposed in the following pages to
examine and according to the evidences to adjudge. We propose to make
the test both strict and comprehensive. Hypotheses, however promising,
must be brought face to face with reality. Ours, like its numberless
predecessors, must be rejected if the solid facts of any of the
following sciences show that it is inadmissible:—

1\. *General Geogony*, or the science of the origin of the earth;

2\. *Mathematical* or *Astronomical Geography*, particularly its
teachings as to the inhabitableness or uninhabitableness of the
circumpolar region with respect to light;

3\. *Physiographical Geology*, particularly its teachings as to the
probability or improbability of the former existence and subsequent
submersion of a circumpolar country;

4\. *Prehistoric Climatology*, particularly with reference to the
temperature at the Pole at the time of the beginning of human history;

5\. *Paleontological Botany;*

6\. *Paleontological Zoölogy;*

7\. *Paleontological Anthropology* and *Ethnology;* and

8\. *Comparative Mythology*, viewed as the science

<span id="page_49">p. 49</span>

of the oldest traditionary beliefs and memories of mankind. On the
contrary, if the hypothesis is capable of meeting this eightfold test,
and especially if we can show, not only that it is admissible, but also
that in greater or less degree it is supported by the positive evidence
of the facts in nearly all of these fields of knowledge, we shall afford
a much more complete and convincing verification than is at all usual in
matters of prehistoric research.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_54"></span>[47:1](pf07.htm#fr_54.md) As to the alleged
"newness" of the above hypothesis, it is proper to say that something
like a year elapsed after its full acceptance and public announcement by
the writer before he could find any evidence that it had ever been
entertained or advocated by any other person. He then met with the
allusion in the passage quoted from Bishop Huet as a motto to chapter
second of the preceding part, and with a similar allusion in an
anonymous article in Dickens’ *All the Year Round*. Whether these were
more than rhetorical flourishes he was long in doubt. Not until after
the manuscript of the present work had been completed, packed, and
addressed to the publishers, <span id="page_48">p. 48</span> was the
doubt resolved by finding in an anonymous English magazine article of
more than thirty years ago this brief statement: "Pastellus will have it
that Paradise was under the North Pole." Who Pastellus was and what he
wrote upon the subject remain to be investigated. Suffice to say that up
to the date of this writing the author has found no book or tractate in
which the above hypothesis has ever been advocated. This fact renders
some of the mottoes prefixed to the chapters farther on remarkably
significant and impressive. In many cases their authors express truths
which they themselves did not perceive.
