</div>

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have already reminded the reader that
in an Eden situated at the North Pole the stars, instead of seeming to
rise and set as with us, would have had a horizontal motion from left to
right round and round the observer. This appearance of the heavenly
bodies could of course be found nowhere but at the Pole. If, therefore,
we could anywhere in the world of ancient tradition find any statement
of a belief that at the beginning of the world the movements of the
heavenly bodies were different from their present movements, and
particularly if we should be able to find trace of a belief that the
primeval motion of the stars was in orbits apparently horizontal, this
would certainly be a most striking and cogent and unexpected evidence
that human observation of the starry heavens began at the Pole.

Now it so happens that we have traces of just such a belief. In the
tantalizing fragments of ancient lore, preserved to us in the pages of
Diogenes Laërtius, we find ascribed to the illustrious Greek astronomer
Anaxagoras this remarkable teaching:

"*In the beginning* the stars revolved in *a tholiform manner*.

<span id="page_192">p. 192</span>

Now to revolve in a tholiform manner is to revolve in a horizontal
plane, like the θόλος, or "dome," of an astronomical observatory.
Anaxagoras himself defined the motion more fully when he said that it
was a motion, not ὐπὸ, underneath, but περὶ, around the earth. <span
id="fr_252"></span>[1](#fn_252.md)

Anaximenes would seem to have had the same idea, for he is reported to
have likened the primitive revolution of the sky to the rotating of a
man's hat upon his head. Another explanatory expression (whether
originating with Anaxagoras or with his reporter we do not know) is
this: "At first *the Pole star*, which is continually visible, *always
appeared in the zenith*, but afterward it acquired a certain
declination." <span id="fr_253"></span>[2](#fn_253.md)

Here, then, we have as a doctrine of the ancient astronomers the
singular notion that, in the beginning of the world, the celestial Pole
was in the zenith,

<span id="page_193">p. 193</span>

and that the revolutions of the stars were round a perpendicular
axis. <span id="fr_254"></span>[1](#fn_254.md) What could have led an
astronomer to *invent* such a doctrine it is impossible to say. On the
other hand, if it was one of the interesting and seemingly paradoxical
traditions of the early postdiluvian world, it is perfectly easy to see
how imperishable a story it would be, particularly among the star-loving
Chaldæans and Babylonians, from whom the earliest Greek astronomers and
scientists received no small share of their doctrines. <span
id="fr_255"></span>[2](#fn_255.md) And that the Chaldæans and probably the
Egyptians had precisely this idea is not a notion here advanced for the
first time. <span id="fr_256"></span>[3](#fn_256.md)

Another interesting question now suggests itself. When and under what
circumstances was this alleged "declination" of the Pole imagined to
have taken place? Was it gradual, or sudden? Did the ancients suppose it
to have resulted from a movement in the regular order of nature, or from
one in

<span id="page_194">p. 194</span>

violation thereof? Was it to them a normal and ever on-going change, or
was it the record of a natural catastrophe?

Our hypothesis would lead us to expect the latter of these
suppositions. <span id="fr_257"></span>[1](#fn_257.md) The only rational
and credible explanation of the declination is to be found in a transfer
of the theatre of human history from the circumpolar home to some land
of lower latitude. Now if, during the prevalence of the Deluge, or
later, in consequence of the on-coming of the Ice age, the survivors of
the Flood were translocated from their antediluvian home at the Pole to
the north slope of the "plateau of Pamir," the probable starting-point
of historic postdiluvian humanity, the new aspect presented by the
heavens in this new latitude would have been precisely as if in the
grand world-convulsion the sky itself had become displaced, its polar
dome tilted over about one third of the distance from the zenith to the
horizon. The astronomical knowledge of those survivors very likely
enabled them to understand the true reason of the changed appearance,
but their rude descendants, unfavored with the treasures of antediluvian
science, and born only to a savage or nomadic life in their new and
inhospitable home, might easily have forgotten the explanation. In time
such children's children might easily have come to embody the strange
story handed down from their fathers in strange myths, in which nothing
of the original facts remained beyond an obscure account of some
mysterious displacement of the sky, supposed to have

<span id="page_195">p. 195</span>

occurred in a far-off age in connection with some appalling natural
cataclysm or world-disaster. <span id="fr_258"></span>[1](#fn_258.md)

Now it is difficult to believe it a mere accident that in various
ancient authors we find allusion both to an extremely ancient
displacement of the sky and to its supposed original state. None of
these allusions have ever been explained by writers on the subject. One
of them occurs in Plato's Timæus, where, in language ascribed to an
Egyptian priest of Solon's time, "a declination of the bodies revolving
round the earth" is spoken of, and this declination is offered as the
true explanation of the partial destruction of the world commemorated in
the myth of Phaëthon. As this destruction was by fire there would at
first sight seem to be no connection between it and the destruction at
the time of the Deluge; nor is there in the context anything to suggest
such a connection. Fortunately, however, we have in Hyginus a fuller
version of the myth, from which it appears that the Greeks supposed
Deukalion's universal flood to have been providentially sent to
extinguish the fearful conflagration which Phaëthon's unskillful driving
of the steeds of the sun had

<span id="page_196">p. 196</span>

occasioned. This makes the connection clear and direct. The Flood and
the "declination of the heavenly bodies revolving round the earth" are
at once brought into a true historic relation. <span
id="fr_259"></span>[1](#fn_259.md)

In like manner, in the Bundahish, in the first five chapters, and in Zâd
Sparam's paraphrase of the same, it is stated that during the first
three thousand years, before the incoming of the Evil One, "the sun,
moon, and stars stood still," but as soon as the Destroyer of the good
creation came he assaulted and deranged the sky, as well as the earth
and sea. <span id="fr_260"></span>[2](#fn_260.md) And remarkably enough, it
is stated that as a result of this assault the Evil One mastered as much
as "*one third* of the sky" and overspread it with darkness. <span
id="fr_261"></span>[3](#fn_261.md) Moreover, in the thirtieth chapter, in
giving a prophetic account of the final restoration of the material
world to its primeval state, there seems to be an allusion in verse
thirty-two to a necessary resetting or readjustment of the celestial
vault by the hand of its Creator. <span id="fr_262"></span>[4](#fn_262.md)

To all such facts, wherever found, we have in the hypothesis of an
Arctic Eden and a transfer of the human horizon at the time of the
Deluge to lower latitudes a perfect key.

Letronne (*Des Opinions Cosmographiques des Pères de l’Église
rapprochées des Doctrines Philosophiques de la Grèce*) says that the
opinion cannot have been limited to the school of Anaximenes and
Zenophanes. "Elle a dû faire partie de la doctrine physique de plusieurs
des sects anciennes." *Revue des Deux Mondes*. Paris, 1834: p. 650.—In
this connection it is well worthy of note that in the Japanese cosmogony
the predecessor or "father," of our present sun and moon is represented
as beginning his activities in the new-created world by repeatedly
performing *in a horizontal plane* a circumambulation of the "Island of
the Congealed Drop;" also that in Chinese tradition the first man *held
the primeval sun and moon one in each hand*. Our latest Chinese writer
upon the subject speaks of this as particularly noticeable. *Revue des
Deux Mondes*, May 24, June 1, and June 14, 1884. A few passages are
cited in *The Catholic World*. December, 1884, pp. 320-323.

<span id="fn_254"></span>[193:1](pf25.htm#fr_254.md) Since writing the
above I have read Richard A. Proctor's "New Theory of Achilles’ Shield,"
and have been particularly struck with his argument, from the position
of the aquatic constellations in the most ancient astronomy, that the
celestial equator at the time of the invention of the constellations
must have been "in a horizontal position." *Light Science for Leisure
Hours*. London, 1870: pp. 309-312.

<span id="fn_255"></span>[193:2](pf25.htm#fr_255.md) The instructor of
Thales was a Chaldæan, a fact which writers on the early cosmological
speculations of the Greeks have almost uniformly overlooked. See also L.
von Schroeder, *Pythagoras und die Inder*. Leipsic, 1884.

<span id="fn_256"></span>[193:3](pf25.htm#fr_256.md) "Il est de même
vraisemblable que les Chaldéens ont eu l’idée d’une destruction et d’un
renouvellement du monde, c’est-à-dire, de la surface de notre globe, et
conjointement avec cette destruction, *d’un déplacement des corps
célestes du firmament*. . . . Diverses inscriptions dans les temples
Égyptiens et des hiéroglyphes . . . me paraissent aussi être des essais
de représenter distinctement la catastrophe du déluge et le *changement
qui alors s’est opéré dans l’ancien ciel*."—Klee, *Le Déluge*. Paris,
1847: p. 307.

<span id="fn_257"></span>[194:1](pf25.htm#fr_257.md) Bailly in his
*Histoire de l’Astronomie des Anciens* inclines to the opinion that the
ancient Egyptians thought the declination a gradual one, but Klee
expresses decided doubt. *Le Déluge*, p. 301.

<span id="fn_258"></span>[195:1](pf25.htm#fr_258.md) The only other
plausible explanation of the facts now under consideration would be that
furnished by the long ago proposed but emphatically rejected theory,
that in some distant geological age in consequence of some cataclysm the
axis of the earth's rotation was changed, bringing the new or present
Pole into a region before temperate or torrid. C. F. Winslow, M. D., in
his pamphlet on *The Cooling Globe*, Boston, 1865, was one of the most
recent theorists to favor this view. But see Maedler, *Populäre
Astronomie*, p. 370 ss., who states that, according to the calculations
of Bessel, the bodily plucking up of one hundred and fourteen cubic
miles of the Himalaya mountains and the transfer of them to North
America would change the position of the earth's axis less than one
hundred feet. Still stronger statements are made in the paper read
before the London Geological Society, Feb. 21, 1877, by Professor J. F.
Twisden.

<span id="fn_259"></span>[196:1](pf25.htm#fr_259.md) Compare Milton,
*Paradise Lost*, x. 648-690.

<span id="fn_260"></span>[196:2](pf25.htm#fr_260.md) "The Aztecs said that
when the sun had risen for the first time, at the beginning, it *lay on
the horizon, and moved not*." Dorman, *Primitive Superstitions*. Phila.,
1885: p. 330. Both of these reports look as if they had sprung from
misapprehension of the original tradition given by Anaxagoras.

London, 1880: Pt. i., p. 17. West translates uncertainly. Justi renders
the passage, "Er nahm vom Inneren des Himmels ein Drittheil ein." *Der
Bundahish*. Leipsic, 1868: p. 5.

<span id="fn_262"></span>[196:4](pf25.htm#fr_262.md) West, *Pahlavi Texts*,
Pt. i., p. 529. This last remark is based upon West's version; it is not
supported by Windischmann's.
