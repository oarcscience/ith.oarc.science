<span class="small">*Sowohl der Apfelbaum and die Quelle, als auch der
Drache des Hesperidengartens, werden in den Mythen and Märchen der
meisten Völker in das Centrum der Natur, an den Gipfel des Weltberges,
an den Nordpol verlegt*.—<span class="smallcaps">Wolfgang
Menzel</span>.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">In</span> the centre of the Garden of Eden,
according to Genesis iii. 3, there was a tree exceptional in position,
in character, and in its relations to men. Its fruit was "good for
food," it was "pleasant to the eyes," "a tree to be desired." <span
id="fr_421"></span>[1](#fn_421.md) At first sight it would not perhaps
appear how a study of this tree in the different mythologies of the
ancient world could assist us in locating primitive Paradise. In the
discussions of such sites as have usually been

<span id="page_263">p. 263</span>

proposed it could not; but if the Garden of Eden was precisely at the
North Pole, it is plain that a goodly tree standing in the centre of
that Garden would have had a visible and obvious cosmical significance
which could by no possibility belong to any other. Its fair stem
shooting up as arrow-straight as the body of one of the "giant trees of
California," far overtopping, it may be, even such gigantic growths as
these, would to any one beneath have seemed the living pillar of the
very heavens. Around it would have turned the "stars of God," as if in
homage; through its topmost branches the human worshiper would have
looked up to that unmoving centre-point where stood the changeless
throne of the Creator. How conceivable that that Creator should have
reserved for sacred uses this one natural altar-height of the Earth, and
that by special command He should have guarded its one particular
adornment from desecration! (Gen. ii. 16, 17.) If anywhere in the temple
of nature there was to be an altar, it could only be here. That it was
here finds a fresh and unexpected confirmation in the singular agreement
of many ancient religions and mythologies *in associating their
Paradise-Tree with the axis of the world, or otherwise, with equal
unmistakableness, locating it at the Arctic Pole of the Earth*. <span
id="fr_422"></span>[1](#fn_422.md)

That the Northmen conceived of the universe as

<span id="page_264">p. 264</span>

a tree (the Yggdrasil) is well known to ordinary readers. Its roots are
in the lowest hell, its mid-branches inclose or overarch the abode of
men, its top reaches the highest heaven of the gods. It was their
poetical way of saying that the whole world is an organic unity pervaded
by one life. As the abode of the gods was in the north polar sky, the
summit of the tree was at that point, its base in the south polar abyss,
its trunk coincident with the axis of heaven and earth. <span
id="fr_423"></span>[1](#fn_423.md) It was, therefore, in position and in
nature precisely what an idealizing imagination magnifying the primitive
tree of Paradise to a real World-tree would have produced. <span
id="fr_424"></span>[2](#fn_424.md)

But while most readers are familiar with this Norse myth, few are aware
how ancient and universal an idea it represents. This same tree appears
in the earliest Akkadian mythology. <span
id="fr_425"></span>[3](#fn_425.md) And what is precisely to our purpose, it
stood, as we have before seen, at "the Centre" or Pole of the earth,
where is "the holy house of the gods." <span
id="fr_426"></span>[4](#fn_426.md) It is the same

<span id="page_265">p. 265</span>

tree which in ancient Egyptian mythology inclosed the sarcophagus of
Osiris, and out of which the king of Byblos caused the roof-pillar of
his palace to be taken. But this was only another form of the
Tat-pillar, which is the axis of the world. <span
id="fr_427"></span>[1](#fn_427.md) In the light of comparative cosmology it
is quite impossible to agree with Mr. Renouf in his treatment of the
Tree in Egyptian mythology. It is neither "the rain cloud," nor "the
light morning cloud," nor "the transparent mist on the horizon." His own
citations of texts clearly show that under all its names the Egyptian
Tree of Life is a true World-tree, whose trunk is coincident in position
and direction

<span id="page_266">p. 266</span>

with the axis of the world; a tree in whose sky-filling branches Bennu,
the sun-bird, is seated; a tree from whose north polar top the
"*North-wind*" proceeds; a tree which, like the Yggdrasil, yields a
celestial rain that is as life-giving as Ardvi-Sûra's, and that
descends, not merely upon the fields of Lower Egypt, but, like
Ardvi-Sûra's, to the Underworld itself, refreshing "those who are in
*Amenti*." <span id="fr_428"></span>[1](#fn_428.md) The super-terrestrial
portion of the Egyptian's Yggdrasil, therefore,—like that of the
Northman's,—stands at the Arctic Pole.

The Phœnicians, Syrians, and Assyrians had each their sacred tree in
which the universe was symbolized. <span id="fr_429"></span>[2](#fn_429.md)
In the lost work of Pherecydes the former is represented as a "winged
oak." <span id="fr_430"></span>[3](#fn_430.md) Over it was thrown the
magnificent veil, or *peplos*, of Harmonia, on which were represented
the all-surrounding Ocean with his rivers, the Earth with its *omphalos*
in the centre, the sphere of Heaven varied by the figures of the
stars. <span id="fr_431"></span>[4](#fn_431.md) But as this
self-interpreting

<span id="page_267">p. 267</span>

symbol was furnished with wings to facilitate its constant rotation, it
is plain that we have in it, not only a World-tree, but also one the
central line of whose trunk is one with the axis of heaven and
earth. <span id="fr_432"></span>[1](#fn_432.md) In the language of Maury,
"It is a conception identical with the Yggdrasil of Scandinavian
mythology." <span id="fr_433"></span>[2](#fn_433.md) That section of the
tree, therefore, which reaches from the abode of men into the holy
heavens rises pillar-like from the Pole of the earth to the Pole of the
sky.

Among the Persians the legendary tree of Paradise took on two forms,
according as it was viewed with predominant reference to the universe as
an organic whole, or to the vegetable world as proceeding from it. In
the first aspect it was the Gaokerena (Gôkard) tree, or "the white Hôm"
(Haoma = Soma); in the second, the "tree of all seeds," the "tree
opposed to harm." Of the former it is written, "Every one who eats of it
becomes immortal; . . . also in the renovation of the universe they
prepare its immortality therefrom; it is the chief of plants." <span
id="fr_434"></span>[3](#fn_434.md) Of the second we read, "In like manner

<span id="page_268">p. 268</span>

as the animals, with grain of fifty and five species and twelve species
of medicinal plants, have arisen from the primeval ox, so ten thousand
species among the species of principal plants, and a hundred thousand
species among ordinary plants, have grown from all these seeds of the
tree opposed to harm, the many-seeded. . . . When the seeds of all these
plants, with those from the primeval ox, have arisen upon it, every year
the bird (Kamros) strips that tree and mingles all the seeds in the
water; Tîshtar seizes them with the rain-water and rains them on to all
regions." <span id="fr_435"></span>[1](#fn_435.md)

Where stood this tree which, in its dual form, was at once the source of
all other trees and the giver of immortality? Every indication points us
to the northern Pole. It was in Aîrân-Vej, <span
id="fr_436"></span>[2](#fn_436.md) the Persian Eden, and this we have
already found. It was at the source of all waters, the north polar
fountain of Ardvî-Sûra. <span id="fr_437"></span>[3](#fn_437.md) It was
begirt with the starry girdle of the zodiacal constellations, which
identifies it with the axis of the world. <span
id="fr_438"></span>[4](#fn_438.md) It grew on "the highest height of
Harâ-berezaiti," <span id="fr_439"></span>[5](#fn_439.md) and this is the
celestial mountain at the Pole. Finally, although Grill mistakenly

<span id="page_269">p. 269</span>

makes the Chinvat bridge "correspond with the Milky Way and the
rainbow," he nevertheless correctly discerns some relationship between
Chinvat and the Persian Tree of Life. <span
id="fr_440"></span>[1](#fn_440.md) By this identification we are again
brought to the one unmistakable location toward which all lines of
evidence perpetually converge.

The Aryans of India, as early as in the far-off Vedic age, had also
their World-tree, which yielded the gods their soma, the drink which
maintains immortality. As we should anticipate, its roots are in the
Underworld of Yama at the hidden pole, its top in the north polar heaven
of the gods, its body is the sustaining axis of the universe. <span
id="fr_441"></span>[2](#fn_441.md) Weber long ago expressly identified it
with the World-ash of the Edda; <span id="fr_442"></span>[3](#fn_442.md)
and Kuhn, <span id="fr_443"></span>[4](#fn_443.md) Senart, <span
id="fr_444"></span>[5](#fn_444.md) and all the more recent writers accept
without question the identification. Grill's interesting sketch of the
historic developments of the myth may be seen in the Appendix to this
volume. <span id="fr_445"></span>[6](#fn_445.md) Some of the late traces of
it in Hindu

<span id="page_270">p. 270</span>

art betray the ancient conception of the Pole as a means of ascent to
heaven, a bridge of souls and of the gods, a stair substituted for the
slippery pillar up which the Tauist emperor vainly sought to
climb. <span id="fr_446"></span>[1](#fn_446.md)

Among the Greeks <span id="fr_447"></span>[2](#fn_447.md) it is more than
probable that the "holy palm" in Delos, on which Lêtô laid hold at the
birth of Apollo, represents the same mythical World-tree. If so, and if
we follow Hecatæus in locating the scene, we shall be brought to the
Arctic Pole. <span id="fr_448"></span>[3](#fn_448.md) The eternally
flourishing olive of Athênê (Euripides, Ion 1433) seems also but another
form of the holy palm, and this in some of its descriptions brings us
again to the land of the

<span id="page_271">p. 271</span>

Hyperboreans. <span id="fr_449"></span>[1](#fn_449.md) In the Garden of the
Hesperides, the tree which bore the golden apples was unquestionably the
Tree of Paradise; but following Æschylus, Pherecydes, and Apollodorus,
we must place it in the farthest North, beyond the Rhipæan
mountains. <span id="fr_450"></span>[2](#fn_450.md) Traces of the same
mythical conception among the Romans are presented by Kuhn. <span
id="fr_451"></span>[3](#fn_451.md)

The sacred tree of the Buddhists figures largely in their sculpture. An
elaborate specimen representation may be seen on the well-known Sanchi
Tope. One inconspicuous feature in the representation has often puzzled
observers. Almost invariably, at the very top of the tree we find a
little umbrella. So universal is this that its absence occasions
remark. <span id="fr_452"></span>[4](#fn_452.md) This little piece of
symbolism has a curious value. In Buddhist mythological art the umbrella
symbolizes the north polar heaven of the gods, <span
id="fr_453"></span>[5](#fn_453.md) and by attaching it to the tip of the
sacred tree the ancient sculptors of this faith unmistakably showed the
cosmical character and axial position of that to which it was attached.

But this cosmic tree was the mythical Bôdhi tree, the Tree of Wisdom,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

<span class="small">                          "Beneath whose leaves  
It was ordained that Truth should come to Buddh." <span
id="fr_454"></span>[6](#fn_454.md)</span>

</div>

<span id="page_272">p. 272</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Its location is in
"the Middle of the Earth." <span id="fr_455"></span>[1](#fn_455.md)
Notwithstanding his doctrine of an African origin of mankind, Gerald
Massey says, "In the legendary life of Gautama, Buddha is described as
having to pass over the celestial water to reach Nirvana, which is the
land of the Bôdhi Tree of Life and Knowledge. He was unable to cross
from one bank to the other, but the spirit of the Bôdhi tree stretched
out its arms to him and helped him over in safety. By aid of this tree
he attained the summit of wisdom and immortal life. It is the same Tree
of the Pole and of Paradise all mythology through. The Tree of the
Guarani garden, the Hebrew Eden, the Hindu Jambu-dwîpa, is likewise the
Tree of Nirvana. This final application of the imagery proves its
origin. The realm of rest was first seen at the polar centre of the
revolving stars." <span id="fr_456"></span>[2](#fn_456.md)

The ancient Germans called their World-tree the *Irmensul*, *i.e.*,
"Heaven-pillar." Grimm speaks of its close relationship with the Norse
Yggdrasil, and

<span id="page_273">p. 273</span>

lends his high authority to the view that it was simply a mythical
expression of the idea of the world's axis. <span
id="fr_457"></span>[1](#fn_457.md) The same view was advanced still earlier
by the distinguished Icelandic mythographer, Finn Magnusen. <span
id="fr_458"></span>[2](#fn_458.md) How profoundly the myth affected
mediæval Christian art is illustrated in many places, among the rest in
the sculptures on the south portal of the Baptistery at Parma. <span
id="fr_459"></span>[3](#fn_459.md) It is also not without a deep
significance that "in the mediæval legend of Seth's visit to the Garden
of Eden, to obtain for his dying father the Oil of Compassion, the Tree
of Life which he saw lifted its *top to heaven* and sent its *root to
hell;*" <span id="fr_460"></span>[4](#fn_460.md) and that on the
crucifixion of Christ, himself the

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

"*Arbor, quæ ab initio posita est*,"

</div>

this cosmical Tree of the Garden died, and became the "*Arbre Sec*" of
mediæval story. <span id="fr_461"></span>[5](#fn_461.md)

<span id="page_274">p. 274</span>

The Paradise-tree of the Chinese Tauists is also a World-tree. It is
found in the centre of the enchanting Garden of the Gods on the summit
of the polar Kwen-lun. Its name is Tong, and its location is further
defined by the expression that it grows "hard by the closed Gate of
Heaven." <span id="fr_462"></span>[1](#fn_462.md) As in many of the ancient
religions, the mount on which, after the Flood, the ark rested was
considered the same as that from which in the beginning the first man
came forth, it is not strange to find the tree on the top of the
mountain of Paradise remembered in some of the legends of the Deluge. In
the Tauist legend it seems to take the place of the ark. Thus we are
told that "one extraordinary antediluvian saved his life by climbing up
a mountain, and there and then, in the manner of birds plaiting a nest,
he passed his days on a tree, whilst all the country below him was one
sheet of water. He afterwards lived to a very old age, and could testify
to his late posterity that a whole race of human beings had been swept
from the face of the earth." <span id="fr_463"></span>[2](#fn_463.md)

It is at least suggestive to find this same idea of salvation from a
universal deluge by means of a miraculous tree growing on the top of the
divine Mountain of the North among the Navajo Indians of our own
country. Speaking of the men of the world before our own, and of the
warning they had received of the approaching flood, their legends go on:
"Then they took soil from all the *four corner mountains of the world*,
and placed it on top of the mountain that stood *in the North;* and
thither they all went, including the people of the mountains,

<span id="page_275">p. 275</span>

the salt-woman, and such animals as then lived in the third world. When
the soil was laid on the mountain, the latter began to grow higher and
higher, but the waters continued to rise, and the people climbed upwards
to escape the flood. At length the mountain ceased to grow, and they
planted on the summit a great reed, into the hollow of which they all
entered. The reed grew every night, but did not grow in the daytime; and
this is the reason why the reed grows in joints to this day: the hollow
internodes show where it grew by night, and the solid nodes show where
it rested by day. Thus the waters gained on them in the daytime. The
turkey was the last to take refuge in the reed, and he was therefore at
the bottom. When the waters rose high enough to wet the turkey, they all
knew that danger was near. Often did the waves wash the end of his tail,
and it is for this reason that the tips of the turkey's tail-feathers
are to this day lighter than the rest of his plumage. At the end of the
fourth night from the time it was planted the reed had grown up to the
floor of the fourth world, and here they found a hole through which they
passed to the surface." <span id="fr_464"></span>[1](#fn_464.md)

The opening sentence of the above citation gives us a topography exactly
corresponding to Mount Meru, the Hindu "mountain of the North," with its
"four corner mountains of the world," in the four opposite points of the
horizon. Moreover, in the Deluge myths of the Hindus, as in this of the
Navajos,

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

it was over this central mountain that the survivors of that
world-destruction found deliverance. However explained, the coincidences
are remarkable.

In Keltic tradition the Tree of Paradise is represented by the tree
which bore golden apples in Avalon. But Avalon is always represented as
an island in the far North, and its "loadstone castle" self-evidently
connects it with the region of the magnetic Pole. <span
id="fr_465"></span>[1](#fn_465.md)

In the ancient epic of the Finns, the Kalevala, we see the World-tree of
another people. If any doubt could rise as to its position in the
universe, the constellation of *the Great Bear in its top* would suffice
to remove it. <span id="fr_466"></span>[2](#fn_466.md)

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

Thus the sacred trees, like the sacred waters, of every ancient people
invariably conduct the investigator to lands outside the historic
*habitats* of the peoples in question, and ever to one and the same
primeval home-country, the land of light and glory at the Arctic
Pole. <span id="fr_467"></span>[1](#fn_467.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_421"></span>[262:1](pf30.htm#fr_421.md) Was this "tree of
knowledge" identical with the "tree of life"? Possibly. "The tradition
of Genesis," says Lenormant, *Beginnings*, p. 84, "at times appears to
admit two trees, one of Life and one of Knowledge, and again seems to
speak of one only, uniting in itself both attributes (Gen. ii. 17; iii.
1-7)." Compare Ernst von Bunsen, *Das Symbol des Kreuzes bei allen
Nationen*. Berlin, 1876: p. 5. To make the whole account relate to one
tree it would only be necessary first to translate the last clause of
ch. ii. 9 "the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, *even* the
tree of knowledge of good and evil;" and then the last clause of ch.
iii. 22 "and now lest he continue to put forth his hand and to take of
the tree of life," etc.,—for both of which constructions there are
abundant precedents, if only the *gam* be rendered with the freedom used
in some other passages. As to the first, see 1 Sam. xvii. 40; xxviii. 3;
Dan. iv. 10; as to the second, the Hebrew grammars on the use of the
future. Compare also Prov. iii. 13, 18, where *wisdom* is a tree of
*life*.

*Beginnings of History*, pp. 83-107. Had Professor Finzi duly considered
the Tree of Life in Akkadian tradition, he could hardly have felt
"constrained" to ascribe the origin of the sacred tree of the Assyrian
monuments to "Aryan, more particularly Iranian influences." *Ricerche

<span id="fn_427"></span>[265:1](pf30.htm#fr_427.md) "It was most likely at
Memphis, too, that he \[Ptah\] was imaged as a pillar *beginning in the
lowest and ending in the highest heaven*, a conception which is
undoubtedly referred to in that feature of the myth, as related by
Plutarch, where the king of Byblos causes a pillar to be made in his
palace out of the tree which had grown around the sarcophagus of Osiris.
In fact, we possess delineations of Osiris as well as of Ptah answering
to this description. On a post, on which is graven a human countenance,
and which is covered with gay clothing, stands the so-called Tat-pillar,
entirely made up of a kind of superimposed capitals, one of which has a
rude face scratched upon it, intended, no doubt, to represent the
shining sun. On the top of the pillar is placed the complete head-dress
of Osiris, the ram's horns, the sun, the ureus-adders, the double
feather, all emblems of light and of sovereignty, and which, in my
judgment, must have been intended to represent the highest heaven. \[See
the plate in Wilkinson, M. and C., 2d series, suppt. plate 25 and 33,
No. 5. Mariette, *Abydos*, I., pl. 16.\] The Tat-pillar is the symbol of
durability, immutability. This representation of Osiris, which its rude
and simple character, without trace of art, proves to have been one of
the most ancient, must apparently be held to be symbolical of him as
'Lord of the length of time and of eternity.'" Tiele, *History of the
Egyptian Religion*, pp. 46, 47. See also G. Massey, *The Natural
Genesis*, vol. i., pp. 417, 418, 422; and Brugsch, *Astronomische and

of the Society for Biblical Archæology*. London, 1884: pp. 217-220. A
beautiful confirmation of our view is found in the important text in
which "the abyss under the earth" (*die Tiefe unter der Erde*) is
poetically expressed by the term "the cavity of the Persea" (*die Höhle
der Persea*). Brugsch's version, from which the above German expressions
are taken, may be seen in the *Zeitschrift für Aegyptische Sprache* and
Alterthumskunde. Leipsic, 1881: pp. 77 ff. Surely no opening in an

the Mount or Pole is identified at the bottom by one tree, and at the
top by another, and between the two there is a kind of ladder, with a
series of steps or stairs which ascend the tree, in the place of a stem.

Pole is extant in Celebes, where the natives believe that the world is
supported by the Hog, and that earthquakes are caused when the Hog rubs
itself against the Tree. . . . At Ephesus they showed the Olive and
Cypress Grove of Lêtô, and in it the Tree of Life to which the Great
Mother clung in bringing forth her twin progeny. There also was the
Mount on which Hermes announced the birth of her twins Diana and Apollo

against the Tree of the Pole." *The Natural Genesis*, vol. i., p. 354.

cosmology Beal remarks, "But whilst we may regard Buddhism in the light
of a reformation of the popular belief in India, we must bear in mind
that the stream of tradition which reappears in its teaching, and may be
traced in its books, is independent and probably distinct from the
Brahmanical traditions embodied in the Puranas and elsewhere. At any
rate, this is the case so far as the primitive question of creation and
of the cosmic system generally is concerned. Mr. Rhys Davids has already
remarked that 'the Buddhist archangel or god Brahma is different from
anything known to the Brahmans, and is part of an altogether different
system of thought' (*Buddhist Suttas*, p. 168 n.). I am inclined to go
further than this, and say that the traditions of the Buddhists are
different from those of the Brahmans in almost every respect." Samuel

the central and highest of the trees depicted conclusively identifies it
with the World-tree of universal Aryan tradition. On this bird see Kuhn.

Guaranis were to meet once more with their Adam, Atum, Turn, or Tamoi,
who was to help them from thence in their ascent to the higher life.
Here the Tree of Life becomes a tree of the dead to raise them into
heaven. So in the Algonkin myth the tree of the dead was a sort of
oscillating log for the deceased to cross the river by, as a bridge of
the abyss, beyond which the Dog, as in the Persian mythos, stands
waiting for the souls of the dead, just as the Dog stands at <span

<span id="fn_467"></span>[277:1](pf30.htm#fr_467.md) Since completing the
foregoing chapter I have seen the work entitled *Plant Lore, Legends,
and Lyrics; embracing the Myths, Traditions, Superstitions, and
Folk-lore of the Plant Kingdom*. By Richard Folkard, Jun. London, 1884.
In the first three chapters the reader will find valuable supplementary
reading on "The World-Trees of the Ancients," "The Trees of Paradise,"
"The Tree of Adam," "Sacred Trees of all Nations," etc. Other chapters
treat of "Plant Symbolism," "Plant Language," and of the fabulous trees
and miracle plants which play so important a part in the history of
religious and scientific credulity. Should any reader thereof be
inclined to claim that "the progress of science" has forever done away
with such ignorant mediæval mystagogy, he will do well to turn to *The
Weekly Inter-Ocean*, Chicago, Dec. 11, 1884, in which, in an illustrated
article entitled "The Tree of Life," we are informed that "science has
now discovered in a most unexpected manner both the Tree and the River
of Life." The former is the brain and spinal cord of man. "We do not
mean that the brain merely looks like a tree or resembles one
externally. We are not dealing with analogies. But we do mean that the
brain and spinal cord are an actual tree. By the most rigid scientific
examination it is shown to fill the ideal type and plan of a tree more
completely than any tree of the vegetable kingdom. The spinal cord is
the trunk of this great tree. Its roots are the nerves of feeling and
motion branching out over the body. . . . The Tree of Life is planted in
the midst of many others, for the heart is a tree, the lungs are a tree,
and the pancreas, stomach, liver, and all those vital organs. The brain
is its radiant and graceful foliage. The mental faculties are classified
in twelve groups by the most recent scientific analysis. This Tree bears
twelve kinds of fruit. . . . On each side of the Tree of Life is the
great River of Life. Let us lay a man down with his head to the north,
and his arms stretched to the west and to the east. The River of Life
has its four heads in the four chambers of the heart, the two auricles
and the two ventricles. The branches of this river pass upward to the
head, 'the land of gold,' <span id="page_278">p. 278</span> eastward to
the left and westward to the right arm and lung. But greatest of all the
branches, 'The River, or Phrath,' are the aorta and vena cava, reaching
southward to the trunk and lower limbs. In branching over the body this
river divides into four parts at seventeen different points. Two
branches of the river form a network around the very trunk of the tree,
and spread upward among its expanding branches. The blood is the 'Water
of Life,' and it looks 'as clear as crystal' when seen through the
microscope, the eye of science. It is three fourths water, and through
this are diffused the red cells and the living materials which are to
construct and to maintain the bodily organs." Had this article and its
antique-looking illustration been found in one of the Church fathers, it
would have afforded to a certain class of "scientists" great
edification.
