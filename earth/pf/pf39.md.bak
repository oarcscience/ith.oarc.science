### SECTION III.—THE RECEPTION ACCORDED TO "THE TRUE KEY."

As indicated in the text, the view of Ancient Cosmology presented in
chapter first of Part fourth is entirely at variance with that of all
our standard authorities. Professor Packard, of Yale College, remarks,
"If it is true, all our books and maps are wrong, and we must admit that
all scholars have been mistaken in their understanding of the ancient
records." In like manner, one of the foreign periodicals editorially
observes, "If it is correct, a most striking proof is given of the
possibility of many successive generations of archæologists, scientists,
and scholars failing to catch the entire drift and spirit of ancient
legends and literature in their cosmic teachings and relations." Under
these circumstances the ordinary reader seems entitled to some further
information before being asked to give it his adherence.

The new view, then, was first published in the columns of "The
Independent," New York, August 25, 1881. In March of the following year
a second and enlarged edition appeared in "The Boston University Year
Book," vol. ix. Soon after a third edition was issued as a pamphlet by
Messrs. Ginn and Heath, of Boston. In each case it was entitled "The
True Key to Ancient Cosmology and Mythical Geography," and was
illustrated by the diagram which stands as frontispiece to this work.

Copies of the paper in each of its successive editions were promptly
forwarded—usually with a brief personal note—to the most competent
scholars in the universities of Athens, Rome, Berlin, Leipsic,
Heidelberg, Bonn, Leyden, London, Oxford, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Belfast,
and Dublin. As might be expected an interesting and varied
correspondence ensued. Of many of the letters the writer does not feel
that he has the right to

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

make any public use; but in printing the following extracts he believes
that he violates no proprieties.

A. H. Sayce, of the University of Oxford, one of the most distinguished
of living professors of Comparative Philology, after reading a
preliminary sketch, wrote to the author as follows:—

Provisionally, I may say that your view seems to me eminently reasonable
and likely to clear up several difficulties. Certainly it throws light
on the voyage of Odysseus, more particularly on the visit to Hades.

I look forward to the appearance of your book, which will be of great
value to students of the past.

In more recent communications Professor Sayce has used still stronger
expressions of personal acquiescence.

The following are all from letters written before the publication of
"Homer's Abode of the Dead."

Right Hon. William E. Gladstone, author of "Homeric Studies," "Juventus
Mundi," "*Homeric Synchronism*," etc.:—

<span class="small">I have received with much interest and pleasure the
communications you have been good enough to address to me on the Homeric
Cosmology. Very long ago I became convinced that Homer proceeded, not on
the idea commonly assigned to him, of the earth as a plane, but on the
conception of a spherical or convex surface. My views have long been set
forth: fundamentally, I am at one with you, and when (if ever) my time
of leisure shall arrive, I shall try to learn whether, in the points
where you differ from or go beyond me, you have not been the more
thorough and accurate of the two.</span>

Robert K. Douglas, of the British Museum, and Professor of Chinese in
King's College, London:—

<span class="small">I read your Key with great interest; and, without
having made any special study of the subject, I must say that to my mind
it explains most satisfactorily the Homeric Cosmology.</span>

Richard Dacre Archer-Hind, Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge,
England:—

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

<span class="small">I must say that your explanation of ancient
cosmology seems to me very simple and natural. It certainly throws a
flood of light upon several points which were before very obscure. I am
glad to hear that it is approved by so distinguished an Orientalist as
Dr. Rost, Librarian of the India Office, London.</span>

C. P. Tiele, D. D., Professor of the History of Religions in the
University of Leyden, Holland:—

<span class="small">After perusing your paper a second time, I cannot
but express my opinion that your hypothesis is very plausible and
ingenious. The conception of the world as a sphere is not so young as is
generally thought. . . . I think you are right in identifying the wide
Olympus with the highest heaven. . . . Your description agrees very well
with the ancient cosmography of the Babylonians. With you I am satisfied
that there is no real difference between mythical Olympus and heaven,
and that all earthly Olymps (as there are several of them) are only
localizations of the same heavenly abode of the gods.</span>

Howard Crosby, D. D., LL. D., ex-Chancellor of the University of New
York:—

<span class="small">Your Key to Ancient Cosmology is to me most
satisfactory. I believe you have made a valuable discovery.</span>

W. D. Whitney, LL. D., Professor of Sanskrit and Comparative Philology,
Yale College:

<span class="small">I have looked with some care through your exposition
of your view respecting the ancient conceptions of the cosmos, and find
it very ingenious and suggestive, and worthy of careful comparison with
the expressions of ancient authors on the subject.</span>

Dr. Charles R. Lanman, Professor of Sanskrit, Harvard University:—

<span class="small">The Key I have read once more, and think it is very
simple, ingenious and adequate for the explanation of a great variety of
heretofore perplexing allusions.</span>

W. S. Tyler, D. D., LL. D., Professor of the Greek Language and
Literature, Amherst College:—

<span id="page_453">p. 453</span>

<span class="small">Permit me to thank you for the paper. Perhaps no one
key will unlock all the chambers of the labyrinth of ancient cosmology
and mythical geography. But I believe yours comes the nearest to it of
any that has yet been found.</span>

William A. Packard, Professor of the Latin Language and Literature,
College of New Jersey, Princeton:—

Dr. Warren's pamphlet gives the result of ingenious and able research,
which claims very careful consideration. It does seem to act very widely
as a solvent in interpreting ancient cosmogonies. Its elucidation of
Homeric expressions is very striking./4

Stephen D. Peet, Editor of "American Antiquarian and Oriental Journal:"—

<span class="small">I believe that you have struck a very rich field in
your pamphlet on the ancient cosmology. I have long surmised that there
was something back of the astrology of the ancients which had exerted a
great influence on the religious conceptions, and even on the literary
and speculative thoughts of the ancients, but have to thank you for
putting together the facts so as to discover the key.</span>

J. Henry Thayer, D. D., late Professor of Greek and N. T.
Interpretation, Andover Theological Seminary, now Professor of the same
in Harvard University Divinity School:—

<span class="small">Allow me to express my great interest in your Key to
Ancient Cosmology. It gives one a sense of relief amounting to
satisfaction at its very first perusal. I shall take great interest in
teaching it.</span>

James Freeman Clarke, D. D., author of "Ten Great Religions," etc.:—

<span class="small">It seems to me to throw much light on many passages
in the classic writers. . . . I cannot help thinking that your view will
be a key to unlock many obscure passages.</span>

The seven following extracts fairly illustrate the mass of the
communications received since the publication of "Homer's Abode of the
Dead," which paper was issued in

<span id="page_454">p. 454</span>

advance of the present volume simply as a further illustration of the
correctness and utility of "The True Key." Each is from the pen of a
European scholar of first rank, and the last of them from one of the
most widely known of German Egyptologists. Not having as yet permission
to use the names of the writers, they are here withheld.

I thank you very much for sending me the "Boston University Year Book,"
containing your interesting article on the Underworld of Homer.

Homeric interpretation long and (I think) absurdly placed the way to the
Underworld in the West; but I am glad at least to acknowledge that from
the West—that is, from you and your country—much light has been thrown
upon the Underworld of Homer.

In 1868 I went a long way, in a work then published, towards the
doctrine that the entrance to the Underworld was beneath the solid
earth-mass, as, in 1858, I had endeavored to destroy the prevailing
notion about the road by the West.

I regard with amazement the mass of false interpretations of Homer which
a quarter of a century ago I found prevailing, and of which I think we
are gradually getting rid.

One very great source of aid has been the opening up of Egyptian and
Assyrian knowledge, and from this quarter I believe that more aid will
yet be drawn.

With you I think that the supposed inconsistencies of Homer about the
Underworld are really ascribable wholly, or in the main, to his
interpreters.

 

Many thanks for your letter and for the interesting paper in the "Boston
University Year Book" which has followed it. The illustration of your
theory which is furnished by the Voyage of the Egyptian Sindbad is very
striking, and must be most gratifying to you. I can find no objection to
your view except those suggested by the original meaning of the words
*Amenti* and *Erebos* (Assyrian *eribu* = *’erebh*); and I am therefore
inclined to subscribe to all that Professor Tiele has written you in
regard to it. That in Homer the earth is supposed to be a sphere, with
Olympos above and Tartaros below, clears up every difficulty.

<span id="page_455">p. 455</span>

I read your paper with great interest and pleasure. Now again you have
put your favorite thesis so clearly and forcibly that I incline more and
more to your opinion. I only wait, before surrendering, for some leisure
to go accurately over the principal facts and citations.

 

I have read your paper with great interest. Your explanation makes
things clear, at any rate, though I must read the Odyssey again before
venturing to affirm that you see things as Homer saw them.

 

Accept my best thanks for your "Year Book" for 1883, with its excellent
and interesting dissertation upon "Homer's Abode of the Dead." Not being
a Homerologist, I am hardly entitled to express an opinion, but your
argument seems to me conclusive.

Your paper has an especial interest for me, inasmuch as it shows that
there was less difference between the cosmography of Homer and the
cosmographies of his successors than we had been brought to suppose.
(*The modest writer of the foregoing is one of the most eminent
Hellenists of Cambridge, Eng.*)

 

I have to thank you for your new contribution to our knowledge with
reference to the conceptions of the ancients as to the shape of the
earth. Your paper on the "Navel of the Earth" is full of interesting and
important information. My only doubt is whether the time has come for
such wide generalizations as you propose. However, our science wants
centrifugal as well as centripetal forces, and a discoverer must not be
afraid of places marked "Dangerous."

 

<span class="smallcaps">Hochgeehrter Herr Collega</span>:

Freundlichen Dank für Ihre gütigen Zeilen und den sie begleitenden
interessanten Aufsatz. Ihre Hypothese ist höchst überraschend, und
würde, sollte sich ihre Richtigkeit auf ganz feste Füsse stellen lassen,
in der That mit einem Male Ordnung in eine besonders krauss verwirrte
Frage bringen. . . . Sobald es Ihnen nachzuweisen gelingt, dass in der
Volksvorstellung der Griechen aus früherer Zeit die Erde kugelförmig

<span id="page_456">p. 456</span>

<span class="small">war, werden Sie die Schlacht gewonnen haben, und
Niemand wird es fürder wagen dürfen die Stimme gegen Ihre Ansicht zu
erheben. Es will mir nicht unmöglich scheinen, Spuren solcher Anschauung
zu finden, zumal da die Egypter ganz gewiss schon früh Kenntniss von der
Kugelgestalt der Erde besassen. . . . Trotz dieser Bedenken hat mich Ihr
Aufsatz lebhaft interessirt. Leider werde ich aus Gesundheitsrücksichten
den Orientalisten-Congress zu Leyden nicht besuchen dürfen; es sollte
mich aber freuen, wenn die von Ihnen so geistreich angeregte
interessante Frage während desselben zur Discussion käme.</span>

More and more decided are the latest verdicts of American scholars. The
following are a half dozen specimens from a considerable collection.

The Rev. A. P. Peabody, D. D., LL. D., Professor Emeritus in Harvard
University:—

<span class="small">I have read not only with pleasure, but also with
profit, your essay on Homer's "Abode of the Dead." Your theory accords
with my impression, and makes that impression—before vague and with less
than sufficient reason—definite and well grounded.</span>

C. C. Everett, D. D., Dean of the Theological Faculty of Harvard
University, and Professor of Comparative Theology:—

<span class="small">So far as Homer is concerned, your view is certainly
fitted to remove grave difficulties.</span>

J. R. Boise, D. D., LL. D., Professor in the Baptist Union Theological
Seminary, Chicago:—

<span class="small">The able and learned article on Homer's "Abode of
the Dead" has interested me deeply, and I believe your view is the
correct one.</span>

Edwin Post, Ph. D., Professor of Latin, Indiana Asbury University,
Greencastle, Ind.:—

<span class="small">I have recently re-read your monograph on Ancient
Cosmology,</span>

<span id="page_457">p. 457</span>

<span class="small">and I am more and more convinced that your startling
hypothesis will be verified more and more by comparative study.</span>

George Zabriskie Gray, S. T. D., Dean of the Episcopal Theological
School, Cambridge, Mass.:—

<span class="small">I have read your treatise with great interest, and
desire to thank you for your work. It seems to me that your theory meets
the test of all theories, that of accounting for the facts that cannot
otherwise be reconciled. Besides thus reconciling the statements of
ancient authors regarding the world and the underworld, your theory
enables us to see in their writings many new and fruitful suggestions
regarding matters hitherto unnoticed and unsuspected. Trusting that this
treatise may receive the attention and currency which it so eminently
deserves, I remain, etc., etc.</span>

Rev. A. B. Hyde, D. D., Professor of Greek in Allegheny College,
Meadville, Pa.:—

<span class="small">I seem to have found in you a guide in a "mighty
maze." Homer has been so long waiting, not for an observer, but for some
one to teach us how to observe, a seer to show us how to see. The more I
reflect upon your scheme of his cosmology, the more I am struck with its
beauty and accuracy; that is, its harmony with the Homeric
utterances.</span>

The following does not exactly belong in this place, but, coming from an
inspired prophet of God, it seems entitled to a somewhat exceptional
treatment. The writer's name indicates a Polish nationality, and his
peculiar use of the German language somewhat confirms the supposition
that he was not to the manner born. His authoritative announcement of
the early restoration at the North Pole of the "curseless" primeval
Paradise is well calculated to relieve any undue melancholy into which
any of our converts, meditating upon the lost Eden, may chance to fall:—

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">Königsberg, in
Preussen</span>, *den 2<sup>ten</sup> Mai*, 1884.</span>

<span class="small"><span class="smallcaps">Werthgeschätzter Herr
Professor</span>!—Mit freudigem Staunen lese ich heute in der hiesigen
Hartungschen Zeitung folgende Mittheilung: "Die Lage des Paradieses
ausfindig zu machen, das ist jetzt das Thema um welches sich das
Gespräch</span>

<span id="page_458">p. 458</span>

in den eleganten Salons der geistigen Aristokratie Boston's, des
amerikanischen Athens’ dreht, seitdem Professor Dr. Warren der dortigen
Universität, in einer langen wissenschaftlichen Abhandlung bewiesen,
dass nur allein am Nordpol das Paradies gelegen haben kann. Den Einwand
wie ein Mensch am Nordpol bei solcher Kälte Adam heitzen konnte,
widerlegt der fromme und gelehrte Mann dadurch, dass es jedenfalls
früher dort wärmer gewesen sei. Dr. Warren ist sehr dafür, eine
Expedition auszuschicken, um seine auf 'wissenschaftliche
Voranssetzungen' gestützte Schlussfolgerungen zu beweisen."

Diese Mittheilung ist mir aus folgendem Grunde eine
freudige-interessante weil, wie Sie es glauben, dass am Anfange der
Menschheit das fluchlose Paradies am Nordpol stattgefunden, ich es
glaube, dass ein solch fluchloses und noch herrlicheres Paradies eben
auch daselbst am Nordpol in nicht ferner Zukunft stattfinden wird.

Ich bitte Sie nun ergebenst, Ihre diese Wissenschaft betreffenden Gründe
mir ehestens gefälligst mittheilen zu wollen, um zu ersehen, ob diese
Ihre Gründe diese wichtigen Vergangenheits-Zustände betreffend, mit den
meinigen, die eine noch wichtigere Zukunft betreffen, auf eben demselben
Standpunkt der heiligen Schrift und der Geographie beruhen. Ich bin kein
Studirter der Weltwissenschaft, also auch nicht der Geographie, und
ebenso wenig ein menschlich Studirter der Theologie, jedoch aber ein
"göttlich-studirter" Theologe. Kraft dieser meiner göttlichen Ausbildung
oder unmittelbar von Gott mir gegebenen Offenbarung—die auch Blicke in
die Tiefen der Gottheit mitsichführt, ist auch dieses bis vor einigen
Jahren verborgen gewesene Geheimniss der nahen Zukunft mir entsiegelt in
Uebereinstimmung der heiligen Schrift und der Geographie.

Auf diese religiöse und natürliche Wahrheit sicher mich stützend und
berufend, bin ich mit Ihrer Anschauung ganz übereinstimmend, dass am
Nordpol das in Folge des Sündenfalles zerstörte Paradies stattgefunden
hat.

Ich hoffe dass wir beiderseits auf dem Grunde dieser unserer
Uebereinstimmung in nähere Bekanntschaft mit einander nach Gottes
Wohlgefallen kommen werden. In diesem Vertrauen zu Ihnen erwarte ich
eine baldige Erfüllung meiner eben an Sie gerichteten Bitte,—mit
Hochachtung,

Ergebenst,

—— ——.
