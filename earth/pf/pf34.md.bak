### CHAPTER II.

#### THE BEARING OF OUR RESULTS ON THE STUDY OF ANCIENT LITERATURE.

<span class="small">And the Greeks, who surpassed all men in ingenuity,
appropriated to themselves the greater part of these things,
exaggerating them, and adding to them various ornaments which they wove
into this foundation in every style, in order to charm by the elegance
of the myths. Hence Hesiod and the famed cyclic poets drew their
theogonies, their gigantomachies, their mutilations of the gods, and in
hawking them about everywhere they have supplanted the true narrative.
And our ears, accustomed to their fictions, familiar to us for several
centuries past, guard as a precious deposit the fables which they
received by tradition, as I remarked when I began to speak; and, rooted
by time, this belief has become so difficult to dislodge that to the
greater number the truth appears like a story told for amusement, while
the corruption of the tradition is looked upon as the truth itself—<span
class="smallcaps">Philo of Byblos</span>.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Summing</span> up the most probable results of
all his investigations, Darwin states as his opinion that man must be
considered as "descended from a hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail
and pointed ears, probably arboreal in his habits, and an inhabitant of
the Old World." <span id="fr_531"></span>[1](#fn_531.md)

According to Häckel, this *Homo primigenius* was a blackish,
woolly-haired, prognathous, ape-like being, with a long, narrow head.
His body was entirely covered with hair, and he was unable to speak.

In reading most fashionable writers upon ancient mythology and
literature, one would think that they conceived of the writers of the
Vedic Hymns and the authors of the myths of classic literature as very
early and but slightly developed descendants of this hairy *Homo
Darwinius*. Thus, according to Mr.

<span id="page_327">p. 327</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Keary, at the time
that the myth of the Cyclops originated, "men *really believed* that the
stormy sky was a being and the sun his eye." <span
id="fr_532"></span>[1](#fn_532.md) Indeed, it might almost appear, from
another passage in the same book, that at the period when this
Cyclops-faith was reached men had arrived at quite an advanced stage as
compared with the earlier one, when as yet they knew too little to look
up at the sky at all, and had an idea that the branches of the trees
extended quite to heaven. "The power of gazing upward to heaven," he
says, "came to us not all at once, but gradually, through lapse of time.
Savages are said scarcely ever to raise their eyes, and their heads are
naturally inclined with a downward gaze, so that it must be an effort
for them to look at the sky and the heavenly bodies. Primeval man lived
upon roots and berries, or on the lesser animals and the vermin which he
gathered from the soil, and so habit as well as nature kept his eyes
fixed upon the ground. We need not therefore wonder if, in their
half-glances upward, our forefathers had not leisure to observe that the
tree-top was *not really* close against the sky. They may well have
deemed that the upper branches hid themselves in infinitely remote
ethereal regions." <span id="fr_533"></span>[2](#fn_533.md)

The work which such men make in interpreting ancient literature and
thought is strange enough. The ascription to Agni of the same supreme
worship which the bard has just paid to Varuna or Mitra is explained as
due to the extreme "shortness of the memory" of early men. <span
id="fr_534"></span>[3](#fn_534.md) Only a knowledge of

<span id="page_328">p. 328</span>

a most limited portion of the earth's surface can be conceded to any of
the ancient nations. The early Aryans sing of the Ocean and of ships of
an hundred oars, but it must not for a moment be supposed that they had
ever seen or heard of the real Ocean; they had simply originated in
their imaginations a mythical one. <span id="fr_535"></span>[1](#fn_535.md)
In such hands the immortal Iliad becomes merely "a tale of land-battle,
the theatre of whose action is limited to the two shores of the Ægæan,
the known world of the Greek." <span id="fr_536"></span>[2](#fn_536.md)
Though the Homeric poems betray in various places an acquaintance with
astronomy, and actually name various constellations, yet, when the
question is raised as to how the poet conceived of the return of the sun
during the night from the West to the East, even Mr. Bunbury silences
us, telling us that in Homer's day nobody had ever thought of such a
question! <span id="fr_537"></span>[3](#fn_537.md)

Illustrations of this worse than mediæval ignorance and distortion of
ancient thought and language could be multiplied to almost any extent.
But as some selection must be made, it may perhaps be best to confine
ourselves to three or four points in a field comparatively familiar to
all readers likely to peruse these pages,—the field of Homeric
cosmology. If we succeed according to our expectation we

<span id="page_329">p. 329</span>

shall make it plain that those interpreters of Homer whose conceptions
of Greek culture are derived from current Darwinistic anthropology
rather than from the poems themselves, demonstrate, by the number and
character of their exegetical entanglements, the entire incorrectness of
their fundamental assumption. <span id="fr_538"></span>[1](#fn_538.md)

1\. The question just touched upon, the Movement of the Sun, is as good
as any with which to begin, and by which to show the embarrassments into
which accepted interpreters have continually fallen in consequence of
denying to the ancients a knowledge of the spherical figure of the
Earth.

Opening Keightley, we find the customary assertion that "according to
the ideas of the Homeric and Hesiodic ages the Earth was a round, flat
disk, around which the river Ocean flowed." Then he says that "men,
seeing the sun rise in the East and set in the West each day, were
naturally led to inquire how his return to the East was effected." He
alludes to the fact that "in the Odyssey, when Helios ends his diurnal
career, he is said to go under the Earth;" but he adds that "it is not
easy to determine whether the poet meant that he then passed through
Tar-taros back to the East during the night." The "beautiful fiction of
the solar cup or basin," he thus describes: "If, then, as there is
reason to suppose, it was the popular belief that a lofty mountainous
ring ran round the edge of the Earth, it was easy for the poets to feign
that on reaching the western

<span id="page_330">p. 330</span>

stream of Ocean Helios himself, his chariot and his horses, were
received into a magic cup or boat, made by Hephaistos, which, aided by
the current, conveyed him during the night round the northern part of
the earth, where his light was only enjoyed by the happy Hyperboreans,
the lofty Rhiphæans concealing it from the rest of mankind. They must
also have supposed that the cup continued its course during the day,
compassing the earth every twenty-four hours." Of this fiction, however,
Keightley confesses, "neither Homer nor Hesiod evinces any knowledge."
After quoting various later poets, therefore, he concludes as follows:
"From a consideration of all these passages it may seem to follow that
the ideas of the poets on this subject were very vague and fleeting.
Perhaps the prevalent opinion was that the Sun rested himself and his
weary steeds in the West, and *then returned to the East*." <span
id="fr_539"></span>[1](#fn_539.md) By what passage, however, whether *via*
the North or underneath the supposed "flat disk" of the Earth, Keightley
makes no further effort to determine.

The difficulty in the way of supposing that in Homer's thought the
nocturnal sun passed underneath the flat Earth-disk, through Tartaros,
back to the East, is that the poet invariably represents this Underworld
as forever unvisited by sunlight. In view of this, and of the ominous
silence of Homer as to any winged cup sailing round the earth to the
North, some interpreters warn us against expecting any consistency of
thought in poetry so primitive. <span id="fr_540"></span>[2](#fn_540.md)

<span id="page_331">p. 331</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Schwenck goes so
far in this direction as to suggest that the island Aiaiè is a creation
of the imagination in the far West, called forth for the express purpose
of giving the mind a kind of resting-place, where it can leave the
sinking Helios without troubling itself with inconvenient speculations
as to how he is to get back to the Orient at the appointed hour. He
says: "The Homeric poetry could not allow the Sun and the daylight to
rest during the night in the Homeric Hades, for in that case Hades would
have been illuminated. It therefore supposes an island afar off at the
end of the world, where Helios and Dawn, after they have passed over
across the heavens, repose at night, and whence, after this repose, they
in the morning again ascend the sky. An exact explanation as to how they
come westwardly to this island and then in the morning rise in the East
lies aloof from the poetry, for in Homer nothing of systems is to be
found, and only each object taken by itself is correct and clear." <span
id="fr_541"></span>[1](#fn_541.md)

Assume once a spherical Earth, and all these difficulties of the
interpreters are at an end. East and West touch each other. Mr.
Gladstone, before abandoning fully the flat-earth theory, came as near
the truth as he possibly could and not hit it, when, speaking of Helios,
he wrote: "The fact of his sporting with the oxen night and morning goes
far to show that Homer did not think of the Earth as a plane, but round,
perhaps, as upon a cylinder, and

<span id="page_332">p. 332</span>

believed that the West and East were in contact." <span
id="fr_542"></span>[1](#fn_542.md) He mistook, however, in suggesting
Thrinakia as the place of contact. It was rather on the meridian of
Aiaiè, for we are expressly told that

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

                  ὅθι τ᾽ Ἠοῦς ἠριγενείης  
οἰκία καὶ χοροί εἰσι καὶ ἀντολαὶ Ἡελίοιο.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "There are the
abodes and dance-grounds of Aurora, there the risings of the Sun." <span
id="fr_543"></span>[2](#fn_543.md)

Nor could anything be more natural than that the poet, conceiving of the
world of living men as Homer did, and sending out his thoughts eastward
and westward in search of the meeting-place of evening and morning,
should fix upon the meridian opposite his own, the very place and only
place where his eastward-journeying thought and his westward journeying
thought would of necessity meet. His eastern hemisphere would naturally
extend round eastward until it met the edge of the hemisphere extending
round westward. On that farthest off meridian, <span
id="fr_544"></span>[3](#fn_544.md) therefore, he made the old day give
place to the new, eve to morn. That was the doubtful line on which
Odysseus and his companions were no longer clear: "where was East and
where was West, where Helios went behind the Earth or where he rose
again." <span id="fr_545"></span>[4](#fn_545.md)

2\. The false assumption that Homer's Earth is flat has created all the
noted controversies connected with his representations of the location
of Hades. This question has divided Homeric interpreters into more than
a dozen differing camps. Their mutually

<span id="page_333">p. 333</span>

contradictory solutions of the problem would be the laughing-stock of
the opposers of classical studies, were these latter only sufficiently
acquainted with the world's scholarship to be aware of their existence.
To review and solve the question in this place would detain the general
reader too long, but in the Appendix, Section sixth, the assertions here
made will be found abundantly verified.

3\. The same flat-earth assumption is further responsible for all the
difficulties which interpreters have found in representing the Ocean,
and in general the Water System of the Earth, in accordance with the
Homeric data.

These difficulties have been neither few nor small. Four of them we will
here notice. And, first, that growing out of the statement that from
deep-flowing Ocean "flow all rivers and every sea, and all fountains and
deep wells."  <span id="fr_546"></span>[1](#fn_546.md) Völcker pronounces
this "hard to explain." He says, "An immediate in-streaming of the Ocean
into the sea can scarcely be meant, partly because sea-water and
ocean-water do not unite, partly because Homer knows of no such
in-streamings in the Phasis and at the Pillars of Hercules, and the
origination of rivers in this way would not be thinkable." <span
id="fr_547"></span>[2](#fn_547.md) Other writers, devoted to the
illustration of ancient thought, seem not to have stopped to inquire
whether rivers flowing up-stream from the Ocean to the hills were
thinkable or not, and have gravely set before the youthful student
diagrams constructed on this plan as the true representation of Homeric
thought! <span id="fr_548"></span>[3](#fn_548.md)

<span id="page_334">p. 334</span>

A second embarrassing question has been this: "If the Ocean-stream
surrounded and constituted the outermost boundary of the Earth-disk,
what sustained the Ocean-stream itself and constituted its further
shore?" As Völcker says, "Who on the further side held in the billows of
the vast World-river, that they did not flow off into the empty spaces
of heaven? Was it a narrow strip of the inner Earth, or was it formless
chaos, or the descending rim of the sky, or the inner power of the
waters themselves?" <span id="fr_549"></span>[1](#fn_549.md) Buchholz says,
"By what the Ocean itself was in turn bounded remains unclear. The
child-like imagination of the Homeric age contented itself with that
confused *halbverschwommene* conception." <span
id="fr_550"></span>[2](#fn_550.md) The most natural answer, especially from
the point of view represented by Buchholz, who, with Ukert and others,
claims that the Homeric heaven was literally metallic, would seem to be
Völcker's third supposition, namely, that the rim of the metallic sky
constitutes the outer limit of the Ocean-stream. <span
id="fr_551"></span>[3](#fn_551.md) This would correspond, also, with the
general notion that the circular disk of the earth "divided the hollow
sphere of the universe into two equal parts." <span
id="fr_552"></span>[4](#fn_552.md) It would also exactly correspond to

<span id="page_335">p. 335</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Flach's curious
and elaborate representation of the Hesiodic world in his recent work on
the Hesiodic cosmogony. <span id="fr_553"></span>[1](#fn_553.md) Still
further it would seem best to accord with Homer's language describing
the heavenly constellations as bathing in the Ocean. On the other hand,
however, such a supposition would be incompatible with the Homeric
representation that the farther shore presented a suitable
landing-place, and especially a landing-place situated, like that of
Odysseus, in the Underworld. Moreover, it would be incompatible with the
current notion that the Homeric heaven was supported upon mountain
pillars *standing on the Earth inside* the Ocean-stream, like Mount
Atlas in western Libya. <span id="fr_554"></span>[2](#fn_554.md) Again,
therefore, the question returns, "Given a flat Earth surrounded by the
Ocean-river, what constitutes the farther shore, and how can the mariner
who lands upon it speak of himself as in the Underworld?" The learned
Völcker leaves the subject with the unsatisfying observation, "The poet
has not answered our questions."

A third embarrassment dwelt upon by the same advocate of the flat-earth
theory is that, as he understands Homer, Hellas was the centre of the
circular Earth-disk, and not more than "ten or eleven days’ sail" from
the Ocean in any direction; and yet the poet makes it eighteen days’
sail by the shortest route from Ogygia to the land of the Phæacians, and
at least another in the same direction to

<span id="page_336">p. 336</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Hellas, and yet
Ogygia is the navel or centre of the sea. "These," says he, "are
insurmountable difficulties for him who would measure with the
compasses. Rather should we learn from this example what folk-faith and
folk-tales are. Where there is no agreement we should not create one by
main force. The Earth is circular and Hellas is its centre; that was the
popular faith. But the situation of the Ocean and the extent of the
Earth are at the same time such fluctuating ideas, and all any way
extended voyages seem to the poet to extend to such a terrific distance,
that it may well happen to him to overpass all bounds out in that realm
where were, so to speak, the most terrific of all distances." <span
id="fr_555"></span>[1](#fn_555.md) Thus the nodding Homer is again caught
in contradiction, and to accommodate his exaggerated and terrific
distances even Gladstone at first felt constrained to change the figure
of the Earth-disk itself, and to present it as a vast parallelogram more
extended from North to South than from East to West. <span
id="fr_556"></span>[2](#fn_556.md)

The fourth difficulty involved in the current interpretation is that
experienced in harmonizing the poet's representations of the Ocean, as
commonly understood, with his representations of the movements of the
sun, as commonly understood. The sun at evening certainly ceases to be
visible to men. According to the Homeric representation he returns to
the flowing of the Ocean. <span id="fr_557"></span>[3](#fn_557.md) His
bright light sinks in it <span id="fr_558"></span>[4](#fn_558.md) At his
rising it is also from the Ocean

<span id="page_337">p. 337</span>

that he begins to mount the sky. <span id="fr_559"></span>[1](#fn_559.md)
Yet his setting is also described as a going εἶς ὑπὸ γαῖαν, under or
behind the Earth. <span id="fr_560"></span>[2](#fn_560.md) How now, with a
flat circular disk for the Earth, and with a circumfluent Ocean in the
same plane, and with an eternally dark and un-sunned Hades just beyond
the Ocean-river to the westward, can these data be harmonized? If we
attempt to conceive of the Sun as literally sinking in the ocean and
hiding his light beneath its waters, he has not gone εἶς ὑπὸ γαῖαν, but
rather "in under" the Ocean. Moreover, the old difficulty reappears as
to how he shall get round into the East in time for his rising again.
Furthermore, if he is the whole night concealed under the waves of the
Ocean, descending into it in the far West at his setting and ascending
out of it in the far East at his rising, how can we arrange for his
rejoicing himself night and morning with his oxen on the island of
Thrinakia? <span id="fr_561"></span>[3](#fn_561.md) But we cannot abandon
this whole supposition, and let the Sun set *beyond* and *behind* the
Ocean-stream, for that would be in the western Hades, where he never
shines. Nor yet, again, can we say that he descends to the surface of
the Ocean simply, and then, in his "cup," or otherwise, moves round to
the Orient by way of the North, for then, the Ocean being in
substantially the same plane as the abode of men, they would not be
overspread with darkness, but would enjoy, if not the spectacle of "the
midnight sun," at least the full light of a sun moving round the

<span id="page_338">p. 338</span>

horizon. On this supposition, too, Hades, just west of the river, would
also be equally illuminated. *Inside* the Ocean-stream he certainly does
not hide himself in the ground, for that would be incompatible with all
the passages associating his rising and setting with the Ocean. But if
he cannot be conceived of as setting on the hither side of the stream,
nor on the farther side, nor yet as resting on the Ocean, nor yet as
hiding beneath it, what possible conception of the matter remains?

All this trouble is the natural result of one false assumption,—the
assumption that Homer's Earth is a flat disk. Assume that it is a
sphere, and every one of these difficulties vanishes. Then, in causing
the Sun to descend to the Ocean in which lies Aiaiè the poet makes the
bed to which the king of day retires the same as that from which in the
morning he rises again. At the same time, from the poet's standpoint and
from the standpoint of the lands inhabited by the poet's countrymen,
each setting of the Sun was a going "behind the earth," to reappear on
the opposite side. This view of the movement of Helios solves every
perplexity; and if Homer had the knowledge of the Earth and Heavens
involved in the view, we may be sure he also knew as well as we do in
what sense the Ocean is the source of all springs and rivers, and for
what reason the equatorial Ocean never runs away for the lack of an
ultra-terrestrial shore.

4\. The same hermeneutical myopia which has thus minified and
misconceived every feature of Homer's cosmography has introduced and
maintained the now universal dogma that in the Homeric poems "Olympos is
always the Thessalian mountain" of

<span id="page_339">p. 339</span>

that name. <span id="fr_562"></span>[1](#fn_562.md) All our youth are
taught that "the early poets believed that the gods actually lived upon
the top of this mountain separating Macedonia and Thessaly. Even the
fable of the giants scaling heaven must be understood in a literal
sense; not that they placed Pelion and Ossa upon *the top* of Olympos to
reach the still higher *heaven*, but that they piled Pelion on the top
of Ossa and both on the *lower slopes* of Olympos to scale the summit of
Olympos itself, the abode of the gods." <span
id="fr_563"></span>[2](#fn_563.md) To settle the question negatively as
well as positively, revered German erudition solemnly declares, "The
gods of Homer *never* live in heaven." <span
id="fr_564"></span>[3](#fn_564.md) Such dogmatism challenges a fresh
investigation of the question.

Taking up this subject, Keightley remarks that if we were to follow the
teachings of Comparative Mythology we should have to locate the abode of
Homer's gods in the heights of heaven. His language is: "Were we to
follow analogy, and argue from the cosmology of other races of men, we
would say that the upper surface of the superior hemisphere was the
abode of the Grecian gods." <span id="fr_565"></span>[4](#fn_565.md) He
goes on to allude to the conceptions of the Scandinavians and some other
peoples, and adds, "Hence we might be led to infer that Olympos, the
abode of the Grecian gods, was synonymous with heaven, and that the
Thessalian mountain and those others which bore the same name were
called after the original heavenly hill."

It is a pity that the learned author could not have

<span id="page_340">p. 340</span>

accepted this very sensible conclusion; but he did not. Rejecting the
admitted intimations of Comparative Cosmology, he says, "A careful
survey, however, of those passages in Homer and Hesiod in which Olympos
occurs will lead us to believe that the Achæans held the Thessalian
Olympos, the highest mountain with which they were acquainted, to be the
abode of their gods."

The only passage specially referred to by Keightley, as establishing
this view, is the Iliad, xiv. 225 *seq*., where the language employed is
not at all inconsistent with the idea that, in descending from the
summit of Olympos, Hera descended from the northern sky. More elaborate
is the argument of Völcker, <span id="fr_566"></span>[1](#fn_566.md) but
its logical cogency is by no means admissible.

The true Homeric conception of the abode of the gods is far loftier,
grander, and more poetic than that given us by such interpreters.
According to the poet's real representation, that abode is "the wide
heaven,"—not the atmospheric heaven, οὐρανὸν ἐν αἰθέρι καὶ νεφέλῃσιν,
for this is a special possession of Zeus (Iliad, xv. 192); it is the
upper sky,

<span id="page_341">p. 341</span>

the celestial dome in which sun, moon, and stars wheel silently around
the Pole. To the early Greek, as to the early Perso-Aryan, it was easy
to conceive of this celestial dome as a heavenly mountain, vast,
majestic, of unearthly beauty, and peopled with glorious beings
invisible to mortals. And this heavenly mountain he called Olympos. The
Thessalian mount, the Bithynian, and all the dozen others of the same
name <span id="fr_567"></span>[1](#fn_567.md) were sacred only so far as
they symbolized and commemorated their heavenly original. In the
Odyssey, xi. 315, it is plain that Homer speaks of the Thessalian
Olympos along with other Thessalian mountains; <span
id="fr_568"></span>[2](#fn_568.md) but in general he means by Olympos the
heights of the northern heaven viewed as the proper abode of the
gods. <span id="fr_569"></span>[3](#fn_569.md)

The proofs of the incorrectness of the current

<span id="page_342">p. 342</span>

interpretation appear on almost every page of the Homeric poems. The
designation of the gods by the formula οἳ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν occurs
twice in the Iliad and sixteen times in the Odyssey, but the expressions
"who possess the wide heaven," in Odyssey, xix., line 40, and who
possess Olympos," line 43, are plainly identical in meaning. <span
id="fr_570"></span>[1](#fn_570.md) So in the Iliad, "the immortals who
possess the Olympian mansions" and "the gods who possess the wide
heaven" are unquestionably interchangeable phrases. <span
id="fr_571"></span>[2](#fn_571.md) Hence also "the Olympians," "the
Uranians," and "the Epouranians" are names of the same beings. <span
id="fr_572"></span>[3](#fn_572.md) In Hesiod's Theogony the expression
ἐντός Ὀλύμπου, "within Olympos," occurs no less than three times. <span
id="fr_573"></span>[4](#fn_573.md) To translate it according to the current
interpretation of Homer is to locate the palace of Zeus in the heart of
an earthly mountain and to transform the "*Lichtgestalten*" of his
heavenly court into Trolls.

In book twenty-four of the Iliad, verse ninety-seven,

<span id="page_343">p. 343</span>

we are told that Iris and Thetis were impelled up "to heaven" (ἐς
οὐρανὸν). But the moment the Father of gods and men begins discourse, he
says, "Thou hast come to Olympos, O goddess Thetis;" and in verse one
hundred twenty-one the bard resumes, "Thus he spoke; nor did the
silver-footed goddess Thetis disobey, but rushing impetuously, she
descended down from the tops of Olympos." <span
id="fr_574"></span>[1](#fn_574.md)

One of the most vivid of the pictures of Olympian life in the whole
Iliad is that portraying (book xv. 14 ff.) the punishment of Hera by
Zeus. In the literal translation of Buckley, it is thus rendered: "O
Hera, of evil arts, impracticable, thy stratagem has made noble Hector
cease from battle, and put his troops to flight. Indeed, I know not
whether again thou mayst not be the first to reap the fruits of thy
pernicious machinations, and I chastise thee with stripes. Dost thou not
remember when thou didst swing from on high, and I hung two anvils from
thy feet, and bound a golden chain around thy hands, that could not be
broken? And thou didst hang in the air and clouds, and the gods
commiserated thee throughout lofty Olympos; but standing around, they
were not able to release thee; but whomsoever I caught, seizing, I
hurled from the threshold *of heaven* till he reached the earth, hardly
breathing."

Although the words "of heaven" are supplied by the translator, the
contrast required by the expression

<span id="page_344">p. 344</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "reached the
earth" compels the supply in order to make good sense.

In book first Hephaistos gives his own account of this same hurling out
of heaven. He says, "Be patient, my mother, and although grieved
restrain thyself, lest with my own eyes I behold thee beaten, being very
dear to me; nor then, though full of grief, should I be able to assist
thee, for Olympian Zeus is difficult to be opposed. For upon a time
before this, when I desired to assist thee, having seized me by the
foot, he cast me down from the heavenly threshold (βηλοῦ
θεσπεσίοιο). <span id="fr_575"></span>[1](#fn_575.md) The whole day was I
hurled, and at the setting of the sun I fell on Lemnos, and but little
of life remained in me."

Nothing can well be plainer than that this whole scene is conceived of
as occurring high in the vault of heaven. To locate it on any
"many-peaked mountain" every way embarrasses the imagination. <span
id="fr_576"></span>[2](#fn_576.md) Moreover, Lemnos is not situated under

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Olympos, nor could
the word κάππεσον describe Hephaistos's motion in space from the one to
the other. So irresistible, indeed, is the right interpretation that
Keightley, unconscious of his inconsistency, elsewhere says, "The
favorite haunt of Hephaistos on earth was the isle of Lemnos. It was
here he fell when flung *from heaven* by Zeus for attempting to aid his
mother Hera." <span id="fr_577"></span>[1](#fn_577.md) In like manner
Professor Geddes, with a forgetfulness equally entertaining, writes of
Zeus "hurling Hephaistos over the *celestial battlements*," and of his
being "able to draw gods and earth and sea aloft *into the sky*." <span
id="fr_578"></span>[2](#fn_578.md)

The not less famous passage in the opening lines of book eighth is even
more conclusive: "Whomsoever of the gods I shall discover, having gone
apart from the rest, wishing to aid either the Trojans or the Greeks,
disgracefully smitten shall he return to Olympos; or, seizing, I will
hurl him into gloomy Tartaros, very far hence, where there is a very
deep gulf beneath the earth, and iron portals, and a brazen
threshold, <span id="fr_579"></span>[3](#fn_579.md) as far below Hades as
heaven is from earth; then shall he know by how much I am the most
powerful of all the gods. But come, ye gods, and try me, that ye may all
know. Having suspended a golden chain from heaven, do all ye gods and
goddesses suspend yourselves therefrom; yet would ye not draw down from
heaven to earth your supreme counselor Jove, not even if ye labor ever
so much: but whenever I, desiring, should

<span id="page_346">p. 346</span>

wish to pull it, I could draw it up together, earth, and ocean, and all;
then, indeed, would I bind the chain around the top of Olympos, and all
these should hang aloft. By so much do I surpass both gods and men."

Comment is unnecessary. Until the whole of a thing can be suspended upon
and supported by a part of itself, no interpreter can make the top of
Olympos in this passage signify the top of a mountain in Thessaly. <span
id="fr_580"></span>[1](#fn_580.md)

If any further evidence can be needed to show that no mountain of earth
can meet the requirements of the language of the Iliad respecting
Olympos, it is surely afforded in the passages already alluded to where
suppliants, addressing the gods as "Olympian," are said to stretch forth
their hands toward "the starry heavens." An example of this is the
following: "But the guardian of the Greeks, Gerenian Nestor, most
particularly prayed, stretching forth his hands to the starry heaven: 'O
Father Zeus, if ever any one in fruitful Argos, to thee burning the fat
thighs of either oxen or sheep, supplicated that he might return, and
thou didst promise

<span id="page_347">p. 347</span>

and assent, be mindful of these things, O Olympian, and avert the cruel
day.'" <span id="fr_581"></span>[1](#fn_581.md)

Nor is the language of the Odyssey less opposed to the prevailing
interpretation. Here Olympos is metaphorically spoken of precisely as we
speak of heaven: "For Olympos hath given me grief" (iv. 722). Again, in
a memorable passage, it is depicted in terms which plainly belong to no
sublunary sphere: "Thus having spoken, blue-eyed Athenè departed to
Olympos, where they say is forever the firm seat of the gods; it is
neither shaken by the winds, nor is it ever bedewed by the shower, nor
does the snow approach it; but a most cloudless serenity is spread out,
and white splendor runs over it, in which the blessed gods are delighted
all their days. To this place Athenè departed when she had admonished
the damsel." <span id="fr_582"></span>[2](#fn_582.md)

In book xx. 30, Athenè descends "from heaven" (οὐρανόθεν καταβᾶσα),
while in line 55 her return is described as "to Olympos." So in line 103
Zeus thunders

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

         ἀπ᾽ αἰγλήενος Ὀλύμπου  
ὑψόθεν ἐκ νεφέων,

</div>

but in line 113 the same thundering is described as

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

ἀπ᾽ οὐρανοῦ ἀστερόεντος.

</div>

As in the Iliad, so in the Odyssey, suppliants address their prayers
toward "the starry heaven;" <span id="fr_583"></span>[3](#fn_583.md)

<span id="page_348">p. 348</span>

and the gods who possess Olympos are called ὕπερθε μάρτυροι, or the
"witnesses on high." <span id="fr_584"></span>[1](#fn_584.md)

So unmistakable is this language and the entire usage of the Odyssey
that various recent writers, not emancipated from the traditional view
as respects the Iliad, have yet perceived and admitted the identity of
Ὄλυμπος and the upper οὐρανός in the former work. Among German scholars,
Faesi <span id="fr_585"></span>[2](#fn_585.md) and Ihne <span
id="fr_586"></span>[3](#fn_586.md) have expressed themselves in this sense,
and prominent among the Scotch, Professor Geddes. <span
id="fr_587"></span>[4](#fn_587.md) The latter says, "There is nothing in
the Odyssey which obliges us to think of *Mount* Olympos." Testimony
from such a quarter is of course all the more convincing.

In Homeric thought, then, the abode of the gods was where we should
antecedently expect to find it, namely, in the heights of heaven.
Considered with reference to the august sovereign of gods and men,

<span id="page_349">p. 349</span>

the polar sky-arch was a palace, the royal residence, the δῶμα or δόμος
of Zeus. <span id="fr_588"></span>[1](#fn_588.md) Viewed with reference to
its tints, steel-blue and gold, it was described as metallic, σιδήρεος,
χάλκεος and πολύχαλκος, terms which metallic interpreters like Voss and
Buchholz and Bunbury have pushed to absolute literalness. <span
id="fr_589"></span>[2](#fn_589.md) Conceived of as an ethereal height, it
was pictured as a heaven-high mount, "snowy" as its own white clouds.
Then to the climbing imagination, mounting height above height in the
vain attempt to reach the summit, the mountain became αἰπύς (Il., V.
367, 869; xv. 84); μακρός (II., i. 402, and in ten other passages);
πολυδειράς (Il., i. 499; v. 754; viii. 3); and πολύπτυχος (Il., viii.
411; xx. 5). This last description, "the Olympos *of many layers, or
thicknesses*," is peculiarly expressive. Instead of signifying the
"ridges" of a mountain or range of mountains, as Geddes and so many
before him have affirmed, it

<span id="page_350">p. 350</span>

pictures that world-old conception of a firmament, not single-storied,
but with heaven above heaven, to the "third," or the "seventh," or the
"ninth." These heavens were conceived of by Homer himself as in layers
one above another, like the curved *laminæ* (πτυχαὶ) of a shield. <span
id="fr_590"></span>[1](#fn_590.md) And what adds to the fitness of the
comparison and to the fitness of the cosmic adornment of Achilles’
shield is the fact that to the *omphalos* of a shield there corresponded
the central and ever-abiding *Omphalos* of the Skies.

5\. Finally, our larger and more rational interpretation of Homeric
ideas beautifully explains "the tall Pillars of Atlas," and solves the
multiform perplexities of the ruling authorities on this question.

In approaching the study of this subject several questions occur to
every thoughtful beginner, the answers to which he can nowhere find. For
instance: How can Homer speak of the Pillars of Atlas, using the plural,
when elsewhere in the early Greek mythology the representations always
point to only one? Again, if there is but one, and that in the West,
near the Gardens of the Hesperides, <span
id="fr_591"></span>[2](#fn_591.md) what corresponding supports sustain the
sky in the East, the North, and the South? Or, if Atlas's Pillar

<span id="page_351">p. 351</span>

is only one of many similar ones supporting heaven around its whole
periphery, how came it to be so much more famous than the rest? Or, if
Homer's plural indicates that all of them belonged to Atlas, how came
the idea of one Pillar to be so universally prevalent? If the support of
heaven was at many points, and at its outermost rim, how could Hesiod
venture to represent the whole vault as poised on Atlas's head and
hands? <span id="fr_592"></span>[1](#fn_592.md) Again, if it is the special
function of Atlas, or of his Pillar, to stand on the solid earth and
hold up the sky, he would appear to have no special connection with the
sea: why, then, should Homer introduce the strange statement that Atlas
"knows all the depths of the sea"? This certainly seems very mysterious.
Again, if the office of the Pillar or Pillars is to prop up the sky,
they of course sustain different relations to earth and heaven. They
bear up the one, and are themselves borne up by the other. Yet,
singularly enough, Homer's *locus classicus* places them in exactly the
same relation to the two. <span id="fr_593"></span>[2](#fn_593.md) Worse
than this, Pausanias unqualifiedly and repeatedly asserts that,
according to the myth, Atlas supports upon his shoulders "both earth and
heaven." <span id="fr_594"></span>[3](#fn_594.md) And with this corresponds

<span id="page_352">p. 352</span>

the language of Æschylus. <span id="fr_595"></span>[1](#fn_595.md) But what
sort of a poetic imagination is this which represents a mighty column as
upholding not only a vast super-incumbent weight, but also, and at the
same time, its own pedestal? Is this a specimen creation of that
immortal Hellenic genius, which the whole modern world is taught almost
to adore?

Turning to the authorities in textual and mythological interpretation,
our beginner finds no help. On the contrary, their wild guesses and
mutual contradictions only confuse him more and more. Völcker tells him,
with all the assuring emphasis of leaded type, that "in Atlas is given a
personification of the art of navigation, the conquest of the sea by
means of human skill, by commerce, and the gains of commerce." <span
id="fr_596"></span>[2](#fn_596.md) Preller instructs him to reject this
view, and to think of this mysterious son of Iapetos as a "sea-giant
representing the upbearing and supporting almightiness of the ocean in
contrast with the earth-shattering might of Poseidon." <span
id="fr_597"></span>[3](#fn_597.md) The classical dictionaries only perplex
him with multitudinous puerilities invented by ignorant Euhemeristic
scholiasts,—stories to the effect that the original Atlas was merely the
astronomer who first constructed an artificial globe to represent the
sky; or that he was a Northwest African, who, having ascended a lofty
promontory the better to observe the heavenly bodies, fell off into the
sea, and so gave

<span id="page_353">p. 353</span>

name both to the mountain and to the Atlantic Ocean. Schoemann does not
profess a positive and certain understanding of the matter, but suggests
that the mysterious Titan was in all probability "originally a gigantic
mountain-god" of some sort. <span id="fr_598"></span>[1](#fn_598.md)

Bryant at first makes Atlas a mountain supporting a temple or
temple-cave, called *Co-el*, house of God, whence "the Cœlus of the
Romans," vol. i., p. 274. In the next volume, however, he says that
"under the name of Atlas is meant the Atlantians." And quoting the
Odyssey, he translates thus: "*They* \[the Atlantians\] *had also long
Pillars, or obelisks, which referred to the sea, and upon which was
delineated the whole system both of heaven and earth;* ἀμπὶς, *all
around, both on the front of the obelisk and on the other sides*." <span
id="fr_599"></span>[2](#fn_599.md)

If our investigator asks, as did an ancient grammarian, how Atlas could
stand on the earth and support heaven on his head, if heaven was so far
removed that an anvil would require nine days and nights in which to
fall through the distance, Paley kindly explains that "the poet's notion
doubtless was that Atlas held up the sky near its junction with earth in
the far West." <span id="fr_600"></span>[3](#fn_600.md) In this case, of
course, a reasonably short giant would answer the purpose. If, after all
his consultations of authorities, our youth is still unsatisfied, and to
make a last effort for light turns to the illustrious Welcker, he learns
as an important

<span id="page_354">p. 354</span>

final lesson that when an ancient author says "heaven and earth," it is
not for a moment to be supposed that he literally means "heaven and
earth," and that, if they had remembered this, writers on mythology
would have spared themselves "a vast amount of brain-racking and
ineffectual *pro*-and-*contra* pleading." <span
id="fr_601"></span>[1](#fn_601.md) With this as the sole outcome of all his
researches, may not a beginner well despair of ever getting any
knowledge of the meaning of the myth, if, indeed, he can still imagine
it to have had a meaning?

Here, as everywhere, the truth at once explains and removes all the
difficulties which a false and groundless presupposition has created.

Once conceive of the Homeric world as we have reconstructed it, and how
clear and beautiful the conception of the Pillars of Atlas becomes! They
are simply the upright axes of earth and heaven. Viewed in their
relation to earth and heaven respectively, they are two; but viewed in
reference to the universe as an undivided whole, they are one and the
same. Being coincident, they are truly one, and yet they are ideally
separable. Hence singular or plural designations are equally correct and
equally fitting. Transpiercing the globe at the very "navel or centre of
the sea," Atlas's Pillar penetrates far deeper than any recess of the
waters’ bed, and he may well be said to "know the depths of the whole
sea." Or this statement may have reference to that primordial

<span id="page_355">p. 355</span>

sea in which his Pillar was standing when the geogonic and cosmogonic
process began. In this sense how appropriate and significant would it
have been if applied to Izanagi! <span id="fr_602"></span>[1](#fn_602.md)

Again, the association of Atlas with the Gardens of the Hesperides, so
far from disproving our interpretation, actually affords new
confirmation, since Æschylus, Pherecydes, and the oldest traditions
locate the Hesperides themselves, not in the West, but in the extreme
North, beyond the Rhiphæan Mountains, in the vicinity of the
Hyperboreans. <span id="fr_603"></span>[2](#fn_603.md) In fact, there are
very strong reasons for believing that these Gardens of the Hesperides
were nothing other than the starry gardens of the circumpolar sky; that
therefore the Hesperides were called the "Daughters of Night," and that
the great serpent

<span id="page_356">p. 356</span>

which assisted the nymphs in watching "the golden apples" was none other
than the constellation Draco, whose brilliant constituent *Alpha*, the
astronomer's Thuban, was, less than fifty centuries ago, the Pole-star
of our heaven. <span id="fr_604"></span>[1](#fn_604.md)

Once more, our interpretation perfectly harmonizes the passages which
represent Atlas as a heaven-supporter with those which represent him as
equally supporting earth. More than this, it reveals the curious fact
that Homer's description of the tall Pillars of Atlas identifies them
with the axes of earth and heaven so unmistakably that, in order to
blunder into the common mistranslation of it, it was first necessary to
invent, and get the lexicographers to adopt, a span-new special meaning
for the words ἀμφὶς ἔχειν—a meaning necessitated by no other passage in
the whole body of Homeric Greek. Homer's beautifully explicit language
is,—

<div style="margin-left: 32px">

                      ἔχει δέ τε κίονας αὐτὸς  
μακράς αἳ γαῖάν τε καὶ οὐρανὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχουσιν.

</div>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "Who, of his own
right, possesses the tall Pillars *which have around them earth and
heaven*." <span id="fr_605"></span>[2](#fn_605.md) Nowhere in Homeric, if
indeed in any ancient Greek, does the expression mean "*to prop
asunder*." <span id="fr_606"></span>[3](#fn_606.md)

Finally, as to the supposed difficulty of imagining a heaven-upholder so
tall that it would take a brazen anvil nine days and nights to fall from
his head to his feet, if Professor Paley had remembered Sandalfon, the
Talmudic Atlas, he would hardly have

<span id="page_357">p. 357</span>

thought it necessary to locate the Hesiodic one on the edge of the earth
where the sky is low. Of Sandalfon, Rabbi Eliezer has said, "There is an
angel who standeth on earth, and reacheth with his head to the door of
heaven. It is taught in the Mishna that he is called Sandalfon; he
exceedeth his companions as much in height as one can walk in five
hundred years, and that he stands behind the chariot \[Charles's Wain\]
and twisteth or bindeth the garlands for his Creator." <span
id="fr_607"></span>[1](#fn_607.md)

Atlas's Pillar, then, is the axis of the world. It is the same Pillar
apostrophized in the Egyptian document known as the great Harris Magic
Papyrus, in these unmistakable words: "O long Column, which commences in
the upper and in the lower heavens!" <span
id="fr_608"></span>[2](#fn_608.md) It is, with scarce a doubt, what the
same ancient people in their Book of the Dead so happily styled "the
Spine of the Earth." <span id="fr_609"></span>[3](#fn_609.md) It is the
Rig-Veda's *vieltragende Achse des unaufhaltsam sich drehenden, nie
alternden, nie morschwerdenden, durch den Lauf der Zeiten nicht
abgenutzten Weltrads, auf welchem* <span class="smallcaps">alle Wesen
stehen</span>. <span id="fr_610"></span>[4](#fn_610.md) It is the
Umbrella-staff of Burmese cosmology, the Churning-stick of India's gods
and demons. It is the Trunk of every cosmical Tree. <span
id="fr_611"></span>[5](#fn_611.md) It is the shadowless Lance of Alexander;

<span id="page_358">p. 358</span>

the tortoise-piercing (earth-piercing) Arrow of the Mongolian
heaven-god; the Spear of Izanagi; the Hacha de Cobre on which the
heavens of the Miztecs rested. <span id="fr_612"></span>[1](#fn_612.md) It
is the Cord which the ancient Vedic bard saw stretched from one side of
the universe to the other. <span id="fr_613"></span>[2](#fn_613.md) Is it
not the Psalmist's "Line" of the heavens which "is gone out through" the
very "earth" and on "to the end of the world"? It is the Irminsul of the
Germans, as expressly recognized by Grimm. It is the Tower of Kronos. It
is Plato's Spindle of Necessity. It is the Azacol of the North African
Sunis. It is the Ladder with seven lamps in the rites of Mithra. It is
the Talmudic Pillar which connects the Paradise celestial and the
Paradise terrestrial.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In the foregoing discussions of Homeric cosmology we have had a
sufficient exhibition of the cause and cure of current—malpractice shall
we call it?—on the part of interpreters of Homeric poetry. Their
baseless assumptions and blunders have been renewed and multiplied in
nearly every field of archæology,—Assyrian, Egyptian, Hebrew, Persian,
Indian. Whithersoever "modern research" has gone it has carried with it,
as a kind of first principle and rule of interpretation, the assumption
that the early nations cannot possibly have known anything about the
world, beyond what undeveloped tribes and peoples

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

would of necessity observe within their own contracted boundaries. The
inconsistencies of ignorance and of half-knowledge and of an
undisciplined, "child-like" imagination are therefore to be expected at
every step. Even the squarest contradictions must not surprise. Indeed,
in respect to Homer, the learned Sengebusch has actually formulated the
universal proposition that the results of investigations in different
departments of Homeric study "will *always* be found to contradict each
other." <span id="fr_614"></span>[1](#fn_614.md) In view of the accepted
modern results of investigation into Homer's cosmology one is tempted to
justify the proposition, only qualifying it in a mild degree, as
follows: The results of all Homeric investigations based upon the
assumption that Homer was too "primitive" a man to know where the sun
sets will always be found self-contradictory.

Against all such barbarizing misinterpretation of ancient literature it
is high time that a protest should be heard. Long enough has the beauty
and the breadth of ancient thought, in poetry and myth and even in
word-building, been obscured and hidden by this conceited assumption of
the modern teacher. It was bad enough when the old grammarians, assuming
that Homer could have had no idea of other than the nearest waters,
mutilated the grand proportions of the Odyssey to fit the voyagings of
its hero into the western basin of the Mediterranean, or, worse yet,
into the Euxine. <span id="fr_615"></span>[2](#fn_615.md) But this, after
all, was an altogether pardonable offense

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

compared with the currently accepted procedure of scholars, who, brought
up apparently on magazines of popular science, and imagining that
Columbus was the first man to whom the idea ever occurred that the earth
is round, approach the study of antiquity merely as the study of an
older department of barbarian folk-lore. Surely it is time to
investigate the great creations of ancient mind in a different
spirit. <span id="fr_616"></span>[1](#fn_616.md) It is nothing short of
deplorable to consider the mass of senseless argument and false
explanation annually crowded into the memories of successive classes of
academic and collegiate youth,—arguments and explanations which neither
to teacher nor taught have even the poor merit of intelligently
illustrating the evils of wrong principles of classical hermeneutics.
The discussions and results of the present treatise have at least
disclosed a conceivable beginning of human history, according to which
the early generations of men can hardly have failed to acquire that
knowledge of the mechanism of the heavens which all the oldest
traditions of the race ascribe to them. <span
id="fr_617"></span>[2](#fn_617.md) And if, in consequence of the

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

acceptance or even the discussion of the proffered results, the eyes of
scholars shall at last once more be directed to the study of the great
literary and other art-works of ancient mind in a new and more modest
spirit, the gains which are sure to accrue therefrom will be neither few
nor small.

Professor Blackie's reasoning is entirely subjective: "In a spiritual
religion, like Christianity, the word heaven will always be kept as
vague as possible; in an imaginative and sensuous religion, like the
Greek, it must be localized. A Zeus with human shape and members must
sit on a terrestrial seat; and the only seat proper for him is the
highest mountain in the country to which he belongs. Now, as the
original seat of the Greeks, when they rested from their long journey by
the Caspian and Euxine westward, was the plains of Macedonia and
Thessaly, the necessary locality for the throne of the Supreme God and
the council of the Immortals was Olympos, the extreme east end of the
long Cambunian range separating Thessaly from Macedonia, to the north of
the Peneios and the defile of Tempe." *Homer and the Iliad*. Edinburgh,
1866: vol. iv., p. 174.

<span id="fn_567"></span>[341:1](pf34.htm#fr_567.md) Heyschius professed to
have knowledge of fourteen mountains bearing the name of Olympos.

<span id="fn_568"></span>[341:2](pf34.htm#fr_568.md) To all who deny that
heaven was to Homer the abode of the gods this passage presents
insurmountable difficulties. To place Ossa upon Olympos, then upon Ossa
Pelion, in order, by means of the three, to climb up into an abode
situated on the top of the undermost of the three, is the problem! No
wonder that Völcker thinks Homer has been overpraised for his knowledge
of localities and of the arrangement of mountains: "Der Olymp muss auf
jeden Fall zu unterst kommen, und die Folgerung aus dieser Stelle für
die Homerische Localkenntniss und Grundlage der Wirklichkeit in
Anordnung der Berge müssen wir dahin gestellt sein lassen." *Hom.
Geog.*, p. 9. Truly amusing is the haughty remark under which Hartung
beats a retreat: "Warum aber sollte ein Gelehrter über solche
Wiedersprüche sich Scrupel machen da die religiöse Vorstellung sich
niemals daran gestossen hat?" *Die Religion und Mythologie der
Griechen*, Th. iii., 6. But one German, and he a Swiss, seems to have
apprehended the inevitable implication of this passage: "Jedoch war dem
Griechen wohl bewusst, dass die Götter nicht eigentlich und wirklich auf
dem Olymp wohnten, wie aus der Beschreibung des Kampfes des Otus und
Ephialtes gegen die olympischen Götter hervorgeht." Rinck, *Die Religion
der Hellenen*. Zurich, 1853: vol. i., p. 207.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> A similar
identification occurs in Hesiod, *Theogony*, v. 689. See L. Preller,
"Daher der Himmel and der Olymp auch ganz gleichbedeutend gebraucht
werden können." *Griechische Mythologie*. Leipsic, 1854: vol. i., p. 48.

<span id="fn_573"></span>[342:4](pf34.htm#fr_573.md) Lines 37, 51, 408. The
interpreters of Hesiod have found this so great a *crux* that Göttling
and Paley make it a ground for questioning the genuineness or antiquity
of the passages. See also Schoemann, *Die hesiodische Theogonie
ausgelegt and beurtheilt*. Berlin, 1868: p. 303. Yet Pfau, in Pauly's
*Real-Encyclopaedie*, Art. "Olympos," affirms that we find in Hesiod
"exactly the same conceptions of Olympos" as in Homer.

<span id="fn_574"></span>[343:1](pf34.htm#fr_574.md) Similar cases occur;
*Iliad*, i. 195, 208, compared with 221; v. 868 with 869; xix. 351 with
355; xx. 5 with so; *Od*., xi. 313 with 316; xx. 31 with 55; also 103
with 113. It is astonishing that Faesi can say that the case in the text
is the only one found in the Iliad. *Odysee*, *Einleitung*, p. xvii.

<span id="fn_575"></span>[344:1](pf34.htm#fr_575.md) "Heavenly threshold"
is Buckley's rendering of this term, though he elsewhere distinguishes
Olympos from heaven, as in note on book xvi. 364. In ancient cosmology
the "door of heaven" was situated at the North Pole of the sky.

East*, vol. i., Pt. I., pp. 36, 37. For the rabbinical usage see
Eisenmenger, *Entdecktes Judenthum*, Bd. ii., p. 402.

<span id="fn_576"></span>[344:2](pf34.htm#fr_576.md) Thus Völcker, after
reminding the reader that "there can be no doubt that the gods are here
represented as on Olympos, and not where Hera hung ἐν αἰθέρι καὶ
νεφίλῃσιν," exclaims very naturally, "Where now is the end of the rope
made fast?" He immediately adds as his answer, "Ohne Zweifel περὶ ῥίον
Οὐλύμποιο!—Without doubt around the peak of Olympos!" No wonder he
places an exclamation point after such a masterpiece of interpretation.
Possibly the French savant, M. Boivin, who to explain *Od*., vi. 40 ff.,
contended that Homer conceived of Olympos as an *inverted* mountain,
having its snowy top near the earth and its snowless and rainless roots
in heaven, caught his idea from Völcker's exegesis of this passage!

<span id="fn_579"></span>[345:3](pf34.htm#fr_579.md) Here is the Underworld

which Hephaistos was hurled down to earth. Compare also Hesiod's
description.

<span id="fn_580"></span>[346:1](pf34.htm#fr_580.md) The heroic manner in
which Professor Geddes accepts this grave alternative and shifts his own
embarrassment to the shoulders of the poet is somewhat discouraging to
interpreters who have an inclination to find a rational meaning in their
author. He says, "The manner in which this ῥίον Οὐλύμποιο is referred to
in a concrete form shows that it was not only a visible but \[also a\]
commanding object in the poet's landscape; so much so that it
*embarrasses his physical speculations and conceptions of the Cosmos*
\[*sic*\], since it is made the pinnacle on which the world of sea and
land is to be suspended by the golden chain. The ῥίον here, however,
*must be a part of the veritable mountain, not any idealized Olympos*."
(!) Wm. D. Geddes, LL. D., *The Problem of the Homeric Poems*. London,
1878: p. 257. This is as bad as the exclamatory arbitrariness of
Völcker, on the same passage, *Geog*., § 11.

<span id="fn_582"></span>[347:2](pf34.htm#fr_582.md) Book vi. 40. On p. 65
of his *Mythology*, Keightley quotes this passage as apparently somewhat
inconsistent with his view, but nevertheless renews his assertion that
"the Greeks of the early ages regarded the lofty Thessalian mountain
named Olympos as the dwelling of their gods." Compare Völcker: "In

<span id="fn_587"></span>[348:4](pf34.htm#fr_587.md) *Op. cit.*, §§ 155,
156, pp. 260-263. Professor Geddes’ elaborate argument to prove that
"the Olympos of the Achilleid" is "a veritable mountain, and that in
Thessaly" is entirely inconclusive. The use of ἀγάννιοφος no more
necessitates a literal interpretation than does a poet's application of
the term "snowy" to a living bosom, or "fleecy" to the clouds. So
πολύπτυχος proves nothing at all to his purpose, since Euripides—never
having read the Professor's instructive statement, "The epithet
πολύπτυχος, *applicable only to mountains*, is a sufficient barrier to
prevent the identification with οὐρανός "—applies it again and again to
many-strata-ed Ouranos. Even the Professor's one only evidence not by
his own concession merely "presumptive," to wit, the "great simile" of
the *Iliad*, book xvi. 364, tells against rather than for him, for the
ἀπ᾽ Οὐλύμπου νέφος cannot possibly come αἰθέρος ἐκ δίης into the
atmospheric οὐρανὸν where clouds move, unless Olympos be where the
divine ether is, high above the atmospheric heavens. Völcker's treatment
of the passage is so absurd that Geddes does not even attempt to follow
it. *Hom. Geog.*, § 13.

<span id="fn_588"></span>[349:1](pf34.htm#fr_588.md) The house of
Hephaistos in Olympos is plainly styled "starry." *Iliad*, xviii. 370,
comp. with 146, 148. Moreover, Aristotle, or whoever wrote the "Letter
of Aristotle to Alexander on the System of the World," in one passage
expressly identifies *Ouranos* and *Olympos*, saying that for diverse
etymological reasons we call the outermost circumference of heaven by
both names. See Flammarion, *Astronomical Myths, or History of the
Heavens*, p. 156. Even Völcker, in first laying down the thesis which
has so misled all his successors ("dass Uranus and Olympus nie als
synonym bei Homer gebraucht werden"), frankly confesses that this is
"gegen die bisher allgemein gehegte Meinung;" that is, "contrary to the
opinion hitherto generally held." *Homerische Geog.*, p. 4. With gods of
Homeric size, a single one of whom required *seven acres* for his couch,
the idea of placing the whole Olympian Court and *Götterleben* on the
sharp, narrow, clearly visible peak in Thessaly is ridiculous.

<span id="fn_589"></span>[349:2](pf34.htm#fr_589.md) Buchholz (*Hom.
Realien*, Bd. i. 1, p. 3) declares the metaphorical interpretation "*zu
gekünstelt*," for those early times, and roundly asserts that,
"according to the idea of the Homeric Greek, heaven is *eine metallene
Hohlkugel*." He should have added that to the same infantile mind
Aphrodité was a solid gold image (*Odyssey*, viii. 337), and the voice
of Achilles (*Iliad*, xviii. 222) a brass projectile.

<span id="fn_590"></span>[350:1](pf34.htm#fr_590.md) See Homer's own
τρίπτυχος, *Il*., xi. 353, in just this sense. Compare the marvelous
description in Plato's *Republic*, 616. Depuis had caught the right idea
when he penned the words, "*l’Olympe, composé de plusieurs couches
sphériques*." *Origine de Tous les Cults*, tom. i., p. 273. So a
recognition of the fact that the nine subterranean, or south polar,
Mictlans, or abodes of the dead, of the Aztecs were simply the
counterparts of their nine celestial, or north polar, Tlalocans, or
heavens, instantaneously clears up the long-standing difficulties of the
interpreters of that mythology. See Bancroft, *Native Races*, vol. iii.,
pp. 532-537.

Moreover, how could one limited being have charge of so many and so
widely separated pillars? "It can scarcely be doubted that the words
ἀμφὶς ἔχουσιν, *Odyssey*, i. 54, do not mean that these columns surround
the earth, for in this case they must be not only many in number, but it
would be obvious to the men of a myth-making and myth-speaking age that
a being stationed in one spot could not keep up, or hold, or guard, a
number of pillars surrounding either a square or a circular earth." Cox,

unsupported space; Savitri, the son of the waters, knows the place where
the ocean supported issued forth." Muir, *Sanskrit Texts*, vol. iv., p.
110 (comp. Ludwig's German version). According to this, he would be
conceived of as knowing the depths of the whole ocean, because its
celestial springs are about his head, and its lowest depths at his
feet.—Since the foregoing was first printed the author has met with the
remarkable diagram, published four hundred years ago in the *Magarita
Philosophica*, in which Atlas is represented as a venerable man, with

they had discovered; which they could not have done if they had not
lived 600 years, because it is only after the lapse of 600 years that
the *great year* is accomplished.'

"Now, what is this great year or cycle of 600 years? M. Cassini, <span
id="page_361">p. 361</span> the director of the Observatory of Paris,
has discussed it astronomically. He considers it as a testimony of the
high antiquity of their astronomy. 'This period,' he says, is one of the
most remarkable that have been discovered; for if we take the lunar
month to be 29 days, 12 h. 44 m. 3., we find that 219,146½ days make
7,421 lunar months, and that this number of days gives 600 solar years
of 365 days, 5 h. 51 m. 36 s.' If this year was in use before the
Deluge, it appears very probable, it must be confessed, that the
patriarchs were already acquainted to a considerable degree of accuracy
with the motions of the stars, for this lunar month agrees to a second,
almost, with that which has been determined by modern
astronomers."—Flammarion, *Astronomical Myths*. Paris, p. 26.
