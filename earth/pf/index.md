The location of the Garden of Eden should be one of those unanswerable
questions, such as 'what song did the sirens sing?' This has not stopped
speculation on the topic. Some of these works treat Eden as a metaphor
for the human body, such as [this text](../../wmn/tge/index.md). Others
were much more literal. William Warren wrote this 500 page tome to
propose a polar Eden, in some primeval ice-free epoch. He systematically
employs data from contemporary geology, ethnology, zoology, botany and
paleontology to bolster this argument.

In the 19th century, polar explorers had yet to fill in the blanks on
the maps at the poles, and geologists had yet to discover plate
tectonics, or create detailed maps of paleogeography. We now know that
the last time that the poles were ice-free was long before humans walked
the earth. In addition, there is no northern polar continent, and
probably never has been. However, recently one author (Out of
Antarctica, Robert Argod, ISBN
[1902699459](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1902699459/internetsacredte).md)
has proposed that humans originated in Antarctica, and migrated *north*.
He uses much the same collection of data as Warren, although he leans
very heavily on a hypothetical pole shift, which Warren did not.

The argument of this book is obviously moot, and much of the hard
scientific data is either misinterpreted or obsolete. However, Warren's
review of the literature of the folklore of the world-mountain, the tree
of life, and the earthly paradise is of continuing value, and worth
reading if you have any interest in the mysteries of our past.
