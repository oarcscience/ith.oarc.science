### CHAPTER V.

#### THE TESTIMONY OF PALEONTOLOGICAL BOTANY.

<span class="small">*Damals, von dort aus—d. h. aus diesem Bildungsherd
für die Pflanzen südlicher Breiten im hohen Norden—hat eine
strahlenförmige Verbreitung von Typen stattgehabt*.—<span
class="smallcaps">Professor Heer</span>.</span>

<span class="small">*It is now an established conclusion that the great
aggressive faunas and floras of the continents have originated in the
North, some of them within the Arctic Circle*.—<span
class="smallcaps">Principal Dawson</span> (1883).</span>

<span class="smallcaps">All</span> traditions of the primeval Paradise
require us to conceive of it as possessed of a tropical flora of the
most beautiful and luxuriant sort,—as adorned with "every tree that is
pleasant to the sight, or good for food." Any theory, therefore, as to
the site of Eden must of necessity present a locality where this
condition could have been met. How is it with the hypothesis now under
consideration?

To reply that a polar Eden is scientifically admissible in this respect
would be to state but a small part of the truth. So much might
unhesitatingly be affirmed in view of the facts presented in the last
chapter. Given in any country on the face of the globe a long-continued
tropical climate, and a tropical vegetation may well be expected.
Anything else would be so abnormal as to require explanation.

But the study of Paleontological Botany has just conducted to a new and
entirely unanticipated result. The best authorities in this science,
both in Europe and America, have lately reached the conclusion that *all
the floral types and forms revealed in the* 

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

*oldest fossils of the earth originated in the region of the North Pole,
and thence spread first over the northern and then over the southern
hemisphere, proceeding from North to South*. This is a conception of the
origin and development of the vegetable world which but a few years ago
no scientific man had dreamed of, and which, to many intelligent readers
of these pages, will be entirely new. Its profound interest, as related
to the present discussion, will at once be seen.

Without attempting a chronological history of this remarkable discovery,
or in any wise assuming to assign to each pioneer student his share of
the credit, we may say that Professor Asa Gray, of America, Professor
Oswald Heer, of Switzerland, Sir Joseph Hooker, of England, Otto Kuntze,
of Germany, and Count G. de Saporta, of France, have all been more or
less prominently associated with the establishment of the new doctrine.
Sir Joseph Hooker's studies of the floral types of Tasmania furnished
data, before lacking, for a general trans-latitudinal survey of the
whole field. He was struck by the fact that in that far-off Southern
world "the Scandinavian type asserts his prerogative of ubiquity."
Though at that time he seems not to have divined its significance, he
clearly saw the paleontological and other vestiges of the great movement
by which the far North has slowly clothed the north-temperate, the
equatorial, and the southern regions with verdure. In one passage he
describes the impression made upon him by the facts in the following
graphic language: "When I take a comprehensive view of the vegetation of
the Old World, I am struck with the appearance it presents of there
having been a

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

continuous current of vegetation, if I may so fancifully express myself,
from Scandinavia to Tasmania." <span id="fr_95"></span>[1](#fn_95.md)

Light on this problem of the far South was soon to come from the far
North. In 1868 Professor Oswald Heer, of Zurich, published his truly
epoch-making work on the fossil flora of the Arctic regions, in which he
modestly yet with much confidence advanced the idea that the
*Bildungsherd*, or mother-region, of all the floral types of the more
southern latitudes was originally in "a great continuous Miocene
continent within the Arctic Circle," and that from this centre the
southward spread or dispersion of these types had been in a radial or
out-raying manner. <span id="fr_96"></span>[2](#fn_96.md) His demonstration
of the existence in Miocene times of a warm climate and of a rich
tropical vegetation in the highest attainable Arctic latitudes was
complete and overwhelming. Our latest geologists are still accustomed to
speak of his result as "one of the most remarkable geological
discoveries of modern times." <span id="fr_97"></span>[3](#fn_97.md) His
theory of a primeval circumpolar mother-region whence all floral types
proceeded is also at present so little questioned that to-day among
representative scholars in this field the absorbing and only question
seems to be, Who first proposed and to whom belongs the chief honor of
the verification of so broad and beautiful a generalization? <span
id="fr_98"></span>[4](#fn_98.md)

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

Here, then, is a new and wonderful light just thrown upon the problem of
the site of Eden. Theology in some of its representatives had
anticipated the geologists in teaching that the earth's vestment of
vegetation originally proceeded from one primeval centre, but it is the
glory of paleontology to have located that centre and to have given us
an evidence scientifically valid. Wherever man originated, the biologist
and botanist now know where was the cradle of some of the world's
tenants. Whatever the direction of the first human migrations, we are
now clear as to the direction of that "great invasion of

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Arctic plants and
animals which in the beginning of Quaternary ages came southward into
Europe." <span id="fr_99"></span>[1](#fn_99.md)

But it may be that the testimony of Paleontological Botany is not yet
exhausted. What if it should at length appear that along with the plants
prehistoric men—and civilized men at that—must have descended from the
mother-region of plants to the place where history finds them? Without
any reference to or apparent recognition of the great anthropological
interest of such a question, at least one botanist of Germany, reasoning
from botanical facts and postulates alone, has reached precisely this
conclusion.

This *savant* is Professor Otto- Kuntze, who has made special studies of
the cultivated tropical plants. What other botanists had found true of
the wild flora in continents separated by wide oceans he finds true of
domesticated plants. But the problem of the spread of these plants from
continent to continent

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

raises peculiar and most interesting questions. Taking the
banana-plantain, which was cultivated in America before the arrival of
Europeans in 1492, Professor Kuntze asks, "In what way was this plant,
which cannot stand a voyage through the temperate zone, carried to
America?" The difficulty is that the banana is seedless, and can be
propagated in a new country only by carrying thither a living root and
planting it in a suitable soil. Its very needlessness is evidence of the
enormous length of time that it has been cared for by man. As the
Professor says, "A cultivated plant which does not possess seeds must
have been under culture for a very long period,—we have not in Europe a
single exclusively seedless, berry-bearing cultivated plant,—and hence
it is perhaps fair to infer that these plants were cultivated as early
as the middle of the diluvial period." But now as to its transportation
from the Old World to the New, or *vice versa*. "It must be remembered,"
he says, "that the plantain is a tree-like, herbaceous plant, possessing
no easily transportable bulbs, like the potato or the dahlia, nor
propagable by cuttings, like the willow or the poplar. It has only a
perennial root, which, once planted, needs hardly any care." After
discussing the subject in all aspects, he reaches the twofold
conclusion, first, that civilized man must have brought the roots of the
plant into any new regions into which it has ever come; and secondly,
that its appearance in America can only be accounted for on the
supposition that it was carried thither by way of the north-polar
countries at a time when a tropical climate prevailed at the North
Pole. <span id="fr_100"></span>[1](#fn_100.md)

ago, in a paper on "The Botany of Japan" <span id="page_90">p. 90</span>
(*Memoirs of the American Academy of Science*, 1857, vol. vi., pp.
377458), Professor Asa Gray suggested the possibility of the common
origination in high northern latitudes of various related species now
widely separated in different portions of the north-temperate zone. In
1872, four years after the publication of Heer's work, in treating of
"The Sequoia and its History," in an address (see *Journal of the Am.
Ass. for the Advancement of Science*, 1872), he renewed in a clearer and
stronger manner his advocacy of the idea. In the same year, and also in
1876, Count Saporta, with due acknowledgment of the work of Professor
Heer, gave currency to the theory in the scientific circles of France.
Alluding to this, the Count has recently written, "Asa Gray was not the
only botanist who had the idea of explaining the presence of disjoined
species and genera dispersed across the boreal temperate zone and the
two continents, by means of emigrations from the pole as the
mother-region whence these vegetable races had radiated in one or
several directions. This had been *parallèlement* conceived and
developed in France upon the occasion of the remarkable works of
Professor O. Heer." *Am. Journal of Science*, May, 1883, p. 394. The
annotation appended to this by Professor Gray may be seen on the same
page. For a German acknowledgment see Engler, *Entwickelungsgeschichte
der Pflanzenwelt*, Th. i., S. 23; for an English, see *Nature*, London,
1881, P. 446; for an American, J. W. Dawson, "The Genesis and Migration
of Plants," in *The Princeton Review*, 1879, p. 277. But Dr. Dawson,
referring to Saporta's *Ancienne Végétation Polaire*, Hooker's
*Presidential Address* of 1878, Thistleton Dyer's *Lecture on Plant
Distribution*, and J. Starkie Gardner's *Letters* in *Nature*, 1878,
well remarks that "the basis of most of these brochures is to be found
in Heer's *Flora Fossilis Arctica*."

<span id="fn_99"></span>[91:1](pf13.htm#fr_99.md) Geikie, *Textbook of
Geology*, p. 874. Compare Wallace: "We have now only to notice the
singular want of reciprocity in the migrations of northern and southern
types of vegetation. In return for the vast number of European plants
which have reached Australia, not one single Australian plant has
entered any part of the north temperate zone, and the same may be said
of the typical southern vegetation in general, whether developed in the
Antarctic lands, New Zealand, South America, or South Africa."
*Island-Life*. London, 1880: p. 486. In like manner Sir Joseph Hooker
affirms: "Geographically speaking, there is no Antarctic flora except a
few lichens and sea-weeds." *Nature*, 1881: p. 447. Possibly, however,
the progress of research may bring to light evidences of a second and
less powerful polar *Bildungsherd* of primitive flora forms in the
Antarctic region. Some of the discoveries of F. P. Moreno look in that
direction. See "*Patagonia, resto de un antiguo continente hoy
sumerjido*." *Anales de la societad cientifica Argentina*. T. xiv.,
