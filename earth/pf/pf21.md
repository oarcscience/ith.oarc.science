### CHAPTER V.

#### THE CRADLE OF THE RACE IN IRANIAN, OR OLD-PERSIAN, THOUGHT.

<span class="small">*Aus den Angaben über die Paradiesströme und den
Lauf derselben erhellt nun auch, wo wir das Parades selbst zu suchen
haben, nämlich im äussersten Norden*.—<span class="smallcaps">Fr.
Spiegel</span>.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">According</span> to the sacred books of the
ancient Persians all the five-and-twenty races of men which people the
seven "keshvares" of the earth descended from one primitive pair, whose
names were Mâshyoi and Mâshya. The abode of this primitive pair was in
the keshvare Kvanîras, the central and the fairest of the seven. <span
id="fr_184"></span>[1](#fn_184.md) Let us see if we can determine its
location.

As a key to the old Iranian conception of the world let us investigate
the nature and location of the "Chinvat bridge." This, like the Bifröst
of the Northmen and the Al Sirat of Islam, is the bridge on which the
souls of the dead, the evil as well as the good, leave this world to
enter the unseen. <span id="fr_185"></span>[2](#fn_185.md) The
investigation is in itself and for its own sake full of interest, for no
writer on the ideas and faith of the

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Mazdaeans has ever
professed to be able to tell either the origin or true meaning of the
myth. Most interpreters have either carefully abstained from all
attempts at explanation, or have suggested that it probably refers to
the rainbow or to the Milky Way, or to both. <span
id="fr_186"></span>[1](#fn_186.md) To dispose of these suggestions, let us
raise a few questions:—

1\. Do we find in any part of the Avestan literature any evidence that
the Chinvat Bridge possessed a curvilinear form?

None.

2\. Straight, or curved as a whole, were its two ends conceived of as on
a common level?

No, for motion upon it in one direction is described as upward, and in
the opposite direction as downward.

3\. Where was the upper end?

In the heaven of Ahura Mazda, the Supreme God, to whose abode the bridge
conducts good souls.

4\. But where is this abode?

At the Northern Pole of the sky, as elsewhere shown.

5\. Where is the earthward end?

It rests upon "the Daitîk peak."

6\. Is this peak in Persia?

No; it is part of a sacred mountain in Aîrân-vej, the Eden of Iranian
tradition.

7\. And where is Aîrân-vej?

"In the middle of the world."

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

8\. In what keshvare?

In Kvanîras, the central of the seven divisions of the earth, and the
one in which men and the good religion were first created.

9\. And in what direction from Persia was Aîrân-vej supposed to lie?

Far to the North.

10\. What natural "centre of the earth" is situated in that direction?

The North Pole.

11\. What other evidence is there that the Daitîk peak is at the North
Pole?

The fact that the mountain of which this is simply "the peak of
judgment" is Harâ-berezaiti, around which the heavenly bodies revolve,
and which, as all allow, answers to the north polar Su-Meru of the
Hindus. <span id="fr_187"></span>[1](#fn_187.md)

12\. Then the Chinvat bridge extends from the North Pole of the heavens
to the North Pole of the earth: what is its shape?

It is "*beam-shaped*." To quote the sacred book: "That bridge is like a
beam, of many sides, of whose edges there are some which are broad, and
there are some which are thin and sharp; its broad sides are so large
that its width is twenty-seven reeds, and its sharp sides are so
contracted that in thinness it is just like the edge of a razor. And
when the souls of the righteous and wicked arrive, it turns to them that
side which is suitable to their necessities." <span
id="fr_188"></span>[2](#fn_188.md)

<span id="page_158">p. 158</span>

The Chinvat bridge, then, is simply the axis of the northern heavens,
the Pillar of Atlas, the Talmudic "Strength of the Hill of Sion," the
column which in the Chinese legend the emperor vainly sought to climb!
In solving this long-standing problem we have at the same time unlocked
the mystery which has hitherto attached to Bifröst and Al Sirat. <span
id="fr_189"></span>[1](#fn_189.md)

But in locating our bridge we have located the Persian Eden. And the
location is unquestionably at the North Pole. More than this, we have
made clear the fact that in the mythical or sacred geography of this
ancient people the world of living men was originally the northern
circumpolar hemisphere. The arrangement of the keshvares now becomes
entirely clear. <span id="fr_190"></span>[2](#fn_190.md) Like the divinely
beautiful Ilâvrita varsha of the Hindus, "illustrious Kvanîras" holds
the central position. In its centre, as in the centre

<span id="page_159">p. 159</span>

of Ilâvrita, is the holiest mount in the world. Directly over it is the
true heaven. In this central polar country North and South and East and
West would have no application; but speaking from their own geographical
standpoint as south of Aîrân-vej, the Persians located to the east of
this holy central Kvanîras the keshvare Savah, to the west Arzah, to the
south the keshvares Fradadafsh and Vidadafsh, and to the north Vôrûbarst
and Vôrûgarst. <span id="fr_191"></span>[1](#fn_191.md) This gives a map of
the northern hemisphere which in a

Persians.](tn/15900.jpg)

The Earth of the Persians.  
</span>

<span id="page_160">p. 160</span>

plane polocentric projection may be represented as on the foregoing
page, the polar centre of course being occupied by Harâ-berezaiti.

It would be a fascinating task to reinterpret the whole Avestan
literature and mythology in the new light of this recovered geography
and cosmology, but this would require a book of itself. It is worthy of
remark that the Venidad expressly calls the earth "round," and
apparently recognizes the existence of its two far-separated
poles. <span id="fr_192"></span>[1](#fn_192.md) As we have seen, its
Chinvat bridge or beam, which is also an idea so ancient as to be found
in the Avesta itself (Farg., xix., 30, *et passim*), is the axis of the
world, conducting good souls by an upward "flight" into the north polar
heaven of Ahura Mazda, but the evil by a fall "headforemost" into the
south polar hell. <span id="fr_193"></span>[2](#fn_193.md) Aîrân-vej, or
"Old Iran," was the most natural name in the world for the Iranians to
give to the traditional birth-place of their race. <span
id="fr_194"></span>[3](#fn_194.md) But all attempts to find it "on the
banks of the Aras" or "in the far-off lands

<span id="page_161">p. 161</span>

of the rising sun" <span id="fr_195"></span>[1](#fn_195.md) are entirely
useless. Equally mistaken is the gloss which merely makes it
"primitively" the mythic land where the disembodied "souls of the
righteous" are assembled by Ahura Mazda. <span
id="fr_196"></span>[2](#fn_196.md) The same must be said of the assertion
that "the real site of the Aîrân-vej in its ancient and original
conception is to the east of the Caspian Sea and of Lake Aral." <span
id="fr_197"></span>[3](#fn_197.md) By every particular of its description
it is identified with the Daitîk peak, with Harâ-berezaiti, with the
polar "river," the polar "tree," the polar "centre" of the upper
hemisphere. It is simply the Arctic Eden of humanity remembered as it
was before the Evil One entered, and "by his witchcraft counter-created
winter and the worst of plagues." <span id="fr_198"></span>[4](#fn_198.md)
This being the case we need not wonder that in a paper on "The Aryan
Birth-place," read in January, 1884, before the Royal Society of
Literature, Mr. C. J. Stone expressed his strong doubt of the current
doctrine that the cradle of the Aryans was the upper valleys of the
Oxus. <span id="fr_199"></span>[5](#fn_199.md) The

<span id="page_162">p. 162</span>

cradle of the whole Aryan family will at last be found to be in "Aîrân,
the Ancient,"—and this in the Arctic birth-place of man.

Rawlinson, “is evidently the original of Mohammed's famous ‘way extended
over the middle of hell, which is sharper than a sword and finer than a
hair, over which all must pass.’” *Ancient Monarchies*, vol. ii., p. 339
n. Compare Sale's *Koran*, Prelim. Discourse, Sect. iv. Professor Tiele
thinks "it was borrowed from the old Aryan mythology," and that it "was
probably originally the rainbow." *History of Religion*. London and
Boston, 1877: p. 177.

ch. xxi., 2-9. West, *Pahlavi Texts*, ii., pp. 47-49. It is a curious
coincidence that in Polynesian mythology Buataranga, <span
id="page_158">p. 158</span> "guardian of the road to the invisible
world," is wife to Ru, "the supporter of the heavens." Gill, *Myths and
Songs of the South Pacific*. London, 1876: p. 51. So if Heimdallr's true
station were at the top of the rainbow, his title "son of nine mothers"
(Vigfusson and Powell, *Corpus Poeticum Boreale*, London, 1883, ii. 465)
would have no such obvious significance as our interpretation gives.

<span id="fn_189"></span>[158:1](pf21.htm#fr_189.md) One of the etymologies
of Chinvat makes it the "Bridge of the Judge." (Haug, *Essays*, 2d ed.,
p. 165 n.) As among the ancient Assyrians, and some other peoples, the
pole star has been styled "the judge of heaven," it is possible that we
have here at once the origin of the name and a new identification of the
position of the mythical "beam-shaped" bridge. It is interesting to note
in this connection that Heimdallr, the Norse god who stands at the top
of Bifröst, is also, etymologically considered, the "World-judge" or
"World-divider." Menzel, *Unsterblichkeitslehre*, i. 134. In Plato
(*Repub*., 614 ff.) the judge stands at the bottom of the column.—For
grotesque survivals of the Bridge of Souls in folklore, see Tylor,
*Primitive Culture*, Index.

<span id="fn_190"></span>[158:2](pf21.htm#fr_190.md) The diagram attempted
by Windischmann, *Zoroastrische Studien*, p. 67, is inconsistent with
the *Bundahish*, ch. v., 9. So must be every attempt to arrange the
keshvares on a flat earth.

<span id="fn_191"></span>[159:1](pf21.htm#fr_191.md) Darmesteter
transliterates the names as follows: "The earth is divided into seven
Karshvares, separated from one another by seas and mountains impassable
to men. Arezahi and Savahi are the western and eastern Karshvare;
Fradadhafshu and Vidadhafshu are in the south; Vouru*b*are*s*ti and
Vouru*g*ar*s*ti are in the north; *Hv*aniratha (Kvanîras) is the central
Karshvare. *Hv*aniratha is the only Karshvare inhabited by man
(*Bundahish*, xi. 3)."—Darmesteter, *The Zend-Avesta*, vol. ii., p. 123
n.

<span id="fn_192"></span>[160:1](pf21.htm#fr_192.md) *The Avesta*
(Darmesteter), i., p. 205; ii., pp. 143, 144. Compare Windischmann's
version of the Farvardin Yasht, i. 3: "die beiden Enden des Himmels."
*Studien*, p. 313.

<span id="fn_193"></span>[160:2](pf21.htm#fr_193.md) Apparently through the
passage forced through the earth by Aharman (Ahriman). See *Zâd Sparam*,
ch. ii., 3, 4, 5. West, *Pahlavi Texts*, vol. i., p. 161. Also
*Bundahish*, iii. 13. Rhode, *Die heilige Sage des Zendvolks*, p. 235.
Windischmann's translation of *Bundahish*, ch. xxxi. (in Darmesteter
numbered xxx.), seems especially to support this idea: "Ahriman und die
Schlange werden durch die Kraft der Lobgesänge geschlagen und hülflos
und schwach gemacht. Auf jener Brücke des Himmels, auf welcher er
herbeilief, wird er in die tiefste Finsterniss zurücklaufen. . . . Auch
dies ist gesagt: Diese Erde wird rein und eben sein: ausser dem Berg
Cakat-Cinvar wird ein Aufsteigen und ein Hinabtragen nicht sein."
*Zoroastrische Studien*, p. 117. Compare Plato's "chasms," with ways
leading hell. ward and heavenward. *Republic*, 614.

Contemporary Review*, Sept., 1881 (Am. ed.), p. 41.—Pietrement, *Les
Aryas*, locates it just east of Lake Balkach, in lat. 45°-47° Grill is
so bewildered by the number of attempted identifications that he
pronounces the land a purely mythical one, and denies to the name all
historic or geographic reality. *Erzväter*, i. 218, 219.

<span id="fn_198"></span>[161:4](pf21.htm#fr_198.md) *Fargard*, i. 3. The
passage continues, "There are (now) ten winter months there, two summer
months; and those are cold for the waters, cold for the earth, and cold
for the trees." This reminiscence of the on-coming of the Glacial Age at
the Pole also appears in the Flood legend of the American aborigines,
particularly the Lenni-Lenapi, or Delaware Indians. Rafinesque, *The
American Nations*. Phila., 1836: Song III.

Schrader, *Sprachvergleichung and Urgeschichte. Linguistisch-historische
Beiträge zur Erforschung des indogermanischen Alterthums*. Jena, 1883.
Dr. S. formerly adhered to the <span id="page_162">p. 162</span> theory
of a Mid-Asian Aryan birth-land, but has been led to abandon it. Still
more positive and emphatic is Karl Penka, who boldly locates the
original home of the Aryans in Scandinavia. See his *Origins Ariacæ.
Linguistisch-ethnologische Untersuchungen zur ältesten Geschichte der
Arischen Völker und Sprachen*. Vienna, 1883. Mr. John Gibb argues in the
same direction, "The Original Home of the Aryans," in *The British
Quart. Review*, Oct., 1884.
