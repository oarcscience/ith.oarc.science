### CHAPTER IV.

#### THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH. <span id="fr_327"></span>[1](#fn_327.md)

<span class="small">*He is the god who sits in the centre, on the Navel
of the Earth; and he is the interpreter of religion to all
mankind*.—<span class="smallcaps">Plato</span>.</span>

<span class="small">*But at the Navel of the Earth stands Agni, clothed
in richest apparel*.—Rig Veda.</span>

<span class="small">*To whom then will ye liken God? It is* <span
class="smallcaps">He</span> *that sitteth upon the* <span
class="smallcaps">Chug</span> *of the Earth, and the inhabitants thereof
are as grasshoppers*.—<span class="smallcaps">Isaiah</span>.</span>

<span class="small">*After proceeding some distance we paused to take
breath where the crowd was more dense and obstinate than usual: and I
was seriously informed that this was the exact Navel of the Earth, and
that these obstinate pilgrims were bowing and kissing it*.—The Land and
the Book.</span>

<span class="small">*Jedes Volk hat einen Nabel der Erde*.—<span
class="smallcaps">Kleuker</span>.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Students</span> of antiquity must often have
marveled that in nearly every ancient literature they should encounter
the strange expression "the Navel of the Earth." Still more
unaccountable would it have seemed to them had they noticed how many
ancient mythologies connect the cradle of the human race with this
earth-navel. The advocates of the different sites which have been
assigned to Eden have seldom, if ever, recognized the fact that no
hypothesis on this subject can be considered acceptable which cannot
account for this peculiar association of man's first home with some sort
of natural centre of the earth. Assuming, however, that the human race
began its history at the Pole, and that

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

all traditional recollections of man's unfallen state were connected
with a polar Eden, the mystery which otherwise envelops the subject
immediately vanishes.

We have already seen that the term "navel" was anciently used in many
languages for "centre," and that the Pole, or central point of the
revolving constellations, was the "Navel of Heaven." But as to the
celestial Pole there corresponds a terrestrial one, so it is only
natural that to the term the "Navel of Heaven" there should be the
corresponding expression the "Navel of the Earth."

Beginning with Christian traditions, let us make a pilgrimage to the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. There, in the portion
belonging to the Greek Christians, we shall discover a round pillar,
some two feet high, projecting from the marble pavement, but supporting
nothing. If we inquire as to its purpose, we shall be informed that it
is designed to mark the exact centre or "Navel" of the Earth? <span
id="fr_328"></span>[1](#fn_328.md) Early pilgrims and chroniclers refer to
this

THE NAVEL OF THE EARTH  
</span>

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

curious monument, but its antiquity no one knows. <span
id="fr_329"></span>[1](#fn_329.md) As usually described, it is a monument
of the geographical ignorance of those who placed it there, a proof that
they supposed the edge of the "flat disk" of the earth to be everywhere
equidistant from this stone. In reality, it is a monument of primeval
astronomic and geographic science.

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

To find the true symbolical and commemorative character of this pillar,
we need to remind ourselves of a tendency ever present and active among
men. We have already alluded to the scores of "Calvaries" which have
been set apart in Roman Catholic lands, and hallowed as memorial mounts.
Up the side of each leads a *Via dolorosa*, with its different
"stations," each recalling to the mind, by sculptured reliefs or
otherwise, one of the immortal incidents of the Passion. On the summit
is the full crucifixion tableau,—the Saviour hanging aloft upon the
cross, between two crucified malefactors. The spear, the reed with the
sponge, the hammer,—all are there, sometimes the ladder also; and near
by, the tomb wherein never man was laid. In the minds of the worshipers
it is a holy place.

Even in our Protestant republic, on the shore of Lake Chautauqua, we
have seen successfully carried out, in our own day, a complete
reproduction of Palestine. Thousands have visited it to take
object-lessons in Sacred Geography. From it these thousands have gained
clearer ideas of the relative positions and bearings of Hermon and Tabor
and Olivet, of Kedron and Cherith and the Jordan, of Nazareth and Hebron
and the Holy City, than else they ever would have had. What here has
been done for purposes of instruction has elsewhere and often upon a
greater or smaller scale, been done for purposes of direct religious
edification, and for the gratification of religious sentiment.

Now, just as Christians love to localize in their

<span id="page_229">p. 229</span>

own midst their "Holy Places," so the early nations of the world loved
to create miniature reproductions of Eden, the fair and sacred country
in which man dwelt in the holy morning hours of his existence. <span
id="fr_330"></span>[1](#fn_330.md) The traditional temple architecture of
many early religions was determined by this symbolical and commemorative
motive. This was eminently true of the sacred architecture of the
Babylonians, Egyptians, Hebrews, and Chinese. <span
id="fr_331"></span>[2](#fn_331.md) Koeppen assures us that "every
orthodoxly constructed Buddhist temple either is, or contains, a
symbolical representation of the divine regions of Meru, and of the
heaven of the gods, saints, and Buddhas, rising above it." <span
id="fr_332"></span>[3](#fn_332.md) Lillie says, "The thirteen pyramidal
layers at the top of every temple in Nepâl represent the thirteen
unchangeable heavens of Amitâbha." <span id="fr_333"></span>[4](#fn_333.md)
With what

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

astonishing elaboration this idea has sometimes been carried out may be
seen in the Senbyoo temple in Mengoon, near the capital of Burmah. <span
id="fr_334"></span>[1](#fn_334.md) That the natural features of the
landscape were often utilized in producing these symbolic shrines and
holy places is only what we should expect. "The Buddhists of Ceylon," as
Obry states, "have endeavored to transform their central mountain,
*Dêva-Kuta* (Peak of the Gods), into Meru, and to find four streams
descending from its sides to correspond with the rivers of their
Paradise." <span id="fr_335"></span>[2](#fn_335.md)

Again, in the "rock-cut" temples of Ellora, we have, in like manner, a
complete representation of the Paradise of Siva. Faber develops the
evidence of this practice among the ancients with great fullness, and
with respect to the Hindus and Buddhists says, "Each pagoda, each
pyramid, each montiform 'high-place,' is invariably esteemed to be a
copy of the holy hill Meru," the Hindu's Paradise. <span
id="fr_336"></span>[3](#fn_336.md)

From "Records of the Past," vol. x., p. 50, we see that the Egyptians
had the same custom of building temples in such a manner that they
should be symbolical of the abode of the gods. So in Greece and

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Rome the citadel
mounts in their cities had quite as great religious as military
significance. Lenormant, speaking of Rome and Olympia, remarks, "It is
impossible not to note that the Capitoline was first of all the *Mount
of Saturn*, and that the Roman archæologists established a complete
affinity between the Capitoline and Mount Cronios in Olympia, from the
standpoint of their traditions and religious origin (Dionysius
Halicarn., i., 34). This Mount Cronios is, as it were, the *Omphalos* of
the sacred city of Elis, the primitive centre of its worship. It
sometimes receives the name Olympos." <span
id="fr_337"></span>[1](#fn_337.md) Here is not only symbolism in general,
but also a symbolism pointing to the Arctic Eden, already shown to be
the primeval mount of Kronos, the *Omphalos* of the whole earth. <span
id="fr_338"></span>[2](#fn_338.md)

Now, as Jerusalem is one of the most ancient of the sacred cities of the
world, and, at the same time, the one where the tradition of the
primeval Paradise was preserved in its clearest and most historic form,
it would be strange if, in all its long history, no king or priesthood
had ever tried to enhance its attractiveness and sanctity by making it,
or some part of it, symbolize Earth's earliest Holy Land, and
commemorate man's earliest Theocracy. That the attempt

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

was made is beyond a doubt. To this day the visitor is shown the spot
where, according to one tradition, Adam was created. <span
id="fr_339"></span>[1](#fn_339.md) Not many feet away, under the custody of
another religion, he finds the sacred rock-hewn grave in which at least
the head of the first of men was buried. <span
id="fr_340"></span>[2](#fn_340.md) In the little Gihon, the name of one of
the Paradise rivers still lives. The miraculous virtue of the Pool of
Bethsaida was ascribed in early Christian legend to its being in
subterranean contact with the Tree of Life, which grew in the midst of
Paradise. <span id="fr_341"></span>[3](#fn_341.md) Christ's cross was said
to have been made of the wood of the same tree. The very name, Mount
Sion, is a memorial one. The Talmudic account of "The Strength of the
Hill of Sion" shows that the Palestinian mount was named after the
heavenly one, and not *vice versa*, as commonly supposed. The true
sacred name of the Holy City is, therefore, not Sion (though it is often
called by the heavenly appellation also), but "Daughter of Sion." She is
simply

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

a copy, a miniature likeness, of the true mount and city of God "in the
sides of the North." <span id="fr_342"></span>[1](#fn_342.md)

So confident is Lenormant that Solomon and Hezekiah intentionally
conformed their capital to the Paradisaic mount, and intentionally
introduced in their public works features which should symbolize and
commemorate peculiarities of Eden, that he uses the fact as an
unanswerable argument against those imaginative critics who would place
the composition of the second chapter of Genesis subsequent to the
Babylonian exile. He says,—

"Another proof, and a very decisive one in my opinion, of the high
antiquity of the narrative of Genesis concerning Eden, and of the
knowledge of it possessed by the Hebrews long before the Captivity, is
the intention—so clearly proved by Ewald—to imitate 'the four rivers'
which predominated in the works of Solomon and Hezekiah for the
distribution of the waters of Jerusalem, which, in its turn, was
considered as the *Umbilicus* of the Earth (Ezek. v. 5), in the double
sense of centre of the inhabited regions and source of the rivers. The
four streams which watered the town and the foot of its ramparts—one of
which was named Gihon (1 Kings i. 33, 38; 2 Chron. xxxii. 30, xxxiii.
14), like one of the Paradisaic rivers—were, as Ewald has shown, reputed
to issue through subterranean communications from the spring of fresh
water situated beneath the Temple, the sacred source of life and purity
to which the prophets (Joel iii. 18; Ezek. xlvii. 1-12; Zech. xiii. 1,
xiv. 8; *cf*. Apoc. xxii. 1) attach a high symbolic value." <span
id="fr_343"></span>[2](#fn_343.md)

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

In this citation, in addition to a strong assertion of the symbolical
character of the topography and waterworks of Jerusalem, we have the
location itself included in this symbolism. The city is said to have
been the *Umbilicus* or Navel of the Earth, for, two reasons: first,
because of its relation to surrounding countries; <span
id="fr_344"></span>[1](#fn_344.md) and, second, because of its containing
the source of the rivers. In our next chapter, this last reason will
become more significant than even the writer intended. At present we
will only add that the true philosophy of this symbolical centrality of
Jerusalem is found in two facts: first, the Hebrews had a tradition that
*primeval Eden was the Centre of the Earth:* <span
id="fr_345"></span>[2](#fn_345.md) and, second, by styling Jerusalem the
Navel of the Earth, as they did, it was symbolically all the more
assimilated to the primitive Paradise which in so many other ways it
sacredly commemorated.

Passing to the field of Hellenic tradition, we are told by all modern
interpreters that the Greeks shared the "narrow conceit and ignorance of
all ancient nations," and supposed their own land to occupy the middle
of the "flat earth-disk." And because of certain expressions in Pindar
and a passage in Pausanias, it is affirmed as a first principle in the
geography of the ancient Greeks that Delphi was believed to be the exact
topographical centre-point of the whole earth.

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

Such a representation is far from satisfactory. For while the term
"*Omphalos* of the Earth" was undoubtedly applied in a sense to Delphi,
it belonged to it only as the name Athens belongs to many a town thus
designated in America. It had other and older topographical connections
and associations. We find traces of the same title in connection with
Olympos, with Ida, with Parnassos, with Ogygia, with Nyssa, with Mount
Meros, with Delos, with Athens, with Crete, and even with Meroë. In the
multiplicity of these localizations, the people seem to have lost the
clue to the original significance of the conception, and to have
contrived crude etymological myths of their own for the explanation of
what seemed to then a remarkable designation. <span
id="fr_346"></span>[1](#fn_346.md)

The moment we make the true original *Omphalos* of the Earth the North
Pole, and invest it with sacred traditionary recollections of Eden life,
all this confusion becomes clear. The "centre-stone" of Delphi, like the
Omphalium of the Cretans, becomes merely a memorial shrine, an attempted
copy of the great original. And if all the Olymps and Idas and Parnassos
mounts were alike convenient reproductions and localizations of the one
celestial mountain of the gods at the North Pole, what wonder if we find
each of them in some way designated as the Centre of the Earth.

Homer's "*Omphalos* of the sea," Calypso's isle,

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

has in like manner all the marks of a mythico-traditional north polar
Eden. Its name, Ogygia, connects it with a far-off antediluvian
antiquity. <span id="fr_347"></span>[1](#fn_347.md) It is situated in the
far North, and Odysseus needs the blast of Boreas to bring him away from
its shores on the homeward journey. Its queen, Calypso, is the daughter
of Atlas; and Atlas’ proper station in Greek mythology, as elsewhere
shown, is at the terrestrial Pole. Its beauty is Paradisaic, it being
adorned with groves and "soft meadows of violets,"—so beautiful, in
fact, that "on beholding it even an Immortal would be seized with wonder
and delight." <span id="fr_348"></span>[2](#fn_348.md) Finally, identifying
the place beyond all question, we have the Eden "fountain," whose waters
part into "four streams, flowing each in opposite directions." <span
id="fr_349"></span>[3](#fn_349.md)

In Mount Meros we have only the Greek form of Meru, as long ago shown by
Creuzer. <span id="fr_350"></span>[4](#fn_350.md) The one is the Navel of
the Earth for the same reason that the other is. Egyptian Meroë (in some
Egyptian texts *Mer*, in Assyrian *Mirukh*, or *Mirukha*), the seat of
the famous oracle of Jupiter Ammon, was possibly named from the same
"World-mountain." This would explain the passage in Quintus Curtius,
which has so troubled commentators, wherein the object which represented
the divine being is described as resembling a "navel set in gems." <span
id="fr_351"></span>[5](#fn_351.md)

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> When the two doves
of Zeus, flying from the two opposite ends of the world, determine the
cosmic centralness of "Parnassos," it is of an antediluvian Parnassos
that the myth is speaking. <span id="fr_352"></span>[1](#fn_352.md) It is
that mount on whose polar top we have already found the "*domicilium*"
of Zeus.

Nonnos, in describing the symbolical *peplos* which Harmonia wove on the
loom of Athene, says, "First she represented the earth with its
*omphalos* in the centre; around the earth she spread out the sphere of
heaven varied with the figures of the stars. . . . Lastly, along the
exterior edge of the well-woven vestment she represented the Ocean in a
circle." <span id="fr_353"></span>[2](#fn_353.md) That Delphi or the
Phocian Parnassos is the *omphalos* here mentioned is far enough from
credible. It is the Pole, and the manner in which the term is introduced
shows that it was perfectly understood by every reader, and needed no
explanation. The true shrine of Apollo was not at Delphi, but in that
older earth-centre of which Plato speaks in the motto prefixed to this
section. His real home is among "the Hyperboreans," in a land of almost
perpetual light; and it is only upon annual visits that he comes to
Delphi. <span id="fr_354"></span>[3](#fn_354.md) The remembrance of this
fact would have

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

helped the interpreters of Pindar out of more than one perplexity. <span
id="fr_355"></span>[1](#fn_355.md) According to Hecatæus, Lêtô, the mother
of Apollo and his sister Artemis, was born on an island in the Arctic
Ocean, "beyond the North wind." Moreover, on this island inhabited by
the Hyperboreans, Apollo is unceasingly worshiped in a huge round
temple, in a city whose inhabitants are perpetually playing upon lyres
and chanting to his praise. <span id="fr_356"></span>[2](#fn_356.md) So
reports Diodorus (ii., 47); and herewith agrees the imaginary journey of
Apollonius of Tyana,—a namesake of Apollo,—who tells of his journey far
to the North of the Caucasus into the regions of the pious Hyperboreans,
among whom he found a lofty sacred mountain, the *Omphalos* of the
Earth. <span id="fr_357"></span>[3](#fn_357.md)

In the Phædo we have a charming description of Plato's terrestrial
Paradise. "In this fair region,"

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Socrates is made
to say, "all things that grow—trees and flowers and fruit—are fairer
than any here; and there are hills and stones in them smoother and more
transparent and fairer in color than our highly-valued emeralds and
sardonyxes and jaspers and other gems, which are but minute fragments of
them: for there all the stones are like our precious stones, and fairer
still. The temperament of their seasons is such that the inhabitants
have no disease, and live much longer than we do, and have sight and
hearing and smell and all the other senses in much greater perfection.
And they have temples and sacred places in which the gods really dwell,
and they hear their voices, and receive their answers, and are conscious
of them, and hold converse with them, and they see the sun, the moon,
and the stars as they really are." <span id="fr_358"></span>[1](#fn_358.md)

If we ask as to the location of this divinely beautiful abode, every
indication of the text agrees with our hypothesis. It is right under the
eye when the world is looked at from its summit, the Northern celestial
pole. <span id="fr_359"></span>[2](#fn_359.md) Viewed from the standpoint
of Greece and its neighbor lands it is "*above*,"—it is "*the upper
Earth*," the dazzling top of the "*round*" world. In it, moreover, is
the Navel of the Earth, μεσογαία, inhabited by happy men.

If anything is needed to disprove the common notion that geographical
ignorance and national self-esteem first governed the ancient peoples in
locating in their own countries "navels" of the earth, it is furnished
by what is, in all probability, the oldest epic in the world, that of
Izdhubar, fragments of

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

which have survived in the oldest literature of Babylonia. These
fragments show that the earliest inhabitants of the Tigro-Euphrates
basin located "the Centre of the Earth," not in their own midst, but in
a far-off land, of sacred associations, where "the holy house of the
gods" is situated,—a land "into the heart whereof man hath not
penetrated;" a place underneath the "overshadowing world-tree," and
beside the "full waters." <span id="fr_360"></span>[1](#fn_360.md) No
description could more perfectly identify the spot with the Arctic Pole
of ancient Asiatic mythology. Yet this testimony stands not alone; for
in the fragment of another ancient text, translated by Sayce in
"*Records of the Past*," we are told of a "dwelling" which "the gods
created for "the first human beings,"—a dwelling in which they "became
great" and "increased in numbers," and the location of which is
described in words exactly corresponding to those of Iranian, Indian,
Chinese, Eddaic, and Aztec literature; namely, "in the Centre of the
Earth." <span id="fr_361"></span>[2](#fn_361.md)

In the Hindu Puranas we are told over and over that the earth is a
sphere, and that Mount Meru is its Navel or Pole. <span
id="fr_362"></span>[3](#fn_362.md) But the expression *nâbhi*, or "Navel"
of the earth, is older than the Puranas, though the very meaning of
Purana is "ancient." Like the term "Navel of Heaven," it occurs in the

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

hymns of the earliest Veda. But where was the sacred shrine to which it
was applied? It was no holy place in Bactria, or in the Punjâb. Nothing
tends to locate it in India. On the other hand, the fifth verse of the
one hundred and eighty-fifth hymn, mandala first, of the Rig Veda, seems
most plainly to fix it at the North Pole. In this verse Night and Day
are represented as twin sisters in the bosom of their parents Heaven and
Earth; each bounding or limiting the other, but both kissing
simultaneously the Nâbhi of the Earth. Now, everywhere upon earth,
except in the polar regions, Night and Day seem ever to be pursuing and
supplanting each other. They have no common ground. At the Pole—and only
there—they may be said, with locked arms, to spin round and round a
common point, and unitedly to kiss it from the opposite sides. <span
id="fr_363"></span>[1](#fn_363.md) This plainly is the meaning of the poet;
and remembering all the legendary splendors of the polar mountain around
which sun and moon are ever moving, we must pronounce the figure as
beautiful as it is instructive. <span id="fr_364"></span>[2](#fn_364.md)

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

In perfect accord herewith, we find the bard asking, in another hymn,
where the Navel of the Earth is; and in doing it he associates it as
closely as possible, not with some central home-shrine in his own land,
but with the extreme "*End of the Earth*,"—an expression used again and
again, in ancient languages, for the Pole and its vicinity. <span
id="fr_365"></span>[1](#fn_365.md)

Again, in another Vedic passage, the Navel of the Earth is located upon
"the mountains," and this association points us to the North. <span
id="fr_366"></span>[2](#fn_366.md) Still stronger evidence of its polar
location is found in other hymns, where the supporting column of
heaven—the Atlas pillar of Vedic cosmology—is described as standing in
or upon the Navel of the Earth. <span id="fr_367"></span>[3](#fn_367.md)

Finally, so unmistakable is the Vedic teaching on this subject that a
recent writer, after asserting with all his teachers that the
cosmography of the Vedic bards was "embryonic," and their earth a "flat
disk" overarched by a solid firmament, which was "soldered on to the
edge of the disk at the horizon," nevertheless, later, in studying one
of the cosmogonical hymns of Dīrghatamas, the son of Mamata, reaches the
conclusion that the singer had knowledge both of the celestial and of
the terrestrial Pole, and that, in seeking to answer the question as to
*the* 

<span id="page_243">p. 243</span>

*birth place of humanity*, he locates it precisely at the point of
contact between the polar mountain and the Pole of the northern
sky. <span id="fr_368"></span>[1](#fn_368.md)

We have seen that, according to Old-Iranian tradition also, man was
created in the "*central*" division of the earth. The primordial tree,
which "kept the strength of all kinds of trees," was "in the vicinity of
the *Middle* of the Earth." <span id="fr_369"></span>[2](#fn_369.md) The
primeval ox, which stood by the Paradise river when the destroyer came,
was "in the *Middle* of the Earth." <span
id="fr_370"></span>[3](#fn_370) Mount Taêra (Pahl.: Têrak.md), the
celestial Pole, and Kakâd-i-Dâîtîk, the mountain of the terrestrial
Pole, are each described in similar terms: the one as "Centre of the
World," the other as "Centre of the Earth." <span
id="fr_371"></span>[4](#fn_371.md) The expression *Apâm Nepât*, the "Navel
of the Waters," occurs in the Avestan writings again and again, and is
always applied either to the world-fountain from which all waters
proceed, or to the spirit presiding over it. <span
id="fr_372"></span>[5](#fn_372.md) But as this world-fountain,

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Ardvî Sûra, is
located in the north polar sky (see next chapter), we have here also a
recognition of a world-*omphalos*, inseparable from the ancient and
sacred Paradise-mountain at the Pole. <span
id="fr_373"></span>[1](#fn_373.md)

The Chinese terrestrial Paradise is described not only as "at the Centre
of the Earth," but also as *directly under* Shang-te's heavenly palace,
which is declared to be in the North star, and which is sometimes styled
"Palace of the Centre." <span id="fr_374"></span>[2](#fn_374.md) Very
probably the historic designation, "The Middle Kingdom," was originally
a sacred name, <span id="fr_375"></span>[3](#fn_375.md) commemorative of
that primeval middle country which the Akkadian called Akkad, the Indian
Ilâvrita, the Iranian Kvanîras, and the Northman Idavollr. In the
funeral rites of China, this supposition finds a cogent
confirmation. <span id="fr_376"></span>[4](#fn_376.md)

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

Passing to Japan, it is curiously interesting to note that the Ainos,
who are supposed to have been the first inhabitants, are believed to
have come into the archipelago "from the North;" <span
id="fr_377"></span>[1](#fn_377.md) that their heaven is on inaccessible
mountain-tops in the same quarter; <span id="fr_378"></span>[2](#fn_378.md)
and that their name, according to some authorities, etymologically
signifies "*Offspring of the Centre*." <span
id="fr_379"></span>[3](#fn_379.md) In burial, their dead are always so
placed that when resurrected their faces will be set toward the lofty
northern country from which their ancestors are believed to have come,
and to which their spirits are believed to have returned. <span
id="fr_380"></span>[4](#fn_380.md)

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

Taking these facts in connection with those presented in chapter second
of the preceding part, one can hardly evade the conclusion that, when
Griffis informs us that the Japanese considered their country as lying
at "the top of the world," and when others say that the Japanese once
regarded their country as the "Centre of the World," <span
id="fr_381"></span>[1](#fn_381.md) it is most probable that these writers
have applied to the Japan of to-day ideas which originally belonged to a
far-distant prehistoric polar Japan, the primitive seat of the race, as
it has lived on in these most ancient traditions of the Ainos.

In Scandinavian mythology we meet with a similar idea. In the Eddas,
both Asgard and Idavollr are represented as in "the Centre of the
World;" and at least one author, in explaining the reason of it, has
come within a hair's-breadth of the truth, though missing it. <span
id="fr_382"></span>[2](#fn_382.md)

The ancient Mexicans conceived of the cradle of the human race as
situated in the farthest North, upon the highest of mountains,
cloud-surrounded,

<span id="page_247">p. 247</span>

the residence of the god Tlaloc. Thence come the rains and all streams,
for Tlaloc is the god of waters. The first man, Quetzalcoalt, after
having ruled as king of the Golden Age in Mexico, returned by divine
direction to the primeval Paradise in the North (*Tlapallan*), and
partook of the draught of immortality. The stupendous terraced
pyramid-temple in Cholula was a copy and symbol of the sacred
Paradise-mountain of Aztec tradition, which was described as standing
"in the *Centre* of the *Middle-country*." <span
id="fr_383"></span>[1](#fn_383.md) Some of the Mexican myths represent the
mountain as now "crooked," or turned partly over. For the true
explanation of this see above, pp. 192-196.

Among the ancient Inca-subjects of Peru <span
id="fr_384"></span>[2](#fn_384.md) was

<span id="page_248">p. 248</span>

found the same idea of a Navel of the Earth, and even among the
Chickasaws of Mississippi. <span id="fr_385"></span>[1](#fn_385.md)

Thus is all ancient thought full of this legendary idea of a mysterious,
primeval, holy, Paradisaic Earth-centre,—a spot connected as is no other
with the "Centre of Heaven," the Paradise of God. Why it should be so no
one has ever told us; but the hypothesis which places the Biblical Eden
at the Pole, and makes all later earth navels commemorative of that
primal one, affords a perfect explanation. In the light of it, there is
no difficulty in understanding that Earth-centre in Jerusalem with which
we began. The inconspicuous pillar in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre
symbolizes and commemorates far more than the geographical ignorance of
mediæval ages. It stands for the Japanese pillar by which the first soul
born upon earth mounted to the sky. It stands for the World-column of
the East-Aryans and the Chinvat Bridge of Iran. It stands for the
law-proclaiming pillar of orichalcum in Atlantis, placed in the centre
of the most central land. It stands for that Talmudic pillar by means of
which the tenants of the terrestrial Paradise mount to the celestial,
and, having spent the Sabbath,

<span id="page_249">p. 249</span>

return to pass the week below. It symbolizes Cardo, Atlas, Meru,
Harâ-berezaiti, Kharsak-Kurra,—every fabulous mountain on whose top the
sky pivots itself, and around which all the heavenly bodies ceaselessly
revolve. It perpetuates a religious symbolism which existed in its
region before ever Jerusalem had been made the Hebrew capital,—recalling
to our modern world the *tabbur ha-aretz* of a period anterior to the
days of Samuel. <span id="fr_386"></span>[1](#fn_386.md) In tradition it is
said to mark the precise spot "whence the clay was taken, out of which
the body of Adam was modeled." It does so, but it does it in a language
and method which were common to all the most ancient nations of the
earth. It points not to the soil in which it stands, but to the holier
soil of a far-away primitive Eden. <span id="fr_387"></span>[2](#fn_387.md)

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_327"></span>[225:1](pf28.htm#fr_327.md) Printed in advance in
the *Boston University Year Book*, vol. xi. 1884.

<span id="fn_328"></span>[226:1](pf28.htm#fr_328.md) As my own inspection
of this monument was nearly thirty years ago, I have thought it well to
make inquiry as to its present state. The following, written under date
of Oct. 28, 1884, by my obliging friend, Dr. Selah Merrill, the United
States Consul at Jerusalem, and well known as an Oriental archæologist,
will be read with much interest: "The stone to which you refer still
stands in the middle of the Church (Greek) of the Holy Sepulchre, and is
called the Centre or Navel of the Earth. It is called a 'pillar,'
although it is not a pillar, but a vase, conforming in its general shape
to a large, tall fruit dish. The top is in the form of a basin, with a
raised portion in its centre; that is, in the bottom of the basin. I was
told that at every feast bread was laid on this pillar. I am assured
that it is called the Centre of the Earth only by the Arab or native
Christians of Syria, and not by the Greeks proper; also, that every
Greek church in Syria that is built after the form of this one has such
a 'pillar' in the centre. Within two or three years past, an old church
has been <span id="page_227">p. 227</span> excavated a little distance
north of the Damascus gate. In the *Palestine Fund Report* for October,
1883, I wrote some account of this to supplement what had been written
before by others. In the centre of that church there is a similar stone,
but that is a real pillar. This church is no doubt very old, and is
popularly spoken of as the 'Church of St. Stephen.' In my judgment it
stands on the site of an older church.

"It seemed to me a little singular that this object should be called a
'pillar' (*Amûd*), when it is only a vase, or vase-shaped; but as the
tradition connected with it is very old, the name may have come down
from the time when the object used for this purpose was actually a
pillar or column."

It is interesting to compare with the foregoing the description given by
Bernard Surius, of Brussels, in the year 1646, particularly as at that
time the "Oriental Greeks" seem to have had no scruple in calling the
pillar the Centre of the Earth: "Omtrent het midden steckt eenen witten
marmer-steen uyt, van twee voeten in syn vierkant, daer een rondt
putteken in is, ’t welck soo de Oostsche Griecken seggen, het midden van
den aerdt-bodem is." *Reyse van Jerusalem*. Antwerp, 1649: p. 664.

<span id="fn_329"></span>[227:1](pf28.htm#fr_329.md) Bishop Argulf, in his
pilgrimage, A.D. 700, "saw some other relics, and he observed a lofty
column in the holy places to the north of the Church of Golgotha, in the
middle of the city, which at midday at the summer solstice casts no
shadow; which shows that this is the centre of the earth." Wright,
*Early Travels in Palestine*, p. 4. As late as A.D. 1102, it still seems
to have been outside the then existing Church. Bishop Sæwulf says, "At
the head of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, *in the wall outside*, not
far from the place of Calvary, is the place called *Compas*, which our
Lord Jesus Christ himself signified and measured with his own hand as
the middle of the world according to the words of the Psalmist, 'God is
my king of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.'" Ibid., p.
38. In 1322, however, it is described by Sir John de Maundeville as "in
the midst of the Church." Ibid., p. 167. At one time in the Middle Ages,
the spot seems to have been marked by a letter or inscription. <span

<span id="fn_330"></span>[229:1](pf28.htm#fr_330.md) "The Hindus generally
represent Mount Meru of a conical figure, and kings were formerly fond
of raising mounds of earth in that shape, which they venerated like the
divine Meru, and the gods were called down by spells to come and dally
upon them. They are called *Meru-sringas*, or the peaks of Meru. There
are four of them either in or near Benares; the more modern, and of
course the more perfect, is at a place called Sár-náth. It was raised in
the year of Christ 1027. . . . This conical hill is about sixty feet
high, with a small but handsome octagonal temple on the summit. It is
said in the inscription that this artificial hill was intended as a
representation of the worldly Meru, the hill of God, and the tower of
Babel, with its seven steps or zones, was probably raised with a similar
view and for the same purpose."—Wilford in *Asiatic Researches*, vol.

mountains \[the Bear Tribe?\]. The fruits of this latter union were men
of extraordinary valor and nimble hunters, who, after a long life spent
in the vicinity of their birth, departed to the far North, where they
still live on the high and inaccessible tablelands above the mountains;
and, being immortal, they direct, by their magical influences, the
actions and the destiny of men; that is, the Ainos."—Ibid., p. 28.

<span id="fn_380"></span>[245:4](pf28.htm#fr_380.md) "It may not be devoid
of interest to mention here that the Ainos bury their dead with the head
to the South. . . . The Aino, to-day, as he did in ancient times, buries
his dead by covering the body with matting, and placing it with the head
to the South in a grave which is about three feet deep." *Notes on
Japanese Archæology with especial reference to the Stone Age*, by Henry
von Siebold, Yokohama, 1879, p. 6. Let no reader imagine this a
meaningless rite of undeveloped savages." From all these observations,
as well as from the traditions of the Ainos, in which are ever-recurring
laments for a better past; and from many peculiarities in their customs,
we must conclude that the Ainos are to be classed with those peoples
that have earlier been more richly supplied with the implements of
civilization, but have become degraded through isolation. Prehistoric
discoveries . . . favor this view. The pits found there for dwellings
indicate that the Ainos came from the North to Yezo." Professor Brauns,
of Halle. Translated from Memoirs of the Berlin Anthropological Society,
in *Science*. Cambridge, 1884; p. 72.

<span id="fn_382"></span>[246:2](pf28.htm#fr_382.md) "Nos ancêtres
scandinaves plaçaient la demeure de leurs dieux, Asgard, au milieu du
monde, c’est-à-dire au centre de la surface de la terre d’alors. Il est
assez remarquable qu’une telle idée n’est pas sans fondement, puisqu’il
faut admettre, comme je crois l’avoir démontré, que l’Europe, l’Asie, et
l’Amérique, unis vers le pôle nord, formaient avant le déluge un seul
continent." Frédérik Klee, *Le Déluge*, Fr. ed. Paris, 1847: p. 188 n.
But, by clinging to "the highest mountains of Asia," as the centre
originally meant, M. Klee loses the chief advantage of his supposed
union of the continents at the Pole.—The Teutonic *omphalos* of the
world is preserved at Finzingen, near Altstädt, in Saxe-Weimar. See Kuhn
and Schwartz, *Norddeutsche Sagen*. Leipsic, 1848: p. 215.

Bergen weil sie glaubten, dass auf ihnen Tlaloc, der Herr des Paradieses
wohne. Sie wurden einerseits als der *Mittelpunkt der Erde* betrachtet,
andererseits aber als die Stätte, welche *dem Himmel am nächsten* ist,
und ihm in näherer Berührung als die Erde selbst steht." Keerl, *Die
Schöpfungsgeschichte*, p. 799. In like manner the national temple of
Tlaloc and Vizilputzli, his brother, stood in the centre of the city of
Mexico, whence four causeway roads conducted East, West, North, and
South. In the centre of the temple was a richly ornamented Pillar of
peculiar sanctity. Bancroft, *Native Races*, vol. iii., p. 292. The
Quiché prayer to the "Heart of Heaven, Heart of Earth," would seem to
rest upon similar conceptions of the true abode of God. Popol Vuh. Max

<span id="fn_384"></span>[247:2](pf28.htm#fr_384.md) "The centre and
capital of this great territory was Cuzco (*i.e.*, 'navel'), whence to
the borders of the kingdom branched off four great highways, North and
South and East and West, each traversing one of the four provinces or
vice-royalties into which Peru was divided." *The Land of the Incas*, by
W. H. Davenport Adams. London, 1883: p. 20. In the central temple here,
too, there was a Pillar, *placée dans le centre d’un cercle dans l’axe
du grand temple et traversée par un diamètre de l’est à l’ouest*. P.

Indiens du Nouveau-Monde et de leur Civilisation*. Paris, 1883: p. 125.
Still more interesting is it to note that the predecessors of the
Peruvians are reported to have had an idea of the work of the creation
of the world as proceeding from the North to the South. Dorman, *Origin
of Primitive Superstitions*. Philadelphia, 1881, p. 334.

mounds left in Mississippi were called '*navels*' by the Chickasaws,
although the Indians are said not to have had any idea whether these
were natural mounds or artificial structures. They thought Mississippi
was at *the centre of the earth*, and the mounds were as the navel in
the middle of the human body."—Gerald Massey, referring to Schoolcraft,
i. 311.

scientific basis of this ancient symbolism is vividly shown in our above

North Pole.
