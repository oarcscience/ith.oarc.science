### CHAPTER VI.

#### THE CRADLE OF THE RACE IN ANCIENT AKKADIAN, ASSYRIAN, AND BABYLONIAN THOUGHT.

<span class="small">*We have here, even to the most minute details, an
exact reproduction of the Aryan conception of Mount Meru, or Albordj,
with its accessories. Here is the abode of the heavenly hierarchy,
located on the summit of the Kharsak, or sacred mount which penetrates
the heavens exactly in the region of the Pole star*.—<span
class="smallcaps">Rev. O. D. Miller</span>.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> have already seen that the prehistoric
inhabitants of the Tigro-Euphrates basin, called by some Akkadians, by
others Sumerians, by yet others Akkado-Sumerians, had like other Asiatic
peoples their Mountain of the World, on whose top was the celestial
Paradise, and around which sun, moon, and stars revolved. Our present
task is to locate this mountain more exactly, and to consider its
significance for our hypothesis respecting the site of Eden.

That the earth, as conceived of by this ancient people, was spherical is
not at the present day questioned. With their ideas probably no
archæologist was more familiar than the late François Lenormant, and he
expresses himself as follows: "'The Chaldees,' says Diodorus Siculus
(lib. ii., 31), 'have quite an opinion of their own about the shape of
the earth; they imagine it to have the form of a boat turned upside
down, and to be hollow underneath.' This opinion remained to the last in
the Chaldæan sacerdotal schools; their astronomers believed in it, and
tried, according to Diodorus, to support it by

<span id="page_164">p. 164</span>

scientific arguments. *It is of very ancient origin, a remnant of the
ideas of the purely Akkadian period*. . . . Let us imagine, then, a
boat, turned over; not such an one as we are in the habit of seeing, but
a round skiff, like those which are still used under the name of *Kufa*
on the shores of the lower Tigris and Euphrates, and of which there are
many representations in the historical sculptures of the Assyrian
palaces; the sides of this round skiff bend upwards from the point of
the greatest width, so that they are shaped like a hollow sphere
deprived of two thirds of its height \[?\], and showing a circular
opening at the point of division. Such was the form of the earth
according to the authors of the Akkadian magical formulæ and the
Chaldæan astrologers of after years. We should express the same idea in
the present day by comparing it to an orange of which the top had been
cut off, leaving the orange upright upon the flat surface thus produced.
The upper and convex surface constituted the earth properly so called,
the inhabitable earth (*ki*) or terraqueous surface (*ki-a*), to which
the collective name *kalama*, or the countries, is also given." <span
id="fr_200"></span>[1](#fn_200.md)

It is well known that in minor details Diodorus is often found not
altogether trustworthy. He was not a critical reporter. While,
therefore, in the above quotation he has undoubtedly preserved to us one
of the ancient Chaldæan similes, <span id="fr_201"></span>[2](#fn_201.md)
by the use of which the true figure of the earth was taught, I can but
think that the statement as to the hollowness of the

<span id="page_165">p. 165</span>

earth underneath is an unauthorized inference, suggested by the hollow
boat, and made by the comparatively uninstructed Greek solely upon his
own responsibility. It is true that, in the same work from which the
above extract is taken, Lenormant endeavors to adjust Akkadian cosmology
to such a notion of a hollow sphere, saying, "The interior concavity
opening from underneath was the terrestrial abyss, *ge*, where the dead
found a home (*kur-nu-de*, *ki-gal*, *aralli*). The central point in it
was the nadir, or, as it was called, 'the root,' *uru*, the foundation
of the whole structure of the world; this gloomy region witnessed the
nocturnal journey of the sun." <span id="fr_202"></span>[1](#fn_202.md) But
nothing can be more evident on examination than that this attempt
involves the writer in at least three inconsistencies: First, if the sun
visits the interior of the earth at night, its proper orbit cannot be
round and round the Mountain of the World to the northeast of Babylonia,
as our author elsewhere represents. Second, if *aralli*, the abode of
the dead, is in the interior of the hollow earth, it cannot be to the
northeast of Babylonia, as it is represented to be in the context.
Third, if the earth was conceived of as hollow, of course its whole
central portion was empty space; but according to this presentation its
central point "was called 'the root,' *uru*, the foundation of the whole
structure of the world." Surely the foundation of the world can scarcely
have been supposed to be mere emptiness. To a layman in these studies
this uru would much rather suggest

<span id="page_166">p. 166</span>

the antarctic *Tap-en-to* mountain of ancient Egyptian thought, the
*Ku-Meru* of ancient India.

But it is time to return to the Akkadian, or Akkado-Sumerian, mountain
of the gods. Again we quote Lenormant: "Above the earth extended the sky
(*ana*), spangled with its fixed stars (*mul*), and revolving round the
Mountain of the East (*Kharsak Kurra*), the column which joins the
heavens and the earth, and serves as an axis to the celestial vault. The
culminating point in the heavens, the zenith (*nuzku*), <span
id="fr_203"></span>[1](#fn_203.md) was not this axis or pole; on the
contrary, it was situated immediately above the country of Akkadia,
which was regarded as the centre of the inhabited lands, whilst the
mountain which acted as a pivot to the starry heavens was to the
northeast of this country. Beyond the mountain, and also to the
northeast, extended the land of *aralli*, which was very rich in gold,
and was inhabited by the gods and blessed spirits." <span
id="fr_204"></span>[2](#fn_204.md)

Here we have the "Mountain of the East" located, not in the east, but in
the northeast. Elsewhere our author recognizes most fully the identity
of this mount with the *Har-Moed* of Isaiah xiv. 14, and the difficulty
of placing it anywhere but at the North Pole. <span
id="fr_205"></span>[3](#fn_205.md) He adduces from the cuneiform texts no
evidence whatever for a location to the "northeast," and seems to fix
upon that direction only as a compromise of his own. "*Nous devons
conclure*" is his language. His only reason for thinking of any other
position than one due north appears to be a cuneiform expression which
seems to make Kharsak Kurra at the same time "the mountain of the

<span id="page_167">p. 167</span>

sunrise." <span id="fr_206"></span>[1](#fn_206.md) This, in reality,
instead of being a reason for searching among the mountains to the east
of Assyria or Babylonia, is, when rightly understood, precisely an
additional reason for looking to the north. <span
id="fr_207"></span>[2](#fn_207.md)

One other statement in the extract calls for notice. The writer seems to
have anticipated that his readers would inevitably locate a mountain,
described as "the column which joins the heavens and the earth, and
serves as an axis to the celestial vault," under the celestial pole; and
believing that the cuneiform texts which locate the celestial pole
directly over Akkad (or Akkadia), "the centre of the inhabited lands,"
to be inconsistent with such a location, he introduces the remark that
"the culminating point in the heavens" was "not the axis or pole; on the
contrary, it was situated immediately over the country of Akkadia, which
was regarded as the centre of the inhabited lands, whilst the mountain
which acted as a pivot to the starry heavens was to the northeast of
this country."

<span id="page_168">p. 168</span>

From so eminent an authority one naturally hesitates to differ; but
inasmuch as M. Joachim Ménard, in a work as recent as the one from which
we have quoted, while agreeing with M. Lenormant in making Akkad the
traditional "centre of the earth," differs from him in locating
*precisely in this central country* "the mountain on whose apex the
heaven of the fixed stars is pivoted," <span
id="fr_208"></span>[1](#fn_208.md) we cannot avoid the conclusion that
Lenormant's distinction between the zenith of Akkad and the celestial
pole is based upon a misapprehension, and is productive only of
confusion. The solution of all difficulties is found the moment the
mythological Akkad is made a circumpolar mother-country, after which the
Akkad of the Tigro-Euphrates valley was commemoratively named. <span
id="fr_209"></span>[2](#fn_209.md) This supposition is made all the easier
by three noteworthy facts: (1) that both the names Akkad and Sumir are
not Assyrio-Babylonian, but loan-words from an older prehistoric
tongue; <span id="fr_210"></span>[3](#fn_210) (2.md) that the etymological
signification and appellatives of Akkad thoroughly identify it with the
lofty country at the north polar summit of the earth; <span
id="fr_211"></span>[4](#fn_211.md)

<span id="page_169">p. 169</span>

and (3) that recently discovered tablets are compelling the
Assyriologists to recognize two Akkads, one in the Tigro-Euphrates
valley and one much farther to the North, though as yet none of these
scholars have looked as far in that direction as to the Pole. <span
id="fr_212"></span>[1](#fn_212.md)

If further proof were needed that the Kharsak Kurra of the earliest
inhabitants of Mesopotamia was identical with the north polar
World-mountain of Egypt and the surrounding Asiatic nations, it would be
found on investigating their conceptions of the region of the
disembodied dead and their notion of a mountain of the rulers of the
dead *antipodal* to the mount of the gods. The Akkadians, like the
ancients generally, conceived of the realm of the dead as located to the
South. Their underworld being simply the under or southern hemisphere of
the earth, they could not place it in any other direction. In naming the
cardinal points the Akkadians therefore called the South "the *funereal*
point." <span id="fr_213"></span>[2](#fn_213.md) In this quarter was
located the mount of the rulers of the

<span id="page_170">p. 170</span>

dead. It was the under or south polar projection of the earth. It
corresponded with the south polar mount of demons in Hindu and in
Egyptian thought. Even Lenormant, whose mistake in locating the mount of
the gods in the East, logically leads to the mistake of locating this
mount of the rulers of the dead in the West, still unconsciously gives
evidence as to the true location by stating that it is "situated in the
low-down portions of the earth." <span id="fr_214"></span>[1](#fn_214.md)
And elsewhere he has told us that in the Akkadian language to descend
and to go southward were synonymous expressions. <span
id="fr_215"></span>[2](#fn_215.md)

With Professor Friedrich Delitzsch, then, we locate the Akkadian Kharsak
Kurra at the North. <span id="fr_216"></span>[3](#fn_216.md) Once make the
*primeval* Akkad the equivalent of Ilâvrita in Hindu, or of Kvanîras in
Iranian, mythology, and all is perfectly plain and self-consistent. The
primitive Akkad is now "the centre of all lands" in the same sense in
which Ilâvrita and Kvanîras are in their respective systems. As in both
these systems the mount of the gods is in the centre of this central
country, so is Kharsak Kurra. Su-Meru and Harâ-berezaiti and Kwen-lun
are each exactly under the Pole-star, having it in their zenith; the
same is true of Kharsak Kurra. As every splendor of a divine abode
crowns the top of all the former, so is the summit of Kharsak
resplendent beyond description. As the sun, moon, and stars revolve
around the Hindu and Iranian and Chinese mounts, so is Kharsak the point
"on which

<span id="page_171">p. 171</span>

the heaven of the fixed stars is pivoted." Moreover from its top flows
that Eden river, which, like [Gangâ](errata.htm#2.md) and Ardvî-Sûra,
waters the whole earth. <span id="fr_217"></span>[1](#fn_217.md)

Under these circumstances the candid reader will probably be prepared to
agree with the statement of Mr. Miller which we have made the motto to
this chapter, and to say with Gerald Massey, only with better
understanding than his, "The cradle of the Akkadian race was the
'Mountain of the World,' that 'Mount of the Congregation in the thighs
of the North.' . . . The first mount of mythology was the Mount of the
Seven Stars, Seven Steps, Seven Stages, Seven Caves, which represented
the celestial North as the birth-place of the initial motion and the
beginning of time. This starting-point in heaven above is the one
original for the many copies found on the earth below. . . . The
Akkadians date from Urdhu, the district of the northern Mountain of the
World." <span id="fr_218"></span>[2](#fn_218.md)

fontaine, dont le nom est accadien et veut dir 'las ource qui enveloppe
la montagne sainte,' est dite 'fille de l’Océan,' *marat apsi*, et
invoquée comme une déesse douée d’une personalité vivante, pareille a
celle que revêt chez les Iraniens Ardvîçourâ-Anâhitâ. L’existence chez
les Chaldéens de la croyance à un cours d’eau mythique d’où procèdent
tous les fleuves de la terre semble attestée par la mention d’une
rivière (dont le nom est malheureusement en partie détruit sur la
