### PREFACE.

<span class="smallcaps">This</span> book is not the work of a dreamer.
Neither has it proceeded from a love of learned paradox. Nor yet is it a
cunningly devised fable aimed at particular tendencies in current
science, philosophy, or religion. It is a thoroughly serious and sincere
attempt to present what is to the author's mind the true and final
solution of one of the greatest and most fascinating of all problems
connected with the history of mankind.

That this true solution has not been furnished before is not strange.
The suggestion that primitive Eden was at the Arctic Pole seems at first
sight the most incredible of all wild and willful paradoxes. And it is
only within the lifetime of our own generation that the progress of
geological discovery has relieved the hypothesis of fatal antecedent
improbability. Moreover, when one considers the enormous variety and
breadth of the fields from which its evidences of truth must be derived;
when one remembers how recent are those comparative sciences on whose
results the argument must chiefly depend; when one observes that many of
the most striking of our alleged proofs, both in

<span id="page_viii">p. viii</span>

the physical and in the anthropological domain, are precisely the latest
of the conclusions -of these most modern of all sciences,—it is easy to
see that a generation ago the demonstration here attempted could not
have been given. Even five years ago some of the most interesting and
cogent of our arguments would as yet have been lacking.

The interest which has so long invested our problem, and which has
prompted so many attempts to solve it, was never greater than to-day.
The lapse of centuries has rendered many another question antiquated,
but not this. On the contrary, the more the modern world has advanced in
new knowledge, the more exigent has grown the necessity of finding a
valid solution. Men are feeling as never before that until the
starting-point of human history can be determined, the historian, the
archæologist, and the paleontological anthropologist are all working in
the dark. It is seen that without this desideratum the ethnologist, the
philologist, the mythographer, the theologian, the sociologist can none
of them construct anything not liable to profound modification, if not
to utter overthrow, the moment any new light shall be thrown upon the
mother-region and the prehistoric movements of the human race. Every
anthropological science, therefore, and every science related to
anthropology, seems at the present moment to be standing in a state of
dubitant expectancy, willing to work a little tentatively, but conscious
of

<span id="page_ix">p. ix</span>

its destitution of the needful primal datum, and conscious of its
consequent lack of a valid structural law.

To the believer in Revelation, or even in the most ancient and venerable
Ethnic Traditions, the volume here presented will be found to possess
uncommon interest. For many years the public mind has been schooled in a
narrow naturalism, which has in its world-view as little room for the
extraordinary as it has for the supernatural. Decade after decade the
representatives of this teaching have been measuring the natural
phenomena of every age and of every place by the petty measuring rod of
their own local and temporary experience. So long and so successfully
have they dogmatized on the constancy of Nature's laws and the
uniformity of Nature's forces that of late it has required no small
degree of courage to enable an intelligent man to stand up in the face
of his generation and avow his personal faith in the early existence of
men of gigantic stature and of almost millenarian longevity. Especially
have clergymen and Christian teachers and writers upon Biblical history
been embarrassed by the popular incredulity on these subjects, and not
infrequently by a consciousness that this incredulity was in some
measure shared by themselves. To all such, and indeed to all the broader
minded among the naturalists themselves, a new philosophy of primeval
history—a philosophy which for all the alleged extraordinary

<span id="page_x">p. x</span>

effects provides the adequate extraordinary causes—cannot fail to prove
most welcome.

The execution of the plan of the book is by no means all that the author
could desire. To the elaboration of so vast an argument, the materials
for which must be gleaned from every possible field of knowledge, the
broadest and profoundest scholar might well devote the undistracted
labor of a lifetime. To the writer, loaded with the cares of a laborious
executive office, there were lacking both the leisure and the equipment
otherwise attainable for so high a task. The best he could do was to
turn one or two summer vacations into work-time and give the result to
the world. Of the correctness of his position he has no doubt, and of
the preparedness of the scientific world to accept it he is also
confident.

To the foregoing remarks it may be proper to add that apart from its
immediate purpose the book has interest, and, it is hoped, value as a
contribution to the infant science of Comparative Mythology. By the
application of the author's "True Key to Ancient Cosmology and Mythical
Geography," it has been possible to adjust and interpret a great variety
of ancient cosmological and geographical notions never before understood
by modern scholars. For example, the origin and significance of the
Chinvat Bridge are here for the first time explained. The indication of
the polocentric character common to the mythical systems of sacred
geography

<span id="page_xi">p. xi</span>

among all ancient peoples will probably be new to every reader. The new
light thrown upon such questions as those relating to the direction of
the Sacred Quarter, the location of the Abode of the Dead, the character
and position of the Cosmical Tree, the course of the backward-flowing
Ocean-river, the correlation of the "Navels" of Earth and Heaven,—not to
enumerate other points,—can hardly fail to attract the lively attention
of all students and teachers of ancient mythology and mythical
geography.

To teachers of Homer the fresh contributions toward a right
understanding of Homeric cosmology are sure to prove of value. And if,
in the end, the work may only lead to a systematic and intelligent
teaching of the long neglected, but most important science of ancient
cosmology and mythical geography in all reputable universities and
classical schools, it will surely not have been written in vain.

That the author has escaped all errors and oversights while ranging
through so numerous and such diverse fields of investigation, many of
which are but just opened to the pioneering specialist, is too much to
expect. He only asks that any such blemishes which a more competent
scholarship may detect, or which the progress of new learning may yet
bring to light, may not be allowed to prejudice the force of true
arguments, but may be pointed out in the spirit of a candid and helpful
criticism.

In conclusion, the author respectfully commits

<span id="page_xii">p. xii</span>

his work to all truth-seeking spirits,—not less to the patient
investigators of nature than to the students of history, of literature,
and of religion. Particularly would he commend it to all those yearning
and waiting *Königssöhnen* whose experience has been described by Hans
Andersen in the words, "Es war einmal ein Königssohn; Niemand hatte so
viele und schöne Bücher wie er; Alles, was in dieser Welt geschehen,
konnte er darin lesen, und die Abbildungen in prächtigen Kupferstichen
erblicken. Von jedem Volke und jedem Lande konnte er Auskunft erhalten;
aber wo der Garten des Paradieses zu finden sei, davon stand kein Wort
darin; *und der, gerade der war es, an dem er am meisten dachte*." <span

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_0"></span>[xii:1](pf01.htm#fr_0.md) The same, being
interpreted, read as follows: "Once upon a time there was a king's son;
nobody had so many and such beautiful books as he. In these all that had
ever happened in the world he could read and see depicted in splendid
engravings. Of every people and of every land could he get information,
but as to where the Garden of Eden was,—not a word was to be found
therein; and this, just this it was, on which he meditated most of all."
