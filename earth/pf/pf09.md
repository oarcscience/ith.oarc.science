### CHAPTER I.

#### THE TESTIMONY OF GEOGONY, OR THE SCIENCE OF THE ORIGIN OF THE EARTH.

<span class="small">*Les lois générales de la géogénie favorisent d’une
façon remarquable l’hypothèse dont nous venons d’ebaucher les
traits*.—<span class="smallcaps">Count Saporta</span>.</span>

<span class="smallcaps">Could</span> it once be proven that the Arctic
terminus of the earth has always been the ice-bound region which it now
is, and which for thousands of years it has been, it would of course be
useless to entertain for a moment the hypothesis that the cradle of the
human race was there located. Probably the popular impression that from
the beginning of the world the far North has been the region of
unendurable cold has been one of the chief reasons why our hypothesis is
so late in claiming attention. At the present time, however, so far as
this difficulty is concerned, scientific studies have abundantly
prepared the way for the new theory.

That the earth is a slowly cooling body is a doctrine now all but
universally accepted. In saying this we say nothing for or against the
so-called nebular hypothesis of the origin of the world, for both
friends and foes of this unproven hypothesis believe in what is termed
the secular cooling or refrigeration of the earth. All authorities in
this field hold and teach that the time was when the slowly solidifying
planet was too hot to support any form of life, and that only at some
particular time in the cooling

<span id="page_58">p. 58</span>

process was there a temperature reached which was adapted to the
necessities of living things.

On what portion of the earth's surface, now, would this temperature
first be reached? Or would it everywhere be reached at the same time?

These are most interesting questions, and the writer has often marveled
that in scientific treatises on the cooling globe he could nowhere find
them formally discussed. Granting, however, a uniform interior heat and
a uniform loss of it in the mode of superficial radiation in all
directions into space, it is certain that if these were the only factors
in the problem the cooling process would affect every part of the
surface in a uniform manner, and we might confidently infer that the
temperature compatible with organic life was reached at the same time at
all points of the earth's surface. But the factors named are not the
only ones of the problem. In those far-off geologic ages the heat
received from the great central furnace of our system, the sun, cannot
have been less than at the present time. Some astronomers and geologists
claim that it was greater. <span id="fr_56"></span>[1](#fn_56.md) In any
case, therefore, as early as the time when the earth's atmosphere became
penetrable by the rays of the sun, local differences of temperature must
have been produced at the base of the atmosphere, whether the body of
the globe was as yet crusted over or not. Then as now, viewed apart from
air and water currents, every particular spot on the surface of the
globe must have had a temperature determined, first by the fixed and
uniform inherent heat of the earth-mass, and secondly by the varying
quantity of heat received from the sun. But

<span id="page_59">p. 59</span>

the difference between the solar heat received at a point under the
equator and that received at a point at the pole cannot have been less
in those ages than at the present time; and this incessant increment of
the equatorial heat of the earth by the direct rays of the sun suggests
at once the portions of the globe to which we must look if we would find
the regions which first became cool enough to sustain organic life. Then
as now the polar regions must have been cooler than the equatorial, and
hence, as far as the teachings of theoretical geogony can be trusted,
the conclusion is inevitable that there, to wit, in the polar regions,
life first became possible. <span id="fr_57"></span>[1](#fn_57.md)

The bearing of this result upon our central thesis is at once obvious.
We asked the geologist this question: "Is the hypothesis of a primeval
polar Eden admissible?" Looking at the slowly cooling earth alone, he
replies, "Eden conditions have probably at one time or another been
found everywhere upon the surface of the earth. Paradise may have been
anywhere." Looking at the cosmic environment, however, he adds, "But
while Paradise may have been anywhere, the *first* portions of the
earth's surface sufficiently cool to present the conditions of Eden life
were assuredly at the Poles."

recognition of the truth above set forth. See pp. 51, 52, 53, 60, of the
