# CHAPTER XXV.

## IN CONCLUSION

We have now stated a theory of the constitution of the earth and of all
the other planets, and this theory seems to account for every fact that
scientists have recorded as a result of their observations. This theory
either represents the truth of the matter or it does not. But if it does
not represent the truth what is the truth? What the orthodox scientists
have told us? Any time that the orthodox scientists will explain to us
the following phenomena as fully as our theory explains them, we will be
willing to abandon our theory. But until they can explain them in a
[consistent](errata.htm#118.md) way--that is to say not merely explain one
thing by an argument that is overthrown by some other thing, for
instance not explain the polar cap of Mars by some explanation which has
to be abandoned when they come to that of Venus--until they can do that
we are fully justified in claiming that our theory is the only one that
explains all the observed facts of the planetary universe.

### QUESTIONS THE SCIENTISTS MUST ANSWER

And so any scientist who wishes to dispute our theory ought to be able
to solve the following mysteries--for mysteries these things are and
always have been to orthodox science.

<span id="page_443">p. 443</span>

### WHY POLAR CAPS ON VENUS?

First: Why does the hot planet Venus have polar caps like those of Mars
if the Martian caps are really composed either of ice, snow or frozen
carbon-dioxide? Also, why do the polar caps of Venus and Mercury not wax
and wane as those of Mars are said to do? And why are the polar caps of
Mars seen to throw a mass of light many miles above the surface of the
planet when they are seen in a side view if they are only of ice? How
could they be so luminous in the first place--more luminous than snow is
when seen under similar circumstances? And how could Lowell see direct
gleams of light from the caps if there were not beams from a direct
light source?

Furthermore, how do scientists account for the fact, noted also by
Professor Lowell, whose observations on Mars all seem to support our
theory, that when the planet is viewed through the telescope at night
that its light is yellow and not white, as the light from snow caps
would be? The central sun is an incandescent mass, and just as the
glowing of an incandescent electric light looks yellow when seen from a
distance through darkness, so the direct light of the Martian sun would
appear yellow--but if this light were reflected from a solid white
surface it would certainly appear white. But it does not, and so it is
up to the scientists to tell us just why it does not. But so far as we
know they have not succeeded in doing this.

### PLANETARY NEBULAE ARE HOLLOW

And why have scientists never really considered the problem of the shape
of the planetary nebula? They know from actual observation and
photographs that the planetary nebula takes the form of a hollow shell
open at the poles and having a bright central nucleus or central sun at
its center. Why have they never thought what that must imply? It is
evidently one stage in the evolution of the nebula. Why have scientists
never asked themselves what that conformation must logically lead to?
Why do they ignore it altogether? Is it not because they cannot explain
it without too great a disturbance of their own theories? But our theory
shows how that stage in the evolution of a nebula is reached and how it
is passed, we show what precedes it in the history of the nebula and
what follows it. We show a continuous evolution passing through that
stage to further stages in which those polar openings are fixed, the
shell solidified, the nebula reduced to a planet. And it must be
remembered that while the original nebula was incomparably greater than
a planet in size, measuring even millions of miles across perhaps, at
the same time that nebula is composed of gases so attenuated and so
expanded by their immense heat that when they solidify they only make
one planet.

### HOW EXPLAIN THE AURORA?

Why have scientists never compared the facts of the light cap of Mars
with the light that plays over

<span id="page_445">p. 445</span>

our own polar regions? Do they forget that the auroral display has been
observed to take place without any reference to the changing of the
magnetic needle? And if the aurora is shown to be independent of
magnetic conditions what else can it be due to than a source of light?
Is not the reflection of the aurora light from the higher reaches of the
atmosphere comparable to the projection of the light of the
[Martian](errata.htm#119.md) caps into the higher reaches of the Martian
atmosphere? And how do scientists explain the fact that the aurora is
only distinctly seen in the very far north and only seen in a
fragmentary way when we get further south?

How do scientists explain the fact that when we go north it becomes
colder up to a certain point and then begins to get warm? How do they
explain the further fact that the source of this warmth is not any
influence from the south but a series of currents of warm water and of
warm winds from the north--supposed to be a land of solid ice? Where can
these currents come from? How could they come from anything else but an
open sea? And why should there be a warm open sea at the very place
where scientists expect to find eternal ice? Where could this warm water
possibly come from?

### FROM WHERE DOES THE RED POLLEN COME?

Why also should explorers find the inhospitable ice cliffs of the far
north covered in large areas with

<span id="page_446">p. 446</span>

the red pollen of an unknown plant? And why should they find the seeds
of tropical plants floating in these waters--when they are not found in
more southern waters? How should logs and branches of trees, sometimes
with fresh buds on them be found in these waters, all being borne down
by the warm currents from the north?

Why should the northern parts of Greenland be the world's greatest
habitat of the mosquito, an insect which is only found in warm
countries? How could it have got to Greenland if *it* came from the
south? Where do all the foxes and hares go which were seen traveling
north in Greenland? Where did the bears go? Was it possible that such
large creatures as bears could find sustenance on plains of eternal ice?

### HOW ABOUT THE MAMMOTH?

Scientists admit that the mammoth lived on the outside surface of the
earth somewhere around 100,000 years ago. That being the case, why are
mammoth carcasses found in Siberia which are perfectly fresh? If they
were killed by their climate changing from semi-tropical to frigid
100,000 years ago, would not their freezing be so gradual that they
would decompose before it took place? Is not the fact that fresh grass
is found between their teeth proof positive that they were frozen
immediately? Does it not prove that they were alive and eating one
minute, precipitated into an ice cleft the next minute and

<span id="page_447">p. 447</span>

frozen just as fast as the ice could do it? And if these tropical
animals were alive and in the neighborhood of ice crevasses does it not
mean that they were traveling and that they had a base from which to
travel, or a habitat, which was not itself icy but tropical, seeing that
this animal is a tropical and not an arctic animal? Have scientists ever
given any consideration of those facts, or have they been afraid of
them?

How do scientists explain the Eskimo traditions of other strange animals
in the Arctic, for instance, the animal which the Eskimos call the
arcla, and which they described to Captain Hall? And how do they explain
the remains, in good condition, of such a supposedly prehistoric animal
as the mylodon which was found in the Antarctic by Nordenskiold, and
which is known to be a type of animal that lives in a warm country?

### WHENCE THE HUMAN REMAINS IN THE ANTARCTIC?

And how do scientists explain the actual finding of human remains in the
Antarctic? So far as we know they have not even tried to explain it, but
the remains were found and no doubt has ever been cast upon the
integrity of those who found them. And as we have shown in our chapter
on the Antarctic, much of the fauna and flora of the southern islands
comes originally from the Antarctic, and only on our theory can an
original starting place be assigned to it.

<span id="page_448">p. 448</span>

How do scientists explain the fact that practically every competent
explorer from the earlier days down to Nansen has admitted that when he
got to the far North his theories of what he should find failed to work
and his methods of finding his positions also failed to work? How do
scientists explain those passages from Nansen which we have quoted,
showing that he was absolutely lost in the Arctic regions?

How do scientists explain the migrations of those birds which appear in
England and other northern countries one part of the year, in the
tropics another part of the year, but disappear entirely in the winter?
How do they explain the fact that neither Peary nor Cook was able to
prove the claim of reaching the north pole? Even supposing both men to
have acted in good faith is it not obvious that both were lost? How else
explain the discrepancies in Peary's own narrative which we have exposed
in a previous chapter?

### THE PUZZLE OF THE MOON

And here is another puzzle which the scientists might well be asked to
solve before they disdain the contributions of one who is not a member
of their guild or union. Some scientists, for example, Proctor, say that
the moon was originally a free [planetesimal](errata.htm#120.md) body which
has been captured by the earth. Other scientists--among them
Pickering--have claimed that the moon was thrown off from the earth's
surface in an early stage of the history of the

<span id="page_449">p. 449</span>

planet. They point to the Pacific coast bed as the depression that was
left. But as the mass of the moon is about one-eightieth of the mass of
the earth and the total of all the ocean beds a mere infinitesimal
fraction of the earth's mass it hardly looks as if this theory were
correct. At any rate the scientists have not yet succeeded in settling
the matter to their own satisfaction. One more example, we should say,
of the fallibility of science.

In short, how do scientists explain the whole general situation put up
to us by the discrepancies between actual findings in the polar regions
and their theories? The answer is that they do not try to explain these
things because they are quite unexplainable on their scientific basis.

And so the scientists cannot tell just what to do with our theory. One
policy is to ridicule us. For instance one professor of geology said
that our book was "a great joke." Perhaps it is, but the joke will be
found to be on the scientists.

This does not mean, however, that our theory is not scientific, and that
we do not believe in the work of scientists. On the contrary it is on
scientific observation that our theory is built. The people whom we
quote in substantiation of our theory are themselves scientists. Many
scientists, as we have shown in another chapter, view our theory with
sympathy. Our criticisms of the scientists, therefore, are confined to
those among them who neither accept our theory on

<span id="page_450">p. 450</span>

the one hand nor give any real reason for not accepting it on the other
hand. From these men who are no longer really scientists because they do
not display that spirit of fair-minded openness to conviction that
really makes the scientific spirit--from these men we appeal to those
others who really deserve the name of scientists because they are still
alert and open to conviction and able to change their minds whenever the
evidence makes it necessary.

And so our last word to the scientists is this: We are not prejudiced
against science and have not tried to make good our theory by any other
way except that of collecting indubitable evidence--that is by the
scientific method. Further, we are very anxious to have scientists of
every shade of opinion try to upset our theory if they can or verify it
if they can. But we do not want any scientists to make mere vague
objections, simply saying, as some have done, "There are many reasons
why this theory cannot be true." Perhaps there are, but what are those
reasons? That is the question we want them to answer. We have asked for
specific objections to our theory, we have tried hard to get at these
reasons, and every scrap of objection that the scientists of the
world--not of America only--have been able so far to advance against our
theory, every scrap of such objection is to be found set down in this
book--and answered. Let the reader turn again to the chapter in which we
refer to these objections. Is it not surprising that they are so

<span id="page_451">p. 451</span>

few? Is it not amazing that the great intellects--at least we would
suppose them to be such--which dominate our universities and teach our
youth, and plan our explorations and turn telescopes upon the stars, is
it not amazing, we repeat, that these people have not been able to
muster up any stronger reply to us that that? And we have given them
every facility, we have written them, showed them our arguments, and
have had some of their replies for years, before publishing this book.

Well, they have had all that opportunity and this is the best that they
have been able to do in reply.

So now let us suggest that they try to help our theory, since they
cannot demolish it. Let us ask them to turn their arguments and make
observations in support of our theory. For we wish to have the
co-operation of science in discovering and opening up this great new
world, and we are sure that public opinion will get behind us and aid us
in calling upon the scientists to take a stand definitely upon our
challenge--for it is a challenge that we throw down to the scientific
world--a challenge to disprove our theory if it can, and failing that to
admit frankly that this theory is a step in advance of the scientific
conceptions of the present day. And such admission would not be a blow
to the prestige of science. On the contrary it is the glory of true
science ever to advance, ever to welcome new truths, and we have
confidence

<span id="page_452">p. 452</span>

that the publication of these arguments will cause some at least of the
scientists of today to rally to our side.
