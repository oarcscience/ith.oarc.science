# CHAPTER XI.

## THE MAMMOTH

This is not the longest chapter in this book, but to anyone who wishes
to prove our theory "in a hurry" it may be commended, for it brings
proof to bear so startling, so incontrovertible, that we wonder how
these observations could have been made by the regular scientists and
their significance been overlooked. But then the regular scientists had
a theory of the earth's composition in their minds before they made
these observations. And the theory being there first would not budge to
make room for the truth.

### FROM WHERE DOES THE MAMMOTH COME?

These observations concern the presence in the polar regions of the
mammoth. That scientists should find old tusks and remains of this
animal is perhaps surprising, though it could be explained in some way
or other; but they also find perfectly fresh bodies of these animals.
They reason that these fresh bodies were preserved in that condition in
the ice for hundreds, perhaps thousands of centuries, but we shall show
that this is not the case. But let us marshal our evidence gradually.

The reader will remember that the mammoth and the mastodon are two
elephant-like animals but

<span id="page_221">p. 221</span>

much larger than our elephant of the tropics. They were vegetarian
animals and, like the elephant, inhabitants of a warm country. When
their remains were first discovered in the polar regions, therefore, it
was thought that at one time the polar regions had been very warm, with
plenty of vegetation, and that owing to the gradual change of the
earth's axis, the area which was once hot had gradually been brought
into positions where it grew colder until at last the mammoth and
mastodon were frozen out. Let us see whether this idea fits all the
facts in the case. But first let us see what those facts are.

In J. W. Bud's "The World's Wonders" we read:

"The farther north we penetrate, in greater abundance are found vestiges
of elephants, tortoises, crocodiles, and other beasts and reptiles of a
tropical climate. These are found in greatest abundance along the banks
of rivers flowing from the north, seeming to prove that there is,
somewhere beyond the frozen belt not yet penetrated by man, a warm
country, with climate and productions similar to those of the tropics.
Along the borders of Siberia, the remains of tropical animals are so
commonly found as to constitute a considerable source of commerce. In
Asiatic Russia there is not a single stream or river on the banks or in
the bed of which are not found bones of elephants, or other animals
equally strange to that climate. In 1799, a fisherman of Ton-goose,
named Schumachoff, discovered a tremendous

<span id="page_222">p. 222</span>

elephant--perfect as when thousands of years before, death had arrested
its breath--encased in a huge block of ice, clear as crystal. This man,
like his neighbors, was accustomed, at the end of the fishing season, to
employ his time in hunting for elephant tusks along the banks of the
Lena River, for the sake of the bounty offered by the government; and
while so employed, in the ardor of his pursuit, he passed several miles
beyond his companions when suddenly there appeared before his wondering
eyes the miraculous sight above alluded to. But this man was ignorant
and superstitious, and instead of hastening to announce his wonderful
discovery for the benefit of science, he stupidly gazed upon it in awe
and wonder, not daring to approach it. For several successive seasons
from the time when he first discovered it, did Schumachoff make stealthy
journeys to his crystallized monster, never finding courage sufficient
to approach it closely, but simply standing at a distance, once more to
feast his eyes on the wonder, and to carry away in his thick head enough
of terror to guarantee him a nightmare for a whole month of nights. At
last he found the imprisoned carcass stranded on a convenient sand-bank,
and boldly attacked it, broke the glittering casing, and roughly
despoiling the great beast of its splendid tusks, hurried home and sold
them for fifty roubles, leaving the well preserved bulk of elephant
meat, thousands of years old, yet juicy and without

<span id="page_223">p. 223</span>

taint, to be devoured by wolves and bears or hacked to bits by natives
as food for their dogs."

### IN PERFECT PRESERVATION

We next turn to Dr. H. D. Northrop's "Earth, Sky, and Sea", where we
find some later information about this same case. It seems that after
the fisherman had left the mammoth carcass he told of its whereabouts
and a party set out to examine it:

"For some time the flesh of this animal was cut off for dog-meat by
people around, and bears, wolves, gluttons, and foxes, fed upon it till
the skeleton was nearly cleared of its flesh. About three-fourths of the
skin, which was of a reddish-gray color, and covered with reddish wool
and black hairs about eight inches long, was saved, and such was its
weight, that it required ten men to remove it; the bones of the head,
with the tusks, weighed four hundred and sixteen pounds. The skeleton
was taken to St. Petersburg, where it may still be seen in the Museum of
Natural History. The animal must have been twice the ordinary size of
the existing elephant, and it must have weighed at least twenty-thousand
pounds."

### REMAINS OF TROPICAL ANIMALS

This same author goes on to say:

"Every year in the season of thawing (in Northern Asiatic Russia) the
vast rivers, which descend to the Frozen Ocean in the north of Siberia,
sweep down with their waters [innumerable](errata.htm#60.md) portions of
the banks

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

and expose to view the bones buried in the soil and excavations left by
the rushing waters. It is curious that the more we advance toward the
north of Russia, the more numerous do the bone depositaries become. In
spite of the undoubted testimony often repeated, of numerous travelers,
we can scarcely credit the statements made respecting some of the
islands of the glacial sea near the poles, situated opposite the mouths
of the Lena and of the Indigirska.

"All the islands nearest to the mainland, which is about thirty-six
leagues in length, except three or four small rocky mountains, are a
mixture of sand and ice, so that when the thaw sets in and their banks
begin to fall, many mammoth bones are found. All the isle is formed of
the bones of this extraordinary animal, of the horns and skulls of
buffaloes, or of an animal which resembles them, and of some rhinoceros
horns.

### WHOLE ISLAND OF REMAINS

"New Siberia and the Isle of Lachon are for the most part only a mass of
sand, of ice, and of elephant's teeth. At every tempest the sea casts
ashore new quantities of mammoth's tusks, and the inhabitants of Siberia
carry on a profitable trade in this fossil ivory. Every year during the
summer innumerable fishermen's barks direct their course towards this
isle of bones, and during winter immense caravans take the same route,
all the convoys drawn by

<span id="page_225">p. 225</span>

dogs, returning laden with the tusks of the mammoth, weighing each from
150 to 200 pounds. The isle of bones has served as a quarry of this
valuable material for export to China for five hundred years, and it has
been exported to Europe for upwards of a hundred. But the supply from
these strange mines remains undiminished.”

All we have to say to those last statements is that the supply must be
[replenished](errata.htm#61.md) right along or such a thing could not be so
everlasting. And we think there can be no doubt that these supplies of
remains have been and are being [replenished](errata.htm#62.md) right to
the present moment.

In his book, "In the Lena Delta", George W. Melville, the United States
naval officer and explorer, also tells of the immense tusks, in this
case stained black by being buried in peat bogs, which he saw in that
country. In some cases they measured nine feet along the curve, and were
thirty inches in circumference at the end near the skull. He saw one
train of thirty sleighs laden with the tusks on its way to China.

Our next witness is Nordenskiold who tells in his "Arctic Voyages" of
the traffic in mammoth tusks along the river Yennssej to China and
Russia. A little later he says:

"In the Siberian Polar Sea, the animal and vegetable types, so far as we
can judge beforehand, exclusively consist of survivals from the Glacial
period

<span id="page_226">p. 226</span>

which next preceded the present, which is not the case in the Polar Sea
where the Gulf Stream distributes its waters and whither it thus carries
types from more southerly regions."

It is evident that Nordenskiold has forgotten that the currents which he
thinks carry southerly types to the polar sea, really come from the
north, from the polar regions. And we shall show that these animals
which are apparently survivals from the glacial period are really
inhabitants of the interior of the earth which, owing to its climatic
conditions, is now the home of animals and vegetable species which
flourished on the outer surface of the earth in the carboniferous era of
giant ferns, mammoths, and other species characteristic of that period
of damp, steamy, warm climate.

### A PUZZLE TO THE GEOLOGIST

But Nordenskiold admits that the finding of mammoth bones, etc., in the
Siberian "tundras" or immense plains of sand drifts, is a puzzle to the
orthodox geologist. For these drifts were formed quite recently, and yet
they contain remains of animals which the orthodox scientist believes to
be thousands of years old and no longer existing. He says:

"The tundra has been formed under climatical conditions very similar to
the present, which is further confirmed by the geognostic formation of
the strata. It has, therefore, long been difficult of explanation

<span id="page_227">p. 227</span>

for the geologist that just in those sandy strata is found a large
number of remains of mammoths, rhinoceroses, etc., that is to say, of
animal types which for the present live only in tropical or sub-tropical
climates. Collections from these regions have a peculiar interest from
the remarkable circumstance that in the frozen soil of the tundra are
found, not only skeletons, but also flesh, hide, hair, and entrails of
animal forms which died out many thousands of centuries ago. Among our
collections may be mentioned, large pieces of mammoth hide found along
with some fragments of bone where the Mesenkin falls into the Yenissej,
the skull of a musk-ox, remarkable for its size, found with fragments of
mammoth bones in another tundra valley south of Orlovskoj, a very rich
collection of sub-fossil shells found principally between Orlovskoj and
Gostinoi."

Now that is a very clear statement of the difficulty in which the
orthodox scientist finds himself. Here is a new formation--the
tundra--and in it he finds skins and bones and entrails of animals which
are supposed to be some thousands of centuries old. It is obvious that
they cannot be as old as that, or else they would not be there. And the
fact that parts of hides and entrails are found--not fossilized but
simply frozen--and that semi-fossilized shells are also found, shows
that the shells are older than the hides and bones. For in thousands of
centuries the hides and entrails would certainly have disintegrated and

<span id="page_228">p. 228</span>

left nothing but fossil imprints. A little later Nordenskiold says:

"Few scientific discoveries have so powerfully captivated the interest
both of the learned and unlearned as that of the colossal remains of
elephants, sometimes well preserved with hair and flesh in the frozen
soil of Siberia. Such discoveries have more than once formed the object
of scientific expeditions and careful researches by eminent men, but
there is still much that is enigmatical with respect to a number of
circumstances connected with the Mammoth period of Siberia, which
*perhaps* was contemporaneous with our Glacial period. Specially is our
knowledge of the animal and vegetable types, which lived at the same
time as the mammoth, exceedingly incomplete, although we know that in
the northernmost parts of Siberia, which are also most inaccessible from
land, there are small hills covered with the bones of the mammoth and
other contemporaneous animals. . . ."

### IN THE NEW SIBERIAN ISLAND

A little later Nordenskiold sailed for the New Siberian Islands:

"These islands are very remarkable from a scientific point of view,
being very rich in the remains of the mammoth and other animals of the
same period, which are found in greater abundance among them than on the
tundra of the mainland. Some of the sand-banks on their shores are so
full of the bones

<span id="page_224">p. 224</span>

and tusks of the mammoth that the ivory collectors who for a series of
years traveled every year from the mainland to the islands in
dog-sledges, used to return in autumn when the sea was again covered
with ice, with a rich harvest. According to Hedenstrom, the only
educated person who has examined these islands in summer, there are
besides in the interior hills which are covered with the remains of the
mammoth, the rhinoceros, horse, aurochs, bison, sheep, etc."

Special collections were made by Nordenskiold of specimens that would
aid him in determining what he admitted was a "difficult problem": how
it was possible for the progenitors of the Indian elephant to live in
the ice deserts of Siberia.

Yes the problem is difficult when you do not know all the facts, but
when we know that the mammoth still lives in the interior, then we can
easily understand the situation.

Perhaps the reader says, "But you have not actually proved that yet".
But let the reader wait until all the evidence is in. We wish to put the
matter beyond the shadow of a doubt, and so we call upon every witness
who has seen these remains, but we shall leave the most remarkable case
until the last.

### OTHER SIMILAR DISCOVERIES

In Edwin S. Grew's "The Romance of Modern Geology" we read of the
finding of mammoth remains

<span id="page_230">p. 230</span>

in France including a tusk which is carved with a rough but clever
picture of a mammoth. That proves that the animal still existed on the
outer surface of the earth when mankind had come upon the scene. Mr.
Grew also confirms the facts we have told above of the finding of the
complete mammoth in the ice by the Russian fisherman in Siberia. He adds
that Mr. Adams of the St. Petersburg Museum was sent by the Czar to
examine the carcass and found it in a still fresh condition.

He tells us that:

"The Yakuts of the neighborhood had cut off the flesh, with which they
had fed their dogs; wild beasts, such as white bears, wolves,
wolverines, and foxes had also fed upon it, and traces of their
foot-steps were seen around. The skeleton almost cleared of flesh,
remained whole, with the exception of one foreleg. The spine of the
back, one scapula, the pelvis, and other three limbs were still held
together by the ligaments and by parts of the skin; the other scapula
was found not far off. The head was covered with a dry skin; one of the
ears was furnished with a tuft of hairs; the balls of the eyes were
still distinguishable; the brain still occupied the cranium but seemed
dried up; the point of the lower lip had been gnawed and the upper lip
had been [destroyed](errata.htm#63.md) so as to expose the teeth; the neck
was furnished with a long flowing mane; the skin, of a dark-grey

<span id="page_231">p. 231</span>

color, covered with black hairs and a reddish wool, was so heavy that
ten persons found great difficulty in transporting it to shore.

### THE CARCASS OF THE MAMMOTH

"There was collected, according to Mr. Adams, more than thirty-six
pounds weight of hair and wool which the white bears had trod into the
ground while devouring the flesh. This mammoth was a male, so fat and
well fed, according to the assertion of the Tungusian chief, that its
belly hung down below the joints of its knees. Its tusks were nine feet,
six inches in length, measured along the curve, and its head without the
tusks weighed four hundred and fourteen pounds avoirdupois."

But Mr. Grew has something even more remarkable than this corroborative
testimony to tell us, and we shall quote other writers to confirm him.
He goes on in this same book to tell of:

"A very curious example of the Siberian Mammoth was discovered only a
few years ago by a Lamut of one of the Arctic Villages, and through the
energy of Dr. Herz was eventually removed in pieces to St. Petersburg. .
. . . It was sunk in frozen ground, and this cold storage treatment had
preserved it in an extraordinary manner. If the Siberian natives who had
discovered it partially buried in alluvial deposit had not uncovered it,
so that the sun was able to play on the carcass and produce

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

decay, this wonderful primeval monster might almost have been got out
whole. As it was, the frozen ground had so kept the remains that Dr.
Herz had found well-preserved fragments of food between the teeth, and
the remains of a hearty meal in the stomach. There is no doubt that the
Mammoth fell into the crevice or pit and damaged himself so much in the
fall that he could not crawl out. . . . . ."

### COULD NOT BE "PRIMEVAL"

The reader will notice that Mr. Grew refers to this mammoth as a
"primeval" monster. And that is an example of the sort of thinking that
has set all the scientists wrong on these questions regarding the polar
regions. Instead of studying the actual facts as we have done in this
book they come to the facts with certain fixed ideas in their heads, and
they can only [understand](errata.htm#64.md) as many of the facts as fit
into their ideas. Everything else they pass by as being of no
importance. The reader will see that Mr. Grew has read in his previous
studies that the mammoth was a primeval animal--which is true enough as
far as it goes. It was a very early animal, and in all the outer world
is now extinct. But when he hears of a perfectly fresh carcass being
discovered, it never occurs to Mr. Grew nor to Dr. Herz nor to
Nordenskiold nor to any other explorer, to think anything else than what
he has always thought. They still think of the animal as extinct
although its fresh carcass

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

is before them, and they try to explain the freshness of the carcass by
saying that it was preserved by the ice.

### COMES FROM WARM CLIMATE

But the mammoth and mastodon are inhabitants, as we have seen, of warm
climates, and if the animal we have just read about fell into that
crevice when he and his fellows still roamed on what must then have been
the much warmer climate of Siberia than the present one, it follows that
it was many years before the ice came and froze the animal in its grave.

We claim, it will be seen, that if these animals lived in a certain
climate--whatever the climate of Siberia happened to be in the days when
scientists claim that the mammoth lived--either one of two things must
have happened. If the climate gradually grew colder they would be driven
off by the inclemency of the change. If it did not change they would be
living in Siberia still. But there are no mammoths in Siberia now. So
they were driven somewhere by the growing cold. We claim that they took
refuge in the interior of the earth--from whence, for all science can
prove to the contrary, they may have come in the first place. We further
claim that the fresh remains of their bodies which have been found in
Siberia are those of mammoths which in their wanderings came a little
further south than usual--for the climate around the polar openings
would be quite warm enough for them, and

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

that these animals fell in to ice crevasses in places from which they
were carried to the present situations by the movements of the ice--by
those great glaciers which have from time to time been referred to in
accounts of Greenland.

### SUPPOSING THEY WERE A MILLION YEARS OLD

For consider the alternative supposition. Suppose the mammoth referred
to above had really fallen into a pit or water hole a million or so
years ago. Suppose that almost immediately afterwards the climate became
so cold that the body was frozen in; and climate never does change so
quickly. Even in that short interval the food in the stomach and between
the teeth would have decomposed. Food begins to break up the minute it
reaches the stomach and is acted on by the gastric juice. The heat and
moisture of the mouth is such that all food not washed away from the
teeth immediately after eating begins to decompose. It would not take a
pretentiously educated scientist or veteran Arctic explorer, it would
take no more scientifically equipped man than any dentist to tell that
when a carcass is found frozen with fresh food between its teeth, that
carcass was frozen either immediately after death or even frozen to
death.

### CONTRADICTIONS IN THAT VIEW

No, there is no getting away from the fact that the mammoth was alive
after the ice was formed,

<span id="page_235">p. 235</span>

and in some manner fell into a crevasse and was frozen. And the only
place the mammoth could come from to meet such a fate is the interior of
the earth, because the interior of the earth and possibly all the land
around the polar lips is the only climate in the north where he could
survive. When the Siberian climate became cold the means of escape to
the south was shut off. If it had not been, the mammoth might have
migrated south and been alive in the warmer regions today. But we have
seen that the ross-gull and other birds as well as the foxes and bears
go north when the winter sets in, and the mammoth either came from the
interior of the earth in the first place or else he sought it for a
refuge when the Siberian wilds became too cold for him.

### OTHER DISCOVERIES

Apart from that there is no explanation of these remains at all. R.
Lyddeker, a British biologist, writing in *Knowledge* for 1892 says:

"Along the borders of the Arctic Ocean for hundreds of miles mammoth
remains are met with in [incredible](errata.htm#65.md) quantities; and it
is still one of the puzzles of geology to account adequately and
satisfactorily for the manner in which these creatures perished, and how
their bodies were buried beneath the frozen soil before decomposition
had begun its work, for it is hardly possible to believe that they

<span id="page_236">p. 236</span>

lived in a climate so rigorous that their bodies would have been frozen
on the ground immediately after death."

### FREEZING INSTANTANEOUS

The same writer in *Knowledge* for 1892, tells of the many discoveries
of mammoth flesh in fresh condition and mentions that the natives of
Siberia as well as their dogs have eaten of the flesh another striking
proof of its freshness. But perhaps the most remarkable testimony of
this sort is the fact that an actual banquet has been served from the
flesh of this supposedly extinct animal. Readers may remember the
newspaper reports of that banquet, several years ago, in Petrograd, at
which the flesh of the mammoth, wheat from Egyptian tombs, and other
preserved products from the remains of Pompeii and Herculaneum were
among the items served, the idea being to serve only those things which
were thousands of years old. Unfortunately, the scientists had not gone
into the history of the mammoth as profoundly as they might, or they
would have seen the inconsistencies in their theories which we have
pointed out above. And then they would have had to omit the mammoth
steak, or at least admit that it was not as old as the other viands they
served at this scientific banquet.

But perhaps the reader is not willing to see a whole argument based on
what he may consider the one isolated example of a mammoth found with
fresh

<span id="page_237">p. 237</span>

food between its teeth. He may say one witness is not enough in an
important case like this. Very well; let us cite another witness. In
June, 1894, Dr. Stephen Bower, one of the foremost American geologists,
contributed a long article on extinct animals to the Scientific American
Supplement. Of course, like other scientists, he thought that the
mammoth was extinct, but he knew that its flesh had been eaten by
man--in fact his reference to that fact may be caused by his knowledge
of the banquet at Petrograd to which we have referred above. In any case
he begins his remarks about the mammoth as follows:

"While the monsters we have described perished many ages before man
appeared on the earth, and have never been seen by him alive, the
monster of which we are now about to write has been seen by man and its
flesh eaten by him. That, however, was after it had been entombed for
untold ages in the ice of Arctic regions. The remains of the mammoth are
widely diffused over the earth. They have been found in great abundance
not only in North America, but also in the frozen regions of Siberia,
and indeed all over Asiatic Russia. . . . As far back as the tenth
century an active trade has been carried on in fossil ivory. It is
estimated that during the past two centuries more than two hundred pairs
of fossil tusks have come into the market annually, and the localities
where found are far from being exhausted. After

<span id="page_238">p. 238</span>

more than forty thousand pairs have been obtained from northern regions
the traveler finds them increasing as he approaches toward the north
pole. It is said that the soil of Bear Island and Liachoff Island, New
Siberia, consists of sand and ice with such quantities of Mammoth
remains that they appear as if they were made up of bones and tusks."

Let us break off just a moment to remind the reader how the above
corroborates what we have said as to the greater frequency of life and
the remains of life as we approach the north polar regions--even the
mammoth bones tell the same tale as the gulls and foxes and bears.

Dr. Bowers then proceeds to verify once again the facts we have already
heard of:

"But not only have the fossil remains of the Mammoth been found all over
the arctic lands as far as man has penetrated, but their bodies, as we
have intimated, have been found intact, frozen and preserved in the ice.
In the year 1800, the entire body of a mammoth was discovered in a vast
stratum of ice on the banks of the river Lena. Afterwards it became
disengaged from its icy matrix and white bears, wolves, foxes and dogs
fed off its flesh. It was a male and had a long mane on its neck."

### ANOTHER INSTANCE

And Dr. Bowers gives once more the details which we already know. He
goes on, however, to tell of

<span id="page_239">p. 239</span>

another instance which other writers have also mentioned:

"A young Russian engineer, named Benkendorf, in the employ of his
government, ascended the Indigirka in a steamer in 1846. The season was
unusually warm for Siberia, and the country was flooded with water. The
stream, which was greatly swollen, cut new channels in many places,
melting the ice and frozen soil. In one of these newly cut channels he
discovered a mammoth in an upright position, where it had been
overwhelmed, probably thousands of years before. As its head and trunk
rose and fell with the surging waters he discovered that it was still
fastened in the ice and frozen soil by its hind feet. The monster was
secured by throwing ropes and chains over its tusks and head, and after
its hind feet were released it was safely landed by the aid of more than
fifty men and horses. It proved to be of gigantic size, and the whole
body was in a fine state of preservation. In its stomach was found the
food that had formed its last repast, which consisted of young shoots of
the fir and pine, also young fir cones. On the shoulders and along the
back grew stiff hairs about a foot long. The hair was dark brown and
coarsely rooted. Under the outer hairs there appeared everywhere a soft,
warm and thick wool of a fallow brown color."

Dr. Bowers can only account for this surprising freshness by supposing
that the freezing of the animal

<span id="page_240">p. 240</span>

was instantaneous, and his own theory is that there was a sudden change
in the climate which he puts at about the lateness of what he calls the
"[Noachian](errata.htm#66.md) deluge". But that is very unscientific, as we
know now that changes in climate are gradual, and in serious scientific
discussions it is not usual to bring in Noah and the biblical account of
the deluge. But in spite of the difficulties, Dr. Bowers makes the most
generous acknowledgement of the absolute freshness of this and other
specimens found. He even says:

"Many of the animals, as the mammoth, rhinoceros, etc., remain
undecayed. Even the capillary blood vessels still retain their contents,
showing that there was not the slightest decomposition or breaking down
of the tissues, but the catastrophe which overwhelmed them was sudden."

Of the mammoth, therefore, we have the mass of evidence cited to show
that the interior of the earth is its habitat. The scientists who have
not had this theory to work with have confessed that they cannot explain
the phenomenon. But once supply the link which our theory gives and the
whole sequence is complete. The mammoth is wandering today in the
interior of the earth. When he ventures too near the polar orifice--it
must be remembered that the mammoth and mastodon and elephant are all
characterized by a tendency to wander widely--he becomes stranded on a
breaking ice floe and carried over from the interior regions, to the
outer regions or perhaps

<span id="page_241">p. 241</span>

falls in a crevasse in ice which afterwards begins to move in some great
glacial movement. In these ways the bodies are carried over to Siberia
and left where we have seen them discovered. That such a process has
been going on for thousands of years is seen from the abundance of
remains. Evidently the migratory instinct, which does not change for
thousands of years even when the conditions which started it do change,
is still working in these animals. And so we have from time to time
their silent testimony to the existence and mild climate and vegetation
of that interior land which supports them, and which has been giving
this and other testimony for so many years without any of our learned
scientists as much as once correlating and putting together the
evidence--evidence which they alone among us have had the opportunity of
collecting but which they collected piece meal, unaware if its
importance, puzzled by it, occassionally admitting that they were
puzzled, but which they never faced squarely with minds free from
preconception. But at last all this evidence has been gathered together.
More of it will undoubtedly be forthcoming. And, not for the first time
in the history of thought, the orthodox scientists will have to admit
that they were wrong in their interpretation of the facts of polar
research, and that there is really something new to be found out.

<span id="page_242">p. 242</span>

### THE MAMMOTH BANQUETS

We have referred to the eating of mammoth flesh by scientists and their
guests at a banquet, and this evidence of the freshness of the meat of
the animal is so remarkable that our readers may well wish to know all
the details. As a matter of fact the eating of mammoth flesh by human
beings has occurred more than once according to recent reports in
newspapers, and, of course, there may be hundreds of cases among the
Eskimos or inhabitants of Siberia where some of the carcasses have been
found in a fresh condition.

The most talked about mammoth banquet was that given by Professor Herz,
of the Imperial Academy of Science of St. Petersburg--as it was
then--who had been leader of the expedition into Siberia which unearthed
and transported the mammoth in question to the Imperial Museum. Only the
bones and the skin were needed for mounting in the museum, and as the
professor had kept the whole carcass in cold storage it suddenly
occurred to him that it would be quite possible to eat the flesh. Of
course he was under the impression that this flesh was over 20,000 years
old, an idea which we have already shown to be quite wrong, and he asked
scientists in other parts of the world to contribute other ancient
foods--such as corn dug up from the ruins of Egyptian cities. As the
mammoth flesh was not old at all we need not speak of the other and
older items

of this feast. What does concern us is what the guests thought of the
meat. But the account of the banquet says that the banquet was a
triumph: "particularly the course of mammoth steak, which all the
learned guests declared was agreeable to the taste, and not much tougher
than some of the sirloin furnished by butchers of today."

Another mammoth meal was eaten by an American traveler and author, Mr.
James Oliver Curwood, who was exploring in the far north when his Eskimo
fellow travelers found the body of a mammoth exposed by the falling of a
cliff-side. Before quoting Mr. Curwood we should like to point out how
little the scientists really know about such matters by contrasting what
he gives as the animal's age with what Professor Herz gave. Herz put it
at 20,000 years; Curwood, quoted in The Chicago Tribune for July 7th,
1912, puts it at 50,000 to 100,000 years. As we have already shown, Herz
is nearer the truth than Curwood. But at that he is about 20,000 years
wrong. However, here is what Mr. Curwood has to say:

### THE FRESH MEAT

"The flesh was of a deep red or [mahogany](errata.htm#67.md) color, and I
dined on a steak an inch and a half thick. . . . The flavor of the meat
was old not unpleasant but simply old and dry. That it had lost none of
its life-sustaining elements was shown by the fact that the dogs throve
upon it."

<span id="page_244">p. 244</span>

What Mr. Curwood calls an old flavor--really there could be no such
thing any more than there could be a yellow or a blue flavor--is simply
the strong flavor due to the character of the animal. Anyone who has
eaten bear steak or even venison and contrasted the flavor with beef or
mutton will know just what Mr. Curwood is really trying to say.

But there is on record of at least one more mammoth banquet, this time
given by Gabrielle D’Annunzio from the flesh of another mammoth, the
bones of which repose in a Paris Museum. Here is part of the story as
cabled to the Chicago Examiner some years ago:

"Paris, Jan. 31--Meat between forty and fifty thousand years old was the
star dish at a banquet given by Gabriele D’Annunzio, the Italian
dramatist and poet, at the Hotel Carlton last evening.

"D’Annunzio obtained the flesh from Russia where it was cut from the
carcass of a mammoth which was dug out of the ice around the Liakoff
Islands, north of Siberia, by Count Stembock Fermer. The count has
presented the [pachyderm](errata.htm#68.md) to the Paris Museum of Natural
History, where it is about to be exhibited.

"The body embedded in the eternal ice was in perfect condition, at the
time of its discovery, a large quantity of the flesh was kept in cold
storage and shipped to St. Petersburg.

"This fifty thousand year old frozen meat is being

<span id="page_245">p. 245</span>

treasured in Russia, but after repeated efforts, D’Annunzio, through
influential friends, succeeded in obtaining several pounds of this rare
food-stuff.

### D’ANNUNZIO'S BANQUET

"Yesterday's sensational dinner was preliminary to the competition for
the Fontenoy Cup, awarded by the French Greyhound Club, of which the
poet is one of the most enthusiastic members. His guests were five
fellow members of the club and covers were also laid for the favorite
hounds of the guests. Describing the banquet afterward to the Examiner
correspondent, D’Annunzio said:

"'It was the most successful dinner I ever gave. The elephant meat
exceeded my highest expectations. In flavor it was like tortoise flesh,
but it was, well--a little tough. . . . . . I had it broiled and served
with six different kinds of sauce.'"

Of course the reader will notice that D’Annunzio like everyone else
thinks the mammoth flesh was much older than it is in this case forty
thousand years is mentioned as a possible age as well as fifty thousand.
Now what do the scientists mean by saying a thing is forty thousand
years old, then fifty thousand, and then a hundred thousand years? Does
not that mean that the whole thing is a guess? Otherwise, the man who
said it was forty thousand years old would have some reason for that
estimate and that reason ought to convince the man who says it is

<span id="page_246">p. 246</span>

fifty thousand years and him who says 100,000 years. Or else the 100,000
year old theory ought to convince the other fellows. Some of them, at
least, ought to have some actual evidence on which to base their
figures. But as there is no evidence at all, we find guesses all the way
from 20,000 to 100,000 years for the age of the mammoth and we find
nothing except these guesses, not a single cogent argument. That being
the case, it ought to be obvious that a theory such as ours, which
explains the actual facts of the case, must supplant these wild guesses.
The reason the scientists who say 20,000 or 50,000 or 100,000 years
cannot agree is that none of them is right. If any one of them were
right he would be able to convince the others by some actual proof or
argument. But as all are wrong--almost equally wrong, one might say,
although their errors differ by a few thousand years no one man can
convince the other. Our own pointing out of the actual facts in the case
at once clears away the fog and explains everything in a clear and
satisfactory manner.
