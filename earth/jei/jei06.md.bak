# CHAPTER III.

## MARS

If the theory as outlined were correct it ought to be possible to make
it more and more probable and at last prove it without a shadow of a
doubt by making closer and closer observations. We have made it sound
plausible by examining celestial bodies which are very far off--the
nebulæ. Let us now proceed to make it sound much more
reasonable--perhaps we may even be able to prove it absolutely by
applying it to the observation of a body that is much nearer us--and
therefore susceptible of much closer [observation](errata.htm#16.md)--than
the nebulæ, and that is the planet Mars. When we bring the telescope to
bear on Mars, the planet, especially its polar regions, is brought so
near that Percival Lowell has even remarked that we know more of the
Martian polar regions than we have hitherto known about our own earthly
ones. We shall observe Mars in detail then, following our observations
with a brief glance at Venus so that we may check up on what Mars shows
us. Then we shall take the final step that proves our theory up to the
hilt.

### FROM MARS TO EARTH

For there is a planet that we may inspect with even greater detail than
we can inspect Mars--and

<span id="page_66">p. 66</span>

that is our own. With the knowledge gained from inspecting Mars we can
read the answers to certain riddles of Polar exploration that have
hitherto baffled both the scientists and the explorers who found the
scientists' theories inadequate to guide them when they actually reached
polar regions. We shall then have traversed the solar universe from the
farthest nebula to the very ground under our own feet. If in that survey
we find no facts that contradict our theory but numbers of facts which
contradict every other theory; if those facts all line up and fit into
our theory and ours alone; we shall rest satisfied that we have actually
discovered the true structure of the bodies which revolve in space. And,
knowing the structure of our earth truly for the first time, it is but a
step to utilize our knowledge in ways undreamed of hitherto--but that is
to anticipate.

### A GENERAL SURVEY OF MARS

Let us first attain a general idea of the planet Mars as it is revealed
to us by the telescope and explained by the orthodox astronomers. For
this Moulton is as good a guide as anyone. In his "Introduction to
Astronomy" he gives all the necessary elementary knowledge of the
planet. Its orbit is the next beyond that of the earth--the sun being
the center, while the orbit of Venus is nearest to the earth on the
inner side. Its mass and volume are considerably less than the
earth--and it is this relative closeness to the earth in

<span id="page_67">p. 67</span>

position that has made Mars so favorite a location for those people who
speculate on the possibility of life on other planets. For they argue
that conditions on Mars should be very similar to conditions on the
earth. Mars has two small satellites, much smaller and nearer than our
moon, and the period of the rotation of the planet is about thirty-eight
minutes longer than our own day of twenty-four hours. An-other
similarity with the earth is that the inclination of the plane of the
equator to the orbit of Mars is about 24 degrees, so that its days and
seasons would be very much like those of the earth.

### THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS

Fortunately for the astronomer who wishes to observe its surface Mars
has very little atmosphere. The amount of atmosphere is calculated by
noticing--through the aid of proper apparatus and calculations--the
amount of light received by the planet and the amount reflected from it.
The ratio between those two is called the albedo. Clouds reflect more
light than earth surfaces do for the light is absorbed by the atmosphere
in part before it reaches the surface and the light reflected from the
surface is again subject to tribute by atmospheric absorption before it
gets clear from the planet and so the small amount of light reflected
from the surface of Mars shows us that it has but little atmosphere.
Other observations support this the fact, for instance, that

<span id="page_68">p. 68</span>

when a star is hidden or "occulted" by Mars there is no gradual hiding
due to a rare and then denser atmosphere intervening as the paths of
Mars and the star cross, but a sudden blotting out of the star. We lay
stress on this point here, for it is in apparent contradiction to the
phenomena of the light from the polar caps of Mars--which the older
astronomers thought were ice caps reflecting light through what must
have been an atmosphere as the light certainly rose above the surface of
the planet.

### THE CIRCULAR POLAR CAPS

In appearance Mars is a reddish planet to the naked eye, but the
telescope reveals a surface of variegated color. There are many dark
patches in the surface and they are fixed--but at each pole is a large
circular white cap which at its apparent maximum extends from 25 to 35
degrees from the pole and which diminishes in size in the spring season
until it sometimes disappears totally. But the reader should not jump to
the conclusion that that diminishing in spring indicates that the cap is
composed of snow or ice. The astronomers themselves have begun to doubt
that. For the cap does not diminish gradually as it would if it were
gradually melting ice. It does it by sudden jumps--but we shall return
to that in detail later on.

Moulton notes these facts, remarks that some of the appearances of the
caps are such as to indicate

 

<span id="img_06800"></span>

View of Mars, showing the circular white spot which is an entrance to
this planet's interior, instead of the so-called polar ice cap, thus
proving that Mars, the earth, and all other planetary bodies are hollow
and contain a central sun. (Photographed by F. A. A. Talbott, Beighton,
England.) For optical reasons all astronomical photographs are inverted.

 

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

that they might be snow, but he immediately adds that we cannot account
for the warm climate that would be necessary to cause the melting of the
caps if they really were of snow.

### THE CANALS

The next thing we notice on the surface of the planet is the so-called
system of canals. These were first seen in 1877 by Schiaparelli who
called them by the Italian word "canali" which meant not canals but
channels. As they are from twenty to sixty miles wide it is obvious that
the later English designation of canals is a little unfortunate, even
though Professor Lowell thinks that they are artificial constructions.
These channels extend along the arcs of immense circles, and measure in
length from a few hundred up to four thousand miles. Often they
intersect in dark so called "water-areas" or "lakes". Lowell claims that
the junctions of the canals are always supplied with lakes and that
there are no lakes except at the junctions of canals. In 1882
Schiaparelli discovered that many of the canals were double, two running
parallel to each other at a distance apart of 200 to 400 miles. Later
observations confirm this although the apparent doubling was found to
depend on the season. But what the canals mean Moulton does not know.
They may, he says, be due to some kind of vegetation, they may be due to
optical illusion. "The doctors disagree," Moulton

<span id="page_70">p. 70</span>

admits. That the planet's outside surface is the abode of life, as held
by Professor Lowell, has been questioned on the ground that it would be
too cold to support life. But Moulton doubts if the planet is as cold as
the application to its supposed conditions of certain mathematical
formulæ would indicate. And how uncertain the scientists are on this
point may be seen from the fact that some of them have thought the polar
caps are of snow while others have thought they consisted of frozen
carbon dioxide gas which only solidifies at 109 degrees
[Fahrenheit](errata.htm#17.md).

### NO ADVANCE IN KNOWLEDGE OF THE PLANET

In his "Descriptive Astronomy" written six years later than the book we
have just been referring to, in 1912, Moulton has no advance to record
in knowledge of the planet. Again he points out that the small amount of
water on the planet would render the polar ice cap theory untenable. And
if there were water, he adds, it is not at all certain that it would be
raised in clouds, transferred from one region to another, and
precipitated as snow. Mars only receives from the sun less than half the
amount of light and heat that the earth does, and so its temperature is
much less than that at which snow would alternately form and melt, and
to the suggestion that it is frozen carbon-dioxide that forms the polar
cap, Mr. Moulton opposed the fact that carbon-dioxide in an atmosphere,
by its absorptive power, tends to

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

produce a high mean temperature, and so would prevent any such
phenomenon as the freezing of a gas at the poles. And so Moulton
concludes:

"At the present time we are not, justified in drawing any positive
conclusion about the meaning of the polar cap or the climatic condition
of Mars."

### SOME NEW FACTS

Such is the general impression of Mars and our knowledge about it that
is gained from elementary text-hooks and that was once held by all
astronomers. But there are some curious facts that do not seem to have
been noted by Moulton before he wrote these two books or if noted they
did not seem to him to be important--and these facts are at once very
important and easily explained in the light of the present theory. Let
us, therefore, see what those writers have to say who deal more in
detail with this one planet.

E. Walter Maunder, F. R. A. S., in his little book, "Are the Planets
Inhabited?" goes into some details regarding the presence of water on
the planet. He puts the question whether the so-called canals are
artificial or natural formations. If they are artificial it would
certainly seem as if some intelligent inhabitants had made them for a
purpose, and as they wax and wane with the seasons it would seem as if
Lowell were right when he claimed that what we saw when they waxed in
the spring was the mass of vegetation

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

growing by means of their irrigation, while the drying up of the
vegetation in the winter would signalize the fact that the water supply
had given out. On the other hand if we found them to be not artificially
created canals at all, then Lowell's theory of the utilization of water
from the poles would be invalidated, and we would be left just where
Moulton's two books left us--in sheer ignorance of the whole matter.

But Mr. Maunder has a lot to urge against Professor Lowell's theory.
Mars, he tells us, is much more like the moon in its conditions than it
is like the earth. After studying in detail the temperature of Mars, Mr.
Maunder concludes:

"The size of Mars taught us that we have in it a planet with an
atmosphere of but one half the density of that prevailing on the top of
our highest mountain; the distance of Mars from the sun showed us that
it may have a mean temperature close to that of freezing mercury. What
chance would there be for life on a world the average condition of which
would correspond to that of a terrestrial mountain top, ten miles high
and in the heart of the polar regions? But Mars, in the telescope, does
not look like a cold planet. As we look at it and note its bright color,
the small extent of the white caps presumed to be snow, and the high
latitudes in which the dark markings--presumed to be water or
vegetation--are seen, it seems difficult to suppose that the mean
temperature is lower than that of the earth.

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

In the summer, the white polar caps of Mars diminish to a far greater
extent than the snow and ice caps of the Earth; indeed, one of the
Martian caps has been known to disappear completely.

### GREAT EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURE

The contradiction between this calculated very low mean temperature and
the observations he has just made, Mr. Maunder finds in the fact that
the extremes of temperature are very great on Mars. The maximum
temperature of the planet, he thinks, is above the freezing point of
water, but normally the water on the planet is frozen: "Mars is
essentially a frozen planet; and the extremes of cold experienced there,
not only every year but every night, far transcend the bitterest
extremes of our own polar regions."

For that reason, he says, it is very unlikely that there is any
vegetation on Mars, except possibly some of the very lowest type. But
here is a very interesting point regarding the patches that have been
thought to be water:

"Some of the so-called seas may possibly be of the latter class
(stretches of vegetation) but that there must be expanses of water on
the planet is clear, for if there were no water surfaces there would be
no evaporation; and if there were no evaporation, from whence would come
the supply of moisture that builds up the winter pole cap?"

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

"But we thought astronomers had given up the idea that the polar caps
could be proved to be of snow," the reader may exclaim.

### ASTRONOMERS ARE CONFUSED

Well, the quotation just given shows the confusion on the subject in the
minds of the orthodox astronomers. For right after saying that, Mr.
Maunder quotes Professor Newcomb as remarking:

"There is no evidence that snow like ours ever formed around the poles
of Mars. It does not seem possible that any considerable fall of such
snow could take place, nor is there any necessity of supposing actual
snow or ice to account for the white caps."

But Professor Newcomb does not go as far as the reader is, perhaps,
expecting him to go. For snow he only substitutes a hoar-frost formed of
extremely fine particles of water vapor (how, in such a low temperature
they came to be vaporized and brought to the pole before re-freezing, he
does not say.) And after quoting that, Mr. Maunder himself says, a
little later on, that Mars is always a frozen planet, frozen except on
its mere surface when this is exposed to the full rays of the sun.

In other words the surface of the planet would be more or less uniformly
bright if this were the case. Certainly hoar-frost at the poles would
not be such a different surface from all the rest of the planet as to
give us the characteristic appearance of the polar

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

caps; and those caps would never disappear by whole-sale bounds as they
have been observed to do in actual fact.

No, the astronomers who try to theorize on the basis of polar snow caps
are simply getting themselves into logical trouble.

In his book entitled "Mars", Lowell says, in presenting a map of what he
thinks is the "ice cap" of the southern Martian pole:

"It will be seen from it how much farther advanced is our knowledge of
the Martian south pole and the regions about it than is our knowledge of
either of our own."

What a significant admission that is, and not so much out of date at the
present time as most people imagine who have taken all their knowledge
of our earthly poles at second hand and never examined into it.

An English astronomer, E. S. Grew, in his text book, "The Growth of a
Planet," remarks that polar conditions on Earth and on Mars cannot be
compared because the meteorological conditions are quite different in
the two planets.

But supposing what we see can be explained only by conditions which are
not meteorological? Then the two planets, perhaps, can be compared. It
is because our theory points to something permanent in the structure of
the planet as the explanation of polar phenomena, and not to mere
meteorological

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

changes, that we can compare the two planets and show similar agencies
at work on each of them, testifying to a structure which is the same in
the one as in the other--and as in all others indeed.

But let us turn to an observation of Professor Lowell of the utmost
value. On page 86 of his book, "Mars", Professor Lowell records:

"Meanwhile an interesting phenomenon [occurred](errata.htm#18.md) in the
cap on June 7 (this was in 1894). On that morning at about a quarter to
six (or, more precisely, on June 8, 1 hour, 17 minutes, G. M. T.), as I
was watching the planet, I saw suddenly two points like stars flash out
in the midst of the polar cap. Dazzlingly bright upon the duller white
background of the snow, these stars shone for a few moments and then
slowly disappeared. The seeing at the time was very good. It is at once
evident that the other-world apparitions were--not the fabled signal
lights of the Martian folk, but the glint of ice-slopes flashing for a
moment earthward as the rotation of the planet turned the slope to the
proper angle. . . . But though no intelligence lay behind the action of
these lights they were none the less startling for being Nature's own
flash-lights across one hundred million miles of space."

These star-like points had, however, been seen before, and Lowell goes
on to check up his observations with those of others:

"Calculation showed the position of the star points

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

to be in longitude 280 degrees and 290 degrees, and in latitude 76
degrees south. At this place on the planet then there was a range of
slopes sufficiently tilted to reflect the sun from their ice-clad sides.
On comparing its position with Green's map of his observations upon the
cape of ([Madeira](errata.htm#19).md) in 1877, it appeared that this was
the identical position of the spot where he had seen star-points then,
and where Mitchell had seen them in 1846, to whom they had suggested the
same conclusion. Green Christened them the 'Mitchell Mountains.' At the
time both these observers saw them, they were detached from the rest of
the cap. We shall see that they eventually became islands, just as Green
saw them, and that the observation in June marked an earlier stage in
their history."

Now it is important to note in the above exactly what was seen--far more
important, to do that than to pass it over and listen to Lowell's ideas,
merely, about what he saw. And the definite thing that Lowell plainly
saw, and was astonished by, and specifically mentioned, was "two points
like stars flash out in the midst of the polar cap."

And let us also note that Green saw, many years earlier, two spots and
that Mitchell saw, as far back as 1846, something similar but with a
difference--which we shall come to presently. But meanwhile let us see
how inadequate is Professor Lowell's explanation of what he saw--so that
we may keep distinct

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

the actual thing and the mere theory which was made up to account for
it.

In the first place, Edward S. Morse, in his "Mars and Its Mystery", a
book which warmly supports Lowell's theories about life on Mars, on page
138, tells of photographs taken by Professor Pickering of the polar
regions of Mars in which a vast area of white appeared around the pole
in the amazingly short space of twenty four hours. In that time an area
nearly as large as the United States was visible as a white cap, and
then it gradually disappeared.

And yet Professor Lowell asks us to believe--if this is really ice at
the poles that it is so permanent that two very steep slopes--so steep
as to reflect light direct to Earth--should keep their size and shape
and positions from 1846, when Mitchell saw them, until the present day.
And we remember, also, Professor Newcomb's explanation that there is no
snow or ice at the Martian poles but only immensely fine hoar frost
which could not possibly pile up into steep cliffs and reflect light to
us in the way described. And even Professor Lowell himself, in his other
book, "Mars as the Abode of Life," admits that it would be very hard to
prove that the polar caps were composed of snow or hoar-frost, and that
he could not have--to his satisfaction proved it if it had not been that
around the polar area was to be seen a band of dark blue which he took
to be water from the melting ice of the snow-cap (page 81). But

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

later on in the same book he speaks (page 140) of the well-known total
disappearance of the one cap and the almost entire extinction of the
other, showing how each summer melts what the winter had deposited, and
that in both cases that is nearly the sum total of the cap.

But if both caps are thus depleted by each summer, how could a great ice
cliff--again we ask the same question--remain since 1846 to reflect to
us the light that Lowell saw?

No, there are too many contradictions there. Ice cliffs, if they formed
in the polar regions of Mars, would form at so many different angles and
in so many different relative positions that flashes would be constantly
sent over to us: There would be a display as continuous as that of
heliograph signaling. As a matter of fact, what Lowell really did see
was a direct beam two direct beams at the same moment flashing from the
central sun of Mars out through the [aperture](errata.htm#20.md) of the
Martian pole does not the blue rim around that area to which Lowell has
referred indicate the optical appearance of the reflecting surface of
the planet gradually curving over to the interior so that at a certain
part of the curve it begins to cease reflecting the light?--and the fact
that it is not seen often simply shows that it is only when Mars is in a
certain position with relation to the earth that we are able to
penetrate the

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

mouth of the polar opening and catch the direct beam.

### BEAM OF LIGHT WAS YELLOW

That it was a direct beam of light that Lowell saw, and not mere
reflection may easily be proved. He particularly said, in writing about
his discovery, that the light from the Martian cap was yellow when it
was viewed at night. What does that imply?

The reader can best answer after making a simple observation. Let him go
out any night and look into a lighted window from a distance. The flood
of light coming from the window will be yellow. The reader will also
find that all artists paint lighted windows seen through the night as
being yellow. We may go close up to the window and see that the source
of the light is an incandescent electric light bulb which may be
dazzlingly white and yet the light at a little distance is just as
yellow as if the window were illuminated with yellow-flamed candles.

Also the reader may try something else. Let him, after looking at the
window from a short distance, as we have suggested, move away to one
side, so that he no longer looks directly into the window, but sees it
from a very great angle. The light from the window will then be seen to
extend out beyond the window to a certain extent.

We may now apply this to Mars. It proves that the light from the polar
region of Mars is a direct

 

<span id="img_08000"></span>

[![Views of Mars](tn/08000.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/08000.jpg.md)  
  

Views of Mars taken at the Yerkes observatory, Sept. 28, 1902, showing
the white circle or so-called snow-cap, projected beyond the planet's
surface, which precludes all possibility of its being snow or ice.

 

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

illuminant from within the planet, because that light, seen at night, is
yellow. Any other sort of light, a reflection from a snowy surface, for
instance, or a reflection from sand or mountain surfaces, would be
white.

And if the reader will refer to our photograph of Mars on [page
80](#img_08000.md) he will notice that the light from the polar openings
extends in a spreading mist of luminosity of a very definite form which
cannot be mistaken and which is obviously many miles above the surface
of the planet. Now let the reader compare that with what he saw when he
looked through the night at a lighted window at an angle it is the same
sort of extension of light. So that again proves that the Martian light
is coming from a direct source and illuminating the section of the
Martian atmosphere just above the polar opening.

### BRILLIANT LIGHT FROM POLAR CAPS

Mitchell, whom Lowell quotes in the above extract, has some very
interesting points to make. He speaks of the brilliant light of the
polar caps a light more brilliant than that of the other surfaces which
are supposed to be covered with ice. Then comes his description of the
beam of light which we hold to come direct from the central sun of Mars:

"On the evening of the 30th of August (1845), I observed, for the first
time, a small bright spot, nearly or quite round, projecting out of the
lower side of

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

the polar spot. In the early part of the evening the small bright spot
seemed to be partly buried in, the large one. . . . . After the lapse of
an hour or more, my attention was again directed to the planet, when I
was astonished to find a manifest change in the position of the small
bright spot. . . . . In the course of a few days the small spot
gradually faded from the sight and was not seen at any subsequent
observation."

### COMPARING THESE OBSERVATIONS

It will be noticed that Lowell speaks as if what he saw was the same
gleam and glint that Green saw, and the same thing that Mitchell saw.
But if it were really a permanent ice-cliff, why did Lowell and Green
see the two flashes and Mitchell one flash? And why did something so
permanent that both Green and Lowell saw it many years apart, why did it
prove so impermanent when Mitchell saw it? Why was it only one gleam
then, and not two, and why did it fade away?

### A GLEAM FROM CENTRAL SUN OF MARS

Obviously it was a gleam from the central sun of Mars that Mitchell saw,
and the reason it faded was because cloudy weather gradually obscured
the interior atmosphere of Mars. And when Green and Lowell saw it a
small cloud had passed over the face of the interior sun and that broke
the gleam into two [projecting](errata.htm#21.md) beams with this opacity
between them,

so that to Lowell two separated parts of the area of the Martian sun
were visible and each sent its rays of light direct into his telescope.

### OBSERVATIONS VERSUS EXPLANATIONS

It is very interesting to read Lowell's account of these observations
and to note how his observations all fit into one another and are
accurate and how his explanations fail to account really for what he
sees. In this same part of his book, "Mars", he speaks of a fellow
observer, Mr. Douglass, who detected "rifts" in the cap--which sounds
suspiciously as if this observer has seen clouds in the interior of the
planet passing across the face of the polar opening. And Lowell adds,
"On June 13 I noticed that behind the bright points the snow (he calls
it) fell off shaded to this rift" which again sounds as if clouds were
gathering near the bright spots. He continues:

"Bright spots continued to be seen at various points to the westward
round the cap. . . . . Throughout these days the cap was wont to appear
shaded on the terminator side."

The last sentence surely suggests that cloud formations were coming into
the field of view and that wherever they thinned the bright spots from
the central sun could be seen between them.

We may note, in passing, that Proctor, the English astronomer, also
refers, in his "Other Worlds than Ours," to the brightness of the polar
regions although

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

he does not have the correct explanation of it.

That more attention should be paid to this brightness of the polar
regions of Mars, is emphasized by an English astronomer, W. E. Denning,
who contributed to the English scientific periodical, Nature, an article
on the physical appearance of the planet from observations made in 1886.
He says:

"During the past few months the north polar cap of Mars has been very
bright, sometimes offering a startling contrast to those regions of the
surface more feebly reflective. . . These luminous regions of Mars
require at least as much careful investigation as the darker parts, for
it is probably in connection with them that physical changes (if at
present operating on the planet's surface) may be definitely observed.
In many previous drawings and descriptions of Mars, sufficient weight
has not been accorded to these white spots."

Earlier writers, however, had noticed that the spots were brighter than
the other surfaces of Mars, an astronomer, writing in the Scientific
American Supplement as early as 1879, in effect, having made that
observation. But this writer was not aware of the real nature of the
light. In 1892 the celebrated English astronomer, J. Norman Lockyer,
repeated in a periodical a number of [observations](errata.htm#22.md) he
had made thirty years before and had then communicated to the Royal
Astronomical Society of England. Here is a significant quotation:

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

"The snow-zone was at times so bright that, like the crescent of the
young moon, it appeared to project beyond the planet's limb. This effect
of irradiation was frequently visible; on one occasion the snow spot was
observed to shine like a nebulous star when the planet itself was
obscured by clouds, a phenomenon noticed by Messrs. Beer and Madler,
recorded in their valuable work, '*Fragments sur les Corps Celestes*.'
The brightness, however, seemed to vary very considerably, and at times,
especially when the snow zone was near its minimum, it was by no means
the prominent object it generally is upon the planet's disc."

### A DIRECT SOURCE OF LIGHT

No one who reads the above in the light of our theory can fail to see
how it fits into it. A snow cap would not reflect light with so much
more vividness than the other surfaces of the planet, and only direct
beams of light coming from a central sun could give that luminous effect
above the surface of the planet and varying as the atmosphere in the
interior or above it was clouded or clear. Had it been a mere ice cap
there would not have been this luminosity and, in particular, there
would have been no luminosity when the planet was covered with clouds as
Lockyer says it was. Furthermore, that luminosity is precisely what our
own aurora borealis would look like if our planet was viewed from a
great distance. And the light is the same in both cases.

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

From that early date we jump to 1905 and find Percival Lowell again
telling of a bright white "kernel" which he observed at the Southern end
of the Martian north polar cap.

That, then, is the situation. All the evidence points to the fact that
it is light, and direct light at that, that causes what we have called
the Martian ice-caps but which we ought to call the Martian polar
openings. But perhaps the reader is still not convinced. He may recall
that the writers who treat this aspect of Mars, whether or not they
[believe](errata.htm#23.md) in the "canals" seem to have no doubt of the
fact that at the poles we have snow or ice. We have already pointed out
some inconsistencies in this view. Here are some other considerations
that help to dispel that idea, and then, by turning to the planet Venus,
we shall demonstrate absolutely that the polar circles are not snow, or
ice, or even hoar-frost caps, but simply [apertures](errata.htm#24.md)
leading to the inner and illuminated surface of the planet.

### WATER VAPOR IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF MARS

A writer, evidently well posted, in the New York Sun, in 1909, summed up
the arguments for and against the canal theory and the
water-determination theories of Mars, and came to these conclusions:

"If the water vapor in the Martian atmosphere is sufficient in amount to
yield an ice cap at the polar bright spots, the tension over the rest of
the planet

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

must be such that canals will not be needed because of a sufficient
precipitation; if the water vapor content is so slight that the polar
caps are nothing but frost, no amount of engineering skill could cope
with the tension which would evaporate whatever water may have started
in the canals. Under terrestrial conditions these two extremes are well
represented by the Hudson which never runs dry, and those rivers of the
arid VVest which are greatest at the source and dwindle on their course
until they end in a damp spot with bone-dry edges."

By the tension, of course, is meant the proportion of water vapor in the
atmosphere which determines, in relation to the temperature, the amount
of evaporation that will go on.

### THE SPECTRUM OF MARTIAN LIGHT

This same writer goes on to tell how the spectroscope was invoked to
solve the problem:

"Fortunately we are not without appliances which may deal with this
fundamental problem. The spectroscope yields a record of every sort of
light which it dissolves, and the bands corresponding to water vapor
have all been plotted on the spectrum. If these hands show at all, it is
[irrefragable](errata.htm#25.md) evidence of the presence of water vapor,
and in like manner the pronouncement of their definition gives a measure
of the amount of such water vapor. If then, comparative observations are
made simultaneously of an

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

illuminated object whose water vapor content is well established and of
Mars, in which it is yet to establish that factor, the comparison of the
bands in the two spectra will give a measure of the results in Mars.

"At the very favorable opposition in September (1909), the whole
resource of the Lick Observatory staff was devoted to making this
comparison.

"In order to avoid as much as possible of the water vapor content of the
earth's atmosphere, greatest in its lowest levels, the observing station
was equipped on the summit of Mount Whitney in the Sierras at an
elevation of 14,501 feet and in a horizon markedly arid

"For purposes of the astronomical comparison the moon was taken as the
standard. A long series of eclipse observations has shown that whatever
atmosphere may persist about our satellite is optically
[indiscernible](errata.htm#26.md). Similar series of spectroscopic
observations have shown that the water vapor at the moon is wholly
inappreciable by the most delicate tests. If the spectrum of Martian
light photo-graphed under the same terrestrial conditions shows no more
water vapor bands than appear in the photographed spectrum of lunar
light the conclusion is warrantable that water vapor on Mars is of such
extreme tenuity as not to be made available for cultural purposes.

"The complete results of the Mount Whitney

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

observations have not yet been worked out, but Director Campbell
authorizes the preliminary report that the comparison of a simultaneous
Martian and lunar spectra proves that Mars has no more water about it
than has the moon. He is concerned in the determination of this one fact
in physics. The rest follows in its train of inexorable logic. If Mars
has no more water than the moon the polar bright areas cannot be ice,
snow, or hoar-frost; the most reasonable suggestion is that they are
solidified carbon dioxide, the heaviest constituent of an atmosphere and
the longest to linger over a dead world, itself a mantle of death and
the shroud of animal life."

### POLAR CAPS NOT CARBON-DIOXIDE

Now we are very grateful to this writer for his account of actual
observations--in which we heartily concur--but in spite of the eloquence
of his closing thoughts--no longer observations, the reader will notice,
but mere speculation--we cannot follow him. We fear that his eloquent
periods are here wasted, for if the reader remembers what we said a few
pages back it is quite impossible that carbon dioxide is the constituent
of the poles. For that constituent twinkles, glints, and again is
clouded over--it can be nothing else than an aperture giving out light
from a central sun and ever and anon clouded over. For whether there is
water vapor on the exterior of Mars or not, there is certainly water

vapor on the inside. It is this water vapor that causes the interior
clouds that have been observed to cut off the light of the interior sun.
It is this sun itself that sends those periodical messages--glints of
direct light that could never come from an inert mass of frozen
carbon-dioxide or from a thin film of hoar-frost that is said to
evaporate.

### HOW THE ASTRONOMERS ARE MISLED

And let the reader note how this fundamentally false idea of the
structure of the planet is misleading the orthodox astronomers all the
time. Starting from a wrong basis they naturally attain to wrong
results, and so instead of all their theories and observations fitting
into one another and leading them nearer and nearer to agreement until
they come together in the recognition of the truth, they cannot agree on
a single thing. First, they tell us the temperature of Mars is
relatively high, then it is so low that carbon dioxide freezes at the
poles--in spite of the fact that at certain seasons of the year the
poles of Mars are the warmest part of the planet--and then we are told
that there is vegetation on the planet and again that there could not be
because there is no water and so on in a continual disagreement which
widens with the lapse of time and the procession of the arguments
instead of decreasing as it would if the astronomers were on the right
track.

But if the growing and declining of the alleged

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

polar ice-caps be interpreted as due to a melting and freezing of either
water or carbon dioxide, how do those who hold to the idea explain the
polar caps of Venus and Mercury?

### CORROBORATIVE FACTS FROM VENUS

Let us take Venus first. It is our nearest neighbor on the side nearer
the sun, just as Mars is on the side farther from the sun. It is
slightly less than the earth in size and has almost the same length of
day.

F. W. Henkel, an English astronomer, writing in *The English Mechanic
and World of Science*, remarks that:

"When Venus is near the sun, distinct evidence of the existence of an
extensive atmosphere, twice as dense as our own, is obtained, and the
spectroscope shows the presence of water vapor in some abundance. The
dark portion of the planet's disc (that turned away from the sun) is
occasionally seen faintly illuminated, (says Professor Young), recalling
the aurora and other electrical manifestations on earth."

We shall have a good deal more to say about the aurora later on but for
the moment we must let that point pass.

To continue Mr. Henkel's summary:

"The distance of Venus from the sun is only about three-quarters that of
the earth, or about 67,000,000 miles, so that any area of its surface
must receive about twice the amount of light and heat that an

<span id="page_92">p. 92</span>

equal area on the earth receives; but as we have already said, the
presence of a more extensive atmosphere may to 'a considerable extent
mitigate this, to our ideas, excessive amount."

And yet the author of this article immediately goes on to quote
Professor Young to the effect that "air, water, lands, continents,
mountains, polar snows, etc., all seem to be present."

Polar snows in a sun-drenched planet? That seems curious, and we begin
to inquire what other astronomers have to say in the matter.

Not only does H. W. Warren, in his "Recreations in Astronomy," speak of
the fact that the tropic zones of Venus extend nearly to the poles--on
account of the great inclination of the axis of the planet's
rotation--but a later authority, E. Walter Maunder, in his very
authoritative book, "Are the Planets Inhabited?", has this to say--after
describing the temperatures on the planet--about the climate of Venus:

"Here then is the sufficient explanation why the topography of Venus is
concealed. The atmosphere will always be abundantly charged with
water-vapor, and an almost unbroken screen of clouds will be spread
throughout its upper regions. Such a screen will greatly protect the
planet from the full scorching of the sun, and tend to equalize the
temperature of day and night, of summer and winter, of equator and
poles. The temperature range will be slight, and there will be no wide
expanses of polar ice."

<span id="page_93">p. 93</span>

### POLAR CAPS OF VENUS AND MARS OUGHT TO HAVE SAME EXPLANATION

When we think of that, especially in consideration with the statement
that the polar markings of Venus have never been seen to contract and
expand at different times, it is obvious that these marks at the poles,
in the case of Venus, are nothing less than the apertures through which
light streams from a central sun.

But the astronomers, lacking this explanation, are hard put to it to
account for what they see. On general principles one would imagine that
similar phenomena should always be explained by similar causes. If, for
instance, you once see an eclipse of the moon, and its cause is
explained to you, you will at once recognize the next time you see an
eclipse, that the same cause is at work. You would laugh at anyone who
said that one eclipse was caused by the shadow of the earth being thrown
on the moon, another eclipse by the flight of a huge body between the
earth and the moon, and so on.

Yet the astronomers observing apertures at the poles of Mars explain
them in one way when they observe similar apertures at the poles of
Venus--they ought to explain those in the same manner. But they cannot
do it, for they have postulated frozen water or frozen carbon dioxide as
the cause of the polar caps of Mars, and they know there is nothing like
that on Venus. So what do they say? Let

<span id="page_94">p. 94</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Hector MacPherson answer in his book on "The
Romance of Modern Astronomy":

"Polar caps", he says, in his chapter on Venus, "have been observed,
supposed by some to be some-what similar to those on our own planet and
on Mars. Some astronomers, however, do not regard them as snow; the
drawings of [Schiaparelli](errata.htm#27.md) represent them as separated by
a dark shadow, which suggests that they represent two mighty mountain
systems."

### MACPHERSON'S EXPLANATION INADEQUATE

Before going on to a very remarkable observation, we may be permitted to
criticize this idea in more than one way. In the first place, as we have
said, it is absurd to explain one thing--a polar cap or area--by
invoking snow in one planet or an open polar sea, and in another planet
mountains. Why should mountains on Venus imitate a polar ice cap on
Mars, or an ice cap on Mars look like and be placed just like a mountain
range on Venus? It is scientific lunacy to argue in any such fashion.
And we may be permitted to say also that Mr. MacPherson's language is
too vague here. Is he trying to say that each so-called "mountain range"
is separated from the surrounding surface of the planet by a shadow, or
does he mean that one dark mountain range is separated from the other by
a darker shadow--which in that case would lie all over the planet? We
hope that nothing said in this book is said in such a manner

<span id="page_95">p. 95</span>

as will leave the reader in doubt as to which of two possible things we
may mean.

But to follow Mr. MacPherson a little further. He quotes a French
astronomer, Trouvelet, who in 1878, found the polar spots distinctly
visible:

"Their surface," he wrote, "is irregular, and seems like a confused mass
of luminous points, separated by comparatively sombre intervening
spaces. This surface is undoubtedly very broken, and resembles that of a
mountainous district studded with numerous peaks, or our polar regions
with numerous ice-needles brilliantly reflecting the sunshine."

Our readers will at once recognize those luminous points for what they
are gleams from the central sun. Trouvelet, not knowing this, involves
himself in a mass of error in trying to explain what he saw. It is
obvious that he observed the polar aperture during very cloudy weather
and the gleams from the central sun were just struggling through the
clouds at various points--he saw those and what he took to be sombre
mountain masses were really the cloud banks through which the beams were
breaking and which, of course, looked very sombre by contrast. It could
not have been anything else, for, as we have just seen, the cloudy
atmosphere of Venus, which is dense and never lifted, would never permit
any light from the sun or other outer source to reach the surface and be
reflected as this French astronomer assumes it was. And even if the
light could reach the

<span id="page_96">p. 96</span>

polar cap of Venus it is admitted that that polar cap is not made of ice
and so there would be no such ice-like reflection as the astronomer
describes.

Here again we have a case in which the observed facts are explained by
our theory, in which no other theory can be made to explain them, and in
which, lacking our theory, the astronomers confusedly contradict each
other when they try to reduce what they see to any rational explanation.

### PROFESSOR PROCTOR ON MERCURY

And just to show the reader how universally our theory works, let us
refer to another planet on which observations can be made of the polar
openings. It is Mercury--the planet which is so near the sun that it
circles around it in eighty-eight days. Of this planet Richard A.
Proctor, one of the best known astronomers of the nineteenth century,
says:

"It may be mentioned in passing that one phenomenon of Mercury, if real,
might fairly be regarded as indicating Vulcanian energies compared with
which those of our own earth . . . . would be as the puny forces of a
child compared with the energies of a giant. It has been supposed that a
certain bright spot seen in the black disc of Mercury when the planet is
in transit, indicates some sort of illumination either of the surface of
the planet or in its atmosphere. In its atmosphere it can scarcely be;
nor could any auroral streamers on Mercury be supposed

<span id="page_97">p. 97</span>

to possess the necessary intensity of lustre. If the surface of Mercury
were glowing with the light thus supposed to have been seen, then it can
readily be shown that over hundreds of thousands of square miles, that
surface must glow with an intensity of lustre compared with which the
brightness of the lime-light would be as darkness. In fact, the
lime-light is absolute blackness compared with the intrinsic lustre of
the sun's surface; and the bright spot supposed to belong to Mercury has
been seen when the strongest darkening-glasses (or other arrangements
for reducing the sun's light) have been employed. But there can be no
manner of doubt that the bright spot is an optical phenomenon only."

### JUST LIKE SUNLIGHT

Again we agree with the observation but not with the inference. Here is
a spot of light, plainly seen through a telescope, so bright that the
observer compares it to the [incandescence](errata.htm#28.md) of a sun. It
is a much brighter light than any mere reflection could possibly give.
But we must remember that to Proctor such an appearance must have been
staggering in the extreme. He was not only not expecting it but he was
utterly unprepared to see such a phenomenon. And so he is utterly unable
to explain it. And it is a safe rule that when you cannot explain a
thing you can make what looks like an explanation by giving the thing
another name. So Proctor calls this

<span id="page_98">p. 98</span>

light "an optical phenomenon only." Well of course, it is an optical
phenomenon, but why does he say "only?" Everything we see is an optical
phenomenon, but we usually try to explain the optical phenomena. A man
who saw optical phenomena that were without explanation or cause would
be in a very dubious position. People would say he was "seeing
things"--and their meaning would not be complimentary. But we cannot
assume that Proctor's eyes had played him a trick. He was a trained
astronomical observer. So what he saw must have had some explanation or
cause behind it. He cannot have seen a "myth" as he himself asserts.

Now it is obvious to us that what he saw was the central sun of Mercury
beaming directly through the polar aperture, and as Mercury is a small
planet the interior sun would be rather near the aperture, certainly
there would not be an aqueous atmosphere with clouds to darken its
beams, and so that sun would shine with exceeding brightness. And it is
notable that their beams did put Proctor in mind of the beams from the
sun that shines in our heavens upon all the planets.

What more could be wanted than this to show that Mercury as well as the
other planets has a central sun, that such a sun is to be met with
universally?

Is it not significant that beginning with observations on Mars we are
able to go on to Venus and

<span id="page_99">p. 99</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Mercury, apply the same tests, and get the same
results? The tests, direct observation or photographic observation. The
results, the invariable appearance of a central sun.
