# CHAPTER XIX.

## HOW OUR THEORY DIFFERS FROM THAT OF SYMMES

Some very unintelligent readers have accused us of putting forward a
theory that is not new but merely a rehash of Symmes theory of
Concentric Spheres. To show how utterly foolish and misguiding this idea
is, we shall give a short account of Symmes' Theory from the one
authoritative text book in which it has been recorded, and we shall then
briefly [recapitulate](errata.htm#99.md) the main features of our own
theory. And the reader will see that they are so far apart that there is
no excuse whatever for confusing the two.

### UNLIKE IN METHOD AND IN RESULT

The very first article of Symmes' shows how widely different it is from
ours, and shows also how it is even worked out by another method of
thinking than ours. We take the facts first and ask what they teach us.
Symmes deduces his theory from what he thinks is a universal principle,
and then gives us a few facts to back it up. But here is the first
article in the Symmes creed:

### HIS CONCENTRIC SPHERES

"According to Symmes' theory the earth, as well as all the celestial
orbicular bodies existing in the

<span id="page_359">p. 359</span>

universe, visible and invisible, which partake in any degree of a
planetary nature, from the greatest to the smallest, from the sun down
to the most minute blazing meteor or falling star, are all constituted,
in a greater or less degree, of a collection of spheres, more or less
solid, concentric with each other, and more or less open at their poles;
each sphere being separated from its adjoining compeers by space replete
with aerial fluids; that every portion of infinite space, except what is
occupied with spheres, is filled with an aerial elastic fluid, more
subtle than common atmospheric air; and constituted of innumerable small
concentric spheres, too minute to be visible to the organ of sight
assisted by the most perfect microscope, and so elastic that they
continually press on each other, and change their relative positions as
often as the position of any piece of matter in space may change its
situation: thus causing a universal pressure, which is weakened by the
intervention of other bodies. . ."

### HIS OWN IDEA ABOUT GRAVITY

Well, we need not quote any further from that because Symmes here goes
off into a theory of his own regarding the law of gravity; but we should
like to point out that what he says above is very different from
anything we have ever said. Let the reader notice that although his
concentric spheres are "more or less solid" still they have open polar
orifices, which are however, only "more or less open" again. Thus

<span id="page_360">p. 360</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Symmes is very indefinite about the real
constitution of his planets. And the reader will also notice that he
includes the sun of our own solar system and all other suns as being
built in the same way. But how could a sun whose structure is the same
as the planets, and which must, therefore, be like the planets in age as
well as in other characteristics how could such a sun have enough heat
to warm all the planets? We know by actual observation of our own sun
that the heat on its surface is so great as to vaporize the solid
elements and even make the gaseous elements incandescent. In such a sun
all concentric spheres would be melted down. Such a constitution is
impossible. And yet people compare Symmes's theory to our own theory and
say they are the same.

### FIVE HOLLOW SPHERES FORM HIS EARTH

The exposition of Symmes' theory from which we are quoting goes on to
describe his idea of the form of the earth:

"According to him, the planet which has been designated the Earth is
composed of at least five hollow concentric spheres, with spaces between
each, an atmosphere surrounding each; and habitable as well upon the
concave as the convex surface. The north polar opening of the sphere we
inhabit is believed to be about four thousand miles in diameter, and the
southern about six thousand. The planes of these polar openings are
inclined to the plane of the ecliptic

<span id="page_361">p. 361</span>

at an angle of about twenty degrees; so that the real axis of the earth,
being perpendicular to the plane of the equator, will form an angle of
twelve degrees with a line passing through the sphere at right angles
with the plane of the polar openings; consequently the verge of the
polar openings must approach several degrees nearer to the equator on
one side than on the other. The highest north point, or where the
distance is greatest from the equator to the verge of the opening in the
northern hemisphere, will be found either in the northern sea, near the
coast of Lapland, on a meridian passing through Spitzbergen, in about
latitude eighty-six degrees, or some-what more easterly in Lapland; and
the verge would become apparent, to the navigator proceeding north, in
about latitude 90 degrees."

### HIS POLAR OPENINGS ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT

Now see how differently Symmes goes about his task. He simply assumes
this, that and the other to be the case. He assumes that the southern
polar opening is two thousand miles greater in diameter than the
northern one. Why? We do not know. He assumes certain inclinations of
the planes of the polar openings to the plane of the ecliptic. He tells
us where the highest northern point will be found--only as he is really
not sure he gives two possible locations. We decline to give any data in
advance of actual exploration. If we say that the openings into

<span id="page_362">p. 362</span>

the interior of the earth are at such and such a point we are simply
making an approximation based upon the actual evidence of navigators. We
have done much exploring since Symmes wrote, but even with the newer
discoveries in mind it is not safe to indulge in a lot of very definite
figures and anticipations. We prefer to stick to the actual facts as
navigators have found them.

### HIS DOUBLE SHELLED SPHERES INHABITED INSIDE AND OUT

Now here is another point in which Symmes' theory differs radically from
our own:

"Each of the spheres composing the earth, as well as those constituting
the other planets throughout the universe, is believed to be habitable
both on the inner and outer surface; and lighted and warmed according to
those general laws which communicate light and heat to every part of the
universe. The light may not, indeed, be so bright, nor the heat so
intense, as is indicated in high northern latitudes (about where the
verge is supposed to commence) by the paleness of the sun and the
darkness of the sky; facts which various navigators who have visited
those regions confirm; yet they are, no doubt, sufficiently lighted and
warmed to promote the propagation and support of animal and vegetable
life.

"The different spheres constituting our planet, and the other orbs in
creation, most probably do not revolve on axes,
[parallel](errata.htm#100.md) to each other, nor perform

<span id="page_363">p. 363</span>

their revolutions in the same period of time, as is indicated by the
spots on the belts of Jupiter, which move faster on one belt than
another."

It was because he had noticed the belts of Jupiter that Symmes was led
in the first place to suppose that the planets might be composed of
concentric shells, and he explains these belts or tries to--by talking
of the reflection of light from the different verges of the shells which
compose Jupiter. By why does he suppose that the earth should have at
least five of these shells?

### THEORY CANNOT BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY

It will be noticed that Symmes has no coherent theory, or at least no
observed facts which will clearly show how the spaces between the verges
are lighted and warmed. This is perhaps the point where the theory
breaks down most disastrously. We have shown that there is more heat in
the interior of the earth than there is outside of that realm, not less.
And we have shown it from observed facts--Symmes depends on theory, and
he is wrong.

Symmes also claims that:

"The atmosphere surrounding the sphere is probably more dense on the
interior surface than on the exterior, the increased pressure of which
must increase the force of gravity; as the power of gravity must
increase in proportion as we approach nearer the pole. Clouds formed in
the atmosphere of the convexity of the sphere, probably float in through

<span id="page_364">p. 364</span>

the polar openings, and visit the interior in the form of rain and snow.
. ."

This, it will be seen, is the very opposite of our theory. There is no
snow in the interior of the earth, except near the polar openings.

Symmes' theory differs from ours too, in that Symmes thinks there are in
each sphere cavities in the center of the matter composing it, and that
these [cavities](errata.htm#101.md) are filled with a very rarefied gas or
elastic substance, something, he says, like hydrogen. These mid-plane
spaces, as he calls them, tends, he claims, to give the sphere "a degree
of lightness and buoyancy." He also thinks that other interstices exist
nearer the surface of each sphere and of quite limited extent. The gas,
his chronicler states, "escaping from these spaces is, no doubt, the
cause of earthquakes; and supplies the numerous volcanoes. This gas,
be-coming rarefied and escaping, must occasion most of these great
revolutions and phenomena in nature, which we know to have occurred in
the geology of the earth. This ærial fluid with which the mid-plane
spaces or cavities are filled, may possibly be adapted to the support of
animal life; and the interior surfaces of the spheres formed by them may
abound with animals, with organs only adapted to the medium in which
they are destined to inhabit."

Now it is obvious that this is not to be taken seriously. To compare
such thought as that to our theory is patently absurd. Instead of
studying the

<span id="page_365">p. 365</span>

facts as we have done, Symmes simply makes up a new idea to explain away
each fact as it hit him in the face. He had to account in some way for
volcanoes, so he made each of his spheres not only a hollow ball with
another sphere inside it, but he gave it a double shell with mid-plane
spaces or cavity between the two shells and other interstices in which
there was a gaseous and elastic fluid. Why that fluid should sometimes
burst forth as volcanoes or earthquakes he does not say. There does not
seem any reason why, once imprisoned, it should not stay there forever.
If it were going to burst forth at all it ought to have done so while
the spheres were relatively hot, before they had cooled down to the
rigidity which as a matter of fact overtakes all planets when they
solidify. And then why does he go ahead and postulate the existence of
animals in his mid-plane spaces? As these are not, like the spheres
themselves, open at any place, there would have to be a separate
creation of the animals in each one. How uncalled for is any such
fantastic notion as that!

Symmes also argues for the hollowness of his concentric spheres by
asserting that hollowness is a principle of nature that the stalk of
wheat is hollow, that the bones of animals and birds are hollow and the
hairs of our head are hollow.

But in each of those cases the hollowness is there for a purpose. In the
case of the bones it is there as

<span id="page_366">p. 366</span>

a chamber to hold the marrow. The birds have very light bones, with
large hollows, because the species with the lightest bones have been
able to fly better and so have survived in the struggle for existence.
If we were to assert that the earth must be solid because all pebbles on
the beach are solid, because the trunks of trees are solid and the tusks
of elephants solid we would be using the same sort of argument that
Symmes is using--arguing from apparent analogies--and we would be quite
wrong, because, as a matter of fact, and as we have shown in this book
the earth is not solid.

But we prove that it is not solid by facts. Symmes tries to prove his
[assertions](errata.htm#102.md) by remarks such as the above.

Of course it is true that everything in the universe tends to assume the
cellular form. That we admit and have commented on. But there is always
a reason for the particular kind of shape and composition of the cell,
whether it be a vegetable cell in a leaf, a cell of the protoplasm of an
animal, or the huge cell, open at both ends, with a nucleus or a central
sun, which forms the earth. And in every case the reasons for those
formations must be found in the study of the body itself, and not in
making far fetched comparisons between that and other bodies far removed
from it in character and purpose and composition.

<span id="page_367">p. 367</span>

### WOULD EXPLAIN POLAR CAPS AND PLANETARY RINGS BY REFRACTION

Symmes also tries to explain the appearance of the other planets besides
Jupiter as being due to refractions of light as the different verges of
the spheres were turned toward us, but he does not by this method
succeed in clearly stating just how such appearances could account for
what we observe. He says, for instance, that the belts of Jupiter:
"would be produced by the shadow cast on the space between the polar
opening of one sphere and the adjoining one; that is, a portion of the
sunshine would be reflected from the verges of the spheres on which it
fell; and another portion would appear to be swallowed by the
intervening space. And if refraction bends the rays of vision between
and under his spheres as it bends a portion of the rays of the sun, so
as to produce the apparent belts of comparative shade, then a very
complete solution of those appearances, heretofore considered wonderful,
would be afforded. The variation which has been observed in their
number, shape, and dimensions, can in no better way be accounted for,
than by concluding the planet is constituted of a number of concentric
spheres, of different breadths, revolving on different axes and with
different velocities, so as sometimes to present to our view the verge
of one sphere, and sometimes that of another; and the rays of the sun
falling on the parts of the verges

<span id="page_368">p. 368</span>

present to us, would occasion the diversified appearances which we
discover."

Well, he goes on a little further along that line but we need not follow
him, for it is obvious that his explanation does not work.

Take Mars, for example. If our theory were wrong and Symmes were right,
the polar caps of Mars would be made invisible every so often because
some inner sphere, revolving at its own rate on its own axis, would
cover up the polar opening on the outer surface. But the polar caps of
Mars are always bright, with certain variations, and what is more, we
see direct gleams of light from the Martian interior sun penetrate
through the [aperture](errata.htm#103.md) and strike directly into our
telescopes. This could not possibly happen on Symmes' theory, for there
would be no interior sun from which light could come.

And yet people say that our theory is the same as Symmes' theory.

### SYMMES ON SUN SPOTS

Symmes also tries to explain the spots on the sun by his theory. He
thinks they are vast holes or fractures in the outer surface or crust
through which the inner crust appears. But as we have already stated the
sun is not made on that plan and could not be. That Symmes took no
account of the great heat of the sun shows that he elaborated his theory
largely out of his own mind. He did not get the facts first and trim his
theory to fit the facts. He

<span id="page_369">p. 369</span>

first thought out the theory and then only took cognizance of those few
facts which fitted it. Other facts he ignored. This is just the opposite
of what we have done. We have taken every fact into account as the list
of authorities which we have consulted abundantly shows.

Now let the reader contrast that whole theory with our array of facts.
Just because matter tends to take the spherical shape, when no outside
forces interfere with it, and because he has seen appearances when
observing Jupiter that suggest that the rings round that planet may be
optical delusions, not rings at all, but outer shells, Symmes builds up
the theory that all planets and suns are composed of concentric spheres.
Why these spheres revolve on different axes and at different speeds he
does not tell us, and on all those points of his theory that are most
doubtful and need the most cogent arguments to prove them, he is most
vague.

### SYNOPSIS OF OUR OWN THEORY AS CONTRASTED WITH SYMMES

How different is the theory outlined in this book. When we say that the
earth is a hollow body with polar openings and an interior sun, we back
up the statement by referring to nebulas in many stages of evolution in
which the gradual forming of the outer envelope of the future planet and
the interior sun, and even the beginnings of the polar openings, are all
clearly visible in their different stages. Then we

<span id="page_370">p. 370</span>

point to the actual constitution of the planets, Mars, Venus, and
Mercury, and we show just what the polar openings are like. We show that
they are not ice caps, because direct light has been seen to come from
them. We show also that the light from these openings extends in an
immense dome, reflected from the Martian atmosphere, high above the
surface of the planet. And then we show, in connection with the aurora
of the earth, that the auroral light, so called, is precisely the same
thing. Then we demonstrate conclusively that the earth, like Mars and
the other planets, has its polar openings, too, because the polar
regions are much warmer than the northern latitudes through which one
travels to reach them. We show how warm currents come from these regions
and how animal life takes refuge in them as breeding and feeding
grounds. The picture of the earth that we draw is not an imaginative
construction, like Symmes' with such things as "mid-plane spaces"--whose
[existence](errata.htm#104.md) is not backed up by any observed fact. No,
our picture of the earth is one which is all through based on
observations. The light and warmth of the interior regions we claim to
come from the central sun whose rays stream out and form the aurora and
whose heat warms the water that comes over the lip of the orifice in the
life-giving current that every Arctic explorer has observed and marveled
at. From this warm interior, too, come the mammoth and other animals and
birds which the

<span id="page_371">p. 371</span>

explorers have noticed with such wonderment. From there come the
mysterious pollen of unknown plants and the seeds of tropical trees--for
it is tropical vegetable life that we shall find in. that hot, moist
interior. This picture of the earth fits in with every scientific fact
which has ever been discovered, and there are no scientific facts which
contradict it. Could Symmes say as much for his ideas?

After all, where Symmes made deductions about the law of gravity and the
nature of things in general--things about which even now, almost a
hundred years later than Symmes we know very little--all we do is ask
people to use their eyes. Every point that establishes our theory rests
on something that can be seen with the eye. The appearance of the
nebulas can be seen, and the progress from one stage of evolution to the
next can be compared. The light from the Martian interior sun has
actually been seen and recorded. The animals of the north have actually
been observed traveling north. The warm current from the North is tested
for its temperature by the thermometer; its direction checked by the
compass. The mammoth is not only seen but its freshness is tested by
eating. And so it goes. Such mere arguing as Professor Dominian brought
to bear against our theory will never refute it because our theory does
not rest on argument; it rests on observed facts. The only way
scientists can refute our theory is by answering in a way fully as
conclusive as ours

<span id="page_372">p. 372</span>

and free from self-contradiction, all the questions which we ask them in
our concluding chapter. As these questions never have been answered
satisfactorily by scientists, as the efforts to answer one involve
theories which are contradicted by the efforts to answer another, it is
obvious that the scientists are baffled, and they will remain baffled as
long as they ignore the guiding principle or guiding fact call it
whichever you will--that binds all these appearances together and makes
them agree one with the other.

And between this carefully based picture of the earth and the planets as
close observation reveals them to us, between this sober and scientific
theory, and the fantastic theory of Symmes there is nothing in common.
Only ignorance and prejudice or sheer dishonesty could ever make out
that our theory was a rehash of Symmes' theory. For in truth they are
different in their inceptions, in their methods of argument, and in
their final results.
