# CHAPTER IV.

## EARLY POLAR EXPLORATION

One of the most prominent writers in England, a man, too, who had had a
scientific education, was given a sketch of the main arguments in
support of our theory, and he replied that our presentation of the facts
would have absolutely convinced him if it were not for one thing--that
the poles had actually been discovered. Perhaps this is the objection
which is most often heard on the lips of people to whom our theory has
been presented, and who do not agree with it. But that objection is
fully considered and answered in the pages that will follow. What has
actually been discovered by polar explorers? That is the question we
shall ask of them, and the answers will always be in their own words,
the records of their own observations, the findings of their own
instruments and calculations.

### A WORD IN ADVANCE ON PEARY

We shall follow the history of polar exploration from the earliest days
in which real progress was made right through to the discoveries of
Peary--and we shall see that what Peary discovered was not an actual
polar point of solid ice at the apex of the world, but rather a point
which he identified by the

<span id="page_101">p. 101</span>

compass needle--which it should be remembered points to the magnetic and
not to the geographical pole--and we shall further prove, from Peary's
own recorded observations, from the statements he has made over his own
signature, that in the actual polar regions there is every evidence of
warm currents coming up from the interior, and that there is even
stronger evidence than warm currents that the interior is open to the
exterior in that region, and that the opening is what we have said it is
and leads to what we have claimed it leads to. But that is to anticipate
more than one of the chapters that follow. For the present we will
follow the Arctic explorers, and, distinguishing between what they
actually observe--which is dependable--and what they merely think--which
is subject to error--we shall see all their testimony converging toward
the establishment of what we have already set forth.

### HOW WE CONVINCE SUCH CRITICS AS THE ONE ABOVE QUOTED

It is of course obvious that if our theory be true, the actual region of
each pole will be warmed by the seas of the inner surface of the earth,
and that these, warmed by the interior sun, will cause the climate
around the polar openings to be a very mild one. The sea around the
polar opening will be an open one. At some point on the arctic voyage
the ice barriers will be passed and the voyagers will enter

<span id="page_102">p. 102</span>

a region that grows warmer and warmer as they sail up to the polar
opening and then over it and on into the interior of the earth. They
would only know that they had actually passed over the lip by the
peculiar behavior of the magnetic needle and by the fact that they would
see above them as above would then mean toward the actual center of the
earth--the interior sun which of course would be shining whether the
voyagers came under its influence during the day or during the arctic
night.

That is what would happen if our theory were true. The question is,
then, has anything like that been actually observed? The answer is that
every arctic navigator from the beginning has made observations which
more and more agree with that view the further north the
[observers](errata.htm#29.md) go. To show how unanimous this testimony is
let us go back a good distance.

### BARRINGTON'S IMPORTANT BOOK

In 1818 there was published in New York an American edition of a book
entitled, "The Possibility of Approaching the North Pole Asserted," by
the Hon. D. Barrington: A new edition with an appendix containing Papers
on the same Subject and on a North-west Passage, by Colonel Beaufoy, F.
R. S. Barrington, as well as Beaufoy, was a Fellow of the Royal Society,
the greatest English scientific body, and he was convinced that the
voyage to the North Pole was a possibility. In order to convince

<span id="page_103">p. 103</span>

his colleagues in the Royal Society of this, he read a number of papers
containing information that he had gathered from whalers and other
voyagers in the Arctic. Here are some of the facts he deduced. In 17S1 a
Captain Mac-Callam, commanding a whaler, during a lull in the usual
business of the voyage, thought he would make a dash for the North Pole.
He reached a latitude of 83½ degrees and he found in front of him no
further ice, but clear water. In fact "they had not seen a speck of ice
for the last three degrees." But he had to abandon his voyage as he did
not wish to incur the displeasure of his owners. The author then cites
another voyage, described to him by a Dr. Dallie of Holland who made a
voyage on a Dutch war-ship in supervision of the Greenland fisheries, on
which voyage a latitude of 88 degrees was reached: "when the weather was
warm, the sea perfectly free from ice, and rolling like the Bay of
Biscay. Dallie now pressed the captain to proceed; but he answered that
he had already gone too far by having neglected his station . . ."

### BARRINGTON COMBATS IDEAS OF THE DAY

Before citing further from Barrington let us remind the reader that he
is not arguing in support of our theory. He is simply calling to the
attention of his contemporaries actual facts which he has collected and
which seem to him to make the voyage to the pole more feasible than it
was thought to be

<span id="page_104">p. 104</span>

at the time--when of course the means of navigation were so much poorer
than they are at present. At that time, too, it was the generally
received notion that there was a perpetual barrier of ice whose
boundaries [corresponded](errata.htm#30.md) more or less with a latitude of
80½ and that any discovery of the regions north of that would have to be
made by a sort of wind-propelled sled, a mechanism actually used for
traveling over the ice by the Dutch.

### HIS REPORT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY

This idea Barrington [combated](errata.htm#31.md). He recalled to the Royal
Society that as early as 1663 its secretary at that time had examined a
traveler lately returned from Greenland, and that this traveler had told
of a Hollander captain who claimed that he had come within half a degree
of the pole, and corroborated it by showing his journal, the entries
being attested by his mate. Now in view of later explorations it does
not matter just how accurate that sailor was--the point is simply that
even in those early days it was possible to get much nearer the pole
than was supposed at the time, and simply for the reason that the water
was open as one went north.

But Barrington has instance after instance of the same kind. He mentions
in [particular](errata.htm#32.md) two Hollander whalers who in the
seventeenth century--sailed to 89 degrees and found no ice but "a free
and open sea."

<span id="page_105">p. 105</span>

### SOME OF THE FACTS HE ADDUCES

It is also interesting to note that Barrington quotes a passage from the
Philosophical Transactions for 1675 which says:

"For it is well known to all that sail Northward, that most of the
Northern coasts are frozen up many leagues, though in the open sea it is
not so, no, nor under the Pole itself, unless by accident."

Barrington, of course, was trying to show that the idea of a perpetually
ice-bound pole was simply a bogy to frighten explorers away from the
attempt to gain the pole, and so he devotes himself next to a
consideration of the actual ice-conditions in the far north, and what he
says is so sensible and to the point, that we may as well settle the
question as far as the ice is concerned, by quoting from his pages. The
popular idea, doubtless, is that it is so cold at the actual pole that
the sea water there is frozen. But this is not the case at all. The ice
we see in pictures taken in polar regions is not frozen sea-water at
all. It is frozen fresh water. Here is a description of the actual
character of [Arctic](errata.htm#33.md) ice which Barrington translates
from a "Dissertation of Michel Lomonosoff, translated from the Swedish
Transactions of 1752, entitled 'De l’Origine des Monts de Glace dans la
Mer du Nord':

### ICE CONDITIONS IN THE NORTH

"There are three kinds of ice in the Northern Seas. The first is like
melted snow, which is become

<span id="page_106">p. 106</span>

partly hardened, is more easily broken into pieces, less transparent, is
seldom more than six inches thick, and, when dissolved, is found to be
intermixed with salt. This first sort of ice is the only one which is
ever formed from sea water.

### ICE ONLY FROM FRESH WATER

"If a certain quantity of water, which contains as much salt as sea
water is exposed to the greatest degree of cold, it never becomes firm
and pure ice, but resembles tallow or suet, whilst it preserves the
taste of salt, so that the sweet transparent ice can never be formed in
the sea. If the ice of the sea itself, therefore, confined in a small
vessel without any motion, cannot thus become true ice, much less can it
do so in a deep and agitated ocean."

And Barrington adds: "The author hence infers that all the floating ice
in the Polar Seas comes from the Tartarian Rivers and Greenland."

It would be tedious to recount the many other instances of sailors
reaching latitudes from 80 to 89 degrees given by Barrington, but the
notable thing about his instances is that they reveal the fact that the
sailors of those early days, the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
all believed that the way to the pole was more or less open, and they
believed it because the further north they actually reached the less ice
they met with.

<span id="page_107">p. 107</span>

### WITHIN FIVE AND A HALF DEGREES OF THE POLE

But Barrington has some other very interesting observations. He quotes a
memorandum from the Astronomer Royal of England to the effect that a Mr.
Stephens, sailing on a Dutch ship in 1754, was driven into latitude 84½
or within 5½ degrees of the pole. They "did not find the cold excessive,
and used little more than common clothing; met with but little ice, and
the less the farther they went to the Northward. . . It is always clear
weather with a North wind, and thick weather with a Southerly wind. . .
Says he has often tasted the ice when the sea water has been let to run
or dry off it, and always found it fresh."

The author then goes on to cite many instances of warm weather near the
poles warmer weather in fact than the observers had experienced at
points many degrees further south. He sums up by saying:

"All our accounts agree that in very high latitudes there is less ice."

### THE CONFORMATION OF THE POLAR BASIN

But although Barrington had no suspicion of the actual shape of the
earth as our theory shows it to be, he did suspect that there was a
depression of the earth's surface at the polar circle. In fact he cites
an experiment of Sir Isaac Newton based on the

<span id="page_108">p. 108</span>

swinging of a pendulum at various points on the earth's surface--the
time of swing would vary according to the distance of the pendulum from
the earth's center--and also the actual measuring of a degree at the
Equator and at the Arctic Circle. "This last evidently proved the
depression of the earth's surface towards the pole, which no doubt
gradually increases."

We have only two more observations to make about Mr. Barrington's
examples, before leaving his book for those of later explorers and
writers--who will be found to corroborate his observations at every
point. Then we shall leave him for the present but return to him in
connection with some very interesting observations concerning actual
evidence of an unexplored country which are found floating on the arctic
seas.

### REMARKABLE STATEMENT OF DUTCH CAPTAIN

Those two observations are from a Dutch sea captain and an English
clergyman, then stationed at Petersburgh, respectively. The Dutch
captain makes the remarkable statement that the most open sea to the
northward--when in latitude 80, was not in summer as might be expected
if the Pole were really solid ice, but "generally happens in the month
of September" and this is in spite of the fact that the Arctic night is
beginning then--in which surely we should expect the maximum of cold if
the outer sun

<span id="page_109">p. 109</span>

were the only factor in melting the ice, as the ordinary scientists have
assumed it to be. The other observation, made by the English clergyman
may be quoted in full as Barrington gives it:

"Mr. Tooke hath been assured by several persons who have passed the
winter at Kola in Lapland, that in the severest weather, whenever a
Northerly wind blows, the cold diminishes instantly, and that, if it
continues, it always brings on a thaw as long as it lasts.

"He hath also been informed . . . that the seamen who go out from Kola
upon the whale and morse fisheries early in March (for the sea never
freezes there) throw off their winter garments as soon as they are from
fifty to a hundred wersts (three wersts make two miles) from land, and
continue without them all the time they are upon the fishery, during
which they experience no inconvenience from the cold, but that, on their
return, (at the end of May) as they approach land, the cold increases to
such a severity, that they suffer greatly from it.

"This account agrees with that of Barentz, whilst he wintered in Nova
Zembla, and of the Russians in Maloy Brun; the North wind cannot
therefore, during the coldest seasons of the year, be supposed to blow
over ten degrees of ice.

### THE NORTH-WEST PASSAGE

"Governor Ellis indeed, whose zeal in prosecuting the attempt of
discovering the North-west passage

<span id="page_110">p. 110</span>

through Hudson's Bay is so well known, hath suggested to me an argument
which seems to prove the absolute impossibility of a perpetual barrier
of ice from 80½ degrees to the pole.

"If such a tract hath existed for centuries, the increase, in point of
height, must be amazing in a course of years, by the snow, which falls
during the winter, being changed into ice, and which must have formed
consequently a mountain perhaps equal to the Peak of Tenneriffe. Now the
ice which sometimes packs to the northward of Spitzbergen, is said
commonly not to exceed two yards in height."

The reader may think this is a very old argument to be reproducing a
hundred and forty years after it was first made. But we do so because
the argument is as good today as when it was first made, and we wish to
show that even in those days observations were made which have been
corroborated and enlarged right down to the present day--all pointing
irresistibly to one conclusion.
