# CHAPTER XVI.

## EVIDENCE IN THE ANTARCTIC

The Antarctic has not been so thoroughly explored as the Arctic polar
region, and so our evidence from that end of the globe is not so
voluminous, but it is startling in its conclusiveness. One point, in
fact, will doubtless be admitted by the reader to be almost as distinct
a proof of our theory as was the occurrence of the mammoth in Siberia in
a perfectly fresh condition.

### A [GAP](errata.htm#81.md) IN SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE

Before coming to this startling direct evidence, however, let us briefly
show how scientists themselves, in their effort to explain the evolution
of the higher mammals, are driven to suppose the existence of a lost
continent upon which a number of "missing links" between different
grades of animal species would be found were that continent ever
discoverable. As these scientists had no conception of a continent on
the interior surface of the earth they were driven to suppose that
during certain stages in the evolution of life this continent moved
about on the earth's surface by the tilting up of one coast line above
the waves while the other coast line was gradually submerging. This
[ingenious](errata.htm#82.md) idea was put forward by Huxley. Other
scientists thought that there was a vast Antarctic continent,

<span id="page_313">p. 313</span>

but if the polar regions were the solid ice that scientists supposed
this continent could not have produced the species that the scientists
claim lie hidden--that is in fossil form--somewhere, nor could migration
have taken place to other climes.

### A POSSIBLE LOST CONTINENT

To show how important this is let us quote from an article in the
*Scientific American Supplement* for October 8, 1892, by Dr. E. Murray
Aaron. It seems, according to him that there is a gap in evolution
between the animals of the Mesozoic era and the higher mammals, the
placental mammalia as they are called, including the apes, cats, dogs,
bears, horses, and oxen. From the Mesozoic forms to these forms is a big
jump and one that is apparently very suddenly made. But how did these
higher forms evolve? They could not have come full fledged upon the
earth for nature never takes such a big leap. The opponents of evolution
make the best of this gap and challenge the evolutionists to fill it.
Obviously there must have been some intermediate forms, and the question
is, where did they live and where are their remains to be found. Dr.
Aaron proceeds:

### SHIFTING THE GARDEN OF EDEN

"Huxley's 'Lemuria,' a vast continent long lost beneath the water of the
Pacific, the original 'Eden' of many latter day ethnologists, may be the
region whose subsidence has buried its much sought for treasures

<span id="page_314">p. 314</span>

beneath fathoms of water, but, however that may be, the discovery of new
forms of animal and plant life and the discovery of fossil remains as
already pointed out, cannot fail to shed a flood of light upon this, one
of the most engrossing problems of the study of geographical
distribution as it effects organic evolution. In fact, already is enough
known of the material derivable from the Antarctic region to warrant Mr.
Blanford, in a recent address before the Geographical Society of London
in stating that 'a growing acquaintance with the biology of the world
leads naturalists to a belief that the placental mammalia and other
higher forms of terrestrial life originated during the Mesozoic period
still further to the southward--that is to say, in the lost Antarctic
continent.' . . ."

The author then quotes from a paper on Antarctic exploration read by Mr.
G. S. Griffiths, F. G. S., before the Bankers' Institute of
Australasia--who had himself quoted the above words--to the effect that:

### A COMMON BIRTHPLACE

"It almost necessarily follows that wherever the mammalia were developed
there also man had his birthplace, and if these speculations should
prove to be well founded we may have to shift the location of the Garden
of Eden from the northern to the southern hemisphere."

And Dr. Aaron adds:

<span id="page_315">p. 315</span>

"What a vista of results even to the production of fossilized primitive
man and his immediate predecessors and the harmonizing of this corrected
geological account with the Mosaic cosmogony, would open up, it may be
left to the imagination of the reader to conjecture."

The paper by Mr. Griffiths which Dr. Aaron refers to above was printed
in *Nature* late in the year 1890 and from it some other interesting
particulars may be gained. He says that if there were not such a
continent as the one he supposed to have been lost there would not have
been any chance for the migration of the animals and plants which are
now found on such widely separated parts of the globe as South Africa
and Australia. He says:

"We are told by Professor Hutton of Christchurch that forty-four per
cent of the New Zealand flora is of Antarctic origin. New Zealand and
South America have three flowering plants in common, also two fresh
water fishes, five seaweeds, three marine crustaceans, one marine
mollusk and one marine fish."

He then cites a number of other instances where widely separated lands
have the very same species of animals, fish and plants:

"Yet the lands which have these plants and animals in common are so
widely separated from each other that they could not possibly now
interchange their inhabitants. Certainly toward the equator they
approach each other rather more, but even this fact fails

<span id="page_316">p. 316</span>

to account for the present distribution. . . Yet there must have been
some means of communication in the past and it appears certain that it
took the form of a common fatherland for the various common forms from
which they spread to the northern hemisphere."

### THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH FULFILLS THIS CONDITION

We claim that this common fatherland is none other than the interior of
the earth which by its warmth and luscious vegetation--remember that its
sun is shining all the time and evaporating the water to form a very
damp atmosphere--is just adapted to those large forms of life that hold
the missing links spoken of above. By drifting from this common land on
glaciers and icebergs these animals were gradually distributed.

### A GREAT MYSTERY THAT ONLY OUR THEORY WILL SOLVE

That this distribution is perfectly possible and may still be going on
to some extent, is proved by the fact that an Antarctic voyager some
years since saw a large iceberg covered with earthy matter, rocks and
stones, showing that it came from land and not from barren ice as the
orthodox scientists would have us think covers the polar regions.

But there was something else on this iceberg and it forms such a
remarkable proof of our theory that it alone might have suggested some
such theory as ours

<span id="page_317">p. 317</span>

to anyone who pondered it sufficiently. Before stating the facts which
form such a mystery to the scientist let us remind the reader that while
the Arctic regions are inhabited by the Eskimos of whom we have already
read, there have never been discovered any traces of human life either
near or within the Antarctic circle. Penguins and seals and fish
practically are alone in those regions. No Antarctic explorer has ever
met a native tribe or put up for the winter in a native village. Man in
the Antarctic is an unknown species.

How then does the reader explain the facts in the following statements
taken from the nautical magazine for 1893. The statements occur in the
course of an article devoted to reports of icebergs in the Antarctic
seas:

"The Gladys, [Captain](errata.htm#83.md) E. B. Hatfield, . . . was
completely embayed by icebergs (43 degrees S., 33 West) and did not get
clear of fog and ice until July 4 in 40 degrees South, 30 West. At four
p. m. of the latter date, signs of human beings having lived for some
time on one of the icebergs in sight were well in evidence. On the
northwest side was a beaten track, a place of refuge formed in a
sheltered nook on the summit, and apparently five dead men lay on
different parts of the berg.

"There were no indications of life, but the wicked weather precluded any
attempt at further search and the Gladys was kept on her course."

<span id="page_318">p. 318</span>

Now let the reader remember two things. Dr. Cook, surgeon to the Belgian
Antarctic expedition, writing in the Scientific American Supplement for
June 23, 1900, gives the unanimous scientific verdict when he says that:

### FROM WHERE DID THESE HUMAN BEINGS COME?

"Indeed in the great sweep of the earth's surface, which surrounds the
south pole and extends far northward into the temperate zone comprising
one quarter of the entire terrestrial area, there has not been found the
footprint of man."

And let the reader remember also that these were no shipwrecked sailors,
for the iceberg was coming from the south at the time; subsequently
inquiry did not reveal the loss of any ship in the Antarctic prior to
this discovery; and if these had been civilized men cast astray they
would have put up a flag or some similar signal.

Other ships in this vicinity sighted icebergs with sand and earth on
them proving that they came from a land source. And it was undoubtedly
from this land source that this berg, which had earth on it as well as
the five dead men, came. But, the reader says, you have just quoted an
authority to prove that there are no men resident in the Antarctic
regions. Where, then, did these five unfortunate castaways come from?
From the interior continent the other side of the southern polar
orifice, and we have no doubt that the

<span id="page_319">p. 319</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Eskimos and these men are connected. For the
Eskimo has not been able to leave his northern home and come south on
the outside of the earth because that involved navigation in ships. But
on the inside of the earth there is a milder climate and a different
land formation, and there would be nothing to prevent such of the Eskimo
tribes as penetrated over the northern Arctic lip, or what is more
likely were born there from where they emigrated to the outer surface
through the north--there is nothing to prevent them, we say, from going
south along the interior surface of the earth and coming to the other
polar orifice and out over it into the inhospitable Antarctic regions
whence they drifted on this iceberg to the place where they were seen by
Captain Hadfield.

As a speaker before the Sixth International Geographical Congress held
in London, Mr. C. E. Borchgrevink, said, after reciting the discovery
told of above:

"This earthy matter, rocks and stones, together with signs of human
life, all found upon one of these visitants from that unknown region;
this is surely a strong presumption in favor of the existence of races
that answer to the Eskimos of the north."

### A RACE LIVING IN THE INTERIOR

Yes, we reply, it is a strong presumption, but it is not a presumption
that these races live on the exterior of the planet, for they have never
been met

<span id="page_320">p. 320</span>

with. But the presumption is that they live in the interior or at least
that they have visited that part of the interior from time to time.

This same scientist also stated that on his own voyage to the Antarctic
he noted that many of the seals had remarkable scars upon their bodies
which indicated that they had been hunted. But no hunters from the north
had been in that neighborhood and there was no seal industry. Is it not
possible that tribes in the interior corresponding to the Eskimo of the
north had hunted these seals?

Altogether the reader must admit that this evidence from the Antarctic
is very important. Only such a land as we describe within the interior
of the earth will relieve the scientists of their puzzle in explaining
the distribution of animals. Only such a land makes it possible to
explain the character of the earth-covered icebergs seen in those
southern regions, and only such a land with a clear communication with
the north through the interior of the earth makes it possible to explain
the presence of those five dead men slowly traveling from the extreme
south from a region which all the scientists told us does not give
shelter or food to any human beings.
