# CHAPTER I.

## INTRODUCTORY

An author who puts forth a new idea must expect to meet with opposition
and be ready to defend his idea vigorously. He knows that the great mass
of people is very conservative, especially in its habits of thought and
that it is inclined to take many things--the shape of the earth, for
example--as proven once and for all. But he also knows that the great
reading public even more than the specialist in science is open minded
and willing to give a fair hearing. He will expect some opposition and
some misunderstanding but he may also expect a slow, perhaps, but sure
volunteering of support.

### A NEW IDEA AND A PLEA FOR ITS FAIR HEARING

The author of the present work has set forth in it a theory which is not
only new that in itself would not necessarily cause opposition in a
world which is always hungering for some new thing--but it is a theory
which involves the denial of a number of ideas which are old and widely
held and often held by people who do not understand their bearing. These
people will defend them with such weapons as ridicule or perhaps
misrepresentation.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

### THE TRAINED SCIENTIST AND THE AVERAGE READER

From trained scientists on the other hand the author expects to meet
with greater prejudice than from the public, but he does expect that any
criticism they may have to make upon this theory will be made from a
purely scientific standpoint, that his idea will not be dismissed simply
because he is not a professional explorer or astronomer. Unfortunately
scientists often do this. They have their professional freemasonry. If
you are not one of them they do not want to listen to your theories.

But to the man in the street the author wishes to say this: there is not
in the whole course of this book a single statement that is not backed
up by the actual experiments, observations, discoveries and reports of
these same scientists. They cannot claim that the theory expounded in
this book is an unscientific theory, for every bit of it is solidly
based upon their own findings. Our theory may be untrue, but if it is,
then the findings of Nansen and every other Arctic explorer, of Sir
Robert Ball, Percival Lowell and every other astronomer, are wrong. For
upon the work done by these men and upon no other considerations
whatsoever than those of pure scientific knowledge are the ideas in this
book built.

Let us then address our first words to the average reader whose support
we wish to gain because public

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

opinion will move in time even the most conservative of scientists;
because public opinion is the court of last resort in every case;
because the public will demand a fair hearing when the orthodox
scientist would tend to ignore this as in the past they have ignored
many beneficial discoveries and ideas until they were forced to accept
them.

Most members of this public to whom we would appeal have very definite
notions about the shape and constitution of the earth, but unfortunately
these notions are not as accurate as they are definite, being the fruit
usually of what was learned in school some years ago or of what has been
read in popular and inaccurate text-books or magazine articles.

### OLD IDEAS ABOUT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE EARTH

Now as a matter of fact the scientists themselves no longer hold the
ideas about the constitution of the earth that were taught in all text
books only a few years ago. The notion that the earth is a great ball of
material which has hardened into a shell or crust on the outside but
which is full of molten material within, getting hotter and hotter as we
reach the center--that notion is now no longer generally held. And no
other theory has quite taken its place. Some scientists think that the
earth is a rigid solid we shall see later how both schools have
explained volcanoes but others disagree with them, and think that while
the earth may have a solid center that it

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

does have a liquid hot layer somewhere between its center and its
surface. But into these rival theories we need not go now. We only
adduce them to show the reader that there is room for another theory;
that the field is open and explanations of the constitution of the earth
are really called for--for none of the theories up to the present have
explained all the facts.

Of course it is very easy for anyone to deny all the facts of science
and get up some purely private explanation of the formation of the
earth. The man who does that is a crank. Unfortunately the man in the
street does not always discriminate between a crank and a scientist. At
one time Orville and Wilbur Wright were called cranks because they
admitted that they were trying to do something new, something that had
never been done before. Many scientists said that flying was an
impossibility for human beings; that they were not meant to fly and
never would fly. The Wright Brothers did not retort by saying that
science was wrong, and then do a lot of silly and unscientific
experiments. Had they done that they would have injured themselves. On
the contrary they opposed their better and more thorough science to this
old-fashioned and reactionary science. So we meet the objections which
the older scientists bring against our theory with better and more up to
date science. In that way, although we deny that the usual idea of the
formation of the earth is correct we are not in the same class with a
number

The earth as it would appear if viewed from space showing the north
polar opening to the planet's interior which is hollow and contains a
central sun instead of an ocean of liquid lava.  

 

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

of other people who have denied it. There is one man who has stated that
the earth is an immense hollow sphere and that mankind and the land and
oceans and even the stars are all on the inside of it. But he is a crank
for he has simply taken his private notion, evolved within his own brain
and has made a religion of it. We beg the reader that he will not
confuse us with any of that sort of theorizing. If the reader says, "You
believe in a hollow earth--oh yes, that is what Koresh taught," he is
doing us a grave injustice, even though it be true that we claim the
earth to be hollow.

### CRANKY IDEAS ARE NOT IN SAME CLASS WITH SCIENTIFIC ONES

It will also be an injustice to us if the reader confuse our idea of a
hollow earth as presented in this book with one or two theories which
have been put out in the past and which only bear a superficial relation
to ours. For instance, nearly one hundred years ago in America a theory
was put forth that the earth consisted of a number of concentric spheres
one within the other. Now that could hardly be called a scientific
theory. It was based on a supposition, and the author argued from his
supposition down to what the facts ought to be. He said in effect,
"According to my principle there ought to be within the earth a series
of spheres each one inside the other". But he did not know, and he never
went down to see.

We take the opposite course. We begin with the facts. We claim that the
earth is a hollow body with an immense opening at each polar axis--an
opening about fourteen hundred miles in diameter and that there is in
the interior of the earth a sun which warms it and gives it light. But
we do not say this in the first place and then say that it follows that
there is warmth in the polar regions where the scientist has told us it
is cold. On the contrary what we do is quote every Arctic explorer from
the fishermen of a hundred years ago to Franklin, Kane, Nansen and
Peary, to the effect that there is warmth at the polar extremities of
the earth. We state that this formation of a hollow shell around a
central sun, with polar openings, is not alone the formation of the
earth but of every planetary body throughout the stellar universe. Why
do we say that? Because we think it ought to be? Because we wish to
impose our own idea on to the facts? No, but because we can see those
polar openings and occasionally the gleam of that central sun as we look
at Mars or Venus through a telescope. And so it goes. In every assertion
we make, we first gather up all the available facts, and the theory of
which we write is not so much a theory that we put forth as it is a
theory which the facts put forth to us when we examined them. We did not
set out with our theory full blown. We set out with a great desire to
understand the facts of astronomy

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

and of the earth's formation. We had read this and that about it and
were struck by the uncertainty of what we had read. We asked ourselves
whether, if we knew all the facts, we would still be puzzled, as we
were, by accounts of warm currents flowing from the North Pole and other
contradictions of accepted science. Having asked ourselves that, we set
out to ascertain all the facts that had any bearing on the case, just as
the Wright brothers set out to ascertain all the facts that would bear
on their problem. And it was the facts in the case, the inexorable and
unalterable facts, that made our theory for us.

So we ask any reader, especially any scientific reader, who does not
believe our theory upon reading this book, not merely to make fun of it,
not merely to deny its possibility, but to produce facts which will
prove it wrong, and then--supposing he can do that which we doubt--to
explain all the facts put forth in this book, to explain all of them, we
say, by the light of any other theory. It might be easy enough to
explain one or two of our facts in some other way. But to explain them
all is impossible on any other theory than ours.

### OUR THEORY IN A NUTSHELL

That the reader may get our theory in a nutshell, that he may comprehend
before he undertakes to read the whole book how widely we have searched
for the material of our foundation we shall briefly recapitulate here
the main outlines of our theory. As

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

already stated we hold that the earth is neither solid nor fluid inside
but that it is a hollow shell of a thickness which, provisionally, we
should estimate to be 800 miles, with an opening at each polar extremity
of approximately fourteen hundred miles across. The interior sun which
warms this inner earth may possibly be 600 miles in diameter, although
we have of course no means of actually measuring it as yet. Why do we
postulate such a sun? The answer is the key to our whole theory. As the
reader may know, the orthodox astronomer explains the evolution of this
earth by saying that the earth, the other planets which revolve around
its sun and that sun itself were all once intermingled gas in a
white-hot or incandescent condition, whirling around at an enormous
rate. As this mass whirled it gradually became a vast spiral owing to
the play of centrifugal forces pushing it away from its center or
nucleus and gravitational forces holding it within the influence of that
center. This went on, according to the scientists, until the gas
arranged itself in a series of concentric rings around that center. Then
each ring broke and formed into a sphere which gradually cooled off
until it liquefied and then solidified on the outside, forming a planet
while the central nucleus became a sun. This is known as the nebular
hypothesis of the evolution of the solar system. But for many reasons,
which will be taken up in detail later, our observations lead us to put
forth a different theory.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Briefly our theory is that the original nebula
did not break up into a solar system but condensed into one planet. From
observations of nebula which are at this moment in various stages of
their evolution we are forced to the conclusion that the rotating mass
of gas, breaking off from its central nucleus forms an envelope of a
roughly spherical shape which afterwards solidifies, leaving the central
nucleus still in the center to form an inner sun. Why there should be
the two polar openings will be explained in the chapter in which the
foregoing assertions are proven.

### OBSERVING THE PLANETS

The next step in the proof of our theory is to scan the planets to see
if indeed they do have this formation, and as Mars is the most easily
observed of them we look at that first. Mars does have two polar
openings--although up to the present time they have most often been
called ice or snow caps. But when we find the scientists themselves
quarreling over that [appellation](errata.htm#4.md) and some of them
proving that the polar caps of Mars cannot be of ice or snow at all, we
begin to think that perhaps our theory is the correct one. But we do not
have to rest satisfied with thinking so. When the late Professor Lowell,
the astronomer who spent much of his life studying Mars--when this great
authority states that he has seen gleams of light coming out through the
so-called polar cap of Mars, then we know that it cannot be

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

an ice-cap and that those gleams must be from the interior sun of Mars.

And if further proof be needed--and our policy is to overlook no scrap
of available proof we have only to observe Venus and Mercury to have our
previous observations confirmed in the case of those planets also.

### OBSERVING CONDITIONS ON THE EARTH

Bearing those very significant facts in mind we next come down to our
own earth. If our facts are to be the same for every planet we shall
find the same conditions here as there, on earth as on Mars. That actual
solid poles have never been discovered in the earth's Arctic and
Antarctic regions we shall prove in another chapter. Here we shall
briefly summarize our evidence. It is to the effect that as explorers go
north of about 80 degrees north latitude, they find that the water
instead of becoming colder in the same ratio in which it had been
getting colder as they left the temperate zone, gradually begins to get
warm again, and they find that this warmth is brought down from the
so-called frozen north in a warm current flowing from the polar regions.
Furthermore they find that birds and animals migrate to the north to
feed and breed instead of to the south. In fact when they get into
really high latitudes, explorers find a greater wealth of animal and
vegetable life than they do in the lower latitudes of the arctic and
sub-arctic

<span id="page_31">p. 31</span>

regions. And as they are sailing to these northern regions they find,
scattered on the icebergs and glaciers, the red pollen of plants that
grow where? Only in the interior of the earth. And they find logs and
other debris of the land washed down in those warm currents just spoken
of. But this is not all. In our chapter on the mammoth and mastodon we
shall adduce evidence to show that the mammoth still lives in the
interior--in fact we shall exhibit case after case where the mammoth has
floated out from the interior incased in glaciers and bergs and has been
frozen in crevasses in the interior near the polar openings, and then
carried over the lip by glacial movements into Siberia.

Other evidence we shall give in abundance but we shall not summarize it
here because we imagine that the reader is already bristling with
objections to what we have already said, and we wish to answer such of
these as can be answered in advance of our main argument. If we mistake
not the reader is more willing to accept our evidence drawn from the
nebula and Mars than he is to accept that drawn from the earth. For the
first two regions are but little known to him, as he has never possessed
the high-power telescopes that are necessary to explore the nebula and
the planets; but he has read the newspapers and magazines and "knows"
that Peary or Cook discovered the Pole (to say nothing of Antarctic
explorations).

<span id="page_32">p. 32</span>

### PEARY AND THE POLAR ORIFICE

Why, says the reader, did Peary not discover that immense orifice at the
polar extremity of the earth if it was there?

The reason is very simple and can best be explained by asking another
question.

Why did not man discover by looking around him, that he was living on
the surface of what is, practically speaking, an immense sphere (to be
exact spheroid)? And why did man for centuries think that the earth was
flat? Simply because the sphere was so large that he could not see its
curvature but thought it was a flat surface, and that he should be able
to move all over the surface of it appeared so natural that, when
scientists first told him it was a sphere he began to wonder why he did
not fall off, or at least, if he lived in the northern hemisphere, he
wondered why the Australians did not fall off--for he had no conception
of the law of gravity.

Now, in the case of the polar explorers the same thing is true. They
sail up to the outer edge of the immense polar opening, but that opening
is so vast--remember that the crust of the earth over which it curves is
eight hundred miles thick--that the down-ward curvature of its edge is
not perceptible to them, and its diameter is so great--say 1400
miles--that its other side is not visible to them. So that if an
explorer went far enough he could sail right over that edge, down over
the seas of the inner world and out

<span id="page_33">p. 33</span>

through the Antarctic orifice, and all that would show him what he had
done, would be that as soon as he got inside he would see a smaller sun
than he was accustomed to--only to him it might look larger owing to its
closeness--and he would not be able to take any observations by the
stars because there would be neither stars nor even a night in which to
see them.

So let the reader have no misgivings that any rash explorer will "fall
into" this aperture.

But, says the reader, would not the force of gravity pull the explorer
who got inside the orifice away from the surface into the central sun;
for does not gravity pull everything to the center of the earth?

### GRAVITATION AND OUR THEORY

The answer to this is, that in gravitational pull it is not the
geometrical position that counts. Center, in the geometrical sense of
the word, does not apply. It is the mass that attracts. And if the great
mass of the earth is in its thick shell, it is the mass of that shell
that will attract, and not a mere geometrical point which is not in the
shell at all, but 2900 miles away from it, as that is the approximate
distance between the central sun and the inner surface of the earth. As
a matter of fact it is the equal distribution of the force of gravity
all through the shell that keeps the sun suspended in the spot which is
equidistant from every part of that shell. When we are on the outside of
the shell it is the mass of the shell that attracts

<span id="page_34">p. 34</span>

us to its surface. When we go over to the inside of the shell that same
force will still keep our feet solidly planted on the inner side.

### FACTS NOW GATHERED FOR THE FIRST TIME

These, we think, are the chief objections which people are likely to
raise when they first learn of our theory, and it will be noted that
they are based on misconceptions of the theory. For this reason we urge
every reader to follow all our argument if he wishes to understand it.
He will find that the facts which we adduce in support of it, are in
themselves very interesting. We have nowhere indulged in too technical
language, and all the authorities we have quoted are trained, reliable
scientists whose word may be taken, whose word, in fact, is always
backed by actual discovery and experiment. As a result the reader will
not only learn the true formation of the earth and be able to follow
with interest and understanding the explorations which will before long
undoubtedly be made by airship, but he will learn some of the
fascinating truths of astronomy and will have a picture before him of
actual conditions in the Arctic regions. In fact, apart from the new
theory here explained for the first time, we know of no other book which
brings to the non-scientific reader so many facts which are not to be
obtained elsewhere in book form. For, unfortunately, the text-books
never keep up with the new discoveries. Books printed some

<span id="page_35">p. 35</span>

years ago in which the earth is represented as a mass of molten lava
contained in a thin crust, are still circulating when scientists have
given up that conception. Such facts as we have gathered about the
mammoth and other animals are also not yet incorporated into the books
that the average man reads. To every reader then, we can promise not
only our theory but a large range of the most interesting facts about
the world he dwells in and the worlds that circle around in the heavens
that he gazes upon in wonder and speculation. And we ask of the reader a
patient reading without prejudice, and that he follow it by thought and
speech--to the end that, if he be convinced by our reasoning, he may
pass on the word and help to find an audience for this new idea that
sufficient interest may be aroused to turn the idea speedily into an
ascertained fact by the simple process of exploring the polar land we
have depicted, and putting our theory to the test.

### THE FINAL TEST

That it will stand this test; that the interior of the earth will be
opened up to our exploration and traffic and observation as we have in
this book opened it up to thought, is our confident belief.
