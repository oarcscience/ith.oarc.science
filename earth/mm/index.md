Charles Gould, the son of the ornithologist John Gould, wrote this book
in the 19th century on the subject now called 'cryptozoology,' the study
of (possibly imaginary) animals only known through anecdotal or folklore
evidence.

The core of the book is about dragons: Western, Chinese, and Japanese,
although it also covers the Sea-serpent, the Unicorn, and the Chinese
Phoenix. Gould hypothesized that the dragon was based on an unknown,
very rare animal, a huge reptile with wings, which became extinct in
historical times. He also concluded that persistent sea-serpent
sightings were also due to an undiscovered surviving prehistoric marine
animal. He drew on the then-emerging body of fossil evidence for
prehistoric megafauna, from flying lizards to whale-sized aquatic
dinosaurs.

In context the proposal was not all that outrageous.
[Darwin](../../aor/darwin/index) had 25 years earlier proposed that
humans are part of a huge web of biological relationships over vast
realms of time and space. So what other paradigms were about to be
shattered?

Gould leads off with a discussion of some other 'earth mysteries:' the
world-wide flood myth, cultural diffusion, and Atlantis; readers looking
for the cryptozoology will want to skip forward to [Chapter VI](mm09).
Extensive illustrations, translations from rare documents, and
historical accounts from newspaper articles, make this a must-have book
for anyone interested in this subject.
