## APPENDIX II.

### THE DRAGON.

#### ÆLIANIIS DE NATURÂ ANIMALIUM.

##### BOOK II. ch. 26.

The dragon \[which is perfectly fearless of beasts\], when it hears the
noise of the wings of an eagle, immediately conceals itself in
hiding-places.

##### BOOK II. ch. 21.

Æthiopia generates dragons reaching thirty paces long; they have no
proper name, but they merely call them slayers of elephants, and they
attain a great age. So far do the Æthiopian accounts narrate. The
Phrygian history also states that dragons are born which reach ten paces
in length; which daily in midsummer, at the hour when the forum is full
of men in assembly, are wont to proceed from their caverns, and \[near
the river Rhyndacus\], with part of the body on the ground, and the rest
erect, with the neck gently stretched out, and gaping mouth, attract
birds, either by their inspiration, or by some fascination, and that
those which are drawn down by the inhalation of their breath glide down
into their stomach—\[and that they continue this until sunset,\] but
that after that, concealing themselves, they lay in ambush for the herds
returning from the pasture to the stable, and inflict much injury, often
killing the herdsmen and gorging themselves with food.

##### BOOK VI. ch. 4.

When dragons are about to eat fruit they suck the juice of the wild
chicory, because this affords them a sovereign remedy against inflation.
When they purpose lying in wait for a man or a beast, they eat deadly
roots and herbs; a thing not unknown to Homer, for he makes mention of
the dragon, who, lingering and twisting himself in front of his den,
devoured noxious herbs.

<span id="page_378">p. 378</span>

##### BOOK VI. ch. 21.

In India, as I am told, there is great enmity between the dragon and
elephant. Wherefore the dragons, aware that elephants are accustomed to
pluck off boughs from trees for food, coil themselves beforehand in
these trees, folding the tail half of their body round the limbs, and
leaving the front half hanging like a rope. When an elephant approaches
for the purpose of browsing on the young branches, the dragon leaping on
him, tears out his eyes, and then squeezing his neck with his front part
and lashing him with his tail, strangles him in this strange kind of
noose.

##### BOOK VI. ch. 22.

The elephant has a great horror of the dragon.

##### BOOK VI. ch. 17.

In Idumea, or Judæa, during Herod's power, according to the statement of
the natives of the country, a very beautiful, and just adolescent,
woman, was beloved by a dragon of exceptional magnitude; who visited her
betimes and slept with her as a lover. She, indeed, although her lover
crept towards her as gently and quietly as lay in his power, yet utterly
alarmed, withdrew herself from him; and to the end that a forgetfulness
of his passion might result from the absence of his mistress, absented
herself for the space of a month.

But the desire of the absent one was increased in him, and his amatory
disposition was daily so far aggravated that he frequently came both by
day and night to that spot, where he had been wont to be with the
maiden, and when unable to meet with his inamorata, was afflicted with a
terrible grief. After the girl returned, angry at being, as it were
spurned, he coiled himself round her body, and softly and gently
chastised her on the legs.

##### BOOK VI. ch. 63.

A dragon whelp, born in Arcadia, was brought up with an Arcadian child;
and in process of time, when both were older, they entertained a mutual
affection for one another. The friends of the boy, seeing how the dragon
had increased in magnitude in so short a time, carried him, while
sleeping with the boy in the same bed, to a remote spot, and, leaving
him there, brought the boy back. The dragon thereon remained in the wood
\[feeding on growing plants and poisons\], preferring a solitary life to
one in towns and \[human\] habitations. Time having rolled on, and the
boy having attained youth, and the dragon maturity, the former, while
travelling upon one occasion through the wilds in the neighbourhood of
his friend, fell among robbers, who attacked him with drawn swords, and
being struck, either from pain, or in the hopes

<span id="page_379">p. 379</span>

of assistance, cried out. The dragon being a beast of acute hearing and
sharp vision, as soon as he heard the lad with whom he had been brought
up, gave a hiss in expression of his anger, and so struck them with
fear, that the trembling robbers dispersed in different directions, whom
having caught, he destroyed by a terrible death. Afterwards, having
cared for the wounds of his ancient friend, and escorted him through the
places infested with serpents, he returned to the spot where he himself
had been exposed—not showing any anger towards him on account of his
having been expelled into solitude, nor because ill-feeling men had
abandoned an old friend in danger.

##### BOOK VIII. ch. 11.

Hegemon, in his Dardanic verses, among other things mentions, concerning
the Thessalian Alevus, that a dragon conceived an affection for him.
Alevus possessed, as Hegemon states, golden hair, which I should call
yellow, and pastured cattle upon Ossa near the Thessalian spring called
Hæmonium \[as Anchises formerly did on Ida\]. A dragon of great size
fell violently in love with him, and used to crawl up gently to him,
kiss his hair, cleanse his face by licking it with his tongue, and bring
him various spoils from the chase.

##### BOOK X. ch. 25.

Beyond the Oasis of Egypt there is a great desert which extends for
seven days’ journey, succeeded by a region inhabited by the Cynoprosopi,
on the way to Æthiopia. These live by the chase of goats and antelopes.
They are black, with the head and teeth of a dog, of which animal, in
this connection, the mention is not to be looked upon as absurd, for
they lack the power of speech, and utter a shrill hissing sound, and
have a beard above and below the mouth like a dragon; their hands are
armed with strong and sharp nails, and the body is equally hairy with
that of dogs.

##### BOOK X. ch. 48.

Lycaonus, King of Emathia, had a son named Macedon, from whom eventually
the country was called, the old name becoming obsolete. Now, one of
Macedon's sons, named Pindus, was indued both with strength of mind and
innate probity, as well as a handsome person, whereas his other children
were constituted with mean minds and less vigorous bodies.

When, therefore, these latter perceived Pindus's virtue and other gifts,
they not only oppressed him, but in the end ruined themselves in
punishment for so great a crime.

Pindus, perceiving that plots were laid for him by his brothers,
abandoning the kingdom which he had received from his father, and

<span id="page_380">p. 380</span>

being robust and taking pleasure in hunting, not only took to it
himself, but led the others to follow his example.

Upon one occasion he was pursuing some young mules, and, spurring his
horse to the top of its powers, drew away a long distance from those who
were hunting with him. The mules passing into a deep cavern, escaped the
sight of their pursuer, and preserved themselves from danger. He leaped
down from the horse, which he tied to the nearest tree, and whilst he
was seeking with his utmost ability to discover the mules, and probing
the dens with his hands, heard a voice warning him not to touch the
mules. Wherefore, when he had long and carefully looked about, and could
see no one, he feared that the voice was the result of some greater
cause, and, mounting his horse, left the place. On the next day he
returned to the spot, but, deterred by the remembrance of the voice he
had heard, he did not enter the place where they had concealed
themselves.

When, therefore, he was cogitating as to who had warned him from
following his prey, and, as it appeared, was looking out for mountain
shepherds, or hunters, or some cottage—a dragon of unusual magnitude
appeared to him, creeping softly with a great part of its body, but
raising up its neck and head a little way, as if stretching himself—but
his neck and head were of such height as to equal that of the tallest
man.

Although Pindus was alarmed at the sight, he did not take to flight,
but, rallying himself from his great terror, wisely endeavoured to
appease the beast by giving him to eat the birds he had caught, as the
price of his redemption.

He, cajoled by the gifts and baits, or, as I may say, touched, left the
spot. This was so pleasing to Pindus, that, as an honourable man, and
grateful for his escape, he carried to the dragon, as a thank-offering,
whatever he could procure from his mountain chases, or by fowling.

Nor were these gifts from his booty without return, for fortune became
immediately more favourable to him, and he achieved success in all his
hunting, whether he pursued ground or winged game.

Wherefore he achieved a great reputation, both for finding and quickly
catching game.

Now, he was so tall that he caused terror from his bulk, while from his
excellent constitution and beautiful countenance he inflamed women with
so violent an affection for him, that the unmarried, as if they were
furious and bacchantes, joined his hunting expeditions; and married
women, under the guardianship of husbands, preferred passing their time
with him, to being reported among the number of goddesses. And, for the
most part, men also esteemed him highly, as his virtue and appearance
attracted universal admiration. His brothers only held a hostile and
inimical feeling towards him. Wherefore upon a certain

<span id="page_381">p. 381</span>

occasion they attacked him from an ambush, when he was hunting alone,
and having driven him into the defiles of a river close by, when he was
removed from all help, attacked him with drawn swords and slew him.

When the dragon heard its friend's outcries (for it is an animal with as
sharp a sense of hearing as it has quickness of vision), it issued from
its lair, and at once, casting its coils round the impious wretches,
suffocated them.

It did not desist from watching over its slain \[friend\] with the
utmost care, until those nearest related to the deceased came to him, as
he was lying on the ground; but nevertheless, although clad in proper
mourning, they were prevented through fear of the custodian from
approaching and interring the dead with proper rites, until it,
understanding from its profound and wonderful nature, that it was
keeping them at a distance, quietly departed from its guard and station
near the body, in order that it might receive the last tokens of esteem
from the bystanders without any interruption.

Splendid obsequies were performed, and the river where the murder was
effected received its name from the dead man.

It is therefore a peculiarity of these beasts to be grateful to those
from whom they may have received favours.

##### BOOK XI. ch. 2.—*Dragon Sacred to Apollo*.

The Epirotes, both at home and abroad, sacrifice to Apollo, and
solemnise with extreme magnificence a feast yearly in his honour, There
is a grove among them sacred to the god, and inclosed with a wall,
within which are dragons, pleasing to the god. Hither a sacred virgin
comes alone, naked, and presents food to the dragons. The Epirotes say
that these are descended from the Delphic python. If they regarded the
virgin ministering to them with favour, and took the food promptly, they
were believed to portend a fertile and healthful year; if they were rude
towards her, and would not accept the proffered food, some predicted, or
at least expected, the contrary for the coming year.

##### BOOK II. ch. 16.—*Dragon in Lavinium*.

There is a peculiar divination of the dragon, for in Lavinium, a town of
the Latins but in Lavinium, there is a large and dense sacred grove, and
near it the shrine of the Argolic Juno. Within the grove is a cave and
deep den, the lair of a dragon.

Sacred virgins enter this grove on stated days, who carry a barley cake
in their hands, with bandaged eyes. A certain divine afflatus leads them
accurately to the den, and gently, and step by step, they proceed
without hindrance, and as if their eyes were uncovered. If they are
virgins, the dragon admits the food as pure and fit for a deity.

<span id="page_382">p. 382</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> If otherwise, it
does not touch it, perceiving and divining them to be impure.

Ants, for the sake of cleansing the place, carry from the grove the cake
left by the vitiated virgin, broken into little pieces, so that they may
easily carry it. When this happens, it is perceived by the inhabitants,
and those who have entered are pointed out and examined, and whoever
proves to have forfeited her virginity is punished with the penalties
appointed by the laws.

"The masculine sex also seems to be privileged by nature among brutes,
inasmuch as the male dragon is distinguished by a crest and hairs, with
a beard."

##### BOOK XVI. ch. 39.

Onesicritus Astypalæus writes that there were two dragons in India
\[nurtured by an Indian dancer\], one of forty-six and the other of
eighty cubits, and that Alexander (Philip's son) earnestly endeavoured
to see them. It is affirmed in Egyptian books that, during the reign of
Philadelphus, two dragons were brought from Æthiopia into Philadelphia
alive, one forty, the other thirty cubits in magnitude.

Three were also brought in the time of King Evergetis, one nine and
another seven cubits. The Egyptians say that the third was preserved
with great care in the temple of Æsculapius.

It is also said that there are asps of four cubits in length. Those who
write the history of the affairs of Chios say that a dragon of extreme
magnitude was produced in a valley, densely crowded and gloomy with tall
trees, of the Mount Pelienæus in that island, whose hissing struck the
Chians with horror.

As none either of the husbandmen or shepherds dare, by approaching near,
estimate its magnitude, but from its hissing judged it to be a large and
formidable beast, at length its size became known by a remarkable
accident. For the trees of the valley being struck by a very strong
wind, and the branches ignited by the friction, a great fire thence
arising, embraced the whole spot, and surrounded the beast, which, being
unable to escape, was consumed by the ardour of the flame. By these
means all things were rendered visible in the denuded place, and the
Chians freed, from their alarms, came to investigate, and lighted on
bones of unusual magnitude, and an immense head, from which they were
enabled to conjecture its dimensions when living.

##### BOOK XI. ch. 17.

Homer was not rash in his line,

Terrible are the gods when they manifest themselves.

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> For the dragon,
while sacred and to be worshipped, has within himself something still
more of the divine nature of which it is better to remain in ignorance.

<span id="page_383">p. 383</span>

Indeed, a dragon received divine honours in a certain tower in Melita in
Egypt. He had his priests and ministers, his table and bowl. Every day
they filled the bowl with flour kneaded with honey, and went away;
returning on the following day, they found the bowl empty.

Upon one occasion, a man of illustrious birth, who entertained an
intense desire of seeing the dragon, having entered alone, and placed
the food, went out; and when the dragon commenced to feed at the table,
he opened suddenly and noisily the doors, which according to custom he
had closed.

The dragon indignantly left; but he who had desired to see him, to his
own destruction, being seized with an affliction of the mind, and having
confessed his crime, presently lost his speech, and shortly after died.

##### BOOK XII. ch. 39.

When Halia, the daughter of Sybasis, had entered the grove of Diana in
Phrygia, a certain sacred dragon of large size appeared and copulated
with her; whence the Ophiogenæ deduce the origin of their race.

##### BOOK XV. ch. 21.—*Concerning the Indian Dragon*.

Alexander (while he attacked or devastated some portions of India, and
also seized others), lighted on, among other numerous animals, a dragon,
which the Indians, because they considered it to be sacred, and
worshipped it with great reverence, in a certain cave, besought him with
many entreaties to let alone, which he agreed to. However, when the
dragon heard the noise made by the passing army (for it is an animal
endowed with a very acute sense of hearing as well as of vision), it
frightened and alarmed them all with a great hissing and blowing. It was
said to be seventy cubits long.

It did not, however, show the whole of itself, but only exposed its head
from the cave. Its eyes were said to have been of the size (and
rotundity) of a Macedonian shield.
