### CHAPTER V.

#### ON THE TRANSLATION OF MYTHS BETWEEN THE OLD AND THE NEW WORLD.

INTERCOURSE between various parts of the old world and the new was
probably much more intimate even three or four thousand years ago than
we, or at all events our immediate ancestors, have credited. The Deluge
Tablets referred to in another chapter contain items from which we
gather that sea-going vessels, well equipped and with skilled pilots,
were in vogue in the time of Noah, and there is wanting no better proof
of their seaworthiness than the fact that his particular craft was able
to weather a long-continued tempest which would probably have sunk the
greater part of those which keep the seas at the present time. The older
Chinese classics make constant allusions to maritime adventure, and the
discovery by Schliemann in ancient Troy <span
id="fr_112"></span>[\*](#fn_112.md) of vases with

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Chinese
inscriptions confirms the notion that, at that date at least, commercial
exchange was effected between these two widely-distant countries, either
directly or by transfer through different entrepôts.

A more striking example, and one which carries us back to a still
earlier epoch, will be afforded if the reported discovery of Chinese
vestigia in Egyptian tombs is confirmed by further investigation.

The fleets of King Solomon penetrated at least to India, and detached
squadrons <span id="fr_113"></span>[\*](#fn_113.md) probably coasted from
island to island along the Malay archipelago; while to descend by
gradation to modern times, we may quote the circumnavigation of Africa
by Hanno the Carthaginian, <span id="fr_114"></span>[†](#fn_114.md) the
discovery

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

of America prior to Columbus by the Chinese in the fifth century, from
the Asiatic side, and by the Norsemen under Leif Ericsson in the year
1001, from the European; and the anticipation of the so-called
discoveries of Van Diemen and Tasman by the voyages of Arab and other
navigators, from whose records El Edrisi, <span
id="fr_115"></span>[\*](#fn_115.md) in the twelfth century, was enabled to
indicate the existence of New Guinea, and, I think, of the northern
coast of Australia. For although the identity with Mexico of the country
called Fu-sang, visited prior to A.D. 499

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

by the Buddhist priest Hoei-shiu, has been disputed, yet the arguments
in favour of it seem to preponderate. These were adduced primarily by
Deguignes, and subsequently by C. F. Neumann, Leland and others, and are
based on the facts stated in the short narrative in regard to distance,
description of the Maguey plant, or great aloe, <span
id="fr_116"></span>[\*](#fn_116.md) the absence of iron, and abundance of
copper, gold, and silver.

While there can be little question that the islands and land of Wák Wák
are respectively some of the Sunda islands, New Guinea, and the adjacent
portion of Australia, it does not appear to have struck any of the
commentators on this question that the name islands of Wák Wák "may be
assumed to signify simply Bird of Paradise islands." Wallace, in his
Malay Archipelago, emphatically remarks that in the interior of the
forests of New Guinea the most striking sound is the cry "Wok Wok " of
the great Bird of Paradise, and we may therefore reasonably speculate on
the bird having been known as the Wok Wok, and the islands as the
Wok Wok islands, just as we ourselves use the imitative names of Cuckoo,
Morepork, or Hoopoe for birds, or Snake islands, Ape Hill, &c. for
places.

This view is to an extent strengthened by Wák Wák being the home of the
lovely maiden captured by Hasan (in the charming story of Hasan of El
Basrah in the *Arabian Nights*), after she had divested herself of her
bird skin, and to which he had to make so weary a pilgrimage from island
to island, and sea to sea, in search of her after her escape from him.
It is evident that among the wonders related by navigators of islands so
remote and unfrequented, not the least would be the superavian
loveliness of the Birds of Paradise, and from the exaggerated narratives
of travellers may have

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

arisen the beautiful fable incorporated in the *Arabian Nights*, as well
as that other recorded by Eesa or Moosa the son of El Mubarak Es
Serafee. <span id="fr_117"></span>[\*](#fn_117.md) "Here, too, is a tree
that bears fruit like women with bodies, eyes, limbs, &c. like those of
women; they have beautiful faces, and are suspended by the hair; they
come forth from integuments like large leathern bags; and when they feel
the air and the sun they cry out 'Wák Wák' until their hair is cut, and
when it is cut they die; and the people of these islands understand
their cry, and augur ill from it." This, after all, is not more absurd
than the story of the origin of the barnacle duck, extant and believed
in Europe until within the last century or so.

El Edrisi, who, in common with the geographers of the period, believed
in a great antarctic continent, after describing Sofala with its mines
of gold, abundance of iron, &c., jumps at once to the mainland of
Wák Wák, which he describes as possessing two towns situated on a great
gulf (Carpentaria?), and a savage population. <span
id="fr_118"></span>[†](#fn_118.md)

The two small towns may very well have been encampments of the
aborigines, or trading stations of Malay merchants.

It may be noted that this identification of Wák Wák is in opposition to
the view entertained by some commentators; for example, Professor de
Goeje of Leyden has recently identified the Silâ islands (which had
previously been considered

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

as being Japan) with Corea, and Wák Wák with Japan; but this does not
agree with El Edrisi's account of the people being black, unclothed, and
living on fish, shell, and tortoises (turtles), without gold, commerce,
ships, or beasts of burden. Elsewhere El Edrisi says the women are
entirely naked, and only wear combs of ivory ornamented with mother of
pearl.

Lane thinks the Arabs applied the name of Wák Wák to all the islands
with which they were acquainted on the east and south-east of Borneo. Es
Serafee, beside the details given in a previous note, also says, "From
one of these islands of Wák Wák there issueth a great torrent like
pitch, which floweth into the sea, and the fish are burnt thereby, and
float upon the water." And Hasan, in the story quoted above, has, in
order to reach the last of the seven islands of Wák Wák, to pass over
the third island, the land of the Jánn, "where by reason of the
vehemence of the cries of the Jánn, and the rising of the flames about,
of the sparks and the smoke from their mouths, and the harsh sounds from
their throats, and their insolence, they will obstruct the way before
us," &c. &c. I think that in each of these latter instances, the
volcanic islands of Java, and other of the Sunda islands are indicated.

The information in our possession is as yet too meagre to permit of our
indulging in any profitable consideration of the sources from which
originated those nations which peopled America during the very early
pre-traditional ages, of which geological evidence is accumulating
daily. In fact, the theories on this point have advanced so little
beyond the limits of speculation that I feel it unnecessary to do more
than quote one of them, as summarized in the ensuing extract. "Professor
Flowers, in remarking upon recent palæontological investigations, which
prove that an immense number of forms of terrestrial animals that were
formerly supposed to be peculiar to the Old World are abundant in

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

the New; and that many, such as the horse, rhinoceros, and the camel,
are more numerous in species and varieties in the latter, infers that
the means of land communication must have been very different to what it
is now, and that it is quite as likely that Asiatic man may have been
derived from America as the reverse, or both may have had their source
in a common centre, in some region of the earth now covered with
sea." <span id="fr_119"></span>[\*](#fn_119.md)

The most commonly accepted theory with regard to the origin of those who
have peopled the American continent, within the limits of tradition, is
that they are of Asiatic descent, and that the migration has been
effected in comparatively recent times by way of Behring Straits, and
supplemented by chance passages from Southern Asia by way of the
Polynesian islands, or from the north of Africa, across the Atlantic.
There are, however, some who elaborate Professor Flowers’ suggestion,
and contend, in opposition to the more generally received opinion, that
the peopling of the present countries of the Old World has in fact been
effected from the New.

For instance, a proficient Aztec scholar, Senor Altamirano <span
id="fr_120"></span>[†](#fn_120.md) of Mexico, argues that the Aztecs were a
race, originating in the unsubmerged parts of America, as old as the
Asiatics themselves, and that Asia may in fact have been peopled from
Mexico; while Mr. E. J. Elliott, in quoting him, says: "From the ruins
recently found, the most northern of any yet discovered, the indications
of improved architecture, the work of different ages, can be traced in a
continual chain to Mexico, when they culminate in massive and imposing
structures, thus giving some proof by circumstantial evidence to
Altamirano's reasoning."

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

Again. "Dr. Rudolf Falb <span id="fr_121"></span>[\*](#fn_121.md) discovers
that the language spoken by the Indians in Peru and Bolivia, especially
in Quichua and Aymara, exhibits the most astounding affinities with the
Semitic languages, and particularly with the Arabic—in which tongue Dr.
Falb himself has been skilled from his boyhood. Following up the links
of this discovery, he has first found a connecting link with the Aryan
roots, and, secondly, has arrived face to face with the surprising
revelation that the Semitic roots are universally Aryan. The common
stems of all the variants are found in their purest condition in Quichua
and Aymara, from which fact Dr. Falb derives the conclusion that the
high plains of Peru and Bolivia must be regarded as the point of exit of
the present human race."

On the other hand, Mr. E. B. Tylor, in the course of an article upon
Backgammon among the Aztecs, <span id="fr_122"></span>[†](#fn_122.md) which
he argues must have reached them from Asia, and very likely through
Mexico, points out that the myths and religion of the North American
tribes contain many fancies well known to Asia, which they were hardly
likely to have hit upon independently, and which they had not learned
from white men: "Such as the quaint belief that the world is a monstrous
tortoise floating on the waters; and an idea which the Sioux have in
common with the Tartars, that it is sinful to chop or poke with a sharp
instrument the burning log on the fire." He quotes Alexander von
Humboldt as having "argued years ago that the Mexicans did and believed
things which were at once so fanciful and so like the fancies of the
Asiatics that there must have been communication. Would two nations," he
asks, "have taken independently to forming calendars of days and years
by repeating and combining cycles of animals, such as tiger, dog, ape,
hare, &c.? Would they have developed

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

independently similar astrological fancies about these signs governing
the periods they began, and being influential each over a particular
limb or organ of men's bodies? Would they, again, have evolved
separately out of this consciousness the myths of the world and its
inhabitants having, at the end of several successive periods, been
destroyed by elemental catastrophes?"

He adds, "It may very well have been the same agency which transported
to Mexico the art of bronze-making, the computation of time by periods
of dogs and apes, the casting of nativity, and the playing of
backgammon."

Then, again, we have the theory of those, now indeed few in number, who
hold that the present Indian inhabitants of America were a distinctly
indigenous race. Lord Kaimes, in his *Sketches of the History of Man*,
says, "I venture still further, which is to conjecture that America has
not been peopled from any part of the Old World." Voltaire had preceded
him in this line of argument, relying on ridicule rather than on reason.
"The same persons that readily admit that the beavers of Canada are of
Canadian origin, assert that the men must have come there in boats, and
that Mexico must have been peopled by some of the descendants of
Magog." <span id="fr_123"></span>[\*](#fn_123.md)

Missionaries of various sects have endeavoured to identify the Red man
with the lost ten tribes. Adair conceived the language of the Southern
Indians to be a corruption of Hebrew, and the Jesuit Lafitan, in his
history of the savages of America, maintained that the Caribee language
was radically Hebrew.

Mr. John Josselyn, <span id="fr_124"></span>[†](#fn_124.md) in an account
of the Mohawks, states that their language is a dialect of the Tartars,
and Dr. Williamson, in his history of North Carolina, considers it

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

can hardly be questioned that the Indians of South America are descended
from a class of the Hindoos in the southern part of Asia.

Amongst others, Captain Don Antonio del Rio, who described the ruins of
an ancient city in Guatemala, believed that they were the relics of a
civilization founded by Phœnician colonists who had crossed the Atlantic
ocean; and yet another theory is propounded by Mr. Knox, <span
id="fr_125"></span>[\*](#fn_125.md) who considers the extinct Guanches,
formerly inhabiting the Canary and Cape de Verde islands, to have
closely resembled the Egyptians in certain particulars. He goes on to
observe, "Now cross the Atlantic, and in a nearly parallel zone of the
earth, or at least in one not far removed, we stumble all at once upon
the ruined cities of Copan and Central America. To our astonishment,
notwithstanding the breadth of the Atlantic, vestiges, of a nature not
to be doubted, of a thoroughly Egyptian character
reappear—hieroglyphics, monolithic temples, pyramids; who erected these
monuments on the American continent? Perhaps at some remote period the
continents were not so far apart, they might have been united, thus
forming a zone or circle of the earth occupied by a pyramid-building
people."

It is not impossible that all of these theories may be correct, and that
numerous migrations may have been made at various periods by different
nations, the most facile would of course be that from North-Eastern Asia
by way of the Aleutian islands, for, as the author of Fu-sang well
remarks, a sailor in an open boat might cross from Asia to America by
that route in summer time, and hardly ever be out of sight of land; and
this in a part of the sea generally abounding in fish, as is proved by
the fishermen who inhabit many of these islands, on which fresh water is
always to be found. But it is more than likely that the direct route,

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

from the islands of Japan to the coast of California or Mexico, was also
occasionally followed, voluntarily or involuntarily, by mariners
impelled by enterprise, religious motives, or stress of weather.

Colonel B. Kennon, as an evidence of the possibility of junks performing
long ocean voyages, adduces the instance of a Japanese junk picked up by
an American whaler two thousand three hundred miles south-east of Japan,
and of others which had drifted among the Aleutian islands nearly
half-way over to San Francisco; and in noting the resemblance and
probable co-origin of the Sandwich Islanders with the Japanese, he
adverts to the "ancient and confirmed habit of both Japanese and Chinese
of taking women to sea with them, or of traders keeping their families
on board, which would fully account for the population of those
islands," or, to extend the argument, of points on the American
continent. The Jewish element might easily be introduced through this
channel, for the occasional admixture of Jewish blood both among the
Chinese and Japanese is so strongly marked, as to have induced some
authors to contend for the absolute descent of the latter people at
least from Jewish parentage.

It must also be remembered that the waters of both the North and South
Pacific are peculiarly favourable to the navigation of small craft, and
that Captain Bligh, after the mutiny on board the *Bounty*, was able to
safely perform a journey of two thousand miles in an open boat; while
all the islands both in North and South Polynesia must necessarily have
been gradually peopled by the drifting over the ocean of stray canoes.

Again, as the tradition of the existence of a large continent west of
the African coast was extant amongst the Egyptian priests long before
the days of Solon, and, as I shall show hereafter, among the
Carthaginians and Tyrrhenians, it is, I think, more than probable that
both Phœnician

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

and Egyptian mariners, either acting under a Royal Commission, or
influenced by mercantile considerations, would endeavour to discover it,
and, as in the case of Columbus, would have no difficulty in stretching
across the Atlantic before a fair trade wind, though they might be less
successful than him on their return.

The possibility of the existence of a large island or continent, midway
between the Old and New World, within the traditional period, is
included in the important question, which is still *sub judice* amongst
geologists, whether the general disposition of land and water has or has
not been variable during past ages. Sir Charles Lyell held the first
view, and was of opinion <span id="fr_126"></span>[\*](#fn_126.md) that
complete alternations of the positions of continent and ocean had
repeatedly occurred in geological time.

The opposite idea has been suggested at various dates by eminent
authorities, suggested rather than sustained by elaborate arguments,
until recently, when the question has been re-examined by Mr. Wallace
and Dr. Carpenter.

The former, in that chapter of island life devoted to the permanence of
continents, dwells forcibly upon Dr. Darwin's inference from the paucity
of oceanic islands affording fragments of either Palæozoic or Secondary
formations "that *perhaps* during the Palæozoic and Secondary periods
neither continents nor continental islands existed where our oceans now
extend; for, had they existed, Palæozoic and Secondary formations would
in all probability have been accumulated from sediment derived from
their wear and tear; and these would have been at least partially
upheaved by the oscillations of level which must have intervened during
these enormously long periods. If, then, we may infer anything from
these facts, we may infer that, where our oceans now extend, oceans have
extended from the remotest period of which we

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

have any record; and, on the other hand, that where continents now
exist, large tracts of land have existed, subjected no doubt to great
oscillations of level, since the Cambrian period."

I am not aware whether Dr. Darwin has expressed himself more
authoritatively on this point in later works, or whether the whole
question has been discussed in detail otherwise than by Mr. Wallace in
the chapter referred to, in which he quotes what must, I think, after
all, only be taken in the light of a suggestion as an auxiliary to the
powerful arguments which he himself has enunciated in favour of a
similar conclusion. There is no doubt that the paucity of any but
volcanic or coralline islands throughout the greatest extent of existing
oceans has a certain but not absolute significance, so far as recent
geological epochs are concerned.

There is another line of reasoning, debated by Mr. Wallace, based on the
formation of the Palæozoic and Secondary strata from the waste of broken
continents and islands occupying generally the site of the existing
continents, and separated by insignificant distances of inland sea or
extensions from the adjacent oceans. It is soundly based on their
lithological structure, as generally indicative of a littoral and
shallow water origin, but it seems to me to be only positive so far as
it shows that, throughout geological time, some land has existed
somewhere within the limits of the present upheaval, and simply negative
as to what may or may not have been the condition of what are now the
great ocean spaces of the world. Indeed, it would at first sight seem
only reasonable to infer, that the very depressions which caused the
inundations of Europe and Asia, during the deposition of any important
formation, would imply a corresponding elevation elsewhere, in order
that the same relative areas of land and water might be maintained.

This view has, however, been reduced in its proportions by Dr.
Carpenter, who has levelled the results of the recent

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

researches by the *Challenger* expedition against the advocates of the
intermutations of land and ocean, and, in pursuing another line of
reasoning from Mr. Wallace, has estimated the solid contents of ocean
and land above the sea-level respectively, as bearing the proportion of
thirty-six to one. So that, supposing all the existing land of the globe
to sink down to the sea-level, this subsidence would be balanced by the
elevation of only one thirty-sixth part of the existing ocean floor from
its present depth to the same level.

It must be admitted that the balance of argument was until lately
considerably against the former existence of the country of Atlantis,
whose ghostly outlines, however, we could almost imagine to be sketched
out by faint contours in the chart illustrative of the North Atlantic
portion of the Challenger investigations. But it was not so overwhelming
as to entitle us to ignore the story entirely as a fable. I do not
conceive it impossible that some centrally situated and perhaps volcanic
island may once have existed, sufficiently important to have served as
the basis of simple legends, which, under the enchantment of distance
and time became metamorphosed and enriched.

Mr. A. R. Grote suggests that it is simply a myth founded on the
observation of low-lying clouds in a sun-flushed sky, which gave the
appearance like islands on a golden sea.

Mr. Donelly, on the other hand, in a very exhaustive and able
volume <span id="fr_127"></span>[\*](#fn_127.md), contends first, that
Atlantis actually existed, and secondly, that it was the origin of our
present civilization, that its kings are represented by the gods of
Greek mythology, and that its destruction originated our Deluge story.

The well-known story is contained in an epic of Plato, of which two
fragments only remain, found in two dialogues (the Timæus and the
Critias). Critias is represented as telling an old-world story, handed
down in his family from

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

his great-grandfather Dropidas, who had heard it from Solon, who had it
from the Egyptian priests of Sais. <span
id="fr_128"></span>[\*](#fn_128.md)

Ælian, again, contains an extract from Theophrastus, who wrote in the
time of Alexander the Great, which can hardly imply anything else than
an acquaintance with America. It is in the form of a dialogue between
Midas the Phrygian and Silenus.

The latter informs Midas that Europe, Asia, and Africa were but islands
surrounded on all sides by sea, but that there was a continent situated
beyond these which was of immense dimensions, even without limits, and
that it was so luxuriant as to produce animals of prodigious magnitude.
That there men grew to double the size of themselves, and that they
lived to a far greater age, that they had many cities, and their usages
and laws were different from their own; that in one city there was more
than a million of inhabitants, and that gold and silver were there in
vast quantities.

Diodorus Siculus gives an account of what could only have been the
mainland of America, or one of the West Indian islands; it is as
follows.

“After cursorily mentioning the islands within the Pillars of Hercules,
let us treat of those further ones in the open ocean, for towards Africa
there is a very large island in the great ocean sea, situated many days'
sail from Libya towards the west.

“Its soil is fruitful, a great part rising in mountains, but still with
no scarcity of level expanse, which excels in pleasantness, for
navigable rivers flow through and irrigate it. Gardens abound, stored
with various trees and numerous orchards, intersected by pleasant
streams.

“The towns are adorned with sumptuous edifices, and

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span>

drinking taverns, beautifully situated in gardens, are everywhere met
with; as the convenient situation of these largely invites to pleasure,
they are frequented during the summer season.

“The mountain region possesses numerous and large forests, and various
kinds of fruitful trees. It everywhere presents deep valleys and springs
suitable for mountain recreations.

“Indeed the whole of this island is watered with springs of sweet water,
which gives rise not merely to the pleasure of its inhabitants, but also
to an accession of their health and strength.

“Hunting furnishes all kinds of game, the abundance of which in their
banquets leaves nothing to be desired.

“Moreover, the sea which washes against this island abounds with fish,
since the ocean, from its nature everywhere, affords a variety of fish.

“Finally, the temperature is very genial, from which it results that the
trees bear fruit throughout the greater part of the year.

“Lastly, it excels so much in felicity as to resemble the habitations of
the gods rather than of men.

“Formerly it was unknown, on account of the remoteness of its situation
from the rest of the world, but accident disclosed its position. The
Phœnicians have been in the habit of making frequent passages, for the
sake of commerce, from the very oldest dates, from whence it resulted
that they were the founders of many of the African colonies, and of not
a few of those European ones situated to the west; and when they had
yielded to the idea which had entered their minds, of enriching
themselves greatly, they passed out beyond the Pillars of Hercules into
the sea which is called the Ocean, and they first founded a city called
Gades, on the European peninsula, and near the straits of the Pillars
\[of Hercules\] in which, when others had flocked to it, they instituted
a

<span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

sumptuous temple to Hercules. This temple has been held in the utmost
veneration both in ancient times and during later periods up to the
present day; therefore many Romans of illustrious nobility and
reputation pronounce their vows to that god, and happily discharge their
obligations.

“The Phœnicians for this reason continued their exploration beyond the
Pillars, and when they were sailing along the African coast, being
carried off by a tempest to a distant part of the ocean, were driven by
the violence of the storm, after a period of many days, to the island of
which I have spoken, and having first acquainted themselves with its
nature and pleasing characters, introduced it to the notice of others.
On that account, the Tyrrhenians, also obtaining the empire of the sea,
determined on a colony there, but the Carthaginians prevented them, both
because they feared lest many of their citizens, being allured by the
advantages of the island, might migrate there, and because they wished
to have a refuge prepared for themselves against a sudden stroke of
fortune, if by chance the Carthaginian Republic should receive any
deadly blow, for they contemplated that they would be able, while yet
powerful at sea, to transport themselves and their families to the
island unknown to the victors.” <span id="fr_129"></span>[\*](#fn_129.md)

Among the many proofs which may be cited of community of origin between
the Asiatics and certainly a large proportion of the American population
is the practice of scalping enemies, quoted by Herodotus as prevalent
amongst the Scythians, and universally existing amongst all tribes of
North American Indians; the discovery of jade ornaments amongst Mexican
remains, and the general esteem in which that material is held by the
Chinese; the use of the Quipos among the Peruvians, and the assertion in
the *I-king*, or Book

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

of Change, one of the oldest of the Chinese Classics, that "The ancients
knotted cords to express their meaning, but in the next age the sages
renounced the custom and adopted a system of written characters;" <span
id="fr_130"></span>[\*](#fn_130.md) the discovery of the meander pattern
among Peruvian relics, and the common use of this ornamentation on
Chinese vases and tripods, at dates long preceding the Trojan era, in
which it is commonly supposed to have originated; the similarity of the
features of Chinese, and other Mongols, with those of various Indian
tribes; the resemblance of masks and various other remains to Chinese
patterns discovered recently by Desirée de Charnay in Central America;
and the reserve and stolid demeanour of both races. A good illustration
of this is afforded by the story told of the celebrated statesman Sieh
Ngan (A.D. 320-385), in Mayer's *Chinese Reader's Manual*; it could be
imagined to apply to any Indian sachem.

It is related of Sieh Ngan that, at the time when the capital was
menaced by the advancing forces of Fukien, he sat one day over a game of
chess with a friend, when a despatch was handed to him, which he calmly
read and then continued the game. On being asked what the news was, he
replied: "It is merely an announcement that my young people have beaten
the enemy." The intelligence was, in fact, of the decisive rout of the
invaders by the army under his brother Sieh She and his nephew Sieh
Hüan. Only when retired within the seclusion of his private apartments
did he give himself up to an outburst of joy. The very expression "my
young people" is the equivalent of "my young men" which the Indian chief
would have employed.

A singular custom prevails among the Petivaces, an Indian

<span id="page_155">p. 155</span>

tribe of Brazil. <span id="fr_131"></span>[\*](#fn_131.md) "When they are
delivered of a child, and ought to have all the ceremony and attendance
proper to a lying-in woman, the husband presently lies down in his
hammock (as if he had been brought to bed himself), and all his wives
and neighbours come about and serve him. This is a pleasant fancy
indeed, that the woman must take all the pains to bring the child into
the world, and then the man lie down and gruntle upon it."

Compare with this the account given by Marco Polo of the same custom
prevalent among the Miau-tze, or aborigines of China, as distinguished
from their present occupants. Their reduction to submission is recorded
in the early works on the country.

"Proceeding five days’ journey, in a westerly direction from Karazan,
you enter the province of Kardandan belonging to the dominion of the
great Khan, and of which the principal city is named Vochang (probably
Yung-chang in the western part of Yunnan). These people have the
following singular usage. As soon as a woman has been delivered of a
child, and rising from her bed, has washed and swathed the infant, her
husband immediately takes the place she has left, has the child beside
him, and nurses it for forty days. In the meantime the friends and
relations of the family pay to him their visits of congratulation;
whilst the woman attends to the business of the house, carries victuals
and drink to the husband in his bed, and suckles the infant at his
side." <span id="fr_132"></span>[†](#fn_132.md)

We find a reference in *Hudibras* to this grotesque practice, in which
it is imputed, but erroneously, to the Chinese themselves, and it
reappears on the western side of Europe, among those singular people the
Basques, who have their

<span id="page_156">p. 156</span>

own especial Deluge tradition, and use a language which, according to
Humboldt, approaches some of the dialects of the North American Indians
more nearly than any other. They profess to trace the custom up to Aïtor
or Noah, whose wife bore a son to him when they were in exile, and,
being afraid to stay by herself for fear of being discovered and
murdered, bade her husband take care of the child, while she went out to
search for food and firing.

The change of name which prevails among the Chinese and Japanese in both
sexes, at different periods of life, is also found upon the other
continent, <span id="fr_133"></span>[\*](#fn_133.md) where males and
females when they come to years of discretion do not retain the names
they had when young, and, if they do any remarkable deed, assume a new
name upon it.

Less importance is to be attached to the coincidence of sun worship,
Deluge tradition, and the preservation of ancestral ashes. <span
id="fr_134"></span>[†](#fn_134.md) These, though probably not, might have
been indigenous; but we can hardly conceive this of serpent worship,
which Mr. Fergusson suggests arose among a people of Turanian origin,
from which it spread to every country or land of the Old World in which
a Turanian settled. The coincidence between the serpent mounds of North
America and such an one as is described by M. Phené in Argyllshire <span
id="fr_135"></span>[‡](#fn_135.md) is remarkable; and still more so is that
between the Mexican myth of the fourfold destruction of the world by
fire and water, with those current among the Egyptians and that of the
four ages in the Hindu mythology.

Another coincidence, although perhaps of minor value, will be seen in
the dresses of the soldiers of China and Mexico, as noted in the
passages annexed. Thus, in our

<span id="page_157">p. 157</span>

own time, the Chinese soldiers wear a dress resembling the tiger skin,
and the cap, which nearly covers the face, is formed to represent the
head of a tiger"; <span id="fr_136"></span>[\*](#fn_136.md) while the
Mexican warriors, according to Spanish historians, "wore enormous wooden
helmets in the form of a tiger's head, the jaws of which were armed with
the teeth of this animal." <span id="fr_137"></span>[†](#fn_137.md)

Mr. C. Wolcott-Brooks, in an address to the California Academy of
Science, has pointed out that, according to Chinese annals, Tai Ko Fo
Kee, the great stranger-king, ruled the kingdom of China, and that he is
always represented in pictures with two small horns like those
associated with the representation of Moses. He and his successors are
said to have introduced into China "picture writing" like that in use in
Central America at the time of the Spanish conquest. Now there has been
found at Copan, in Central America, a figure strikingly like the Chinese
symbol of Fo Kee, with his two horns. "Either," says Mr. Brooks, "one
people learned from the other, or both acquired their forms from a
common source."

In reviewing all these cases we cannot fail to perceive that early and
frequent communication must have taken place between the two worlds, and
that the myths of one have probably been carried with them by the
migrants to the other.

### Footnotes

<span id="fn_112"></span>[137:\*](mm08.htm#fr_112.md) Dr. Schliemann found
a vase in the lowest strata of his excavations at Hissarlik with an
inscription in an unknown language.

Six years ago the Orientalist E. Burnouf declared it to be in Chinese,
for which he was generally laughed at at the time.

The Chinese ambassador at Berlin, Li Fang-pau, has read and translated
the inscription, which states that three pieces of linen gauze are
packed in the vase for inspection.

The Chinese ambassador fixes the date of the inscription at about 1200
B.C., and further states that the unknown characters so frequently
occurring on the terra cotta are also in the Chinese language, which
would show that at this remote period commercial intercourse existed
between China and the eastern shores of Asia Minor and Greece.—*Pop.
Sci. Monthly*, No. 98, p. 176, June 1880.

<span id="fn_113"></span>[138:\*](mm08.htm#fr_113.md) Pierre Bergeron
suggests that Solomon's fleets, starting from Ezion-geber (subsequently
Berenice and now Alcacu), arrived at Babelmandeb, and then divided, one
portion going to Malacca, Sumatra, or Java, the other to Sofala, round
Africa, and returning by way of Cadiz and the Mediterranean to Joppa.

<span id="fn_114"></span>[138:†](mm08.htm#fr_114.md) There are various
accounts of the circumnavigation of Africa in old times. For example,
Herodotus (*Melpomene*, 42): "Libya shows itself to be surrounded by
water, except so much of it as borders upon Asia. Neco, King of Egypt,
was the first whom we know of that proved this; he, when he had ceased
digging the canal leading from the Nile to the Arabian gulf, sent
certain Phœnicians in ships with orders to sail back through the pillars
of Hercules into the Northern Sea, and so to return to Egypt. The
Phœnicians accordingly, setting out from the Red Sea, navigated the
Southern Sea; when autumn came they went ashore, and sowed the land, by
whatever part of Libya they happened to be sailing, and waited for
harvest; then, having reaped the corn, they put to sea again. When two
years had thus passed, in the third, having doubled the pillars of
Hercules, they arrived in Egypt, and related what to me does not seem
credible, but may to others, that as they sailed round Libya, they had
the sun on the right hand." Again, Pliny tells us (Book ii. chap. lxvii,
Translation by Bostock and Riley), "While the power of Carthage was at
its height, Hanno published an account of a voyage which he made from
Gades to the extremity of Arabia: besides, we learn from Cornelius
Nepos, that one Eudoxus, a contemporary of his, when he was flying from
King Lathyrus, set out from the Arabian Gulf, and was carried as far as
Gades. And long <span id="page_139">p. 139</span> before him, Cœlius
Antipater informs us, that he had seen a person who had sailed from
Spain to Ethiopia for the purposes of trade. The same Cornelius Nepos,
when speaking of the northern circumnavigation, tells us that Q.
Metellus Celer, the colleague of L. Afranius in the consulship, but then
proconsul in Gaul, had a present made to him by the King of the Suevi,
of certain Indians, who, sailing from India for the purposes of
commerce, had been driven by tempests into Germany."

Ptolemy Lathyrus commenced his reign 117 B.C. and reigned for thirty-six
years. Cornelius Nepos is supposed to have lived in the century previous
to the Christian era, and Cœlius Antipater to have been born in the
middle of the second century B.C.

<span id="fn_115"></span>[139:\*](mm08.htm#fr_115.md) Edrisi compiled,
under the instruction of Roger, King of Sicily, Italy, Lombardy, and
Calabria, an exhaustive geographical treatise comprising information
derived from numerous preceding works, principally Arabic, and from the
testimony of all the geographers of the day.

"Ce pays touch celui de Wac Wac où sont deux villes misérables et mal
peuplées à cause de la rareté des subsistances et du peu de ressource en
tout genre; l’une se nomme Derou et l’autre Nebhena; dans son voisinage
est un grand bourg nommé Da’rgha. Les naturels sont noirs, de figure
hideuse, de complexion difformé; leur langage est une espèce de
sifflement. Ils sont absolument nus et sont peu visités (par les
étrangers). Ils vivent de poissons, de coquillages, et de tortues. Ils
sont (comme il vient d’être dit) voisins de l’ile de Wac Wac dont nous
reparlerons, s’il plait à Dieu. Chacun de ces pays et de ces iles est
situé sur un grand golfe, on n’y trouve ni or, ni commerce, ni navire,

seventy to one hundred and fifty miles from Port Darwin. There is gold
on Victoria River.

Jacks, in his report to the Queensland Government, published March or
April of 1880, reports no paying gold in Yorke's peninsula.

One hundred miles from Port Darwin and twenty-six miles from the
Adelaide River a new rush occurred in July 1880: nuggets from 70 to 80
oz. of common occurrence; one found weighed 187 oz.
