Take a Victorian scifi premise, say, a trip to the center of the earth,
and by the way, it's hollow. Add a tale of a soul condemned by the
Illuminati to a perilous underground quest to find the Goddess of Love
(spoiler alert: spell Aphrodite backwards). Top it off with a wild magic
mushroom trip. That's Etidorhpa!

This may be the very source of the 'adepts living in hollow earth who
abduct humans' meme, later developed by [Ray
Palmer](../../ufo/irl/index.md), and many others. The book is larded with
long passages of speculative science. The structure of the hollow earth
and the effects of gravitation at various places is much better worked
out than some of the 'nonfiction' hollow earth books (e.g.
[Reed](../potp/index) or [Gardner](../jei/index).md).

The journey of 'I-am-the-man' is a not-so-subtle allegory of spiritual
progression to being a disembodied adept. Along the way he loses his
youth, loses sunlight, becomes weightless, stops breathing, can hear
without ears, then his heart stops, ... and still he lives. Each of this
steps is symbolic of a progression to a more ethereal plane of
existence.

At times, the narrative recursion is three levels deep. This is an
acquired taste. L. Sprague de Camp called Etidorpha 'unreadable.' Modern
readers accustomed to consuming multiple narrative streams at the same
time (i.e. channel hopping), with long recursive breaks (i.e.
commercials) might do better.

Except for the titular Etidorhpa, there are no female characters. And
she only appears briefly in a hallucination. Why such a small part in
the book? Other genre novels, such as [Atlantida](../../atl/ant/index.md)
and [The Lost Continent](../../atl/tlc/index.md), are driven by strong
female characters. And once the main character is inside the hollow
earth, it just halts. He doesn't even get to meet Etidorhpa again.
Whether the author ran out of steam, or the ending was only supposed to
be implied, is unknown.

--J.B. Hare, Dec. 2, 2007.
