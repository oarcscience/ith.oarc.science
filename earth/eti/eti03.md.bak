### PREFACE TO THIS EDITION.

The foot-note on page [160](eti31.htm#page_160.md), with the connected
matter, has awakened considerable interest in the life and fate of
Professor Daniel Vaughn.

The undersigned has received many letters imparting interesting
information relating to Professor Vaughn's early history, and asking
many questions concerning a man of whose memory the writer thinks so
highly but whose name is generally unknown.

Indeed, as some have even argued that the author of Etidorhpa has no
personal existence, the words John Uri Lloyd being a *nom de plume*, so
others have accepted Professor Vaughn to have been a fanciful creation
of the mystical author.

Professor Daniel Vaughn was one whose life lines ran nearly parallel
with those of the late Professor C. S. Rafinesque, whose eventful
history has been so graphically written by Professor R. Ellsworth Call.
The cups of these two talented men were filled with privation's
bitterness, and in no other place has this writer known the phrase "The
Deadly Parallel" so aptly appropriate. Both came to America, scholars,
scientists by education; both traveled through Kentucky, teachers; both
gave freely to the world, and both suffered in their old age, dying in
poverty—Rafinesque perishing in misery in Philadelphia and Vaughn in
Cincinnati.

Daniel Vaughn was not a myth, and, in order that the reader may know
something of the life and fate of this eccentric man, an appendix has
been added to this edition of Etidorhpa, in which a picture of his face
is shown as the writer knew it in life, and in which brief mention is
made of his record.

The author here extends his thanks to Professor Richard Nelson and to
Father Eugene Brady for their kindness to the readers of Etidorhpa and
himself, for to these gentlemen is due the credit of the appended
historical note.

J. U. L.
