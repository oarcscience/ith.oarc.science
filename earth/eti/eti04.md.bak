### A VALUABLE AND UNIQUE LIBRARY.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
From the Pharmaceutical Era, New York, October, 1894.  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In Cincinnati is one of the most famous botanical and pharmacal
libraries in the world, and by scientists it is regarded as ail
invaluable store Of knowledge upon those branches of medical science. So
famous is it that one of the most noted pharmacologists and chemists of
Germany, on a recent trip to this country, availed himself of its rich
collection as a necessary means of completing his study in the line of
special drug history. When it is known that he has devoted a life of
nearly eighty years to the study of pharmacology, and is an emeritus
professor in the famous University of Strassburg, the importance of his
action will be understood and appreciated. We refer to Prof. Frederick
Flueckiger, who, in connection with Daniel Hanbury, wrote
Pharmacographia and other standard works. Attached to the library is an
herbarium, begun by Mr. Curtis Gates Lloyd when a schoolboy, in which
are to be found over 30,000 specimens of the flora of almost every
civilized country on the globe. The collections are the work of two
brothers, begun when in early boyhood. In money they are priceless, yet
it is the intention of the founders that they shall be placed; either
before or at their death, in some college or university where all
students may have access to them without cost or favor, and their wills
are already made to this end, although the institution to receive the
bequest is not yet selected. Eager requests have been made that they be
sent to foreign universities, where only, some persons believe, they can
receive the appreciation they deserve.

The resting place of this collection is a neat three-story house at 204
West Court street, rebuilt to serve as a library building. On the door
is a plate embossed with the name Lloyd, the patronymic of the brothers
in question. They are John Uri and Curtis Gates Lloyd. Every hour that
can be spent by these men from business or necessary recreation is spent
here. Mr. C. G. Lloyd devotes himself entirely to the study of botany
and connected subjects, while his brother is equally devoted to materia
medica, pharmacy, and chemistry.

In the botanical department are the best works obtainable in every
country, and there the study of botany may be carried to any height. In
point of age, some of them go back almost to the time when the art of
printing was discovered. Two copies of Aristotle are notable. A Greek
version bound in vellum was printed in 1584. Another, in parallel
columns of Greek and Latin, by Pacius, was published in 1607. Both are
in excellent preservation. A bibliographical rarity (two editions) is
the "Historia Plantarum," by Pinaeus, which was issued, one in 1561, the
other in 1567. It appears to have been a first attempt at the production
of colored plates. Plants that were rare at that time are colored by
hand, and then have a glossy, fixative spread over them, causing the
colors still to be as bright and fresh as the day that the
three-hundred-years-dead workmen laid them on. Ranged in their sequence
are fifty volumes of the famous author, Linnaeus. Mr. Lloyd has a very
complete list of the Linnæan works, and his commissioners in Europe and
America are

looking out for the missing volumes. An extremely odd work is the book
of Dr. Josselyn, entitled "New England Rarities," in which the Puritan
author discusses wisely on "byrds, beastes and fishes" of the New World.
Dr. Carolus Plumierus, a French savant, who flourished in 1762,
contributes an exhaustive work on the "Flora of the Antilles." He is
antedated many years, however, by Dr. John Clayton, who is termed
Johannes Claytonus, and Dr. John Frederick Gronovius. These gentlemen
collated a work entitled the "Flora of Virginia," which is among the
first descriptions of botany in the United States. Two venerable works
are those of Mattioli, an Italian writer, who gave his knowledge to the
world in 1586, and Levinus Lemnius, who wrote "De Miraculis Occultis
Naturæ" in 1628. The father of modern systematized botany is conceded to
be Mons. J. P. Tournefort, whose comprehensive work was published in
1719. It is the fortune of Mr. Lloyd to possess an original edition in
good condition. His "Histoire des Plantes," Paris (1698), is also on the
shelves. In the modern department of the library are the leading French
and German works. Spanish and Italian authors are also on the shelves,
the Lloyd collection of Spanish flora being among the best extant.
Twenty-two volumes of rice paper, bound in bright yellow and stitched in
silk, contain the flora of Japan. All the leaves are delicately tinted
by those unique flower-painters, the Japanese. This rare work was
presented to the Lloyd library by Dr. Charles Rice, of New York, who
informed the Lloyds that only one other set could be found in America.

One of the most noted books in the collection of J. U. Lloyd is a
Materia Medica written by Dr. David Schoepf, a learned German scholar,
who traveled through this country in 1787. But a limited number of
copies were printed, and but few are extant. One is in the Erlangen
library in Germany. This Mr. Lloyd secured, and had it copied verbatim.
In later years Dr. Charles Rice obtained an original print, and
exchanged it for that copy. A like work is that of Dr. Jonathan Carver
of the provincial troops in America, published in London in 1796. It
treats largely of Canadian materia medics. Manasseh Cutler's work, 1785,
also adorns this part of the library. In addition to almost every work
on this subject, Mr. Lloyd possesses complete editions of the leading
serials and pharmaceutical lists published in the last three quarters of
a century. Another book, famous in its way, is Barton's "Collections
Toward a Materia Medica of the United States," published in 1798, 1801,
and 1804.

Several noted botanists and chemists have visited the library in recent
years. Prof. Flueckiger formed the acquaintance of the Lloyds through
their work, "Drugs and Medicines of North America," being struck by the
exhaustive references and foot-notes. Students and lovers of the old art
of copperplate engraving especially find much in the ornate title pages
and portraits to please their æsthetic sense. The founders are not
miserly, and all students and delvers into the medical and botanical
arts are always welcome. This library of rare books, has been collected
without ostentation and with the sole aim to benefit science and
humanity. We must not neglect to state that the library is especially
rich in books pertaining to the American Eclectics and Thomsonians.
Since it has been learned that this library is at the disposal of
students and is to pass intact to some worthy institution of learning,
donations of old or rare books are becoming frequent.
