### PART FOUR

### IN THE UNDER WORLD

<span class="smallcaps">We</span> learned that the males do not marry
before they are from seventy-five to one hundred years old, and that the
age at which women enter wedlock is only a little less, and that both
men and women frequently live to be from six to eight hundred years old,
and in some instances much older. <span id="fr_17"></span>[1](#fn_17.md)

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

During the following year we visited many villages and towns, prominent
among them being the cities of Nigi, Delfi, Hectea, and my father was
called upon no less than a half-dozen times to go over the maps which
had been made from the rough sketches he had originally given of the
divisions of land and water on the "outside" surface of the earth.

I remember hearing my father remark that the giant race of people in the
land of "The Smoky God" had

<span id="page_129">p. 129</span>

almost as accurate an idea of the geography of the "outside" surface of
the earth as had the average college professor in Stockholm.

In our travels we came to a forest of gigantic trees, near the city of
Delfi. Had the Bible said there were trees towering over three hundred
feet in height, and more than thirty feet in diameter, growing in the
Garden of Eden, the Ingersolls, the Tom Paines and Voltaires would
doubtless have pronounced the statement a myth. Yet this is the
description of the California *sequoia gigantea;* but these California
giants pale into insignificance when compared with the forest Goliaths
found in the "within" continent, where abound mighty trees from eight
hundred to one thousand

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

feet in height, and from one hundred to one hundred and twenty feet in
diameter; countless in numbers and forming forests extending hundreds of
miles back from the sea.

The people are exceedingly musical, and learned to a remarkable degree
in their arts and sciences, especially geometry and astronomy. Their
cities are equipped with vast palaces of music, where not infrequently
as many as twenty-five thousand lusty voices of this giant race swell
forth in mighty choruses of the most sublime symphonies.

The children are not supposed to attend institutions of learning before
they are twenty years old. Then their school life begins and continues
for thirty years, ten of which are

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

uniformly devoted by both sexes to the study of music.

Their principal vocations are architecture, agriculture, horticulture,
the raising of vast herds of cattle, and the building of conveyances
peculiar to that country, for travel on land and water. By some device
which I cannot explain, they hold communion with one another between the
most distant parts of their country, on air currents.

All buildings are erected with special regard to strength, durability,
beauty and symmetry, and with a style of architecture vastly more
attractive to the eye than any I have ever observed elsewhere.

About three-fourths of the "inner" surface of the earth is land and

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

about one-fourth water. There are numerous rivers of tremendous size,
some flowing in a northerly direction and others southerly. Some of
these rivers are thirty miles in width, and it is out of these vast
waterways, at the extreme northern and southern parts of the "inside"
surface of the earth, in regions where low temperatures are experienced,
that freshwater icebergs are formed. They are then pushed out to sea
like huge tongues of ice, by the abnormal freshets of turbulent waters
that, twice every year, sweep everything before them.

We saw innumerable specimens of bird-life no larger than those
encountered in the forests of Europe or America. It is well known that
during

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

the last few years whole species of birds have quit the earth. A writer
in a recent article on this subject says: <span
id="fr_18"></span>[1](#fn_18.md)

Is it not possible that these disappearing bird species quit their
habitation without, and find an asylum in the "within world"?

Whether inland among the mountains, or along the seashore, we found bird
life prolific. When they spread their great wings some of the birds
appeared to measure thirty feet from

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

tip to tip. They are of great variety and many colors. We were permitted
to climb up on the edge of a rock and examine a nest of eggs. There were
five in the nest, each of which was at least two feet in length and
fifteen inches in diameter.

After we had been in the city of Hectea about a week, Professor Galdea
took us to an inlet, where we saw thousands of tortoises along the sandy
shore. I hesitate to state the size of these great creatures. They were
from twenty-five to thirty feet in length, from fifteen to twenty feet
in width -and fully seven feet in height. When one of them projected its
head it had the appearance of some hideous sea monster.

The strange conditions "within"

<span id="page_135">p. 135</span>

“There must have been five hundred of these thunder-throated
monsters.”  
</span>

<span id="page_136">p. 136</span> <span id="page_137">p. 137</span>

are favorable not only for vast meadows of luxuriant grasses, forests of
giant trees, and all manner of vegetable life, but wonderful animal life
as well.

One day we saw a great herd of elephants. There must have been five
hundred of these thunder-throated monsters, with their restlessly waving
trunks. They were tearing huge boughs from the trees and trampling
smaller growth into dust like so much hazel-brush. They would average
over 100 feet in length and from 75 to 85 in height.

It seemed, as I gazed upon this wonderful herd of giant elephants, that
I was again living in the public library at Stockholm, where I had spent
much time studying the wonders

<span id="page_138">p. 138</span>

of the Miocene age. I was filled with mute astonishment, and my father
was speechless with awe. He held my arm with a protecting grip, as if
fearful harm would overtake us. We were two atoms in this great forest,
and, fortunately, unobserved by this vast herd of elephants as they
drifted on and away, following a leader as does a herd of sheep. They
browsed from growing herbage which they encountered as they traveled,
and now and again shook the firmament with their deep bellowing. <span
id="fr_19"></span>[1](#fn_19.md)

<span id="page_139">p. 139</span>

There is a hazy mist that goes up from the land each evening, and it
invariably rains once every twenty-four hours. This great moisture and
the invigorating electrical light and warmth account perhaps for the
luxuriant vegetation, while the highly charged electrical air and the
evenness of climatic conditions may have much to do with the giant
growth and longevity of all animal life.

In places the level valleys stretched away for many miles in every
direction. "The Smoky God," in its clear white light, looked calmly
down. There was an intoxication in the electrically surcharged air that
fanned

<span id="page_140">p. 140</span>

the cheek as softly as a vanishing whisper. Nature chanted a lullaby in
the faint murmur of winds whose breath was sweet with the fragrance of
bud and blossom.

After having spent considerably more than a year in visiting several of
the many cities of the "within" world and a great deal of intervening
country, and more than two years had passed from the time we had been
picked up by the great excursion ship on the river, we decided to cast
our fortunes once more upon the sea, and endeavor to regain the
"outside" surface of the earth.

We made known our wishes, and they were reluctantly but promptly
followed. Our hosts gave my father, at his request, various maps showing

<span id="page_141">p. 141</span>

the entire "inside" surface of the earth, its cities, oceans, seas,
rivers, gulfs and bays. They also generously offered to give us all the
bags of gold nuggets—some of them as large as a goose's egg—that we were
willing to attempt to take with us in our little fishing-boat.

In due time we returned to Jehu, at which place we spent one month in
fixing up and overhauling our little fishing sloop. After all was in
readiness, the same ship "Naz" that originally discovered us, took us on
board and sailed to the mouth of the river Hiddekel.

After our giant brothers had launched our little craft for us, they were
most cordially regretful at parting, and evinced much solicitude for

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

our safety. My father swore by the Gods Odin and Thor that he would
surely return again within a year or two and pay them another visit. And
thus we bade them adieu. We made ready and hoisted our sail, but there
was little breeze. We were becalmed within an hour after our giant
friends had left us and started on their return trip.

The winds were constantly blowing south, that is, they were blowing from
the northern opening of the earth toward that which we knew to be south,
but which, according to our compass's pointing finger, was directly
north.

For three days we tried to sail, and to beat against the wind, but to no
avail. Whereupon my father said: "My son, to return by the same route

<span id="page_143">p. 143</span>

as we came in is impossible at this time of year. I wonder why we did
not think of this before. We have been here almost two and a half years;
therefore, this is the season when the sun is beginning to shine in at
the southern opening of the earth. The long cold night is on in the
Spitzbergen country."

"What shall we do?" I inquired.

"There is only one thing we can do," my father replied, "and that is to
go south." Accordingly, he turned the craft about, gave it full reef,
and started by the compass north but, in fact, directly south. The wind
was strong, and we seemed to have struck a current that was running with
remarkable swiftness in the same direction.

<span id="page_144">p. 144</span>

In just forty days we arrived at Delfi, a city we had visited in company
with our guides Jules Galdea and his wife, near the mouth of the Gihon
river. Here we stopped for two days, and were most hospitably
entertained by the same people who had welcomed us on our former visit.
We laid in some additional provisions and again set sail, following the
needle due north.

On our outward trip we came through a narrow channel which appeared to
be a separating body of water between two considerable bodies of land.
There was a beautiful beach to our right, and we decided to reconnoiter.
Casting anchor, we waded ashore to rest up for a day before continuing
the outward hazardous

<span id="page_145">p. 145</span>

undertaking. We built a fire and threw on some sticks of dry driftwood.
While my father was walking along the shore, I prepared a tempting
repast from supplies we had provided.

There was a mild, luminous light which my father said resulted from the
sun shining in from the south aperture of the earth. That night we slept
soundly, and awakened the next morning as refreshed as if we had been in
our own beds at Stockholm.

After breakfast we started out on an inland tour of discovery, but had
not gone far when we sighted some birds which we recognized at once as
belonging to the penguin family. They are flightless birds, but
excellent swimmers and tremendous in size,

<span id="page_146">p. 146</span>

with white breast, short wings, black head, and long peaked bills. They
stand fully nine feet high. They looked at us with little surprise, and
presently waddled, rather than walked, toward the water, and swam away
in a northerly direction. <span id="fr_20"></span>[1](#fn_20.md)

The events that occurred during the following hundred or more days
beggar description. We were on an open and iceless sea. The month we
reckoned to be November or December, and we knew the so-called South

<span id="page_147">p. 147</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Pole was turned
toward the sun. Therefore, when passing out and away from the internal
electrical light of "The Smoky God" and its genial warmth, we would be
met by the light and warmth of the sun, shining in through the south
opening of the earth. We were not mistaken. <span
id="fr_21"></span>[1](#fn_21.md)

There were times when our little craft, driven by wind that was
[continuous](errata.htm#0.md) and persistent, shot through the waters like
an arrow. Indeed,

<span id="page_148">p. 148</span>

had we encountered a hidden rock or obstacle, our little vessel would
have been crushed into kindling-wood.

At last we were conscious that the atmosphere was growing decidedly
colder, and, a few days later, icebergs were sighted far to the left. My
father argued, and correctly, that the winds which filled our sails came
from the warm climate "within." The time of the year was certainly most
auspicious for us to make our dash for the "outside" world and attempt
to scud our fishing sloop through open channels of the frozen zone which
surrounds the polar regions.

We were soon amid the ice-packs, and how our little craft got through
the narrow channels and escaped being crushed I know not. The compass

<span id="page_149">p. 149</span>

behaved in the same drunken and unreliable fashion in passing over the
southern curve or edge of the earth's shell as it had done on our
inbound trip at the northern entrance. It gyrated, dipped and seemed
like a thing possessed. <span id="fr_22"></span>[1](#fn_22.md)

<span id="page_150">p. 150</span>

One day as I was lazily looking over the sloop's side into the clear
waters, my father shouted: "Breakers ahead!" Looking up, I saw through a
lifting mist a white object that towered several hundred feet high,
completely shutting off our advance. We lowered sail immediately, and
none too soon. In a moment we found ourselves wedged between two
monstrous icebergs. Each was crowding and grinding against its fellow
mountain of ice. They were like two gods of war contending for
supremacy. We were greatly alarmed. Indeed, we were between the lines of
a battle royal; the sonorous thunder of the grinding ice was like the
continued volleys of artillery. Blocks of ice larger than a house were
frequently

<span id="page_151">p. 151</span>

<span id="img_15100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![“My father

</span>

<span id="page_152">p. 152</span> <span id="page_153">p. 153</span>

lifted up a hundred feet by the mighty force of lateral pressure; they
would shudder and rock to and fro for a few seconds, then come crashing
down with a deafening roar, and disappear in the foaming waters. Thus,
for more than two hours, the contest of the icy giants continued.

It seemed as if the end had come. The ice pressure was terrific, and
while we were not caught in the dangerous part of the jam, and were safe
for the time being, yet the heaving and rending of tons of ice as it
fell splashing here and there into the watery depths filled us with
shaking fear.

Finally, to our great joy, the grinding of the ice ceased, and within a
few hours the great mass slowly divided,

<span id="page_154">p. 154</span>

and, as if an act of Providence had been performed, right before us lay
an open channel. Should we venture with our little craft into this
opening? If the pressure came on again, our little sloop as well as
ourselves would be crushed into nothingness. We decided to take the
chance, and, accordingly, hoisted our sail to a favoring breeze, and
soon started out like a race-horse, running the gauntlet of this unknown
narrow channel of open water.
