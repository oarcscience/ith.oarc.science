<p><a name="page_173"><font size="1" color="green">p. 173</font></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">PART SIX</h3>  <h3 align="center" align="center">CONCLUSION</h3>  
<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span> concluding this history of my adventures, I wish to state that I firmly believe science is yet in its infancy concerning the cosmology of the earth. There is so much that is unaccounted for by the world's accepted knowledge of to-day, and will ever remain so until the land of "The Smoky God" is known and recognized by our geographers.</p>  
<p>It is the land from whence came the great logs of cedar that have been found by explorers in open waters far over the northern edge of</p>  
<p><a name="page_174"><font size="1" color="green">p. 174</font></A></p>  
<p>the earth's crust, and also the bodies of mammoths whose bones are found in vast beds on the Siberian coast.</p>  
<p>Northern explorers have done much. Sir John Franklin, De Haven Grinnell, Sir John Murray, Kane, Melville, Hall, Nansen, Schwatka, Greely, Peary, Ross, Gerlache, Bernacchi, Andree, Amsden, Amundson and others have all been striving to storm the frozen citadel of mystery.</p>  
<p>I firmly believe that Andree and his two brave companions, Strindberg and Fraenckell, who sailed away in the balloon "Oreon" from the northwest coast of Spitzbergen on that Sunday afternoon of July 11, 1897, are now in the "within" world, and doubtless are being entertained,</p>  
<p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></A></p>  
<p>as my father and myself were entertained by the kind-hearted giant race inhabiting the inner Atlantic Continent.</p>  
<p>Having, in my humble way, devoted years to these problems, I am well acquainted with the accepted definitions of gravity, as well as the cause of the magnetic needle's attraction, and I am prepared to say that it is my firm belief that the magnetic needle is influenced solely by electric currents which completely envelop the earth like a garment, and that these electric currents in an endless circuit pass out of the southern end of the earth's cylindrical opening, diffusing and spreading themselves over all the "outside" surface, and rushing madly on in their course</p>  
<p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></A></p>  
<p>toward the North Pole. And while these currents seemingly dash off into space at the earth's curve or edge, yet they drop again to the "inside" surface and continue their way southward along the inside of the earth's crust, toward the opening of the so-called South Pole.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_23"></A><A HREF="#fn_23"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>As to gravity, no one knows what it is, because it has not been determined</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></A></p>  
<p>whether it is atmospheric pressure that causes the apple to fall, or whether, 150 miles below the surface of the earth, supposedly one-half way through the earth's crust, there exists some powerful loadstone attraction that draws it. Therefore, whether the-apple, when it leaves the limb of the tree, is drawn or impelled downward to the nearest point of resistance, is unknown to the students of physics.</p>  
<p>Sir James Ross claimed to have discovered the magnetic pole at about seventy-four degrees latitude. This is wrong&#8212;the magnetic pole is exactly one-half the distance through the earth's crust. Thus, if the earth's crust is three hundred miles in thickness, which is the distance I</p>  
<p><a name="page_178"><font size="1" color="green">p. 178</font></A></p>  
<p>estimate it to be, then the magnetic pole is undoubtedly one hundred and fifty miles below the surface of the earth, it matters not where the test is made. And at this particular point one hundred and fifty miles below the surface, gravity ceases, becomes neutralized; and when we pass beyond that point on toward the "inside" surface of the earth, a reverse attraction geometrically increases in power, until the other one hundred and fifty miles of distance is traversed, which would bring us out on the "inside" of the earth.</p>  
<p>Thus, if a hole were bored down through the earth's crust at London, Paris, New York, Chicago, or Los-Angeles, a distance of three hundred miles, it would connect the two surfaces.</p>  
<p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 179</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> While the inertia and momentum of a weight dropped in from the "outside" surface would carry it far past the magnetic center, yet, before reaching the "inside" surface of the earth it would gradually diminish in speed, after passing the halfway point, finally pause and immediately fall back toward the "outside" surface, and continue thus to oscillate, like the swinging of a pendulum with the power removed, until it would finally rest at the magnetic center, or at that particular point exactly one-half the distance between the "outside" surface and the "inside" surface of the earth.</p>  
<p>The gyration of the earth in its daily act of whirling around in its spiral rotation&#8212;at a rate greater</p>  
<p><a name="page_180"><font size="1" color="green">p. 180</font></A></p>  
<p>than one thousand miles every hour, or about seventeen miles per second&#8212;makes of it a vast electro-generating body, a huge machine, a mighty prototype of the puny-man-made dynamo, which, at best, is but a feeble imitation of nature's original.</p>  
<p>The valleys of this inner Atlantis Continent, bordering the upper waters of the farthest north are in season covered with the most magnificent and luxuriant flowers. Not hundreds and thousands, but millions, of acres, from which the pollen or blossoms are carried far away in almost every direction by the earth's spiral gyrations and the agitation of the wind resulting therefrom, and it is these blossoms or pollen from the vast floral meadows "within" that</p>  
<p><a name="page_181"><font size="1" color="green">p. 181</font></A></p>  
<p>produce the colored snows of the Arctic regions that have so mystified the northern explorers.&nbsp;<A NAME="fr_24"></A><A HREF="#fn_24"><FONT SIZE="1">1</FONT></A></p>  
<p>Beyond question, this new land</p>  
<p>
</p>  
<p><a name="page_182"><font size="1" color="green">p. 182</font></A></p>  
<p><span class="contnote"><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT></span> "within" is the home, the cradle, of the human race, and viewed from the standpoint of the discoveries made by us, must of necessity have a most important bearing on all physical, paleontological, arch&aelig;ological, philological and mythological theories of antiquity.</p>  
<p>The same idea of going back to the land of mystery&#8212;to the very beginning&#8212;to the origin of man&#8212;is found in Egyptian traditions of the earlier terrestrial regions of the gods, heroes and men, from the historical fragments of Manetho, fully verified by the historical records taken from the more recent excavations of Pompeii as well as the traditions of the North American Indians.</p>

<p>It is now one hour past midnight&#8212;the new year of 1908 is here, and this is the third day thereof, and having at last finished the record of my strange travels and adventures I wish given to the world, I am ready, and even longing, for the peaceful rest which I am sure will follow life's trials and vicissitudes. I am old in years, and ripe both with adventures and sorrows, yet rich with the few friends I have cemented to me in my struggles to lead a just and upright life. Like a story that is well-nigh told, my life is ebbing away. The presentiment is strong within me that I shall not live to see the rising of another sun. Thus do I conclude my message.</p>
