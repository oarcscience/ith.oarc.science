### PART SEVEN

### AUTHOR'S AFTERWORD

<span class="smallcaps">I found</span> much difficulty in deciphering
and editing the manuscripts of Olaf Jansen. However, I have taken the
liberty of reconstructing only a very few expressions, and in doing this
have in no way changed the spirit or meaning. Otherwise, the original
text has neither been added to nor taken from.

It is impossible for me to express my opinion as to the value or
reliability of the wonderful statements made by Olaf Jansen. The
description here given of the strange lands

<span id="page_185">p. 185</span>

and people visited by him, location of cities, the names and directions
of rivers, and other information herein combined, conform in every way
to the rough drawings given into my custody by this ancient Norseman,
which drawings together with the manuscript it is my intention at some
later date to give to the Smithsonian Institution, to preserve for the
benefit of those interested in the mysteries of the "Farthest North
"—the frozen circle of silence. It is certain there are many things in
Vedic literature, in "Josephus," the "Odyssey," the "Iliad," Terrien de
Lacouperie's "Early History of Chinese Civilization," Flammarion's
"Astronomical Myths, "Lenormant's "Beginnings of History," Hesiod's
"Theogony,"

<span id="page_186">p. 186</span>

Sir John de Maundeville's writings, and Sayce's "Records of the Past,"
that, to say the least, are strangely in harmony with the seemingly
incredible text found in the yellow manuscript of the old Norseman, Olaf
Jansen, and now for the first time given to the world.
