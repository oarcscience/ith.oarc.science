# Important Admissions

"When we consider that the advocates of the earth's stationary position
can account for and explain the celestial phenomena as accurately, to
their own thinking, as we can to ours, in addition to which they have
the evidences of their senses, which we have not, and Scriptures and
facts in their favor, which we have not, it is not without some show of
reason that they maintain the superiority of their system. Whereas, we
must be content, at present, to take for granted the truth of the
hypothesis of the earth's motion for one thing. We shall never, indeed,
arrive at a time when we shall be able to pronounce it absolutely proved
to be true. The nature, of the subject excludes such a possibility.
However perfect our theory may appear, in our estimation, and however
satisfactorily the Newtonian hypothesis may seem to account for all
celestial phenomena, yet we are here compelled to admit the astounding
truth, that if our premise be disputed and our facts challenged, the
whole range of astronomy does not contain the proofs of its own
accuracy. Startling as this announcement may appear, it is nevertheless
true; and astronomy would indeed be helpless, were it not for the
implied approval of those whose authority is considered a guarantee of
its truth. Should this sole refuge fail us, all our arguments, all our
observations, all our boasted accuracy would be useless, and the whole
science of modern astronomy must fall to the ground!"--Dr. Woodhouse,
Astronomer, Cambridge, Eng.

Let no one, "so far as hypotheses are concerned, expect anything certain
from astronomy, since that science can afford nothing of the kind. The
hypothesis of the terrestrial motion of the earth was nothing but an
hypothesis, valuable only so far as it explained phenomena, and not to
be considered with reference to absolute truth."--Copernicus, Founder of
Modern Astronomy.

"In whatever way or manner may have occurred this business, I must still
say that I curse this modern theory of cosmogony (the Copernican
system), and hope that perchance there may appear in due time some
scientist of genius who will pick up courage to upset this universally
disseminated delirium of lunatics."--Von Goethe.

"For the invisible things of Him from the creation of the world are
clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his
eternal power and Godhead." (Rom. i: 20.)

"Who hath measured the waters in the hollow \[concavity\] of his hand,
and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the
earth in a measure, weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a
balance?" (Isa. xl: 12.)

"Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? . . . Who
hast laid the measures thereof? or who hath stretched the line upon it?"
(Job xxxviii: 4, 5.)

The "man with a measuring line in his hand," who "stood upon a wall made
by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand." "He stood, and measured
the earth." (Zech. ii: 1; Amos vii: 7, Hab. iii: 6.)
