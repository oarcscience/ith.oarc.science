# Solving an Incalculable Problem

### The Easiest Way to Find a Solution Is to Jump at a Conclusion

OF ALL the absurdities of the Koreshan System, the world thinks the
cosmogonical is the most senseless. "How can people entertain the belief
that we are on the inside of a shell, contrary to the known truth that
the earth is convex?" The fact that man

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

occupies the inside of a spherical environ does not essentially resolve
itself to a matter of controversy, for the statement of the truth
carries conviction to every open receptacle of its fluxion.

Our promulgation of the cellular theory of the universe is not
instituted without due consideration of all that it involves. We are
prepared not only to show the contradictions, absurdities, and
impossibilities of the Copernican theory of astronomy, but to meet every
argument that may be adduced against our own, and to conclusively
demonstrate the correctness of the Koreshan System.

In the original conception of the so called Copernican system of
astronomy, in order to provide for the rapid passage through space of
the occupying and moving worlds,--without their destruction by the
friction that even the most attenuated substance would effect,--space
was declared to be vacuate, as the most ethereal and attenuate substance
imaginable would destroy, first, the atmosphere, then the water, and
finally the substance of the solid earth of which the worlds (?) are
composed.

It was subsequently discovered that as light and other \[so called\]
energies were but the vibrations of ether, and that a vacuum was
impervious to the transmission of "energy" of every description, space
must be filled with something to provide for their communication. Here
was a study for the mathematician. A body flying through space at the
enormous velocity of 640,000,000 miles in three hundred and sixty-five
days, besides the additional motion of 25,000 miles in twenty-four
hours, must necessarily be free from the slightest encumbrance, hence
the vacuum theory.

Now it is found that the vacuum theory will not

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

work because "energy" cannot be transmitted through vacant space. How to
calculate an incalcuable problem was the rub. Somebody scratched his
head in profound thought, and here is the result. As we must have a
vacuum to provide against friction, and substance to fill space to
provide for the transmission of "energy," we must supply space with an
imaginary something just thick enough for the "energy" business.

This must be purely imaginary, for otherwise we would have the friction.
It must also be thin enough to obviate friction; and as the easiest way
to find a solution to an incalculable problem is to jump at a
conclusion, the difference was a compromise between the two extremes,
namely, impalpability and nothing, and the great problem-solver split
the difference between these two points. It was a great achievement for
astronomy, and one of the first steps toward the overthrow of what the
world, up to that time, thought to be a revelation from God.

Cannot any one see clearly, in the solution of the above problem, at the
gait at which the great philosopher of attenuate ether notoriety
conquered the obstacle, at what a rate the revelation theories of
creation must fall into discount? What a mighty tumble for God and his
visionary theories of creation; what humiliation for Moses, the medium
of their communication to a benighted world, and what an opportunity for
the lights of agnosticism to "don't-know" things out of existence!

The "[don't](errata.htm#2.md) know" theory--beginning at the point of
attenuated ethereal solution for the accommodation of champion guessers,
and the Godless Copernican basis of atheism, and ending with the unknown
and unknowable god of modern Christianity--may answer

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

for the ignorant who have not yet cast off the mantle of darkness
adopted in the mediæval age; but for those who are emerging from the
bliss of ignorance, nothing less positive than the perfect solution of
the problem of life can afford satisfaction. The Koreshan Cosmogony will
thrive because it is true. Its adherents are multiplying, and are the
most intelligent of men and women.

Our sun, which would comprise the center of the solar system, with its
planets, moon, etc., would revolve, with thousands of other similar
solar systems, around another far distant center. All these solar
systems, with their grand center, would revolve around still another,
and this would in like manner depend upon a still greater one. This
process of multiplication of centers and augmentation of the general
system would continue without limit, no final center ever being reached.
The physical universe would be without a definitely fixed pivot. A
spiritual system fabulated upon such an astronomical system would
necessarily leave out of the question a central and personal mind as the
governor of the universe, hence the atheistic origin of thought, and
atheism as a belief.
