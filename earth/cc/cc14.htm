</p>  <h1 align="center">Life Develops and Matures in a Shell, Egg, or Womb; Hence We Are Inside of It</h1>  
<p>THERE IS EXTANT a theory that the earth is flat.</p>  
<p>The arguments employed do not necessarily prove the earth to be concave, but they do not prove the earth flat. The earth is not necessarily flat because it is not convex. There are ten thousand arguments at hand to demonstrate the truth of the concave or cellular theory; and every argument brought forward by the so called savant to prove the Copernican theory can be as easily demolished as the one considered.</p>  
<p>We deem it important to simply announce the broad statement that all life develops in a shell, egg, or womb, and that the law of development in the greater or macrocosmic order does not depart from the universal law. All natural life develops and matures (to the point of its liberation from environment) in the egg or womb. The earth, therefore, is the great womb of natural development, hence we are living in a shell.</p>  
<p>It is one of the modern miracles that the human mind, otherwise apparently so profound, can in its estimations ignore the law of foreshortening in the attempt to prove the convex rotundity of the earth, when it admits the law for all other purposes. It is as difficult to eradicate an error and impress a truth today as at any period of the world's history. Human</p>

<p>progress advances upon the principle that "Where ignorance is bliss, &#8217;tis folly to be wise."</p>  
<p>In the illustration of the railway, it was observed that two rails four feet apart appeared to narrow down to the dimension of one rail. If the track or railway be cut in two at the point of vanishing, or at the point where the two rails appear as one, and all that part between the observer and the vanishing point be removed, so that the observer looks against the end of the two rails where they appear as one, there will be seen no intermediate space; and from mere observation without reflection it would be denied that two rails existed. Now let us imagine the observer to be a great scientific (?) teacher, and that he says to another:</p>  
<p>"Do you see that rail yonder in the distance?"</p>  
<p>"Yes," is the reply, "what of it?"</p>  
<p>"That is a binary rail. I can make it look like two rails some distance apart."</p>  
<p>"How can you do that? I don't believe it," says the incredulous neighbor.</p>  
<p>"Why, just look here. I have an instrument that magnifies distant objects, and by applying its magnifying power I can separate that into a double object, and enable you to see two rails. This is proof that the rail is a binary one. These binary rails are the most curious of all rails."</p>  
<p>Two balloons traversing space on parallel lines fifty feet apart will reach a point where they seem to blend as one, precisely as two rails separated by a space of four feet will seem to come together in the distance and appear as one.</p>  
<p>"Do you see that balloon yonder?" says the scientific (?) investigator to his neighbor.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_103"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 103</FONT></A></p>  
<p>"Yes," answers the neighbor.</p>  
<p>"That is a binary balloon," continues the scientist. "A binary balloon; what's that?"</p>  
<p>"Why, a binary balloon is one which, when submitted to observation through a telescope, appears as two balloons. It's a phenomenal balloon. They are not so numerous as the single balloons, but may be seen under favorable circumstances."</p>  
<p>On the basis of the supposition that space is illimitable, let us imagine two stars so far distant from the observer as to appear one, though a million (?) miles distant from each other. The million miles of space have seemed to vanish to the apparent contraction of the object which appears but a minute speck in the distance. It must be remembered that they are separated by a million miles of space.</p>  
<p>If an elongated object could extend through that space, covering the million miles, its diameter as large as the diameter of the two bodies, it still could not be seen as more than the mere star point. But if it were a million and two miles at the vanishing point, it could be seen extending beyond, and enlarging the apparent point. The farther it receded in the perspective, the longer it would have to be made to be observed as a point.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Apparent Contraction of Space</h3>  
<p>Some years ago we were in conversation with an active and thinking mind, one familiar with the astronomical idea of the resolution of a star into binary and multiplex forms,--which the telescope is capable of effecting. In reply to our remark that at any distance beyond the vanishing point of a given</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_104"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 104</FONT></A></p>  
<p>space,--such as the four foot space between the tracks of a railroad,--objects must be outside the four foot limit, and that the further the distance was extended the farther apart they must be to be seen as if at the median line between the rails, he said:</p>  
<p>"You do not pretend to say that two trees so far apart can be seen," marking the position on a diagram before us, "as one tree, do you?"</p>  
<p>"This is precisely what we do say," we answered.</p>  
<p>If the astronomers, instead of calling two stars (which they believe to be separated by millions of miles) a binary star, that is, a double star, would say that the appearance of a star is the result of the contraction of visual area, the apparent contraction of space so as to bring two stars to be observed as one astral center, thus ceasing to put the cart before the horse, this simple proposition would be understood when applied to terrestrial concerns, and much confusion of mind would be obviated.</p>  
<p>If two stars (separated by a million miles) can be seen from a given point of observation as one star, it follows that beyond that point two stars of the same size, to be seen on the same line of observation, must be farther apart; and the farther distant they are the farther apart they must be to be observed on this given line, or, so to speak, given level.</p>  
<p>"But," says the inquirer, "what is the Doctor driving at? What is he trying to prove?"</p>  
<p>We reply, we are attempting to make the stupidity of this age awake to the fact that a pole or a mast must be elongated in inches proportionably to the square of the distance in miles, to maintain the top of a succession of poles or masts on an apparent level.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_105"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 105</FONT></A></p>  
<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> We are trying to awaken the mind of so called civilization to the fact that, as an object recedes in the distance, it appears to contract at both ends by virtue of the law of foreshortening, and that that which is usually attributed to convexity of the earth is really due to diminution of visual area through perspective foreshortening. <i>It's all in your eye!</i></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Comets Are the Production of the Relations of the Sun's Motion to the Colures</h3>  
<p>The word comet is derived or Anglicized from the Greek and Latin <i>cometas</i>, and means hair. The comets are productions, of the relations of the sun's motion to the colures. The colures are the two prime meridians. The solar and lunar orbits are respectively related to these meridians. The term colure means docktail, or the tail cut, off. The points on the equator and at the tropics where the two prime meridians (the colures) cross, are the principal points on the ecliptic (cutting off) where cometic "force" is generated.</p>  
<p>The comets are composed of cruosic "force," caused by condensation of substance through the dissipation of the caloric substance at the opening of the electro-magnetic circuits, which closes the conduits of solar and lunar "energy." This cut-off substance forms itself (according to circumstances) into lenticular shapes of various forms, such as double convex or convexo-convex, double concave or concavo-concave, piano-concave and piano-.convex, diverging meniscus, and converging meniscus.</p>  
<p>These condensations of substance into lenses through which the sun's rays pass, sometimes cause refractions of light through them to appear as long</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_106"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 106</FONT></A></p>  
<p>trains, while it is nothing but the sun's diverted rays of light. They whirl through space in a spiral, approaching nearer the sun, until they enter the sun's vortex as one of the principal sources of solar supply.</p>  
<p>The sun is a helix. Its motion through space--north and south, in that complex activity which occasions the seasons--is a spiral like that of an induction wire around the piece of steel in the induced magnet called the helix, from <i>helios</i>, the Greek for sun. While in its passage north and south the sun reaches its solstitial place at the tropics, its rays extend to the spherical limit and terminate around the poles in zones or rings of cruosic force, the motions of which are derived from the impetus of the sun's motion in its orbit at the solstices.</p>  
<p>These rings of aggregated physical substance whirl around the poles at a rapid rate, and break at that point in either tropic where the sun enters and departs from his solstitial genuflections and bearings.</p>  
<p>They then contract in their circular longitude, and attain the characteristic lenticular form which the relation of the break to the motion causes the rings to assume in their longitudinal contraction into lenses.</p>  
<p>After breaking and contracting into lenticular form, they then start out in the spiral motion and orbit, ultimately falling into the sun, whence the substance was originally derived. At long intervals the same continuation of the sun's impetus and derived "energy" produces a corresponding ring, and another comet of the same order starts out in the same spiral, and is regarded by the astronomers as the return of the same comet.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_107"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 107</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">The Lunar Function and Form</h3>  
<p>There can be no more interesting study relative to cosmogony and to luno-anthropology than that which is offered in lunar (Unction and form. It is the hylegiacal center which governs the principles of formulative creation. The lunar sphere is the great menstrual reservoir and channel of universal fluxion as pertaining both to alchemico-organic activity and the corresponding principles in the organo-vital sphere of creation. The moon is queen of the psychic realm, as the sun is king of the pneumic spheres. In this aspect of their qualities, the sex functions of moon and sun are viewed from the external or exoteric point of observation.</p>  
<p>As the hylegiacal center and sphere of formulative force the moon holds, in the solutions of her menstrua, all the elements of transformation from which the foundations of the universe are laid and its super-structure established. She is the terminal of the seven planetary oozings, and the final reservoir of their accumulations. The basis and resource of her power to rebuild are the seven lamin&aelig; or beaten plates (<i>rakayia</i>) of the firmament, rendered stable through the processes of her depository function.</p>  
<p>She is the final product of the action of solar substance upon the metallic strata contiguous and superimposed one upon another, comprising the outer rind of the crust of the earth, reflected as an energetic menstruum and aggregated as the lunar gravo-photosphere beneath the contiguity of the upper stratum of the oxygen of our atmosphere and the lower circumference of the atmosphere of hydrogen above us.</p>  
<p>The subtle and interior forces of the sun penetrate</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_108"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 108</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the inner crust and water of the earth's surface, permeating even the metallic strata and acting as a disintegrator to the layers of metallic substance, reducing their surfaces of contiguity to electromagnetic and levic substances, which proceed, as a complex solution of menstruum, from seven metallic bases constituting so many circumferences, formulating in the heavens--as it proceeds from these circumferences toward the center of the cosmos--the seven planetary spheres.</p>  
<p>The direct cause of the aggregation of the seven spheres or planets is the conjunction of the inflowing spirit-substances, of which there are seven qualities, with the co-ordinate seven qualities outflowing from the solar sphere. The moon is the culminating and aggregate product of the seven; she being the final receptacle of the seven fluxions.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">The Moon's Phases</h3>  
<p>The waxing and waning of the moon are continuations of the same phenomena belonging to the planets. The moon is not a direct reflection of the earth's surface against the contiguity of our present oxygen with the hydrogen atmosphere above us, but the consecutive storage reflexions of the various planes of metallic strata responding to the penetration of solar "energy." We have in the moon a vague but correct outline of the surface of the earth, implanted by a storage process and viewed by us as a complex reflexion of the concavity of the earth. We see Europe, Asia, Africa, North and South America, Oceanica, the waters of the earth, etc., pictured for our inspection in outline above us.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_109"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 109</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Eclipses of the Sun and Moon</h3>  
<p>One of the principal proofs adduced of the globular form of the astronomical bodies, is the fact that in an eclipse the supposed body passing between the one eclipsed and the sun forms a circular shadow. This would be positive proof if there could be adduced no other or better reason for the phenomenon. That is, if no other equally cogent reason could be assigned, this might be taken as proof; otherwise it is no proof.</p>  
<p>The sun transmits its radiations in a circular form, as may be illustrated by the appearance of the rainbow. These radiations strike or touch the concave strata of the earth's circumference as only a circumradiation can do, and must therefore, in a reflex action of those emanations, return to the pivot or center of influx in a circumvergent, as they passed out in a circumdivergent form.</p>  
<p>Ecliptical phenomena, whatsoever may conspire to effect them, must necessarily conform in contour, in the circumcision or cutting off, to the circumvergent aspect of the energetic fluxion, whether afferent or efferent in direction. If it can be determined by what processes the circuit is closed and the current generated, it can as readily be determined by what processes the circuit can be opened and the current eclipsed.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Purposes of the Ecliptic</h3>  
<p>Every phenomenon is governed by law operative for some specific purpose. We therefore study the laws of the ecliptic with the end in view for which they are instituted. The object of the ecliptic and the operation of its functions are the conservation of "energy" and</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_110"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 110</FONT></A></p>  
<p>the perpetuity of motion. "Except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved," has direct reference to the application of the principles which govern the ecliptic in the alchemico-organic world, as well as those which govern circumcision and the direction of its uses as a religious rite; and the laws of conservation, operative in the alchemico-organic, are dependent upon those operative in the organo-vital, and are related to them as effect to cause.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Position of the Ecliptic (Cutting Off)</h3>  
<p>The ecliptic is the line or direction of the sun's yearly course. According to the Copernican system it is the earth's orbit around the sun, and therefore the sun's apparent annual motion. The earth is a shell, with its concave surface occupied. In other words, the surface we occupy is concave instead of convex, and is comparatively stationary. That which we call the sun is the projected focus of the occult or hidden solar center. His motion is helical or spiral from east to west, moving toward the south, in his gyrations, six months of the year, and north the other six months.</p>  
<p>The limitations of these motions are the two tropics. The sun has no zenith point north of the tropic of Cancer, nor south of the tropic of Capricorn. His zenith at the tropic of Cancer is June 21, and at the tropic of Capricorn, December 21. These are called the solstices, meaning the standing still of the sun; for at these points the sun circles the earth without going farther north or south until making a complete diurnal circle. June 21, the rays of the sun are vertical at the tropic of Cancer; December 21, they are vertical at the tropic of Capricorn.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_111"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 111</FONT></A></p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Influence of the Motion of the Sun upon the Metallic Lamin&aelig; and Surface of the Sphere</h3>  
<p>In the orbit of the sun there are four prime points or centers; photoic, scotoic, caloric, and cruosic. These four primary substances and influences follow one another in the gyre of the solar motion. Their action is as if there were four gyres successively following one another in the order of photoic substance (<i>lumen</i>, light), caloric substance, (<i>thermos</i>, heat), scotoic substance (the substance of darkness), and cruosic substance (crystalline or frigid substance) . Four distinct helices of "energy" are winding their course and exercising their co-ordinate and antithetical influences upon the surfaces they touch and the substances they penetrate, day after day, in the perpetual solar gyre.</p>  
<p>Suppose we take the axis, the poles of which are heat and cold; the heat and cold points or poles being exactly opposite. The tendency of the gyre of calorine is to perpetually expand as Helios (the sun) winds his never-ceasing spire. Following this course, twelve hours behind, cruosine, the freezing substance, or the substance of crystallization, exerts its contracting force as Helios winds his way.</p>  
<p>Here, then, we have the application of the law of pulsation, as regular as the expansion and contraction of the heart beat in the human body, and, from the corresponding law in the alchemico-organic domain, to that operative in the domain of the organo-vital sphere. We are not only enabled to observe the application of the principles of expansion and contraction, alternately applied in solar influence through the penetration of these solar substances, but we also find herein the law of insulation.</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_112"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 112</FONT></A></p>  
<p>The radiation of heat is cut off in the direction of the cruosic gyre, reflected back upon itself, and compelled to take a lengthwise accelerated course, producing friction, and therefore the generation of magnetic substance of the terrestrial quality, as contradistinct to that of celestial origin.</p>
