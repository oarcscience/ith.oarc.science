# THE CELLULAR COSMOGONY

### Koreshan Universology Is Predicated Upon an Absolutely Demonstrated Premise; the World Face to Face with a Radical Astronomical Revolution

KORESHANITY is universal science applied to all the concerns of
practical life, involving the science of immortal life in the body. It
includes the science of religion, founded upon an accurate knowledge of
the structure and function of the cosmic organism. It embraces every
department and phase of form and function in the universe, and is
therefore Universology. It is predicated upon an absolutely demonstrated
premise, a geometric figure which embraces three simple elements--the
arc, chord, and radius, practically applied to earth measurement by a
process which determines the contour of the surface of the earth in
which we dwell, and the direction of its curvation. This is not
theoretical, but *applied* geometry. This contour is found to be an
upward instead of a downward curve, and thus it is diametrically
opposite to the assumed convexity of the earth's surface. The world is
therefore face to face with a radical astronomical revolution.

The earth is a concave sphere, the ratio of curvation

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

being eight inches to the mile, thus giving a diameter of eight
thousand, and a corresponding circumference of about twenty-five
thousand miles. This fact is physically and mechanically demonstrated by
placing a perpendicular post at any point on the surface of the earth,
(though it were better to place it by the side of a surface of water,)
and extending a straight line at right angles from this perpendicular.
The line thus extended will strike the surface at any distance
proportionate to the height of the vertical post.

"Hypothesis, or guesswork, indeed, lies at the foundation of all
scientific knowledge," says the Standard Dictionary, quoting from
Fiske's "Unseen World," page 3. The term science is derived from
*scire*, to know; hence, science is the Latin term for knowledge.
Science means knowledge, nothing more, nothing less. That which is
founded upon hypothesis (assumption) is not science, nor should it be
dignified by that title. The Copernican system of astronomy has its
foundation in assumption,--this is conceded by all so called scientific
astronomers. The Copernican system has never been demonstrated,
therefore it is not scientific.

What does Koreshanity offer as a substitute for the gigantic fallacy and
farce of the benighted Copernicus? First, it offers the fact that in
experiments carefully made by the Koreshan Geodetic Staff at Naples, on
the Gulf coast of Florida, the contour of the earth was proven to be
diametrically the reverse of what is taught as true in the
pseudo-science of modern times.

The surface of the earth is not convex. It appears

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

to be so because of optical illusion. The only geodetic survey ever made
for the purpose of determining whether the surface on which we dwell is
convex or concave, was made by the Geodetic Staff of the Koreshan Unity
in the year 1897. In this survey was corroborated conclusively the
testimony given in 1870, that the earth is a hollow shell about eight
thousand miles in diameter, and about twenty-five thousand miles in
circumference.

### The Form of the Universe, the Great Alchemico Organic World

The alchemico-organic (physical) world or universe is a shell composed
of seven metallic, five mineral, and five geologic strata, with an inner
habitable surface of land and water. This inner surface, as the reader
already understands, is concave. The seven metallic layers or laminæ are
the seven noble metals,--gold constituting the outermost rind of the
shell. This shell or crust is a number of miles in thickness.

Within this shell are three principal atmospheres, the first or
outermost (the one in which we exist) being composed chiefly of oxygen
and nitrogen; the one immediately above that is pure hydrogen, and the
one above the hydrogen atmosphere we have denominated aboron. Within
this is the solar electromagnetic atmosphere, the nucleus of which is
the stellar center. In and occupying these atmospheres are the sun and
stars, also the reflections called the planets and the moon.

The planets are mercurial disci moving by electromagnetic impulse
between the metallic laminæ or planes of the concave shell. They are
seen through penetrable rays, ultra electro-magnetic, reflected or

<span id="page_19">p. 19</span>

bent back in their impingement on spheres of substance regularly
graduated as the stories in the heavens.

In the foregoing is presented a descriptive outline merely, of the
alchemico-organo-cosmic form. It is not assumptive. Neither is it
intended, in this synopsis, to prove the Koreshan Universology; the
proofs and demonstrations of the System will be found in subsequent
pages of this work.

### Motion and Function

We have already outlined the general principles of form. We here insert
this axiom: Form is a fundamental property of existence; therefore, that
which has no form has no existence. Limitation is a property of form.
The universe has existence; therefore it has form, hence it has
limitation. While the above axiom partakes somewhat of the syllogistic
method, it will be noticed that the objectionable feature of the
syllogism is expunged; namely, the premise is not an assumption.

Motion obtains in everything throughout cosmic form. Nothing exists
without motion. The atoms of the rock are constantly changing place with
all other atoms. There is circulation in the bar of steel. The angular
crystal atoms of the diamond are in motion, and in their circulation and
impingement they generate electro-magnetic substance of the most
delicate attenuation. All these circulations are regular and according
to the fixed laws of order; therefore, while form exists according to
definite principles of form, the laws of motion conform to and determine
the principles and arrangement of organic relation and shape.

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

### Cause of Motion

The cause of alchemico-organic motion is remote and proximate. Before
defining the laws and principles of motion, we will here briefly state
that within the alchemico-organic world (cosmos) there resides the
anthropostic or corresponding cosmos. These are two discrete spheres,
yet they are co-ordinately one. The alchemico-organic cosmos (the
physical world, the outline of which is given in preceding pages) is in
the form of man; that is, in the egg or shell--man in the state of
un-incubation.

The mass of humanity is in the same state, with this modification; the
alchemico-organic cosmos is in space, and is therefore persistent; while
its anthropostic co-ordinate embodies principles which merely correspond
to space, and are not persistent in any one form. For instance: The
seven metallic laminæ or plates comprising the general metallic rind of
the macrocosmic shell are perpetual. These are the seven limitations of
essences radiating from the stellar nucleus primarily, and from the
solar limbus as the environment of the stellar nucleus. They constitute
the deposit extremities of the seven essences, or the seven
alchemico-organic spirits of radiation. The geologic strata through
which the essences radiate are the conditions of chaos penetrated by the
essences before they reach their extremities of metallic deposition and
order.

The stellar nucleus is the center of space; the metallic laminæ are at
the circumference of space. Correspondentially in humanity, the Lord
Christ was the stellar Center, and his quality was the correspondent, in
anthropostic being, of space in the

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

alchemico-organic cosmos. In the progress of time in its relation to the
development and progress of the race, the seven churches yet to be
formulated into groups are the anthropostic depositions corresponding to
the seven metallic plates. The seven churches are seven qualities of
human characteristics and correspond to the seven planets, and therefore
to the seven primary substratic laminæ of the cosmic crust.

By the remote cause of motion is meant the cause primary to the
electro-magnetic substance created at and radiating from the stellar
nucleus, antithetically generated at the circumference of the shell and
converging to the nucleus. The cellular cosmos, or the great cosmic egg
previously described, constitutes a great electro-magnetic battery which
is purely physical, or, as denominated in Koreshan Science,
alchemico-organic. The sun and stars are focalizations of physical
spirit-substance, merging into matter materialized through voluminous
and high-tension convergence.

There are at these centers constant concretion and sublimation.
Spirit-substance is constantly materializing, and the temporary
materialization is as rapidly changed to spirit-substance and is
radiated. There is, therefore, a reciprocal interchange of substance
from center and circumference. The spirit-substances engendered at the
nucleus are radiated to the circumference, and are there solidified. At
the circumference the surplus solidification is reduced again to
spirit-substance and flows to the nucleus.

As there are seven metallic laminæ in the prime circumference, so there
are seven prime metallic kinds of essence flowing toward and into the
stellar nucleus.

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

\[paragraph continues\] As these influxes are of seven distinct
characteristic vibrations, so the nucleus has seven distinct degrees of
essence, all meeting at one focal point in space, there turning back
upon themselves and flowing out or radiating to the circumference and
depositing at the environments of the cosmos. From the mineral laminæ,
geologic strata, and water surface of the universal rind, there is also
a corresponding and co-ordinate inflow or convergence to the stellar
nucleus.

However, we find in this great universal battery, in its
electro-magnetic power, but the proximate cause of its activity and
form. Thus far there is no conscious and voluntary spirit-substance.
Associated in co-operative being with this alchemico-organic cosmos is
another half, endowed with voluntary and involuntary consciousness,
co-existent and co-eternal. This voluntary and involuntary conscious
existence, the acme of whose life is in the human brain, while prior and
positive as to the momentum of this duplex cosmic structure, is only
coincident as to its perpetuity. Neither existed prior to the other in
the timic aspect of their co-ordination.

The proximate cause, then, of all the motions of the alchemico-organic
cosmos is electro-magnetic substance produced reciprocally at the center
and circumference of the great alchemico-organic battery, by the
destruction of matter; for let it be reiterated and remembered, that
spirit-substance is the result of the destruction of matter as matter;
and that matter is the result of the destruction of spirit-substance as
such. In other words, an atom of matter is the materialization of
physical spirit-substance, and this substance is the dematerialization
of matter. Both matter

<span id="page_23">p. 23</span>

and spirit are substance. It will thus be seen that spirit-substance is
not therefore a mere mode of motion or of vibration, but in reality is
something in motion.

### The Remote Cause of Physical Motion

We have hinted only, in a general way, at the proximate cause of the
activities in the alchemico-organic cosmos. The term remote cause is
here employed as being a cause remote from the electromagnetic essences
upon which immediately depend the form, motions, and phenomena of the
cosmic structure outlined in the foregoing. We are now to consider the
very central and primary cause of all motion. This cause is mental. Not
only is it mental, but it is voluntary and of the will.

There are two cosmic fields of form and function belonging to discrete
degrees, but yet co-ordinate and interdependent. These are the
alchemico-organic and the organo-vital. The first and lower is that
which embraces the world as the earth, with the stars, sun, planets,
atmosphere, etc.; the other, the higher, is the vegetable, animal,
human, angelic, and God kingdoms. They are both co-eternal; neither
existed before the other. The organo-vital is prior as to quality, and
prior also as to its positive power to create and perpetuate.

The alchemico-organic field centers in the astral nucleus as the
positive pole of its electro-magnetic essence; the organo-vital centers
in the divine Man, the bright and morning Star, whence originate the
voluntary redemptive will and creative power. The Lord Jesus is the
representative nucleus of the regenerated manhood. The Lord Christ at
the time of his manifestation was the center of the anthropostic

<span id="page_24">p. 24</span>

universe, the source of being, the point and origin of creative power.

### Cause of Motion From the Biblical and Theological Point of View

"He is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of every creature:
for by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in
earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:
and he is before all things, and by the all things consist; and is the
head of the body, the church." (Col. i:15-18.)

There can be but one question regarding the above Scriptural
declaration. Is it true? It is concise; sweeping, inclusive, conclusive,
and lucid. Is the Lord Jesus the Christ of God what he declares himself
to be, and what inspired men have declared him? Is he the Son of God?
And does He embody, as the primary offspring of Deity, all the
attributes of the parent? And more than this; in His development from
men as the Son of man, did he absorb into himself the principles,
attributes, life, form, and consciousness of the parent?

We hold that the Lord, as was declared of him, was the fulness of the
Godhead bodily,--Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; and further, that when
the Lord was visibly manifest to the outer world, his inner and
spiritual life was visible to the spiritual world as the
astro-biological center of that sphere, and beside him there was no God.

How could the Lord, being born an infant into the natural world only at
the beginning of the age, be the cause of all things? The Lord was not
only the reincarnation of Elijah (God the Lord), of Moses, of Abraham,
of Noah, of Enoch, and of Adam, in a direct

<span id="page_25">p. 25</span>

line, but of all who died looking to his coming as the Messiah and Son
of God in the indirect lines of reincarnation. He gathered into himself
the spirits of the past. He was also the pole of influx from the
heavenly worlds, and constituted the rolling together of the heavens as
a scroll. He was the Word infolded and sealed. "Him hath God the Father
sealed."

Twenty-four thousand years before the beginning of the Christian age,
conditions in the world were the same as then. God was manifest in the
flesh, and the Lord of the Christian era was identical with the Adamic
personality in the beginning of the 24,000-year cycle. The end and
beginning of every grand Zodiacal cycle bring into visible and personal
manifestation the Son of God, who is Father, Mother, and Son.

He, the Lord, was the individual or undivided man. He held within
himself the Bride, for "He who hath the bride is the bridegroom." He was
the biune, the two-in-one, the parent of himself, and also of the Sons
of God. As the parent of Himself, High Father, he was Abram; as the
Father of the Sons of God, he was and is Abraham. He being the very
primate cause of all things, and possessing both the voluntary and
involuntary power of creative being, it is seen that the cause of all
things resides in voluntary mental substance, supplemented by the
involuntary reflex of voluntary mental activity.

### Precession of the Equinoxes as Related to Astro-biological Manifestations

When the ordinary "scientist" alludes to the precession of the
equinoxes, he has reference merely to the sun's precessional movement;
but every planet passes through a corresponding precession. The sun's
precessional year is 24,000 years long. The precessional

<span id="page_26">p. 26</span>

years of the planets are correspondingly longer, proportioned to the
difference in their ordinary years. These precessional years constitute
cycles of time that are definite and recurrent, and proportionate to the
great complex, solar, lunar, planetary, and stellar precessions.

The movements in the alchemic-organic sphere have an astro-biological
correspondence. The signs in the physical heavens mark definitely the
manifestations which correspond to them in the astro-biologic field.
Every 24,000 years there is a similar personal manifestation as the one
constituting the beginning of the Christian era. Every 24,000 years
there is such a manifestation as is now about to occur.

We are now approaching a great biologic conflagration. Thousands of
people will dematerialize, through a biologic electro-magnetic
vibration. This will be brought about through the direction of one mind,
the only one who has a knowledge of the law of this bio-alchemical
transmutation.

The change will be accomplished through the formation of a biological
battery, the laws of which are known only to one man. This man is Elijah
the Prophet, ordained of God, the Shepherd of the Gentiles. and the
central reincarnation of the ages. From this conflagration will spring
the Sons of God, the biune offspring of the Lord Jesus, the Christ and
Son of God.

### The Transposition of Mental Force to Physical "Energy"

When a man (the man) so understands the laws of life as to know their
application, and through obedience to law overcomes the sensual
tendencies of, his nature, he reaches the point of biologic absorptions
The visible and tangible dematerializes, and the outer

<span id="page_27">p. 27</span>

consciousness enters into unity and blends with the inner and spiritual.
The visible man consumes and thus enters, by transabsorption, into the
unity of the invisible Godhead, and, by descent, into the church
prepared to receive the precipitate afflatus.

In the process of the dissolution of the visible structure, by which the
matter of the tangible organism is dissolved, consumed, and reduced to
spiritual substance called the Holy Spirit,--the substances (oxygen,
hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, sulphur, phosphorus, fluorine, chlorine,
sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, cuprum, aluminum, iron, etc.)
contained in the organic structure, together with the atmosphere and the
free physical spirit-substances of space, enter the vortex of vibration,
which consumes the body.

The consciousness of the man entering thus into the whirlpool of organic
dissolution is not obliterated, but infolds by conjunctive unity with
the central and interior mind, around which the outer consciousness had
wrapped itself. This interior mind constitutes the very central
consciousness of Deity, the heart of the anthro-biologic cosmos.
Radiating from this afferent absorption, the gravic spirit in its
efferent distribution baptizes such minds as are prepared to receive the
divine overshadowing, called the Holy Spirit.

Every overshadowing of the primary seven successive baptisms proceeds
directly, not from an invisible "oversoul," but from the tangible
personality. The Holy Spirit shed upon the world (the church) in the
beginning of the age, proceeded from the visible Lord in his conversion
from matter to spirit. If the Lord

<span id="page_28">p. 28</span>

had not been personal, there could not have obtained the dissolution of
his body and its conversion to Holy Spirit; and therefore the afflatus
(the "oversoul") could not have obtained.

But the vortical involution, the anthropostic, took place in
alchemico-organic (physical) space; therefore it involved the material
elements not included in the organo-vital structure, and the vibrations
were communicated to the elements and essences of the alchemico-organic
cosmos, converging toward and into the stellar nucleus of the
alchemico-organic world, and radiating to its circumferences.

It is thus that the conscious mental nucleus of the anthropostic imparts
momentum to the activities of what has been denominated the physical
universe. The impulse ceases to be mental substance as soon as the
influence of correlation has mutated the vibration of mental substance
to the vibration of alchemico-organic (physical) motion.

We do not employ the term vibration as it is usually employed in common
psychical or physical "science;" with us, vibration signifies not merely
motion imparted to atoms or essences, but the dissolving of molecules
and atoms, and their conversion to spirit-substance in the various
degrees, and vice versa. It is thus observed that a reciprocal relation
exists between the anthro-biologic (organo-vital) and the
alchemico-organic worlds, and that the electromagnetic essences active
in the latter are the result of a continuous, primary, voluntary mental
essence generated in the human mind, dependent on the material basis
(brains); these two co-ordinate fields of operation being co-eternal.

<span id="page_29">p. 29</span>

### Cause of Motion of Planetary Disci

There are seven primary, movable, mercurial disci floating between the
metallic plates or laminæ. The momentum is imparted through the
operation of the actinic radiations from the astral nucleus, projected
through the solar influence. These radiations penetrate the geologic,
mineral, and metallic strata.

As the sun radiates its substance in the form of a cone, the apex of
which is at the solar center, and the base at the metallic strata, the
impression made upon the strata is in the form of a circular area. There
is an impression of the alternate influence of caloric and cruosic
substance, the one expansile, the other contractile. This movement
follows the rotation of solar motion, therefore there is necessarily a
peristaltic or vermicular motion imparted to the metallic plates or
laminæ.

The alternate action of the actinic radiations of calorine and cruosine
produces discular vacui between the plates, which are filled with
mercurial amalgam. These act as reflectors, throwing back into the
heavens the forms of the disci against the atmospheres, so that in
looking toward the heavens we behold these disci through the operation
of the laws of reflection, and are thus enabled to comprehend how the
Lord "spreadeth out the heavens . . . as a molten looking-glass."

### Knowledge of Universal Form Necessary

A knowledge of the structural form and function of the alchemico-organic
(physical) cosmos is the key to our knowledge of the principles which
must govern the organization of society in the culminating kingdom of
righteousness. The importance of a knowledge of

<span id="page_30">p. 30</span>

universal form and function, as pertaining to the alchemico-organic
cosmos, will be admitted when the mind is sufficiently amplified to
comprehend the relationship of the alchemico-organic macrocosm to the
organo-vital macrocosm (the Grand Man), as pertaining to and comprising
the universal mass of human existence.

The individual (undivided) man (such a man was the Lord) is the
archetype of creation. What He was in the least form, the
alchemico-organic world is in its greatest form; and what he was in that
form, so also is the final Theocratic Kingdom in the earth, namely, in
the form and function of the man. Therefore, we discover that the true
interpretation of the alchemico-organic cosmos is the revelation of the
mysteries of Deity; for as the outward and most material structure is
but the expressed thought of the voluntary and involuntary mental cause
producing it, so a knowledge of this expressed and manifest language
reveals the history of human origin and destiny.
