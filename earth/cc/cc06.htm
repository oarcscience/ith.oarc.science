</p>  <h1 align="center">Laws Which Determine the Form and Function of the Universe</h1>  
<p>STUDENTS of Koreshan Universology are becoming familiar with the term geodesy, and the phrase, the new geodesy; and that there may be no misunderstanding of its meaning and its bearing upon life, we think it admissible to define its significance and its relation to the system of universal culture which Koreshan Universology embraces. The term geodesy is from two Greek words; <i>ge</i>, earth, and <i>dai</i>, to divide. It is literally the science of dividing the earth, or of defining its character as to form, that there may be a foundation for a knowledge of its functions.</p>  
<p>There are three fundamental laws involved which, when understood, determine the form and function of the universe as an entirety. These are first, the science of comparative cellology,--the foundation principle of which analogically determines the fact that all life, whether that life be specific or general, unfolds within the cell. The law and principle of comparative evolution analogically determine the fact. that universal life is a unity, and that the progress of gestative evolution must necessarily progress within the great cell or womb of creative incrementation; second, the science of vision, known by the term optics, in which are interpreted the appearances of</p>

<p>objects on the surface of the earth as related to the earth's contour.</p>  
<p>At this point let us quote a passage of Scripture which has a very significant application to the subject under discussion: "Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment." This law applies as well to physical observations as to moral, religious, and spiritual things. Things are not as they appear at all times; hence the necessity for understanding principles, that interpretations may be genuinely true.</p>  
<p>Book optics and practically applied optics are two very different things. The reader must become familiar with practically applied optics. For instance, books will tell you that because the earth is convex, three posts placed in the water three miles apart will conform to the convexity; the middle one will be the highest of the three on the convex surface; and looking from the initial post toward the terminal one, the line of vision will cut the middle post and strike the terminal or distal post at a higher point than the middle one. No one pretends to dispute this fact of observation.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Perspective Foreshortening an Essential Factor</h3>  
<p>The interpretation given and generally believed is, that the world is convex; and because it is convex, and vision being in a straight line, the fact is according to the appearance. Place three posts three miles apart, the distal one being six miles from the initial post--the three posts being each one foot above the water's surface. Now place the eye, unaided by the telescope, at the top of the initial post and look toward the middle and terminal post. The middle and distal posts will be out of sight, not from the fact</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_44"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 44</FONT></A></p>  
<p>of convexity, but from the fact of perspective foreshortening. Place a telescope of about three inches diameter of the objective lens, upon the initial post; you look over the top of the middle post and see the distal one on a curve above the middle post.</p>  
<p>The truth concerning the matter is, that vision is deceptive unless the science of perspective fore, shortening is applied to the interpretation of the first and second observation, the one with the unaided eye, and the other with the aid of the telescope. The fact that the books and practical experiment do not agree should serve as a precaution against believing all the books say, when those books contain only theory founded upon assumption.</p>  
<p>The science of optics, then, may be called the second science applicable to geodetic discrimination, and one of the laws employed to corroborate the testimony of comparative cellology, which determines the contour of the surface of the earth, and the fact that the earth is a great electro-magnetic cell. It should be remembered, that comparative cellology settles the question of the concavity of the earth, and the fact that man <i>in</i>-habits the earth. The science of optics corroborates the testimony of cellology.</p>  
<p>The third science is that of mechanics as applied to the measure of the contour. It will be noticed that there are three methods of proving the fact of the concavity of the earth's surface. The first and greatest is comparative cellology; the second and most complicated, the application of optics; the third and most simple, by mechanical application. In the perfection of a treatise on the new geodesy these three principles would necessarily be included, for the reason that the corroborative testimony of more witnesses</p>  
<p><A NAME="page_45"><FONT SIZE=1 COLOR=GREEN>p. 45</FONT></A></p>  
<p>than one is essential to conviction of different characters of mentality.</p>  <h3 align="center" align="center">Geodesy Applied to Earth Measurement</h3>  
<p>Geodesy is the application of mechanical and other means for the purpose of determining measurements of the earth's surface, including not only that of its general contour as to whether it is concave, flat, or convex, but also of demonstrating the amount of curvation at any given point and in any given direction.</p>  
<p>The Copernican system of astronomy assumes that the earth's surface is convex, and upon this assumption the fallacious system has been fabricated. No astronomer has ever yet presented any proof of the Copernican system; and one of the persistent efforts of the modern physicist is to find some irrefragable proof of what every so called astronomical scientist knows to be merely an assumption.</p>  
<p>Our knowledge of the figure of the earth is only obtained by indirect means.--Astronomer Ball.</p>  
<p>The geodetic operations carried on during the last century and a half for the purpose of determining the figure and dimensions of the earth have, up to this time, led to no satisfactory results. They have been performed by the most eminent astronomers, with the most perfect instruments, and it would seem that they ought to have led to a final solution of the problem; such, however, is by no means the case. Every new measure of a meridian arc has but added, and adds, to the existing doubts and want of concordance, nay, to the positive contradiction which the various operations exhibit, as compared with one another.--Von Schubert.</p>  
<p>The Koreshan System of Astronomy is in direct opposition to the Copernican system, and unlike the</p>

<p><FONT SIZE=-2 COLOR=GREEN>[paragraph continues]</FONT> Copernican system it is founded, not upon an assumption, but rather upon a premise so absolutely within the sphere of mechanical demonstration as to place it beyond and out of the uncertainty of mere postulation, which we assert to be the basis of so called modern science.</p>
