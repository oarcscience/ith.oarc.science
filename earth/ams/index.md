Still one of the largest pieces of architecture ever constructed, the
Great Pyramid has long been the subject of wonder as to when it was
built, by whom, and most importantly, *why*. The conventional
explanation is that it was built during the reign of the Pharaoh Khufu
by skilled Egyptian laborers as a funerary monument. In the 19th
century, in the absence of hard information other than detailed studies
of its dimensions, a whole class of speculation grew up which has been
called 'pyramidology.' The pyramidologists came to believe that the
Great Pyramid encoded advanced knowledge of the physical universe, and
the course of human history. This book is one of the primary texts of
pyramidology.

In addition to pyramidology, Joseph Seiss was a Christian
dispensationalist, a 19th century millennialist school of thought. The
dispensationalists viewed human history as a series of covenants with
God. They were certain that the end of days could be pinpointed using
Biblical prophecy. This was the origin of a set of beliefs widely
accepted by contemporary evangelical Christians.

Seiss advances many dubious assertions, such as his statement that there
were no predecessors to the Great Pyramid. Egypt is dotted with dozens
of prior examples, including several that collapsed because the
Egyptians were still experimenting with the correct proportions. He
makes a whole range of claims that specific dimensions of the Great
Pyramid, when multiplied by some other number, can be associated with
the size of the axis of the Earth, its density, and so on (a staple of
the pyramidologist literature). He matches details of the interior
passages to the dispensationalist timeline. And he somehow concludes
that the Egyptians did not build the pyramid, but some other hitherto
obscure race of Philistines, led by an individual named Melchisedec, who
was identical to the Biblical Job!

Seiss and the other 19th century pyramidologists have abundant modern
successors. Their answer to 'when' goes as far back as the last ice age;
their answer to 'who' includes space aliens and Atlanteans, and their
'why' includes 'as a huge electrical generator.' Time will tell whether
their theories will appear as spurious as Seiss a hundred years from
now, or lead to some radical new understanding of the 'Miracle in
Stone.'
