### Earth the Heart of the Cosmos

THE COSMIC HEART--centre of life in the universe as man's tiny heart is
his centre of life--meant to the ancient Aryans "Breath," the
ceaselessly ascending and descending spiral which is the life-sustaining
symbol of the universe. To the ancient Egyptians the cosmic heart was
the Mind: "It is He (the Heart) who brings forth every issue, and it is
the tongue that repeats the thoughts of the Heart." To the Chinese the
heart of the universe was Buddha; it was also "the skilful workman," who
made all the different conditions of existence in the ten regions of
space; it was the "universal essence" from which everything in the
universe came into being. Heaven and Earth, with this heart, they said,
pervades everything. Man obtains it, and then it is the heart of man;
when things obtain it, then it is the heart of things; when grass,
trees,

birds, and beasts obtain it, then it is the heart of each of these. And
the heart of man, they said, is simply the inborn Buddha, which belongs
to everything that has conscious existence, that infinitesimal particle
of the divine that gives and sustains all. Somewhere, then, in the
universe this divine heart of the cosmos pulsated, and if the Earth was
the centre of the cosmos, then the Earth was its heart and its life.

Just as the unknown author of *De Imago Mundi* had worked out his scheme
of the universe on the image of the Cosmic Egg, John Pordage, an
Englishman of the seventeenth century, developed his mystical theory of
the "Archtypous Globe" as the Cosmic Heart. [Plate XXXV](#img_pl35.md)
gives his drawing of the Eternal World, wherein the Holy Trinity do
manifest themselves, as in a clear Chrystalline Glass or Mirrour." In
it, he discerned three distinct places, the Outward Court, the Inward
Court, or Holy Place, and "the Inmost Court, or the Abysmal Eye in the
centre of the Heart of God, . . . *which essential Eye of* God, *looking
into it* self, *and finding nothing besides it* self, *by dilating it*
self, *gives a beginning and an end to it* self; *which beginning and
entring into, and joyning with one another do constitute and form the
Globe of Eternity* . . . for the *Eye*, turning it self inwards into it
self, comes to know it self, and to see, feel, and taste it self; and if
it *look outward*, it sees nothing but it self neither, *because as the
Eye is God, so is the Globe nothing but the dilation of the Eye* . . .
for the natural formation of a Globe or sphear is by the Centre's
dilating and expanding of it self; a circumference being nothing else
but a centre dilated, or

<span id="page_216">p. 216</span>

a central emanation bounded by it self. . . . I am ashamed to present
you such a dead lifeless figure of it; but no pen can decipher it on
paper, it is only the Spirit of the Eye that can open it self, and give
you the living and ravishing sight of its own essentiality without
similitudes or figures, though I can express it outwardly no better than
I have in the foregoing figure."

Pordage explains the tiny "figure in the Margent," as typifying the Holy
Trinity. The Eye in the midst of the Heart represents the Father, the
Generator of the Son who is the Heart of the Father; and the out flowing
exit of powers, like a breath, represents the Holy Ghost proceeding from
the Father, through the Heart of the Son. Thus the birth of the Holy
Trinity is manifested in the opening of the Eye, to be a Trinity in
Unity; the Eye is in the Heart, and the Heart is the Eye's Centre, and
the Spirit is a proceeding Spirit from the Eye and Heart; and thus they
are one in another, in one Essence, and undivided and inseparable; the
Father is one with the Son, and the Son with the Father; and the Spirit
proceeds from the union of these both, and abides one with them.
Wheresoever the Eye is, there is the Heart; and wheresoever the Eye and
Heart are, there the outgoing of powers streams forth from them."

Map makers are not usually mystics, and certainly there is no indication
that Petrus Apianus, distinguished German mathematician and astronomer
of the sixteenth century, was proposing to do more than make an
extraordinarily beautiful world-map according to a pattern he himself
explains. On Ptolemy's figure of Earth, Apianus

<span id="page_217">p. 217</span>

made his famous "cardiform projections" towards the poles, and obtained
his heart-shaped map of the world. This is one of the earliest maps on
which the just discovered western continents appear under the name of
the Americas. (See Frontispiece [Plate XXXVI](boe00.htm#img_pl36)..md)
