### Lost Land of the West

But there is another obscure tradition of a fifth catastrophe which
seems to have antedated the sinking of Atlantis. This concerns another
lost continent in the Pacific Ocean, a great catastrophe in the western
waters. Old records are riddled with allusions to vanished "Lands--and
peoples--of the West." Old Aztec and Mayan

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

records, that is; the Asiatic records speak of the vanished lands and
peoples "of the East." This old tradition appeared first in modern times
through the assumption of Sclater, an Englishman seeking for some "lost
links," that long, long ago a great southern continent lay stretched
about the South Pole very much as the continental land to-day surrounds
the arctic zone. He named this continent Lemuria, to fix more firmly
thereby his supposition that on such a continent animals of the Lemuroid
type must have been developed. It is a curious instance in scientific
history that when Ernst Haeckel, most material of materialistic
scientists, came upon this Lemurian hypothesis, he promptly incorporated
it into his own working scheme, and in his *The History of Creation* and
*The Evolution of Man* he speaks of Lemurian creatures and Lemurian
traces as if the existence of such a land had been already
scientifically proved. His explanation, which failed to satisfy all
scientists, was that the Lemurian time-cycle was the only supposable
thing that explained certain otherwise inexplicable gaps in the
evolutionary theory.

This prehistoric, pre-Atlantean continent, existing--if it
existed--hundreds of thousands of years ago, has also been called the
Continent of Pan. In *Oahspe, A New Bible in the Words of Jehovih*,
published by John Ballou Newbrough in 1882, there is a world-map showing
the location of this lost Pan in the Pacific Ocean. *Oahspe* makes its
sinking coincident with the Deluge. The sacred people of Pan, the
I’hins--otherwise the Algonkins--had been warned of the coming flood,
and were building ships in which to escape--138 Arks of the Deluge

set out from this Continent of Pan. ". . . in the same day the gates of
heaven and Earth were opened. And the Earth rocked to and fro, as a ship
at sea, and the rains fell in torrents, and loud thunderings came up
from beneath the floor of the world. . . . And the vortex of the

\[paragraph continues\] Earth closed in from the extreme, and lo, the
Earth was broken! A mighty continent was cut loose from its fastenings,
and the fires of the Earth came forth in flames and clouds with loud
roarings. And the land rocked to and fro like a ship at sea. And again
the vortex of the Earth closed in about on all sides, and by the
pressure the land sank down beneath the water, to rise no more." The
Algonkins, oddly enough, have a fascinating word with

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

a fascinating meaning for just such shadowy fables as these. "It is only
*Nitatahakau*," they say; which is to say, "I relate a fable. I am
telling an old story invented for amusement."

This dim continent has also been called the Continent of Mu. And by
"this dim continent" I do not mean to say that Lemuria and Pan and Mu,
or even that conjectural "western crust" of the Earth from which the
Moon

hypothetically sprang, are identical except in this way; that they all
hang together on the same thread of tradition, that something at some
far distant time happened in the centre of the space that is now called
the Pacific basin. We have already seen that a serious modern scientific
theory assigns the origin of the Moon to this planet,

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

and that a supplementary theory suggests the Pacific basin as the place
of the split. We have seen too that a southern continent, antipodal to
Atlantis, has been assumed by evolutionists because something like it
had to be assumed. Col. James Churchward's recent book on *The Lost
Continent of Mu* is a unique and serious study of this traditional
catastrophe in the western waters, carried on over a period of fifty
years, during which time he collected all the collectable evidence on
this theme, that once upon a time in the western ocean a great continent
went down to rise no more.

His material is very interesting. Long-forgotten sacred tablets of India
describe, he says, among other things, the creation of man in the land
of Mu, the mother country of humanity--which land was not the land of
Asia. Records of later date describe the destruction of the land, "when
the earth's crust was broken up by earthquakes, and then sank into a
fiery abyss. Then the waters of the Pacific rolled in over her, leaving
only water where a mighty civilisation had existed." He finds the land
of Mu mentioned by Plato; he finds "the Land of Mu," or "Lands of the
West" in the Troano Manuscript, an ancient Mayan book, and in the Codex
Cortesianus, another Mayan book; he finds it in the Lhasa record, and in
hundreds of other writings in all parts of the world, including India,
Egypt, Greece, Central America, and Mexico.

He says that this continent was a vast one, extending from the north of
Hawaii down towards the south. A line between Easter Island--with its
massive sculptured stones for which no man has ever accounted--and the

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Fijis formed its southern boundary. It measured
over 5,000 miles from east to west, and over 3,000 miles from north to
south. The continent consisted of *three* areas of land, separated from
each other by narrow seas or channels, and on it dwelt 64,000,000 people
divided into "ten tribes" or "peoples." It was called the "Empire of the
Sun," and it was the centre of the whole Earth's civilisation, of its
learning, its art, and its commerce. Its great cities were *seven*, and
its people, being skilled navigators, had sent out colonists to all
parts of the Earth.

But the final one of a series of earthquakes came to Mu, and Col.
Churchward quotes from old records: "'*The whole continent* heaved and
rolled like the ocean's waves. The land trembled and shook like the
leaves of a tree in a storm. Temples and palaces came crashing to the
ground and monuments and statues were overturned. The cities became
heaps of ruins.' As the land rose and fell, quivered and shook, the
fires of the underneath burst forth, piercing the clouds in roaring
flames *three miles in diameter*. There they were met by lightning
shafts which filled the heavens. A thick black pall of smoke
overshadowed the land. 'Huge cataclysmic waves rolled in over the shores
and extended themselves over the plains.' Cities and all things living
went down to destruction before them. 'Agonizing cries of the multitude
filled the air. The people sought refuge in their temples and citadels
only to be driven out by fire and smoke, and the women and the men in
their shining garments and precious stones cried: "Mu, save us!"' . . .
'During the night' the land was torn asunder and rent to pieces. With
thunderous roarings

the doomed land sank. Down, down, down she went, into the mouth of hell,
'a tank of fire.' As the broken land fell into that great abyss of fire,
'flames shot up around and enveloped her.' The fires claimed their
victim. 'Mu and her 64,000,000 people were sacrificed.'" <span

These are the five great traditional catastrophes of the Earth. After
each one of them, according to tradition, the generation of man began
again. Again he began to rebuild his world; again began the quest for
the knowledge--even for the crafts--that he had lost. Almost like the
first men of Earth, he questioned the silent heavens, with no knowledge
or wisdom of his own to aid him in his questions or their
answers--nothing but vague old tales of something that had happened in a
recordless past which had robbed his fathers of a heritage, and had put
him where he was, ignorant and alone. What? and how? and why?
