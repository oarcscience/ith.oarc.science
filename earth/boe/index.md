This is a compendium of theories of the shape of the Earth, along with a
great deal of 'Earth Mystery' lore. Richly illustrated, the Book of
Earths includes many unusual theories, including Columbus' idea that the
Earth is literally pear-shaped, modern theories that the Earth was
originally tetrahedral, and so on. Kenton also covers many traditional
theories including the ancient Babylonians and Egyptians, Hindu and
Buddhist cosmology, and those of the Peruvians, Aztecs and Mongols. She
also discusses modern alternative theories such as that of
[Reed](../potp/index) and [Koresh](../cc/index). Strangely enough, she
misses or ignores the modern flat earth theory of
[Rowbotham](../za/index). This is the only apparent omission in this
definitive study.

Kenton has no apparent axe to grind: this is simply a very readable
survey of the literature. If you have any interest in 'Earth mysteries',
this book is a must-read.

Production notes: The book has no explicit chapter separations. I added
chapter names based on the table of contents and page headers. The
illustrations have been scanned from a first edition of the book; even
still, please understand that the quality of some of the plates were
marginal, and I've used image processing to enhance the worst ones. In
addition, I've added alternate, high resolution, scans of plates
[25](boe17.htm#img_pl25alt) and [28](boe18.htm#img_pl28alt), from the
source book, Waddell's Tibetan Buddhism. Note that the plates in the
Kessinger reprint ended up almost illegible (but all other illustrations
turned out okay). If you want to acquire a copy of this book with better
plates, search a good used book site like
[ABEbooks](https://www.abebooks.com/); original editions of this book
are not particularly rare, or expensive.

After I posted this, Johh Mark Ockerblook of the Online Books page
pointed out that this was actually renewed in a timely fashion. However,
I've decided to leave this online because it appears that the copyright
has been orphaned. If you want to comment on this, please [write
