### Earth-Moon Catastrophe

The second catastrophe to afflict the Earth in the beginning of things
was the Earth-Moon catastrophe; and this, by the way, is not only one of
the most ancient of traditions, but it is also a modern theory of causes
with which

doubled these two bodies as a pair acted upon by the Sun, long before
astronomers had given us the image of Earth-Moon as a beautiful double
planet moving among the

<span id="page_69">p. 69</span>

stars; long before mathematicians had constructed from the interrelated
"pull" of Sun and Moon and Earth the baffling "problem of three bodies,"
before which many a wise man has fallen.

Here is the ancient story of the genesis of the Moon.

Long after the separation of Heaven and Earth, and while Earth was still
in process of being made ready for human life, but before man had been
yet created, it chanced that the line of its course in the heavens was
crossed by that of a great Comet, and that by some heavenly accident,
the two enormous bodies collided. The terrific impact resulted in the
cracking of the Earth's hard shell, and a huge fragment--some traditions
say two--was torn away as violently as Nut was torn, in the Egyptian
myth, from the body of Seb. This fragment of Earth promptly went into
space, and became known as the Moon; and ever since that time Earth and
Moon, Mother and Daughter, have been following each other through the
heavens. As to which is the pursued, which the pursuer, old accounts
vary. But there is always the stable myth of Ceres and Proserpina to
fall back on.

Very soon after Galileo made the first drawing of the Moon, in 1610,
John Wilkins, Lord Bishop of Chester, devised a highly curious little
book, entitled *The Discovery of a New World in the Moone, or, A
Discourse tending to Prove that ’tis probable there may be another
habitable World in that Planet*. Wilkins bulwarks his "guess" with
similar ones of the ancients: "Pythagoreans in general did affirm," he
says, "that the Moone also was Terrestrial, and that she was inhabited
as this lower World.

\[paragraph continues\] . . . . To this opinion of Pythagoras did Plato
also assent . . . we may read often in him and his followers of an
*æthera terra* and a *lunares populi*--an Æthereal Earth and Inhabitants
in the Moone." As their world is our Moon, so our world is their Moon,
he declares, and quotes others

of antiquity, whose Heavens and Elysian Fields were there, where the air
is most quiet and pure. In the frontispiece to his book, he attempts to
show just this relation between them. He goes back to the old Greek myth
of the Earth, and calls the two Ceres and Proserpina. "By the fable of
Ceres," he says, "continually wandering in search of her daughter
Proserpina, it meant nothing else but the longing desire of Men, who
live upon Ceres, Earth, to

attain a Place in Proserpina, the Moon or Heaven," and he held that
"’tis possible for some of our Posterity to find out a Conveyance to
this other World; and, if there be inhabitants there, to have Commerce
with them."

Buffon seems to have been the first of modern scientists to voice the
modern theory of the genesis of the Moon from this then moonless planet.
He followed the push of tradition and made a Comet responsible for the
split. This was in the eighteenth century. But in 1879, George H. Darwin
lifted tradition to the dignity of an hypothetical guess, and suggested,
as a part of his theory of Tidal Evolutions, that the Moon was formerly
a part of the Earth; that it was originally much nearer the Earth than
it is at present, and is now slowly receding from it; that at the time
of the separation of the Earth into Earth and Moon, the planet was
hardly larger than it is to-day; that it was hot, solid, ellipsoidical,
with an interior more or less liquid, revolving on its axis once every
four or five hours, its density increasing and its volume diminishing as
it cooled; that, as its volume lessened, its speed of rotation
increased, until by centrifugal force, the Moon was born, carrying with
it, in its flight into Space, three-quarters of the Earth's crust.

A good deal of interesting discussion followed this new type of
Darwinian theory, and a number of scientists began to speculate on the
precise place of the origin of the Moon, granted that Darwin was right.
Of course--and here again tradition guided them--or had at least
preceded them--they chose the Pacific Ocean basin that holds apart the
scarred coast lines of western North and

\[paragraph continues\] South America, and eastern Asia, the East
Indies, New Zealand, and the Antarctics. One of these speculators amused
himself to good purpose: Plate XII, shows George D. Swazey's
extraordinarily imaginative "quarter Earth" which remained after the
Moon had flown, cracked by great lines of cleavage that were to slowly
split the plastic floating crust into two major continental masses.

Among the old drawings of the Moon, it is difficult to choose--they are
all so beautiful. One drawing, however, must always stand for an example
of the miracles man has wrought in this quest of his--the first drawing
of the Moon ([Fig. 39](#img_fig039).md), made in 1610 by Galileo through
his "Glasse." That tiny lens, compared to the gigantic telescopes of
to-day, amounted to considerably less than a child's toy. But it
magnified a surface three times, and with it Galileo essayed to prove or
disprove Aristotle's theory that "the form and images of the Ocean
appear in the Moon as in a Mirror." "Leaving aside these terrestrial
things," he said, "I have directed my researches towards the. heavens,
beginning with the Moon." He decided very quickly that the Moon had no
mirror-like surface, for he discovered mountains, circular hollows, and
many bright spots which he compared to the eyes in a peacock's tail.
Before he died, he had succeeded in making a glass which magnified
surfaces thirty-two times, and it was not long before the surface of the
Moon was mapped out and named. It was a world so similar in many of its
formations to those of the Earth, that its first map-maker, Hevelius,
simply transferred to the Moon the names of the cities and seas and
mountains of the

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

Earth. But Riccioli, in 1651, renamed its mountains and craters and
supposed lakes and seas, not after places of the Earth, but after the
learned men of the Earth, choosing rather to place their names in the
sky. Instead of lunar Alps or Apennines, there arose on the Moon great
mountain ranges, or plains, or craters bearing the names of Plato,
Ptolemy, Copernicus, Kepler, Tycho; instead of lunar seas called
Caspian, Mediterranean, and the like, there were instead the Seas of
Storms, of Clouds, of Rains: the Seas of Tranquillity, of Serenity, and
the Lake of Dreams--enchanting names which linger to this day.
