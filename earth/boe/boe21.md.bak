### The Square Earth of Cosmas Indicopleutes

ONE OF THE STRANGEST OF WORLDS is the Square Earth of Cosmas
Indicopleustes, an Egyptian monk of the sixth century A.D., who expended
an astonishing ingenuity upon the development of a theory of the
universe that would eliminate the increasingly popular notion that the
Earth was a sphere. He was filled with a holy hatred of the heresy of
the "spherists" and the antipodists, and he evolved at last a figure of
the universe modelled upon the design of the Tabernacle built by Moses
in the wilderness, which, he pointed out, Moses himself had declared to
be constructed upon the pattern of the visible world. His own
explanation of it may be read in his *Christian Topography*.

Cosmas says that the Earth is a rectangular plane surface,

<span id="page_180">p. 180</span>

whose long sides are twice the shorter ones. These are the measurements
of the Tabernacle, and of the Table of Shew-bread. This Earth-table is
divided into three parts: the habitable Earth, in the middle, the ocean
which

everywhere surrounds it, and beyond the ocean another surrounding
continent, which is now altogether inaccessible to man, but which was
once the seat of Paradise and the home of the human race up to the time
of the Deluge, when the flood swept the Ark with its few saved men
across to the "other Earth." It is true, says Cosmas, that after the
Fall Paradise itself had been closed to Adam, but until the Deluge he
and his descendants had dwelt on the coast edges of the First Continent
of man.

<span id="page_181">p. 181</span>

Upon the edges of this outer inaccessible continent rest the four walls
of heaven--four perpendicular planes joined hermetically to the edges of
the trans-oceanic Earth, and cemented at the top by an enclosing roof,
in form like half

a cylinder. Its ends rest on the eastern and western sides of the world,
and its sides on the north and south. These directions are determined by
the Tabernacle Table, which was placed lengthwise from east to west.
Here is a bit from Cosmas himself:

"The Deity accordingly having founded the Earth, which is oblong, upon
its own stability, bound together the extremities of the heaven with the
extremities of the Earth, making the nether extremities of the heaven
rest

<span id="page_182">p. 182</span>

upon the four extremities of the Earth, while on high he formed it into
a most lofty vault over-spanning the length of the Earth. Along the
breadth again of the Earth he built a wall from the nethermost
extremities of the heavens upwards to the summit, and having enclosed
the place, made a house, as one might call it, of enormous size, like an
oblong vapour bath. For, saith the Prophet Isaiah (xlix, 22), *He who
established heaven as a vault*. With regard moreover to the glueing
together of the heaven and the Earth, we find this written in Job: *He
has inclined heaven to earth, and it has been poured out as the dust of
the earth. I have welded it as a square block of stone*." <span
id="fr_13"></span>[1](#fn_13.md)

The interior of this "oblong vaulted vapour bath" consists, like the
Tabernacle, of two parts, the outer and the inner--the veil of the
Tabernacle corresponding to the firmament which divides the universe
into two parts, and which is the floor of the upper and the ceiling of
the lower story. The first story reaches from the Earth-plane, "the
footstool of the Lord," to the firmament, and is the abode of men and
angels. The presence of angels is necessary in man's world, not only for
the sake of their beneficent effect on him, but also because the Sun,
Moon, and stars are carried in their courses, not by the firmament which
is motionless, but by angels appointed to this work until the last day.

On the Earth-plane rises a high cone-shaped mountain, which makes
possible, in this world-system, the rising and the setting of the Sun,
day and night, climates, seasons, etc.

<span id="page_183">p. 183</span>

\[paragraph continues\] With the universe enclosed within a square box,
it was no longer possible for the Sun to sink in western waters, swim
under the Earth, and emerge again from the eastern sea. But forever
circling the conical mountain of the world, in the arms of its carrying
angel, it is hidden from a part of the world all of the time, and thus
comes day and night. The length of the days and nights varies, says
Cosmas, according as the Sun is close to or far from its mountain
screen, and from this cause spring summer and winter, storms, eclipses,
heat and cold, and such phenomena. "All the stars are created," he says,
"to regulate the days and nights, the months and the years, and they
move, not at all by the motion of the heaven itself, but by the action
of certain divine Beings, or *lampadophores*. God made the angels for
his service, and He has charged some of them with the motion of the air,
others with that of the Sun, or the Moon, or the other stars, and others
again with the collecting of clouds, and preparing the rain." Cosmas
also says that men are mistaken when they say that the Sun is much
larger than the Earth; that it is, in reality, very much smaller; and,
by measuring its shadows at the different "climates" of Ptolemy, he
concludes that the sun has the size of "two climates."

Above the firmament and beneath the upper vault live the Blessed. Along
the outer side of this vault which terminates the world, rest the
heavenly waters. The Mosaic account of the Tabernacle and its enclosed
Ark, says Cosmas, gives all the measurements and hence all the secrets
of the world, and by it alone man may reconstruct the universe within
himself and look down upon it, as

<span id="page_184">p. 184</span>

the Creator surveys his handiwork from the vaulted roof of Cosmas's
"vapour bath."

Here are some of the correspondences which Cosmas drew between the
pattern of the Tabernacle and that of the visible world.

In the first Tabernacle, "Moses placed in the south of it the
candlesticks, with seven lamps, after the number of days in the
week--these lamps being typical of the celestial luminaries--and shining
on the table placed in the north of the Earth. On this table again he
ordered to be placed daily twelve loaves of shew-bread, to typify the
three months between each of the four tropics. He commanded also to be
wreathed all around the rim of the table a waved moulding, to represent
a multitude of waters, that is, the ocean; and further, in the circuit
of the waved work, a crown to be set of the circumference of the palm of
the hand, to represent the land beyond the ocean, and encircling it,
where in the east lies Paradise, and where also the extremities of the
heaven are bound to the extremities of the Earth. And from this
description we not only learn concerning the luminaries and the stars
that most of them, when they rise, run their course through the south,
but from the same source we are taught that the Earth is surrounded by
the ocean, and further that beyond the ocean there is another Earth by
which the ocean is surrounded."
