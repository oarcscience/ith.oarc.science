### Figures of Earth

THE BELIEF THAT THE UNIVERSE is composed of five Great Elements is
untraceably old. Even the savage knows very well four of these elements,
Water, Air, Fire, and Earth, and has a vague sense of the fifth, Ether,
or Space. From varying combinations of these five elemental substances,
the ancients believed, all of the phenomena of Nature were formed. Earth
itself was composed, in the last analysis, of these five. Man also, they
believed, was a unique compound of these elements, and was, at death,
resolved back into them. Each of these great "Creatures," as they were
called, was symbolised by a certain shape, and the total figure of the
five different forms, superimposed on

<span id="page_6">p. 6</span>

one another in a regular order, is the *stupa* of China and India, the
*sotoba* or *go-rin* of Japan, the "Five-circle" or "Five-zone" or
"Five-blossom" funeral stone to be found everywhere in the Orient. The
cube represents the Earth or stable foundation on which all builds; the
sphere represents water; the pyramid or triangular tongue, fire or the
elements in motion; the crescent or inverted vault of the

FIGURE I. *The Stupa*. (From *Foe koue ki*, by Fa-heen.)

sky, air or wind; the acuminated sphere or body-pyri-form, ether
tapering into Space.

Of course the old philosophers assigned particular places or grades to
these five elements. Plato gave the first place to fire, the second to
ether, then followed air, water, and lastly Earth. But Aristotle placed
ether first, "as that which is impassable, it being a kind of fifth
body," and after it he placed those elements "that are passable," in the
order of fire, air, water, and Earth.

Sit down with pencil and paper, or, as the first mathematicians did, sit
down on the sea shore and draw with a

<span id="page_7">p. 7</span>

shell on the sands the simple or the complex geometrical figures,
whatever you will. It will be a rather remarkable accident if you happen
to put down a single figure that his not at some time represented either
the figure of Earth directly, or a direct relation of the Earth to the
universe.

<span id="img_fig002"></span> ![FIGURE 2. &lt;i&gt;The
Tetrahedron&lt;/i&gt;.](img/fig002.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 2. *The Tetrahedron*.

Take the five regular solids, for instance: the tetrahedron, the
octahedron, the icosahedron, the cube, and the dodecahedron. The Earth
has been a tetrahedron, and it has been, many, many times, a cube. It
has been conceived of as an eight-sided figure--one of the Siberian

Octahedron&lt;/i&gt;.](img/fig003.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 3. *The Octahedron*.

tribes believes to-day that the octahedron is the true figure of Earth.
It was by way of the "five regular solids," "the five mathematical
bodies," that Kepler, as we shall see later on, sought to solve the
mystery of "distances" in the heavens. Seeking for some fixed relation
of distances between

<span id="page_8">p. 8</span>

the six planets and the Sun, he found, or believed he found, that the
five regular solids fitted between the six spheres in a very curious
order, and he elaborated on

<span id="img_fig004"></span> ![FIGURE 4. &lt;i&gt;The
Icosahedron&lt;/i&gt;.](img/fig004.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 4. *The Icosahedron*.

the nature of these solids and their relation to our solar system all of
his life. The "nature" of the tetrahedron

<span id="img_fig005"></span> ![FIGURE 5. &lt;i&gt;The
Cube&lt;/i&gt;.](img/fig005.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 5. *The Cube*.

was of fire. The nature of the octahedron was of "flying birds." The
nature of the icosahedron was of water. The nature of the cube was of
Earth, even though it fitted into

<span id="page_9">p. 9</span>

place between Saturn and Jupiter, and the nature of the dodecahedron was
that of the celestial vault, or ether.

<span id="img_fig006"></span> ![FIGURE 6. &lt;i&gt;The
Dodecahedron&lt;/i&gt;.](img/fig006.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 6. *The Dodecahedron*.

Earth has been given, also, at one time or another and in one way or
another, all of the pyramidal forms. It has been figured as a
three-sided and as a four-sided pyramid, and likewise as a cone. It has
been a cylinder, filled with compressed air and balanced in the centre
of the universe. It has been, at one time, a "rygge forme,"--"a
three-cornered forme," says Recorde's *The Castle of Knowledge* (1556),
"like the rygge of an house where one syde lyeth flatte, and the other
two leane a slope. And thys forme they judged better for twoo causes.
Firste they thought that it was more steddy than a cube forme, because
it hath a broader foote, and a lesser toppe; and secondly for that they
thought it a more apte forme to walke on and more agreeable to the
nature of the earthe, where sometimes there risyth highe hill, and
sometimes again men may see greate vales descendyng. . . . Againe they
thinke this Rygge forme meetest for the standing of the sea and for the
running of rivers, for in the first forme \[a cube\] if the sea should
rest on the outermost plaine, then wolde it

this seconde forme it mighter reste about the foote of the earthe, and
yet the slope risyng wyll not permit it to over run all the earthe. And
so for rivers if there is no slopenes (as in a cube there is none) then
cannot the rivers runne well."

Already in these dozen geometrical figures we have collected two groups,
one of which, the five regular solids, has been noted. The other one is
that group from which all the known crystalline mineral forms--except
radium and helium--can be constructed--"the eight basic elemental
geometrical magnitudes," with eight definite bounding surfaces that
compose a perfect series.

The first is the sphere with its one and only surface.

The second is the cone with its two surfaces.

The third is the cylinder with its three surfaces.

The fourth is the tetrahedron with its four surfaces.

The fifth is the three-sided tablet with its five surfaces.

The sixth is the cube with its six surfaces.

The seventh is the five-sided tablet with its seven surfaces.

The eighth is the octahedron with its eight surfaces.

And then again the Earth has been represented by a figure quite outside
the angular figures. The sphere, for instance, as a figure of Earth,
appears to be as old as any of the others, and, like all the others, has
undergone the test of recurrence. But an even more curious form has been
ascribed to this still mysterious planet of ours--a spiral. The
beginning, or the end, that is, of a spiral form, like the vine, or like
a watch-spring, which, stretched, or

<span id="page_12">p. 12</span>

 

<span id="img_fig014"></span>

[![FIGURE 14. &lt;i&gt;Spiral forms&lt;/i&gt;.](tn/fig014.jpg)

FIGURE 14. *Spiral forms*.  

 

<span id="page_13">p. 13</span>

sprung, may reach from Earth to Heaven, along which all that lives in
the universe may descend and ascend--a sort of Jacob's ladder without
rungs. Before man had the watch-spring, his own creation, he had before
him the vine--Nature's handiwork, and he used it to symbolise that for
which he was always seeking, the connecting link, the path of
communication between Earth and Heaven.

Of the spiral forms given in [Fig. 14](#img_fig014.md) the two small ones
in the centre are modern drawings of radium and helium atoms, but their
duplicates are to be found in the oldest, crudest pictographs of the
cosmos--man's attempt to represent by a line either Earth's creative
power and strength and energy, or the mysterious, potent force of Nature
itself. The lower spiral is the ordinary right-handed (or dextral) curve
found everywhere in Nature. The upper left-handed (or sinistral) spiral
with its flying birds in opposition is a curious little drawing taken
from *Physiologia Kircheriana Experimentalis* (1680), perhaps suggested
by Leonardo da Vinci's Notebook on "The Flight of Birds," written nearly
two centuries earlier, while he was making his marvellous studies of
spiral formations.

For the great struggle of one element against another, suggested in this
sinistral spiral, was itself to Leonardo the very secret of the
mysterious force which shapes the structure of waves, of reeds, of
animals, of man, of shells and horns and flowers and climbing vines. The
force itself he could not define, but its movement he could trace; and
its path was not a line or a closed circle but a spiral "twist," which
might take the right-handed or the rarer left-handed way. There came to
him what might be called a

<span id="page_14">p. 14</span>

revelation of spirality; and he found the coil of a worm, the curve of
the humblest shell, the wreathing smoke of a candle, the tiny whirl of
street dust, the budding of a fern or a cyclamen, of an onion or a rose,
just as significant as the spiral-like flight of birds or the spiral
formations of water. But thousands of years before him, ancient temples
and tombs and sacred rocks had been engraved with significant "studies"
in spiral forms--many of those of the Eastern world based beyond all
doubt on the struggle of the lotus with the elements and on the analogy
of the lotus to the Earth--even to the cosmos itself. The ancient
*Stupa* ([Fig. 1](#img_fig001).md) was not only a symbol of the five great
elements, but it was also, for the Orient, an almost literal drawing of
the lotus plant, rooted in Earth, climbing through water, by grace of
its inner fire, to air, lifting there its acuminated spherical bud, and
blossoming with a spiral twist into Space. To the ancient mind the
secret path of Nature's immortal force was always most significantly
symbolised by a spiral line, and it was suggested in a thousand ways.

A sphere or a hemisphere may be a solid body, or it may be merely a
shell--and Earth has been again many times imagined as a half shell,
swimming like an upturned basket

or boat, on the surface of limitless waters, not sinking because its
concavity was filled with air which, pressing on the water, balanced the
hollow shell. Or, again, Earth has been, and is still to-day believed by
some to be, "a playne Flatte." "They fantasied," wrote old Recorde,
"that it wold reste most steddily, and so it was very easy to walke on.
We are," he adds, "more beholdynge to those men, for devising our easy
walkynge, than we are

<span id="img_fig017"></span> ![FIGURE 17. ''&lt;i&gt;A playne
Flatte&lt;/i&gt;.''](img/fig017.jpg.md)

bound to them for their wise doctrine. The fourthe secte, fearyng least
by this opinion they should loose the sea and all other waters, imagined
the forme of the earthe more apte to hold water, and devised it hollow
lyke a bolle."

It was always a problem for the early designers of the figure of Earth
to account for the support of the heavens, and this idea of the
habitable Earth "hollow lyke a bolle," was much more clearly and
generally expressed by figurmg the Earth as a flat disc or plain
surrounded by a continuous mountain wall on which the heavens rested.
Only fourteen hundred years ago, with the theory of the spherical Earth
the prevailing scientific one, but with all its vexing by-problems
unsolved--not only that of an un-supported

<span id="page_16">p. 16</span>

sky, but of men forced to walk like flies on the opposite ceiling of the
Earth, one cosmogonist, Cosmas Indicopleustes, disposed of the whole
matter by simply enclosing the entire visible universe in a hollow
rectangular box and shutting down the lid. Man lived inside his box,
like a squirrel in a cage.

<span id="img_fig018"></span> ![FIGURE 18. ''&lt;i&gt;Square like a
box&lt;/i&gt;.''](img/fig018.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 18. ''*Square like a box*.''

The Cosmasian idea was a simpler scheme of world-making than the model
offered in [Fig. 19](#img_fig019.md), but it happens that this simple
geometric figure is very similar to the Babylonian conception of the
universe--Earth as a series of "stages" or steps, pyramidal in
structure, enclosed within a series of concentric spheres. For the idea
that Heaven is round and that Earth is square is very old, as old
perhaps as the square and the circle--the foundation of measure. "Heaven
is round like an opened umbrella," say the Chinese; "Earth is square
like a chessboard." Or, "Earth is square like a box; heaven is round
like the awning of a carriage."

Yet on what, if the Earth is square, may the dome of

<span id="page_17">p. 17</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Heaven rest, not only that it may have firm
support, but also that it may be tightly joined to the Earth? For the
ancients greatly feared that Heaven, illy supported, might

circles&lt;/i&gt;.](tn/fig019.jpg)

FIGURE 19. *Squares, or ''stages,'' within circles*.  

collapse and destroy its foundation; they feared also that, if Heaven
and Earth were not hermetically cemented or glued together, untold
horrors might creep into this universe from some fabulous "outside." For
instance, the circular edge of the heavenly dome might find support

<span id="page_18">p. 18</span>

firm enough by resting on the four quarters of the square Earth, in
spite of the intervening arcs of water it must span. But there would be
the open quarters; and un-known and unimaginable monsters might succeed
in swimming through the depths of water under Heaven's unguarded edge,
and so insinuate themselves into the Earth-waters, with the very
probable result of the destruction of the world. Therefore, said some,
Heaven's edge might very well begin as a square joined tightly to the
Earth-square, and then melt insensibly into the rounded firmament. But,
said others, Heaven is immeasurably high, Earth immeasurably deep; each
covers the other, and both fit tightly together. Whether square or
round, both must be one or the other.

A "six-faced tetrahedron," a solid giving the maximum of surface for the
minimum of volume, represents, according to one theory, the figure of
Earth. This particular

<span id="img_fig020"></span> ![FIGURE 20. &lt;i&gt;The six-faced

theory--a theory, by the way, of the latter nineteenth century--would
seem to argue for the existence of an "economical" universe, with the
Earth modelled on a plan designed to produce the greatest possible
surface from the least possible substance.

FIGURE 21. *The Oval, or "The Mundane Egg."* 

 

<span id="page_20">p. 20</span>

And Earth is also the Mundane Egg, or an Oval form.

"There is another thing in Antiquity," wrote Thomas Burnet in his *The
Theory of the Earth* (1697), "relating to the form and construction of
the Earth, which is very remarkable, and hath obtained throughout all
learned Nations and Ages. And that is the comparison or resemblence of
the Earth to an *Egg* . . . this notion of the Mundane Egg, or that the
World was Oviform, hath been the sence and Language of all Antiquity,
*Latins*, *Greeks*, *Persians*, *Egyptians*, and others."

Burnet did not overstate his case, for this was his theory also. The
concept of the Earth as the Mundane Egg or

<span id="img_fig024"></span> ![FIGURE 24.](img/fig024.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 24.

of the universe as the Cosmic Egg is one of the ancient of ancient
figures of Earth. It appears everywhere, in the mythologies,
cosmogonies, traditions, and folklore of all races and of all times.
Heaven encloses the Earth from without as the shell encloses the yolk.
Or the Earth's

<span id="img_fig025"></span> ![FIGURE 25. ''&lt;i&gt;Convex,
concave&lt;/i&gt;.''](img/fig025.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 25. ''*Convex, concave*.''

crust is the shell of the Mundane Egg; Burnet's whole theory of the
Earth was built on this idea. There is no

<span id="page_21">p. 21</span>

end to the analogy between the egg and the universe, or to the concept
of the Earth as the Egg of the World.

These are some of the geometrical figures by which the Earth and the
universe have been represented. But "shapes" also have been used to
describe it. Shapes are irregular things compared with geometrical
figures, but they may be accurate nevertheless. "Pear-shaped," for

<span id="img_fig026"></span> ![FIGURE 26. ''&lt;i&gt;Right, Crooked,
Mixt&lt;/i&gt;.''](img/fig026.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 26. ''*Right, Crooked, Mixt*.''

instance, is for descriptive purposes just as exact as "triangular" or
"round." And so the Earth has been described and drawn, not only as
"pear-shaped," but as "boat-shaped," as "heart-shaped," as "egg-shaped,"
as "tomato-shaped," as "turnip-shaped," "gourd-shaped," "onion-shaped,"
"lotus-shaped," "rose-shaped." It has been--many times--a tree; a great
island-leaf with roots; a flower; a mountain; an octave in the cosmic
series, or a note in the cosmic scale; or the living body of the "God of
Heaven," the "Universal Man," spanning the space between the highest
heaven and the lowest Earth.

And for the last few hundred years it has been an "oblate spheroid."

But ask science to-day, What is the figure of Earth? and science will
reply not with the geometrical figure of an oblate spheroid, nor with
any definite "shape" drawn for the eye to see, but with a word:

<span id="page_22">p. 22</span>

Earth is a geoid.

Ask, What is a geoid? and science will reply:

An Earth-shaped body.

Ask, What is an Earth-shaped body? and science will answer:

A geoid. A shape, that is, expressed by a word, but not yet by an image.
The mysterious figure of the Earth, the shape peculiar to itself, has
not yet been determined, with all of man's questionings and guesses.
