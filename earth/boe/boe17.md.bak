### Mountains of the World

IN MANY OF THESE WORLD TREE PICTURES we have seem World Mountains as
well, but northern ones mostly. Yet the concept of the antipodal polar
mountains of Earth is very old. They stand opposed to each other in the
Babylonian Universe ([Plate VIII](boe10.htm#img_pl08).md). They are
inherent in the very idea of an Underworld to this Over-world, whether
the idea is carried to its logical conclusion or not. As above, so
below. If the World Mountain of

the North was the abode of gods, the abode of demons was--the World
Mountain of the South. [Fig. 53](#img_fig053.md) illustrates

<span id="page_123">p. 123</span>

not only the antipodal mountains of a spherical Earth, but also the
"four quarters of the Earth," the abode of gods, of living men, of dead
men, and of demons, beginning with the northern mountain and descending
to the south.

It may be it is only because the popular concept of the figure of Earth
swung more or less uniformly to that of a sphere after the western world
was discovered, and all the continents of the Earth were mapped out,
that we are apt to think the spherical concept is a modern one. As a
matter of historical fact the Greeks established it in the minds of
philosophers by at least 500 B.C., and it is certain that the idea did
not originate with them. Its origin, like the origin of most of these
concepts, is trackless, if for no other reason than that the concept of
Earth as the Mundane Egg--a spheroid form--goes back into untraceable
antiquity. More and more it seems that, in order to explain any of these
recurrences, we must take almost literally Fechner's conception of a
great reservoir in which lie pooled the memories of all of the Earth's
vanished inhabitants, which now and then "opens," to let a little spill
out into the minds of a few living men. For more and more it begins to
appear as if always, somewhere on the Earth, all of these figures of
Earth have existed in the minds of some of its people. Perhaps it may
mean that the Earth has been all of these things, at different stages of
its development, that it is constantly changing, never the same; that
its changes are its life, and that, far from being a disintegrating,
dying planet, it is a continuously evolving one, always undergoing the
mysterious process of creation. But this is only a guess.

<span id="page_124">p. 124</span>

Certainly, thanks to the symmetrical speculations of the Pythagorean and
Platonian Greeks, the theory of the antipodal region and the antipodal
race of beings was so much a part of the science of the day, that it
seemed necessary to St. Augustine, a thousand years later (fifth century
A.D.) to establish some sort of a theory of the figure of the Earth,
which, although retaining its supposed spherical

<span id="img_fig054"></span> ![FIGURE 54. &lt;i&gt;The Theory of Two
Centres. Spherical Earth with no Antipodes.&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;After
Rainaud&lt;/i&gt;.)&lt;br&gt; (From &lt;i&gt;The Siege of the South
Pole&lt;/i&gt;; H. R. Mill, 1905.)](img/fig054.jpg.md)  
FIGURE 54. *The Theory of Two Centres. Spherical Earth with no
Antipodes.* (*After Rainaud*.)  
(From *The Siege of the South Pole*; H. R. Mill, 1905.)

form, should nevertheless cast the theory of the antipodes into
everlasting disrepute. The theory of two centres," or the theory that
the Earth was composed of two spheres, one of land, and one of water,
contained one within the other, but not concentric, solved the problem
exactly of retaining the sphere and rejecting the antipodes. The
terrestrial globe rose a little from the watery sphere, and it was, of
course, the northern part of the Earth which so rose. When it was
objected to, by some, on the ground that only lighter elements rise to
the surface of water, and the denser irresistibly sink, the two-centre
theorists

<span id="page_125">p. 125</span>

promptly replied that the terrestrial sphere rose only a little from the
water, as an egg, plunged into a water-filled basin, would rise a little
to the surface; and they asserted farther that these two spheres
signified the true meaning of the "separation" of land from water. But
Strabo, several hundred years before, facing the problem of the density
of the elements, accounted for it much more simply. It was true, he
said, that by nature the water was higher in situation than the Earth,
and in the beginning of things compassed it all about like a sphere. But
since Providence designed to create animals and chiefly man, a creature
not belonging to the water, God therefore "raised the Earth," and caused
it to dwell in diverse places; and in others he sunk it and made it
hollow, that the waters might lie hid, and that dry land might appear
over it and thus afford a seat for man and other animals of the land.

What made the Early Church combat the idea of a southern habitable
hemisphere was not so much the difficulty of explaining how men could
stand "feet to feet," as the difficulty of explaining why races of men,
all sons of Adam, should be utterly cut off and separated from each
other by the impassable belt of fire that circled the Earth. There
seemed no reason or purpose in this that could be called divine; this
was the heresy. But it was also true that the literal mechanics of an
inhabited antipodal region, without the convenient theory of gravitation
to explain everything, was too much for reasonable man to accept without
an admirable struggle.

"What are they," said Lactantius, a fourth-century

<span id="page_126">p. 126</span>

\[paragraph continues\] Father of the African Church, "that think there
are Antipodes, such as walk with their Feet against ours? do they speak
with any likelihood; or is there any one so foolish as to believe that
there are Men whose Heels are higher than their Heads? that things which
with us do lie on the Ground, do hang there? that the Plants and Trees
grow downwards, that the Hail, and Rain, and Snow fall upwards to the
Earth? and do we admire the hanging

FIGURE 55. ''*Feet to Feet*.''  
(From *Physiologia Kircheriana Experimentalis*, 1680.)

\[paragraph continues\] Orchards among the Seven Wonders; whereas here
the Philosophers have made the Fields and Seas, the Cities and Mountains
hanging? What shall we think, that Men do cling to that Place like
Worms, or hang by their Claws as Cats? or if we suppose a Man a little
beyond the Center, to be digging with a Spade, is it likely (as it must
be according to this Opinion) that the Earth which he loosened, should
of itself ascend upwards? Or else suppose two Men with their Middles
about the Center, the Feet of one being placed where the Head of the
other is, and so two other Men cross them, yet all these Men thus
situated, according to this Opinion should stand upright; and many

other gross Consequences would follow, which a false Imagination is not
able to fancy as possible."

<span id="img_sep00"></span> ![](img/sep00.jpg)

IN THE *Universe of the Lamas* ([Plate XXV](#img_pl25).md) we come upon the
very greatest of the Mountains of the World, Mount Meru, the universal
hub, the support of all the worlds. Meru is also the "Garden of the Tree
of Life," for the Jambu or Rose Apple World Tree springs from it. This
Tibetan Universe is not only a beautiful but a complex universe as well,
and it is going to be difficult to describe its many divisions simply
and directly. <span id="fr_10"></span>[1](#fn_10.md)

But first of all, say the Lamas of Tibet, this world of ours is merely
one of a series, which all together form a universe or Chiliocosm of
which again there are many. Each universe is set like a jewel in
illimitable space, upon a warp or woof of "blue air" or wind. Crossed
thunder-bolts are the symbols of this "blue air," which is hard and
indestructible, like a diamond. Upon this "warp" or "woof" is set "the
body of the waters," and upon this is a foundation of pure gold, on
which is set the Earth. From the Earth's axis soars Mount Meru, crown of
the world, which rises to a height of 84,000 miles before it is
surrounded by the heavens. It is likened to "the handle of a millstone,"
and half way up its southern side is the Jambu, or Rose Apple Tree, the
object of combat between the gods and the Titans. From its root four
inexhaustible rivers

<span id="page_128">p. 128</span>

take their source. It bears an immortal fruit, like gold, which falls
into the rivers, and from its scattered pips comes the golden seed which
is carried down to the sea, and is, sometimes, washed up again on its
shores.

In the ocean about Mount Meru lie the four continents, each with two
attending "satellites," and all with bases of solid gold in the form of
a tortoise. But the continents are separated from the sacred Meru by
seven "stages" or golden mountains, between which flow seven oceans of
seven substances: fragrant milk which is churned by the gods, curds,
butter, blood or sugar-cane juice, poisons or wine, fresh water, and
salt water. Encircling all these divisions is a double iron wall which
shuts off the light of the Sun and the Moon of each universe from all
the space which intervenes between it and the succeeding universe. No
ray of light illumines the void between the "thousand-thousand"
universes. This is the "outer darkness."

The orbit of the Sun or "glazed fire," and of the Moon or "glazed
water," is the summit of the innermost ring of mountains, called "The
Yoke." Between these two heavenly bodies hang the jewelled umbrella of
the kings and the banner of Victory--these are shown in the figure. In
their realm of air, on this same plane, live the eight angelic
"mothers."

The "four continents" are placed exactly in each of the four directions,
and they are of four different shapes, corresponding to the four forms
of the four elements ([Fig. 1](boe06.htm#img_fig001).md). To the north lies
the cube or earth-shaped body; to the west the sphere or water-shaped
body; to the south the triangle or fire-shaped body, and to the east the

crescent or air-shaped body. Of the four continents, they say that all
except Jambudvipa (F) are fabulous, but they are described as follows:

"On the *East* is *Videha*, or 'vast body' (P). This is shaped like the
crescent moon, and is white in colour. It is 9,000 miles in diameter,
and the inhabitants are described as tranquil and mild, and of excellent
conduct, and with faces of the same shape as this continent, *i.e.*,
crescentic, like the moon.

"On the *South* is *Jambudvipa* (F), or our own world, and its centre is
the Bodhi-tree at Budh Gaya. It is shaped like the shoulder-blade of a
sheep . . . is blue in colour; and it is the smallest of all, being only
7,000 miles in diameter. Here abound riches and sin as well as virtue.
The inhabitants have faces of similar shape to that of their continent,
*i.e.*, somewhat triangular.

"On the *West* is *Godhanya*, or 'wealth of oxen' (I), which in shape is
like the sun and red in colour. It is 8,000 miles in diameter. Its
inhabitants are extremely powerful and (as the name literally means cow
+ ox + action) they are believed to be specially addicted to eating
cattle, and their faces are round like the sun.

"On the *North* is *Uttara-Kuru*, or 'northern *Kuru*'--tribe (M), of
square shape and green in colour, and the largest of all the continents,
being 10,000 miles in diameter. Its inhabitants are extremely fierce and
noisy. They have square faces like horses; and live on trees, which
supply all their wants. They become tree-spirits on their death; and
these trees afterwards emit 'bad sounds.'

"The satellite continents resemble their parent continent

<span id="page_130">p. 130</span>

in shape, and each is half its size. The left satellite of Jambudvip,
namely, 'The ox-tail-whisk continent,' is the fabulous continent of the
Rakshas, to which Padmasambhava is believed to have gone and to be still
reigning there. And each of the latter presents towards Mount Meru one
of the following divine objects respectively, *viz.*, on the east (?
south) the mountain of jewels, named *Amolikha*, shaped like an
elephant's head, and on the south, the wish-granting tree, on the west
the wish-granting cow, and on the north the self-sprung crops."

As for Mount Meru--some say that these four gifts of the left satellites
are situated on the sides of Meru itself--which has square sides of gold
and of jewels. Its eastern face is crystal or silver, like the colour of
the eastern continent. The southern face is sapphire or *lapis lazuli*.
The west side is of ruby, and the north side is gold. Mount Meru is
always covered with fragrant flowers and herbs.

It has four lower compartments under the heavens. The lowest is
inhabited by the Yaksha genii holding wooden plates. Above live the
"wreath-holders." Above these dwell the "Eternally exalted ones," and
above them the Titans, the race of beings who contend always with the
gods for the Jambu or Rose Apple Tree. Originally gods, the Titans were,
like Satan, thrown out of heaven, and their place in the Tibetan system
is intermediate between heaven and Earth.

Above the Titans, at a distance of 168,000 miles, are the realms of the
gods. In the lowest compartment are the "four great guardian kings of
the quarters," the white guardian of the East, the green guardian of the
South, the

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

red guardian of the West, and the yellow guardian of the North, who
forever guard the heavens against attacks of outer demons. The eight
great classes of supernatural beings are subjects of these kings, and
these guardians of the four quarters are aided by the ten *Lokpals* who
watch the ten directions, that is, the eight points of the compass, and
above, and below.

World-picture&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt; (From &lt;i&gt;Mythology of All

FIGURE 56. *A Kalmuck World-picture*.  
(From *Mythology of All Races*, Vol. IV, 1927.)

A Kalmuck World-picture ([Fig. 56](#img_fig056).md) is quite worth
comparing with this. Universe of the Lamas, for the Kalmucks, now of
Russia, primitively inhabited China. They arrived on the shores of the
Caspian Sea about 1600, but they brought with them their own conception
of the world, with its colours and shapes. This drawing shows Mount
Su-meru in the centre of the world, through whose centre the World Tree
springs. Sometimes they will say

<span id="page_131">p. 131</span>

that each of the four mountain sides bears a tree. Su-meru is shaped,
they believe, like a truncated pyramid, and around it are seven
mountains and seven seas not represented in this drawing. The nearer a
mountain ring is to the central mountain, the higher it is, they
believe; and the higher the mountain rings, the farther they are from
each other. The Kalmucks say also that the distance of each from the
central mountain is the same as its height.

The colours of the four sides of the truncated Su-meru are like those of
the Tibetan Meru, and the Kalmucks also place four continents in the
four quarters, each of a different shape, and each accompanied by two
smaller "islands" of like shape; so that again the total number of
islands surrounding the centre of the world is the zodiacal twelve. The
Tibetan Jambudvip--the southern continent--which was "shaped like the
shoulder-blade of a sheep," and whose inhabitants had faces shaped
similarly, "somewhat triangular," is slightly modified in the Kalmuck
picture to an oval continent inhabited by an oval or "egg-faced" race.
But it is almost the same; an "oval" such as this is hardly more than an
expanded or expanding triangle and the egg-shaped islands and faces may
be called with a fair accuracy "somewhat triangular."

No claim for particular beauty and certainly no claim for any antiquity
is made for the Chinese hemisphere shown in [Fig. 57](#img_fig057.md),
drawn, says Dr. Du Bose, by a monk in Soochow, who perceived that times
were changing, that the new geography was of a spherical Earth and not
of a "World Mountain," but who realised that the North Pole is
permanent--if anything is. He therefore drew a conventional

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

modern hemisphere with its lines of latitude and longitude, over which
he traced Europe-Asia-Africa; and then, upon the top of the world,
raised his World Mountain,

<span id="img_fig057"></span> ![FIGURE 57. &lt;i&gt;Mount Su-Meru of the
Chinese&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br&gt; (From &lt;i&gt;Dragon, Image and

FIGURE 57. *Mount Su-Meru of the Chinese*.

peerless Su-meru, spine and marrow of "the thirty-three heavens," and
situated in the very centre of the world. Its shape is ordinarily that
of an inverted cone, whose medial line is cut by the Earth's surface,
whose base is above, and whose apex penetrates the Earth to a distance
equalling the distance of its base from the Earth. Or, as the Chinese
explain it, "Its depth in the sea is equal to its altitude (in the
air)." In the undersea division are the

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

countless hells. The unknown monk of Soochow made his Sacred Mountain
resemble a pagoda more than a cone when he compromised with a new age,
but a simple projection of the pagoda lines will result in a figure
quite cone-like.
