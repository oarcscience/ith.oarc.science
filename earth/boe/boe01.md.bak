### ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

WITHOUT THE ROUSED INTEREST and cordial co-operation of many people this
collection of representations of the Earth and its relation to the
Universe would have been impossible. For permission to use copyright
material I am indebted to D. Appleton and Company, the Clarendon Press,
the Cambridge University Press, Cassell & Co., Ltd., Gall and Inglis,
the Guiding Star Publishing House, the Kosmon Press, Luzac & Co.,
Marshall Jones Company, Macmillan & Co., Ltd., Popular Astronomy,
Frederick A. Stokes Company, Edward Stanford, Ltd., and the New York
*World*; and also to Col. James Churchward, Dr. E. A. Wallis Budge, Dr.
William Fairfield Warren, Mr. Marshall B. Gardner, Miss Mary Elizabeth
Litchfield, Mrs. Richard Folkard, and Mrs. Daniel G. Brinton. For
assistance in tracing material I owe thanks to various members of the
staffs of the Metropolitan Museum, the Museum of the American Indian,
Heye Foundation, the Museum of the Hispanic Society of America, the
Museum of the University of Pennsylvania, the American Geographical
Society, the Swedenborg Library of the Church of the New Jerusalem,
Brooklyn, the New York Society Library, and the New York Public Library.
In various translations I was aided by Dr. Arthur Livingston of Columbia
University, and by an unknown member of the staff of the Biblioteca
Nacional de Habana. Mr. Andrew Dasberg gave valuable

suggestions in the choice and arrangement of various figures and plates.
Special thanks are due Mrs. Mabel Reber without whose researches through
numberless volumes this book would have lacked many of the
representations it contains. Special thanks are also due many members of
the staff of the New York Public Library in which most of these figures
of Earth and the Universe were collected.
