### Wheels upon Wheels

BELOW IS A GROUP OF EIGHT FIGURES whose whole interest lies just in
their association. With their science we have nothing to do here, since
they are old attempts, most of them, to account for the observed
aberrations of movement among the heavenly bodies. Wang Ch’ung, an old
Chinese philosopher, expressed a part of this still unsolved problem
very oddly and simply indeed. Writing of the complex movements of the
Sun and the Moon in relation to the heavens, he said: That Heaven turns
sideways to the left "like a millstone"; that the Sun and Moon move to
the right, but are swept by Heaven to the left; that their real movement
is towards the east, but they are carried by Heaven towards the west,
where they "go down"; that *they resemble ants creeping to the left side
on a millstone turning to the right*, but that the millstone, being much
swifter than the ants, compels them to follow it to the right.

Old astronomers, however, employed two devices to aid them in their
calculations; one to account for the seeming difference observed in the
speed of the Sun's movement in its orbit; the other to account for the
seeming alternation of direction in the movements of the planets.

The Sun, for instance, when describing a certain segment

of its orbit, travelled at a greater speed--or so it seemed--than when
it moved in the corresponding opposite quarter. To the Sun, therefore,
was given a place in the heavens called the Excentric sphere--it was
another theory of two centres. For it was assumed that all the

heavenly spheres were not concentric, did not, that is, have the Earth's
centre as a common centre; and that the centre of one sphere of
revolution might be a point a little removed from the centre of the
Earth. According to this theory, when the Sun was near the Earth, its
speed would appear much greater than when it was moving at a distance
farther away.

1\. Epicycle of the Moon. 2. Surrounding sphere, destined to keep the
diameter from apogee to perigee in its place, always coinciding with the
diameter of the sphere (4); "Let us give it a suitable thickness, but
not too great, so as not to take up too much space." 3. Sphere which
corresponds to the smaller sphere, and the diameter of which is equal to
the distance of the centre of the deferent in the Ptolemaic system from
the centre of the Earth. 4. Sphere with a diameter twice as great as
(3). 5. Carrying sphere concentric with the world and occupying the
concavity of the sphere (6), the equator of which is in the plane of the
lunar orbit.

\(2\) and (4) and (5) revolve in the same period, that in which the
centre of the epicycle performs a revolution; (3) revolves in half that
time, while (6) revolves in the opposite direction with the same speed
as the apogee of the excentric.

The figure now shows how the epicycle moves to and fro along the
diameter of (4), and during the revolution of the circle (5) describes a
closed curve, about which Nasir-Eddin justly says that *it is somewhat
like a circle but is not really one*, for which reason it is not a
perfect substitute for the excentric circle of Ptolemy.

To account for the seeming alternation of direction in the movements of
the planets, the theory of the Epicycle was evolved. This meant,
briefly, that a planet did not

move directly in the circumference of its revolving sphere or cycle--as,
for instance, the Sun moved in its excentric sphere, but in an epicycle
or small circle that revolved around a fixed point in the larger circle
and carried the

<span id="page_232">p. 232</span>

planet with it; "fixed to its inner surface," says an old Arabian
astronomer, "like a pearl on a ring, touching the surface in one point."
For a time these devices of the excentric and the epicycle seemed to
work fairly well;

but after a while the astronomers found themselves entangled in such a
maze of centrics and excentrics, cycles and epicycles, and spheres
heaped upon spheres, that they never found their way out of the
labyrinth they had themselves constructed, and eventually the system
that was to

<span id="page_233">p. 233</span>

account for all the mysteries of the heavenly movements fell of itself.

Dante's favorite description of the heavens was "wheels upon wheels,"
and Jagmini's diagram ([Fig. 93](#img_fig093).md) shows the "excentric
wheel" of the Sun, itself a solid spherical body the edges of whose
wheel touch two other surfaces, in the common centre of which is the
Earth. But the centre of

FIGURE 97. *The relation of the harmony of the Microcosmos to the

(From *Microcosmi Historia*; Robert Fludd, 1621.)

the excentric sphere is not "the centre of the world." For there were
"pulls" in the heavens that resulted in constantly shifting centres.
Nasir-Eddin Attûsi, great Arabian astronomer of Jagmini's century,
attempted to account for the various lunacies of the heavens by,
literally, "the spots on the moon." These spots, he assumed, are caused
by other bodies moving in its epicycle and un-equally exposed to its
light, and this phenomenon he calls "the anomaly of illumination." The
movements of the five planets, particularly those of Mercury and Venus,
required, he said, "the introducing of a system of guiding spheres," and
this theory, when fully worked out ([Fig. 94](#img_fig094).md)

<span id="page_234">p. 234</span>

gave him, for the path of Mercury, not the excentric circle of Ptolemy,
nor a circle at all, but a curious closed curve

with unequal radii which he described as "somewhat like a circle, but
not really one."
