### PREFACE

The subject treated of in the following pages has during the last few
years attracted much attention, thanks to the influence of Prof. C.
Piazzi Smyth's important work, "Life and Work at the Great Pyramid." It
was to test, by the light of history, the conclusion accepted by that
writer as to the inspired origin of the Great Pyramid that I entered
upon a consideration of the subject. That such an origin was required by
the facts, I did not suppose, but the conviction was forced on me that
the structure had much more importance, viewed as a scientific and
religious monument, than was generally conceded. I found nothing,
however, to show that either its design or its construction necessitated
Divine intervention. I was led to the conclusion, nevertheless, that the
builders of the Great Pyramid intended to perpetuate certain scientific
ideas, and, moreover, that they had a religious motive in its erection.
There is little doubt, indeed, that it is a monument of Sabaism—the
worship of the heavenly host, which had a wide extension in the ancient
world, and with which "Serpent worship" was intimately connected. The
importance of the Great Pyramid as a religico-scientific structure is
still further increased if, as is not improbable, it was intended to
mark the substitution of an astronomy based on the passage of the sun
through the twelve signs of the Zodiac for the lunar astronomy which
preceded it. My endeavour has been

<span id="page_v">p. v</span>

to state fairly the historical conditions of the problem considered, and
to point out the direction in which its solution must be sought. With
the question as to the original source from which the wisdom of the
Ancients, of which the Great Pyramid is so wonderful a monument, was
derived, these pages are not concerned.

The Serpent, enclosed in a pyramid, given on the cover, is taken from a
gem figured in Matter's "Histoire Critique du Gnosticism," *planche* II
B, figure 2. It is there said to be the Solar Chnouphis or
Agathodemon—Christos, with the seven sons of Sophia (Wisdom), the seven
planetary genii.

The substance of this little work was read as a Paper before the Hull
Literary Club on the 13th March, 1882.
