### CHAPTER V

#### SETH AND SERPENT WORSHIP

THE association of the name of the god Seth with the Great Pyramid—a
structure which appears to embody or to bear a relation to the chief
scientific truths recognised by the ancient world, throws light on
certain ideas entertained as to the nature of that deity. The god of
intelligence of the Egyptians was Thoth, the Hermes of the Sabæans.
Hermes was, however, called the son of Seth, and this deity is in some
sense to be identified with Thoth. In a passage of the Book of the Dead,
the former has the name Tet which, according to Bunsen, intimates that
Thoth inherited many of the attributes of Seth. <span
id="fr_67"></span>[\*](#fn_67.md) It may, indeed, show that they are the
same deity. Seth was the true god of Wisdom, and the pillars of Seth, on
which, according to Josephus, <span id="fr_68"></span>[†](#fn_68.md) was
inscribed the astronomical knowledge of the

<span id="page_71">p. 71</span>

ancient world, were the same as those mentioned in an apocryphal work
ascribed to Hermes, which, according to Cedrenus, affirmed that "Enoch,
foreseeing the destruction of the Earth, had inscribed the science of
astronomy upon two pillars." <span id="fr_69"></span>[\*](#fn_69.md) By
these structures was probably intended the two great pyramids of Ghizeh,
which appear originally to have had many inscriptions on their external
coverings. Makrizi cites various authors as to the origin of the
Pyramids, and among other statements it was said that that they were
built by Surid, and that the First was dedicated to history and
astronomy, and the Second to medical knowledge. <span
id="fr_70"></span>[†](#fn_70.md) As Seth, Thoth, or Hermes was the god of
Wisdom, so the serpent was its emblem, and especially connected with
that God and with other deities of similar characteristics. "Wise as
serpents. <span id="fr_71"></span>[‡](#fn_71.md) and harmless as doves," is
an old saying, which probably has a deeper meaning than that usually
ascribed to it. The connection between the serpent and the idea

<span id="page_72">p. 72</span>

of wisdom is well seen in the Hindu legend as to the Nagas. Mr.
Fergusson remarks, "the Naga appears everywhere in Vaishnava tradition.
There is no more common representation of Vishnu than as reposing on the
Sesha, the celestial seven-headed snake, contemplating the creation of
the world." The Upanishads refer to the science of serpents, by which is
meant the wisdom of the mysterious Nagas who, according to Buddhistic
legend, reside under Mount Meru, and in the waters of the terrestrial
world. One of the sacred books of the Tibetan Buddhists is fabled to
have been received from the Nagas, who, says Schlagentweit, are
"fabulous creatures, of the nature of serpents, who occupy a place among
the beings superior to man, and are regarded as protectors of the law of
the Buddha. To these spiritual beings Sakyamuni is said to have taught a
more philosophical religious system than to men, who were not
sufficiently advanced to understand it at the time of his appearance."
The serpent holds an analogous place in the religious ideas of the
modern Hindus. Siva, <span id="fr_72"></span>[\*](#fn_72.md) as Sambhu, is
the patron of the Brahmanic

<span id="page_73">p. 73</span>

order, and, as shown by his being three-eyed, is essentially a god
possessing high intellectual attributes. Vishnu also is a god of wisdom,
but (notwithstanding the association with him of the Sesha), of a
somewhat lower type, such as is distinctive of the worshippers of truth
under its feminine aspect. The serpent has been connected with the god
of Wisdom from the earliest times of which we have any historical
notice. This animal was the especial symbol of Thoth or Taut, a primeval
deity of Syro-Egyptian mythology, and of all those gods, such as Hermes
and Seth, who can be connected with him. This is true also of the third
member of the primitive Chaldean triad, Héa or Hoa. According to Sir
Henry Rawlinson, the most important titles of this deity refer to "his
functions as the source of all knowledge and science." Not only is he
"the intelligent fish," but his name may be read as signifying both
"life" and a "serpent," and he may be considered as "figured by the
great serpent which occupies so conspicuous a place among the symbols of
the gods on the black stones recording Babylonian benefactions." M.
Lenormant identifies Héa with the fish-god Oannes of Babylonian
mythology, who, according to

<span id="page_74">p. 74</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Berosus, "spent
the whole day amongst men without taking any food, while he taught them
letters, science, and the principles of every art, the rules for the
foundation of towns, the building of temples, the measurement and
boundaries of lands, seed-time and harvest, in short, all that could
advance civilization, so that nothing new has been invented since that
period." <span id="fr_73"></span>[\*](#fn_73.md) Héa, as the god of
Science, was the defender of "the frame of nature against the incessant
ravages of the wicked spirits," and "help was sought from him when
neither word, rite, talisman, nor even the intervention of any other of
the gods had availed to destroy the demons’ power." <span
id="fr_74"></span>[†](#fn_74.md) The Chaldean god was moreover, the healer
of disease, <span id="fr_75"></span>[‡](#fn_75.md) in which character he
resembled the God of the Hebrews, the sight of whose serpent-symbol was
supposed to cure those bitten by the fiery serpents in the wilderness.
There is reason to believe <span id="fr_76"></span>[§](#fn_76.md) that this
deity was the same as Seth, the Agathodæmon of the early Egyptians, who
was represented under the form of the serpent,

<span id="page_75">p. 75</span>

and who was the giver of happiness and good fortune. <span
id="fr_77"></span>[\*](#fn_77.md) The good genius which presided over the
affairs of men as the guardian spirit of their houses was a serpent, the
Asp of Ranno, the snake-headed goddess who is represented as nursing the
young princes. That the idea of health was among the Egyptians
intimately associated with the serpent, is shown, moreover, by the crown
formed of the asp, or sacred *Thermuthis*, having been given
particularly to Isis, a goddess of Life and Healing. It was also the
symbol of other gods of health and the like attributes, as stated by the
learned Dupuis in the chapters entitled "Esculapius, Serapis, Pluto,
Esmun, Cneph, and all the divinities with the attributes of the
serpent" <span id="fr_78"></span>[†](#fn_78.md) is remarkable that a Moslem
saint of Upper Egypt is still thought to appear under the form of a
serpent, and to cure the diseases which afflict the pilgrims to his
shrine. The power of healing is an evidence of the possession of wisdom,
and so also

<span id="page_76">p. 76</span>

is the power of influencing atmospheric changes. This is a most
important attribute, and, as Mr. Fergusson points out, a chief
characteristic of the serpents throughout the East in all ages seems to
have been their power over the wind and rain. According to Colonel
Meadows Taylor, in the Indian Deccan, at the present day, offerings are
made to the village divinities (of whom the nag, or snake, is always
one) at spring time and harvest for rain or fine weather, and also in
time of cholera or other diseases or pestilence. So, among the Chinese,
the dragon is regarded. as the giver of rain, and in time of drought
offerings are made to it. In the spring and fall, of the year it is one
of the objects worshipped, by command of the Emperor, by certain
mandarins. The Chinese notion of the serpent or dragon dwelling above
the clouds in spring to give rain reminds us of the Aryan myth of
Vritra, or Ahi, the throttling snake, or dragon with three heads, who
hides away the rain-clouds, but who is slain by Indra, the beneficent
giver of rain. M. Bréal says, <span id="fr_79"></span>[\*](#fn_79.md) that
"Typhon is the monster who obscures the heavens, a sort of Greek
Vritra." The myth of Indra and Vritra is reproduced in

<span id="page_77">p. 77</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Latin mythology as
that of Hercules and Cacus. Cacus also is analogous to Typhon, and as
the former is supposed to have taken his name from, or given it to, a
certain wind which had the power of clothing itself with clouds, so the
latter bore the same name as a very destructive wind which was much
dreaded by the Phoenicians and Egyptians. Moreover, the name Typhon was
given by the Egyptians to anything tempestuous and hence to the Ocean.

We have here a reference to the serpent as the embodiment of the Evil
Being; and in the later identification of Seth with Typhon, the enemy of
Osiris, we have evidence of the connection of the serpent with the
former deity. M. Lenormant tells us that, "evil was personified in a
particular god, Set or Soutekh, <span id="fr_80"></span>[\*](#fn_80.md)
called also sometimes Baal, who was the supreme god of the neighbouring
Asiatic populations, and, at a later period, of the shepherd kings; the
Greeks considered him the same as their Typhon, and it was said that
Osiris [had succumbed](errata.htm#6.md) to his blows." <span
id="fr_81"></span>[†](#fn_81.md)

<span id="page_78">p. 78</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> The name Typhon
appears to have been given more especially to the Evil Being, as the
opponent of Horus, who was, however, the same deity as Osiris, whose son
he was said to be. The former was then represented as Apap or Apophis,
or the giant serpent, who was pierced by the spear of Horus, as the
serpent Pytho was slain by Apollo. <span id="fr_82"></span>[\*](#fn_82.md)
Henceforth Seth, instead of being regarded by the Egyptians as the
Agathodæmon, was looked upon as the principle of evil. The same change
took place among the Accadian population of Media. M. Lenormant states
that the "worship of serpent-gods is found amongst many of the Turanian
tribes. The Accadians made the serpent one of the principal attributes,
and one of the forms of Héa." When once, however, "the Iranian
traditions were fused with the ancient beliefs of the Proto-Medic
religion, the serpent-god naturally became identified with the
representative of the dark and bad principle, for, according to the
Mazdean myths, the serpent was the form assumed by

<span id="page_79">p. 79</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Angromainyus, in
order to penetrate into the heaven of Ahuramazda." <span
id="fr_83"></span>[\*](#fn_83.md) Here is the conflict between light and
darkness, and between life and death, which is reproduced in Egyptian
mythology, where the evil principle is represented in the one case by
the serpent Apap, and in the other by Set <span
id="fr_84"></span>[†](#fn_84) (Seth.md), whose symbol was the serpent.

The association between the serpent and the idea of darkness had an
astronomical foundation. The position which the constellation Draco at
one time occupied showed that the Great Serpent was the ruler of the
night. This constellation was formerly at the very centre of the
heavens, and it is so extensive, that it was called the Great Dragon.
Its body spreads over seven signs of the Zodiac, and Dupuis, who sees in
the Dragon of the Apocalypse a reference to the celestial serpent, says,
"It is not astonishing that a constellation so extended should be
represented by the author of that book as a great dragon with seven
heads, who drew the third part of the stars from heaven and cast them to
the earth." <span id="fr_85"></span>[‡](#fn_85.md)

<span id="page_80">p. 80</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Moreover, when the
constellation Draco occupied its elevated position, it supplied the
polestar of the heavens. The importance of this fact, in connection with
the erection of the Great Pyramid, will be understood after what has
been said as to the association of the Pyramid with the god Seth. That
structure was erected, not only as a tomb for its founder, but as a
monumental temple in honour of a deity whose special symbol was the
serpent, the emblem of wisdom with the primitive race whose religion
would appear to have been a combination of serpent-worship and Sabaism.
The Great Pyramid is thus a monument not only of Sabaism, but of
serpent-worship, and, as such, its scientific as well as its
astronomical character receives the proper explanation. The builders of
such a temple would apply their utmost skill in its construction and
they would seek to preserve in it, as far as possible, the scientific
knowledge which they had derived from their ancestors.

According to a Coptic MS., upon the walls of the Pyramids were written
the mysteries of science, astronomy, geometry, physic, and much useful
knowledge. The same MS. states, that they were built before the Flood by
Surid, for

<span id="page_81">p. 81</span>

safety, and as tombs for himself and household. <span
id="fr_86"></span>[\*](#fn_86.md) It is remarkable that, as Sir Gardner
Wilkinson points out, Tuphán, which appears to be the same word as
Typhon, the name of the Evil Being, is the Arabic name of the
Deluge. <span id="fr_87"></span>[†](#fn_87.md) The association of the
Pyramids with a flood has, however, a purely astronomical explanation.
Mr. Proctor, when speaking of the position of the pole-star Alpha
Draconis, at the date of the erection of the Great Pyramid, says, <span
id="fr_88"></span>[‡](#fn_88.md) "We know that in the past the
constellation of the Dragon was at the pole, or boss, of the celestial
sphere. In stellar temples, like those of which Rawlinson gives
examples, the Dragon would be the uppermost or ruling constellation. And
here, in passing, it may interest the reader to note that, some find
evidence in this relation that when writers of old spoke of the Old
Dragon as having been cast from heaven, carrying two-thirds of the
celestial beings with him, reference was made—unconsciously, perhaps, on
the narrator's part

<span id="page_82">p. 82</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> —to some tradition
of the passing away or fall of the Dragon from its former ruling
position among the constellations. Those who thus interpret ancient
records (much more ancient than Jewish history), find in Hercules, with
his heel assailed by the serpent, as in our constellation figures, the
first Adam; in Ophinchus, the serpent holder, the second Adam. In Argo
they find the Ark—in fact, in a whole series of constellations they find
the story of the Flood. In Aquarius, with the streams pouring from his
water-jug, they find the beginning of the Flood. In the river Eridanus
and the seas in which Pisces and the great sea-monster Cetus seem to
swim, they see pictured the prevalence of deep water over the whole
earth. The Raven of the Heavens is the raven of the Flood-narrative.
Argo is the Ark, shown as if only the stern-half of a great ship lodged
in the mountain. The Centaur, bearing sacrifice, as Aratus says, to Ara,
the altar, is Noah offering sacrifice after he had left the Ark; and the
bow of Sagittarius in the smoke (the Milky-way), which seems to ascend
from the altar, is the bow of promise. These may, of course, be only
fancies, but it is singular how closely these constellations, which are
among

<span id="page_83">p. 83</span>

the few really seeming to picture recognisable objects in the heavens,
correspond in sequence and in range of right ascension with the events
recorded respecting the Flood." <span id="fr_89"></span>[\*](#fn_89.md)

Fancies or not, it is unquestionable that the Deluge has been associated
in the legends of some Eastern peoples, not only with the
Pyramids, <span id="fr_90"></span>[†](#fn_90.md) but also with the
constellations. Thus it is with the Chaldean legend, according to which
Saturn in a dream announced the coming catastrophe to Xixutrus, who,
like Noah, escaped in an ark. The Assyrian tablets discovered by the
late Dr. Smith, and which contain what is called the Nimrod Epic, have
preserved a similar account of the Deluge. It is now established that
the twelve cantos of that Epic "refer to the annual course of the sun
through the twelve months of the year. Each tablet answers to a special
month, and contains a distinct reference to the animal forms in the
signs of the Zodiac." Thus, "the Deluge forms the subject of the
eleventh canto, corresponding

<span id="page_84">p. 84</span>

with the month of Skebat (Feb.-Jan.), which is consecrated to Rimmon,
the god of storms and rain, and harmonises with the eleventh sign of the
Zodiac—Aquarius, or the Waterman. The latter month is styled in
Sumerish-Accadian 'the month of the curse of the rain,' or, as we might
almost say, the Deluge month." <span id="fr_91"></span>[\*](#fn_91.md) The
ancient Babylonians are usually accredited with the invention of the
worship of the heavenly bodies, and the existence among them of the
deluge myth in connection with the constellations is an important fact.
It is no less important in relation to the question of the object of the
Great Pyramid, that the capital of Babylonia contained a structure
described by Strabo as a pyramid dedicated to the worship of the
planetary bodies, exceeding in size the great Egyptian monument itself,
and much resembling the Egyptian Pyramid of Degrees at Sakkarah. The
Babylonian Tower was at the base a square of 600 feet, and consisted of
eight towers, each 75 feet high, one above the other, making a total
height of 600 feet. M. Lenormant speaks of the erection of this temple
as having been attributed

<span id="page_85">p. 85</span>

to "the most ancient king, the first king," and he says it was "the
tangible expression, the material and architectural manifestation, of
the Chaldaic-Babylonian religion. Serving both as a sanctuary and as an
observatory for the stars, it agreed admirably with the genius of the
essentially siderial religion to which it was united by an indissoluble
bond" <span id="fr_92"></span>[\*](#fn_92.md)—language which might be used
with exactly the same propriety of the Great Pyramid itself.

That the erection of the Great Pyramid had some connection with the
constellations is not at all improbable. We have already seen that Mr.
Proctor prefers the date 3350 B.C. to the later one of 2170 B.C. for the
building of the pyramid. The latter date would seem, however, to be the
more probable one. That it was erected during the reign of Cheops <span
id="fr_93"></span>[†](#fn_93.md) is almost universally admitted; and,
although the time when he reigned has not been satisfactorily
established, there are grounds for believing it to have been about 2200
B.C. Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth affirms that

<span id="page_86">p. 86</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> "the only
monumental conclusion formed by comparing the quarry marks of the Great
Pyramid with whatever is to be trusted, or is tolerably agreed upon
among Egyptologists, and both of them with an astronomical date of the
buildings,—can be no other than that two of the kings of the Fourth
Dynasty of Egyptian history—Shofo and Nu-Shofo by name—lived through a
period including the epoch of 2170 B.C." <span
id="fr_94"></span>[\*](#fn_94.md) It is true that, as Prof. Smyth points
out, this date differs from that fixed by nearly all modern
Egyptologists, <span id="fr_95"></span>[†](#fn_95.md) although it agrees
very nearly with the date 2228 B.C., assigned for the commencement of
the Fourth Dynasty by Mr. Wm. Osburn, the author of the "Monumental
History of Egypt." It is consistent, moreover, with the chronological
facts given by Dr. Birch. This Egyptologist gives 3000 B.C. for the
commencement of the first dynasty; and if this Dynasty continued for 263
years, the Second Dynasty for 306 years, and the Third Dynasty for 214
years, as stated by Manetho, we have 2223 B.C. as the date of

<span id="page_87">p. 87</span>

the commencement of the Fourth Dynasty, and therefore of the erection of
the Great Pyramid, if Cheops was its builder. Curiously enough, however,
this is about the date fixed for the origin of the constellations. Mr.
Proctor states that between 2100 and 2200 years before the Christian era
the southern constellations had their original position, the invisible
southern pole then lying at the centre of the space free from
constellations. He adds, "It is noteworthy that for other reasons this
period, or rather a definite epoch within it, is indicated as that to
which must be referred the beginning of exact astronomy. Amongst others
must be mentioned this—that in the year 2170 B.C. *quam proxime*, the
Pleiades rose to their highest above the horizon at noon (or technically
made their noon culmination) at the spring equinox. We can readily
understand that to minds possessed with full faith in the influence of
the stars on the earth, this fact would have great significance." At
that epoch the southernmost constellations would be seen in their
natural position—standing upright when above the southern horizon at
midnight. On those grounds, Mr. Proctor affirms that the period when the
old southern constellations

<span id="page_88">p. 88</span>

were formed must have been between 2400 and 2000 years before the
Christian era, He deems it highly probable, moreover, that the year 2170
B.C. may be regarded as the date, not of the beginning of astronomy, but
of the introduction of a new astronomical system, the substitution of
the use of the twelve zodiacal signs for that of the twenty-eight lunar
mansions. Assuming that conclusion to be correct, we have a most
remarkable coincidence between the date of the invention of the Zodiac
and that of the erection of the Great Pyramid. If it is true, however,
as Dupuis supposed, that the Egyptians invented the constellations, the
agreement between those dates was probably more than a coincidence. The
French writer remarks, "The figures traced in the Zodiac and in the
other constellations have not been placed there haphazard: they are the
hieroglyphic calendar of the ancient peoples; they are connected with
their wants and their climate; and they all have a meaning in their
origin, although it may be difficult for us now to discover the sense of
all the symbols." Dupuis shows what was the primitive position of the
constellations, considered as the astronomical and rural calendar of

<span id="page_89">p. 89</span>

a people both intellectual and agricultural, and he affirms that it
accords perfectly with the agriculture of Egypt, and at the same time
with the position of the solstitial and equinoctial points in the
heavens at a certain epoch. Moreover, owing to the difference in the
order of agricultural operations followed in Egypt from that in other
climates, the rural calendar which fitted the Egyptians could not suit
any other people, and therefore he ascribes to them the honour of having
invented the astronomical sciences; a conclusion supported, it is said,
by the fact that the Egyptians regarded their Zodiac, not only as a
rural and meteorological calendar, but as the base of all their religion
and of their astronomy. <span id="fr_96"></span>[\*](#fn_96.md) M.
Flammarion appears to doubt whether Dupuis has satisfactorily
established his theory of the origin of the constellations, <span
id="fr_97"></span>[†](#fn_97.md) and the date fixed by Mr. Proctor for the
formation of the Zodiac is hardly consistent with that theory. It is
possible, however, that whilst the constellations were formed by the
Chaldeans long before that date, the zodiacal signs were only then
arranged

<span id="page_90">p. 90</span>

in an order to accord with the climate of Egypt by settlers in this
country. Mr. Proctor, after fixing the probable limits of the place
where the constellations were formed, at from 35 to 39 degrees north of
the equator, says, "The Great Pyramid, as we know, is about 30 degrees
north of the Equator; but we also know that its architects travelled
southwards to find a suitable place for it. One of their objects may
have been to obtain a fuller view of the star-sphere south of their
constellations." <span id="fr_98"></span>[\*](#fn_98.md) This suggestion is
a very important one, for it assumes that the constellations were formed
before the erection of the Pyramid, and therefore that the date of the
latter event cannot have been earlier than that of the former. Mr.
Proctor goes further, however, and even suggests that one of the objects
which the architects of the Great Pyramid may have had was "the erection
of a building indicating the epoch when the new system was entered upon,
and defining in its proportions, its interior passages, and other
features, fundamental elements of the new system." The construction of
that building implies considerable proficiency in astronomical
observation,

<span id="page_91">p. 91</span>

and hence, says Mr. Proctor, "the year 2170 B.C. may very well be
regarded as defining the introduction of a new system of astronomy, but
certainly not the beginning of astronomy itself. <span
id="fr_99"></span>[\*](#fn_99.md)" That year becomes, however, the date of
the pyramid itself, and in the suggestion that it was intended to
commemorate the substitution of the twelve zodiacal signs for the
twenty-eight lunar mansions, we have a strong confirmation of the
opinion expressed in these pages that the Great Pyramid was a monument
of Sabaism, and that it was erected in honour of Seth, the Agathodæmon
of the ancient world, and consecrated to his worship.
