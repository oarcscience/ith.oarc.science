<p>The subject treated of in the following pages has during the last few years attracted much attention, thanks to the influence of Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth's important work, "Life and Work at the Great Pyramid." It was to test, by the light of history, the conclusion accepted by that writer as to the inspired origin of the Great Pyramid that I entered upon a consideration of the subject. That such an origin was required by the facts, I did not suppose, but the conviction was forced on me that the structure had much more importance, viewed as a scientific and religious monument, than was generally conceded. I found nothing, however, to show that either its design or its construction necessitated Divine intervention. I was led to the conclusion, nevertheless, that the builders of the Great Pyramid intended to perpetuate certain scientific ideas, and, moreover, that they had a religious motive in its erection. There is little doubt, indeed, that it is a monument of Sabaism&#151;the worship of the heavenly host, which had a wide extension in the ancient world, and with which "Serpent worship" was intimately connected. The importance of the Great Pyramid as a religico-scientific structure is still further increased if, as is not improbable, it was intended to mark the substitution of an astronomy based on the passage of the sun through the twelve signs of the Zodiac for the lunar astronomy which preceded it. My endeavour has been</p>  
<p><a name="page_v"><font size="1" color="green">p. v</font></A></p>  
<p>to state fairly the historical conditions of the problem considered, and to point out the direction in which its solution must be sought. With the question as to the original source from which the wisdom of the Ancients, of which the Great Pyramid is so wonderful a monument, was derived, these pages are not concerned.</p>  
<p>The Serpent, enclosed in a pyramid, given on the cover, is taken from a gem figured in Matter's "Histoire Critique du Gnosticism," <i>planche</i> II B, figure 2. It is there said to be the Solar Chnouphis or Agathodemon&#151;Christos, with the seven sons of Sophia (Wisdom), the seven planetary genii.</p>  
<p>The substance of this little work was read as a Paper before the Hull Literary Club on the 13th March, 1882.</p>
