A SHORT CATECHISM OF ALCHEMY

Q. What is the chief study of a Philosopher?  
A. It is the investigation of the operations of Nature.

Q. What is the end of Nature?  
A. God, Who is also its beginning.

Q. Whence are all things derived?  
A. From one and indivisible Nature.

Q. Into how many regions is Nature separated?  
A. Into four palmary regions.

Q. Which are they?  
A. The dry, the moist, the warm, and the cold, which are the four
elementary qualities, whence all things originate.

Q. How is Nature differentiated?  
A. Into male and female.

Q. To what may we compare Nature?  
A. To Mercury.

Q. Give a concise definition of Nature.  
A. It is not visible, though it operates visibly; for it is simply a
volatile spirit, fulfilling its office in bodies, and animated by the
universal spirit-the divine breath, the central and universal fire,
which vivifies all things that exist.

Q. What should be the qualities possessed by the examiners of Nature?  
A. They should be like unto Nature herself. That is to say, they should
be truthful, simple, patient, and persevering.

Q. What matters should subsequently engross their attention?  
A. The philosophers should most carefully ascertain whether their
designs are in harmony with Nature, and of a possible and attainable
kind; if they would accomplish by their own power anything that is
usually performed by the power of Nature, they must imitate her in every
detail.

Q. What method must be followed in order to produce something which
shall be developed to a superior degree than Nature herself develops
it.  
A. The manner of its improvement must be studied, and this is invariably
operated by means of a like nature. For example, if it be desired to
develop the intrinsic virtue of a given metal beyond its natural
condition, the chemist must avail himself of the metallic nature itself,
and must be able to discriminate between its male and female
differentiations.

Q. Where does the metallic nature store her seeds?  
A. In the four elements.

Q. With what materials can the philosopher alone accomplish anything?  
A. With the germ of the given matter; this is its elixir or
quintessence, more precious by far, and more useful, to the artist, than
is Nature herself. Before the philosopher has extracted the seed, or
germ, Nature, in his behalf, will be ready to perform her duty.

Q. What is the germ, or seed, of any substance?  
A. It is the most subtle and perfect decoction and digestion of the
substance itself; or, rather, it is the Balm of Sulphur, which is
identical with the Radical Moisture of Metals.

Q. By what is this seed, or germ, engendered?  
A. By the four elements, subject to the will of the Supreme Being, and
through the direct intervention of the imagination of Nature.

Q. After what manner do the four elements operate?  
A. By means of an incessant and uniform motion, each one, according to
its quality, depositing its seed in the centre of the earth, where it is
subjected to action and digested, and is subsequently expelled in an
outward direction by the laws of movement.

Q. What do the philosophers understand by the centre of the earth?  
A. A certain void place where nothing may repose, and the existence of
which is assumed.

Q. Where, then, do the four elements expel and deposit their seeds?  
A. In the ex-centre, or in the margin and circumference of the centre,
which, after it has appropriated a portion, casts out the surplus into
the region of excrement, scoriae, fire, and formless chaos.

Q. Illustrate this teaching by an example.  
A. Take any level table, and set in its centre a vase filled with water;
surround the vase with several things of various colours, especially
salt, taking care that a proper distance intervenes between them all.
Then pour out the water from the vase, and it will flow in streams here
and there; one will encounter a substance of a red colour, and will
assume a tinge of red; another will pass over the salt, and will
contract a saline flavour; for it is certain that water does not modify
the places which it traverses, but the diverse characteristics of places
change the nature of water. In the same way the seed which is deposited
by the four elements at the centre of the earth is subject to a variety
of modifications in the places through which it passes, so that every
existing substance is produced in the likeness of its channel, and when
a seed on its arrival at a certain point encounters pure earth and pure
water, a pure substance results, but the contrary in an opposite case.

Q. After what manner do the elements procreate this seed?  
A. In order to the complete elucidation of this point, it must be
observed that there are two gross and heavy elements and two that are
volatile in character. Two, in like manner, are dry and two humid, one
out of the four being actually excessively dry, and the other
excessively moist. They are also masculine and feminine. Now, each of
them has a marked tendency to reproduce its own species within its own
sphere. Moreover, they are never in repose, but are perpetually
interacting, and each of them separates, of and by itself, the most
subtle portion thereof. Their general place of meeting is in the centre,
even the centre of the Archeus, that servant of Nature, where coming to
mix their several seeds, they agitate and finally expel them to the
exterior.

Q. What is the true and the first matter of all metals?  
A. The first matter, properly so called, is dual in its essence, or is
in itself of a twofold nature; one, nevertheless, cannot create a metal
without the concurrence of the other. The first and the palmary essence
is an aerial humidity, blended with a warm air, in the form of a fatty
water, which adheres to all substances indiscriminately, whether they
are pure or impure.

Q. How has this humidity been named by Philosophers?  
A. Mercury.

Q. By what is it governed?  
A. By the rays of the Sun and Moon.

Q. What is the second matter?  
A. The warmth of the earth -otherwise, that dry heat which is termed
Sulphur by the Philosophers.

Q. Can the entire material body be converted into seed?  
A. Its eight-hundredth part only-that, namely, which is secreted in the
centre of the body in question, and may, for example, be seen in a grain
of wheat.

Q. Of what use is the bulk of the matter as regards its seed?  
A. It is useful as a safeguard against excessive heat, cold, moisture,
or aridity, and, in general, all hurtful inclemency, against which it
acts as an envelope.

Q. Would those artists who pretend to reduce the whole matter of any
body into seed derive any advantage from the process, supposing it were
possible to perform it?  
A. None; on the contrary, their labour would be wholly unproductive,
because nothing that is good can be accomplished by a deviation from
natural methods.

Q. What, therefore, should be done?  
A. The matter must be effectively separated from its impurities, for
there is no metal, how pure soever, which is entirely free from
imperfections, though their extent varies. Now all superfluities,
cortices, and scoriae must be peeled off and purged out from the matter
in order to discover its seed.

Q. What should receive the most careful attention of the Philosopher?  
A. Assuredly, the end of Nature, and this is by no means to be looked
for in the vulgar metals, because, these having issued already from the
hands of the fashioner, it is no longer to be found therein.

Q. For what precise reason?  
A. Because the vulgar metals, and chiefly gold, are absolutely dead,
while ours, on the contrary, are absolutely living, and possess a soul.

Q. What is the life of metals?  
A. It is no other substance than fire, when they are as yet imbedded in
the mines.

Q. What is their death?  
A. Their life and death are in reality one principle, for they die, as
they live, by fire, but their death is from a fire of fusion.

Q. After what manner are metals conceived in the womb of the earth?  
A. When the four elements have developed their power or virtue in the
centre of the earth, and have deposited their seed, the Archeus of
Nature, in the course of a distillatory process, sublimes them
superficially by the warmth and energy of the perpetual movement.

Q. Into what does the wind resolve itself when it is distilled through
the pores of the earth?  
A. It resolves itself into water, whence all things spring; in this
state it is merely a humid vapour, out of which there is subsequently
evolved the principiated principle of all substances, which also serves
as the first matter of the Philosophers.

Q. What then is this principiated principle, which is made use of as the
first matter by the Children of Knowledge in the philosophic
achievement?  
A. It is this identical matter, which, the moment it is conceived,
receives a permanent and unchangeable form.

Q. Are Saturn, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, the Sun, the Moon, etc., separately
endowed with individual seed?  
A. One is common to them all; their differences are to be accounted for
by the: locality from which they are derived, not to speak of the fact
that Nature completes her work with far greater rapidity in the
procreation of silver than in that of gold, and so of the other metals,
each in its own proportion.

Q. How is gold formed in the bowels of the earth?  
A. When this vapour, of which we have spoken, is sublimed in the centre
of the earth, and when it has passed through warm and pure places, where
a certain sulphureous grease adheres to the channels, then this vapour,
which the Philosophers have denominated their Mercury, becomes adapted
and joined to this grease, which it sublimes with itself; from such
amalgamation there is produced a certain unctuousness, which, abandoning
the vaporous form, assumes that of grease, and is sublimised in other
places, which have been cleansed by this preceding vapour, and the earth
whereof has consequently been rendered more subtle, pure, and humid; it
fills the pores of this earth, is joined thereto, and gold is produced
as a result.

Q. How is Saturn engendered?  
A. It occurs when the said unctuosity, or grease, passes through places
which are totally impure and cold.

Q. How is Venus brought forth?  
A. She is produced in localities where the earth itself is pure, but is
mingled with impure sulphur.

Q. What power does the vapour, which we have recently mentioned, possess
in the centre of the earth?  
A. By its continual progress it has the power of perpetually rarefying
whatsoever is crude and impure, and of successively attracting to itself
all that is pure around it.

Q. What is the seed of the first matter of all things?  
A. The first matter of things, that is to say, the matter of
principiating principles is begotten by Nature, without the assistance
of any other seed; in other words, Nature receives the matter from the
elements, whence it subsequently brings forth the seed.

Q. What, absolutely speaking, is therefore the seed of things?  
A. The seed in a body is no other thing than a congealed air, or a humid
vapour, which is useless except it be dissolved by a warm vapour.

Q. How is the generation of seed comprised in the metallic kingdom?  
A. By the artifice of Archeus the four elements, in the first generation
of Nature, distil a ponderous vapour of water into the centre of the
earth ; this is the seed of metals, and it is called Mercury, not on
account of its essence, but because of its fluidity, and the facility
with which it will adhere to each and every thing.

Q. Why is this vapour compared to sulphur?  
A. Because of its internal heat.

Q. From what species of Mercury are we to conclude that the metals are
composed?  
A. The reference is exclusively to the Mercury of the Philosophers, and
in no sense to the common or vulgar substance, which cannot become a
seed, seeing that, like other metals, it already contains its own seed.

Q. What, therefore, must actually be accepted as the subject of our
matter?  
A. The seed alone, otherwise the fixed grain, and not the whole body,
which is differentiated into Sulphur, or living male, and into Mercury,
or living female.

Q. What operation must be afterwards performed  
A. They must be joined together, so that they may form a germ, after
which they will proceed to the procreation of a fruit which is conformed
to their nature.

Q. What is the part of the artist in this operation?  
A. The artist must do nothing but separate that which is subtle from
that which is gross.

Q. To what, therefore, is the whole philosophic combination reduced?  
A. The development of one into two, and the reduction of two into one,
and nothing further.

Q. Whither must we turn for the seed and life of meals and minerals?  
A. The seed of minerals is properly the water which exists in the
centre  
And the heart of the minerals.

Q. How does Nature operate by the help of Art?  
A. Every seed, whatsoever its kind, is useless, unless by Nature or Art
it is placed in a suitable matrix, where it receives its life by the
coction of the germ! and by the congelation of the pure particle, or
fixed grain.

Q. How is the seed subsequently nourished and preserved?  
A. By the warmth of its body.

Q. What is therefore performed by the artist in the mineral kingdom?  
A. He finishes what cannot be finished by Nature on account of the
crudity of the air, which has permeated the pores of all bodies by its
violence, but on the surface and not in the bowels of the earth.

Q. What correspondence have the metals among themselves?  
A. It is necessary for a proper comprehension of the nature of this
correspondence to consider the position of the planets, and to pay
attention to Saturn, which is the highest of all, and then is succeeded
by Jupiter, next by Mars, the Sun, Venus, Mercury, and, lastly, by the
Moon. It must be observed that the influential virtues of the planets do
not ascend but descend, and experience teaches us that Mars can be
easily converted into Venus, not Venus into Mars, which is of a lower
sphere. So, also, Jupiter can be easily transmuted into Mercury, because
Jupiter is superior to Mercury, the one being second after the
firmament, the other second above the earth, and Saturn is highest of
all, while the Moon is lowest. The Sun enters into all, but it is never
ameliorated by its inferiors. It is clear that there is a large
correspondence between Saturn and the Moon, in the middle of which is
the Sun; but to all these changes the Philosopher should strive to
administer the Sun.

Q. When the Philosophers speak of gold and silver, from which they
extract their matter, are we to suppose that they refer to the vulgar
gold and silver?  
A. By no means; vulgar silver and gold are dead, while those of the
Philosophers are full of life.

Q. What is the object of research among the Philosophers?  
A. Proficiency in the art of perfecting what Nature has left imperfect
in the mineral kingdom, and the attainment of the treasure of the
Philosophical Stone.

Q. What is this Stone?  
A. The Stone is nothing else than the radical humidity of the elements,
perfectly purified and educed into a sovereign fixation, which causes it
to perform such great things for health, life being resident exclusively
in the humid radical.

Q. In what does the secret of accomplishing this admirable work
consist?  
A. It consists in knowing how to educe from potentiality into activity
the innate warmth, or the fire of Nature, which is enclosed in the
centre of the radical humidity.

Q. What are the precautions which must be made use of to guard against
failure in the work?  
A. Great pains must be taken to eliminate excrements from the matter,
and to conserve nothing but the kernel, which contains all the virtue of
the compound.

Q. Why does this medicine heal every species of disease?  
A. It is not on account of tile variety of its qualities, but simply
because it powerfully fortifies the natural warmth, which it gently
stimulates, while other physics irritate it by too violent an action.

Q How can you demonstrate to me the truth of the art in the matter of
the tincture?  
A. Firstly, its truth is founded on the fact that the physical powder,
being composed of the same substance as the metals, namely, quicksilver,
has the faculty of combining with these in fusion, one nature easily
embracing another which is like itself. Secondly, seeing that the
imperfection of the base metals is owing to the crudeness of their
quicksilver, and to that alone, the physical powder, which is a ripe and
decocted quicksilver, and, in itself a pure fire, can easily communicate
to them its own maturity, and can transmute them into its nature, after
it has attracted their crude humidity, that is to say, their
quicksilver, which is the sole substance that transmutes them, the rest
being nothing but scoriae and excrements, which are rejected in
projection.

Q. What road should the Philosopher follow that he may attain to the
knowledge and execution of the physical work?  
A. That precisely which was followed by the Great Architect of the
Universe in the creation of the world, by observing how the chaos was
evolved.

Q. What was the matter of the chaos?  
A. It could be nothing else than a humid vapour, because water alone
enters into all created substances, which all finish in a strange term,
this term being a proper subject for the impression of all forms.

Q. Give me an example to illustrate what you have just stated.  
A. An example may be found in the special productions of composite
substances, the seeds of which invariably begin by resolving themselves
into a certain humour, which is the chaos of the particular matter,
whence issues, by a kind of irradiation, the complete form of the plant.
Moreover, it should be observed that Holy Scripture makes no mention of
anything except water as the material subject whereupon the Spirit of
God brooded, nor of anything except light as the universal form of
things.

Q. What profit may the Philosopher derive from these considerations, and
what should he especially remark in the method of creation which was
pursued by the Supreme Being?  
A. In the first place he should observe the matter out of which the
world was made; he will see that out of this confused mass, the
Sovereign Artist began by extracting light, that this light in the same
moment dissolved the darkness which covered the face of the earth, and
that it served as the universal form of the matter. He will then easily
perceive that in the generation of all composite substances, a species
of irradiation takes place, and a separation of light and darkness,
wherein Nature is an undeviating copyist of her Creator. The Philosopher
will equally understand after what manner, by the action of this light,
the empyrean, or firmament which divides the superior and inferior
waters, was subsequently produced; how the sky was studded with luminous
bodies; and how the necessity for the moon arose, which was owing to the
space intervening between the things above and the things below; for the
moon is an intermediate torch between the superior and the inferior
worlds, receiving the celestial influences and communicating them to the
earth. Finally he will understand how the Creator, in the gathering of
the waters, produced dry land.

Q. How many heavens can you enumerate?  
A. Properly there is one only, which is the firmament that divides the
waters from the waters. Nevertheless, three are admitted, of which the
first is the space that is above the clouds. In this heaven the waters
are rarefied, and fall upon the fixed stars, and it is also in this
space that the planets and wandering stars perform their revolutions.
The second heaven is the firmament of the fixed stars, while the third
is the abode of the supercelestial waters.

Q. Why is the rarefaction of the waters confined to the first heaven?  
A. Because it is in the nature of rarefied substances to ascend, and
because God, in His eternal laws, has assigned its proper sphere to
everything.

Q. Why does each celestial body invariably revolve about an axis?  
A. It is by reason of the primeval impetus which it received, and by
virtue of the same law which will cause any heavy substance suspended
from a thread to turn with the same velocity, if the power which impels
its motion be always equal.

Q. Why do the superior waters never descend?  
A. Because of their extreme rarefaction. It is for this reason that a
skilled chemist can derive more profit from the study of rarefaction
than from any other science whatsoever.

Q. What is the matter of the firmament?  
A. It is properly air, which is more suitable than water as a medium of
light.

Q. After the separation of the waters from the dry earth, what was
performed by the Creator to originate generation?  
A. He created a certain light which was destined for this office; He
placed it in the central fire, and moderated this fire by the humidity
of water and by the coldness of earth, so as to keep a check upon its
energy and adapt it to His design.

Q. What is the action of this central fire?  
A. It continually operates upon the nearest humid matter, which it
exalts into vapour; now this vapour is the mercury of Nature and the
first matter of the three kingdoms.

Q. How is the sulphur of Nature subsequently formed?  
A. By the interaction of the central fire and the mercurial vapour.

Q. How is the salt of the sea produced?  
A. By the action of the same fire upon aqueous humidity, when the aerial
humidity, which is contained therein, has been exhaled.

Q. What should be done by a truly wise Philosopher when he has once
mastered the foundation and the order in the procedure of the Great
Architect of the Universe in the construction of all that exists in
Nature?  
A. He should, as far as may be possible, become a faithful copyist of
his Creator. In the physical chaos he should make his chaos such as the
original actually was; he should separate the light from the darkness :
he should form his firmament for the separation of the waters which are
above from the waters which are below, and should successively
accomplish, point by point, the entire sequence of the creative act.

Q. With what is this grand and sublime operation performed?  
A. With one single corpuscle, or minute body, which, so to speak,
contains nothing but faeces, filth, and abominations, but whence a
certain tenebrous and mercurial humidity is extracted, which contains in
itself all that is required by the Philosopher, because, as a fact, he
is in search of nothing hut the true Mercury.

Q. What kind of mercury, therefore, must he make use of in performing
the work? A. Of a mercury which, as such, is not found on the earth, but
is extracted from bodies, yet not from vulgar mercury, as it has been
falsely said.

Q. Why is the latter unfitted to the needs of our work?  
A. Because the wise artist must take notice that vulgar mercury has an
insufficient quantity of sulphur, and he should consequently operate
upon a body created by Nature, in which Nature herself has united the
sulphur and mercury that it is the work of the artist to separate.

Q. What must he subsequently do?  
A. He must purify them and join them anew together.

Q. How do you denominate the body of which we have been speaking?  
A. The RUDE STONE, Or Chaos, or Iliaste, or Hyle--that confused mass
which is known but universally despised.

Q. As you have told me that Mercury is the one thing which the
Philosopher must absolutely understand, will you give me a
circumstantial description of it, so as to avoid misconception?  
A. In respect of its nature, our Mercury is dual--fixed and volatile; in
regard to its motion, it is also dual, for it has a motion of ascent and
of descent; by that of descent, it is the influence of plants, by which
it stimulates the drooping fire of Nature, and this is its first office
previous to congelation. By its ascensional movement, it rises, seeking
to be purified, and as this is after congelation, it is considered to be
the radical moisture of substances, which, beneath its vile scoriae,
still preserves the nobility of its first origin.

Q. How many species of moisture do you suppose to be in each composite
thing?  
A. There are three--the Elementary, which is properly the vase of the
other elements; the Radical, which, accurately speaking, is the oil, or
balm, in which the entire virtue of the subject is resident--lastly, the
Alimentary, the true natural dissolvent, which draws up the drooping
internal fire, causing corruption and blackness by its humidity, and
fostering and sustaining the subject.

Q. How many species of Mercury are there known to the Philosophers?  
A. The Mercury of the Philosophers may be regarded under four aspects;
the first is entitled the Mercury of bodies, which is actually their
concealed seed; the second is the Mercury of Nature, which is the Bath
or Vase of the Philosophers, otherwise the humid radical; to the third
has been applied the designation, Mercury of the Philosophers, because
it is found in their laboratory and in their minera. It is the sphere of
Saturn; it is the Diana of the Wise; it is the true salt of metals,
after the acquisition of which the true philosophic work may be truly
said to have begun. In its fourth aspect, it is called Common Mercury,
which yet is not that of the Vulgar, but rather is properly the true air
of the Philosophers, the true middle substance of water, the true secret
and concealed fire, called also common fire, because it is common to all
minerae, for it is the substance of metals, and thence do they derive
their quantity and quality.

Q. How many operations art comprised in our work?  
A. There is one only, which may be resolved into sublimation, and
sublimation, according to Geber, is nothing other than the elevation of
the dry matter by the mediation of fire, with adherence to its own vase.

Q. What precaution should be taken in reading the Hermetic Philosophers
?  
A. Great care, above all, must be observed upon this point, lest what
they say upon the subject should be interpreted literally and in
accordance with the mere sound of the words: For the letter killeth, but
the spirit giveth life.

Q. What books should be read in order to have an acquaintance with our
science?  
A. Among the ancients, all the works of Hermes should especially be
studied; in the next place, a certain book, entitled The Passage of the
Red Sea, and another, The Entrance into the Promised Land. Paracelsus
also should be read before all among elder writers, and, among other
treatises, his Chemical Pathway, or the Manual of Paracelsus, which
contains all the mysteries of demonstrative physics and the most arcane
Kabbalah. This rare and unique manuscript work exists only in the
Vatican Library, but Sendivogius had the good fortune to take a copy of
it, which has helped in the illumination of the sages of our order.
Secondly, Raymond Lully must be read, and his Vade Mecum above all, his
dialogue called the Tree of Life, his testament, and his codicil. There
must, however, be a certain precaution exercised in respect to the two
last, because, like those of Geber, and also of Arnold de Villanova,
they abound in false recipes and futile fictions, which seem to have
been inserted with the object of more effectually disguising the truth
from the ignorant. In the third place, the Turba Philosophorum which is
a collection of ancient authors, contains much that is materially good,
though there is much also which is valueless. Among mediaeval writers
Zachary, Trevisan, Roger Bacon, and a certain anonymous author, whose
book is entitled The Philosophers, should be held especially high in the
estimation of the student. Among moderns the most worthy to be prized
are John Fabricius, Francois de Nation, and Jean D'Espagnet, who wrote
Physics Restored, though, to say the truth, he has imported some false
precepts and fallacious opinions into his treatise.

Q. When may the Philosopher venture to undertake the work?  
A. When he is, theoretically, able to extract, by means of a crude
spirit, a digested spirit out of a body in dissolution, which digested
spirit he must again rejoin to the vital oil.

Q. Explain me this theory in a clearer manner.  
A. It may be demonstrated more completely in the actual process; the
great experiment may be undertaken when the Philosopher, by the medium
of a vegetable menstruurn, united to a mineral menstruum, is qualified
to dissolve a third essential menstruum, with which menstruums united he
must wash the earth, and then exalt it into a celestial quintessence, to
compose the sulphureous thunderbolt, which instantaneously penetrates
substances and destroys their excrements.

Q. Have those persons a proper acquaintance with Nature who pretend to
make use of vulgar gold for seed, and of vulgar mercury for the
dissolvent, or the earth in which it should be sown?  
A. Assuredly not, because neither the one nor the other possesses the
external agent--gold, because it has been deprived of it by decoction,
and mercury because it has never had it.

Q. In seeking this auriferous seed elsewhere than in gold itself, is
there no danger of producing a species of monster, since one appears to
be departing from Nature?  
A. It is undoubtedly true that in gold is contained the auriferous seed,
and that in a more perfect condition than it is found in any other body;
but this does not force us to make use of vulgar gold, for such a seed
is equally found in each of the other metals, and is nothing else but
that fixed grain which Nature has infused in the first congelation of
mercury, all metals having one origin and a common substance, as will be
ultimately unveiled to those who become worthy of receiving it by
application and assiduous study.

Q. What follows from this doctrine?  
A. It follows that, although the seed is more perfect in gold, it may be
extracted much more easily from another body than from gold itself,
other bodies being more open, that is to say, less digested, and less
restricted in their humidity.

Q. Give me an example taken from Nature.  
A. Vulgar gold may be likened to a fruit which, having come to a perfect
maturity, has been cut off from its tree, and though it contains a most
perfect and well-digested seed, notwithstanding, should anyone set it in
the ground, with a view to its multiplication, much time, trouble, and
attention will be consumed in the development of its vegetative
capabilities. On the other hand, if a cutting, or a root, be taken from
the same tree, and similarly planted, in a short time, and with no
trouble, it will spring up and produce much fruit.

Q. Is it necessary that an amateur of this science should understand the
formation of metals in the bowels of the earth if he wishes to complete
his work ?  
A. So indispensable is such a knowledge that should anyone fail, before
all other studies, to apply himself to its attainment, and to imitate
Nature point by point therein, he will never succeed in accomplishing
anything but what is worthless.

Q. How, then, does Nature deposit metals in the bowels of the earth, and
of what does she compose them ?  
A. Nature manufactures them all out of sulphur and mercury, and forms
them by their double vapour.

Q. What do you mean by this double vapour, and how can metals be formed
thereby?  
A. In order to a complete understanding of this question, it must first
be stated that mercurial vapour is united to sulphureous vapour in a
cavernous place which contains a saline water, which serves as their
matrix. Thus is formed, firstly, the Vitriol of Nature; secondly, by the
commotion of the elements, there is developed out of this Vitriol of
Nature a new vapour, which is neither mercurial nor sulphureous, yet is
allied to both these natures, and this, passing through places to which
the grease of sulphur adheres, is joined therewith, and out of their
union a glutinous substance is produced, otherwise, a formless mass,
which is permeated by the vapour that fills these cavernous places. By
this vapour, acting through the sulphur it contains, are produced the
perfect metals, provided that the vapour and the locality are pure. If
the locality and the vapour are impure, imperfect metals result. The
terms perfection and imperfection have reference to various degrees of
concoction.

Q. What is contained in this vapour?  
A. A spirit of light and a spirit of fire, of the nature of the
celestial bodies, which properly should be considered as the form of the
universe.

Q. What does this vapour represent?  
A. This vapour, thus impregnated by the universal spirit, represents, in
a fairly complete way, the original Chaos, which contained all that was
required for the original creation, that is, universal matter and
universal form.

Q. And one cannot, notwithstanding, make use of vulgar mercury in the
process?  
A. No, because vulgar mercury, as already made plain, is devoid of
external agent.

Q. Whence comes it that common mercury is without its external agent?  
A. Because in the exaltation of the double vapour, the commotion has
been so great and searching, that the spirit, or agent, has evaporated,
as occurs, with very close similarity, in the fusion of metals. The
result is that the unique mercurial part is deprived of its masculine or
sulphureous agent, and consequently can never be transmuted into gold by
Nature.

Q. How many species of gold are distinguished by the Philosophers?  
A. Three sorts :--Astral Gold, Elementary Gold, and Vulgar Gold.

Q. What is astral gold?  
A. Astral Gold has its centre in the sun, which communicates it by its
rays to all inferior beings. It is an igneous substance, which receives
a continual emanation of solar corpuscles that penetrate all things
sentient, vegetable, and mineral.

Q. What do you refer to under the term Elementary Gold ?  
A. This is the most pure and fixed portion of the elements, and of all
that is composed of them. All sublunary beings included in the three
kingdoms contain in their inmost centre a precious grain of this
elementary gold.

Q. Give me some description of Vulgar Gold ?  
A. It is the most beautiful metal of our acquaintance, the best that
Nature can produce, as perfect as it is unalterable in itself.

Q. Of what species of gold is the Stone of the Philosophers ?  
A. It is of the second species, as being the most pure portion of all
the metallic elements after its purification, when it is termed living
philosophical gold. A perfect equilibrium and equality of the four
elements enter into the Physical Stone, and four things are
indispensable for the accomplishment of the work, namely, composition,
allocation, mixture, and union, which, once performed according to the
rules of art, will beget the lawful Son of the Sun, and the Phoenix
which eternally rises out of its own ashes.

Q. What is actually the living gold of the Philosophers?  
A. It is exclusively the fire of Mercury, or that igneous virtue,
contained in the radical moisture, to which it has already communicated
the fixity and the nature of the sulphur, whence it has emanated, the
mercurial character of the whole substance of philosophical sulphur
permitting it to be alternatively termed mercury.

Q. What other name is also given by the Philosophers to their living
gold ?  
A. They also term it their living sulphur, and their true fire; they
recognize its existence in all bodies, and there is nothing that can
subsist without it.

Q. Where must we look for our living gold, our living sulphur, and our
true fire ?  
A. In the house of Mercury.

Q. By what is this fire nourished?  
A. By the air.

Q. Give me a comparative illustration of the power of this fire ?  
A. To exemplify the attraction of this interior fire, there is no better
comparison than that which is derived from the thunderbolt, which
originally is simply a dry, terrestrial exhalation, united to a humid
vapour. By exaltation, and by assuming the igneous nature, it acts on
the humidity which is inherent to it; this it attracts to itself,
transmutes it into its own nature, and then rapidly precipitates itself
to the earth, where it is attracted by a fixed nature which is like unto
its own.

Q. What should be done by the Philosopher after he has extracted his
Mercury ?  
A. He should develop it from potentiality into activity.

Q. Cannot Nature perform this of herself?  
A. No; because she stops short after the first sublimation, and out of
the matter which is thus disposed do the metals engender.

Q. What do the Philosophers understand by their gold and silver?  
A. The Philosophers apply to their Sulphur the name of Gold, and to
their Mercury the name of Silver.

Q. Whence are they derived?  
A. I have already stated that they are derived from a homogeneous body
wherein they are found in great abundance, whence also Philosophers know
how to extract both by an admirable, and entirely philosophical,
process.

Q. When this operation has been duly performed, to what other point of
the practice must they next apply themselves?  
A. To the confection of the philosophical amalgam, which must be done
with great care, but can only be accomplished after the preparation and
sublimation of the Mercury.

Q. When should your matter be combined with the living gold?  
A. During the period of amalgamation only, that is to say, Sulphur is
introduced into it by means of the amalgamation, and thenceforth there
is one substance; the process is shortened by the addition of Sulphur,
while the tincture at the same time is augmented.

Q. What is contained in the centre of the radical moisture ?  
A. It contains and conceals Sulphur, which is covered with a hard rind.

Q. What must be done to apply it to the Great Work?  
A. It must be drawn, out of its bonds with consummate skill, and by the
method of putrefaction.

Q. Does Nature, in her work in the mines, possess a menstruum which is
adapted to the dissolution and liberation of this sulphur?  
A. No; because there is no local movement. Could Nature, unassisted,
dissolve, putrefy, and purify the metallic body, she would herself
provide us with !he Physical Stone, which is Sulphur exalted and
increased in virtue.

Q. Can you elucidate this doctrine by an example?  
A. By an enlargement of the previous comparison of a fruit, or a seed,
which, in the first place, is put into the earth for its solution, and
afterwards for its multiplication. Now, the Philosopher, who is in a
position to discern what is good seed, extracts it from its centre,
consigns it to its proper earth, when it has been well cured and
prepared, and therein he rarefies it in such a manner that its prolific
virtue is increased and indefinitely multiplied.

Q. In what does the whole secret of the seed consist ?  
A. In the true knowledge of its proper earth.

Q. What do you understand by the seed in the work Of the Philosophers
?  
A. I understand the interior heat, or the specific spirit, which is
enclosed in the humid radical, which, in other words, is the middle
substance of living silver, the proper sperm of metals, which contains
its own seed.

Q. How do you set free the sulphur from its bonds?  
A. By putrefaction.

Q. What is the earth of minerals ?  
A. It is their proper menstruum.

Q. What pains must be taken by the Philosopher to extract that part
which he requires?  
A. He must take great pains to eliminate the fetid vapours and impure
sulphurs, after which the seed must be injected.

Q. By what indication may the Artist be assured that he is in the right
road at the beginning of his work?  
A. When he finds that the dissolvent and the thing dissolved are
converted into one form and one matter at the period of dissolution.

Q. How many solutions do you count in the Philosophic Work?  
A. There are three. The first solution is that which reduces the crude
and metallic body into its elements of sulphur and of living silver; the
second is that of the physical body, and the third is the solution of
the mineral earth.

Q. How is the metallic body reduced by the first solution into mercury,
and then into sulphur?  
A. By the secret artificial fire, which is the Burning Star.

Q. How is this operation performed?  
A. By extracting from the subject, in the first place, the mercury or
vapour of the elements, and, after purification, by using it to liberate
the sulphur from its bonds, by corruption, of which blackness is the
indication.

Q. How is the second solution performed ?  
A. When the physical body is resolved into the two substances previously
mentioned, and has acquired the celestial nature.

Q. What is the name which is applied by Philosophers to the Matter
during this period?  
A, It is called their Physical Chaos, and it is, in fact, the true First
Matter, a name which can hardly be applied before the conjunction of the
male--which is sulphur--with the female--which is silver.

Q. To what does the third solution refer?  
A. It is the humectation of the mineral earth and it is closely bound up
with multiplication.

Q. What fire must be made use of in our work ?  
A. That fire which is used by Nature.

Q. What is the potency of this fire?  
A. It dissolves everything that is in the world, because it is the
principle of all dissolution and corruption.

Q. Why is it also termed Mercury ?  
A. Because it is in its nature aerial, and a most subtle vapour, which
partakes at the same time of sulphur, whence it has contracted some
contamination.

Q. Where is this fire concealed ?  
A. It is concealed in the subject of art.

Q. Who is it that is familiar with, and can produce, this fire?  
A. It is known to the wise, who can both produce it and purify it.

Q. What is the essential potency and characteristic of this fire ?  
A. It is excessively dry, and is continually in motion; it seeks only to
disintegrate and to educe things from potentiality into actuality; it is
that, in a word, which coming upon solid places in mines, circulates in
a vaporous form upon the matter, and dissolves it.

Q. How may this fire be most easily distinguished?  
A. By the sulphureous excrements in which it is enveloped, and by the
saline environment with which it is clothed.

Q. What must be added to this fire so as to accentuate its capacity for
incineration in the feminine species?  
A. On account of its extreme dryness it requires to be moistened.

Q. How many philosophical fires do you enumerate ?  
A. There are in all three--the natural, the unnatural, and the
contra-natural.

Q. Explain to me these three species of fires.  
A. The natural fire is the masculine fire, or the chief agent; the
unnatural is the feminine, which is the dissolvent of Nature, nourishing
a white smoke, and assuming that form. This smoke is quickly dissipated,
unless much care be exercised, and it is almost incombustible, though by
philosophical sublimation it becomes corporeal and resplendent. The
contra-natural fire is that which disintegrates compounds and has the
power to unbind what has' been bound very closely by Nature.

Q. Where is our matter to be found?  
A. It is to be found everywhere, but it must specially be sought in
metallic nature, where it is more easily available than elsewhere.

Q. What kind must be preferred before all others ?  
A. The most mature, the most appropriate, and the easiest; but care,
before all things, must be taken that the metallic essence shall be
present, not only potentially but in actuality, and that there is,
moreover, a metallic splendour.

Q. Is everything contained in this subject?  
A. Yes; but Nature, at the same time, must be assisted, so that the work
may be perfected and hastened, and this by the means which are familiar
to the higher grades of experiment.

Q. Is this subject exceedingly precious ?  
A. It is vile, and originally is without native elegance; should anyone
say that it is saleable, it is the species to which they refer, but,
fundamentally, it is not saleable, because it is useful in our work
alone.

Q. What does our Matter contain?  
A. It contains Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.

Q. What operation is it most important to be able to perform?  
A. The successive extraction of the Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.

Q. How is that done ?  
A. By sole and perfect sublimation.

Q. What is in the first place extracted ?  
A. Mercury in the form of a white smoke.

Q. What follows?  
A. Igneous water, or Sulphur.

Q. What then?  
A. Dissolution with purified salt, in the first place volatilising that
which is fixed, and afterwards fixing that which is volatile into a
precious earth, which is the Vase of the Philosophers, and is wholly
perfect.

Q. When must the Philosopher begin his enterprise ?  
A. At the moment of daybreak, for his energy must never be relaxed.

Q. When may he take his rest?  
A. When the work has come to its perfection.

Q. At what hour is the end of the work ?  
A. High noon, that is to say, the moment when the Sun is in its fullest
power, and the Son of the Day-Star in its most brilliant splendour.

Q. What is the pass-word of Magnesia?  
A. You know whether I can or should answer:--I reserve my speech.

Q. Give me the greeting of the Philosophers.  
A. Begin ; I will reply to you.

Q. Are you an apprentice Philosopher?  
A. My friends, and the wise, know me.

Q. What is the age of a Philosopher ?  
A. From the moment of his researches to that of his discoveries, the
Philosopher does not age.
