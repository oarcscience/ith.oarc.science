# An Alchemical Mass

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Introitus. Our Lord, fount of goodness, inspirer of the sacred art, from
whom all good things come to your faithful, have mercy.

Christe. Christ, Holy one, blessed stone of the art of the science who
for the salvation of the world hast inspired the light of the science,
for the extirpation of the unbelievers, have mercy.

Kyrie. Our Lord, divine fire, help our hearts, that we may be able, to
your praise, to expand the sacraments of the art, have mercy.

Graduale. He descends like rain upon the fleece, and as showers falling
gently upon the earth. Allelujah. O blessed creator of the earth, whiter
than snow, sweeter than sweetness, fragrant at the bottom of the vessel
like balsam. O salutary medicine for men, that cureth every weakness of
the body: O sublime fount whence gushes forth truly the true water of
life into the garden of thy faithful.

Ave Maria. Hail beautiful lamp of heaven, shining light of the world!
Here art thou united with the moon, here is made the band of Mars and
the conjunction of Mercury. From these three is born through through the
magistery of the art, in the river bed, the strong giant whom a thousand
times a thousand seek, when these three shall have dissolved, not into
rain water... but into mercurial water, into this our blessed gum which
dissolves of itself and is named the Sperm of the Philosophers. Now he
makes haste to bind and betroth himself to the virgin bride, and to get
her with child in the bath over a moderate fire. But the Virgin will not
become pregnant at once unless she be kissed in repeated embraces. Then
she conceives in her body, and thus is begotten the child of good omen,
in accordance with the order of nature. Then will appear in the bottom
of the vessel the mighty Ethiopian, burned, calcined, discoloured,
altogether dead and lifeless. He asks to be buried, to be sprinkled with
his own moisture and slowly calcined till he shall arise in glowing form
from the fierce fire... Behold a wondrous restoration and renewal of the
Ethiopian! Because of the bath of rebirth he takes a new name, which the
philosophers call the natural sulphur and their son, this being the
stone of the philosophers. And behold it is one thing, one root, one
essence with nothing extraneous added and from which much that was
superfluous is taken away by the magistery of the art... It is the
treasure of treasures, the supreme philosophical potion, the divine
secret of the ancients. Blessed is he that finds such thing. One that
has seen this thing writes and speaks openly, and I know that his
testimony is true. Praise be to God for evermore.
