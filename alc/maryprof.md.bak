# Mary the Prophetess

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  

### The practise of Mary the Prophetess in the Alchymicall Art.

Aros the Philosopher had a meeting with Mary the Prophetess the Sister
of Moyses, and approaching to her, he paid her respect and said unto
her. O Prophetess, I have truly heard many say of you that you whiten
the Stone in one day.  
And Mary said, Yea, Aros, even in a part of one day.  
Aros said: O Lady Mary, when will the Work be which you affirm? How
shall we whiten and afterwards add blackness?  
Mary said; O Aros, oftentimes Nations have dyd about this part. Know you
not, O Aros; that there is a water or a thing which whitens Hendragem?  
Then Aros answering said to her. O Lady it is so as you say, but in a
long time.  
Mary answered, Hermes in all his Books has said that the Philosophers
whiten the Stone in one hour of the day.  
Aros said to her, Oh how excellent is that?  
Mary said, it is most excellent to him that is ignorant of it.  
Aros said, if men have all the four Elements, he \[Hermes\] said that
their fumes might be compleated, and complexioned, and coagulated, and
retained in one day, untill they doe fullfill the consequence (i.e.
attain the end).  
Mary said, O Aros, by God, if thy senses or understanding were not
solid, you should not hear these words from me, untill the Lord should
fill my Heart with the grace of his divine Will. Nevertheless take the
Allum of Spain, the white gumm and the red gumm, which is the Kibric of
the Philosophers, and their Sol and the greater Tincture, and marry Gumm
with Gumm togeather with a true Matrimony. Mary said, make them like a
running Water, and vitrify this water which has been laboured or wrought
upon for one day, out of the two Lubechs, upon the fixed body, and
liquefy them by the secret of Nature in the Vessel of Philosophy. Did
you understand us?  
Yes Lady.  
Mary said, Keep the fume and take care that none of it fly away. And let
your measure be with a gentle fire such as is the Measure of the heat of
the Sun in the Month of June or July, and stay by your Vessel and behold
it with care how it grows black, grows red, and grows white in less than
three hours of the day, and the fume will penetrate the body, and the
Spirit will be bound up, and they will be like milk, incerating, and
liquefying and penetrating: and that is the secret.  
Aros said I do not say that this will be allways.  
Mary said unto him: Aros, and this is more wonderfull concerning this,
that it was not among the Ancients, nor did it come to him by curing, or
by the Medicinall Art and that is take the white, clear and honoured
Herb growing on the Hillocks, and pound it fresh as it is in its Hour,
and that is the true Body not flying from the Fire.  
And Aros said it is the Stone of Truth?  
And Mary said yes. But yet men know not this regimen (rule or way of
working) with the speediness thereof.  
Aros said, and what afterwards.  
Mary said, vitrify upon it Kibric or Zibeic and there are the two fumes
comprehending the two Lights, and project upon that the complement of
the Tinctures of the Spirits, and the weights of Truth, and pound it
all, and put it to the Fire, and you shall see wonderfull things from
them. The whole goverment consists in the temper of the Fire, O how
strange it is, how it will be moved from one colour to another, in less
than an hour of the Day, untill it arrive at the mark of redness and
whiteness, and cast away the Fire and permit it to cool, and open it and
you will find the clear pearly Body to be of the Colour of the Poppy of
the Wood mixt with whiteness and that is it which is incerating,
liquefying and penetrating, and one golden piece thereof, the weight of
a small golden Coin, falleth upon a thousand thousand and two hundred
thousand. That is the hidden secret.  
Then Aros fell down upon his face.  
And Mary said to him, Lift up your head Aros: because I will shorten for
you the thing, as that clear body which is thrown upon the Hillocks, and
is not obtained by putrefaction or motion. Take and pound it with Gumm
Elsaron, and with the two fumes because the Body comprehending or
retaining them is Gumm Elsaron and grind it all. Therefore approach
because it all melts. If you project its wife upon it, it will be as a
distilling Water, and when the Aire shall strike it, it will be
congealed and be one body, and make projection of it, and you will
behold Wonders: O Aros that is the hidden secret of Scholia; and know
that the said two fumes are the Root of this Art, and they are the white
Kibric and the humid calx, but the fixed Body is of the Heart of Saturn
comprehending the Tincture, and the Fields of Wisdom or of Scholia. And
the Philosophers have named it by many and all names, and received or
gathered from the Hillocks it is a clear white Body, and these are the
medicine of this Art, part is procured and part is found upon the
Hillocks; and know Aros that the wise men have not called it the Fields
of Wisdom, or of Scholia, unless because Scholia will not be compleated
but by it; and in the Scholia there are nothing but wonderfull things.
For there also enters into them the four Stones, and its true regimen is
as I have said. And that is first Scoyare, Ade, and Zethet; by that make
your Allegory as Hermes has done in his Books Scoyas, and the
Philosophers have allways made the regimen longer, and have resembled
the work to every thing which ought not to make the work, and they make
the Magistery to be in one year, and this but onely for hiding it from
the ignorant people, untill it be confirmed in their Hearts and their
senses (till they believe the Art),: because the Art will not be
compleated except only in Gold; because it is the great secret of God:
and they who hear of our secrets doe not verify them (nor believe them
to be true), by reason of their ignorance. Did you understand Aros?  
Aros said yes. But tell me about that vessel, without which the Work
will not be accomplisht.  
Mary said that the Vessel of Hermes which the Stoicks have concealed,
and it is not a Necromanticall Vessel, but it is the Measure of your
Fire.  
Aros said: O Lady you have obeyed (been a scholar) in the Society of
Scoyari: O Prophetess, have you found among the Secrets of the
Philosophers, which they have set down in their Books, that any one can
make the Art out of one Body?  
And Mary said: Yes: which Hermes has not taught, because the Root of
Scholia is a body which cannot be made smooth or plain and incurable
(unconquerable) and it is a poyson mortifying all bodies, and it
pulverises them and coagulates Mercury with its odour. And shee said, I
swear to you by the eternall God, that that poison when it is dissolved
untill it is made a subtile Water, I care not by what dissolution it is
done, does coagulate Mercury into Luna with the strength of Truth, and
it falls into the Throne of Jupiter, and forms him into Luna. And the
Science is in all Bodys, but the Stoicks, by reason of the shortness of
their lives, and the Length of the Work, have concealed this; and they
found out these tinging Elements, and they increased them, and all the
Philosophers teach them, except the Vessel of Hermes, because it is
divine, and of the Wisdom of the Lord hidden from Nations: and they who
are ignorant of it, know not the Regimen of Truth, because of their
Ignorance of the Vessel of Hermes.  
  
Mary briefly soundeth forth  
Strange things like Thunder round the Earth.  
She with two Gumms makes the Bottome stay  
What else would fly away.  
Three things if you three hours attend  
Are chained together in the End.  
Mary the Light of dew, and Art has got  
In three hours to tye the Knot.  
Pluto's daughter, it is she  
Who bindeth Loves confederacy  
Joyned with three seeds she does aspire  
To be exalted in the Fire.
