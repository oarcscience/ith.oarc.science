### The Emerald Tablet of Hermes

  
  

#### History of the Tablet

History of the Tablet (largely summarised from Needham 1980, & Holmyard
1957)  

The Tablet probably first appeared in the West in editions of the
psuedo-Aristotlean Secretum Secretorum which was actually a translation
of the Kitab Sirr al-Asar, a book of advice to kings which was
translated into latin by Johannes Hispalensis c. 1140 and by Philip of
Tripoli c.1243. Other translations of the Tablet may have been made
during the same period by Plato of Tivoli and Hugh of Santalla, perhaps
from different sources.  
The date of the Kitab Sirr al-Asar is uncertain, though c.800 has been
suggested and it is not clear when the tablet became part of this
work.  
Holmyard was the first to find another early arabic version (Ruska found
a 12th centruy recension claiming to have been dictated by Sergius of
Nablus) in the Kitab Ustuqus al-Uss al-Thani (Second Book of the
Elements of Foundation) attributed to Jabir. Shortly after Ruska found
another version appended to the Kitab Sirr al-Khaliqa wa San\`at
al-Tabi\`a (Book of the Secret of Creation and the Art of Nature), which
is also known as the Kitab Balaniyus al-Hakim fi'l-\`Ilal (book of
Balinas the wise on the Causes). It has been proposed that this book was
written may have been written as early as 650, and was definitely
finished by the Caliphate of al-Ma'mun (813-33).  
Scholars have seen similarities between this book and the Syriac Book of
Treasures written by Job of Odessa (9th century) and more interestingly
the Greek writings of the bishop Nemesius of Emesa in Syria from the mid
fourth century. However though this suggests a possible Syriac source,
non of these writings contain the tablet.  
Balinas is usually identified with Apollonius of Tyna, but there is
little evidence to connect him with the Kitab Balabiyus, and even if
there was,the story implies that Balinas found the tablet rather than
wrote it, and the recent discoveries of the dead sea scrolls and the nag
hamamdi texts suggest that hiding texts in caves is not impossible, even
if we did not have the pyramids before us.  
Ruska has suggested an origin further east, and Needham has proposed an
origin in China.  
Holmyard, Davis and Anon all consider that this Tablet may be one of the
earliest of all alchemical works we have that survives.  
It should be remarked that apparantly the Greeks and Egyptians used the
termtranslated as \`emerald' for emeralds, green granites, "and perhaps
green jasper". In medieval times the emerald table of the Gothic kings
of Spain, and the Sacro catino- a dish said to have belonged to the
Queen of Sheba, to have been used at the last supper, and to be made of
emerald, were made of green glass \[Steele and Singer: 488\].  

  
  

### Translations

  
From Jabir ibn Hayyan.  

  
0) Balinas mentions the engraving on the table in the hand of Hermes,
which says:  
1) Truth! Certainty! That in which there is no doubt!  
2) That which is above is from that which is below, and that which is
below is from that which is above, working the miracles of one.  
3) As all things were from one.  
4) Its father is the Sun and its mother the Moon.  
5) The Earth carried it in her belly, and the Wind nourished it in her
belly,  
7) as Earth which shall become Fire.  
7a) Feed the Earth from that which is subtle, with the greatest power.  
8) It ascends from the earth to the heaven and becomes ruler over that
which is above and that which is below.  
14) And I have already explained the meaning of the whole of this in two
of these books of mine.  
\[Holmyard 1923: 562.\]  
  

  
Another Arabic Version (from the German of Ruska, translated by
‘Anonymous').  

  
  
0) Here is that which the priest Sagijus of Nabulus has dictated
concerning the entrance of Balinas into the hidden chamber... After my
entrance into the chamber, where the talisman was set up, I came up to
an old man sitting on a golden throne, who was holding an emerald table
in one hand. And behold the following - in Syriac, the primordial
language- was written thereon:  
1) Here (is) a true explanation, concerning which there can be no
doubt.  
2) It attests: The above from the below, and the below from the above
-the work of the miracle of the One.  
3) And things have been from this primal substance through a single act.
How wonderful is this work! It is the main (principle) of the world and
is its maintainer.  
4) Its father is the sun and its mother the moon; the  
5) wind has borne it in its body, and the earth has nourished it.  
6) the father of talismen and the protector of miracles  
6a) whose powers are perfect, and whose lights are confirmed (?),  
7) a fire that becomes earth.  
7a) Separate the earth from the fire, so you will attain the subtle as
more inherent than the gross, with care and sagacity.  
8) It rises from earth to heaven, so as to draw the lights of the
heights to itself, and descends to the earth; thus within it are the
forces of the above and the below;  
9) because the light of lights within it, thus does the darkness flee
before it.  
10) The force of forces, which overcomes every subtle thing and
penetrates into everything gross.  
11) The structure of the microcosm is in accordance with the structure
of the macrocosm.  
12) And accordingly proceed the knowledgeable.  
13) And to this aspired Hermes, who was threefold graced with wisdom.  
14) And this is his last book, which he concealed in the chamber.  
\[Anon 1985: 24-5\]  
  

  
Twelfth Century Latin  

  
  
0) When I entered into the cave, I received the tablet zaradi, which was
inscribed, from between the hands of Hermes, in which I discovered these
words:  
1) True, without falsehood, certain, most certain.  
2) What is above is like what is below, and what is below is like that
which is above. To make the miracle of the one thing.  
3) And as all things were made from contemplation of one, so all things
were born from one adaptation.  
4) Its father is the Sun, its mother is the Moon.  
5) The wind carried it in its womb, the earth breast fed it.  
6) It is the father of all ‘works of wonder' (Telesmi) in the world.  
6a) Its power is complete (integra).  
7) If cast to (turned towards- versa fuerit) earth,  
7a) it will separate earth from fire, the subtile from the gross.  
8) With great capacity it ascends from earth to heaven. Again it
descends to earth, and takes back the power of the above and the
below.  
9) Thus you will receive the glory of the distinctiveness of the world.
All obscurity will flee from you.  
10) This is the whole most strong strength of all strength, for it
overcomes all subtle things, and penetrates all solid things.  
11a) Thus was the world created.  
12) From this comes marvelous adaptions of which this is the
proceedure.  
13) Therefore I am called Hermes, because I have three parts of the
wisdom of the whole world.  
14) And complete is what I had to say about the work of the Sun, from
the book of Galieni Alfachimi.  
\[From Latin in Steele and Singer 1928: 492.\]  
  

  
Translation from Aurelium Occultae Philosophorum..Georgio Beato  

  
  
1) This is true and remote from all cover of falsehood  
2) Whatever is below is similar to that which is above. Through this the
marvels of the work of one thing are procured and perfected.  
3) Also, as all things are made from one, by the condsideration of one,
so all things were made from this one, by conjunction.  
4) The father of it is the sun, the mother the moon.  
5) The wind bore it in the womb. Its nurse is the earth, the mother of
all perfection.  
6a)Its power is perfected.  
7) If it is turned into earth,  
7a) separate the earth from the fire, the subtle and thin from the crude
and course, prudently, with modesty and wisdom.  
8) This ascends from the earth into the sky and again descends from the
sky to the earth, and receives the power and efficacy of things above
and of things below.  
9) By this means you will acquire the glory of the whole world, and so
you will drive away all shadows and blindness.  
10) For this by its fortitude snatches the palm from all other fortitude
and power. For it is able to penetrate and subdue everything subtle and
everything crude and hard.  
11a) By this means the world was founded  
12) and hence the marvelous cojunctions of it and admirable effects,
since this is the way by which these marvels may be brought about.  
13) And because of this they have called me Hermes Tristmegistus since I
have the three parts of the wisdom and Philsosphy of the whole
universe.  
14) My speech is finished which i have spoken concerning the solar
work  
\[Davis 1926: 874.\]  
  
  

  
Translation of Issac Newton c. 1680.  

  
  
1) Tis true without lying, certain & most true.  
2) That wch is below is like that wch is above & that wch is above is
like yt wch is below to do ye miracles of one only thing.  
3) And as all things have been & arose from one by ye mediation of one:
so all things have their birth from this one thing by adaptation.  
4) The Sun is its father, the moon its mother,  
5) the wind hath carried it in its belly, the earth its nourse.  
6) The father of all perfection in ye whole world is here.  
7) Its force or power is entire if it be converted into earth.  
7a) Seperate thou ye earth from ye fire, ye subtile from the gross
sweetly wth great indoustry.  
8) It ascends from ye earth to ye heaven & again it desends to ye earth
and receives ye force of things superior & inferior.  
9) By this means you shall have ye glory of ye whole world & thereby all
obscurity shall fly from you.  
10) Its force is above all force. ffor it vanquishes every subtile thing
& penetrates every solid thing.  
11a) So was ye world created.  
12) From this are & do come admirable adaptaions whereof ye means (Or
process) is here in this.  
13) Hence I am called Hermes Trismegist, having the three parts of ye
philosophy of ye whole world.  
14) That wch I have said of ye operation of ye Sun is accomplished &
ended.  
\[Dobbs 1988: 183-4.\]  
  

  
Translation from Kriegsmann (?) alledgedly from the Phoenician  

  
  
1) I speak truly, not falsely, certainly and most truly  
2) These things below with those above and those with these join forces
again so that they produce a single thing the most wonderful of all.  
3)And as the whole universe was brought forth from one by the word of
one GOD, so also all things are regenerated perpetually from this one
according to the disposition of Nature.  
4) It has the Sun for father and the Moon for mother:  
5) it is carried by the air as if in a womb, it is nursed by the
earth.  
6) It is the cause, this, of all perfection of all things throughout the
universe.  
6a) This will attain the highest perfection of powers  
7) if it shall be reduced into earth  
7a) Distribute here the earth and there the fire, thin out the density
of this the suavest (suavissima) thing of all.  
8)Ascend with the greatest sagacity of genius from the earth into the
sky, and thence descend again to the earth, and recognise that the
forces of things above and of things below are one,  
9) so as to posses the glory of the whole world- and beyond this man of
abject fate may have nothing further.  
10)This thing itself presently comes forth stronger by reasons of this
fortitude: it subdues all bodies surely, whether tenuous or solid, by
penetrating them.  
11a) And so everything whatsoever that the world contains was created.  
12) Hence admirable works are accomplished which are instituted (carried
out- instituuntur) according to the same mode.  
13) To me therefor the name of Hermes Trismegistus has been awarded
because I am discovered as the Teacher of the three parts of the wisdom
of the world.  
14) These then are the considerations which I have concluded ought to be
written down concerning the readiest operations of the Chymic art.  
\[Davis 1926: 875 slightly modified.\]  
  
  

  
From Sigismund Bacstrom (allegedly translated from Chaldean).  

  
  
0) The Secret Works of CHIRAM ONE in essence, but three in aspect.  
1) It is true, no lie, certain and to be depended upon,  
2) the superior agrees with the inferior, and the inferior agrees with
the superior, to effect that one truly wonderful work.  
3) As all things owe their existence to the will of the only one, so all
things owe their origin to the one only thing, the most hidden by the
arrangement of the only God.  
4) The father of that one only thing is the sun its mother is the
moon,  
5) the wind carries it in its belly; but its nourse is a spirituous
earth.  
6) That one only thing is the father of all things in the Universe.  
6a) Its power is perfect,  
7) after it has been united with a spirituous earth.  
7a) Separate that spirituous earth from the dense or crude by means of a
gentle heat, with much attention.  
8) In great measure it ascends from the earth up to heaven, and descends
again, newborn, on the earth, and the superior and the inferior are
increased in power.  
9) By this wilt thou partake of the honours of the whole world. And
Darkness will fly from thee.  
10) This is the strength of all powers. With this thou wilt be able to
overcome all things and transmute all what is fine and what is coarse.  
11a) In this manner the world was created;  
12) the arrangements to follow this road are hidden.  
13) For this reason I am called Chiram Telat Mechasot, one in essence,
but three in aspect. In this trinity is hidden the wisdom of the whole
world.  
14) It is ended now, what I have said concerning the effects of the sun.
Finish of the Tabula Smaragdina.  
\[See Hall 1977: CLVIII,\]  
  

  
From Madame Blavatsky  

  
  
2) What is below is like that which is above, and what is above is
similar to that which is below to accomplish the wonders of the one
thing.  
3) As all things were produced by the mediation of one being, so all
things were produced from this one by adaption.  
4) Its father is the sun, its mother the moon.  
6a) It is the cause of all perfection throughout the whole earth.  
7) Its power is perfect if it is changed into earth.  
7a) Separate the earth from the fire, the subtile from the gross, acting
prudently and with judgement.  
8 ) Ascend with the greatest sagacity from earth to heaven, and unite
together the power of things inferior and superior;  
9) thus you will possess the light of the whole world, and all obscurity
will fly away from you.  
10) This thing has more fortitude than fortitude itself, because it will
overcome every subtile thing and penetrate every solid thing.  
11a) By it the world was formed.  
\[Blavatsky 1972: 507.\]  
  

  
From Fulcanelli (translated from the French by Sieveking)  

  
  
1) This is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth:-  
2) As below, so above; and as above so below. With this knowledge alone
you may work miracles.  
3) And since all things exist in and eminate from the ONE Who is the
ultimate Cause, so all things are born after their kind from this ONE.  
4) The Sun is the father, the Moon the mother;  
5) the wind carried it in his belly. Earth is its nurse and its
guardian.  
6) It is the Father of all things,  
6a) the eternal Will is contained in it.  
7) Here, on earth, its strength, its power remain one and undivded.  
7a) Earth must be separated from fire, the subtle from the dense, gently
with unremitting care.  
8) It arises from the earth and descends from heaven; it gathers to
itself the strength of things above and things below.  
9) By means of this one thing all the glory of the world shall be yours
and all obscurity flee from you.  
10) It is power, strong with the strength of all power, for it will
penetrate all mysteries and dispel all ignorance.  
11a) By it the world was created.  
12) From it are born manifold wonders, the means to achieving which are
here given  
13) It is for this reason that I am called Hermes Trismegistus; for I
possess the three essentials of the philosophy of the universe.  
14) This is is the sum total of the work of the Sun.  
\[Sadoul 1972: 25-6.\]  
  

  
From Fulcanelli, new translation  

  
  
1) It is true without untruth, certain and most true:  
2) that which is below is like that which is on high, and that which is
on high is like that which is below; by these things are made the
miracles of one thing.  
3) And as all things are, and come from One, by the mediation of One, So
all things are born from this unique thing by adaption.  
4) The Sun is the father and the Moon the mother.  
5) The wind carries it in its stomach. The earth is its nourisher and
its receptacle.  
6 The Father of all the Theleme of the universal world is here.  
6a) Its force, or power, remains entire,  
7) if it is converted into earth.  
7a) You separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross,
gently with great industry.  
8) It climbs from the earth and descends from the sky, and receives the
force of things superior and things inferior.  
9) You will have by this way, the glory of the world and all obscurity
will flee from you.  
10) It is the power strong with all power, for it will defeat every
subtle thing and penetrate every solid thing  
11a) In this way the world was created.  
12) From it are born wonderful adaptations, of which the way here is
given.  
13) That is why I have been called Hermes Tristmegistus, having the
three parts of the universal philosophy.  
14) This, that I have called the solar Work, is complete.  
\[Translated from Fulcanelli 1964: 312.\]  
  

  
From Idres Shah  

  
  
1) The truth, certainty, truest, without untruth.  
2 )What is above is like what is below. What is below is like what is
above. The miracle of unity is to be attained.  
3) Everything is formed from the contemplation of unity, and all things
come about from unity, by means of adaptation.  
4) Its parents are the Sun and Moon.  
5) It was borne by the wind and nurtured by the Earth.  
6) Every wonder is from it  
6a) and its power is complete.  
7) Throw it upon earth,  
7a) and earth will separate from fire. The impalbable separated from the
palpable.  
8) Through wisdom it rises slowly from the world to heaven. Then it
descends to the world combining the power of the upper and the lower.  
9 )Thus you will have the illumination of all the world, and darkness
will disappear.  
10) This is the power of all strength- it overcomes that which is
delicate and penetrates through solids.  
11a) This was the means of the creation of the world.  
12) And in the future wonderful developements will be made, and this is
the way.  
13) I am Hermes the Threefold Sage, so named because I hold the three
elements of all wisdom.  
14) And thus ends the revelation of the work of the Sun.  
(Shah 1964: 198).  
  

  
Hypothetical Chinese Original  

  
  
1) True, true, with no room for doubt, certain, worthy of all trust.  
2) See, the highest comes from the lowest, and the lowest from the
highest; indeed a marvelous work of the tao.  
3) See how all things originated from It by a single process.  
4) The father of it (the elixir) is the sun (Yang), its mother the moon
(Yin).  
5) The wind bore it in its belly, and the earth nourished it.  
6 )This is the father of wondrous works (changes and transformations),
the guardian of mysteries,  
6a) perfect in its powers, the animator of lights.  
7) This fire will be poured upon the earth...  
7a) So separate the earth from the fire, the subtle from the gross,
acting prudently and with art.  
8) It ascends from the earth to the heavens (and orders the lights
above), then descends again to the earth; and in it is the power of the
highest and the lowest.  
9) Thus when you have the light of lights darkness will flee away from
you.  
10) With this power of powers (the elixir) you shall be able to get the
mastery of every subtle thing, and be able to penetrate everything that
is gross.  
11a) In this way was the great world itself formed.  
12) Hence thus and thus marvellous operations will be acheived.

### TEXTUAL REMARKS

  
On \#3 Some Latin texts have meditatione (contemplation), others
mediatione (mediation). Some texts have adaptatione (by adaptation),
some have adoptionis (by adoption).  
  
On \#6 ‘Telesmi' is a greek word, some texts have ‘thelesmi'.  
  
On \#6, 7 In some texts ‘Its Power is Complete' is a separate line. In
the generally accepted reading, this runs into \#7 producing ‘Its Power
is complete if versa fuerit to earth'. Where possible this has been
indicated by diving these lines in 6, 6a, 7, & 7a  
  
On \#7, 8 In some texts the ‘Wisdom, capacity' (magno ingenio) is read
as referring to \#7, and hence the operation of Separation is to be
carried out ‘carefully', in other readings the ‘wisdom' is held to refer
to \#8 and the product of the Separation which thus ascends with
‘wisdom'.  
  
Needham quotes Ruska to the effect that sections 3, 12 and 14 are
probably late additions (op. cit)  
  

### COMMENTARIES

  
**On \#1**  
Hortulanus: "... the most true Sun is procreated by art. And he says
most true in the superlative degree because the Sun generated by this
art exceeds all natural Sun in all of its properties, medicinal and
otherwise" (Davis modified by \`Linden')  
  
**On \#2**  
Albertus Magnus: Hermes says "the powers of all things below originate
in the stars and constellations of the heavens: and that all these
powers are poured down into all things below by the circle called Alaur,
which is, they said, the first circle of the constellations". This
descent is "noble when the materials receiving these powers are more
like things above in their brightness and transparency; ignoble when the
materials are confused and foul, so that the heavenly power is, as it
were oppressed. Therefore they say that this is the reason why precious
stones more than anything else have wonderful powers" (60 -61). While
the "seven kinds of metals have their forms from the seven planets of
the lower spheres" (168).  
  
Hortulanus: "the stone is divided into two principle parts by the
magistry, into a superior part which ascends above and into an inferior
part which remains below fixed and clear. And these two parts moreover
are concordant in their virtue since the inferior part is earth which is
called nurse and ferment, and the superior part is the spirit which
quickens the whole stone and raises it up. Wherfore separation made, and
conjunction celebrated, many miracles are effected."  
  
Burckhardt: "This refers to the reciprocal dependence of the active and
the passive... essential form cannot be manifested without passive
materia.. the efficacy of the spiritual power depends on the
preparedness of the human ‘container' and vice versa.... ‘Above' and
‘below' are thus related to this one thing and complement one another in
its regard".  
  
Schumaker: "There are corresponding planes in various levels of
creation, hence it is safe to draw analogies between macrocosm and
microcosm, the mineral kingdom and the human, animal and vegetable
kingdoms etc".  
  
Needham: "the whole affirmation looks remarkably like the doctrine that
extreme of Yang generates Yin, and vice versa".  
  
**On \#3**  
Hortulanus: "our stone, which was created by God, was born and came
forth from a confused mass, containing in itself all the elements- and
hence our stone was born by this single miracle".  
  
Trithemius: "Is it not true that all things flow from one thing, from
the goodness of the One, and that whatever is joined to Unity cannot be
diverse, but rather fructifies by means of the simplicity and
adaptability of the One" "What is born from Unity? Is it not the
ternary? Take note: Unity is unmixed, the binary is compounded, and the
ternary is reduced to the simplicity of Unity. I, Trithemius, am not of
three minds, but persist in a single integrated mind taking pleasure in
the ternary, which gives birth to a marvelous offspring" (Bran)  
  
Burckhardt: "the undivided, invisible Light of the unconditioned One is
refracted into multiplicity by the prism of the Spirit". As the Spirit
contemplates the Unity without full comprehension "it manifests the
‘many-sided' All, just as a lens transmits the light it receives as a
bundle of rays".  
  
Schumaker: As God is one, all created objects come from one thing, an
undifferentiated primal matter.  
  
**On \#4**  
Hortulanus: " As one animal naturally generates more animals similar to
itself, so the Sun artificially generates Sun by the power of
multiplication of...the stone.... in this artificial generation it is
necessary that the Sun have a suitable receptacle, consonant with
itself, for its sperm and its tincture, and this is the Luna of the
philosophers"  
  
Redgrove: Sun and Moon "probably stand for Spirit and Matter
respectively, not gold and silver".  
  
Burckhardt: Sun "is the spirit (nous), while the moon is the soul
(psyche)".  
  
Schumaker: "If the moon is associated with water, as because of its
‘moisture' \[as\] was usual, and the sun with fire, the prima materia is
understood to have been generated by fire, born of water, brought down
from the sky by wind, and nourished by earth".  
  
**On \#5**  
Albertus Magnus: by this Hermes "means the levigatio \[making light
weight\] of the material, raising it to the properties of Air. And why
he says the wind carries the material \[of the stone\] in its belly is
that, when the material is placed in an alembic- which is a vessel made
like those in which rosewater is prepared- then by evapouration it is
rendered subtle and is raised towards the properties of Air... And there
distills and issues from the mouth of the alembic a watery or oily
liquor with all the powers of the elements" (17). In metals the moisture
is not separated from the dryness, but is dissolved in it; and being so
dissolved, it moves about there as if it had been swallowed by the Earth
and were moving about in its bowels. And on this account Hermes said
‘The mother of metal is Earth that carries it in her belly'".  
  
Hortulanus: "It is plain that wind is air, and air is life, and life is
spirit... And thus it is necessary that the wind should bear the whole
stone.... \[However\] our stone without the ferment of the earth will
never come to the effect, which ferment is called food"  
  
Trithemius: "the wind carries its seed in her belly".  
  
Maier: By "the wind carried him in its belly" Hermes means " ‘He, whose
father is the Sun, and whose mother is the Moon, will be carried before
he is born, by wind and vapour, just as a flying bird is carried by
air'. From the vapours of winds, which are nothing else but wind in
motion, water proceeds, when condensed, and from that water, mixed with
earth, all minerals and metals arise". The substance carried by the wind
is "in chemical respect.. the sulphur, which is carried in mercury".
Lull says "‘The stone is the fire, carried in the belly of the air'. In
physical respect it is the unborn child that will soon be born". To be
clearer, "‘All mercury is composed of vapours, that is to say of water,
which the earth raises along with it into the thin air, and of earth,
which the air compels to return into watery earth or earthy water" As
the elements contained within are each reduced to a watery condition,
they either follow the volatile elements upward as in common mercury, or
they stay below with the solid elements as in philosophical Mercury "and
in the solid metals". So "Mercury is the wind which receives the
sulphur... as the unripe fruit from the mothers womb, or from the ashes
of the burnt mother's body and takes it to a place where it may ripen".
Ripley says "our child shall be born in the air, that is the belly of
the wind" \[de Jong 1969: 55- 7.\]  
  
Maier (2nd Comment) on "The earth is its nurse": Food changes into the
substance of the eater and is then assimilated. "This harmony dominates
the whole of nature, for the like enjoys the like". The same happens in
the Work and Nature "just as is the growth of the child in the mother's
womb. So also a father, a mother and a nurse have been attributed to the
philosophical child... it comes into being from the twofold seed and
then grows as an embryo does". As a woman must moderate her diet to
avoid miscarriage, "in the same way one must set about philosophical
work with moderation". The Seeds also have to be united. "Philosophers
say that the one comes from the East and the other from the West and
become one; what does this mean but combining in a retort, a moderate
temperature and nourishment?". "One may wonder why the earth is referred
to as the nurse of the philosophic child, since barreness and dryness
are the main properties of the element earth". The answer is that not
the element, but the whole Earth is meant. "It is the nurse of Heaven
not because it resolves, washes and moistens the foetus, but because it
coagulates, fastens and colours the latter and changes it into sap and
blood... The Earth contains a wonderful juice which changes the nature
of the one who feeds on it, as Romulus is believed to have been changed
by the wolf's milk into a bellicose individual" \[de Jong 1969: 63
-5.\]  
  
Burckhardt: "The wind which carries the spiritual germ in its body, is
the vital breath". Vital breath is the substance of the realm between
heaven and earth, it "is also Quicksilver which contains the germ of
gold in a liquid state". The earth is "the body, as an inward
reality".  
  
**On \#6**  
Burckhardt: the word talisman is derived from Telesma. Talismans work by
corresponding to their prototype, and by making a "‘condensation', on
the subtle plane, of a spiritual state. This explains the similarity
between the talisman, as the bearer of an invisible influence, and the
alchemical elixir, as the ‘ferment' of metallic transformation".  
  
**On \#7**  
Hortulanus: The stone is perfect and complete if it is turned into earth
"that is if the soul of the stone itself.... is turned into earth,
namely of the stone and is fixed so that the whole substance of the
stone becomes one with its nurse, namely the earth, and the whole stone
is converted to ferment"  
  
Trithemius: it is the seed from \#5 that must be cast upon the earth.  
  
Bacstrom: "Process- First Distillation".  
  
Burckhardt: "when the Spirit is ‘embodied', the volatile becomes
fixed".  
  
Schumaker: if the prime matter is to be used it must be fixed into a
substance "capable of being handled".  
  
**On \#7a**  
Hortulanus: "You will separate, that is, you will dissolve, because
solution is separation of parts.."  
  
Burkhardt: The separation "means the ‘extraction' of the soul from the
body".  
  
Schumaker "Since the volatile principle is fire -or sometimes, air-
stability is produced by its removal. Or, alternatively but less
probably, the earth is impurity (‘the gross') and a purified fire (‘the
subtle') is  
what is wanted.  
  
**On \#8**  
Albertus Magnus: In intending to teach the operations of alchemy Hermes
says the stone "‘ascends to heaven' when by roasting and calcination it
takes on the properties of Fire; for alchemists mean by calcinatio the
reduction of material to to powder by burning and roasting. And the
material ‘again descends from heaven to earth' when it takes on the
properties of Earth by inhumatio, for inhumation revives and nourishes
what was previously killed by calcination".  
  
Hortulanus: "And now he deals with multiplication \[of the stone\]."
"Although our stone is divided in the first operation into four parts...
there are really two principle parts". The ascending, non fixed, and the
earth or ferment. "It is necessary to have a large quantity of this non
fixed part and to give it to the stone which has been made thoroughly
clean from dirt.... until the entire stone is borne above by the virtue
of the spirit"  
"Afterwards it is necessary to incerate the same stone,..with the oil
that was extracted in the first operation, which oil is called the water
of the stone" Roast or boil by sublimation until the "entire stone
descends... and remains fixed and fluent". "That which is coporeal is
made spiritual by sublimation, and that which is spiritual is made
corporeal by descension".  
  
Trithemius: "When the ternary has at last returned to itself it may, by
an inner disposition and great delight, ascend from the earth to heaven,
thereby receiving both superior and inferior power; thus will it be made
powerful and glorious in the clarity of Unity, demonstrate its ability
to bring forth every number, and put to flight all obscurity".  
  
Bacstrom: "Last Digestion". "The Azoth ascends from the Earth, from the
bottom of the Glass, and redescends in Veins and drops into the Earth
and by this continual circulation the Azoth is more and more subtilised,
Volatilizes Sol and carries the volatilized Solar atoms along with it
and thereby becomes a Solar Azoth, i.e. our third and genuine Sophic
Mercury". The circulation must continue until "it ceases of itself, and
the Earth has sucked it all in, when it becomes the black pitchy matter,
the Toad \[the substances in the alchemical retort and also the lower
elements in the body of man -Hall\], which denotes complete putrifaction
or Death of the compound".  
  
Read, suggests this section describes the use of a kerotakis, in which
metals are suspended and subject to the action of gasses released from
substances heated in the base, and from their condensation and
circulation.  
  
Burckhardt: "dissolution of consciousness from all formal ‘coagulations'
is  
followed by the ‘crystalisation' of the Spirit, so that active and
passive are perfectly united."  
  
Schumaker: "Separate the volatile part of the substance by vaporization
but continue heating until the vapour reunites with the parent body,
whereupon you will have obtained the Stone".  
  
**On \#9**  
Trithemius: When the ternary has returned to Unity cleansed of all
impurities "the mind understands without contradiction all the mysteries
of the excellently arranged arcanum".  
  
Bacstrom: the black matter becomes White and Red. The Red "having been
carried to perfection, medicinaly and for Metals" is capable of
supporting complete mental and physical health, and provides "ample
means, in finitum multiplicable to be benevolent and charitable, without
any dimunation of our inexhaustable resources, therefore well may it be
called the Glory of the whole World". Contemplation and study of the
Philosopher's Stone ("L. P.") elevates the mind to God. "The
Philosophers say with great Truth, that the L.P. either finds a good man
or makes one". "By invigorating the Organs the Soul makes use of for
communicating with exterior objects, the Soul must aquire greater
powers, not only for conception but also for retention". If we pray and
have faith "all Obscurity must vanish of course".  
  
Burckhardt: "Thus the light of the Spirit becomes constant..\[and\]
ignorance, deception, uncertainty, doubt and foolishness will be removed
from consciousness".  
  
**On \#10**  
Trithemius: The Philosopher's Stone is another name for the ‘one thing',
and is able to "conquer every subtile thing and to penetrate every
solid". "This very noble virtue... consists of maximal fortitude,
touching everything with its desirable excellence".  
  
Bacstrom: "The L.P. does possess all the Powers concealed in Nature, not
for destruction but for exhaltation and regeneration of matter, in the
three Departments of Nature". "It refixes the most subtil Oxygen into
its own firey Nature". The power increases "in a tenfold ratio, at every
multiplication". So it can penetrate Gold and Silver, and fix mercury,
Crystals and Glass Fluxes.  
  
Burckhardt: "Alchemical fixation is nevertheless more inward... Through
its union with the spirit bodily consciousness itself becomes a fine and
penetrating power". He quotes Jabir "The body becomes a spirit, and
takes on... fineness, lightness, extensibility, coloration... The
spirit... becomes a body and aquires the latter's resistance to fire,
immobility and duration. From both bodies a light substance is born ,
which.. precisely takes up a middle position between the two
extremes".  
  
Schumaker: The product of the distillation and reunion will "dominate
less solid substances, but because of its own subtlety it will
‘penetrate' and hence dominate, other solid things less pure and
quasi-spiritual than itself".  
  
**On \#11**  
Burckhardt: "the little world is created according to the prototype of
the great world", when the human realises their original nature is the
image of God.  
  
Schumaker: "The alchemical operation is a paradigm of the creative
process. We may note the sexual overtones of what has preceeded"  
  
**On \#12**  
Burckhardt: "In the Arabic text this is: “This way is traversed by the
sages".  
  
**On \#13**  
Hortulanus: "He here teaches in an occult manner the things from which
the stone is made." "the stone is called perfect because it has in
itself the nature of minerals, ofvegetables and of animals. For the
stone is three and one, tripple and single, having four natures.... and
three colours, namely black, white and red. It is also called the grain
of corn because unless it shall have died, it remains itself alone. And
if it shall have died... it bears much fruit when it is in
conjunction..."  
  
Newton: "on account of this art Mercurius is called thrice greatest,
having three parts of the philosophy of the whole world, since he
signifies the Mercury of the philosophers.... and has dominion in the
mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, and the animal kingdom".  
  
Bacstrom: the wisdom of the world (?) is hidden in "Chiram and its Use".
Hermes "signifies a Serpent, and the Serpent used to be an Emblem of
Knowledge or Wisdom."  
  
Burckhardt: "The three parts of wisdom correspond to the three great
divisions of the universe, namely, the spiritual, psychic and corporeal
realms, whose symbols are heaven, air and earth".  
  
Schumaker: "The usual explanation of Tristmegistus.. is that Hermes was
the greatest philosopher, the greatest priest, and the greatest king".  
  

  

### General

  
  
Trithemius: "our philosophy is celestial, not worldly, in order that we
may faithfuly behold, by means of a direct intuition of the mind through
faith and knowledge, that principle which we call God...."  
  
Trithemius: "Study generates knowledge; knowledge prepares love; love,
similarity; similarity, communion; communion, virtue; virtue, dignity;
dignity, power; and power performs the miracle".  
  
Newton "Inferior and superior, fixed and volatile, sulphur and
quicksilver have a similar nature and are one thing, like man and wife.
For they differ from one another only by degree of digestion and
maturity. Sulphur is mature quicksilver, and quicksilver is immature
sulphur: and on account of this affinity they unite like male and
female, and they act on each other, and through that action they are
mutually transmuted into each other and procreate a more noble offspring
to accomplish the miracles of this one thing". "And just as all things
were created from one Chaos by the design of one God, so in our art all
things... are born from this one thing which is our Chaos, by the design
of the Artificer and the skilful adaptation of things. And the
generation of this is similar to the human, truly from a father and
mother".  
  
Blavatsky: the mysterious thing "is the universal, magical agent, the
astral light, which in the correlations of its forces furnishes the
alkahest, the philosopher's stone, and the elixir of life. Hermetic
philosophy names it Azoth, the soul of the world, the celestial virgin,
the great Magnes, etc" It appears to be that which gives organisation
("the maze of force-correlations"), and form i.e. the perfect geometry
of snowflakes.  
  
Sherwood Taylor: "the operation of the Sun.. was carried out by a
‘spirit', universal, the source of all things, having the power of
perfecting them. Its virtue is integral \[\# 6a\] (ie having the power
to convert the diverse into a single substance), if it be turned into
earth (ie. solidified). This conveyed that the Stone was to be a
solidified pneuma. Pneuma was the link between earth and heaven, having
the virtue of the celestial and subterranean regions- the power of the
whole cosmos from the fixed stars to the centre of the earth. It
overcomes every nature and penetrates every solid. It is the source of
the whole world and so it can be the means of changing things in a
wonderful way. The three parts of the philosophy of the whole world are
presumably of the celestial, terrestrial, and subterranean regions".  
  
Shah: The table is "the same as the Sufi dictum... ‘Man is the
microcosm, creation the macrocosm - the unity. All comes from One. By
the joining of the power of contemplation all can be attained. This
essence must be separated from the body first, then combined with the
body. This is the Work. Start with yourself, end with all. Before man,
beyond man, transformation'".  
  

  

### A COMMENTARY OF IBN UMAIL

  
HERMUS said the secret of everything and the life of everything is
Water.... This water becomes in wheat, ferment; in the vine, wine; in
the olive, olive oil.... The begining of the child is from water....
Regarding this spiritual water and the sanctified and thirsty earth,
HERMUS the great, crowned with the glorious wisdom and the sublime
sciences, said \[\#1\] Truth it is, indubtible, certain and correct,
\[\#2\] that the High is from the Low and the Low is from the High. They
bring about wonders through the one, just as things are produced from
that one essence by a single preparation. Later by his statement \[\#4\]
Its father is the Sun and its mother the Moon he meant their male and
their female. They are the two birds which are linked together in the
pictures given regarding the beginning of the operation, and from them
the spiritual tinctures are produced. And similarly they are at the end
of the operation. Later in his statement \[\#7 ?\] the subtle is more
honourable than the gross, he means by the subtle the divine spiritual
water; and by the gross the earthly body. As for his later statement
\[\#8\] with gentleness and wisdom it will ascend from the earth to the
sky, and will take fire from the higher lights, he means by this the
distillation and the raising of the water into the air. As for his later
statement \[\#8a\] It will descend to the earth, containing the strength
of the high and the low, he means by this the breathing in (istinshaq)
of the air, and the taking of the spirit from it, and its subsequent
elevation to the highest degree of heat, and it is the Fire, and the low
is the body, and its content of the controlling earthly power which
imparts the colours. For there lie in it those higher powers, as well as
the earthly powers which were submerged in it.  
  
The natural operation and decay causes it to be manifest, and hence the
strength of the earth, and of the air, and of the higher fire passed in
to it. Later he said \[\#9\] it will overcome the high and the low
because it in it is found the light of lights: and consequently the
darkness will flee  
from it. \[See Stapleton et al. p 74, 81.\]
