### SECTION IV

"Understand, then, O Son of Wisdom, what the Stone declares: 'Protect me
and I will protect Thee; increase my strength that I may help thee! My
Sol and my beams are most inward and secretly in me, my own Luna, also,
is my light, exceeding every other light, and my good things are better
than all other good things, I give freely, and reward the intelligent
with joy and gladness, glory, riches, and delights, and them that seek
after me I make to know and understand, and to possess divine things.'

<span id="page_142">p. 142</span>

"Behold, that which the philosophers have concealed is written with
seven letters; for Alpha and Yda follow two, and Sol in like manner
follows the book. Nevertheless, if thou art willing that he should have
Dominion, observe the Art, and join the son to the daughter of the
water, which is Jupiter and a hidden secret.

"Auditor, understand. Let us use our Reason. Consider all with the most
accurate investigation, which in the contemplative part I have
demonstrated to thee, the whole matter I know to be the one only thing.
But who is he that understands the true investigation and inquires
rationally into this matter? It is not from man, nor from anything like
him or akin to him; nor from the ox or bullock, and if any creature
conjoins with one of another species, that which is brought forth is
neutral from either."

"Thus saith Venus: 'I beget light, nor is the darkness of my nature, and
if my metal be not dried all bodies desire me, for I liquefy them and
wipe away their rust, even I extract their substance. Nothing, therefore
is better or more venerable than I, my brother also being conjoined.'

"But the King, the Ruler, to his brethren, testifying of him, saith: 'I
am crowned, and I am adorned with a royal diadem. I am clothed with the
royal garment, and I bring joy and gladness of heart, for being chained,
I caused my substance to lay hold of, and to rest within the arms and
breast of my mother, and to fasten upon her substance, making that which
was invisible to become visible, and the occult matter to appear. And
everything which the philosophers have hidden is

generated by us. Hear, then, these words, and understand them. Keep
them, and meditate thereon, and seek for nothing more. Man in the
beginning is generated of nature, whose inward substance is fleshy, and
not from anything else. Meditate on these plain things, and reject what
is superfluous.'

"Thus saith the philosopher: 'Botri is made from the citrine, which is
extracted out of the Red Root, and from nothing else; and if it be
citrine and nothing else Wisdom was with thee. It was not gotten by thy
care, nor if it be freed from redness, by thy study. Behold, I have
circumscribed nothing. If thou hast understanding, there be but few
things unopened.

"Ye Sons of Wisdom! Turn then the Breym Body with an exceeding great
fire, and it will yield gratefully what you desire. And see that you
make that which is volatile, so that it cannot fly, and by means of that
which flies not. And that which yet rests upon the fire, as it were
itself a fiery flame, and that which in the heat of a boiling fire is
corrupted, is cambar.

"And know ye that the Art of this permanent water is our brass and the
colouring of its tincture and blackness is then changed into the true
red.

"I declare that, by the help of God, I have spoken nothing but the
truth. That which is destroyed is renovated, and hence the corruption is
made manifest in the matter to be renewed, and hence the melioration
will appear, and on either side it is a signal of Art."
