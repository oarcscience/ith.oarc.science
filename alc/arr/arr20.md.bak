# 'AUREUS,' OR THE GOLDEN TRACTATE

### SECTION I

EVEN thus saith Hermes:

"Through long years I have not ceased to experiment, neither have I
spared any labour of mind, and this science and art I have obtained by
the sole inspiration of the Living God, who judged fit to open them to
me His servant, who has given to rational creatures the power of
thinking and judging aright, forsaking none or giving to any occasion to
despair. For myself, I had never discovered this matter to anyone had it
not been from fear of the judgment and the perdition of my soul, if I
concealed it. It is a debt which I am desirous to discharge to the
faithful as the Father of the faithful did liberally bestow it upon me.

"Understand ye then, O Sons of Wisdom, that the knowledge of the four
elements of the ancient philosophers was not corporally or imprudently
sought after, which are through patience to be discovered according to
their causes and their occult operation. But, their operation is occult,
since nothing is done except the matter be decompounded and because it
is not perfected unless the colours be thoroughly passed and
accomplished. Know then, that the division that was made upon the water,
by the ancient philosophers, separates it into four substances, one into
two, and three into

<span id="page_132">p. 132</span>

one, the third part of which is colour, as it were--a coagulated
moisture; but the second and third waters are the Weights of the Wise.

"Take of the humidity, or moisture, an ounce and a half, and of the
Southern Redness, which is the soul of gold, a fourth part, that is to
say, half an ounce; of the citrine Seyre, in like manner, half an ounce;
of the Auripigment, half an ounce, which are eight; that is three
ounces. And know ye that the vine of the wise is drawn forth in three,
but the wine thereof is not perfected, until at length thirty be
accomplished.

"Understand the operation, therefore. Decoction lessens the matter, but
the tincture augments it, because Luna in fifteen days is diminished,
and in the third she is augmented. This is the beginning and the end.
Behold, I have declared that which was hidden, since the work is both
with thee and about thee; that which was within is taken out and fixed,
and thou canst have it either in earth or sea.

"Keep, therefore, the Argent vive, which is prepared in the innermost
chamber in which it is coagulated; for that is the Mercury which is
celebrated from the residual earth.

"He, therefore, who now hears my words, let him search into them, which
are to justify no evil-doer, but to benefit the good; therefore I have
discovered all things that were before hidden concerning this knowledge,
and disclosed the greatest of all secrets, even the Intellectual
Science.

"Know ye, therefore, Children of Wisdom, who inquire concerning the
report thereof, that the vulture standing upon the mountain crieth out
with a loud

<span id="page_133">p. 133</span>

voice: 'I am the White of the Black, and the Red of the White, and the
Citrine of the Red, and behold I speak the very Truth.'

"And know that the chief principle of the art is the Crow, which is the
blackness of the night and the clearness of the day, and flies without
wings. From the bitterness existing in the throat the tincture is taken,
the red goes forth from his body, and from his back is taken a thin
water.

"Understand, therefore, and accept this gift of God which is hidden from
the thoughtless world. In the caverns of the metals there is hidden the
stone that is venerable, splendid in colour, a mind sublime and an open
sea. Behold, I have declared it unto thee; give thanks to God who
teacheth thee this knowledge, for He in return recompenses the grateful.

"Put the matter into a moist fire, therefore, and cause it to boil, in
order that its heat may be augmented, which destroys the siccity of the
incombustible nature, until the radix shall appear; then extract the
redness and the light parts, till only about a third remains.

"Sons of Science! For this reason are philosophers said to be envious,
not that they grudged truth to religious or just men, or to the wise,
but to fools, ignorant and vicious, who are without Self-Control and
benevolence, lest they should be made powerful, and able to perpetrate
sinful things. For of such the philosophers are made accountable to God,
and evil men are not admitted worthy of this wisdom.

"Know that this matter I call the stone, but it is also named the
feminine of magnesia, or the hen, or the white spittle, or the volatile
milk, the incombustible

<span id="page_134">p. 134</span>

oil, in order that it may be hidden from the inept and ignorant, who are
deficient in goodness and self-control; which I have nevertheless
signified to the wise by one only epithet, viz., the Philosophers'
Stone.

"Include, therefore, and conserve in this sea, the fire, and the
heavenly bird, to the latest moment of his exit. But I deprecate ye all,
Sons of Philosophy, on whom the great gift of this knowledge being
bestowed, if any should undervalue or divulge the power thereof to the
ignorant, or such as are unfit for the knowledge of this secret. Behold,
I have received nothing from any to whom I have not returned that which
had been given me, nor have I failed to honour him; even in this I have
reposed the highest confidence.

"This, O Son, is the concealed Stone of many colours, which is born and
brought forth in one colour; I know this and conceal it. By this, the
Almighty favouring, the greatest diseases are escaped, and every sorrow,
distress and evil and hurtful thing is made to depart; for it leads from
darkness into light, from this desert wilderness to a secure habitation,
and from poverty and straits to a free and ample fortune."
