#### DEDICATORY EPISTLE

##### TO THE ABOVE-NAMED NOBLE AND HONOURABLE FRIENDS AND MASTERS.

I neither can nor will withhold from my honoured and beloved friends the
knowledge of this Spagyric Art, and of the most precious and miraculous
Arcanum, which I have not only seen with my own eyes, but also executed
with my own hands, by changing a mass of lead into solid gold,
persistently resisting any test of fire, through the addition of a small
particle of our transmutatory powder. It can no longer be pretended that
our Art does not possess the power which it claims, or that the Mercury
of the Sages is not the great and glorious fountain of all natural
marvels. This wonderful secret has, through the grace of God, been
revealed to me, and as it is unworthy of man, created in the image of
God, to maintain silence in regard to God's miraculous works, like the
brute beasts, I have determined to unveil this grand Arcanum to you, my
beloved friends; and I will now gird myself to tell you all that I know
and have heard of the sayings and doings of the Great Artist Elias. It
was not, indeed, he who revealed to me the grand secret; yet his
conversation was so instructive that I cannot refrain from reporting it
to you word for word. It is my earnest wish, honoured friends and
masters, that this Book may meet with a kindly reception at your hands,
and that you may derive from it both enjoyment and profit. With this
hope, I remain,

Your humble Servant,

#### CHAPTER I.

BEFORE I begin to write about the philosophical Pygmy vanquishing the
Giants, my honoured friends and masters, you must permit me to
transcribe a passage from the works of Helmontius (*Arbor Vitæ*, folio
630): "I cannot but believe that there is such a thing as a gold and
silver making Stone. At the same time, I cannot shut my eyes to the fact
that hundreds of painstaking Alchemists are daily being led astray by
impostors or ignorant professors of the Spagyric Art." For this reason I
shall not be astonished if—immediately upon perusing my book—multitudes
of these deluded victims start up, and contradict the assertion which I
have made in regard to the truth of this Art. One of these gentry
denounces Alchemy as a work of the Devil; another describes it as sheer
nonsense and humbug; a third admits the possibility of transmuting
metals into gold, but maintains that the whole process costs more money
than it is worth. But I do not wonder at these opinions. It is a
hackneyed saying of human nature that we gape at those things whose
purpose we do not understand, but we investigate things pleasurable to
know. The Sages should therefore remember the words of Seneca (*De
Moribus*): "You are not yet blessed, if the multitude does not laugh at
you." But I do not care whether they believe or contradict my teaching
about the transmutation of metals; I rest calmly satisfied in the
knowledge that I have seen it with my own eyes, and performed it with my
own hands. Even in our degenerate age these wonders are still possible;
even now the Medicine is prepared which is worth twenty tons of gold,
nay, more, for it has virtue to bestow that which all the gold of the
world cannot buy, *viz*., health. Blessed is that physician who knows
our soothing medicinal Potion of Mercury, the great panacea of death and
disease. But God does not reveal this

<span id="page_276">p. 276</span>

glorious knowledge to all men indiscriminately; and some men are so
obtuse (with a judicial blindness) that they wonder at the activity of
the simplest forces of Nature, as, for instance, the attractive power
which the magnet exercises upon the steel. But (whether they believe it
or not) there is a corresponding magnetic force in gold which attracts
Mercury, in silver which attracts copper, and so with all other metals,
minerals, stones, herbs, plants, etc. . . . We must not be surprised at
this persistent opposition to truth: the light of the sun pains the eyes
of owls.

As a matter of fact, we human beings take too much upon ourselves in
hastily and dogmatically judging of things which we do not understand.
We deny the influence of the stars upon earthly things, and by that
denial only exhibit our ignorance. And what do we know of the secret
forces which slumber in plants. You may know nothing of the glory of the
Angels, the brightness of the heavens, the transparency of the air, the
limpidity of the water, the variety of colours in flowers, the hardness
of stones and metals, the proportionate beauty of men and animals, the
image of God in regenerate souls, the faith of believers, the
rationality of the mind, &c.—for we may be blind and without feeling or
understanding—and yet the beauty of all these things is not in the least
affected by our ignorance.

If we bear these considerations in mind, they ought to stop our mouths
when we feel tempted to deny the possibility of such wonderful
transmutatory virtue being inherent in our Stone. Still, it must not be
supposed that I wish to force this knowledge upon any one. God has
reserved it for the worthy, and I know that it can never become known to
the wicked, the irreligious, or the scornful. All I propose to do is to
lay before the reader, for his diligent consideration, those
conversations which have passed between the Artist Elias and myself, in
regard to the nature of this Stone, the splendour of which (being more
glorious than the dawn, more brilliant than a carbuncle, more bright
than the sun or gold) has not yet faded from my mind. The contempt of
the scornful, and the ignorance of the foolish I despise. Their
ephemeral babble will soon be swept away by the river of forgetfulness;
but our triumphant Art, which is established upon a foundation of
adamant, upon the foundation'

<span id="page_277">p. 277</span>

of God's own truth, will abide unshaken throughout all ages. For adepts
according to ancient experience have given their word that this natural
mystery is only to be found with JEHOVA Saturninely placed in the centre
of the world. But those we call blessed, who can purge the Queen of the
Sages of her impurity, who can circulate the Catholic Virgin Earth by
means of our crystalline Physico-magical Art, and who have beheld the
King, with his crown on his head, and his strength of inward fire, come
forth from the chamber of his crystal grave, his bodily semblance
glorified with all the most beautiful hues that the world affords, like
a shining carbuncle, or like a transparent, compact, and diaphanous
crystal—like a salamander that has spued forth all water, and washes
away the leprosy of base metals with fire. Moreover, they shall behold
the abyss of the Spagyric Art, where in the mineral kingdom, the same so
royal art has, to a certain extent, for many years (in, as it were, the
safest retreat of all) lain concealed. The Sages have seen the river in
which Æneas was cleansed of his mortality—the river of Pactolus in Lydia
which was changed into gold by King Midas bathing in it—the bath of
Diana—the spring of Narcissus—the blood of Adonis trickling upon the
snowy breast of Venus, whence was produced the anemone—the blood of
Ajax, from which sprang the beautiful hyacinth flower—the blood of the
Giants killed by Jupiter's thunderbolt—the tears which Althea shed when
she doffed her golden robes—the magic water of Medea, out of which grass
and flowers sprang forth—the Potion which Medea prepared from various
herbs for the rejuvenescence of old Jason—the Medicine of
Aesculapius—the magic juice, by the aid of which Jason obtained the
Golden Fleece—the garden of the Hesperides, where the trees bear golden
apples in rich abundance—Atalanta turned aside from the race by the
three golden apples—Romulus transformed by Jupiter into a god—the
transfiguration of the soul of Julius Cæsar into a Comet—Juno's serpent,
Pytho, born of decomposed earth after Deucalion's flood—the fire at
which Medea lit her seven torches—the Moon kindled by Phaëthon's
conflagration—Arcadia, in which Jupiter was wont to walk abroad—the
habitation of Pluto in whose vestibule lay the three-headed Cerberus—the
Pile, on which Hercules burnt those limbs which he had received from his

<span id="page_278">p. 278</span>

mother, with fire, till only the fixed and incombustible elements
derived from his father were left, and he became a god—and the rustic
cottage whose roof was made of pure gold. Blessed, yea, thrice blessed,
is the man to whom Jehovah has revealed the method of preparing that
Divine Salt by which the metallic or mineral body is corrupted,
destroyed, and mortified, while its soul in the meantime is revived for
the glorious [resurrection](errata.htm#11.md) of the philosophical
body—blessed, I say, is he to whom the knowledge of our Art is
vouchsafed in answer to prayer throughout all his work for the Holy
Spirit! For it should be remembered that this is the only way in which
our Art of Arts is vouchsafed to man, and if you would attain it, the
service of God ought to be your chief business. By committing themselves
to this sacred and practical path of piety, and to theosophical
colloquies alone with Jehovah, all true students of this Art will in due
course of time, behold the sight which will gladden their hearts.
Blessed, also, is he to whom some adept graciously flings wide the gates
of knowledge, and to whom the golden road of the King is thus
manifested! . . I am afraid that the Preface will not please all my
readers; nevertheless, I have a good hope that it will cheer and hearten
the better part of them. Drink, my friends, from the fountain of truth,
which wells forth in the Dialogue that I shall hereafter set down, and
slake therewith the thirst of your souls, for my words shall be sweeter
to you than nectar or ambrosia. For I bear in mind the saying of Julius
Cæsar Scaliger that "the end of wisdom is its communication," and the
teaching of Gregory of Nyssenus, who affirms "that the good delight to
impart their knowledge to others, because it is the greatest joy to them
to be useful."

#### CHAPTER II.

The truth of this Art is maintained by many illustrious writers, of whom
the following are the most distinguished representatives of their class:

Paracelsus (*Rev. Natur.*, ix., fol. 358) has the following words: "The
true sign by which the Tincture of the Physicists is known, is its power
of transmuting all imperfect metals into silver (if it be white) or gold
(if it be red), if but a small particle

<span id="page_279">p. 279</span>

of it be injected into a mass of such metals liquefied in a crucible."

Again: "The invincible Star of the Metals vanquishes all things, and
changes them into a nature similar to its own. This gold and silver are
better than those found in mines for the preparation of arcane medicines
from it."

Again: "I say that any Alchemist, who has the Star of Gold, can change
all metals into that precious substance."

Again: "Our Tincture of Gold contains stars, is a substance of the
greatest fixity, is unchangeable in multiplication, is a red powder
(with almost a saffron tinge), liquid like resin, transparent like
crystal, fragile like glass, is of a rubinate colour, and of great
specific gravity."

Again, in Paracelsus' book called "The Heaven of the Sages," and in his
seventh book on the "Transmutation of Natural Things," he bears witness
to the same fact: "Transmutation is a great natural mystery, which is by
no means—as fools suppose—contrary to the course of Nature, or the law
of God. Without this Philosopher's Stone, the imperfect metals can be
transmuted neither into gold nor silver."

Paracelsus, in his Manual concerning the Medicinal Philosopher's Stone,
says: "Our Stone is the heavenly and super-perfect Medicine, because it
washes away all the impurities of metals."

Henry Khunrath, in his "Amphitheatre of Eternal Wisdom" (fol. 147), has
the following words: "I have visited many lands, and had speech of many
learned men. I have seen the Green Catholic Lion, and the Blood of the
Lion, *i.e.*, the Gold of the Sages, with my own eyes, have touched it
with my hands, tasted it with my tongue, smelt it with my nose. By its
means I have cured many whose life was despaired of."

Again (fol. 202): "That which I describe is not a myth: you shall handle
it with your hands, see it with your eyes,—that Azoth, or Catholic
Mercury of the Sages, which, together with inward and outward fire, in
sympathic harmony, through an unavoidable necessity, physico-magically
united, is alone sufficient for the preparation of our Stone."

Again: "You shall see the Philosopher's Stone, our King and Lord of
Lords, go forth from the chamber of its crystal tomb into

<span id="page_280">p. 280</span>

this world, with its glorified body, regenerate and transcendently
perfect, a brilliant carbuncle, whose most subtle and fully purified
parts, being harmoniously mixed, are bound inseparably into one,
altogether smooth, translucid as crystal, compact and exceedingly
weighty. It is easily fused in fire, as resin, and after the flight of
artificial quicksilver, just as wax. Without smoke it enters and
penetrates solid bodies as oil enters paper. It is soluble in any
liquid, melting and commingling with the same, fragile as glass, in a
powder saffron-coloured, but in a solid mass, red like the ruby. Its
purple colour is the mark of perfect fixation and fixed perfection, for
it remains fixed and incombustible, even when exposed to fire, corrosive
waters, or burning sulphur, since it is, like the salamander, incapable
of being consumed by fire."

Again: "When the White Tincture is added to metals as a ferment, it
transmutes them into purest silver; when the Red Tincture is mixed with
pure gold, it is, within three days, multiplied by the quantity of the
gold."

Helmontius ("On Life Eternal," page 590) has the following words:—"I
have seen the Stone, and touched it with my own hands. . . . .
One-fourth of a grain of this powder, wrapped up in paper, I have cast
upon eight ounces of boiling quicksilver in a crucible, and immediately
the whole mixture was congealed into a mass like yellow wax; when the
fusion was completed, the crucible contained eight ounces of purest gold
(less eleven grains). So one grain of our powder had transmuted into
purest gold 19,186 times its own weight of quicksilver,—and this process
can be repeated indefinitely. The powder cleanses the metal from all
impurity, and protects it from rust, decay, and fire, etc.

Again, the same Helmontius says, in his "Tree of Life" (page 630):—"I am
compelled to believe that there is a Stone which produces gold and
silver; for I have several times, with my own hands, projected one grain
of powder upon one thousand grains of boiling quicksilver, which was
thereby, in the presence of a great multitude of spectators, immediately
transformed into precious gold. He who first gave me some of this
transmutatory powder, had of it at least as much as would have sufficed
for the production of 200,000 pounds of gold. He gave me about

<span id="page_281">p. 281</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> ½ grain of the
powder, with which I transmuted 9¾ ounces of quicksilver.

Moreover, the most honourable and profoundly learned Dr. Theodore
Ketjes, an eminent physician resident at Amsterdam, gave me a medal on
which were the following inscriptions:

<span id="img_28100"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![](tn/28100.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/28100.jpg.md)</span>

On the obverse of the medal there appeared the following words:

<span class="small">AS THIS ART IS RARE AMONG MEN,  
SO IT IS RARELY EXHIBITED:  
PRAISED BE GOD FOR EVER WHO  
HAS COMMUNICATED PART OF  
HIS INFINITE POWER TO US HIS MOST  
ABJECT CREATURES.</span>

<span id="page_282">p. 282</span>

It is also said that, in 1660, Alexander (a Scotch adept) effected a
change of imperfect metals into gold, at Cologne, and at Hanover, etc.

There are also other instances on record of such transmutations having
taken place.

The following is a genuine extract from a letter written by Dr.
Kuffler:—

"First I found in my own laboratory, aquafortis, next in that of
*Charles de Roy*, I poured it over calx of gold prepared in the ordinary
way, and after the third cohobation, it sublimated with itself the
tincture of gold in the neck of the retort, which I mingled with silver
precipitated in the ordinary way, and I beheld that it had transmuted
one ounce of sublimated tincture of gold in the crucible with the usual
flux, and two ounces of precipitated silver, into an ounce-and-a-half of
the best gold, while the third portion remained silver. The gold was
white and fixed, but the remaining two parts were the best silver, fixed
under the test of any fire. This is my experience, and I need not say
that it has made me a most enthusiastic believer in Alchemy."

I, Helvetius, have seen this gold, without the tincture, white.

Another proof of the genuineness of this Art was given at the Hague, in
the year 1664, when a silversmith, of the name of Gril, in the presence
of many [witnesses](errata.htm#12.md), transformed one pound of lead,
partly into gold, and partly into silver. Gril had obtained the Tincture
from a certain weaver of the name of John Caspar Knöttner, with the
injunction to use it for metals only - Gril placed it with some lead in
a glass cake dish, and after about a fortnight the above change was
found to have taken place. I can testify to the genuineness of this
case, as Gril was personally known to me, and I saw the transmuted lead,
which exhibited on its surface a most beautiful silver crystal, in the
form of a star, as though prepared by most ingenious artifice with a
circle. The pity was that Gril, being obstinate and crafty, would not
let Knöttner know whether it was his "Spirit of Salt" that had effected
the change; and some time afterwards, when Gril's obstinacy had at
length been overcome, Knöttner had forgotten which of his many chemical
preparations he had given to him, and, before he was able to find out,
he and his family

<span id="page_283">p. 283</span>

were swept away by the plague, while Gril fell into the water and was
drowned. Afterwards, not one of the many goldseekers was able to
discover the secret which died with them. Nevertheless, it is a matter
of never ceasing admiration that the Philosopher's Stone should have the
power of transmuting, in so short a time, the dull and heavy nature of
lead into the bright and brilliant nature of silver and gold; of this
natural law, however, we have an illustration in the fact that steel, by
contact with the magnet, acquires its magnetic power.

#### CHAPTER III.

Since promises are all the more acceptable, the more quickly they are
fulfilled, I will now, without any further delay, address myself to the
task which I have set myself to accomplish.

On the 27 December, 1666, in the forenoon, there came to my house a
certain man, who was a complete stranger to me, but of an honest, grave
countenance, and an authoritative mien, clothed in a simple garb like
that of a Memnonite. He was of middle height, his face was long and
slightly pock-marked, his hair was black and straight, his chin close
shaven, his age about 43 or 44, and his native province, as far as I
could make out, North Holland.

After we had exchanged salutations, he asked me whether he might have
some conversation with me. He wished to say something to me about the
Pyrotechnic Art, as he had read one of my Tracts (directed against the
Sympathetic Powder of Dr. Digby), in which I hinted a suspicion whether
the Grand Arcanum of the Sages was not after all a gigantic hoax. He,
therefore, took that opportunity of asking me whether I could not
believe that such a grand mystery might exist in the nature of things,
by means of which a physician could restore any patient whose vitals
were not irreparably destroyed. I answered: "Such a Medicine would be a
most desirable acquisition for any physician; nor can any man tell how
many secrets there may be hidden in Nature; yet, though I have read much
about the truth of this Art, it has never been my good fortune to meet
with a real Master of the Alchemical Science." I also enquired whether
he was a medical man, since

<span id="page_284">p. 284</span>

he spoke so learnedly about the Universal Medicine. In reply, he
modestly disclaimed my insinuation, and described himself as a
brassfounder, who had always taken a great interest in the extraction of
medicinal potions from metals by means of fire. After some further
conversation; the Artist Elias (for it was he) thus addressed me: "Since
you have read so much in the works of the Alchemists about this Stone,
its substance, its colour, and its wonderful effects, may I be allowed
the question, whether you have not yourself prepared it?" On my
answering his question in the negative, he took out of his bag a
cunningly-worked ivory box, in which there were three large pieces of a
substance resembling glass, or pale sulphur, and informed me that here
was enough of the Tincture for the production of 20 tons of gold. When I
had held the precious treasure in my hand for a quarter of an hour
(during which time I listened to a recital of its wonderful curative
properties), I was compelled to restore it to its owner, which I could
not help doing with a certain degree of reluctance. After thanking him
for his kindness in showing it to me, I then asked how it was that his
Stone did not display that ruby colour which I had been taught to regard
as characteristic of the Philosopher's Stone. He replied that the colour
made no difference, and that the substance was sufficiently mature for
all practical purposes. My request that he would give me a piece of his
Stone (though it were no larger than a coriander seed), he somewhat
brusquely refused, adding, in a milder tone, that he could not give it
me for all the wealth I possessed, and that not on account of its great
preciousness, but for some other reason which it was not lawful for him
to divulge; nay, if fire could be destroyed in that way, he would
immediately throw it all into the fire. Then, after a moment's
consideration, he enquired whether I could not shew him into a room at
the back of the house, where we should be less liable to the observation
of passers-by. On my conducting him into the state parlour (which he
entered without wiping his dirty boots), he demanded of me a gold coin,
and while I was looking for it, he produced from his breast pocket a
green silk handkerchief, in which were folded up five medals, the gold
of which was infinitely superior to that of my gold piece. On the medals
appeared the following inscriptions:—

<span id="page_285">p. 285</span>

<span id="img_28500"></span> <span align="CENTER"> [![](tn/28500.jpg)  
Click to enlarge](img/28500.jpg.md)</span>

I was filled with admiration, and asked my visitor whence he had
obtained that wonderful knowledge of the whole world? He replied that it
was a gift freely bestowed on him by a friend who had stayed a few days
at his house, who had also taught him to change common flints and
crystals into stones more precious than rubies, chrysoliths, and
sapphires; he also revealed to me the preparation of crocus of iron (an
infallible cure for dysentery), of metallic liquid (an efficacious
remedy for dropsy), and of many other infallible Medicines, to which,
however, I paid no great heed, as I was impatiently anxious to have the
chief

<span id="page_286">p. 286</span>

secret of all revealed to me. The Artist told me that his Master had
bidden him bring him a glass full of warm water, to which he had added a
little white powder, and in which one ounce of silver had melted like
ice in warm water. Of this draught he emptied one-half, and gave the
rest to me. Its taste resembled that of fresh milk, and its effect was
most exhilarating."

I asked my visitor whether the potion was a preparation of the
Philosopher's Stone? But he answered: "You should not be so
inquisitive."

Then he told me that, at the bidding of the Artist, he had taken down a
piece of leaden water-pipe, and melted the lead in a pot, whereupon the
Artist had taken some sulphureous powder out of a little box on the
point of a knife, and cast it into the melted lead, and that after
exposing the compound for a short time to a fierce fire, he had poured
forth a great mass of molten gold upon the brick floor of the kitchen.

"The Master bade me take one-sixteenth of the gold for myself as a
keepsake, and to distribute the rest amongst the poor; which I did by
making over a large sum in trust to the Church of Sparrendam. At length,
before bidding me farewell, my friend taught me this Divine Art."

When my strange visitor had concluded his narrative, I besought him to
give me a proof of his assertion, by performing the transmutatory
operation on some metals in my presence. He answered evasively, that he
could not do so then, but that he would return in three weeks, and that,
if he was then at liberty to do so, he would shew me something that
would make me open my eyes. He appeared punctually to the promised day,
and invited me to take a walk with him, in the course of which we
discoursed profoundly on the secrets of Nature in fire, though I noticed
that my companion was very chary in imparting information about the
Grand Arcanum; he spoke very learnedly and gravely concerning the
holiness of the Art (just as if he were a clergyman), and said that God
had commanded the initiated to make the secret known only to the
deserving. At last I asked him pointblank to shew me the transmutation
of metals. I besought him to come and dine with me, and to spend the
night at my house; I entreated; I expostulated; but in vain. He remained
firm. I reminded him of his promise. He

<span id="page_287">p. 287</span>

retorted that his promise had been conditional upon his being permitted
to reveal the secret to me. At last, however, I prevailed upon him to
give me a piece of his precious Stone—a piece no larger than a grain of
rape seed. He delivered it to me as if it were the most princely
donation in the world. Upon my uttering a doubt whether it would be
sufficient to tinge more than four grains of lead, he eagerly demanded
it back. I complied, in the hope that he would exchange it for a larger
piece; instead of which he divided it in two with his thumb, threw away
one-half and gave me back the other, saying: "Even now it is sufficient
for you." Then I was still more heavily disappointed, as I could not
believe that anything could be done with so small a particle of the
Medicine. He, however, bade me take two drachms, or half an-ounce of
lead, or even a little more, and to melt it in the crucible; for the
Medicine would certainly not tinge more of the base metal than it was
sufficient for. I answered that I could not believe that so small a
quantity of Tincture could transform so large a mass of lead. But I had
to be satisfied with what he had given me, and my chief difficulty was
about the application of the Tincture. I confessed that when I held his
ivory box in my hand, I had managed to extract a few small crumbs of his
Stone, but that they had changed my lead, not into gold, but only into
glass. He laughed, and said that I was more expert at theft than at the
application of the Tincture. "You should have protected your spoil with
'yellow wax,' then it would have been able to penetrate the lead and to
transmute it into gold. As it was, your Medicine evaporated, by a
sympathetic process, in the metallic smoke. For all metals, gold,
silver, tin, and mercury, are corrupted by the fumes of lead, and
degenerated into glass." I shewed him the crucible, and there he
discovered the yellow piece of Medicine still adhering to it. He
promised to return at nine o'clock the next morning, and then he would
shew me that my Medicine could well be used for transmuting lead into
gold. With this promise I had to declare myself satisfied. Still I asked
him to favour me with some information about the preparation of the
Arcanum. He would not tell me anything about the cost and the time; "as
to its substance," he continued, "it is prepared from two metals or
minerals; the minerals are better because they contain a larger

<span id="page_288">p. 288</span>

quantity of mature Sulphur. The solvent is a certain celestial Salt, by
means of which the Sages dissolve the earthy metallic body, and this
process elicits the precious Elixir of the Sages. The work is performed
from beginning to end in a crucible over an open fire; it is consummated
in four days, and its cost is only about three florins. Neither the
Mineral from the Egg nor the Solvent Salt are very expensive." I replied
that his statement was contradicted by the sayings of the Sages, who
assign seven or nine months as the duration of the Work. His only answer
was that the sayings of the Sages were to be understood in a
philosophical sense and no ignorant person could apprehend their true
meaning. I besought him that, as a stranger had made known to him this
precious mystery, so he would extend to me the same kindness, and give
me at least some information which would remove all the most formidable
obstacles out of my path; for if one knew one thing, other facts
connected with it were more easily discovered. But the Artist replied:
"It is not so in our Magistery; if you do not know the whole operation
from beginning to end, you know nothing at all. I have told you all; yet
you do not know how the crystal seal of Hermes is broken, and how the
Sun colours it with the marvellous splendour of its metallic rays, or in
what mirror the metals see with the eyes of Narcissus the possibility of
their transmutation, or from what rays adepts collect the fire of
perfect metallic fixation." With these words, and a promise to return at
nine o'clock the next morning, he left me. But at the stated hour on the
following day he did not make his appearance; in his stead, however,
there came, a few hours later, a stranger, who told me that his friend
the Artist was unavoidably detained, but that he would call at three
o'clock in the afternoon. The afternoon came; I waited for him till
half-past seven o'clock. He did not appear. Thereupon my wife came and
tempted me to try the transmutation myself. I determined, however, to
wait till the morrow, and in the meantime, ordered my son to light the
fire, as I was now almost sure that he was an impostor. On the morrow,
however, I thought that I might at least make an experiment with the
piece of "Tincture" which I had received; if it turned out a failure, in
spite of my following his directions closely, I might then be quite
certain that my visitor had been a

<span id="page_289">p. 289</span>

mere pretender to a knowledge of this Art. So I asked my wife to put the
Tincture in wax, and I myself, in the meantime, prepared six drachms of
lead; I then cast the Tincture, enveloped as it was in wax, on the lead;
as soon as it was melted, there was a hissing sound and a slight
effervescence, and after a quarter of an hour I found that the whole
mass of lead had been turned into the finest gold. Before this
transformation took place, the compound became intensely green, but as
soon as I had poured it into the melting pot it assumed a hue like
blood. When it cooled, it glittered and shone like gold. We immediately
took it to the goldsmith, who at once declared it to be the finest gold
he had ever seen, and offered to pay fifty florins an ounce for it.

The rumour, of course, spread at once like wildfire through the whole
city; and in the afternoon, I had visits from many illustrious students
of this Art; I also received a call from the Master of the Mint and some
other gentlemen, who requested me to place at their disposal a small
piece of the gold, in order that they might subject it to the usual
tests. I consented, and we betook ourselves to the house of a certain
silversmith, named Brechtil, who submitted a small piece of my gold to
the test called "the fourth": three or four parts of silver are melted
in the crucible with one part of gold, and then beaten out into thin
plates, upon which some strong aquafortis is poured. The usual result of
this experiment is that the silver is dissolved, while the gold sinks to
the bottom in the shape of a black powder, and after the aquafortis has
been poured off, and melted once more in the crucible, resumes its
former shape. . . . When we now performed this experiment, we thought at
first that one-half of the gold had evaporated; but afterwards we found
that this was not the case, but that, on the contrary, two scruples of
the silver had undergone a change into gold.

Then we tried another test, *viz*., that which is performed by means of
a septuple of Antimony; at first it seemed as if eight grains of the
gold had been lost, but afterwards, not only had two scruples of the
silver been converted into gold, but the silver itself was greatly
improved both in quality and malleability. Thrice I performed this
infallible test, discovering that every drachm of gold produced an
increase of a scruple of gold, but the

<span id="page_290">p. 290</span>

silver is excellent and extremely flexible. Thus I have unfolded to you
the whole story from beginning to end. The gold I still retain in my
possession, but I cannot tell you what has become of the Artist Elias.
Before he left me, on that last day of our friendly intercourse, he told
me that he was on the point of undertaking a journey to the Holy Land.
May the Holy Angels of God watch over him wherever he is, and long
preserve him as a source of blessing to Christendom! This is my earnest
prayer on his and our behalf.

#### CHAPTER IV.

I will now proceed to give an account of the conversations which passed
between the Artist Elias and myself (the Physician), on the occasion of
his kindly visits to my house. The reader is to imagine the Artist
entering my room, and introducing himself with the following words:

I salute you, Dr. Helvetius. I am one of the readers of the Tract you
wrote against Dr. Digby, and his Sympathetic Pills, and I should like to
have some conversation with you on 'his and kindred subjects. I am a
close student of Nature's secrets, and delight in the company of those
who have a kindred aim. And, certainly, I have found as the result even
of my paltry investigations, that no natural marvels are to be rashly
pronounced impossible.

PHYSICIAN.

Let me bid you a hearty welcome. Discourses on the secrets of Nature are
the great delight of my heart, as they are of yours. Come with me, I
pray you, into my study.

ARTIST ELIAS.

You do, indeed, possess a wonderfully well-equipped laboratory, and I
make no doubt that, by its means, you have sounded all the secret depths
of Alchemy. But why do you keep so many medicines? Do you not believe
that there exists in the nature of things one or more remedies, fully
capable of counteracting disease in all cases, where neither the heart,
the

<span id="page_291">p. 291</span>

liver, nor the lungs, are entirely destroyed, or the vital juices
altogether consumed?

PHYSICIAN.

From what you say I conclude that you are either one of the profession,
or else a Master of the Chemical Art. I do believe, as you say, that
there exist in Nature other more excellent medicines than any that I
possess. This view is both natural and reasonable, and it is supported
by the authority of many celebrated writers. They tell us of a certain
Universal Medicine, which, as they say, is known only to the elect, but
it enables its possessors to heal all diseases (even those otherwise
incurable), and to prolong their lives almost indefinitely. Yet is
anyone able to conduct us to this miraculous fountain, whence this
vitalizing water is drawn? I am afraid it is a hopeless aspiration.

ARTIST ELIAS.

I am not, as you suppose, a physician, but only a brass-founder. I have,
however, from a very early age, taken an all-absorbing interest in the
Art of Alchemy, and the secret qualities of metals. And as a result of
my investigations (humble as they have been), I most decidedly incline
to the belief that the discovery of the Medicine you mention will, even
in our degenerate age, be vouchsafed to some earnest student, as a
reward of prayer and work.

PHYSICIAN.

It is true that God grants His gifts to those who love Him ungrudgingly
and without upbraiding. But I also find that in former ages, as in our
own, there have lived hosts of chemists who have spent their lives, as
the saying is, in scooping up water with a sieve. Moreover, it seems
quite impossible to gain from the writings of the genuine Sages any
intelligible information, either as to the substance or the mode of
preparation of this Universal Philosopher's Stone. . . . In the
meantime, it is the duty of a good physician to make the most of those
appliances for the cure of disease, which are actually within his reach.
If he refused to give any medicines until he had discovered the

<span id="page_292">p. 292</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> Universal Remedy,
his patients would suffer through his folly and carelessness. Moreover,
taking into consideration the great variety of human constitutions, I
really do not see how one Medicine can possibly cure all diseases; the
effect of morbid matter upon the glands and vital juices of different
persons being well known to be utterly different. If you give a certain
quantity of wine to Peter, it will make him quarrelsome, and even
furious; its effect on Paul is to produce in him the mildness and
timidity of a lamb; in Matthew it causes gaiety and laughter; while it
makes Luke melancholy and tearful. In the same way, the morbid matter
known as scorbutic poison becomes, in Peter's case, an acid, consuming
the whole of the vital juices and organs, and breaking out on his hands
and feet in the shape of bluish, discoloured boils. The same poison in
the body of Paul is changed into a bitter aperient, which shews itself
on the arms and feet in the form of subcutaneous red spots, with
punctures like flea-bites, and, in times of plague, turns to anthrax. In
the body of Matthew the poisonous fluid is of a sweetish taste, and
produces on arms and legs watery tumours, like those seen in dropsical
subjects; in times of plague, they turn to plague sores. In Luke's case,
the humour is saltish and acrid; the swellings on his arms and legs are
dry and inflammatory; and when there is infectious matter in the air,
the sores become so red and malignant as to produce madness and death.
It stands to reason, then, that these different symptoms require
different treatment, and that no one herb or medicine could possibly
suffice for such different cases. The volatile bitter salt of
Cochlearia, which relieves Peter, makes Paul worse; a fixed acid salt
only aggravates the symptoms of Luke, but it very often suffices to
produce a complete cure in the case of Paul. In every instance we
require a remedy which is different from the morbid matter already in
the system, and therefore capable of counteracting it. In the face of
this need of specific remedies for every particular form of disease, you
must pardon a medical man if he does not quite see the possibility of an
Universal Medicine.

ARTIST ELIAS.

I admit the truth of all that you say, as far as the Vegetable Kingdom
is concerned, though very few physicians employ this

<span id="page_293">p. 293</span>

method of cure. At the same time, I see no reason why there should not
be in the Mineral Kingdom an Universal Medicine which combines all the
virtues of the different vegetable remedies you have named. I
acknowledge that this Gift of Grace is bestowed only on a few persons;
but the truth of the Alchemistic Art is too strongly supported to admit
of any doubt.

PHYSICIAN.

I have by no means exhausted the list of objections which may with
reason be urged against the existence of this Universal Medicine. But
how can the same remedy be equally suited to the case of a man or a
woman, a delicate and a robust person, the initiatory or the final stage
of a disease, a chronic or an acute affection?

ARTIST ELIAS.

Your arguments against the Universal Medicine are very learned and
orthodox, and I am not disinclined to allow to them some importance. At
the same time, you will admit that "many men many minds" is a saying of
some weight, and those who know anything by experience, are the best
qualified to speak about it. The sweetest music does not delight all
hearers; the best story appears dull to some readers; some like one kind
of food or wine and some another: and so there are as many different
verdicts about this Universal Medicine as there are (self-constituted)
judges. But only he who is acquainted with its properties has a right to
deliver an authoritative opinion. Now, it is quite true that in your
common, tinkering Medicinal Art, which seeks to counteract only the
separate symptoms or manifestations of disease, there is no room for an
Universal Medicine. But the true physician knows that all disease
(whatever shape it may assume) is simply a depression of the vital
spirits, and that whatever strengthens vitality, will cut off the
possibility of disease at the very source, expelling the humours which
each produce their own peculiar malady, and I maintain that our
Universal Medicine is a remedy of this radical kind. It gently promotes
and quickens the movement of the vital spirits, and thus, by renewing
the source of life, renovates and quickens

<span id="page_294">p. 294</span>

the whole frame, infusing new vitality and strength into every part. For
this reason adepts call it the Great Mystery of Nature, and the
preventive of old age and disease. By its aid any man may live the full
term of days naturally allotted to him, and need have no fear of
contagion, even when the plague, or some other malignant epidemic, is
striking down hundreds of his neighbours.

PHYSICIAN.

If I take your meaning, this Remedy does not set itself merely to
correct depraved humours, but directly restores the vital spirits
themselves; and it cannot prolong existence beyond the span of life
originally allotted to each man by the Creator, though it does prevent
his being cut off prematurely by weakness or disease. All this sounds
very reasonable. But there is another question I should like to ask.
Does this Medicine change a man's temperament, so as to convert a
phlegmatic person into one of a sanguine character, or a melancholy
person into a gay and jovial boon companion?

ARTIST ELIAS.

Certainly not. It is impossible for any medicine of any kind to alter
the nature of a man: just as wine does not produce a change in a man,
but only brings out his true character. The effect of the Universal
Medicine is of a corresponding kind. It is like the warmth of the Sun,
which does not change or even modify the shapes, colours, and scents of
the different flowers, but only fully develops all that is in them by
means of its genial influence. . . . If our Universal Medicine possessed
the property of prolonging the life of man beyond the term assigned to
each individual by Divine foreknowledge, no doubt Sages like Hermes
Trismegistus, Paracelsus, Raymond Lullius, Count Bernhard, and many
other genuine possessors of this Great Mystery, would be still with us
in the land of the living. It would be folly and madness to suppose that
any medicine in the whole world can do more than protect a man against
being cut off prematurely, *i.e.*, before his appointed time.

<span id="page_295">p. 295</span>

PHYSICIAN.

All that you have said about the operation of this Blessed Universal
Medicine seems both reasonable and in harmony with Nature's general plan
of working. The worst of it is that, though I now fully believe in the
existence of the Medicine, all my efforts to find it have hitherto
resembled the futile endeavours of a mariner who, attempting to put out
to sea in a frail boat, is again and again driven back to the shore by
the united force of wind and wave. Though many illustrious persons have
written concerning the preparation, they have so cautiously veiled it,
that the smallest possible number might become acquainted with the steps
to be taken to arrive at their desire. The best thing one can do, I
think, is to stay in one's laboratory, work and pray, and wait for God's
blessing.

ARTIST ELIAS.

You reason well, my friend; yet you must not despair of learning the
secret of the Alchemists' Art, especially if you can induce some adept
to become your teacher. But we will now proceed to discuss the
transmutatory virtues of our most precious Stone, which are still more
wonderful than its medicinal properties.

PHYSICIAN.

Oh, I see! You wish to discuss the transmutation of metals. In the
possibility of such transmutation, I certainly do feel constrained to
believe, considering that I have heard and read of cases which admit of
no manner of doubt, and in which such transmutation is attested by the
most authentic and trustworthy witnesses (such as Dr. Kiffler, Helmont,
Scotus, &c.), as having really taken place. I am especially thinking of
that wonderful experiment of metallic transformation which was achieved
at Prague, in the presence of the German Emperor Ferdinand III., when,
by means of one grain of the Tincture, three pounds of Mercury were
changed into the best gold; for that event was commemorated by a medal
struck at the Imperial Mint. But though I firmly believe in the
possibility of such a transmutatory Tincture, I have never in the whole
course of my life come across any one who possessed it.

<span id="page_296">p. 296</span>

ARTIST ELIAS.

You are quite right in what you say, albeit your belief or unbelief
could not make any difference to the truth of our Art, just as a magnet
would go on attracting steel, and rendering it magnetic by such contact,
even if you did not credit it. It is also true that hitherto our secret
has been rather hidden than revealed by those who have written about it
in the obscurest of language. But you can no longer feel disposed to
doubt that which you see with your own eyes; and here in this box you
behold a large quantity of the true substance of the Sages. There!
Examine it.

PHYSICIAN.

Is this yellow, sulphureous, glassy substance really and truly the
Philosopher's Stone? Did you prepare it yourself? Surely you are hoaxing
me!

ARTIST ELIAS.

No, indeed; you now hold the most precious of mundane treasures in your
hand; and I myself prepared it from beginning to end. If you can take me
to a room where we shall be more secret, I will show you some gold
obtained through its means (and having been ushered into the state
parlour, he produced the five medals described above). These (said he) I
keep in memory of my Master.

PHYSICIAN.

So you had a Master from whom you learned the glorious secret! How
wonderful that I should at this moment be holding the true substance in
my hands! Can you not give me a small piece of it, just enough to
transmute four grains of lead into gold, so that I may be able to test
the truth of your statement? Do give me a piece, at least as large as a
grain of mustard seed, and let me make the trial! It would be a great
kindness.

ARTIST ELIAS.

I admit that a certain stranger once instructed me both as to the
possibility of this Art, and in its methods of procedure.

<span id="page_297">p. 297</span>

<span class="contnote">\[paragraph continues\]</span> But I cannot give
you even a small fragment of my Tincture, though you offered me this
room full of ducats; not because the substance is so precious in my
eyes, but for another momentous reason which I may not reveal. Indeed,
if fire could consume fire, I should at once throw the whole of this
Tincture on the hearth. I will, however, return to you after the lapse
of three weeks, and shew you some beautiful experiments which will both
surprise and delight ycu. If by that time I shall have obtained leave to
do so, I will also satisfy your curiosity by performing in your presence
a change of lead into gold. In the meantime, I bid you good-bye, and
warn you not to invest too much of your substance in the pursuit of this
Art, as it will all turn to ashes.

PHYSICIAN.

I am deeply obliged to you for your kindness in coming to me, and
shewing me this Stone; but you can hardly expect me to be satisfied with
the mere sight of it. I am one of those whose souls are always athirst
for knowledge; and I believe that if our first parent Adam, who lost
Paradise by touching the forbidden fruit, were alive at the present day,
he would once more risk the happiness of his life in order to become
possessed of the "golden apples from the garden of Atlas." I thank you
most heartily, however, for comforting me with the prospect of your
return in three weeks. I will endeavour to spend the interval in strict
obedience to your wise and kindly counsel; but you may easily suppose
that the feeling uppermost in my mind will be one of eager hope and
longing for the fulfilment of your promise. I also thank you for the
proof of your confidence involved in making yourself known to me as an
adept of this Art. If the secret which you have entrusted to my safe
keeping, were, by any accident, to come to the ears of a tyrannical
prince or noble, would you be terrified by his threats into betraying
it?

ARTIST ELIAS.

I have never made this secret known to anyone except to. yourself and
one good old man. Nor must any human being hear or see the like in
future. But if any prince or king were to cast me into prison, or put me
to the rack, he would not be able

<span id="page_298">p. 298</span>

to extract a single syllable of direct or indirect information from me
by the most cruel tortures which he could devise; not even death itself
would make me shrink from the path of duty, or become disloyal to my
trust.

PHYSICIAN.

Are there any Alchemistic writers that are more easily understood than
the rest, or who can at least be warranted to possess a real knowledge
of those things wherein they undertake to instruct others?

ARTIST.

I do not read many of these books; but of all the writers on Alchemy
whose works I have studied, I have found Sendivogius, the Cosmopolitan,
to be the most trustworthy; also Basilius, in his twelve Keys. Truth has
chosen the obscure style of Sendivogius for her hiding-place, if you
could only discover her—just as our Substance is really and truly hidden
and concealed in the outward bodies of all metals and minerals.

PHYSICIAN.

Accept once more my warmest thanks for all your kindness and friendly
counsel. I do indeed believe that, as you say, the essences of metals
are hidden in their outward bodies, as the kernel is hidden in the nut.
Every earthly body, whether animal, vegetable, or mineral, is the
habitation and terrestrial abode of that celestial spirit, or influence,
which is its principle of life and growth. The secret of Alchemy is the
destruction of the body, which enables the Artist to get at, and utilize
for his own purposes, the living soul. But what man is sufficient to
search out this wonderful secret?

ARTIST ELIAS.

You have spoken truly, and judged rightly concerning the natural
destruction of things; and if you find grace in the sight of God, He
will commission either me or some other adept of our Art to unfold to
you the right way of destroying the outward bodies of metals and seizing
the inward, vital, life-giving

<span id="page_299">p. 299</span>

soul. This gracious gift, I say, God may bestow on you sooner than you
think, in answer to devout and earnest prayer. Once more, farewell, and
rest assured that I will always remain your friend. I cherish a fond
hope that I shall soon see you again, in a flourishing state of health.

With these words he departed; and I have already told you how after
three weeks he came back and gave me a small piece of the transmutatory
Tincture. But since our second parting I have neither set eyes on him,
nor heard either of him or from him.

He has, however, left deeply seated in my heart the conviction that
through metals and out of metals purified by highly refined and
spiritualized metals there may be prepared the living gold and
quicksilver of the Sages, which bring both metals and human bodies to
perfection. If my friend had condescended to give me one or two
practical hints as to the best method of proceeding in this Magistery, I
might have discovered the grand secret of collecting the rays of the Sun
and Moon in their own proper womb, whereby their power of metallic
transmutation by magnetic sympathy might have been brought out. Thus I
might have obtained the red seed which transmutes into gold, and the
white seed which transmutes into silver. For the Artist Elias told me
that the Chalybs of Sendivogius was that true Mercurial metallic humour
which—without the aid of any corrosive—would suffice to separate the
fixed rays of the Sun and Moon from their body, and to render them
volatile and Mercurial for the dry philosophical Tincture which he
shewed me, and the efficacy of which I subsequently experienced. This is
the same method by which metals are still being produced day by day in
the bowels of the earth, and stones developed, in their different saline
wombs, out of the spiritual tingent sulphureous seed. . . . . Metallic
sulphur mixed with saltpetre, may be converted, by gentle heat, first
into solid earth, then into air, then into limpid water, and then into
glass of a most beautiful colour, and of a penetrativeness superior to
that of fire—just as the chicken is developed out of the apparently
lifeless egg by gentle heat. Between the different metals there exists a
sympathy such as that between the magnet and steel, gold and
quicksilver, silver and copper;

<span id="page_300">p. 300</span>

and this sympathy is the *rationale* of the transmutation of metals. On
the other hand, there are also metallic antipathies, such as that of
lead to tin, of iron to gold, of lead to mercury—antipathies which have
their counterpart in the animal and vegetable worlds. An accurate and
comprehensive knowledge of these sympathies and antipathies is the one
great qualification of every man who aspires to be a Master of this Art.

In making known to you all that I have seen and experienced, I am only
following the maxim of Seneca, who said that he desired knowledge
chiefly that he might impart it to others. If anyone doubts the truth of
my statements, let him but live a pious and Christ-like life here below,
and he will learn the truth of all things in the new Jerusalem above.
That a share of this glory may be vouchsafed to you and him, is the
prayer of

Your faithful and loving servant,                           
JOHN FREDERICK HELVETIUS, M.D.
